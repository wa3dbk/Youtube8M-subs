00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:18.130
 welcome these informative capsules 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:21.460
 of invoked dotcom with you the other 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:23.470
 day to the ladies in the healing of 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.869
 australia I wanted to ask him before this 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:28.570
 cream says that it perfects the skin 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:31.029
 unique and mental approach 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.610
 apart from that goal this is a cream 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:35.800
 corrective that is made of immune lime 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.870
 of the formula with which it is made and 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.239
 place that cysteine if a cream 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.739
 special so that for there is a 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:42.970
 better absorption probably when 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:46.539
 you put it on it's going to be a little bit 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:49.059
 hard but I recommend that you mix 

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:51.489
 use a little extra water after 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:55.390
 of the demonstration that we saw the tip of 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:57.100
 Beauty of placing is at night is 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.960
 very good one or two hours before 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.579
 lie down to be saving people already 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.070
 regularly is a little bit more 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:04.600
 quiet to go to sleep not the 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.100
 I recommend that you put it before going to 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.460
 sleep because it has stabilized it 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.860
 going to go on the pillow or by the contact 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.440
 and you are going to lose this 100% is absorbed 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.740
 and most importantly what 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:20.619
 in this cream is that 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:24.340
 the spots that people usually 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:26.710
 has old age by the lines of 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.710
 expression that are formed by the process 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.119
 of long- term cellular oxidation in 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.490
 the processes of the things that you give are 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:37.049
 older this starts to make a 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:40.960
 cell regeneration in that way the 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:43.149
 famous crow's feet begin to 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:46.799
 strengthen the skin begins to strengthen 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:49.149
 that also to the spots that are very 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.850
 strong especially for being exposed 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:53.560
 much to the sun this begins to see a 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.679
 correction as I said at the cellular level 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:02:00.959
 and start to change your skin little by little 

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:04.539
 to have better results is better 

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:07.080
 ingest via arm and monkey lime and put 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:11.670
 of your skin for a 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:14.850
 cell training, as we have already done 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.920
 spoken of local the dot that is left to 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.200
 the version that can be mixed too 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.090
 with the cream and you can go out to my flower 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.890
 can not where they are on the outside if 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.650
 on the contrary it is this is a protector 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.050
 solar what makes a layer exists 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.180
 protective for our skin that's why it's 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.910
 that the stains these by exposure to 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.560
 sun will disappear little by little and 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.200
 if it is very good to use it 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.570
 especially ladies who have already passed 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.670
 35-40 years old when they start to see 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.230
 lines of expression and presence with that 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.090
 immuno caddy steve that we were 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.830
 not talking about all the capsules that is 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.270
 extremely good as I have it 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.370
 conventional vote before they start 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.840
 to use the ditto in three weeks 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.970
 when they stop for cell phone they take another photo 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.830
 so there is a difference in texture 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.640
 and color of your skin is also what 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.640
 also has 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:05.010
 this pasta is the savior of the 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.780
 children I tell him because apart from that 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:10.959
 It is made by the same slime technique 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:15.209
 local this pasta has a sale of 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:19.750
 natural origin and apart has a 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:23.680
 function mainly the cysteine ​​that 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:26.230
 protects teeth and enamel from 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.599
 teeth right now in this time many 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:31.299
 companies are selling products for 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:33.639
 teeth whitening what happens is that 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:35.290
 this is like a little sandpaper at the time 

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:37.420
 to be brushing one starts to 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:40.989
 learn in smart and that is why there is so much 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:43.450
 amount of decay comparison with the 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:46.090
 Monkey toothpaste what does it do is 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:48.280
 whitening and separating produces a layer 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.519
 protective against cavities that's why 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.709
 which is recommended to use it tomorrow 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:55.569
 late and night before the food and 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:57.730
 after the food and especially 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:59.620
 children to prevent tooth decay 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.470
 brush your teeth thoroughly before 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:04.350
 to go to sleep because 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:07.620
 saliva is an acid and if they have 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:09.330
 sugars will start to break your 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.160
 enamel and that 's why is that many children 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:13.200
 currently they have many faces and they do not 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.870
 they have no effect was like an effect 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.180
 secondary can be passed has it a 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.760
 used a nice mint flavor very 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:24.270
 slight is not as exaggerated as the others 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.800
