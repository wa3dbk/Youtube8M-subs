 God 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.110
 so guys today we're going to talk about 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.090
 loss of hair 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.610
 after all the hair loss after 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.170
 bariatric surgery is normal that it is 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.600
 agent during the postoperative period 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.910
 reduction of the patient submitted to the 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.550
 to bariatric surgery you may notice a 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.500
 increase in hair loss for some 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.020
 people can actually fall into kofu 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.879
 others fall a lot of hair however personal 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.129
 when this fall occurs that is a 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.440
 normal process due to the adaptation of the 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.750
 body that has to compensate for this loss 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.850
 then he temporarily suspends the 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.949
 production of new hair to keep hair 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.720
 with their nutrients without 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.460
 to mention the fact that hormones are 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.439
 produced in lesser quantities 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.049
 after surgery while all the fat 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.689
 is being metabolized the body needs 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.790
 reorganize in your nutrition the 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.860
 result hair begins to fall one 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.530
 discreet hair loss can happen 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.420
 in up to 70% of patients during this 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.490
 weight loss process this fact 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.009
 usually occurs between the third 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.229
 the fourth month after the reduction of 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.240
 extends to the eighth and is motivated 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.430
 by the rapid weight loss that it causes 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.770
 that the organism saves on the production of 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.420
 zinc and non-client proteins 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.030
 essential for the maintenance of 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.500
 good hair and what would be the solution 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.540
 according to my research the 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.340
 main way of reducing the drop in 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.860
 hair after bariatric surgery is 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.700
 consuming foods high in protein or 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:58.200
 be foods like milk to meat 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:00.409
 egg white cheeses white cereals 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.409
 integrals 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:10.200
 chestnuts beans chickpeas peas and 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.850
 plenty of water 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.890
 the hair is built with protein 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.980
 so make sure you're 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.770
 taking or eating protein 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:22.620
 days as well as staff packed foods 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:28.320
 in zinc as lean beef 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:30.090
 lean meat peanut seconds all of 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.010
 according to the sentence of the diet I passed 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.850
 and the plan passed by the 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:38.790

 dyeing hair can leave what a 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.320
