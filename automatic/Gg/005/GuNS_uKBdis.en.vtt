going to throw you I'm going to show you
three<00:00:14.349> different<00:00:14.380> methods<00:00:14.950> to<00:00:15.340> throw<00:00:15.580> cards

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:15.790 
three different methods to throw cards

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:17.400 
three different methods to throw cards
and<00:00:16.059> I'm<00:00:16.119> going<00:00:16.269> to<00:00:16.299> let<00:00:16.480> you<00:00:16.660> pick<00:00:16.930> which<00:00:17.140> one

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:17.410 
and I'm going to let you pick which one

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:20.760 
and I'm going to let you pick which one
works<00:00:18.010> the<00:00:18.160> best<00:00:18.400> for<00:00:18.490> you<00:00:19.020> so<00:00:20.020> the<00:00:20.230> first<00:00:20.470> one

you're<00:00:25.390> going<00:00:25.510> to<00:00:25.570> tuck<00:00:26.320> the<00:00:26.500> card<00:00:26.710> right<00:00:27.010> in

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:27.220 
you're going to tuck the card right in

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.070 
you're going to tuck the card right in
the<00:00:27.760> corner<00:00:28.180> just<00:00:28.420> right<00:00:28.630> into<00:00:28.869> these

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:29.080 
the corner just right into these

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.470 
the corner just right into these
knuckles<00:00:29.470> if<00:00:29.590> you<00:00:29.680> can<00:00:30.000> barely<00:00:31.000> barely<00:00:31.300> barely

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:31.480 
knuckles if you can barely barely barely

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.729 
knuckles if you can barely barely barely
see<00:00:32.109> it<00:00:32.199> that's<00:00:33.069> it<00:00:33.309> and<00:00:33.569> then<00:00:34.620> you're<00:00:35.620> just

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:35.739 
see it that's it and then you're just

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:36.989 
see it that's it and then you're just
going<00:00:35.889> to<00:00:35.979> want<00:00:36.190> the<00:00:36.280> car<00:00:36.429> to<00:00:36.550> kind<00:00:36.729> of<00:00:36.789> float

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:36.999 
going to want the car to kind of float

00:00:36.999 --> 00:00:39.180 
going to want the car to kind of float
freely<00:00:37.300> when<00:00:37.749> you<00:00:37.870> throw<00:00:38.109> it<00:00:38.289> you<00:00:38.829> tuck<00:00:39.039> it

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.190 
freely when you throw it you tuck it

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.279 
freely when you throw it you tuck it
back<00:00:39.339> into<00:00:39.579> your<00:00:39.729> wrist<00:00:39.969> just<00:00:40.659> like<00:00:40.780> that<00:00:41.049> and

00:00:41.279 --> 00:00:41.289 
back into your wrist just like that and

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:44.069 
back into your wrist just like that and
then<00:00:42.039> you<00:00:42.129> throw<00:00:42.460> it<00:00:42.639> you<00:00:42.839> aren't<00:00:43.839> going<00:00:44.019> to

00:00:44.069 --> 00:00:44.079 
then you throw it you aren't going to

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:45.840 
then you throw it you aren't going to
release<00:00:44.379> the<00:00:44.620> card<00:00:44.859> because<00:00:45.069> the<00:00:45.309> card<00:00:45.579> needs

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:45.850 
release the card because the card needs

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.369 
release the card because the card needs
spin<00:00:46.179> and<00:00:46.359> if<00:00:46.420> you<00:00:46.510> release<00:00:46.809> it<00:00:46.870> it's<00:00:47.229> not

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:47.379 
spin and if you release it it's not

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:49.949 
spin and if you release it it's not
going<00:00:47.589> to<00:00:47.649> get<00:00:47.769> any<00:00:47.949> spin<00:00:48.280> and<00:00:48.879> spin<00:00:49.629> is<00:00:49.780> what

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:49.959 
going to get any spin and spin is what

00:00:49.959 --> 00:00:51.479 
going to get any spin and spin is what
makes<00:00:50.170> the<00:00:50.289> cards<00:00:50.530> go<00:00:50.679> fast<00:00:50.979> and<00:00:51.190> what<00:00:51.309> makes

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:51.489 
makes the cards go fast and what makes

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:53.039 
makes the cards go fast and what makes
them<00:00:51.609> go<00:00:51.729> accurate<00:00:52.149> so<00:00:52.269> if<00:00:52.359> you<00:00:52.479> release<00:00:52.749> it

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:53.049 
them go accurate so if you release it

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:55.859 
them go accurate so if you release it
that<00:00:53.559> won't<00:00:53.709> happen<00:00:53.920> but<00:00:54.429> if<00:00:54.999> you<00:00:55.420> throw<00:00:55.719> it

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:55.869 
that won't happen but if you throw it

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:59.189 
that won't happen but if you throw it
the<00:00:56.229> card<00:00:56.559> will<00:00:56.799> not<00:00:57.010> like<00:00:57.519> just<00:00:58.199> release

00:00:59.189 --> 00:00:59.199 
the card will not like just release

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:01.799 
the card will not like just release
itself<00:00:59.850> because<00:01:00.850> of<00:01:00.999> I<00:01:01.119> guess<00:01:01.299> like<00:01:01.449> physics

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:01.809 
itself because of I guess like physics

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:04.320 
itself because of I guess like physics
or<00:01:01.929> something<00:01:02.229> but<00:01:03.069> the<00:01:03.549> cardinal<00:01:03.940> oil<00:01:04.089> or

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:04.330 
or something but the cardinal oil or

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.380 
or something but the cardinal oil or
release<00:01:04.570> itself<00:01:05.079> causing<00:01:05.950> itself<00:01:06.759> to<00:01:07.000> spin

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
release itself causing itself to spin

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.660 
release itself causing itself to spin
and<00:01:07.719> hit<00:01:08.229> whatever<00:01:08.500> you're<00:01:08.799> aiming<00:01:08.950> for<00:01:09.130> after

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
and hit whatever you're aiming for after

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.670 
and hit whatever you're aiming for after
a<00:01:09.700> little<00:01:09.909> bit<00:01:10.000> of<00:01:10.060> practice<00:01:10.450> and<00:01:10.600> then<00:01:11.560> the

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
a little bit of practice and then the

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.679 
a little bit of practice and then the
second<00:01:12.130> method<00:01:12.250> you're<00:01:12.969> going<00:01:13.000> to<00:01:13.270> split<00:01:13.630> your

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:13.689 
second method you're going to split your

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:15.630 
second method you're going to split your
fingers<00:01:14.020> just<00:01:14.170> like<00:01:14.289> this<00:01:14.500> and<00:01:14.740> stick<00:01:15.490> the

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
fingers just like this and stick the

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.849 
fingers just like this and stick the
card<00:01:15.850> in<00:01:16.030> like<00:01:16.259> that<00:01:17.259> so<00:01:17.590> you're<00:01:17.710> going<00:01:17.829> to

00:01:17.849 --> 00:01:17.859 
card in like that so you're going to

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:20.669 
card in like that so you're going to
have<00:01:18.119> your<00:01:19.119> middle<00:01:19.329> finger<00:01:19.719> at<00:01:19.929> the<00:01:20.170> top<00:01:20.380> and

00:01:20.669 --> 00:01:20.679 
have your middle finger at the top and

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:24.090 
have your middle finger at the top and
your<00:01:21.039> thumb<00:01:21.670> at<00:01:21.850> the<00:01:21.969> back<00:01:22.210> and<00:01:22.649> then<00:01:23.649> your

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
your thumb at the back and then your

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.819 
your thumb at the back and then your
pointer<00:01:24.460> finger<00:01:24.789> in<00:01:25.030> the<00:01:25.179> middle<00:01:25.359> on<00:01:25.750> the

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:25.829 
pointer finger in the middle on the

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:28.620 
pointer finger in the middle on the
other<00:01:26.829> side<00:01:27.070> right<00:01:27.250> in<00:01:27.369> between<00:01:27.460> them<00:01:27.729> when

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
other side right in between them when

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.120 
other side right in between them when
you<00:01:28.719> throw<00:01:28.929> this<00:01:29.079> one<00:01:29.320> you're<00:01:29.649> just<00:01:29.679> going<00:01:30.070> to

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
you throw this one you're just going to

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.880 
you throw this one you're just going to
whip<00:01:30.549> your<00:01:30.729> wrist<00:01:30.999> and<00:01:31.270> like<00:01:31.539> I<00:01:31.689> said<00:01:31.749> drop<00:01:32.679> off

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
whip your wrist and like I said drop off

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.590 
whip your wrist and like I said drop off
the<00:01:33.100> thumb<00:01:33.369> and<00:01:33.609> then<00:01:33.729> let<00:01:33.939> the<00:01:34.090> card<00:01:34.329> release

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
the thumb and then let the card release

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.469 
the thumb and then let the card release
itself<00:01:34.990> so<00:01:35.200> it<00:01:35.320> gets<00:01:35.469> to<00:01:35.590> spin<00:01:36.149> this<00:01:37.149> is<00:01:37.329> my

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:37.479 
itself so it gets to spin this is my

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:40.380 
itself so it gets to spin this is my
least<00:01:37.659> favorite<00:01:37.810> throwing<00:01:38.439> method<00:01:38.829> I<00:01:39.759> never

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
least favorite throwing method I never

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.889 
least favorite throwing method I never
use<00:01:40.689> it

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:40.899 
use it

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:45.230 
use it
it's<00:01:41.109> just<00:01:42.090> unsuccessful<00:01:43.090> it<00:01:43.210> doesn't<00:01:43.479> work

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
it's just unsuccessful it doesn't work
