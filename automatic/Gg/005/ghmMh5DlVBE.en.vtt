00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.080 
it's just the graphics or what but it
played<00:02:50.480> out<00:02:50.510> like<00:02:50.780> 20<00:02:51.020> frames<00:02:51.319> per<00:02:51.410> second<00:02:51.950> so

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
played out like 20 frames per second so

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.630 
played out like 20 frames per second so
um<00:02:53.090> this<00:02:53.900> is<00:02:54.080> actually<00:02:54.560> probably<00:02:55.040> the<00:02:55.250> easiest

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
um this is actually probably the easiest

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.229 
um this is actually probably the easiest
way<00:02:55.970> to<00:02:56.000> beat<00:02:56.870> the<00:02:57.020> boss<00:02:57.760> well<00:02:58.760> first<00:02:59.000> as<00:02:59.150> you

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
way to beat the boss well first as you

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:00.729 
way to beat the boss well first as you
can<00:02:59.360> see<00:02:59.510> this<00:02:59.630> much<00:02:59.780> of<00:02:59.810> Health<00:03:00.500> flayed<00:03:00.709> him

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
can see this much of Health flayed him

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:03.070 
can see this much of Health flayed him
scattered<00:03:01.190> all<00:03:01.250> around<00:03:01.370> so<00:03:01.850> even<00:03:02.720> though<00:03:02.870> he

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
scattered all around so even though he

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.840 
scattered all around so even though he
can<00:03:03.260> kill<00:03:03.680> you<00:03:03.800> very<00:03:04.130> easily

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
can kill you very easily

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.800 
can kill you very easily
um<00:03:05.780> there's<00:03:06.290> plenty<00:03:06.620> of<00:03:06.680> food<00:03:07.300> actually<00:03:08.300> um<00:03:08.510> I

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
um there's plenty of food actually um I

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.160 
um there's plenty of food actually um I
don't<00:03:09.110> really<00:03:10.010> eat<00:03:10.459> any<00:03:10.790> food<00:03:11.209> I<00:03:11.510> eat<00:03:11.540> just<00:03:12.050> a

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
don't really eat any food I eat just a

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.750 
don't really eat any food I eat just a
little<00:03:12.440> bit<00:03:12.590> of<00:03:12.680> food<00:03:12.860> from<00:03:13.190> the<00:03:15.730> that<00:03:16.730> I

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
little bit of food from the that I

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.250 
little bit of food from the that I
already<00:03:16.940> had<00:03:17.269> and<00:03:17.540> then<00:03:17.660> I<00:03:17.840> picked<00:03:18.080> up<00:03:18.170> an

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
already had and then I picked up an

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.960 
already had and then I picked up an
orange<00:03:18.440> juice<00:03:18.709> and<00:03:18.950> ate<00:03:19.040> that<00:03:19.280> and<00:03:19.519> that's

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
orange juice and ate that and that's

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.930 
orange juice and ate that and that's
really<00:03:20.030> all<00:03:20.269> I<00:03:20.299> needed<00:03:21.069> but<00:03:22.069> my<00:03:22.280> method<00:03:22.430> is<00:03:22.790> to

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
really all I needed but my method is to

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.520 
really all I needed but my method is to
come<00:03:23.120> back<00:03:23.269> here<00:03:24.100> and<00:03:25.100> use<00:03:26.090> a<00:03:26.450> sniper<00:03:27.019> rifle<00:03:27.230> on

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
come back here and use a sniper rifle on

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.070 
come back here and use a sniper rifle on
him<00:03:27.739> and<00:03:27.950> if<00:03:28.519> I<00:03:28.760> don't<00:03:28.970> do<00:03:29.060> that<00:03:29.239> at<00:03:29.360> first<00:03:29.600> but

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
him and if I don't do that at first but

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.050 
him and if I don't do that at first but
guns<00:03:30.739> are<00:03:30.950> definitely<00:03:31.400> the<00:03:31.519> easiest<00:03:31.549> way<00:03:32.030> to

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
guns are definitely the easiest way to

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.300 
guns are definitely the easiest way to
take<00:03:32.510> him<00:03:32.690> out<00:03:32.840> because<00:03:33.709> if<00:03:33.980> you<00:03:34.130> go

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
take him out because if you go

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.400 
take him out because if you go
hand-to-hand<00:03:34.970> combat<00:03:35.390> with<00:03:35.510> him<00:03:35.690> ups<00:03:35.959> up

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
hand-to-hand combat with him ups up

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.830 
hand-to-hand combat with him ups up
there<00:03:36.680> he<00:03:37.580> has<00:03:37.760> this<00:03:37.910> punch<00:03:38.269> that<00:03:38.510> will<00:03:38.660> take

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
there he has this punch that will take

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.170 
there he has this punch that will take
out<00:03:38.989> all<00:03:39.110> but<00:03:39.530> one<00:03:39.799> half<00:03:40.250> of<00:03:40.640> your<00:03:40.820> bar<00:03:41.150> of

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
out all but one half of your bar of

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.069 
out all but one half of your bar of
Health<00:03:41.540> and<00:03:41.840> you<00:03:41.870> don't<00:03:42.590> want<00:03:42.769> that<00:03:43.959> he<00:03:44.959> also

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:45.079 
Health and you don't want that he also

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:49.240 
Health and you don't want that he also
throws<00:03:45.410> those<00:03:45.680> flares<00:03:46.100> at<00:03:46.400> you<00:03:46.579> and<00:03:48.100> you<00:03:49.100> also

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
throws those flares at you and you also

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.180 
throws those flares at you and you also
need<00:03:49.430> to<00:03:49.459> watch<00:03:49.670> out<00:03:49.880> for<00:03:49.910> zombies<00:03:50.709> the<00:03:51.709> flares

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
need to watch out for zombies the flares

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.060 
need to watch out for zombies the flares
are<00:03:52.609> for<00:03:53.390> that

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
are for that

00:03:54.070 --> 00:04:02.920 
are for that
ac-130<00:03:55.070> that's<00:03:55.790> flying<00:03:56.120> overhead<00:03:56.500> to<00:04:01.930> drop

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
ac-130 that's flying overhead to drop

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:06.550 
ac-130 that's flying overhead to drop
bombs<00:04:03.230> on<00:04:03.560> you<00:04:03.709> I<00:04:03.739> guess<00:04:04.040> and<00:04:05.140> as<00:04:06.140> you<00:04:06.260> see<00:04:06.410> here

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
bombs on you I guess and as you see here

bombs on you I guess and as you see here
I<00:04:06.620> was<00:04:06.829> trying<00:04:07.070> to<00:04:07.190> heal<00:04:07.400> but<00:04:07.579> he<00:04:07.700> kept

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
I was trying to heal but he kept

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.880 
I was trying to heal but he kept
shooting<00:04:08.239> me<00:04:08.450> and<00:04:08.780> right<00:04:09.440> there<00:04:09.590> I<00:04:09.620> thought

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:09.890 
shooting me and right there I thought

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:13.509 
shooting me and right there I thought
I'd<00:04:10.010> died<00:04:10.250> but<00:04:10.489> I<00:04:10.549> didn't<00:04:12.130> which<00:04:13.130> is<00:04:13.280> a<00:04:13.310> good

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:13.519 
I'd died but I didn't which is a good

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:14.310 
I'd died but I didn't which is a good
thing

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:14.320 
thing

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.259 
thing
but<00:04:15.320> I<00:04:15.350> finally<00:04:15.980> right<00:04:16.250> here<00:04:16.579> catch<00:04:16.940> a<00:04:17.030> break

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:17.269 
but I finally right here catch a break

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:19.870 
but I finally right here catch a break
and<00:04:17.600> get<00:04:18.049> to<00:04:18.169> drink<00:04:18.440> some<00:04:18.590> food<00:04:18.769> you<00:04:19.489> can<00:04:19.640> fall

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
and get to drink some food you can fall

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.230 
and get to drink some food you can fall
down<00:04:19.910> this<00:04:20.299> hole<00:04:20.739> and<00:04:21.739> if<00:04:22.250> that<00:04:22.430> happens<00:04:22.910> then

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.490 
down this hole and if that happens then

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
where I start using this method he

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.810 
where I start using this method he
actually<00:04:36.289> the<00:04:36.560> only<00:04:36.710> way<00:04:36.979> he<00:04:37.220> can<00:04:37.400> really<00:04:37.550> hurt

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
actually the only way he can really hurt

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:44.170 
actually the only way he can really hurt
you<00:04:38.060> is<00:04:40.419> well<00:04:41.419> the<00:04:41.510> flares<00:04:41.979> they<00:04:42.979> can<00:04:43.850> shoot

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
but they don't always hit because

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:49.600 
but they don't always hit because
you're<00:04:46.700> behind<00:04:47.060> that<00:04:47.240> wall<00:04:47.960> thing<00:04:48.430> but<00:04:49.430> mainly
