of this type however what makes this
task<00:00:47.160> hard<00:00:47.579> is<00:00:47.850> that<00:00:48.300> when<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.510> car<00:00:48.690> is

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
task hard is that when the car is

in its environment our method combines
these<00:01:18.299> two<00:01:18.509> elements<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:19.170> comes<00:01:19.770> up<00:01:19.950> with<00:01:20.070> a

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
these two elements and comes up with a

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.820 
these two elements and comes up with a
final<00:01:20.369> strategy<00:01:20.670> that<00:01:21.600> sometimes<00:01:22.200> uses<00:01:22.680> the

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
final strategy that sometimes uses the

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.760 
final strategy that sometimes uses the
