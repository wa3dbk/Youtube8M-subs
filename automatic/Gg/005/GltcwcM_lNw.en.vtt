00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:27.359
 for me the nerves third time I awarded and as always in this kind of 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:28.270
 videos 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.940
 I am offering you a network of an analysis of a technological product 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.000
 in this case a compact camera 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.110
 the kodak 17 thousand 580 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.060
 a camera in which an article is described at the time but in this 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:48.090
 our live is given so that you can appreciate 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.180
 its operation is about the team 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.130
 berlin 2 simplest that we can get to find to get good 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.630
 photographs and without complications that is the secret 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:04.710
 of this camera that also includes a pretty vaart feature 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.409
 interesting that is a poll on x 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.240
 so that 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.490
 from the optical part it is possible to expand 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.369
 up to eight times 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:18.490
 the size of the image without counting the digital simply by using its optics in 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.329
 what we achieve can see in this example that we are showing you the 

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:28.259
 image how much is it that can be obtained indicated in this approach per hundred of 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.509
 the optical part 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:33.560
 that in the opa art later of the camera we found an ample list of 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.399
 visitor sales 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:36.500
 that allows us 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.110
 He believes he can visualize what we are about to photograph as well as what the 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:42.520
 photos we had 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.000
 It includes an image tagging system that works pretty well either 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.299
 that allows us to choose within photo that we take 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.720
 What are the people that make up that image? 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.850
 and again we can use that same label 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.380
 the next time the same person appears the photograph 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.540
 which does not greatly facilitate this issue besides the camera even the 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:12.300
 system that automatically organizes the photograph by date that is given to us 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.010
 very easy to find 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.850
 if we are doing a tour but now the content of the memory and 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.490
 we want to go on time 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.390
 to an image that interests us 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.109
 another function that I also thought was very good 

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:26.230
 in art 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:33.099
 edited to run in a demonstration with what would be this point baseball d the 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:36.489
 images that we have hosted in the camera but also those that 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.769
 let's choose not all 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:43.459
 we can do as many programs do that we find on the web a 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:48.489
 multimedia presentation as it sounds jumped behind another with effects of 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:53.349
 transition between photo and photo via whatever we choose to connect from the 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:57.749
 camera the television in this way we are able to immediately 

00:02:57.749 --> 00:03:01.840
 show our friends the picture we just got with 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.120
 area in a pretty and particularly quite interesting way without 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.120
 have to go through the computer first - the efficient system is thought 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.470
 to upload images directly to photo hosting sites and 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:17.029
 video 

00:03:17.029 --> 00:03:20.700
 although for that it is necessary that he makes a computer that acts as 

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:25.100
 intermediaries does not have its own internet connection 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:26.430
 in that sense 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.509
 this decree is a failure but that the presence and many other cameras 

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:36.089
 as happens who is standing out positive affected in principle the 

00:03:36.089 --> 00:03:40.579
 speed with which the cameras that the ready to work delays less than two 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:42.659
 seconds since we turn it on 

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:45.170
 until it dictates it is in conditions 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.739
 highlighted the first photograph that's very good 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:53.489
 especially when we're in a hurry and we want to take that moment to cut that 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:54.949
 instant 

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:56.889
 that luggage systems 

00:03:56.889 --> 00:04:00.570
 percent and smart both natiq adjusted environment 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:05.680
 what it amounts to has to do with the focus with in lighting with the 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.630
 Iso sensitivity with the opening of the diaphragm 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:10.159
 there is nothing between us 

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:14.049
 percent depends on where we point the camera automatically goes 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:15.359
 accumulating 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:17.019
 to the need ticino 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:19.230
 there is a lot of silk pÃ©rez estrada 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:24.470
 that we can use so that the camera n currently the best way according to the 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:26.259
 situation where we are 

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:32.619
 some fault happened to me what to be such a compact Italian camera in the photo 

00:04:32.619 --> 00:04:37.560
 psoe works well enough if we do not work with the flash or when the 

00:04:37.559 --> 00:04:40.130
 shutter speed is somewhat slow 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:43.130
 that is to be able to take better advantage of the ambient light 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.960
 it is very difficult to get a photo lie has a system 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.900
 dl adjust the image to avoid 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.330
 and fp the fia fuzzy but 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:58.730
 did not act in the best way not only is not the best camera I found 

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:01.389
 as for this question of existing bitar 

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:03.110
 blurry images 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:07.430
 per hundred but its some way activating flash solution that is when it 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:08.150
 can 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.590
 shrink the duration version and so then to have 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:15.900
 a much more stable image another issue is that they stop with three 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:20.310
 and is that in some cases it costs the camera is the detection of faces 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:25.040
 if it has any way image is the movement there was the rotor is 

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:28.020
 pointing directly towards the lens 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.920
 when are we going to be labeling 

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:33.730
 there are some occasions the camera tells us that there is no face in 

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:36.470
 scene when we actually have a person 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:41.290
 there and that sometimes you can get annoying though it's not in the 

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:44.850
 Most of the cases occur in very specific situations for the rest 

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:49.710
 a camera that has good people good speed respect and above all that in 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:54.290
 those that encourage interest in many cases simple to use in budding is targeted 

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:57.220
 shoot and we have the photo ready I think for 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:01.000
 the more serious the users more than that you can not ask 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.790
 is due but that this was life summed up highlighted the presence of three 

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:09.580
 thousand 581 was his last proposal that has tail to express us in matter 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.650
 of practical facility photography
