00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:10.320
 I hope you are very well and good 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.139
 today is going to be a video a little bit 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.500
 different from what they normally 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:20.130
 I bring because I wanted to show you 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.589
 you how I made this double braid 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.119
 is super simple to do and me 

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:27.029
 loved because you quiet a 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.429
 disaster with the hairstyles and I did it 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.610
 also adding to my hair a little 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:36.270
 of volume with some extensions I bought 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:39.000
 some extensions online the truth came 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:43.230
 very good hair I liked a lot but 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.050
 the bad thing was that they came from one more color 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.910
 clear of what you saw in the picture of 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.070
 done watching other reviews of it 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.050
 page I realized that many of them 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.540
 The same thing happened as in the pictures 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.970
 see a color and when you get to 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.780
 another color but the quality is very very 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.200
 good 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.410
 and good 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:05.830
 I said good no matter we're going to paint them 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:07.750
 and I am left with a color a bit similar to 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.640
 of my hair and it served me well enough 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.290
 Now I have long hair and 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.270
 you may wonder why you use 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.270
 extensions and you will do it quietly in my 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.580
 long hair but I have super straight and 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:22.710
 it has almost no volume and there's 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:26.740
 hairstyles like this that require it as 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.870
 that kind of brigitte bardot hairstyles 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:32.170
 I wanted to do them but the truth 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:34.210
 that my hair looks little when I 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.430
 I make too much volume up and I do not 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.800
 like then why I sent them 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.770
 order and are several curtains but I 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:44.860
 I'm using nothing else one could have 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:47.259
 one alone but I do not know if more 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.759
 forward I can see the locution to cut me 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:52.140
 hair or something because you know 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:56.040
 that sometimes we like to change 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.229
 and good way of seeing the experts and 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.720
 just paint a curtain that is the one 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.370
 I'm using right now and the others I'm going 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:06.180
 to save I came 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:09.400
 they gave me several they came to me very well 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.710
 packaged and the truth I was delighted 

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:14.410
 I'm going to leave the link to go to 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:17.200
 see what pages I bought them and what tone 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.790
 I bought to give you an idea of ​​the tone 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.790
 that would actually come to them if 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.610
 will commission and good in general the quality 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:27.190
 I liked the bad enough , I'll tell you 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:30.430
 it was that a color came a little more 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:32.410
 clear and yes I thought about the best painting me what 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.010
 to change the look a bit but the 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:38.470
 truth is that it was too light and 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:42.730
 keep a hair of that tone is 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:46.690
 difficult because he mistreats him very well 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:49.240
 I did not want to so I preferred to paint them and 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.960
 that's all let's see the ideas I hope 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.960
 what they like 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:03:01.189
 the extensions came in this box and 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:03.799
 they came in a little bag like plastic and 

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:06.829
 also a net that does not 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:10.879
 they tangled too much but they came in a tone 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:14.150
 too light for my taste and what 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:16.730
 I did was take two different dyes 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:20.000
 tones to hit a bit to the tone 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:22.960
 of my hair that I have at this moment 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.970
 but still they were a little clearer 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:28.490
 but it's fine because that's what I'm going to give them 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:31.160
 a little light is so it mixes with 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:34.190
 the hair very well and to paint the 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:36.500
 Human hair extensions- you're going to 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:40.250
 Do exactly as if it were your hair 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:43.250
 because that's why they must be natural if 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:46.580
 they are synthetic you will not be able to fight 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:49.730
 and apply in the same way that is 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:52.340
 very uniform and you leave it exactly for 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:55.280
 the same time 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:57.500
 and the lavas and the rinses of it 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:00.580
 way and with the same care as if 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.580
 you would do with your hair 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:15.820
 now divide your hair in the part of 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.820
 behind 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:23.049
 and I'm only going to apply just one 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.049
 curtain that is the longest 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:30.820
 and they will hold up with the clips you do not 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:34.540
 do you really care that these clips 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:37.710
 they endure a lot and the truth almost 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:37.710
 nobody will notice 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:45.270
 and then comb them again so that they 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:47.430
 mix with my see with my real hair 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:51.420
 I will also use these lists 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:54.800
 to tie my braid divide your hair 

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:59.510
 in two and start to braid your hair 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.510
 normally this is very fast and easy 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:32.950
 from the sides of your braid and pulling a 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:36.010
 small amount in this way so that 

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:38.230
 be more loose appointment and with the other 

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:40.980
 half hair equal let's start 

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:40.980
 to braid 

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:52.750
 the trick is that when we pass the lock 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:57.120
 near the parts of the braid that 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:57.120
 we had loosened what we are going to join 

00:05:58.579 --> 00:06:04.799
 putting it this way with the help 

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:07.030
 of your fingers is a very easy trick of 

00:06:04.799 --> 00:06:11.640
 do 

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:11.640
 and you do not take anything with this braid 

00:06:11.689 --> 00:06:17.839
 and in this way we are weaving and 

00:06:15.259 --> 00:06:20.649
 every time we have the lock of hair 

00:06:17.839 --> 00:06:20.649
 from that side 

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:26.950
 we put it through the strand cited that 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:29.410
 we had loosened the other braid 

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:32.430
 and this is what we are doing until we reach 

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:32.430
 the bottom 

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:53.370
 and only tie one limits both 

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:53.370
 braids and it's ready 

00:06:53.849 --> 00:06:59.279
 if you want to prevent the list from being noticed 

00:06:56.219 --> 00:07:02.639
 just take a lock quoted and put it 

00:06:59.279 --> 00:07:04.919
 around the league and with the help of a 

00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:09.089
 boli pings that is more or less of the tone 

00:07:04.919 --> 00:07:11.539
 of your hair you put it this way and 

00:07:09.089 --> 00:07:11.539
 ready 

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:19.180
 I think it's a perfect hairstyle for the 

00:07:16.759 --> 00:07:19.180
 summer 

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:31.860
 I hope that today you have 

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:33.750
 liked the entertaining that we go 

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:36.030
 that you liked that we have done 

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:38.610
 something a little different that serves them 

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:40.949
 the review with that is all for the video 

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:43.939
 today I send you many kisses and 

00:07:40.949 --> 00:07:43.939
