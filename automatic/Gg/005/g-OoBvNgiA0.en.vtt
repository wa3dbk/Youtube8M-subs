00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
one of my my experimental concepts this

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.219 
one of my my experimental concepts this
is<00:01:05.070> a<00:01:05.100> PVC<00:01:06.200> trade<00:01:07.200> point<00:01:07.530> style<00:01:08.180> barbed

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
is a PVC trade point style barbed

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.820 
is a PVC trade point style barbed
fishing<00:01:10.229> point<00:01:10.500> is<00:01:11.780> tagged<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:13.200> set<00:01:13.470> in<00:01:13.619> to

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
fishing point is tagged and set in to

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.149 
fishing point is tagged and set in to
set<00:01:14.369> into<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.670> four<00:01:14.850> shaft<00:01:15.110> and<00:01:16.110> then<00:01:16.590> I've

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
set into the four shaft and then I've

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.249 
set into the four shaft and then I've
kind<00:01:17.490> of<00:01:17.610> I've<00:01:18.240> drilled<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.600> hole<00:01:18.630> through<00:01:19.049> it

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
kind of I've drilled a hole through it

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.960 
kind of I've drilled a hole through it
and<00:01:19.740> fast<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.790> kind<00:01:21.689> of<00:01:21.810> quick<00:01:22.409> release<00:01:22.970> for

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
and fast and a kind of quick release for

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.850 
and fast and a kind of quick release for
the<00:01:24.500> for<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.590> line<00:01:27.110> I've<00:01:28.110> tested<00:01:28.500> these<00:01:28.590> a<00:01:28.650> lot

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
the for the line I've tested these a lot

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:29.539 
the for the line I've tested these a lot
in<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.070> yard

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
in the yard

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.910 
in the yard
I'm<00:01:29.700> shooting<00:01:30.000> them<00:01:30.299> at<00:01:30.479> various<00:01:30.900> things<00:01:31.530> and

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
I'm shooting them at various things and

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.859 
I'm shooting them at various things and
they<00:01:32.640> seem<00:01:32.880> like<00:01:32.909> they're<00:01:33.210> gonna<00:01:33.360> work<00:01:33.630> out

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
they seem like they're gonna work out

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.630 
they seem like they're gonna work out
really<00:01:34.320> great

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
really great

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.590 
really great
it's<00:01:36.329> just<00:01:36.509> a<00:01:37.280> basically<00:01:38.280> a<00:01:38.310> fish<00:01:39.210> aren't<00:01:39.390> very

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
it's just a basically a fish aren't very

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.810 
it's just a basically a fish aren't very
hard<00:01:39.900> so<00:01:40.770> you<00:01:40.860> don't<00:01:41.009> need<00:01:41.130> a<00:01:41.189> terribly<00:01:41.549> sharp

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
hard so you don't need a terribly sharp

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:59.429 
hard so you don't need a terribly sharp
point

00:01:59.429 --> 00:01:59.439 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:02.870 

so<00:01:59.979> that<00:02:00.100> was<00:02:00.219> my<00:02:00.450> very<00:02:01.450> heavy<00:02:01.869> fishing<00:02:02.530> arrow

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
so that was my very heavy fishing arrow

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.179 
so that was my very heavy fishing arrow
this<00:02:03.880> one<00:02:04.149> is<00:02:04.719> a<00:02:04.780> lighter<00:02:05.319> target<00:02:05.770> arrow<00:02:05.920> which

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:06.189 
this one is a lighter target arrow which

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:43.840 
this one is a lighter target arrow which
will<00:02:06.340> go<00:02:06.460> much<00:02:06.909> faster

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.650 

and<00:02:44.850> there<00:02:45.300> you<00:02:45.390> have<00:02:45.420> it<00:02:45.570> it<00:02:46.530> was<00:02:46.650> a<00:02:46.680> nice<00:02:47.660> nice

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
and there you have it it was a nice nice

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.980 
and there you have it it was a nice nice
way<00:02:48.840> to<00:02:48.870> spend<00:02:49.140> the<00:02:49.290> afternoon<00:02:50.990> definitely

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
way to spend the afternoon definitely

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.350 
way to spend the afternoon definitely
something<00:02:52.350> I've<00:02:52.530> been<00:02:52.560> meaning<00:02:53.190> to<00:02:53.910> do<00:02:54.090> for<00:02:54.330> a

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
something I've been meaning to do for a

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.380 
something I've been meaning to do for a
while<00:02:54.420> had<00:02:55.350> this<00:02:55.530> piece<00:02:56.010> of<00:02:56.160> s<00:02:56.280> aged<00:02:56.520> for<00:02:57.180> a

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
while had this piece of s aged for a

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.150 
while had this piece of s aged for a
long<00:02:58.020> time<00:02:58.260> and<00:02:58.560> just<00:03:00.770> finally<00:03:01.770> decided<00:03:01.830> to

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
long time and just finally decided to

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.190 
long time and just finally decided to
put<00:03:02.760> it<00:03:02.850> together<00:03:03.030> into<00:03:03.360> something<00:03:03.600> hopefully

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
put it together into something hopefully

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.290 
put it together into something hopefully
next<00:03:04.350> week<00:03:04.620> I'll<00:03:05.240> get<00:03:06.240> some<00:03:06.510> carp<00:03:06.990> with<00:03:07.140> it
