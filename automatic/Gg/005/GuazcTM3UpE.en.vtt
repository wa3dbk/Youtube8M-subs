00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:27.980 
though this is sort of messy with all
the<00:01:26.759> water<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.390> there's<00:01:27.570> always<00:01:27.720> a<00:01:27.840> little

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
the water and there's always a little

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.539 
the water and there's always a little
bit<00:01:28.110> of<00:01:28.259> drooling<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:28.740> dripping<00:01:28.950> involved

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
bit of drooling and dripping involved

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.550 
bit of drooling and dripping involved
it's<00:01:29.880> actually<00:01:30.329> a<00:01:30.360> much<00:01:30.540> cleaner<00:01:30.930> process

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
it's actually a much cleaner process

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.350 
it's actually a much cleaner process
than<00:01:31.860> flossing<00:01:32.549> with<00:01:32.700> string<00:01:32.909> floss<00:01:33.030> and

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
than flossing with string floss and

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.539 
than flossing with string floss and
supposedly<00:01:34.049> for<00:01:34.619> most<00:01:34.770> people<00:01:35.130> it<00:01:35.250> gets<00:01:35.340> out

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
supposedly for most people it gets out

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.060 
supposedly for most people it gets out
50%<00:01:36.030> more<00:01:36.750> of<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.200> stuff<00:01:37.439> between<00:01:37.619> your<00:01:37.920> teeth

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
50% more of the stuff between your teeth

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.469 
50% more of the stuff between your teeth
I'm<00:01:38.310> hoping<00:01:38.670> that's<00:01:38.850> going<00:01:39.000> to<00:01:39.090> make<00:01:39.210> a<00:01:39.240> big

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
I'm hoping that's going to make a big

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:40.880 
I'm hoping that's going to make a big
difference<00:01:39.869> when<00:01:40.020> I<00:01:40.049> go<00:01:40.200> back<00:01:40.320> from<00:01:40.650> NX

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
difference when I go back from NX

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.950 
difference when I go back from NX
cleaning<00:01:41.250> in<00:01:41.369> a<00:01:41.430> few<00:01:41.610> months<00:01:41.850> now<00:01:42.509> when<00:01:42.930> I

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
cleaning in a few months now when I

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.480 
cleaning in a few months now when I
tried<00:01:43.320> it<00:01:43.350> out<00:01:43.560> for<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.860> first<00:01:44.040> time<00:01:44.220> if<00:01:44.399> you

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
tried it out for the first time if you

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.429 
tried it out for the first time if you
taste<00:01:44.729> ago<00:01:45.000> I<00:01:45.210> had<00:01:45.689> gotten<00:01:45.869> through<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.229> first

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
taste ago I had gotten through the first

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.590 
taste ago I had gotten through the first
side<00:01:46.710> of<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.979> quick<00:01:47.610> setup<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.240> how<00:01:48.329> to<00:01:48.390> use

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
side of the quick setup and how to use

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.060 
side of the quick setup and how to use
it<00:01:48.630> instructions<00:01:49.320> but<00:01:49.470> I<00:01:49.500> didn't<00:01:49.740> realize

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
it instructions but I didn't realize

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.160 
it instructions but I didn't realize
there<00:01:50.310> was<00:01:50.399> a<00:01:50.460> second<00:01:50.880> side<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:51.299> it<00:01:51.420> so<00:01:51.630> let<00:01:52.079> me

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
there was a second side to it so let me

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.260 
there was a second side to it so let me
show<00:01:52.290> you<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.530> video<00:01:52.649> clip<00:01:53.159> of<00:01:53.460> what<00:01:53.909> happened

00:03:10.619 --> 00:03:10.629 
cheapest one which is a it's a handheld

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:12.960 
cheapest one which is a it's a handheld
cordless<00:03:10.930> model<00:03:11.409> that's<00:03:11.769> rechargeable<00:03:12.489> but

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
cordless model that's rechargeable but

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:14.430 
cordless model that's rechargeable but
it<00:03:13.060> looks<00:03:13.209> like<00:03:13.389> you<00:03:13.510> have<00:03:13.659> to<00:03:13.780> hold<00:03:13.989> it<00:03:14.260> with

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
it looks like you have to hold it with

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:15.930 
it looks like you have to hold it with
the<00:03:14.560> water<00:03:14.769> reservoir<00:03:15.040> in<00:03:15.430> it<00:03:15.519> so<00:03:15.609> I<00:03:15.639> meant<00:03:15.819> it

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
the water reservoir in it so I meant it

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.160 
the water reservoir in it so I meant it
was<00:03:16.060> a<00:03:16.090> little<00:03:16.209> bit<00:03:16.359> heavy<00:03:16.540> and<00:03:16.750> seemed<00:03:16.930> kind

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
was a little bit heavy and seemed kind

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.050 
was a little bit heavy and seemed kind
of<00:03:17.230> unwieldy<00:03:17.739> so<00:03:17.889> I<00:03:17.920> didn't<00:03:18.129> go<00:03:18.220> with<00:03:18.340> that<00:03:18.489> and

your wand now I have had to keep it
fairly<00:04:25.330> close<00:04:25.630> to<00:04:25.900> me<00:04:26.020> for<00:04:26.229> this<00:04:26.590> to<00:04:26.800> reach<00:04:26.979> but

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
fairly close to me for this to reach but

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:28.920 
fairly close to me for this to reach but
I'm<00:04:27.310> usually<00:04:27.490> leaned<00:04:27.970> over<00:04:28.180> the<00:04:28.389> sink

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
I'm usually leaned over the sink

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:30.750 
I'm usually leaned over the sink
anyway<00:04:29.409> because<00:04:29.680> of<00:04:29.949> the<00:04:30.039> drooling<00:04:30.400> that<00:04:30.580> goes

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.760 
anyway because of the drooling that goes

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.040 
anyway because of the drooling that goes
on<00:04:30.940> so<00:04:31.150> it<00:04:31.240> hasn't<00:04:31.479> been<00:04:31.539> that<00:04:31.690> big<00:04:31.840> an<00:04:31.960> issue

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
on so it hasn't been that big an issue

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.320

00:04:36.149 --> 00:04:36.159 
you've got the adjustable power from one

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:39.689 
you've got the adjustable power from one
to<00:04:36.520> ten<00:04:36.789> this<00:04:37.419> basically<00:04:37.900> goes<00:04:38.199> from<00:04:38.530> 10<00:04:38.860> to<00:04:39.190> 90

you really does a good job just for
comparison<00:04:51.310> purposes<00:04:51.970> a<00:04:52.030> pressure<00:04:52.360> washer

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:52.690 
comparison purposes a pressure washer

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:54.570 
comparison purposes a pressure washer
that<00:04:53.110> you<00:04:53.229> use<00:04:53.409> out<00:04:53.590> on<00:04:53.620> the<00:04:53.770> driveway<00:04:54.039> it's

that you use out on the driveway it's
about<00:04:54.699> 2,000<00:04:55.389> psi<00:04:55.629> so<00:04:56.199> here<00:04:56.409> you're<00:04:56.560> going

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
about 2,000 psi so here you're going

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.510 
about 2,000 psi so here you're going
between<00:04:56.949> 10<00:04:57.340> and<00:04:57.370> 90<00:04:57.819> so<00:04:58.569> you<00:04:59.199> take<00:04:59.470> this<00:04:59.740> with
