somewhere in the middle let me give you

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.610 
somewhere in the middle let me give you
another<00:04:57.160> example<00:04:57.750> let's<00:04:58.750> say<00:04:59.020> the<00:04:59.380> souther

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620 
another example let's say the souther

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:00.960 
another example let's say the souther
have<00:04:59.800> already<00:05:00.039> brought<00:05:00.190> down<00:05:00.400> this<00:05:00.520> price<00:05:00.759> to

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:00.970 
have already brought down this price to

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:03.900 
have already brought down this price to
9500<00:05:01.900> you've<00:05:02.620> offered<00:05:02.889> the<00:05:03.160> southern<00:05:03.520> nine

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:03.910 
9500 you've offered the southern nine

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:07.159 
9500 you've offered the southern nine
thousand<00:05:04.690> dollars<00:05:05.130> he's<00:05:06.130> your<00:05:06.669> guard<00:05:06.940> down

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:07.169 
thousand dollars he's your guard down

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:09.930 
thousand dollars he's your guard down
9500<00:05:08.169> there<00:05:08.410> is<00:05:08.530> only<00:05:08.800> the<00:05:09.070> five<00:05:09.400> hundred

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:09.940 
9500 there is only the five hundred

dollar limit that you can negotiate my

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:13.980 
dollar limit that you can negotiate my
guess<00:05:12.759> is<00:05:13.000> that<00:05:13.060> you're<00:05:13.389> probably<00:05:13.630> going<00:05:13.900> to

guess is that you're probably going to

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:15.600 
guess is that you're probably going to
end<00:05:14.169> up<00:05:14.380> meeting<00:05:14.650> somewhere<00:05:15.130> in<00:05:15.190> the<00:05:15.310> middle

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:15.610 
end up meeting somewhere in the middle

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:19.409 
end up meeting somewhere in the middle
around<00:05:15.900> 9250<00:05:16.900> or<00:05:17.039> 9300<00:05:18.039> which<00:05:18.699> is<00:05:18.820> if<00:05:18.940> not<00:05:19.150> bad

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:19.419 
around 9250 or 9300 which is if not bad

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:22.159 
around 9250 or 9300 which is if not bad
now<00:05:19.870> let<00:05:20.080> me<00:05:20.110> give<00:05:20.320> you<00:05:20.440> another<00:05:20.470> example

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:22.169 
now let me give you another example

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:25.320 
now let me give you another example
let's<00:05:23.169> say<00:05:23.380> he<00:05:23.500> brought<00:05:23.710> it<00:05:23.830> down<00:05:23.979> to<00:05:24.220> 9500<00:05:25.150> and

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:25.330 
let's say he brought it down to 9500 and

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.750 
let's say he brought it down to 9500 and
you<00:05:25.570> offer<00:05:25.840> him<00:05:26.139> eight<00:05:26.500> thousand<00:05:27.340> dollars

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:27.760 
you offer him eight thousand dollars

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:31.050 
you offer him eight thousand dollars
that<00:05:28.539> is<00:05:28.570> a<00:05:29.130> $1,500<00:05:30.130> spread<00:05:30.639> that<00:05:30.820> you<00:05:30.970> were

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:31.060 
that is a $1,500 spread that you were

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.420 
that is a $1,500 spread that you were
able<00:05:31.419> to<00:05:31.750> negotiate<00:05:31.870> for<00:05:32.500> now<00:05:32.800> you<00:05:32.860> don't<00:05:33.190> want

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:33.430 
able to negotiate for now you don't want

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:35.040 
able to negotiate for now you don't want
to<00:05:33.520> go<00:05:33.610> too<00:05:33.669> low<00:05:33.970> because<00:05:34.180> you<00:05:34.479> might<00:05:34.659> be<00:05:34.870> some

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.050 
to go too low because you might be some

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:39.540 
to go too low because you might be some
off<00:05:35.199> so<00:05:36.870> a<00:05:37.870> little<00:05:38.409> ball<00:05:38.530> often<00:05:38.979> Ellis<00:05:39.310> has<00:05:39.520> to

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:39.550 
off so a little ball often Ellis has to

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:41.820 
off so a little ball often Ellis has to
be<00:05:39.699> something<00:05:40.120> that<00:05:40.330> is<00:05:40.720> somewhat<00:05:41.440> reasonable

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:41.830 
be something that is somewhat reasonable

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:46.589 
be something that is somewhat reasonable
but<00:05:42.280> still<00:05:42.610> low<00:05:43.229> so<00:05:44.229> you<00:05:44.729> had<00:05:45.729> to<00:05:45.820> $1,500

00:05:46.589 --> 00:05:46.599 
but still low so you had to $1,500

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:48.990 
but still low so you had to $1,500
spread<00:05:46.930> you<00:05:47.259> meet<00:05:47.409> some<00:05:47.650> wrong<00:05:48.000> 8700

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:49.000 
spread you meet some wrong 8700

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.420 
spread you meet some wrong 8700
worst-case<00:05:49.840> scenario<00:05:50.380> nine<00:05:50.830> thousand

worst-case scenario nine thousand
dollars<00:05:51.729> which<00:05:52.659> is<00:05:52.690> I'd<00:05:53.680> say<00:05:53.919> it's<00:05:54.070> pretty

dollars which is I'd say it's pretty
