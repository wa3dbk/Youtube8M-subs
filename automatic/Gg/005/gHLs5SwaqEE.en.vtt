at your Subaru one it actually tells you

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.390 
at your Subaru one it actually tells you
the<00:03:33.459> up<00:03:33.670> is<00:03:34.060> this<00:03:34.299> way<00:03:34.569> and<00:03:34.959> you<00:03:35.080> have<00:03:35.400> push

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
the up is this way and you have push

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.509 
the up is this way and you have push
instructions<00:03:37.120> there<00:03:37.470> the<00:03:38.470> generic<00:03:39.010> one<00:03:39.250> does

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519 
instructions there the generic one does

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:44.550 
instructions there the generic one does
not<00:03:40.650> so<00:03:42.120> but<00:03:43.120> you<00:03:43.239> can<00:03:43.420> pretty<00:03:43.599> much<00:03:43.750> determine

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
not so but you can pretty much determine

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.710 
not so but you can pretty much determine
which<00:03:44.739> way<00:03:44.980> is<00:03:45.190> up<00:03:45.220> just<00:03:45.430> by<00:03:45.849> comparing<00:03:46.599> the

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
which way is up just by comparing the

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:54.140 
which way is up just by comparing the
two<00:03:49.230> so<00:03:50.230> we're<00:03:50.530> going<00:03:50.799> here<00:03:51.840> slide<00:03:52.840> that<00:03:53.049> in

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150
