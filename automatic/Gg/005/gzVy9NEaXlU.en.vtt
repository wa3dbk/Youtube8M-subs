00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
hey everybody my name is Ryan kisser and

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.860 
hey everybody my name is Ryan kisser and
you<00:00:11.010> are<00:00:11.130> watching<00:00:11.309> how<00:00:11.730> farms<00:00:12.090> work<00:00:12.300> what

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
you are watching how farms work what

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.450 
you are watching how farms work what
we're<00:00:12.990> doing<00:00:13.170> today<00:00:13.290> is<00:00:13.620> we<00:00:13.740> are<00:00:13.769> cultivating

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
we're doing today is we are cultivating

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.039 
we're doing today is we are cultivating
our<00:00:14.580> corn<00:00:14.940> now<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:15.480> reason<00:00:15.900> we<00:00:16.020> are

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
our corn now the reason we are

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.260 
our corn now the reason we are
cultivating<00:00:16.770> rather<00:00:17.039> than<00:00:17.279> second<00:00:17.760> spray<00:00:18.029> is

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
cultivating rather than second spray is

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.990 
cultivating rather than second spray is
because<00:00:18.990> of<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:19.560> price<00:00:19.830> we<00:00:20.550> don't<00:00:20.760> believe

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
because of the price we don't believe

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.170 
because of the price we don't believe
that<00:00:21.300> our<00:00:22.020> ground<00:00:22.410> has<00:00:23.010> really<00:00:23.430> weeds<00:00:23.880> that

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
that our ground has really weeds that

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.480 
that our ground has really weeds that
really<00:00:24.510> justify<00:00:25.039> having<00:00:26.039> to<00:00:26.099> go<00:00:26.160> through<00:00:26.369> and

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
really justify having to go through and

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.700 
really justify having to go through and
spray<00:00:26.730> everything<00:00:26.939> again<00:00:27.359> and<00:00:27.570> that<00:00:28.320> can<00:00:28.470> add

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
spray everything again and that can add

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.980 
spray everything again and that can add
up<00:00:29.070> tremendously<00:00:29.910> we've<00:00:30.539> been<00:00:30.689> doing<00:00:30.900> this

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
up tremendously we've been doing this

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.110 
up tremendously we've been doing this
for<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.289> past<00:00:31.500> few<00:00:31.679> years<00:00:31.740> we<00:00:32.610> took<00:00:32.730> an<00:00:32.940> old

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
for the past few years we took an old

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.840 
for the past few years we took an old
400<00:00:33.690> 40<00:00:34.079> inch<00:00:34.230> cultivator<00:00:34.710> we<00:00:35.309> bought<00:00:35.520> another

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
400 40 inch cultivator we bought another

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.869 
400 40 inch cultivator we bought another
400<00:00:36.239> 40<00:00:36.780> inch<00:00:36.899> cultivator<00:00:37.410> we<00:00:38.100> shrunk<00:00:38.550> one

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
400 40 inch cultivator we shrunk one

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.540 
400 40 inch cultivator we shrunk one
down<00:00:39.120> into<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.050> 30<00:00:40.440> inch<00:00:40.620> cultivator<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:41.399> we

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
down into a 30 inch cultivator and we

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.280 
down into a 30 inch cultivator and we
added<00:00:41.700> on<00:00:41.910> units<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.540> make<00:00:42.660> it<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.870> six<00:00:43.110> year<00:00:43.260> old

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
added on units to make it a six year old

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.369 
added on units to make it a six year old
cultivator<00:00:44.090> we<00:00:45.090> took<00:00:45.210> a<00:00:45.270> tractor<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:45.930> we

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
cultivator we took a tractor and we

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.810 
cultivator we took a tractor and we
spaced<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.860> wheels<00:00:47.070> up<00:00:47.309> we<00:00:47.520> put<00:00:47.730> them

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
spaced the wheels up we put them

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.270 
spaced the wheels up we put them
together<00:00:48.020> close<00:00:49.020> enough<00:00:49.320> that<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:49.620> can<00:00:50.010> run

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
together close enough that you can run

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.189 
together close enough that you can run
right<00:00:50.460> down<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.670> rows<00:00:50.969> without<00:00:51.570> having<00:00:52.079> to

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
right down the rows without having to

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.250 
right down the rows without having to
run<00:00:52.379> over<00:00:52.590> here<00:00:52.649> in<00:00:52.800> corn<00:00:53.100> stocks<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:54.199> now<00:00:55.199> we

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
run over here in corn stocks and now we

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.209 
run over here in corn stocks and now we
cultivate<00:00:56.059> pretty<00:00:57.059> easy<00:00:57.239> right<00:00:57.800> this<00:00:58.800> uses<00:00:59.190> a

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
cultivate pretty easy right this uses a

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.060 
cultivate pretty easy right this uses a
more<00:01:00.059> of<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:00.300> mechanical<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:01.320> physical<00:01:01.350> action

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
more of a mechanical and physical action

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.399 
more of a mechanical and physical action
rather<00:01:02.280> than<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.550> chemical<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.260> we've<00:01:04.260> already

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
rather than a chemical and we've already

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:05.899 
rather than a chemical and we've already
gone<00:01:04.650> through<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.070> spray<00:01:05.280> it<00:01:05.400> once<00:01:05.549> with<00:01:05.850> the

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
gone through and spray it once with the

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.969 
gone through and spray it once with the
half<00:01:06.090> rate<00:01:06.330> of<00:01:06.420> Lou<00:01:06.540> Max<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:07.110> another<00:01:07.470> type<00:01:07.950> of

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
half rate of Lou Max and another type of

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.390 
half rate of Lou Max and another type of
herbicide<00:01:08.310> so<00:01:09.270> therefore<00:01:10.070> everything<00:01:11.070> is

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
herbicide so therefore everything is

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.770 
herbicide so therefore everything is
mostly<00:01:11.670> already<00:01:12.000> dead<00:01:12.180> we<00:01:12.360> just<00:01:12.570> have<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:12.689> few

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
mostly already dead we just have a few

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.510 
mostly already dead we just have a few
seedlings<00:01:13.350> that<00:01:13.439> are<00:01:13.650> still<00:01:13.860> popping<00:01:14.189> up

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
seedlings that are still popping up

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.890 
seedlings that are still popping up
so<00:01:14.909> therefore<00:01:15.270> going<00:01:15.509> through<00:01:15.750> and

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
so therefore going through and

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.899 
so therefore going through and
cultivating<00:01:16.470> will<00:01:16.650> set<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.250> weeds<00:01:17.430> far<00:01:17.700> back

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
cultivating will set the weeds far back

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.670 
cultivating will set the weeds far back
enough<00:01:18.240> that<00:01:18.479> by<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:18.990> time<00:01:19.259> they<00:01:19.439> start

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
enough that by the time they start

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.950 
enough that by the time they start
growing<00:01:19.920> again<00:01:20.009> if<00:01:20.400> they<00:01:20.580> do<00:01:20.640> that<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.750> corn

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
growing again if they do that the corn

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.480 
growing again if they do that the corn
will<00:01:22.049> be<00:01:22.140> tall<00:01:22.350> enough<00:01:22.380> that<00:01:22.860> they<00:01:23.220> won't<00:01:23.369> get

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
will be tall enough that they won't get

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.420 
will be tall enough that they won't get
enough<00:01:23.700> sunlight<00:01:24.140> really<00:01:25.140> do<00:01:25.740> anything<00:01:25.979> so

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
enough sunlight really do anything so

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.520 
enough sunlight really do anything so
anyway<00:01:27.180> I<00:01:27.210> hope<00:01:27.509> you<00:01:27.630> enjoy<00:01:27.869> this<00:01:27.990> video<00:01:28.170> be
