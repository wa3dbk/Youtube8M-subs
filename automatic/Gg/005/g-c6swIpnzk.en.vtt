00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.310
 it's a dream that more than half of 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.200
 French realize become owner 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.360
 from his apartment or house 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.910
 and for those of them who decide to 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.219
 to build a place to live 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.470
 unique and well the trend is no longer to 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.449
 ostentation and no more are turning 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.340
 in addition to to the green house more 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.980
 eco-friendly more 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.840
 energy efficient in a word more 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.590
 malignant reportage in brittany 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.240
 dominique dumas and jean michel millet 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.460
 it looks like a saucer or a 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.680
 giant mushroom but like a sunflower 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.840
 she can follow the course of the sun or 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.450
 stop this round house and 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.489
 handy by simple remote control 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.379
 bretons have already adopted it as this 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.940
 acupuncturist of quarter of the benches which for 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.710
 nothing in the world would return to a 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.200
 traditional house 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.329
 thanks to this sunshine programmed in 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.489
 winter he saves half of his grade 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.780
 heating but I'm from a 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.570
 generation we love science fiction 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.609
 and you watch series like star 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.840
 trek or other and I have the impression 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.329
 to really be in a saucer 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.030
 flying while being on land moors 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.500
 and in pleasant conditions but 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.080
 for his owner this house is not 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.299
 not necessarily a gadget more 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.390
 first quality of life through a 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.909
 natural insulation a large volume and 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.590
 a total absence of partitions to 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.750
 few kilometers near pontivy a 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.479
 other breton opted for another style 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.430
 most Canadian rapper all in wood with 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.240
 modernity forces solar collectors 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.610
 on the roof 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.320
 this house is also ecological 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.570
 built quickly and can integrate 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.280
 in any landscape at prices 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.000
 still reasonable in relation to prices 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.490
 conventional if we get to good I 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.899
 would say frames and their desires and ben on 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.840
 happens to create a house that is in 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.220
 the costs about the maximum I would say 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.409
 15% more expensive than a classic house 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.890
 what if we take that materials 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.110
 natural 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.450
 in the light of all these pioneers of 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.280
 elected officials and architects takes up the challenge to 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.219
 silfiac the mayor wants a subdivision 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.840
 fully ecological more and more 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:04.320
 there are people today that they 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.570
 wish to be able to build from 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.550
 grouped way on a place where he 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.220
 finds a favorable context 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.050
 effectively seal a request dia 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.480
 who advised 20 years on a habitat 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.980
 more respectful of life we talked about 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.220
 staged at the time a house in 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:23.310
 anyway more m today it's a 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.330
 an approach that is expanding that goes well 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.700
 Beyond besides construction 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.770
 individual healthier dwellings 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.150
 like lime chambering to isolate 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.160
 the walls of this Breton farm 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.739
 as many rules for the respect of 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.940
 the environment that could become 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:39.980
 essential to build a 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.980
 simple house or an entire city
