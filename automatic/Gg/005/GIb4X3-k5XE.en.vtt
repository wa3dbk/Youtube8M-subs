00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
my dehydrator trays and it takes about

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.300 
my dehydrator trays and it takes about
if<00:01:19.620> I<00:01:20.160> put<00:01:20.400> them<00:01:20.490> on<00:01:20.640> like<00:01:21.320> maybe<00:01:22.320> four<00:01:23.160> or<00:01:23.190> five

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
plastic here to cover the bottom well

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:29.520 
plastic here to cover the bottom well
that<00:03:27.939> was<00:03:28.120> a<00:03:28.150> good<00:03:28.329> idea<00:03:28.720> but<00:03:28.989> I<00:03:29.079> even<00:03:29.349> have<00:03:29.500> a

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
that was a good idea but I even have a

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.039 
that was a good idea but I even have a
better<00:03:29.769> idea<00:03:29.859> what<00:03:30.400> I<00:03:30.849> do<00:03:30.970> now<00:03:31.269> is<00:03:31.299> I<00:03:31.599> start<00:03:31.959> at

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049 
better idea what I do now is I start at

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:33.750 
better idea what I do now is I start at
this<00:03:32.169> back<00:03:32.410> corner<00:03:32.739> and<00:03:33.010> I<00:03:33.069> cut<00:03:33.310> all<00:03:33.519> the<00:03:33.669> way

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
this back corner and I cut all the way

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.770 
this back corner and I cut all the way
around<00:03:33.879> on<00:03:34.269> three<00:03:34.569> sides<00:03:34.810> so<00:03:35.799> that<00:03:35.980> when<00:03:36.129> I<00:03:36.160> get

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
around on three sides so that when I get

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.900 
around on three sides so that when I get
all<00:03:37.780> the<00:03:38.019> way<00:03:38.109> around<00:03:38.230> I've<00:03:38.680> left<00:03:39.280> it<00:03:39.489> attached

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
all the way around I've left it attached

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:41.789 
all the way around I've left it attached
to<00:03:40.120> the<00:03:40.239> back<00:03:40.389> of<00:03:40.569> to<00:03:40.660> attach<00:03:40.870> at<00:03:41.079> one<00:03:41.230> side<00:03:41.530> and

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799 
to the back of to attach at one side and

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:44.099 
to the back of to attach at one side and
then<00:03:42.340> all<00:03:42.549> I<00:03:42.579> do<00:03:42.790> is<00:03:43.090> just<00:03:43.299> put<00:03:43.510> that<00:03:43.659> over<00:03:43.720> my

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:34.780 
packet of pectin now when I made 12 of

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:36.899 
packet of pectin now when I made 12 of
the<00:06:35.289> half<00:06:35.469> pints<00:06:35.919> here<00:06:36.099> this<00:06:36.310> is<00:06:36.430> actually<00:06:36.550> two

00:06:36.899 --> 00:06:36.909 
the half pints here this is actually two

00:06:36.909 --> 00:06:38.909 
the half pints here this is actually two
batches<00:06:37.270> of<00:06:37.389> jelly<00:06:37.569> because<00:06:37.780> you<00:06:37.990> don't<00:06:38.199> want

00:06:38.909 --> 00:06:38.919 
batches of jelly because you don't want

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:40.980 
batches of jelly because you don't want
to<00:06:39.190> process<00:06:40.060> more<00:06:40.270> than<00:06:40.330> three<00:06:40.659> and<00:06:40.719> a<00:06:40.780> half

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:40.990 
to process more than three and a half

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:44.399

cups<00:06:41.380> of<00:06:41.610> the<00:06:42.610> juice<00:06:42.880> so<00:06:43.270> I<00:06:43.449> made<00:06:43.719> two<00:06:43.990> separate

00:06:44.399 --> 00:06:44.409 
cups of the juice so I made two separate

00:06:44.409 --> 00:06:46.409 
cups of the juice so I made two separate
batches<00:06:44.680> of<00:06:45.069> the<00:06:45.159> jelly<00:06:45.400> here<00:06:45.789> to<00:06:46.000> get<00:06:46.210> the

00:06:46.409 --> 00:06:46.419 
batches of the jelly here to get the

00:06:46.419 --> 00:06:49.469 
batches of the jelly here to get the
dozen<00:06:46.840> so<00:06:47.620> if<00:06:47.949> you<00:06:48.130> wanted<00:06:48.370> to<00:06:48.460> make<00:06:48.610> jelly<00:06:48.940> you

00:06:49.469 --> 00:06:49.479 
dozen so if you wanted to make jelly you

00:06:49.479 --> 00:06:51.790 
dozen so if you wanted to make jelly you
would<00:06:49.599> need<00:06:49.750> to<00:06:49.960> get<00:06:50.110> two<00:06:50.460> packages

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:51.800 
would need to get two packages

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.040 
would need to get two packages
then<00:06:52.039> one<00:06:52.340> package<00:06:52.729> makes<00:06:52.970> six<00:06:53.449> of<00:06:53.659> the<00:06:53.780> jars

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:54.050 
then one package makes six of the jars

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:56.260 
then one package makes six of the jars
and<00:06:54.349> then<00:06:54.979> another<00:06:55.400> package<00:06:55.849> for<00:06:56.060> the<00:06:56.120> other

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:56.270 
and then another package for the other

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:58.779 
and then another package for the other
six<00:06:56.599> but<00:06:57.560> if<00:06:57.650> you<00:06:57.740> just<00:06:58.009> want<00:06:58.280> to<00:06:58.340> make<00:06:58.610> the

00:06:58.779 --> 00:06:58.789 
six but if you just want to make the

00:06:58.789 --> 00:07:01.719 
six but if you just want to make the
syrup<00:06:59.090> all<00:06:59.659> you<00:07:00.259> need<00:07:00.440> is<00:07:00.590> one<00:07:00.830> box<00:07:01.039> for<00:07:01.400> 12

00:07:01.719 --> 00:07:01.729 
syrup all you need is one box for 12

00:07:01.729 --> 00:07:04.629 
syrup all you need is one box for 12
jars<00:07:02.030> okay<00:07:02.629> you<00:07:03.169> would<00:07:03.289> use<00:07:03.409> half<00:07:03.650> a<00:07:03.680> half<00:07:04.520> a

00:07:04.629 --> 00:07:04.639 
jars okay you would use half a half a

00:07:04.639 --> 00:07:08.110 
jars okay you would use half a half a
packet<00:07:05.030> of<00:07:05.090> this<00:07:05.240> pectin<00:07:05.720> in<00:07:05.870> one<00:07:06.789> batch<00:07:07.789> and

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:08.120 
packet of this pectin in one batch and

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:11.649 
packet of this pectin in one batch and
half<00:07:08.270> in<00:07:08.449> the<00:07:08.539> other<00:07:08.710> so<00:07:09.710> anyway<00:07:10.669> just<00:07:10.970> a<00:07:11.479> great

00:07:19.879 --> 00:07:22.450 
trying to store foods for long-term food
storage<00:07:20.090> I<00:07:20.569> like<00:07:21.259> the<00:07:21.470> idea<00:07:21.800> of<00:07:21.860> dehydrating

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:22.460 
storage I like the idea of dehydrating

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:24.909 
storage I like the idea of dehydrating
the<00:07:22.550> pineapple<00:07:23.000> because<00:07:23.300> if<00:07:23.810> I<00:07:23.990> have<00:07:24.289> a<00:07:24.319> can<00:07:24.680> go

00:07:24.909 --> 00:07:24.919 
the pineapple because if I have a can go

00:07:24.919 --> 00:07:26.499 
the pineapple because if I have a can go
bad<00:07:25.129> on<00:07:25.159> my<00:07:25.340> shelf<00:07:25.639> it's<00:07:25.849> going<00:07:26.000> to<00:07:26.060> be<00:07:26.180> a<00:07:26.210> can

00:07:26.499 --> 00:07:26.509 
bad on my shelf it's going to be a can

00:07:26.509 --> 00:07:29.260 
bad on my shelf it's going to be a can
of<00:07:26.629> pineapple<00:07:26.979> mandarin<00:07:27.979> oranges<00:07:28.340> or<00:07:28.580> some

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:29.270 
of pineapple mandarin oranges or some

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:30.760 
of pineapple mandarin oranges or some
kind<00:07:29.509> of<00:07:29.539> tomato<00:07:29.780> product<00:07:30.319> those<00:07:30.530> are<00:07:30.680> the

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:30.770 
kind of tomato product those are the

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:32.379 
kind of tomato product those are the
ones<00:07:30.949> who<00:07:31.129> are<00:07:31.159> most<00:07:31.340> likely<00:07:31.520> to<00:07:31.969> get<00:07:32.060> the<00:07:32.120> seal

00:07:32.379 --> 00:07:32.389 
ones who are most likely to get the seal

00:07:32.389 --> 00:07:34.119 
ones who are most likely to get the seal
compromised<00:07:32.960> and<00:07:33.289> I<00:07:33.620> think<00:07:33.860> it's<00:07:33.979> just

00:07:34.119 --> 00:07:34.129 
compromised and I think it's just

00:07:34.129 --> 00:07:35.860 
compromised and I think it's just
because<00:07:34.280> it's<00:07:34.430> a<00:07:34.610> high<00:07:34.789> acid<00:07:35.000> food<00:07:35.389> so<00:07:35.599> I<00:07:35.659> love

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:35.870 
because it's a high acid food so I love

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:38.950 
because it's a high acid food so I love
the<00:07:35.990> idea<00:07:36.319> of<00:07:36.879> dehydrating<00:07:37.879> the<00:07:37.940> panel<00:07:38.360> I<00:07:38.509> hope

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:38.960 
the idea of dehydrating the panel I hope

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:42.459 
the idea of dehydrating the panel I hope
this<00:07:39.050> gives<00:07:39.229> you<00:07:39.349> some<00:07:39.560> ideas<00:07:39.969> and<00:07:41.469> that
