00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.319
 I would have gone straight to sea but in 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.250
 car it was impossible 

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:39.110
 I'm trying to put it back into the 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:42.170
 port to redo oxygenate is never 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:45.649
 income and went away alone or dead 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:49.220
 all by myself and I'm coming now 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:50.509
 reflective I make a connection between the 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.890
 touches that I had at sea since 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:53.450
 for a few days I 'm losing on 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.000
 the mouth of the purchase of his own 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.909
 in the 40 50 60 meters deep at the 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.340
 exit from the Cicad but as you go 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:02.479
 see in the following video I had the 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.069
 most cities that have been made 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:07.610
 attack then I know that's enough 

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:09.200
 feast that cut continuously and like 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.019
 she was already found a baby shark 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:15.739
 on the beach by a young man I arrive 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:17.420
 I wonder if there would be a 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:19.190
 mom sharks who would have updated 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.870
 babies rockets so at I do not know 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.480
 how long can I not cut myself 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.459
 tanned center in 21 inches while she 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.590
 act there this specimen if there are some 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:30.410
 days or if it has several weeks where we 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.780
 see more about me but I wonder if 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.010
 she will be able to sell marina kaka 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.850
 still high enough it's still 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.840
 brackish water 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:39.049
 they still have to go back 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.359
 siagne simply if the mother would not have 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:44.930
 a bullet if we say like that for them 

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:47.750
 sharks would not be years put to the 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.580
 world sharks in the port of Cannes 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.770
 marina 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:54.130
 in the port next door or in the old 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:56.410
 cian I do not know in any case I'm doing a 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:59.050
 link month now with his attacks 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:01.000
 on the fish I brought back the 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.400
 mackerel that are made to swallow 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.800
 and especially a video that happened 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:11.680
 yesterday still at the exit of the siagne 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:13.660
 anchored in the bottom 50 meters or the 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.780
 mackerel was outright attacked ago 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.970
 had a taste a rather long fish so 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:22.330
 I have not identified as nine lives niet 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:24.670
 a serial nor to rent obviously but 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.890
 actually rather like a predator 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.150
 kind none but I can not the 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.430
 certify because I have not seen or 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.630
 fin nini the back nor anything 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:36.130
 all I saw is a fish 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:37.959
 pretty long rather fun than round and so p 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.910
 I arrive I wonder if there is not a 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:42.670
 link between these little sharks who we are 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:45.430
 and who were born not long ago with 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.350
 these fish attacks that I bring back to 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.760
 line c at least 2 5 or 6 fish 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.730
 who's been attacked for two to three 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:54.840
 days since I'm fishing right now 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.840
 not far from the mouth of the plate 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.470
 this is me I would advise 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.000
 not everyone to bathe at 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.210
 around the siagne even though its 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.530
 career normally but a shark 

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:18.870
 angry I do not know what it can give 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:23.850
 so the authorities they have to take 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:25.290
 their responsibilities here I can not 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.700
 tell you more I do not know more I 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:29.300
 do not know enough about the ring roads I 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:31.710
 know it's a harmless shark of 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.960
 the mediterranean I think I call 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.530
 that's the blue gray there I do not know 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.420
 exactly 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.730
 in any case I can tell you that the 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:41.990
 Mom my opinion she is not far 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:46.320
 Here is what is great fishing 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:48.240

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.740

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:53.390
