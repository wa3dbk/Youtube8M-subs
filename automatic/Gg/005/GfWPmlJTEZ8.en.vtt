ok<00:00:00.930> so<00:00:01.020> there's<00:00:01.410> talk<00:00:01.680> about<00:00:01.890> how<00:00:02.010> to<00:00:02.070> pulse

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340 
ok so there's talk about how to pulse

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:03.740 
ok so there's talk about how to pulse
we've<00:00:02.639> been<00:00:02.790> using<00:00:02.939> it<00:00:03.149> for<00:00:03.179> about<00:00:03.330> two<00:00:03.600> years

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
we've been using it for about two years

your<00:00:06.509> hop<00:00:06.660> to<00:00:06.899> the<00:00:08.330> basics<00:00:09.330> poles<00:00:10.080> you<00:00:10.740> have<00:00:10.889> to

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
your hop to the basics poles you have to

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.490 
your hop to the basics poles you have to
have<00:00:11.099> super<00:00:12.030> clamps<00:00:12.450> which<00:00:12.719> are<00:00:12.900> one<00:00:13.139> for<00:00:13.380> each

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
have super clamps which are one for each

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.099 
have super clamps which are one for each
pole<00:00:13.799> which<00:00:14.759> what<00:00:15.179> the<00:00:15.299> super<00:00:15.599> clamp<00:00:15.839> does

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
pole which what the super clamp does

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.179 
pole which what the super clamp does
this<00:00:16.320> holds<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:17.699> hooks<00:00:17.970> are<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.930> holders<00:00:19.320> for

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
this holds the hooks are the holders for

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.670 
this holds the hooks are the holders for
whatever<00:00:20.460> pulley<00:00:20.760> goeth<00:00:21.289> and<00:00:22.289> I'll<00:00:22.470> show<00:00:22.650> you

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
whatever pulley goeth and I'll show you

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.980 
whatever pulley goeth and I'll show you
that<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:22.980> second<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.400> two<00:00:23.550> poles<00:00:23.760> are<00:00:24.740> the

that the second the two poles are the

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.660 
that the second the two poles are the
aluminum<00:00:27.990> colder<00:00:28.349> pole<00:00:28.590> which<00:00:29.220> if<00:00:29.369> you<00:00:29.460> use

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
aluminum colder pole which if you use

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.999 
aluminum colder pole which if you use
this<00:00:29.910> pull<00:00:30.210> you<00:00:30.810> don't<00:00:31.080> have<00:00:31.170> to<00:00:31.289> get<00:00:31.439> these<00:00:31.650> J

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
this pull you don't have to get these J

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.990 
this pull you don't have to get these J
looks<00:00:33.230> obviously<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.590> hook<00:00:34.739> in<00:00:34.950> that<00:00:35.579> rest<00:00:35.820> in

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
looks obviously the hook in that rest in

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.740 
looks obviously the hook in that rest in
there<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.329> so<00:00:37.969> the<00:00:38.969> thing<00:00:39.180> that<00:00:39.210> we<00:00:39.450> have

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
there and so the thing that we have

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.720 
there and so the thing that we have
problems<00:00:40.020> with<00:00:40.200> is<00:00:40.379> is<00:00:40.559> these<00:00:41.129> poles<00:00:41.430> are

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
problems with is is these poles are

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.720 
problems with is is these poles are
really<00:00:42.180> thick<00:00:42.860> sometimes<00:00:43.860> if<00:00:44.280> you<00:00:44.370> don't<00:00:44.579> have

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
really thick sometimes if you don't have

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.220 
really thick sometimes if you don't have
the<00:00:44.850> right<00:00:44.879> class<00:00:45.270> sure<00:00:45.510> if<00:00:45.690> your<00:00:45.840> clamps<00:00:46.110> are

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
the right class sure if your clamps are

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.020 
the right class sure if your clamps are
smaller<00:00:46.469> they're<00:00:47.160> kind<00:00:47.280> of<00:00:47.399> a<00:00:47.489> pain<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.760> get<00:00:47.850> on

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
smaller they're kind of a pain to get on

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.650 
smaller they're kind of a pain to get on
them<00:00:49.070> the<00:00:50.070> aircon<00:00:50.460> cumbersome<00:00:50.940> you<00:00:51.360> can<00:00:51.510> take

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
them the aircon cumbersome you can take

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.000 
them the aircon cumbersome you can take
them<00:00:51.780> apart<00:00:51.870> but<00:00:52.260> you<00:00:52.350> have<00:00:52.500> to<00:00:52.620> have<00:00:52.739> the

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
them apart but you have to have the

there's<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.400> little<00:01:29.610> slot<00:01:29.850> in<00:01:30.210> there<00:01:30.390> when<00:01:31.380> this

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
there's a little slot in there when this

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.920 
there's a little slot in there when this
is<00:01:31.740> up<00:01:31.920> there<00:01:32.250> in<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:33.000> clamp<00:01:33.799> this<00:01:34.799> hooks<00:01:35.130> and

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
is up there in the clamp this hooks and

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.520 
is up there in the clamp this hooks and
it<00:01:36.930> can't<00:01:37.170> spit<00:01:38.270> so<00:01:39.270> that's<00:01:39.450> kind<00:01:39.689> of<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:40.140> then

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
it can't spit so that's kind of and then

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.240 
it can't spit so that's kind of and then
so<00:01:40.799> it's<00:01:41.490> key<00:01:42.140> use<00:01:43.140> one<00:01:43.409> of<00:01:43.439> two<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.829> methods

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
so it's key use one of two the methods

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.340 
so it's key use one of two the methods
which<00:01:44.399> ever<00:01:44.640> one<00:01:44.899> that's<00:01:45.899> what<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.170> super
