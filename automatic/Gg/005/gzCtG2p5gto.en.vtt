there's<00:00:37.500> silver<00:00:38.160> I<00:00:38.399> guess<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.879> werewolf

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
there's silver I guess the werewolf

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.200 
there's silver I guess the werewolf
curse<00:00:39.719> rubbed<00:00:40.170> off<00:00:40.410> silvers<00:00:41.340> not<00:00:41.579> as<00:00:41.760> common

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
curse rubbed off silvers not as common

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.330 
curse rubbed off silvers not as common
with<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.480> vampire<00:00:42.930> myth<00:00:43.170> but<00:00:43.410> supposedly<00:00:44.010> it

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
with the vampire myth but supposedly it

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.880 
with the vampire myth but supposedly it
still<00:00:44.730> does<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.180> job<00:00:45.390> whether<00:00:45.960> silver<00:00:46.500> bullet

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
still does the job whether silver bullet

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.799 
still does the job whether silver bullet
or<00:00:46.980> anything<00:00:47.370> made<00:00:47.579> of<00:00:47.610> silver<00:00:47.969> so<00:00:48.450> if<00:00:48.570> you<00:00:48.660> can

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
or anything made of silver so if you can

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.389 
or anything made of silver so if you can
stab<00:00:49.079> them<00:00:49.260> with<00:00:49.289> something<00:00:49.620> silver<00:00:50.070> and

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
stab them with something silver and

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.610 
stab them with something silver and
something<00:00:51.090> made<00:00:51.270> of<00:00:51.390> wood<00:00:51.420> then<00:00:52.199> it<00:00:52.469> could

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
something made of wood then it could

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.860 
something made of wood then it could
probably<00:00:52.829> be<00:00:53.190> made<00:00:53.520> of<00:00:53.640> anything<00:00:54.149> I<00:00:54.390> don't

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
probably be made of anything I don't

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.299 
probably be made of anything I don't
know<00:00:54.960> has<00:00:55.110> anyone<00:00:55.410> ever<00:00:55.500> tested<00:00:56.010> anything

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
know has anyone ever tested anything

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.549 
know has anyone ever tested anything
else<00:00:56.489> you<00:00:57.059> can<00:00:57.090> also<00:00:57.360> kill<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:57.809> vampire<00:00:57.899> by

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
else you can also kill a vampire by

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.650 
else you can also kill a vampire by
severing<00:00:59.070> their<00:00:59.280> head<00:00:59.460> now<00:00:59.969> I<00:01:00.030> don't<00:01:00.300> know

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
severing their head now I don't know

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.840 
severing their head now I don't know
anybody<00:01:01.170> that<00:01:01.649> would<00:01:01.770> survive<00:01:02.190> if<00:01:02.520> their<00:01:02.699> head

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
anybody that would survive if their head

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.910 
anybody that would survive if their head
was<00:01:03.059> cut<00:01:03.270> off<00:01:03.300> I<00:01:03.690> guess<00:01:04.080> anything<00:01:04.650> that<00:01:04.799> would

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
was cut off I guess anything that would

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.190 
was cut off I guess anything that would
normally<00:01:05.100> kill<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:05.610> person<00:01:05.850> would<00:01:06.540> also<00:01:06.750> kill<00:01:07.170> a

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
normally kill a person would also kill a

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.490 
normally kill a person would also kill a
vampire<00:01:07.290> in<00:01:08.040> fact<00:01:08.549> in<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:09.119> Dracula<00:01:09.689> novel<00:01:10.200> the
