of look but actually interestingly

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:59.170 
of look but actually interestingly
enough<00:01:52.590> I<00:01:52.979> just<00:01:53.430> did<00:01:53.880> mr.<00:01:54.659> surfacer<00:01:55.759> for<00:01:56.759> the

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.789 

for<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.240> gray<00:02:00.479> and<00:02:00.719> that<00:02:00.780> gave<00:02:01.259> me<00:02:01.290> just<00:02:01.680> the

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
for the gray and that gave me just the

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:02.899 
for the gray and that gave me just the
perfect<00:02:02.040> it's<00:02:02.280> not<00:02:02.430> really<00:02:02.729> that<00:02:02.759> much

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
perfect it's not really that much

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.280 
perfect it's not really that much
different<00:02:03.420> than<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.600> blue<00:02:03.780> gray<00:02:03.930> that<00:02:04.110> comes

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
different than the blue gray that comes

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.590 
different than the blue gray that comes
in<00:02:04.439> it<00:02:04.560> but<00:02:04.710> I<00:02:04.920> like<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.579> color<00:02:05.969> better<00:02:06.270> and

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
in it but I like the color better and

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.589 
in it but I like the color better and

Liam<00:02:09.899> metallic<00:02:10.649> took<00:02:11.489> about<00:02:11.700> a<00:02:11.730> can<00:02:12.000> and<00:02:12.150> a

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
Liam metallic took about a can and a

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.930 
Liam metallic took about a can and a
half<00:02:12.420> to<00:02:12.629> do<00:02:12.750> all<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:13.020> gold<00:02:13.230> piece

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
half to do all the gold piece

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.149 
half to do all the gold piece
but<00:02:15.720> I<00:02:15.989> think<00:02:16.170> it<00:02:16.260> was<00:02:16.379> well<00:02:16.560> worth<00:02:16.709> it<00:02:16.950> you

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:17.159 
but I think it was well worth it you

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:18.770 
but I think it was well worth it you
there's<00:02:17.459> higher<00:02:17.760> you<00:02:18.000> could<00:02:18.209> go<00:02:18.420> over<00:02:18.690> them

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
there's higher you could go over them

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.589 
there's higher you could go over them
with<00:02:18.930> the<00:02:19.019> gloss<00:02:19.310> if<00:02:20.310> you<00:02:20.519> wanted<00:02:20.879> to<00:02:21.120> give<00:02:21.569> a

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
with the gloss if you wanted to give a

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.570 
with the gloss if you wanted to give a

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
you know superfast a dry superfast it

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:58.339 
you know superfast a dry superfast it
looks<00:02:56.760> great<00:02:57.030> but<00:02:57.390> but<00:02:57.780> yeah<00:02:57.959> so<00:02:58.109> that's<00:02:58.260> what

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
looks great but but yeah so that's what

I've<00:02:58.500> done<00:02:59.000> you<00:03:00.000> know<00:03:00.090> as<00:03:00.209> I've<00:03:00.420> done<00:03:00.629> this<00:03:00.690> I

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
was thinking it might have even been

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.949 
was thinking it might have even been
cooler<00:03:02.370> to<00:03:02.609> do<00:03:02.730> them<00:03:02.940> all<00:03:03.060> in<00:03:03.090> like<00:03:03.480> a<00:03:03.510> chrome

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
cooler to do them all in like a chrome

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:07.339 
cooler to do them all in like a chrome
