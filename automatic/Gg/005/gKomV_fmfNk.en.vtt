is<00:04:11.220> I'm<00:04:11.459> going<00:04:11.610> to<00:04:11.670> try<00:04:12.090> the<00:04:12.150> best<00:04:12.660> I<00:04:12.870> can<00:04:12.930> to

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
is I'm going to try the best I can to

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.559 
is I'm going to try the best I can to
not<00:04:14.130> let<00:04:14.459> that<00:04:14.640> fish<00:04:14.910> turn<00:04:15.150> his<00:04:15.300> head<00:04:15.450> and

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:15.569 
not let that fish turn his head and

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:16.880 
not let that fish turn his head and
that's<00:04:15.690> what<00:04:15.810> I'm<00:04:15.900> doing<00:04:16.140> right<00:04:16.169> here<00:04:16.470> is<00:04:16.560> I'm

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:16.890 
that's what I'm doing right here is I'm

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:18.530 
that's what I'm doing right here is I'm
not<00:04:17.100> letting<00:04:17.519> that<00:04:17.549> fish<00:04:17.880> turn<00:04:18.090> his<00:04:18.239> head<00:04:18.390> I'm

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540 
not letting that fish turn his head I'm

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.590 
not letting that fish turn his head I'm
fishing<00:04:18.750> 30<00:04:19.079> pound<00:04:19.380> braid<00:04:20.180> I'm<00:04:21.180> going<00:04:21.390> to<00:04:21.450> lean

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
fishing 30 pound braid I'm going to lean

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.710 
fishing 30 pound braid I'm going to lean
very<00:04:21.630> hard<00:04:22.169> this<00:04:22.350> is<00:04:22.530> a<00:04:22.560> big<00:04:22.830> fish<00:04:23.330> I<00:04:24.330> know

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
very hard this is a big fish I know

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.080 
very hard this is a big fish I know
eventually<00:04:25.260> it's<00:04:25.740> going<00:04:25.830> to<00:04:25.890> take<00:04:26.130> a<00:04:26.160> run<00:04:26.520> but

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
eventually it's going to take a run but

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.780 
eventually it's going to take a run but
if<00:04:27.360> I<00:04:27.780> can<00:04:27.960> get<00:04:28.050> it<00:04:28.200> closer<00:04:28.500> to<00:04:28.680> me<00:04:28.980> and<00:04:29.310> tire<00:04:29.610> it

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:29.790 
if I can get it closer to me and tire it

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:31.070 
if I can get it closer to me and tire it
out<00:04:29.850> a<00:04:29.910> little<00:04:30.060> bit<00:04:30.240> before<00:04:30.540> it<00:04:30.570> takes<00:04:30.840> that

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
out a little bit before it takes that

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.409 
out a little bit before it takes that
run<00:04:31.380> I'm<00:04:32.190> going<00:04:32.610> to<00:04:32.669> be<00:04:32.820> in<00:04:32.940> a<00:04:33.000> better<00:04:33.150> position

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419 
run I'm going to be in a better position

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:36.740 
run I'm going to be in a better position
to<00:04:33.840> land<00:04:33.990> it<00:04:34.250> alright<00:04:35.250> so<00:04:35.430> where<00:04:36.150> am<00:04:36.330> I<00:04:36.450> here<00:04:36.570> on

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750

the North Fork of Long Island normally

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:40.940 
the North Fork of Long Island normally
you<00:04:39.510> would<00:04:39.660> do<00:04:39.780> this<00:04:39.930> fishing<00:04:40.380> at<00:04:40.500> night<00:04:40.530> but

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:40.950 
you would do this fishing at night but

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:42.350 
you would do this fishing at night but
that<00:04:41.100> wouldn't<00:04:41.340> make<00:04:41.460> for<00:04:41.669> very<00:04:41.700> interesting

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
that wouldn't make for very interesting

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.900 
that wouldn't make for very interesting
