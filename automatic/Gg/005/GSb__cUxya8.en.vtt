 verdi and he's not bad on the other hand 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:37.210
 they cost nothing I think its 84th gesture 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:41.050
 4.7 speed technique for a player 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:44.320
 like that and it's cool it's worthless 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:47.590

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.110

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.100
