00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 
first time that I really thought about

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.340 
first time that I really thought about
being<00:01:06.610> a<00:01:06.820> professional<00:01:07.150> snowmobile<00:01:07.930> racer

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:11.229 
was she was back and forth grade to be

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:13.080 
was she was back and forth grade to be
honest<00:01:11.650> and<00:01:11.860> then<00:01:11.979> probably<00:01:12.490> about<00:01:12.610> the<00:01:13.060> time

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
honest and then probably about the time

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.110 
honest and then probably about the time
I<00:01:13.300> was<00:01:13.630> 18<00:01:14.350> I<00:01:14.650> started<00:01:14.710> winning<00:01:15.370> semi-pro

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.010 
like thinking the cow like this is a

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.210 
like thinking the cow like this is a
possibility<00:01:21.790> and<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:23.350> next<00:01:23.680> year<00:01:23.860> players

the coolest thing about the Freestyle is
just<00:02:20.590> coming<00:02:20.800> up<00:02:20.950> with<00:02:21.010> the<00:02:21.250> new<00:02:21.400> tricks

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
just coming up with the new tricks

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.210 
just coming up with the new tricks
trying<00:02:22.420> to<00:02:22.480> figure<00:02:22.810> them<00:02:22.900> out<00:02:23.050> and<00:02:23.410> you<00:02:23.890> start

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
trying to figure them out and you start

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.250 
trying to figure them out and you start
from<00:02:24.430> the<00:02:24.610> bottom<00:02:24.790> and<00:02:25.240> go<00:02:25.300> or<00:02:25.630> it<00:02:25.930> is<00:02:26.050> this

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
from the bottom and go or it is this

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.290 
from the bottom and go or it is this
possible<00:02:26.890> do<00:02:26.980> I<00:02:27.040> think<00:02:27.160> this<00:02:27.490> is<00:02:27.670> realistic

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
possible do I think this is realistic

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.740 
possible do I think this is realistic
you<00:02:29.230> don't<00:02:29.440> well<00:02:29.620> I<00:02:29.980> think<00:02:30.580> so<00:02:30.850> and<00:02:31.060> then<00:02:31.600> you

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
you don't well I think so and then you

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.690 
you don't well I think so and then you
