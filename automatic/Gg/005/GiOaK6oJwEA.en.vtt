let's<00:00:00.930> get<00:00:01.110> into<00:00:01.260> talking<00:00:01.469> about<00:00:01.860> using<00:00:02.280> this

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520 
let's get into talking about using this

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.340 
let's get into talking about using this
really<00:00:02.790> cool<00:00:02.939> software<00:00:03.419> and<00:00:03.959> I'll<00:00:04.080> start

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
really cool software and I'll start

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.030 
really cool software and I'll start
something<00:00:04.740> up<00:00:05.660> alright<00:00:06.660> so<00:00:06.870> I'm<00:00:07.200> going<00:00:07.680> to<00:00:07.830> and

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
something up alright so I'm going to and

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.440 
something up alright so I'm going to and
I'll<00:00:08.370> give<00:00:08.550> you<00:00:08.639> a<00:00:08.670> couple<00:00:08.730> tips<00:00:09.059> along<00:00:09.389> the

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
I'll give you a couple tips along the

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.060 
I'll give you a couple tips along the
way<00:00:09.599> tix<00:00:09.960> when<00:00:10.230> you<00:00:10.320> first<00:00:10.530> open<00:00:10.860> up<00:00:10.950> a<00:00:11.040> new

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
way tix when you first open up a new

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.709 
way tix when you first open up a new
project<00:00:11.730> as<00:00:11.880> you<00:00:12.090> can<00:00:12.210> see<00:00:12.300> you<00:00:12.389> have<00:00:12.480> a<00:00:12.540> lot<00:00:12.690> of

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
project as you can see you have a lot of

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.780 
project as you can see you have a lot of
different<00:00:12.870> options<00:00:13.380> here<00:00:13.469> on<00:00:13.799> scale<00:00:14.580> and

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
different options here on scale and

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.019 
different options here on scale and
ratio<00:00:15.059> and<00:00:15.240> how<00:00:15.330> big<00:00:15.540> the<00:00:15.630> file<00:00:15.809> size<00:00:16.080> is<00:00:16.139> I

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:17.029 
ratio and how big the file size is I

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:21.170 
ratio and how big the file size is I
never<00:00:18.029> ever<00:00:18.300> ever<00:00:19.100> do<00:00:20.100> it<00:00:20.250> for<00:00:20.550> ntsc<00:00:20.910> or<00:00:21.090> pal

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
never ever ever do it for ntsc or pal

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.179 
never ever ever do it for ntsc or pal
because<00:00:21.900> you're<00:00:22.080> exporting<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.830> file<00:00:23.010> size

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
because you're exporting the file size

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.429 
because you're exporting the file size
is<00:00:23.250> too<00:00:23.490> small<00:00:23.519> to<00:00:23.910> use<00:00:24.090> in<00:00:24.330> print<00:00:24.720> I<00:00:24.900> always<00:00:25.320> do

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
is too small to use in print I always do

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:26.960 
is too small to use in print I always do
either<00:00:25.560> film<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:25.920> hi-def<00:00:26.250> so<00:00:26.460> just<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.760> tip

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
either film the hi-def so just the tip

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.910 
either film the hi-def so just the tip
just<00:00:27.240> start<00:00:27.869> with<00:00:27.960> a<00:00:28.019> higher<00:00:28.140> resolution<00:00:28.380> even

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
just start with a higher resolution even

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.910 
just start with a higher resolution even
though<00:00:29.039> it's<00:00:29.189> vector<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.670> way<00:00:29.760> it<00:00:29.880> outputs

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:30.920 
though it's vector the way it outputs

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.990 
though it's vector the way it outputs
just<00:00:31.920> start<00:00:32.160> high<00:00:32.279> def<00:00:32.520> because<00:00:32.759> otherwise

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
just start high def because otherwise

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.940 
just start high def because otherwise
the<00:00:33.510> files<00:00:33.750> are<00:00:33.930> unusable<00:00:34.230> for<00:00:34.410> production

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
the files are unusable for production

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.340 
the files are unusable for production
but<00:00:35.910> everything<00:00:36.239> looks<00:00:36.270> so<00:00:36.660> cool<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.140> clean

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
but everything looks so cool and clean

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.780 
but everything looks so cool and clean
and<00:00:37.500> because<00:00:37.710> it's<00:00:37.860> vector<00:00:38.190> of<00:00:38.340> course<00:00:38.579> you

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
and because it's vector of course you

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.910 
and because it's vector of course you
can<00:00:39.000> scale<00:00:39.329> any<00:00:39.629> element<00:00:40.079> in<00:00:40.230> here<00:00:40.770> and

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
can scale any element in here and

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.670 
can scale any element in here and
nothing<00:00:41.309> ever<00:00:41.550> breaks<00:00:41.730> down<00:00:42.379> all<00:00:43.379> right<00:00:43.500> so

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
nothing ever breaks down all right so

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.060 
nothing ever breaks down all right so
when<00:00:44.190> I<00:00:44.219> get<00:00:44.430> started<00:00:45.559> the<00:00:46.559> first<00:00:46.590> thing<00:00:46.980> I

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
when I get started the first thing I

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.850 
when I get started the first thing I
like<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.309> do<00:00:47.550> is<00:00:47.789> I<00:00:48.090> like<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.300> set<00:00:48.629> up<00:00:48.809> my<00:00:49.050> lair

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
like to do is I like to set up my lair

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.470 
like to do is I like to set up my lair
just<00:00:50.219> like<00:00:50.340> in<00:00:50.489> Photoshop<00:00:51.000> you<00:00:51.149> know<00:00:51.239> you<00:00:51.300> can

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
just like in Photoshop you know you can

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.610 
just like in Photoshop you know you can
have<00:00:51.600> all<00:00:51.690> your<00:00:51.840> different<00:00:52.050> layers<00:00:52.320> here<00:00:52.530> on

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
have all your different layers here on

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.100 
have all your different layers here on
what<00:00:52.739> you're<00:00:52.860> going<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.039> draw<00:00:53.250> on<00:00:53.280> and

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.110 
what you're going to draw on and

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.600 
what you're going to draw on and
although<00:00:55.110> there's<00:00:55.320> an<00:00:55.469> automated<00:00:55.829> process<00:00:55.949> on

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
although there's an automated process on

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.939 
although there's an automated process on
this<00:00:56.850> that<00:00:57.090> I<00:00:57.329> really<00:00:57.629> like<00:00:57.840> it's<00:00:58.530> actually<00:00:58.920> a

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
this that I really like it's actually a

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.459 
this that I really like it's actually a
few<00:00:59.340> things<00:00:59.520> on<00:00:59.820> here<00:01:00.510> I<00:01:00.690> can<00:01:01.109> add<00:01:01.260> as<00:01:01.440> many

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
few things on here I can add as many

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.110 
few things on here I can add as many
layers<00:01:01.829> as<00:01:01.980> I<00:01:02.160> want<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:02.579> generally<00:01:02.879> what<00:01:03.030> I'll

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
layers as I want and generally what I'll

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.719 
layers as I want and generally what I'll
do<00:01:03.329> is<00:01:03.600> I<00:01:04.140> don't<00:01:04.500> like<00:01:04.739> background<00:01:05.400> being<00:01:05.580> my

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
do is I don't like background being my

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.010 
do is I don't like background being my
bottom<00:01:06.060> one<00:01:06.240> I<00:01:06.450> always<00:01:07.200> do<00:01:07.500> thumbnails<00:01:08.840> if<00:01:09.840> I

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
bottom one I always do thumbnails if I

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.670 
bottom one I always do thumbnails if I
could<00:01:10.080> type<00:01:10.650> it<00:01:10.830> right<00:01:11.299> and<00:01:12.299> then<00:01:12.630> on<00:01:12.930> my<00:01:13.080> top<00:01:13.320> I

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
could type it right and then on my top I

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.560 
could type it right and then on my top I
call<00:01:14.189> it<00:01:14.220> ink<00:01:14.549> or<00:01:14.790> you<00:01:14.939> call<00:01:15.119> it<00:01:15.240> whatever<00:01:15.420> you

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
call it ink or you call it whatever you

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.920 
call it ink or you call it whatever you
want<00:01:16.369> then<00:01:17.369> I'll<00:01:17.490> put<00:01:18.000> one<00:01:18.030> of<00:01:18.270> my<00:01:18.299> tone<00:01:18.630> layers

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
want then I'll put one of my tone layers

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.679 
want then I'll put one of my tone layers
and<00:01:19.470> then<00:01:20.310> I<00:01:20.610> have<00:01:20.880> other<00:01:21.090> layers<00:01:21.390> for<00:01:21.600> other

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
and then I have other layers for other

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.499 
and then I have other layers for other
things<00:01:21.960> sometimes<00:01:22.470> I'll<00:01:22.740> put<00:01:22.979> text<00:01:23.549> so<00:01:24.450> I

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
things sometimes I'll put text so I

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.929 
things sometimes I'll put text so I
always<00:01:24.900> keep<00:01:25.020> text<00:01:25.409> on<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.530> separate<00:01:25.890> layer<00:01:26.040> and

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
always keep text on a separate layer and

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.460 
always keep text on a separate layer and
once<00:01:27.210> you<00:01:27.330> figure<00:01:27.630> out<00:01:27.659> what<00:01:27.990> kind<00:01:28.170> of<00:01:28.259> layers

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
once you figure out what kind of layers

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.460 
once you figure out what kind of layers
you<00:01:28.680> want<00:01:30.530> then<00:01:31.530> you<00:01:32.070> can<00:01:32.280> go<00:01:32.520> under<00:01:32.820> layer<00:01:33.030> and

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
you want then you can go under layer and

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.230 
you want then you can go under layer and
set<00:01:34.470> layers<00:01:34.799> as<00:01:35.040> default<00:01:35.460> so<00:01:35.610> every<00:01:35.820> time<00:01:35.850> now

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
set layers as default so every time now

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.420 
set layers as default so every time now
when<00:01:36.780> I<00:01:36.810> go<00:01:36.869> to<00:01:37.020> make<00:01:37.259> a<00:01:37.290> new<00:01:37.590> panel<00:01:37.890> or<00:01:38.130> a<00:01:38.159> new

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
when I go to make a new panel or a new

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.429 
when I go to make a new panel or a new
scene<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:39.630> same<00:01:39.840> layers<00:01:40.079> of<00:01:40.320> their

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
scene the same layers of their

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:41.840 
scene the same layers of their
automatically<00:01:40.920> it's<00:01:41.100> exactly<00:01:41.400> what<00:01:41.579> you<00:01:41.610> want

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
automatically it's exactly what you want
