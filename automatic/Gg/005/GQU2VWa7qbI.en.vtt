for the stream and I find it really

crazy<00:01:13.200> like<00:01:13.500> on<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.770> first<00:01:14.010> day<00:01:14.189> that<00:01:14.220> they

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
crazy like on the first day that they

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.310 
crazy like on the first day that they
get<00:01:14.640> dropped<00:01:14.939> people<00:01:15.600> are<00:01:15.720> paying<00:01:16.020> between

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.770 
think that's absolutely crazy especially
since<00:01:20.820> by<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.030> end<00:01:21.180> of<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.390> week<00:01:21.540> they're

since by the end of the week they're
gonna<00:01:21.869> be<00:01:21.990> worth<00:01:22.140> like<00:01:22.259> 200<00:01:22.710> case<00:01:22.890> you're<00:01:23.250> just

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
gonna be worth like 200 case you're just

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.490 
gonna be worth like 200 case you're just
like<00:01:23.640> paying<00:01:24.270> out<00:01:24.420> Mills<00:01:24.659> that<00:01:24.840> you're<00:01:25.350> going

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
like paying out Mills that you're going

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.570 
like paying out Mills that you're going
to<00:01:25.560> lose<00:01:25.650> all<00:01:25.799> that<00:01:25.920> money<00:01:25.979> at<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.340> end<00:01:26.369> of<00:01:26.520> the

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
to lose all that money at the end of the

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.429 
to lose all that money at the end of the
week<00:01:26.700> it<00:01:27.330> just<00:01:27.360> seems<00:01:27.659> like<00:01:27.780> a<00:01:27.900> crazy<00:01:28.259> amount

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
week it just seems like a crazy amount

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.050 
week it just seems like a crazy amount
of<00:01:28.560> money<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:28.829> spend<00:01:28.860> just<00:01:29.159> so<00:01:29.610> you<00:01:29.670> can<00:01:29.850> see

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
of money to spend just so you can see

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.640 
of money to spend just so you can see
I'm<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.479> first<00:01:30.659> person<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:30.990> have<00:01:31.140> a<00:01:31.170> mask<00:01:31.500> or

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
I'm the first person to have a mask or

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.590 
I'm the first person to have a mask or
whatever<00:01:32.070> and<00:01:32.220> if<00:01:32.939> any<00:01:33.090> of<00:01:33.150> you<00:01:33.270> guys<00:01:33.390> are

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
whatever and if any of you guys are

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.090 
whatever and if any of you guys are
going<00:01:33.720> out<00:01:33.810> there<00:01:33.930> hunting<00:01:34.200> these<00:01:34.380> masks<00:01:34.860> just

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
going out there hunting these masks just

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.740 
going out there hunting these masks just
try<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.310> be<00:01:35.400> logical<00:01:35.850> about<00:01:35.939> it<00:01:36.210> because<00:01:36.540> if

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
try and be logical about it because if

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.090 
try and be logical about it because if
you're<00:01:36.840> spending<00:01:37.170> 10<00:01:37.350> hours<00:01:37.470> trying<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:37.890> find

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
you're spending 10 hours trying to find

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.700 
you're spending 10 hours trying to find
a<00:01:38.400> mask<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:38.880> you<00:01:39.570> eventually<00:01:39.720> get<00:01:40.020> one<00:01:40.229> you

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
a mask and you eventually get one you

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.140 
a mask and you eventually get one you
know<00:01:40.799> that's<00:01:40.950> 10<00:01:41.159> hours<00:01:41.189> you've<00:01:41.549> spent<00:01:41.579> to<00:01:42.030> get

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
know that's 10 hours you've spent to get

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.350 
know that's 10 hours you've spent to get
something<00:01:42.360> worth<00:01:42.689> maybe<00:01:43.020> 500<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.100> 200<00:01:44.460> k<00:01:44.640> which

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
something worth maybe 500 to 200 k which

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.120 
something worth maybe 500 to 200 k which
you<00:01:45.630> probably<00:01:45.840> if<00:01:46.259> you<00:01:46.380> just<00:01:46.619> went<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:46.950> made

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
you probably if you just went and made

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.249 
you probably if you just went and made
money<00:01:47.460> did<00:01:47.700> a<00:01:47.729> money-making<00:01:48.240> method<00:01:48.570> of<00:01:48.720> 200<00:01:49.170> k

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
money did a money-making method of 200 k

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.990 
money did a money-making method of 200 k
and<00:01:49.409> every<00:01:49.590> hundred<00:01:49.950> K<00:01:50.040> never<00:01:50.280> you<00:01:50.729> could<00:01:50.880> have

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
and every hundred K never you could have

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.280 
and every hundred K never you could have
made<00:01:51.119> that<00:01:51.149> and<00:01:51.479> a<00:01:51.509> never<00:01:51.689> and<00:01:51.960> just<00:01:52.110> bought

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
made that and a never and just bought

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.810 
made that and a never and just bought
the<00:01:52.409> mask<00:01:52.619> like<00:01:52.890> try<00:01:53.189> and<00:01:53.310> think<00:01:53.399> of<00:01:53.520> it<00:01:53.670> like

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
the mask like try and think of it like

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.240 
the mask like try and think of it like
efficiently<00:01:54.450> over<00:01:55.170> them<00:01:55.320> when<00:01:55.920> you're<00:01:56.070> going

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
efficiently over them when you're going

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.219 
efficiently over them when you're going
to<00:01:56.340> look<00:01:56.490> at<00:01:56.579> for<00:01:56.670> these<00:01:56.790> masks<00:01:57.210> but<00:01:58.020> if<00:01:58.110> you've

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
to look at for these masks but if you've

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.840 
to look at for these masks but if you've
got<00:01:58.380> a<00:01:58.409> good<00:01:58.560> spawn<00:01:58.860> location<00:01:59.340> or<00:01:59.520> if<00:01:59.670> you're

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
got a good spawn location or if you're

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.190 
got a good spawn location or if you're
really<00:02:00.060> good<00:02:00.149> at<00:02:00.180> hunting<00:02:00.329> them<00:02:00.630> then<00:02:00.810> I'd

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
really good at hunting them then I'd

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.240 
really good at hunting them then I'd
recommend<00:02:01.500> just<00:02:01.740> doing<00:02:01.920> it<00:02:01.979> because<00:02:02.040> it

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
recommend just doing it because it

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.380 
recommend just doing it because it
probably<00:02:02.399> could<00:02:02.670> be<00:02:02.700> quite<00:02:03.000> a<00:02:03.030> good<00:02:03.210> money

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
probably could be quite a good money

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.969 
probably could be quite a good money
making<00:02:03.719> method<00:02:03.990> because<00:02:04.170> people<00:02:04.710> are<00:02:04.799> playing

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
making method because people are playing

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.230 
making method because people are playing
quite<00:02:05.250> a<00:02:05.280> lot<00:02:05.490> for<00:02:05.670> these<00:02:05.759> readers<00:02:06.030> at<00:02:06.180> the

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
quite a lot for these readers at the

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.150 
quite a lot for these readers at the
moment<00:02:06.509> but<00:02:06.960> at<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.439> moment<00:02:07.560> it's<00:02:07.829> not<00:02:07.979> such<00:02:08.129> a

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
moment but at the moment it's not such a

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.919 
moment but at the moment it's not such a
big<00:02:08.340> deal<00:02:08.399> because<00:02:08.700> all<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.209> aims<00:02:09.390> been<00:02:09.660> given

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
big deal because all the aims been given

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.960 
big deal because all the aims been given
out<00:02:10.020> will<00:02:10.560> be<00:02:10.679> given<00:02:10.950> out<00:02:11.039> and<00:02:11.250> future<00:02:11.520> holiday

events and
I guess<00:02:13.740> seasonal<00:02:14.160> events<00:02:14.430> they're<00:02:14.580> all

that<00:03:40.380> required<00:03:40.709> a<00:03:40.770> lot<00:03:40.950> of<00:03:40.980> clicking<00:03:41.250> and<00:03:41.580> a

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
lot of their and movement I guess so the

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:45.650 
lot of their and movement I guess so the
most<00:03:44.640> took<00:03:44.790> me<00:03:44.940> a<00:03:44.970> couple<00:03:45.030> of<00:03:45.270> days<00:03:45.360> to<00:03:45.420> get

most took me a couple of days to get

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:46.729 
most took me a couple of days to get
used<00:03:45.780> to<00:03:45.959> just<00:03:46.020> because<00:03:46.290> I'm<00:03:46.380> not<00:03:46.470> used<00:03:46.680> to

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
used to just because I'm not used to

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:48.440 
used to just because I'm not used to
having<00:03:46.920> my<00:03:47.100> hands<00:03:47.340> so<00:03:47.670> relaxed<00:03:48.120> of<00:03:48.209> the<00:03:48.300> mouse

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
having my hands so relaxed of the mouse

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.270 
having my hands so relaxed of the mouse
and<00:03:48.860> traditionally<00:03:49.860> it's<00:03:49.950> not<00:03:50.070> really<00:03:50.250> a

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
and traditionally it's not really a

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.010 
and traditionally it's not really a
gaming<00:03:50.580> mouse<00:03:50.730> but<00:03:51.060> for<00:03:51.330> so<00:03:51.810> if<00:03:51.900> you're

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:52.020 
gaming mouse but for so if you're

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:53.120 
gaming mouse but for so if you're

playing something like ecology your
battlefield<00:03:53.430> I'd<00:03:54.000> really<00:03:54.180> recommend<00:03:54.360> using<00:03:54.780> a

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
battlefield I'd really recommend using a

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:56.390 
battlefield I'd really recommend using a
gaming<00:03:55.260> mouse<00:03:55.380> but<00:03:55.890> for<00:03:56.010> something<00:03:56.160> like

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
gaming mouse but for something like

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.400 
gaming mouse but for something like
runescape<00:03:56.610> that<00:03:57.120> you<00:03:57.690> know<00:03:57.750> it's<00:03:57.900> absolutely

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
runescape that you know it's absolutely

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:59.930 
runescape that you know it's absolutely
perfect<00:03:58.500> because<00:03:59.220> in<00:03:59.310> this<00:03:59.400> game<00:03:59.489> it's<00:03:59.820> not

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
perfect because in this game it's not

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.400 
perfect because in this game it's not
really<00:04:00.180> about<00:04:00.239> precision<00:04:00.660> clicks<00:04:01.050> it's<00:04:01.260> more

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
really about precision clicks it's more

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:02.990 
really about precision clicks it's more
about<00:04:01.500> just<00:04:01.620> sort<00:04:01.950> of<00:04:01.980> long-term<00:04:02.220> grading<00:04:02.910> out

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
about just sort of long-term grading out

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.880 
about just sort of long-term grading out
with<00:04:03.120> skills<00:04:03.360> so<00:04:04.170> yeah<00:04:04.350> I<00:04:04.500> just<00:04:04.560> thought<00:04:04.770> this

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
with skills so yeah I just thought this

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.380 
with skills so yeah I just thought this
mouse<00:04:05.100> would<00:04:05.280> be<00:04:05.340> kind<00:04:05.760> of<00:04:05.820> perfect<00:04:06.150> for<00:04:06.180> the

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
mouse would be kind of perfect for the

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:07.660 
mouse would be kind of perfect for the
things<00:04:06.660> that<00:04:06.810> was<00:04:06.870> going<00:04:07.020> to<00:04:07.080> be<00:04:07.140> using<00:04:07.290> it<00:04:07.440> for

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
things that was going to be using it for

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:09.440
