00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.320
 hello how about connectic friends to what 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.559
 that we have here at the table 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.900
 evaluation is the engine or the root or macs 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.880
 a phone that claims to have the 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.810
 better battery performance and the reason 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.699
 of what we have today in catch 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.199
 animal in the background is not so much because 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.150
 We like it already at home and it goes part that 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.189
 we love what we are using to see 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.330
 how much battery consumption is actually 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.099
 a phone that has exceeded our 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.949
 own expectations about what is 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.250
 able to do with your 3300 battery 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.930
 milliamperes that gives us a performance 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.030
 pretty amazing with intensive use 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.230
 indeed I give intensive use 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.200
 smartphones and they last me approximately 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.969
 13 14 hours if they are very good with 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.239
 battery movements in this case has 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.910
 lasted at least two days now we have 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.829
 a battery level of 20 percent and 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.620
 his use of battery we have it in four 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.910
 days one hour 50 minutes 40 seconds 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.280
 How the system can see the screen 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.329
 operative i have it wifi turned on a lot 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.760
 time imagine how to do the 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.660
 performance if I did not have wifi 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.750
 even the application to go out to 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.720
 run 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:11.460
 we've given it a lot of use and the phone 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.590
 is working perfectly 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.570
 You can trust that you can leave 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.340
 your house on Friday afternoon and the 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.780
 battery charge after returning you're going to 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.430
 last until Sunday when I return if 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.200
 is that I mess up the weekend so 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.630
 It is not like most phones 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.140
 you have to load there with your little one 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.640
 connection to the battery then there's no 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.000
 need to recharge it for several 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.310
 days 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.440
 additionally good we are going to talk 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.970
 of more specific terms in this 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.850
 amount more or therefore to tell them 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:42.840
 the dimensions these 130 points 7 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.789
 by 68.9 mm thick and most 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.500
 the thickest part that is here 9 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:48.149
 millimeters managed to pack a battery 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.539
 larger than the one the reviewer has 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.979
 original in almost the same body what 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:54.990
 only one that changed in the structure with the 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.670
 only original king is this area that is 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.850
 moments of more load an area the 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.439
 drums 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:04.900
 the screen is 4.3 inches and it gives a 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:07.090
 resolution of 540 x 960 pixels its 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.710
 protection is gorilla glass equal 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.260
 corning 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:13.720
 and well, it's a super amoled 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.010
 capacitive gives us 16 million 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.290
 colors the truth the experience is very 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.080
 good I liked to use it 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.760
 It impresses a little how the 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.960
 finished of many applications despite 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.300
 that does not have a resolution so 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.560
 awesome as they might have something other 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.660
 phones in the market especially in 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.550
 pixel terms not so much in size 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.190
 but in quality then the telephone 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.480
 action very well this part already going to the 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.930
 part storage we have eight 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.940
 gigabytes built-in 1 gb in ram and its 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.430
 processor is a dual core to 1.2 giga 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:45.880
 hertz cortex a9 then we have by 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:49.180
 performance we have enough to get him 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:51.620
 this phone we will not see the version 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:55.660
 from android that includes 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:59.320
 finally comes equipped 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:01.960
 with version 2.3 points 6 gingerbread 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.610
 however there is already the possibility 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.280
 to update the different sandwiches 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:08.980
 that you wish but good factory 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.510
 you will find it with this version and 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.120
 Well here come the other data of 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.620
 its compilation and all then this 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:20.180
 basically what you are going to find 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:21.980
 in your part of the system and on the other hand 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.319
 we have here in the back 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.170
 camera 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:28.239
 8 megapixels and includes its led flash 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:31.450
 jack up to the area the speaker you have the 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:34.370
 possibility to record at 1080p in hd 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:37.069
 then you have there your 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.049
 a good option records 30 frames by 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:41.379
 second of this camera and for the part 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:44.420
 front we have here a 1.3 camera 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:47.599
 megapixel that records at 720 p then 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.010
 well there you have a little bit of what 

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:52.340
 that can be the phone already by the side 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:56.150
 of the weight we have the phone weighs 145 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:59.150
 grams the very light truth very well to 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:01.670
 touch and another key element of this 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:04.220
 phone is your backside which is a 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.019
 kevlar fiber protection that 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.180
 finally they are the parts of the 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:13.459
 tougher materials is used 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:15.470
 much in in harmonies and industries of 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:16.789
 type then we have enough that 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:20.199
 offer otherwise good 

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:22.430
 we already have there your contacts doubts 

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:24.620
 hundreds of widgets that come 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:27.289
 incorporated as part of the version 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.699
 of the motorola system the modification 

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:30.229
 of the truth system works very 

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:32.900
 practice I love that you can have 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:34.370
 access to plays thor basically from 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.480
 any point there is no need to 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:39.930
 look for something type nothing else here 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.490
 you have the search button 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.800
 immediately taking the search engine 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.870
 google you have mounted badger and one of 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.570
 options then you have enough 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:50.460
 options if what you're worried about is 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:52.410
 run out of battery 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.810
 at any time do not think more 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:58.620
 This is the best phone found 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:05:01.139
 at that point I usually charge with a 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:04.349
 small sonny charger and with my 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:06.240
 loaders then I say that too 

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:07.560
 speaks of the type of use that 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.479
 phones with this had no major 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.800
 problem can leave my house get to 

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:12.150
 the time it is and I will have 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.410
 performance how many times has not it 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.660
 past that you stay and maintaining a 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:17.280
 good concert this is not going to leave you 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.569
 abandoned then if what you 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.860
 Worry is exactly the performance 

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:21.630
 battery more than anything else 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.550
 this is the phone you should look for 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.389
 then this is our recommendation 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:27.570
 today 

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:29.550
 I am development this was the hanson of 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:31.860
 motorola race for max is now available 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:36.349
 so then there is nothing left but to go to 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:36.349
 look for it and see you in connection
