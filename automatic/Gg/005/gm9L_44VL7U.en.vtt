about<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.929> mechanical<00:02:10.410> side<00:02:10.619> what<00:02:11.370> should

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
about the mechanical side what should

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.550 
about the mechanical side what should
you<00:02:11.610> look<00:02:11.640> out<00:02:11.940> for<00:02:12.150> mechanical<00:02:12.900> side<00:02:13.080> you

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
you look out for mechanical side you

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.470 
you look out for mechanical side you
know<00:02:13.650> these<00:02:13.800> curves<00:02:14.040> are<00:02:14.130> less<00:02:14.790> robust<00:02:15.240> this

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
know these curves are less robust this

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.870 
know these curves are less robust this
is<00:02:15.600> a<00:02:15.630> 2<00:02:15.930> liter<00:02:16.140> engine<00:02:16.590> and<00:02:16.770> and<00:02:17.430> later<00:02:17.640> these

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
is a 2 liter engine and and later these

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.120 
is a 2 liter engine and and later these
cars<00:02:18.120> you<00:02:18.450> know<00:02:18.570> became<00:02:19.260> you<00:02:19.620> know<00:02:19.709> 3<00:02:19.950> liter

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
cars you know became you know 3 liter

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.640 
cars you know became you know 3 liter
and<00:02:20.310> 3.2<00:02:20.850> liters<00:02:21.180> they<00:02:21.810> were<00:02:21.900> altogether<00:02:22.290> more

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
and 3.2 liters they were altogether more

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.949 
and 3.2 liters they were altogether more
robust<00:02:23.010> engines<00:02:23.430> but<00:02:23.690> for<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:24.750> most<00:02:24.870> part

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
robust engines but for the most part

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.930 
robust engines but for the most part
mechanical<00:02:25.620> parts<00:02:25.920> not<00:02:26.310> hard<00:02:26.550> to<00:02:26.640> come<00:02:26.790> by

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
mechanical parts not hard to come by

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.760 
mechanical parts not hard to come by
really<00:02:27.209> for<00:02:27.360> handy<00:02:27.570> vintage<00:02:27.780> 911<00:02:28.440> it's<00:02:28.620> the

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
really for handy vintage 911 it's the
