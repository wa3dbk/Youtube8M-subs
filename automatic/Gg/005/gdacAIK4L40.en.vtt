got you I think they broke with
convention<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.090> think<00:01:06.270> they<00:01:06.330> try<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.570> be

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
convention I think they try to be

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.690 
convention I think they try to be
creative<00:01:07.260> but<00:01:07.560> I<00:01:07.619> think<00:01:08.010> sometimes<00:01:08.310> you<00:01:08.400> can't

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
creative but I think sometimes you can't

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.390 
creative but I think sometimes you can't
yeah<00:01:09.330> if<00:01:09.420> it's<00:01:09.540> not<00:01:09.720> broke<00:01:09.990> don't<00:01:10.020> fix<00:01:10.320> it<00:01:10.710> but

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
yeah if it's not broke don't fix it but

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:04.580 
aesthetic the steampunk sort of looks

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.620 
aesthetic the steampunk sort of looks
though<00:05:05.000> yeah<00:05:06.490> yeah<00:05:07.490> sure<00:05:07.730> so<00:05:08.060> I<00:05:08.090> can<00:05:08.390> dig<00:05:08.600> that

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:08.630 
though yeah yeah sure so I can dig that

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:10.960 
though yeah yeah sure so I can dig that
I'm<00:05:09.110> not<00:05:09.260> saying<00:05:09.440> it's<00:05:09.680> bad<00:05:09.740> but<00:05:10.250> if<00:05:10.640> you<00:05:10.760> put

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:10.970 
I'm not saying it's bad but if you put

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:12.670 
I'm not saying it's bad but if you put
us<00:05:11.150> in<00:05:11.300> a<00:05:11.360> room<00:05:11.540> I<00:05:11.660> think<00:05:11.870> we'd<00:05:12.050> probably<00:05:12.290> pick

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:12.680 
us in a room I think we'd probably pick

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.290 
us in a room I think we'd probably pick
something<00:05:13.040> a<00:05:13.070> lot<00:05:13.220> of<00:05:13.430> different<00:05:14.000> yeah

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:14.300 
something a lot of different yeah

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:15.760 
something a lot of different yeah
something<00:05:14.720> faster<00:05:15.260> because<00:05:15.470> I<00:05:15.560> think

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:15.770 
something faster because I think

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:17.020 
something faster because I think
something<00:05:16.040> is<00:05:16.130> ten<00:05:16.340> times<00:05:16.490> stronger<00:05:16.820> than

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:17.030 
something is ten times stronger than

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:19.510 
something is ten times stronger than
than<00:05:17.510> me<00:05:17.780> and<00:05:18.470> can<00:05:18.650> move<00:05:18.830> two<00:05:19.070> or<00:05:19.160> three<00:05:19.310> times

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
than me and can move two or three times

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.060 
than me and can move two or three times
as<00:05:19.700> fast<00:05:19.850> and<00:05:20.120> turn<00:05:20.330> invisible<00:05:20.740> would<00:05:21.740> not<00:05:21.920> be

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:22.070 
as fast and turn invisible would not be

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:24.700 
as fast and turn invisible would not be
something<00:05:22.310> I'd<00:05:22.550> want<00:05:22.760> to<00:05:23.060> try<00:05:23.330> so<00:05:23.600> yes<00:05:23.960> but
