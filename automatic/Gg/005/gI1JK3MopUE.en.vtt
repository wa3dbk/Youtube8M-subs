when<00:00:03.420> you<00:00:03.510> apply<00:00:03.810> them<00:00:04.050> they<00:00:04.350> the<00:00:04.890> first<00:00:05.130> leg

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:05.340 
when you apply them they the first leg

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.760 
when you apply them they the first leg
extends<00:00:05.970> and<00:00:06.180> it<00:00:06.270> elevates<00:00:06.510> one<00:00:06.870> inch<00:00:07.050> the

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
extends and it elevates one inch the

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.980 
extends and it elevates one inch the
second<00:00:08.160> leg<00:00:08.310> elevates<00:00:08.820> 18<00:00:09.390> one<00:00:09.810> and

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
second leg elevates 18 one and

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.110 
second leg elevates 18 one and
three-eighths<00:00:10.260> of<00:00:10.440> an<00:00:10.590> inch<00:00:10.680> and<00:00:10.980> so<00:00:11.640> when<00:00:12.000> you

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
three-eighths of an inch and so when you

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.870 
three-eighths of an inch and so when you
and<00:00:12.810> the<00:00:13.290> unit<00:00:13.620> by<00:00:13.800> itself<00:00:14.130> is<00:00:14.340> one<00:00:14.520> quarter<00:00:14.850> of

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
and the unit by itself is one quarter of

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.580 
and the unit by itself is one quarter of
an<00:00:14.970> inch<00:00:15.060> thick<00:00:15.360> so<00:00:16.020> when<00:00:16.170> you<00:00:16.230> put<00:00:16.350> them<00:00:16.470> on

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
an inch thick so when you put them on

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.950 
an inch thick so when you put them on
here<00:00:16.980> you<00:00:17.520> get<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:17.789> incline<00:00:18.240> which<00:00:18.720> raises

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
here you get the incline which raises

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.230 
here you get the incline which raises
the<00:00:19.169> back<00:00:19.439> of<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.710> computer<00:00:19.859> up<00:00:20.339> and<00:00:20.910> help

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
the back of the computer up and help

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.450 
the back of the computer up and help
school<00:00:21.630> and<00:00:22.019> also<00:00:22.439> at<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.619> same<00:00:22.650> time<00:00:23.130> by

school and also at the same time by
raising<00:00:23.669> the<00:00:23.880> back<00:00:24.119> up<00:00:24.359> depending<00:00:25.259> on<00:00:25.380> the

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:25.589 
raising the back up depending on the

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:27.499 
raising the back up depending on the
height<00:00:25.769> will<00:00:26.460> create<00:00:26.789> a<00:00:26.820> better<00:00:27.060> economic

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:27.509
