00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.100 
little pose for you today and show you a
quick<00:01:01.109> circuit<00:01:01.590> that<00:01:02.100> I<00:01:02.399> use<00:01:02.640> one<00:01:03.049> for<00:01:04.049> a

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
quick circuit that I use one for a

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.410 
quick circuit that I use one for a
little<00:01:04.409> power<00:01:04.710> circuit<00:01:05.250> so<00:01:05.760> and<00:01:06.150> added<00:01:06.390> some

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
little power circuit so and added some

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.600 
little power circuit so and added some
plyometric<00:01:07.110> exercises<00:01:07.650> in<00:01:07.979> it<00:01:08.100> so<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.400> volume

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
plyometric exercises in it so the volume

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.609 
plyometric exercises in it so the volume
of<00:01:08.909> those<00:01:09.060> is<00:01:09.270> quite<00:01:09.540> low<00:01:09.810> but<00:01:10.080> then<00:01:10.439> for

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
of those is quite low but then for

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.649 
of those is quite low but then for
active<00:01:10.979> rest<00:01:11.159> i<00:01:11.400> got<00:01:11.549> it<00:01:11.729> in<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:12.119> little<00:01:12.299> core

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
active rest i got it in a little core

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.020 
active rest i got it in a little core
exercise<00:01:13.260> so<00:01:13.650> i'd<00:01:14.100> like<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.369> show<00:01:14.549> that<00:01:14.580> to<00:01:14.790> you

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
exercise so i'd like to show that to you

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.789 
exercise so i'd like to show that to you
this<00:01:15.210> is<00:01:15.390> really<00:01:15.540> going<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.140> be<00:01:16.259> suitable<00:01:16.500> for

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
this is really going to be suitable for

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.219 
this is really going to be suitable for
skaters<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.729> goalies<00:01:18.330> because<00:01:18.900> really<00:01:19.140> is

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
skaters and goalies because really is

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.840 
skaters and goalies because really is
just<00:01:19.320> trying<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.710> work<00:01:19.830> on<00:01:20.100> building<00:01:20.340> leg

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
just trying to work on building leg

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.289 
just trying to work on building leg
power<00:01:21.229> so<00:01:22.229> that<00:01:22.259> you<00:01:22.530> can<00:01:22.680> get<00:01:22.830> better<00:01:23.759> pushing

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
power so that you can get better pushing

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.690 
power so that you can get better pushing
so<00:01:24.540> for<00:01:24.780> goalies<00:01:25.110> you<00:01:25.590> know<00:01:25.740> quicker<00:01:26.040> crease

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
so for goalies you know quicker crease

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.609 
so for goalies you know quicker crease
movements<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.479> for<00:01:27.659> skaters<00:01:27.930> obviously<00:01:28.590> a

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
movements and for skaters obviously a

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.190 
movements and for skaters obviously a
more<00:01:28.829> powerful<00:01:29.009> stride<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:30.030> then<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.900> middle

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
more powerful stride and then the middle

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.890 
more powerful stride and then the middle
exercise<00:01:31.710> is<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:31.950> core<00:01:32.250> exercise<00:01:32.790> which<00:01:33.180> I'm<00:01:33.630> is

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
exercise is a core exercise which I'm is

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.289 
exercise is a core exercise which I'm is
going<00:01:34.110> to<00:01:34.170> help<00:01:34.380> everybody<00:01:35.369> again<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:36.060> do

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
going to help everybody again to do

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
injury so let me just show you what it

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.770 
injury so let me just show you what it
looks<00:01:39.930> like<00:01:40.259> it's<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.710> def<00:01:40.950> jump<00:01:41.570> battle<00:01:42.570> rope

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
looks like it's a def jump battle rope

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.010 
looks like it's a def jump battle rope
and<00:01:43.759> lateral<00:01:44.759> hop<00:01:44.970> and<00:01:45.240> stick<00:01:45.960> here<00:01:46.470> we<00:01:46.530> go

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
and lateral hop and stick here we go

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.389 
and lateral hop and stick here we go
well<00:01:49.020> then<00:01:49.170> thats<00:01:49.380> jumpy<00:01:49.829> will<00:01:49.920> start<00:01:50.220> on<00:01:50.369> a

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
well then thats jumpy will start on a

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.709 
well then thats jumpy will start on a
box<00:01:50.720> if<00:01:51.720> you

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:52.719 
box if you

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:54.940 
box if you
foundation<00:01:53.719> and<00:01:53.810> plant<00:01:54.079> metrics<00:01:54.469> before<00:01:54.860> you

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
foundation and plant metrics before you

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.889 
foundation and plant metrics before you
do<00:01:55.100> the<00:01:55.250> death<00:01:55.430> jump<00:01:55.820> it's<00:01:56.119> kind<00:01:56.479> of<00:01:56.630> one<00:01:56.780> of

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
do the death jump it's kind of one of

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:00.340 
do the death jump it's kind of one of
the<00:01:56.990> end<00:01:57.229> stage<00:01:57.649> biometric<00:01:58.460> exercises<00:01:59.350> and

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
the end stage biometric exercises and

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.440 
the end stage biometric exercises and
also<00:02:00.710> you<00:02:00.770> would<00:02:00.950> starve<00:02:01.700> initially<00:02:02.240> with<00:02:02.420> a

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
also you would starve initially with a

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.469 
also you would starve initially with a
lower<00:02:02.719> level<00:02:03.079> box<00:02:03.500> but<00:02:04.280> I'm<00:02:05.149> just<00:02:05.210> going<00:02:05.450> to

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
lower level box but I'm just going to

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:08.290
