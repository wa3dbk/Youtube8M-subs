I've been meaning to show you and when I

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.310 
I've been meaning to show you and when I
was<00:00:17.250> looking<00:00:17.430> at<00:00:17.699> this<00:00:17.850> next<00:00:18.270> camera<00:00:18.630> as<00:00:18.930> being

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
was looking at this next camera as being

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.029 
was looking at this next camera as being
my<00:00:19.439> main<00:00:19.710> camera<00:00:20.000> the<00:00:21.000> next<00:00:21.270> seven<00:00:21.859> there<00:00:22.859> was

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
my main camera the next seven there was

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.929 
my main camera the next seven there was
a<00:00:23.070> couple<00:00:23.369> of<00:00:23.550> things<00:00:23.930> that<00:00:24.930> I<00:00:24.960> wished<00:00:25.410> it<00:00:25.619> had

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:25.939 
a couple of things that I wished it had

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:29.570 
a couple of things that I wished it had
that<00:00:26.939> it<00:00:27.090> didn't<00:00:27.390> one<00:00:28.349> is<00:00:28.680> real<00:00:29.429> good

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
that it didn't one is real good

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.049 
that it didn't one is real good
bracketing<00:00:30.619> which<00:00:31.619> I<00:00:31.949> haven't<00:00:32.369> had<00:00:32.669> since<00:00:32.910> I

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
bracketing which I haven't had since I

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.840 
bracketing which I haven't had since I
had<00:00:33.210> my<00:00:33.360> D<00:00:33.420> seven<00:00:33.809> hundred<00:00:34.200> ninety<00:00:34.850> seven

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
had my D seven hundred ninety seven

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.900 
had my D seven hundred ninety seven
thousand<00:00:36.450> had<00:00:36.660> bad<00:00:37.200> bracketing<00:00:37.800> was<00:00:38.520> stupid

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
thousand had bad bracketing was stupid

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.310 
thousand had bad bracketing was stupid
and<00:00:40.309> this<00:00:41.309> is<00:00:41.579> even<00:00:42.090> worse<00:00:42.239> for<00:00:42.840> bracketing

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
and this is even worse for bracketing

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.670 
and this is even worse for bracketing
but<00:00:43.710> I've<00:00:44.190> overcome<00:00:44.460> that<00:00:44.789> just<00:00:45.149> by<00:00:45.840> using<00:00:46.469> the

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
but I've overcome that just by using the

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.049 
but I've overcome that just by using the
manual<00:00:46.860> controls<00:00:47.309> which<00:00:47.520> is<00:00:47.640> what<00:00:47.789> I've<00:00:47.879> had

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
manual controls which is what I've had

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.139 
manual controls which is what I've had
to<00:00:48.090> do<00:00:48.329> all<00:00:48.600> along<00:00:49.460> one<00:00:50.460> of<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.640> other<00:00:50.820> things

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
to do all along one of the other things

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.270 
to do all along one of the other things
that<00:00:51.270> I<00:00:51.420> was<00:00:51.600> wishing<00:00:51.840> this<00:00:52.199> would<00:00:52.379> have<00:00:52.590> is<00:00:52.860> an

that I was wishing this would have is an

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.600 
that I was wishing this would have is an
interval<00:00:53.910> intervalometer<00:00:54.750> or<00:00:55.610> time-lapse

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
interval intervalometer or time-lapse

one to thirty minutes he also has a

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.600 
one to thirty minutes he also has a
quick<00:02:00.210> mode<00:02:00.420> which<00:02:00.689> lets<00:02:00.719> you<00:02:01.170> manually<00:02:02.130> set

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
quick mode which lets you manually set

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.399 
quick mode which lets you manually set
the<00:02:02.640> time<00:02:03.000> that<00:02:03.390> you<00:02:03.540> want<00:02:03.689> to<00:02:03.780> do<00:02:03.899> but<00:02:04.229> let's

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
the time that you want to do but let's

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.649 
the time that you want to do but let's
just<00:02:04.560> see<00:02:04.710> how<00:02:04.860> this<00:02:04.890> works<00:02:05.250> so<00:02:05.509> I'm<00:02:06.509> going<00:02:06.630> to

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
just see how this works so I'm going to

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.780 
just see how this works so I'm going to
flip<00:02:06.869> it<00:02:06.960> around<00:02:07.020> here<00:02:09.080> because<00:02:10.080> my<00:02:10.790> infrared

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
flip it around here because my infrared

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.820 
flip it around here because my infrared
port<00:02:12.239> is<00:02:12.360> on<00:02:12.450> the<00:02:12.569> front<00:02:12.750> of<00:02:12.810> the<00:02:12.900> camera

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
port is on the front of the camera

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.650 
port is on the front of the camera
so<00:02:14.460> we<00:02:15.000> flip<00:02:15.390> it<00:02:15.480> on<00:02:15.690> the<00:02:16.410> light<00:02:16.590> turns<00:02:16.890> on<00:02:17.130> and

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
so we flip it on the light turns on and

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.240 
so we flip it on the light turns on and
is<00:02:18.660> a<00:02:18.690> solid<00:02:19.230> blue<00:02:19.350> he's<00:02:19.680> pretty<00:02:20.010> dating

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
is a solid blue he's pretty dating

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.550 
is a solid blue he's pretty dating
bright<00:02:20.400> light<00:02:20.660> reflecting<00:02:21.660> in<00:02:21.720> there<00:02:21.900> and<00:02:22.110> you

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
bright light reflecting in there and you

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.320 
bright light reflecting in there and you
hit<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:22.860> mode<00:02:23.310> button<00:02:23.520> either<00:02:23.880> one<00:02:24.090> two<00:02:24.300> or

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
hit the mode button either one two or

three times depending on how long you

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.620 
three times depending on how long you

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
want to go I'm going to twist the dial

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.060 
want to go I'm going to twist the dial
to<00:02:27.930> five<00:02:28.350> seconds

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
to five seconds

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.830 
to five seconds
I'm<00:02:29.520> going<00:02:29.670> to<00:02:29.760> push<00:02:29.910> the<00:02:30.090> mode<00:02:30.270> button<00:02:30.450> once

I'm going to push the mode button once

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.700 
I'm going to push the mode button once
and<00:02:31.820> you<00:02:32.820> just<00:02:32.850> it'll<00:02:33.810> blink<00:02:34.050> should<00:02:34.470> blink

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
and you just it'll blink should blink

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.340 
and you just it'll blink should blink
repeatedly<00:02:35.550> for<00:02:35.760> five<00:02:35.940> seconds<00:02:36.480> -<00:02:36.600> so<00:02:37.140> you<00:02:37.230> can

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
repeatedly for five seconds - so you can

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.130 
repeatedly for five seconds - so you can
get<00:02:37.470> everything<00:02:37.650> set<00:02:38.100> up<00:02:38.130> get<00:02:38.400> out<00:02:38.550> of<00:02:38.640> the<00:02:38.700> way

and you can see camera going every five
seconds<00:02:49.760> and<00:02:51.350> you<00:02:52.350> can<00:02:52.500> see<00:02:52.650> it's<00:02:52.800> a<00:02:52.890> pretty

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
seconds and you can see it's a pretty

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:59.960 
seconds and you can see it's a pretty

dang strong remelt beam it's not very
fussy<00:03:00.300> on<00:03:00.630> where<00:03:01.080> you<00:03:01.230> put<00:03:01.380> it<00:03:01.530> I<00:03:01.680> don't<00:03:01.980> know

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
fussy on where you put it I don't know

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.410 
fussy on where you put it I don't know
if<00:03:02.130> it<00:03:02.220> work<00:03:02.340> there<00:03:02.550> Oh

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
if it work there Oh

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.380 
if it work there Oh
didn't<00:03:03.750> work<00:03:03.840> there<00:03:05.000> anywhere<00:03:06.000> kind<00:03:06.270> of

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
didn't work there anywhere kind of

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.230 
didn't work there anywhere kind of
relatively<00:03:06.840> close<00:03:07.820> it'll<00:03:08.820> work<00:03:08.940> what<00:03:09.150> I'm

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:09.240 
relatively close it'll work what I'm

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.210 
relatively close it'll work what I'm
actually<00:03:09.450> thinking<00:03:09.750> to<00:03:10.020> do<00:03:10.170> is<00:03:10.800> just<00:03:11.010> get<00:03:11.190> a

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
actually thinking to do is just get a

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.480 
actually thinking to do is just get a
little<00:03:11.400> rubber<00:03:11.520> band<00:03:12.260> or<00:03:13.260> something<00:03:13.680> and<00:03:13.830> set

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490 
little rubber band or something and set

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:16.250 
little rubber band or something and set
it<00:03:14.610> right<00:03:14.640> and<00:03:15.000> strap<00:03:15.390> it<00:03:15.540> to<00:03:15.600> my<00:03:15.720> camera<00:03:16.080> right

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
it right and strap it to my camera right

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.690 
it right and strap it to my camera right
here<00:03:16.620> when<00:03:16.830> I<00:03:16.860> want<00:03:17.100> to<00:03:17.160> shoot<00:03:17.310> with<00:03:17.370> it

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:25.190 

so<00:03:20.700> you<00:03:20.790> can<00:03:21.060> see<00:03:23.030> that's<00:03:24.030> that<00:03:24.239> pretty<00:03:24.810> simple

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
so you can see that's that pretty simple

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.530 
so you can see that's that pretty simple
and<00:03:25.290> that's<00:03:25.410> all<00:03:25.560> I've<00:03:26.310> really<00:03:26.370> ever<00:03:26.880> wanted

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
and that's all I've really ever wanted

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.620 
and that's all I've really ever wanted
in<00:03:27.750> a<00:03:27.959> time<00:03:28.170> lapse<00:03:28.440> controller<00:03:28.980> is<00:03:29.390> some<00:03:30.390> easy

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
in a time lapse controller is some easy

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.470 
in a time lapse controller is some easy
way<00:03:31.160> to<00:03:32.160> make<00:03:32.280> it<00:03:32.430> repeat<00:03:32.730> the<00:03:32.910> problem<00:03:33.120> I<00:03:33.330> had

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
way to make it repeat the problem I had

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.050 
way to make it repeat the problem I had
with<00:03:33.630> my<00:03:33.750> d7000<00:03:34.709> I<00:03:34.830> almost<00:03:35.130> never<00:03:35.520> use<00:03:35.820> the

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
with my d7000 I almost never use the

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.090 
with my d7000 I almost never use the
internal<00:03:36.480> intervalometer<00:03:37.350> except<00:03:37.920> for

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
internal intervalometer except for

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.500 
internal intervalometer except for
taking<00:03:38.370> group<00:03:38.520> pictures<00:03:39.440> because<00:03:41.209> 999<00:03:42.209> shots

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
taking group pictures because 999 shots

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.330 
taking group pictures because 999 shots
for<00:03:42.840> most<00:03:42.989> of<00:03:43.170> the<00:03:43.230> time-lapse<00:03:43.590> videos<00:03:44.070> I<00:03:44.250> was

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
for most of the time-lapse videos I was

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.850 
for most of the time-lapse videos I was
doing<00:03:44.760> was<00:03:45.090> just<00:03:45.330> not<00:03:45.510> enough<00:03:45.810> frames<00:03:46.500> I

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
doing was just not enough frames I

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.260 
doing was just not enough frames I
needed<00:03:47.790> to<00:03:48.030> go<00:03:48.120> for<00:03:48.300> farther<00:03:48.570> than<00:03:48.780> that<00:03:50.270> one

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:51.270 
needed to go for farther than that one

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:52.490 
needed to go for farther than that one
thing<00:03:51.480> you're<00:03:51.630> going<00:03:51.720> to<00:03:51.780> have<00:03:51.959> an<00:03:52.050> issue<00:03:52.170> with

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
thing you're going to have an issue with

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.620 
thing you're going to have an issue with
with<00:03:53.250> the<00:03:53.370> next<00:03:53.670> camera<00:03:53.880> I<00:03:54.030> haven't<00:03:54.450> actually

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
with the next camera I haven't actually

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.720 
with the next camera I haven't actually
gotten<00:03:55.470> through<00:03:55.680> this<00:03:55.860> yet<00:03:56.100> to<00:03:56.280> make<00:03:56.430> a<00:03:56.459> time

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
gotten through this yet to make a time

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.310 
gotten through this yet to make a time
lapse<00:03:58.190> but<00:03:59.190> that's<00:03:59.400> the<00:03:59.670> battery<00:04:00.150> power<00:04:00.510> it's

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320 
lapse but that's the battery power it's

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.170 
lapse but that's the battery power it's
a<00:04:01.410> little<00:04:01.680> camera<00:04:02.070> it's<00:04:02.459> a<00:04:02.550> little<00:04:02.820> battery

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
a little camera it's a little battery

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.590 
a little camera it's a little battery
and<00:04:03.420> it's<00:04:03.540> using<00:04:03.720> a<00:04:03.840> lot<00:04:03.900> of<00:04:04.050> power<00:04:05.540> I'm<00:04:06.540> going

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
and it's using a lot of power I'm going

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.800 
and it's using a lot of power I'm going
to<00:04:06.930> try<00:04:07.560> this<00:04:07.620> by<00:04:08.070> turning<00:04:08.130> the<00:04:08.610> screen<00:04:08.850> off<00:04:09.060> or

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
to try this by turning the screen off or

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:16.240 
to try this by turning the screen off or
turning<00:04:10.410> the<00:04:10.440> screen<00:04:10.709> as<00:04:10.920> dark<00:04:11.190> as<00:04:11.310> I<00:04:11.430> can<00:04:12.560> but

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.710 

we'll<00:04:17.250> have<00:04:17.370> to<00:04:17.430> see<00:04:17.580> how<00:04:17.910> many<00:04:17.970> frames<00:04:18.359> we<00:04:18.540> get

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
we'll have to see how many frames we get

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.930 
we'll have to see how many frames we get
out<00:04:18.870> of<00:04:18.900> a<00:04:19.049> battery<00:04:19.380> charge<00:04:19.680> in<00:04:19.950> in<00:04:20.549> the<00:04:20.730> real

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
out of a battery charge in in the real

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.250 
out of a battery charge in in the real
world<00:04:21.440> you<00:04:22.440> can<00:04:22.650> get<00:04:22.860> the<00:04:23.570> AC<00:04:24.570> power<00:04:25.020> adapter

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
world you can get the AC power adapter

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.440 
world you can get the AC power adapter
which<00:04:25.770> I<00:04:25.919> think<00:04:26.130> I<00:04:26.220> will<00:04:26.250> do

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
which I think I will do

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.800 
which I think I will do
for<00:04:27.690> making<00:04:27.870> time-lapse<00:04:28.440> movies<00:04:29.420> -<00:04:30.420> one<00:04:30.540> extra

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
for making time-lapse movies - one extra

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.680 
for making time-lapse movies - one extra
thing<00:04:30.840> you<00:04:31.470> have<00:04:31.620> to<00:04:31.770> deal<00:04:31.920> with<00:04:31.950> but<00:04:32.450> -<00:04:33.450> that

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
thing you have to deal with but - that

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.570 
thing you have to deal with but - that
or<00:04:33.870> a<00:04:33.900> battery<00:04:34.380> grip<00:04:34.740> would<00:04:34.920> probably<00:04:35.280> get<00:04:35.430> you

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
or a battery grip would probably get you

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.240 
or a battery grip would probably get you
enough<00:04:35.960> control<00:04:36.960> the<00:04:37.080> one<00:04:37.230> thing<00:04:37.410> is<00:04:37.590> I<00:04:37.830> don't

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
enough control the one thing is I don't

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:39.590 
enough control the one thing is I don't
know<00:04:38.490> of<00:04:38.580> any<00:04:38.700> better<00:04:38.910> Europe's<00:04:39.240> made<00:04:39.420> for

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
know of any better Europe's made for

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.560 
know of any better Europe's made for
this<00:04:39.690> yet<00:04:39.930> I've<00:04:40.140> seen<00:04:40.470> a<00:04:40.500> few<00:04:40.800> on<00:04:41.540> the<00:04:42.540> market

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
this yet I've seen a few on the market

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.010 
this yet I've seen a few on the market
that<00:04:43.170> should<00:04:43.620> be<00:04:43.770> coming<00:04:44.070> shortly<00:04:44.100> but<00:04:45.020> anyway

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
that should be coming shortly but anyway

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.270 
that should be coming shortly but anyway
I<00:04:46.080> think<00:04:46.200> if<00:04:46.350> I<00:04:46.410> lock<00:04:46.590> the<00:04:46.740> focus<00:04:47.070> down<00:04:47.280> and

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
I think if I lock the focus down and

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.560 
I think if I lock the focus down and
turn<00:04:50.280> the<00:04:50.430> screen<00:04:50.730> brightness<00:04:51.000> down<00:04:51.330> we

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 
turn the screen brightness down we

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.600 
turn the screen brightness down we
should<00:04:51.600> get<00:04:52.310> probably<00:04:53.310> a<00:04:53.340> couple<00:04:53.490> hundred

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
should get probably a couple hundred

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:58.700 
should get probably a couple hundred
more<00:04:53.970> shots<00:04:54.680> out<00:04:55.680> of<00:04:55.740> that<00:04:56.780> and<00:04:57.780> then<00:04:58.500> to<00:04:58.590> turn

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
more shots out of that and then to turn

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.770 
more shots out of that and then to turn
it<00:04:58.860> off<00:04:58.980> you<00:04:59.130> just<00:04:59.160> turn<00:04:59.820> it<00:04:59.970> off<00:05:00.090> so<00:05:00.420> if<00:05:00.480> we<00:05:00.600> set

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
it off you just turn it off so if we set

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:05.450 
it off you just turn it off so if we set
our<00:05:00.930> our<00:05:01.920> focus<00:05:02.610> and<00:05:03.000> our<00:05:03.120> exposure<00:05:03.540> lock<00:05:04.460> well

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 
our our focus and our exposure lock well

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.040 
our our focus and our exposure lock well
I'm<00:05:05.610> in<00:05:05.730> manual<00:05:06.090> so<00:05:06.240> I<00:05:06.270> guess<00:05:06.480> it's<00:05:06.660> locked<00:05:06.840> by

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050 
I'm in manual so I guess it's locked by

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:12.560 
I'm in manual so I guess it's locked by
default<00:05:07.440> and<00:05:07.680> then<00:05:10.040> I<00:05:11.240> think<00:05:12.240> it's<00:05:12.390> into

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:12.570 
default and then I think it's into

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:16.670 
default and then I think it's into
playback<00:05:14.960> see<00:05:15.960> there<00:05:16.110> in<00:05:16.200> playback<00:05:16.530> your

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:26.930 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:29.230 

I<00:05:27.020> turned<00:05:27.800> an<00:05:27.889> auto<00:05:28.009> review<00:05:28.430> off<00:05:28.610> so<00:05:28.970> that'll

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:29.240 
I turned an auto review off so that'll

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:37.770 
I turned an auto review off so that'll
help<00:05:31.150> and<00:05:32.680> then<00:05:35.530> just<00:05:36.530> pop<00:05:36.770> down<00:05:36.800> to
