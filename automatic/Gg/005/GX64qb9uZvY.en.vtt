00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:25.400
 xd 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:27.470
 before starting let me tell you that 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.960
 the games are not better accommodated 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.669
 at worst they are arbitrarily placed 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.070
 also the links of the games are the 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:36.379
 I will leave in the description now if 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.870
 little bitches let's start at number one 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:40.760
 one this bus try see bus driver is not a 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.800
 simple driving game is a 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.750
 authentic driver simulator 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.789
 bus in which you must meet the 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.829
 schedules and at the same time get that 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:52.129
 your passengers feel comfortable inside 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:54.980
 of the bus you will choose between different 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:57.079
 missions and different buses uses 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.420
 the route to reach your destination leads to 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:01.760
 the passengers to the places and especially 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.350
 Respect all traffic signals and 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.080
 puts the blinker at the time of 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.140
 change lanes be careful because if 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.540
 you brake too much 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.140
 and its passengers could complain about 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.080
 bus driver ie bus you 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.920
 driver offers you a graphic section 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.409
 outstanding and very different 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.690
 depending on the mission if that 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.610
 we add that they have been digitized 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.619
 authentic motor sounds 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.570
 intermittent and so on we will discover that 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.840
 buzz driver is the first great simulator 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.300
 of buses at number 2 this 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.860
 mtb what mountain bike means is 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.810
 a game in the first person where 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.060
 you will need great skill and 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.979
 quick reflexes to run and perform 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.990
 incredible tricks in environments 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.789
 varied descent and over the barriers 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.710
 natural and artificial I in what 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:48.539
 I see good references in particular 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.700
 this game and I recommend them because 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:53.280
 When you feel bored this game you 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.830
 will have the most fun in the post 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.810
 number 3 is slender is a game of 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.119
 terror which I challenge you to play alone 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.729
 in the early morning I did not have the balls of 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.710
 do it but you should play 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.539
 consists of collecting 8 pages in a 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.420
 forest at night while randomly 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:11.760
 appears slender man in the case of 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.030
 to find out what the only solution is to 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.370
 run away since we do not have any gun 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.319
 the truth slender is not an uncle that 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.630
 I scared a lot but the impression of 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.880
 suddenly find it is very good you 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.700

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:37.580
 biggest cities in the world employing 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.350
 landscapes like those of san francisco or 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.840
 berlin and monuments like empire state 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:44.060
 building or the 'big ben' to give it a

 number five is plants versus zombies 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.420
 it's a fun casual game that 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.270
 faces two very different species 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:22.070
 vegetables and undead ' in a 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:25.280
 no quarter that develops in your 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:27.500
 garden without doubt the proposal of plants 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.690
 versus zombies is something out of the ordinary 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.970
 a horde of undead has decided 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:34.400

 divers dancers although in plants 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.440
 versus zombies sends the strategy every 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:47.570
 few levels you will have to face 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.430
 minigames of another type like throwing 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:52.130
 nuts against the zombies as if from 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:54.470
 Bowling balls will treat these and others 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:56.720
 challenges that provide points according to 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.580
 your degree of success with which you can 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.830
 buy new types of plants or 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:02.840

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:11.960
 they shoot nuts that waste time 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.790
 to your enemies mushrooms and daisies that 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:15.830
 they make voice points that serve as 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.709
 currency to plant new allies and

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.910
 new features 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.729
 were added to improve the version 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:33.680
 previous the league club championship was 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:36.169
 introduced with the ability to play 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.090

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:45.050
 cinematic to the best television style 

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:47.180
 at the start between times and end of 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:49.220
 each match and with the most comments 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:51.139
 interactive and varied with the 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:53.240
 interesting ability to talk about 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:55.850
 punctual players or decisive moments 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.979
 of their careers the premiere of their 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:00.080

 with the filigree game situation 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:06.889
 included if you are a soccer lover 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:09.199
 I recommend since you could mark some 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:11.599
 nice goals and entertain you a good time 

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:14.030

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:18.710
 of trucks that will take you to carry 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:20.660
 merchandise throughout europe you start with 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:23.150
 the purchase of a truck and the choice of 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:25.070
 your country from there euro truck 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:27.320

 furniture fruits or household appliances to 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.909
 cities like barcelona paris or madrid 

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:33.440
 respect traffic rules if you do not 

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:35.750
 you want to be fined 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.670
 rest full the tank of your truck 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:38.900
 or take care of the integrity of the truck for 

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:41.510
 that you do not have to go to the workshop 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:43.580
 quickly euro truck simulator is 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:45.530
 simple to operate but the truck is 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:47.330
 controls much better from a view 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:50.420
 external than from the cockpit view 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:53.480
 something not logical in a simulator in the 

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:55.010
 position number 8 is street fighter the 

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:57.290

 competes in a series of matches one to 

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:00.800
 one against a succession of 

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:03.500
 adversaries controlled by the computer 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:05.660
 or in a fight against another player each 

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:07.430
 confrontation is a series of rounds in 

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:10.430
 which the player must defeat his 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:12.590
 adversary in less than 30 seconds if a 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:13.520
 combat ends before a fighter 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:15.260
 is eliminated 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.210
 then the fighter with the greatest 

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:19.550
 amount of remaining energy will be 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:21.650
 declared winner of the round the player 

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:23.570

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:25.970
 defeat your adversary and advance to the 

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:28.040
 next battle if the third round 

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:29.510
 finish in a tie then the 

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:31.790
 computer controlled adversary 

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:34.400
 will win by default or both 

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:36.440
 players will lose during the mode for 

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:38.210
 a single player the player can 

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:40.009
 continue after losing and fighting 

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:43.219
 against the adversary before whom 

00:06:40.009 --> 00:06:45.349
 in combat in the same way a second 

00:06:43.219 --> 00:06:47.059
 player can interrupt a match of 

00:06:45.349 --> 00:06:49.909
 a single player and a challenge to the other 

00:06:47.059 --> 00:06:53.779

 Pacific ocean in different missions 

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:07.879
 as in later deliveries in 

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:10.099

 develops in a distant future where the 

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:28.460
 human being faces a race 

00:07:25.759 --> 00:07:30.529

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:32.180
 the appearance of a concentric object 

00:07:30.529 --> 00:07:35.419
 called to what hides a terrible 

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:37.789

 you will have the simple things to go 

00:07:56.199 --> 00:08:01.330
 surpassing the missions for example already in 

00:07:59.139 --> 00:08:03.400
 the first phase should leave your ship 

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:06.099
 very complicated task because the outside 

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:08.319
 is full of enemies like that from the 

00:08:06.099 --> 00:08:11.319
 first bars in hey what will you live 

00:08:08.319 --> 00:08:13.180
 moments of pure action if you liked the 

00:08:11.319 --> 00:08:15.190
 video please dale I like that 

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:17.349

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:21.090
