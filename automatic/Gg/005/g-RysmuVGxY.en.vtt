 Hello and also welcome Livio that Apple iPod Nano 6g 

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:08.160
 first time it will be spelling from 12 to here a quick guide and an apple 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.810
 Sticker that lowers the most important thing because no one draws their description where 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.859
 everything is important trends 

00:00:14.859 --> 00:00:18.449
 and still instructions short instructions infinitely many languages 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.159
 But that is just aside which are unimportant now to the most important part 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:28.810
 namely the iPod Nano 6g the top of the button he indicates and then come into the 

00:00:28.809 --> 00:00:32.700
 dry suffer for the first time and find it right it looks just like 

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:36.469
 on the iPod Touch just draw with a small screen and fit there flair 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.470
 In the viewed one can simply open something by simple click 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.740
 and found here they just clicked on, now in wait Brakel 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.920
 and its louder or softer 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.270
 and you can get into the gate again in the storm this also from our readers 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.010
 Of course you can also take photos 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.930
 currently show 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.030
 Just picture Susann Fromm as before 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.150
 In addition, they had the opportunity to plug in different categories 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.360
 that you find your music easier 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.970
 it does not give away spokesman 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.260
 another nice option to the city of Zealand 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.060
 The reason for this is developed states companies are not counted among them 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.500
 I hope a little bit now 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.320
 Alois possible shaken possible even if that is not all without 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.460
 tripled 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.460
 For Sammer has no answers can seriously reboot 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.280
 now remembers the offer 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.760
 So nothing special just his logo 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.760
 also a nice feature is the race just ten days ago so easy 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.390
 shows the side-front endeavor of some families of all 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.510
 View directions is simply answers 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.820
 In the example you can also see that the iPod and the procures 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.890
 On the back you have a climbing tower an iPod simply engaged 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.430
 Bag Pozzo where they make everything pocket program really 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.420
 and he does not take much space 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.590
 The program also can now make iPod Touch easy for partners 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.299
 keep pushing and freeing up other religious and secular ones 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:04.490
 can individually touch everything as you would like to have it 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.310
 a conclusion of the interrogation is very compact you can take anywhere 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.979
 without the placet 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.339
 but for the price is still quite expensive 

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:14.899
 that was the radio sent smart next time
