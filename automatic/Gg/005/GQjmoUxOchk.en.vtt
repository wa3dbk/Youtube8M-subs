it's going to suffice for straight out
of<00:04:04.280> the<00:04:04.459> box<00:04:04.669> there<00:04:05.120> we<00:04:05.239> go<00:04:05.359> standard

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
of the box there we go standard

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.939 
of the box there we go standard
earphones<00:04:06.379> we<00:04:06.590> get<00:04:06.739> a<00:04:07.299> click<00:04:08.299> a<00:04:08.329> button<00:04:08.509> there

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:08.949 
earphones we get a click a button there

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:11.499 
earphones we get a click a button there
with<00:04:09.949> a<00:04:09.979> microphone<00:04:10.729> and<00:04:10.909> then<00:04:11.060> of<00:04:11.150> course<00:04:11.359> we

00:04:11.499 --> 00:04:11.509 
with a microphone and then of course we

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:14.409 
with a microphone and then of course we
get<00:04:11.629> the<00:04:12.250> 3.5<00:04:13.250> millimeter<00:04:13.430> headphone<00:04:13.909> jack<00:04:14.299> we

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:14.419 
get the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack we

00:04:14.419 --> 00:04:16.449 
get the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack we
get<00:04:14.509> a<00:04:14.569> flat<00:04:14.810> cable<00:04:15.229> on<00:04:15.290> these<00:04:15.500> so<00:04:15.799> enough

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 
get a flat cable on these so enough

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.180 
get a flat cable on these so enough
about<00:04:16.549> that<00:04:16.969> we<00:04:17.659> also<00:04:17.810> get<00:04:18.199> I<00:04:18.500> think<00:04:18.979> our

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
about that we also get I think our

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:23.249 
about that we also get I think our
should<00:04:19.609> I<00:04:19.669> believe<00:04:19.849> this<00:04:20.239> is<00:04:20.479> the<00:04:21.070> data<00:04:22.070> cable

00:04:23.249 --> 00:04:23.259 
should I believe this is the data cable

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:27.959 
should I believe this is the data cable
there<00:04:24.259> we<00:04:24.380> go<00:04:24.969> so<00:04:25.969> it<00:04:26.240> is<00:04:26.389> a<00:04:26.570> micro<00:04:27.289> USB

00:04:27.959 --> 00:04:27.969 
there we go so it is a micro USB

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:31.750 
there we go so it is a micro USB
connection<00:04:28.969> there<00:04:29.630> we<00:04:29.779> go<00:04:29.930> as<00:04:30.159> a<00:04:31.159> normal<00:04:31.639> a

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
connection there we go as a normal a

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.339 
connection there we go as a normal a
type<00:04:32.240> connection<00:04:32.810> there<00:04:32.960> to<00:04:33.080> go<00:04:33.169> in<00:04:33.229> your

00:04:33.339 --> 00:04:33.349 
type connection there to go in your

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:34.360 
type connection there to go in your
computer

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
computer

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.540 
computer
and<00:04:34.940> then<00:04:35.090> we<00:04:35.210> also<00:04:35.360> have<00:04:36.220> which<00:04:37.220> is<00:04:37.370> already

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550 
and then we also have which is already

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.570 
and then we also have which is already
together<00:04:38.150> which<00:04:38.479> is<00:04:38.510> rather<00:04:38.870> unique<00:04:39.580> the
