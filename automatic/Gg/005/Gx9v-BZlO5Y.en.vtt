originally<00:02:01.070> this<00:02:01.220> is<00:02:01.369> an<00:02:01.460> advance<00:02:01.789> to<00:02:02.060> do<00:02:02.179> so

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
originally this is an advance to do so

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.899 
originally this is an advance to do so
they<00:02:02.450> should<00:02:02.869> come<00:02:03.110> up<00:02:03.170> with<00:02:03.350> with<00:02:04.159> really<00:02:04.610> the

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
they should come up with with really the

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:07.419 
they should come up with with really the
the<00:02:05.270> most<00:02:05.659> advanced<00:02:06.229> ideas<00:02:06.619> after<00:02:06.830> all<00:02:07.130> so

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:07.429 
the most advanced ideas after all so

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:09.880 
the most advanced ideas after all so
they<00:02:07.640> have<00:02:07.940> to<00:02:08.209> look<00:02:08.420> something<00:02:09.229> like<00:02:09.380> 10<00:02:09.860> to

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
they have to look something like 10 to

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:11.860 
they have to look something like 10 to
20<00:02:10.280> years<00:02:10.310> into<00:02:10.819> the<00:02:10.940> future<00:02:10.970> and<00:02:11.630> this

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
20 years into the future and this

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.580 
20 years into the future and this
reflects<00:02:12.500> us<00:02:13.600> pretty<00:02:14.600> much<00:02:14.810> what<00:02:15.080> what<00:02:15.410> we're

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
reflects us pretty much what what we're
