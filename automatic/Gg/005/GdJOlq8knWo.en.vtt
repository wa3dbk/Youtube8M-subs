00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 hello everyone and nice that you watch 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:06.720
 to a new video from me 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:09.420
 I am ramon and this is floor surÃ© 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.580
 delonghi desk and this is by the way part 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.809
 2 so if you have not yet seen part 1 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.630
 check the link in the 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.520
 description quickly within the link 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.560
 do you understand the link because I am going 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.050
 of course have about the game euro 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.400
 Link also mind such bad jokes 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.410
 I really don't have to make it in this video 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.000
 that is very much a link 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.109
 ok now I have to cut this is really going 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.340
 just too far 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.579
 at least we're going to have it 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.559
 about the game hero link and link that knows 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.809
 everyone of course at least in it 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.570
 First, everyone would think that 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.700
 he rarely is called the flash game whatsoever 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.219
 after a character that is not at all it 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.289
 Controllable character is just in everyone 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.690
 case he is of course just called 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.460
 link and the first time that link for 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.210
 came in a game was in a game that 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:58.859
 was released in 1986 and that is the 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:01.079
 legend of zelda and he is from 1986 to 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.120
 now just like Mario 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.710
 changed a lot and you can do it 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.150
 so see you already in the church 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.100
 can see your screen but you can 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.860
 of course see much better in game 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.420
 play and here you can see how one is 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.640
 kind of eat bit style 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.650
 eventually there will even be one 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.420
 realistic game has become it looks 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.540
 just look very realistic 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.790
 and so much has changed 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.259
 now even a do link and that 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.369
 A number of games have also been made 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.560
 but let's just get started 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.310
 start and as I just said began 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.340
 it all 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.640
 with the legend made game in 1986 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:38.640
 or zelda and the designer of a link 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.840
 by the way, shigeru miyamoto and what a 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.100
 basic that 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.770
 because he doesn't just have links 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:48.270
 but also has Mario Donky 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.979
 Kong Starfox FC Euro and Pikmin designed 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.680
 so as a person to one more like you 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.420
 must be appointed, it is he 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.729
 and he also has the first game with 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.000
 left in the legend of zelda 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.619
 for the Nintendo entertainment system 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.810
 and this was the first console by the way 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.649
 game that offers the possibility of data 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.780
 to seven 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.880
 in other words, I could continue where you were 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.729
 had remained 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.110
 and this bread has lots of options 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.330
 web for example possible to many 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.950
 make bigger games in the legend or 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.349
 zelda has helped with it 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.680
 founding of the popular genre action 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:20.680
 adventure 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.280
 the franchisers from the start 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.019
 difficult and the first game was full of 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.310
 different game elements 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:30.950
 Then you have to think about the 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.870
 elements action puzzles all 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.940
 different things you could do 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.590
 but the basics were simple so it was 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.569
 accessible to everyone everyone could 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.910
 play that game but on the other side 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:42.709
 everything really was very unclear 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.690
 it was not clear which way you were heading 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:46.700
 had to walk it was not clear what 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.319
 the next mission was and that makes it 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.940
 very challenging 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:52.069
 Nintendo come out that way that way 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.180
 people get confused and didn't know what 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:54.890
 they had to do 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.269
 and then she clearly tried miyamoto 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.260
 to make it perhaps better 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:59.329
 something to change 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.890
 to miyamoto was certain of them 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:02.180
 together very namely take into account the 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.250
 power of a community 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.290
 He saw that gamers with the cash register 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.910
 talk about the game with each other 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.799
 would compare making the game 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.540
 much simpler would be the 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:13.250
 difficulty level therefore caused the too 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.630
 much was talked about the game and 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.130
 because of this, more and more people lost it 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.780
 play the game yourself 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.700
 she also likes to see if 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.620
 the game is really that hard 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.260
 so with the game so an ever bigger 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.819
 success and it has remained a success 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.319
 the game will still be very good 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:29.510
 purchased and now there are worldwide 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:31.790
 already more than 52 million copies 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:35.209
 sold and this makes the legend of zelda 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.290
 one of the best-selling franchises 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:39.290
 ok this was all i was telling 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:41.000
 had over link and we now move on to the 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.040
 last week's question and that was what is 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.389
 your favorite game euro and i have 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.250
 checked for you 

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:48.709
 because you said in the comments 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.450
 and I 've counted the votes and when you get up 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:52.370
 day have you next to the video 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.780
 has come online then has your vote 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:58.359
 actually counted 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.359
 ok and then we move on to the top 3 

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:05.290
 well this is the top 3 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.720
 and as you see link is just 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:10.090
 first people you do partially first 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.069
 with pokÃ©mon but it's just 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.769
 first and in the graph you can 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:16.299
 see who is in the top 10 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:18.430
 so not just the first 3 but really 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:19.840
 just what it is up to 10 and I mean for it 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.240
 a new question for you this week 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.889
 because who do you think is the coolest game 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.850
 phil and objects do 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:26.800
 who do you think is the best 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.210
 you think you are bad guy in a game wii 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.300
 the coolest 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.770
 for me that is often a link not your 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.830
 vase that always throws at people 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:37.419
 no this phase of far cry 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.979
 I think it's really epic but I want 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:39.520
 so you also post questions in the 

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:42.520
 comments 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.710
 who do you think is the best the coolest the 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.949
 most epic villain in a video 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:46.570
 game 

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:48.520
 and if you place the comment on the day 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.590
 count that this video comes online 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.880
 back in the vote for the game phil 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.960
