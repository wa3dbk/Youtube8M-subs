now<00:00:16.770> just<00:00:17.250> like<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:17.520> last<00:00:17.640> level<00:00:17.940> this<00:00:18.150> level

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
now just like the last level this level

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.980 
now just like the last level this level
is<00:00:18.600> pretty<00:00:19.020> damn<00:00:19.350> easy<00:00:19.380> and<00:00:20.539> unless<00:00:21.539> you<00:00:21.750> kill

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
is pretty damn easy and unless you kill

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.560 
is pretty damn easy and unless you kill
yourself<00:00:22.670> using<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:23.880> try<00:00:24.060> again<00:00:24.269> option

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
yourself using the try again option

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.029 
yourself using the try again option
there's<00:00:24.750> almost<00:00:24.930> nothing<00:00:25.320> that<00:00:25.560> can<00:00:25.710> kill<00:00:25.859> you

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
there's almost nothing that can kill you

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.310 
there's almost nothing that can kill you
except<00:00:26.519> at<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:26.849> end<00:00:27.029> where<00:00:28.019> there<00:00:28.170> is<00:00:28.289> a

except at the end where there is a

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.580 
except at the end where there is a
little<00:00:28.590> bit<00:00:28.680> of<00:00:28.769> electricity<00:00:29.810> and<00:00:30.810> that's<00:00:31.410> in

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
little bit of electricity and that's in

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.200 
little bit of electricity and that's in
part<00:00:31.769> to<00:00:32.009> show<00:00:32.219> really<00:00:32.489> for<00:00:32.820> this<00:00:32.940> part

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210

there's<00:00:33.329> nothing<00:00:33.899> that<00:00:34.050> can<00:00:34.079> actually<00:00:36.350> really

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
there's nothing that can actually really

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.930 
there's nothing that can actually really
pose<00:00:37.800> a<00:00:37.829> threat<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.610> your<00:00:40.700> erasing<00:00:41.700> of<00:00:41.790> this

pose a threat to your erasing of this

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.690 
pose a threat to your erasing of this
level<00:00:42.270> at<00:00:42.450> this<00:00:42.660> point

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:46.700 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:56.610 

ah

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:56.620 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:06.780 

I<00:00:59.610> say<00:01:00.610> another<00:01:01.510> pickup

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:06.790 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.219 

when<00:01:07.790> you<00:01:07.940> swing<00:01:08.180> over<00:01:08.330> these<00:01:08.570> dropping<00:01:09.080> down

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
when you swing over these dropping down

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:11.770 
when you swing over these dropping down
on<00:01:09.440> the<00:01:09.530> ground<00:01:09.680> is<00:01:09.920> fine<00:01:10.190> a<00:01:10.580> little<00:01:11.510> bounce

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
on the ground is fine a little bounce

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:17.170 
on the ground is fine a little bounce
pad<00:01:12.110> just<00:01:12.350> comes<00:01:12.560> up<00:01:15.100> so<00:01:16.100> you<00:01:16.820> don't<00:01:16.850> need<00:01:17.090> to

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
pad just comes up so you don't need to

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.960 
pad just comes up so you don't need to
worry<00:01:17.210> about<00:01:18.070> getting<00:01:19.070> over<00:01:19.430> the<00:01:19.549> chasms

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
worry about getting over the chasms

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.050 
worry about getting over the chasms
without<00:01:20.270> falling<00:01:20.600> off<00:01:21.880> they're<00:01:22.880> not<00:01:23.000> even

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
without falling off they're not even

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.399 
without falling off they're not even
chasms<00:01:23.630> there<00:01:23.869> is

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:31.660 

raised<00:01:28.130> sponges<00:01:28.909> the<00:01:29.270> go<00:01:29.420> over<00:01:29.659> would<00:01:30.670> not

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
raised sponges the go over would not

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:47.169 
raised sponges the go over would not
much<00:01:31.880> of<00:01:32.119> a<00:01:32.240> chasm<00:01:32.420> at<00:01:32.719> all<00:01:45.369> so<00:01:46.369> any<00:01:46.549> danger

00:01:47.169 --> 00:01:47.179 
much of a chasm at all so any danger

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:49.870 
much of a chasm at all so any danger
that<00:01:47.329> this<00:01:47.509> level<00:01:47.840> contains<00:01:48.799> easy<00:01:49.250> in<00:01:49.549> his

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
that this level contains easy in his

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.230 
that this level contains easy in his
second<00:01:50.299> time<00:01:50.509> and<00:01:51.700> even<00:01:52.700> then<00:01:52.880> there's<00:01:53.090> not

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
second time and even then there's not

00:01:53.240 --> 00:02:10.160 
second time and even then there's not
that<00:01:53.270> much

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.710 

once<00:02:11.170> again<00:02:11.320> you<00:02:11.860> can<00:02:12.280> drop<00:02:12.580> onto<00:02:13.210> the<00:02:13.420> ground

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
once again you can drop onto the ground

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:40.399 
once again you can drop onto the ground
bounds<00:02:14.500> pants<00:02:14.830> will<00:02:14.920> come<00:02:15.100> up<00:02:18.150> not<00:02:19.150> a<00:02:19.180> big<00:02:19.360> deal

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:40.409 

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:42.929 

as<00:02:41.409> you<00:02:41.560> can<00:02:41.650> see<00:02:41.890> there's<00:02:42.189> electricity<00:02:42.549> now

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:42.939 
as you can see there's electricity now

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:46.110 
as you can see there's electricity now
so<00:02:43.209> we've<00:02:43.629> got<00:02:43.840> to<00:02:43.959> be<00:02:44.079> careful<00:02:44.310> do<00:02:45.310> not<00:02:45.579> extend

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
so we've got to be careful do not extend

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.720 
so we've got to be careful do not extend
the<00:02:46.930> length<00:02:47.829> of<00:02:48.010> the<00:02:48.129> grappling<00:02:48.400> hook<00:02:48.579> too

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
the length of the grappling hook too

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.729 
the length of the grappling hook too
long<00:02:48.909> when<00:02:49.480> you<00:02:49.569> swim<00:02:49.719> across<00:02:49.959> press<00:02:50.409> right

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
long when you swim across press right

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:52.830 
long when you swim across press right
and<00:02:51.010> up<00:02:51.340> it<00:02:52.209> will<00:02:52.359> give<00:02:52.480> you<00:02:52.599> a<00:02:52.629> bit<00:02:52.810> more

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
and up it will give you a bit more

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.849 
and up it will give you a bit more
momentum<00:02:53.230> and<00:02:53.790> it<00:02:54.790> will<00:02:54.909> make<00:02:55.120> the<00:02:55.859> graphic

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:56.859 
momentum and it will make the graphic

00:02:56.859 --> 00:02:59.869 
momentum and it will make the graphic
books<00:02:57.040> spring<00:02:57.849> shorter<00:02:58.420> rather<00:02:58.780> than<00:02:59.019> longer

00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879 
books spring shorter rather than longer

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:02.250 
books spring shorter rather than longer
which<00:03:00.879> lessens<00:03:01.329> will<00:03:01.480> risk<00:03:01.689> all<00:03:01.930> getting

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
which lessens will risk all getting

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.470 
which lessens will risk all getting
electrocuted<00:03:02.549> also<00:03:03.549> don't<00:03:03.790> let<00:03:03.939> go<00:03:04.180> of<00:03:04.299> our

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
electrocuted also don't let go of our

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.409 
electrocuted also don't let go of our
one<00:03:05.370> unless<00:03:06.370> you<00:03:06.669> know<00:03:06.970> you're<00:03:07.209> going<00:03:07.299> to<00:03:07.359> be

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:07.419 
one unless you know you're going to be

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:10.710 
one unless you know you're going to be

just waitin to you around about the top

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.800 
just waitin to you around about the top
and<00:03:14.680> you<00:03:14.829> can<00:03:14.980> either<00:03:15.069> jump<00:03:15.430> off<00:03:15.609> like<00:03:15.730> that<00:03:16.030> or
