unboxing portion of this video so I'm

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.899 
unboxing portion of this video so I'm
going<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.110> pull<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.650> cover<00:01:07.890> off<00:01:08.010> of<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.780> box

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:18.800 
going to pull the cover off of the box
and<00:01:12.049> set<00:01:13.049> this<00:01:13.369> to<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.400> side<00:01:14.520> and<00:01:16.130> as<00:01:17.479> you<00:01:18.479> can

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
and set this to the side and as you can

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.039 
and set this to the side and as you can
see<00:01:18.840> right<00:01:19.049> here<00:01:19.619> this<00:01:20.490> is<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.759> clamcase<00:01:21.540> is

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
see right here this is the clamcase is

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.170 
see right here this is the clamcase is
the<00:01:22.320> actual<00:01:22.560> case<00:01:22.860> so<00:01:23.670> we're<00:01:23.850> going<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:24.060> set

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
the actual case so we're going to set

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.340 
the actual case so we're going to set
this<00:01:24.299> aside<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.630> then<00:01:24.869> we'll<00:01:24.990> look<00:01:25.110> at<00:01:25.200> this

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
this aside and then we'll look at this

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.690 
this aside and then we'll look at this
again<00:01:25.680> in<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.250> second<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:27.770> then<00:01:28.770> that's<00:01:29.369> it

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
again in the second and then that's it

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.090 
again in the second and then that's it
in<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:29.970> box<00:01:30.180> so<00:01:30.840> let's<00:01:31.350> come<00:01:31.560> back<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.950> the

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
in the box so let's come back to the

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.050 
in the box so let's come back to the
clamcase<00:01:33.380> so<00:01:34.380> this<00:01:34.799> is<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.280> clone<00:01:35.490> case<00:01:35.759> right

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
clamcase so this is the clone case right

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.030 
clamcase so this is the clone case right
here<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:36.659> I'm<00:01:37.590> going<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:37.799> give<00:01:37.920> you<00:01:38.009> a

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
demonstration in one second so it's a

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.760 
demonstration in one second so it's a
bit<00:01:42.479> of<00:01:42.570> plastic<00:01:42.750> wrap<00:01:43.140> here<00:01:43.409> that<00:01:43.590> we<00:01:43.740> can

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
bit of plastic wrap here that we can

00:01:43.770 --> 00:02:00.830 
bit of plastic wrap here that we can
just<00:01:44.070> peel<00:01:44.220> off

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840
