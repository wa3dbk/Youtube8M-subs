at which man started the race back up in

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.160 
at which man started the race back up in
Jamestown<00:02:59.519> and<00:02:59.730> Matt<00:03:00.690> you<00:03:00.840> know<00:03:00.959> the<00:03:01.080> average

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
Jamestown and Matt you know the average

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:02.509 
Jamestown and Matt you know the average
why<00:03:01.440> did<00:03:01.650> you<00:03:01.709> put<00:03:01.890> out<00:03:01.980> on<00:03:02.070> your<00:03:02.160> bike<00:03:02.310> when

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
why did you put out on your bike when

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:05.120 
why did you put out on your bike when
you're<00:03:02.670> you<00:03:03.450> know<00:03:03.570> go<00:03:04.470> for<00:03:04.709> a<00:03:04.739> training<00:03:04.950> ride

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
you're you know go for a training ride

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:12.340 
you're you know go for a training ride
yeah<00:03:05.880> I<00:03:05.910> think<00:03:06.030> I<00:03:06.150> do<00:03:06.209> about<00:03:06.799> 300<00:03:07.799> watts

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:14.860 

one<00:03:12.980> horsepower<00:03:13.310> in<00:03:13.610> a<00:03:13.670> human<00:03:13.970> is<00:03:14.450> directly

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
one horsepower in a human is directly

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.280 
one horsepower in a human is directly
equivalent<00:03:15.520> 745<00:03:16.520> wats<00:03:16.820> so<00:03:17.600> on<00:03:17.720> a<00:03:17.750> typical<00:03:17.810> ride

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
equivalent 745 wats so on a typical ride

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:19.330 
equivalent 745 wats so on a typical ride
you're<00:03:18.530> putting<00:03:18.740> out<00:03:18.860> about<00:03:18.950> a<00:03:19.070> half<00:03:19.250> a

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
you're putting out about a half a

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.020 
you're putting out about a half a
horsepower<00:03:20.020> and<00:03:21.020> sounds<00:03:21.590> that<00:03:21.650> right<00:03:21.950> so<00:03:22.820> now

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
horsepower and sounds that right so now

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.970 
horsepower and sounds that right so now
you've<00:03:23.150> got<00:03:23.270> 300<00:03:23.720> horsepower<00:03:23.960> to<00:03:24.350> beat<00:03:24.830> your

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
you've got 300 horsepower to beat your

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.890 
you've got 300 horsepower to beat your
time<00:03:25.160> going<00:03:25.400> up<00:03:25.610> the<00:03:25.970> hill<00:03:26.120> versus<00:03:26.510> going<00:03:26.660> down

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
time going up the hill versus going down

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:32.880 
time going up the hill versus going down
the<00:03:27.050> hill<00:03:30.340> cascata<00:03:31.340> lot<00:03:31.610> 300<00:03:32.480> horsepower

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
the hill cascata lot 300 horsepower

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.500 
the hill cascata lot 300 horsepower
quite<00:03:33.890> a<00:03:33.920> lot<00:03:34.190> and<00:03:34.460> just<00:03:34.970> the<00:03:35.210> way<00:03:35.300> that<00:03:35.450> it
