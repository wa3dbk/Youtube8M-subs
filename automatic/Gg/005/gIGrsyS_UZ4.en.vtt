all of their narrations I mean I sounded
okay<00:02:46.290> but<00:02:46.920> then<00:02:47.250> it<00:02:47.579> just<00:02:47.610> sounded<00:02:48.390> way<00:02:48.599> to

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
okay but then it just sounded way to

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.569 
okay but then it just sounded way to
force<00:02:49.170> it<00:02:49.380> didn't<00:02:49.680> come<00:02:49.829> out<00:02:49.860> right<00:02:50.010> and<00:02:50.459> it

force it didn't come out right and it
just<00:02:50.730> sounded<00:02:51.000> really<00:02:51.239> awkward<00:02:51.720> in<00:02:51.840> the<00:02:52.079> end

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
just sounded really awkward in the end

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:55.009 
just sounded really awkward in the end
and<00:02:52.620> just<00:02:53.060> wasn't<00:02:54.060> as<00:02:54.299> enjoyable<00:02:54.720> but<00:02:54.870> then

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019
