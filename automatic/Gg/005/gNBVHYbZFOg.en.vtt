then<00:01:53.340> you<00:01:53.490> can<00:01:53.640> just<00:01:53.759> keep<00:01:53.909> on<00:01:54.060> going<00:01:54.090> from

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
then you can just keep on going from

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.350 
then you can just keep on going from
there<00:01:54.750> get<00:01:55.560> all<00:01:55.710> all<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.340> stuff<00:01:56.579> you<00:01:56.729> want<00:01:56.939> but

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
for ceiling tiles for glowstone if you

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.389 
for ceiling tiles for glowstone if you
put<00:01:59.759> two<00:01:59.969> things<00:02:00.119> like<00:02:00.270> that<00:02:00.509> it'll<00:02:00.930> be<00:02:01.020> that

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:01.399 
put two things like that it'll be that

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:03.590 
put two things like that it'll be that
sorry<00:02:02.399> you'll<00:02:02.520> be<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.670> ceiling<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.090> one<00:02:03.210> and

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
sorry you'll be the ceiling the one and

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.690 
sorry you'll be the ceiling the one and
if<00:02:03.899> you<00:02:03.960> put<00:02:04.229> two<00:02:04.439> glass<00:02:04.799> like<00:02:05.070> that<00:02:05.280> it'll<00:02:05.640> be

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
if you put two glass like that it'll be

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:06.950 
if you put two glass like that it'll be
a<00:02:05.790> sailing<00:02:06.119> one<00:02:06.270> which<00:02:06.659> is<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.840> only

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
a sailing one which is the only

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.749 
a sailing one which is the only
different<00:02:07.350> recipe<00:02:07.710> pretty<00:02:08.340> sure<00:02:08.429> that's<00:02:08.550> all

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
different recipe pretty sure that's all

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.180 
different recipe pretty sure that's all
yes<00:02:09.119> it<00:02:09.270> is<00:02:09.300> so<00:02:10.229> now<00:02:10.349> guys<00:02:10.590> will<00:02:10.800> begin<00:02:10.979> to<00:02:11.099> what

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
yes it is so now guys will begin to what

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.130 
yes it is so now guys will begin to what
they<00:02:11.310> look<00:02:11.520> like<00:02:11.550> as<00:02:12.510> you<00:02:12.720> can<00:02:12.810> see<00:02:12.989> the

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
they look like as you can see the

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.760 
they look like as you can see the
cobblestone

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
cobblestone

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.770 
cobblestone
one<00:02:13.920> but<00:02:14.430> each<00:02:14.580> one<00:02:14.640> has<00:02:14.970> a<00:02:15.000> different<00:02:15.210> texture

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
one but each one has a different texture

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.360 
one but each one has a different texture
from<00:02:16.380> their<00:02:16.560> actual<00:02:16.890> counterpart<00:02:17.660> except<00:02:18.660> for

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
from their actual counterpart except for

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.730 
from their actual counterpart except for
the<00:02:20.660> outside<00:02:21.660> the<00:02:21.780> iron<00:02:22.050> one<00:02:22.200> still<00:02:22.470> has<00:02:22.500> the

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
the outside the iron one still has the

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.470 
the outside the iron one still has the
old<00:02:22.770> texture<00:02:23.310> but<00:02:23.670> the<00:02:23.730> glowstone<00:02:24.150> was<00:02:24.330> the

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
old texture but the glowstone was the

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.960 
old texture but the glowstone was the
only<00:02:24.660> one<00:02:24.870> that's<00:02:25.080> almost<00:02:25.560> I<00:02:25.800> think<00:02:25.970> exactly

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
only one that's almost I think exactly

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.940 
only one that's almost I think exactly
the<00:02:27.300> same<00:02:27.540> I<00:02:27.870> think<00:02:28.440> that<00:02:28.500> one's<00:02:28.680> maybe<00:02:28.860> a

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
the same I think that one's maybe a

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.360 
the same I think that one's maybe a
little<00:02:29.100> bit<00:02:29.280> later<00:02:29.460> but<00:02:30.180> oh<00:02:30.390> bugger<00:02:31.430> hello<00:02:32.900> um

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
you but if you see right here glowstone

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.110 
you but if you see right here glowstone
for<00:02:46.110> it<00:02:46.230> produces<00:02:46.650> light<00:02:46.830> as<00:02:47.550> you<00:02:47.610> can<00:02:47.910> see

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
look right here it's been light is being

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.500 
look right here it's been light is being
produced<00:02:56.280> with<00:02:56.430> these<00:02:56.610> now<00:02:57.330> interestingly

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
produced with these now interestingly

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.020 
produced with these now interestingly
enough<00:02:58.050> white<00:02:58.350> is<00:02:58.500> also<00:02:58.890> produced<00:02:59.100> with<00:02:59.850> these

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
enough white is also produced with these

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.590 
enough white is also produced with these
glass<00:03:00.420> tiles<00:03:01.280> and<00:03:02.280> also<00:03:02.820> and<00:03:03.180> then<00:03:03.360> these<00:03:03.540> are

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
glass tiles and also and then these are

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.270 
glass tiles and also and then these are
just<00:03:03.870> as<00:03:04.050> the<00:03:04.170> example<00:03:04.440> of<00:03:04.650> the<00:03:04.830> normal<00:03:05.130> would

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
just as the example of the normal would

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.020 
just as the example of the normal would
dark<00:03:05.880> wood<00:03:06.150> and<00:03:06.470> light<00:03:07.470> wood<00:03:07.800> and<00:03:08.040> also<00:03:08.820> light
