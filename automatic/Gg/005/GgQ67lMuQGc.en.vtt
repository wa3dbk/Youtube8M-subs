00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
seats this is a common tuning for claw

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.510 
seats this is a common tuning for claw
hammer<00:00:18.570> style<00:00:18.960> one<00:00:19.740> of<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:19.890> reasons<00:00:20.220> I<00:00:20.340> like

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
hammer style one of the reasons I like

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.150 
hammer style one of the reasons I like
this<00:00:20.580> -<00:00:20.939> so<00:00:21.300> well<00:00:21.570> is<00:00:22.020> that<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.440> melody<00:00:22.800> is

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
this - so well is that the melody is

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.529 
this - so well is that the melody is
frequently<00:00:23.670> on<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.000> first<00:00:24.360> string<00:00:26.420> which<00:00:27.420> is

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
frequently on the first string which is

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.870 
frequently on the first string which is
easier<00:00:27.900> to<00:00:27.930> play<00:00:28.230> a<00:00:28.260> claw<00:00:28.560> hammer<00:00:28.590> style<00:00:29.190> so

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
easier to play a claw hammer style so

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.460 
easier to play a claw hammer style so
that<00:00:30.090> that's<00:00:30.510> one<00:00:30.750> of<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:30.869> reasons<00:00:31.200> I<00:00:31.320> like

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
that that's one of the reasons I like

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.680 
that that's one of the reasons I like
this<00:00:31.530> jr.<00:00:32.039> so<00:00:32.219> well<00:00:32.460> let<00:00:33.120> me<00:00:33.210> show<00:00:33.360> you<00:00:33.449> how<00:00:33.600> to

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
this jr. so well let me show you how to

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.709 
this jr. so well let me show you how to
get<00:00:33.840> to<00:00:34.050> it<00:00:34.079> okay<00:00:34.649> so<00:00:35.280> you<00:00:36.090> get<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.480> first

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
get to it okay so you get the first

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.340 
get to it okay so you get the first
frame<00:00:37.079> is<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:37.590> deep<00:00:38.449> that's<00:00:39.449> common<00:00:39.989> in<00:00:40.109> many

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
frame is a deep that's common in many

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.099 
frame is a deep that's common in many
tunes<00:00:40.859> so<00:00:41.399> that<00:00:41.760> probably<00:00:42.089> won't<00:00:42.269> change<00:00:42.390> for

00:00:43.099 --> 00:00:43.109 
tunes so that probably won't change for

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:46.279 
tunes so that probably won't change for
the<00:00:43.170> most<00:00:43.350> part<00:00:43.649> okay<00:00:44.129> then<00:00:44.760> second<00:00:45.749> string<00:00:45.960> is

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
the most part okay then second string is

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.779 
the most part okay then second string is
a<00:00:46.319> C<00:00:47.269> and<00:00:48.269> how<00:00:48.510> do<00:00:48.569> you<00:00:48.659> get<00:00:48.780> a<00:00:48.809> tune<00:00:49.649> that<00:00:49.789> is

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
a C and how do you get a tune that is

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.189 
a C and how do you get a tune that is
you're<00:00:50.969> gonna<00:00:51.030> put<00:00:51.149> your<00:00:51.449> finger<00:00:51.749> on<00:00:51.929> the

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
you're gonna put your finger on the

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.369 
you're gonna put your finger on the
second<00:00:52.620> string<00:00:52.649> that's<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.280> second<00:00:53.729> fret

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 
second string that's the second fret

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:56.660 
second string that's the second fret
you're<00:00:55.379> gonna<00:00:55.499> make<00:00:55.889> it<00:00:56.069> sound<00:00:56.249> like<00:00:56.429> the

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
you're gonna make it sound like the

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.889 
you're gonna make it sound like the
first<00:00:56.969> string<00:00:57.469> open<00:00:59.149> you<00:01:00.149> match<00:01:00.359> those<00:01:00.600> two

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
first string open you match those two

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:01.610 
first string open you match those two
together

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
together

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.009 
together
the<00:01:01.740> first<00:01:02.040> ring<00:01:02.250> will<00:01:02.460> be<00:01:02.490> a<00:01:02.610> deep<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.630> second

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
the first ring will be a deep the second

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.680 
the first ring will be a deep the second
string<00:01:04.230> will<00:01:04.379> be<00:01:04.500> a<00:01:04.530> seat<00:01:04.890> okay<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.420> third

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:06.690 
string will be a seat okay the third

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:12.440 
string will be a seat okay the third
string<00:01:07.140> is<00:01:07.200> going<00:01:07.620> to<00:01:07.680> be<00:01:07.770> a<00:01:07.800> jeep<00:01:08.190> and<00:01:11.270> you<00:01:12.270> can

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
string is going to be a jeep and you can

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.540 
string is going to be a jeep and you can
match<00:01:12.690> that<00:01:12.720> if<00:01:13.260> you<00:01:13.410> like<00:01:13.650> by<00:01:14.130> putting<00:01:14.160> your

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:14.550 
match that if you like by putting your

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.370 
match that if you like by putting your
finger<00:01:14.910> on<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.270> third<00:01:15.510> string<00:01:15.540> at<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.110> fifth

finger on the third string at the fifth
fret<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:17.640> then<00:01:17.790> you<00:01:17.970> sound<00:01:18.330> like<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.720> second

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
fret and then you sound like the second

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.440 
fret and then you sound like the second
string<00:01:19.470> over<00:01:20.840> okay<00:01:21.840> so<00:01:22.830> you<00:01:22.890> have<00:01:23.330> versus<00:01:24.330> the

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
string over okay so you have versus the

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.870

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.420 

continue<00:01:33.090> several<00:01:33.840> ways<00:01:33.990> you<00:01:34.410> can<00:01:34.950> match<00:01:35.250> them

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
continue several ways you can match them

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.430 
continue several ways you can match them
against<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.880> second<00:01:36.330> string<00:01:36.600> open<00:01:37.080> which<00:01:37.259> is

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:37.440 
against the second string open which is

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.150 
against the second string open which is
a<00:01:37.470> city<00:01:39.080> or<00:01:40.080> you<00:01:40.320> can<00:01:40.470> do<00:01:40.560> it<00:01:40.680> by<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.830> fret

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:41.160 
a city or you can do it by the fret

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.400 
a city or you can do it by the fret
method<00:01:41.640> put<00:01:42.180> your<00:01:42.360> finger<00:01:42.690> on<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:43.110> fourth

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:43.410 
method put your finger on the fourth

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:49.250 
method put your finger on the fourth
string<00:01:43.530> at<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.490> seventh<00:01:45.000> fret

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:49.260 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.730 

that's<00:01:49.980> against<00:01:50.400> the<00:01:50.580> third<00:01:50.880> string<00:01:51.360> open<00:01:51.780> so

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
that's against the third string open so

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.220 
that's against the third string open so
your<00:01:52.890> finger<00:01:53.280> on<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.940> fourth<00:01:54.750> string<00:01:54.870> at<00:01:55.200> the

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:55.230 
your finger on the fourth string at the

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:57.500 
your finger on the fourth string at the
seventh<00:01:55.770> fret<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:56.850> that<00:01:57.060> should<00:01:57.300> make<00:01:57.450> it

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:57.510 
seventh fret and that should make it

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.620 
seventh fret and that should make it
sound<00:01:57.810> like<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.320> third<00:01:58.530> string<00:01:58.800> and<00:01:59.630> then

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
sound like the third string and then

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.990 
sound like the third string and then
your<00:02:00.720> fifth<00:02:01.020> string<00:02:01.290> is<00:02:01.530> a<00:02:01.560> Jeep<00:02:01.980> which<00:02:02.640> would

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
your fifth string is a Jeep which would

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000 
your fifth string is a Jeep which would
probably<00:02:03.210> be<00:02:03.540> for<00:02:03.780> most<00:02:03.990> tuning<00:02:04.530> so<00:02:04.740> of<00:02:04.830> course

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.010 
probably be for most tuning so of course

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.070 
probably be for most tuning so of course
you<00:02:05.220> would<00:02:05.370> match<00:02:05.850> that<00:02:06.210> because<00:02:06.870> it's<00:02:07.020> the

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
you would match that because it's the

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:24.680 
you would match that because it's the
first<00:02:07.290> string<00:02:07.620> of<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:07.890> fifth<00:02:08.160> fret<00:02:22.670> basic<00:02:23.690> CC
