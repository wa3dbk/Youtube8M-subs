00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:29.859 
white like I showed you earlier as far

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:31.740 
white like I showed you earlier as far
as<00:03:30.099> the<00:03:30.160> midsole<00:03:30.489> and<00:03:30.760> toe<00:03:30.910> PAP<00:03:31.180> is<00:03:31.359> concerned

as the midsole and toe PAP is concerned

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.780 
as the midsole and toe PAP is concerned
it's<00:03:32.290> an<00:03:32.440> off-white<00:03:32.680> color<00:03:33.340> which<00:03:33.579> i<00:03:33.730> think

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
it's an off-white color which i think

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.309 
it's an off-white color which i think
looks<00:03:34.000> better<00:03:34.359> than<00:03:34.599> just<00:03:34.810> straight<00:03:35.049> white

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:35.319 
looks better than just straight white

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:37.199 
looks better than just straight white
I'm<00:03:35.799> a<00:03:35.859> big<00:03:36.040> fan<00:03:36.250> of<00:03:36.280> the<00:03:36.489> off-white<00:03:36.879> it<00:03:37.060> gives

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
I'm a big fan of the off-white it gives

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:39.119 
I'm a big fan of the off-white it gives
us<00:03:37.329> you<00:03:37.450> somewhat<00:03:37.720> of<00:03:37.780> a<00:03:37.900> retro<00:03:38.349> look<00:03:38.379> which<00:03:39.099> is

00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:39.129 
us you somewhat of a retro look which is

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:41.009 
us you somewhat of a retro look which is
something<00:03:39.519> that<00:03:39.639> I<00:03:39.730> think<00:03:39.760> looks<00:03:40.480> well<00:03:40.780> it

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
something that I think looks well it

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:42.629 
something that I think looks well it
looks<00:03:41.200> really<00:03:41.440> good<00:03:41.590> on<00:03:41.650> the<00:03:41.949> super<00:03:42.220> star<00:03:42.430> too

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:42.639 
looks really good on the super star too

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:44.339 
looks really good on the super star too
simply<00:03:43.329> because<00:03:43.449> it's<00:03:43.720> kind<00:03:43.870> of<00:03:43.900> a<00:03:43.989> more<00:03:44.139> retro

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:44.349 
simply because it's kind of a more retro

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:46.890 
simply because it's kind of a more retro
style<00:03:44.829> too<00:03:45.069> to<00:03:45.220> begin<00:03:45.519> with<00:03:45.669> the<00:03:46.569> rest<00:03:46.750> of<00:03:46.810> the

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.780 
exactly the same color white as the
midsole<00:04:14.139> and<00:04:14.199> the<00:04:14.470> toe<00:04:14.650> cap<00:04:14.889> it's<00:04:15.459> kind<00:04:15.730> of

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
midsole and the toe cap it's kind of

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:17.819 
midsole and the toe cap it's kind of
like<00:04:16.000> a<00:04:16.030> straight<00:04:16.810> one<00:04:16.989> whereas<00:04:17.349> the<00:04:17.440> toe<00:04:17.590> cap

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:17.829 
like a straight one whereas the toe cap

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:19.319 
like a straight one whereas the toe cap
and<00:04:18.070> midsole<00:04:18.370> is<00:04:18.489> like<00:04:18.609> an<00:04:18.729> off-white<00:04:18.910> color

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
and midsole is like an off-white color

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:21.089 
and midsole is like an off-white color
but<00:04:19.959> for<00:04:20.109> the<00:04:20.199> most<00:04:20.349> part<00:04:20.470> I<00:04:20.650> still<00:04:20.709> think<00:04:21.010> it

00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:21.099 
but for the most part I still think it

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:22.950 
but for the most part I still think it
looks<00:04:21.159> pretty<00:04:21.519> good<00:04:21.700> I<00:04:22.000> can't<00:04:22.510> really<00:04:22.630> decide

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
looks pretty good I can't really decide

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.270 
looks pretty good I can't really decide
which<00:04:23.200> one<00:04:23.349> I<00:04:23.409> like<00:04:23.560> better<00:04:23.740> I<00:04:23.890> think<00:04:24.159> I'm

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
which one I like better I think I'm

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.060 
which one I like better I think I'm
leaning<00:04:24.460> more<00:04:24.700> towards<00:04:25.000> the<00:04:25.090> black<00:04:25.270> but

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
leaning more towards the black but

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.980 
leaning more towards the black but
