once<00:00:19.109> again<00:00:19.380> a<00:00:19.529> nexus<00:00:20.189> needs<00:00:20.400> to<00:00:20.550> be<00:00:20.640> replaced

once again a nexus needs to be replaced

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.970 
once again a nexus needs to be replaced
down<00:00:21.390> and<00:00:21.600> that<00:00:21.660> is<00:00:21.810> a<00:00:21.840> hundred<00:00:22.320> units<00:00:22.500> of<00:00:22.769> time

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
down and that is a hundred units of time

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.859 
down and that is a hundred units of time
so<00:00:23.430> that<00:00:23.460> will<00:00:23.789> be<00:00:23.910> quite<00:00:24.090> some<00:00:24.390> time<00:00:24.600> almost
