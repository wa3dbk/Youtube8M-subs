00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
to the abilities that we see in call of

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.999 
to the abilities that we see in call of
duty<00:01:26.729> tomm<00:01:27.150> it<00:01:27.390> basically<00:01:27.840> gives<00:01:28.229> dead<00:01:28.619> bodies

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009

a<00:01:29.040> chance<00:01:29.430> to<00:01:29.640> go<00:01:29.790> get<00:01:29.970> laid<00:01:30.240> if<00:01:30.509> they<00:01:30.659> haven't

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
a chance to go get laid if they haven't

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.289 
a chance to go get laid if they haven't
already<00:01:31.460> anyways<00:01:32.460> getting<00:01:32.939> back<00:01:33.060> to<00:01:33.210> the

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
already anyways getting back to the

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.270 
already anyways getting back to the
coordinates<00:01:33.659> that<00:01:34.020> we<00:01:34.140> see<00:01:34.380> right<00:01:34.979> next<00:01:35.220> to

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
coordinates that we see right next to

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.370 
coordinates that we see right next to
the<00:01:35.340> 115<00:01:35.880> now<00:01:36.270> we<00:01:36.329> type<00:01:36.630> these<00:01:36.810> coordinates

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
the 115 now we type these coordinates

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.929 
the 115 now we type these coordinates
into<00:01:37.590> our<00:01:37.860> good<00:01:38.070> friend<00:01:38.400> it<00:01:38.520> could<00:01:38.640> be<00:01:38.729> good

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
into our good friend it could be good

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.109 
into our good friend it could be good
google<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.720> it<00:01:40.229> brings<00:01:40.530> us<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:41.130> Egypt

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
google and it brings us to Egypt

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.130 
google and it brings us to Egypt
drumroll<00:01:43.020> please<00:01:43.399> the<00:01:44.399> pyramids<00:01:44.970> so<00:01:45.869> we<00:01:46.020> could

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
drumroll please the pyramids so we could

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.950 
drumroll please the pyramids so we could
assume<00:01:46.530> that<00:01:46.590> we<00:01:47.280> would<00:01:47.460> only<00:01:47.490> assume<00:01:48.210> that

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
assume that we would only assume that

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.630 
assume that we would only assume that
this<00:01:49.439> has<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:49.890> do<00:01:49.979> with<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.220> zombies

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
this has to do with the zombies

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.850 
this has to do with the zombies
considering<00:01:51.210> 115<00:01:51.840> is<00:01:52.049> all<00:01:52.200> around<00:01:52.500> these

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
considering 115 is all around these

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.550 
considering 115 is all around these
coordinates<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.700> I<00:01:53.880> believe<00:01:54.240> going<00:01:54.600> to<00:01:54.780> Egypt

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
coordinates and I believe going to Egypt

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.859 
coordinates and I believe going to Egypt
with<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.920> great<00:01:56.130> pyramids<00:01:56.850> with<00:01:57.210> zombies

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
with the great pyramids with zombies

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.980 
with the great pyramids with zombies
that<00:01:58.350> would<00:01:58.560> be<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:59.040> greatest<00:01:59.460> map<00:02:00.030> ever<00:02:00.360> two

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
that would be the greatest map ever two

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.530 
that would be the greatest map ever two
and<00:02:01.170> a<00:02:01.229> half<00:02:01.500> years<00:02:01.950> ago<00:02:02.219> I<00:02:02.430> made<00:02:02.700> a<00:02:02.880> zombies

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
and a half years ago I made a zombies

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.230 
and a half years ago I made a zombies
map<00:02:03.840> idea<00:02:04.290> about<00:02:04.500> black<00:02:04.799> ops<00:02:05.040> 2<00:02:05.219> going<00:02:05.880> to<00:02:06.090> the

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
map idea about black ops 2 going to the

map idea about black ops 2 going to the
pyramids<00:02:06.689> which<00:02:06.869> I'll<00:02:07.020> put<00:02:07.200> on<00:02:07.290> screen<00:02:07.710> and

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
pyramids which I'll put on screen and

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.710

can think we could assume here that they
made<00:02:38.159> one<00:02:38.370> inside<00:02:38.790> a<00:02:38.819> pyramid<00:02:39.180> now<00:02:39.720> if<00:02:39.840> you're

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
made one inside a pyramid now if you're

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.229 
made one inside a pyramid now if you're
not<00:02:40.019> familiar<00:02:40.200> with<00:02:40.769> pyramids<00:02:41.129> they're<00:02:41.970> all

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
not familiar with pyramids they're all

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.080 
not familiar with pyramids they're all
tombs<00:02:42.959> their<00:02:43.530> underground<00:02:44.340> there's<00:02:44.849> two

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
tombs their underground there's two

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.819 
tombs their underground there's two
going<00:02:45.450> through<00:02:45.659> it<00:02:45.810> it<00:02:45.959> would<00:02:46.109> make<00:02:46.290> a<00:02:46.319> perfect

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:46.829 
going through it it would make a perfect

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:48.949 
going through it it would make a perfect
map<00:02:47.370> and<00:02:47.639> you<00:02:47.670> wouldn't<00:02:48.269> even<00:02:48.329> have<00:02:48.629> to<00:02:48.659> be

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
map and you wouldn't even have to be

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.479 
map and you wouldn't even have to be
inside<00:02:49.349> the<00:02:49.500> pyramid<00:02:49.709> the<00:02:49.920> whole<00:02:50.010> time<00:02:50.310> it

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
inside the pyramid the whole time it

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.250 
inside the pyramid the whole time it
could<00:02:50.579> be<00:02:50.639> outside<00:02:51.120> the<00:02:51.150> map<00:02:51.420> and<00:02:51.599> then<00:02:52.139> you

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
could be outside the map and then you

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.680 
could be outside the map and then you
buy<00:02:52.829> doors<00:02:53.250> inside<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:53.909> map<00:02:54.120> going<00:02:54.450> through

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
buy doors inside the map going through

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.199 
buy doors inside the map going through
in<00:02:54.840> and<00:02:55.139> out<00:02:55.260> it<00:02:55.620> would<00:02:55.739> be<00:02:55.829> perfect<00:02:56.639> but<00:02:56.879> let

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
in and out it would be perfect but let

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:58.309 
in and out it would be perfect but let
me<00:02:57.239> know<00:02:57.359> what<00:02:57.599> you<00:02:57.720> guys<00:02:57.840> think<00:02:58.079> in<00:02:58.260> the
