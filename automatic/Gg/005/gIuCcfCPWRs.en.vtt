00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.910
 Welcome her to a second tuning video 

00:00:09.909 --> 00:00:12.519
 around this 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:14.969
 wobbly flight behavior 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.150
 Sweet driving back and forth during the flight at relatively low 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.699
 number of revolutions 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:22.699
 to avoid writing off to change 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:26.999
 and to do so first 

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:30.579
 the rotor blades are adjusted so as to be tightened 

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:33.170
 that's this 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:34.550
 by itself 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.710
 fall down very easily 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.760
 Clifton alone is very strong in avoiding the situation 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.590
 two goals must have the screws often creates 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.960
 be attracted 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.500
 really strong 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.500
 not too strong logically 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.130
 Stone and leg 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.850
 ca 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.400
 "There it goes 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.170
 this screw is turned 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.540
 under the 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.540
 This should be tightened as firmly as possible 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.810
 he stood stable 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.510
 Likewise 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:20.120
 keep tightening 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.120
 cunning Maull few flights broke up and are 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.840
 It's always worthwhile where you still watch 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.610
 head under the placeholders at the Rother too 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:32.670
 again 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.930
 time and again she does not pull tight 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:36.460
 as I said 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:37.800
 and a little bit more 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.410
 so that's it 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.730
 as possible the deal is and not great and expected 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.700
 and higher 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.810
 Horn looks easy 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.090
 ashamed cellphone 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.740
 Thomas Schaaf marquee 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.570
 Daniel Rother turns up 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.570
 the KDA is not too rainy 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:01.810
 the urge 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.600
 the former hewlett-packard-boss 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.600
 the binding of the main engine 

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:12.759
 when i got completely out of this and who was during the flight 

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:16.129
 to avoid 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:17.369
 still a 

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:19.859
 additional worries which is nice 

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:22.189
 Wiemann is quite unsightly 

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:24.879
 surely have seen a few add 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:26.549
 that the 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:28.659
 the gear 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:31.659
 looks unsightly black 

00:02:32.649 --> 00:02:35.469
 I was in 

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:37.889
 Barnes 

00:02:37.889 --> 00:02:40.969
 Prop tourists are concerned with me accordingly 

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:44.719
 This fits 

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:48.589
 Distrust out 

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:51.549
 That's how it is with these residues 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:54.669
 from the flight of m entrance fee back 

00:02:57.219 --> 00:03:00.019
 corresponding 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:03.229
 to clean it 

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:05.819
 but it is clear that there is something longer 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:09.169
 but I definitely have 

00:03:09.169 --> 00:03:12.359
 here are provided is great 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:15.229
 from the drive concept of the summer 

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:18.679
 Wunsiedel not quite so unsightly 

00:03:18.679 --> 00:03:21.679
 90 definitely 

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:26.649
 to get so much 

00:03:26.649 --> 00:03:28.749
 two girls in the video 

00:03:28.749 --> 00:03:31.649
 but what helped you? 

00:03:31.649 --> 00:03:32.449
 Until next time
