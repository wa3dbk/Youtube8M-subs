00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
something because you know you hear

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.920 
something because you know you hear
notes<00:01:55.490> coming<00:01:55.820> out<00:01:56.060> all<00:01:56.270> over<00:01:56.300> the<00:01:56.509> place<00:01:56.750> and

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
notes coming out all over the place and

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.280 
notes coming out all over the place and
then<00:01:57.050> they<00:01:57.380> kind<00:01:57.590> of<00:01:57.619> wrap<00:01:57.860> around<00:01:58.220> you<00:01:58.430> but

00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.290 
then they kind of wrap around you but

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:04.150 
then they kind of wrap around you but
when<00:02:00.290> you<00:02:00.910> see<00:02:01.910> it<00:02:01.940> happen<00:02:02.509> live<00:02:02.869> you<00:02:03.500> get<00:02:03.740> to

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:04.160 
when you see it happen live you get to

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.859 
when you see it happen live you get to
really<00:02:04.460> watch<00:02:04.729> those<00:02:05.000> fingers<00:02:05.300> that<00:02:05.720> like

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
really watch those fingers that like

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:07.840 
really watch those fingers that like
lightning<00:02:06.350> on<00:02:06.530> there<00:02:06.680> then<00:02:06.800> you<00:02:06.920> realize<00:02:07.310> how

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
lightning on there then you realize how

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.000 
lightning on there then you realize how
difficult<00:02:08.420> it<00:02:08.869> is<00:02:08.989> but<00:02:09.440> there's<00:02:09.679> a<00:02:09.769> weird

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:10.010 
difficult it is but there's a weird

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:12.250 
difficult it is but there's a weird
dichotomy<00:02:10.190> there<00:02:10.880> David<00:02:11.540> Paul<00:02:11.720> makes<00:02:11.930> it<00:02:12.110> look

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
dichotomy there David Paul makes it look

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.009 
dichotomy there David Paul makes it look
easy<00:02:12.500> but<00:02:13.030> you<00:02:14.030> know<00:02:14.209> it<00:02:14.360> isn't<00:02:14.510> because

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:15.019 
easy but you know it isn't because

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:16.570 
easy but you know it isn't because
they're<00:02:15.470> too<00:02:15.680> many<00:02:15.860> notes<00:02:16.070> going<00:02:16.400> on

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
they're too many notes going on

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.060 
they're too many notes going on
underneath<00:02:17.000> those<00:02:17.330> fingers<00:02:17.750> to<00:02:17.959> be<00:02:18.440> easy<00:02:18.650> but

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
underneath those fingers to be easy but

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.150 
underneath those fingers to be easy but
somehow<00:02:19.370> you<00:02:19.610> just<00:02:19.880> so<00:02:20.330> relaxed<00:02:20.959> it<00:02:21.170> makes<00:02:21.320> its

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
somehow you just so relaxed it makes its

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.930 
somehow you just so relaxed it makes its
flow<00:02:22.989> very<00:02:23.989> easily<00:02:24.340> would<00:02:25.340> you<00:02:25.549> call<00:02:25.820> them

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
flow very easily would you call them

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
flow very easily would you call them
pretentious

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:28.960 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.470
