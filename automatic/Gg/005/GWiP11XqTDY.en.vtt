00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
and this 2d iphone game programming

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.240 
and this 2d iphone game programming
series<00:00:06.600> in<00:00:06.839> this<00:00:07.379> video<00:00:07.649> we<00:00:07.859> are<00:00:07.890> going<00:00:07.980> to

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
series in this video we are going to

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.520 
series in this video we are going to
actually<00:00:08.429> incorporate<00:00:09.030> our<00:00:09.480> game<00:00:09.990> data<00:00:10.230> class

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
actually incorporate our game data class

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.370 
actually incorporate our game data class
in<00:00:10.800> our<00:00:11.130> my<00:00:11.309> scene<00:00:11.639> implementation<00:00:12.480> file<00:00:12.660> so

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
in our my scene implementation file so

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.379 
in our my scene implementation file so
that<00:00:13.410> we<00:00:13.799> actually<00:00:13.950> get<00:00:14.429> this<00:00:14.730> high<00:00:15.059> score

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
that we actually get this high score

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.359 
that we actually get this high score
functionality<00:00:16.080> that<00:00:16.470> we<00:00:16.529> want<00:00:17.900> so<00:00:19.160> to<00:00:20.160> start

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
functionality that we want so to start

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.160 
functionality that we want so to start
we<00:00:20.550> are<00:00:20.640> going<00:00:20.850> to<00:00:21.060> go<00:00:21.449> into<00:00:21.720> our<00:00:21.869> my<00:00:21.990> scene

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
we are going to go into our my scene

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.599 
we are going to go into our my scene
implementation<00:00:22.740> file<00:00:22.890> we<00:00:23.220> are<00:00:23.279> going<00:00:23.490> to

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
implementation file we are going to

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.920 
implementation file we are going to
import<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.810> game<00:00:25.199> data<00:00:25.519> class<00:00:26.779> then<00:00:27.779> we're

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
import the game data class then we're

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.540 
import the game data class then we're
going<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.080> go<00:00:28.230> down<00:00:28.410> to<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.619> load<00:00:29.070> score

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
going to go down to the load score

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.269 
going to go down to the load score
labels<00:00:30.060> method<00:00:30.539> and<00:00:30.810> we<00:00:30.840> are<00:00:31.289> going<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:31.830> create

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
labels method and we are going to create

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:38.000 
labels method and we are going to create
a<00:00:32.489> new<00:00:32.820> game<00:00:33.149> data<00:00:33.510> object<00:00:35.780> so<00:00:36.800> we're<00:00:37.800> going<00:00:37.860> to

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
a new game data object so we're going to

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.130 
a new game data object so we're going to
just<00:00:38.129> call<00:00:38.370> this<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:39.030> van<00:00:39.600> issues<00:00:39.840> hearing

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
just call this a van issues hearing

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.930 
just call this a van issues hearing
theta<00:00:40.860> equals<00:00:41.460> game<00:00:41.820> data<00:00:42.770> data<00:00:43.770> now<00:00:44.670> I<00:00:44.700> don't

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
theta equals game data data now I don't

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.750 
theta equals game data data now I don't
think<00:00:45.090> we<00:00:45.180> actually<00:00:45.390> added<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:48.110> data

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
think we actually added the data

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.860 
think we actually added the data
constructor<00:00:50.760> here<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:51.059> our<00:00:51.180> header<00:00:51.360> files<00:00:51.629> so

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
constructor here to our header files so

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.930 
constructor here to our header files so
we<00:00:51.960> can't<00:00:52.170> call<00:00:52.230> that<00:00:52.559> yet<00:00:52.770> so<00:00:53.520> we're<00:00:53.640> going<00:00:53.789> to

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
we can't call that yet so we're going to

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.720 
we can't call that yet so we're going to
add<00:00:54.120> that<00:00:54.149> in<00:00:54.690> there<00:00:54.719> as<00:00:55.110> well<00:00:55.469> as<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:56.190> save

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
add that in there as well as the save

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.880 
add that in there as well as the save
and<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.960> load<00:00:58.350> method<00:00:58.730> so<00:00:59.730> we'll<00:00:59.820> do<00:00:59.910> save<00:01:00.300> and

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
and the load method so we'll do save and

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.270 
and the load method so we'll do save and
load<00:01:03.140> just<00:01:04.140> so<00:01:04.199> we<00:01:04.290> can<00:01:04.379> access<00:01:04.739> those<00:01:04.860> outside

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
load just so we can access those outside

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.760 
load just so we can access those outside
the<00:01:05.400> class<00:01:05.960> so<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:07.049> can<00:01:07.170> save<00:01:07.380> those<00:01:07.560> two

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
the class so you can save those two

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.000 
the class so you can save those two
things<00:01:07.979> go<00:01:08.369> into<00:01:08.729> my<00:01:09.270> scene<00:01:09.570> now<00:01:09.960> we<00:01:10.020> have<00:01:10.500> our

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
things go into my scene now we have our

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.450 
things go into my scene now we have our
game<00:01:11.520> data<00:01:11.820> load<00:01:12.119> it<00:01:12.240> up<00:01:12.360> so<00:01:13.260> now<00:01:14.189> that<00:01:14.220> we've

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
game data load it up so now that we've

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.440 
game data load it up so now that we've
initialized<00:01:14.880> our<00:01:15.390> data<00:01:15.570> object<00:01:16.020> with<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.290> load

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
initialized our data object with a load

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.840 
initialized our data object with a load
what<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.570> load<00:01:18.810> method<00:01:19.470> does<00:01:19.830> in<00:01:20.189> our<00:01:20.549> game

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
what the load method does in our game

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.260 
what the load method does in our game
data<00:01:21.119> class<00:01:21.750> is<00:01:22.110> it<00:01:22.530> loads<00:01:22.799> that<00:01:23.250> high<00:01:23.939> score

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
data class is it loads that high score

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.780 
data class is it loads that high score
property<00:01:27.590> from<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.770> data<00:01:28.950> file<00:01:29.220> so<00:01:29.520> we'll<00:01:29.670> do

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
property from the data file so we'll do

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.649 
property from the data file so we'll do
data<00:01:30.060> load<00:01:30.740> now<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:32.040> data<00:01:32.790> high<00:01:33.240> score

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
data load now the the data high score

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:39.140 
data load now the the data high score
property<00:01:34.369> should<00:01:35.369> have<00:01:35.790> um<00:01:37.460> that<00:01:38.460> data<00:01:38.790> loaded

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
property should have um that data loaded

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.700 
property should have um that data loaded
into<00:01:39.299> it<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:39.689> now<00:01:39.810> if<00:01:40.049> we<00:01:40.229> haven't<00:01:40.590> actually

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
into it and now if we haven't actually

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.649 
into it and now if we haven't actually
run<00:01:41.189> a<00:01:42.140> save<00:01:43.140> method<00:01:43.439> on<00:01:43.799> this<00:01:44.159> data<00:01:44.490> game<00:01:45.420> data

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
run a save method on this data game data

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.870 
run a save method on this data game data
class<00:01:45.960> on<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.259> data<00:01:47.009> high<00:01:47.340> score<00:01:47.610> method

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
class on the data high score method

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.609 
class on the data high score method
isn't<00:01:48.060> going<00:01:48.420> to<00:01:48.540> be<00:01:48.689> initialized<00:01:49.200> yet<00:01:49.470> but

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
isn't going to be initialized yet but

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.749 
isn't going to be initialized yet but
that's<00:01:49.710> okay<00:01:50.070> because<00:01:50.630> the<00:01:51.630> default

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
that's okay because the default

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:55.580 
that's okay because the default
initialization<00:01:53.759> is<00:01:53.939> 0<00:01:54.509> so<00:01:54.930> this<00:01:55.049> data<00:01:55.259> high

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
initialization is 0 so this data high

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.289 
initialization is 0 so this data high
score<00:01:55.890> is<00:01:55.979> just<00:01:56.159> going<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.399> be<00:01:56.490> 0<00:01:56.579> if<00:01:57.180> we

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
score is just going to be 0 if we

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.630 
score is just going to be 0 if we
haven't<00:01:57.630> called<00:01:57.840> that<00:01:58.079> save<00:01:58.320> method<00:01:58.530> yet<00:01:58.829> so

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
haven't called that save method yet so

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.800 
haven't called that save method yet so
we<00:01:59.759> don't<00:01:59.790> actually<00:02:00.000> have<00:02:00.210> to<00:02:00.329> set<00:02:00.570> that<00:02:00.689> to

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
we don't actually have to set that to

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.969 
we don't actually have to set that to
zero<00:02:00.840> at<00:02:01.200> any<00:02:01.350> point<00:02:01.939> so<00:02:02.939> now<00:02:02.969> we<00:02:03.270> can<00:02:03.920> go<00:02:04.920> to

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
zero at any point so now we can go to

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:05.990 
zero at any point so now we can go to
our<00:02:05.070> high<00:02:05.250> scorer<00:02:05.520> label<00:02:05.759> where<00:02:05.880> we

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
our high scorer label where we

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.040 
our high scorer label where we
initialized<00:02:06.479> it<00:02:06.689> we<00:02:06.869> can<00:02:07.229> initialize<00:02:08.099> it<00:02:09.050> we

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
initialized it we can initialize it we

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.400 
initialized it we can initialize it we
can<00:02:10.259> do<00:02:10.410> high<00:02:10.590> score<00:02:10.890> label<00:02:11.239> set<00:02:12.239> points

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
can do high score label set points

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.510 
can do high score label set points
to<00:02:13.800> data<00:02:14.430> high<00:02:15.060> score<00:02:15.450> so<00:02:15.780> now<00:02:15.960> whatever<00:02:16.860> is

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
to data high score so now whatever is

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.790 
to data high score so now whatever is
loaded<00:02:18.270> into<00:02:18.450> that<00:02:18.690> high<00:02:18.840> score<00:02:19.140> property<00:02:19.560> and

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
loaded into that high score property and

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.280 
loaded into that high score property and
our<00:02:20.100> game<00:02:20.700> data<00:02:20.910> class<00:02:21.180> is<00:02:21.390> going<00:02:21.540> to<00:02:21.720> go<00:02:21.930> and

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
our game data class is going to go and

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.290 
our game data class is going to go and
be<00:02:22.470> set<00:02:22.800> on<00:02:23.060> our<00:02:24.060> high<00:02:24.240> scorer<00:02:24.540> label<00:02:26.300> so

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
be set on our high scorer label so

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.300 
be set on our high scorer label so
awesome<00:02:28.140> now<00:02:28.500> we<00:02:28.560> need<00:02:28.650> to<00:02:28.770> actually<00:02:28.950> get<00:02:29.280> the

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
awesome now we need to actually get the

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.280 
awesome now we need to actually get the
data<00:02:29.730> to<00:02:29.970> save<00:02:30.270> so<00:02:30.720> we're<00:02:30.840> going<00:02:30.930> to<00:02:31.020> go<00:02:31.140> down

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
data to save so we're going to go down

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.670 
data to save so we're going to go down
to<00:02:31.530> the<00:02:31.560> game<00:02:31.950> over<00:02:32.250> method<00:02:33.140> which<00:02:34.140> jumps<00:02:34.530> into

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
to the game over method which jumps into

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.590 
to the game over method which jumps into
the<00:02:34.890> update<00:02:35.460> high<00:02:35.610> score<00:02:35.910> method<00:02:36.240> we're<00:02:36.570> going

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
the update high score method we're going

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.970 
the update high score method we're going
to<00:02:38.600> go<00:02:39.600> into<00:02:39.810> this<00:02:40.170> if<00:02:40.380> statement<00:02:40.500> right<00:02:40.920> here

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
to go into this if statement right here

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.950 
to go into this if statement right here
I'm<00:02:41.370> going<00:02:41.520> to<00:02:41.610> say<00:02:41.760> if<00:02:41.970> the<00:02:42.120> points<00:02:42.420> label<00:02:42.750> is

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
I'm going to say if the points label is

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.270 
I'm going to say if the points label is
higher<00:02:43.230> than<00:02:43.440> the<00:02:43.530> high<00:02:43.650> score<00:02:43.920> label

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
higher than the high score label

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.000 
higher than the high score label
remember<00:02:45.030> we<00:02:45.150> already<00:02:45.600> had<00:02:45.900> the<00:02:46.290> data<00:02:46.740> load

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
remember we already had the data load

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.590 
remember we already had the data load
into<00:02:47.220> the<00:02:47.340> high<00:02:47.460> score<00:02:47.850> label<00:02:48.210> so<00:02:48.360> we<00:02:48.450> don't

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
into the high score label so we don't

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.570 
into the high score label so we don't
have<00:02:48.720> to<00:02:48.810> actually<00:02:48.930> check<00:02:49.410> the<00:02:50.100> high<00:02:50.250> score

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
have to actually check the high score

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.030 
have to actually check the high score
outside<00:02:51.060> this<00:02:51.180> if<00:02:51.390> statement<00:02:51.510> just<00:02:51.900> yet<00:02:52.110> so<00:02:52.920> we

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
outside this if statement just yet so we

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.310 
outside this if statement just yet so we
can<00:02:53.190> do<00:02:53.370> this<00:02:53.940> and<00:02:54.270> so<00:02:54.480> if<00:02:54.630> it's<00:02:54.780> greater<00:02:54.990> we

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
can do this and so if it's greater we

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.170 
can do this and so if it's greater we
want<00:02:55.500> to<00:02:55.590> grab<00:02:55.890> that<00:02:56.310> game<00:02:56.580> date<00:02:56.760> again<00:02:57.030> so

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
want to grab that game date again so

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.810 
want to grab that game date again so
we're<00:02:57.270> going<00:02:57.360> to<00:02:57.450> initialize<00:02:57.630> new<00:02:58.020> object

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
we're going to initialize new object

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.570 
we're going to initialize new object
game<00:02:59.820> data<00:03:00.150> data<00:03:00.510> and<00:03:01.220> we're<00:03:02.220> going<00:03:02.340> to<00:03:02.400> do

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
game data data and we're going to do

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:10.760 
game data data and we're going to do
data<00:03:03.440> save<00:03:04.440> so<00:03:05.430> um<00:03:07.790> this<00:03:08.790> is<00:03:08.940> going<00:03:09.210> to<00:03:09.770> save

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
data save so um this is going to save

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.070 
data save so um this is going to save
the<00:03:11.010> high<00:03:11.190> score<00:03:11.490> and<00:03:11.640> our<00:03:11.760> data<00:03:11.940> object<00:03:12.420> to

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
the high score and our data object to

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.570 
the high score and our data object to
the<00:03:13.260> data<00:03:13.470> file<00:03:13.740> there's<00:03:14.040> one<00:03:14.190> more<00:03:14.340> thing<00:03:14.400> we

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
the data file there's one more thing we

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.520 
the data file there's one more thing we
need<00:03:14.640> to<00:03:14.730> do<00:03:14.940> though<00:03:15.120> that's<00:03:15.510> pretty<00:03:15.840> key<00:03:16.200> here

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
need to do though that's pretty key here

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.460 
need to do though that's pretty key here
we<00:03:16.710> need<00:03:16.800> to<00:03:16.860> set<00:03:17.220> the<00:03:17.370> data<00:03:17.550> as<00:03:17.700> high<00:03:17.850> score<00:03:18.470> to

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
we need to set the data as high score to

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.090 
we need to set the data as high score to
the<00:03:19.500> current<00:03:20.220> point<00:03:20.580> label<00:03:21.440> number<00:03:22.440> so<00:03:22.800> we're

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
the current point label number so we're

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.580 
the current point label number so we're
going<00:03:23.190> to<00:03:23.280> do<00:03:23.400> data<00:03:23.850> high<00:03:24.450> score<00:03:24.870> equals

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
going to do data high score equals

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.510 
going to do data high score equals
points<00:03:26.370> label<00:03:26.730> number<00:03:27.570> and<00:03:28.010> now<00:03:29.010> we<00:03:29.070> add<00:03:29.310> that

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:29.520 
points label number and now we add that

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.260 
points label number and now we add that
data<00:03:29.730> object<00:03:30.890> already<00:03:31.890> to<00:03:32.040> save<00:03:32.280> and<00:03:32.640> we're

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:33.270 
data object already to save and we're

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:36.160 
data object already to save and we're
good<00:03:33.390> to<00:03:33.510> go<00:03:33.540> so<00:03:34.070> now<00:03:35.070> we<00:03:35.130> can<00:03:35.340> run<00:03:35.580> this<00:03:35.760> and

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
good to go so now we can run this and

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.810 
good to go so now we can run this and
the<00:03:37.170> behavior<00:03:37.560> that<00:03:37.620> we<00:03:37.830> want<00:03:38.070> should<00:03:38.490> be

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
the behavior that we want should be

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.000 
the behavior that we want should be
working<00:03:39.390> here<00:03:39.660> it<00:03:39.810> says<00:03:39.959> data<00:03:40.260> is<00:03:40.470> null<00:03:40.709> here

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
working here it says data is null here

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.100 
working here it says data is null here
but<00:03:41.190> that's<00:03:41.340> okay<00:03:41.840> that's<00:03:42.840> what<00:03:42.959> I<00:03:42.989> was

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
but that's okay that's what I was

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:44.210 
but that's okay that's what I was
talking<00:03:43.260> about<00:03:43.470> how<00:03:43.739> it's<00:03:43.890> just<00:03:43.950> going<00:03:44.130> to<00:03:44.160> be

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
talking about how it's just going to be

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.100 
talking about how it's just going to be
initialized<00:03:44.730> at<00:03:44.970> zero<00:03:45.300> so<00:03:45.750> we're<00:03:45.840> going<00:03:45.930> to<00:03:46.020> at

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
initialized at zero so we're going to at

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:48.140 
initialized at zero so we're going to at
one<00:03:46.230> point<00:03:46.410> we're<00:03:47.250> going<00:03:47.340> to<00:03:47.430> die<00:03:47.550> the<00:03:47.610> high

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
one point we're going to die the high

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.960 
one point we're going to die the high
score<00:03:48.390> label<00:03:48.720> updates<00:03:49.680> itself<00:03:50.010> tap<00:03:50.520> to<00:03:50.640> reset

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
score label updates itself tap to reset

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.510 
score label updates itself tap to reset
and<00:03:51.209> it<00:03:52.200> looks<00:03:52.410> like<00:03:52.500> that<00:03:52.800> high<00:03:52.950> score<00:03:53.250> label

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:53.520 
and it looks like that high score label

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.540 
and it looks like that high score label
maintains<00:03:54.030> its<00:03:54.980> value<00:03:55.980> there<00:03:56.190> so<00:03:56.340> we<00:03:56.459> can

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:56.550 
maintains its value there so we can

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.640 
maintains its value there so we can
actually<00:03:56.730> get<00:03:57.630> even<00:03:57.870> change<00:03:58.110> that<00:03:58.290> we<00:03:58.350> can<00:03:58.500> get

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
actually get even change that we can get

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.710 
actually get even change that we can get
two<00:03:58.860> instead<00:03:59.280> of<00:03:59.340> one<00:03:59.430> it<00:04:00.090> updates<00:04:00.420> itself

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
two instead of one it updates itself

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.360 
two instead of one it updates itself
restart<00:04:01.290> and<00:04:01.470> the<00:04:01.560> high<00:04:01.680> score<00:04:02.040> is<00:04:02.160> still

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
restart and the high score is still

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.820 
restart and the high score is still
there<00:04:02.550> even<00:04:02.730> if<00:04:03.480> we<00:04:03.690> exit<00:04:04.140> out<00:04:04.260> of<00:04:04.320> this<00:04:04.530> and

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 
there even if we exit out of this and

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.040 
there even if we exit out of this and
like<00:04:04.980> pass<00:04:05.459> between<00:04:05.790> these<00:04:06.180> screens<00:04:06.600> so<00:04:06.900> that

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.050 
like pass between these screens so that

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.560
