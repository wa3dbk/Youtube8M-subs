00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:08.010
 The beautiful weather today not only killed the skier who killed too 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.730
 Footballers of FC Naters went high out before the game at least for 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.390
 final preparations, the players had come close after scarce above the 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.400
 Retired take a walk through the picturesque old mountain village as 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.449
 Motivation for the big game against St Gallen 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:28.449
 the ailing a-ligist 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:36.079
 rer in the cabin immediately before the match then coach Robert took over 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:41.670
 The scepter also with the amateurs had understandably the camera outside 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.670
 stay the Orion 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.150
 on the other side Hans Eichel celebrated his debut at FC St Gallen 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.630
 into the game after five minutes mistake at the first division 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.870
 Scheiber 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.720
 and mow a beard a damper out of tons almost 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.930
 the aspired early leadership will become fact 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.260
 from a class difference was in the initial phase little to see also Naters 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.260
 tried on the offensive 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:27.450
 to the advisory board nevertheless the small children did not have to overly too 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.310
 receive 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.640
 the warm sunbeams had the surface superficially we measured 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.540
 softened well-groomed combination football because today on the 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.520
 Start are not possible 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.609
 in the 27th minute the St Galler Meebo Mellor 

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:44.380
 that once for both the guests somehow 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:45.950
 it had suggested 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:51.090
 St Gallen had more chances to score before the start, no reason why 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.090
 The Valais is negotiating to set it at half mast 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:00.649
 in front of 1500 spectators St Gallen led the break with 1 0 NOFV Bad but everything 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:03.940
 possible for the second 45 minutes 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.640
 six minutes after the restart Eckball 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.640
 for St Gallen 

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:13.309
 writer 

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:16.169
 and Merenda the 2g to zero 

00:02:16.169 --> 00:02:18.640
 That's exactly what they wanted to prevent 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.360
 catching up with a two-goal residue is still compelling the animal 

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:28.909
 1 points and it services of course more than right 

00:02:30.919 --> 00:02:34.169
 to give up thinking the European election is far from over 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:41.579
 and in this action prevented 1-win 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:44.579
 Agosti it reactions the connection hit 

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:52.299
 As the game continued, the St Gallers were getting stronger 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:59.739
 the substitute even next to Bad the Nottie Schur defense to the dance 

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:03.870
 and then served with survey would be and a 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.429
 who could achieve his second goal 

00:03:06.429 --> 00:03:11.529
 Morena Merenda in the fall has hit the air like Bardot's 14 times now 

00:03:11.529 --> 00:03:14.949
 his goals St Gallen secure the National League a 

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:23.769
 then in the 78th minute Sascha MÃ¼ller put the final point under a book 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:26.769
 more or less one-sided game 

00:03:31.149 --> 00:03:35.249
 much to the Noll a clear thing for the St Galler has the excursion into 

00:03:35.249 --> 00:03:39.379
 Valais rewarded with progressing From now on, the whole concentration is the 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:41.629
 Get started league league 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:42.449
 every case 

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:46.549
 one has the impression it is much different at FC St Gallen than in the 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:49.309
 Autumn is not just the name of the coach 

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:50.959
 ambiguous feelings 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:54.299
 however, in the cabin at the KFC after that after the game 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:57.759
 Secretly one had already hoped for a little help 

00:03:57.759 --> 00:04:01.009
 I would love to have one in the autumn against today's opponent 

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.709
 played
