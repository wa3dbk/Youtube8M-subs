Volkswagen<00:02:02.140> motor<00:02:02.320> did<00:02:02.560> and<00:02:03.360> it's<00:02:04.360> gonna<00:02:04.570> be

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
Volkswagen motor did and it's gonna be

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.900 
Volkswagen motor did and it's gonna be
well<00:02:05.380> almost<00:02:05.890> double<00:02:06.280> the<00:02:06.340> horsepower

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:06.910 
well almost double the horsepower

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.440 
well almost double the horsepower

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
I believe the stock horsepower on the

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.740 
I believe the stock horsepower on the
the<00:02:11.140> 2.1<00:02:11.650> litre<00:02:12.130> Volkswagen<00:02:12.910> water<00:02:13.240> boxers

the 2.1 litre Volkswagen water boxers
are<00:02:17.970> right<00:02:18.970> at<00:02:19.120> 90<00:02:19.270> horsepower<00:02:19.570> and<00:02:20.140> the<00:02:20.650> 2.5

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
are right at 90 horsepower and the 2.5

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.240 
are right at 90 horsepower and the 2.5
liter<00:02:22.020> super<00:02:23.020> motor<00:02:23.290> is<00:02:23.650> going<00:02:23.950> to<00:02:24.010> be<00:02:24.100> at

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
liter super motor is going to be at

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.600 
liter super motor is going to be at
about<00:02:24.630> 166<00:02:25.630> horsepower<00:02:26.140> so<00:02:26.950> looking<00:02:27.340> forward

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
about 166 horsepower so looking forward

and I tell you what I really strive to

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.210 
and I tell you what I really strive to
to<00:03:45.970> keep<00:03:46.180> it<00:03:46.299> that<00:03:46.420> way<00:03:46.480> it<00:03:47.320> is<00:03:47.500> a<00:03:47.530> small<00:03:47.890> spot

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
to keep it that way it is a small spot

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.490 
to keep it that way it is a small spot
so<00:03:48.610> it<00:03:49.269> doesn't<00:03:49.630> take<00:03:49.750> much<00:03:49.959> to<00:03:50.110> get<00:03:50.200> cleared
