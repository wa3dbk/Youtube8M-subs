stamps is the varnish in the vonage we
have<00:01:31.630> about<00:01:31.930> forty<00:01:32.350> percent<00:01:32.380> of<00:01:33.010> chocolate

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:33.790 
have about forty percent of chocolate

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.260 
have about forty percent of chocolate
elements<00:01:34.330> that<00:01:34.810> this<00:01:35.020> will<00:01:35.260> give<00:01:35.470> the<00:01:35.500> spell

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
elements that this will give the spell

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.740 
elements that this will give the spell
another<00:01:37.270> important<00:01:37.900> element<00:01:38.080> for<00:01:38.590> the

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
another important element for the

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.780 
another important element for the
condition<00:01:40.750> of<00:01:40.930> the<00:01:41.080> paper<00:01:41.290> is<00:01:42.160> that<00:01:42.460> we<00:01:42.640> have

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.790 
condition of the paper is that we have

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.380 
condition of the paper is that we have
to<00:01:42.970> have<00:01:43.150> 51<00:01:43.960> percent<00:01:44.440> of<00:01:44.830> relative<00:01:45.670> humidity

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
to have 51 percent of relative humidity

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.860 
to have 51 percent of relative humidity
up<00:01:47.320> twenty<00:01:48.070> one<00:01:48.220> percent<00:01:48.370> centigrade<00:01:49.360> if<00:01:49.660> you

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:49.870 
up twenty one percent centigrade if you

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:51.750 
up twenty one percent centigrade if you
don't<00:01:50.080> have<00:01:50.260> those<00:01:50.440> conditions<00:01:50.800> it<00:01:51.430> will<00:01:51.610> be

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:51.760 
don't have those conditions it will be

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.730 
don't have those conditions it will be
very<00:01:51.940> difficult<00:01:52.090> to<00:01:52.660> put<00:01:53.110> the<00:01:53.200> paper<00:01:53.470> on

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
very difficult to put the paper on

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.010 
very difficult to put the paper on
machine<00:01:54.300> so<00:01:55.300> we<00:01:55.330> have<00:01:55.510> not<00:01:55.630> experienced<00:01:55.990> with

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
machine so we have not experienced with

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.600 
machine so we have not experienced with
chocolate<00:01:56.380> sense<00:01:56.590> and<00:01:56.770> we<00:01:56.860> also<00:01:56.979> did<00:01:57.250> a<00:01:57.280> panel

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
chocolate sense and we also did a panel

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.730 
chocolate sense and we also did a panel
research<00:01:57.970> with<00:01:58.810> consumers<00:01:59.290> two<00:01:59.410> different

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
research with consumers two different

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.040 
research with consumers two different
chocolate<00:02:00.010> sense<00:02:00.220> and<00:02:00.820> we<00:02:01.360> also<00:02:01.510> did<00:02:01.780> a<00:02:01.810> better

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.050 
chocolate sense and we also did a better

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.469 
chocolate sense and we also did a better
research<00:02:02.440> on<00:02:02.710> the<00:02:03.190> application<00:02:03.729> on<00:02:03.820> paper<00:02:04.060> so

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479 
research on the application on paper so

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:07.200 
research on the application on paper so
on<00:02:04.600> scratchansniff<00:02:04.960> and<00:02:05.760> also<00:02:06.760> look<00:02:06.940> at<00:02:07.030> which

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
on scratchansniff and also look at which

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.449 
on scratchansniff and also look at which
chocolate<00:02:07.720> sense<00:02:08.200> comes<00:02:08.740> the<00:02:08.979> best<00:02:09.190> off<00:02:09.399> the

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
chocolate sense comes the best off the

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:12.270 
chocolate sense comes the best off the
paper<00:02:09.910> and<00:02:10.410> we<00:02:11.410> also<00:02:11.560> looked<00:02:11.800> obviously<00:02:12.190> at

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
paper and we also looked obviously at

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.070 
paper and we also looked obviously at
the<00:02:12.370> quality<00:02:12.730> of<00:02:12.760> the<00:02:13.000> obvious<00:02:13.330> chocolate<00:02:13.900> and

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
the quality of the obvious chocolate and

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.830 
the quality of the obvious chocolate and
we<00:02:14.140> chose<00:02:14.320> a<00:02:14.380> black<00:02:14.800> chocolate<00:02:15.220> scent<00:02:15.610> and

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
we chose a black chocolate scent and

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:23.210 
we chose a black chocolate scent and
because<00:02:16.840> that's<00:02:17.020> it<00:02:17.980> has<00:02:18.520> a<00:02:19.090> quality<00:02:19.690> to<00:02:20.080> it

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.360 

stands<00:02:24.220> have<00:02:24.459> to<00:02:24.640> be<00:02:24.790> perfect<00:02:25.240> every<00:02:25.540> single

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
stands have to be perfect every single
