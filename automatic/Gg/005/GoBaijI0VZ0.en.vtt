00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.169 

from<00:00:00.359> the<00:00:00.450> very<00:00:00.630> beginning<00:00:01.250> the<00:00:02.250> iPad<00:00:03.000> was

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
from the very beginning the iPad was

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:05.360 
from the very beginning the iPad was
designed<00:00:03.629> to<00:00:03.840> be<00:00:03.959> very<00:00:04.410> powerful<00:00:04.770> very

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
designed to be very powerful very

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.560 
designed to be very powerful very
capable<00:00:06.259> but<00:00:07.259> also<00:00:07.940> remarkably<00:00:08.940> simple<00:00:09.269> to

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
capable but also remarkably simple to

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.390 
capable but also remarkably simple to
use<00:00:11.570> so<00:00:12.570> our<00:00:12.750> goal<00:00:13.049> was<00:00:13.679> to<00:00:13.860> take<00:00:14.040> all<00:00:14.219> the

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
use so our goal was to take all the

use so our goal was to take all the
amazing<00:00:14.790> things<00:00:15.059> that<00:00:15.870> you<00:00:16.049> can<00:00:16.230> do<00:00:16.350> the

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
amazing things that you can do the

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.830 
amazing things that you can do the
full-size<00:00:16.980> iPad<00:00:17.490> but<00:00:18.090> pack<00:00:18.390> them<00:00:18.570> into<00:00:18.720> a

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
full-size iPad but pack them into a

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.310 
full-size iPad but pack them into a
product<00:00:19.199> that<00:00:19.439> is<00:00:19.590> so<00:00:20.039> much<00:00:20.279> smaller<00:00:20.670> and

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:21.320 
product that is so much smaller and

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.259 
product that is so much smaller and
that's<00:00:22.320> what<00:00:22.590> we<00:00:22.710> did<00:00:22.949> with<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:23.640> new<00:00:23.880> iPad

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.650 
went back to the very beginning and we
took<00:02:05.410> the<00:02:05.619> time<00:02:05.950> to<00:02:06.580> design<00:02:06.910> a<00:02:06.970> product<00:02:07.390> that

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:07.660 
took the time to design a product that

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.680 
took the time to design a product that
was<00:02:08.020> a<00:02:08.220> concentration<00:02:09.220> of<00:02:09.340> not<00:02:09.970> a<00:02:10.000> reduction

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
was a concentration of not a reduction

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.340 
was a concentration of not a reduction
of<00:02:10.810> the<00:02:10.840> original<00:02:12.150> we<00:02:13.150> felt<00:02:13.450> strongly<00:02:13.870> that

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
of the original we felt strongly that

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.400 
of the original we felt strongly that
seven<00:02:15.160> point<00:02:15.430> nine<00:02:15.490> inches<00:02:16.090> was<00:02:16.750> exactly<00:02:17.320> the

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
seven point nine inches was exactly the

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.430 
seven point nine inches was exactly the
right<00:02:17.620> display<00:02:18.100> size<00:02:18.510> but<00:02:19.510> it<00:02:19.630> became<00:02:19.930> clear

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
right display size but it became clear

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.979 
right display size but it became clear
that<00:02:20.800> we<00:02:21.310> had<00:02:21.489> to<00:02:21.610> reduce<00:02:21.730> the<00:02:22.150> width<00:02:22.450> of<00:02:22.750> the

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
that we had to reduce the width of the

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:25.530 
that we had to reduce the width of the
borders<00:02:23.410> so<00:02:23.950> you<00:02:24.280> can<00:02:24.520> still<00:02:24.850> pick<00:02:25.090> it<00:02:25.239> up<00:02:25.390> and

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
borders so you can still pick it up and

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.820 
borders so you can still pick it up and
easily<00:02:25.959> use<00:02:26.170> it<00:02:26.350> with<00:02:26.500> one<00:02:26.650> hand<00:02:28.800> we<00:02:29.800> have
