00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 Hello everyone and thanks for having decided to 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.569
 listen to a new minute review 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.500
 today's game is a game that is maybe 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.570
 unknown to most 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.730
 I discovered it by chance looking at the 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.190
 dai sauer channel so thank you i 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.460
 guys for this and i'll talk about nan 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.960
 will break through a game for 28 players of the 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.439
 lasts about an hour 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.869
 the game is a kind of scott layard on 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:28.289
 steroids invented by frédéric boyer sel 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.420
 how the idea works is that six o'clock 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.460
 novices in the night go and look for i 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.809
 their secret desires that can be one 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.730
 letter from mother rather than one 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.180
 bottle of brandy looking for it 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.980
 peck from the two upper mothers who 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.290
 they will listen and watch carefully 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.899
 all areas of the monastery 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.760
 let's see the purpose of the novices and 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.309
 find your own yes that trichet 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.379
 through a couple more key 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.940
 box in which it is hidden and return 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.710
 in his own cell without being seen 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.809
 marking the moves on the appropriate 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.670
 small sheets supplied may 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.500
 move with different speeds every 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.180
 speed from a bonus on noise what 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.280
 it means after the move is launched 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.310
 for all a common die noise in 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.080
 this case is made a 55 less than any 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.939
 bonus is the distance to which mothers 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.159
 upper dislocated on the bridge 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.810
 They can hear noises since 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.210
 there is a noise a script is placed 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.670
 on the box to indicate a direction 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.130
 where to look for fugitives 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.869
 let's say and mother superior instead yes 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.030
 they have to move along the previous ones 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.320
 predefined patrols let's say so in 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.119
 this case from your cell to 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.979
 garden gate its own cell falls 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.930
 kitchen kitchen once finished 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.820
 paths may be combined with others 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.590
 to go around when mothers 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.939
 higher hear noises can 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.920
 leave the path to go to 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.840
 search for fugitives may also 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.700
 them to walk and move 3 or 4 e 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.979
 then listen after the movement 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.079
 or run 56 but not move 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.210
 being able to hear what they do though 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.220
 sweeping the area during movement 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.250
 they are careful how the walls are set 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.659
 and the doors to see novices in the 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.759
 time when the top mothers 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.340
 they catch a number of news around 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.659
 equal to the number of players 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.960
 win the moment the game 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.119
 tough 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.560
 fifteen shifts the constraint always the 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.910
 top mothers the first player 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.619
 instead that satisfies your own 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.080
 he feels around in his own cell is 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.550
 the sole winner of the match the 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.280
 The game's strength is definitely 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.110
 the setting and there are several rules 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.090
 so maybe one novice can do it 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.350
 feel a little lost but if you start 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.480
 reason to have in terms of 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.800
 escape not being seen and staying 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.840
 back no noise 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.450
 in reality it will definitely play right 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.430
 all that is coherent the look i 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.200
 noises the fact that if you run you don't 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.620
 feels noise or vice versa becomes more 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.050
 noise 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.880
 in short, everything is made very well 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.470
 blessing cards are added to that 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.959
 they are a little bit of small bonus feces 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.090
 one shot to be used only once for either 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.650
 the superiors who for the novices in 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.630
 he could not even be there 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.080
 they serve to add a pinch of 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.450
 black 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.640
 the game is fun is my point 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.560
 of view is that the more you play the more you 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.030
 novices become good at the beginning 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.700
 they will have this feeling of being 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:02.310
 however always hunted but as and 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.319
 play will always have more ideas for 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:07.080
 to sneak to sneak to give 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:09.870
 nuisance to search therefore more games 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.760
 better done and you will surely have a 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.350
 successfully put on the table until 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.600
 be a dumb no player who has 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.549
 said brown study with which it is therefore 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.180
 thumb up for manzon the run 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:20.180
 Hello
