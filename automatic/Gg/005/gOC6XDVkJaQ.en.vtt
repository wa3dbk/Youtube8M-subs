yellowish<00:02:33.010> is<00:02:33.730> because<00:02:34.030> the<00:02:34.180> alkalinity<00:02:34.630> of

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
yellowish is because the alkalinity of

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.809 
yellowish is because the alkalinity of
the<00:02:35.140> Consul<00:02:35.739> we<00:02:35.830> actually<00:02:36.069> changes<00:02:36.489> the

the Consul we actually changes the

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:39.180 
the Consul we actually changes the

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
proteins in the flour and it makes it

00:02:39.190 --> 00:03:19.070 
proteins in the flour and it makes it
firmer<00:02:39.459> and<00:02:39.790> chewier

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080
