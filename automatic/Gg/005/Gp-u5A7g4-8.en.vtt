00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:20.999
 hello today we will realize 

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:23.310
 a walk-in shower on floor 

00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:24.929
 wood so with our partner shooter 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.210
 system we have a whole set 

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:29.039
 specific elements for this 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.040
 function so first of all we have 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.110
 achieved completed being whose floor and 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.410
 in the overall plan for the development of 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.020
 the House 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:53.730
 the siphon and the 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:56.850
 bomb from below no woman louise 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:00.110
 goal set on the muli joisting we realize 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.110
 a peripheral seal 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.930
 so we're going to make a protection zone 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.220
 to water and so with a pose of 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.110
 tiling and that's why you 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.090
 see the implementation here of the mat 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:25.270
 said rats that allows the laying of tiles 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:28.149
 on plan is then seen for the walls 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.789
 verticals receiving faience so in 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:32.289
 dtu one has the obligation to make the 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:32.950
 waterproof support so here it's a 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:34.720
 plasterboard 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.090
 there are different systems and there we want 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.619
 also use the cardy note that 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.630
 covers all the walls that go 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:43.289
 to receive a faience so as to have 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.289
 one and in china 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.450
 so in this bathroom where we have 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:53.680
 placed the walk-in shower 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:56.390
 there was a parquet flooring 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:02:00.290
 so we realized a range of 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.520
 anti-slip tile protection that 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.280
 makes the connection with a day 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.259
 especially with the shower tray in 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.100
 shape of slope 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:08.600
 so well now I leave you 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.080
 I will take my shower then at 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.080
 next construction site
