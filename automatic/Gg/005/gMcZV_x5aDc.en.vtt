00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:13.410
 to version 4.75 released last 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:17.039
 week is based on cyanogenmod e 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:20.189
 on the 10 cm kernel and therefore the version of 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.810
 jelly beans in 4.2.2 we see in the menu 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.150
 of the settings so that one 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.279
 classic of pure android we have 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.949
 interface the ability to modify 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.660
 the launcher that the 3 bush and then 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.480
 we can modify the screen of the 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.250
 home lab trower the doc and in general 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.960
 we can activate deactivate the 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.540
 screen rotation lock the 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.899
 home screen and activate mode a 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.489
 full screen in lock screen 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.860
 we can choose the screen of 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.010
 security choose the background 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.890
 whether to display the battery status 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:55.500
 I always only have it when it is in charge 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.600
 change the clock widget 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:02.010
 unlock shortcuts for ours 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:04.559
 padlock and actions of the theme buttons 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.119
 downloadable both from the play store and from 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.689
 internet as we have seen for others 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.939
 rom to usp little bug in this section 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:15.119
 when we apply a Roma theme between 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:18.210
 grows a moment but still applies the 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:21.750
 therefore a minor issue because 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.280
 does not give us no problems in the system 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.320
 we can modify the status bar 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.689
 then decide whether to show it show 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.880
 the watch choose the indicator style 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.860
 of the battery the signal style 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.710
 we can activate the control of 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.630
 brightness practically dragging the 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.549
 finger on our status bar 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.740
 we can increase or decrease the 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:44.549
 brightness of our display and we can 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.409
 activate the founder of notifications in 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.990
 quick settings panels 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.060
 let's change our tiles 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.200
 so we can decide the number e 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:57.350
 which display the moti menu 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.850
 notifications we can activate the widgets of 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.369
 power that is these here that 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.409
 we can display in the menu of 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.250
 notifications here too we can choose 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:10.410
 which to display how many to view 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.120
 extended desktop then we have menu of 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.010
 then turn on our menu of 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.560
 power on 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:18.260
 extended we can always choose what 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.849
 view clock widget as 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.030
 we were in the lock screen 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:25.280
 physical keys 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.900
 the rom I must say that in mine 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.430
 days of testing really behaved 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.810
 very well but never gave me 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.230
 no problem whatsoever 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:36.620
 it's about starting stunts it 's always 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:39.019
 was very fast and responsive 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:42.500
 I also liked the fact that the 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:44.239
 battery really lasts so much 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.159
 I show you the maximum duration that 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:49.909
 they managed to get to get a 

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:54.139
 day one hour 24 minutes with average use 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:55.849
 of the terminal instead stressed but 

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:57.920
 really very stressed as I had 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:03:01.579
 made with flora the success at 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:04.459
 get to give me 8 hours of autonomy 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:07.760
 let's talk about the camera camera 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:12.590
 really very good the photos are are 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:14.349
 always a lot are never blurred 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.879
 shots as you have seen are fast 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:20.060
 many settings regarding 

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:22.849
 the latter as you can see we have 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:25.389
 also the possibility of making one 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:31.489
 voice click function that of the times 

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:34.910
 let's go see if it goes now shoot now is 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:37.459
 gone so as you see sometimes goes 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:38.989
 sometimes it doesn't go even if the times you 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:41.530
 it didn't go they were really a lot 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:45.260
 a few therefore the function works 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:48.109
 quite good possibility to do the 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:50.030
 photo in hdr but photo features that 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:52.760
 as I have also seen in other Roma not 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:56.440
 ok we can't do sfeir photos 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.440
 we can take panoramic photos 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.519
 I'll show you what we find in the Roma 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.709
 when we install it we find that the 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:06.130
 apollo audio player we find a 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:08.980
 vocal composer the version 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:11.740
 the donetz section where we can do one 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:17.980
 donation for the Roma developer 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:22.390
 dsp manager a terminal emulator then 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:23.200
 we find the check that would be the 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:27.370
 pai control 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:29.140
 as we saw on the paranoid 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.220
 we find a torch and we find 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.200
 Roma sentiment 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.640
 update where we can go to 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.710
 check to check the 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:37.720
 updates for our Roma 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.910
 I also show you the score that 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:43.150
 got this rom with antutu 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:47.620
 benckmark 9,500 68 score enough 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:50.130
 low compared to the other newspapers but 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.880
 score that did not turn out to be such 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:55.180
 in the use because it is really the Rome 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:57.580
 she always behaved very well well 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.200
 for today it's all I remind you of 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.760

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.070
