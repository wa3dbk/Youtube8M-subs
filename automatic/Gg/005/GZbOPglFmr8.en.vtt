shadow<00:01:14.490> brush<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.600> I<00:01:16.259> really<00:01:16.590> like<00:01:16.830> all<00:01:17.100> three

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
shadow brush and I really like all three

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.880 
shadow brush and I really like all three
of<00:01:17.549> these<00:01:17.700> I<00:01:17.759> think<00:01:18.030> they're<00:01:18.240> so<00:01:18.750> soft<00:01:19.200> to<00:01:19.860> the

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
of these I think they're so soft to the

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.149 
of these I think they're so soft to the
touch<00:01:20.009> and<00:01:20.640> they<00:01:21.360> do<00:01:21.420> blend<00:01:22.140> really<00:01:22.439> well<00:01:22.619> I've

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
touch and they do blend really well I've

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.370 
touch and they do blend really well I've
tried<00:01:23.369> all<00:01:23.700> three<00:01:23.909> of<00:01:24.090> them<00:01:24.299> and<00:01:24.509> I<00:01:25.080> especially

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
tried all three of them and I especially

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.070 
tried all three of them and I especially
am<00:01:25.950> excited<00:01:26.490> about<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.850> two-faced<00:01:27.420> brushes

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
am excited about the two-faced brushes

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.810 
am excited about the two-faced brushes
because<00:01:28.500> these<00:01:28.770> are<00:01:28.920> just<00:01:28.950> so<00:01:29.250> dense<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:29.759> so

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
because these are just so dense and so

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.910 
because these are just so dense and so
packed<00:01:30.240> with<00:01:30.479> bristles<00:01:31.020> while<00:01:31.439> at<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.680> same

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
packed with bristles while at the same

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.469 
packed with bristles while at the same
time<00:01:32.220> being<00:01:32.460> really<00:01:32.579> soft<00:01:33.000> that<00:01:33.150> they<00:01:33.240> do<00:01:33.360> a

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
time being really soft that they do a

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.270 
time being really soft that they do a
really<00:01:33.810> good<00:01:33.990> job<00:01:34.049> of<00:01:34.350> blending<00:01:34.979> powder

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
really good job of blending powder

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.490 
really good job of blending powder
foundation<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.119> powder<00:01:36.390> blush<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:37.290> then

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
foundation and powder blush and then

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.140 
foundation and powder blush and then
this<00:01:37.619> eye<00:01:37.829> shadow<00:01:37.860> brush<00:01:38.490> I've<00:01:38.759> been<00:01:38.939> using

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
this eye shadow brush I've been using

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.690 
this eye shadow brush I've been using
both<00:01:39.450> for<00:01:39.689> applying<00:01:40.110> eyeshadow<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:41.070> for

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
both for applying eyeshadow and for

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.460 
both for applying eyeshadow and for
blending<00:01:42.060> it<00:01:42.180> out<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:42.720> I<00:01:42.810> find<00:01:43.110> that<00:01:43.170> it<00:01:43.320> works

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
blending it out and I find that it works

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.649 
blending it out and I find that it works
really<00:01:43.710> well<00:01:43.799> too<00:01:44.159> now<00:01:44.909> aside<00:01:45.210> from<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.420> three

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
really well too now aside from the three

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
foundation so it was really nice for me

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.179 
foundation so it was really nice for me
to<00:02:00.509> get<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:00.780> try<00:02:01.079> these<00:02:01.140> out<00:02:01.530> and<00:02:01.770> test<00:02:02.009> them

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
to get to try these out and test them

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.760 
to get to try these out and test them
out<00:02:02.280> and<00:02:02.340> see<00:02:02.610> how<00:02:02.759> they<00:02:02.880> work<00:02:03.149> and<00:02:03.530> first<00:02:04.530> of

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
out and see how they work and first of

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.550 
out and see how they work and first of
all<00:02:04.890> there<00:02:05.310> is<00:02:05.549> a<00:02:05.909> mineral<00:02:06.509> foundation<00:02:07.110> and<00:02:07.500> a

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
all there is a mineral foundation and a

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.339 
all there is a mineral foundation and a
mineral<00:02:07.890> blush<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.700> these<00:02:09.030> are<00:02:09.239> both<00:02:09.479> matte

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
mineral blush and these are both matte

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:11.570 
mineral blush and these are both matte
they<00:02:10.739> don't<00:02:10.890> have<00:02:11.039> any

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
they don't have any

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.790 
they don't have any
to<00:02:11.910> them<00:02:12.090> so<00:02:12.720> this<00:02:12.870> foundation<00:02:13.410> goes<00:02:13.590> on

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
to them so this foundation goes on

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.520 
to them so this foundation goes on
really<00:02:14.010> nice<00:02:14.310> and<00:02:14.640> smooth<00:02:15.090> and<00:02:15.510> it's<00:02:16.230> not<00:02:16.500> a

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
really nice and smooth and it's not a

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.350 
really nice and smooth and it's not a
full-coverage<00:02:17.370> it's<00:02:17.760> sort<00:02:17.940> of<00:02:18.030> more<00:02:18.180> like<00:02:18.240> a

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
full-coverage it's sort of more like a

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.390 
full-coverage it's sort of more like a
medium<00:02:18.810> coverage<00:02:19.080> so<00:02:19.830> what<00:02:19.920> it<00:02:20.010> does<00:02:20.130> is<00:02:20.280> it

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
medium coverage so what it does is it

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.890 
medium coverage so what it does is it
evens<00:02:20.670> out<00:02:20.730> your<00:02:20.790> skin<00:02:20.910> tone<00:02:21.210> while<00:02:21.600> still

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
evens out your skin tone while still

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.660 
evens out your skin tone while still
letting<00:02:21.990> your<00:02:22.230> natural<00:02:22.590> skin<00:02:22.830> show<00:02:23.040> through

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
letting your natural skin show through

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.700 
letting your natural skin show through
now<00:02:24.030> this<00:02:24.270> blush<00:02:24.690> actually<00:02:25.170> works<00:02:25.380> really

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
now this blush actually works really

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.560 
now this blush actually works really
well<00:02:25.980> for<00:02:26.040> my<00:02:26.340> skin<00:02:26.670> tone<00:02:26.850> because<00:02:27.240> it<00:02:27.390> has

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
well for my skin tone because it has

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.350 
well for my skin tone because it has
more<00:02:27.780> of<00:02:27.960> a<00:02:28.080> peachy<00:02:28.860> coral<00:02:29.430> e<00:02:29.550> ton<00:02:29.790> to<00:02:30.030> it<00:02:30.150> than

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
more of a peachy coral e ton to it than

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.720 
more of a peachy coral e ton to it than
a<00:02:30.390> true<00:02:30.750> pink<00:02:31.410> tone<00:02:31.800> to<00:02:32.040> it<00:02:32.070> which<00:02:32.400> as<00:02:32.640> I

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
a true pink tone to it which as I

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.150 
a true pink tone to it which as I
mentioned<00:02:32.760> before<00:02:33.450> I<00:02:33.690> think<00:02:33.990> that<00:02:34.380> more<00:02:35.010> of<00:02:35.100> a

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
mentioned before I think that more of a

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.950 
mentioned before I think that more of a
peachy<00:02:35.580> coral<00:02:35.970> color<00:02:36.240> works<00:02:36.540> better<00:02:36.720> if<00:02:36.900> you

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
peachy coral color works better if you

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.050 
peachy coral color works better if you
have<00:02:37.260> skin<00:02:37.590> that<00:02:37.620> has<00:02:37.860> more<00:02:38.040> golden<00:02:38.490> or<00:02:38.760> yellow

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
have skin that has more golden or yellow

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.990 
have skin that has more golden or yellow
tones<00:02:39.720> to<00:02:39.990> it<00:02:40.020> rather<00:02:40.350> than<00:02:40.500> pink<00:02:41.220> tones<00:02:41.520> to<00:02:41.850> it

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
tones to it rather than pink tones to it

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.120 
tones to it rather than pink tones to it
