00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
that most binders won't go over two

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.359 
that most binders won't go over two
inches<00:01:26.479> maybe<00:01:27.229> two<00:01:27.530> and<00:01:27.649> a<00:01:27.710> half<00:01:27.920> inches

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369

want to lug around a book that big
anyway<00:01:33.069> the<00:01:34.069> reverse<00:01:34.340> of<00:01:34.369> this<00:01:34.640> is<00:01:34.819> that

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:34.939 
anyway the reverse of this is that

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:36.910 
anyway the reverse of this is that
you're<00:01:35.090> going<00:01:35.209> to<00:01:35.270> be<00:01:35.420> paying<00:01:35.689> per<00:01:36.020> volume<00:01:36.259> so

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
you're going to be paying per volume so

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.279 
you're going to be paying per volume so
if<00:01:37.039> you<00:01:37.130> make<00:01:37.280> the<00:01:37.399> volumes<00:01:37.789> too<00:01:38.030> small<00:01:38.479> the

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:39.289 
if you make the volumes too small the

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:41.399 
if you make the volumes too small the
bill<00:01:39.469> is<00:01:39.619> going<00:01:39.740> to<00:01:39.799> add<00:01:39.979> up<00:01:40.189> very<00:01:40.219> quickly

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:41.409 
bill is going to add up very quickly

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:43.899 
bill is going to add up very quickly
generally<00:01:42.409> I<00:01:42.590> like<00:01:42.950> to<00:01:43.100> stick<00:01:43.369> with<00:01:43.429> about

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
generally I like to stick with about

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:47.260 
generally I like to stick with about
twenty<00:01:44.840> four<00:01:45.109> issues<00:01:45.500> per<00:01:45.829> volume<00:01:46.119> let's<00:01:47.119> look

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
twenty four issues per volume let's look

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.389 
twenty four issues per volume let's look
at<00:01:47.390> you<00:01:47.509> about<00:01:47.659> a<00:01:47.810> one<00:01:48.170> and<00:01:48.200> a<00:01:48.380> half<00:01:48.590> to<00:01:49.189> two

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:49.399 
at you about a one and a half to two

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:51.969 
at you about a one and a half to two
inch<00:01:49.609> spine<00:01:50.140> perfectly<00:01:51.140> manageable<00:01:51.470> in<00:01:51.860> my

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
inch spine perfectly manageable in my

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:54.399 
inch spine perfectly manageable in my
opinion<00:01:52.489> but<00:01:53.329> since<00:01:53.569> comics<00:01:53.959> vary<00:01:54.200> in<00:01:54.380> length

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 
opinion but since comics vary in length

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:56.139 
opinion but since comics vary in length
and<00:01:55.009> you<00:01:55.069> probably<00:01:55.429> don't<00:01:55.700> want<00:01:55.880> to<00:01:55.909> break<00:01:56.119> up

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:56.149 
and you probably don't want to break up

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:57.880 
and you probably don't want to break up
volumes<00:01:56.689> right<00:01:56.899> in<00:01:57.049> the<00:01:57.110> middle<00:01:57.289> of<00:01:57.469> a<00:01:57.560> story

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
volumes right in the middle of a story

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.089 
volumes right in the middle of a story
there's<00:01:58.700> really<00:01:58.819> no<00:01:59.030> perfect<00:01:59.569> length<00:01:59.979> but<00:02:00.979> if

00:02:01.089 --> 00:02:01.099 
there's really no perfect length but if

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:04.660 
there's really no perfect length but if
you<00:02:01.189> set<00:02:01.399> them<00:02:01.520> up<00:02:01.700> first<00:02:01.969> like<00:02:02.270> this<00:02:03.429> you<00:02:04.429> can

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
you set them up first like this you can

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.339 
you set them up first like this you can
make<00:02:04.759> the<00:02:04.909> necessary<00:02:05.060> changes<00:02:05.390> needed<00:02:06.079> to<00:02:06.200> get

00:02:06.339 --> 00:02:06.349 
make the necessary changes needed to get

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:11.709 
make the necessary changes needed to get
your<00:02:06.500> books<00:02:06.679> at<00:02:06.860> an<00:02:06.950> even<00:02:07.219> length

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:11.719 

00:02:11.719 --> 00:02:13.880 

once<00:02:12.719> you<00:02:12.840> have<00:02:12.989> your<00:02:13.109> piles<00:02:13.349> straightened

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
once you have your piles straightened
