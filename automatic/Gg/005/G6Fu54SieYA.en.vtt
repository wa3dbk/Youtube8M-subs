00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
one that came in the box it's a tiny bit

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.700 
one that came in the box it's a tiny bit
bigger<00:02:14.490> but<00:02:15.210> this<00:02:15.360> seems<00:02:15.690> just<00:02:16.080> fine<00:02:16.140> for<00:02:16.560> now

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
bigger but this seems just fine for now

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.010 
bigger but this seems just fine for now
I<00:02:16.920> just<00:02:17.790> got<00:02:18.270> this<00:02:18.390> in<00:02:18.450> the<00:02:18.660> middle<00:02:18.870> this

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
I just got this in the middle this

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:24.020 
I just got this in the middle this
battery<00:02:19.440> I<00:02:20.870> just<00:02:21.870> showing<00:02:22.260> you<00:02:22.610> and<00:02:23.610> there<00:02:23.850> we

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
battery I just showing you and there we

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.850 
battery I just showing you and there we
go

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
go

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.620 
go
there<00:02:25.860> it<00:02:26.040> is<00:02:26.100> in<00:02:26.400> it<00:02:26.550> you<00:02:26.790> can<00:02:27.090> put<00:02:27.330> down<00:02:27.480> the

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
there it is in it you can put down the

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.900 
there it is in it you can put down the
little<00:02:27.780> latch<00:02:28.050> this<00:02:29.010> thing<00:02:29.310> can<00:02:29.610> you<00:02:29.790> can

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
little latch this thing can you can

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.060 
little latch this thing can you can
either<00:02:30.090> flop<00:02:30.390> it<00:02:31.020> over<00:02:31.110> the<00:02:31.380> flop<00:02:31.620> around<00:02:31.770> you

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
either flop it over the flop around you

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.700 
either flop it over the flop around you
can<00:02:32.190> stick<00:02:32.430> underneath<00:02:32.790> that<00:02:33.030> little<00:02:33.300> bar<00:02:33.710> but

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
can stick underneath that little bar but

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.290 
can stick underneath that little bar but
for<00:02:35.220> right<00:02:35.340> now<00:02:35.400> understand<00:02:35.940> run<00:02:36.060> it<00:02:36.180> like

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
for right now understand run it like

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.550 
for right now understand run it like
this<00:02:37.310> hopefully<00:02:38.310> I'll<00:02:38.370> get<00:02:38.520> to<00:02:38.580> test<00:02:38.910> it<00:02:39.060> out

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
this hopefully I'll get to test it out

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.000 
this hopefully I'll get to test it out
maybe<00:02:40.560> tomorrow<00:02:40.860> about<00:02:41.460> to<00:02:41.580> charge<00:02:41.850> it<00:02:42.060> up

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
maybe tomorrow about to charge it up

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.780 
maybe tomorrow about to charge it up
again<00:02:44.570> I<00:02:45.570> got<00:02:45.720> this<00:02:45.900> idea<00:02:46.080> from<00:02:46.440> Dart<00:02:46.800> ecliptic

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
again I got this idea from Dart ecliptic

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.510 
again I got this idea from Dart ecliptic
hard<00:02:48.030> I<00:02:48.180> believe<00:02:48.540> is<00:02:48.660> his<00:02:48.780> name<00:02:49.020> and<00:02:49.340> again<00:02:50.340> the

hard I believe is his name and again the

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.430 
hard I believe is his name and again the
battery<00:02:50.850> is<00:02:51.060> the<00:02:51.570> djinns<00:02:51.870> ace<00:02:52.050> and<00:02:52.320> the

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
battery is the djinns ace and the

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.800 
battery is the djinns ace and the
description<00:02:52.920> bar<00:02:53.100> below<00:02:53.130> I<00:02:53.700> will<00:02:54.450> have<00:02:54.630> the

he does and I like his idea and he does
just<00:03:00.090> two<00:03:00.240> upgrades<00:03:00.750> brung<00:03:01.200> them<00:03:01.290> to<00:03:01.440> the
