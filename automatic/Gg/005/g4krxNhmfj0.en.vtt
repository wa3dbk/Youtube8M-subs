we're<00:02:03.300> ready<00:02:03.479> to<00:02:03.570> set<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.080> temperature<00:02:04.380> I'm

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
we're ready to set the temperature I'm

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.719 
we're ready to set the temperature I'm
going<00:02:05.610> to<00:02:05.700> put<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:05.970> cooking<00:02:06.360> grid<00:02:06.630> on<00:02:06.810> and

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
going to put the cooking grid on and

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.630 
going to put the cooking grid on and
close<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:09.240> lid<00:02:09.530> at<00:02:10.530> this<00:02:10.920> point<00:02:11.220> I'm<00:02:11.400> going<00:02:11.580> to

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
close the lid at this point I'm going to

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.510 
close the lid at this point I'm going to
open<00:02:11.910> up<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.150> top<00:02:12.450> vent<00:02:12.810> entirely<00:02:13.470> and<00:02:13.890> you

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
open up the top vent entirely and you

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.820 
open up the top vent entirely and you
can<00:02:14.670> watch<00:02:14.850> very<00:02:15.120> carefully<00:02:15.360> the<00:02:16.290> temperature

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
can watch very carefully the temperature

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.250 
can watch very carefully the temperature

venting if we want to go low and slow
we're<00:02:24.660> going<00:02:24.780> to<00:02:24.840> adjust<00:02:25.230> both<00:02:25.590> the<00:02:25.800> bottom

we're going to adjust both the bottom

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.360 
we're going to adjust both the bottom
and<00:02:26.489> top<00:02:27.060> bets<00:02:27.440> fairly<00:02:28.440> tight<00:02:28.739> to<00:02:28.980> restrict

steak at a high temperature I'm going to

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.080
