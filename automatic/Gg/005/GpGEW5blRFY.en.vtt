 horses and called z of 3 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:31.210
 we will discover the latter in the chapter

 Box pk 6 has been modified to accept 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:01.120
 the important torque of the motor z of 3 of 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:04.210
 this way the piÃ±onerÃ­a has been optimized 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:06.690
 and a spherical differential has been adopted 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:09.820
 the oil level is carried out by 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:16.030
