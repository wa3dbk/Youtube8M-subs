00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:13.219
 I start brushing the hair 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:14.990
 and then I'm going to commit both sides 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:17.210
 this can be a braid but you can 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.250
 also easily make a loose braid 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:22.490
 who are not necessarily stuck to the 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:24.380
 government I do it this way I do 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.699
 I'm not very good at it 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.699
 but it is already possible to do it 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:37.320
 learning is only finished I attach it 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.460
 with an elastic band 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.750
 and then I start on the other side 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.750
 therefore we are exactly the same 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:55.040
 so I grab all the hair together 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.020
 including the braids and here I make 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.970
 a low ponytail from 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.460
 I can still do that so there is no crazy 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:04.070
 bumps in the partner will start 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.770
 sit and then I tighten everything well 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:10.490
 fixed with an elastic band 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:12.470
 what i do then is the rubber band something 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.320
 pull down 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.340
 like here and then i make in space 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.580
 upwards 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:23.850
 I'll make you a hundred this 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:27.750
 and what you do then is the pair set 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:30.930
 and I will go from above 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:34.080
 pull through the gauze like a 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.260
 spring and I tighten it just as well 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.260
 to 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:47.610
 what i do then is the whole paris 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.860
 unpack and I'll pull another one 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.350
 sometime over when half long hair 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.330
 then this is enough but if you have 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.620
 have long hair like my sister 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.780
 then you can give it to him one more time 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:01.260
 pull it through so you hit another 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.300
 turn around and I'll show you here as you 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.070
 have many layers in your hair than she has 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.770
 some sprints you can extend it 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.490
 by attaching the hair spray 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.670
 spray 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.780
 but it can also give a nice effect 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.090
 once it 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.340
 nice and tucked away then grab something 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.680
 for example, beautiful pins or a pin 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.420
 clip as I use here 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.960
 and then you climb it firmly 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.550
 must be really good and firmly attached to 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.710
 covering the clip you can see the best 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.690
 decorate with fun toys 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:34.790
 or if you have a celebratory dinner to you 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.790
 you use a beautiful rhinestone hairpin 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:41.120
 result is a chic hairstyle with beautiful 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:44.320
 light on the side and nicely brightened up 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.320
 with a nice spell 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.150
 hairstyle is nice if you have curls 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:54.370
 or if you have style hair every now and then 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.620
 or curls in language 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.630
 we made some loose curls whatever you like 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.340
 further need is a hair band 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.840
 this is a very tough one with spikes 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.880
 you can of course take any hair band 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.590
 that you have 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:09.370
 I just attach it to the head just 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.960
 yes was pushing really like you 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.300
 see better 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.380
 and that I'm going to do is pick her 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.050
 to grab 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:20.490
 dragon a little bit around and that stop 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.490
 I then stuck under the headband 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.400
 it's supposed to be a bit 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.150
 a boho chic hairstyle is delicious 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.020
 casual 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:42.610
 so grab large slices and pick small ones 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:45.190
 twist a little and turn them 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:49.440
 nice and loose around the headband so that 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.440
 it looks a bit messy 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.810
 pull off some picking and wanting 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.610
 a bit with your fingers through her 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.300
 it is precisely the intention that it is tasty 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.300
 gets messy 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:11.860
 and this is the end result 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.610
 a very cool but above all very simple 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.160
 look 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:17.080
 bit half raised this dimension 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.360
 boho chic feeling 

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:22.709
 but also neat and dressed it 

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:22.709
 depends a bit on your hair band 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:37.310
 very sorry if there is for example 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.310
 a lot of fucking
