00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.450
 you know how to do it and I wanted to 

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:05.780
 share a reflection 

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:09.119
 all the animals of creation all 

00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:13.739
 star in one of those d movies that invade and terrorize the 

00:00:13.739 --> 00:00:18.029
 human wasps killer ants carnivorous giant squid that 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.600
 they drag the man to death gorillas who join skyscrapers miñocas that 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:23.529
 They bite the feet of the elderly 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:26.720
 even all the animals could star in one of those movies 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:27.939
 everyone 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:30.349
 e - 1 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:33.610
 the seahorses 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.430
 you imagine 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.120
 a seahorse 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.540
 ravaging cities 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.540
 destroying new york 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:44.630
 they govern us 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.230
 what does a seahorse do? 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.230
 with that mouth that has as a rule pomps that 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:53.900
 if animal is designed to bad idea 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.390
 I do not think God designed it 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.390
 it was designed is rather lladró 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.260
 kindly a kind god does not do that task a creature of hers 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:13.840
 google has put nothing or nothing 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.340
 2 nor legs that the poor little horse can not scratch 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.230
 love is swimming by madrid bassi 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.990
 it seems that he is saying he will keep cut 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.990
 marta etura 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.830
 beneo applying the body since I was born 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.700
 - women 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.840
 that is to say, for the horse, two elements flowed a piece of placton in the eye 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.870
 and you can not take it off 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.770
 that's how the poor go with those eyes that seem to be doing the route of the 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.770
 cod 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.360
 never the most disappointing of a seahorse 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.300
 is that it does not look like a horse 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.290
 belmar marched fish that do resemble things has not done the pp will puncture fish 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.700
 hammer saw fish roll carpentry the sea dominates 

00:02:11.649 --> 00:02:15.059
 but the seahorse not for god 

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:16.959
 according to how they put that name 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.150
 I already imagine the scientists because I have out is like an animal 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.609
 15 centimeters long with dosed carapace 

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:25.609
 It fits this popular couple lieutenant spining a limb 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:29.549
 a horse 

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:38.229
 that have their merit because like seahorses do to swim straight 

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:41.509
 veneer collected straightened that onassis 

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:44.759
 in fact the blues have to have the abdominals 

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:47.549
 efe harder than the bumper of a volvo because this is 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:49.919
 we all go and how I understand but here 

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:53.719
 in the stage of the tour you will see that I do not hurt but agile another cart as if not 

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:56.719
 I have work 

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:05.879
 are the best creatures of creation or at least the only ones that do not 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:08.459
 they could destroy the human race 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.919
 that's what the beings created by theater that never described us 

00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:12.569
 children 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:16.259
 Anyway, there are those who say that lladró is the antichrist 

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:20.779
 yes because the giant flies the carnivorous touches the tarantulas 

00:03:20.779 --> 00:03:25.169
 killers all of them could destroy the human race but they do not why 

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:27.289
 suspect and both but one day 

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:32.189
 all beings created by the theater will rise from the darkness 

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:35.109
 and some created by swaroski also got up 

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:40.599
 the sea horses the dancers surrounded by swans they the butterflies 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:42.879
 that pull florida floats 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:46.549
 the ladies who carry flags of more rank in 2000 and 2010 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:50.049
 all those creatures 

00:03:50.869 --> 00:03:52.079
 tan del averno 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:54.459
 to see us 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:57.739
 they will leave there and it will be the end of the world 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:03:59.449
 loose from the villa 

00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:02.959
 It makes you get along well with seahorses but when they destroy the race 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:04.159
 human are not going to have
