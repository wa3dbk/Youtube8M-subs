clearly<00:00:23.080> is<00:00:23.500> is<00:00:23.830> both<00:00:24.960> when<00:00:25.960> the<00:00:26.050> Bible<00:00:26.350> says

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:26.380 
clearly is is both when the Bible says

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.800 
clearly is is both when the Bible says
you<00:00:26.770> know<00:00:26.830> Pontius<00:00:27.340> Pilate<00:00:27.880> was<00:00:28.060> the<00:00:28.390> governor

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:28.810 
you know Pontius Pilate was the governor

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.439 
you know Pontius Pilate was the governor
and<00:00:29.080> tried<00:00:29.380> Jesus<00:00:29.860> that<00:00:30.310> that<00:00:30.520> sounds<00:00:31.210> like<00:00:31.420> a

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:31.449 
and tried Jesus that that sounds like a

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:33.959 
and tried Jesus that that sounds like a
fact<00:00:31.810> when<00:00:32.469> Jesus<00:00:32.860> says<00:00:33.070> I<00:00:33.100> am<00:00:33.430> the<00:00:33.460> bread<00:00:33.940> of

00:00:33.959 --> 00:00:33.969 
fact when Jesus says I am the bread of

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:37.139 
fact when Jesus says I am the bread of
life<00:00:34.149> I<00:00:34.809> am<00:00:34.960> the<00:00:35.260> living<00:00:35.710> water<00:00:36.010> he's<00:00:36.670> speaking

00:00:37.139 --> 00:00:37.149 
life I am the living water he's speaking

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:39.360

in<00:00:37.359> a<00:00:37.420> metaphor<00:00:37.870> it's<00:00:38.079> it's<00:00:38.319> a<00:00:38.469> symbol<00:00:38.829> clearly

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.370 
in a metaphor it's it's a symbol clearly

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.119 
in a metaphor it's it's a symbol clearly
i<00:00:40.269> think<00:00:40.870> if<00:00:40.929> we<00:00:40.960> read<00:00:41.230> the<00:00:41.319> Bible<00:00:41.649> we<00:00:41.710> can<00:00:41.859> tell

00:00:42.119 --> 00:00:42.129 
i think if we read the Bible we can tell

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:44.969 
i think if we read the Bible we can tell
the<00:00:42.309> difference<00:00:42.550> between<00:00:42.909> these<00:00:43.979> children
