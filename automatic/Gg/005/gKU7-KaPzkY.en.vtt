00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.160
 are you going today i will show you 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:09.150
 how you can make the tastiest of you 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:14.340
 you need mayonnaise sweet chili sauce 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:16.850
 honey fresh garlic pepper and salt 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:21.420
 and of course a bowl and a fork 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:23.250
 put it in for a small bowl 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.859
 we use take 2 cloves 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.900
 garlic that is enough 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:29.519
 we start with the mayonnaise the creator 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.859
 a few sharp ones 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.480
 about half in the crew bowl 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.480
 of the container is full of mayonnaise 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.480
 then we do the chili sauce and the 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.960
 chili sauce by about half the 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.960
 marinette 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.770
 well stir well and mix well 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.690
 then you can always see for yourself 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.520
 extra chili sauce or extra marinus 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.010
 there should do it just depends on 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.430
 whether you like spicy or something 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.430
 less spicy 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.870
 after hearing we do a little pepper and 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.409
 a little salt in it to put that oil on 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.409
 to taste 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.680
 and then of course stir well again 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.940
 then we put the garlic in it 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.940
 use a garlic press for this 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.600
 put the two cloves in there 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.440
 and then press true 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.720
 and then scrape off the garlic with one 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:52.180
 blade 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.180
 and then again stir very well 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.740
 after stirring it is time for the honey 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:12.270
 but need a little bit to 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.270
 to make it slightly sweeter 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.290
 then stir very well again 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:34.350
 and after stirring should be aioli approximately 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:35.850
 This color sometimes does not 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.250
 you of course a few days from 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.080
 before you start using it 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.280
 it is handy to be in a pot 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.650
 save it 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.620
 the just used my putting s i now 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:50.010
 washed and dried 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:52.170
 and here I am going to save the aioli 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.300
 you also have a coke bottle or one 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.610
 need another bottle that you cut the 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.660
 top of all and we use that as 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.430
 funnel 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:05.180
 if you of course yourself further from 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:05.180
 you can use it that way 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.630
 Also wash these well so that there 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:18.860
 no cola the remains go inside 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.860
 and of course also drying 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.959
 then we put it on the pot that we are going 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:28.920
 and we can use it to you 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:30.989
 d'r in sharp to this is handy because if 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.840
 you to you create it with spoon 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:34.680
 then the pot itself can still do a bit 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.830
 dirty plates 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:40.010
 so it just stays all neat and tidy 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:40.010
 clean 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.620
 and for the crea bea's among us it is 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.600
 of course very nice to have one too 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.190
 make your own label 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.870
 Aioli 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.830
 after an hour it will feast on me 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.830
 hope you enjoyed it
