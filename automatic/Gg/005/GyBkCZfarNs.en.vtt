00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.070
 the rapid are unbelievable principle in 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.540
 the game went, there were many 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.610
 especially on many yellow cards 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.710
 contentious scenes of the audience full 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.180
 of course, there was one 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:16.630
 Witch cauldron arises with the 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.430
 expected 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.110
 big praise at this point that the 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.310
 team stay relatively cool that it 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.710
 continue so we tried now too 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.880
 we actually have ten moods 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.770
 reinbringen and therefore must 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.020
 express great compliment 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.640
 free mark risks pants chooses now versa 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.010
 In the run-up that he actually everywhere 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.170
 Meet here last days has the 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.239
 230 omitted and has absolutely 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:40.239
 especially that's what it's about 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:41.260
 succeeded and it is as far as we want 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:45.250
 do not act arrogantly 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.239
 that's why you have to be very careful 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.100
 Happy that you won the game 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:49.359
 to have 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.550
 it was what you hoped and dreamed for 

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:53.699
 have that we play as magnet and 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:58.300
 we can present and so on 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:59.829
 but I am 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.239
 not quite satisfied so we have 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:05.920
 already played better we have 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:07.930
 situations in excess not so 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.980
 Really be aware of the rapid 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:13.950
 would have made a good match too 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:16.120
 That's why these were compelling opportunities 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.060
 not played out now but at 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.200
 flanks and over-free-kicks were 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.180
 she always dangerous and too 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.370
 It could also be a draw 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.210
 of course it was beautiful 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:30.190
 for us it was clear that there was to win 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.800
 a battle-oriented game with a lot 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.180
 emotions and we are of course before 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.090
 that we were a bit cool look 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.960
 on a goal and then earns big 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.190
 of course those have to blame 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.390
 space you really have to 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.190
 say that is klaus jehle 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.260
 but that's just how you look 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.100
 hard to do that you have to circulate soon 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.380
 that maybe the first one 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.730
 contact continue to play today at 23 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.960
 Contacts are needed at 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:50.530
 had control because they did not 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.200
 was hard 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.590
 but you also have to play such games now 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.300
 because really, although we were six minutes 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.040
 but luck was on ours 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.400
 page 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.650
 hello it is for me left defender 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:07.350
 but from that the problematic we 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.240
 the wm still have that the boys locks 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.970
 is not trained bodies whole week 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.920
 has become fourth in the training 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:18.120
 Parasite you do not want 2010 for 90 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:21.390
 has bought minutes she has the 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.640
 Variation offered today and childless 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:27.960
 was actually quite well done for 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:31.200
 this game and yes so it leads now 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.970
 be a variant and of formation with 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.560
 miserable the whole season we play just 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.560
 there has the human being spoken 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.880
 xhaka foul but we have under him he must 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:45.570
 Referee meetings and you have 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:47.700
 there and say that rulers sung the 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:50.700
 hands up there and then 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:54.739
 then attacked I believe that 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.739
 everyone in front of me there but confused 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:00.030
 accordingly excited because always 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:02.280
 but here you have something you have the 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.110
 he can clearly define the rules 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.150
 yellow case before made money with money 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.780
 do not need much unnecessary restlessness 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.690
 reinbringen 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:13.410
 every 15 56 green ones you walk 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.519
 to the controversial referee pure 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.799
 is only synonymous this is offset 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:18.420
 if ever every green player always 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:20.519
 tried double and triple lift 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.810
 Of course, the audience will take part 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:24.239
 and also does it among others 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.100
 free scene always at height 30 became 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:28.019
 hope to see us easily in the field now 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.000
 yes that always falls on it 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:31.290
 not be but know that and we are 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.670
 All stay calm and that's very 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.650
 positive to me 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.500
 small on the first case of boscoreale 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:40.290
 in the square so when I see that that 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:43.140
 to threaten these consequences and there 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.549
 that maybe a bit of a picture 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.519
 say let's drag because he 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:48.780
 are pretty sure are explained area 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:50.850
 but you fight for the last chance 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.769
 play masterpieces and they were 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.930
 of course very aggressive and then 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:56.280
 maybe yes then it was over 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.450
 aggressive that he put us in the cards 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.130
 played because we have our weapons 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.959
 actually had it under control we have 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.220
 course committed for wrong though 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:03.690
 Do not get involved in anything because that 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.850
 Of course, to provoke professionals is that 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.019
 clearly is done with me and yes so far 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.489
 You have to say we were just too 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:10.169
 clever we would not have the the 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:11.430
 rest in our game had the 

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:14.299
 callousness that one the 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:16.289
 the situations play so finished 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:17.579
 maybe once the staff today 

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:19.199
 his place comes to exploit her 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:22.889
 we could have been combative 

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:24.840
 on the other hand , how could you find it? 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:27.320
 this was easily appreciated 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.310
 a draw was possible 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.060
 and yes we have until the end 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.000
 shaken 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:36.120
 that is the truth you have many 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.770
 leave positive 2013 yes that's it 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.750
 only thing you did not have the game 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.820
 I was surprised that it was so surprising 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:44.430
 it will continue it will feel that 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:46.560
 they make so much more expensive but they would be 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.789
 certainly if you like my tv others 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.590
 make a goal 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:51.000
 The important thing is that you get the points 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.139
 drive in and probably next week 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.419
 against we will have there again 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:55.979
 go man before speculated it 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:56.970
 I always have to win 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:59.280
 lose in the summer crown 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:01.130
 The fact is that points 13 seeds front 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.360
 for rapid it's damn difficult it 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.560
 is pretty much no gun in the 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.360
 title race is we want to look 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.310
 we will want to do ours 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.620
 may make points next week probably 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:12.360
 Let's go ahead and be on 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.389
 new title race is actually completely 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.389
 no matter
