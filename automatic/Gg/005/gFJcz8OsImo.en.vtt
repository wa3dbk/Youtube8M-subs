00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:05.040
 hi guys my name is milena i am 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.980
 professional model and i'm here to 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:11.940
 help you understand everything about how to become 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:14.880
 supermodel so we start I prepared 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.990
 which 6 or 7 rules fell before 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.230
 become a supermodel 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.240
 so the first rule you need to sleep with 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.310
 all with a fee groups of stylists 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.289
 models make-up artists guitars 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.019
 rings directors until director 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.720
 to diversify companies with sellers 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.300
 philosopher no matter with whom you should sleep 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.520
 and the company because you know all the directors 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.440
 agencies they communicate very closely and 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.149
 better to have a lot of good communication 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.160
 because if you don't sleep with everyone 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.930
 I read success you will never 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.879
 they won't take you to any agency 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.039
 it will not do any work and all 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.579
 your dreams about a successful model 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.420
 career 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.850
 they will break in the kitchen about the second need 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.030
 always very cool to dress and if 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.859
 go myths about what Milan and Paris in 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.230
 New York dresses all very simple 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:04.110
 very much very subtle without 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.990
 some sail without fishing line without any 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.390
 spangle without rhinestones then it's all nonsense 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.430
 because the coolest models dress up 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.010
 very simple very cool and very 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.049
 effectively if you come as something not 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.390
 very nicely dressed that is some 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.100
 ordinary simple ones which they 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.960
 just so glitter than or is it 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.439
 packs it is natural that nobody has you 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.119
 will replace 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.009
 this will never get this job about 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.380
 which you dream but if you come 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.600
 super mega cool some latex 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.250
 cool suit with sparkles and which 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.880
 will cover the action latex suit 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.680
 and if you come just wildly wondrous 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.990
 a make-up slightly marvelous seri komi with 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.549
 decorations and than yes and I forgot 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.290
 show me faster nobody understands 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.540
 fashion they only pretend so there 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.400
 so that any bag on the market which will 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.420
 it is written that it is true to come so on 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.550
 penalty and they all will 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.590
 groan and gasp naturally take what 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:56.740
 remember you for this job 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:59.410
 the third rule everyone says that all 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:02.470
 models need inner peace but that's all 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:04.030
 nonsense because you know nobody needs 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.940
 my model nobody wants to talk 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:09.100
 with them on a variety of topics where are you from 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.860
 why did you come why are you working for 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:14.080
 everyone needs it stupid so everyone 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.640
 Did you come to the most important kasing 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.950
 what you need to do is just time 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.140
 cute giggle and and not smile and on 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:29.410
 every question when you will be very 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:31.810
 what should i do so quickly 4 all 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.630
 models they are wildly long and wildly steep 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.940
 so if you don't have millions of thousands 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.720
 dollars if your parents are petroleum 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.360
 moguls 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.130
 if you don’t go to maserati, it counts 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.940
 you have no opportunity to work 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.250
 your industry 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.770
 because there we only work daughters 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:50.440
 billionaire oil tycoons and 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:52.870
 diverse celebrity and stars therefore 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.670
 if you don’t have a bank in a bank 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:58.360
 about the amount 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:00.459
 20 hours with zeros you will not pass you not 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.290
 at least you never control you 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:04.180
 shoes for one job and nowhere 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.250
 will take in the agency because each 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:09.280
 girl model agency is daughter 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:12.130
 but some kind of magnate and pigs 5 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.850
 you need a lot of booze 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.950
 and have fun 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.019
 everyone loves cheerful girls so much 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.970
 if you demure if you love to read 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:22.420
 Now some virtual places like 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:24.580
 as a theater I don’t know ballets 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.940
 thinks that nobody will like you 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.620
 you must oblige 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.629
 a lot of booze a lot of sniff 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.379
 a lot of wells and put to sleep 

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:32.629
 with everyone 

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:34.370
 no matter the models are people who 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:36.170
 brushing your mood not when you are frequent 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.700
 just gotta sleep with everyone because 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.500
 this is the key to success 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.900
 all supermodels you can see 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.269
 on the cover of the magazine that you see by 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:47.660
 tv which are you on which are you 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:49.849
 crying you will see you exactly all of them 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:52.129
 a lot of booze and he smokes a lot and 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:53.030
 let them on TV have perfect skin 

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:56.629
 perfect bodies 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:58.370
 but all this is all about pro reached really 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:01.610
 In fact, they are terrible homeland 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:03.799
 the sixth in fact all the models 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:06.109
 they are incredible fat so you can 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:08.959
 eat as much as you can eat x 

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:09.560
 during the day at night you can climb 10 of 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:11.510
 60 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.910
 although no 50 very little you can write 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.709
 100 can you can see so much in 20 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.130
 you can be just wildly problematic 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:17.989
 leather 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.060
 your hair and could not have, he will 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:20.510
 its colors are so terrible but that is all 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.639
 spit 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:24.789
 because if you have charisma if 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:28.400
 you adore watering you grow 

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:31.160
 165 it doesn't matter, it's all decided by the fact that 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:34.039
 all covers all these seti programs 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:36.830
 show dior and chanel all this with photoshop 

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:38.750
 because these girls do not come they are not 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:41.690
 take them just photoshop in the style of missley 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:43.610
 it is clear therefore if you have millions 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:45.590
 thousand extra kilos don't worry 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:48.050
 ripped off you will be mega successful yeah 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:51.950
 cool i don't know what number this is 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:54.500
 account and flows so I wanted 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:56.900
 talk about what the next rule is 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:59.510
 which you need to become 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.849
 model of the fashion industry is that all 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:03.620
 adore some huge tunnel on 

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:04.520
 half of your ears that will be 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:08.150
 light you up 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:09.919
 little beard is very fashionable yet all adores 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.789
 all brother when your body is shinobi 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:12.889
 tattoos 

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:15.560
 when you have sleeves who's your back 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:16.460
 crammed up to you sex on your chest is all 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.500
 very fashionable 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:21.020
 if you cut your tongue or ride in 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:23.300
 heap pierced sock or pierced eyebrow 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.979

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:27.740
