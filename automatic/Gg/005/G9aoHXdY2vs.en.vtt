00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
was fine with me i told her since they

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.080 
was fine with me i told her since they
were<00:01:33.990> 20<00:01:34.439> inches<00:01:34.710> I<00:01:34.920> was<00:01:35.310> fine<00:01:35.520> with<00:01:35.549> going<00:01:35.850> up

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
were 20 inches I was fine with going up

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.859 
were 20 inches I was fine with going up
to<00:01:36.240> 16<00:01:36.720> inches<00:01:36.799> so<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:38.610> longest<00:01:39.180> layer<00:01:39.540> is

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
to 16 inches so the longest layer is

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.800 
to 16 inches so the longest layer is
probably<00:01:40.350> about<00:01:40.500> 16<00:01:41.220> to<00:01:41.250> 17<00:01:41.790> inches<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:42.659> then

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
probably about 16 to 17 inches and then

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.560 
probably about 16 to 17 inches and then
you<00:01:43.320> know<00:01:43.409> we've<00:01:43.560> got<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:44.430> shorter<00:01:44.820> my<00:01:45.000> layer

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570

blend<00:01:49.500> a<00:01:49.740> lot<00:01:49.979> better<00:01:50.280> this<00:01:50.549> way<00:01:50.820> they<00:01:51.060> look

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
blend a lot better this way they look

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.090 
blend a lot better this way they look
more<00:01:51.479> natural<00:01:51.540> they<00:01:52.200> give<00:01:52.380> me<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.649> volume

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
more natural they give me the volume
