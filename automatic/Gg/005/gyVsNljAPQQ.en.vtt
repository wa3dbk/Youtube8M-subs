00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 hello how were they located volcano 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.540
 naval time in which we can 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.150
 disguise any character and 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.590
 transform it into anything but in 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.750
 the music if we do not have an instrument 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.320
 we are missing something in this video I'm going to 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.320
 teach how to make a saucepan like this 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.320
 we started 

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:31.070
 or not 

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:32.720
 to make our carnival case 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.020
 we need the following materials 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:38.060
 roll paper cardboard gift 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:42.580
 It can be of paper or toilet paper 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:46.660
 kitchen scissors paper silk pencil 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:48.970
 adhesive tape and elastic band 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.960
 to start building our campus 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:54.010
 of carnival 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:56.650
 we have to wrap the cardboard with the 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:59.190
 gift paper previously taken from the 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:01.200
 measure and the only thing I have done has been 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.650
 roll it up 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:07.200
 to say to the edges there would be a 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:12.110
 thing like that now with the help of the tape 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.110
 adhesive we stick the union 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.740
 but this part yes 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:23.150
 with the leftover in both 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:26.060
 sites because I advise you to leave 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:28.340
 so that the cardboard is not left visible 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.740
 we can have two things well cut it out 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.040
 or as I'm doing it we can 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.650
 go putting 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.480
 in the cardboard shapes like in this 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.770
 extreme saw it with tissue paper not 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:43.310
 is going to see 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:45.740
 we have another roll of cardboard decorated 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.420
 the next step is to cut a 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:53.229
 square of tissue paper that is going to 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:53.229
 serve to cover one end of our 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:01.860
 when we have trimmed the square 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.159
 we put it on top of him 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.380
 reason and with the hand 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.179
 we close them down I go to 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.390
 use this rubber band that is 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.280
 small if you have at home the typical rubber 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.569
 elastic of the shoe box no 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.549
 it matters because the only thing we will have 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:20.239
 what to do is to turn around instead of a 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:20.239
 how am I going to do 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.690
 we have to make sure that the role of 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:33.810
 silk is well stretched will come out of this 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.489
 point we have the roll decorated the paper 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.340
 silk placed with the rubber doubt 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:42.209
 elastic the only thing that we would have would be 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:44.610
 make a small hole with the help of 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:48.150
 pencil the hole where you have to 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:51.900
 would do the same but I advise that what 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.940
 do a centimeter or so from where 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.530
 ends the tissue paper to make the 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:03:00.560
 hole we have to be careful because 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.560
 the cardboard is folded and we put the fingers 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.860
 to the woman 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:09.130
 and that's it 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.600
 it's fine our campus finished as 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.820
 I always say we can play with the 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.920
 Sizes with colors with the shape etc 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:17.560
 I have done this with the rolls of 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.690
 kitchen and this with the paper roll 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.120
 hygienic to touch them very easy just 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:25.770
 we have to put our mouths inside the 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.770
 tube and sing 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.730
