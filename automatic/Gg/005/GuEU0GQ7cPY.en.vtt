 How to Share this German Federal Bank 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.550
 Thank you very much 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:16.770
 Here you see the ingredients that is more 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:17.960
 sodium vanilla sugar milk sugar salt 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.939
 1 1 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:23.279
 mother then we have friendly 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.099
 chocolate white chocolate and 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.590
 bittersweet chocolate and that's enough for 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.240
 twelve muffins and best you have there 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.329
 a sheet that you either butter out 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.100
 or that you formally represents the time 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.210
 with chocolate that is 200 grams 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.680
 that will be melted 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.320
 You can also do that in the microwave 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.610
 do after you last time 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.410
 in fact the chocolate burned 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.020
 is i doing it again in the water bath it 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.789
 I'm sure the time is bitter 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.480
 melt the chocolate and the butter 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:53.190
 melt and then it continues immediately 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.440
 I have you the melap weighing ingredients 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:59.640
 linked below 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:00.030
 He gives mart to that and that's exactly 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.010
 looks 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:13.110
 a packet of a teaspoon so easy 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:18.590
 the salt goes and the whole will 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.590
 mixed set aside 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:32.729
 white and milk chocolate 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:34.530
 pressure is hacked and set aside 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.159
 put in this key is up 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:42.229
 now only the melted butter 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.229
 comes the melted butter chocolate 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:17.030
 and this is now creamy can 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.980
 now that comes to one 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.130
 lay 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:03.510
 that is very fluid and that is no more 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:07.489
 so it should still be warm 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.489
 would have to cool down now bitter 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.640
 My mix is ​​not anymore 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:22.440
 that's why i can use the flour directly 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:46.380
 add under stirring so now do 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:50.180
 you what chocolate into the 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.180
 and the oven 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.040
 that looks like it now i hope that 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:06.050
 are not accidentally got me now as 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.260
 I kept the recipe and I postpone it 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:11.420
 now for 18 minutes in the oven 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:15.280
 the 18 minutes are around it smells 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:18.340
 Fantastic even make a sample yes 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:22.490
 difficult so if you have this 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:24.830
 Carnelian chopsticks have it then 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:28.700
 they are not ready yet 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:31.700
 fresh chocolate in there is so 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:35.180
 fritter I think the finish 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:37.190
 and just got out so hanna 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.780
 which spurs the intro so much already 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:49.360
 has now tried our math 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:49.360
 German and not chocolate 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.220
 pay attention 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:04.500
 Have fun with it
