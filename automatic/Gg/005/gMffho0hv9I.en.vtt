00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
hard to read but after some effort I

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.770 
hard to read but after some effort I
found<00:01:11.370> out<00:01:11.550> that<00:01:11.820> a<00:01:11.880> lot<00:01:12.150> of<00:01:12.300> them<00:01:12.450> were<00:01:12.630> about

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
wondered if this place might give me

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.300 
wondered if this place might give me
some<00:01:16.979> clues<00:01:17.400> about<00:01:17.430> my<00:01:17.880> late<00:01:18.150> father<00:01:19.310> days

gathering in the sky it seemed like a
storm<00:01:46.140> was<00:01:46.410> on<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.680> way<00:01:47.840> despite<00:01:48.840> warnings

from<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.680> fishermen<00:01:50.250> I<00:01:50.399> started<00:01:50.790> walking

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
from the fishermen I started walking

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.840 
from the fishermen I started walking
toward<00:01:51.509> to<00:01:51.600> my<00:01:51.720> destination<00:01:52.370> now<00:01:53.370> that<00:01:53.610> I<00:01:53.700> was

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
toward to my destination now that I was

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.800 
toward to my destination now that I was
close<00:01:54.210> I<00:01:54.479> couldn't<00:01:54.810> just<00:01:54.990> stop<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:55.500> rest<00:01:56.630> as<00:01:57.630> I

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
close I couldn't just stop and rest as I

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.780 
close I couldn't just stop and rest as I
was<00:01:57.960> walking<00:01:58.170> a<00:01:58.440> strange<00:01:58.860> sensation<00:01:59.159> went

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
was walking a strange sensation went

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.300 
was walking a strange sensation went
through<00:01:59.970> my<00:02:00.090> body<00:02:00.330> I<00:02:01.070> wondered<00:02:02.070> what<00:02:02.280> was

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
through my body I wondered what was

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:08.210 
through my body I wondered what was
waiting<00:02:02.700> for<00:02:03.120> me<00:02:03.270> out<00:02:03.390> there<00:02:03.420> a<00:02:06.950> half<00:02:07.950> an<00:02:08.070> hour

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
waiting for me out there a half an hour

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.570 
waiting for me out there a half an hour
later<00:02:08.519> I<00:02:08.610> was<00:02:08.850> caught<00:02:09.119> in<00:02:09.149> a<00:02:09.450> fierce<00:02:09.750> storm

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
later I was caught in a fierce storm

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.920 
later I was caught in a fierce storm
perhaps<00:02:11.580> I<00:02:11.880> should<00:02:12.090> have<00:02:12.120> listened<00:02:12.600> to<00:02:12.810> the

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
perhaps I should have listened to the

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.330 
perhaps I should have listened to the
fisherman

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
fisherman

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.199 
fisherman
I<00:02:15.260> struggled<00:02:16.260> on<00:02:16.349> blindly<00:02:16.950> and<00:02:17.580> thought<00:02:17.910> I<00:02:17.940> was

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
I struggled on blindly and thought I was

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.540 
I struggled on blindly and thought I was
about<00:02:18.450> to<00:02:18.510> die<00:02:18.900> from<00:02:19.110> exposure<00:02:19.379> but<00:02:20.160> I<00:02:20.250> found

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
about to die from exposure but I found

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.309 
about to die from exposure but I found
some<00:02:20.879> sheltering<00:02:21.450> rocks

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
some sheltering rocks

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:25.349 
some sheltering rocks
