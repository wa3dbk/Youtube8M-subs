00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.500
 Girl, I'm a sexy guy. 

00:00:05.852 --> 00:00:07.500
 This makes me a good artist. 

00:00:08.747 --> 00:00:09.900
 This is my new song. 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.945
 Hope you like it 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.500
 A rich man hired me 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.000
 To sing this song he wrote to me 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.300
 They are investing in this "almost" video clip 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.400
 And they're paying to play on the radio. 

00:00:26.431 --> 00:00:27.800
 On the radio 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.900
 And they will sell 1 million 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:31.380
 1 million 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.700
 Yes it will turn platinum 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:41.000
 Because they will market this song to impressionable and insecure teenagers. 

00:00:41.502 --> 00:00:48.000
 Cause all you need to say is "Baby I love you" and "Girl I need you in my world" 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.750
 Because they will market this song to impressionable and insecure teenagers. 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:01.500
 Because all they need to do is find a sexy guy who can sing all the words 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.800
 And now it's the rap verse 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.440
 That makes no sense 

00:01:05.664 --> 00:01:09.200
 But that helps to achieve a percentage of urban style 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.800
 Hey baby baby, I can tell you're crazy, crazy. 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.400
 Shake that ass but my rhymes are getting weaker weak 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.950
 The things I'm talking about have nothing to do with baby music. 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.400
 But it does not matter, why do not you show me these baby panties 

00:01:23.435 --> 00:01:26.900
 This is how it works in the pop music industry. 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 2010 motherfucker that's how it works 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:36.000
 Because they will market this song to impressionable and insecure teenagers. 

00:01:36.059 --> 00:01:43.000
 Cause all you need to say is "Baby I love you" and "Girl I need you in my world" 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:50.000
 Because they will market this song to impressionable and insecure teenagers. 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:56.300
 Because all they need to do is find a sexy guy who can sing all the words 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.500
 Now I'm singing with my gay voice 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.550
 For you to know that I am sensitive 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.250
 Oh Yeah, I'm singing with my gay voice 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.800
 Teens love a sensitive little boy 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.000
 Sensitive boy 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.250
 And you know that I want to 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.000
 Make money, make money money 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.800
 Make money, make money money 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.050
 Riches making money from your investments 

00:02:22.533 --> 00:02:25.000
 Oh this is so sensual baby 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.900
 Girl, I love you so much. I wish we could stay together 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.600
 Unfortunately we can not because I'm rich and famous and you do not. 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.700
 But why are not you going to buy my CD? 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.900
 And also tell your friends, so they can buy the CD too. 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
