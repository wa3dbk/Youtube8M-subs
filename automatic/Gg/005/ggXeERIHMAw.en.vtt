00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 
this from right here at pegs right up

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.090

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
forward all the way up and then you can

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:02.500 
forward all the way up and then you can
rotate<00:01:56.240> this<00:01:56.420> around<00:01:59.470> that<00:02:01.060> and<00:02:02.060> close<00:02:02.330> the

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.510 
rotate this around that and close the

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.560 
rotate this around that and close the
door<00:02:02.540> he's<00:02:02.930> got<00:02:03.140> about<00:02:03.439> speakers<00:02:04.330> that<00:02:05.330> he<00:02:05.420> can

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
use to blast sound at the enemy I think

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.030 
use to blast sound at the enemy I think
he<00:02:09.349> used<00:02:09.560> it<00:02:09.679> a<00:02:09.739> few<00:02:09.769> times<00:02:09.950> in<00:02:10.399> the<00:02:12.040> cartoon

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
he used it a few times in the cartoon

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.949 
he used it a few times in the cartoon
flipping<00:02:13.610> speakers<00:02:14.060> out<00:02:14.239> you<00:02:14.450> can<00:02:14.599> do<00:02:14.720> on<00:02:14.840> both

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
flipping speakers out you can do on both

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.740 
flipping speakers out you can do on both
sides<00:02:15.260> I<00:02:16.239> mean<00:02:17.239> y'all<00:02:17.360> have<00:02:17.480> to<00:02:17.540> have<00:02:17.659> them

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
sides I mean y'all have to have them

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.750 
sides I mean y'all have to have them
facing<00:02:18.080> forward<00:02:18.379> you<00:02:18.470> can<00:02:18.560> you<00:02:18.950> know<00:02:19.040> there

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
facing forward you can you know there

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:20.679 
facing forward you can you know there
are<00:02:19.819> looks<00:02:20.090> like<00:02:20.150> they're<00:02:20.330> on<00:02:20.360> a<00:02:20.450> ball<00:02:20.659> joint

00:02:20.679 --> 00:02:20.689 
are looks like they're on a ball joint

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:23.170 
are looks like they're on a ball joint
in<00:02:21.049> the<00:02:21.080> hinge<00:02:21.319> so<00:02:21.500> you<00:02:21.590> can<00:02:21.709> have<00:02:21.890> them<00:02:22.180> pretty

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
in the hinge so you can have them pretty

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:24.250 
in the hinge so you can have them pretty
much<00:02:23.239> however<00:02:23.510> you<00:02:23.689> want<00:02:23.870> you<00:02:23.959> want<00:02:24.110> to<00:02:24.170> have

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
much however you want you want to have

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.530 
much however you want you want to have
them<00:02:24.379> up<00:02:24.470> higher<00:02:26.709> there<00:02:27.709> you<00:02:27.799> go<00:02:28.209> so<00:02:29.209> yeah<00:02:29.359> it's

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
them up higher there you go so yeah it's

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.740 
them up higher there you go so yeah it's
got<00:02:29.659> the<00:02:29.749> speakers<00:02:30.109> which<00:02:30.290> is<00:02:30.409> kind<00:02:30.590> of<00:02:30.620> cool

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.880 

and<00:02:34.750> then<00:02:34.870> once<00:02:34.990> you<00:02:35.080> got<00:02:35.200> the<00:02:35.290> doors<00:02:35.470> open

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
and then once you got the doors open

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.720 
and then once you got the doors open
thats<00:02:36.040> starts<00:02:36.670> transformation<00:02:38.520> the<00:02:39.520> doors

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
thats starts transformation the doors

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:40.980 
thats starts transformation the doors
will<00:02:39.880> go<00:02:40.000> ahead<00:02:40.060> and<00:02:40.270> fold<00:02:40.420> these<00:02:40.630> back<00:02:40.840> and

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:40.990 
will go ahead and fold these back and

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:42.330 
will go ahead and fold these back and
you<00:02:41.050> can<00:02:41.170> deploy<00:02:41.440> these<00:02:41.590> in<00:02:41.740> a<00:02:41.800> robot<00:02:42.040> mode<00:02:42.220> as

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
you can deploy these in a robot mode as

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.410 
you can deploy these in a robot mode as
well<00:02:42.370> they<00:02:42.640> just<00:02:42.670> flip<00:02:43.000> right<00:02:43.150> over<00:02:43.180> the

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
well they just flip right over the

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.600 
well they just flip right over the
shoulders<00:02:43.980> I'm<00:02:44.980> just<00:02:45.130> going<00:02:45.250> to<00:02:45.310> go<00:02:45.370> ahead<00:02:45.430> and

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
shoulders I'm just going to go ahead and

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:56.220 
shoulders I'm just going to go ahead and
fold<00:02:45.730> them<00:02:45.850> up<00:02:45.970> for<00:02:46.120> the<00:02:46.210> time<00:02:46.390> pain<00:02:53.940> and<00:02:55.230> we'll

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
fold them up for the time pain and we'll

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.880 
fold them up for the time pain and we'll
do<00:02:56.350> that<00:02:57.060> yeah<00:02:58.200> yeah<00:02:59.200> this<00:02:59.380> is<00:02:59.530> this<00:02:59.709> just

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
do that yeah yeah this is this just

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.890 
do that yeah yeah this is this just
clips<00:03:00.160> on<00:03:00.340> you<00:03:00.820> could<00:03:01.000> conceivably<00:03:01.420> take<00:03:01.750> this

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
clips on you could conceivably take this

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.420 
clips on you could conceivably take this
and<00:03:02.080> clip<00:03:02.230> this<00:03:02.350> on<00:03:02.560> to<00:03:02.590> a<00:03:03.330> regular<00:03:04.330> I<00:03:05.430> think

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
and clip this on to a regular I think

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:07.530 
and clip this on to a regular I think
that<00:03:06.520> would<00:03:06.640> clip<00:03:06.910> on<00:03:07.060> to<00:03:07.209> the<00:03:07.330> five

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
that would clip on to the five

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:08.940 
that would clip on to the five

and there this is his lower body and
what's<00:04:22.630> cool<00:04:22.900> is<00:04:23.200> you<00:04:23.650> want<00:04:23.800> to<00:04:23.860> flip<00:04:24.010> pull

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
what's cool is you want to flip pull

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.430 
what's cool is you want to flip pull
your<00:04:24.550> arms<00:04:24.730> down<00:04:24.940> and<00:04:25.240> then<00:04:25.990> you<00:04:26.050> flip<00:04:26.290> the

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
your arms down and then you flip the

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:31.379 
your arms down and then you flip the
wheels<00:04:26.680> out<00:04:28.470> like<00:04:29.470> this<00:04:30.060> but<00:04:31.060> that's<00:04:31.240> what's

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:31.389 
wheels out like this but that's what's

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:32.820 
wheels out like this but that's what's
neat<00:04:31.570> is<00:04:31.600> as<00:04:31.870> you<00:04:31.990> flip<00:04:32.169> the<00:04:32.290> wheels<00:04:32.470> out<00:04:32.650> that

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
neat is as you flip the wheels out that

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.230 
neat is as you flip the wheels out that
for<00:04:33.130> in<00:04:33.280> the<00:04:33.370> middle<00:04:33.550> of<00:04:33.610> the<00:04:33.669> winch<00:04:33.880> of<00:04:34.150> the

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
for in the middle of the winch of the

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:40.200 
for in the middle of the winch of the
hood<00:04:34.860> opens<00:04:35.860> up<00:04:37.110> like<00:04:38.110> that<00:04:38.500> and<00:04:39.030> then<00:04:40.030> when

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
hood opens up like that and then when

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:43.470 
hood opens up like that and then when
you<00:04:40.360> uh<00:04:40.389> flip<00:04:41.169> his<00:04:41.290> chest<00:04:42.040> down<00:04:42.280> his<00:04:42.940> head<00:04:43.210> as

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:43.480 
you uh flip his chest down his head as

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:47.520 
you uh flip his chest down his head as
you<00:04:43.570> can<00:04:43.690> see<00:04:44.010> automatically<00:04:45.010> rotates<00:04:45.430> up<00:04:46.530> and

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:47.530 
you can see automatically rotates up and

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:49.370 
you can see automatically rotates up and
you<00:04:47.620> get<00:04:47.770> this<00:04:48.000> out<00:04:49.000> of<00:04:49.030> the<00:04:49.150> way

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
you get this out of the way

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:54.710 
you get this out of the way
automatically<00:04:50.380> rotates<00:04:50.740> up<00:04:50.950> and<00:04:51.160> through<00:04:51.340> the

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.370 

up<00:04:55.720> and<00:04:55.870> through<00:04:55.990> the<00:04:56.080> hole<00:04:56.580> and<00:04:57.580> there<00:04:57.850> you<00:04:57.940> go

me show you the shader rotate again
since<00:05:10.419> it<00:05:10.570> was<00:05:10.810> kind<00:05:11.110> of<00:05:11.140> off-screen<00:05:11.560> you<00:05:12.220> just

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:12.340 
since it was kind of off-screen you just

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.870 
since it was kind of off-screen you just
flip<00:05:12.520> it<00:05:12.610> up<00:05:12.760> his<00:05:12.970> head<00:05:13.120> rotates<00:05:13.479> up<00:05:14.880> position

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:15.880 
flip it up his head rotates up position

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:16.980 
flip it up his head rotates up position
him<00:05:16.000> we<00:05:16.120> go<00:05:16.270> ahead<00:05:16.360> and<00:05:16.479> pull<00:05:16.690> this<00:05:16.780> up<00:05:16.930> a
