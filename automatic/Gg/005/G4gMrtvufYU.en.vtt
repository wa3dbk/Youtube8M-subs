00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
things and talking to people just

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.809 
things and talking to people just
completely<00:01:12.289> different<00:01:12.710> backgrounds<00:01:13.549> that

00:01:13.809 --> 00:01:13.819 
completely different backgrounds that

00:01:13.819 --> 00:01:15.999 
completely different backgrounds that
was<00:01:13.999> really<00:01:14.509> eye-opening<00:01:14.689> I<00:01:15.289> went<00:01:15.560> to<00:01:15.649> Buenos

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:16.009 
was really eye-opening I went to Buenos

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:18.340 
was really eye-opening I went to Buenos
Aires<00:01:16.219> Argentina<00:01:16.579> and<00:01:17.389> I<00:01:17.479> spent<00:01:17.840> a<00:01:18.020> full

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
Aires Argentina and I spent a full

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.249 
Aires Argentina and I spent a full
academic<00:01:18.770> year<00:01:19.159> there<00:01:19.579> and<00:01:19.850> Buenos<00:01:20.780> Aires<00:01:20.929> is

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
academic year there and Buenos Aires is

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:23.410 
academic year there and Buenos Aires is
a<00:01:21.289> homestay<00:01:21.889> program<00:01:21.920> and<00:01:22.670> so<00:01:22.909> I<00:01:22.939> think<00:01:23.090> that's

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
a homestay program and so I think that's

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.300 
a homestay program and so I think that's
unique<00:01:23.659> in<00:01:23.899> itself<00:01:24.259> because<00:01:24.649> you<00:01:24.799> really<00:01:25.100> get

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
unique in itself because you really get

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.550 
unique in itself because you really get
to<00:01:25.340> immerse<00:01:26.030> yourself<00:01:26.479> into<00:01:26.719> the<00:01:26.959> culture<00:01:27.109> and

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
to immerse yourself into the culture and

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.349 
to immerse yourself into the culture and
get<00:01:27.679> to<00:01:27.829> know<00:01:27.859> the<00:01:28.130> family<00:01:28.609> I<00:01:28.759> spent<00:01:29.240> the<00:01:29.329> year
