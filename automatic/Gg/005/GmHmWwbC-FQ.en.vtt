00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:07.130
 and it is our obligation for a car to live a hydrogen cell 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.919
 along with gasoline 

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:13.109
 the purpose here is not substitutable 

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:16.259
 I got a colony percentage 

00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:19.749
 with the generation of hydrogen from readers 

00:00:19.749 --> 00:00:22.899
 here we have a reservoir of crab by the actor eri pint 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.589
 an amount of alcohol with a small amount of salt 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.749
 enough to start the reaction 

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:32.140
 my fans 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.130
 from that jungle 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.400
 this cell reporting 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.400
 newcomer in field 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:41.770
 the plates are here 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.660
 desolated by a rubber that allows a certain amount of water 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.860
 inside her 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.200
 this amount of water 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.460
 in the middle of the plaque positive and negative next to voters 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.680
 and the generation of hydrogen 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.630
 I think we have 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:00.220
 curious to perceive 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.450
 some why we are changing your next album 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.400
 considered as a whole 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.630
 an environmental education pipeline 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.620
 Coming again 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.280
 in the book tube authors 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.610
 when you are a little from the reservoir 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.610
 the car by natural aspiration of the motorcycle road 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.890
 end up bringing august 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.810
 only the house tv this way the liquid 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.440
 is from bike given to the mix 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:31.880
 under renovation 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.350
 and help effect the system 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.510
 due to a small heating that may have 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.830
 especially if the mixture is suitable 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.430
 many salty sugar than this low component 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.860
 a current four or five authors 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.860
 majestic aware of the production of hydrogen 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.950
 the ideal would be to get there 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.400
 a slightly larger goal around 520 the strategic plan 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.470
 something more meaningful 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.470
 in the next 20 days I'll show you 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.410
 It's a circuit I did. 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.330
 which reduces the amount 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.849
 The team from Rio 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.259
 As I like it or not I have had more than brussels cell
