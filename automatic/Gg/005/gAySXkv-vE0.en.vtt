00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
at the way the hook is on that jig it's

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.979 
at the way the hook is on that jig it's
offset<00:04:10.160> about<00:04:10.400> ten<00:04:10.670> percent<00:04:10.880> and<00:04:11.780> what<00:04:11.959> that

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:11.989 
offset about ten percent and what that

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:14.920 
offset about ten percent and what that
does<00:04:12.350> is<00:04:12.410> it<00:04:12.560> makes<00:04:12.680> it<00:04:12.980> go<00:04:13.130> like<00:04:13.340> this<00:04:13.639> okay<00:04:14.510> so
