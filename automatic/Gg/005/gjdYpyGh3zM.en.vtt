hey how's it going today I'm going to
show<00:00:03.060> you<00:00:03.149> how<00:00:03.270> to<00:00:03.360> wrap<00:00:03.540> a<00:00:03.870> mic<00:00:04.230> cable<00:00:04.710> the

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
show you how to wrap a mic cable the

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.150 
show you how to wrap a mic cable the
proper<00:00:05.279> way<00:00:05.569> this<00:00:06.569> is<00:00:06.720> called<00:00:07.049> the<00:00:07.259> over-under

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
proper way this is called the over-under

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.520 
proper way this is called the over-under
method<00:00:08.580> and<00:00:08.790> it's<00:00:09.510> used<00:00:09.690> by<00:00:09.840> all<00:00:10.080> audio

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
method and it's used by all audio

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.940 
method and it's used by all audio
professionals<00:00:11.660> if<00:00:12.660> you<00:00:12.900> want<00:00:13.230> to<00:00:13.380> go<00:00:13.530> on<00:00:13.710> to<00:00:13.920> a

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
professionals if you want to go on to a

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.620 
professionals if you want to go on to a
stage<00:00:14.370> and<00:00:15.710> look<00:00:16.710> like<00:00:16.890> an<00:00:17.039> idiot<00:00:17.600> wrap<00:00:18.600> a

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
stage and look like an idiot wrap a

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.830 
stage and look like an idiot wrap a
cable<00:00:18.930> around<00:00:19.199> your<00:00:19.529> elbow<00:00:20.420> not<00:00:21.420> a<00:00:21.449> good<00:00:21.660> thing

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
cable around your elbow not a good thing

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.470 
cable around your elbow not a good thing
so<00:00:22.380> this<00:00:23.039> is<00:00:23.250> how<00:00:23.400> to<00:00:23.460> do<00:00:23.670> it<00:00:23.699> alright<00:00:24.150> for<00:00:24.300> this

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
so this is how to do it alright for this

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.330 
so this is how to do it alright for this
demonstration<00:00:25.019> I'm<00:00:25.410> going<00:00:25.439> to<00:00:25.800> use<00:00:26.310> a

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
demonstration I'm going to use a

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.960 
demonstration I'm going to use a
microphone<00:00:26.939> cable<00:00:28.130> it's<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.189> same<00:00:29.400> for<00:00:29.730> an

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
microphone cable it's the same for an

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.640 
microphone cable it's the same for an
instrument<00:00:30.390> cable<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.689> guitar<00:00:31.109> cable

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
instrument cable a guitar cable

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.160 
instrument cable a guitar cable
I<00:00:33.110> start<00:00:34.110> with<00:00:34.280> the<00:00:35.280> female<00:00:35.790> end<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:36.930> I'll

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
I start with the female end and I'll

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.530 
I start with the female end and I'll
tell<00:00:37.350> you<00:00:37.440> why<00:00:37.590> later<00:00:37.850> but<00:00:38.850> this<00:00:38.969> is<00:00:39.030> how<00:00:39.270> this

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
tell you why later but this is how this

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.780 
tell you why later but this is how this
is<00:00:39.600> how<00:00:39.750> it<00:00:39.840> goes<00:00:39.960> you<00:00:40.680> take<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.040> female<00:00:41.430> end

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
is how it goes you take the female end

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.750 
is how it goes you take the female end
be<00:00:41.940> in<00:00:42.030> your<00:00:42.149> left<00:00:42.329> hand<00:00:42.420> like<00:00:42.690> this<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.760> make

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
be in your left hand like this and make

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.369 
be in your left hand like this and make
a<00:00:44.789> loop<00:00:45.140> I'd<00:00:46.140> say<00:00:46.379> this<00:00:46.590> loop<00:00:46.829> is<00:00:47.070> about<00:00:47.340> ten

00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:48.379 
a loop I'd say this loop is about ten

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:51.229 
a loop I'd say this loop is about ten
ten<00:00:49.379> or<00:00:49.469> twelve<00:00:49.680> inches<00:00:49.950> in<00:00:50.070> diameter<00:00:50.250> is<00:00:50.640> sort

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
ten or twelve inches in diameter is sort

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.060 
ten or twelve inches in diameter is sort
of<00:00:51.270> what<00:00:51.420> you're<00:00:51.539> shooting<00:00:51.570> for<00:00:52.050> unless<00:00:52.920> it's

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
of what you're shooting for unless it's

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.189 
of what you're shooting for unless it's
a<00:00:53.160> really<00:00:53.430> long<00:00:53.699> cable<00:00:54.180> then<00:00:54.629> you<00:00:54.899> can<00:00:55.050> make

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
a really long cable then you can make

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.590 
a really long cable then you can make
bigger<00:00:55.739> loops<00:00:56.129> but<00:00:57.059> this<00:00:57.180> is<00:00:57.270> going<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.480> be<00:00:57.570> a

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
bigger loops but this is going to be a

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.180 
bigger loops but this is going to be a
fit<00:00:57.809> this<00:00:57.960> is<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.079> 50<00:00:58.379> foot<00:00:58.530> cable<00:00:58.770> that<00:00:59.070> were

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
fit this is a 50 foot cable that were

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.959 
fit this is a 50 foot cable that were
were<00:00:59.910> coiling<00:01:00.690> here<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:01.520> so<00:01:02.520> that<00:01:02.850> was<00:01:02.940> my

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
were coiling here and so that was my

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.960 
were coiling here and so that was my
first<00:01:03.270> coil<00:01:04.100> just<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.250> regular<00:01:05.610> coil

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
first coil just a regular coil

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.920 
first coil just a regular coil
now<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:06.900> next<00:01:07.229> coil<00:01:08.630> gets<00:01:09.630> twisted<00:01:10.850> like<00:01:11.850> that

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
now the next coil gets twisted like that

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.429 
now the next coil gets twisted like that
and<00:01:13.939> the<00:01:14.939> reason<00:01:15.210> for<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.420> twist<00:01:15.750> is<00:01:16.020> that

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
and the reason for the twist is that

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.780 
and the reason for the twist is that
every<00:01:17.040> alternating<00:01:17.640> coil<00:01:19.100> here's<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.369> normal

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
every alternating coil here's a normal

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.780 
every alternating coil here's a normal
loop<00:01:21.360> again<00:01:21.689> every<00:01:22.290> alternating<00:01:22.860> coil<00:01:23.100> gets

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
loop again every alternating coil gets

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.109 
loop again every alternating coil gets
that<00:01:24.060> twist<00:01:24.509> so<00:01:25.439> that<00:01:25.619> when<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.490> court<00:01:26.759> when

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
that twist so that when the court when

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.319 
that twist so that when the court when
the<00:01:27.270> entire<00:01:27.750> cable<00:01:28.320> pays<00:01:28.710> out<00:01:29.030> there<00:01:30.030> are<00:01:30.150> no

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
the entire cable pays out there are no

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.760 
the entire cable pays out there are no
tangles<00:01:30.600> so<00:01:32.240> let<00:01:33.240> me<00:01:33.299> show<00:01:33.450> you<00:01:33.479> that<00:01:33.600> again

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
tangles so let me show you that again

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.010 
tangles so let me show you that again
that<00:01:34.770> was<00:01:34.890> a<00:01:34.920> normal<00:01:35.280> coil<00:01:35.549> here's<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.720> twist

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
that was a normal coil here's the twist

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.850 
that was a normal coil here's the twist
on<00:01:37.579> the<00:01:38.579> back<00:01:38.759> of<00:01:38.970> mine<00:01:39.150> on<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:40.320> back<00:01:40.500> of<00:01:40.680> my

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
on the back of mine on the back of my

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.670 
on the back of mine on the back of my
wrist<00:01:41.400> there<00:01:41.729> see<00:01:42.720> that<00:01:42.899> here<00:01:43.290> it<00:01:43.350> is<00:01:43.439> again

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
wrist there see that here it is again

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.520 
wrist there see that here it is again
like<00:01:44.430> that<00:01:46.250> I've<00:01:47.250> been<00:01:47.399> doing<00:01:47.579> this<00:01:47.850> for

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
like that I've been doing this for

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:54.020 
like that I've been doing this for
thirty<00:01:49.530> years<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:51.079> it<00:01:52.079> may<00:01:52.380> feel<00:01:52.710> awkward<00:01:53.520> at

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
thirty years and it may feel awkward at

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.990 
thirty years and it may feel awkward at
first<00:01:54.060> but<00:01:56.360> you<00:01:57.360> quickly<00:01:57.600> get<00:01:57.840> into<00:01:58.399> into<00:01:59.399> the

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
first but you quickly get into into the

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.050 
first but you quickly get into into the
rhythm<00:02:00.149> of<00:02:00.390> it<00:02:03.710> sometimes<00:02:04.710> a<00:02:05.100> coil<00:02:05.430> might<00:02:05.640> want

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
rhythm of it sometimes a coil might want

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.760 
rhythm of it sometimes a coil might want
to<00:02:06.119> struggle<00:02:06.540> you<00:02:06.750> don't<00:02:07.229> want<00:02:07.409> to<00:02:07.500> go<00:02:07.619> the

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
to struggle you don't want to go the

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.490 
to struggle you don't want to go the
other<00:02:07.890> way<00:02:08.009> like<00:02:08.129> that<00:02:08.520> last<00:02:08.789> one<00:02:09.170> and<00:02:10.170> you

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
other way like that last one and you

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.030 
other way like that last one and you
just<00:02:10.530> have<00:02:10.860> to<00:02:10.890> coax<00:02:11.310> it<00:02:11.520> along<00:02:12.650> and<00:02:13.650> there<00:02:13.860> we

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
just have to coax it along and there we

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.180 
just have to coax it along and there we
are

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
are

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.960 
are
and<00:02:14.400> at<00:02:15.060> the<00:02:15.180> end<00:02:16.099> this<00:02:17.099> is<00:02:17.280> why<00:02:17.400> I<00:02:17.430> start<00:02:17.819> with

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
and at the end this is why I start with

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.410 
and at the end this is why I start with
the<00:02:18.180> female<00:02:18.780> end<00:02:19.080> because<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.489> male<00:02:20.790> end<00:02:21.180> is

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
the female end because the male end is

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.949 
the female end because the male end is
where<00:02:22.349> I<00:02:22.379> have<00:02:22.860> my<00:02:22.890> cable<00:02:23.819> type<00:02:24.120> velcro<00:02:24.599> cable

where I have my cable type velcro cable
time<00:02:25.140> and<00:02:26.209> so<00:02:29.030> there<00:02:30.030> we<00:02:30.150> are

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
time and so there we are

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.479 
time and so there we are
the<00:02:31.170> reason<00:02:31.410> the<00:02:31.470> cable<00:02:31.769> tie<00:02:31.860> is<00:02:31.920> on<00:02:32.190> the<00:02:32.280> male

the reason the cable tie is on the male
end<00:02:32.790> is<00:02:32.970> because<00:02:33.629> you<00:02:33.750> don't<00:02:33.900> want<00:02:34.050> the<00:02:34.140> cable

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
end is because you don't want the cable

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.820 
end is because you don't want the cable
tie<00:02:34.680> hanging<00:02:35.280> from<00:02:35.580> where<00:02:36.480> the<00:02:37.110> female<00:02:37.650> end

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
where it plugs into the microphone looks

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:43.250
