00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
tough is it to you know just kind of get

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.200 
tough is it to you know just kind of get
everybody<00:02:18.170> on<00:02:18.230> the<00:02:18.260> same<00:02:18.350> page<00:02:18.470> uh<00:02:19.030> I<00:02:20.030> think

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:20.210 
everybody on the same page uh I think

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:22.150 
everybody on the same page uh I think
it's<00:02:20.450> it's<00:02:20.660> it's<00:02:21.050> gonna<00:02:21.380> be<00:02:21.590> difficult<00:02:21.770> but

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
it's it's it's gonna be difficult but

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.590 
it's it's it's gonna be difficult but
then<00:02:22.340> again<00:02:22.460> I<00:02:22.910> mean<00:02:23.060> you<00:02:23.180> don't<00:02:23.360> even<00:02:23.450> have

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
then again I mean you don't even have

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.420 
then again I mean you don't even have
enough<00:02:23.660> time<00:02:23.960> related<00:02:24.380> to<00:02:24.590> get<00:02:24.800> to<00:02:25.010> organized

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
enough time related to get to organized

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.070 
enough time related to get to organized
so<00:02:25.670> in<00:02:25.850> some<00:02:26.180> senses<00:02:26.510> that's<00:02:26.690> a<00:02:26.780> benefit

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
so in some senses that's a benefit

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.560 
so in some senses that's a benefit
because<00:02:27.460> players<00:02:28.460> will<00:02:28.730> will<00:02:29.000> sit<00:02:29.240> back<00:02:29.420> on

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
because players will will sit back on

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.600 
because players will will sit back on
what<00:02:29.750> they<00:02:29.870> what<00:02:30.110> they<00:02:30.140> understand<00:02:30.680> and<00:02:30.860> it's

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
what they what they understand and it's

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.330 
what they what they understand and it's
