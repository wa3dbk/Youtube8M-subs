00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
 hello to all today we tell you 

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:04.859
 all about the fifth generation of opel 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.680
 astra also discover a first video 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.929
 concept bmw 3 liters csl tribute 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:18.420
 before that the return of the pellet 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:19.949
 green to end the traffic 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.779
 alternate that she deems unfair the 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.000
 minister of ecology ségolène royal has 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.039
 presented a new anti 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.689
 pollution it's about this pellet of 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.519
 color to help evaluate in one 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.570
 look at the vehicles according to 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.309
 their polluting emissions 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.440
 details on this new measure 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.360
 with pascal pennec editor-in-chief 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.670
 assistant in auto writing plus la 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.870
 lidc depending on the levels of 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.610
 pollution to gradually ban 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.649
 the vehicles according to their rejection 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.020
 little far she will distribute for free 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.050
 to people who will request it in 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.090
 a first time after when we look 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.010
 in detail that could roll in 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.559
 color function when we see that 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.020
 the number one category that is the most 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.800
 clean apart from electric vehicles 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:05.240
 wac and no diesel 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:09.479
 so that's still a nonsense 

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:11.880
 since the last diesel are 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.700
 really that he really finds them 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.130
 particles so here if this measurement such 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.360
 that she was caught that would be really 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.700
 unfair to the owners of a 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.400
 Recent diesel or at least from 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.840
 category 2 we have a kind of 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.570
 of balanced that is more or less 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.400
 coherent but in any case it gives the 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.990
 possibility for mayors to adapt 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.060
 if, for example, it is pollution 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.659
 particles to effectively ban the 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.880
 old diesels it is a system that is 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.079
 wants practice now you have to have 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.380
 the political courage to put it in 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.060
 road 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.439
 according to our fellow Parisians the 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.810
 device should be operational 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.939
 before 1 September but the implementation 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.790
 official place is only planned for the 1st 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.619
 January 2016 end of the suspense around 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.210
 the opel star was forced to 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.979
 reveal all of the information on 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.930
 its compact a few days before the date 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.070
 official and photos had indeed 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.320
 been published on the web 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.630
 farewell the blistered lines the 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.790
 sedan bets on a more aggressive design 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.290
 a regret maybe the stern a little bit too much 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.959
 modeled on that of the Giulietta 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.690
 compared to his eldest the new astra and 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.710
 5 cm shorter 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.180
 she claims yet is not it 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:16.040
 know more consistent thanks to 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.780
 less bulky seats to check on 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.310
 room in the month of September during his 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.050
 presentation at the Frankfurt show 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.670
 we will also take the opportunity to discover the 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.830
 dashboard and its big screen 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.600
 touch or test the system of 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.550
 onstar connected services that appears 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.290
 for the first time ever in europe 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.120
 on an opel in his transformation 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.700
 the astra based on a brand new chassis 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.260
 also lost weight up to 200 kg 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.640
 she also receives new 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.040
 engines including a three-cylinder 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.870
 Ali turbo petrol of 105 horses are 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.910
 arrived in France is planned at the end of 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.960
 the year 2015 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.970
 let's finish with a fresh video 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.100
 she stages the tribute concept to 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.810
 the 3 liters is the one that bmw has 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.180
 presented on May 23 at the 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.990
 elegance contest of the villa d'este 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.670
 the opportunity to listen for the whole 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:58.460
 first time in a very environment 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:01.240
 quiet the sound of the 6-cylinder block 3 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:01.240
 hybrid liters 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.730
 this reinterpretation of the famous coupé 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.129
 will the 70s see the light of day 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.870
 it's unlikely but bmw are in all 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:14.659
 determined case to propose in the future a 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:18.790
 sporty model with retro accents 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:18.790
 in the meantime, we'll have a look at tomorrow 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.940
 Yes
