performers<00:03:01.510> I<00:03:01.690> think<00:03:01.930> for<00:03:02.140> me<00:03:02.260> I<00:03:02.290> just<00:03:02.410> have

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:02.710 
performers I think for me I just have

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.060 
performers I think for me I just have
nothing<00:03:03.190> but<00:03:03.400> confidence<00:03:04.060> in<00:03:04.600> them<00:03:04.810> and<00:03:05.080> just

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
nothing but confidence in them and just

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.100 
nothing but confidence in them and just
so<00:03:06.820> I'm<00:03:06.970> probably<00:03:07.360> their<00:03:07.840> biggest

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110
