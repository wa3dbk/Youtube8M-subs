00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.210 

and<00:02:50.240> I<00:02:50.540> usually<00:02:50.720> just<00:02:51.020> end<00:02:51.140> the<00:02:51.440> G<00:02:51.740> chord<00:02:51.950> there

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
and I usually just end the G chord there

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.090 
and I usually just end the G chord there
and<00:02:52.490> D<00:02:53.050> becomes<00:02:54.050> in<00:02:54.290> G<00:02:54.440> major<00:02:54.590> it<00:02:54.860> sounds

and D becomes in G major it sounds

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.610 
and D becomes in G major it sounds
really<00:02:55.220> good<00:02:55.400> when<00:02:55.580> the<00:02:55.670> end<00:02:55.820> of<00:02:55.940> the<00:02:56.090> G<00:02:56.420> chord

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
really good when the end of the G chord

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.790 
really good when the end of the G chord
to<00:02:57.620> make<00:02:57.800> sure<00:02:57.980> it's<00:02:58.130> D<00:02:58.340> major<00:02:58.490> and<00:02:59.620> now<00:03:00.620> I'm

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 
to make sure it's D major and now I'm

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:01.960

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
not by the whole phone for you

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:07.690 
not by the whole phone for you
altogether<00:03:05.890> this<00:03:06.890> part<00:03:07.160> here<00:03:07.310> which<00:03:07.430> is<00:03:07.520> my

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
altogether this part here which is my

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.540 
altogether this part here which is my
adoption<00:03:08.090> um<00:03:08.500> instead<00:03:09.500> of<00:03:10.040> just<00:03:10.220> find<00:03:10.460> a

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
adoption um instead of just find a

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.460 
adoption um instead of just find a
single<00:03:10.820> note<00:03:10.970> I<00:03:11.120> can<00:03:11.330> also<00:03:11.510> play<00:03:11.840> a<00:03:12.140> broken

single note I can also play a broken
chord<00:03:12.710> I<00:03:12.890> think<00:03:13.070> it<00:03:13.160> sounds<00:03:13.400> really<00:03:13.430> good<00:03:13.730> that

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880
