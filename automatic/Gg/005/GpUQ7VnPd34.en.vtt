00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:05.229
 very pleasant I am as a tourist and he gave you 

00:00:03.549 --> 00:00:07.029
 welcome to the temple of time 

00:00:05.229 --> 00:00:09.580
 you knew that in the windmill of 

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:12.490
 kaka rich in ocarina of time creates a 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.720
 temporary paradox today accompanies me to eric 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.850
 and legends and videogames 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:17.619
 the weekly show that usually presents the 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:19.689
 same but as osde is my channel what 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:21.990
 I present this will not stay like this and 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:24.339
 Rowdy really is as purist 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.960
 hitchhiker as well you said before 

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:27.609
 a temporary paradox is created when visiting 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.259
 the guru guru the weird uncle of the mill 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:30.579
 obsessed with the things that spin us 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:32.800
 teaches the song of the storms 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:34.780
 when we go as an adult link but before 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.730
 to do so is not explained he learned 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.699
 of a boy dressed in green seven years ago 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.769
 years and that child is no other than link and 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:44.530
 that once the song has been learned, 

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:46.840
 go back to the past to show it to 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.929
 new and thus drain the water from the mill 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.039
 but how is this explained? 

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:53.170
 unfortunately he does not have a 

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:54.399
 clear explanation although we have seen 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.260
 temporal paradoxes in others 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:57.820
 video games like final fantasy or series 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.499
 of television as 'doctor who' the 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.030
 temporary paradoxes are an indicator me 

00:00:59.499 --> 00:01:02.750
 that trips back in time do not 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.500
 they are possible 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:08.250
 wait 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.870
 forgiveness not dear no matter never 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.910
 I will be able to meet my heroes 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:15.700
 while my communist partner as 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:17.770
 purist that recovers I'll show you a 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.390
 example of imagined temporal paradox 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.980
 that I activate a temporary portal five 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.350
 minutes in time and from my position 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.970
 shot my self from the past preventing from 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.890
 activate said portal in this case it 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.570
 created the temporary paradox although not 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.040
 there are absolute solutions there are many 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.810
 hypotheses that could solve this 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.910
 problem the solution of the recoil 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.500
 quantum spectral contemplation and 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.990
 others with even more complicated names 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.240
 but the one that would fit the most in history 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.820
 of a cell would be the theory of the present 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.400
 multiple this theory says mainly 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.680
 that altering reality does not affect the 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.560
 temporary line but it creates a line 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.120
 completely new temporary everything fits 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.610
 if we take a look at the chronology 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:57.700
 official of the saga after ocarina of 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.890
 time three time lines coexist 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.950
 different depending on the result of 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:05.200
 the final battle against ganondorf 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:08.110
 ceiling mf two temporary days are created 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.179
 one as a child and another as an adult and also 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.280
 creates a third time line in case 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.660
 that the player loses the link 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.760
 die 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.450
 and then according to this hypothesis the 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:24.010
 trips in time are possible good 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:25.959
 more or less we go there I go dinosaurs 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.400
 that has been all for today daley if it has 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.019
 liked the video and subscribe to the temple 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.519
 of time if you're passionate about cell you'll be 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:31.750
 up to date on the news and news of the 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:34.090
 saga and discover the curiosities 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.400
 gameplays etcetera you can also 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.200
 subscribe to legends and video games in 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.069
 the weekly show that I presented at all 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:44.409
 the chapters low game set and match 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:46.780
 there are legends and video games against 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:49.000
 curiosities theories stories and others 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.400
 many interesting things about the world 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.930
 of videogames that has been all for 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.640
 today we see you in the next video here 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.689
 in the time temple of the trifuerza 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.689
 I accompanied you
