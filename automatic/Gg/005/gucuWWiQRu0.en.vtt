 the flowers are really stinging 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:45.740
 in the ain in the braid that makes a 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:49.580
 support strong enough so the same 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:51.590
 just relax a little bit the braid on 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:55.010
 brings out the game of 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.930
 hair colors to give a side 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:01.100
 quite subtle and delicate 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:03.710

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.590
 snow pins small model this is 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:12.140
 enough the base of the fignon is enough 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:13.760
 close similar on the side why not 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.530
 to make her bite a little bit on 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:20.030
 the ear for a side a little bit 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:23.840
 romantic retro and then we will come 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:27.170
 integrate the fresh flowers to 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:30.140
 remember the bouquet so it can be 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:34.130
 do for the civil ceremony 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.900
 which is appropriate to integrate the 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.570
 small fresh flowers at the base of the 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.390
 chinon I come up so with a 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:44.150
 flower a little with a little tone 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:49.519
 supported for one side a little bit more 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:53.780

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:06.080
 the art of the flower like those at the same 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:09.739
 time at the base of the bun to have a 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:14.620
 good keeping people but well two or 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:14.620
 three for maximum security 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:21.220
 and then it gives a lively side to 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:26.150

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:28.220

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:40.610
