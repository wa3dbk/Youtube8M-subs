00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
cutscenes are all about it and it's a

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.830 
cutscenes are all about it and it's a
nice<00:00:41.010> little<00:00:41.040> twist<00:00:41.640> when<00:00:41.879> I<00:00:41.910> first<00:00:42.210> seen<00:00:42.510> it<00:00:42.540> I

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
nice little twist when I first seen it I

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.990 
nice little twist when I first seen it I
was<00:00:43.020> like<00:00:43.200> kind<00:00:43.500> of<00:00:43.590> blown<00:00:43.829> away<00:00:43.860> by<00:00:44.309> that<00:00:44.340> so<00:00:44.969> I

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
was like kind of blown away by that so I

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.720 
was like kind of blown away by that so I
don't<00:00:45.270> want<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.570> room<00:00:45.750> that<00:00:45.989> it<00:00:46.410> is<00:00:46.950> a<00:00:46.980> very

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
don't want to room that it is a very

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.490 
don't want to room that it is a very
hard<00:00:48.030> mission<00:00:48.420> at<00:00:48.510> least<00:00:48.660> I<00:00:48.780> found<00:00:49.020> it<00:00:49.200> to<00:00:49.320> be

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
hard mission at least I found it to be

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.770 
hard mission at least I found it to be
really<00:00:50.160> tricky<00:00:50.340> there's<00:00:50.910> one<00:00:51.210> objective

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
really tricky there's one objective

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.450 
really tricky there's one objective
where<00:00:52.559> it's<00:00:52.860> called<00:00:53.160> no<00:00:54.120> survivors<00:00:54.949> that<00:00:55.949> is

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
where it's called no survivors that is

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.700 
where it's called no survivors that is
really<00:00:57.300> truly<00:00:57.600> because<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.050> mission<00:00:58.379> itself

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
really truly because the mission itself

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.099 
really truly because the mission itself
is<00:00:58.949> kind<00:00:59.219> of<00:00:59.370> long<00:00:59.579> and<00:00:59.879> if<00:01:00.480> you<00:01:00.510> mess<00:01:00.840> that<00:01:01.050> up

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
is kind of long and if you mess that up

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.039 
is kind of long and if you mess that up
it<00:01:01.800> will<00:01:02.039> piss<00:01:02.309> you<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.670> fuck<00:01:02.940> off<00:01:03.180> everything

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
it will piss you the fuck off everything

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.410 
it will piss you the fuck off everything
else<00:01:04.350> is<00:01:04.559> pretty<00:01:05.189> easy<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.760> be<00:01:05.909> honest<00:01:06.299> but

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
else is pretty easy to be honest but

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.170 
else is pretty easy to be honest but
that<00:01:06.630> one<00:01:06.990> objective<00:01:07.590> it's<00:01:08.159> complicated<00:01:09.000> and

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
that one objective it's complicated and

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.660 
that one objective it's complicated and
it<00:01:10.140> sucks<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.710> only<00:01:10.920> thing<00:01:11.130> I<00:01:11.250> can<00:01:11.400> tell<00:01:11.520> you

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670

and you don't know what to do try a

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.880 
and you don't know what to do try a
sniper<00:01:15.450> rifle<00:01:15.689> that's<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.500> only<00:01:16.680> thing<00:01:16.830> I

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
sniper rifle that's the only thing I

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.609 
sniper rifle that's the only thing I
could<00:01:16.950> say<00:01:17.250> but<00:01:17.850> anyway<00:01:18.240> let<00:01:19.200> me<00:01:19.290> get<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.500> this

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
could say but anyway let me get to this

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.270 
could say but anyway let me get to this
mission<00:01:19.890> now<00:01:20.310> what<00:01:21.180> I<00:01:21.210> would<00:01:21.420> recommend<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.930> do

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
mission now what I would recommend to do

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.380 
mission now what I would recommend to do
definitely<00:01:23.280> play<00:01:23.580> this<00:01:23.759> mission<00:01:23.970> for<00:01:24.330> the

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
definitely play this mission for the

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.850 
definitely play this mission for the
first<00:01:24.600> time<00:01:24.869> because<00:01:25.140> once<00:01:25.380> you<00:01:25.500> played<00:01:25.710> the

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
first time because once you played the

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.130 
first time because once you played the
mission<00:01:26.250> you<00:01:26.880> will<00:01:27.060> get<00:01:27.240> a<00:01:27.270> grenade<00:01:27.450> launcher

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
mission you will get a grenade launcher

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.010 
mission you will get a grenade launcher
and<00:01:28.350> then<00:01:29.070> if<00:01:29.310> you<00:01:29.430> replay<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.850> mission<00:01:30.360> you

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
and then if you replay the mission you

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.600 
and then if you replay the mission you
can<00:01:31.200> use<00:01:31.380> your<00:01:31.590> grenade<00:01:31.710> launcher<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.490> of

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
can use your grenade launcher and of

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.370

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.859 
course you can always buy more grenades
for<00:01:34.740> your<00:01:34.890> launcher<00:01:35.400> that<00:01:36.299> kind<00:01:36.570> of<00:01:36.630> stuff

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
for your launcher that kind of stuff

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.840 
for your launcher that kind of stuff
because<00:01:37.470> one<00:01:37.920> of<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.130> objectives<00:01:38.729> for

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
because one of the objectives for

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.690

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
vehicles it's actually really easy if

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.889

launchers<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.600> blow<00:01:55.409> them<00:01:55.619> up<00:01:55.770> now<00:01:56.610> I<00:01:56.909> think

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
launchers and blow them up now I think

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.959 
launchers and blow them up now I think
you<00:01:58.020> also<00:01:58.350> have<00:01:58.619> to<00:01:58.950> beat<00:01:59.159> this<00:01:59.369> mission<00:01:59.820> in

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
you also have to beat this mission in

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.999 
you also have to beat this mission in
four<00:02:00.240> minutes<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:00.780> thirty<00:02:01.170> seconds<00:02:01.649> so<00:02:01.740> it's

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
four minutes and thirty seconds so it's

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.219 
four minutes and thirty seconds so it's
a<00:02:02.100> very<00:02:02.460> short<00:02:02.820> mission<00:02:03.210> and<00:02:03.450> it<00:02:03.719> is<00:02:03.840> pretty

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
a very short mission and it is pretty

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.709 
a very short mission and it is pretty
easy<00:02:04.500> in<00:02:04.680> general<00:02:05.130> there<00:02:05.430> is<00:02:05.610> one<00:02:06.149> objective

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
easy in general there is one objective

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.469 
easy in general there is one objective
it<00:02:06.930> took<00:02:07.140> me<00:02:07.290> like<00:02:07.439> three<00:02:07.920> attempts<00:02:08.849> or<00:02:09.000> four

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
it took me like three attempts or four

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.059 
it took me like three attempts or four
attempts<00:02:09.899> to<00:02:10.050> actually<00:02:10.500> get<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:10.800> gold<00:02:11.009> medal

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
attempts to actually get the gold medal

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.250 
attempts to actually get the gold medal
on<00:02:11.520> this<00:02:11.970> mission

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
on this mission

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.410 
on this mission
because<00:02:13.500> of<00:02:13.650> this<00:02:13.830> final<00:02:14.129> objective<00:02:14.849> you<00:02:15.390> have

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
because of this final objective you have

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.449 
because of this final objective you have
to<00:02:15.870> kill<00:02:16.140> at<00:02:16.920> least<00:02:17.159> 32<00:02:17.849> people<00:02:19.129> so<00:02:20.129> now<00:02:20.400> that
