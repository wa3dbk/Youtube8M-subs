00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 hello people i really wanted you 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.819
 for today a great new series 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.450
 Prepare these over three four weeks 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.189
 goes long 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.719
 but when we go to facebook and at 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.219
 twitter following has already mitgekriegt 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.910
 my camera is broken on monday 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.280
 went 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.410
 it really was really just the battery 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.670
 Luckily I would not really have 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.789
 I knew what to do 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.949
 but it was just the battery and he came too 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.539
 on thursday there are also 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.460
 actually a new video today 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.810
 I'm really happy about that, too 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.760
 Unfortunately I did not manage this 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.349
 series manufactures i hope 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.090
 I hope that next week too 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.860
 because I would of course like that 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.469
 a few days off for extra 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.030
 and of course that's how it was in time 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.739
 planned that just as in the days too 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.290
 and of course that's exactly what happens 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.940
 Camera broken you can not do anything 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.520
 For that I have video today in the set 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.010
 for you I would have to almonds is 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.420
 Make yourself and that was yes 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.739
 also asked by you if you can 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.750
 can do it myself or if I already 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.579
 I would not have tried 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.500
 but I have done and done for you now 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.420
 I can tell you it is totally in the 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.579
 pants would not be mine 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.559
 absolute youtube last week if that 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.960
 would have worked 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:08.520
 but see for yourself go for and 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.010
 finished a recipe picked out by 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.659
 chefkoch.de needs 250 g 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.430
 peeled shortages 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.380
 I took it unpeeled and 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.720
 now wants to own the same because that is 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.610
 then again a number cheaper so 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.799
 unpeeled lack the cost as the 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.420
 half of what peeled cost 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.570
 and then you still need some oil 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.290
 that was not going to take recipe 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.509
 specified but I then 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.340
 just once taken a nut oil 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.970
 peanut oil because I did not have it right now 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.290
 other stars olive oil and yes that fits 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.049
 they do not feel so good to me somehow 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.000
 that's why i took the oil and 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.040
 First we catch the almonds 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.930
 to peel and for that you have to 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.250
 Blanch the shelled and mandl 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.560
 from the trade but me too easy 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.979
 that is, the replaced pot is blocked 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.659
 with water on and let that cook and 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.189
 As soon as the cook gives the almonds for it 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.920
 a few seconds in and scooped 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:01.649
 so that as a foam trowel off and give 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.960
 the immediately an iced water and 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.280
 from the water the ice is cooled 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.560
 understands them then again immediately 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.039
 out and thereby the shell is then 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.620
 solved and 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.909
 then only like one 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.859
 Dried plums looks different 

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:15.790
 or how such a balloon somehow and 

00:02:14.859 --> 00:02:16.659
 then you can really easy 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.129
 make off 

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:20.680
 I'm doing this here at the beginning 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:22.060
 individually but then have once the camera 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.159
 selection found out that that much 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.810
 it's easier between two 

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:26.590
 hands to rub back and forth 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.180
 together 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.340
 So if you have such a whole 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.590
 takes almonds handful and drives 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.489
 against each other then the shell dissolves 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.930
 also quite good 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:36.849
 you really just have to go there 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.430
 peel pieces out so poland and that 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:40.180
 disconnect stop everything goes then 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.099
 a bit faster 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.659
 and if you have that done then 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:45.340
 you also have your blanched lack 

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:48.099
 and you have 50 percent of the price 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.139
 Saved yes sometimes even the Sun and 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:51.909
 then you want to manufacture 

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:54.129
 it went on in the recipe so on 

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:55.930
 that you put the almonds in a pan 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:59.129
 Dry on rust so that still one 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:01.689
 become a bit more aromatic and afterwards 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:03.760
 then give her the rusty almonds 

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:06.040
 into a high vessel and try that with 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.599
 puree a blender and give 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.730
 if necessary, something else from the oehler 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:12.639
 To stand in the recipe has absolutely nothing 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.470
 works means staab has immediately 

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:15.909
 blocked 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.260
 That's why I have the strategy then 

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:19.030
 changed and in one 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.500
 kitchen machine given that I have myself 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.599
 then read again in other recipes 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.060
 that probably news appeared good 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:26.349
 I also tried working 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.849
 works for me at all 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:31.389
 did not have to go back in between 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:32.829
 pause and the the almonds shards of 

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:35.530
 scratch off edge because they are there 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:38.560
 have set and then again through 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.449
 mix and so and the finest I do 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.579
 had done so then looked like this 

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:45.129
 that was more son Manuel dust 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:49.090
 So individual needs has not really 

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:50.290
 but who does not work that works 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.609
 end of the story if I do not 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.290
 could have done my blender 

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:56.290
 finally destroy 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:59.210
 yes, I was then when the camera was off 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:02.690
 again this finished 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:04.610
 Lack of mail then in the high vessel 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:06.490
 returned and I just tried that 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:09.710
 imperia state cure and thereby 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:12.050
 I overheated my blender and 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:13.610
 he finally destroyed it and broke it 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:14.960
 Enlightened no longer has then 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:17.630
 started smoking 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:19.400
 out of the heads of the housing 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.410
 urges really smoke it stank 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.900
 totally and broken it forever 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.520
 Well you can not do anything if you 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.220
 ever Mandl must be successful 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.120
 have posted like that in the 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.920

 or if you make the proposal from me 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.950
 have done wrong or so then 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:35.990
 I would like to try it again soon 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:37.700
 I have my new report've gained 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.110
 maybe small for christmas 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.540
 perhaps bestowed would be quite good 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:45.500
