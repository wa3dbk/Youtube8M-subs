00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.160 
why at least in my experience when
swimming<00:01:29.549> in<00:01:29.670> my<00:01:29.820> own<00:01:29.939> personal<00:01:30.479> pool<00:01:30.750> it's

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
swimming in my own personal pool it's

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.080 
swimming in my own personal pool it's
easier<00:01:31.680> on<00:01:31.799> my<00:01:31.920> eyes<00:01:31.950> than<00:01:32.520> when<00:01:32.640> I'm<00:01:32.729> swimming

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
easier on my eyes than when I'm swimming

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.789 
easier on my eyes than when I'm swimming
in<00:01:33.180> like<00:01:33.329> a<00:01:33.360> public<00:01:33.840> pool<00:01:34.020> or<00:01:34.229> like<00:01:34.380> at<00:01:34.530> a<00:01:34.560> pool

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
in like a public pool or like at a pool

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.190 
in like a public pool or like at a pool
at<00:01:34.920> a<00:01:34.950> hotel<00:01:34.979> I<00:01:35.630> think<00:01:36.630> that<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.810> reason<00:01:36.990> why

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
at a hotel I think that the reason why

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.050 
at a hotel I think that the reason why
is<00:01:37.259> because<00:01:37.409> pools<00:01:37.950> at<00:01:38.070> hotels<00:01:38.460> are<00:01:38.670> highly

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
is because pools at hotels are highly

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.179 
is because pools at hotels are highly
chlorinated<00:01:39.329> more<00:01:39.990> so<00:01:40.259> than<00:01:40.500> pools<00:01:40.799> in

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
chlorinated more so than pools in

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.039 
chlorinated more so than pools in
residential<00:01:41.790> areas<00:01:42.060> at<00:01:42.570> least<00:01:42.600> that's<00:01:42.869> what<00:01:43.020> I

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
residential areas at least that's what I

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.050 
residential areas at least that's what I
think<00:01:43.320> because<00:01:43.530> you<00:01:44.340> know<00:01:44.369> I'm<00:01:44.520> sure<00:01:44.579> public

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
think because you know I'm sure public

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.670 
think because you know I'm sure public
pools<00:01:45.420> have<00:01:45.689> like<00:01:45.869> little<00:01:46.110> kids<00:01:46.290> peeing<00:01:46.560> in

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
pools have like little kids peeing in

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.330 
pools have like little kids peeing in
them<00:01:46.799> and<00:01:46.920> stuff<00:01:47.070> like<00:01:47.189> that<00:01:47.479> um<00:01:48.479> but<00:01:49.470> chlorine

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
them and stuff like that um but chlorine

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.249 
them and stuff like that um but chlorine
is<00:01:50.520> basically<00:01:50.880> an<00:01:51.060> agent<00:01:51.540> that<00:01:51.720> people<00:01:52.020> put

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
is basically an agent that people put

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.319 
is basically an agent that people put
into<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.619> water<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:53.250> kind<00:01:53.430> of<00:01:53.549> combat<00:01:54.030> that

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
into the water to kind of combat that

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.209 
into the water to kind of combat that
algae<00:01:54.810> from<00:01:54.930> forming<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:55.680> also<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:55.979> kill

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
algae from forming and also to kill

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.420 
algae from forming and also to kill
bodily<00:01:56.850> bacteria<00:01:57.479> and<00:01:57.719> things<00:01:57.990> like<00:01:58.170> that<00:01:58.469> and

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
bodily bacteria and things like that and

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.039 
bodily bacteria and things like that and
without<00:01:59.579> it<00:01:59.969> our<00:02:00.119> pools<00:02:00.420> would<00:02:00.540> all<00:02:00.659> be<00:02:00.810> green

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
without it our pools would all be green

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.990 
without it our pools would all be green
now<00:02:01.320> I'm<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:01.740> doctor<00:02:02.369> but<00:02:02.549> I<00:02:02.610> know<00:02:02.670> that<00:02:02.909> a<00:02:02.939> lot

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
now I'm a doctor but I know that a lot

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.850 
now I'm a doctor but I know that a lot
of<00:02:03.299> people<00:02:03.600> have<00:02:03.780> complained<00:02:04.200> about<00:02:04.320> itchy

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
rashy skin after they get out of the

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.260 
rashy skin after they get out of the
pool<00:02:07.170> and<00:02:07.500> um<00:02:07.979> some<00:02:08.520> people<00:02:08.789> attribute<00:02:09.000> that

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
pool and um some people attribute that

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.820 
pool and um some people attribute that
to<00:02:09.330> chlorine<00:02:09.840> and<00:02:10.110> if<00:02:10.170> you<00:02:10.259> have<00:02:10.410> a<00:02:10.440> chlorine

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
to chlorine and if you have a chlorine

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.530 
to chlorine and if you have a chlorine
allergy<00:02:11.400> or<00:02:11.430> eczema<00:02:11.940> that<00:02:12.209> could<00:02:12.390> definitely

allergy or eczema that could definitely

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.990 
allergy or eczema that could definitely
be

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
be

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.790 
be
a triggering<00:02:13.510> factor<00:02:13.930> but<00:02:14.110> another<00:02:14.380> thing<00:02:14.650> it

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
a triggering factor but another thing it

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.530 
a triggering factor but another thing it
could<00:02:15.010> be<00:02:15.220> just<00:02:15.460> being<00:02:15.730> in<00:02:15.880> the<00:02:15.970> water<00:02:16.210> for<00:02:16.480> a

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
could be just being in the water for a

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.050 
could be just being in the water for a
long<00:02:16.660> period<00:02:17.080> of<00:02:17.110> time<00:02:17.410> if<00:02:17.680> you<00:02:18.250> bitchy<00:02:18.670> Raschi

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
long period of time if you bitchy Raschi

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.790 
long period of time if you bitchy Raschi
feeling<00:02:19.510> you're<00:02:19.660> getting<00:02:19.990> is<00:02:20.140> the<00:02:20.290> same<00:02:20.560> as

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
feeling you're getting is the same as

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.770 
feeling you're getting is the same as
being<00:02:21.070> in<00:02:21.160> a<00:02:21.250> bathtub<00:02:21.520> then<00:02:22.450> it's<00:02:22.600> probably

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
being in a bathtub then it's probably

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.470 
being in a bathtub then it's probably
caused<00:02:23.290> by<00:02:23.440> water<00:02:23.920> and<00:02:24.310> not<00:02:24.580> by<00:02:24.790> chlorine<00:02:25.120> and

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
caused by water and not by chlorine and

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.420 
caused by water and not by chlorine and
there<00:02:25.780> may<00:02:26.080> be<00:02:26.110> trace<00:02:26.620> amounts<00:02:27.070> of<00:02:27.130> chlorine

there may be trace amounts of chlorine

there may be trace amounts of chlorine

and bath water or tap water but

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.120 
and bath water or tap water but
generally<00:02:30.959> people<00:02:31.959> can<00:02:32.290> be<00:02:32.470> irritated<00:02:32.980> from

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
generally people can be irritated from

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.790 
generally people can be irritated from
just<00:02:33.340> water<00:02:33.580> alone<00:02:34.030> so<00:02:34.930> keep<00:02:35.140> that<00:02:35.290> in<00:02:35.350> mind<00:02:35.650> if

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
just water alone so keep that in mind if

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.500 
just water alone so keep that in mind if
you<00:02:35.890> do<00:02:36.040> your<00:02:36.190> rash<00:02:36.340> you're<00:02:36.580> irritated<00:02:37.150> see<00:02:37.330> is

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
you do your rash you're irritated see is

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.300 
you do your rash you're irritated see is
it<00:02:37.630> in<00:02:37.750> all<00:02:37.959> water<00:02:38.170> or<00:02:38.500> is<00:02:38.560> it<00:02:38.680> just<00:02:38.890> in<00:02:39.040> pools

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
it in all water or is it just in pools

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.460 
it in all water or is it just in pools
because<00:02:39.520> when<00:02:39.670> you're<00:02:39.820> in<00:02:40.030> water<00:02:40.870> for<00:02:41.200> a<00:02:41.230> long

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
because when you're in water for a long

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.190 
because when you're in water for a long
period<00:02:42.130> of<00:02:42.160> time<00:02:42.459> it<00:02:42.880> kind<00:02:43.120> of<00:02:43.240> deals<00:02:43.959> with<00:02:44.080> the

period of time it kind of deals with the

different cells in the skin and can

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.550 
different cells in the skin and can
alter<00:02:45.850> them<00:02:45.970> in<00:02:46.120> different<00:02:46.239> ways<00:02:46.450> for<00:02:47.260> me

alter them in different ways for me
every<00:02:48.100> single<00:02:48.430> time<00:02:48.610> I<00:02:48.640> take<00:02:48.970> a<00:02:49.000> shower<00:02:49.090> for

more than 10 or 15 minutes I like get

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.150 
more than 10 or 15 minutes I like get
these<00:02:52.270> like<00:02:52.510> red<00:02:52.840> bumps<00:02:53.380> and<00:02:53.590> they're<00:02:53.739> not<00:02:53.890> red

these like red bumps and they're not red

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.770 
these like red bumps and they're not red
they're<00:02:54.340> more<00:02:54.489> like<00:02:54.670> pink<00:02:55.060> and<00:02:55.239> it's<00:02:55.420> only<00:02:55.600> if

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
they're more like pink and it's only if

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.140 
they're more like pink and it's only if
I<00:02:55.900> scratch<00:02:56.380> or<00:02:56.709> if<00:02:56.800> I<00:02:56.860> catch<00:02:57.070> myself<00:02:57.340> but<00:02:58.030> the

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
I scratch or if I catch myself but the

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.610 
I scratch or if I catch myself but the
same<00:02:58.360> thing<00:02:58.600> happens<00:02:58.900> in<00:02:59.050> the<00:02:59.080> pool<00:02:59.350> and<00:02:59.530> that

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
same thing happens in the pool and that

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.620 
same thing happens in the pool and that
tells<00:02:59.920> me<00:03:00.190> that<00:03:00.220> it's<00:03:00.550> not<00:03:00.790> just<00:03:00.820> the<00:03:01.270> chlorine

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
tells me that it's not just the chlorine

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.180 
tells me that it's not just the chlorine
but<00:03:01.810> it's<00:03:01.959> probably<00:03:02.230> something<00:03:02.680> in<00:03:02.890> the<00:03:03.010> water

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
but it's probably something in the water

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.010 
but it's probably something in the water
or<00:03:03.580> something<00:03:04.239> that<00:03:04.330> has<00:03:04.450> to<00:03:04.600> do<00:03:04.690> with<00:03:04.720> being

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:05.020 
or something that has to do with being

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.780 
or something that has to do with being
in<00:03:05.140> the<00:03:05.200> water<00:03:05.410> a<00:03:05.500> lot<00:03:05.739> or<00:03:06.220> something<00:03:06.670> that's

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
in the water a lot or something that's

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.810 
in the water a lot or something that's
in<00:03:07.030> my<00:03:07.570> tap<00:03:07.930> water<00:03:07.959> in<00:03:08.620> my<00:03:08.860> shower<00:03:09.100> what<00:03:09.489> it's

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
in my tap water in my shower what it's

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.610 
in my tap water in my shower what it's
also<00:03:10.000> in<00:03:10.209> the<00:03:10.270> pool<00:03:10.480> water<00:03:10.660> um<00:03:11.050> so<00:03:11.440> you<00:03:11.530> may

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
also in the pool water um so you may

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.020 
also in the pool water um so you may
want<00:03:11.830> to<00:03:11.920> talk<00:03:12.100> to<00:03:12.190> your<00:03:12.280> doctor<00:03:12.520> you<00:03:12.670> may<00:03:12.820> want

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
want to talk to your doctor you may want

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.620 
want to talk to your doctor you may want
to<00:03:13.060> figure<00:03:13.300> that<00:03:13.420> out

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
to figure that out

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.360 
to figure that out
but<00:03:14.350> for<00:03:14.470> those<00:03:14.530> of<00:03:14.590> you<00:03:14.770> who<00:03:14.890> think<00:03:15.070> you<00:03:15.220> have

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
but for those of you who think you have

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.640 
but for those of you who think you have
a<00:03:15.400> chlorine<00:03:15.640> sensitivity<00:03:16.300> um<00:03:16.510> you<00:03:17.290> may<00:03:17.410> want

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
a chlorine sensitivity um you may want

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:18.840 
a chlorine sensitivity um you may want
to<00:03:17.709> do<00:03:17.799> a<00:03:17.830> little<00:03:17.980> bit<00:03:18.130> of<00:03:18.190> digging<00:03:18.340> because

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
to do a little bit of digging because

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:20.970 
to do a little bit of digging because
the<00:03:19.180> chlorine<00:03:19.420> might<00:03:19.810> not<00:03:20.019> be<00:03:20.230> exactly<00:03:20.470> what's

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
the chlorine might not be exactly what's

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.170 
the chlorine might not be exactly what's
bigger<00:03:21.160> evading<00:03:21.549> your<00:03:21.700> skin<00:03:21.940> now<00:03:22.120> the

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
bigger evading your skin now the

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.000 
bigger evading your skin now the
interesting<00:03:22.540> thing<00:03:22.780> here<00:03:23.230> is<00:03:23.410> that<00:03:23.440> chlorine

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
interesting thing here is that chlorine

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.080 
interesting thing here is that chlorine
kills<00:03:24.880> bacteria<00:03:25.239> in<00:03:25.989> the<00:03:26.080> pool<00:03:26.350> and<00:03:26.880> acne<00:03:27.880> in

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
kills bacteria in the pool and acne in

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.509 
kills bacteria in the pool and acne in
our<00:03:28.360> face<00:03:28.570> is<00:03:28.959> caused<00:03:29.260> by<00:03:29.560> bacteria

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
our face is caused by bacteria

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:32.490 
our face is caused by bacteria
now<00:03:30.880> obviously<00:03:31.209> the<00:03:31.959> chlorine<00:03:32.290> in<00:03:32.380> the<00:03:32.470> pool

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
now obviously the chlorine in the pool

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.770 
now obviously the chlorine in the pool
is<00:03:32.890> not<00:03:33.040> being<00:03:33.310> formulated<00:03:33.670> to<00:03:34.030> kill<00:03:34.239> the<00:03:34.360> acne

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
is not being formulated to kill the acne

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.620 
is not being formulated to kill the acne
bacteria<00:03:34.810> on<00:03:35.350> our<00:03:35.500> face<00:03:35.769> but<00:03:36.489> is<00:03:36.820> it<00:03:37.000> possible

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
bacteria on our face but is it possible

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.630 
bacteria on our face but is it possible
that<00:03:37.690> by<00:03:38.019> swimming<00:03:38.560> in<00:03:38.650> the<00:03:38.739> pool<00:03:38.980> and<00:03:39.250> being

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
that by swimming in the pool and being

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.150 
that by swimming in the pool and being
in<00:03:39.850> that<00:03:39.880> water<00:03:40.630> that<00:03:41.140> it<00:03:41.260> could<00:03:41.590> be<00:03:41.769> helping

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
in that water that it could be helping

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.009 
in that water that it could be helping
our<00:03:42.280> skin<00:03:42.670> some<00:03:42.970> people<00:03:43.269> say<00:03:43.450> yes<00:03:43.660> some<00:03:43.870> people

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
our skin some people say yes some people

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:47.100 
our skin some people say yes some people
say<00:03:44.260> no<00:03:44.620> as<00:03:45.489> much<00:03:45.910> as<00:03:46.180> many<00:03:46.510> times<00:03:46.750> as<00:03:46.840> I<00:03:46.959> went

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
say no as much as many times as I went

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.050 
say no as much as many times as I went
to<00:03:47.170> the<00:03:47.290> library<00:03:47.410> I<00:03:47.680> was<00:03:47.950> unable<00:03:48.190> to<00:03:48.250> find<00:03:48.760> like

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
to the library I was unable to find like

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.479 
to the library I was unable to find like
actual<00:03:50.019> studies<00:03:50.380> and<00:03:50.560> research<00:03:50.920> to<00:03:51.130> show<00:03:51.310> that

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
actual studies and research to show that

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:54.120 
actual studies and research to show that
so<00:03:52.450> no<00:03:52.570> one<00:03:52.660> exactly<00:03:52.900> know<00:03:53.170> for<00:03:53.350> sure<00:03:53.380> but

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.130 
so no one exactly know for sure but

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:55.860 
so no one exactly know for sure but
logically<00:03:54.700> it's<00:03:54.940> kind<00:03:55.180> of<00:03:55.269> the<00:03:55.390> thought<00:03:55.600> of

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
logically it's kind of the thought of

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.750 
logically it's kind of the thought of
does<00:03:56.350> the<00:03:56.709> chlorine<00:03:57.100> that<00:03:57.310> kills<00:03:57.610> the

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
does the chlorine that kills the

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.310 
does the chlorine that kills the
bacteria<00:03:57.880> does<00:03:58.329> that<00:03:58.450> also<00:03:58.630> kill<00:03:58.900> the<00:03:58.989> acne

00:03:59.310 --> 00:03:59.320 
bacteria does that also kill the acne

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.740 
bacteria does that also kill the acne
now<00:03:59.500> that<00:04:00.040> being<00:04:00.280> said<00:04:00.400> do<00:04:01.150> not<00:04:01.329> fill<00:04:01.570> up<00:04:01.690> a

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
now that being said do not fill up a

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.620 
now that being said do not fill up a
bathtub<00:04:01.930> and<00:04:02.500> dump<00:04:02.860> chlorine<00:04:03.280> in<00:04:03.430> there

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
bathtub and dump chlorine in there

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.940 
bathtub and dump chlorine in there
because<00:04:04.630> it<00:04:04.750> would<00:04:04.840> be<00:04:04.959> way<00:04:05.140> too<00:04:05.170> concentrated

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950 
because it would be way too concentrated

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:07.740 
because it would be way too concentrated
and<00:04:06.160> not<00:04:06.280> be<00:04:06.430> good<00:04:06.519> for<00:04:06.730> your<00:04:06.820> skin<00:04:07.120> I<00:04:07.390> am<00:04:07.570> NOT

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
and not be good for your skin I am NOT

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.030 
and not be good for your skin I am NOT
saying<00:04:08.019> that<00:04:08.230> chlorine<00:04:08.470> is<00:04:08.620> going<00:04:08.769> to<00:04:08.829> help

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
saying that chlorine is going to help

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.550 
saying that chlorine is going to help
acne<00:04:09.459> but<00:04:09.850> I'm<00:04:10.000> saying<00:04:10.360> that<00:04:10.690> it's<00:04:11.079> probably

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
acne but I'm saying that it's probably

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.259 
acne but I'm saying that it's probably
not<00:04:12.100> hurting<00:04:12.519> it<00:04:12.640> because<00:04:12.850> if<00:04:12.970> it<00:04:13.060> kills

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:13.269 
not hurting it because if it kills

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:14.640 
not hurting it because if it kills
bacteria<00:04:13.420> it's<00:04:13.930> probably<00:04:14.440> doing<00:04:14.560> the<00:04:14.620> same

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
bacteria it's probably doing the same

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.349 
bacteria it's probably doing the same
thing<00:04:14.890> in<00:04:14.950> your<00:04:15.010> face<00:04:15.160> if<00:04:15.459> you<00:04:15.790> do<00:04:16.000> that<00:04:16.120> in<00:04:16.299> the

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
thing in your face if you do that in the

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:18.240 
thing in your face if you do that in the
bathtub<00:04:16.810> though<00:04:16.959> it<00:04:17.260> will<00:04:17.440> it's<00:04:17.799> very<00:04:18.040> very

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
bathtub though it will it's very very

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.430 
bathtub though it will it's very very
toxic<00:04:18.489> like<00:04:19.000> I<00:04:19.120> said<00:04:19.299> corn<00:04:19.600> is<00:04:19.750> a<00:04:19.780> gas<00:04:20.079> that<00:04:20.109> was

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
toxic like I said corn is a gas that was

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.920 
toxic like I said corn is a gas that was
meant<00:04:20.650> to<00:04:20.709> kill<00:04:21.010> people<00:04:21.220> um<00:04:21.640> I<00:04:22.570> would<00:04:22.780> not

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
meant to kill people um I would not

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.540 
meant to kill people um I would not
recommend<00:04:23.110> messing<00:04:23.740> around<00:04:23.860> with<00:04:24.070> it<00:04:24.220> at<00:04:24.340> all

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
recommend messing around with it at all

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.320 
recommend messing around with it at all
unless<00:04:24.820> you<00:04:25.330> are<00:04:25.479> swimming<00:04:25.720> in<00:04:25.900> a<00:04:25.990> pool

it could be very very dangerous um but I
have<00:04:30.259> personally<00:04:30.740> noticed<00:04:31.099> that<00:04:31.280> when<00:04:31.430> I<00:04:31.460> swim

00:04:31.869 --> 00:04:31.879

more<00:04:32.120> in<00:04:32.270> the<00:04:32.360> summer<00:04:32.569> I<00:04:32.870> do<00:04:32.960> feel<00:04:33.680> like<00:04:33.860> I<00:04:34.069> my

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
more in the summer I do feel like I my

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.390 
more in the summer I do feel like I my
acne<00:04:35.000> is<00:04:35.120> better<00:04:35.469> but<00:04:36.469> is<00:04:36.590> that<00:04:36.830> attributed<00:04:37.069> to

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
acne is better but is that attributed to

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.589 
acne is better but is that attributed to
chlorine<00:04:37.610> one<00:04:38.000> thought<00:04:38.210> is<00:04:38.389> that<00:04:38.419> the

00:04:38.589 --> 00:04:38.599 
chlorine one thought is that the

00:04:38.599 --> 00:04:40.059 
chlorine one thought is that the
chlorine<00:04:38.840> is<00:04:38.990> killing<00:04:39.289> the<00:04:39.349> bacteria<00:04:39.500> but<00:04:39.979> the

00:04:40.059 --> 00:04:40.069 
chlorine is killing the bacteria but the

00:04:40.069 --> 00:04:41.800 
chlorine is killing the bacteria but the
other<00:04:40.189> thought<00:04:40.400> is<00:04:40.460> you're<00:04:40.969> in<00:04:41.090> the<00:04:41.180> water<00:04:41.389> and

there were other years where I would

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:09.390 
there were other years where I would
totally<00:07:07.720> avoid<00:07:08.140> the<00:07:08.290> pool<00:07:08.500> and<00:07:08.800> sit<00:07:09.130> on<00:07:09.160> the

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:11.050 
side and be very sad because I wanted to

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:12.150 
side and be very sad because I wanted to
go<00:07:11.140> in<00:07:11.260> that<00:07:11.470> I<00:07:11.500> was<00:07:11.560> afraid<00:07:11.860> it<00:07:11.950> was<00:07:12.040> gonna

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:12.160 
go in that I was afraid it was gonna

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.250 
go in that I was afraid it was gonna
hurt<00:07:12.340> my<00:07:12.490> acne<00:07:12.880> so<00:07:13.450> that's<00:07:13.600> just<00:07:13.690> what<00:07:13.900> I<00:07:13.930> think

hurt my acne so that's just what I think

hurt my acne so that's just what I think
I<00:07:14.410> think<00:07:14.620> it<00:07:14.710> helps<00:07:14.950> more<00:07:15.100> than<00:07:15.280> hurts<00:07:15.460> but<00:07:16.300> I

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:16.330 
I think it helps more than hurts but I
