00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
doing that I'm sorry I'm take that down

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.530 
doing that I'm sorry I'm take that down
anyways<00:01:51.840> so<00:01:52.590> if<00:01:53.189> I<00:01:53.460> was<00:01:53.549> to<00:01:53.610> compare<00:01:54.030> black<00:01:54.299> ops

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
anyways so if I was to compare black ops

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.530 
anyways so if I was to compare black ops
with<00:01:54.869> modern<00:01:55.259> warfare<00:01:55.409> 3<00:01:55.590> or<00:01:56.310> even<00:01:56.700> black<00:01:57.299> ops

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
with modern warfare 3 or even black ops

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.050 
with modern warfare 3 or even black ops
with<00:01:57.810> modern<00:01:58.409> warfare<00:01:58.619> two<00:01:59.009> you<00:01:59.640> can<00:01:59.820> see<00:02:00.030> a

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
with modern warfare two you can see a

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.289 
with modern warfare two you can see a
major<00:02:00.450> difference<00:02:00.719> like<00:02:01.530> some<00:02:02.070> people<00:02:02.430> you

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
major difference like some people you

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.990 
major difference like some people you
know<00:02:03.829> will<00:02:04.829> be<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.310> opposite<00:02:05.640> I'll<00:02:05.790> be<00:02:05.880> like

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
know will be the opposite I'll be like

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.700 
know will be the opposite I'll be like
yeah<00:02:06.180> black<00:02:06.420> wildebeest<00:02:06.600> you<00:02:07.409> know<00:02:07.530> it's<00:02:07.649> the

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
yeah black wildebeest you know it's the

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.460 
yeah black wildebeest you know it's the
