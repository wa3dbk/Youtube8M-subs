00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:02.520
 this is the place today 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.660
 imagine the m2m market 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.749
 it is a rounding of the 8 

00:00:08.369 --> 00:00:10.399
 has the features 

00:00:10.399 --> 00:00:14.739
 in 95 or in the sister model 95 8 gigawatts 

00:00:14.739 --> 00:00:17.739
 and can be a coach for the first time 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.929
 Overall, the processing of the device is rather mixed 

00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:27.419
 Many devices both had a clearly perceptible scarce 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.829
 A model is still relatively well processed, models already belong 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:36.740
 were louder 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.840
 This scarce seems to increase over time, but ultimately with 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.330
 fix tighter pressure on the keyboard in the short term 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.630
 not beautiful and did not speak for Nokia and these devices belong 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.040
 so not as well as in the repair 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.610
 the drivers blinded and in the sun and consists of a small part 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:56.430
 metal 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.240
 the back is dressed in a kind of Beijing basic material the color combination 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.130
 necessarily Nokia with easy 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.970
 with Sync was born Titanium 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.160
 the camera cover is back 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.520
 protected by an animal a slider activates this and also the camera on 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.350
 on the right side the usual actions are loudly quiet 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.250
 or digital zoom the button for the real estate gallery and the 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.150
 Camera button 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:24.660
 new the fact 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.200
 this accounts for 80 more speakers on the right side this time 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.700
 but with enough phonetics but something tinny 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.420
 The underside is only used in front of microphones 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.590
 the left outside of the Pointe usb port 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.770
 So what's the name of a new cable but what's included? 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.900
 are heard Christmassy 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.540
 the Nicholas the Kamper mountain the new prisoners has the camera works 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.220
 and reloading the honor guard 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.270
 for 2 after 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:54.580
 the top 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.410
 me and that at one of the one off or respectively 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.410
 PowerColor 5-millimeter jack connection 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.729
 the only new feature worth mentioning are the two active top 3 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.560
 that they basically turn the menu together with dementia for Christmas 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.209
 becomes 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:17.420
 that does not work in standby until spring but only in one in the 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.629
 position 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:22.979
 so turned 

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:24.329
 and sometimes 

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:26.849
 with some momentum also back again 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:30.389
 Trigger this defect from the internal movement of the indignant 

00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:31.010
 the one for the
