tests as up to 40 miles an hour we're
going<00:00:26.490> three<00:00:27.330> times<00:00:27.380> faster<00:00:28.490> partly<00:00:29.490> because

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
going three times faster partly because

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.030 
going three times faster partly because
modern<00:00:30.060> cars<00:00:30.449> can<00:00:30.720> reach<00:00:30.960> such<00:00:31.260> speed<00:00:31.650> and

modern cars can reach such speed and
partly<00:00:32.790> because<00:00:32.820> we're<00:00:33.270> curious<00:00:33.570> as<00:00:33.960> to<00:00:34.200> what

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
partly because we're curious as to what

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.830 
partly because we're curious as to what
would<00:00:34.440> happen<00:00:34.860> if<00:00:35.399> a<00:00:35.610> car<00:00:35.820> is<00:00:35.850> exposed<00:00:36.450> to<00:00:36.570> such

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
would happen if a car is exposed to such

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.410 
would happen if a car is exposed to such
enormous<00:00:37.260> forces

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
enormous forces

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.350 
enormous forces
at<00:00:40.530> 120<00:00:41.530> miles<00:00:41.739> an<00:00:41.949> hour<00:00:42.070> our<00:00:42.640> experts<00:00:43.180> say

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:43.360 
at 120 miles an hour our experts say

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.090 
at 120 miles an hour our experts say
that<00:00:43.570> the<00:00:43.660> deformation<00:00:44.410> will<00:00:44.530> be<00:00:44.649> so<00:00:44.890> great

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.100 
that the deformation will be so great

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.799 
that the deformation will be so great
they're<00:00:45.640> not<00:00:45.820> prepared<00:00:46.269> to<00:00:46.329> use<00:00:46.570> their

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:46.809 
they're not prepared to use their

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:49.290 
they're not prepared to use their
expensive<00:00:47.530> traditional<00:00:48.519> crash-test<00:00:49.000> dummies

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.300 
expensive traditional crash-test dummies

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.299 
expensive traditional crash-test dummies
so<00:00:50.170> as<00:00:50.320> a<00:00:50.350> result<00:00:50.530> we've<00:00:50.829> got<00:00:50.949> to<00:00:51.039> use<00:00:51.129> these

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:51.309 
so as a result we've got to use these

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:53.790 
so as a result we've got to use these
guns<00:00:51.610> these<00:00:52.329> are<00:00:52.600> shopfront<00:00:53.199> mannequins

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:53.800 
guns these are shopfront mannequins

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.619 
guns these are shopfront mannequins
these<00:00:54.339> will<00:00:54.460> hopefully<00:00:54.699> give<00:00:55.030> an<00:00:55.149> idea<00:00:55.269> of

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:55.629 
these will hopefully give an idea of

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:57.299 
these will hopefully give an idea of
what<00:00:56.199> it<00:00:56.320> might<00:00:56.409> be<00:00:56.559> like<00:00:56.589> for<00:00:56.949> human<00:00:57.219> to

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:57.309 
what it might be like for human to

00:00:57.309 --> 00:00:59.819 
what it might be like for human to
experience<00:00:57.850> a<00:00:58.000> head-on<00:00:58.530> 120<00:00:59.530> mile<00:00:59.680> an<00:00:59.739> hour

00:00:59.819 --> 00:00:59.829 
experience a head-on 120 mile an hour

as the car was wheeled into position I

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:17.020 
as the car was wheeled into position I
had<00:01:15.229> nothing<00:01:15.439> else<00:01:15.710> to<00:01:15.890> do<00:01:16.100> but<00:01:16.280> watch<00:01:16.490> on<00:01:16.820> and

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
had nothing else to do but watch on and

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.169 
had nothing else to do but watch on and

the fort of such an impact sent shivers

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:26.100 
the fort of such an impact sent shivers
down<00:01:23.000> my<00:01:23.240> spine

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:27.720 

it's<00:01:26.650> round<00:01:26.860> about<00:01:27.100> this<00:01:27.250> time<00:01:27.460> that<00:01:27.490> I<00:01:27.610> get

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:27.730 
it's round about this time that I get

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:31.200 
it's round about this time that I get
quite<00:01:28.240> nervous<00:01:28.510> is<00:01:29.550> the<00:01:30.550> sound<00:01:30.850> of<00:01:31.120> an

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
accident is just catastrophic but these

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.330 
accident is just catastrophic but these
guys<00:01:34.930> have<00:01:34.990> never<00:01:35.350> actually<00:01:35.590> tested<00:01:36.070> a<00:01:36.130> car

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
guys have never actually tested a car
