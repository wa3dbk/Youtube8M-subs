what<00:00:07.259> it<00:00:07.319> looks<00:00:07.500> like<00:00:07.620> when<00:00:07.830> I<00:00:07.859> stretch<00:00:08.189> paper

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
what it looks like when I stretch paper

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:14.740 
what it looks like when I stretch paper
I<00:00:08.880> showed<00:00:09.750> you<00:00:09.900> how<00:00:10.019> I<00:00:10.110> built<00:00:10.410> these<00:00:10.620> boards

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:14.750 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.330 

but<00:00:15.750> this<00:00:16.080> is<00:00:16.199> this<00:00:16.529> is<00:00:16.650> a<00:00:16.680> big<00:00:16.859> roll<00:00:17.039> of<00:00:17.070> paper

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
but this is this is a big roll of paper

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.120 
but this is this is a big roll of paper
I<00:00:18.150> just<00:00:18.330> kind<00:00:18.960> of<00:00:19.020> rigged<00:00:19.199> up<00:00:19.320> this<00:00:19.590> thing<00:00:19.859> work

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
I just kind of rigged up this thing work

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.420 
I just kind of rigged up this thing work
it's<00:00:20.670> it's<00:00:21.000> hanging<00:00:21.420> and<00:00:21.660> this<00:00:22.289> paper<00:00:22.650> is

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
it's it's hanging and this paper is

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.200 
it's it's hanging and this paper is
really<00:00:23.670> tight<00:00:24.920> and<00:00:25.920> it<00:00:26.130> almost<00:00:26.369> requires<00:00:27.000> that

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
really tight and it almost requires that

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.240 
really tight and it almost requires that
you<00:00:27.359> have<00:00:27.480> somebody<00:00:27.750> help<00:00:28.019> you<00:00:28.220> because<00:00:29.220> you

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
you have somebody help you because you

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.820 
you have somebody help you because you
you<00:00:29.820> can't<00:00:30.060> pull<00:00:30.300> it<00:00:30.330> and<00:00:30.689> then<00:00:30.869> cut<00:00:31.170> it<00:00:31.199> so<00:00:31.590> but

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
you can't pull it and then cut it so but

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.569 
you can't pull it and then cut it so but
what<00:00:32.009> I<00:00:32.040> do<00:00:32.160> is<00:00:33.710> I'll<00:00:34.710> take<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:35.040> size<00:00:35.250> board

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
what I do is I'll take the size board

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:49.700 
what I do is I'll take the size board
that<00:00:35.760> I<00:00:35.790> want<00:00:36.059> to<00:00:36.149> use<00:00:36.300> it<00:00:36.480> on<00:00:48.410> close<00:00:49.410> enough

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
that I want to use it on close enough

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:50.959 
that I want to use it on close enough
okay

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
okay

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:57.200 
okay
so<00:00:53.870> I've<00:00:54.870> already<00:00:55.079> got<00:00:55.460> some<00:00:56.460> water<00:00:56.730> ready<00:00:57.000> to

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
so I've already got some water ready to

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:04.929 
so I've already got some water ready to
go<00:00:58.670> in<00:00:59.670> a<00:00:59.910> tub<00:01:00.410> you<00:01:01.410> can<00:01:01.559> use<00:01:01.680> your<00:01:01.800> bathtub<00:01:03.650> the

00:01:04.929 --> 00:01:04.939 
go in a tub you can use your bathtub the

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:18.200 
go in a tub you can use your bathtub the
second<00:01:05.939> floor<00:01:15.259> water<00:01:16.369> and<00:01:17.369> what<00:01:17.850> I'm<00:01:17.939> gonna<00:01:18.030> do

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
second floor water and what I'm gonna do

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.440 
second floor water and what I'm gonna do
is<00:01:18.360> just<00:01:18.860> get<00:01:19.860> this<00:01:20.070> close<00:01:20.369> you<00:01:20.759> notice<00:01:21.360> I

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
is just get this close you notice I

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.700 
is just get this close you notice I
don't<00:01:21.509> care<00:01:21.810> too<00:01:21.990> much<00:01:22.020> about<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.439> edges

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
don't care too much about the edges

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.740 
don't care too much about the edges
being<00:01:22.860> perfect<00:01:23.340> because<00:01:24.090> it's<00:01:24.330> really<00:01:24.509> hard

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
being perfect because it's really hard

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:40.340 
being perfect because it's really hard
to<00:01:24.869> cut<00:01:38.479> completely<00:01:39.479> wet<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:39.990> you<00:01:40.049> can<00:01:40.200> see

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
to cut completely wet and you can see

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.480 
to cut completely wet and you can see
here's<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.650> one<00:01:40.710> I<00:01:40.860> just<00:01:40.950> put<00:01:41.159> in<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:41.460> few

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
here's the one I just put in a few

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.319 
here's the one I just put in a few
minutes<00:01:41.939> ago<00:01:42.030> it's<00:01:42.750> already<00:01:43.110> starting<00:01:43.530> to<00:01:44.329> to

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
minutes ago it's already starting to to

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.539 
minutes ago it's already starting to to
unwind<00:01:46.430> it's<00:01:47.430> relaxing<00:01:47.970> its<00:01:48.149> unwinding<00:01:48.689> so

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549 
unwind it's relaxing its unwinding so

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:53.630 
unwind it's relaxing its unwinding so
about<00:01:50.549> 20<00:01:51.000> minutes<00:01:51.299> maybe<00:01:52.079> as<00:01:52.500> much<00:01:52.740> as<00:01:52.799> 45

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
about 20 minutes maybe as much as 45

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.539 
about 20 minutes maybe as much as 45
minutes<00:01:54.119> if<00:01:54.659> you<00:01:54.930> do<00:01:55.110> it<00:01:55.229> too<00:01:55.409> quickly<00:01:55.590> the

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
minutes if you do it too quickly the

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.789 
minutes if you do it too quickly the
paper<00:01:56.790> won't<00:01:57.060> expand<00:01:57.479> enough<00:01:57.780> if<00:01:58.380> you<00:01:58.590> leave

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
paper won't expand enough if you leave

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.679 
paper won't expand enough if you leave
it<00:01:58.920> in<00:01:59.040> there<00:01:59.189> for<00:01:59.430> more<00:01:59.610> than<00:01:59.880> 45<00:02:00.180> minutes<00:02:00.479> or

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
it in there for more than 45 minutes or

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.380 
it in there for more than 45 minutes or
maybe<00:02:00.869> an<00:02:00.990> hour<00:02:01.140> it<00:02:01.770> expands<00:02:02.490> so<00:02:02.759> much<00:02:03.030> that<00:02:03.299> it

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
maybe an hour it expands so much that it

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.359 
maybe an hour it expands so much that it
gets<00:02:03.630> kind<00:02:03.840> of<00:02:03.899> soft<00:02:04.200> and<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.590> paper<00:02:04.799> loses

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
gets kind of soft and the paper loses

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.910 
gets kind of soft and the paper loses
its<00:02:05.549> strength<00:02:05.909> it<00:02:06.420> expands<00:02:06.960> too<00:02:07.140> much<00:02:07.350> when

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
its strength it expands too much when

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.490 
its strength it expands too much when
you<00:02:07.950> staple<00:02:08.459> it<00:02:08.550> down<00:02:08.580> and<00:02:09.420> it<00:02:09.569> dries<00:02:09.899> back<00:02:10.289> to

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
you staple it down and it dries back to

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.920 
you staple it down and it dries back to
its<00:02:10.679> original<00:02:10.800> size<00:02:11.670> it<00:02:12.000> could<00:02:12.120> actually<00:02:12.270> tear

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
its original size it could actually tear

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.289 
its original size it could actually tear
the<00:02:13.079> staples<00:02:13.500> so<00:02:13.709> somewhere<00:02:14.640> between<00:02:14.700> 20<00:02:15.269> and

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299 
the staples so somewhere between 20 and

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:17.360 
the staples so somewhere between 20 and
40<00:02:15.750> minutes<00:02:16.019> I<00:02:16.109> think<00:02:16.319> is<00:02:16.409> about<00:02:16.620> right<00:02:16.920> this

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
40 minutes I think is about right this

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.160 
40 minutes I think is about right this
paper<00:02:17.579> is<00:02:17.730> a<00:02:17.790> little<00:02:18.000> thicker<00:02:18.209> than<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:18.959> sheet

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
paper is a little thicker than the sheet

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.550 
paper is a little thicker than the sheet
paper<00:02:19.409> this<00:02:19.680> is<00:02:19.859> 156<00:02:20.609> pounds<00:02:20.760> at<00:02:21.090> 140<00:02:21.659> pound<00:02:21.840> so

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
paper this is 156 pounds at 140 pound so

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.470 
paper this is 156 pounds at 140 pound so
if<00:02:23.219> you<00:02:23.400> were<00:02:23.519> using<00:02:23.549> a<00:02:23.819> hundred<00:02:23.939> forty<00:02:24.299> pound

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
if you were using a hundred forty pound

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.849 
if you were using a hundred forty pound
maybe<00:02:24.780> it<00:02:24.930> wouldn't<00:02:25.109> be<00:02:25.170> twenty<00:02:25.469> to<00:02:25.560> forty

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:25.859 
maybe it wouldn't be twenty to forty

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:27.890 
maybe it wouldn't be twenty to forty
minutes<00:02:25.980> maybe<00:02:26.700> maybe<00:02:27.090> would<00:02:27.269> be<00:02:27.299> closer<00:02:27.629> as<00:02:27.840> a

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
minutes maybe maybe would be closer as a

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.149 
minutes maybe maybe would be closer as a
twenty<00:02:28.140> to<00:02:28.260> thirty<00:02:28.500> five<00:02:28.680> minutes<00:02:29.069> or

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:29.159 
twenty to thirty five minutes or

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:30.740 
twenty to thirty five minutes or
something<00:02:29.370> like<00:02:29.459> that<00:02:29.519> I<00:02:29.760> don't<00:02:29.819> know<00:02:29.969> but

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
something like that I don't know but

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.629 
something like that I don't know but
experiment<00:02:31.260> with<00:02:31.379> this<00:02:31.530> so<00:02:32.250> I'm<00:02:32.370> gonna<00:02:32.459> turn

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:32.639 
experiment with this so I'm gonna turn

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:34.729 
experiment with this so I'm gonna turn
off<00:02:32.819> the<00:02:32.909> video<00:02:33.180> and<00:02:33.540> when<00:02:34.079> this<00:02:34.290> stuff<00:02:34.560> is

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
off the video and when this stuff is

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:36.949 
off the video and when this stuff is
ready<00:02:35.069> to<00:02:35.219> be<00:02:35.310> stapled<00:02:35.549> I'll<00:02:36.060> film<00:02:36.540> that<00:02:36.780> and

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
ready to be stapled I'll film that and

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:38.240 
ready to be stapled I'll film that and
you<00:02:37.019> can<00:02:37.170> see<00:02:37.319> how<00:02:37.439> I<00:02:37.469> staple<00:02:38.010> it<00:02:38.069> down<00:02:38.219> I

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
you can see how I staple it down I

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.830 
you can see how I staple it down I
sponge<00:02:38.670> it<00:02:38.819> and<00:02:38.909> I<00:02:38.939> staple<00:02:39.269> it<00:02:39.359> down<00:02:39.389> we'll<00:02:39.750> do

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
sponge it and I staple it down we'll do

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.830 
sponge it and I staple it down we'll do
that<00:02:39.989> next<00:02:40.819> okay<00:02:41.819> so<00:02:41.879> I've<00:02:42.090> got<00:02:42.120> the<00:02:42.299> paper

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
that next okay so I've got the paper

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.979 
that next okay so I've got the paper
soaking<00:02:43.500> and<00:02:43.920> it's<00:02:44.489> been<00:02:44.760> something<00:02:45.329> like<00:02:45.510> 20

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
soaking and it's been something like 20

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:47.869 
soaking and it's been something like 20
minutes<00:02:46.139> or<00:02:46.379> a<00:02:46.409> half<00:02:46.439> an<00:02:46.680> hour<00:02:46.829> and<00:02:47.609> you<00:02:47.669> can

minutes or a half an hour and you can
see<00:02:48.000> the<00:02:48.120> paper<00:02:48.329> is<00:02:48.540> nice<00:02:48.750> and<00:02:48.959> Limp<00:02:49.200> and<00:02:49.530> I've

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
see the paper is nice and Limp and I've

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.089 
see the paper is nice and Limp and I've
got<00:02:50.519> the<00:02:51.180> one<00:02:51.659> of<00:02:51.750> the<00:02:51.810> board's<00:02:52.139> here<00:02:52.379> and<00:02:52.980> what

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
got the one of the board's here and what

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:56.690 
got the one of the board's here and what
I'm<00:02:53.159> going<00:02:53.250> to<00:02:53.310> do<00:02:53.459> is<00:02:54.919> it's<00:02:55.919> all<00:02:56.069> soaking<00:02:56.579> wet

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
I'm going to do is it's all soaking wet

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.129 
I'm going to do is it's all soaking wet
and<00:02:56.760> that's<00:02:57.030> actually<00:02:57.480> fine<00:02:57.689> that's<00:02:57.959> good

and that's actually fine that's good
it's<00:02:58.349> gonna<00:02:58.609> the<00:02:59.609> water<00:02:59.879> is<00:03:00.120> on<00:03:00.269> the<00:03:00.389> back<00:03:00.569> side

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
it's gonna the water is on the back side

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.569 
it's gonna the water is on the back side
of<00:03:00.870> the<00:03:00.989> paper<00:03:01.169> and<00:03:01.709> actually<00:03:02.069> kind<00:03:02.189> of<00:03:02.310> glues

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:02.579 
of the paper and actually kind of glues

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:04.250 
of the paper and actually kind of glues
its<00:03:02.790> up<00:03:02.939> just<00:03:03.120> because<00:03:03.329> the<00:03:03.419> water<00:03:03.629> I<00:03:03.959> got<00:03:04.230> a

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
its up just because the water I got a

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.309 
its up just because the water I got a
clean<00:03:04.560> sponge<00:03:05.180> yeah<00:03:06.180> I'm<00:03:06.299> just<00:03:06.450> gonna<00:03:06.599> with<00:03:07.290> a

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
clean sponge yeah I'm just gonna with a

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:10.789 
clean sponge yeah I'm just gonna with a
very<00:03:07.709> very<00:03:08.010> wet<00:03:08.250> sponge<00:03:08.810> I'm<00:03:09.810> taking<00:03:10.530> out<00:03:10.590> all

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
very very wet sponge I'm taking out all

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:14.690 
very very wet sponge I'm taking out all
the<00:03:10.829> air<00:03:11.040> bubbles<00:03:11.540> and<00:03:12.739> by<00:03:13.739> doing<00:03:13.919> this<00:03:14.219> just<00:03:14.609> a

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
the air bubbles and by doing this just a

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.539 
the air bubbles and by doing this just a
little<00:03:14.939> bit<00:03:15.530> it<00:03:16.530> takes<00:03:16.560> up<00:03:16.949> a<00:03:17.069> little<00:03:17.280> bit<00:03:17.430> of<00:03:17.489> a

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
little bit it takes up a little bit of a

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:19.610 
little bit it takes up a little bit of a
sizing<00:03:17.970> on<00:03:18.090> the<00:03:18.180> paper<00:03:18.359> the<00:03:19.019> sizing<00:03:19.409> is<00:03:19.470> the

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
sizing on the paper the sizing is the

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.559 
sizing on the paper the sizing is the
glue<00:03:19.829> that<00:03:19.859> makes<00:03:20.099> it<00:03:20.459> paper<00:03:20.760> and<00:03:21.120> makes<00:03:21.389> it

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:21.569 
glue that makes it paper and makes it

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:24.050 
glue that makes it paper and makes it
hold<00:03:21.959> together<00:03:22.109> if<00:03:22.949> you<00:03:23.099> had<00:03:23.220> no<00:03:23.370> sizing<00:03:23.879> you

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
hold together if you had no sizing you

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.629 
hold together if you had no sizing you
would<00:03:24.180> have<00:03:24.389> I<00:03:24.720> believe<00:03:25.430> some<00:03:26.430> kind<00:03:26.609> of

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:26.639 
would have I believe some kind of

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:28.369 
would have I believe some kind of
Oriental<00:03:27.120> paper<00:03:27.329> that's<00:03:27.599> used<00:03:27.810> with<00:03:28.079> the<00:03:28.199> ink

00:03:28.369 --> 00:03:28.379 
Oriental paper that's used with the ink

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:31.129 
Oriental paper that's used with the ink
where<00:03:28.560> it<00:03:28.620> spreads<00:03:28.949> like<00:03:29.040> crazy<00:03:29.840> but<00:03:30.840> a<00:03:30.900> lot<00:03:31.079> of

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:31.139 
where it spreads like crazy but a lot of

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:32.659 
where it spreads like crazy but a lot of
people<00:03:31.349> think<00:03:31.560> that<00:03:31.650> the<00:03:31.769> sizing<00:03:32.189> on<00:03:32.340> the

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:32.669 
people think that the sizing on the

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:34.429 
people think that the sizing on the
watercolor<00:03:33.659> paper<00:03:33.720> is<00:03:33.989> just<00:03:34.049> a<00:03:34.169> little<00:03:34.349> bit

00:03:34.429 --> 00:03:34.439 
watercolor paper is just a little bit

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:36.379 
watercolor paper is just a little bit
too<00:03:34.620> much<00:03:34.799> so<00:03:35.099> if<00:03:35.220> you<00:03:35.340> if<00:03:35.729> you<00:03:35.879> sponge<00:03:36.150> it<00:03:36.269> down

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:36.389 
too much so if you if you sponge it down

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:37.610 
too much so if you if you sponge it down
you<00:03:36.569> smooth<00:03:36.810> it<00:03:36.900> out<00:03:37.019> and<00:03:37.169> you<00:03:37.229> take<00:03:37.439> off<00:03:37.590> a

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
you smooth it out and you take off a

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:38.719 
you smooth it out and you take off a
little<00:03:37.769> bit<00:03:37.979> of<00:03:38.040> the<00:03:38.099> sizing<00:03:38.489> there's

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:38.729 
little bit of the sizing there's

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:40.309 
little bit of the sizing there's
different<00:03:39.060> theories<00:03:39.239> on<00:03:39.479> that<00:03:39.540> I<00:03:39.870> just<00:03:40.109> wipe

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 
different theories on that I just wipe

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:42.530 
different theories on that I just wipe
it<00:03:40.439> down<00:03:40.620> a<00:03:40.650> little<00:03:40.829> bit<00:03:41.150> now<00:03:42.150> I'm<00:03:42.269> gonna<00:03:42.419> let

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
it down a little bit now I'm gonna let

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:43.670 
it down a little bit now I'm gonna let
it<00:03:42.569> drip<00:03:42.840> just<00:03:43.019> a<00:03:43.079> little<00:03:43.259> bit<00:03:43.379> so<00:03:43.530> it<00:03:43.650> doesn't

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
it drip just a little bit so it doesn't

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:51.170 
it drip just a little bit so it doesn't
make<00:03:44.040> a<00:03:44.069> big<00:03:44.280> puddle<00:03:45.079> and<00:03:47.269> I'm<00:03:48.269> a<00:03:48.359> staple<00:03:48.689> it<00:03:50.180> I

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
make a big puddle and I'm a staple it I

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.420 
make a big puddle and I'm a staple it I
have<00:03:51.870> a<00:03:51.930> stapler<00:03:52.199> that<00:03:52.439> the<00:03:52.889> bottom<00:03:53.189> part<00:03:53.400> is

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
have a stapler that the bottom part is

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:54.979 
have a stapler that the bottom part is
missing<00:03:53.609> which<00:03:54.150> is<00:03:54.180> great<00:03:54.509> cuz<00:03:54.750> I<00:03:54.780> don't<00:03:54.900> have

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
missing which is great cuz I don't have

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:56.210 
missing which is great cuz I don't have
to<00:03:55.049> worry<00:03:55.199> about<00:03:55.290> flipping<00:03:55.709> the<00:03:55.739> bottom<00:03:56.009> part

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
to worry about flipping the bottom part

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:01.099 
to worry about flipping the bottom part
and<00:03:58.609> this<00:03:59.609> is<00:03:59.669> the<00:03:59.729> first<00:04:00.449> time<00:04:00.659> I've<00:04:00.840> used

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:01.109 
and this is the first time I've used

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:07.119 
and this is the first time I've used
this<00:04:01.590> new<00:04:01.829> board

00:04:07.119 --> 00:04:07.129 

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:23.689 

it's<00:04:08.129> not<00:04:08.340> going<00:04:16.370> huh<00:04:22.190> this<00:04:23.190> is<00:04:23.340> exciting

it's not going huh this is exciting

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:25.790 
it's not going huh this is exciting
video<00:04:24.060> footage<00:04:24.389> isn't<00:04:24.539> it<00:04:24.690> I<00:04:24.870> mean<00:04:25.590> this<00:04:25.650> is

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:31.199 
Ross Ross no this is more exciting than

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:32.029 
Ross Ross no this is more exciting than
Bob<00:04:31.440> Ross

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
of the paper to to soak for too long

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.670 
of the paper to to soak for too long
because<00:04:48.510> I<00:04:48.690> like<00:04:48.930> I<00:04:49.020> said<00:04:49.199> before<00:04:49.350> it'll

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
because I like I said before it'll

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.260 
because I like I said before it'll
spread<00:04:49.919> out<00:04:50.070> get<00:04:50.250> to<00:04:50.370> soft<00:04:50.639> and<00:04:50.850> mushy<00:04:50.970> and

spread out get to soft and mushy and
it'll<00:04:51.780> expand<00:04:52.410> too<00:04:52.590> much<00:04:52.770> so<00:04:53.430> even<00:04:53.460> though<00:04:53.760> it

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
it'll expand too much so even though it

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.750 
it'll expand too much so even though it
would<00:04:54.120> be<00:04:54.210> nice<00:04:54.419> to<00:04:54.800> stretch<00:04:55.800> ten<00:04:56.190> boards<00:04:56.460> at

duty<00:06:03.120> staple<00:06:03.510> gun<00:06:03.690> and<00:06:04.020> you<00:06:04.560> have<00:06:04.740> it<00:06:04.949> on<00:06:05.130> its

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:05.400 
duty staple gun and you have it on its

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.550 
duty staple gun and you have it on its
full<00:06:05.669> capacity<00:06:05.849> what<00:06:06.570> it'll<00:06:06.720> often<00:06:06.930> happen<00:06:07.440> is

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:07.560 
full capacity what it'll often happen is

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.010 
full capacity what it'll often happen is
this<00:06:07.889> paper<00:06:08.159> is<00:06:08.340> already<00:06:08.729> soft<00:06:09.210> it's<00:06:09.630> already

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:10.020 
this paper is already soft it's already

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.740 
this paper is already soft it's already
wet<00:06:10.320> and<00:06:10.530> and<00:06:10.919> pliable<00:06:11.280> and<00:06:11.699> you<00:06:12.030> go<00:06:12.150> goosh<00:06:12.449> and

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:12.750 
wet and and pliable and you go goosh and

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:14.600 
wet and and pliable and you go goosh and
you<00:06:13.169> just<00:06:13.380> tear<00:06:13.620> right<00:06:13.770> through<00:06:13.949> the<00:06:14.010> paper<00:06:14.190> so

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:14.610 
you just tear right through the paper so

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:16.320 
you just tear right through the paper so
that's<00:06:14.789> why<00:06:14.909> I<00:06:14.940> was<00:06:15.180> trying<00:06:15.330> to<00:06:15.570> use<00:06:15.750> the

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:16.330 
that's why I was trying to use the

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.860 
that's why I was trying to use the
the<00:06:16.690> more<00:06:16.930> of<00:06:17.020> the<00:06:17.169> desktop<00:06:17.560> home<00:06:18.099> stapler<00:06:18.870> but

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:19.870 
the more of the desktop home stapler but

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:21.719 
the more of the desktop home stapler but
it<00:06:20.020> wasn't<00:06:20.319> using<00:06:20.889> enough<00:06:21.069> force<00:06:21.340> in<00:06:21.520> some

00:06:21.719 --> 00:06:21.729 
it wasn't using enough force in some

00:06:21.729 --> 00:06:23.969 
it wasn't using enough force in some
cases<00:06:21.940> so<00:06:22.270> then<00:06:22.419> I<00:06:22.449> went<00:06:22.659> to<00:06:22.720> use<00:06:22.930> this<00:06:23.169> staple

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:23.979 
cases so then I went to use this staple

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:25.379 
cases so then I went to use this staple
gun<00:06:24.099> anyway

00:06:25.379 --> 00:06:25.389 
gun anyway

00:06:25.389 --> 00:06:27.779 
gun anyway
I<00:06:25.949> think<00:06:26.949> I've<00:06:27.069> showed<00:06:27.250> you<00:06:27.370> everything<00:06:27.639> I

00:06:27.779 --> 00:06:27.789 
I think I've showed you everything I

00:06:27.789 --> 00:06:30.450 
I think I've showed you everything I
could<00:06:27.940> possibly<00:06:27.970> show<00:06:28.360> you<00:06:28.569> about<00:06:29.430> how<00:06:30.430> I

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:30.460 
could possibly show you about how I

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:33.689 
could possibly show you about how I
stretch<00:06:30.849> my<00:06:30.879> paper<00:06:31.270> again<00:06:32.259> this<00:06:32.409> is<00:06:32.590> that<00:06:32.800> hot

00:06:33.689 --> 00:06:33.699 
stretch my paper again this is that hot

00:06:33.699 --> 00:06:35.339 
stretch my paper again this is that hot
pressed<00:06:34.030> paper<00:06:34.090> that<00:06:34.509> comes<00:06:34.690> off<00:06:34.870> of<00:06:34.900> a<00:06:35.110> role

00:06:35.339 --> 00:06:35.349 
pressed paper that comes off of a role

00:06:35.349 --> 00:06:38.249 
pressed paper that comes off of a role
than<00:06:35.680> an<00:06:36.099> extra-wide<00:06:36.460> role<00:06:37.030> I<00:06:37.330> think<00:06:37.840> this<00:06:38.110> is

00:06:38.249 --> 00:06:38.259 
than an extra-wide role I think this is

00:06:38.259 --> 00:06:41.279 
than an extra-wide role I think this is
51<00:06:38.830> or<00:06:39.009> 52<00:06:39.099> inches<00:06:39.759> it's<00:06:40.599> kind<00:06:40.810> of<00:06:40.870> expensive

00:06:41.279 --> 00:06:41.289 
51 or 52 inches it's kind of expensive

00:06:41.289 --> 00:06:42.659 
51 or 52 inches it's kind of expensive
now<00:06:41.440> it's<00:06:41.680> gone<00:06:41.800> up<00:06:42.039> quite<00:06:42.220> a<00:06:42.250> bit<00:06:42.460> in<00:06:42.490> the<00:06:42.610> last

00:06:42.659 --> 00:06:42.669 
now it's gone up quite a bit in the last

00:06:42.669 --> 00:06:44.430 
now it's gone up quite a bit in the last
10<00:06:43.060> years<00:06:43.330> I<00:06:43.449> think<00:06:43.479> it's<00:06:43.750> about<00:06:43.990> two<00:06:44.199> hundred

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:44.440 
10 years I think it's about two hundred

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:45.420 
10 years I think it's about two hundred
and<00:06:44.500> twenty<00:06:44.740> dollars<00:06:44.860> for<00:06:45.039> one<00:06:45.280> of<00:06:45.370> these

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:45.430 
and twenty dollars for one of these

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:48.659 
and twenty dollars for one of these
rolls<00:06:45.699> but<00:06:46.680> it'll<00:06:47.680> last<00:06:47.830> you<00:06:48.069> for<00:06:48.250> a<00:06:48.280> very<00:06:48.490> long

00:06:48.659 --> 00:06:48.669 
rolls but it'll last you for a very long

00:06:48.669 --> 00:06:50.879 
rolls but it'll last you for a very long
time<00:06:48.699> and<00:06:49.419> you<00:06:49.659> can<00:06:49.810> make<00:06:49.840> the<00:06:50.080> sizes<00:06:50.440> exactly

00:06:50.879 --> 00:06:50.889 
time and you can make the sizes exactly

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:51.990 
time and you can make the sizes exactly
what<00:06:51.009> you<00:06:51.099> want<00:06:51.250> them<00:06:51.400> to<00:06:51.520> be<00:06:51.610> so<00:06:51.789> there<00:06:51.909> are

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:52.000 
what you want them to be so there are

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.430 
what you want them to be so there are
some<00:06:52.120> real<00:06:52.300> advantages<00:06:52.719> to<00:06:52.900> it<00:06:53.050> if<00:06:53.199> you're

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:53.440 
some real advantages to it if you're

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:54.959 
some real advantages to it if you're
interested<00:06:53.830> in<00:06:53.949> doing<00:06:54.190> it<00:06:54.310> the<00:06:54.490> Steve<00:06:54.699> codes

00:06:54.959 --> 00:06:54.969 
interested in doing it the Steve codes

00:06:54.969 --> 00:06:57.089 
interested in doing it the Steve codes
are<00:06:55.120> way<00:06:55.300> if<00:06:55.990> you're<00:06:56.199> not<00:06:56.349> that's<00:06:56.560> fine<00:06:56.710> use

00:06:57.089 --> 00:06:57.099 
are way if you're not that's fine use

00:06:57.099 --> 00:06:58.260 
are way if you're not that's fine use
some<00:06:57.250> other<00:06:57.400> paper<00:06:57.639> but<00:06:57.879> you<00:06:57.969> can<00:06:58.090> still

00:06:58.260 --> 00:06:58.270 
some other paper but you can still

00:06:58.270 --> 00:06:59.939 
some other paper but you can still
stretch<00:06:58.569> it<00:06:58.780> and<00:06:59.229> you<00:06:59.349> can<00:06:59.500> make<00:06:59.650> it<00:06:59.740> a<00:06:59.770> lot

00:06:59.939 --> 00:06:59.949 
stretch it and you can make it a lot

00:06:59.949 --> 00:07:01.860 
stretch it and you can make it a lot
more<00:07:00.129> usable<00:07:00.340> after<00:07:01.240> you<00:07:01.360> stretch<00:07:01.629> it<00:07:01.780> this

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:01.870 
more usable after you stretch it this

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:03.480 
more usable after you stretch it this
way<00:07:02.080> the<00:07:02.800> next<00:07:02.979> thing<00:07:03.069> I'm<00:07:03.129> going<00:07:03.219> to<00:07:03.280> do<00:07:03.370> is
