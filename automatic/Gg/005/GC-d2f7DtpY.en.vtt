00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:05.730
 today in how it's done we're going to prepare 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:08.580
 a rich Neapolitan pizzas the 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:11.219
 Authentic Neapolitan pizzas in first 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.670
 place we are going to prepare a rich sauce 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:17.030
 tomato for pizza 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:20.150
 then we will use tomato 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:21.920
 in spain we call it wait but in 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.420
 italy I think he calls it something like 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.170
 sean marshall 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:31.490
 we will also use half onion salt 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:33.850
 sugar laure some garlic thyme oregano 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:37.280
 Then the first thing we are going to do 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.809
 we explain half onion and the other 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.600
 fourth then we're going to move it to the 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:43.940
 titling we're also going to chop the 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:47.160
 tomato 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.720
 and we also pass it to the crusher 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.480
 what I have done in the first place is 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:54.350
 remove the heart and peel the tomato to 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.350
 leave it without mercy 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.830
 we have also agreed on the garlic and 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.830
 let's apply it all together 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:09.909
 So here we have a quarter of 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:12.340
 onion a few cloves of garlic and tomato 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:14.850
 in a pan we put to heat the 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.850
 oil to 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.800
 when it's a little hot we put 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.930
 a quarter of onion and we 'll have it 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.310
 about 5 or 7 minutes the onion becoming 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:30.390
 we add the tomato 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:33.020
 he removes it we see everything well we put a 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.810
 rapid fire so that it goes catching 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:40.229
 we put our bay leaves a 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.300
 little of oregano the pepper and the 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.580
 thyme 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:47.290
 so that it has a very nice flavor 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.290
 after our pizza 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.680
 what we see a little bit so that the 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.480
 flavors are intermingled 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.290
 and this process will more or less take 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.290
 about 20 minutes 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.659
 After a while we can add a little 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:09.970
 salt to taste and when two are missing 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:12.150
 minutes then a little bit of sugar for 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.650
 remove acidity 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.470
 and when we see that he has lost 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.840
 enough volume of water can 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.860
 consider that our tomato sauce 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.860
 is ready 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.550
 the process that we have discussed will last 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:29.459
 about 20 minutes we're going to prepare a couple 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:34.630
 of masses for the pizzas we will make a 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:36.790
 pizza margarita and a seafood pizza 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.310
 So the first thing we're going to do is 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:42.250
 extend our mass for how it is done 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:45.160
 the Neapolitan mass, I'll leave you the 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:47.530
 link since I have this video done 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:50.560
 previously then to not do it 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.690
 very long I divide it in two where one 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.810
 we make the pizza and the other we learn to 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:58.200
 make the Neapolitan mass 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:00.840
 commented that once you go to Naples and 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.870
 you approach the Atlantic pizza 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.569
 admission pizzeria there you can see the 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.280
 best pizza in the world the problem is that 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:11.760
 you have to queue as you feel there 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:14.370
 a lot of people to be able to move to 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.830
 buy the pizzas 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.080
 it's worth once we have the dough well 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:21.620
 stretched let's incorporate the tomato 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:24.200
 what we have done a little while ago 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:27.319
 and we extend it always leaving a 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:30.370
 small margin by the sides like this is 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:33.750
 as they do in naples 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:37.239
 we add a bit of cheese I will demonstrate the 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.790
 drawn in this way since this is the 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:43.849
 typical 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.849
 in pizza recipe margarita 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.170
 I explain how it is done and I do not 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.390
 you ask because it is a tradition that 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.660
 it is done we also put some leaves of 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.660
 basil 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:00.980
 and a little bit of oil and it's already there in 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:03.230
 Naples the pizzas are usually quite 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:06.920
 simple but really they are very 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:09.100
 rich we put a little oil of 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.020
 extra virgin 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.510
 and we pass it to the oven that we have 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:15.610
 turned on at 250 degrees we'll leave it 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.620
 on the basis of the oven with a paper of 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:19.360
 bake while it's going on we're going to 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.180
 prepare the second pizza that is the 

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:23.889
 I told you that I was the sailor 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.789
 once we have extended it then 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:29.710
 let's put the tomato and we share it 

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:33.370
 by the center too and now the 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:36.490
 Mozzarella goes to much fatter tacos 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:40.090
 than the previous ones and this takes a little 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:41.949
 of garlic that we have cut to sheets and 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:44.770
 he also carries oregano that is the 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:48.669
 difference from this pizza to the 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:51.300
 daisy we have some fresh leaves of 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:51.300
 basil 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.800
 and of course the oregano as os 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:00.840
 I was commenting 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:04.629
 let's be a little and the virgin oil 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:09.039
 extra if you do not have bis that gives you a 

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:11.139
 good olive oil as it is already 

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:14.919
 right we have the first pizza 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:18.720
 look what it looks is delicious 

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:18.720
 I assure you because the food 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.910
 and these are the real pizzas 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:26.550
 napolitanas here was born in Naples 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:29.210
 pizza and these were the pizzas that 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:33.240
 they made the first pizzas that 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:34.500
 they started to go around the world and 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.150
 here we already have the two tracks 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.330
 prepared 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:41.400
 I have prepared a salad with 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:44.190
 tomato and a little onion and for 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:46.740
 Of course, we are not going to liven it up with 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:48.570
 a little craft beer is 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:50.910
 Beer was given to me by a friend called 

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:55.140
 norberto and it's a beer the richest 

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:57.510
 of the world world is very rich order 

00:05:55.140 --> 00:06:01.130
 with the ingredients of the pizzas and 

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:01.130
 I hope you do them jce and enjoy
