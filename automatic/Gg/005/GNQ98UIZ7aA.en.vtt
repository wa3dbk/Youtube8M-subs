00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:17.010
 skiing or youtube gangs like 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.860
 are reporting if once again the 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.950
 they denounce welcome a new gameplay 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:24.029
 started by me because lower good 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:25.619
 what they will be looking at in the background is a 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.230
 here in gang playing on this map 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.790
 that is called this is also that I think 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.529
 that most of us know as the 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:33.630
 click on the map of the castle where they are placed 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.670
 to change all with sniper the with 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.110
 silencer and where it is impossible to search 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.300
 to an enemy I think it's easier 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.790
 find a needle in a haystack that a 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.079
 enemy in this fucking map the truth is this 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.300
 heading that they are going to be watching is 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.719
 edited by the reason that took me 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.550
 almost 10 or if not more time in 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.680
 try to get one that is not that outside 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.440
 why because they see me play with the 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.289
 here 12 with which I have taken several 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.129
 clips I just do not feel like playing 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.000
 gusting usually low 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:05.640
 so yes, I'm going to play 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.920
 in this in this game with specialist 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.810
 already when I saw that it was on a grid like 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.190
 of good rather when I said take out the 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.350
 dificultamos specialist to see what 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.360
 It can be done but as I tell you 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.530
 It cost a lot of work because of the fact that 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.520
 they are all hidden 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:24.369
 do not move with sniper I think that remove 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.049
 the part where he kills me like three times or 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:28.030
 I do not remember how many times I died in 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:29.560
 this example but they killed me like two 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.630
 times the same wake extending into the 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.159
 same place with disney but I said then 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.409
 program is not going to move because it knows 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:37.570
 I'm going to go kill him but he was not 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:39.670
 so I like asshole because he turned me to 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.710
 kill for gang good for you 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.810
 which are the cutest maps of all 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.299
 of let's say of all times in call 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:49.000
 of duty not in modern warfare 3 there were two 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:51.670
 maps which for me were the most 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.590
 ugly ones were not called down tools and they were not 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.659
 bad memory was a map as set 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.729
 in a city I do not remember did the 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:00.560
 angels new york or do not know what kind of 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:02.420
 city â€‹â€‹was but it was a map full of 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.369
 buildings where the gusts of casualties do not 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.140
 They served you for nothing, much less a 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:09.080
 repair because I remember making a 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.640
 video where I titled him repair in the 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.280
 national sky remembrance was a 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.019
 comment 2.0 in which then the reaper 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.690
 it rose more than the bill on this map 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:19.879
 because I do not know on that map I always played 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:23.599
 just like a specialist and another map 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:25.610
 it was car map set snow not 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:27.349
 I remember when it was set but 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:31.329
 everyone was changing in that 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:33.680
 map in black ops 1 nothing else there was a 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:36.230
 blank code I just had a 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.329
 map which I did not like much 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.239
 called after man like a super map 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:42.680
 ugly without anything fun for the 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:44.390
 pig is that the maps have to 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.579
 have something fun but they have to 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.400
 have common that a little bit of better 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:50.750
 design not the best maps for me 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.769
 it has always been is any love 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.299
 wolffer 2 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:55.220
 but that of after mangroves alive 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:56.580
 proposed to be the ugliest and here in the 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.790
 color goes 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:02.490
 the maps are not so good that 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:05.580
 let's say how they should have been 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:08.040
 I do not know if this map on playstation 4 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.990
 james box for those who play war 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.210
 terrestrial is a little more fun 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.710
 as with more movement than me 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:15.750
 I imagine yes because of the fact that they are 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:18.630
 more players do not gang but if they play 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.760
 domination 6 against 6 are going to do 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.260
 this game is going to be eternal 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.060
 I tell them this game I had to edit 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.500
 by the fact that it took me longer 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.480
 time to find people that in 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.160
 try to get it out that it's good to get 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.680
 a pretty short game I hope you 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.180
 have enjoyed cravings and then they 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.440
 although they can leave one in the part of 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.959
 below follow better 'facebook' and 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.030
 'twitter' and how many we left for 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:42.120
 lackey to see this wey visa for 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.860
 half killed him mountain wedding surcharge 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.050

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.820

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.530

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:51.360
 are missing for a recharge recharge 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.400
 miss one you see your partner where 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.260

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.600
