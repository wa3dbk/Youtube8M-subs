of people have been speculating and

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.840 
of people have been speculating and
saying<00:00:33.630> that<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:34.710> Sharks<00:00:35.190> are<00:00:35.340> probably

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
saying that the Sharks are probably

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.100 
saying that the Sharks are probably
going<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.090> be<00:00:36.149> one<00:00:36.360> of<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.480> next<00:00:36.809> thing<00:00:36.960> to

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
going to be one of the next thing to

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.910 
going to be one of the next thing to
come<00:00:37.350> or<00:00:37.590> whales<00:00:38.160> or<00:00:38.670> fish<00:00:39.600> in<00:00:39.930> general<00:00:39.989> which

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
come or whales or fish in general which

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.010 
come or whales or fish in general which
you<00:00:41.129> can<00:00:41.309> see<00:00:41.610> an<00:00:41.879> attack<00:00:42.270> and<00:00:42.570> will<00:00:42.690> attack

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
you can see an attack and will attack

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.130 
you can see an attack and will attack
you<00:00:43.230> sort<00:00:43.500> of<00:00:43.590> thing<00:00:43.739> so<00:00:44.930> personally<00:00:45.930> I<00:00:45.960> think

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
you sort of thing so personally I think

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.930 
you sort of thing so personally I think
this<00:00:46.469> would<00:00:46.649> be<00:00:46.770> awesome<00:00:47.010> to<00:00:47.340> have<00:00:47.460> sharks<00:00:47.820> and

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
this would be awesome to have sharks and

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.150 
this would be awesome to have sharks and
stuff<00:00:48.090> in<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.300> game<00:00:48.480> however<00:00:49.079> I<00:00:49.200> do<00:00:49.320> feel<00:00:50.100> that

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
stuff in the game however I do feel that

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.450 
stuff in the game however I do feel that
on<00:00:51.090> a<00:00:51.660> peaceful<00:00:52.260> or<00:00:52.469> easy<00:00:52.739> mode<00:00:53.129> they

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
on a peaceful or easy mode they

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.450 
on a peaceful or easy mode they
shouldn't<00:00:53.879> react<00:00:54.329> they<00:00:54.570> should<00:00:54.750> just<00:00:54.899> be<00:00:55.460> just

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
shouldn't react they should just be just

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.729 
shouldn't react they should just be just
like<00:00:56.820> just<00:00:57.239> normal<00:00:57.449> they<00:00:58.050> won't<00:00:58.260> attack<00:00:58.379> you

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
like just normal they won't attack you

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.010 
like just normal they won't attack you
and<00:00:59.010> for<00:00:59.250> that<00:00:59.430> kiss<00:00:59.730> it<00:01:00.300> might<00:01:00.629> get<00:01:00.899> a<00:01:00.960> little

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
and for that kiss it might get a little

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.660 
and for that kiss it might get a little
bit<00:01:01.289> tricky<00:01:01.590> when<00:01:01.949> you're<00:01:02.129> just<00:01:02.399> trying<00:01:02.640> to

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
bit tricky when you're just trying to

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:03.979 
bit tricky when you're just trying to
swim<00:01:02.850> but<00:01:02.969> then<00:01:03.090> again<00:01:03.210> it<00:01:03.449> will<00:01:03.510> make<00:01:03.660> it<00:01:03.840> more

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
swim but then again it will make it more

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.929 
swim but then again it will make it more
interesting<00:01:04.379> having<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:05.100> make<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.280> boat<00:01:05.640> and

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
interesting having to make a boat and

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.890 
interesting having to make a boat and
kind<00:01:06.600> of<00:01:06.720> maybe<00:01:07.380> take<00:01:08.010> a<00:01:08.150> slightly<00:01:09.150> smarter

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
kind of maybe take a slightly smarter

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.950 
kind of maybe take a slightly smarter
route<00:01:10.380> around<00:01:10.860> somewhere<00:01:11.549> so<00:01:11.850> you<00:01:12.420> don't<00:01:12.630> get

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
route around somewhere so you don't get

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.469 
route around somewhere so you don't get
the<00:01:13.140> sharks<00:01:13.560> or<00:01:13.770> maybe<00:01:14.280> even<00:01:14.549> a<00:01:14.640> new<00:01:14.670> biome

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
the sharks or maybe even a new biome

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.440 
the sharks or maybe even a new biome
part<00:01:15.869> of<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.140> deep<00:01:16.350> ocean<00:01:16.560> where<00:01:17.460> there's

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
part of the deep ocean where there's

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.420 
part of the deep ocean where there's
like<00:01:18.659> big<00:01:19.020> pointy<00:01:19.500> rocks<00:01:19.740> in<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.070> middle<00:01:20.310> of

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
like big pointy rocks in the middle of

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.060 
like big pointy rocks in the middle of
nowhere<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.750> sharks<00:01:22.200> that's<00:01:22.650> where<00:01:22.890> they

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
nowhere and the sharks that's where they

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.270 
nowhere and the sharks that's where they
are

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
are

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.730 
are
it's<00:01:23.549> like<00:01:23.670> shark<00:01:24.299> territory<00:01:24.630> so<00:01:25.439> I<00:01:25.470> think

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
it's like shark territory so I think

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.410 
it's like shark territory so I think
this<00:01:25.920> would<00:01:26.040> be<00:01:26.159> awesome<00:01:26.369> then<00:01:27.030> you'll<00:01:27.330> be

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
this would be awesome then you'll be

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.569 
this would be awesome then you'll be
able<00:01:27.540> to<00:01:27.659> get<00:01:27.810> like<00:01:28.049> fins<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:28.950> stuff<00:01:29.250> as<00:01:29.400> new

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
able to get like fins and stuff as new

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.330 
able to get like fins and stuff as new
items<00:01:30.060> new<00:01:30.390> builds<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.530> then<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.799> litchi

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
items new builds and then the litchi

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.770 
items new builds and then the litchi
there's<00:01:32.670> something<00:01:33.000> do<00:01:33.150> a<00:01:33.180> bit<00:01:33.390> new

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
there's something do a bit new

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.469 
there's something do a bit new
enchantments<00:01:34.439> new<00:01:34.619> potions<00:01:35.130> or<00:01:35.790> which<00:01:36.060> we<00:01:36.210> get

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
enchantments new potions or which we get

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.670

out<00:01:36.600> of<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.960> shark<00:01:37.850> like<00:01:38.850> we<00:01:39.180> are<00:01:39.329> bow<00:01:39.509> if<00:01:40.470> we

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
out of the shark like we are bow if we

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.590 
out of the shark like we are bow if we
did<00:01:40.860> we<00:01:41.009> forget<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.460> fins<00:01:41.729> and<00:01:42.030> then<00:01:42.270> have

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
did we forget the fins and then have

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.980 
did we forget the fins and then have
potions<00:01:43.140> of<00:01:43.320> like<00:01:43.729> rapid<00:01:44.729> bike<00:01:45.149> swimming<00:01:45.720> and

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
potions of like rapid bike swimming and

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.690 
potions of like rapid bike swimming and
stuff<00:01:46.560> like<00:01:46.680> that<00:01:46.829> at<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.100> honesty<00:01:47.520> I<00:01:47.549> think

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
stuff like that at the honesty I think

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.730 
stuff like that at the honesty I think
it'd<00:01:47.939> be<00:01:48.060> such<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:48.450> cool<00:01:48.720> thing<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:49.229> have<00:01:49.259> sharks

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
it'd be such a cool thing to have sharks

or at least some sort of fish or
something<00:01:52.710> in<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.070> oceans<00:01:53.430> to<00:01:53.610> make<00:01:53.729> it<00:01:53.880> more

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
something in the oceans to make it more

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.590 
something in the oceans to make it more
interesting

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
interesting

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.469 
interesting
I<00:01:54.720> mean<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:55.530> personally<00:01:56.340> I<00:01:56.399> do<00:01:56.549> feel<00:01:57.060> that<00:01:57.329> it

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
I mean and personally I do feel that it

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.270 
I mean and personally I do feel that it
does<00:01:57.689> make<00:01:57.869> sense<00:01:58.140> why<00:01:58.950> else<00:01:59.280> would<00:01:59.579> we<00:01:59.610> need

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
does make sense why else would we need

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.490 
does make sense why else would we need
deep-ocean<00:02:00.640> if<00:02:01.210> there's<00:02:01.480> not<00:02:01.720> gonna<00:02:02.380> be

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
deep-ocean if there's not gonna be

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.830 
deep-ocean if there's not gonna be
anything<00:02:02.830> in<00:02:03.070> it<00:02:03.220> this<00:02:04.120> is<00:02:04.300> one<00:02:04.690> of<00:02:04.780> the

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
anything in it this is one of the

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.470 
anything in it this is one of the
reasons<00:02:05.140> why<00:02:05.260> I<00:02:05.290> to<00:02:05.530> believes<00:02:06.400> that<00:02:06.880> we<00:02:07.270> could

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:07.480 
reasons why I to believes that we could

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.389 
reasons why I to believes that we could
end<00:02:07.630> up<00:02:07.780> seeing<00:02:07.840> something<00:02:08.590> like<00:02:08.860> sharks<00:02:09.130> in

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
end up seeing something like sharks in

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:12.300 
end up seeing something like sharks in
Minecraft<00:02:09.789> 1.8<00:02:10.300> which<00:02:11.200> personally<00:02:11.590> I<00:02:11.680> really

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
Minecraft 1.8 which personally I really

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.520 
Minecraft 1.8 which personally I really
really<00:02:12.820> hope<00:02:13.000> we<00:02:13.180> do<00:02:13.360> because<00:02:14.080> it's<00:02:14.350> something

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
really hope we do because it's something

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.320 
really hope we do because it's something
that<00:02:14.650> ever<00:02:15.010> since<00:02:15.310> the<00:02:15.430> first<00:02:15.580> I<00:02:15.790> plane<00:02:16.090> in

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
that ever since the first I plane in

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.170 
that ever since the first I plane in
like<00:02:16.540> inlay<00:02:17.140> alpha<00:02:17.590> I<00:02:17.740> wanted<00:02:18.310> to<00:02:18.670> have<00:02:18.850> a

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
like inlay alpha I wanted to have a

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.570 
like inlay alpha I wanted to have a
shark<00:02:19.959> or<00:02:20.200> something<00:02:20.709> like<00:02:20.800> that<00:02:20.860> I<00:02:21.220> just

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
shark or something like that I just

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.130 
shark or something like that I just
thought<00:02:21.910> it'd<00:02:22.060> be<00:02:22.090> awesome<00:02:22.570> and<00:02:22.990> obviously

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
thought it'd be awesome and obviously

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.810 
thought it'd be awesome and obviously
there<00:02:23.500> are<00:02:23.590> mods<00:02:23.800> and<00:02:24.040> stuff<00:02:24.280> which<00:02:24.459> you<00:02:24.490> can

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
there are mods and stuff which you can

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.120 
there are mods and stuff which you can
have<00:02:25.030> this<00:02:25.240> but<00:02:25.959> personally<00:02:26.650> I'll<00:02:26.800> just<00:02:26.950> play

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
vanilla 19 percent of the time so I'd

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:33.930 
vanilla 19 percent of the time so I'd
love<00:02:32.380> to<00:02:32.440> see<00:02:32.590> this<00:02:32.770> in<00:02:32.920> vanilla<00:02:33.100> minecraft<00:02:33.310> it

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
love to see this in vanilla minecraft it

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.110 
love to see this in vanilla minecraft it
would<00:02:34.030> make<00:02:34.300> it<00:02:34.450> so<00:02:34.480> much<00:02:34.720> more<00:02:34.840> fun<00:02:35.020> or<00:02:36.120> anyway

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
would make it so much more fun or anyway

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.710 
would make it so much more fun or anyway
something<00:02:37.690> similar<00:02:38.530> and<00:02:38.709> kind<00:02:39.010> of<00:02:39.130> I<00:02:39.720> don't

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
something similar and kind of I don't

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.750 
something similar and kind of I don't
know<00:02:40.810> just<00:02:41.110> like<00:02:41.650> even<00:02:41.980> if<00:02:42.070> it<00:02:42.190> looked<00:02:42.610> like

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
know just like even if it looked like

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.040 
know just like even if it looked like
this<00:02:42.940> if<00:02:43.120> it<00:02:43.239> didn't<00:02:43.480> look<00:02:43.540> like<00:02:43.600> this<00:02:43.810> just

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
this if it didn't look like this just

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.380 
this if it didn't look like this just
generally<00:02:44.709> to<00:02:44.920> have<00:02:45.040> a<00:02:45.100> shark<00:02:45.489> it<00:02:46.120> would<00:02:46.150> be

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
generally to have a shark it would be

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.420 
generally to have a shark it would be
awesome<00:02:46.750> the<00:02:46.900> only<00:02:47.050> thing<00:02:47.350> is<00:02:47.500> it<00:02:48.010> would<00:02:48.280> have

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
awesome the only thing is it would have

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.180 
awesome the only thing is it would have
to<00:02:48.580> be<00:02:48.700> in<00:02:48.970> deep<00:02:49.209> ocean<00:02:49.390> because<00:02:49.900> obviously

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
to be in deep ocean because obviously

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.010 
to be in deep ocean because obviously
it's<00:02:51.190> not<00:02:51.310> gonna<00:02:51.459> be<00:02:51.610> small<00:02:52.030> and<00:02:52.209> squid<00:02:52.810> get

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020 
it's not gonna be small and squid get

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.990 
it's not gonna be small and squid get
stuck<00:02:53.320> in<00:02:53.500> normal<00:02:53.890> ocean<00:02:54.040> half<00:02:54.370> the<00:02:54.550> time<00:02:54.730> so

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
stuck in normal ocean half the time so

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.550 
stuck in normal ocean half the time so
this<00:02:55.930> is<00:02:56.110> another<00:02:56.530> reason<00:02:56.770> why<00:02:56.980> I<00:02:57.130> think

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
this is another reason why I think

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.380 
this is another reason why I think
minecraft<00:02:59.560> 1.8<00:02:59.980> is<00:03:00.190> gonna<00:03:00.520> be<00:03:00.670> a<00:03:00.700> see<00:03:01.000> related

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
minecraft 1.8 is gonna be a see related

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.330 
minecraft 1.8 is gonna be a see related
update<00:03:02.110> we<00:03:02.560> still<00:03:02.830> haven't<00:03:03.010> had<00:03:03.100> a<00:03:03.160> single

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
snapshot so it can't move so we don't

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.570
