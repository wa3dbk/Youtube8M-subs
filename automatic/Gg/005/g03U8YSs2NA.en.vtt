dirty yeah I'm not a filter expert but
is<00:00:52.559> this<00:00:52.680> person<00:00:53.039> like<00:00:53.190> a<00:00:53.219> smoker<00:00:53.640> or

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.469 
quite a few filters we're just talking
about<00:01:35.340> two<00:01:35.670> abroad<00:01:35.939> at<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.060> moment<00:01:36.150> but

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
about two abroad at the moment but

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.539 
about two abroad at the moment but
you've<00:01:36.630> got<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:36.840> lot<00:01:37.049> of<00:01:37.079> filters<00:01:37.560> but<00:01:37.799> when<00:01:38.430> the

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
you've got a lot of filters but when the

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.999 
you've got a lot of filters but when the
filters<00:01:38.850> get<00:01:39.000> dirty<00:01:39.270> like<00:01:39.479> this<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:40.470> engine

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
filters get dirty like this the engine

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.130 
filters get dirty like this the engine
can't<00:01:41.250> breathe<00:01:41.520> it<00:01:42.240> will<00:01:42.390> cause<00:01:42.600> it<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:42.869> use

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
can't breathe it will cause it to use

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.170 
can't breathe it will cause it to use
more<00:01:43.439> fuel<00:01:43.710> there's<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.520> big<00:01:44.670> concern<00:01:44.850> of<00:01:45.090> these

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
more fuel there's a big concern of these

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.060 
more fuel there's a big concern of these
days<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:46.049> it<00:01:46.259> can<00:01:46.409> have<00:01:46.710> some<00:01:46.860> long-term

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
days and it can have some long-term

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.670 
days and it can have some long-term
effects<00:01:47.729> like<00:01:48.000> drivability<00:01:48.990> of<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.320> engine

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
effects like drivability of the engine

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.380

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
want to bury it yeah that's right what

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.360 
want to bury it yeah that's right what
about<00:02:40.380> if<00:02:41.160> people<00:02:41.489> do<00:02:42.150> have<00:02:42.180> dogs<00:02:43.050> and<00:02:43.500> animals

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
about if people do have dogs and animals

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:45.710 
about if people do have dogs and animals
that<00:02:44.459> they<00:02:44.670> tote<00:02:44.940> around<00:02:45.060> in<00:02:45.330> their<00:02:45.450> cars<00:02:45.630> a

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
that they tote around in their cars a

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.539 
that they tote around in their cars a
lot<00:02:45.930> does<00:02:46.140> that<00:02:46.319> will<00:02:46.650> that<00:02:46.799> speed<00:02:47.160> up<00:02:47.340> the

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
lot does that will that speed up the

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:49.720 
lot does that will that speed up the
process<00:02:48.060> of<00:02:48.209> how<00:02:48.660> soon<00:02:48.989> you<00:02:49.140> need<00:02:49.170> to<00:02:49.410> review

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
process of how soon you need to review

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.890 
process of how soon you need to review
when<00:02:50.730> you<00:02:50.819> Erika<00:02:51.150> serves<00:02:51.390> on<00:02:51.540> this<00:02:51.720> on<00:02:51.870> a
