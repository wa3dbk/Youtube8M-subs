I say coals because if you put it over
the<00:00:48.780> flames<00:00:49.020> this<00:00:49.500> will<00:00:49.800> actually<00:00:50.039> cause<00:00:50.550> it

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
the flames this will actually cause it

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.660 
the flames this will actually cause it
to<00:00:50.879> slide<00:00:51.180> off<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.690> lot<00:00:51.989> faster<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:52.800> then<00:00:53.579> you

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
to slide off a lot faster and then you

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.340 
to slide off a lot faster and then you
just<00:00:53.850> hold<00:00:53.940> it<00:00:54.090> over<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.360> coals<00:00:54.629> until<00:00:55.230> you

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
just hold it over the coals until you

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.260 
just hold it over the coals until you
start<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:55.770> see<00:00:55.800> a<00:00:56.190> little<00:00:56.489> bit<00:00:56.699> of<00:00:56.760> bubbling

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
start to see a little bit of bubbling

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.349 
start to see a little bit of bubbling
like<00:00:57.719> that<00:00:58.050> I<00:00:58.350> always<00:00:59.039> turn<00:00:59.309> mine<00:00:59.579> as<00:00:59.820> to<00:01:00.120> try

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
like that I always turn mine as to try

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.990 
like that I always turn mine as to try
to<00:01:00.420> get<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.870> drips<00:01:01.079> not<00:01:01.350> all<00:01:01.649> drip<00:01:02.070> off<00:01:02.309> but

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
to get the drips not all drip off but

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.870 
to get the drips not all drip off but
this<00:01:03.239> is<00:01:03.539> not<00:01:04.199> 100%<00:01:04.739> preventable<00:01:05.129> so<00:01:05.670> don't

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
this is not 100% preventable so don't

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.200 
this is not 100% preventable so don't
worry<00:01:06.240> too<00:01:06.750> much<00:01:06.780> about<00:01:06.930> it<00:01:07.850> then<00:01:08.850> you<00:01:08.970> just

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
worry too much about it then you just

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.450 
worry too much about it then you just
let<00:01:09.689> it<00:01:09.780> caramelize<00:01:09.990> for<00:01:10.470> a<00:01:10.500> bit<00:01:10.619> until<00:01:10.860> it's

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
let it caramelize for a bit until it's

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.000 
let it caramelize for a bit until it's
about<00:01:11.720> as<00:01:12.720> caramelized<00:01:13.200> if<00:01:13.439> you'd<00:01:13.590> like<00:01:13.710> it<00:01:13.890> to

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010
