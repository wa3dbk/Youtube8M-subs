00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
down a little bit of crystallization

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.069 
down a little bit of crystallization
sure<00:00:56.250> that's<00:00:56.789> what's<00:00:57.000> gonna<00:00:57.120> happen

it's<00:01:02.079> like<00:01:02.199> an<00:01:02.320> icy<00:01:02.559> carwash<00:01:05.340> okay<00:01:06.340> we've<00:01:06.490> got

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:06.580 
it's like an icy carwash okay we've got

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.670 
it's like an icy carwash okay we've got
a<00:01:06.610> nice<00:01:06.880> sheen<00:01:07.180> of<00:01:07.210> ice<00:01:07.450> on<00:01:07.690> the<00:01:07.720> car<00:01:08.049> we've<00:01:08.560> got

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
a nice sheen of ice on the car we've got

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.680 
a nice sheen of ice on the car we've got
the<00:01:08.770> temperature<00:01:09.190> down<00:01:09.340> to<00:01:09.640> about<00:01:09.820> 15<00:01:10.360> degrees

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:10.690 
the temperature down to about 15 degrees

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.649 
the temperature down to about 15 degrees
below<00:01:10.720> zero<00:01:11.440> but<00:01:12.220> you<00:01:12.310> know<00:01:12.430> what<00:01:12.640> I<00:01:13.090> think<00:01:13.570> the

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:13.659 
below zero but you know what I think the

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:16.170 
below zero but you know what I think the
TDI<00:01:13.990> can<00:01:14.320> take<00:01:14.530> it<00:01:14.680> a<00:01:14.799> little<00:01:15.070> bit<00:01:15.369> colder

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.180 
TDI can take it a little bit colder

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.139 
TDI can take it a little bit colder
so<00:01:17.009> let's<00:01:18.009> crank<00:01:18.280> the<00:01:18.399> temperature<00:01:18.909> down<00:01:19.090> a

00:01:19.139 --> 00:01:19.149 
so let's crank the temperature down a

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:21.749 
so let's crank the temperature down a
little<00:01:19.509> bit<00:01:19.630> and<00:01:19.780> see<00:01:19.930> how<00:01:19.960> low<00:01:20.259> we<00:01:20.440> can<00:01:20.619> go<00:01:20.800> Ted

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:21.759 
little bit and see how low we can go Ted

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:26.820 
little bit and see how low we can go Ted
you're<00:01:21.970> okay<00:01:22.270> in<00:01:22.450> there<00:01:22.600> right<00:01:25.020> good<00:01:26.020> okay
