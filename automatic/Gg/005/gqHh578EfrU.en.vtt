Star Wars I had to come up with
environments<00:00:16.209> you<00:00:17.050> know<00:00:17.109> if<00:00:17.170> you<00:00:17.230> think<00:00:17.440> about

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:17.529 
environments you know if you think about

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:19.140 
environments you know if you think about
her<00:00:17.740> space<00:00:18.039> and<00:00:18.070> you<00:00:18.310> think<00:00:18.520> of<00:00:18.609> other<00:00:18.730> planets

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:19.150

they're all basically deserts so that

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.269 
they're all basically deserts so that
was<00:00:21.640> a<00:00:21.670> natural<00:00:21.990> to<00:00:22.990> be<00:00:23.140> able<00:00:23.260> to<00:00:23.439> go<00:00:23.769> you<00:00:24.100> know

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
kinds of things that slowed down the

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.149 
kinds of things that slowed down the
production<00:01:04.570> stopped<00:01:05.019> it<00:01:05.199> for<00:01:05.619> days<00:01:05.950> on<00:01:06.100> end

that<00:01:18.000> was<00:01:18.120> a<00:01:18.150> different<00:01:18.720> error<00:01:18.990> in<00:01:19.350> filmmaking

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
that was a different error in filmmaking

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.280 
that was a different error in filmmaking
history<00:01:20.610> then<00:01:20.820> in<00:01:21.210> those<00:01:21.480> days<00:01:21.750> virtually

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
history then in those days virtually

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.560 
history then in those days virtually
everything<00:01:22.620> had<00:01:22.980> to<00:01:23.010> be<00:01:23.430> built<00:01:23.850> physically

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
everything had to be built physically

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.900 
everything had to be built physically
whereas<00:01:25.170> we<00:01:25.350> have<00:01:25.560> much<00:01:26.130> more<00:01:26.310> flexibility

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:26.910 
whereas we have much more flexibility

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:28.520 
whereas we have much more flexibility
now<00:01:27.150> in<00:01:27.300> the<00:01:27.390> digital<00:01:27.720> arena<00:01:27.840> we're<00:01:28.320> getting

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
now in the digital arena we're getting

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.840 
now in the digital arena we're getting
closer<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:28.920> closer<00:01:29.190> to<00:01:29.490> where<00:01:29.580> we<00:01:29.670> have<00:01:29.760> to

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
closer and closer to where we have to

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.810 
closer and closer to where we have to
shoot<00:01:30.060> less<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:30.450> less<00:01:30.540> on<00:01:30.750> location<00:01:31.820> said
