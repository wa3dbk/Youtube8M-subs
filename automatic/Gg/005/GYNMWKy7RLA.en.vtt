00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:09.480
 he could not draw an artist but 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.950
 I had what I wanted to get 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.950
 here got 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:34.090
 balcony irregularly shaped wide 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.780
 parts meter sixty mask 40 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:38.640
 centimeters 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:40.600
 very so uncomfortable but we are wife 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.620
 ninety-first year placed 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.790
 wooden frame 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:48.580
 clapboard but the quality is not so hot 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:51.940
 frame general, does not tend to 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:56.260
 dry up to bend really need 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:57.940
 started whistling and they were solid then 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.370
 which is very much not satisfied with the fact that 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.620
 open it up but it was a balcony close 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:06.330
 rather fucking the balcony and i started looking 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:09.220
 Options that can be applied to the balcony 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.520
 started looking what firms can 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:17.229
 offer what they realize 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:19.690
 on which base is this slider cheese you found 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:22.270
 Flanders did not like the decision 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.860
 sliding well then began to look for someone 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.729
 does this slider 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:31.030
 Honestly I just found your two firms 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:33.130
 the farm and the second one I donâ€™t remember 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.850
 another then firms 3 asked one hundred percent 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.690
 prepayment 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:40.240
 I do not like to pay for the cat in your bag 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:43.720
 the firm requested 10 percent 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.700
 from the value of the contract prints are not so 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:50.200
 big money will be in fact 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:53.010
 Here today I paid I cook very much 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.500
 man picky and 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:58.680
 In general, the problem with contractors is not 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.120
 It arises to the fact that I require takachi 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.640
 which interests me. 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.980
 and here for lexander i watched the process but 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.500
 dismantling I was not a story and installation norm 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:09.930
 basically done there breaks faster 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:13.500
 pulled out something free not 

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:17.160
 Alexander very did seal 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.320
 well insulation is very cool there is well or 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.740
 sheathed well 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:25.290
 there is no much criticism 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:27.830
 I liked it more off 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.830
 get down 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.280
 this
