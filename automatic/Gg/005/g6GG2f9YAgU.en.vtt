hi<00:00:05.310> there<00:00:05.580> today<00:00:06.000> we<00:00:06.390> were<00:00:06.480> reviewing<00:00:06.750> the<00:00:06.899> 7x7

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
hi there today we were reviewing the 7x7

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.190 
hi there today we were reviewing the 7x7
made<00:00:07.950> by<00:00:08.130> shengshou<00:00:08.639> since<00:00:09.360> my<00:00:09.480> unboxing<00:00:09.750> i've

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
made by shengshou since my unboxing i've

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.990 
made by shengshou since my unboxing i've
done<00:00:10.440> some<00:00:10.620> things<00:00:10.830> to<00:00:10.920> this<00:00:11.130> cube<00:00:11.519> for<00:00:11.759> sure

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
done some things to this cube for sure

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.030 
done some things to this cube for sure
for<00:00:12.780> one<00:00:12.990> I<00:00:13.230> went<00:00:13.500> through<00:00:13.650> the<00:00:13.769> grueling

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
for one I went through the grueling

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.129 
for one I went through the grueling
process<00:00:14.370> of<00:00:14.790> wiping<00:00:15.179> out<00:00:15.330> all<00:00:15.509> the<00:00:15.870> Lube

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
process of wiping out all the Lube

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.470 
process of wiping out all the Lube
getting<00:00:16.859> rid<00:00:17.010> of<00:00:17.130> all<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:17.640> flash<00:00:17.910> and<00:00:18.300> then

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
getting rid of all the flash and then

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.599 
getting rid of all the flash and then
looping<00:00:18.930> it<00:00:19.050> again<00:00:19.380> and<00:00:20.130> putting<00:00:20.430> it<00:00:20.490> back

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
looping it again and putting it back

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.580 
looping it again and putting it back
together<00:00:20.820> but<00:00:21.270> let's<00:00:21.689> start<00:00:22.020> with<00:00:22.140> a<00:00:22.289> size

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
together but let's start with a size

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.380 
together but let's start with a size
comparison<00:00:22.890> a<00:00:23.670> 3x3<00:00:24.510> -<00:00:24.900> this<00:00:25.109> is<00:00:25.380> about<00:00:26.390> 5

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
comparison a 3x3 - this is about 5

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.800 
comparison a 3x3 - this is about 5
layers<00:00:27.810> and<00:00:28.380> a<00:00:28.890> 6x6

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:29.810 
layers and a 6x6

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:36.590 
layers and a 6x6
is<00:00:30.810> about<00:00:31.650> 6<00:00:31.980> layers<00:00:34.850> maybe<00:00:35.850> six<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.360> a

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
is about 6 layers maybe six and a

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:48.290 
is about 6 layers maybe six and a
quarter<00:00:36.809> I<00:00:37.670> also<00:00:38.670> have<00:00:39.030> here<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.660> vq<00:00:40.320> 7<00:00:44.539> and<00:00:47.300> the

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
quarter I also have here a vq 7 and the

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.660 
quarter I also have here a vq 7 and the
V<00:00:48.450> Cube<00:00:48.719> 7<00:00:49.110> if<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.469> V<00:00:49.620> Cube<00:00:49.860> 7<00:00:50.190> was<00:00:50.340> not

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
V Cube 7 if the V Cube 7 was not

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.790 
V Cube 7 if the V Cube 7 was not
pillowed<00:00:51.120> it<00:00:51.660> would<00:00:51.780> be<00:00:51.930> bigger<00:00:52.140> than<00:00:52.379> this<00:00:52.559> I

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
pillowed it would be bigger than this I

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.160 
pillowed it would be bigger than this I
can<00:00:52.949> tell<00:00:53.129> because<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.579> center<00:00:54.510> point<00:00:54.780> is<00:00:54.989> the

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
can tell because the center point is the

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.799 
can tell because the center point is the
highest<00:00:55.739> part<00:00:56.070> of<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.190> cube<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:56.789> it's<00:00:57.180> bigger

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
highest part of the cube and it's bigger

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.720 
highest part of the cube and it's bigger
that's<00:00:58.320> for<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.620> new-and-improved<00:00:58.949> turning

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
that's for the new-and-improved turning

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.080 
that's for the new-and-improved turning
it's<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.719> best<00:01:01.079> I've<00:01:01.350> ever<00:01:01.680> felt<00:01:02.010> in<00:01:02.699> any

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
it's the best I've ever felt in any

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.580 
it's the best I've ever felt in any
higher<00:01:04.019> order<00:01:04.379> cube<00:01:05.330> ever<00:01:06.330> all<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.350> layers

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
higher order cube ever all the layers

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.460 
higher order cube ever all the layers
but<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.220> outer<00:01:08.460> layers<00:01:08.850> especially<00:01:09.229> have<00:01:10.229> it

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
but the outer layers especially have it

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.660 
but the outer layers especially have it
like<00:01:10.680> a<00:01:10.860> silky<00:01:11.670> soft<00:01:12.540> but<00:01:13.170> ever<00:01:13.530> so<00:01:14.220> slightly

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
like a silky soft but ever so slightly

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.210 
like a silky soft but ever so slightly
bumpy<00:01:15.240> feel<00:01:15.750> just<00:01:16.740> so<00:01:17.689> slightly<00:01:18.740> the<00:01:19.740> bumpy

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
bumpy feel just so slightly the bumpy

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.950 
bumpy feel just so slightly the bumpy
feels<00:01:20.460> only<00:01:20.880> really<00:01:21.210> in<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.420> three<00:01:21.720> layers

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
feels only really in the three layers

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.270 
feels only really in the three layers
it's<00:01:22.590> just<00:01:22.860> barely<00:01:23.520> noticeable<00:01:24.920> the<00:01:25.920> only<00:01:26.159> way

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
it's just barely noticeable the only way

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.670 
it's just barely noticeable the only way
to<00:01:26.340> really<00:01:26.640> truly<00:01:27.060> fully<00:01:27.600> understand<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.560> way

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
to really truly fully understand the way

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.200 
to really truly fully understand the way
this<00:01:28.860> thing<00:01:29.130> turns<00:01:29.400> is<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:29.820> get<00:01:29.939> it<00:01:30.060> for

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
this thing turns is to get it for

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.810 
this thing turns is to get it for
yourself<00:01:30.299> as<00:01:31.049> far<00:01:31.409> as<00:01:31.500> alignment<00:01:31.979> goes<00:01:32.189> if<00:01:32.520> I

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
yourself as far as alignment goes if I

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.179 
yourself as far as alignment goes if I
flick<00:01:33.210> if<00:01:33.390> I<00:01:33.570> turn<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.840> layer<00:01:34.110> it<00:01:34.799> doesn't

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
flick if I turn a layer it doesn't

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.399 
flick if I turn a layer it doesn't
really<00:01:35.310> line<00:01:35.640> up<00:01:35.670> but<00:01:36.420> when<00:01:36.600> I'm<00:01:36.720> solving<00:01:37.079> I

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
really line up but when I'm solving I

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.620 
really line up but when I'm solving I
tend<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:37.770> turn<00:01:38.009> like<00:01:38.250> this<00:01:38.610> because<00:01:39.390> I<00:01:39.509> go

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
tend to turn like this because I go

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.469 
tend to turn like this because I go
slower<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:40.350> then<00:01:40.860> it<00:01:40.979> does<00:01:41.159> and<00:01:41.430> for<00:01:42.360> these

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
slower and then it does and for these

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.490 
slower and then it does and for these
layers<00:01:42.720> I<00:01:43.110> just<00:01:43.649> do<00:01:43.829> these<00:01:44.100> types<00:01:44.430> of<00:01:44.549> turns

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
layers I just do these types of turns

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.020 
layers I just do these types of turns
although<00:01:46.500> it<00:01:46.860> also<00:01:47.159> does<00:01:47.610> stay<00:01:47.850> in<00:01:47.970> alignment

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
although it also does stay in alignment

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.969 
although it also does stay in alignment
pretty<00:01:48.600> good<00:01:48.810> because<00:01:49.170> of<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.470> immensely

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
pretty good because of the immensely

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.069 
pretty good because of the immensely
good<00:01:50.250> corner<00:01:50.700> cutting<00:01:50.970> clocking<00:01:51.810> in<00:01:51.930> an

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
good corner cutting clocking in an

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.719 
good corner cutting clocking in an
average<00:01:52.560> of<00:01:52.740> about<00:01:53.750> 4/5<00:01:54.750> of<00:01:54.899> a<00:01:55.110> QB<00:01:55.619> pretty<00:01:56.549> much

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
average of about 4/5 of a QB pretty much

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.469 
average of about 4/5 of a QB pretty much
everywhere<00:01:57.540> on<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.740> cube<00:01:59.009> which<00:01:59.490> i<00:01:59.670> think<00:01:59.729> is

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
everywhere on the cube which i think is

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.899 
everywhere on the cube which i think is
the<00:02:01.170> best<00:02:01.560> some<00:02:01.950> of<00:02:02.040> my<00:02:02.130> seven<00:02:02.399> corner<00:02:02.700> cutting

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
the best some of my seven corner cutting

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.420 
the best some of my seven corner cutting
I've<00:02:03.240> ever<00:02:03.869> seen<00:02:04.200> this<00:02:04.649> cube<00:02:04.920> does<00:02:05.159> have<00:02:05.340> the

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
I've ever seen this cube does have the

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.819 
I've ever seen this cube does have the
capability<00:02:05.579> of<00:02:06.119> popping<00:02:06.810> if<00:02:07.020> you<00:02:07.170> strain<00:02:07.619> it

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
capability of popping if you strain it

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.669 
capability of popping if you strain it
too<00:02:08.670> hard<00:02:08.970> but<00:02:09.599> I<00:02:09.629> try<00:02:09.899> to<00:02:09.959> go<00:02:10.080> a<00:02:10.110> little<00:02:10.200> slower

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
too hard but I try to go a little slower

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.790 
too hard but I try to go a little slower
to<00:02:10.979> ensure<00:02:11.310> any<00:02:11.489> pops<00:02:11.879> do<00:02:12.239> not<00:02:12.390> occur

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
to ensure any pops do not occur

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.820 
to ensure any pops do not occur
one<00:02:13.460> thing<00:02:13.700> this<00:02:13.850> this<00:02:14.120> cube<00:02:14.690> does<00:02:14.960> lack<00:02:15.380> in<00:02:15.620> is

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
one thing this this cube does lack in is

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.130 
one thing this this cube does lack in is
its<00:02:16.040> feeling<00:02:16.490> of<00:02:16.610> steam<00:02:16.910> ability<00:02:17.450> as<00:02:17.660> I'm

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
its feeling of steam ability as I'm
