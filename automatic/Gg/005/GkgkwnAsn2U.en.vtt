00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:13.439
 the side a month that celebrates the day of the children we show for the 

00:00:13.439 --> 00:00:16.439
 planned this full of energy kids 

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:20.080
 This was almost done for 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.560
 four girls also decide since they will not give up 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.819
 of the use of the band of princesses in the apparent 

00:00:26.819 --> 00:00:29.819
 in fact this more 

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:35.010
 they are designated at their own volition, not 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.930
 it's very difficult to do 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.690
 they range from the most 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.790
 the delays 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.970
 solutions so that it participates that we then those who flee from the conventional and 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:47.519
 much more in lilac 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:48.590
 for the girl 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.570
 see architects' ideas for tadeu pt over 100 thousand posts reveal 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.290
 a poetic look at the parts and that exposure is in a museum. 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.370
 has just opened the doors to the community and all this in the 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.370
 today 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.990
 in fact this quartet was a challenge 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.159
 why like all 14 apartments are part of what he 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:51.210
 from disney 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.190
 one daughter 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.570
 little grandchild is calm 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.840
 is what we want to spend any 4th with standard cream cupboard 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.460
 would solve 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.080
 but I got married 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.960
 and my husband has three other daughters 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.830
 situations are three civilians if you had girls have a bigger problem 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.229
 But anyway I got curtains they should stay dry. 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:30.190
 We wanted to sign a little here and hit the team. 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:31.589
 they walk is 

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:34.290
 toys and feel at home 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.809
 also commented on his father's house in 

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:39.809
 instinctively that goes well 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:43.849
 We talk a lot with them and they want to stay some. 

00:02:44.669 --> 00:02:48.009
 and the rides a few tricks that can make everyone fit here in this 

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:51.009
 space 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:02:58.999
 like this 

00:02:58.999 --> 00:03:02.499
 I do not know the standard sizes of consumption since the first troop 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:04.879
 I know a little less 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:07.150
 they are peaks had dreams 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.420
 if they are the size of a sick child and need 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.420
 was 1% 

00:03:17.249 --> 00:03:21.419
 a very common problem that keeps an absolute secret, we do not know if 

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:23.999
 what dogs are cushioned with zipper 

00:03:23.999 --> 00:03:26.839
 to abrinq when we want a solution when I wake up in the morning at 

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:29.839
 seixal and returned to decorate the house 

00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:42.489
 we have a desk that she stays alone is a compact mobile 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:46.129
 little space at least still bumps into it 

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:50.360
 is also necessary because we have seen that none of us can do work 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.520
 That should be invented to do 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.520
 The activities 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:20.389
 in fact this most difficult Sudanese 

00:04:21.749 --> 00:04:24.770
 they are decided as well at will 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.510
 it's very difficult to do 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.370
 She is not playing the movie. 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.340
 their delays had a princess band 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.570
 I do not particularly like it, do not you? 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.060
 I eat what belongs 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:38.699
 it's a problem 

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:42.759
 but negotiate with them as soon as the strip between which not the impression 

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:44.889
 is that the paper of letters with sofas 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:47.889
 in other words but much slower does not matter 

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:14.979
 but after they only know these two tranches with me they wanted to go 

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:16.389
 more defeats 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:19.749
 so the 4th dan was based on these two shades 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:40.419
 if it's an important thing 

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:41.500
 technically 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.699
 this is very common nowadays 

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:45.099
 the media thing 

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:49.119
 children nowadays many of them without energy the girls all this time 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.990
 I did not try to use it to use all the cosmetic tissues, right? 

00:05:54.809 --> 00:05:57.990
 besides we should be all indices are well on who 

00:05:58.879 --> 00:06:00.319
 easy to clean 

00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:03.589
 the last episode 

00:06:03.589 --> 00:06:06.589
 erick all type staff was not found 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.069
 in other things work the way it works 

00:06:28.069 --> 00:06:30.119
 they have to d 

00:06:30.119 --> 00:06:32.860
 of the day but it's a kind of captivity thing 

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:35.999
 then if there is not a humanized entity another not 

00:06:35.999 --> 00:06:39.060
 tendency of all but the crazy ones yes 

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:40.280
 in each one has its 

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.990
 the athlete but the rest everybody 

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:45.990
 I share 

00:06:53.699 --> 00:06:59.139
 every customer he has this desire that desire his taste our role and know 

00:06:59.139 --> 00:07:00.099
 do better 

00:07:00.099 --> 00:07:00.879
 to retreat 

00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:03.550
 I use the advantage both also 

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:06.789
 this makes seeing that our kids actually are a delight 

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:12.280
 It's as if you're interested in him, so you can stop meeting me. 

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:12.999
 childhood 

00:07:12.999 --> 00:07:15.999
 for the weekend before they 

00:07:23.919 --> 00:07:27.210
 rose was also chosen Julia for the fourth 

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:28.409
 travel after the break
