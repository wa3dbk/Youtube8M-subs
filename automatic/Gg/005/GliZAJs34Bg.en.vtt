tomato<00:00:17.350> from<00:00:17.650> our<00:00:17.830> garden<00:00:18.029> wouldn't<00:00:19.029> impale

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:19.360 
tomato from our garden wouldn't impale

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.530 
tomato from our garden wouldn't impale
it<00:00:19.600> on<00:00:19.779> the<00:00:19.990> nails<00:00:20.260> I<00:00:20.680> don't<00:00:21.340> care<00:00:22.240> too<00:00:22.510> much

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:22.540 
it on the nails I don't care too much

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.080 
it on the nails I don't care too much
about<00:00:22.720> how<00:00:23.200> this<00:00:23.470> looks<00:00:23.770> so<00:00:24.130> I<00:00:24.160> will<00:00:24.460> use<00:00:24.490> it

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:25.090 
about how this looks so I will use it

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:27.870 
about how this looks so I will use it
with<00:00:25.300> the<00:00:25.420> nails<00:00:25.689> and<00:00:26.050> then<00:00:26.830> I<00:00:27.009> can<00:00:27.220> score<00:00:27.730> the

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:27.880 
with the nails and then I can score the

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.359 
with the nails and then I can score the
skin<00:00:28.180> first<00:00:28.540> which<00:00:28.840> makes<00:00:29.140> it<00:00:29.290> easier<00:00:29.770> to<00:00:29.890> cut

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:30.369 
skin first which makes it easier to cut

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:32.280 
skin first which makes it easier to cut
in<00:00:30.640> general<00:00:31.180> it<00:00:31.239> takes<00:00:31.480> a<00:00:31.570> pretty<00:00:31.720> sharp<00:00:31.989> knife

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:32.290 
in general it takes a pretty sharp knife

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.220 
in general it takes a pretty sharp knife
to<00:00:32.500> do<00:00:32.649> it<00:00:32.829> but<00:00:33.640> if<00:00:33.790> you<00:00:33.940> score<00:00:34.420> the<00:00:34.630> skin<00:00:34.899> first

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:35.230 
to do it but if you score the skin first

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.280 
to do it but if you score the skin first
they<00:00:36.130> don't<00:00:36.370> smash<00:00:36.970> your<00:00:37.239> tomato<00:00:37.960> while

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:38.290 
they don't smash your tomato while

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:39.930 
they don't smash your tomato while
you're<00:00:38.470> cutting<00:00:38.680> it<00:00:39.010> and<00:00:39.489> once<00:00:39.730> i'm<00:00:39.910> done

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:39.940 
you're cutting it and once i'm done

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.330 
you're cutting it and once i'm done
doing<00:00:40.270> that<00:00:40.420> i<00:00:40.780> can<00:00:40.960> just<00:00:41.110> go<00:00:41.290> back<00:00:41.320> in<00:00:41.770> and

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:42.340 
doing that i can just go back in and

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.160 
doing that i can just go back in and
it's<00:00:42.760> being<00:00:42.940> held<00:00:43.149> tightly<00:00:43.480> on<00:00:43.750> the<00:00:43.840> prongs

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.170 
it's being held tightly on the prongs

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.400 
it's being held tightly on the prongs
and<00:00:44.500> i<00:00:45.010> can<00:00:45.190> just<00:00:45.370> cut<00:00:45.610> from<00:00:45.850> side<00:00:46.149> to<00:00:46.360> side

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
and i can just cut from side to side

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.640 
and i can just cut from side to side
which<00:00:47.410> makes<00:00:47.680> it<00:00:47.830> fairly<00:00:48.160> easy<00:00:49.170> until<00:00:50.170> I<00:00:50.230> have

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:50.650 
which makes it fairly easy until I have

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:56.240 
which makes it fairly easy until I have
my<00:00:50.680> tomato<00:00:51.340> sliced<00:00:52.650> the<00:00:53.650> way<00:00:53.800> I<00:00:53.830> want<00:00:54.250> it<00:00:54.720> and

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
my tomato sliced the way I want it and

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.980 
my tomato sliced the way I want it and
that's<00:00:57.250> how<00:00:57.370> I<00:00:57.490> would<00:00:57.760> cut<00:00:58.030> the<00:00:58.210> tomato<00:00:58.600> into

00:00:58.980 --> 00:00:58.990 
that's how I would cut the tomato into

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:03.180 
that's how I would cut the tomato into
just<00:00:59.350> plain<00:00:59.860> slices<00:01:00.690> using<00:01:01.690> my<00:01:02.200> can<00:01:02.620> do<00:01:02.860> prep

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190 
just plain slices using my can do prep

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:10.050 
just plain slices using my can do prep
board<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:08.200> next<00:01:08.409> tomato<00:01:09.189> I'm<00:01:09.400> going<00:01:09.700> to<00:01:09.820> cut

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
board the next tomato I'm going to cut

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.840 
board the next tomato I'm going to cut
our<00:01:11.759> grape<00:01:12.759> tomatoes<00:01:13.270> this<00:01:13.509> also<00:01:13.720> works<00:01:14.049> with

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
our grape tomatoes this also works with

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.910 
our grape tomatoes this also works with
cherry<00:01:15.850> tomatoes<00:01:15.939> and<00:01:16.630> I<00:01:17.320> could<00:01:17.560> take<00:01:17.740> the

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
cherry tomatoes and I could take the

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.770 
cherry tomatoes and I could take the
small<00:01:18.189> tomato<00:01:18.550> and<00:01:18.940> I<00:01:19.030> can<00:01:19.210> put<00:01:19.390> it<00:01:19.479> right

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
small tomato and I can put it right

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.230 
small tomato and I can put it right
between<00:01:20.050> the<00:01:20.440> prongs<00:01:20.740> that<00:01:21.190> will<00:01:21.940> hold<00:01:22.090> it

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
between the prongs that will hold it

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.840 
between the prongs that will hold it
very<00:01:22.420> securely<00:01:22.990> and<00:01:23.350> then<00:01:23.409> I<00:01:24.070> can<00:01:24.280> just<00:01:24.310> slice

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
very securely and then I can just slice

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.140 
very securely and then I can just slice
it<00:01:24.880> down<00:01:25.300> and<00:01:25.750> I<00:01:26.350> get<00:01:26.650> a<00:01:26.890> couple<00:01:27.580> of<00:01:27.880> nice

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:28.150 
it down and I get a couple of nice

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.930 
it down and I get a couple of nice
half's<00:01:28.479> of<00:01:28.750> tomato<00:01:29.140> and<00:01:29.500> if<00:01:30.159> I<00:01:30.310> like<00:01:30.520> using<00:01:30.700> a

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:30.940 
half's of tomato and if I like using a

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.899 
half's of tomato and if I like using a
smaller<00:01:31.299> piece<00:01:31.720> with<00:01:32.350> the<00:01:32.380> flesh<00:01:32.860> side<00:01:33.159> up<00:01:33.580> I

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:33.909 
smaller piece with the flesh side up I

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:36.899 
smaller piece with the flesh side up I
can<00:01:34.570> just<00:01:34.780> chop<00:01:35.170> it<00:01:35.200> down<00:01:35.380> that<00:01:35.830> up<00:01:36.040> and<00:01:36.400> with

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:36.909 
can just chop it down that up and with

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:38.760 
can just chop it down that up and with
the<00:01:37.060> flesh<00:01:37.330> side<00:01:37.570> up<00:01:37.810> it's<00:01:38.020> easier<00:01:38.380> to<00:01:38.530> cut

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
the flesh side up it's easier to cut

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.830 
the flesh side up it's easier to cut
then<00:01:39.430> it<00:01:39.580> would<00:01:39.790> be<00:01:39.940> for<00:01:40.150> instance<00:01:40.510> with<00:01:40.690> the

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
then it would be for instance with the

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.020 
then it would be for instance with the
skin<00:01:41.140> side<00:01:41.170> because<00:01:41.740> it's<00:01:41.920> tougher<00:01:42.790> and

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
skin side because it's tougher and

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.090 
skin side because it's tougher and
they'll<00:01:43.510> squash<00:01:43.930> you'll<00:01:44.409> go<00:01:44.619> all<00:01:44.740> over<00:01:44.920> the

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
they'll squash you'll go all over the

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.850 
they'll squash you'll go all over the
place<00:01:45.310> eventually<00:01:45.700> it<00:01:46.060> will<00:01:46.150> cut<00:01:46.420> but<00:01:47.320> this

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
place eventually it will cut but this

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.660 
place eventually it will cut but this
piece<00:01:48.600> doesn't<00:01:49.600> look<00:01:49.990> nearly<00:01:50.350> as<00:01:50.470> nice<00:01:51.040> as<00:01:51.369> the

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
piece doesn't look nearly as nice as the

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.170 
piece doesn't look nearly as nice as the
nice<00:01:52.030> even<00:01:52.630> cuts<00:01:53.140> on<00:01:53.470> the<00:01:53.830> builds<00:01:54.820> minutes

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
nice even cuts on the builds minutes

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.210 
nice even cuts on the builds minutes
again<00:01:55.479> I<00:01:55.750> can<00:01:56.290> just<00:01:56.470> put<00:01:56.680> it<00:01:56.770> between<00:01:56.920> the

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
again I can just put it between the

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.760 
again I can just put it between the
problems<00:01:57.700> and<00:01:57.909> I<00:01:58.119> can<00:01:58.330> view<00:01:58.570> a<00:01:58.900> couple<00:01:59.380> of<00:01:59.470> five

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
problems and I can view a couple of five

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.170 
problems and I can view a couple of five
actually<00:02:00.070> and<00:02:00.549> then<00:02:01.420> just<00:02:01.630> slice<00:02:02.049> down<00:02:02.439> Burt

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
actually and then just slice down Burt

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.109 
actually and then just slice down Burt
and<00:02:04.180> I<00:02:04.330> get<00:02:04.659> a<00:02:04.869> nice<00:02:05.530> chopped<00:02:06.400> or<00:02:06.760> a<00:02:06.820> nice

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
and I get a nice chopped or a nice

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:08.080
