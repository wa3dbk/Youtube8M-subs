00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
sitting atop a super volcano and it just

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.120 
sitting atop a super volcano and it just
took<00:00:09.150> what<00:00:09.360> scientists<00:00:09.929> describe<00:00:10.200> as<00:00:10.469> a<00:00:10.500> deep

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
took what scientists describe as a deep

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.610 
took what scientists describe as a deep
breath<00:00:11.670> causing<00:00:12.240> miles<00:00:12.630> of<00:00:12.840> ground<00:00:13.080> to<00:00:13.410> rise

breath causing miles of ground to rise

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.530 
breath causing miles of ground to rise
dramatically<00:00:14.370> so<00:00:14.849> what<00:00:15.179> does<00:00:15.299> this<00:00:15.480> mean

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
dramatically so what does this mean

destroy the United States as we know it
this<00:00:50.969> is<00:00:51.149> a<00:00:51.180> pretty<00:00:51.660> scary<00:00:51.809> prospect<00:00:52.440> I<00:00:52.770> want

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
this is a pretty scary prospect I want

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.260 
this is a pretty scary prospect I want
to<00:00:53.010> just<00:00:53.219> show<00:00:53.280> people<00:00:53.430> what<00:00:53.789> we're<00:00:53.910> talking

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
to just show people what we're talking

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.790 
to just show people what we're talking
about<00:00:54.300> here<00:00:54.480> when<00:00:54.809> we<00:00:54.899> talk<00:00:55.260> about<00:00:55.289> this<00:00:55.590> super

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
about here when we talk about this super

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.639 
about here when we talk about this super
volcano<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:56.640> we<00:00:57.059> have<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.210> little<00:00:57.500> thing<00:00:58.500> to

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
volcano and we have a little thing to

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.020 
volcano and we have a little thing to
show<00:00:58.800> you<00:00:58.859> a<00:00:58.920> map<00:00:59.219> with<00:00:59.430> some<00:00:59.550> of<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.730> details

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
show you a map with some of the details

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.139 
show you a map with some of the details
so<00:01:00.180> that's<00:01:00.359> where<00:01:00.570> it<00:01:00.660> is<00:01:00.960> it's<00:01:01.230> an<00:01:02.149> unbeknown

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
so that's where it is it's an unbeknown

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.479 
so that's where it is it's an unbeknown
it's<00:01:03.449> been<00:01:03.960> there<00:01:04.229> as<00:01:04.650> we<00:01:04.860> know<00:01:05.040> I<00:01:05.070> guess<00:01:05.339> this

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
it's been there as we know I guess this

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.520 
it's been there as we know I guess this
is<00:01:05.670> rupted<00:01:05.939> three<00:01:06.119> times<00:01:06.360> in<00:01:06.540> 2.1<00:01:07.320> million

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
is rupted three times in 2.1 million

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.010 
is rupted three times in 2.1 million
years<00:01:07.939> but<00:01:08.939> what<00:01:09.270> they're<00:01:09.420> worried<00:01:09.689> about<00:01:09.869> is

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
years but what they're worried about is

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.480 
years but what they're worried about is
the<00:01:10.140> fact<00:01:10.260> that<00:01:10.380> they<00:01:10.560> say<00:01:10.770> that<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.250> ground

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
the fact that they say that the ground

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.490 
the fact that they say that the ground
has<00:01:11.700> started<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.180> swell<00:01:12.570> in<00:01:12.869> levels<00:01:13.320> that<00:01:13.409> they

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
has started to swell in levels that they

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.800 
has started to swell in levels that they
have<00:01:13.619> not<00:01:13.770> seen<00:01:14.040> before<00:01:14.280> 10<00:01:14.790> inches<00:01:15.150> in<00:01:15.330> some

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
have not seen before 10 inches in some

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.300 
have not seen before 10 inches in some
places<00:01:16.049> in<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.350> past<00:01:16.590> year<00:01:16.860> what<00:01:17.159> does<00:01:17.280> that

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
places in the past year what does that

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.249 
places in the past year what does that
tell<00:01:17.580> us<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:18.270> tells<00:01:18.540> us<00:01:18.780> that<00:01:18.930> there<00:01:19.110> is

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
tell us it tells us that there is

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.800 
tell us it tells us that there is
activity<00:01:19.740> in<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.400> super<00:01:20.700> volcano<00:01:20.850> which

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
activity in the super volcano which

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.920 
activity in the super volcano which
erupts<00:01:22.470> roughly<00:01:23.070> every<00:01:23.580> 600<00:01:24.360> million<00:01:24.750> years

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
erupts roughly every 600 million years

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.179 
erupts roughly every 600 million years
and<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:26.280> last<00:01:26.310> eruption<00:01:27.000> was<00:01:27.950> 640<00:01:28.950> million

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
and the last eruption was 640 million

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.700 
and the last eruption was 640 million
years<00:01:29.520> ago<00:01:29.790> 640<00:01:30.630> million<00:01:30.869> or<00:01:31.170> thousand

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
years ago 640 million or thousand

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.740 
years ago 640 million or thousand
thousand<00:01:32.400> years<00:01:32.520> ago<00:01:32.640> I'm<00:01:32.790> sorry<00:01:33.060> then<00:01:33.450> we<00:01:33.600> had

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
thousand years ago I'm sorry then we had

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.210 
thousand years ago I'm sorry then we had
some<00:01:33.900> more<00:01:34.049> time<00:01:34.229> then<00:01:34.590> we<00:01:34.650> have<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:34.920> retire

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
some more time then we have to retire

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.880 
some more time then we have to retire
but<00:01:36.119> that's<00:01:36.329> what's<00:01:36.540> making<00:01:36.689> us<00:01:36.900> very<00:01:36.960> nervous

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
but that's what's making us very nervous

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.219 
but that's what's making us very nervous
because<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.640> cycle<00:01:39.060> time<00:01:39.090> corresponds<00:01:40.049> to

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
because the cycle time corresponds to

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.219 
because the cycle time corresponds to
the<00:01:40.439> present<00:01:41.159> day<00:01:41.189> era<00:01:41.610> so<00:01:42.240> every<00:01:42.689> single<00:01:43.020> burp

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
the present day era so every single burp

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.830 
the present day era so every single burp

level<00:01:48.689> has<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:49.200> be<00:01:49.290> watched<00:01:49.530> very<00:01:49.860> carefully

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
level has to be watched very carefully

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.219 
level has to be watched very carefully
alright<00:01:51.180> so<00:01:51.329> when<00:01:51.479> we<00:01:51.570> talk<00:01:51.780> about<00:01:51.810> this<00:01:52.079> and

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
alright so when we talk about this and

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.200 
alright so when we talk about this and
we<00:01:52.290> have<00:01:52.439> pictures<00:01:52.770> we<00:01:53.490> have<00:01:53.520> pictures<00:01:53.880> of

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
we have pictures we have pictures of

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.819 
we have pictures we have pictures of
mount<00:01:54.600> st.<00:01:54.840> Helen<00:01:55.170> erupting<00:01:55.530> back<00:01:55.680> in

mount st. Helen erupting back in
nineteen<00:01:56.100> eighty<00:01:56.189> let's<00:01:56.430> just<00:01:56.610> show<00:01:56.729> this

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
nineteen eighty let's just show this

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.060 
nineteen eighty let's just show this
right<00:01:57.119> now<00:01:57.240> you<00:01:57.630> say<00:01:57.810> that<00:01:57.930> an<00:01:58.049> explosion<00:01:58.290> with

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
right now you say that an explosion with

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.889 
right now you say that an explosion with
this<00:01:59.280> super<00:01:59.579> volcano<00:01:59.969> under<00:02:00.240> Yellowstone<00:02:00.869> and

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
this super volcano under Yellowstone and

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.270 
this super volcano under Yellowstone and
there<00:02:01.439> we're<00:02:01.619> seeing<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:01.890> Mount<00:02:02.040> st.<00:02:02.250> Helens

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
there we're seeing the Mount st. Helens

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.760 
there we're seeing the Mount st. Helens
would<00:02:02.820> be<00:02:02.909> a<00:02:02.939> thousand<00:02:03.689> times<00:02:04.020> bigger<00:02:04.590> than

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
would be a thousand times bigger than

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.470 
would be a thousand times bigger than
this<00:02:05.070> what<00:02:05.369> type<00:02:05.549> of<00:02:05.579> damage<00:02:06.000> are<00:02:06.090> we<00:02:06.149> talk

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:06.480 
this what type of damage are we talk

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.610 
this what type of damage are we talk
I'm<00:02:06.540> out<00:02:06.660> here<00:02:06.840> we're<00:02:07.200> talking<00:02:07.500> about

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:07.620 
I'm out here we're talking about

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.710 
I'm out here we're talking about
immediate<00:02:08.190> damage<00:02:08.340> out<00:02:08.730> to<00:02:08.970> a<00:02:09.000> hundred<00:02:09.480> miles

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
immediate damage out to a hundred miles

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.310 
immediate damage out to a hundred miles
from<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.290> site<00:02:10.530> that<00:02:10.830> is<00:02:10.860> total<00:02:11.490> devastation

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320 
from the site that is total devastation

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.690 
from the site that is total devastation
basically<00:02:13.320> wiping<00:02:13.860> out<00:02:13.980> everything<00:02:14.100> in<00:02:14.460> sight

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
basically wiping out everything in sight

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.720 
basically wiping out everything in sight
however<00:02:14.910> the<00:02:15.750> real<00:02:15.960> damage<00:02:16.410> goes<00:02:16.560> out<00:02:16.740> to<00:02:16.890> 500

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
however the real damage goes out to 500

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.510 
however the real damage goes out to 500
miles<00:02:18.030> if<00:02:18.360> you<00:02:18.390> include<00:02:18.750> volcanic<00:02:19.230> ash

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520

poisonous gases death of wildlife and

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.940 
poisonous gases death of wildlife and
vegetation<00:02:23.190> and<00:02:24.090> that's<00:02:24.810> a<00:02:25.140> ring<00:02:25.470> about<00:02:25.920> a

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
vegetation and that's a ring about a

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.580 
vegetation and that's a ring about a
thousand<00:02:26.580> miles<00:02:26.790> across<00:02:27.240> that<00:02:27.690> Rohani<00:02:28.050> of

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
thousand miles across that Rohani of

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.310 
thousand miles across that Rohani of
America<00:02:29.070> it<00:02:29.820> would<00:02:30.540> pretty<00:02:30.720> much<00:02:30.810> wipeout

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
America it would pretty much wipeout

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.380 
America it would pretty much wipeout
Earth<00:02:31.860> as<00:02:32.100> we<00:02:32.130> know<00:02:32.250> it<00:02:32.520> it<00:02:32.940> would<00:02:33.090> wipe<00:02:33.240> out

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
Earth as we know it it would wipe out

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.540 
Earth as we know it it would wipe out
the<00:02:33.540> United<00:02:33.870> States<00:02:34.140> as<00:02:34.470> we<00:02:34.890> know<00:02:35.190> it<00:02:35.370> and

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
the United States as we know it and

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.550 
the United States as we know it and
again<00:02:36.000> we<00:02:36.180> don't<00:02:36.330> want<00:02:36.450> to<00:02:36.540> panic<00:02:36.720> anybody<00:02:37.260> it

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
again we don't want to panic anybody it

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.530 
again we don't want to panic anybody it
could<00:02:37.710> happen<00:02:38.040> tomorrow<00:02:38.430> or<00:02:39.000> it<00:02:39.270> could<00:02:39.390> happen

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
could happen tomorrow or it could happen

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.320 
could happen tomorrow or it could happen
a<00:02:39.810> hundred<00:02:40.080> thousand<00:02:41.010> years<00:02:41.310> from<00:02:41.400> now<00:02:41.760> it's

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
a hundred thousand years from now it's

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.270 
a hundred thousand years from now it's
black<00:02:42.660> magic<00:02:42.690> trying<00:02:43.590> to<00:02:43.710> predict<00:02:44.100> exactly

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
black magic trying to predict exactly

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.880 
black magic trying to predict exactly
when<00:02:45.000> it's<00:02:45.300> going<00:02:45.600> to<00:02:45.750> blow<00:02:46.020> but<00:02:46.410> we<00:02:46.530> do<00:02:46.680> know

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
when it's going to blow but we do know

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.580 
when it's going to blow but we do know
one<00:02:47.100> thing<00:02:47.130> one<00:02:47.940> day<00:02:48.210> it<00:02:48.540> will<00:02:48.810> blow<00:02:49.110> saying

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
one thing one day it will blow saying

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:50.750 
one thing one day it will blow saying
you<00:02:49.680> say<00:02:49.890> that<00:02:50.040> something<00:02:50.220> on<00:02:50.400> this<00:02:50.490> scale<00:02:50.550> is

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
you say that something on this scale is

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.270 
you say that something on this scale is
what<00:02:51.030> wiped<00:02:51.390> out<00:02:51.540> the<00:02:51.630> dinosaurs<00:02:51.860> 65<00:02:52.860> million

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
what wiped out the dinosaurs 65 million

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.330 
what wiped out the dinosaurs 65 million
years<00:02:53.430> ago<00:02:53.580> another<00:02:54.120> super<00:02:54.600> volcano

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
years ago another super volcano

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.410 
years ago another super volcano
coincided<00:02:56.340> with<00:02:56.370> this<00:02:56.700> meteor<00:02:57.120> that<00:02:57.360> hit

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
coincided with this meteor that hit

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.360 
coincided with this meteor that hit
Mexico<00:02:58.170> and<00:02:58.410> we<00:02:58.470> think<00:02:58.710> it<00:02:58.800> was<00:02:58.920> a<00:02:58.950> double

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
Mexico and we think it was a double

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.060 
Mexico and we think it was a double
whammy<00:02:59.580> that<00:03:00.240> knocked<00:03:00.570> out<00:03:00.810> the<00:03:00.990> dinosaurs<00:03:01.380> so

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
whammy that knocked out the dinosaurs so

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:03.580 
whammy that knocked out the dinosaurs so
it's<00:03:02.190> something<00:03:02.340> we<00:03:02.580> take<00:03:02.730> very<00:03:02.790> seriously

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
it's something we take very seriously

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.170 
it's something we take very seriously
but<00:03:04.590> again<00:03:04.680> the<00:03:04.980> cycle<00:03:05.340> time<00:03:05.550> is<00:03:05.580> measured<00:03:05.910> on

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
but again the cycle time is measured on

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.000 
but again the cycle time is measured on
the<00:03:06.360> scale<00:03:06.630> of<00:03:06.840> hundreds<00:03:07.470> of<00:03:07.560> thousands<00:03:07.950> of

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
the scale of hundreds of thousands of

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.680 
the scale of hundreds of thousands of
years<00:03:08.250> would<00:03:08.610> there<00:03:08.760> be<00:03:08.790> anything<00:03:09.210> we<00:03:09.510> could

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
years would there be anything we could

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.500 
years would there be anything we could
do<00:03:09.810> to<00:03:09.840> prepare<00:03:10.410> or<00:03:11.160> to<00:03:11.610> get<00:03:11.940> people<00:03:12.330> out<00:03:12.450> I

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
do to prepare or to get people out I

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.660 
do to prepare or to get people out I
mean<00:03:12.750> how<00:03:12.900> much<00:03:13.020> of<00:03:13.200> a<00:03:13.290> warning<00:03:13.620> might<00:03:14.280> we<00:03:14.459> get

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
mean how much of a warning might we get

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.110 
mean how much of a warning might we get
with<00:03:14.820> this<00:03:14.910> eruption<00:03:15.209> all<00:03:15.870> you<00:03:16.080> can<00:03:16.260> do<00:03:16.380> is<00:03:16.560> run

with this eruption all you can do is run

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.550 
with this eruption all you can do is run
you<00:03:18.120> don't<00:03:18.300> get<00:03:18.450> much<00:03:18.600> warning<00:03:18.990> what<00:03:19.200> happened

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
you don't get much warning what happened

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.830 
you don't get much warning what happened
is<00:03:19.650> the<00:03:19.770> ground<00:03:20.310> starts<00:03:20.640> to<00:03:20.790> rise<00:03:20.940> more<00:03:21.570> and

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
is the ground starts to rise more and

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.350 
is the ground starts to rise more and
more<00:03:22.050> earthquakes<00:03:22.290> take<00:03:22.830> place<00:03:23.100> more<00:03:23.700> ash<00:03:24.000> and

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
volcanic gases start to be unleashed

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.280 
volcanic gases start to be unleashed
that's<00:03:26.880> about<00:03:27.090> the<00:03:27.239> only<00:03:27.270> warning<00:03:27.750> we<00:03:27.989> get

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
that's about the only warning we get
