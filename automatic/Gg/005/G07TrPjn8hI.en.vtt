00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
thing to check with your fuses and it's

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:13.400 
thing to check with your fuses and it's
how<00:00:12.900> you<00:00:12.960> do<00:00:13.110> it

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
how you do it

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.070 
how you do it
find<00:00:14.370> your<00:00:14.490> fuse<00:00:14.670> box<00:00:14.700> check<00:00:15.389> your<00:00:15.570> manual<00:00:15.960> if

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
find your fuse box check your manual if

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.939 
find your fuse box check your manual if
in<00:00:16.199> which<00:00:16.379> your<00:00:16.710> fuse<00:00:17.039> box<00:00:17.070> fuse<00:00:17.850> box<00:00:18.090> is<00:00:18.949> so

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
in which your fuse box fuse box is so

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.710 
in which your fuse box fuse box is so
you<00:00:20.070> just<00:00:20.220> pop<00:00:20.520> it<00:00:20.730> off<00:00:22.340> and<00:00:23.359> behind<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.449> fuse

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
you just pop it off and behind the fuse

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.390 
you just pop it off and behind the fuse
box<00:00:24.869> of<00:00:25.109> your<00:00:25.230> out<00:00:25.289> of<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.439> lid<00:00:25.710> you<00:00:26.010> can<00:00:26.099> see

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
box of your out of the lid you can see

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.550 
box of your out of the lid you can see
it<00:00:26.910> tells<00:00:27.090> you<00:00:27.240> what<00:00:27.359> everything<00:00:27.750> is<00:00:27.869> that's

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
it tells you what everything is that's

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.250 
it tells you what everything is that's
over<00:00:28.949> here<00:00:29.099> in<00:00:29.160> fuse<00:00:29.519> panel<00:00:29.939> relays<00:00:30.510> and<00:00:30.779> fuses

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
ground of the battery and just go over

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.209 
ground of the battery and just go over
here<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:44.100> you're<00:00:44.850> going<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.030> see<00:00:45.180> two<00:00:45.480> little

00:00:46.209 --> 00:00:46.219 
here and you're going to see two little

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:49.100 
here and you're going to see two little
you<00:00:47.219> can<00:00:47.340> see<00:00:47.460> two<00:00:47.670> little<00:00:48.000> pieces<00:00:48.750> of<00:00:48.930> metal

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
you can see two little pieces of metal

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.930 
you can see two little pieces of metal
sticking<00:00:49.500> out<00:00:49.770> one<00:00:50.100> on<00:00:50.219> either<00:00:50.399> end<00:00:50.730> of<00:00:50.879> the

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
sticking out one on either end of the

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.459 
sticking out one on either end of the
fuse<00:00:51.300> you<00:00:51.570> just<00:00:51.899> touch<00:00:52.140> that<00:00:54.020> that's<00:00:55.020> one<00:00:55.289> end

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
fuse you just touch that that's one end

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.770 
fuse you just touch that that's one end
and<00:00:55.710> touch<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.250> other<00:00:56.280> end<00:00:56.670> you<00:00:56.940> share<00:00:57.539> power

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
and touch the other end you share power

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.930 
and touch the other end you share power
going<00:00:58.050> through<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.559> both<00:00:58.739> now<00:00:59.550> if<00:00:59.609> you<00:00:59.789> have

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
going through to both now if you have

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.090 
going through to both now if you have
power<00:01:00.210> only<00:01:00.690> one<00:01:00.870> side<00:01:01.079> has<00:01:01.199> power<00:01:01.469> then<00:01:01.920> the

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
power only one side has power then the

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.760 
power only one side has power then the
fuse<00:01:02.340> is<00:01:02.399> bad<00:01:03.049> all<00:01:04.049> right

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.070 

you<00:01:07.770> could<00:01:07.950> also<00:01:08.070> connect<00:01:08.580> your<00:01:09.030> ground<00:01:09.420> to

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
you could also connect your ground to

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.500 
you could also connect your ground to
part<00:01:10.530> of<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.710> frame<00:01:11.040> or<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:12.000> brake<00:01:12.240> lines

part of the frame or the brake lines

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.200 
part of the frame or the brake lines
also<00:01:12.750> good<00:01:13.140> grounds<00:01:13.790> if<00:01:14.790> you<00:01:14.909> don't<00:01:15.090> have<00:01:15.180> a

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
also good grounds if you don't have a

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.240 
also good grounds if you don't have a
test<00:01:15.479> light<00:01:17.479> you<00:01:18.479> could<00:01:18.689> also<00:01:18.950> take<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:20.009> look

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
test light you could also take a look

you're<00:01:35.220> going<00:01:35.340> to<00:01:35.460> see<00:01:36.829> thin<00:01:37.829> piece<00:01:38.040> of<00:01:38.220> metal

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
you're going to see thin piece of metal

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.850 
you're going to see thin piece of metal
if<00:01:39.119> that<00:01:39.329> metal<00:01:39.540> is<00:01:39.780> not<00:01:39.930> in<00:01:40.140> contact<00:01:40.409> it's

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
if that metal is not in contact it's

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.420 
if that metal is not in contact it's
burnt<00:01:41.159> off<00:01:42.560> connecting<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.619> two<00:01:43.770> tabs<00:01:44.070> on

either end that means your fuses bad and
when<00:01:48.659> you<00:01:48.750> do<00:01:48.899> replace<00:01:49.049> it<00:01:49.470> there's<00:01:49.710> an

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
when you do replace it there's an

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.789 
when you do replace it there's an
amperage<00:01:50.189> rating<00:01:50.579> on<00:01:50.700> it<00:01:50.880> this<00:01:51.390> is<00:01:51.450> a<00:01:51.659> 20<00:01:52.140> make

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
amperage rating on it this is a 20 make

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.270 
amperage rating on it this is a 20 make
sure<00:01:52.979> you<00:01:53.100> replace<00:01:53.399> with<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.700> same<00:01:53.939> amperage

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
sure you replace with the same amperage

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.420 
sure you replace with the same amperage
all<00:01:56.280> right<00:01:56.399> thanks<00:01:56.939> for<00:01:57.000> watching
