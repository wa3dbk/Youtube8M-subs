00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.360
 already but here we are at a date with 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.950
 the section on how to dress children 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.179
 as I promised you last 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.639
 week 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.730
 today we will talk about a perfect look for 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.230
 your little boy for whatever journey 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.750
 I was on a ship 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.700
 I refer above all to Rome 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.910
 these tips as I already had 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:29.460
 just mentioned for the female go 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.410
 great even for the ship because the 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.480
 fundamental problem which is the air 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.870
 conditioning than in these media of 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.059
 transport shoots at 2000 and then I have 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.129
 always with great cold and in order to avoid 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.429
 make our children sick before 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.440
 get to the vacation spot as 

00:00:44.429 --> 00:00:48.359
 at least we expect from all year 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.050
 point of going on vacation are i 

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:52.649
 our children 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.839
 we look for a look that is suitable comfortable 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.760
 it is perfect for this occasion then 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:59.460
 I already had the main advice 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.350
 said speaking of the female 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.290
 I repeat it is to do 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:08.070
 Wear your child one 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.890
 real long-sleeved shirt that if 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.710
 you will have to face the journey at 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:18.000
 lunch maybe on the way from home to 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.350
 relationship maybe maybe it's better if you 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.930
 wear a shirt but who 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.550
 court and then change it before 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.740
 take off remember it because once 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.390
 taken off the air conditioning comes 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.030
 fired then maybe if yours 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.160
 baby is a little sweaty will not be the 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.740
 chance at that time to change it if 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.870
 however you will have to face the journey there 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.330
 early morning anyway in the evening or in 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:42.690
 of the hours in which it does so a 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.220
 great warm advice to start the 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.090
 your child precisely with the shirt 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.500
 Long sleeves 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.490
 I show her a friend with her 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.680
 very clean cut oak but you 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.930
 take the shirt to the closet is more 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.780
 your child likes the important thing is 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.550
 that has long sleeves 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.830
 above this shirt clearly there 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.300
 wants a female because that puts it from 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.430
 carry in your bag not to wear 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.440
 first to leave because 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.440
 indeterminate moments precisely the cold 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:13.830
 will be intense siena 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.990
 me that in having then to any that 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:19.950
 you have got me in the closet I took 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:22.620
 this but any sweatshirt is fine 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:26.070
 I advise and not be overly 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:28.650
 heavy because it has always been 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:31.140
 always hot enough and therefore for 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:34.380
 prevent your child on 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.760
 particularly a slice 7 keep 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.990
 the temperature but that is not 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:42.450
 too heavy underneath 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:45.510
 choose you the important thing is how you like it 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.940
 he said is that the pants he wants 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.800
 give up you decide to get heart attacks 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.030
 check me don't have the button in 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.670
 bit 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.500
 if clearly your flight will be of a 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.000
 now you can also put a pair of 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.010
 jeans but they are not the best of 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.750
 modality especially in the case in which the 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:05.400
 your journey lasts a little longer then 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:08.100
 invited james avoided the trousers a 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.890
 button and opt for comfortable trousers 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:14.730
 those will be fine in this case 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:17.370
 of the overalls with these went here 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.650
 really more than good will be 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.050
 very comfortable and your child can 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:25.020
 face any kind of journey 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:27.270
 a pair of trousers is also fine 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:29.220
 shorts in the event that the trip is in fact 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:31.380
 it's not too long 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.350
 I prefer long trousers anyway 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:37.110
 and because the air arrives kalle anyway 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:39.360
 legs even if I repeat the children have 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:42.090
 cooler in the upper part 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.920
 the important thing is that there is elastic in 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.170
 life and therefore can at least can 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:49.200
 be comfortable quiet that you can 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:52.560
 quietly enjoy the journey that 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.850
 they will go to make the foularino because it 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.769
 you know by now I love it 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.390
 because it completes every look and why it is 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:58.420
 important in case I do 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.430
 some cold they were 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.440
 work and you can use it as 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.550
 cover must be able to put on 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:09.400
 shoulder light with a foularino a 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:12.010
 endless utilities and therefore bring the 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.380
 always by f1 bag with foularino le 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.840
 shoes also in this case I a pair 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:19.030
 of sneakers because I believe that anyway 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:24.040
 be better your child has the 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:26.169
 short foot covered even if second 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.360
 they arrange them to be light cones 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:31.570
 these are very light and very practical 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:34.060
 they are in canvas so in case it is 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:36.280
 however hot they will be fine in 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.410
 plane still feet discovered in my opinion 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:40.690
 I am not at the maximum because precisely the 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:42.100
 cold passes from the feet as he told me 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:43.690
 always mom 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.520
 cover your feet because that's where you are 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:49.330
 they all catch cold the flu 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:53.320
 so dear mom was right and so 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:55.870
 these sneakers are therefore recommended 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:58.840
 the look and this note sneakers by 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:01.450
 comfortable and practical our scarf 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.070
 in a pair of pants I recommend you 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:05.800
 the long ones of the suit will go 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:08.229
 very good any type or brady georges 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:10.720
 you see a shirt but the surgeon 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:15.220
 it is fundamental and a slice also in 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:17.229
 this case if you arrive at a place that 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:19.390
 it is warm that you may know that the room 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:21.789
 it is not ready however that you will know that 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:23.620
 you have to do other things around 

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:26.680
 etc. you don't want to say believe the 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:28.330
 suitcase and look for a change puts 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.460
 camera your bag take the 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:33.190
 your bag and inside it takes that 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:36.160
 two things will really suffice here one 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:37.419
 pair of sandals and then you put on 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.250
 your sandals came into it 

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:42.010
 airport of dreams and fine-tuning 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:43.600
 all the sneakers and put on the sandals 

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:46.990
 in your children so you can go 

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:48.910
 even quietly around if it does 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:51.370
 very hot 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:53.919
 a short-sleeved shirt a 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:56.770
 T-shirt short sleeves and quiet 

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:58.930
 if you want even a costume like that maybe 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:01.150
 you can take and go directly 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:03.100
 to the sea without 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:05.950
 need to return to the back cover the 

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:07.470
 suitcase that takes the change 

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:10.990
 the look is also done this time 

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:12.160
 fast if you have something 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:14.980
 don't measure something to add 

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:16.750
