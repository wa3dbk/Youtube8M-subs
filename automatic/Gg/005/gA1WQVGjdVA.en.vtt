insulation plastic is the tanks are
wrapped<00:00:29.609> in<00:00:29.730> mainly<00:00:30.539> because<00:00:30.660> I<00:00:30.869> don't<00:00:31.019> want

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
wrapped in mainly because I don't want

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.810 
wrapped in mainly because I don't want
to<00:00:31.199> start<00:00:31.349> spraying<00:00:31.740> paints<00:00:32.189> around<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.610> fish

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.330 
give you a look at what I'm talking
about<00:01:06.150> with<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.619> sump<00:01:07.619> tank<00:01:07.799> over<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.189> back

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
about with the sump tank over the back

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.490 
about with the sump tank over the back
there<00:01:08.580> so<00:01:09.090> there's<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.479> silver<00:01:09.869> radial<00:01:10.350> flow

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
there so there's the silver radial flow

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.340 
there so there's the silver radial flow
the<00:01:10.860> biofilter<00:01:11.610> it<00:01:12.479> means<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:12.869> be<00:01:12.960> covered<00:01:13.260> as

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
the biofilter it means to be covered as

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.200 
the biofilter it means to be covered as
well<00:01:13.530> as<00:01:13.740> does<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.250> sump<00:01:14.520> I'll<00:01:14.820> just<00:01:15.030> show<00:01:15.180> you

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
well as does the sump I'll just show you

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.450 
well as does the sump I'll just show you
why<00:01:15.479> as<00:01:16.259> you<00:01:16.500> can<00:01:16.680> see<00:01:16.860> we've<00:01:17.040> got<00:01:17.100> a<00:01:17.159> 90

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
why as you can see we've got a 90

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.800 
why as you can see we've got a 90
percent<00:01:17.549> shake<00:01:17.909> off<00:01:18.150> there<00:01:18.330> so<00:01:18.479> it's<00:01:18.600> cutting

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
percent shake off there so it's cutting

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.690 
percent shake off there so it's cutting
out<00:01:18.900> a<00:01:18.930> lot<00:01:18.990> of<00:01:19.140> light<00:01:19.439> but<00:01:19.770> some<00:01:20.100> still<00:01:20.400> coming

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
out a lot of light but some still coming

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.300 
out a lot of light but some still coming
over<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.970> other<00:01:21.090> side<00:01:21.770> see<00:01:22.770> through<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.070> side

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
over the other side see through the side

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.010 
over the other side see through the side
here<00:01:23.610> a<00:01:23.640> lot<00:01:23.909> of<00:01:24.000> lights<00:01:24.210> still<00:01:24.570> making<00:01:24.930> it

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.460 
here a lot of lights still making it
through<00:01:25.290> so<00:01:26.119> yeah<00:01:27.119> what's<00:01:27.930> happening<00:01:28.320> is

someone's getting through and even

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.179 
someone's getting through and even
though<00:01:30.479> it's<00:01:30.720> not<00:01:30.900> in<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.110> fish<00:01:31.290> tanks<00:01:31.680> it's

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
though it's not in the fish tanks it's

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.580 
though it's not in the fish tanks it's
allowing<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.820> our<00:01:33.299> beautifully<00:01:34.020> synthesized

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
allowing the our beautifully synthesized

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.950 
allowing the our beautifully synthesized
in<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:34.860> water<00:01:35.100> in<00:01:35.340> here<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:35.820> yeah<00:01:36.689> basically

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
in the water in here and yeah basically

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.109 
in the water in here and yeah basically
muck<00:01:37.439> up<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.740> whole<00:01:37.890> system<00:01:38.130> so<00:01:38.820> as<00:01:38.880> you<00:01:39.000> can

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
muck up the whole system so as you can

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.420 
muck up the whole system so as you can
see<00:01:39.270> there's<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.659> muck<00:01:39.840> line<00:01:40.110> I'd<00:01:40.829> ran<00:01:41.220> the

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
see there's the muck line I'd ran the

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.460 
see there's the muck line I'd ran the
five<00:01:42.060> filters<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.630> circle<00:01:42.960> filter<00:01:43.259> and<00:01:43.380> it's

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
five filters a circle filter and it's

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.810 
five filters a circle filter and it's
cleaned<00:01:43.710> up<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:43.950> water<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.280> little<00:01:44.399> bit<00:01:44.520> it's

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
cleaned up the water a little bit it's

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.450 
cleaned up the water a little bit it's
still<00:01:44.880> not<00:01:45.180> as<00:01:45.299> much<00:01:45.450> as<00:01:45.600> I'd<00:01:45.720> like<00:01:45.899> it<00:01:45.930> so

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
still not as much as I'd like it so

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.670 
still not as much as I'd like it so
hopefully<00:01:47.600> that<00:01:48.600> algae<00:01:49.049> will<00:01:49.229> be<00:01:49.350> a<00:01:49.380> thing<00:01:49.619> of

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
hopefully that algae will be a thing of

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.170 
hopefully that algae will be a thing of
the<00:01:49.740> past<00:01:49.829> as<00:01:50.280> soon<00:01:50.460> as<00:01:50.549> I<00:01:50.640> left<00:01:50.850> all<00:01:51.000> these

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
the past as soon as I left all these

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.749 
the past as soon as I left all these
things<00:01:51.450> up<00:01:51.689> so<00:01:51.990> so<00:01:52.740> there<00:01:52.920> you<00:01:53.009> go<00:01:53.189> guys<00:01:53.369> just<00:01:53.670> a

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
things up so so there you go guys just a

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.130 
things up so so there you go guys just a
little<00:01:53.970> bit<00:01:54.060> of<00:01:54.119> a<00:01:54.180> cautionary<00:01:54.600> tale<00:01:54.689> when

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
little bit of a cautionary tale when

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.709 
little bit of a cautionary tale when
you're<00:01:55.259> doing<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.590> DIY<00:01:56.100> job<00:01:56.430> ease<00:01:56.549> it<00:01:57.030> pays<00:01:57.479> to

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
you're doing the DIY job ease it pays to

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.359 
you're doing the DIY job ease it pays to
just<00:01:57.930> check<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.290> thought<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.770> light<00:01:58.979> levels

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
just check the thought the light levels

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:00.679 
just check the thought the light levels
you're<00:01:59.520> going<00:01:59.549> to<00:01:59.729> get<00:01:59.850> inside<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.329> filters

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
you're going to get inside the filters

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.480 
you're going to get inside the filters
and<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:00.899> fish<00:02:01.049> tanks<00:02:01.380> or<00:02:01.829> you<00:02:02.070> could<00:02:02.250> end<00:02:02.369> up

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
and the fish tanks or you could end up

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.160 
and the fish tanks or you could end up
with<00:02:02.549> an<00:02:02.790> algal<00:02:03.090> bloom<00:02:03.299> I<00:02:03.509> mean<00:02:03.689> come<00:02:03.899> summer

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
with an algal bloom I mean come summer

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.870 
with an algal bloom I mean come summer
when<00:02:04.530> we<00:02:04.680> kept<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:04.979> full-on<00:02:05.310> Sun<00:02:05.579> on<00:02:05.729> this

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
when we kept the full-on Sun on this

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.589 
when we kept the full-on Sun on this
thing<00:02:06.200> yeah<00:02:07.200> it<00:02:07.500> would<00:02:07.729> basically<00:02:08.729> just<00:02:09.450> go

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
thing yeah it would basically just go

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:10.999 
thing yeah it would basically just go
out<00:02:09.750> of<00:02:09.899> control<00:02:09.929> I<00:02:10.229> think<00:02:10.349> so

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
out of control I think so

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.839 
out of control I think so
from<00:02:11.430> nip<00:02:11.610> it<00:02:11.700> in<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:11.849> butt<00:02:12.060> now

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:12.849 
from nip it in the butt now

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:15.240 
from nip it in the butt now
still<00:02:13.239> looking<00:02:13.599> might<00:02:14.409> add<00:02:14.590> some<00:02:14.980> other

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
still looking might add some other

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.920 
still looking might add some other
filtration<00:02:15.700> on<00:02:16.090> in<00:02:16.209> the<00:02:16.299> future<00:02:16.629> whether<00:02:16.810> it

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
filtration on in the future whether it

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.050 
filtration on in the future whether it
be<00:02:17.019> a<00:02:17.109> living<00:02:17.530> grow<00:02:18.099> bed<00:02:18.310> turn<00:02:18.609> it<00:02:18.730> into<00:02:18.879> an

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
be a living grow bed turn it into an

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.910 
be a living grow bed turn it into an
aquaponics<00:02:19.569> system<00:02:19.599> or<00:02:20.409> whether<00:02:20.709> it's<00:02:20.890> just

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
aquaponics system or whether it's just

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.470 
aquaponics system or whether it's just
going<00:02:21.189> to<00:02:21.250> be<00:02:21.340> some<00:02:21.579> sort<00:02:21.790> of<00:02:21.819> a<00:02:21.939> fine<00:02:22.209> mesh

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
going to be some sort of a fine mesh

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.080 
going to be some sort of a fine mesh
filter<00:02:22.900> we'll<00:02:23.140> just<00:02:23.290> wait<00:02:23.439> and<00:02:23.469> see<00:02:23.939> see<00:02:24.939> what

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
filter we'll just wait and see see what

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.670 
filter we'll just wait and see see what
happens<00:02:25.390> just<00:02:25.480> by<00:02:25.810> blocking<00:02:26.200> out<00:02:26.260> the<00:02:26.379> Sun<00:02:26.560> to

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
happens just by blocking out the Sun to

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.009 
happens just by blocking out the Sun to
begin<00:02:26.920> with<00:02:27.069> so<00:02:27.390> there<00:02:28.390> you<00:02:28.540> go

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
begin with so there you go

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:32.339 
begin with so there you go
also<00:02:29.590> to<00:02:29.650> Steven<00:02:30.599> Steven<00:02:31.599> asked<00:02:31.959> about<00:02:32.079> having

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:32.349 
also to Steven Steven asked about having

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:34.649 
also to Steven Steven asked about having
a<00:02:32.409> look<00:02:32.560> at<00:02:32.680> the<00:02:32.769> fish<00:02:32.980> in<00:02:33.609> here<00:02:33.819> so<00:02:34.180> that

00:02:34.649 --> 00:02:34.659 
a look at the fish in here so that

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:36.300 
a look at the fish in here so that
they're<00:02:34.959> actually<00:02:35.260> intended<00:02:35.950> for<00:02:36.189> the

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
they're actually intended for the

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.369 
they're actually intended for the
aquaponic<00:02:37.150> setup<00:02:37.299> that's<00:02:37.629> behind<00:02:37.989> the<00:02:38.230> system

00:02:38.369 --> 00:02:38.379 
aquaponic setup that's behind the system

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:40.619 
aquaponic setup that's behind the system
there<00:02:38.709> so<00:02:39.250> I'll<00:02:39.730> give<00:02:40.060> you<00:02:40.090> a<00:02:40.209> bit<00:02:40.329> of<00:02:40.420> a<00:02:40.480> look

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:42.129 
at feeding some of the silvers and the

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:43.949 
at feeding some of the silvers and the
Jade<00:02:42.310> perch<00:02:42.519> in<00:02:42.700> there<00:02:42.849> as<00:02:42.939> well<00:02:43.090> just<00:02:43.719> at<00:02:43.870> the

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
Jade perch in there as well just at the

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.020 
Jade perch in there as well just at the
end<00:02:44.079> of<00:02:44.200> this<00:02:44.290> so<00:02:44.700> if<00:02:45.700> you've<00:02:45.879> got<00:02:45.970> any

coming out but this is the Jade perch
feeding<00:02:59.950> there<00:03:00.159> Steven<00:03:02.639> I<00:03:04.169> tend<00:03:05.169> to<00:03:05.200> go<00:03:05.379> for

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
feeding there Steven I tend to go for

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.460 
feeding there Steven I tend to go for
the<00:03:05.620> bits<00:03:05.799> of<00:03:05.980> sink<00:03:06.280> first<00:03:06.989> then<00:03:07.989> later<00:03:08.260> they

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
the bits of sink first then later they

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.890 
the bits of sink first then later they
come<00:03:08.650> along<00:03:08.950> and<00:03:09.239> finish<00:03:10.239> off<00:03:10.419> the<00:03:10.569> ones<00:03:10.720> on

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
come along and finish off the ones on

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.129 
come along and finish off the ones on
top<00:03:11.849> so<00:03:12.849> they<00:03:13.120> definitely<00:03:13.389> put<00:03:13.720> on<00:03:13.840> a<00:03:13.900> nice

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:14.139 
top so they definitely put on a nice

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:16.259 
top so they definitely put on a nice
blue<00:03:14.349> the<00:03:14.470> size<00:03:14.680> since<00:03:14.980> we're<00:03:15.189> thumbs<00:03:15.430> since

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
blue the size since we're thumbs since

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:18.659 
blue the size since we're thumbs since
we've<00:03:16.450> had<00:03:16.599> them<00:03:16.840> so<00:03:17.079> I'll<00:03:18.069> try<00:03:18.340> and<00:03:18.370> show<00:03:18.489> you

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:18.669 
we've had them so I'll try and show you

00:03:18.669 --> 00:03:20.309 
we've had them so I'll try and show you
the<00:03:18.849> silvers<00:03:19.269> feeding<00:03:19.659> but<00:03:19.810> they<00:03:19.989> tend<00:03:20.290> to

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:20.319 
the silvers feeding but they tend to

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:21.809 
the silvers feeding but they tend to
wait<00:03:20.530> until<00:03:20.769> the<00:03:20.859> pellets<00:03:21.220> sink<00:03:21.489> and<00:03:21.699> it's<00:03:21.790> a

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:21.819 
wait until the pellets sink and it's a

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:25.259 
wait until the pellets sink and it's a
bit<00:03:21.970> harder<00:03:22.269> to<00:03:22.299> film<00:03:22.599> those<00:03:22.750> guys<00:03:22.989> so<00:03:24.120> back<00:03:25.120> in

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
bit harder to film those guys so back in

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:27.479 
bit harder to film those guys so back in
the<00:03:25.359> tick<00:03:25.739> so<00:03:26.739> I've<00:03:26.829> just<00:03:26.889> popped<00:03:27.220> some

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
the tick so I've just popped some

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:29.520 
the tick so I've just popped some
cleaning<00:03:27.879> for<00:03:28.060> the<00:03:28.090> silvers<00:03:28.569> but<00:03:28.840> you<00:03:29.379> know

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
cleaning for the silvers but you know

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.119 
cleaning for the silvers but you know
mate<00:03:29.799> they<00:03:29.979> feed<00:03:30.250> down<00:03:30.430> the<00:03:30.579> bottom<00:03:30.879> so<00:03:32.129> it's

00:03:33.119 --> 00:03:33.129 
mate they feed down the bottom so it's

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:34.890 
mate they feed down the bottom so it's
pretty<00:03:33.250> much<00:03:33.370> we'll<00:03:33.639> wait<00:03:33.819> for<00:03:34.030> the<00:03:34.180> pellets

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
pretty much we'll wait for the pellets

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.659 
pretty much we'll wait for the pellets
to<00:03:34.989> hit<00:03:35.229> the<00:03:35.379> base<00:03:35.560> and<00:03:35.919> then<00:03:36.129> they<00:03:36.280> have<00:03:36.400> a<00:03:36.430> go

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:36.669 
to hit the base and then they have a go

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:39.449 
to hit the base and then they have a go
at<00:03:36.790> them<00:03:36.970> so<00:03:37.919> hope<00:03:38.919> you<00:03:39.010> don't<00:03:39.159> like<00:03:39.310> me

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
at them so hope you don't like me

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:41.039 
at them so hope you don't like me

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:41.049 
zooming around on top of they're a bit

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:44.580 
zooming around on top of they're a bit
hard<00:03:41.229> to<00:03:41.290> see<00:03:42.269> so<00:03:43.269> these<00:03:43.419> are<00:03:43.599> the<00:03:43.659> ones<00:03:43.840> 25<00:03:44.440> of

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
these gained well into the system and

these gained well into the system and
