00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:57.309 
short periods of time but they were

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:01.229 
short periods of time but they were
random<00:00:58.059> outcomes<00:00:58.600> and<00:00:58.930> they<00:00:59.800> seldom<00:01:00.309> repeated

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:01.239

true signs of a gambling type investment
also<00:01:10.509> with<00:01:11.140> 10<00:01:11.649> million<00:01:12.280> people<00:01:12.569> trading<00:01:13.569> in

collecting all of their information and

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:21.630 
collecting all of their information and
embedding<00:01:19.450> that<00:01:19.630> information<00:01:20.350> into<00:01:20.619> a<00:01:21.130> price

embedding that information into a price

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.730 
embedding that information into a price
is<00:01:22.200> a<00:01:23.200> process<00:01:23.619> which<00:01:24.310> sets<00:01:24.940> prices<00:01:25.420> in<00:01:25.929> a<00:01:26.530> way

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
is a process which sets prices in a way

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.130 
is a process which sets prices in a way
that<00:01:27.069> they<00:01:27.280> are<00:01:27.369> actually<00:01:27.610> the<00:01:28.030> best<00:01:28.330> estimate

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
that they are actually the best estimate

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.620 
that they are actually the best estimate
of<00:01:29.259> the<00:01:29.890> value<00:01:30.130> of<00:01:30.520> an<00:01:30.670> investment<00:01:30.819> at<00:01:31.390> all

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
of the value of an investment at all

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.800 
of the value of an investment at all
time<00:01:31.990> and<00:01:32.380> what<00:01:33.220> that<00:01:33.399> does<00:01:33.670> is<00:01:33.729> it<00:01:34.119> sets<00:01:34.660> the

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
time and what that does is it sets the

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.949 
time and what that does is it sets the
odds<00:01:35.140> in<00:01:35.649> the<00:01:35.770> future<00:01:36.250> is<00:01:36.490> being<00:01:37.240> equally

00:01:37.949 --> 00:01:37.959 
odds in the future is being equally

00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:40.469 
odds in the future is being equally
likely<00:01:38.349> than<00:01:38.920> an<00:01:39.099> investment<00:01:39.610> will<00:01:39.759> go<00:01:39.910> up<00:01:40.149> or

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
likely than an investment will go up or

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:44.400 
likely than an investment will go up or
down<00:01:41.130> around<00:01:42.130> the<00:01:42.759> fair<00:01:43.149> return<00:01:43.599> given<00:01:44.289> the

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:44.410 
down around the fair return given the

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:48.449 
down around the fair return given the
risk<00:01:44.849> so<00:01:45.849> because<00:01:46.270> you<00:01:46.450> have<00:01:46.660> a<00:01:47.160> 50-50<00:01:48.160> wager

00:01:48.449 --> 00:01:48.459 
risk so because you have a 50-50 wager

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:52.440 
risk so because you have a 50-50 wager
for<00:01:49.300> investors<00:01:50.020> they're<00:01:50.890> constantly<00:01:51.670> put<00:01:52.179> in

for investors they're constantly put in
this<00:01:52.989> emotional<00:01:53.830> rollercoaster<00:01:54.220> of

sometimes doing good and sometimes doing
bad<00:01:58.149> and<00:01:58.800> also<00:01:59.800> wanting<00:02:00.190> to<00:02:00.310> chase<00:02:00.700> what<00:02:01.420> was

00:02:01.589 --> 00:02:01.599 
bad and also wanting to chase what was

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:04.260 
bad and also wanting to chase what was
good<00:02:01.869> in<00:02:02.020> the<00:02:02.140> past<00:02:02.410> thinking<00:02:03.399> it<00:02:03.580> will<00:02:03.789> repeat

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
good in the past thinking it will repeat

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.330 
good in the past thinking it will repeat
in<00:02:04.479> the<00:02:04.569> future<00:02:04.929> when<00:02:05.470> in<00:02:05.619> fact<00:02:05.649> that's<00:02:06.039> not

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
in the future when in fact that's not

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.140 
in the future when in fact that's not
the<00:02:06.520> case

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
the case

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:12.190 
the case
so<00:02:08.150> to<00:02:08.630> put<00:02:08.900> together<00:02:09.320> a<00:02:09.590> good<00:02:10.040> outline<00:02:10.790> of<00:02:11.240> the

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
so to put together a good outline of the

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.980 
so to put together a good outline of the
education<00:02:13.100> that<00:02:13.280> investors<00:02:13.850> really<00:02:14.240> need<00:02:14.660> I

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
education that investors really need I

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.330 
education that investors really need I
came<00:02:15.740> up<00:02:15.920> with<00:02:16.130> this<00:02:16.280> idea<00:02:16.520> of<00:02:17.030> the<00:02:17.240> 12<00:02:17.570> steps

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
came up with this idea of the 12 steps

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.870 
came up with this idea of the 12 steps
in<00:02:19.340> the<00:02:19.940> 12<00:02:20.210> steps<00:02:20.570> we<00:02:21.290> first<00:02:21.680> do<00:02:22.280> a<00:02:22.310> quick

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
in the 12 steps we first do a quick

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.270 
in the 12 steps we first do a quick
analysis<00:02:23.570> to<00:02:23.840> see<00:02:23.870> if<00:02:24.080> in<00:02:24.410> fact<00:02:24.650> you<00:02:24.890> are<00:02:25.070> an

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
analysis to see if in fact you are an

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.120 
analysis to see if in fact you are an
active<00:02:25.610> investor<00:02:26.150> then<00:02:27.020> we<00:02:27.320> remind<00:02:27.830> investors

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
active investor then we remind investors

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.870 
active investor then we remind investors
of<00:02:28.940> what<00:02:29.540> I'll<00:02:29.660> call<00:02:29.690> the<00:02:30.140> higher<00:02:30.410> power<00:02:30.890> for

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
of what I'll call the higher power for

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.030 
of what I'll call the higher power for
their<00:02:32.150> education<00:02:32.360> and<00:02:33.050> that's<00:02:33.410> basically

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
their education and that's basically

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.700 
their education and that's basically
academics<00:02:34.970> and<00:02:35.180> in<00:02:35.420> particular<00:02:36.080> those

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:36.710

their<00:02:40.460> work<00:02:41.170> then<00:02:42.170> we<00:02:42.410> dismantle<00:02:43.420> four

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
their work then we dismantle four

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.660 
their work then we dismantle four

going to be the next style winner or

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.160 
going to be the next style winner or
what<00:03:07.760> you<00:03:07.880> might<00:03:08.030> call<00:03:08.270> the<00:03:08.450> next<00:03:08.720> index
