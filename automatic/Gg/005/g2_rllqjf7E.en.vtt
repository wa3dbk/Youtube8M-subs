 hi guys and welcome to this new one 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.470
 video 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:10.830
 it had been so long since I spoke of that which is yes 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.390
 of the kentucky fried chicken with the famous 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.130
 makes it south that everyone 

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:16.950
 most have known thanks 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:20.820
 to me and my videos on the road though 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:24.000
 few know that there is a very good solution 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.100
 similar to kentucky fried chicken that 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.490
 you can find in england and i think 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:31.470
 also definitely also in America or in 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.870
 Australia to raise very difficult 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.610
 I 've never seen these before 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.980
 products 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:40.560
 I get a cheaper solution or more 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:44.100
 what else cleaner to do at home with 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:47.660
 the chicken or the bully 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.340
 in the style of Kentucky fried chicken e 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.410
 there are some products 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.350
 here they sell will not show recipe 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.750
 original even if it remains between us 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.030
 only original secret recipe 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.370
 because maybe you're the day I'll do it 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.729

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.829

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:13.409
 secret ingredients of chelsea 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.630

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.939
 strong point will be the original returns 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.209

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.619

 I hope you enjoy video and nothing 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:15.740
 let's start cooking 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:19.419
 here they are in the Mammamia dish 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:19.419
 We tasted immediately in 1 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:30.820
 and here we are immediately tasting this 

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:33.360
 delicacy come out here I don't know if yes 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:33.360
 can see 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:41.620
 nice eh and now tasting them immediately 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:50.919
 one quite crunchy as they do it 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:52.330
 gone lost here came good though 

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:53.710
 rightly it is also not that of the 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:57.310
 pieces 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:58.600
 however, it is very acceptable 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:00.400
 they are usually eaten with mayonnaise 

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:04.350
 I eat some sauces so own 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:04.350
 because I do n't want mayonnaise sauces 

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:14.290
 the emperor is well done but in reality 

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:18.880
 they are not so hard salty then one 

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:21.610
 very good for you 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:22.990
 detached chicken style which is yes that 

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:26.620
 they come here to England 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:29.169
 I suggest one hundred percent and al 

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:33.100
 next video we will see instead how it is 

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:35.140

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:37.570
 of those just those are from pepsi 

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:40.150
 that's taken by you guys 

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:41.680
 so the taste of the same I will 

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:44.350
 I suggest to see the next video 

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:47.410

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:50.400
