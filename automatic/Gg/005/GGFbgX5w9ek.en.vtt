00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
things like that so that you don't have

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.790 
things like that so that you don't have
to<00:04:25.250> redo<00:04:25.580> that<00:04:25.730> each<00:04:25.910> time<00:04:26.150> and<00:04:26.780> then<00:04:27.410> just<00:04:27.680> hit

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
to redo that each time and then just hit

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.140 
to redo that each time and then just hit
insert<00:04:28.370> into<00:04:30.010> post<00:04:31.010> so<00:04:31.580> what<00:04:31.700> it<00:04:31.790> does<00:04:31.880> is<00:04:32.030> it

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
insert into post so what it does is it

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.409 
insert into post so what it does is it
puts<00:04:32.300> a<00:04:32.540> little<00:04:32.690> shortcode<00:04:33.880> identifying<00:04:34.880> the

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:35.419

player and identifying the media ID so

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:48.820 
player and identifying the media ID so
we<00:04:40.610> can<00:04:40.730> now<00:04:40.850> save<00:04:41.270> that<00:04:41.660> draft<00:04:46.840> and<00:04:47.840> we're

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
we can now save that draft and we're

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.350 
we can now save that draft and we're
just<00:04:48.950> going<00:04:49.130> to<00:04:49.160> wait<00:04:49.490> till<00:04:49.669> the<00:04:49.850> the

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
just going to wait till the the

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.010 
synchronization completes and then we'll

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:56.500 
synchronization completes and then we'll
test<00:04:52.190> the<00:04:52.340> video<00:04:54.550> okay<00:04:55.550> so<00:04:55.610> we're<00:04:55.910> back<00:04:56.120> and

uploaded there and you can see there's a

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:52.140 
uploaded there and you can see there's a
little<00:05:50.889> green<00:05:51.039> check<00:05:51.340> box<00:05:51.370> saying<00:05:51.880> that<00:05:52.030> it's

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:52.150 
little green check box saying that it's

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:55.050 
little green check box saying that it's
synced<00:05:52.419> again<00:05:53.050> this<00:05:53.199> is<00:05:53.380> from<00:05:53.530> the<00:05:53.710> PC<00:05:54.100> the<00:05:54.340> Mac

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:56.939 
synced again this is from the PC the Mac
would<00:05:55.270> be<00:05:55.389> very<00:05:55.630> similar<00:05:55.900> just<00:05:56.320> a<00:05:56.530> different

00:05:56.939 --> 00:05:56.949 
would be very similar just a different

would be very similar just a different
look<00:05:57.100> and<00:05:57.220> feel<00:05:57.430> and<00:05:57.639> then<00:05:58.210> if<00:05:58.330> we<00:05:58.419> go<00:05:58.570> to<00:05:58.600> our

00:05:58.830 --> 00:05:58.840 
look and feel and then if we go to our

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:07.860 
look and feel and then if we go to our
online<00:05:59.050> Dropbox<00:05:59.800> account<00:06:05.520> and<00:06:06.520> we<00:06:07.449> go<00:06:07.600> to<00:06:07.660> our
