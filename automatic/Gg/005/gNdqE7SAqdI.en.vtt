00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:12.059
 hello and welcome I am 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:17.279
 your jackson and I have now 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:20.010
 in front of me the lg two mini hlg loads in yes 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.619
 barcelona regularly to a bustour 1 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.000
 with a final tapas eat that 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.470
 is probably listening to you now 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.080
 a great luxury 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.880
 but you see I am not eating but me 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.430
 do this hens and video 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.350
 because I have the team in hand here 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.239
 And of course I want that too 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.550
 To show again in the basics is 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.260
 that actually that you are only small 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.530
 so small it is basically taken 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.899
 actually not there is a 4.7 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.780
 In spite of all this, the big display has a big size 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.030
 we have this small distance here 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.769
 we also already spread from the culprit 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.379
 know and that's it 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:57.209
 but still remained relatively small 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.319
 whole smartbook i pack it there too 

00:00:57.209 --> 00:01:00.690
 call 

00:00:58.319 --> 00:01:02.010
 htc so that it just in the 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.989
 Comparison sees the little one 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.390
 size comparison so you have already seen 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.430
 that is already much smaller 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.899
 yes, let's take a quick look 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.090
 from all sides 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:15.299
 we start as always up there we have 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.619
 so once a typical r sensor i 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.090
 take that out of the background 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.479
 out so that the camera is sharp 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.920
 puts the sensor he gives it so 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.289
 yes, the riem with what you do 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.070
 tv and hifi elements da infrared 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:27.659
 can control 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.640
 next to it we have a small opening 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.600
 for the microphone for the noise 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.970
 Suppression next to the 3.5 mm audio 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.070
 klinken 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.480
 and then we are already on the 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.650
 top by on the right side 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.990
 First of all, we do not see anything at all 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:43.030
 look at the profile now 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.990
 I have stayed relatively slim 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.000
 not ready right now 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.410
 rich but after then we have here 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.880
 I just have to go back downstairs 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:51.610
 see for yourself and I will almost say 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.520
 the speakers because vents 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:57.060
 will do the thing with a quad core for 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.940
 the networking does not need 400 yet 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.590
 in between we have the micro usb 2.0 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.480
 port and then we should be europeans 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.000
 by yes and then we have too 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:10.899
 Here again, no more no buttons 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.080
 nothing because you know this device 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:17.350
 has the function buttons back namely 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.540
 once where the 8 megapixel camera is 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:22.330
 below that is the volume 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.610
 button so loud power button also 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.650
 at the same time serves as led and the 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.030
 stay days stay a little bit more 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.330
 Get a look 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.070
 can 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.350
 right next to the camera we have too 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:34.570
 a led flash light and here when we are there 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:37.390
 now should press on it 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:39.000
 actually a led light makes 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.170
 but not a pity 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.790
 the battery is pretty much down synonymous 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.200
 I have to say I have the very short one 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.519
 it will probably stop 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.380
 not too long now 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:49.540
 but we get the most important here 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.400
 you can see it under you 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:55.090
 the lte logo that means that it is 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.410
 also a suitable device and there 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.019
 Let's take a look at the front page 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:01.209
 drinks at the top with the typical 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:02.530
 speakers for the phone calls with the 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:05.650
 usual sensors are behind it 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.730
 ask and a front camera of 1.3 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.989
 megapixel 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:12.790
 yes and then we make time for luring 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:14.560
 that works with the device too and how 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.420
 samsung us just now the bustour 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.720
 said in this bus namely form the 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:22.630
 devices presented should also attract attention 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.709
 all devices are subsequently executed 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.720
 and there is also a new one 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:27.370
 Function that does not just come 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.610
 that it is this standard feature that one 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.610
 so 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.480
 you get used to that first 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.950
 It's easy to find a club 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.080
 only on it expresses but there is one 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.989
 new feature this device has the 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.400
 is still good and still traveling 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:44.680
 The display is four parts 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.739
 divided and you can because a pattern 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.450
 For example, type in 1234 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:51.550
 will not go here now because of me 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.170
 themselves have not entered the 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:55.830
 device just unpacked but have one 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:58.660
 So interesting function that also they 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:00.519
 bring in the other devices after 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.069
 I would like to have the technical effect 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:06.910
 I just called us just now 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:09.760
 So a 47-inch qhd resolved 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:11.830
 display from the processor we have 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.319
 a snapdragon 400 quad core processor 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:18.669
 the clocked it to 12 a bit 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:23.560
 less than the big g2 and we have 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:25.180
 here a gigabyte ram and should be at 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.639
 the device here eight gigabytes 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.350
 but it will also have program memory 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:32.290
 give with 6 gb 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:34.570
 with 16 gigabytes apologize yes 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:37.120
 two things at the same time are not 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.979
 the met its strong memory management 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.979
 yes, you see, here's so good 

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:43.390
 how nothing is free that is the 8th 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:45.310
 gigabyte variant of his you will 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:46.780
 say what should I do with it that is 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:50.440
 but from yesterday 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:53.030
 but is beneficial, we here at 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:56.180
 the mini device 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:57.950
 the advantage that we have now I only 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:00.860
 quickly find the opening perhaps here 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:01.460
 in the usb that we remove the lid 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.450
 can 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:07.310
 and there is already the 2440th 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:09.140
 milliamps of strong battery and there 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:12.080
 we see, there comes then also 

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:15.650
 the sim card in and you can just 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:17.180
 also make an SD card where exactly 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:20.030
 that should be here now 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:23.390
 I suppose here you have it 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:26.390
 just said so in passing though 

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:28.780
 I trust that time, but here it is 

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:30.680
 also sd card that will be here now 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:32.450
 his demonstration 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.250
 that's why you can not put anything in there now 

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:36.190
 but you see that here in the 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:39.500
 sale trade there will be a sd card 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:41.270
 be clean and / or come 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.960
 sd card he is a good one so that i 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:43.520
 submit again 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.720
 this would have just gets up the 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:48.770
 hand got not even looked at 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:51.830
 but for you a hands on video 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:54.290
 By and large it was that 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:57.710
 from the principle you already know that 

00:05:54.290 --> 00:06:00.860
 all features so synonymous that that 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:02.270
 ltt 2 has this device also now 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:05.020
 first the Hochbauten battery out 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:05.020
 taken 

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:11.180
 next to the next to the operating system of 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:13.910
 android 4.4 what you are up to and 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:16.310
 which incidentally also in march for the g2 

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:19.600
 is to be delivered is located 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:21.920
 also a so-called easy ua the 

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:25.130
 So practically stand when you are 

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:29.150
 the device starts the first time then 

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:34.250
 you get a simplified one 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:36.350
 user interface the user it 

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:39.140
 should be able to open up faster 

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:41.630
 I try to find the device 

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:44.390
 just if I still here on the 

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:49.520
 fast just find where it makes sense 

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:50.420
 Homescreen might want that 

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:52.940
 but not too much here 

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:54.950
 especially since we still claim the weeks 

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:57.950
 have an interview appointment 

00:06:54.950 --> 00:07:00.470
 there we will do that again 

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:01.760
 I can not show sorry for myself 

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:04.580
 we do not think so now we have to 

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:06.500
 To stay believing this is what it is 

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:10.010
 then practically a relative one 

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:11.570
 simple user interface and that should 

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:14.090
 it was then first so far 

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:16.910
 this year with jackson from android tv with the 

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:18.950
 hd2 here live from barcelona from one 

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:21.820
 Tapas bar until then until the next 

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:24.640
 video this year magic cities 

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:26.290
 please do not forget our kidneys and it 

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:28.270
 maybe also on twitter google plus 

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:31.050
 or facebook to share with it 

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:31.050
 to have the food 

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:37.380
 to 

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:43.320
 to the ceiling of the healthy
