for me I think the environment of where
we<00:02:27.130> all<00:02:27.280> have<00:02:27.459> something<00:02:27.670> in<00:02:27.940> common

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
we all have something in common

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.470 
we all have something in common
as<00:02:28.570> opposed<00:02:28.930> to<00:02:29.020> a<00:02:29.140> university<00:02:29.890> when<00:02:30.490> people

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
as opposed to a university when people

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:32.910 
as opposed to a university when people
saw<00:02:31.959> what<00:02:32.260> we<00:02:32.380> go<00:02:32.530> in<00:02:32.620> different<00:02:32.740> directions

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
saw what we go in different directions

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.730 
saw what we go in different directions
here<00:02:33.700> everything<00:02:34.209> is<00:02:34.330> very<00:02:34.540> focused<00:02:35.320> and

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
here everything is very focused and

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.640 
here everything is very focused and
everybody<00:02:36.160> is<00:02:36.690> has<00:02:37.690> common<00:02:38.080> goals<00:02:38.350> common

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
everybody is has common goals common

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.310 
everybody is has common goals common
objectives<00:02:39.520> and<00:02:40.120> it's<00:02:40.330> useful<00:02:40.810> to<00:02:40.840> be<00:02:40.990> able<00:02:41.140> to

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
objectives and it's useful to be able to

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.560 
objectives and it's useful to be able to
be<00:02:41.530> in<00:02:41.620> an<00:02:41.709> environment<00:02:42.310> that<00:02:42.490> prepares<00:02:43.450> you

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
be in an environment that prepares you

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.470 
be in an environment that prepares you
for<00:02:43.690> the<00:02:44.590> professional<00:02:45.220> world<00:02:45.400> I<00:02:45.970> think<00:02:46.390> the

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
for the professional world I think the

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.180 
for the professional world I think the
way<00:02:46.690> it's<00:02:47.140> structured<00:02:47.470> is<00:02:47.680> really<00:02:47.890> different

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
way it's structured is really different

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.890 
way it's structured is really different
is<00:02:48.280> the<00:02:48.370> course<00:02:48.640> has<00:02:48.820> quite<00:02:49.090> I<00:02:49.300> quite<00:02:49.630> well

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
is the course has quite I quite well

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.199 
is the course has quite I quite well
quite<00:02:50.020> like<00:02:50.290> a<00:02:50.560> business<00:02:50.980> focus<00:02:51.580> as<00:02:51.760> well<00:02:51.940> it's

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
quite like a business focus as well it's

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:53.920 
quite like a business focus as well it's
just

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
just

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.240 
just
when<00:02:54.379> you're<00:02:54.470> going<00:02:54.560> I<00:02:54.680> mean<00:02:54.769> I<00:02:54.860> know<00:02:54.980> a<00:02:55.010> lot<00:02:55.220> of

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
when you're going I mean I know a lot of

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.420 
when you're going I mean I know a lot of
my<00:02:56.230> work<00:02:57.230> is<00:02:57.379> one<00:02:57.620> where<00:02:57.769> you<00:02:57.799> go<00:02:57.920> to<00:02:57.980> practice

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
my work is one where you go to practice

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.309 
my work is one where you go to practice
they<00:02:58.580> just<00:02:58.819> really<00:02:59.209> feel<00:02:59.420> like<00:02:59.450> the<00:02:59.690> stairs<00:03:00.049> to

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:00.319 
they just really feel like the stairs to

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:01.660 
they just really feel like the stairs to
a<00:03:00.349> sandwich<00:03:00.890> I<00:03:01.099> think<00:03:01.310> some<00:03:01.430> really<00:03:01.580> good

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
a sandwich I think some really good

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.589 
a sandwich I think some really good
leads<00:03:01.849> imagine<00:03:02.330> a<00:03:02.390> quiet<00:03:02.690> storm<00:03:02.989> is

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:04.599 
leads imagine a quiet storm is

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:06.759 
leads imagine a quiet storm is
hopefully<00:03:05.599> when<00:03:05.870> you<00:03:05.930> go<00:03:06.049> into<00:03:06.260> actual

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
hopefully when you go into actual

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:11.430 
hopefully when you go into actual
practice

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:17.550 

in<00:03:12.900> advance<00:03:13.900> which<00:03:14.080> I<00:03:14.230> think's<00:03:14.500> really<00:03:14.590> really
