00:00:00.479 --> 00:00:13.480
 benchmark and gaming tests with lg g3 s un 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:14.620
 greetings to all android followers 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.800
 live.it 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:20.350
 we are again in the company of lg g3 s 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:24.460
 for our focus on the benchmark and the 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:26.320
 gaming so let's go straight to unlock 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.900
 the g3 s 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:32.820
 and let's launch a full benchmark 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.820
 for our usual test 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.670
 ok we wait for the upload 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:39.309
 application 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.679
 ok head 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:45.010
 the test started we will meet again in 

00:00:41.679 --> 00:00:46.659
 a few minutes later here he is boys 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.999
 the and benchmark test with the whole is 

00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:52.260
 finished years to see the score of 

00:00:48.999 --> 00:00:58.389
 this g3 s a score that honestly 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:59.350
 will not remain in history or 17650 6 

00:00:58.389 --> 00:01:02.819
 points 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:06.460
 let's see the judgment site of 

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:08.530
 antutu which is goodwin are in the ranking 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:12.939
 in the average sum then nothing from 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:16.869
 nothing to say excessive to be reported 

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:20.200
 then I repeat 17650 6 points 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:22.180
 we go out close or more ahead you and 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.850
 we are going to launch our usual 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:31.079
 trigger game for our test 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:33.159
 gaming I approach as usual for 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:39.030
 review or better 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:39.030
 ok let's load the game 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:47.909
 ok let's turn up the volume with the placed keys 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:52.189
 behind and home headset ok let's go to 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.189
 launch our usual mission 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.210
 let's start let's play 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.930
 let's see some remigio 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:18.820
 I must say that it is certainly not the 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:23.680
 maximum of africa you can't 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:26.610
 commands one that lager some lag 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.610
 too much 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:38.820
 ok let's pass we apologize for a while 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:44.330
 volume otherwise the volume is propose it 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:47.160
 so I have to say that it's a little too ok 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:50.820
 so to say that it was good to remember 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:53.430
 briefly the hardware of this g3 s 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:57.380
 or a quad core 1.2 processor 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:03:00.930
 gigahertz and a gigabyte of memory 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:06.110
 tremor haram that we see if we succeed 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:09.300
 some verses here perfect ok go say that 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:12.930
 not playability 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:14.610
 it's not the maximum some lag 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:18.060
 now in this moment that I am 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:22.310
 only here in the battlefield do I have to 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:25.020
 to say that he recovered quite well but 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.460
 I must say that the very moments 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:29.790
 excited 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:33.300
 I did some work in the orient 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:36.690
 to prepare commands as game 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:42.360
 they were a little late polo in short I have to 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:43.460
 to say that here is extremely talkative 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.200
 they make you out 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:50.190
 I'm just 15 I thought I was a little 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:53.790
 later in the killing of the gods 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:57.150
 zombies with a little to escape a little 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:04:01.710
 beating slack 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:05.460
 ok affection and to do a little hoarding of 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:11.790
 ammunition because there are going to end or 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:15.230
 straight that never hurts on the ride ce 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.230
 I'm really a lot of them 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:22.250
 it is a refuge here if I don't want the 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.250
 level I finish ahead of time 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:34.980
 just the last armored one what 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:37.710
 I didn't want it done by 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:40.110
 guys been popping up his lap because 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:43.020
 I meant that it was really a bit 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:46.770
 difficult to play with this g3 s 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:49.800
 to say that I did n't have a great time 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:52.410
 I have to say a little a little too unfortunately 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.750
 jerkily, I expected it 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:57.060
 something better and honestly love me 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:59.250
 left me left a little bit 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.530
 unprepared, in short, I must say that it is 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:03.690
 been a while for a birth is that the 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:06.030
 true of triggers therefore anyway sum in 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:07.560
 benchmark score conclusions in the 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:09.750
 honestly a little low standard 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.910
 expecting something more experience 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:14.460
 gaming that this one also put 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:17.910
 it loses a little too much under tone 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:20.700
 however on the whole we say anyway 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:22.860
 you can safely play at 

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:24.690
 trigger or games we say with a 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.870
 very very heavy graphics are 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:31.950
 quite quietly clearly 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:35.280
 lowering the graphic level a little 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:36.930
 in the game you could was what you recommended 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:39.810
 anyway you have seen that however the 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:41.400
 game did not turn one hundred percent 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:43.800
 the first disc points to the benchmark 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:46.350
 benchmark score in the standard then 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:49.979
 for this focus on danny and the benchmark 

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:53.660
 with lg g3f it's all a greeting I decide for 

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:53.660
