00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.830
 This map from the program trend MEP 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.420
 thanks to which we can trace 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.220
 discussing the Olympiad in Sochi and 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.380
 talk with hashtag sochi 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.080
 here you can see what most often writes about it 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.030
 usa and northwest europe nice 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.509
 see high concentration and in the very 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.760
 sochi 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.510
 that means people take part 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.340
 in discussion 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.859
 by looking at the discussion card 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.170
 we can get an idea 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.880
 what people are writing and where exactly they are 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.039
 do this card here 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.050
 as you can see now about the problems 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.239
 Sochi speak much less than themselves 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.340
 olympic games and again pockets 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.100
 discussions we are watching great britain and 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.809
 north america canada and usa 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.700
 practically only there and we have 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.350
 some data graphics we 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.719
 can demonstrate using 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.850
 transmit programs we processed 10 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.410
 million tweets on this graph we 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.510
 see a message about sochi 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.550
 here they were when the Olympiad 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.620
 just opened is the highest point 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:00.510
 discussions then discussion went on 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:02.340
 recession and i skills other graphics will allow 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.199
 us to see what exactly people say about 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.479
 Sochi percentage 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.000
 whether they talk more about games or about 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.619
 problems sochi before you cities from where 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.689
 most tweets about sochi 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.640
 here you see london moscow and 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.040
 St. Petersburg along with my mastodon 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.130
 twitter hashtags when you look at the 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.530
 sochi 2014 takes 24 percent off 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.680
 total 10 percent together 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.259
 ranked sochi and olympiad 1 olympiad from 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.390
 three to five percent problem sochi 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.820
 three percent of the total number of conversations 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.500
 on these topics around the world and by the way often 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.299
 disputes begin when someone tries 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.880
 join criticism of the Olympiad 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.770
 let's look at these tweets we see 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.909
 that hashtag problems sochi absolutely 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.979
 lost its original meaning this 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.570
 west coast girl can't 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.180
 go to bed because of the Olympiad 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.070
 here really problems sochi still 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.219
 West Coast someone left their 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:02:00.329
 keys in the car 

00:01:55.219 --> 00:02:01.829
 and here sochi course for many 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.990
 West Coast residents 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.090
 watch the game sleep a lot 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.950
 problem because of the time difference is and 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.750
 others who claim to be talking 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.830
 about sochi problems caused by cultural 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.590
 misunderstanding and not 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.510
 Russian yannik go further those who follow 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.610
 For discussion on the Internet believes that 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.410
 many critics criticized sochi talk about 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.130
 ignorance and they desire to manifest 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.840
 understanding 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.910
 and here we can only sympathize 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.650
 the fact that some problems sochi 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.960
 in reality, they are problems 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.090
 Western media themselves we see a table 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.830
 medal standings in which the channel 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.530
 ABC unfortunately mixed up the flags 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.010
 USA Canada and the Netherlands, it can be 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.660
 understand 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.580
 people probably work in big 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.530
 tension in the editorial sports 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.290
 news is now probably all sewn up 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.570
 of course we go further this too 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.610
 problem sochi I do not know why but so 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.620
 less of tension in the newsroom 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.420
 go to the internet user with 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.160
 some kind of weird bolts in the table 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.530
 This, too, problems Sochi 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.330
 bolts in the table and this is probably the most 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.430
 interesting Austrian journalist 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.380
 working in Vienna posted a photo 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.720
 buildings which is in very bad 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.730
 condition he wrote what matters 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:10.709
 Media Center in Sochi is not at all so 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:13.080
 as they should have taken with him further and 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.940
 see that the channel immediately contacted him 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.350
 cnn who asked for permission 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.209
 use this photo 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:21.230
 the only problem is that the snapshot was 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:23.280
 Made in Vienna they in Sochi 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:26.000
 love is the king 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.000
 but from sochi
