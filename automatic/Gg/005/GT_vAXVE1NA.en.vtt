00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
again but the cool thing this is the one

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.680 
again but the cool thing this is the one
thing<00:02:21.710> I<00:02:21.800> do<00:02:21.860> like<00:02:22.210> so<00:02:23.210> you<00:02:23.300> can<00:02:23.450> have<00:02:23.540> your

stock one you can have the black and the

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.430 
stock one you can have the black and the
blue<00:02:25.730> and<00:02:26.420> others<00:02:26.600> are<00:02:26.690> different<00:02:27.140> variations

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
blue and others are different variations

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.400 
blue and others are different variations
of<00:02:27.680> color<00:02:27.950> again<00:02:28.220> so<00:02:29.210> we're<00:02:29.660> gonna<00:02:29.810> change<00:02:30.140> it

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
of color again so we're gonna change it

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.520 
of color again so we're gonna change it
to<00:02:30.710> set<00:02:31.430> this<00:02:31.520> one<00:02:31.700> here<00:02:32.000> so<00:02:32.750> I'm<00:02:32.840> a<00:02:32.900> guava<00:02:33.230> and

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
to set this one here so I'm a guava and

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.200 
to set this one here so I'm a guava and
guava<00:02:33.740> again<00:02:34.190> if<00:02:34.790> we're<00:02:34.880> going<00:02:35.000> to<00:02:35.090> the

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.210 
guava again if we're going to the

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.870 
guava again if we're going to the
message<00:02:35.510> in<00:02:35.690> it<00:02:35.930> will<00:02:36.200> look<00:02:36.350> like<00:02:36.380> this<00:02:36.850> now<00:02:37.850> I

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
message in it will look like this now I

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.150 
message in it will look like this now I
think<00:02:38.060> that's<00:02:38.330> a<00:02:38.570> pretty<00:02:38.930> cool<00:02:39.140> idea<00:02:39.200> so

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
think that's a pretty cool idea so

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.560 
think that's a pretty cool idea so
you've<00:02:40.250> probably<00:02:40.370> seen<00:02:40.610> in<00:02:40.790> my<00:02:40.850> galaxy<00:02:41.300> s3

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
you've probably seen in my galaxy s3

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.660 
you've probably seen in my galaxy s3
video<00:02:41.870> it's<00:02:42.560> a<00:02:42.590> very<00:02:42.800> very<00:02:43.010> similar<00:02:43.400> to<00:02:43.520> this

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
video it's a very very similar to this

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.360 
video it's a very very similar to this
so<00:02:43.910> it<00:02:44.660> was<00:02:44.780> going<00:02:44.930> to<00:02:44.990> go<00:02:45.080> back<00:02:45.260> into<00:02:45.470> it<00:02:45.620> go

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
so it was going to go back into it go

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.660 
so it was going to go back into it go
back<00:02:46.520> into<00:02:46.700> settings<00:02:46.940> back<00:02:47.930> into<00:02:48.170> general

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
back down to the colors and we can now

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.290 
back down to the colors and we can now
change<00:02:51.800> is<00:02:52.040> let's<00:02:52.280> say<00:02:52.430> we<00:02:52.550> want<00:02:52.760> this<00:02:53.000> black

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300

change is let's say we want this black
and<00:02:53.480> green<00:02:53.630> one<00:02:53.900> it's<00:02:54.440> like<00:02:54.560> I'm<00:02:54.740> once<00:02:54.890> again

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
and green one it's like I'm once again

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.070 
and green one it's like I'm once again
go<00:02:55.220> out<00:02:55.340> of<00:02:55.430> it<00:02:55.580> go<00:02:55.790> back<00:02:55.970> into<00:02:56.180> it<00:02:56.270> now<00:02:56.330> it's

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
go out of it go back into it now it's

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.170
