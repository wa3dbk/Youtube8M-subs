00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
has worked for me the best having jump

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.010 
has worked for me the best having jump
as<00:03:13.560> lb<00:03:14.489> is<00:03:14.730> really<00:03:15.090> important<00:03:15.510> because<00:03:15.630> all<00:03:15.989> of

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
as lb is really important because all of

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.050 
as lb is really important because all of
the<00:03:16.230> platforming<00:03:16.830> you<00:03:16.950> have<00:03:17.130> to<00:03:17.250> do<00:03:17.430> there's

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
the platforming you have to do there's

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.380 
the platforming you have to do there's
some<00:03:18.540> important<00:03:18.989> jumps<00:03:19.380> like<00:03:19.980> in<00:03:20.310> office<00:03:21.180> or

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
some important jumps like in office or

dust<00:03:21.810> to<00:03:22.260> some<00:03:22.680> shortcuts<00:03:23.100> to<00:03:23.190> take<00:03:23.459> that

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
dust to some shortcuts to take that

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.180 
dust to some shortcuts to take that
require<00:03:24.810> you<00:03:25.049> to<00:03:25.230> aim<00:03:25.410> your<00:03:25.680> jump<00:03:25.950> so<00:03:26.130> you

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
require you to aim your jump so you

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.590 
require you to aim your jump so you
don't<00:03:26.430> want<00:03:26.549> to<00:03:26.610> be<00:03:26.670> taking<00:03:27.000> your<00:03:27.150> thumb<00:03:27.390> off

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
the right stick to jump when jump was a

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:33.920 
the right stick to jump when jump was a
so<00:03:30.750> jump<00:03:31.140> as<00:03:31.260> lb<00:03:32.280> will<00:03:32.910> allow<00:03:33.239> you<00:03:33.299> to<00:03:33.420> aim<00:03:33.690> your

jumps a lot better again the best

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.050
