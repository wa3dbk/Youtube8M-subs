and<00:01:05.350> then<00:01:06.350> usually<00:01:06.500> what<00:01:06.740> i<00:01:06.860> what<00:01:07.130> i<00:01:07.159> had<00:01:07.280> done

yesterday was that I'll lower it two
notches<00:01:09.350> and<00:01:09.920> then<00:01:10.460> I'll<00:01:10.549> go<00:01:10.670> around<00:01:11.320> the

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
notches and then I'll go around the

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.889 
notches and then I'll go around the
upper<00:01:12.560> sides<00:01:12.880> and<00:01:13.880> around<00:01:14.270> the<00:01:14.360> back<00:01:14.509> and<00:01:14.539> so

00:01:14.889 --> 00:01:14.899 
upper sides and around the back and so

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:16.389 
upper sides and around the back and so
basically<00:01:15.200> give<00:01:15.350> it<00:01:15.380> a<00:01:15.500> blended<00:01:15.860> look<00:01:15.979> again

00:01:16.389 --> 00:01:16.399 
basically give it a blended look again

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:18.249 
basically give it a blended look again
keep<00:01:16.670> notching<00:01:17.240> it<00:01:17.329> down<00:01:17.479> a<00:01:17.810> little<00:01:18.140> bit

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 
keep notching it down a little bit

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:20.440 
keep notching it down a little bit
further<00:01:18.590> and<00:01:18.890> so<00:01:19.340> the<00:01:19.579> shortest<00:01:19.880> portion<00:01:20.329> it

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
further and so the shortest portion it

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.590 
further and so the shortest portion it
is<00:01:20.830> lower<00:01:21.830> towards<00:01:22.220> my<00:01:22.369> towards<00:01:23.149> my<00:01:23.210> ears<00:01:23.450> in

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
is lower towards my towards my ears in

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.249 
is lower towards my towards my ears in
my<00:01:23.630> neck<00:01:23.869> line

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:24.259 
my neck line

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:26.919 
my neck line
and<00:01:24.460> then<00:01:25.460> up<00:01:25.580> higher<00:01:25.789> it's<00:01:26.090> it's<00:01:26.299> it's<00:01:26.630> again

00:01:26.919 --> 00:01:26.929 
and then up higher it's it's it's again

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:29.499 
and then up higher it's it's it's again
high<00:01:27.110> considerably<00:01:27.890> longer<00:01:28.159> hair<00:01:28.460> and<00:01:29.270> that's

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
high considerably longer hair and that's

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:32.639 
high considerably longer hair and that's

was<00:02:32.300> very<00:02:32.510> easy<00:02:32.780> and<00:02:33.110> convenient<00:02:35.200> so<00:02:36.200> I<00:02:36.230> think

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
was very easy and convenient so I think

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.630 
was very easy and convenient so I think
I<00:02:36.560> you<00:02:36.620> know<00:02:36.830> I<00:02:36.860> would<00:02:36.980> recommend<00:02:37.400> this<00:02:37.489> one

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
I you know I would recommend this one

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.759 
I you know I would recommend this one
this<00:02:37.790> was<00:02:37.940> actually<00:02:38.120> a<00:02:38.330> pretty<00:02:39.170> good<00:02:39.320> one

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
this was actually a pretty good one

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:41.830 
this was actually a pretty good one
you<00:02:40.130> know<00:02:40.190> the<00:02:40.310> feature<00:02:40.670> of<00:02:40.760> one<00:02:41.030> clip<00:02:41.330> versus

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
you know the feature of one clip versus

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.170 
you know the feature of one clip versus
having<00:02:42.200> ten<00:02:42.560> clips<00:02:42.860> that<00:02:43.580> makes<00:02:43.820> a<00:02:43.910> little<00:02:44.030> bit

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
having ten clips that makes a little bit

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.640 
having ten clips that makes a little bit
less<00:02:44.300> cluttering<00:02:44.690> so<00:02:44.930> it's<00:02:45.050> easier<00:02:45.290> to<00:02:45.320> store

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
less cluttering so it's easier to store

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.640 
less cluttering so it's easier to store
and<00:02:46.450> for<00:02:47.450> that<00:02:47.510> reason<00:02:47.570> when<00:02:48.080> the<00:02:48.170> cordless<00:02:48.410> if

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
and for that reason when the cordless if

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.440 
and for that reason when the cordless if
you're<00:02:48.800> in<00:02:48.920> for<00:02:49.610> cutting<00:02:49.850> your<00:02:49.910> own<00:02:50.000> hair<00:02:50.060> or

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
you're in for cutting your own hair or

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.900 
you're in for cutting your own hair or
trimming<00:02:50.750> up<00:02:50.959> between<00:02:51.440> your<00:02:51.680> cuts<00:02:51.920> this<00:02:52.580> is

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
trimming up between your cuts this is

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.280 
trimming up between your cuts this is
definitely<00:02:53.480> worth<00:02:53.840> it<00:02:54.019> so<00:02:54.680> again<00:02:54.830> this<00:02:54.950> is<00:02:55.130> the

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
definitely worth it so again this is the

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.500 
definitely worth it so again this is the
easy<00:02:57.290> to<00:02:57.410> clean<00:02:57.650> I<00:02:58.400> like<00:02:58.970> to<00:02:59.060> just<00:02:59.269> a<00:02:59.360> light
