that<00:00:21.810> background<00:00:22.050> arrays<00:00:22.560> or<00:00:22.590> two<00:00:23.330> now<00:00:24.330> let's

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
that background arrays or two now let's

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.480 
that background arrays or two now let's
try<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.779> magic<00:00:25.199> Ariz<00:00:25.470> or<00:00:25.619> two<00:00:25.830> let's<00:00:26.160> just<00:00:26.220> see

try the magic Ariz or two let's just see

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.640 
try the magic Ariz or two let's just see
if<00:00:26.519> we<00:00:26.699> can<00:00:26.849> raise<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.779> background<00:00:28.439> that's

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
if we can raise the background that's

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
effects should bring the opacity back up

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.140 
effects should bring the opacity back up
here<00:02:15.220> and<00:02:16.530> see<00:02:17.530> which<00:02:17.680> one<00:02:17.890> is<00:02:18.040> we've<00:02:18.250> got<00:02:18.490> yeah

better effect as if we just marriage

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.890 
better effect as if we just marriage
both<00:06:15.670> these<00:06:15.910> layers<00:06:16.300> together
