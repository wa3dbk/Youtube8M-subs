00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:18.160
 Four years ago he introduced a vehicle made in Argentina 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.439
 sudden suron 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:23.909
 If I'm not mistaken, it exceeded the expectations of this 21st century. 

00:00:23.909 --> 00:00:26.490
 commercial success the truth that yes in Sudan 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.089
 one side we incorporated in roughly the middle of 2006 

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:33.280
 and at that moment the segment where a surplus participates nor a peso 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.969
 specific within the days of the car industry of plus or minus 5% 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.850
 today that segment grew to 10% and over that 10% 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.690
 the south Andean 57 percent participation in sirte a little bit more 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.100
 Half of the cars sold in cement are like Sudan 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.270
 ideally by a hundred and we had not planned there is no doubt 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.270
 but somehow there will be 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.769
 flexible percent opt â€‹â€‹for a fax or in sports masaya in itself 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.730
 also by a denver after-sales maintenance service very much in line with 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:15.510
 the current demands is to say there is a set of things that make the 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:16.640
 eight products in 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.230
 are products that p have the success that we all hope 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.490
 The boss of the IMF is that it is much more than a conflict done his 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:35.530
 I can believe 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.890
 to be very honest with us we are turan in 2006 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.100
 of ap from there we did several market studies to melt the 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.330
 perception that the vehicle had at sea in the market 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.670
 insane if great satisfaction comes it was always very high always always a 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.220
 product has things to improve always no one perfect and shovel in 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.390
 the reception 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.990
 within the points is required 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.240
 the people now 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.580
 He also said that he claimed but yes he is 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.710
 he takes them as a point of attention in the interior they are delivered they consider it as 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.140
 a somewhat austere interest 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.859
 it is presumed that followed the global and inner trend 

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:13.469
 it was not like very well received by the client in particular the good of 

00:02:13.469 --> 00:02:18.299
 Argentina was really we organized a lot to go crazy inside though 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:19.979
 the file can see what 

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:22.089
 there is a complete renovation of both the 

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:24.399
 people like in the back 

00:02:24.399 --> 00:02:27.729
 p inside the very notorious change 

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:31.059
 'move into action' in a truly stunning world talent segment 

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.819
 higher 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.029
 we have a lot of tenacity after a lot of security 

00:02:35.029 --> 00:02:38.219
 certainly through a certain amount of elements that 

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:41.579
 only you want to be able 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:44.559
 which will have 100 vehicles of the highest range 

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:48.279
 as you know this intense week especially because the popular sensor of 

00:02:48.279 --> 00:02:49.499
 rain 

00:02:49.499 --> 00:02:53.639
 I basically good by very important stressed the issue of having a vision 

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:57.290
 very beautiful even though we are we is an automatic tradition for a 

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:00.299
 i on the other hand sequential 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:04.199
 in this type of segment they are shown as a client however we 

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:05.759
 we had the possibility 

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:09.479
 develop and present for the whole range what was which train I'm going to 

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:10.120
 sochaux 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.149
 and now there's more than this transmission 

00:03:12.149 --> 00:03:14.929
 that some form completes all this new 

00:03:14.929 --> 00:03:19.279
 p interior and exterior aesthetic change that you were in the novel ours 

00:03:19.279 --> 00:03:22.199
 I think that was what they said that a 

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:26.079
 I feel a satisfied client of those seven potentials within a 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:26.970
 satisfied 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.610
 that yes the message is not going to do is to say without any doubt or mode not only 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.200
 it's been more than two and a half years that we're working deeply 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.339
 only what are processes 

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:37.119
 of customer satisfaction 

00:03:37.119 --> 00:03:40.449
 we started to work very hard the renovation of all our 

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:42.860
 workshops selling rooms so that the end of the trail 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.300
 content not only with the purchase a zero vehicle and the version at the moment 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.109
 to be a maintenance service 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:51.059
 and then more than two years ago we are working 

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:54.079
 mendelssohn the pellegrini processes that in the way 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:56.940
 and how to serve the customer really presents 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.320
 was contained with the brand and not only was it appropriate at the time of 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.240
 village to realize some a purchase of a vehicle more emotion of a 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.630
 funny
