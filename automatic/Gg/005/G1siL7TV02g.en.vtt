00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.950
 [music] 

00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:06.899
 hello, so we continue 

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:10.590
 retouch photo and following 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:13.500
 stage we will make the skin more 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:17.480
 smooth will align 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:21.660
 skin tone for this we will create now 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:26.970
 copy of the layer for this we use the buttons 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:29.760
 on the speech of the control key, jay is turned off 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:33.230
 top layer and go to medium 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:42.200
 which we will work now now 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:42.200
 we select the filter and the blurys survey was 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:48.270
 but those installations that stand here by 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.510
 default principle suits us here 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.579
 see what effect has turned press 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.469
 ok 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:57.600
 but you do not think naturally we will not 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.160
 leave it here as there is as 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.329
 you know, it looks absolutely 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:05.880
 unnatural and what is present here 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:10.320
 such plastic unnatural 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:14.540
 effects so what we do next we 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:20.270
 turn on the top layer and turn 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:20.270
 Now select the eraser tool and 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:30.119
 we make opacity of plastic approximately 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:38.280
 let's get somewhere 16 percent of us 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:41.549
 arrange approximate for convenience we reduce 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:44.040
 brush size we edit as per your 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:47.220
 size as you wish, do not forget 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:53.899
 hot key brackets are square 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:57.479
 curly and slowly handle 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:02:01.009
 erase those places which like us 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.960
 skin seems uneven 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:07.630
 9 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.630
 too pronounced texture of the mountain and 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:19.489
 other disadvantages we want 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:26.569
 head so i will miss one 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:28.700
 speck now fixed so now 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:45.580
 back to the tag 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:46.750
 and so gradually over the whole body and 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.070
 plastic 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:54.280
 handle these places we wanted 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:54.280
 to iron and align 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:07.030
 [music] 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:53.379
 [music] 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:19.229
 and as you see 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:21.419
 skin has become much smoother and tone 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:24.449
 skin has become more even such a result 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:26.310
 we are satisfied therefore we have left 

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:29.870
 just now merge the layers for this 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:33.270
 use the hot keys of contra acne 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:35.220
 all if you have some not some 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.620
 misunderstandings about the hand there 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:40.919
 leave some questions in 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:43.130
