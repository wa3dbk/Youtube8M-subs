two hours almost on the dot when I use

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.539 
two hours almost on the dot when I use
this<00:01:56.270> it<00:01:57.270> takes<00:01:57.840> about<00:01:58.170> an<00:01:58.680> hour<00:01:58.710> to<00:01:59.189> an<00:01:59.219> hour

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
this it takes about an hour to an hour

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.149 
this it takes about an hour to an hour
and<00:01:59.790> a<00:01:59.820> half<00:02:00.060> more<00:02:00.869> so<00:02:01.170> two<00:02:01.229> hour<00:02:01.680> and<00:02:01.920> a<00:02:01.950> half

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
and a half more so two hour and a half

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.850 
and a half more so two hour and a half
but<00:02:03.000> nevertheless<00:02:03.360> it<00:02:03.780> does<00:02:03.990> speed<00:02:04.439> up<00:02:04.469> the

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
does come with a lightning cable so it

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.560 
does come with a lightning cable so it
will<00:02:53.070> work<00:02:53.459> straight<00:02:53.760> out<00:02:53.850> of<00:02:53.880> the<00:02:54.000> box<00:02:54.209> and<00:02:54.450> it

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
will work straight out of the box and it

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.990 
will work straight out of the box and it
is<00:02:54.690> a<00:02:54.750> decent<00:02:55.050> cable<00:02:55.590> so<00:02:56.010> it<00:02:56.250> should<00:02:56.550> give<00:02:56.820> you
