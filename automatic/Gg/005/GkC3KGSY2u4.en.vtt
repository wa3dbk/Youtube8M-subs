equals<00:01:54.780> a<00:01:54.930> right<00:01:55.170> winger<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:55.649> i<00:01:55.920> tend<00:01:56.189> to<00:01:56.340> go

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
equals a right winger and i tend to go

for<00:01:56.520> in<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.149> BBVA<00:01:57.630> I<00:01:58.079> like<00:01:58.469> my<00:01:58.619> demaria<00:01:59.100> or

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
for in the BBVA I like my demaria or

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.490 
for in the BBVA I like my demaria or
even<00:01:59.490> look<00:01:59.790> at<00:01:59.969> someone<00:02:00.270> like<00:02:00.299> Pedro<00:02:00.899> but<00:02:01.350> I

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
even look at someone like Pedro but I

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.139 
even look at someone like Pedro but I
should<00:02:01.740> have<00:02:01.860> considered<00:02:02.159> carlos<00:02:02.700> vela<00:02:02.850> he

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
should have considered carlos vela he

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.300 
should have considered carlos vela he
was<00:02:03.329> a<00:02:03.360> decent<00:02:03.659> option<00:02:04.229> and<00:02:04.439> someone<00:02:04.829> now<00:02:05.040> that

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
was a decent option and someone now that

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.800 
was a decent option and someone now that
I<00:02:05.340> realized<00:02:05.759> I<00:02:05.909> should<00:02:06.090> have<00:02:06.180> used<00:02:06.420> a<00:02:06.630> long

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
I realized I should have used a long

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.990 
I realized I should have used a long
time<00:02:07.110> ago<00:02:07.290> so<00:02:07.590> he<00:02:08.190> has<00:02:08.340> changed<00:02:08.640> his<00:02:08.789> position

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
time ago so he has changed his position

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.059 
time ago so he has changed his position
from<00:02:09.450> right<00:02:09.720> wing<00:02:09.899> to<00:02:10.050> stroke<00:02:10.259> as<00:02:10.530> I<00:02:10.709> mentioned

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
from right wing to stroke as I mentioned

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.350 
from right wing to stroke as I mentioned
previously<00:02:11.099> and<00:02:11.760> that<00:02:11.790> for<00:02:12.420> me<00:02:12.450> has<00:02:12.569> suited

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
previously and that for me has suited

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.060 
previously and that for me has suited
immensely<00:02:13.960> and<00:02:14.260> the<00:02:14.590> fact<00:02:14.800> that<00:02:14.890> i've

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
immensely and the fact that i've

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.220
