00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.629
 Toro Rosso that this demand 

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:10.249
 looks like 

00:00:10.249 --> 00:00:11.079
 Jannach 

00:00:11.079 --> 00:00:13.349
 Care laminates supplied raw materials for 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.189
 in petershagen-lahde Michael Schreiner could do something 

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:21.550
 stressed in his presentation 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.259
 what this tripod can do 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:26.259
 whose smarties built up 

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:31.339
 but come that the offender from the process 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.920
 we need you with it 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.210
 So that's Toko Post too 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.979
 the format tripod legs 

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:49.520
 tried as you can see here quite normally 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.260
 those around the feet and 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.870
 with that smile 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.810
 can you then accordingly 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.810
 Extend and extend the tripod 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.890
 so the whole thing is simply shown is also playful again 

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:07.469
 when we do our legs the first acts first 

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:10.340
 what they are here 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.840
 to be depressed tail light what have built up want to break down again 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.990
 We now need to be more active to focus on 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.990
 this communicated 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.480
 could not do that 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.660
 good simply reassemble Jasper Pischner bit felt 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.660
 Especially since we take over we have to go further back 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.860
 Press here at once 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.380
 together you want to note 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.270
 it's extremely small so keep it going is definitely he is in a row this is 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.970
 deep 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.630
 that it's possible nowadays 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.400
 Carvalho and Lampard 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.400
 steadily rebuilding in the near future 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.870
 most recently, the main focus has been indoor 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.870
 as normal as the head above 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.010
 Ball head so you go to the Grand Prix on the screw all the time 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.280
 fixed and steady is located at Caron once here and two each 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.720
 Gentner, on the other hand, makes it possible to do so here as well 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.720
 Camera stood still because that is 

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:19.439
 vertical the spicy 90 ° as normal and Thurk I want to go back 

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:23.669
 Pradaxa plate with safety systems quite normal about the passing knows 

00:02:23.669 --> 00:02:26.179
 to open 

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:31.039
 so take out the camera quite simply attach here 

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:32.869
 Tusk then back up 

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:35.579
 Zack while falling asleep high 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:37.289
 Biggs can happen 

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:40.749
 and of course you can the city of Idstein over head also corresponds 

00:02:40.749 --> 00:02:43.109
 the very other is found below 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:44.699
 Consolidate Pölten 

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:46.310
 emphasize and reference 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.579
 is not synonymous his Peter communicate 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:50.249
 for the extension 

00:02:50.249 --> 00:02:54.209
 Bull City IV Star in itself I have that the tiger she now her Prof Dr 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:55.399
 lowest level 

00:02:55.399 --> 00:02:56.789
 the pole 

00:02:56.789 --> 00:03:00.999
 Fasten up all the bands I'm about a meter 7 

00:03:00.999 --> 00:03:04.909
 80 the whole thing is not possible, we have a little bit of a fuss up to the big ones 

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:07.600
 for the whole now here completely 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.769
 on maximum end 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:13.629
 Challenger Thorsten Siehr sensitize then I am here 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:14.449
 on them 

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:16.219
 40 30 

00:03:16.219 --> 00:03:18.739
 the pack size about as wide 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:21.739
 taken off properly really big 

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:25.330
 they remember 71 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.559
 That's why BayernLB went up here for assembly 

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:32.900
 you give them this encrypted winning goal but impressive 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.169
 of course with this construction she missed but thought 

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:39.969
 that I sometimes see it deep as they actually are 1 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:43.629
 can build so that is practically like a spider 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:45.099
 standing on the ground 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:48.089
 Of course, there are still excavators to go with that I just here 

00:03:48.089 --> 00:03:52.129
 For example, one leg of Andy blazes around the back and down 

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:55.349
 create is domination something has to rebalance 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:58.639
 that's a great thing, especially since you have the opportunity of course 

00:03:58.639 --> 00:03:59.719
 over the head 

00:03:59.719 --> 00:04:01.059
 the woman reports 

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:04.019
 Of course then again the position of the camera 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:07.210
 set individually and of course here with the 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:09.079
 suddenly I was normal 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:10.659
 can go down 

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:13.139
 So that was Robert 

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:15.399
 that on Europe's smaller 

00:04:15.399 --> 00:04:18.859
 SPOX now go out together with 4 that this gene itself 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:20.989
 confessed to have deepened 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:23.479
 in the offender before that too 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:27.309
 this tripod has been Weißenbrunn says Baur 

00:04:28.029 --> 00:04:29.590
 Contact between 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:30.979
 Abbas 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:34.680
 Roughly speaking now also do not see that it is Spams simple tripod here 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.050
 can be assembled 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.050
 so 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:42.389
 the one compact 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:45.439
 really good quality processed 

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:49.229
 I think this is a tripod BASF so loose somehow on the main photo 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:50.680
 City can attach 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.550
 but very easy 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:54.620
 well processed 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.759
 Great is what is more and more
