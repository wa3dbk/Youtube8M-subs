I'm not real sure that Lane Lane choice
is<00:04:51.680> a<00:04:51.710> big<00:04:51.919> advantage<00:04:52.130> but<00:04:52.520> in<00:04:52.610> our<00:04:52.700> turning

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:53.389 
is a big advantage but in our turning

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:54.940 
is a big advantage but in our turning
forces<00:04:53.750> and<00:04:53.840> everything<00:04:53.900> it<00:04:54.560> doesn't<00:04:54.830> make<00:04:54.919> a

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:54.950 
forces and everything it doesn't make a

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:57.969 
forces and everything it doesn't make a
big<00:04:55.190> advantage<00:04:56.080> running<00:04:57.080> a<00:04:57.200> truck<00:04:57.680> where<00:04:57.860> he's

00:04:57.969 --> 00:04:57.979 
big advantage running a truck where he's

00:04:57.979 --> 00:04:59.680 
big advantage running a truck where he's
a<00:04:58.010> mid<00:04:58.280> he's<00:04:58.580> six<00:04:58.820> mid<00:04:59.030> feet<00:04:59.270> in<00:04:59.389> it<00:04:59.510> where<00:04:59.630> he

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
a mid he's six mid feet in it where he

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:01.090 
a mid he's six mid feet in it where he
can<00:04:59.840> see<00:04:59.990> out<00:05:00.139> of<00:05:00.169> both<00:05:00.350> sides<00:05:00.380> pretty<00:05:00.830> easy

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:02.469 
can see out of both sides pretty easy
and<00:05:01.580> I<00:05:01.639> don't<00:05:01.790> think<00:05:01.940> it<00:05:02.000> was<00:05:02.090> critical<00:05:02.360> for

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:02.479 
and I don't think it was critical for

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:04.690 
and I don't think it was critical for
him<00:05:02.750> if<00:05:02.870> some<00:05:03.200> of<00:05:03.260> the<00:05:03.320> other<00:05:03.410> drivers<00:05:03.830> how<00:05:04.639> do

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:04.700 
him if some of the other drivers how do
