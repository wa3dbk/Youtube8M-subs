00:00:06.809 --> 00:00:11.260
 hello youtube friends as they are today 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:13.930
 I bring you a new video tutorial that 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:16.990
 good is a trap with this the wagon 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:19.990
 and the rails is very good you can not see anything 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:22.630
 the truth is for me that undetectable 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.609
 as in this and normal good we press the 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:28.179
 button and we go with the rails 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:31.029
 detectors and in this this course we go up 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:33.509
 to the nothing good tutorial to be explained 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:33.509
 right now 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.449
 good for the tutorial is what 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.550
 you need and it 's very easy to do 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:44.250
 what they will not need is a go-ahead 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.130
 several sticky floors 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:50.100
 redstone a rail one more real 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:52.890
 detectors the king is normal israel is 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.170
 propelled a wagon obviously one 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.260
 more rockets of lava a dossier redstone 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.670
 and repeaters good so I'm going to go a 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.520
 good flat terrain something like that for 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:06.030
 wait a little while here and good 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:08.670
 I'm here now now, let's do 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:12.780
 the trampita that as I have here already 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:15.720
 my own little land what I'm going to 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.479
 do now is that as a way to 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.450
 that the wagon does not move as you see 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:24.420
 I can be good here, I have a button already 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.030
 that did not have a button but already today 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.860
 here I forgot this but well come on 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.860
 to remove this here and just in this 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.810
 we put another block 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.090
 and now we put the human magnetic and it 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.700
 keeps we put another what it does is 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.580
 angry and good I'm going to get off my little button 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.640
 with me silly to put here and good as 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:46.790
 come there the car is shot and 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.890
 here we are going to put rails like this normal and 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.390
 good and after a few there are 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.300
 see if we're going to be there when this one 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:56.090
 he is the slow going there with the trolley 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:58.430
 either it was already going a bit slow then 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:02.350
 let's add the propelled king and 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.350
 let's continue with more propelled 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.979
 does not say is the detector king sorry I 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:11.410
 we are not more normal propulsion are 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.240
 normal propelled and good hours now 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.940
 of good now 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.830
 now let's add everything I'm 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.310
 confusing a lot I do not know why good 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.840
 Now let's continue with this and we will 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.850
 take out our pistons and we're going to 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.330
 put a block of by means of our 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:30.400
 good of our rails good here I 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.360
 I'm going to put six you can put 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:36.120
 more than the length they want 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.770
 and well I left them there and here comes 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.300
 the part of the repeaters that we are going to 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.910
 put repeaters just behind the 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:45.630
 pistons all in four tics so that 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:48.950
 take a little bit like shrinking and 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.950
 let's communicate the correct ones 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.730
 let's remove this block 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:58.480
 and well we're going to go down here 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:01.569
 king propelled diego the detector I 'll 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:04.209
 download my shovel and right here below 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:06.910
 this king propeller let's make a 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:08.830
 I walk all to connect here just 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.200
 here then what we are going to do is put 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.930
 reston down as he is under the king 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.420
 of the detector let's put a block 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.519
 normal and a fair redstone torch 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:22.330
 behind the block 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:25.060
 well put stuck to the block like this now 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.860
 let's communicate the redstone and how he 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.200
 they would already be activated and the program 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:32.470
 happens and the wagon is already good they are going to 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:36.450
 deactivate and good is what we 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:38.129
 would miss to see this would cover it 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.290
 well there they cover it normal obviously 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:42.239

 leave in the description and good then 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:20.190
 since we finished filling in this no 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.470
 depending on how well you fill it so you do not 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:26.400
 see nothing and good since we finished 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:29.100
 fill in this let's try it nothing else 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.650
 I'm going to put it in third person for 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:33.900
 see if they know before me after 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:37.020
 it is well configured and how it was and 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.600
 would fall directly to the lava good this one 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.390
 I do not know what happened to me 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:43.409
 good on the side of what we would lack 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:47.550
 I would add the lava 

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:49.770
 and well I'm going to remove my trolley 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:52.950
 now let's add what would be the 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:56.520
 nava but before you have to be all this 

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:59.010
 and well I'm going down here to put 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:01.110
 the lava by the way you can not 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:03.300
 put the base but one more fall 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:06.660
 deep that is also indeed tomorrow 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:09.900
 today I will not be uploading a new 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:12.120
 video that is to put the second 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:15.870
 he has the wagon from here from afar 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:17.970
 from where about 20 blocks tall 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:19.620
 have the trolley drop and now that one 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:22.050
 get up is like dying but to the 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:24.030
 time of a fall as well as very girl or 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:26.490
 when the rails are cut there I am going to 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:28.590
 do today or tomorrow who knows so 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:30.780
 be attentive to leave if I do and 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:33.810
 I still have time for this to observe 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.980
 in the description and well I just wanted 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:36.620
 close it 

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:38.850
 here it would only be to close it 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:40.420
 we close this well so they do not look 

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:44.840
 to the mechanism 

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:48.139
 and well let's try it one more time 

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:49.820
 I put the cart apart the little button and 

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:51.970
 well I hope this video and up 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:51.970
 then 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:07.860
 ah 

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:10.950
 all right
