00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.460
 boys race times there may but the whole 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.690
 short comes t this comes this march in short 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.250
 I want to give some tips and tricks 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.359
 I am so short because we can do this 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.680
 him again very quickly 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.880
 I used the controls 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.650
 technology that really just really good 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.720
 usable is solo games but also 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.150
 just play your other games and here right away 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.650
 the start was lifted by b23 there i was 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.789
 me nobody could strictly lost 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.080
 You also just street that I already have one 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.910
 was busy for a while and then I thought about it 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.110
 beats game I also had a top moments 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.969
 his mother also sat through one 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.860
 blame yes but I cook you eat and you 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.239
 I am too late I am always there myself 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.350
 late at dinner time was ten 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.579
 minutes later and I'm used to it too 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.110
 back up in five minutes 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.219
 because I now eat so much because I like it 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.450
 Eat just doesn't like can 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.309
 dear greetings but that does not matter 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.510
 because I'm going off-topic again and it's coming 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.129
 only takes 3 minutes so I have to 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.600
 just quickly by dicks but as I have 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.340
 no more time but I want to 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.539
 just write some tips for solo game 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.129
 us but also just for normal game 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.870
 ever because you can use one 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.399
 controls technique is solo demos and 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.840
 for the person to think that yes 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.879
 you mean exactly with solo game 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.530
 with solar games I mean sweeter 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.030
 for you for all their game 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.170
 sticks and stones and home the cemal 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.030
 you are actually not dependent on that 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.380
 your team'm just depending on it 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.430
 of yourself you have to do everything yourself 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.390
 Also just don't have a team 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.040
 you are also a bit dependent again 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.689
 of yours because if you of course 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.400
 against and who only plays that run 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.420
 it campers against and who plays it 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.159
 just be very good of course 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.869
 also not get a good score but I can 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.549
 in this game ever use the 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.229
 checks technology and I do that here 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.040
 also have this game in 8 round gameplay arm 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.750
 block selected 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.240
 because I'm checking you a part of 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.650
 the man and I checked shared with that 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.210
 walls with that tractor and stand against 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.710
 her total control I again another 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.299
 part and then you just have to do this 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.040
 I play you can game on their game 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.240
 well not really use because can one goes 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.799
 actually there just because you have some fun 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.159
 can go into the game dick of week 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.960
 balls 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.100
 only i do n't like yourself just 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.689
 to go closed I love myself 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.130
 unusually the two always hear whatever I do 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.930
 just always do here i go on it 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.759
 moment oh towers and then go 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.110
 I get this point from him in check 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.520
 the only use that 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.869
 Checks technology will still be very much 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.159
 quickly explain what you should do so 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.689
 just need a certain portion of the 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.909
 mal check especially in free especially 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.890
 is a very handy tactic 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.390
 so check pals check wrong 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.920
 and just check that part where 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.869
 you walk you must be about two and three 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.700
 kind of have access to you 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.660
 controls in place that simply go 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.800
 can run 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.310
 one just have to take care of that and emmys 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.360
 hot it stay on you and on 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.860
 are that they no longer run towards you 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.180
 then you just can't do anything because you can 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.500
 of course don't make kills it's one 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.670
 little kempen maybe watch some 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.290
 people this is coming now 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.030
 yes actually if you make a point of the folder 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.530
 check then you actually kemp 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.000
 just but it is not kemp it is 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.380
 just check the spot 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.430
 and sometimes if you are not just good 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.270
 If you are a player then you just have to be there 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.950
 make use of 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.180
 you can be better there you can be a me 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.920
 by better and it is just one 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.480
 very handy tactics to deal with 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.830
 I would say test sometime 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.180
 you can also use it in tom and 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.410
 eat when you use it in 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.550
 you must be a pastor at school did it 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.959
 kind of flag 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.280
 dominate or should you just eat drones 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.410
 start to laugh at the attack 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.489
 to safe place in front kitchen you can now 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.470
 really use it then you should actually 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:49.060
 just walk into emmy's paul 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.530
 run around there and just hope you do 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.209
 can get a good score but the real ones are 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.739
 games so to use it there Nation 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.480
 and free from just certain part 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:56.590
 of the folder and use it 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.849
 tech sound once 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.170
 just let me know in the comments 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:00.610
 on this video or this tactic jack 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.650
 helped get a good one 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.880
 score in domination in frifole remains 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.260
 just check the man's point 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.030
 just as quickly eh saam I found 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.680
 actually a committee that is attacking us 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.730
 I was too short that it was short 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.650
 it's just a part of mab 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.060
 check so check and leave 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.440
 also just stop the enemy from running this 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.910
 was know comes for a moment or laugh like 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.650
 a very soon comes a use this 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.239
 tactic of the schweiz choir is 21 2 and 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.560
 thanks for watching give the video

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.910
