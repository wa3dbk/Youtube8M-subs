00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
they started locking and it was a

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.119 
they started locking and it was a
nightmare<00:03:31.450> to<00:03:31.690> take<00:03:32.049> them<00:03:32.290> down<00:03:32.319> because<00:03:32.799> they

00:03:33.119 --> 00:03:33.129 
nightmare to take them down because they

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:34.530 
nightmare to take them down because they
some<00:03:33.459> of<00:03:33.489> these<00:03:33.670> especially<00:03:34.030> around<00:03:34.269> the

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
some of these especially around the

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.569 
some of these especially around the
edges<00:03:34.720> started<00:03:35.260> locking<00:03:35.530> up<00:03:35.889> and<00:03:36.099> I<00:03:36.159> could<00:03:36.400> not

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:36.579 
edges started locking up and I could not

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:38.039 
edges started locking up and I could not
believe<00:03:36.760> it<00:03:36.970> it<00:03:37.269> had<00:03:37.359> only<00:03:37.510> been<00:03:37.690> three<00:03:37.989> weeks

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:38.049 
believe it it had only been three weeks

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:40.020 
believe it it had only been three weeks
so<00:03:38.440> I<00:03:38.650> was<00:03:39.069> going<00:03:39.250> to<00:03:39.310> go<00:03:39.430> a<00:03:39.459> month<00:03:39.700> but<00:03:39.970> I

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
so I was going to go a month but I

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:41.550 
so I was going to go a month but I
immediately<00:03:40.329> started<00:03:40.959> taking<00:03:41.260> them<00:03:41.379> down

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
immediately started taking them down

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.800 
immediately started taking them down
because<00:03:41.769> I<00:03:41.950> couldn't<00:03:42.280> handle<00:03:42.579> that<00:03:42.790> so<00:03:43.420> these

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
because I couldn't handle that so these

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.629 
because I couldn't handle that so these
will<00:03:44.049> only<00:03:44.290> last<00:03:44.620> about<00:03:44.859> a<00:03:45.010> couple<00:03:45.370> of<00:03:45.430> weeks

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:45.639 
will only last about a couple of weeks

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:46.979 
will only last about a couple of weeks
because<00:03:45.849> I<00:03:45.970> definitely<00:03:46.269> can't<00:03:46.569> handle<00:03:46.840> my

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
because I definitely can't handle my

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:48.240 
because I definitely can't handle my
hair<00:03:47.200> locking<00:03:47.709> because<00:03:47.889> that<00:03:48.069> was<00:03:48.220> a

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
hair locking because that was a

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.640 
hair locking because that was a
nightmare<00:03:48.489> but<00:03:48.970> I<00:03:49.239> just<00:03:49.870> make<00:03:50.019> sure<00:03:50.049> I<00:03:50.230> keep<00:03:50.500> my
