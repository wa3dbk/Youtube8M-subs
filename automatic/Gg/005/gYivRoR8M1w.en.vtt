00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.110 
getting transferred back into the main

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.640 
getting transferred back into the main
tank<00:05:20.699> and<00:05:21.699> now<00:05:21.879> it's<00:05:22.330> not<00:05:22.629> for<00:05:23.169> the<00:05:23.229> most<00:05:23.379> part

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:23.650 
tank and now it's not for the most part

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:27.980 
tank and now it's not for the most part
except<00:05:24.009> somebody's<00:05:24.370> fine<00:05:24.639> fine<00:05:24.939> particles

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:27.990 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:32.369 

I'll<00:05:29.219> switch<00:05:30.219> this<00:05:30.370> maxi<00:05:30.909> jet<00:05:31.150> over<00:05:32.139> to<00:05:32.229> this

00:05:32.369 --> 00:05:32.379 
I'll switch this maxi jet over to this

00:05:32.379 --> 00:05:34.709 
I'll switch this maxi jet over to this
chamber<00:05:32.830> at<00:05:32.919> some<00:05:33.129> point<00:05:33.400> try<00:05:34.210> to<00:05:34.270> blow<00:05:34.449> it<00:05:34.479> out

00:05:34.709 --> 00:05:34.719 
chamber at some point try to blow it out

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:37.260 
chamber at some point try to blow it out
a<00:05:34.750> little<00:05:34.960> bit<00:05:35.169> and<00:05:35.979> that'll<00:05:36.370> get<00:05:36.580> thrown<00:05:37.150> up

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:37.270 
a little bit and that'll get thrown up

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:38.640 
a little bit and that'll get thrown up
in<00:05:37.419> the<00:05:37.569> main<00:05:37.719> tank<00:05:37.930> for<00:05:38.139> a<00:05:38.169> little<00:05:38.349> bit<00:05:38.439> but

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:38.650 
in the main tank for a little bit but

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:41.580 
in the main tank for a little bit but
then<00:05:38.800> it<00:05:39.370> should<00:05:40.330> hopefully<00:05:40.479> be<00:05:40.779> caught<00:05:41.229> by

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:41.590 
then it should hopefully be caught by

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:47.309 
then it should hopefully be caught by
the<00:05:41.830> filter<00:05:42.339> pads<00:05:42.639> on<00:05:42.939> the<00:05:43.029> other<00:05:43.180> side<00:05:46.319> that's

00:05:47.309 --> 00:05:47.319 
the filter pads on the other side that's

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:50.010 
the filter pads on the other side that's
