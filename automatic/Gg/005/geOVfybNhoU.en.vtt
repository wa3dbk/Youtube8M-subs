I'm pretty sure

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.479 
I'm pretty sure
would<00:02:13.989> be<00:02:14.109> least<00:02:14.409> a<00:02:14.560> dollar<00:02:15.689> if<00:02:16.689> it<00:02:17.079> wasn't<00:02:17.439> for

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
would be least a dollar if it wasn't for

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:20.640 
would be least a dollar if it wasn't for
in-app<00:02:18.489> purchases<00:02:18.969> like<00:02:19.120> gems<00:02:19.469> this<00:02:20.469> is<00:02:20.620> a

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
in-app purchases like gems this is a

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.050 
in-app purchases like gems this is a
really<00:02:21.010> good<00:02:21.159> game<00:02:21.310> look<00:02:21.519> at<00:02:21.640> the<00:02:21.790> graphics

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
really good game look at the graphics

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.390 
really good game look at the graphics
this<00:02:22.390> is<00:02:22.510> a<00:02:22.540> really<00:02:22.959> really<00:02:23.379> good<00:02:24.010> looking

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
this is a really really good looking

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.119

game<00:02:24.640> and<00:02:24.909> it's<00:02:25.000> free<00:02:25.329> so<00:02:26.140> obviously<00:02:26.829> there's

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:27.129 
game and it's free so obviously there's

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:28.679 
game and it's free so obviously there's
got<00:02:27.280> to<00:02:27.400> be<00:02:27.430> some<00:02:27.640> sort<00:02:27.790> of<00:02:27.879> in-app<00:02:28.209> purchases

00:02:28.679 --> 00:02:28.689 
got to be some sort of in-app purchases

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:29.880 
got to be some sort of in-app purchases
where<00:02:28.870> they<00:02:28.959> get<00:02:29.079> a<00:02:29.109> bunch<00:02:29.319> of<00:02:29.439> money<00:02:29.560> from

which is the gems and that's why they're

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.270 
which is the gems and that's why they're
overpriced<00:02:32.170> so<00:02:32.439> they<00:02:32.590> can<00:02:32.739> profit<00:02:33.129> off<00:02:33.219> of
