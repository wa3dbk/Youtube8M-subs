00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.299 
I do pole position to last place in a
matter<00:00:31.019> of<00:00:31.140> seconds<00:00:31.619> in<00:00:31.740> Valencia<00:00:32.099> I<00:00:32.130> guess

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
matter of seconds in Valencia I guess

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:33.860 
matter of seconds in Valencia I guess
it's<00:00:32.460> better<00:00:32.640> than<00:00:32.880> being<00:00:33.030> rammed<00:00:33.390> off<00:00:33.600> and

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
it's better than being rammed off and

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.260 
it's better than being rammed off and
turn<00:00:34.050> one<00:00:34.320> but<00:00:34.559> not<00:00:34.800> by<00:00:35.070> much<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:35.940> same

survive without any damage to my car and
I<00:01:48.840> find<00:01:49.049> a<00:01:49.110> close<00:01:49.290> of<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.530> day<00:01:49.649> comes<00:01:49.860> from

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
I find a close of the day comes from

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.510 
I find a close of the day comes from
kuba<00:01:50.670> who<00:01:51.450> literally<00:01:51.899> went<00:01:52.350> into<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.159> pit
