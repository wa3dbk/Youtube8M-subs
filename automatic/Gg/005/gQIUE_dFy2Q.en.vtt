00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.880
 the car lobbies suffers extenuating headaches for more than 

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.429
 two weeks when all the tests are presented in the emergency room 

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:13.429
 they performed normal 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.509
 the doctor has no idea who causes these atrocious pains 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:24.090
 But now the only thing you can do is speak a medicine to relieve the 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.550
 syndrome 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.910
 lippi a stronger analgesic but it does not relieve my pain 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:34.680
 you worried that my mother will take so many painkillers because 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.150
 none gave results and he would get used to facts 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.670
 these days i drink alcoholic did not want to be re-quoted to another 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.560
 thing 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.800
 for the 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.300
 but we think the pain would not let him sleep he moved all night he was 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.010
 I wake up all night 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.700
 the sample could not sleep more than an hour or an hour and a half because it is 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.660
 but despite the sleepless nights and the headaches that are 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.700
 forced to continue working there is no that was a hell of facts exhausted all my 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.060
 energies during the day and at work did not yield 8 I was wearing more 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.750
 time to do everything 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.150
 and I did not want to lose the job 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.960
 but day by day loren systemic worked 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.450
 the family depends on her salary 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:24.469
 and little by little 

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:27.939
 lori finds a way to control her episodes at work 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.010
 something is read at lunchtime and I went to bed in the car most of 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:38.740
 the livas times earlier 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.740
 I could not wait to get home 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.640
 but soon Rory arrives daily 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:51.560
 Oscar was there filing and I felt that I was beginning to sound terribly 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.200
 head 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.049
 then I laid down on the floor and supported my head for a while and 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.230
 2 then my little daughter did not join me it hurt so much that I started crying 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.370
 that day I ended up going home 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.249
 and since then I could not work 

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:12.579
 they did not know that all this would end and if ever I would receive help 

00:02:13.689 --> 00:02:15.739
 Tori is totally overwhelmed 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:19.439
 He stopped going to work and still does not know what causes these terrible pains 

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:20.599
 of head 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:24.679
 when a friend recommends that you consult a well-known internist 

00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:29.179
 lori arranges a consultation for them was surprised by the inconsistency 

00:02:29.179 --> 00:02:33.989
 between everything I told him about the analyzes just xie said he could 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:35.989
 be migraines 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:39.659
 Migraine is a neurological condition characterized by pain 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:42.689
 of extremely strong and strenuous heads 

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:45.689
 in fact unpublished one euro the likes 

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:49.680
 hoping that you really have found the cause 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.310
 Lori consults the neurologist and specialist in headaches in 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.979
 Mexico 

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:57.709
 cheers when he consulted me was very concerned as almost all patients 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:00.649
 they start having headaches 

00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:04.899
 the villalÃ³n neighborhood doctor and describe in detail his pains 

00:03:04.899 --> 00:03:07.139
 if the professional people that came up 

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:10.650
 I wish I had symptoms that agreed with the migraine 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.510
 but it was not a case of chronic migraine the usual thing is that the migraine arises in 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.670
 puberty or just after 20 years but they were almost daily and recent 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.009
 so we started looking for another explanation 

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:28.099
 then the doctor gave me an order to a resonance in order to have an idea 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:30.819
 clearer than what happens in the head again 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:34.679
 You wanted to have a clearer image of xerez in the first consultation 

00:03:34.679 --> 00:03:38.709
 then we schedule another consultation two weeks later to see the results 

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:43.279
 glory and return home stealing a resonance help determine the cause 

00:03:43.279 --> 00:03:46.019
 of the pain that has plagued her for two months 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:50.549
 uu but after waiting for results his life is reduced to a dark and implacable 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:52.989
 fight against pain 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:56.359
 but like when I arrived the one in the basement with a rag 

00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:59.809
 agrees the head because he could not do anything felt that we neglected 

00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:03.379
 it was almost always dark 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:06.739
 I felt that my others were not a dungeon 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:09.810
 but during the following days with pain and less you expect it 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.810
 a very frightening symptom emerges 

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:15.879
 in fact after the consultation 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:19.209
 I started to have in points plan thing 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:23.410
 I am with a big, bright light that is already dark for a few seconds 

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:27.270
 we go to exhibitions by god now this 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.699
 nobody knows the cause of the headache now of white dots something bad you 

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:33.960
 something more happened than headaches 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.960
 among the reasons are getting worse 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.050
 it seems that the end will come 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.050
 I could not stand anything else 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.680
 floris takes more than two months withstand headaches so 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.699
 overwhelming that she is forced to absent herself from work for time 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:53.240
 indeterminate 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.700
 a right of pain told me what they wanted and when they wanted to hear 

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:02.120
 so far no doctor found cause of these episodes but in the 

00:05:02.119 --> 00:05:05.159
 duel was from a messina believed to have a clue 

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:09.430
 he practiced a resonance to have a clear picture of the Olympus xerez 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.479
 but while they waited for the result 

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:14.479
 lori began to see white flashes in her central vision 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:20.490
 terrified murray dress tormesina have some answer 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:27.630
 with pain and returned the subject of the consultation was the result of the 

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:30.810
 resonance that showed abnormalities of the white matter of its headquarters 

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:36.740
 the resonance of the east of a series of small white dots with matter 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.689
 white in your brain 

00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:41.370
 the cause of these marks is not clear 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.949
 but when the unspeakable his new symptom 

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:45.819
 Dr. Messina has an idea 

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:49.759
 I was just very worried I reported a new vision symptom 

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:50.509
 blurred 

00:05:50.509 --> 00:05:51.949
 we call it to you 

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:56.499
 people suffering from migraines with aura are likely to have abnormalities between 

00:05:56.499 --> 00:06:00.770
 the left and right atria of the heart I ask this symptom and the sight 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:04.610
 and absence of another reason the following logical suspicion focuses on the 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:05.879
 heart 

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:09.610
 although lori considers that the explanation is strange the doctor 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:13.439
 neighborhood explains a recent study that suggests a relationship between pains 

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:15.119
 head in the heart 

00:06:15.119 --> 00:06:18.939
 obama has astonished what one thing has to do with another but also 

00:06:18.939 --> 00:06:22.969
 I thought you know what it does I'm going to do what you tell me I was willing to try 

00:06:22.969 --> 00:06:24.099
 anything 

00:06:24.099 --> 00:06:27.939
 that yes this led us to the new test a transesophageal echocardiogram 

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:30.490
 or you 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:35.319
 the tea consists in introducing a probe with a mini-camera in the eyes 

00:06:35.319 --> 00:06:38.520
 which allows doctors to have a clear picture of the heart 

00:06:40.289 --> 00:06:44.289
 As you remember, we derive them from a quincho doctor, I think it's a 

00:06:44.289 --> 00:06:47.419
 cardiologist of this city that has been doing this same codex for years
