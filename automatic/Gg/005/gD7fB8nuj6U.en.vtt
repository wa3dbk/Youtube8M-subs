00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:35.560
 American loses against the republic 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:38.470
 Dominican is the 45th team in the 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.980
 classification of the atp but the worst of 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:44.460
 all this is that it is the ninth 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:47.010
 or Latin American or American rather 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.290
 said in the classification of the cup 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.750
 davis this is really something that 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.540
 Surprises many people because tennis 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.030
 It has always been a strong sport without 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.500
 But lately the defeats are a 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.270
 the order of the day 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.890
 the only one that always saves the honor of 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.890
 Mexican team of the Davis Cup is 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.980
 santiago gonzález who went to play the 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:11.430
 double and won it on the other side hernán 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:13.230
 heron a boy ramírez in short all 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.710
 they are not having tennis 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.690
 enough to give mexico trumps 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:21.540
 triumphs that place us at least 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:24.420
 on the verge of a global group that is 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.860
 in the second division we continue in the 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:30.720
 third division and we will continue in 2013 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.810
 unfortunately, maybe something is 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.030
 what to call young players 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.920
 integrate the Mexican team not with 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.000
 four or five players but maybe with 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:44.000
 ten or twelve young people and that one 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.280
 stand out soon and reach in the 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.980
 tennis or the level of santiago gonzález 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:52.250
 everyone else has been tested and there 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:55.160
 we are united in group 2 of the zone 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:03:00.070
 americana continues with us in solo 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.070
