storm of the year hooked up with some
great<00:00:44.890> friends<00:00:45.129> and<00:00:45.610> saw<00:00:46.330> that<00:00:46.360> place<00:00:46.690> like<00:00:46.870> I

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:46.989 
great friends and saw that place like I

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:51.540 
great friends and saw that place like I
never<00:00:47.050> had<00:00:47.410> before<00:00:49.620> we<00:00:50.620> finished<00:00:51.010> up<00:00:51.160> in<00:00:51.309> Tahoe

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:51.550 
never had before we finished up in Tahoe

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.790 
never had before we finished up in Tahoe
and<00:00:51.730> we're<00:00:52.360> in<00:00:52.510> route<00:00:52.690> to<00:00:52.840> Colorado<00:00:53.320> and<00:00:53.500> then

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:53.800 
and we're in route to Colorado and then

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.680 
and we're in route to Colorado and then
we<00:00:53.920> realized<00:00:54.340> well<00:00:54.670> the<00:00:55.120> conditions<00:00:55.600> are

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690 
we realized well the conditions are

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.080 
we realized well the conditions are
going<00:00:55.870> off<00:00:56.110> in<00:00:56.290> Utah<00:00:56.650> so<00:00:56.980> we<00:00:57.340> better<00:00:57.489> stop<00:00:57.820> off

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.090 
going off in Utah so we better stop off

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.090 
going off in Utah so we better stop off
and<00:00:58.330> that's<00:00:58.540> I<00:00:58.870> think<00:00:59.290> that's<00:00:59.589> when<00:00:59.739> I<00:00:59.769> really

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
and that's I think that's when I really

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.040 
and that's I think that's when I really
realized<00:01:00.309> that<00:01:00.730> the<00:01:01.360> airstream<00:01:01.750> is<00:01:01.839> a<00:01:01.900> way<00:01:02.019> to

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.050 
realized that the airstream is a way to

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.990 
realized that the airstream is a way to
go<00:01:04.800> welcome<00:01:05.800> to<00:01:05.890> the<00:01:05.920> bunk<00:01:06.220> room<00:01:06.340> here<00:01:06.790> in<00:01:06.940> the
