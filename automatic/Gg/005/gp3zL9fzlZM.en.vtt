different ways that people pick up these
big<00:01:55.009> bikes

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.429 

we're<00:01:58.110> just<00:01:58.289> trying<00:01:58.619> to<00:01:58.759> reinforce<00:02:00.350> riding<00:02:01.350> in

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
we're just trying to reinforce riding in

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.679 
we're just trying to reinforce riding in
the<00:02:01.500> friction<00:02:01.740> zone<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:02.490> using<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.450> crutch

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:05.689 
the friction zone and using the crutch

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:09.589 
the friction zone and using the crutch
really<00:02:06.689> good<00:02:06.810> writing<00:02:07.049> skills<00:02:07.170> are<00:02:08.599> embodied

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
really good writing skills are embodied

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:14.570 
really good writing skills are embodied
by<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:09.989> ability<00:02:10.319> to<00:02:10.530> go<00:02:10.860> really<00:02:11.190> slow<00:02:13.580> our

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
by the ability to go really slow our

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.360 
by the ability to go really slow our
next<00:02:15.060> exercise<00:02:15.390> is<00:02:15.900> a<00:02:15.930> trail<00:02:16.260> stop<00:02:16.590> this<00:02:17.130> is<00:02:17.280> a

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
next exercise is a trail stop this is a

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:23.030 
next exercise is a trail stop this is a
pretty<00:02:17.550> handy<00:02:18.000> little<00:02:18.209> exercise<00:02:18.690> I<00:02:21.920> hit<00:02:22.920> the

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
pretty handy little exercise I hit the

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.890 
pretty handy little exercise I hit the
brakes<00:02:23.280> and<00:02:23.489> just<00:02:23.819> as<00:02:23.940> I<00:02:24.060> did<00:02:24.299> I<00:02:24.450> shifted<00:02:24.840> my

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
brakes and just as I did I shifted my

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.630 
brakes and just as I did I shifted my
weight<00:02:25.230> as<00:02:25.440> far<00:02:25.709> back<00:02:25.920> on<00:02:26.130> the<00:02:26.220> bike<00:02:26.370> as<00:02:26.549> I

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
weight as far back on the bike as I

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.600 
weight as far back on the bike as I
could<00:02:27.260> if<00:02:28.260> the<00:02:28.560> front<00:02:28.739> wheel<00:02:28.890> skid<00:02:29.190> you<00:02:29.430> need

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
could if the front wheel skid you need

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.089 
could if the front wheel skid you need
to<00:02:29.760> be<00:02:29.849> able<00:02:29.940> to<00:02:30.030> release<00:02:30.390> and<00:02:30.799> ideally<00:02:31.799> you

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
to be able to release and ideally you

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:33.770 
to be able to release and ideally you
don't<00:02:32.250> want<00:02:32.430> to<00:02:32.489> just<00:02:32.670> let<00:02:32.790> go<00:02:32.849> you<00:02:33.239> just<00:02:33.510> want

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
don't want to just let go you just want

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.920 
don't want to just let go you just want
to<00:02:33.840> release<00:02:34.170> a<00:02:34.200> little<00:02:34.440> pressure<00:02:34.769> and<00:02:35.930> you

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
to release a little pressure and you

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.530 
to release a little pressure and you
need<00:02:37.110> as<00:02:37.290> much<00:02:37.530> weight<00:02:37.799> as<00:02:38.010> possible<00:02:38.540> directly

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
need as much weight as possible directly

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.229 
need as much weight as possible directly
over<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.290> contact<00:02:40.769> patch<00:02:41.040> where<00:02:41.519> the<00:02:41.760> tire<00:02:42.030> is

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
over the contact patch where the tire is

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.390 
over the contact patch where the tire is
touching<00:02:42.660> the<00:02:42.750> dirt<00:02:42.930> what<00:02:43.799> you<00:02:43.920> need<00:02:44.069> to<00:02:44.160> do<00:02:44.280> is

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
touching the dirt what you need to do is

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.860 
touching the dirt what you need to do is
counterbalance<00:02:45.360> not<00:02:45.900> countersteer<00:02:47.630> on<00:02:48.630> this

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
counterbalance not countersteer on this

counterbalance not countersteer on this
exercise<00:02:49.349> we're<00:02:50.190> working<00:02:50.640> on<00:02:50.790> brake<00:02:51.090> control

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
exercise we're working on brake control

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.910 
exercise we're working on brake control
on<00:02:52.170> a<00:02:52.230> downhill<00:02:52.709> descent<00:02:54.470> there<00:02:55.470> you<00:02:55.709> go<00:02:55.860> you

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
on a downhill descent there you go you

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.710 
on a downhill descent there you go you
like<00:02:56.280> that<00:02:56.519> squeaking<00:02:56.970> sound<00:02:57.269> that's<00:02:57.569> your

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
like that squeaking sound that's your

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.819 
like that squeaking sound that's your
friend<00:02:58.880> so<00:02:59.880> the<00:03:00.030> technique<00:03:00.450> is<00:03:01.079> to<00:03:01.560> bring<00:03:01.739> the

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829 
friend so the technique is to bring the

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:03.830 
friend so the technique is to bring the
RPMs<00:03:02.280> up<00:03:02.489> just<00:03:02.730> a<00:03:02.850> little<00:03:03.120> bit<00:03:03.239> above<00:03:03.420> idle

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
RPMs up just a little bit above idle
