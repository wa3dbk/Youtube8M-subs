00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 hello everybody is a double clutch luca 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:12.719
 this is the presentation of the shoe 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:15.120
 under armor rivals as always we start 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.710
 from the cushioning is the first 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.960
 presentation is what we do under 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.810
 armor but still not to be short 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.730
 summarized in the last few years 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.859
 will go used as pillows 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.199
 therefore as cushioning the never crosses 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:31.289
 a very very good and very foam 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.480
 reactive and also comfortable for this 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.270
 shoe introduce for the first time the 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.120
 charles bouchard who is nothing but one 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.370
 a foam that responds a little 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.940
 more reactive than michael 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.520
 g 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.379
 especially when stimulated in a manner 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.110
 intense or when you are walking 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.420
 quietly for the field is a lot is 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.949
 a comfortable as like foam while 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.079
 when you apply a lot of strength then 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.899
 in restarts or in arrests 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.760
 answers a little more firmly for 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.800
 regarding the materials here too 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.719
 a major innovation by under 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.939
 armor that in the last shoes in the 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.700
 classes fit drive has used precisely 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.680
 the classic is a very synthetic material 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.260
 however very enveloping whose 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.600
 main objective was the support here 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.869
 instead useful uses this ana fom 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.700
 material that is almost gives you one 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.360
 feeling similar to the canvas then to the 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.280
 fabric but is reinforced by foam therefore 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.530
 from foam introduced for the whole 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.439
 length of the shoe in the topical points 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.600
 to give us both support and anyway 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.460
 a good feeling at the level of 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.560
 comfort with regards to the fit 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.689
 this kariwa dresses true to site 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.310
 so go quietly with 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.799
 the size you dress regularly too 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.540
 with the other brands it does not change anything 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.490
 another thing to add that the 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.430
 fit and very enveloping but still 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:54.150
 very comfortable like kind of 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:57.540
 of sensation I would compare it to a 29 of 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:59.880
 jordan just that slightly softer 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.650
 being all in performance fabric 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.810
 we've while this one is slightly 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.400
 more rigid with regard to 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.960
 support we have our classic 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.270
 shoe with high-level cut 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.280
 of the ankle also given by the fact that 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.530
 creates ankles that are not really the 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.560
 then these give him a good one 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.570
 support and in the back 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.870
 we have our classic shane plate 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:23.670
 with a tpu support that allows us 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.480
 to stay stable inside the 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:29.550
 base of the shoe and therefore prevents from 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.230
 shell out of school in the 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.600
 side stops and in any case 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.459
 lateral movements in general 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.890
 we also have good level support 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:41.160
 of the sole therefore a support of the arch 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:44.520
 plantar and always also anti torsion e 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.560
 in tpu then in plastic the rest of the 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.420
 support and given however by the fit 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.670
 very enveloping and very firm has 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.330
 precisely from the ana food material of which 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.330
 we talked before 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.740
 as final and personal considerations 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:10.610
 on this first shoe signature of the neo 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:13.180
 mvp sterckx as I told you the parable 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:16.100
 a bit like the 29 kind of like fit 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:19.370
 feeling that gives you as soon as you feel it e 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:21.770
 very good this charged cushion 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.440
 and precisely because we also have the mai 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:26.120
 crosses that makes us a carrier then for 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.440
 make you understand that maybe someone has not 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:31.280
 still assimilated all these terms 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:34.070
 the carrier is the material it contains 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.900
 so that acts as a bearer of the 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:39.110
 main cushioning technology 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:42.710
 therefore comparing it to other type brands 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:44.630
 nike and jordan use the file on come 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:47.000
 carrier and maybe they usually put us 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:49.160
 for example zoomer then air nor 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.680
 the midsole to give us the real one 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:55.130
 protection and responsiveness here we ever have 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:58.010
 crosses and the sound coscioni for the rest 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:00.290
 as I told you excellent point shoe 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.800
 price slightly higher than that 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.900
 that is 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:05.360
 in the states for a matter of 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:08.420
 imports of under armor throughout 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:10.850
 europa is the carrie white and at 180 euros 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.770
 however a very good good product 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:14.840
 thanks as always for following us 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:17.000
 also for this presentation 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.580
 we hope from now on to succeed in 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.709
 bring more under-armor shoes too 

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:22.880
 because if the summer asking a lot 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:24.200
 we will also try to do more 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.700
 also presentations of shoes that 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.430
 however we will not be able to have the 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:31.190
 store to give you a service always 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.810
 best, in short, we try and do it 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:36.169
 like how he 's responding like 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:38.510
