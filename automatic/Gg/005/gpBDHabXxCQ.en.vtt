00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.610

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.000
 cut the hair but calm because 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.250
 As you already know, I'm preparing videos 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.110
 for the whole month of July so when 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.970
 you are seeing this I will be already 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.430
 shaved with cut hair and all that 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.730
 I just wanted to record this to mediate 6 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.500
 well in my shipwrecked way so good 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.720

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.210

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.340
 Friday and I will be on Wednesday like this 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.700

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.860
 what 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:45.280
 very well 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.060
 come on, that's what I'm doing with my hair 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.370
 cut and others 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:50.550
 I guess I'll be retweeting the photos 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:55.270
 immediate with you so good 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:57.250
 it was just for doing the grace was for 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:59.380
 uploading a video one of the 2.0 is that 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.330
 I have planned with long hair 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.760
 because not always with short hair 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:06.280
 because today to change a few days I have 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.740
 burst with the remington and well then 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.990
 here we are, it's been a while since I've played 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.910
 the truth quite that I do not play is not a 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.340
 game that they play very why was that 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:18.340
 It is not a game to play much to 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.350
 fuck you doing there that does what you do in 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.030
 the corner as I was saying is not a 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.090
 game that plays a lot if it's not for 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.520
 record but nonetheless been riding 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.119
 and editing videos these days so neither 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.119

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.900

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.609
 of peace 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:44.250
 vale vale vale vale slowly 

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:48.010
 watch out 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:50.170

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.180
 well nothing now I'm going to kill him 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.970

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.520

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.550

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.270
 the predecessor teacher does not know right now 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.700
 I'm not very 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.960

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.250
 put in the corner what you have seen or 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:26.170
 I've seen it while putting 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:29.580
 let's see if we throw a grenade and 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.110
 we can do something not 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.810
 watch out 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:37.740
 let's make it bounce here we take the 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:39.990
 shotgun and we burst god as plan 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:42.450
 failed because then because the colleague 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:44.400
 had an electric charge of those that 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.090
 they give a lot is that you give me 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.190
 they love 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:53.140
 if I do not know how to express some love 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:56.550
 that I have some things from each one and 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.550
 another there is worth 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.450
 we'll see 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:08.430
 peace 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:14.569

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:17.989

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.250

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:44.530
 It's better I wanted to go and do it like that 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:46.810
 what I wanted to do exactly I do not know how 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.710
 call it the truth but good has come out 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.710
 wrong anyway 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.810
 Is the reason 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:04:00.050
 this 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:00.050
 it's history let's go let's see 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.569
 sure it's worth 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.100
 OK 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:16.790

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:23.450
 me the truth is good enough 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:26.690
 so I'll settle for the radio in this 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:28.850
 kind of results what I do not like is 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.140
 that there is then because there are 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:33.350
 You have seen yours with you 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:36.010
 own eyes right now that no longer 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:38.960
 so cool but good nothing happens 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:42.040
 while the example and have fun 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:44.410

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:51.830
 vico I do not know how the fuck is called 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:54.680
 and it gets in everyone in a corner you 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:56.409
 that is, you have to get bored enough to 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:59.210
 do that 

00:04:56.409 --> 00:05:02.660
 let's make it bounce there 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:06.730
 he is no longer husband 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.730

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:15.030
 can not be a mobile nun, my mother 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:18.720

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:20.830
 good wafer and this spray can not be 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:24.530
 it can not be that it is not 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:26.810

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:34.750

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:34.750
 Uncle cojones is what the fuck 

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:43.900

 of police takes for you fuck 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:50.000
 you have to get nervous nervous 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:52.540
 to win yes or yes and that 's better than 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.540
 anything 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:58.920

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:08.790
 from 25 to 12 and this is going to end here 

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:10.290
 because the pitbull ne good name has been 

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:15.930

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:18.210

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:19.860
 ratio and good then there is the double 

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:21.540
