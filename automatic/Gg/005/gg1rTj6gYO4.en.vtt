block

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:41.299 
block
I<00:00:39.600> have<00:00:40.019> literally<00:00:40.260> used<00:00:40.679> none<00:00:40.920> of<00:00:41.010> these<00:00:41.070> so

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
I have literally used none of these so

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.819 
I have literally used none of these so
far<00:00:41.609> but<00:00:42.440> really<00:00:43.440> should<00:00:43.559> have<00:00:43.649> found<00:00:43.710> a

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
far but really should have found a

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.439 
far but really should have found a
flatter<00:00:44.339> area<00:00:44.730> but<00:00:44.850> we'll<00:00:44.969> try<00:00:45.179> it<00:00:45.210> out<00:00:45.300> it

00:00:45.439 --> 00:00:45.449 
flatter area but we'll try it out it

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:46.579 
flatter area but we'll try it out it
doesn't<00:00:45.600> really<00:00:45.690> matter<00:00:45.929> out<00:00:46.050> these<00:00:46.199> fans<00:00:46.469> and

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:46.589 
doesn't really matter out these fans and

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:53.590 
doesn't really matter out these fans and
stuff<00:00:46.859> so<00:00:46.980> well<00:00:47.100> this<00:00:47.569> will<00:00:48.569> do

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.009 

looky-looky-looky

00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:55.019 
looky-looky-looky

00:00:55.019 --> 00:01:00.169 
looky-looky-looky
and<00:00:55.399> lucky<00:00:58.609> then<00:00:59.609> there<00:00:59.789> should<00:00:59.909> be<00:00:59.969> enough

00:01:00.169 --> 00:01:00.179 
and lucky then there should be enough

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:03.379 
and lucky then there should be enough
distance<00:01:00.359> for<00:01:00.719> very<00:01:01.079> lucky<00:01:01.469> very<00:01:01.850> lucky<00:01:02.850> very

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:03.389

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.130 
ones are gonna be very very dangerous
we'll<00:01:11.790> do<00:01:11.939> these<00:01:12.090> in<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.270> forest<00:01:12.570> unlucky
