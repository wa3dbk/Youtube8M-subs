00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
I'm so good on to this world which we

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.620 
I'm so good on to this world which we
use<00:00:28.830> for<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:29.220> textbook<00:00:29.490> view<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:30.060> as<00:00:30.300> you<00:00:30.480> can

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
use for the textbook view and as you can

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.299 
use for the textbook view and as you can
see<00:00:30.660> when<00:00:30.960> we're<00:00:31.080> gone<00:00:31.199> it's<00:00:31.380> very<00:00:31.590> bright<00:00:31.859> so
