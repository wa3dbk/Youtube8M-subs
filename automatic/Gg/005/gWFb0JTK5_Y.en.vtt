bacon should I put on my bacon buddy or
sandwich<00:02:26.950> but<00:02:27.460> I'll<00:02:27.580> tell<00:02:27.730> you<00:02:27.850> what<00:02:27.970> there's

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
sandwich but I'll tell you what there's

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.360 
sandwich but I'll tell you what there's
no<00:02:28.390> hard<00:02:28.690> and<00:02:28.810> fast<00:02:28.900> rules<00:02:29.350> about<00:02:29.560> this<00:02:29.830> but<00:02:30.340> a

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
no hard and fast rules about this but a

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.190 
no hard and fast rules about this but a
good<00:02:30.580> rule<00:02:30.700> of<00:02:30.760> thumb<00:02:30.880> with<00:02:31.510> an<00:02:31.630> alpha<00:02:31.960> slice

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
good rule of thumb with an alpha slice

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.670 
good rule of thumb with an alpha slice
this<00:02:32.470> big<00:02:32.710> probably<00:02:33.400> around<00:02:33.550> 3<00:02:34.650> ensuring<00:02:35.650> that

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
this big probably around 3 ensuring that

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.500 
this big probably around 3 ensuring that
you<00:02:35.860> keep<00:02:36.010> the<00:02:36.130> bacon<00:02:36.490> within<00:02:37.090> the<00:02:37.209> alpha

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
you keep the bacon within the alpha

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.790 
you keep the bacon within the alpha
slice<00:02:37.750> and<00:02:38.020> that's<00:02:38.230> important

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
slice and that's important

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.350 
slice and that's important
now<00:02:41.800> we've<00:02:41.980> correctly<00:02:42.370> placed<00:02:42.640> our<00:02:42.850> bacon<00:02:43.240> on

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
now we've correctly placed our bacon on

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.540 
now we've correctly placed our bacon on
top<00:02:43.390> of<00:02:43.660> the<00:02:43.780> alpha<00:02:44.080> slice<00:02:44.320> this<00:02:45.010> is<00:02:45.190> an<00:02:45.280> ideal

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
top of the alpha slice this is an ideal

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.090 
top of the alpha slice this is an ideal
time<00:02:45.850> to<00:02:46.150> add<00:02:46.360> the<00:02:46.510> tomatoes<00:02:47.020> the<00:02:47.410> cheese<00:02:47.680> the

time to add the tomatoes the cheese the

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.729 
time to add the tomatoes the cheese the
lettuce<00:02:48.430> and<00:02:48.580> the<00:02:48.970> avocado<00:02:49.090> but<00:02:49.840> personally<00:02:50.560> I

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
lettuce and the avocado but personally I

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:52.770 
lettuce and the avocado but personally I
feel<00:02:51.160> they<00:02:51.340> can<00:02:51.489> detract<00:02:51.730> from<00:02:51.940> the<00:02:52.390> flavor<00:02:52.630> of

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
feel they can detract from the flavor of

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.350 
feel they can detract from the flavor of
the<00:02:52.900> bacon<00:02:53.050> so<00:02:53.590> I'm<00:02:53.739> looking<00:02:54.010> a<00:02:54.070> bother<00:02:54.360> the

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
the bacon so I'm looking a bother the

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.720 
the bacon so I'm looking a bother the
next<00:02:55.720> step<00:02:55.870> is<00:02:56.050> crucial<00:02:56.260> now<00:02:57.100> we<00:02:57.160> take<00:02:57.489> a

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
next step is crucial now we take a

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.210 
next step is crucial now we take a
second<00:02:58.480> piece<00:02:58.510> of<00:02:58.810> bread<00:02:59.020> you<00:02:59.560> might<00:02:59.800> like<00:03:00.040> to

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
second piece of bread you might like to

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.920 
second piece of bread you might like to
measure<00:03:00.459> it<00:03:00.700> to<00:03:00.940> ensure<00:03:01.390> that<00:03:01.540> it<00:03:01.690> fits

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
measure it to ensure that it fits

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.690 
measure it to ensure that it fits
perfectly<00:03:02.380> on<00:03:02.530> top<00:03:02.709> of<00:03:02.830> your<00:03:02.980> foundation<00:03:03.610> or

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
perfectly on top of your foundation or

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.790 
perfectly on top of your foundation or
our<00:03:04.090> first<00:03:04.330> slice<00:03:04.570> but<00:03:05.230> a<00:03:05.290> good<00:03:05.500> rule<00:03:05.650> of<00:03:05.680> thumb

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
our first slice but a good rule of thumb

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.220 
our first slice but a good rule of thumb
is<00:03:05.980> if<00:03:06.280> it<00:03:06.700> came<00:03:06.880> from<00:03:06.940> the<00:03:07.120> same<00:03:07.390> loaf<00:03:07.660> there's

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
is if it came from the same loaf there's

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.110 
is if it came from the same loaf there's
a<00:03:08.320> very<00:03:08.560> good<00:03:08.590> chance<00:03:08.739> it'll<00:03:09.430> be<00:03:09.670> a<00:03:09.700> good<00:03:09.910> match

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
a very good chance it'll be a good match

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.460 
a very good chance it'll be a good match
and<00:03:10.600> you'll<00:03:10.780> be<00:03:10.900> ok<00:03:12.239> this<00:03:13.239> slice<00:03:13.570> is<00:03:13.870> called
