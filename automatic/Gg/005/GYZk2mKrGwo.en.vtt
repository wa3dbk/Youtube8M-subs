00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
keep keep the LEDs from overheating then

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.459 
keep keep the LEDs from overheating then
I<00:00:58.469> added<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:59.250> piece<00:01:00.030> of<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.359> fuser<00:01:00.719> screen<00:01:01.230> that

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
I added a piece of the fuser screen that

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.369 
I added a piece of the fuser screen that
I<00:01:01.500> pulled<00:01:01.829> from<00:01:02.010> an<00:01:02.160> LCD<00:01:02.609> screen<00:01:03.239> so<00:01:04.019> that<00:01:04.049> the

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
I pulled from an LCD screen so that the

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.289 
I pulled from an LCD screen so that the
lights<00:01:04.619> aren't<00:01:04.890> in<00:01:05.070> crew<00:01:05.339> aren't<00:01:05.880> incredibly

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
lights aren't in crew aren't incredibly

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.160 
lights aren't in crew aren't incredibly
bright<00:01:06.780> when<00:01:07.080> looking<00:01:07.470> at<00:01:07.650> them<00:01:08.010> and<00:01:08.990> then<00:01:09.990> i

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
bright when looking at them and then i

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.830 
bright when looking at them and then i
added<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:10.680> fan<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.250> heatsink<00:01:12.060> that<00:01:12.600> runs

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
added a fan to the heatsink that runs

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.170 
added a fan to the heatsink that runs
off<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.049> LEDs<00:01:13.530> power<00:01:13.860> to<00:01:14.340> keep<00:01:14.520> it<00:01:14.700> all<00:01:14.850> cool

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
off the LEDs power to keep it all cool

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.070 
off the LEDs power to keep it all cool
when<00:01:15.570> it's<00:01:15.689> hanging<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:17.270> then<00:01:18.270> this<00:01:18.780> is<00:01:19.049> the

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
when it's hanging and then this is the

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.410 
when it's hanging and then this is the
driver<00:01:19.530> i<00:01:19.680> built<00:01:20.570> which<00:01:21.570> i<00:01:21.750> modified<00:01:22.290> it<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.590> bit

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
driver i built which i modified it a bit

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.810 
driver i built which i modified it a bit
one<00:01:24.420> thing<00:01:24.659> i<00:01:24.840> had<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:25.770> add<00:01:25.890> was<00:01:26.159> a<00:01:26.189> heat<00:01:26.520> sink

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
one thing i had to add was a heat sink

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.510 
one thing i had to add was a heat sink
to<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.119> power<00:01:27.360> mosfet<00:01:28.130> because<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.280> power

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
to the power mosfet because the power

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.690 
to the power mosfet because the power
mosfet<00:01:29.970> was<00:01:30.150> getting<00:01:30.479> really<00:01:30.630> hot<00:01:30.930> yet<00:01:31.350> the

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
mosfet was getting really hot yet the

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.249 
mosfet was getting really hot yet the
diagram<00:01:32.700> said<00:01:33.090> it<00:01:33.210> didn't<00:01:33.509> really<00:01:33.659> need<00:01:33.990> one

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
diagram said it didn't really need one

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.899 
diagram said it didn't really need one
but<00:01:34.500> i<00:01:34.560> would<00:01:34.860> add<00:01:35.040> one<00:01:35.280> if<00:01:35.430> you<00:01:35.549> were<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.759> get

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
but i would add one if you were to get

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.310 
but i would add one if you were to get
one<00:01:36.060> of<00:01:36.180> these<00:01:36.299> kits<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:37.250> then<00:01:38.250> i<00:01:38.280> added<00:01:38.640> a

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
one of these kits and then i added a

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.410 
one of these kits and then i added a
selector<00:01:40.320> switch<00:01:40.710> i<00:01:40.979> added<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.549> switch<00:01:41.939> on<00:01:42.180> to

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
selector switch i added a switch on to

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.710 
selector switch i added a switch on to
the<00:01:43.020> one<00:01:43.590> of<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.770> resistors<00:01:44.460> that<00:01:44.490> engage<00:01:45.390> and

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
the one of the resistors that engage and

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.929 
the one of the resistors that engage and
disengage<00:01:45.840> it<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.829> select<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.340> current<00:01:47.700> for

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
disengage it to select the current for

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:53.149 
disengage it to select the current for
between<00:01:48.259> 1<00:01:49.259> watt<00:01:49.470> leds<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.100> 3<00:01:51.030> watt<00:01:51.240> leds<00:01:52.159> so

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
between 1 watt leds and 3 watt leds so

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.270 
between 1 watt leds and 3 watt leds so
that<00:01:53.340> this<00:01:53.520> can<00:01:53.759> be<00:01:53.909> more<00:01:54.119> universal<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.280> then

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
that this can be more universal and then

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.330 
that this can be more universal and then
i<00:01:56.310> added<00:01:56.670> a<00:01:56.939> power<00:01:57.210> switch<00:01:57.649> that<00:01:58.649> can<00:01:58.829> turn<00:01:59.070> on

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
i added a power switch that can turn on

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.980 
i added a power switch that can turn on
and<00:01:59.579> off<00:01:59.729> the<00:02:00.030> leds<00:02:01.040> when<00:02:02.040> I<00:02:02.070> want<00:02:02.460> to<00:02:02.990> like

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
and off the leds when I want to like

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:11.119 
and off the leds when I want to like
that<00:02:04.320> and<00:02:04.649> then<00:02:05.250> they<00:02:05.490> hey<00:02:07.670> and<00:02:08.869> then<00:02:10.129> this

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
that and then they hey and then this

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.730 
that and then they hey and then this
driver<00:02:11.580> will<00:02:12.000> will<00:02:12.599> change<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:13.170> voltage

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
driver will will change the voltage

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.820 
driver will will change the voltage
automatically<00:02:14.430> to<00:02:15.240> require<00:02:15.630> to<00:02:16.260> that<00:02:16.440> set

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
automatically to require to that set

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:22.190 
automatically to require to that set
milliamp<00:02:17.670> output<00:02:18.450> for<00:02:19.320> the<00:02:19.350> LEDs<00:02:19.890> and<00:02:21.200> then

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
milliamp output for the LEDs and then

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.530 
milliamp output for the LEDs and then
for<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:22.740> driver<00:02:23.070> the<00:02:23.430> input<00:02:23.880> voltage<00:02:23.910> can<00:02:24.510> be

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
for the driver the input voltage can be

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.480 
for the driver the input voltage can be
either<00:02:25.050> AC<00:02:25.500> or<00:02:25.890> DC<00:02:26.730> and<00:02:27.800> this<00:02:28.800> is<00:02:29.010> the<00:02:29.160> range

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
either AC or DC and this is the range
