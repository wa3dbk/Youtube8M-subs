 I think this is a character card battle 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:11.650
 This kind of character I took to Variable Beijing 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.909
 It is a weakening of the card 

00:00:14.909 --> 00:00:17.769
 Use this card before entering a match 

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:19.780
 I told you to declare 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:21.749
 It was just meaningful 

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:26.789
 Even when you get sick with magicians and attacks 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.420
 I can use it from a school I want to work widely 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:33.880
 The attack power of the monster is improved and the rule is different from the problem 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:36.989
 For those who have been trying to fight 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.890
 I want to meet you 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.890

 Okay bond high 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:59.659

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:04.780
 Fight at a high 100 on the basis of the attack power of the Far East Act 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.030
 I was able to 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.220
 It is possible to reduce the magnification to the background tempura in Naruto 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.350
 I can not do so much but there aren't many general three-column types across the country 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.200
 In a nutshell 7.7 years old equivalent exchangeable 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.100
 appear 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.420
 Heidfeld

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.190
 Using the book's copper plate software that will be 2100 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.050
 The previous card set is to break Stefan badly 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.030
 I do not know good high resolution in this activity, but 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.530
 That's why I could not go in the Olympics from Japan Micro 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.840
 By millionaire not created by PC 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.149
 I think the cooperation version that I think pirate version is completed well 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:50.800
 Thorough dissection 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.470
 Devil Rays lost 9-2 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.299

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:59.690
 Simple expansion of hydrogen sulfide gas in the prefecture 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:04.990
 As we need prior contact when we do trackback 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:11.470
 It's not open and open but it's still open 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.019
 The baby is a cat 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:22.709
 Tomi Umezawa I have been looking back on it once again 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.679
 When it was gone, the yen was nervous.
