p.m. BST so 6 p.m. in the UK here is

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.830 
p.m. BST so 6 p.m. in the UK here is
when<00:00:38.670> it's<00:00:38.820> going<00:00:38.910> to<00:00:39.000> go<00:00:39.120> live<00:00:39.329> is<00:00:39.540> going<00:00:39.780> a

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
when it's going to go live is going a

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.450 
when it's going to go live is going a
little<00:00:39.989> bit<00:00:40.140> later<00:00:40.350> than<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.710> dark<00:00:40.920> bloated

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
little bit later than the dark bloated

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.190 
little bit later than the dark bloated
which<00:00:41.670> I<00:00:41.850> believe<00:00:42.059> went<00:00:42.390> live<00:00:42.690> with<00:00:43.079> the

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
which I believe went live with the

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.080 
which I believe went live with the
actual<00:00:43.379> weekly<00:00:43.950> reset<00:00:44.340> so<00:00:44.579> that<00:00:44.700> means<00:00:44.910> it's

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
actual weekly reset so that means it's

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.000 
actual weekly reset so that means it's
going<00:00:45.270> to<00:00:45.329> drop<00:00:45.539> after<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:46.079> weekly<00:00:46.379> reset<00:00:46.770> now

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
going to drop after the weekly reset now

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.229 
going to drop after the weekly reset now
a<00:00:47.039> lot<00:00:47.250> of<00:00:47.280> people<00:00:47.370> think<00:00:47.730> that<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:48.059> night<00:00:48.210> for

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
a lot of people think that the night for

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.720 
a lot of people think that the night for
next<00:00:48.660> week<00:00:48.809> will<00:00:49.079> be<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.410> new<00:00:49.649> strike<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.340> if

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
next week will be the new strike and if

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.369 
next week will be the new strike and if
that<00:00:50.940> is<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.270> case<00:00:51.300> then<00:00:51.750> it<00:00:51.930> seems<00:00:52.199> like

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
that is the case then it seems like

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.450 
that is the case then it seems like
we're<00:00:52.530> not<00:00:52.620> gonna<00:00:52.710> be<00:00:52.860> able<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:53.039> play<00:00:53.219> it<00:00:53.340> until

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
we're not gonna be able to play it until

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.979 
we're not gonna be able to play it until
the<00:00:53.730> expansion<00:00:54.180> comes<00:00:54.360> out<00:00:54.510> because<00:00:54.840> the

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
the expansion comes out because the

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.750 
the expansion comes out because the
weekly<00:00:55.320> reset<00:00:55.710> being<00:00:55.980> before<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:56.610> you're

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
weekly reset being before and and you're

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.889 
weekly reset being before and and you're
obviously<00:00:57.000> not<00:00:57.270> going<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.480> be<00:00:57.539> able<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.750> play

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
obviously not going to be able to play

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.389 
obviously not going to be able to play
the<00:00:58.079> new<00:00:58.230> strike<00:00:58.710> before<00:00:59.100> it's<00:00:59.309> even

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
the new strike before it's even

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:00.979 
the new strike before it's even
available<00:00:59.670> so<00:01:00.180> that<00:01:00.210> is<00:01:00.449> something<00:01:00.570> to<00:01:00.719> think

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
available so that is something to think

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.270 
available so that is something to think
about<00:01:01.140> we're<00:01:01.379> not<00:01:01.469> entirely<00:01:01.710> sure<00:01:01.829> about<00:01:01.980> that

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
about we're not entirely sure about that

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.039 
about we're not entirely sure about that
at<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.460> moment<00:01:02.609> but<00:01:03.059> what<00:01:03.239> that<00:01:03.390> means<00:01:03.629> for<00:01:03.750> me

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
at the moment but what that means for me

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.719 
at the moment but what that means for me
is<00:01:04.080> that<00:01:04.439> I'm<00:01:04.619> actually<00:01:04.890> not<00:01:05.460> going<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:05.670> be
