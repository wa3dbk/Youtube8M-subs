00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:10.030
 hello everyone how about in this video os 

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:12.400
 I'm going to tell you a great trick for 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:14.619
 that we do not slip sandals with 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.690
 the stockings now that it's starting and at 

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:18.970
 good weather, good, there's still a little bit of 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:21.339
 winter but let's go we're coming to the 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:24.189
 good weather and the weddings we wear 

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:26.679
 many times with stockings and sandals and 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:30.130
 the sandal slips a lot with the 

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:33.540
 good media here I have some sandals and 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:36.070
 I'm going to put a mean and man 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.900
 it really is not a thing that you go 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.420
 to notice but well you know it to spare 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:43.000
 that when we put on like that the sandal 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.920
 with the average they slip and we 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.530
 we can even start from the ankle we walk 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.050
 there like dizzy ducks then there are 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.730
 some insoles that are like silicone 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.920
 to put down here and that is not 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.330
 slide but these templates good by 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.100
 a part sometimes does slip 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.780
 equal the foot and on the other hand it has a 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.780
 another problem at least for me what 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.760
 it was my wedding day that is that they occupy 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.610
 enough and tend if the shoe does not 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.590
 is a little loose with guilt 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.170
 of the template can tighten 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.030
 I took off in the car the guide for the 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.280
 church I removed the templates because 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.869
 they were hugging my shoes 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.819
 The fact is that I 'm going to tell you a 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:22.479
 truquito we can do to avoid 

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:24.670
 we slipped the stocking on the sandal 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:26.590
 good I chose a slightly fat average 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.780
 we would use it is already you know good 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.090
 to go a little thin to a wedding 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.219
 measurements of 8 honey and are the 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.789
 better with this is that I did a course of 

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:35.770
 socks 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:38.380
 so I can tell you what I mean 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:41.619
 you want good then let's go to the trick is 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.959
 simply use double- sided tape 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:45.970
 the double-sided tape is this you can 

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:47.319
 buy at any super supermarket 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.239
 cheap and I do not remember what I 

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:50.739
 it cost this but let's give dad my 

00:01:49.239 --> 00:01:53.170
 thing is the part that has many more 

00:01:50.739 --> 00:01:54.939
 utilities there is not only is there 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.920
 fact we use it in the video in the 

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:58.899
 that I teach you how to make shadow palettes 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.439
 you remember you used tape 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:01.270
 double face 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:04.329
 Well, let's cut a strip 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.399
 we take for example a strip like this or 

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:09.240
 less for the sole of the one covering the 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:11.610
 sandal sole 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.080
 so good the double- sided tape for 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.760
 who does not know it is a tape that 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.190
 stick on both sides hence its name 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.350
 and from this same piece I'm going to cut 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.850
 well in half lengthwise because I 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.850
 already serves for the two sandals 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.100
 and well you can imagine the only thing 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.460
 what we have to do is take this 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.460
 bit 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:39.780
 and stick it on the floor of the sandal 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.999
 we take the sandal and we are going to stick it 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.620
 I could have chosen another one that is with 

00:02:41.999 --> 00:02:47.329
 these flowers you have here I do not know if 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.329
 you are going to achieve or good the aparta a little 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.880
 we paste it like this so it covers 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.160
 more or less the entire plant and now 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.959
 we can calmly put the 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.410
 our sandals and they're not going to 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:11.310
 move around the day we put the average the 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:13.290
 we put in there is good and just sticky 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.480
 It's already me who takes it off and I do not know 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:18.150
 our sandals move or we walk like 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.590
 Dizzy ducks is a very easy trick 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.510
 Well, the other one, you put it on the 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.250
 regional and obviously a truquito 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.140
 very easy as I say it is very effective 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.880
 that when you have the next wedding or 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.190
 sale if you have to put a little 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.890
 you can put into practice and I already 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.660
 you will tell how easy it is and then not 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.549
 forget also the trick of the save 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.260
 slip that I made a video out there so that 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:39.420
 we do not hurt the shoes with what I'll leave 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.459
 also down here by according not what 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.959
 knows that we can even use the 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:45.480
 two we can put the plant the 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:48.269
 sandal you already know the slim saves for 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.850
 that we do not hurt the shoes for 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:52.380
 that dampens and a little and on top of 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.750
 double-sided tape so that we are 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.850
 the average stay stuck so two in one 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:00.319
 Well, nothing else I hope that I have 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:00.319
 liked it useful 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.410
 bye
