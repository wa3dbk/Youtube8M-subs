00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.660 
to the next four go up we do that and
then<00:02:21.090> we<00:02:21.209> do<00:02:21.390> that<00:02:22.250> another<00:02:23.250> thing<00:02:23.489> that<00:02:23.640> you

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
then we do that another thing that you

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:29.330 
then we do that another thing that you
can<00:02:23.790> do<00:02:24.150> is<00:02:24.709> actually<00:02:25.709> have<00:02:26.670> a<00:02:26.700> button<00:02:27.390> on<00:02:28.340> or

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
can do is actually have a button on or

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.339 
can do is actually have a button on or
to<00:02:29.640> use<00:02:29.849> for<00:02:30.060> your<00:02:30.120> signs<00:02:30.390> instead<00:02:30.989> of<00:02:31.170> having

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
to use for your signs instead of having

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:34.070 
to use for your signs instead of having
a<00:02:31.650> sign<00:02:32.220> exposed<00:02:32.790> like<00:02:33.000> that<00:02:33.060> you<00:02:33.900> have<00:02:34.019> a

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
a sign exposed like that you have a

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.410 
a sign exposed like that you have a
button<00:02:34.560> its<00:02:34.769> first<00:02:35.100> so<00:02:35.670> I<00:02:35.700> can<00:02:35.760> put<00:02:36.030> a<00:02:36.090> button

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
button its first so I can put a button

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.500 
button its first so I can put a button
right<00:02:36.750> back<00:02:36.930> here<00:02:37.200> and<00:02:37.790> it<00:02:38.790> would<00:02:38.940> be<00:02:39.060> used<00:02:39.330> for

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
right back here and it would be used for

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.120 
right back here and it would be used for
that<00:02:39.630> sign<00:02:39.870> now<00:02:40.260> when<00:02:40.440> you<00:02:40.530> place<00:02:40.709> a<00:02:40.739> button

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
that sign now when you place a button

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.860 
that sign now when you place a button
make<00:02:41.310> sure<00:02:41.459> it's<00:02:41.580> directly<00:02:42.060> behind<00:02:42.299> it<00:02:42.690> and

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
make sure it's directly behind it and

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.610 
make sure it's directly behind it and
that<00:02:43.830> it's<00:02:43.950> only<00:02:44.130> separated<00:02:44.400> by<00:02:44.730> one<00:02:45.000> block<00:02:45.620> so

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
that it's only separated by one block so

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.199 
that it's only separated by one block so
now<00:02:47.010> when<00:02:47.160> I<00:02:47.220> press<00:02:47.370> the<00:02:47.549> button<00:02:47.819> is<00:02:47.940> going<00:02:48.150> to

now when I press the button is going to

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.000 
now when I press the button is going to
do<00:02:48.330> the<00:02:48.480> same<00:02:48.510> thing<00:02:49.110> that<00:02:49.230> the<00:02:49.290> sign<00:02:49.650> did

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
do the same thing that the sign did

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.100 
do the same thing that the sign did
except<00:02:50.910> i'm<00:02:51.060> going<00:02:51.209> to<00:02:51.269> be<00:02:51.360> directly<00:02:51.810> above

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.530 
except i'm going to be directly above
this<00:02:52.349> button<00:02:52.860> where<00:02:53.069> that<00:02:53.250> sign<00:02:53.489> is<00:02:53.760> so

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
this button where that sign is so

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.089
