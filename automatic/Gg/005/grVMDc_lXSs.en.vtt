00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:09.950
 installing a regular bk 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:15.059
 wagon on the VAZ 2114 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:17.640
 shoot video because there is no such network 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.510
 direct video on the installation there is already 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.990
 the description is very simple 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:26.130
 Of course everyone wants to see how 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:30.150
 Can you set yourself 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:33.450
 install it because once again 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:37.440
 pay for installation upon purchase 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.899
 inexpensive device does not want to, and so 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:44.219
 we tell it becomes very simple 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:46.920
 you just need to read the instructions there 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.489
 all written red to red black to 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:54.750
 black 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:01:00.420
 so remove from the panel of its connector for 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:03.830
 Beck here I was he zanykanny 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:07.500
 for the dashboard had to climb 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:09.090
 at first I was afraid that he was not here but 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:15.230
 everyone has it absolutely 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:19.250
 and so here this connector here different colors 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:22.190
 here and according to the instructions you can do 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:25.850
 be I somehow cloudy did like 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:29.020
 kettle if someone send me will 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:34.370
 glad and so clamps are pressing 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:37.760
 in order of color red from under 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:41.690
 red and white alphabet to orange honestly 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.940
 builds red and white from b to a to 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.130
 orange 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:49.370
 to the very wire that goes 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.270
 fitting further black to black white to 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:55.640
 to white 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:02:00.280
 what else do we have red white with 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:04.540
 orange or red on here it is for me 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:08.470
 here we are, in principle, and everything is further 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:11.170
 stretch the gray cord of the court 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:16.250
 get to open where it happened 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:22.910
 open stretch gray court cord and 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:25.340
 in the second in the second nest I have it 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:29.740
 seemed upside down in most but 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.740
 turned over here look 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.950
 gray bent to teach me bent 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:38.620
 to 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:42.140
 well the lid closed some 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.489
 spend right from here and lead ugly 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:48.519
 it turns out here on the side 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:51.439
 that everything before you do something 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:52.819
 disconnect from the mass of the battery then 

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:58.639
 that he will jump you run 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:03:01.939
 possible firmware mass flies why do you need 

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:05.000
 it is generally necessary 

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:12.129
 Basically read all the instructions 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:16.639
 written in detail is clearly further called 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:18.799
 you are afraid seemingly work i had 

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:22.879
 at installation one kosyachok 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:25.280
 I thought at first that it was me that you 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:29.209
 out of order in the car were bad 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:33.500
 the clamps are clamped here 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:35.930
 I disappeared on the bumps 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:39.140
 mass that is, he did not pick and as if 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:41.980
 I joined again I sinned on anyone 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:45.500
 On the generator, she still checked everything 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:48.680
 everything was fine the last thing 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:52.040
 of course decided to watch the connection itself 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:54.230
 really wire tapped guarded 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:58.040
 daddy everything again reaped me mass like 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:04:01.959
 we talk here everything works everything 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:07.880
 great so the functions are the same 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:10.430
 temperature voltage generator produces 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:13.120
 but the generator is on and the voltage is here on 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:15.560
 package that is deceptive 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:19.700
 because if you are a multimeter 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:22.610
 check engine cabin voltage 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:26.030
 it will be the difference with what will be 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:28.060
 show me like this again 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:31.560
 rechecked 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:34.700
 tension turns 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.700
 momentum it all fits 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:44.289
 4 throttle 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:47.680
 zero percent but it is well known 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:49.310
 gas accelerator pedal push the show 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:53.480
 by what percentage 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:56.530
 you clicked on me until 90 reaches want 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.530
 should go up to 100 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:02.480
 warmer will understand until 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:06.220
 does not bother me well gives sensitivity 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:08.000
 Of course the car needs to get used further 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:10.640
 distance traveled 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:14.180
 or expense now at the moment 

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:20.810
 idle expense i have at here 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:27.530
 such a turn there turns me 85 thousand 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:29.810
 I'm 98 get 9 8 liters distant 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:33.470
 liters milliliters of 2 liters of the rudiments 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:35.070
 ok think speed is now set 0 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:38.220
 in place 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:41.270
 There is no error code. By the way, you can 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:45.030
 wash engine temperature here 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:47.510
 look 59 shows we look 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:47.510
 here i have 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:06:00.740
 97 accurately accurately show 

00:05:54.530 --> 00:06:00.740
 tension went running again by the way 

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:06.650
 debunking myths at idle 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:08.640
 rechargeable batteries are best charged 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:11.540
 of course turn off all 

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:17.430
 instrumentation all ducts so 

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:22.440
 approximate mileage floor while I have 

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:30.630
 just want to believe okay gasoline time 

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:34.320
 how much we are already inconvenient by the way I'm 

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:36.600
 I will tell about those who will buy 

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:39.210
 a little awkward in terms of what 

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:44.130
 the amount of petrol filled 

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:46.760
 expose yourself will not deceive you 

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:50.400
 on the float which is a gas tank 

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:52.920
 will show what you yourself quickly 

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:56.430
 everything is done right refueling don't lose 

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:57.990
 the time you set and everyone will know well 

00:06:56.430 --> 00:07:00.700
 all here 

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:03.160
 put your fingers on top 

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:07.510
 don't subscribe for a few videos yet 

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:13.740
 so good luck everyone good luck to all owners 

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:13.740
 AvtoVAZ especially at VAZ 2114 bye
