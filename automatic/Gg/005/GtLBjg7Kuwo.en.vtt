00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 in this customization there are people who 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.660
 enchants with sports filter because of 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.030
 of the motor snorer and sport was to see until 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:13.590
 which point the filter also interferes with 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:15.719
 performance of the car that just 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.770
 buying a zero car has already changed the 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.710
 air filter 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.510
 The owner of the 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.580
 workshop explains the difference 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.070
 the original car movie it's a role 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.699
 and is played on average every 5 to 10 thousand 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.070
 kilometers 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.500
 the sports film he has four to 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.809
 six layers of cotton and drunk an oil 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.540
 special and retains the dirt then you 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.309
 washes it according to the manufacturer every 80 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.680
 one thousand kilometers 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.260
 the common filter has straight lines and is 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.110
 of course the sports filter has colors 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.270
 strong that can be straight or cone 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.020
 in this case it is apparent in the 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.329
 motor 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:55.920
 the other goes in the same box as the original and 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:58.640
 is called boxing what he loves and since 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.280
 the first car he made a grunt more 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:05.159
 thick was not a yummy taste deal 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.229
 with a brat like né practical test 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.170
 this is the sound of a filter motor 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:13.159
 common 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:16.170
 now the same car a sports filter 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:18.990
 the snoring gets stronger with the promoter 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.360
 breathe more the machine helps 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.030
 understand that it passes freely through 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.100
 safe duct ball up there when 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.970
 places a common filter on the air passage 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:32.130
 decreases so much that the ball undoes more 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.350
 the filter was the sport of flow if 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.040
 keeps to the point of holding the ball there 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.780
 on high 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.299
 the engine at the time he pulled it to 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.460
 inside it if it pulls with coherence 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.850
 Do not increase the friction can 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.549
 the main problem is the 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:51.119
 abrasive part of the dust that will 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:53.490
 the more the engine gains power some 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.170
 they say yes an original car a gain 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.930
 average of two or three horses depending 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.219
 others say that not always in the 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.200
 time you put a filter on it. 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.140
 begins to listen if with thicker gives 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.630
 impression that the car is walking more 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.330
 presenting less 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.610
 What happens is that the engine as it was 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.739
 programmed electronically to receive 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.050
 a certain amount of air when 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:18.530
 more than it should performance 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:20.330
 engines can be damaged 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.370
 prepared is another story 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:25.040
 the mechanic makes the adjustment of the 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.260
 ideal blend of fuel and 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.690
 taking into account the sport filter 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.060
 prepared car as in this case has a 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.220
 modified turbine 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:38.630
 it yields an average of 20 and 25 horses 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:44.900
 unlike the original is a question 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:46.790
 of taste is not a sports filter and a 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.519
 many accessories for your 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:52.580
 car you find the auto show sport 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:54.610
 from 21 to 24 November in the anhembi in são 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.610
