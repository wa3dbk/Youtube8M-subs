00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 how about friends like they are calm and 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:06.680
 jesus felix these great healthy and the 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.680
 region 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.590
 We are looking outside and it is very 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:17.410
 peculiar billboard that is called 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:19.270
 pixels or pixels or good that movie 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.759
 where he tells us the story that 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.110
 humans send a message to space 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:24.609
 for aliens but they treat us 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.830
 these convert this threat into 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:28.420
 video game issues that I said in 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.490
 a very entertaining movie by 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.739
 be about videogames but really 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.570
 it's a movie that happened to me a lot is 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:37.059
 a movie of the type adam sandler 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.220
 only where then the comedy is at 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:41.800
 Adam Sandler the actors are nothing adam 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.270
 sandler and the argumentative and all the 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.860
 plot of the adam room movie 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.050
 sandler has its redeemable moments 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.760
 where good there are things like interesting 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.250
 and he does not think of studying them only 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.110
 tell them about this movie I do not 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.449
 liked what I expected a lot more 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.460
 interesting but to come from darbo 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:59.500
 join then your movies do not happen to 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.539
 be more than a Sunday movie that 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.160
 precisely fine Sunday so the 

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:04.360
 rating that would result in the pixels 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.890
 is a rating of three out of five 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.539
 stars for the same thing that I was saying 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.030
 it's not a movie they congregate 

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:11.530
 although neither the gamers are going to enjoy and 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.540
 that undoubtedly some minute electro 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.330
 10 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.950
 worst of videogames but good I give them 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.330
 the benefit of the doubt you see 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.980
 leave me your comments surely 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.350
 many of you will like it but me 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.720
 the particular thing like that left me owing 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.760
 and expect some much bigger but 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.100
 Well, I did not feel like the time I saw 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.540
 mortal kombat annihilation so I felt 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.190
 when I saw that movie like I do not know 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.229
 I felt like that when I saw pixels so 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.910
 well that's my only opinion of this 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.530
