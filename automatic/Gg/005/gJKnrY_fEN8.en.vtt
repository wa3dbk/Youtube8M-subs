00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.610
 how about friends welcome to ch fitness 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.200
 Mexico speaks to them uber this time 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.700
 let's talk about the four 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.000
 ways to recruit muscle fibers 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.920
 Type 2 will be remembered in the video 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.770
 previous we talked about the types of fibers 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.020
 muscles that exist will be important 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.420
 remember a couple of points of the headdresses 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.699
 in the previous video 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.289
 these are first that the body recruits 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.449
 the muscle fibers in an order 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.580
 determined starting with the cybers 

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:37.590
 muscle type 1 or red or of 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.960
 slow shrinkage which are fibers 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.829
 Muscles aimed at resistance 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.660
 and to the endurance and depending on the strength 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.300
 that they have to generate or from 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.430
 force or power requirement 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.579
 that they have to generate the muscles 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:58.470
 is that they activate muscle fibers type 2 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:01:00.720
 or of fast contraction of white color 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:03.570
 and the difference between the fibers 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.880
 muscle type 1 and type 2 is that the 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.310
 Type 1 have very little to suffer 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.560
 hypertrophy to grow while the 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.350
 type 2 muscle fibers or 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.020
 fast contraction are more optimal or more 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.730
 ideal for growing and suffering hypertrophy 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.160
 to grow muscle mass 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:23.200
 well in this video as I said we are going to 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.540
 talk about the four ways to recruit 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.280
 this type of muscle fibers the type 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:31.070
 2 fast shrink 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.700
 the first way that exists for against 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:36.280
 for 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:39.009
 activate contraction muscle fibers 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:43.600
 fast type 2 is to work with weights 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:46.509
 great when working with weights of 85 per 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:49.679
 hundred or more of the maximum amount of 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:53.530
 weight that you can do in an exercise 

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:57.280
 puts a lot of stress on the muscle and what 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:02:00.159
 obligate or what you believe is a need for 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:03.280
 activate many muscle fibers for 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:07.030
 can load that these amounts of 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.830
 weight is to say is both the weight is so much 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.530
 the resistance that muscle fibers 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:14.230
 Type 1 is not enough or not enough 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.750
 to be able to break that resistance or to 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.459
 load that weight and that's why it has 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.819
 the body that activate muscle fibers 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:24.579
 type 2 and you have to activate a large 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:29.280
 amount of muscle fibers to be able 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:32.540
 load those weights the following way to 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:36.240
 recruit muscle fibers type 2 is 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.640
 work with 70 75 percent of the 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.540
 maximum weight that you can load in a 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:45.579
 exercise 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:49.150
 this weight range has been known 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:51.790
 usually as a range of hypertrophy 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:55.480
 work with this percentage or you're 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:57.640
 Weight amounts are placed in one in 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:02.019
 a number of repetitions within a 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:03.040
 8 to 15 reps series now 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:05.140
 because it 's l 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.629
 because it's known as a range of 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:10.810
 hypertrophy to work with this 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:14.650
 percentage of the maximum weight that you can 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:19.989
 upload is known as that because it's the 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:22.750
 optimal range of pd number amount of 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:25.120
 weight and the number of repetitions for 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.340
 create muscle mass 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.650
 but that does not mean it's the only 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:33.129
 make way to grow grow 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:37.299
 muscle is simply referenced 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:39.360
 which is the most optimal range to create 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:41.610
 hypertrophy 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.380
 so you do not have to have that belief 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.990
 that is the only way to suffer 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:48.450
 hypertrophy also working with much 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:50.940
 weight and few repetitions will be generated 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.680
 hypertrophy in the same way as 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.810
 working with very little weight but 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.890
 doing many repetitions equally 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:00.010
 hypertrophy is created 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:02.200
 but good the third point the third 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:06.520
 way to recruit muscle fibers type 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:08.890
 2 is precisely with little weight and many 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:11.800
 repetitions is to work with 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:15.070
 weights of around 50 to 60 per 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:19.079
 percent of the maximum amount or weight 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:22.470
 maximum that you can load in an exercise 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:24.449
 doing many repetitions also it 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:27.760
 activate muscle fibers type 2 

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:31.720
 this how it happens 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:34.930
 this is achieved from fatigue or from 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:39.040
 Fatigue or straining of muscle fibers 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:41.980
 type 1 that is to say perform many of 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:44.170
 many repetitions and multiple series 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:46.740
 always trying to get to the fault is 

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:50.560
 say to no longer be able to carry the weight 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:52.360
 or do more repetitions so that 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.890
 muscle fibers type 1 or 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.590
 slow shrinkage which are the ones that 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:59.440
 activate first get fatigued or get tired 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:01.690
 and that forces the body to activate the 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:04.900
 muscle fibers type 2 since the type 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:08.830
 1 are tired or fatigued 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:13.479
 the next way to recruit fibers 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:19.830
 muscle type 2 is to work with weight 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:19.830
 relatively moderate or medium 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:25.260
 but the emotion or the speed in the 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.870
 way of doing these repetitions or 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:30.990
 these exercises have to be jobs 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:32.760
 explosives that is to say it has to be a 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:35.940
 effort are called as effort 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:38.790
 dynamic are kind of is a kind of 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:40.890
 exercise but that performs a lot 

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:43.080
 power leaf ers that is to say perform 

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:46.710
 explosive repetitions do you with 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:48.750
 do with a great acceleration that does 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:51.570
 that maybe the weight is not very big 

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:54.960
 but that speed of that acceleration is 

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:58.140
 explosiveness believes use ccoo believes a lot 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:59.760
 stress on the in the muscle causing that 

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:01.680
 have to recruit many fibers 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:05.740
 muscles to be able to precisely 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:08.800
 achieve that explosiveness that acceleration 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:11.560
 good friends this has been four 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:13.630
 ways to recruit muscle fibers if 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:16.390
 have any doubt any comment by 

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:18.910
 please leave in the section below 

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:21.420
 and thank you very much for tuning in 

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:21.420
 we see the next
