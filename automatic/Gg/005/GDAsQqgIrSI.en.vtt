00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
premium it's hard to tell from the

nice<00:00:51.000> a<00:00:51.239> bit<00:00:51.390> reminiscent<00:00:51.989> of<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.320> LG<00:00:52.680> built

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890

nice a bit reminiscent of the LG built
Nexus<00:00:53.250> 4<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:53.520> certainly<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.539> iPhone<00:00:54.989> 4<00:00:55.350> but

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
Nexus 4 and certainly the iPhone 4 but

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
they have a nice quality to them all

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.150 
they have a nice quality to them all
right<00:00:57.989> like<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.199> aluminum<00:00:58.410> also<00:00:58.710> on<00:00:59.010> the

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
right like the aluminum also on the

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.920 
right like the aluminum also on the
sides<00:00:59.370> of<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.760> galaxy<00:01:00.180> s6<00:01:00.420> me<00:01:00.570> pick<00:01:00.719> it<00:01:00.750> up

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
sides of the galaxy s6 me pick it up

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.990 
sides of the galaxy s6 me pick it up
first<00:01:01.109> in<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.379> morning<00:01:01.559> it<00:01:02.190> feels<00:01:02.460> cold<00:01:02.789> and

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
first in the morning it feels cold and

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.299 
first in the morning it feels cold and
it's<00:01:03.149> sort<00:01:03.270> of<00:01:03.300> a<00:01:03.420> neat<00:01:03.840> feel<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.379> have<00:01:04.530> so<00:01:05.129> from

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
it's sort of a neat feel to have so from

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.010 
it's sort of a neat feel to have so from
a<00:01:05.369> design<00:01:05.460> standpoint<00:01:06.000> I<00:01:06.270> think<00:01:06.299> Samsung<00:01:06.659> is

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
a design standpoint I think Samsung is

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.510 
a design standpoint I think Samsung is
definitely<00:01:07.470> heading<00:01:07.799> in<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.369> right

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
definitely heading in the right

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.490 
definitely heading in the right
direction<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:09.360> other<00:01:09.390> big<00:01:09.780> gripe<00:01:10.020> that<00:01:10.320> I

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
direction the other big gripe that I

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.370 
direction the other big gripe that I
know<00:01:10.770> that<00:01:10.950> we've<00:01:11.280> shared<00:01:11.549> is<00:01:12.420> TouchWiz<00:01:13.110> I

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
know that we've shared is TouchWiz I

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.789 
know that we've shared is TouchWiz I
hated<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.280> bleeps<00:01:14.549> and<00:01:14.700> bloops<00:01:14.790> it<00:01:15.390> was

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:15.799 
hated the bleeps and bloops it was

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:18.410 
hated the bleeps and bloops it was
incredibly<00:01:16.799> bloated<00:01:17.040> like<00:01:17.820> me<00:01:18.030> after

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
incredibly bloated like me after

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.020 
incredibly bloated like me after
Thanksgiving<00:01:18.990> dinner<00:01:19.170> or<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:20.490> Super<00:01:20.880> Bowl

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
Thanksgiving dinner or the Super Bowl

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.300 
Thanksgiving dinner or the Super Bowl
thought<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.780> icons<00:01:22.170> were<00:01:22.380> kind<00:01:22.590> of<00:01:22.650> ugly

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
thought the icons were kind of ugly

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.789 
thought the icons were kind of ugly
TouchWiz<00:01:23.939> here<00:01:24.210> is<00:01:24.330> looks<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:24.630> be<00:01:24.799> completely

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
TouchWiz here is looks to be completely

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.070 
TouchWiz here is looks to be completely
redone<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:27.000> 40%<00:01:27.360> lighter<00:01:27.659> it's<00:01:27.900> certainly

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
redone the 40% lighter it's certainly

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.560 
redone the 40% lighter it's certainly
nice<00:01:28.259> there's<00:01:28.500> way<00:01:28.770> less<00:01:28.799> apps<00:01:29.280> installed<00:01:29.820> but

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
nice there's way less apps installed but

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.030 
nice there's way less apps installed but
now<00:01:30.659> it's<00:01:30.810> actually<00:01:31.079> useful<00:01:31.259> they're<00:01:31.740> not<00:01:31.829> try

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
now it's actually useful they're not try

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.830 
now it's actually useful they're not try
to<00:01:32.070> teach<00:01:32.400> me<00:01:32.579> how<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.729> wave<00:01:33.030> my<00:01:33.270> hand<00:01:33.509> over<00:01:33.659> the

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
phone to answer it they sort of give you

speaking<00:03:41.690> of<00:03:41.780> the<00:03:41.810> edge<00:03:41.989> if<00:03:42.799> you<00:03:42.890> want<00:03:43.010> to<00:03:43.070> use

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
speaking of the edge if you want to use

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.289 
speaking of the edge if you want to use
a<00:03:43.220> third-party<00:03:43.489> launcher<00:03:43.730> it's<00:03:44.060> kind<00:03:44.180> of<00:03:44.239> a

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:44.299 
a third-party launcher it's kind of a

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:46.000 
a third-party launcher it's kind of a
fun<00:03:44.480> fact<00:03:44.690> all<00:03:45.290> the<00:03:45.470> edge<00:03:45.590> features<00:03:45.769> will

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
fun fact all the edge features will

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:47.020 
fun fact all the edge features will
still<00:03:46.160> work<00:03:46.310> with<00:03:46.489> a<00:03:46.519> third-party<00:03:46.820> launcher

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
still work with a third-party launcher

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.270 
still work with a third-party launcher
so<00:03:47.690> I<00:03:47.750> will<00:03:47.930> say<00:03:48.109> out<00:03:48.260> of<00:03:48.290> the<00:03:48.410> two<00:03:48.590> I<00:03:48.620> think<00:03:48.950> the

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
so I will say out of the two I think the

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.640 
so I will say out of the two I think the
s6<00:03:49.640> edge<00:03:49.790> looked<00:03:50.239> cooler<00:03:50.600> but<00:03:50.900> I<00:03:51.109> don't<00:03:51.560> know

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
s6 edge looked cooler but I don't know

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.650 
s6 edge looked cooler but I don't know
how<00:03:51.829> useful<00:03:52.160> the<00:03:52.400> edge<00:03:52.549> is<00:03:52.820> gonna<00:03:53.000> be<00:03:53.209> yet<00:03:53.480> I

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660 
how useful the edge is gonna be yet I

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.990 
how useful the edge is gonna be yet I
mean<00:03:53.989> so<00:03:54.140> let<00:03:54.350> me<00:03:54.410> ask<00:03:54.560> you<00:03:54.680> this<00:03:54.799> what<00:03:55.700> are<00:03:55.970> you

mean so let me ask you this what are you

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.699 
mean so let me ask you this what are you
more<00:03:56.420> likely<00:03:56.690> to<00:03:56.870> do<00:03:57.079> to<00:03:57.260> check<00:03:57.410> the<00:03:57.500> time<00:03:57.680> on

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
more likely to do to check the time on

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:02.050 
more likely to do to check the time on
your<00:03:57.950> phone<00:03:57.980> go<00:03:58.370> like<00:03:58.790> this<00:04:00.609> and<00:04:01.609> we<00:04:01.850> put<00:04:02.000> the

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:14.269 
as a neat feature - I don't know how

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:16.150 
as a neat feature - I don't know how
much<00:04:14.389> I<00:04:14.569> would<00:04:14.720> use<00:04:14.930> it<00:04:15.109> it<00:04:15.620> definitely<00:04:15.950> looks

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 
much I would use it it definitely looks

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.440 
much I would use it it definitely looks
really<00:04:16.639> cool<00:04:16.820> though

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
really cool though

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:18.580 
really cool though
so<00:04:17.720> talking<00:04:17.989> to<00:04:18.079> the<00:04:18.139> guys<00:04:18.260> in<00:04:18.289> the<00:04:18.500> office

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
so talking to the guys in the office

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:19.779 
so talking to the guys in the office
here<00:04:18.979> and<00:04:19.160> I<00:04:19.190> think<00:04:19.340> this<00:04:19.430> would<00:04:19.549> have<00:04:19.609> boiled

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:19.789 
here and I think this would have boiled

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:21.640 
here and I think this would have boiled
down<00:04:20.000> to<00:04:20.060> at<00:04:20.450> least<00:04:20.539> for<00:04:20.750> me<00:04:20.840> if<00:04:21.049> somebody

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
down to at least for me if somebody

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.050 
down to at least for me if somebody
handed<00:04:22.010> me<00:04:22.070> both<00:04:22.310> phones<00:04:22.520> it<00:04:22.729> said<00:04:22.849> John

handed me both phones it said John

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.230 
handed me both phones it said John

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:31.580 
I picked the edge but if I was buying
one<00:04:30.330> and<00:04:30.510> I<00:04:30.630> had<00:04:30.750> to<00:04:30.840> put<00:04:30.990> my<00:04:31.080> own<00:04:31.199> money<00:04:31.229> behind

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
one and I had to put my own money behind

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.020 
one and I had to put my own money behind
it<00:04:31.860> their<00:04:32.040> 100<00:04:32.370> our<00:04:32.520> price<00:04:32.669> difference<00:04:32.940> from

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
it their 100 our price difference from

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:34.640 
it their 100 our price difference from
the<00:04:33.150> two<00:04:33.330> I<00:04:33.600> think<00:04:34.169> I<00:04:34.199> just<00:04:34.350> come<00:04:34.470> to<00:04:34.500> the

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
the two I think I just come to the

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.920 
the two I think I just come to the
galaxy<00:04:34.979> s6<00:04:35.250> it<00:04:36.060> looks<00:04:36.240> really<00:04:36.510> cool<00:04:36.690> in<00:04:36.810> its

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
galaxy s6 it looks really cool in its

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.170 
galaxy s6 it looks really cool in its
own<00:04:37.080> right<00:04:37.290> doesn't<00:04:38.010> have<00:04:38.100> that<00:04:38.280> sort<00:04:38.520> of<00:04:38.580> wow

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
own right doesn't have that sort of wow

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.150 
own right doesn't have that sort of wow
factor<00:04:39.240> I<00:04:39.630> guess<00:04:39.810> that<00:04:39.990> the<00:04:40.139> two<00:04:40.560> curved<00:04:40.889> sides

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 
factor I guess that the two curved sides

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.760 
factor I guess that the two curved sides
the<00:04:41.370> edge<00:04:41.460> has<00:04:41.669> but<00:04:41.910> still<00:04:42.570> does<00:04:42.750> exactly<00:04:43.199> the

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
the edge has but still does exactly the

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.920 
the edge has but still does exactly the
same<00:04:43.979> thing<00:04:44.280> so<00:04:44.460> I<00:04:44.790> want<00:04:45.300> to<00:04:45.360> test<00:04:45.600> whether<00:04:45.840> or

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
same thing so I want to test whether or

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:46.879 
same thing so I want to test whether or
not<00:04:45.990> the<00:04:46.199> edge<00:04:46.290> features<00:04:46.500> are<00:04:46.650> going<00:04:46.770> to<00:04:46.830> be

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:46.889 
not the edge features are going to be

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:48.140 
not the edge features are going to be
worked<00:04:47.070> at<00:04:47.160> extra<00:04:47.430> money<00:04:47.580> so<00:04:47.820> I<00:04:47.850> know<00:04:47.940> you<00:04:48.060> guys

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
worked at extra money so I know you guys

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.090 
worked at extra money so I know you guys
probably<00:04:48.210> have<00:04:48.479> that<00:04:48.600> question<00:04:48.810> too<00:04:49.169> but<00:04:50.070> I

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 
probably have that question too but I

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.010 
probably have that question too but I
can't<00:04:50.430> say<00:04:50.580> first<00:04:50.790> impressions<00:04:50.880> I<00:04:51.510> would

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
can't say first impressions I would

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.590 
can't say first impressions I would
happily<00:04:52.470> use<00:04:52.800> these<00:04:52.979> phones<00:04:53.250> the<00:04:54.060> screen<00:04:54.419> is

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 
happily use these phones the screen is

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.750 
happily use these phones the screen is
awesome<00:04:55.139> the<00:04:55.560> phone<00:04:55.740> looks<00:04:56.040> ridiculously

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:56.760 
awesome the phone looks ridiculously

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.150 
awesome the phone looks ridiculously
powerful<00:04:56.940> I've<00:04:57.330> seen<00:04:57.540> no<00:04:57.810> lag<00:04:58.260> at<00:04:58.620> all<00:04:58.889> and<00:04:59.130> I

00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.160 
powerful I've seen no lag at all and I

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.620 
powerful I've seen no lag at all and I
haven't<00:04:59.340> ever<00:04:59.430> run<00:04:59.610> any<00:04:59.790> benchmarks<00:05:00.330> on<00:05:00.479> it

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
haven't ever run any benchmarks on it

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:03.230 
haven't ever run any benchmarks on it
again<00:05:01.620> I<00:05:01.650> still<00:05:01.949> want<00:05:02.220> to<00:05:02.280> test<00:05:02.580> you<00:05:03.060> know<00:05:03.150> how

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
again I still want to test you know how

different stresses that we do I want to

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.180 
different stresses that we do I want to

test battery life I will say though for

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.180 
test battery life I will say though for

with around 22% battery life 45 minutes
later<00:05:16.740> it<00:05:16.949> was<00:05:17.070> up<00:05:17.220> to<00:05:17.250> almost<00:05:17.580> 90<00:05:17.940> percent<00:05:17.970> so

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:18.419 
later it was up to almost 90 percent so

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:21.620 
later it was up to almost 90 percent so
it<00:05:18.600> does<00:05:18.780> charge<00:05:19.669> insanely<00:05:20.669> fast<00:05:20.940> didn't

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:21.630 
it does charge insanely fast didn't

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:23.240 
it does charge insanely fast didn't
charge<00:05:21.810> that<00:05:21.990> fast<00:05:22.199> wirelessly<00:05:22.710> and<00:05:23.130> of

charge that fast wirelessly and of

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:24.560 
charge that fast wirelessly and of
course<00:05:23.430> wireless<00:05:23.820> charging<00:05:24.060> is<00:05:24.240> built<00:05:24.449> in

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:24.570 
course wireless charging is built in

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:25.730 
course wireless charging is built in
with<00:05:24.750> pretty<00:05:24.900> much<00:05:25.050> every<00:05:25.289> standard<00:05:25.560> so<00:05:25.680> if

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 
with pretty much every standard so if

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:26.810 
with pretty much every standard so if
you<00:05:25.800> got<00:05:25.919> a<00:05:25.949> charge<00:05:26.160> for<00:05:26.280> patio<00:05:26.550> you<00:05:26.639> just

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:26.820 
you got a charge for patio you just

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:29.600 
you got a charge for patio you just
throw<00:05:27.600> it<00:05:27.750> on<00:05:27.870> it<00:05:28.020> and<00:05:28.710> charge<00:05:29.100> did<00:05:29.460> get<00:05:29.580> a

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610 
throw it on it and charge did get a

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:31.129 
throw it on it and charge did get a
little<00:05:29.820> warm<00:05:30.090> though<00:05:30.360> while<00:05:30.900> doing<00:05:31.080> the

little warm though while doing the

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:32.360 
little warm though while doing the
wireless<00:05:31.440> charging<00:05:31.710> so<00:05:31.860> I<00:05:31.889> want<00:05:32.130> to<00:05:32.190> keep

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:32.370 
wireless charging so I want to keep

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:35.060 
wireless charging so I want to keep
testing<00:05:32.750> testing<00:05:33.750> that<00:05:33.960> the<00:05:34.590> speakers<00:05:34.860> on<00:05:34.979> the

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:35.070 
testing testing that the speakers on the

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:37.100 
testing testing that the speakers on the
bottom<00:05:35.310> it<00:05:35.430> sound<00:05:35.610> pretty<00:05:36.000> solid<00:05:36.539> I'll<00:05:36.690> but<00:05:37.080> I

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
bottom it sound pretty solid I'll but I

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:38.480 
bottom it sound pretty solid I'll but I
did<00:05:37.260> find<00:05:37.440> when<00:05:37.560> I<00:05:37.620> was<00:05:37.710> watching<00:05:37.860> video<00:05:38.370> I'll

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:38.490 
did find when I was watching video I'll

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:41.029 
did find when I was watching video I'll
just<00:05:38.639> use<00:05:38.789> the<00:05:38.940> s6<00:05:39.690> edge<00:05:39.810> here<00:05:40.080> I<00:05:40.260> kind<00:05:40.770> of<00:05:40.889> held

00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:41.039 
just use the s6 edge here I kind of held

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:42.320 
just use the s6 edge here I kind of held
it<00:05:41.190> like<00:05:41.310> this<00:05:41.490> it's<00:05:41.760> sort<00:05:41.880> of<00:05:41.940> where<00:05:42.180> I<00:05:42.210> would

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:42.330 
it like this it's sort of where I would

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:43.879 
it like this it's sort of where I would
go<00:05:42.510> to<00:05:42.570> hold<00:05:42.870> it<00:05:43.050> and<00:05:43.200> my<00:05:43.560> fingers<00:05:43.860> were

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:43.889 
go to hold it and my fingers were

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:45.500 
go to hold it and my fingers were
blocking<00:05:44.400> a<00:05:44.460> speaker<00:05:44.789> but<00:05:44.970> I<00:05:45.180> can<00:05:45.360> probably

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:45.510 
blocking a speaker but I can probably

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:46.490 
blocking a speaker but I can probably
hold<00:05:45.690> it<00:05:45.810> the<00:05:45.870> other<00:05:46.020> direction<00:05:46.110> and<00:05:46.440> that

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:46.500 
hold it the other direction and that

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.070 
hold it the other direction and that
would<00:05:46.620> go<00:05:46.740> away<00:05:46.979> so<00:05:47.220> I<00:05:47.250> want<00:05:47.520> to<00:05:47.580> keep<00:05:47.700> testing

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:48.080 
would go away so I want to keep testing

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.930 
would go away so I want to keep testing
that<00:05:49.080> as<00:05:49.260> well<00:05:49.470> my<00:05:49.650> big<00:05:49.830> questions<00:05:50.190> that<00:05:50.700> I<00:05:50.729> had

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:50.940 
that as well my big questions that I had

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:52.400 
that as well my big questions that I had
going<00:05:51.150> in<00:05:51.360> and<00:05:51.630> I<00:05:51.720> want<00:05:51.870> to<00:05:51.930> sort<00:05:52.050> of<00:05:52.080> boil<00:05:52.289> this

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:52.410 
going in and I want to sort of boil this

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:55.270 
going in and I want to sort of boil this
down<00:05:52.470> for<00:05:52.800> you<00:05:52.950> build<00:05:53.639> quality<00:05:53.910> is<00:05:54.300> awesome

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:55.280 
down for you build quality is awesome

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:59.779 
down for you build quality is awesome
TouchWiz<00:05:56.280> is<00:05:56.930> infinitely<00:05:57.930> better<00:05:58.710> here<00:05:59.220> so<00:05:59.699> if

00:05:59.779 --> 00:05:59.789 
TouchWiz is infinitely better here so if

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:01.490 
TouchWiz is infinitely better here so if
you<00:05:59.940> were<00:06:00.030> sort<00:06:00.210> of<00:06:00.240> nervous<00:06:00.539> about<00:06:00.810> both<00:06:01.470> of

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:01.500 
you were sort of nervous about both of

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.439 
you were sort of nervous about both of
those<00:06:01.800> I<00:06:02.130> don't<00:06:02.580> think<00:06:02.760> you<00:06:02.849> really<00:06:03.000> have<00:06:03.270> to

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:03.449 
those I don't think you really have to

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:05.540 
those I don't think you really have to
be<00:06:03.570> any<00:06:04.169> more<00:06:04.440> sure<00:06:05.099> I<00:06:05.160> would<00:06:05.340> have<00:06:05.430> liked

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:05.550 
be any more sure I would have liked

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:06.830 
be any more sure I would have liked
expandable<00:06:06.000> storage<00:06:06.060> and<00:06:06.510> I<00:06:06.539> would<00:06:06.750> have

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:06.840 
expandable storage and I would have

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.180 
expandable storage and I would have
liked<00:06:07.050> you've<00:06:07.199> had<00:06:07.320> a<00:06:07.349> movable<00:06:07.710> battery<00:06:08.010> but

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:08.190 
liked you've had a movable battery but

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:10.189 
liked you've had a movable battery but
that's<00:06:08.370> not<00:06:08.610> here<00:06:08.910> you<00:06:09.090> know<00:06:09.120> that<00:06:09.570> going<00:06:09.960> in

00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:10.199 
that's not here you know that going in

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:12.290 
that's not here you know that going in
so<00:06:11.130> consider<00:06:11.610> these<00:06:11.729> phones<00:06:11.940> filled<00:06:12.180> they're

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:12.300 
so consider these phones filled they're

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.779 
so consider these phones filled they're
gonna<00:06:12.419> be<00:06:12.510> able<00:06:12.570> to<00:06:12.660> live<00:06:12.840> with<00:06:13.080> the<00:06:13.199> 32<00:06:13.560> 64<00:06:13.919> 128

00:06:14.779 --> 00:06:14.789 
gonna be able to live with the 32 64 128

00:06:14.789 --> 00:06:17.540 
gonna be able to live with the 32 64 128
gate<00:06:15.240> configurations<00:06:15.840> no<00:06:16.199> all<00:06:16.470> of<00:06:16.500> that<00:06:16.949> going

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:17.550 
gate configurations no all of that going

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:20.270 
gate configurations no all of that going
in<00:06:17.820> both<00:06:18.389> these<00:06:18.599> phones<00:06:18.780> seem<00:06:19.199> really<00:06:19.740> nice<00:06:19.979> so

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:20.280 
in both these phones seem really nice so

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:22.310 
in both these phones seem really nice so
far<00:06:20.520> and<00:06:21.210> I<00:06:21.300> think<00:06:21.510> I<00:06:21.570> could<00:06:21.630> see<00:06:21.840> myself<00:06:21.960> using

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:22.320 
far and I think I could see myself using

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.290 
far and I think I could see myself using
both<00:06:22.590> of<00:06:22.620> these<00:06:22.800> for<00:06:23.010> the<00:06:23.070> long<00:06:23.220> term<00:06:23.580> in<00:06:23.760> fact

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:24.300 
both of these for the long term in fact

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.000 
both of these for the long term in fact
after<00:06:24.780> first<00:06:25.110> impressions<00:06:25.530> I<00:06:25.620> think<00:06:25.800> I<00:06:25.860> would

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:26.010 
after first impressions I think I would

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:28.339 
after first impressions I think I would
probably<00:06:26.160> happily<00:06:26.729> sign<00:06:26.910> a<00:06:26.940> contract<00:06:27.419> to<00:06:28.229> use

00:06:28.339 --> 00:06:28.349 
probably happily sign a contract to use

00:06:28.349 --> 00:06:29.480 
probably happily sign a contract to use
one<00:06:28.590> of<00:06:28.620> these<00:06:28.770> phones<00:06:29.039> whether<00:06:29.220> or<00:06:29.310> not<00:06:29.370> you
