00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.850
 the dish we are going to learn today made 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:08.580
 success in the old days and it is 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.490
 one a dish that everyone likes 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.980
 eating always has and always ends up in the same 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.440
 Who ever was a party and ate 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.960
 a crazy meat sandwich we're going 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.650
 teach our special version of the 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.650
 From Rio 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.820
 I'm going to make the pressure stop because 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.309
 it has already cuisine here but the same 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.410
 People are already starting to give a sealed 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.170
 in the meat paranaense j panela 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.170
 Let's make with the pressure cooker that 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:47.550
 we throw some oil and cinnamon 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.979
 has no salt so far and how it has 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.409
 a piece of a pound I know to 

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:55.350
 two medium pieces for us to fry 

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:56.579
 Just because if you do not fry 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.239
 right 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.879
 she cooks before frying then loose 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:07.400
 much water and the intent of this trap is 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.400
 keep the liquid in the house and inside 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:34.490
 Kissing is from the flesh and it is good to be able to 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:36.530
 pressure cooker because it saws and 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.420
 catching the intention is usually high with 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.090
 it higher than we have traveled 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:44.920
 with well-sealed meat 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.920
 I'll return the other piece here. 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:55.399
 We added water and now I'm going to add 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:56.720
 a carrot these ingredients are 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:00.200
 optional 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.250
 why does not it give more flavor to the 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:08.030
 your broth 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:10.880
 o ei e an onion and the stalk of celery 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.330
 is essential to give the zygo flavor that 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.510
 Are you going to eat salt but are you going to stay? 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.780
 sensational 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:20.470
 I'll put a little salt back 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:24.500
 for the pan 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:27.110
 if I could fit in and we'll go 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.329
 leave here for 30 minutes because 30 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:32.150
 minutes I chose the soft cushion to 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:34.160
 do you can choose up to muscle to 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.140
 The only difference is that you're going to take 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.329
 more time to cook in the pan 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:41.299
 without pressure and stay tuned to the pot 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:44.180
 pressure because the water may be he 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:46.609
 can burn then little by little 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:50.150
 You come here to shake her. 

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:53.239
 If the water is there, it feels heavy and the 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.459
 30 minutes without forgetting that after 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:57.650
 start to sizzle start to generate here 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:59.890
 when it starts to sizzle 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:03.610
 we wait 30 minutes 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:09.280
 the legal catholic line for 30 minutes and 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:12.370
 the result is here we'll slice and 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:15.370
 do not despise this broth you can you 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:19.180
 will use a little of it in the rest 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:21.640
 of our preparation and the rest of it 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.480
 You can use it to make a risotto but 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.790
 opa 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:28.420
 You know that beef broth tablet? 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:30.730
 what you buy then this is the pure 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.280
 beef broth and is much tastier 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:36.640
 because it is done at home with their only 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:41.220
 fiber of the meat is in that sense then 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.220
 We're going to cut it out. 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:52.970
 and then you will be cutting her against in 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:57.040
 slices and herself if you are stirring 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:04:01.850
 with her after she cut, she's going to 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:03.890
 distancing myself I'm using this 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:06.770
 electric knife but nothing like a knife 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:09.110
 normal people do not just leave work 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:11.770
 easier and faster and has even 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.770
 quality 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:18.110
 The secret of good, crazy meat is 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:22.390
 seasoning then this is the last part 

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:25.490
 Come on, I'll play just a little bit of 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:28.490
 eye here I have four cloves of garlic 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.900
 I just fat and did not stay 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:33.020
 but you do the way you do 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:39.340
 like in your house minced advanced 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:39.340
 both the gold and the important matter 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:48.350
 then help us a one - two 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:51.410
 comes with the onion with the onion 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:54.230
 I kept some golden peppers 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:56.570
 I bought this movie so little 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:57.200
 of this size and I sinned where each 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:59.720
 course 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:03.050
 if you buy a large one mexico was 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:06.890
 of chili pepper , but the cool one here is 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:09.680
 leave colorful and after all good 

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:12.820
 Let's have a little fun 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:15.440
 still with marketing 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:17.870
 after all this smell 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:26.120
 Wonderful that stayed in your house, did you? 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:29.330
 add the minced meat and this is the 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:33.250
 meat will go crazy 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:33.250
 for the councilwoman, it's you, right? 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:38.830
 You know that broth that our house is 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:45.960
 Cooked, I'll play a little bit of it. 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:45.960
 here I cook a sauce sachet 

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:53.939
 we just think about the end result 

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:59.430
 I'm already super anxious, let's hit it. 

00:05:53.939 --> 00:06:01.560
 the salt is no longer a little pepper 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:03.090
 I'm using the pepper of the kingdom but 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:05.129
 You can use pepper from your 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:10.289
 preference may be pepperoni pepper 

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:13.590
 a pepper sauce like 

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:17.449
 let it rest for about 15 minutes 

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:17.449
 depending on your eye 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:23.460
 people look at the consistency that it 

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:26.009
 It's wonderful to put inside the 

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:28.800
 bread is the typical snack of those 

00:06:26.009 --> 00:06:32.340
 birthday parties before 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:34.740
 have a taste of childhood and last 

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:39.750
 after fire off I will play one 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:44.580
 little parsley mix everything 

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:47.129
 Very well, I'm ready. 

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:49.050

00:06:47.129 --> 00:06:50.819
