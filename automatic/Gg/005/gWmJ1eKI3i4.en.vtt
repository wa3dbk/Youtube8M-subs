00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
We are with Renault Captur.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Renault made a colorful entrance to the crossover
segment with the Captur.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.500
I wonder if its driving features are as colorful?
Let's investigate together.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I'm in the driver's seat of the Captur. 
The Captur in fact is Clio's elevated and longer version.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
But the appearance of the Captur if you ask
me it has much younger and rebellious design.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I think the daytime running LED's and bicolor
alloy wheel rims have a share in it...

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.000
The cabin of the Captur is established on simplicity. 
In here there is no button excess.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:54.000
There is one touchscreen as core assembly.
Here you can connect your mobile phone and use it, 
you can command the music system and reach navigation.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Underneath there is an area of A/C with very simple controls.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
The materials used in the interior is a bit hard but satisfies 
this segment's expectations therefore I can say it is reasonable.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:14.000
There is no bother about the spaciousness in the front. 
The rear seats offer reasonable knee and headroom 
if you are a medium height person.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
But if you are tall then you may have some trouble.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:30.600
As I have said it previously at the Nissan Note review, 
you can slide the rear seats and enlarge the boot. 
This is very useful for a family car and for young families.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Now came the time for the Captur's engine and its driving features.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:43.000
The car that I'm driving is called TCe90 and
it has 3-cylinder turbocharged petrol engine.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:54.600
It is a 0.9-liter engine, it is rather small but  due to a small 
turbocharger it develops power on the level of 
1.4 liter naturally aspirated engine.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
TCe 90's maximum power is 90 HP and 
its maximum torque is 135 Nm.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:08.000
This engine can be purchased with 5 speed manual gearbox only. 
But they have a very good association and for me there is no trouble.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:20.500
You can drive the Captur very easily. 
The clutch pedal is soft, the gear changes are solid but easy to use. The steering is also soft and easy to use.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:27.000
The Captur's engine power is sufficient if
you are not expecting more you will be happy with it.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.000
But you must accept that it is a bit sluggish 
on highway speeds and rapid accelerations.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Although the Captur's engine is small, when you want to accelerate,
if you are patient it will give you satisfaction sooner or later.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:50.000
Even though it is turbocharged due to its
small capacity engine you do not get the torque you want.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
This of course makes you cheek by
jowl with the gear lever in town usage.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
I'm happy with the frugality of this engine.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:12.000
I have been driving this car for 200 km and have performed 
acceleration, even drove it with performance and still the fuel consumption on average is 7,5 liters.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.600
And it is in your hands to lower this, I can
tell you that you can cruise with 6,5 or 7,0 liters average.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Of course there is a benefit of ECO mode in this too. When you press the ECO button behind the gear lever this system comes into play.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:33.000
It shuts the engine when you stop and it also
dulls the reaction of the throttle a bit.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
In other words it answers you slowly even
if you ask for rapid response.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
By this way the fuel consumption can be controlled a bit more.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.000
The suspensions on smooth surfaces are good.
But on rough ground it works a bit noisily.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.000
If you don't want to be bored you can raise
the sound of the music and filter it.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:00.000
The main difference of the Captur from other
cars is that its seats covers are zipped and can be taken off.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:07.000
This way you are a rid of the worry of spending
money and going to auto cleaners for dirty seat covers.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:14.000
When you want you can take it off, wash it
in the washing machine and put it back. This is very good.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Although the Captur's driving features are
not as colorful as its appearance it is still quite colorful.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:30.000
If you do not want this entry level version of 0.9 but 
thinking of automatic gearbox version then you can think of 
1.2-liter petrol engine or 1.5-liter diesel engine version.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000
See you...
