00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.799
 December I'm I'm wrong I 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.600
 it's already December and that's how one month 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.600
 I really like what it would be like 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.240
 October and November December and love 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.300
 these months of truth I love those months I 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.970
 I think they are the best months 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.830
 to do better things and good we go 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.840
 us to do nice things 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.090
 I would like to know if you are celebrating 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.860
 Christmas if you celebrate the New Year 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:30.480
 since here in Mexico it is customary 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:32.250
 of it in I not special because I know it is 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:35.400
 very difficult to be with the family too 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.440
 and be celebrating all together 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.940
 because then we always have problems or 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.860
 there is always some problem that makes 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.960
 instant to the family but good because 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.020
 have mine since I do love 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.270
 celebrate and I think I've found a lot 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.330
 more family among friends than the one 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.010
 they had and well do not forget to know that 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.140
 the family may not always be where 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.880
 wherever you want them to be but it's going to 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.250
 be always in your heart and always 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.870
 now as well as this is one more video 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.200

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:05.940
 of joy for that reason to wish you well 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.660
 always nice that when they start I 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:11.100
 it seems that they start on the 16th then 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.510
 good is a total madness the holidays 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.460

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.050

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:23.130
 someone knows about another country that is punch 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.650

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.810
 so they call it differently in their 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.090
 another country here please tell me how 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.130

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.870

 different states prepare it from another 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.660
 because in December we form of 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:07.860

 they make dinner I would like to know what 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.860
 they prepare their family of course because 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.450
 I do not think you prepare unless I 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.330
 I would like to know if you are preparing your 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:28.100

 Literal literal bear but good to me 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.280
 I would like to know that if you have 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:47.910
 preparations for these dates that are 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:49.790
 very comparable because of issues 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.380
 religious folk and so on 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.900
 philosophical et cetera etcetera maybe 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.350
 they even exercise some religion that does not 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.810
 is 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:01.400
 to celebrate but I know that to celebrate is 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:03.560
 so that they do not see it as much as a 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.260
 a tradition or something like that we do not 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.730
 begins to celebrate but rather as 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.860
 something to meet with your beings 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:12.470
 dear ones and that's why I like it very much 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:14.930
 December because then you meet with all 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:17.870
 Your family receives albert gifts 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.940
 you get hugs and everything you want and 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.709
 maybe even once a year but 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.750
 it's so cool it 's so cool and I've 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:25.220
 enjoyed many December also as 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.050
 many things have happened to me can be 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.509
 December but we do not come to talk about 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.050
 This talk more than anything everything 

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:34.259
 cool 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:36.979
 so then well guys I know it is 

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:39.629
 a little hard I know how that for god 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:41.819
 read game but they are congratulating me today 

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:44.159
 etcetera is that you care about me 

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:46.139
 course and I would like to know what is it 

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:47.430
 that are going to repeat what is going on 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:49.080
 to do if they are going to do dinners and they are going to go 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.060
 with her boyfriend if they are going to go with his girlfriend 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.919
 they are going to leave with the aunt with the cousin 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:56.310
 with the dog et cetera et cetera or they go 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:58.680
 to spend a Christmas or a new year alone 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:00.539
 well, it's something like typical and such 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.220
 let's say, well , good devil of the 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:03.900
 people who leave who want to be 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.270
 alone is because they want to be alone 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.909
 I think it's when at those dates it's 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:11.340
 when we are more conscious not when 

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:14.610
 it's like hell he's going to be alone 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:15.990
 does not invite invites it because it's not that ugly 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:18.990
 be happening alone when everything is 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:21.509
 enjoying but good many many 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:22.949
 thanks we are equal eleven thousand 

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:24.590
 subscribers and has not yet risen in 

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:27.020

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:29.420

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.790

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:35.510

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:37.550
 saying that well I return more than 

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:40.220

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:52.490
 because every problem that happens to me is like 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:55.160
 something that makes me stronger is like no 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:56.800
 power you do not always have to learn from the 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:59.060
 mistakes and of course the problems 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.830

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:03.440
