your deportation well the reason being

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.760 
your deportation well the reason being
is<00:01:43.430> because<00:01:43.790> they're<00:01:44.240> saying<00:01:44.479> that<00:01:44.770> criminal

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
is because they're saying that criminal

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.530 
is because they're saying that criminal
charges<00:01:45.800> that<00:01:46.250> I<00:01:46.369> have<00:01:46.700> which<00:01:46.940> I've<00:01:47.180> dealt

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
charges that I have which I've dealt

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.510 
charges that I have which I've dealt
with<00:01:47.690> the<00:01:47.840> court<00:01:48.110> I<00:01:48.259> was<00:01:48.350> punished<00:01:48.800> but<00:01:49.430> I

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
with the court I was punished but I

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.389 
with the court I was punished but I
think<00:01:49.759> it's<00:01:50.050> more<00:01:51.050> to<00:01:51.080> do<00:01:51.380> with<00:01:51.410> association

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 
think it's more to do with association

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:54.460 
think it's more to do with association
with<00:01:52.550> people<00:01:52.850> that<00:01:52.970> I<00:01:53.000> associate<00:01:53.270> with<00:01:53.509> with
