 hello, I'm anja from molly again 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.480
 mops and accessories for dog and man because 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.670
 i also custom business for yours 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.790
 Of course, I will go round yes 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.880
 Often asked how do I measure my dog 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.460
 right and that's why I want that 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.340
 explain to you today exactly because it is 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.930
 actually just as easy as I have 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:30.470
 My model brought 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:34.140
 that's not how we measure that 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:38.969
 now a very good boxing in the 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:42.149
 come and if possible stand 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.750
 Okay, so first let me tell you 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:48.629
 need the band a normal measure 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:50.789
 of course, the dog should stand 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:57.230
 girl stops to stand 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:01:00.649
 we need the measure once when standing 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:05.010
 I said it's easy cut 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:08.640
 as well as taking tape measure and determine 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:12.030
 once complete here the beginning 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.760
 So we have the first one 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.180
 important measure the tape measure should be loose 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.850
 Of course, let's take a note of that 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:26.970
 as I said we need three measures then 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:31.950
 Do we need this measure that would be 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:34.619
 now at her 26 inches once over 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:38.790
 the back over it because I have to 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:42.990
 determine because this measure namely then 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:47.909
 for the third time around here 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:52.110
 Breast abuts so I have three times 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:54.630
 The measure june actually finds that too 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.540
 relatively simple thank you for more 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.270
 ask as always and contact me 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:04.729

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.729
 heartfelt thanks to amy and I say today 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.979

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.080

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:21.190
