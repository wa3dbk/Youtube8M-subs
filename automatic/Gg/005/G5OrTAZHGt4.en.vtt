aggressive<00:00:04.799> but<00:00:05.520> that<00:00:05.730> is<00:00:06.089> the<00:00:06.120> risk<00:00:06.600> that<00:00:06.779> you

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
aggressive but that is the risk that you

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:08.570 
aggressive but that is the risk that you
run<00:00:07.230> when<00:00:07.440> you<00:00:07.560> throw<00:00:07.770> the<00:00:07.919> football<00:00:08.099> there

run when you throw the football there

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.730 
run when you throw the football there
because<00:00:09.000> an<00:00:09.179> incompletion<00:00:09.870> means<00:00:10.290> the<00:00:10.469> clock

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
because an incompletion means the clock

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.749 
because an incompletion means the clock
stops<00:00:11.160> and<00:00:11.490> that<00:00:12.000> hurts<00:00:12.679> bleeps<00:00:13.679> it's<00:00:14.250> gone
