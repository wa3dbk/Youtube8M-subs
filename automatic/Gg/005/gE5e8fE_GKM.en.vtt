00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
actually got my lines at hanging at the

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.920 
actually got my lines at hanging at the
back<00:01:40.590> of<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.830> moment<00:01:41.270> I'm<00:01:42.270> gonna<00:01:42.390> shorten<00:01:42.659> it

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
back of the moment I'm gonna shorten it

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.770 
back of the moment I'm gonna shorten it
up<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.200> about<00:01:43.310> 10<00:01:44.310> meters<00:01:44.700> so<00:01:44.939> it<00:01:45.330> should<00:01:45.600> go

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
up to about 10 meters so it should go

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.410 
up to about 10 meters so it should go
down<00:01:45.930> about<00:01:46.200> 6<00:01:46.790> deep<00:01:47.790> it<00:01:47.939> definitely<00:01:48.270> does

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
down about 6 deep it definitely does

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.510 
down about 6 deep it definitely does
work<00:01:48.450> there's<00:01:49.290> nothing<00:01:49.680> else<00:01:49.860> that<00:01:50.100> line

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
work there's nothing else that line

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:59.560 
work there's nothing else that line
could<00:01:50.729> be<00:01:50.759> I'm<00:01:50.970> gonna<00:01:51.150> nice<00:01:51.720> big<00:01:51.930> fat<00:01:52.200> fish
