familiar<00:00:21.750> refrain<00:00:22.170> from<00:00:22.650> all<00:00:22.890> Rick<00:00:23.100> which<00:00:23.340> is

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
familiar refrain from all Rick which is

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.279

that<00:00:23.640> he<00:00:23.880> was<00:00:24.029> simply<00:00:24.300> doing<00:00:24.570> what<00:00:25.019> others

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
that he was simply doing what others

that he was simply doing what others
were<00:00:25.529> doing<00:00:25.560> in<00:00:26.070> that<00:00:26.099> era<00:00:26.519> in<00:00:26.970> a<00:00:27.119> widespread

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
were doing in that era in a widespread

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.990 
were doing in that era in a widespread
fashion<00:00:28.050> which<00:00:28.199> of<00:00:28.349> course<00:00:28.380> is<00:00:28.769> true<00:00:29.250> but

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
fashion which of course is true but

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.519 
fashion which of course is true but
here's<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.390> bottom<00:00:30.660> line<00:00:30.689> for<00:00:31.140> me

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
here's the bottom line for me

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.250 
here's the bottom line for me
I<00:00:31.560> think<00:00:32.309> these<00:00:32.489> post-dated<00:00:33.360> confessions<00:00:34.050> as

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
I think these post-dated confessions as

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.110 
I think these post-dated confessions as
I<00:00:34.380> call<00:00:34.620> them<00:00:34.800> are<00:00:35.040> very<00:00:35.370> little<00:00:35.610> used<00:00:35.969> to

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
I call them are very little used to

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.360 
I call them are very little used to
either<00:00:36.360> fans<00:00:36.809> or<00:00:37.200> any<00:00:37.530> doping<00:00:37.920> authorities

either fans or any doping authorities

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.880 
either fans or any doping authorities

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
unless athletes go into specifics about

their past doping practices about who

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.920 
their past doping practices about who
supplied<00:00:44.340> them<00:00:44.579> with<00:00:44.610> these<00:00:44.910> substances<00:00:45.420> and

supplied them with these substances and

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.229 
supplied them with these substances and

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
authorities appear to be interested in

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.660 
authorities appear to be interested in
having<00:00:57.750> him<00:00:58.109> speak<00:00:58.530> behind<00:00:58.859> closed<00:00:59.129> doors<00:00:59.460> to

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
solid knowledge that they can take back

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.410 
solid knowledge that they can take back
into<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.229> sport<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:10.830> use<00:01:11.580> in<00:01:11.939> improving

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
into the sport and use in improving

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.050 
into the sport and use in improving

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
testing techniques and detection

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.850 
testing techniques and detection
techniques<00:01:15.479> alright<00:01:16.439> so<00:01:16.590> we<00:01:16.680> know<00:01:16.799> that

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
techniques alright so we know that

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.100 
techniques alright so we know that
doping<00:01:17.400> happened<00:01:17.790> quite<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:18.090> bit<00:01:18.390> in<00:01:18.600> that<00:01:18.630> era

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
doping happened quite a bit in that era

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.410 
doping happened quite a bit in that era
how<00:01:19.590> about<00:01:19.740> today<00:01:20.040> Bonnie<00:01:20.400> you<00:01:21.000> have<00:01:21.030> your

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
how about today Bonnie you have your

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.240 
how about today Bonnie you have your
finger<00:01:21.990> on<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.229> pulse<00:01:22.380> of<00:01:22.560> what's<00:01:22.770> going<00:01:23.070> on

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
finger on the pulse of what's going on

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.550 
finger on the pulse of what's going on
what<00:01:23.970> is<00:01:24.119> your<00:01:24.150> sense<00:01:24.570> of<00:01:24.750> how<00:01:24.810> much<00:01:25.020> doping<00:01:25.439> is

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
what is your sense of how much doping is

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.249 
what is your sense of how much doping is
going<00:01:25.799> on<00:01:25.950> now<00:01:26.130> I<00:01:26.540> think<00:01:27.540> it's<00:01:27.689> gotten<00:01:28.049> much

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
going on now I think it's gotten much

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.219 
going on now I think it's gotten much
harder<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:28.950> do<00:01:29.159> blood<00:01:30.060> doping<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:30.840> other

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
harder to do blood doping and other

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.830 
harder to do blood doping and other
forms<00:01:31.829> of<00:01:32.009> doping<00:01:32.490> on<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.970> widespread<00:01:33.540> scale

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
forms of doping on the widespread scale

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.890 
forms of doping on the widespread scale
that<00:01:34.259> we<00:01:34.590> saw<00:01:34.829> 10<00:01:35.280> 12<00:01:35.610> 15<00:01:35.820> years<00:01:36.090> ago<00:01:36.479> certainly

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
that we saw 10 12 15 years ago certainly

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.649 
that we saw 10 12 15 years ago certainly
has<00:01:37.799> it<00:01:37.979> been<00:01:38.100> eradicated<00:01:38.369> from<00:01:38.790> cycling<00:01:39.390> or

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
has it been eradicated from cycling or

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.920 
has it been eradicated from cycling or
other<00:01:40.170> sports<00:01:40.710> absolutely<00:01:41.579> not<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:42.090> I<00:01:42.720> might

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
other sports absolutely not and I might

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:43.819 
other sports absolutely not and I might
add<00:01:43.110> that<00:01:43.140> again

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
add that again

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.280 
add that again
cycling<00:01:44.340> always<00:01:44.579> gets<00:01:44.790> a<00:01:44.880> bad<00:01:45.060> rap<00:01:45.329> beat

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
cycling always gets a bad rap beat

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.960 
cycling always gets a bad rap beat
because<00:01:46.740> they<00:01:46.890> catch<00:01:47.189> a<00:01:47.280> lot<00:01:47.460> more<00:01:47.490> people

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
because they catch a lot more people

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.600
