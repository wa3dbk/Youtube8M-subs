00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:15.299
 with you there was one group that may 1 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:20.609
 become what we are petroleum jelly and i 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:23.960
 showed good to for our today 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.960
 from this collistar 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:30.720
 where am I going to show you now 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.000
 last time we talked to you about what 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.640
 we will have a pillar foundation and 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.079
 top to top will 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.829
 reinforced grillage but after some 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:43.050
 meetings we counted the money counted 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:44.969
 possible consequences and took another 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:50.760
 several solutions we decided to replace 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:52.559
 the tiger was learning from us suptically 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.010
 exposure temperatures you just 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.589
 put our 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:59.350
 5 centimeters wide foundation here on 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:03.039
 it is an artificial slag base 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:05.500
 which you just brought it pretty 

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:07.390
 solid foundation fails which we 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.090
 can use as carrier 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:14.520
 for our garage we can compare 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:18.250
 look here it is now 40 years old and she 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:22.300
 absolutely without trial where he shook 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.780
 I sat down on the stone here and our garage 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.900
 garage 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:29.830
 who will be worth it let's see 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:34.479
 here is our reason 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:39.330
 as we did it in general layers 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:42.210
 covered with slag and then rammed with water 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:45.850
 a smaller fraction was poured from above 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:48.040
 which as a result allowed us to achieve 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:52.030
 such a result well, and we fill the top 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:57.180
 already our belt that will be with us 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:57.180
 pretty massive too you see it and 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.770
 in general, it will give us good 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:06.430
 the foundation for our walls on top of the wall we 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:15.550
 we plan to fasten also with a belt which 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:17.670
 will give us the rigidity of the whole building here 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.920
 there will be tomorrow what all this slime 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.410
 ok well the most interesting where are we 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.480
 In fact, the remaining slag cannot he 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.340
 let's fit the foundation here 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.770
 let's see the remaining slag you decide 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.770
 use under the path 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:44.330
 produces produces arbitrarily up 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.280
 production 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.070
 who will be 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:16.840
 this interesting tool succeeded 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:18.790
 do this work in two days as 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:22.560
 perform these works will tell us our 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:24.550
 foreman head aka Oleg construction 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.860
 Oleg Hello but tell 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:29.830
 please keep your job secret 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:32.950
 did the tie for what 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:35.230
 and what you want to share say the most 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.570
 the main thing initially we thought that 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.040
 We built all the communications then 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.410
 turned out when a solid foundation on 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.890
 which will be the moon or femeli Vodicka 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:47.530
 beautiful how we hold laid 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.810
 communications water pipe sewage and 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.730
 the same wiring is laid 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.530
 cable under concrete that is, we decided 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.170
 give up the air to me like 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.480
 specialist and did did build and then 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:00.730
 disgrace some kind of aerial wired 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.320
 Victor more often please tell about 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.410
 work order like 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:07.209
 laid out a photo cover that why 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:10.420
 I pass all remove the excess layer 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:12.790
 make a soft layer of earth centimeters 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:15.370
 30-40 bases hard padu hard 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:18.160
 our pillow was made of slag 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:20.169
 again we weed out this slag after 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:23.050
 laying slag and T-shirt 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:26.740
 chose the horizon on which slope 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:28.690
 it turns out 5-6 meters of slope but this 1 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.419
 a cent then we did somewhere a half or two 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:34.900
 centering in the rout of colitis in one 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:36.940
 point there inlet yama yama done 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.470
 from brick to but there will still be a pipe 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:41.590
 before it should be made turbo 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:43.780
 the shutter is retracted but from above and as I understand it 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:46.240
 the lattice will need to put the lattice at 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:50.580
 us boil and dump about 50 and 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:54.379
 plates flat semi juicy decide. 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:56.819
 about laying screed what do you say 

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:58.979
 We stretch and these are all the rules that is 

00:04:56.819 --> 00:05:01.229
 life solution chick noticeable 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:03.810
 concrete mortar is a very important point 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:06.840
 when you stretched 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:09.389
 the next day is desirable in the morning bye 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:11.460
 the concrete is still damp the name of the book we will deliver 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:14.189
 T-shirts spending it again by. 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:16.169
 and afterwards we grind it all 

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:19.169
 I have some water 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:21.180
 again we add cement handsomes 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:24.030
 watches and we have notch speed this 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:26.580
 the dog has come or someone is a child 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:28.650
 inadvertently come the fashion did not reveal all 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:31.080
 it's an iron grind 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:33.990
 And it turns out such an effect as Mike 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.340
 not visible and we have a fleece surface without 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:39.389
 dimples without bumps 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:41.819
 Here you can see that after the lighthouse we 

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:46.190
 paper plane then it's all over the ground i 

00:05:41.819 --> 00:05:46.190
 put in a personal ask you guests 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:57.300
 thank you for the informative conversation 

00:05:52.279 --> 00:05:59.159
 Come cool some labor rubble 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:02.870
 sand and cement and you as a result 

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:02.870
 it will turn out so great 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:11.789
 well tell kirill throws 

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:20.449

 helped cooks free yourself up 

00:06:34.009 --> 00:06:46.660
 it was hard to help the right tool 

00:06:42.259 --> 00:06:46.660
 how a concrete mixer economical quit 

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:59.860

 you can not yet dig and how many 

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:16.729
 the area was 50 squares plus a walkway 

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:19.610
 Well, let's summarize what we have 

00:07:16.729 --> 00:07:22.400
 it turned out the filling of the foundation with us 

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:23.910
 went three days we fell asleep 

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:26.790
 6 

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:29.640
 bow their meter from the neck then two days 

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:31.800
 spent to bring the moto of the day

 and it took us two and a half days to 

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:39.330
 preparation of the solution pouring and screed 

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:42.000
 enough to fulfill this volume 

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:44.130
 works by two human forces with us
