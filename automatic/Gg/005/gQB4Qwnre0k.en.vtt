 educate tina the education site number 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:09.480
 one of Latin America let's work with the 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:12.030
 properties of the sum the sum of 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.540
 natural numbers are going to have three 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:19.140
 very important properties one is the 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:21.560
 associative property 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.410
 blue 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:27.400
 is activated another is the property 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.400
 commutative 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:35.760
 motivates 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:38.359
 and another is the property of the element 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.359
 the element 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.390
 neutral 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.629
 but let's start with the first the 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.519
 associative property tells me that if 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:51.100
 we have for example three numbers 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:54.899
 any one sum of three numbers 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:57.609
 any 15 + 3 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:02.170
 this can be done in any order 

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:04.309
 we can first solve this sum 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.820
 let's run 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:10.689
 today we can say that we prefer 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:14.470
 solve first 

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:17.580
 153 first we prefer to solve 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:20.040
 this sum from here 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:23.100
 whatever we do any 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:29.730
 sum that we choose we will reach the 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:35.910
 same result look 156 plus 39 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:40.320
 while 153 is 8 and 18 is also 9 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:43.500
 in a general way let's say that 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:46.490
 with any number that we 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.720
 let's work from the natural numbers 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.220
 let's do like this 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.840
 with any number we are going to 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:56.420
 represent with letters yes 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.899
 the number to the number of a number in 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:02.929
 number to a number and a number 6 of 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:06.500
 whatever form we associate we associate 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:09.229
 these sums we will reach the same 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:13.280
 result that's why we say that the sum 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:15.769
 meets the associative property then 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.019
 let's have the commutative that this 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:21.410
 it's also simple says that if we have 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:24.080
 two numbers for example the 5 a sum of 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:27.530
 the numbers 5 4 this is going to be the same 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:30.860
 that doing it in any order 5 4 is going to 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:33.110
 be the same as doing 4 5 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.750
 notice that in any case we come to 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:38.569
 that this is 9 good and this is also 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.760
 can represent generically with 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:44.000
 letters without this is going to meet for 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:46.730
 any number a number plus a 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.980
 number b whatever they are going to be equal 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.720
 to a number plus a number and this what 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:54.530
 can see anywhere if we have 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.880
 three little red balls and we add five 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.460
 we're going to have 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.590
 instead we have five first and then 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:02.069
 three we're also going to have eight is what 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.079
 same 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.760
 and finally we have the property of 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:08.459
 neutral element 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.709
 the neutral element of an operation with 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:14.879
 natural numbers is going to be that 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:17.999
 item that operated to another number follow 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:20.340
 giving me the same number for example in 

00:03:17.999 --> 00:03:23.790
 the sum the neutral element is going to be the 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:26.040
 number 0 because good just because 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:29.609
 If we to any number by 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:32.040
 example the 5 we add 0 we are going to 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:37.230
 stay with the same 5 and this is going to 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:40.409
 always happen if we add 9 or 19 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:42.030
 the neutral element is to add 0 

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:45.900
 we will continue to get the same 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:48.930
 number in question is to say 19 so 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:51.629
 we both say that the sum of numbers 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:55.379
 natural has the neutral element and is 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:59.250
 the 0 and so we can see then how it 

00:03:55.379 --> 00:04:01.949
 comply and what are the properties of 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:05.129
 the sum of natural numbers clear is 

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:06.950
 let's have the associative property the 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:10.330
 commutative 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.330
 of the neutral element 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:16.940
 educational I recommend you to the following 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.940
 videos so you can keep learning
