00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.529
 and we're not going to talk specifically about 

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:05.970
 playstation vita but yes we are going to 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.099
 name because I think it's pretty 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.080
 important to name it because we're going to 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.269
 name one of the best games of the 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.099
 sony's laptop catalog and I'm 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.870
 talking about gravity rush and why 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.599
 we talk about this title because it is 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.179
 the gravity ras of playstation vita will be 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:23.099
 remastered for playstation 4 to 

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:25.739
 less according to the classification system 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:28.229
 by ages that the game has registered in 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:30.419
 your data sheet the truth is that it is a 

00:00:28.229 --> 00:00:32.369
 title that personally seems to me 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:34.410
 of the best games that have appeared 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.030
 the in playstation vita for me is the 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.150
 second best game that has appeared in 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.760
 the console next to uncharted and the truth 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.530
 is that it's amazing how good that now 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.930
 this news comes out because we have 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.030
 come rumored for a long time 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.920
 it does not catch us by surprise 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.010
 It must also be said that in gravity 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.350
 traces was announced in 2013 but without 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.090
 mention and without mentioning in any 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.760
 platform is thought to reach 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.160
 playstation 4 and the truth is that 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.049
 obviously if it comes to playstation 4 the 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.489
 sequel of gravity crush users 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.290
 will have to enjoy the first 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.670
 delivery since there are very few 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.590
 they really have a playstation 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.270
 vita and have been able to enjoy the 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.890
 first installment that is a Japanese game 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.960
 that the truth is that I recommend them to 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.640
 everyone I repeat that 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.910
 to me gravity rush seems like a 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.070
 authentic jewel ojala playstation vita de 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:25.650
 I would have followed that path because 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.900
 they were on the right track the good truth 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.940
 for all those users who do not 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.710
 have the laptop and do not know 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.590
 the story they are and I would have prepared 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.770
 this adaptation that would return the title 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.120
 to a home console was initially 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.610
 an adaptation that was going to appear in 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:44.040
 playstation3 but good finally 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.770
 will come out in playstation 4 it is obvious is 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.470
 normal that they are and want to give more presence 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.330
 to your current desktop console 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.009
 Well, we'll be waiting to see if 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.330
 the news is official do not forget 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.000
 boys and girls that at the moment is a 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.040
 rumor will have to be gravity earrings 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.080
 ras is what we see an action game 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.360
 where we control the gravity the 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.759
 proposal is quite interesting 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.619
 gravity with our good protagonist 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.420
 our protagonist let's say you have 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.430
 different points of gravity that also 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.780
 we are controlling them us 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.090
 Awesome 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.130
 falling in any direction flying 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.470
 for the city a city that the truth 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.230
 is that it has a very comic aesthetic 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.850
 cool gravity ras I repeat that 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.980
 who has not proven his day in 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.620
 sony laptop this would be a great 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.330
 opportunity so good as this is 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.950
 bad for playstation vita because I 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.959
 I think the saga says goodbye to the 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.420
 sony laptop and I do not know if we're going to 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:38.250
 see gravity ras 2 on playstation vita or 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.350
 at least exclusively it certainly does not 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:44.069
 to be therefore there is confirmed once 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:45.930
 more that abandonment that sony has in his 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:47.760
 laptop a real shame because the 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.050
 playstation hardware vita always me 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.050
 It has seemed amazing
