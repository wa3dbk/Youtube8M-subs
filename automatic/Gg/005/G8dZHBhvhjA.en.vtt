00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.690
 Well, what if we talk about the quality of the game, I 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.540
 I would not say that it was the best game 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:12.509
 probably she was better in dedication by 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:15.900
 because there was a single team on the field 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.550
 and in some moments yes therefore to us 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.619
 lucky 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:22.859
 none of the guys fell out all tried 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:26.480
 what they have today to give everything 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:30.150
 the field fought for each other well and in the end 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:33.239
 defeated the leaders he ate that of course when 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:36.020
 very nice somewhere we were lucky but 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:39.600
 football, too, without luck 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:41.969
 so the final result is but 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.879
 quality can still in the game and not quite 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.430
 pleased but self-dedication guys exactly 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.219
 so how are they actually today 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:55.350
 tuned in to the game immensely for it 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:58.680
 thanks, they didnâ€™t rock 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:02.970
 the team is quite successful 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.920
 when defending at standards except 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.290
 today huddled a corner is the result 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.450
 to find some kind of visible 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:14.960
 the place is in the game 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.960
 at standard our team or just 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.619
 No, you know nothing at play fair 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.070
 I'll tell you but 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:28.080
 drew attention to the fact that feed on 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:30.930
 far barbell for anzhi a problem 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.790
 this and this was I would not say that the team 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.920
 strongly arrived physically they are in 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.259
 the same truth about the state 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.830
 everything goes learn from the signal which head 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.570
 fall here you know the action on on 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.920
 the correct signal sometimes gives 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.200
 opens a second wind 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.570
 and for some she does not come here 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.030
 today is the moment when all 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.860
 gave yourself a signal needed and it seems and 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.160
 runs more fights more 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:02:00.750
 and today the draft work as 2 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:02.280
 guys have done so here here 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.420
 I would like each game so they 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.420
 came out here is a dream 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:13.180
 odious andro the copper sabelnik 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:19.720
 just clamped 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:22.580
 Well, you know, it doesn't mean I didn't say that 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:25.550
 specifically, it is necessary to focus on the counterattack 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:28.370
 these words were not I first know to 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:30.500
 asked us for a problem out of 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.590
 dressing room we very often get 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.270
 for some reason, 1 minute after the break, goals 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.160
 here on this emphasis is made said guys 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:41.450
 please spend the first minutes 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:44.450
 collected this first second yes they are now 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:47.780
 climb they will try to save the game 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.970
 they need it but moments moments in them 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:55.630
 will be with us we will be with us 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:55.630
 run away and will have a chance to score more
