00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
is relatively simple I usually do that

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.770 
is relatively simple I usually do that
because<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.460> inside<00:01:41.850> is<00:01:42.030> like<00:01:42.210> you<00:01:42.390> know<00:01:42.509> very

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
because the inside is like you know very

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.330 
because the inside is like you know very
chaotic<00:01:43.040> so<00:01:44.040> once<00:01:44.340> you<00:01:44.490> open<00:01:44.939> it<00:01:45.380> the<00:01:46.380> tofu

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
chaotic so once you open it the tofu

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.600 
chaotic so once you open it the tofu
couldn't<00:01:47.759> died<00:01:47.939> in<00:01:48.119> there<00:01:48.299> um<00:01:49.020> but<00:01:49.470> this<00:01:50.340> part

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
couldn't died in there um but this part

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.490 
couldn't died in there um but this part
is<00:01:50.700> not<00:01:51.060> really<00:01:51.329> finished<00:01:51.630> yet<00:01:51.810> I<00:01:51.990> still<00:01:52.229> want

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
is not really finished yet I still want

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.590 
is not really finished yet I still want
to<00:01:52.590> add<00:01:52.710> something<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.250> it<00:01:53.399> maybe<00:01:53.759> to<00:01:54.479> the

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
to add something to it maybe to the

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.840 
to add something to it maybe to the
sides<00:01:54.869> but<00:01:55.770> this<00:01:56.100> is<00:01:56.280> what<00:01:56.430> I<00:01:56.460> look<00:01:56.670> like<00:01:56.700> right

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
sides but this is what I look like right

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.980 
sides but this is what I look like right
now<00:01:58.280> because<00:01:59.280> I<00:01:59.640> really<00:01:59.670> I'm<00:02:00.390> really<00:02:00.780> not<00:02:00.930> sure

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
now because I really I'm really not sure

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.580 
now because I really I'm really not sure
