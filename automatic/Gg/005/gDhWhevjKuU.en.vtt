yeah<00:01:49.710> you<00:01:49.770> have<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:49.979> be<00:01:50.130> patient<00:01:50.460> because

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
yeah you have to be patient because

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:51.950 
yeah you have to be patient because
otherwise<00:01:50.939> your<00:01:51.210> marshmallows<00:01:51.689> will<00:01:51.840> go

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
otherwise your marshmallows will go

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.810 
otherwise your marshmallows will go
everywhere<00:01:52.350> so<00:01:52.530> just<00:01:53.040> spread<00:01:53.310> that<00:01:53.340> butter

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
everywhere so just spread that butter

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.590 
everywhere so just spread that butter
around<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:55.100> start<00:01:56.100> adding<00:01:56.520> your<00:01:56.549> peeps<00:01:57.060> okay

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
around and start adding your peeps okay

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.050 
around and start adding your peeps okay
so<00:01:58.170> very<00:01:58.409> important<00:01:59.009> is<00:01:59.100> that<00:01:59.159> you<00:01:59.700> place

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
so very important is that you place

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.380 
so very important is that you place
these<00:02:00.329> into<00:02:00.960> different<00:02:00.990> little<00:02:01.649> color

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
these into different little color

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.179 
these into different little color
compartments<00:02:03.390> or<00:02:03.540> divisions<00:02:04.020> because<00:02:04.530> once

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
compartments or divisions because once

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.280 
compartments or divisions because once
this<00:02:05.430> is<00:02:05.549> melting<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.390> point<00:02:06.630> is<00:02:06.840> that<00:02:07.110> your

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
this is melting the point is that your

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.660 
this is melting the point is that your
Rice<00:02:07.530> Krispies<00:02:07.950> look<00:02:08.129> colorful

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
Rice Krispies look colorful

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.550 
Rice Krispies look colorful
and<00:02:08.819> if<00:02:09.149> you<00:02:09.270> mix<00:02:09.509> them<00:02:09.720> it's<00:02:09.959> gonna<00:02:10.200> be<00:02:10.379> like<00:02:10.530> a

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
and if you mix them it's gonna be like a

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.720 
and if you mix them it's gonna be like a
brown<00:02:10.950> color<00:02:11.310> so<00:02:11.550> try<00:02:11.910> to<00:02:11.970> not<00:02:12.390> make

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
brown color so try to not make

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.550 
brown color so try to not make
them<00:02:12.940> so<00:02:13.420> what<00:02:13.629> I<00:02:13.659> did<00:02:13.870> is<00:02:13.989> I<00:02:14.110> put<00:02:14.290> the<00:02:14.379> blue<00:02:14.530> on

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
them so what I did is I put the blue on

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.589 
them so what I did is I put the blue on
one<00:02:14.830> side<00:02:15.099> the<00:02:15.580> pink<00:02:15.819> on<00:02:15.970> the<00:02:16.000> other<00:02:16.209> and<00:02:16.540> then

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599 
one side the pink on the other and then

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:18.509 
one side the pink on the other and then
yellow<00:02:16.870> on<00:02:17.049> the<00:02:17.140> other<00:02:17.170> side<00:02:17.590> and<00:02:17.980> green<00:02:18.280> and

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:18.519 
yellow on the other side and green and

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:22.619 
yellow on the other side and green and
purple<00:02:18.580> in<00:02:19.120> the<00:02:19.239> middle<00:02:20.099> and<00:02:21.629> that's

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:22.629 
purple in the middle and that's

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:24.930 
purple in the middle and that's
basically<00:02:23.019> how<00:02:23.140> my<00:02:23.409> little<00:02:23.709> color<00:02:23.950> division

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
basically how my little color division

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.990 
basically how my little color division
looks<00:02:25.360> like<00:02:25.620> okay<00:02:26.620> so<00:02:26.680> now<00:02:27.099> you<00:02:27.159> have<00:02:27.549> to<00:02:27.730> start

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
looks like okay so now you have to start

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.830 
looks like okay so now you have to start
being<00:02:28.239> patient

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
being patient

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.229 
being patient
I<00:02:28.870> basically<00:02:29.260> mounted<00:02:29.950> mine<00:02:30.129> on<00:02:30.400> medium<00:02:31.090> to

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239 
I basically mounted mine on medium to

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:33.619 
I basically mounted mine on medium to
low<00:02:31.390> heat<00:02:31.420> it<00:02:31.900> was<00:02:32.110> on<00:02:32.290> three<00:02:32.890> I<00:02:32.920> believe

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:33.629 
low heat it was on three I believe

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:36.809 
low heat it was on three I believe
because<00:02:34.629> if<00:02:34.840> you<00:02:35.019> do<00:02:35.170> it<00:02:35.319> like<00:02:35.590> too<00:02:35.920> powerfully

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:36.819 
because if you do it like too powerfully

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:39.059 
because if you do it like too powerfully
if<00:02:37.269> your<00:02:37.540> heat<00:02:37.780> is<00:02:37.930> too<00:02:38.140> high<00:02:38.379> they're<00:02:38.860> just

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
if your heat is too high they're just

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:40.920 
if your heat is too high they're just
gonna<00:02:39.190> stick<00:02:39.519> and<00:02:39.730> it's<00:02:39.849> gonna<00:02:39.970> be<00:02:40.150> a<00:02:40.180> mess<00:02:40.360> so

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
gonna stick and it's gonna be a mess so

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.630 
gonna stick and it's gonna be a mess so
you<00:02:40.989> really<00:02:41.410> really<00:02:41.440> have<00:02:41.680> to<00:02:41.829> be<00:02:42.040> patient<00:02:42.459> and

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
you really really have to be patient and

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.479 
you really really have to be patient and
melt<00:02:42.940> them<00:02:43.150> as<00:02:43.390> slowly<00:02:44.019> as<00:02:44.319> possible<00:02:44.440> I<00:02:45.099> mean

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
melt them as slowly as possible I mean

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:47.400 
melt them as slowly as possible I mean
the<00:02:45.730> lower<00:02:45.940> your<00:02:46.269> heat<00:02:46.510> is<00:02:46.690> the<00:02:46.959> better<00:02:47.170> these

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
the lower your heat is the better these

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.740 
the lower your heat is the better these
are<00:02:47.470> gonna<00:02:47.709> melt<00:02:47.950> and<00:02:48.190> try<00:02:48.970> to<00:02:49.030> not<00:02:49.269> mix<00:02:49.540> them

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
are gonna melt and try to not mix them

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.780 
are gonna melt and try to not mix them
too<00:02:49.959> much<00:02:50.140> around<00:02:50.379> in<00:02:50.590> the<00:02:50.680> pan<00:02:50.890> because<00:02:51.069> since

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
too much around in the pan because since

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.339 
too much around in the pan because since
you<00:02:51.940> have<00:02:52.090> a<00:02:52.120> lot<00:02:52.329> of<00:02:52.390> different<00:02:52.750> colors<00:02:53.049> you

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:53.349 
you have a lot of different colors you

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:54.869 
you have a lot of different colors you
don't<00:02:53.440> want<00:02:53.650> them<00:02:53.769> to<00:02:53.890> mix<00:02:54.040> like<00:02:54.250> I<00:02:54.370> said<00:02:54.579> if

00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:54.879 
don't want them to mix like I said if

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:56.580 
don't want them to mix like I said if
you're<00:02:55.209> doing<00:02:55.480> it<00:02:55.569> with<00:02:55.660> only<00:02:55.750> one<00:02:55.930> color<00:02:56.290> then

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
you're doing it with only one color then

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.710 
you're doing it with only one color then
you<00:02:56.769> can<00:02:56.950> just<00:02:57.129> go<00:02:57.370> ahead<00:02:57.489> and<00:02:57.700> mix<00:02:57.790> it<00:02:58.060> as<00:02:58.269> well

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
you can just go ahead and mix it as well

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.470 
you can just go ahead and mix it as well
as<00:02:58.840> you<00:02:58.989> can<00:02:59.230> while<00:02:59.500> it's<00:02:59.650> melting

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.940 

since<00:03:04.480> the<00:03:04.660> peeps<00:03:04.959> that<00:03:05.140> are<00:03:05.319> on<00:03:05.470> top<00:03:05.739> or

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
since the peeps that are on top or

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.860 
since the peeps that are on top or
obviously<00:03:06.609> not<00:03:06.790> gonna<00:03:06.970> melt<00:03:07.209> as<00:03:07.390> fast<00:03:07.660> as

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
obviously not gonna melt as fast as

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.839 
obviously not gonna melt as fast as
those<00:03:08.049> on<00:03:08.230> the<00:03:08.319> bottom<00:03:08.650> what<00:03:08.829> I<00:03:09.069> did<00:03:09.280> is<00:03:09.549> I

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:09.849 
those on the bottom what I did is I

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:12.030 
those on the bottom what I did is I
basically<00:03:10.239> kind<00:03:10.660> of<00:03:10.780> tried<00:03:10.989> to<00:03:11.109> stir<00:03:11.410> within

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
basically kind of tried to stir within

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.069 
basically kind of tried to stir within
the<00:03:12.400> color<00:03:12.670> divisions<00:03:13.420> if<00:03:13.690> you<00:03:13.810> know<00:03:13.930> what<00:03:14.049> I

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:14.079 
the color divisions if you know what I

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:17.009 
the color divisions if you know what I
mean<00:03:14.319> that<00:03:14.560> way<00:03:15.280> I<00:03:15.310> got<00:03:15.819> peeps<00:03:16.120> over<00:03:16.299> on<00:03:16.629> top

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
mean that way I got peeps over on top

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:18.839 
mean that way I got peeps over on top
pushed<00:03:17.440> down<00:03:17.620> to<00:03:17.650> the<00:03:17.829> bottom<00:03:18.160> so<00:03:18.190> it<00:03:18.459> melted

00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:18.849 
pushed down to the bottom so it melted

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:22.379 
pushed down to the bottom so it melted
as<00:03:19.030> evenly<00:03:19.720> as<00:03:19.870> possible<00:03:20.590> so<00:03:20.859> also<00:03:21.430> I<00:03:21.910> tried<00:03:22.209> to

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:22.389 
as evenly as possible so also I tried to

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:24.030 
as evenly as possible so also I tried to
clean<00:03:22.660> my<00:03:22.840> spoon<00:03:23.169> every<00:03:23.500> time<00:03:23.709> I<00:03:23.739> was<00:03:23.889> gonna

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
clean my spoon every time I was gonna

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.069 
clean my spoon every time I was gonna
mix<00:03:24.250> a<00:03:24.400> different<00:03:24.730> color<00:03:24.940> just<00:03:25.359> so<00:03:25.510> that<00:03:25.930> the

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:26.079 
mix a different color just so that the

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:28.979 
mix a different color just so that the
colors<00:03:26.530> remained<00:03:27.430> a<00:03:27.639> little<00:03:28.419> mixed<00:03:28.840> as

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
colors remained a little mixed as

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:31.470 
colors remained a little mixed as
possible<00:03:29.560> because<00:03:29.889> yeah<00:03:30.730> like<00:03:30.970> I<00:03:31.120> said<00:03:31.329> it's

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
possible because yeah like I said it's

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:32.879 
possible because yeah like I said it's
not<00:03:31.630> gonna<00:03:31.750> look<00:03:31.959> good<00:03:32.019> if<00:03:32.260> your<00:03:32.380> colors<00:03:32.709> at

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:32.889 
not gonna look good if your colors at

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:35.280 
not gonna look good if your colors at
all<00:03:33.040> mixed<00:03:33.459> together<00:03:33.959> so<00:03:34.959> if<00:03:35.109> you're<00:03:35.260> a

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
all mixed together so if you're a

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:36.720 
all mixed together so if you're a
beginner<00:03:35.680> I<00:03:35.889> would<00:03:35.919> recommend<00:03:36.459> just<00:03:36.519> doing

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
beginner I would recommend just doing

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.240 
beginner I would recommend just doing
this<00:03:37.060> with<00:03:37.299> one<00:03:37.329> or<00:03:37.720> two<00:03:37.900> colors<00:03:38.139> not<00:03:38.950> with

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
this with one or two colors not with

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.069 
this with one or two colors not with
five<00:03:39.489> colors<00:03:39.880> like<00:03:40.030> I<00:03:40.150> did<00:03:40.329> I<00:03:40.450> think<00:03:40.540> if<00:03:40.840> I<00:03:40.989> were

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:41.079 
five colors like I did I think if I were

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:42.659 
five colors like I did I think if I were
to<00:03:41.200> do<00:03:41.319> it<00:03:41.349> again<00:03:41.680> I<00:03:41.829> would<00:03:41.980> use<00:03:42.130> less<00:03:42.280> colors

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:42.669 
to do it again I would use less colors

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:45.059 
to do it again I would use less colors
so<00:03:43.359> towards<00:03:43.720> the<00:03:43.870> end<00:03:44.049> I<00:03:44.349> just<00:03:44.380> let<00:03:44.799> in<00:03:44.950> my

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:45.069 
so towards the end I just let in my

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:47.909 
so towards the end I just let in my
marshmallow<00:03:45.669> mixture<00:03:46.090> simmer<00:03:46.660> at<00:03:47.109> the<00:03:47.590> lowest

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:47.919 
marshmallow mixture simmer at the lowest

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:49.470 
marshmallow mixture simmer at the lowest
heat<00:03:48.160> possible<00:03:48.700> just<00:03:48.970> to<00:03:49.060> make<00:03:49.180> sure<00:03:49.209> there

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
heat possible just to make sure there

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.960 
heat possible just to make sure there
were<00:03:49.569> still<00:03:49.840> no<00:03:50.019> hard<00:03:50.290> parts<00:03:50.680> and<00:03:51.010> that's<00:03:51.790> what

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
were still no hard parts and that's what

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:53.430 
were still no hard parts and that's what
it<00:03:52.090> looks<00:03:52.269> like<00:03:52.450> okay<00:03:52.780> so<00:03:52.840> once<00:03:53.260> it<00:03:53.410> is

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
it looks like okay so once it is

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.830 
it looks like okay so once it is
completely<00:03:53.950> melted<00:03:54.459> no<00:03:54.730> hard<00:03:54.940> parts<00:03:55.209> you<00:03:55.660> can

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
completely melted no hard parts you can

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.809 
completely melted no hard parts you can
go<00:03:55.959> ahead<00:03:56.169> and<00:03:56.379> pour<00:03:56.590> in<00:03:56.769> your<00:03:56.980> six<00:03:57.280> cups<00:03:57.609> of

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:03.069 
in and what I'm doing is I'm gonna kind

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:06.809 
in and what I'm doing is I'm gonna kind
of<00:04:03.129> push<00:04:03.519> it<00:04:03.549> down<00:04:04.230> so<00:04:05.230> that<00:04:05.500> the<00:04:06.190> colors<00:04:06.519> don't

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:06.819 
of push it down so that the colors don't

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:09.150 
of push it down so that the colors don't
get<00:04:07.060> too<00:04:07.569> mixed<00:04:07.810> in<00:04:08.049> before<00:04:08.590> becoming

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
get too mixed in before becoming

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.460 
get too mixed in before becoming
incorporated<00:04:09.579> into<00:04:10.120> the<00:04:10.329> rice<00:04:10.510> cereal<00:04:10.870> I<00:04:11.049> have

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
incorporated into the rice cereal I have

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.650 
incorporated into the rice cereal I have
no<00:04:11.709> idea<00:04:11.949> if<00:04:12.099> I'm<00:04:12.220> making<00:04:12.370> any<00:04:12.639> sense<00:04:12.849> but<00:04:13.449> yeah

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
no idea if I'm making any sense but yeah

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.510 
no idea if I'm making any sense but yeah
and<00:04:13.870> I<00:04:14.169> just<00:04:14.410> finished<00:04:14.859> adding<00:04:15.220> in

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:15.520 
and I just finished adding in

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.270 
and I just finished adding in
and<00:04:15.730> then<00:04:16.000> just<00:04:16.300> slowly<00:04:17.140> mixed<00:04:17.620> it<00:04:17.739> so<00:04:18.010> you<00:04:18.100> can

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
and then just slowly mixed it so you can

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.310 
and then just slowly mixed it so you can
go<00:04:18.640> ahead<00:04:18.730> and<00:04:18.940> do<00:04:19.030> that<00:04:19.180> slowly<00:04:19.630> makes<00:04:19.959> like<00:04:20.200> I

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
go ahead and do that slowly makes like I

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.280 
go ahead and do that slowly makes like I
said<00:04:20.560> do<00:04:21.160> not<00:04:21.400> overmix<00:04:22.030> because<00:04:22.660> the<00:04:22.870> colors

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:23.290 
said do not overmix because the colors

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:25.770 
said do not overmix because the colors
are<00:04:23.560> going<00:04:23.830> to<00:04:23.950> get<00:04:24.280> all<00:04:24.550> nasty

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
are going to get all nasty

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.200 
are going to get all nasty
so<00:04:26.230> yeah<00:04:26.380> just<00:04:26.470> mix<00:04:26.890> as<00:04:27.070> much<00:04:27.580> as<00:04:27.850> you<00:04:28.000> need<00:04:28.180> to

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
so yeah just mix as much as you need to

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.210 
so yeah just mix as much as you need to
get<00:04:28.600> all<00:04:28.840> the<00:04:28.990> marshmallow<00:04:29.440> incorporated

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
get all the marshmallow incorporated

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.550 
get all the marshmallow incorporated
into<00:04:30.430> a<00:04:30.550> cereal<00:04:31.000> without<00:04:31.510> making<00:04:32.230> a<00:04:32.350> big<00:04:32.380> mess

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
into a cereal without making a big mess

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:45.180 
into a cereal without making a big mess
so<00:04:42.720> towards<00:04:43.720> the<00:04:43.780> end<00:04:43.870> I<00:04:44.320> realized<00:04:44.500> that<00:04:44.950> I

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 
so towards the end I realized that I

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.370 
so towards the end I realized that I
probably<00:04:45.760> over<00:04:46.120> mixed<00:04:46.540> because<00:04:46.960> it<00:04:47.230> was

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.380 
probably over mixed because it was

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.470 
probably over mixed because it was
starting<00:04:47.770> to<00:04:47.800> look<00:04:47.920> a<00:04:48.100> little<00:04:48.190> nasty<00:04:48.520> so<00:04:49.330> yeah

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:49.480 
starting to look a little nasty so yeah

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.170 
starting to look a little nasty so yeah
I<00:04:49.690> just<00:04:49.810> stopped<00:04:50.350> because<00:04:51.040> I<00:04:51.310> realized<00:04:51.700> that<00:04:51.940> I

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 
I just stopped because I realized that I

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.020 
I just stopped because I realized that I
was<00:04:52.420> mixing<00:04:52.810> too<00:04:52.960> much<00:04:53.140> okay<00:04:54.010> so<00:04:54.070> after<00:04:54.460> that

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030 
was mixing too much okay so after that

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.870 
was mixing too much okay so after that
you<00:04:55.390> are<00:04:55.690> going<00:04:55.930> to<00:04:56.050> get<00:04:56.260> a<00:04:56.470> large<00:04:56.800> square<00:04:57.370> pan

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
you are going to get a large square pan

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.170 
you are going to get a large square pan
so<00:04:58.750> that<00:04:58.780> you<00:04:59.350> can<00:04:59.650> press<00:05:00.340> all<00:05:00.610> your<00:05:00.880> mixture

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
so that you can press all your mixture

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:02.880 
so that you can press all your mixture
into<00:05:01.360> there<00:05:01.600> and<00:05:01.780> what<00:05:02.020> I<00:05:02.050> did<00:05:02.260> is<00:05:02.410> I<00:05:02.500> buttered
