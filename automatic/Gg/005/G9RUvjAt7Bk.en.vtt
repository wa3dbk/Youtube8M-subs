goes on the caliber and that little mark
in<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.650> middle<00:00:32.009> that's<00:00:32.700> called<00:00:32.969> your<00:00:33.120> wear

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
in the middle that's called your wear

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.120 
in the middle that's called your wear
indicator<00:00:33.840> you<00:00:34.380> can<00:00:34.469> see<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.800> rule<00:00:34.980> right

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
indicator you can see the rule right

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.700 
indicator you can see the rule right
there<00:00:35.370> once<00:00:36.360> your<00:00:36.540> pad<00:00:36.750> is<00:00:36.989> doesn't<00:00:37.380> have<00:00:37.680> a

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
there once your pad is doesn't have a

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.010 
there once your pad is doesn't have a
wear<00:00:38.040> indicator<00:00:38.550> anymore<00:00:39.000> and<00:00:39.420> that's<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:39.809> sign

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
wear indicator anymore and that's a sign

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.959 
wear indicator anymore and that's a sign
you're<00:00:40.170> supposed<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.649> replace<00:00:41.520> your<00:00:41.730> pads

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
you're supposed to replace your pads

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.090 
you're supposed to replace your pads
some<00:00:42.960> people<00:00:43.260> like<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.410> wear<00:00:43.680> them<00:00:43.770> right<00:00:43.950> down

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
some people like to wear them right down

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.650 
some people like to wear them right down
to<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.340> metal<00:00:44.520> but<00:00:44.879> that's<00:00:45.059> not<00:00:45.239> good<00:00:45.420> for

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
to the metal but that's not good for

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:46.880 
to the metal but that's not good for
because<00:00:45.870> your<00:00:46.020> Pistons<00:00:46.379> can<00:00:46.559> come<00:00:46.680> out<00:00:46.800> of

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
because your Pistons can come out of

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.440 
because your Pistons can come out of
your<00:00:46.950> caliper<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:47.610> then<00:00:48.180> you're<00:00:48.300> going<00:00:48.390> to

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
your caliper and then you're going to

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.540 
your caliper and then you're going to
leak<00:00:48.690> brake<00:00:48.930> fluid<00:00:49.289> all<00:00:49.440> replace<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.100> you'll

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
leak brake fluid all replace and you'll

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.880 
leak brake fluid all replace and you'll
break<00:00:50.789> flush<00:00:51.120> as<00:00:51.329> well<00:00:51.570> not<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.469> mention<00:00:52.649> it's

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
break flush as well not to mention it's

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.520 
break flush as well not to mention it's
going<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.100> destroy<00:00:53.489> your<00:00:53.640> rotor<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.530> possibly

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
going to destroy your rotor and possibly

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.560 
going to destroy your rotor and possibly
your<00:00:55.620> caliber<00:00:56.100> at<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.250> same<00:00:56.460> time<00:00:56.699> so<00:00:57.329> when<00:00:57.480> it

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
your caliber at the same time so when it

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.330 
your caliber at the same time so when it
gets<00:00:57.719> down<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:57.930> that<00:00:58.230> we're<00:00:58.739> more<00:00:58.949> when<00:00:59.219> that

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
gets down to that we're more when that

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.799 
gets down to that we're more when that
wear<00:00:59.489> marks<00:00:59.670> gone<00:01:00.000> when<00:01:00.300> there's<00:01:00.480> only<00:01:00.570> that

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
wear marks gone when there's only that

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.420 
wear marks gone when there's only that
quarter<00:01:01.199> inch<00:01:01.320> of<00:01:01.469> pad<00:01:01.680> left<00:01:01.949> right<00:01:02.190> there

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
quarter inch of pad left right there

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.280 
quarter inch of pad left right there
that's<00:01:03.390> when<00:01:03.570> you<00:01:03.629> want<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:03.840> replace<00:01:04.080> your

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
that's when you want to replace your

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.780 
that's when you want to replace your
brakes<00:01:06.740> here's<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.860> anti-seize<00:01:08.310> lubricant

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
brakes here's the anti-seize lubricant

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.679 
brakes here's the anti-seize lubricant
i'm<00:01:08.909> going<00:01:09.030> to<00:01:09.090> use<00:01:09.210> on<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.479> brake<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:11.689> says

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
i'm going to use on the brake and says

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.300 
i'm going to use on the brake and says
right<00:01:12.869> up<00:01:12.990> here<00:01:13.140> it's<00:01:13.290> good<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.530> 1,600<00:01:14.280> degrees

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
right up here it's good to 1,600 degrees

right up here it's good to 1,600 degrees
fahrenheit<00:01:15.500> for<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.560> people<00:01:16.799> that<00:01:16.890> don't

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
fahrenheit for the people that don't

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.440 
fahrenheit for the people that don't
think<00:01:17.189> you<00:01:17.280> can<00:01:17.369> use<00:01:17.520> anti-seize<00:01:17.970> on<00:01:18.090> breaks

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
think you can use anti-seize on breaks

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.929 
think you can use anti-seize on breaks
there<00:01:19.439> you<00:01:19.560> go<00:01:21.290> so<00:01:22.460> going<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:23.520> throw<00:01:23.640> this<00:01:23.700> on

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
there you go so going to throw this on

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.999 
there you go so going to throw this on
some<00:01:24.090> of<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.240> books<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.830> get<00:01:25.830> it<00:01:25.920> back

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:44.980 
when you put these rubber boots back on
you<00:01:43.670> need<00:01:43.790> to<00:01:43.850> make<00:01:43.940> several<00:01:44.240> route<00:01:44.600> goes<00:01:44.780> all

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
you need to make several route goes all

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.690 
you need to make several route goes all
the<00:01:45.049> way<00:01:45.320> over<00:01:45.619> that<00:01:45.650> metal<00:01:46.100> piece<00:01:46.280> they<00:01:46.460> can't

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
the way over that metal piece they can't

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.219 
the way over that metal piece they can't
just<00:01:46.760> rest<00:01:47.090> up<00:01:47.299> against<00:01:47.659> it<00:01:47.780> it's<00:01:47.930> supposed<00:01:48.170> to

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
just rest up against it it's supposed to

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:50.200 
just rest up against it it's supposed to
be<00:01:48.380> watertight<00:01:48.820> so<00:01:49.820> you're<00:01:49.909> going<00:01:50.000> to<00:01:50.060> put

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
be watertight so you're going to put

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:51.640 
be watertight so you're going to put
that<00:01:50.240> rubber<00:01:50.450> boot<00:01:50.750> all<00:01:50.960> the<00:01:51.200> way<00:01:51.320> over<00:01:51.619> that

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:51.650 
that rubber boot all the way over that

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.190 
that rubber boot all the way over that
metal<00:01:52.010> piece<00:01:52.130> I'll<00:01:52.369> show<00:01:52.550> you<00:01:53.200> that's

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
metal piece I'll show you that's

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.780 
metal piece I'll show you that's
incorrect<00:01:54.650> it<00:01:54.979> has<00:01:55.130> to<00:01:55.280> go<00:01:55.369> a<00:01:55.400> little<00:01:55.580> bit

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
incorrect it has to go a little bit

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.969 
incorrect it has to go a little bit
further<00:01:55.970> than<00:01:56.240> that<00:01:56.479> I'll<00:01:56.630> show<00:01:56.810> you<00:01:56.979> and

further than that I'll show you and
that's<00:01:58.280> the<00:01:58.460> correct<00:01:58.700> way<00:01:58.909> to<00:01:58.940> install<00:01:59.300> those

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
that's the correct way to install those

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.800 
that's the correct way to install those
rubber<00:01:59.659> boots<00:02:00.159> you<00:02:01.159> want<00:02:01.310> to<00:02:01.490> use<00:02:02.390> a<00:02:02.420> lot<00:02:02.780> of

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
anti-seize I'll show you on this one I

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.780 
anti-seize I'll show you on this one I
haven't<00:02:05.540> installed<00:02:05.659> it<00:02:05.930> yet<00:02:05.990> I<00:02:06.700> pretty<00:02:07.700> much

bit<00:02:10.369> in<00:02:10.459> the<00:02:10.550> hole<00:02:10.900> just<00:02:11.900> because<00:02:12.050> you<00:02:12.140> don't

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
bit in the hole just because you don't

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.199 
bit in the hole just because you don't
want<00:02:12.319> your<00:02:12.470> brakes<00:02:12.709> binding<00:02:13.160> up<00:02:13.310> more<00:02:13.940> you<00:02:14.060> put

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
on there the better as long as it's not

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.750 
on there the better as long as it's not
losing<00:02:16.040> out<00:02:16.160> and<00:02:16.430> gets<00:02:16.730> on<00:02:16.880> your<00:02:17.030> brakes<00:02:18.760> I've

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
losing out and gets on your brakes I've

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.580 
losing out and gets on your brakes I've

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
got the caliper mount and the housing

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.160 
got the caliper mount and the housing
back<00:02:21.769> on<00:02:21.980> there<00:02:22.330> you<00:02:23.330> can<00:02:23.480> actually<00:02:23.690> just<00:02:23.989> take

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
back on there you can actually just take

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.890 
back on there you can actually just take
the<00:02:24.320> caliper<00:02:24.769> off<00:02:24.970> to<00:02:25.970> change<00:02:26.239> the<00:02:26.420> pads<00:02:26.630> if

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
the caliper off to change the pads if

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.240 
the caliper off to change the pads if
you<00:02:26.989> want<00:02:27.230> but<00:02:27.440> since<00:02:27.590> I<00:02:27.680> was<00:02:27.830> showing<00:02:28.040> you<00:02:28.220> a

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
you want but since I was showing you a

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.930 
you want but since I was showing you a
full<00:02:28.519> breakdown<00:02:28.730> I<00:02:29.300> took<00:02:29.780> it<00:02:29.959> all<00:02:30.170> apart<00:02:30.940> some

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
full breakdown I took it all apart some

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.310 
full breakdown I took it all apart some
people<00:02:32.150> might<00:02:32.269> not<00:02:32.450> like<00:02:32.510> the<00:02:32.690> idea<00:02:33.110> of<00:02:33.170> this

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
people might not like the idea of this

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:34.420 
people might not like the idea of this
but<00:02:33.620> I<00:02:33.650> put<00:02:33.830> a<00:02:33.860> little<00:02:34.010> bit<00:02:34.160> of<00:02:34.220> anti-seize

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
but I put a little bit of anti-seize

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.110 
but I put a little bit of anti-seize
just<00:02:35.330> a<00:02:35.420> tiny<00:02:35.630> tiny<00:02:35.900> bit<00:02:36.080> on<00:02:36.709> my<00:02:37.160> caliper<00:02:37.790> bolts

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
just a tiny tiny bit on my caliper bolts

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.809 
just a tiny tiny bit on my caliper bolts
just<00:02:38.420> because<00:02:38.660> I<00:02:38.750> know<00:02:38.810> what<00:02:39.050> it's<00:02:39.170> like<00:02:39.230> when

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:39.819 
just because I know what it's like when

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:42.070 
just because I know what it's like when
caliper<00:02:40.819> bolts<00:02:41.090> come<00:02:41.269> loose<00:02:41.510> so<00:02:41.750> I<00:02:41.780> know<00:02:41.900> how

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
caliper bolts come loose so I know how

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.199 
caliper bolts come loose so I know how
to<00:02:42.140> look<00:02:42.319> know<00:02:42.680> what<00:02:42.890> to<00:02:43.010> look<00:02:43.160> for<00:02:43.430> but<00:02:44.180> I

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
to look know what to look for but I

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:46.180 
to look know what to look for but I
tighten<00:02:44.540> them<00:02:44.630> down<00:02:44.690> hard<00:02:45.110> enough<00:02:45.170> to<00:02:45.620> where<00:02:45.650> I

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
tighten them down hard enough to where I

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:47.949 
tighten them down hard enough to where I
don't<00:02:46.970> really<00:02:47.090> have<00:02:47.209> to<00:02:47.420> worry<00:02:47.450> about<00:02:47.720> them

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
don't really have to worry about them

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.080 
don't really have to worry about them
coming<00:02:48.140> loose<00:02:48.500> but<00:02:49.010> if<00:02:49.370> I<00:02:49.549> need<00:02:49.730> to<00:02:49.790> take<00:02:49.910> them

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
coming loose but if I need to take them

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:51.789 
coming loose but if I need to take them
off<00:02:50.239> I<00:02:50.510> know<00:02:50.570> that<00:02:50.780> they<00:02:50.900> won't<00:02:51.049> be<00:02:51.260> corroded

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:51.799 
off I know that they won't be corroded

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:53.710 
off I know that they won't be corroded
to<00:02:52.549> the<00:02:52.640> point<00:02:52.850> where<00:02:53.000> they're<00:02:53.150> rusted<00:02:53.600> in

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
to the point where they're rusted in

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.289 
to the point where they're rusted in
there<00:02:53.930> and<00:02:54.110> then<00:02:54.230> I<00:02:54.320> have<00:02:54.500> to<00:02:54.700> buy<00:02:55.700> new<00:02:55.730> control

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:56.299 
there and then I have to buy new control

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:58.539 
there and then I have to buy new control
arms<00:02:56.690> and<00:02:56.930> all<00:02:57.019> that<00:02:57.140> kind<00:02:57.320> of<00:02:57.410> stuff<00:02:57.470> so<00:02:58.220> I<00:02:58.250> put

00:02:58.539 --> 00:02:58.549

show you how to compress the caliper

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.770 
show you how to compress the caliper
even<00:03:07.610> though<00:03:07.700> I<00:03:07.730> don't<00:03:07.940> need<00:03:08.060> to<00:03:08.269> in<00:03:08.390> this<00:03:08.510> case

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:17.410 
jobs just for this reason but it's
really<00:03:15.350> really<00:03:15.650> simple<00:03:16.060> when<00:03:17.060> you<00:03:17.150> get<00:03:17.299> new

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
really really simple when you get new

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.300 
really really simple when you get new
pads<00:03:17.690> and<00:03:17.930> rotors<00:03:18.290> the<00:03:18.470> new<00:03:18.590> pads<00:03:18.829> and<00:03:19.010> rotors

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
pads and rotors the new pads and rotors

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.699 
pads and rotors the new pads and rotors
are<00:03:19.430> obviously<00:03:19.820> going<00:03:20.000> to<00:03:20.060> be<00:03:20.180> thicker<00:03:20.709> than

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
are obviously going to be thicker than

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:24.220 
are obviously going to be thicker than
the<00:03:22.130> old<00:03:22.430> pads<00:03:22.700> and<00:03:22.910> rotors<00:03:23.180> so<00:03:23.840> as<00:03:24.049> this

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
the old pads and rotors so as this

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.740 
the old pads and rotors so as this
clamps<00:03:24.650> down<00:03:24.940> that's<00:03:25.940> how<00:03:26.120> your<00:03:26.299> pads<00:03:26.510> and

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
clamps down that's how your pads and

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.120 
clamps down that's how your pads and
welders<00:03:27.079> we're<00:03:27.290> out<00:03:27.440> because<00:03:27.680> that<00:03:27.799> clamps

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
welders we're out because that clamps

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:29.890 
welders we're out because that clamps
down<00:03:28.190> causes<00:03:28.880> friction<00:03:29.090> between<00:03:29.450> the<00:03:29.720> rotor

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
down causes friction between the rotor

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.470 
down causes friction between the rotor
and<00:03:30.170> the<00:03:30.230> pads<00:03:30.500> and<00:03:30.859> wears<00:03:31.130> them<00:03:31.280> out<00:03:31.430> well<00:03:32.390> in

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
and the pads and wears them out well in

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:33.699 
and the pads and wears them out well in
order<00:03:32.570> to<00:03:32.720> get<00:03:32.840> the<00:03:32.930> new<00:03:33.049> ones<00:03:33.230> in<00:03:33.410> there<00:03:33.560> you

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
order to get the new ones in there you

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:35.470 
order to get the new ones in there you
need<00:03:33.859> more<00:03:34.010> room<00:03:34.280> so<00:03:34.820> obviously<00:03:35.209> you're<00:03:35.329> going

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
need more room so obviously you're going

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.180 
need more room so obviously you're going
to<00:03:35.540> have<00:03:35.660> to<00:03:35.780> compress<00:03:36.140> these<00:03:36.470> two<00:03:36.709> Pistons

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
to have to compress these two Pistons

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.539 
to have to compress these two Pistons
well<00:03:38.120> you<00:03:38.209> do<00:03:38.359> that<00:03:38.390> is<00:03:38.720> you<00:03:38.780> just<00:03:38.989> get<00:03:39.140> like

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:39.549 
well you do that is you just get like

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:41.640 
well you do that is you just get like
six<00:03:40.549> or<00:03:40.790> eight<00:03:40.940> inch<00:03:41.120> sequel

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
six or eight inch sequel

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.589 
six or eight inch sequel
or<00:03:41.980> they<00:03:42.069> actually<00:03:42.489> sell<00:03:44.189> specific<00:03:45.599> break

00:03:46.589 --> 00:03:46.599 
or they actually sell specific break

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:48.300 
or they actually sell specific break
clamps<00:03:47.200> so<00:03:47.319> you<00:03:47.439> can<00:03:47.590> buy<00:03:47.709> that<00:03:47.890> almost<00:03:48.069> looks

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
clamps so you can buy that almost looks

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.149 
clamps so you can buy that almost looks
like<00:03:48.400> a<00:03:49.019> c-clamp<00:03:50.019> and<00:03:50.260> a<00:03:50.290> vice<00:03:50.470> grip<00:03:50.500> in<00:03:50.920> one

00:03:51.149 --> 00:03:51.159 
like a c-clamp and a vice grip in one

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:53.250 
like a c-clamp and a vice grip in one
only<00:03:52.090> way<00:03:52.209> the<00:03:52.329> way<00:03:52.629> you<00:03:52.689> do<00:03:52.900> it<00:03:52.930> you<00:03:53.049> just

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
only way the way you do it you just

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.350 
only way the way you do it you just
tighten<00:03:53.590> one<00:03:53.860> tighten<00:03:54.519> the<00:03:54.610> other<00:03:54.730> tighten

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:18.579 
for the new pads and rotors if i were to

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:21.689 
for the new pads and rotors if i were to
have<00:04:18.729> them<00:04:18.900> to<00:04:19.900> fit<00:04:20.109> on<00:04:20.260> there<00:04:20.519> another<00:04:21.519> thing

00:04:21.689 --> 00:04:21.699 
have them to fit on there another thing

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:23.820 
have them to fit on there another thing
i<00:04:21.760> want<00:04:21.940> to<00:04:21.970> show<00:04:22.060> you<00:04:22.180> is<00:04:22.449> that<00:04:22.479> these<00:04:23.380> slide

i want to show you is that these slide

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.010 
i want to show you is that these slide
bolts<00:04:24.250> have<00:04:24.490> a<00:04:24.550> flat<00:04:24.970> side<00:04:25.270> there's<00:04:25.720> a<00:04:25.810> flat

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
bolts have a flat side there's a flat

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.140 
bolts have a flat side there's a flat
side<00:04:26.229> right<00:04:26.440> there<00:04:26.680> and<00:04:26.919> there's<00:04:27.639> a<00:04:27.729> flat<00:04:27.940> side

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
side right there and there's a flat side

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.350 
side right there and there's a flat side
right<00:04:28.330> there<00:04:28.570> on<00:04:28.690> both<00:04:28.810> sides<00:04:29.169> that<00:04:29.740> flat<00:04:30.100> spot

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
right there on both sides that flat spot

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.659 
right there on both sides that flat spot
has<00:04:31.360> to<00:04:31.630> line<00:04:31.840> up<00:04:32.080> with<00:04:32.320> this<00:04:32.680> flat<00:04:33.010> spot<00:04:33.340> on

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:33.669 
has to line up with this flat spot on

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:36.240 
has to line up with this flat spot on
the<00:04:34.570> caliper<00:04:35.050> that's<00:04:35.590> just<00:04:35.740> to<00:04:35.889> keep<00:04:36.039> these

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
the caliper that's just to keep these

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.300 
the caliper that's just to keep these
from<00:04:36.460> spinning<00:04:36.789> and<00:04:37.680> also<00:04:38.680> enables<00:04:39.099> you<00:04:39.280> to

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
from spinning and also enables you to

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.159 
from spinning and also enables you to
tighten<00:04:39.789> the<00:04:39.970> bolts<00:04:40.300> on<00:04:40.419> the<00:04:40.449> back<00:04:40.720> so<00:04:41.139> that

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:41.169 
tighten the bolts on the back so that

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:42.689 
tighten the bolts on the back so that
this<00:04:41.380> doesn't<00:04:41.530> just<00:04:41.740> spin<00:04:42.070> and<00:04:42.220> spin<00:04:42.400> and<00:04:42.430> spin

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:42.699 
this doesn't just spin and spin and spin

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:43.770 
this doesn't just spin and spin and spin
while<00:04:42.910> you're<00:04:43.000> trying<00:04:43.150> to<00:04:43.270> tighten<00:04:43.509> the<00:04:43.570> bolt

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
while you're trying to tighten the bolt

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.680 
while you're trying to tighten the bolt
on<00:04:43.960> the<00:04:43.990> back<00:04:44.820> so<00:04:45.820> I'm<00:04:45.880> going<00:04:46.000> to<00:04:46.030> go<00:04:46.120> ahead<00:04:46.150> and

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
on the back so I'm going to go ahead and

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.790 
on the back so I'm going to go ahead and
put<00:04:46.960> this<00:04:47.080> caliper<00:04:47.440> back<00:04:47.680> on<00:04:49.320> and<00:04:50.320> this<00:04:50.500> is<00:04:50.650> why

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
put this caliper back on and this is why

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.670 
put this caliper back on and this is why
you<00:04:50.860> put<00:04:51.130> anti-seize<00:04:51.580> on<00:04:51.610> the<00:04:51.849> rotor<00:04:52.560> so<00:04:53.560> that

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
you put anti-seize on the rotor so that

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.080 
you put anti-seize on the rotor so that
the<00:04:53.770> wheel<00:04:53.949> will<00:04:54.070> come<00:04:54.250> off<00:04:54.400> easy<00:04:54.669> because
