00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.610
 morning of frustrations are dead or 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.310
 always doing this live on the 29th type 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.960
 80,000 times and it's not like I do it again 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.759
 because I don't feel like bringing you 29 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.320
 gastric co 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.649
 I do it because I started to freak 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.000
 I was nervous this morning and what 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.300
 the only thing I want is a species 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.370
 of revenge co itself to take home 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.079

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.079
 bring you a very good fucking game 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.680
 how to forget what it was 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.460
 this morning from the game it was 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:59.180
 really annoying or v see immediately 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.180
 a little where this 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.460
 all the deaths I've done in green 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.770
 they were all like that and I immediately started 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.229
 now immediately warm up because all of them 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:11.290
 the deaths I apologized I have from behind 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:13.960
 so or as before that I arrive at 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:17.500
 one meter from the enemy and this makes me 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.850
