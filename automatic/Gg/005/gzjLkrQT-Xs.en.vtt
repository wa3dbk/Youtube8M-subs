00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.100
 hello girls and boys, how are you? 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.950
 For who does not know me, my name is 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.750
 poison and today my video is 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.639
 another little video talking about 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.290
 decoration 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.289
 so personal when the model of 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:19.500
 United States I confess that I found 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:22.710
 the kind of decoration that is 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.740
 a chez if people here like 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.859
 Old things are antique furniture those 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:32.070
 furniture with old face furniture 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:35.130
 well boost that kind of farm furniture 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:38.879
 old then thought 100 super weird 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:42.090
 still think these furniture is rush them 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.670
 They speak rustic and I do not like those 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.590
 things of old mirror those mirrors 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.219
 peeled with old look that 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:53.070
 It's expensive, it's a lot of people who like it. 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.110
 I do not like that much, but I already 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.870
 I'm adapting, I 'm enjoying 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.149
 some things one thing that I like 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.969
 much here in the decoration here of the states 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.409
 Together are the curtains and I am that 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.880
 person as soon as I think I have 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:12.119
 100 years old because I like 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.670
 that style so little voice knows 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.009
 and here at home I have been decorating 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.470
 gossip is putting my 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.890
 curtains and today I'll show you 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:26.759
 my curtains are the flames 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:29.640
 curtains very cheap I went on one 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.770
 shop that sells curtain and did not like it 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.619
 much of the models I had there and some 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.409
 models so very expensive the models is 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.960
 more beautiful very expensive so I ended up 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.990
 coming back to my good old man to Mars 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:46.170
 and found some pretty curtains there and 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.810
 so the maximum I paid was 12 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.119
 dollars is by my routines then 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.220

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.619

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:51.280

00:03:59.199 --> 00:04:05.439
 so my room has all this tone 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:07.689
 and I found this curtain that matched b 

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:10.840
 combining well with my clothes 

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:13.299

 I really liked the style 

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:20.409
 so American even here in my 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:24.219
 window I found this curtain well 

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:26.590
 clarinha is a cream is very transparent 

00:04:24.219 --> 00:04:27.670
 but look the edge detail looks good 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:30.430
 that 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:32.470
 even my grandmother has a 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:35.410
 customer who is already very old and she has 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:37.360
 these curtains in reais in the window and there 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:40.750
 I thought it was cool, I bought it on 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:43.240
 my window also then as the part 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:45.970
 from above my window look like this 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:48.670
 Looks with brown 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:51.490
 I do not put rail only 

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:58.320
 I put them they have the same poses 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:05:01.690
 in the bathroom curtain and was there only 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:03.850
 It was not very clear. 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:06.190
 but with these little details of the border as well 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:08.530
 cool, come over pretty tight 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:11.530
 so it's just a little short for 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:15.310
 Break the sun because I have blind 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:17.470
 here in my other window too 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:21.130
 I put another one it comes to the middle of the 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:22.360
 The window I preferred so meets this 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:29.080
 shorter 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:31.960
 just to give one of a little detail 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:35.350
 all my windows have this one 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:39.010
 border on top and then my window 

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:41.740
 so good this grandmother's face 

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:43.330
 so when you raise blinds, it's who 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.130
 You're out there, do not you see who's here? 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:48.610
 inside with this curtain 

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:50.950
 although it is very transparent 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:54.430
 here in my back window I 

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:58.180
 I let her also have this piece tackles 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:06:00.520
 I do not know if it's for you to see and instead 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:03.220
 to put the curtain I do not like 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:05.830
 blind all windows have blind 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:09.660
 but I leave her up and here I 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:12.600
 I put this sticker that is one he is a 

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:15.190
 How do you talk leaves my window? 

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:17.650
 textured so she has this drawing 

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:21.370
 I do not need to download blinds to myself. 

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:24.550
 I leave my room clearer and 

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:26.920
 draws super cool for you is to have more 

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:29.830
 privacy in your house you have a window 

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:33.400
 glass then I bought it narrated a 

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:35.260
 beak costs $ 20 per sheet and this 

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:37.360
 window remained very beautiful leaves that 

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:39.730
 pretty detail in the window so I 

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:41.139
 I do not need to download blinds because whoever 

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:43.840
 it's out there do not you see? 

00:06:41.139 --> 00:06:47.080
 who's in here with that sticker 

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:49.240
 so this is mine are the socks 

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:51.580
 Shorts, look how cool. 

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:56.830
 I 'm gradually getting used to the 

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:59.080
 American style decor, then it was 

00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:01.360
 This is what I had to talk to you about. 

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:04.090
 Today I hope you have 

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:06.900
 I liked the video and kisses for you 

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:06.900
