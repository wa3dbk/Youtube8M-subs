00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.950 
will affect the flow gameplay mainly
because<00:03:10.830> of<00:03:11.100> the<00:03:11.250> size<00:03:11.520> of<00:03:11.670> maps<00:03:11.910> it<00:03:12.480> simply

because of the size of maps it simply

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.170 
because of the size of maps it simply
