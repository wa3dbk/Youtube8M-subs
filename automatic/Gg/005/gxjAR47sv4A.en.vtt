00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
that so the first thing you're going to

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.569 
that so the first thing you're going to
do<00:00:42.000> is<00:00:42.239> we<00:00:42.420> gotta<00:00:42.660> hit<00:00:42.870> e4<00:00:43.730> times<00:00:44.730> over<00:00:45.629> good

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:46.579 
do is we gotta hit e4 times over good

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:54.950 
do is we gotta hit e4 times over good
they'll<00:00:47.579> be<00:00:47.610> like

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.260 

pretty<00:00:55.960> easy<00:00:56.220> so<00:00:57.220> after<00:00:57.550> that<00:00:57.670> you<00:00:57.730> get<00:00:57.910> a<00:00:57.970> move

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:58.270 
pretty easy so after that you get a move

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:03.330 
pretty easy so after that you get a move
on<00:00:59.070> finding<00:01:00.070> the<00:01:00.400> 3rd<00:01:01.180> fret<00:01:01.510> of<00:01:01.570> e<00:01:01.990> string<00:01:02.350> with

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:03.340 
on finding the 3rd fret of e string with

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:08.780

so<00:01:20.530> that<00:01:20.710> after<00:01:21.040> that<00:01:21.220> you're<00:01:21.370> going<00:01:21.520> to<00:01:21.610> move

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:21.730 
so that after that you're going to move

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:39.750 
so that after that you're going to move
up<00:01:21.910> to<00:01:22.120> a<00:01:22.150> fifth<00:01:22.990> fret<00:01:23.460> i'll<00:01:24.460> be<00:01:24.580> true

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:39.760 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.010

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
me to do that I don't know why it just

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.270 
me to do that I don't know why it just
does<00:03:27.080> and<00:03:29.380> the<00:03:30.380> only<00:03:30.470> Lucy<00:03:30.920> are<00:03:31.040> really

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
does and the only Lucy are really

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.100 
does and the only Lucy are really
intervention<00:03:31.760> is<00:03:31.880> that<00:03:32.090> this<00:03:32.330> is<00:03:32.510> all<00:03:32.720> in<00:03:32.750> our

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
intervention is that this is all in our

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:39.490 
intervention is that this is all in our
standard<00:03:33.860> is<00:03:34.220> too<00:03:35.090> severe<00:03:35.750> so
