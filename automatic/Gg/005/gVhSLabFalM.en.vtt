00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 for the girl and welcome to this 

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:05.279
 new video as you read from the title 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.280
 I will show you the best convertibles there 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.719
 i'm in gta 5 for best cabrio io 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.849
 I mean those vehicles that once 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.160
 when the top is activated it will go down the way 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.900
 best in the most spectacular way 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.720
 so don't kill yourself in the comments 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.220
 saying no oil the best cabrio is this 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.100
 and that etc because they are 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.960
 personal tastes each of us is different 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.369
 on I wanted to tell you also that in this 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.109
 video we will see only three vehicles 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.760
 because in all the races they reward 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.009
 only the first three so it seemed to me 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.739
 just make only three vehicles 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.840
 even though mary the deserved to be 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.550
 in this ranking other cars 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.860
 but I had already covered in the last videos 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.739
 so it seemed a bit superfluous 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.660
 in third place we find the good 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.219
 factor surano this is a machine here 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.690
 really fast is a sports car 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:54.059
 really fast but the top goes down 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.610
 in the realm a very ugly way you see 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.260
 all in one blow and all in the back is not 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.160
 not even very clean to see 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.079
 eye 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.850
 we see that there is a hood behind it 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.539
 thickness etc. I don't like it 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.549
 very very much 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:09.479
 in addition this one in the same system 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:12.590
 that we will find in the reply that there is 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.210
 precisely in los santos of the machine mi 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.850
 I didn't like finding it at all 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.240
 same hood in the mini car e 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.080
 in this sport they could 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.270
 to differentiate them we say because precisely 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.580
 they are two completely different machines 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.590
 this extra machine does not hold for 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.030
 nothing in curve b parts rage of care 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.100
 in a crazy way 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.740
 in second place we find the di hwbush 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.710
 quick gt I really hope said in the 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.259
 right way in my opinion then this 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.520
 machine looks a lot like a 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.070
 aston martin 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.790
 also this one unfortunately on the roof 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:51.360
 let's say in canvas in a few machines 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:53.340
 really year this roof in 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.350
 in aluminum in the same material 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.410
 let's say the body in the same 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.840
 coloring as you saw opens in 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:03.270
 two points on the roof and then disappears 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.970
 behind that hatch I like it 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.479
 very much this solution because it makes 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:11.310
 the machine really clean to the eye 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:14.550
 fabulous and it is very fast also to 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.410
 open and close in first place not 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.480
 there could be grotti this one 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.060
 really fabulous car under each 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.790
 point of view and now I will explain it to you 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.800
 as you can see, it doesn't even look like a convertible 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.840
 because on the roof we say aluminum 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:32.280
 in metal what you want 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:35.970
 and look how it opens one is fabulous 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:39.000
 really beastly noise what 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:41.550
 that is fabulous line and very fast as 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.360
 car the best car of all 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.190
 game 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.020
