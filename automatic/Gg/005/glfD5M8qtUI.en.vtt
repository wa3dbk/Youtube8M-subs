if<00:00:23.130> you<00:00:23.220> get<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:23.369> new<00:00:23.580> number<00:00:23.730> for<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:24.449> hundred

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
if you get a new number for a hundred

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.679 
if you get a new number for a hundred
dollars<00:00:24.960> it's<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.410> l9<00:00:25.590> on<00:00:26.400> this<00:00:26.760> one<00:00:27.029> but

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
dollars it's the l9 on this one but

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.929 
dollars it's the l9 on this one but
which<00:00:27.869> is<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.109> activity<00:00:28.590> does<00:00:28.949> not<00:00:29.160> have<00:00:29.369> a

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
which is the activity does not have a

cell yet on it or any promotion that's

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.040 
cell yet on it or any promotion that's
probably<00:00:32.850> because<00:00:33.090> this<00:00:33.420> one<00:00:33.600> day<00:00:33.690> after<00:00:33.809> he

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
probably because this one day after he

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.569 
probably because this one day after he
just<00:00:34.230> came<00:00:34.380> out<00:00:34.530> a<00:00:34.710> couple<00:00:34.739> weeks<00:00:35.130> ago<00:00:35.250> and

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
just came out a couple weeks ago and

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.700 
just came out a couple weeks ago and
this<00:00:36.120> was<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.690> l9<00:00:36.870> it's<00:00:37.230> been<00:00:37.350> out<00:00:37.469> for<00:00:37.559> a

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
this was the l9 it's been out for a

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.430 
this was the l9 it's been out for a
couple<00:00:37.770> months<00:00:38.070> anyways<00:00:39.079> about<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.230> features

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
couple months anyways about the features

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.170 
couple months anyways about the features
this<00:00:41.540> has<00:00:42.540> a<00:00:42.570> bigger<00:00:42.809> screen<00:00:42.899> as<00:00:43.829> you<00:00:44.340> see<00:00:44.520> this

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
this has a bigger screen as you see this

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.420 
this has a bigger screen as you see this
is<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.360> hemline<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:45.989> I'm<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.680> compared<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.309> the

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
is the hemline and I'm a compared to the

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:54.170 
is the hemline and I'm a compared to the
f3<00:00:49.879> see<00:00:51.649> it's<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:53.100> little<00:00:53.399> bit<00:00:53.489> bigger<00:00:53.789> on<00:00:54.030> the

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
f3 see it's a little bit bigger on the

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.770 
f3 see it's a little bit bigger on the
screen<00:00:54.449> they're<00:00:55.260> both<00:00:55.469> Gorilla<00:00:56.039> Glass<00:00:56.780> that's

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
screen they're both Gorilla Glass that's

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.520 
screen they're both Gorilla Glass that's
not<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:57.989> difference<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:58.649> then<00:00:59.520> feature<00:01:00.120> wise

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
not a difference and then feature wise

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.950 
not a difference and then feature wise
this<00:01:01.530> is<00:01:01.739> a<00:01:01.770> 4g<00:01:02.340> this<00:01:02.609> one's<00:01:02.820> for<00:01:03.059> jeep<00:01:03.359> just

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
this is a 4g this one's for jeep just

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.399 
this is a 4g this one's for jeep just
normal<00:01:04.229> 4G<00:01:04.640> this<00:01:05.640> one<00:01:05.850> right<00:01:05.970> here<00:01:06.200> runs<00:01:07.200> the

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
normal 4G this one right here runs the

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.980 
normal 4G this one right here runs the
4g<00:01:07.830> LTE<00:01:08.369> that's<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.270> new<00:01:09.450> server<00:01:09.659> so<00:01:09.900> it's

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
4g LTE that's the new server so it's

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.810 
4g LTE that's the new server so it's
going<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.140> be<00:01:10.260> much<00:01:10.409> faster<00:01:10.650> on<00:01:11.010> here<00:01:11.220> this<00:01:11.610> has

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
going to be much faster on here this has

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.390 
going to be much faster on here this has
better<00:01:12.119> battery<00:01:12.210> life<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:13.070> it's<00:01:14.070> it<00:01:14.189> has<00:01:14.369> a

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
better battery life and it's it has a

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.149 
better battery life and it's it has a
1.2<00:01:14.970> gigahertz<00:01:15.360> processor<00:01:15.570> inside<00:01:16.290> well<00:01:16.890> this

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
1.2 gigahertz processor inside well this

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.550 
1.2 gigahertz processor inside well this
one<00:01:17.310> has<00:01:17.340> really<00:01:17.549> one<00:01:17.880> gigahertz<00:01:18.210> processor

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
one has really one gigahertz processor

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.499 
one has really one gigahertz processor
so<00:01:19.560> if<00:01:19.860> you<00:01:19.979> take<00:01:20.100> my<00:01:20.159> advice<00:01:20.310> for<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.210> fifty

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
so if you take my advice for the fifty

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.480 
so if you take my advice for the fifty
dollars<00:01:21.780> more<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.830> should<00:01:22.920> get<00:01:23.130> this<00:01:23.340> one

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
dollars more you should get this one

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.370 
dollars more you should get this one
because<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.880> internet<00:01:24.270> is<00:01:24.299> faster<00:01:24.630> it's<00:01:24.869> a<00:01:24.960> 4G

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
because the internet is faster it's a 4G

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.880 
because the internet is faster it's a 4G
LTE<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:26.369> not<00:01:26.700> just<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.180> normal<00:01:27.450> 4G<00:01:27.710> it<00:01:28.710> has<00:01:28.860> a

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
LTE and not just the normal 4G it has a

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.819 
LTE and not just the normal 4G it has a
smaller<00:01:29.280> screen<00:01:29.960> but<00:01:30.960> i<00:01:30.990> mean<00:01:31.259> if<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.470> screen

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
smaller screen but i mean if the screen

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.260 
smaller screen but i mean if the screen
really<00:01:32.100> matters<00:01:32.369> to<00:01:32.460> you<00:01:32.610> that<00:01:32.790> much<00:01:33.000> just

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
really matters to you that much just

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.120 
really matters to you that much just
it's<00:01:33.659> not<00:01:33.840> too<00:01:34.229> much<00:01:34.350> of<00:01:34.409> a<00:01:34.560> big<00:01:34.710> difference

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
it's not too much of a big difference

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.399 
it's not too much of a big difference
but<00:01:35.850> if<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.000> screen<00:01:36.659> matters<00:01:36.930> then<00:01:37.200> you

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
but if the screen matters then you

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.760 
but if the screen matters then you
should<00:01:37.560> go<00:01:37.590> with<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.920> l9<00:01:39.110> and<00:01:40.110> like<00:01:40.530> i<00:01:40.619> said

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
should go with the l9 and like i said

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.620 
should go with the l9 and like i said
there's<00:01:40.920> not<00:01:41.220> a<00:01:41.250> promotion<00:01:41.880> right<00:01:42.090> now<00:01:42.270> on<00:01:42.479> it

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
there's not a promotion right now on it

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.240 
there's not a promotion right now on it
but<00:01:42.780> hopefully<00:01:43.049> give<00:01:43.380> it<00:01:43.470> another<00:01:43.680> month<00:01:44.009> or

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
but hopefully give it another month or

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.249 
but hopefully give it another month or
so<00:01:44.759> they'll<00:01:45.180> have<00:01:45.360> this<00:01:45.540> probably<00:01:45.869> down<00:01:46.049> for

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
so they'll have this probably down for

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.170 
so they'll have this probably down for
one<00:01:46.350> hundred<00:01:46.409> dollars<00:01:46.829> as<00:01:46.950> well<00:01:47.189> and<00:01:47.460> you

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
one hundred dollars as well and you

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.660 
one hundred dollars as well and you
can't<00:01:48.390> get<00:01:48.540> this<00:01:48.720> wrong<00:01:48.899> 499<00:01:49.829> only<00:01:50.399> if<00:01:50.460> you<00:01:50.549> get

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
can't get this wrong 499 only if you get

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.429
