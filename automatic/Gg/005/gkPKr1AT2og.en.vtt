00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 hello today I'm going to teach you how to be a country 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.580
 of pineapples super average good indeed 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.519
 super good and what we are going to occupy is going to 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.650
 be a cup of pineapples in pieces 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.929
 egg white a cup of sugar glass 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.089
 a butter bar half pack 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:18.810
 of vanilla cookies and a pack of 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.640
 I bought my pineapples in a 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.930
 plate of these that come with syrup 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.210
 but if you buy it from pineapple 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.279
 natural because easier more good you go to 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.890
 see me heading without super bits 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.380
 small children then grab a third cup 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.950
 of butter add half a cup of 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:38.579
 icing sugar and I started to beat them super 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.050
 super good so that they stir well and 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.770
 the butter I recommend that this 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:47.590
 to time like this in ambient weather or 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:51.490
 the cream or something like that is said after you 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:53.400
 I put the egg white and beat it another 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:55.260
 once super good 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.050
 if you have a blender it will be 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.970
 super easier easier all but like 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.330
 I did not have it here because I did not do it with 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.330
 a fork 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:08.450
 and so you should see more or less and already 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.820
 when it is so super super super good 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.700
 amarillito let's add the pineapple and 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:17.090
 we are going to stir it super well all 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:19.670
 super well the truth and apart in a 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.740
 super hot water we are going to 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:25.590
 add the packet of grenetina and what 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:28.829
 let's stir super well super good 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.649
 and we are going to beat it and since everything is 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:34.770
 all the powder has been diluted 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:37.049
 let's add to the pineapple mix and 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:41.069
 the butter and the egg are going to 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:42.750
 revolver and as to my web / sms I stop the 

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:46.380
 butter or I do not know why it looked like that 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:49.819
 I put it in the blender and it goes like this 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:53.880
 get super beaten as well as a guy 

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:56.189
 papilla de bebito apart in the same 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.280
 blender I'm already in that part I'm going to 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:01.200
 grab the half pack of cookies 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.700
 of vanilla and I'm going to grind it in the 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.420
 blender to make it look super 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.679
 finite with that but finite 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.049
 then I put it in the mold where I go to 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:12.599
 make my country and I add the rest of 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:15.510
 the butter of the bar lorre I went back 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:18.819
 super good and then I will add the 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.680
 half a cup of icing sugar 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:24.159
 again I 'm going to stir it until 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:27.849
 everything is homogeneous and know more or less 

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:31.930
 well and when it's like this all soaked and 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:33.700
 everything is going to be extinguished and 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:37.120
 putting well on the walls and in everything 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:39.459
 around the mold and since it is already 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.620
 that is like a leaf type let's go to 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.870
 add everything in the pineapple and everything and so 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.400
 it must be seen and so that those 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.919
 edges farts above we're going to move 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.260
 so shake we're going to put it in the fridge 

00:02:47.919 --> 00:02:51.489
 for more than 5 hours and that's how it is 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.810
 many times but good hope I have them 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:56.700
 liked and really do it to be 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.700
 really super good bye
