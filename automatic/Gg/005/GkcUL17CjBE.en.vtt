00:00:00.109 --> 00:00:03.109
 plus 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:17.510
 or the pod one more day with you 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.730
 today we are going to try to explain something 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.800
 which for many is probably obvious 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.860
 but for many others it is a 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.869
 upset and that is when we send the 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.970
 bikes home or sometimes when the 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:30.859
 you have to move in the car or in 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.689
 any other time note is that the 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:34.670
 brake pads rubs against the 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:36.589
 disc either the front or the 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.150
 back and you do not know well what 

00:00:36.589 --> 00:00:40.160
 do to be able to solve it or 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.930
 improve it as much as possible we're going to 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.150
 teach how to do it and we have preferred 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.620
 do not put them in the workshop on the rack and 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.059
 others that is not the situation that 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.890
 you will usually have the majority in 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:51.320
 home but you're going to have the bike 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:54.079
 supported anywhere or below in the 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.899
 garage or anywhere else in the 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:58.850
 that you will have to hold it or with 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:00.350
 some foot we have put one of 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.109
 feet we have bike 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.940
 29 but there are many other models already 

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:07.729
 from here we are going to do it 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:10.310
 step normally when skims 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:12.500
 pills is because the clamp is in 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.259
 this entry with respect to the disk what 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.000
 What we have to do is loosen the two 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:18.650
 Screws that hold the clamp 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.840
 chassis 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.580
 so that the clamp is floating if it 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.740
 try some brakes and hands is possible 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.510
 take the piece to prevent the 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.350
 rotate and we will take out 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:30.390
 previously 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.300
 we have loosened the other screw and now 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.870
 let's loosen this 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:37.400
 so that the piece is now loose 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.890
 no need to remove the screws 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:43.070
 only the clamp is loose 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:46.070
 we will tighten the handle with force and without 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:48.940
 let's go let's re-tighten the 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.940
 screws of the piece 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.220
 once tightened the clamp in its position 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.320
 we will see how the wheel turns perfectly 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.950
 without any friction with the 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.740
 pills 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.910
 in the case of the front wheel 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.580
 we would do exactly the same 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:14.370
 we loosened the two Allen screws that 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.349
 they go to the fork we would leave the piece 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.989
 floating, we will tighten the brake lever 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:20.910
 forward and we would press again 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.920
 this way we get that clamp 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.590
 is perfectly centered with 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.420
 respect to the disc and only rub a 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.980
 little the pills especially in the 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.670
 first outputs that we need to be 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.680
 adapt to the discs 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.599
 as always if you have any questions to 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.340
 In this respect, you only have to put yourself 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:38.080
 contact us either by 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.790
 phone through email 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.630
 or going through our facilities 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.630
 Thank you
