second<00:01:26.790> reward<00:01:27.090> there<00:01:27.210> was<00:01:27.299> a<00:01:27.360> lot<00:01:27.479> of<00:01:27.509> stuff

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
second reward there was a lot of stuff

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.179 
second reward there was a lot of stuff
to<00:01:27.930> do<00:01:28.020> with<00:01:28.140> that<00:01:28.259> so<00:01:28.500> I<00:01:28.530> honestly<00:01:28.799> think<00:01:29.040> I

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
to do with that so I honestly think I

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.039 
to do with that so I honestly think I
might<00:01:29.430> probably<00:01:29.880> be<00:01:30.090> still<00:01:30.450> involved<00:01:31.049> with

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
might probably be still involved with

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.499 
might probably be still involved with
that<00:01:31.290> but<00:01:31.560> I'm<00:01:31.710> it'd<00:01:32.280> just<00:01:32.520> be<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:32.700> big<00:01:33.000> access

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
that but I'm it'd just be a big access

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.929 
that but I'm it'd just be a big access
issue<00:01:33.750> in<00:01:34.140> terms<00:01:34.200> of<00:01:34.560> where<00:01:34.710> I<00:01:34.740> live<00:01:35.040> 100<00:01:35.909> years

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
issue in terms of where I live 100 years

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.200 
issue in terms of where I live 100 years
ago<00:01:36.390> there<00:01:37.140> wouldn't<00:01:37.680> be<00:01:37.890> that<00:01:38.130> much<00:01:38.159> going<00:01:39.090> on

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
ago there wouldn't be that much going on

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.929 
ago there wouldn't be that much going on
and<00:01:39.920> most<00:01:40.920> likely<00:01:41.100> see<00:01:41.369> my<00:01:41.490> father's<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:41.820> farmer

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
and most likely see my father's a farmer

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.730 
and most likely see my father's a farmer
if<00:01:42.659> I<00:01:42.720> was<00:01:42.840> born<00:01:43.020> a<00:01:43.049> hundred<00:01:43.140> years<00:01:43.439> ago<00:01:43.590> and

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
if I was born a hundred years ago and

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:44.990 
if I was born a hundred years ago and
this<00:01:43.799> is<00:01:43.920> right<00:01:44.070> here<00:01:44.220> right<00:01:44.399> now<00:01:44.430> I'd<00:01:44.729> be<00:01:44.759> a

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
this is right here right now I'd be a

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.600 
this is right here right now I'd be a
farmer<00:01:45.329> I<00:01:45.479> that<00:01:46.229> would<00:01:46.350> just<00:01:46.530> be<00:01:46.560> how<00:01:46.770> I<00:01:46.799> would

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
farmer I that would just be how I would

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.030 
farmer I that would just be how I would
be<00:01:47.790> and<00:01:48.030> it<00:01:48.720> would<00:01:48.810> probably<00:01:49.140> I<00:01:49.560> probably<00:01:49.860> know

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
be and it would probably I probably know

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.889 
be and it would probably I probably know
no<00:01:50.220> better<00:01:50.399> but<00:01:50.670> that<00:01:51.479> would<00:01:51.659> that<00:01:51.840> would

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
no better but that would that would

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.870 
no better but that would that would
honestly<00:01:52.350> be<00:01:52.619> probably<00:01:53.310> that<00:01:53.579> my<00:01:53.700> least

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
honestly be probably that my least

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:54.889 
honestly be probably that my least
favorite<00:01:54.149> thing<00:01:54.180> never<00:01:54.450> happened<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:54.810> me

favorite thing never happened to me

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.289 
favorite thing never happened to me
right<00:01:55.110> now<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.500> I'm<00:01:56.280> not<00:01:56.670> interested<00:01:57.000> in<00:01:57.180> that

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
right now and I'm not interested in that

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.990 
right now and I'm not interested in that
lifestyle<00:01:57.719> woman<00:01:57.990> bit<00:01:58.110> and<00:01:58.549> I'm<00:01:59.549> a<00:01:59.579> media

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
lifestyle woman bit and I'm a media

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.209 
lifestyle woman bit and I'm a media
technology<00:02:00.600> person<00:02:01.049> so<00:02:01.320> I'd<00:02:01.710> like<00:02:01.890> to<00:02:02.009> think

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
technology person so I'd like to think

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.889 
technology person so I'd like to think
if<00:02:02.460> I<00:02:02.610> could<00:02:02.880> choose<00:02:03.060> where<00:02:03.329> I<00:02:03.360> was<00:02:03.479> born<00:02:03.659> I'd

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
if I could choose where I was born I'd

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.139 
if I could choose where I was born I'd
probably<00:02:04.110> be<00:02:04.350> born<00:02:04.619> in<00:02:04.829> a<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.700> media<00:02:05.969> center

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
probably be born in a the media center

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.639 
probably be born in a the media center
of<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.450> world<00:02:06.600> would<00:02:06.810> probably<00:02:07.200> America<00:02:07.560> at

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
of the world would probably America at

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.040 
of the world would probably America at
the<00:02:07.680> time<00:02:07.860> and<00:02:08.179> 100<00:02:09.179> years<00:02:09.360> ago<00:02:09.539> i'm<00:02:09.660> gonna<00:02:09.869> say

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
the time and 100 years ago i'm gonna say

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.869 
the time and 100 years ago i'm gonna say
give<00:02:10.259> or<00:02:10.349> take<00:02:10.500> hopefully<00:02:10.920> I'd<00:02:11.039> be<00:02:11.160> able<00:02:11.280> to<00:02:11.370> be

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
give or take hopefully I'd be able to be

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:12.949 
give or take hopefully I'd be able to be
around<00:02:12.030> Hollywood<00:02:12.510> and<00:02:12.660> all<00:02:12.720> that<00:02:12.870> stuff

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
around Hollywood and all that stuff

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.760 
around Hollywood and all that stuff
started<00:02:13.470> up

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
started up

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:14.990 
started up
I think<00:02:14.010> it'd<00:02:14.070> be<00:02:14.100> really<00:02:14.190> cool<00:02:14.550> maybe<00:02:14.910> even

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
I think it'd be really cool maybe even

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.400 
I think it'd be really cool maybe even
just<00:02:15.180> photography<00:02:15.870> I've<00:02:16.050> always<00:02:16.200> found

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
just photography I've always found

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:17.810 
just photography I've always found
photography<00:02:16.980> especially<00:02:17.130> I'll<00:02:17.430> photography

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
photography especially I'll photography

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.940 
photography especially I'll photography
extremely<00:02:18.240> interesting<00:02:18.690> so<00:02:18.900> I<00:02:19.110> think<00:02:19.710> that'd

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
extremely interesting so I think that'd

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.710 
extremely interesting so I think that'd
be<00:02:20.040> cool<00:02:20.220> but<00:02:20.460> as<00:02:20.760> always<00:02:21.150> I<00:02:21.450> do<00:02:21.510> with<00:02:21.660> these

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
be cool but as always I do with these

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.270 
be cool but as always I do with these
commentaries<00:02:22.050> that<00:02:22.170> go<00:02:22.320> specifically<00:02:22.860> me<00:02:23.130> and

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
commentaries that go specifically me and

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.700 
commentaries that go specifically me and
in<00:02:23.400> general<00:02:24.050> generally<00:02:25.050> a<00:02:25.080> hundred<00:02:25.410> years<00:02:25.560> ago

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
in general generally a hundred years ago

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.030 
in general generally a hundred years ago
I<00:02:26.010> think<00:02:26.550> that<00:02:27.240> if<00:02:27.630> I<00:02:28.350> was<00:02:28.470> born<00:02:28.710> hundred<00:02:28.920> years

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
I think that if I was born hundred years

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.880 
I think that if I was born hundred years
ago<00:02:29.220> it<00:02:29.430> be<00:02:29.580> weird<00:02:29.820> and<00:02:30.470> obviously<00:02:31.470> it<00:02:31.740> would

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
ago it be weird and obviously it would

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.370 
ago it be weird and obviously it would
be<00:02:31.950> weird<00:02:32.070> but<00:02:32.340> I<00:02:32.790> just<00:02:33.600> think<00:02:33.690> that<00:02:33.930> there

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
be weird but I just think that there

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.230 
be weird but I just think that there
there<00:02:34.890> wasn't<00:02:35.100> much<00:02:35.310> to<00:02:35.490> do<00:02:35.730> but<00:02:36.000> people

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
there wasn't much to do but people

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.660 
there wasn't much to do but people
didn't<00:02:36.480> know<00:02:36.570> any<00:02:36.780> better<00:02:36.810> i<00:02:37.170> mean<00:02:37.710> i<00:02:37.920> am<00:02:38.280> a<00:02:38.310> big

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
didn't know any better i mean i am a big

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.550 
didn't know any better i mean i am a big

something amazing and i will do calm I

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.320 
something amazing and i will do calm I
what<00:02:42.990> if<00:02:43.110> on<00:02:43.290> the<00:02:43.410> future<00:02:43.740> for<00:02:44.250> them<00:02:44.400> I<00:02:44.640> just

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
what if on the future for them I just

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.240 
what if on the future for them I just
think<00:02:45.480> it's<00:02:45.780> so<00:02:46.110> amazing<00:02:46.350> to<00:02:46.590> think<00:02:46.710> how<00:02:47.040> far

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
think it's so amazing to think how far

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.130 
think it's so amazing to think how far
we've<00:02:47.460> come<00:02:47.490> in<00:02:47.730> a<00:02:47.850> hundred<00:02:48.120> years<00:02:48.210> I<00:02:48.630> think

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
we've come in a hundred years I think

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.110 
we've come in a hundred years I think
this<00:02:49.230> is<00:02:49.290> the<00:02:49.410> round<00:02:49.620> of<00:02:49.740> time<00:02:49.920> when<00:02:50.190> M<00:02:50.370> it's

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
this is the round of time when M it's

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.550 
this is the round of time when M it's
little<00:02:51.330> anecdote<00:02:51.750> I<00:02:51.780> heard<00:02:52.170> when<00:02:52.350> I<00:02:52.380> was<00:02:52.500> a<00:02:52.530> kid

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
little anecdote I heard when I was a kid

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.950 
little anecdote I heard when I was a kid
but<00:02:53.010> they<00:02:53.190> filed<00:02:53.460> someone<00:02:54.360> said<00:02:54.600> there's<00:02:54.840> no

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 
but they filed someone said there's no
