personally<00:02:21.920> I<00:02:21.950> find<00:02:22.190> it<00:02:22.370> to<00:02:22.459> be<00:02:22.489> just<00:02:22.580> fine<00:02:23.030> the

00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:23.629 
personally I find it to be just fine the

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:25.690

game<00:02:23.870> is<00:02:24.019> not<00:02:24.230> slow<00:02:24.530> at<00:02:24.680> all<00:02:24.830> which<00:02:25.340> is<00:02:25.489> really

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
game is not slow at all which is really

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.699 
game is not slow at all which is really
a<00:02:25.819> good<00:02:26.090> thing<00:02:26.150> and<00:02:26.599> I<00:02:26.989> think<00:02:27.019> for<00:02:27.379> its<00:02:27.500> time

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
a good thing and I think for its time

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:29.740 
a good thing and I think for its time
the<00:02:28.040> game<00:02:28.220> looks<00:02:28.459> really<00:02:28.849> good<00:02:29.060> there<00:02:29.480> isn't

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
the game looks really good there isn't

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.119 
the game looks really good there isn't
much<00:02:29.780> for<00:02:30.050> music<00:02:30.409> in<00:02:30.530> this<00:02:30.650> game<00:02:30.709> and<00:02:31.010> you're

probably<00:02:31.310> wondering<00:02:31.760> why<00:02:31.970> don't<00:02:32.180> hear<00:02:32.330> any

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
i'm going to review the atari 2600 port

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.059 
i'm going to review the atari 2600 port
of<00:03:33.579> asteroids<00:03:34.120> the<00:03:34.719> atari<00:03:34.989> 2600<00:03:35.560> port<00:03:35.980> of

00:03:37.649 --> 00:03:37.659 
asteroids was developed and published by

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:40.830 
asteroids was developed and published by
Atari<00:03:38.109> and<00:03:38.349> it<00:03:38.709> was<00:03:38.829> released<00:03:39.129> in<00:03:39.310> 1981<00:03:40.150> it<00:03:40.599> is

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
Atari and it was released in 1981 it is

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.839 
Atari and it was released in 1981 it is
a<00:03:40.870> conversion<00:03:41.349> of<00:03:41.530> the<00:03:41.590> arcade<00:03:42.009> game<00:03:42.250> which<00:03:42.699> I

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:42.849 
a conversion of the arcade game which I

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:44.399 
a conversion of the arcade game which I
would<00:03:43.000> find<00:03:43.239> really<00:03:43.449> weird<00:03:43.750> if<00:03:43.900> they<00:03:43.989> did<00:03:44.169> try

00:03:44.399 --> 00:03:44.409 
would find really weird if they did try

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:46.439 
would find really weird if they did try
to<00:03:44.470> completely<00:03:44.829> change<00:03:44.919> the<00:03:45.370> game<00:03:45.549> I<00:03:45.819> mean<00:03:46.239> it

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:46.449 
to completely change the game I mean it

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:47.729 
to completely change the game I mean it
wouldn't<00:03:46.629> really<00:03:46.720> make<00:03:46.959> any<00:03:47.139> sense<00:03:47.470> then

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
wouldn't really make any sense then

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:49.649 
wouldn't really make any sense then
especially<00:03:48.310> with<00:03:48.669> a<00:03:48.699> simple<00:03:49.090> game<00:03:49.209> like<00:03:49.449> this

00:03:49.649 --> 00:03:49.659 
especially with a simple game like this

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:51.809 
especially with a simple game like this
the<00:03:50.319> graphics<00:03:50.560> for<00:03:50.829> asteroids<00:03:51.310> on<00:03:51.459> the<00:03:51.519> Atari

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:51.819 
the graphics for asteroids on the Atari

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:54.240 
the graphics for asteroids on the Atari
2600<00:03:52.329> are<00:03:52.780> pretty<00:03:53.139> good<00:03:53.349> for<00:03:53.560> its<00:03:53.709> time<00:03:53.919> now

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
2600 are pretty good for its time now

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:55.949 
2600 are pretty good for its time now
compared<00:03:54.849> to<00:03:54.939> the<00:03:55.030> arcade<00:03:55.359> version<00:03:55.389> this<00:03:55.900> is

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
compared to the arcade version this is

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:57.839 
compared to the arcade version this is
in<00:03:56.229> color<00:03:56.470> which<00:03:56.979> is<00:03:57.129> a<00:03:57.159> nice<00:03:57.370> little<00:03:57.609> feature

00:03:57.839 --> 00:03:57.849 
in color which is a nice little feature

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:00.119 
in color which is a nice little feature
the<00:03:58.479> game<00:03:58.689> doesn't<00:03:58.930> glitch<00:03:59.229> at<00:03:59.349> all<00:03:59.470> which<00:03:59.949> is

00:04:00.119 --> 00:04:00.129 
the game doesn't glitch at all which is

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:01.949 
the game doesn't glitch at all which is
great<00:04:00.430> the<00:04:00.849> music<00:04:01.180> and<00:04:01.329> sound<00:04:01.540> effects<00:04:01.810> are

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
great the music and sound effects are

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:03.449 
great the music and sound effects are
okay<00:04:02.259> I<00:04:02.500> wouldn't<00:04:02.979> say<00:04:03.099> they<00:04:03.250> are<00:04:03.340> the

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
okay I wouldn't say they are the

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:05.069 
okay I wouldn't say they are the
greatest<00:04:03.759> and<00:04:04.150> i<00:04:04.419> have<00:04:04.540> to<00:04:04.689> say<00:04:04.720> that<00:04:04.989> the

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:05.079 
greatest and i have to say that the

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:07.110 
greatest and i have to say that the
music<00:04:05.349> is<00:04:05.439> a<00:04:05.500> little<00:04:05.859> bit<00:04:05.979> off<00:04:06.189> but<00:04:06.729> other<00:04:06.909> than

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
music is a little bit off but other than

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.059 
music is a little bit off but other than
that<00:04:07.180> I<00:04:07.329> can't<00:04:07.479> complain<00:04:08.019> too<00:04:08.229> much<00:04:08.259> the

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:09.069 
that I can't complain too much the

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:10.770 
that I can't complain too much the
controls<00:04:09.489> once<00:04:09.699> again<00:04:09.879> are<00:04:10.150> very<00:04:10.329> simple<00:04:10.689> and

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
controls once again are very simple and

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.629 
controls once again are very simple and
easy<00:04:10.989> and<00:04:11.259> you<00:04:11.650> should<00:04:11.889> have<00:04:12.069> any<00:04:12.220> problems

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:12.639 
easy and you should have any problems

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:14.520 
easy and you should have any problems
with<00:04:12.699> them<00:04:12.849> at<00:04:13.000> all<00:04:13.150> if<00:04:13.509> I<00:04:13.720> had<00:04:13.840> read<00:04:14.019> the<00:04:14.199> Atari

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
with them at all if I had read the Atari

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.560 
with them at all if I had read the Atari
2600<00:04:15.040> port<00:04:15.459> of<00:04:15.549> asteroids<00:04:16.030> I<00:04:16.150> would<00:04:16.299> give<00:04:16.449> it

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
2600 port of asteroids I would give it

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:17.999 
2600 port of asteroids I would give it
an<00:04:16.659> eight<00:04:16.810> out<00:04:16.959> of<00:04:16.989> ten<00:04:17.289> it's<00:04:17.320> a<00:04:17.620> pretty<00:04:17.799> good

00:04:17.999 --> 00:04:18.009 
an eight out of ten it's a pretty good

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:19.890 
an eight out of ten it's a pretty good
port<00:04:18.370> and<00:04:18.579> with<00:04:18.729> the<00:04:18.849> limitations<00:04:19.209> the<00:04:19.570> Atari

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
port and with the limitations the Atari

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.439 
port and with the limitations the Atari
2600<00:04:20.440> has<00:04:20.829> to<00:04:21.310> me<00:04:21.459> the<00:04:21.639> game<00:04:21.789> is<00:04:21.940> just<00:04:22.150> as<00:04:22.300> good

00:04:22.439 --> 00:04:22.449 
2600 has to me the game is just as good

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:24.120 
2600 has to me the game is just as good
as<00:04:22.599> the<00:04:22.719> arcade<00:04:23.080> version<00:04:23.110> if<00:04:23.740> you<00:04:23.860> have<00:04:23.949> never

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
as the arcade version if you have never

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:25.529 
as the arcade version if you have never
played<00:04:24.310> asteroids<00:04:24.909> you<00:04:25.000> can<00:04:25.150> probably<00:04:25.330> pick

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:25.539 
played asteroids you can probably pick

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:27.749 
played asteroids you can probably pick
up<00:04:25.719> one<00:04:25.900> of<00:04:25.930> the<00:04:26.050> ports<00:04:26.349> on<00:04:26.530> ebay<00:04:26.979> and<00:04:27.190> probably

for a real cheap price as for the arcade
cabinet<00:04:30.460> it<00:04:30.580> might<00:04:30.759> be<00:04:30.880> a<00:04:30.909> little<00:04:31.090> bit<00:04:31.270> hard<00:04:31.449> to
