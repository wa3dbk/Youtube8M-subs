than<00:03:17.550> we<00:03:17.790> have<00:03:17.970> and<00:03:18.210> allowed<00:03:18.570> less<00:03:19.290> points

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.520 
than we have and allowed less points
scored<00:03:20.400> against<00:03:20.760> them<00:03:20.940> so<00:03:21.020> right<00:03:22.020> now<00:03:22.050> they're

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
looking like the better team we might be

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.540 
looking like the better team we might be
a<00:03:25.200> little<00:03:25.380> bit<00:03:25.560> more<00:03:25.710> hot<00:03:26.010> right<00:03:26.280> now<00:03:26.490> the

a little bit more hot right now the

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
winning seven in a row but anything can

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.880 
winning seven in a row but anything can
change<00:03:29.910> at<00:03:30.300> any<00:03:30.390> given<00:03:30.900> moment<00:03:30.930> beating<00:03:31.860> the
