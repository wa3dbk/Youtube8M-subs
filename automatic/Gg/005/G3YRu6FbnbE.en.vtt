 launched in the second quarter of 2013 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:46.260
 their dimensions are very similar 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.090
 only changes that the thickness of 0.1 millimeter 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.840
 it's nothing personal 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:54.510
 Both have touch screen capacitive screen 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:58.050
 resolution from 240 320 to 3 inches 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:04.530
 with a density of 133 points I could 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:08.720
 per pixel and is low but for 3 inches 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:11.310
 Staff is very good, it does not require much 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.990
 so many points so pros by 103 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.960
 inches on staff 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:19.320
 both are multi touch and the types ae 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.720
 had arm and mp3 link tones they will have the 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.210
 speaker output and headphone jack 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.869
 and will be the entry for 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:31.110
 memory up to 32GB and will each have 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:34.530
 the internal memory of 4 gb that only 512 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.600
 - the personal run you 'll know later 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.000
 Why? Because 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:43.140
 What makes me angry is we going to have a 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.540
 gprs edge but samsung star has not 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:50.520
 to fight because it has three while 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:51.810
 neopop 87.2 downloads impostante 36 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.590
 Upload 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:58.799
 both have it going fai bgn wifi hotspot 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:04.619
 also the bluetooth the protour of each one 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:07.530
 is version 4.0 will not have red and it already 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.450
 Comes with standard micro usb 2.0 port 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.550
 for data transfer and for the 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.650
 career on the computer as well 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:17.159
 the primary camera and each is 26 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:19.470
 pixels and saw this movie to review the 

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:22.079
 at 15 fps 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.209
 samsung star will not have front camera 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:26.129
 the two will not have front camera is 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:28.010
 staff thought the other would have both 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:31.109
 they will have a front-facing camera only 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.420
 which is the rear camera here 

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:36.859
 that makes me a little angry 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:40.819
 android of the two will be the 4.1.2 jelly bean 

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:45.030
 oo samsung star it has 1 gigiga hertz 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:49.489
 cpu while the package of 850 as the 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:52.920
 samsung makes a mobile phone in 512 mb of ram 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:57.060
 1 running 850 meters another running at 1 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:59.340
 ghz single co run the dialog in 4.1.2 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:06.689
 that is samsung 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:11.129
 the tablet oppressed or pedro 1010 and others 

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:13.980
 cell phones there is sos1 for example 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:18.269
 could also be updated in version 4 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:21.090
 of rubin but samsung did not do this or 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:23.549
 either she does not want to have the job of 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.010
 update these old devices and 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:29.010
 that is and she prefers to create devices 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:31.409
 new ones for you to buy devices 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.810
 new or was looking for: 

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:36.989
 sell the appliance than you can than 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:39.569
 develop is the android for 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:42.060
 old devices that could rotate yes 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:44.940
 without any problem but it seems that she 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.829
 no no effort in this regard I 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:51.479
 I have samsung galaxy player 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:53.459
 it has 1 ghz of speed and 515 2 

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:57.359
 If I am not mistaken, I would not 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:59.970
 will not have projects for 4.1.2 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:02.819
 14 04 he will stay two colon three 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.419
 6 points Personal're so can not really 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:07.470
 understand 

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:11.430
 the galaxy player that I have it has the 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:13.739
 identical settings to samsung 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:16.470
 galaxy is so this is what leaves me 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:18.389
 revolted the galaxy is it has only 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:21.090
 an accelerometer while I can not have 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:24.000
 accelerometer proximity and compass 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:26.340
 the message types is the default for 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.810
 also two standard patterns that any 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.889
 other 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:32.600
 smartphone phone the brass html for both 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:36.350
 one face at 5 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:40.430
 the two will have fm radio with rds and can 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:42.830
 you can record there ô ô ô fm 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:46.220
 I hope it's better than the s3 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:48.590
 mini usb searches are a sadness the fmi 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:51.889
 these two devices 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:54.169
 the Samsung comes out does not come with GPS and NeoPop 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:54.950
 it comes with GPS with gps support and 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:59.630
 glonass 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:05:02.720
 both will have some resident already samsung 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:05.930
 star will have three colors 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:07.580
 we will have three colors for him and neopop 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:12.229
 just one color 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:15.260
 we have all these programs around these 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:17.720
 programs installed in each 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:21.080
 this also takes up space in the 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:23.000
 device memory and both will have a 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.669
 battery of 1,200 milan peres which is a 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:29.270
 a little weaker compared to the 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:32.330
 other mid-range smartphones is 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:34.010
 this is more personal basic line 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:38.720
 so thats it i did a comparative of 

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:43.039
 samsung star s5230 and the galaxy pocketnow 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:44.630

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:49.669
