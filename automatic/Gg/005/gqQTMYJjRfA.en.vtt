00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.250 
your meter is going to slowly start to

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:52.740 
your meter is going to slowly start to
move<00:00:51.489> down<00:00:51.700> once<00:00:52.090> it<00:00:52.210> gets<00:00:52.360> all<00:00:52.540> the<00:00:52.600> way<00:00:52.690> to

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:52.750 
move down once it gets all the way to

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.319 
move down once it gets all the way to
the<00:00:52.840> bottom<00:00:53.020> you<00:00:53.710> will<00:00:53.739> win<00:00:54.010> the<00:00:54.129> match<00:00:54.309> and<00:00:54.610> as

the bottom you will win the match and as

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:56.850 
the bottom you will win the match and as
the<00:00:55.450> match<00:00:55.600> progresses<00:00:56.020> your<00:00:56.469> Minnesota

starts<00:00:57.160> to<00:00:57.250> move<00:00:57.370> a<00:00:57.520> lot<00:00:57.640> faster<00:00:58.110> essentially

00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.110 
starts to move a lot faster essentially

starts to move a lot faster essentially
we've<00:00:59.320> got<00:00:59.469> two<00:00:59.829> separate<00:01:00.640> levels<00:01:00.789> that<00:01:01.059> are

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 
we've got two separate levels that are

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.090 
we've got two separate levels that are
built<00:01:01.390> you<00:01:02.110> know<00:01:02.230> imagine<00:01:02.590> the<00:01:02.680> level<00:01:02.829> that's

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
built you know imagine the level that's

you're<00:01:15.430> gonna<00:01:15.550> see<00:01:15.700> this<00:01:15.789> constantly

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:16.299 
you're gonna see this constantly

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:17.820 
you're gonna see this constantly
flipping<00:01:16.540> back<00:01:16.810> and<00:01:16.840> forth<00:01:17.020> you<00:01:17.530> know<00:01:17.560> it<00:01:17.740> gets

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:17.830 
flipping back and forth you know it gets

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:19.260 
flipping back and forth you know it gets
a<00:01:17.920> little<00:01:18.010> bit<00:01:18.159> crazy<00:01:18.310> and<00:01:18.790> you<00:01:18.909> have<00:01:19.030> to<00:01:19.119> get

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
a little bit crazy and you have to get

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:20.580 
a little bit crazy and you have to get
used<00:01:19.450> to<00:01:19.540> your<00:01:19.630> orientation<00:01:20.049> but<00:01:20.380> it<00:01:20.470> is

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
used to your orientation but it is

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.219 
used to your orientation but it is
pretty<00:01:20.740> cool

an inversion is the intelligent AI
that's<00:01:28.770> implemented<00:01:29.159> on<00:01:29.430> two<00:01:29.610> guys<00:01:29.820> who<00:01:30.000> are

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
that's implemented on two guys who are

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.480 
that's implemented on two guys who are
constantly<00:01:30.360> shooting<00:01:30.810> at<00:01:31.049> your<00:01:31.200> face<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.649> the

go ahead against groups of AI conversion
what<00:01:45.869> we<00:01:45.990> have<00:01:46.140> is<00:01:46.439> a<00:01:46.470> four<00:01:46.829> player<00:01:47.009> co-op<00:01:47.310> mode

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
what we have is a four player co-op mode

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.789 
what we have is a four player co-op mode
called<00:01:48.149> survival<00:01:48.569> and<00:01:48.929> we<00:01:49.380> built<00:01:49.649> these

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
called survival and we built these

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.919 
called survival and we built these
exclusive<00:01:50.460> maps<00:01:50.670> just<00:01:51.119> for<00:01:51.270> this<00:01:51.360> mode<00:01:51.630> these

00:01:51.919 --> 00:01:51.929 
exclusive maps just for this mode these

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:53.960 
exclusive maps just for this mode these
aren't<00:01:52.170> regular<00:01:52.500> normal<00:01:52.950> NP<00:01:53.280> maps<00:01:53.520> and<00:01:53.729> then

will<00:03:51.780> so<00:03:52.500> I<00:03:52.530> mean<00:03:52.800> it's<00:03:52.950> a<00:03:53.010> great<00:03:53.220> way<00:03:53.370> to

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
will so I mean it's a great way to

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.910 
will so I mean it's a great way to
encourage<00:03:53.790> gravity<00:03:54.270> gameplay<00:03:54.660> and<00:03:54.960> you<00:03:55.830> know

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
encourage gravity gameplay and you know

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.080 
encourage gravity gameplay and you know
hopefully<00:03:56.070> we'll<00:03:56.430> find<00:03:56.460> a<00:03:56.700> lot<00:03:56.820> of<00:03:56.850> players

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
current king gravity but after that it's

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:42.890 
current king gravity but after that it's
normal<00:04:41.580> part<00:04:41.910> right<00:04:42.090> it's<00:04:42.240> where<00:04:42.419> we<00:04:42.450> can<00:04:42.690> get
