00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:12.210
 So today is the Quad Copter Hebrew 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:14.580
 xo 1 07 le a model quad cut to go through the review 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:21.090
 IU called 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:23.970
 The first thing I would like to introduce is that with Cody Cote, 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:28.470
 I have four like this . 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:32.340
 I ran it , and this gave me that concept. 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.960
 There's a little more abstraction these days. 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.699
 Well 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:40.879
 But that's what I came up with as a prototype quadcopter. 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:46.129
 The battery is a bit of a rumor logo. 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:47.239
 In this way , you can use such a battery that can be obtained from a regular rc consensus shop 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:50.590
 There is 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:53.770
 The battery capacity is probably 350 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:57.100
 I'll buy you a medium hair. Maybe. 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:01:01.360
 And if you see 1 battery 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:06.220
 Find out which will make the insertion into the hole 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:11.530
 If you plug in and plug it in, 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:16.280
 If you connect these two codes, it will be powered on 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:19.100
 Once you look back, 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:25.090
 Looking forward to seeing you somewhere 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:28.840
 It looks like a little frog shape. 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:31.550
 It's like the design concept 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:35.450
 Once you see 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:39.590
 Now we connect the mat first. 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:41.680
 The light comes on the screen. 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:46.990
 This is what the controller is doing 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:54.000
 If you have a country button and turn on the font, pairing is complete 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:57.880
 They won both the raw materials and indeyo all-to-all model and now has won its normal 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.910
 In-Western writing a lot for the United States and Europe, 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:06.369
 Well, there's a lot of circles. 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:10.360
 Example: All circles fall down on the left, 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:17.230
 Oh gonna do it Banya Gwangyang adjustable back stick 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:22.630
 There is something like that. It is usually right in Japan or in Korea. 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:26.350
 There are many ways that the throttle geolro We're here to see another way-Western 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:30.040
 All the way to say in Europe or America 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:35.220
 I am using the control I have adopted 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.220
 Let 's try a test flight. 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.100
 Come in. 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.640
 It is very stable with old citizens. 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:57.830
 If the battery has been increasing copper flashing there is this this way 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.830
 I do not much matter now, Terry 3, where the impact 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:09.880
 What you see my room now, you know, now dressed in a precisely calculated positions are 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:12.390
 It's wide, but it's not exactly what I intended. 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.390
 I'm a little lazy 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:23.510
 The experience of two quad-core lungs is great in a very windy outdoor environment 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:27.019
 Cut. 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:30.500
 And if you look at this button, 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:33.920
 Press the right button that 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.239
 There can switch to the Extreme mode, the speed is really switching to track mode 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:39.340
 Fast 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:39.340
 It's hard to control adult 2 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:48.989
 Well, you can fly like this. 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.989
 No one will run. I do not have a lot of batteries. 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:04:00.000
 I actually ran in a very swollen environment that sweated, 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:04.670
 Very stable cut. 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.670
 I will deploy the tunnel once. 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:13.780
 If you have any further questions, I will upload the video again. 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:13.780
 First 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:20.759
 A similar Expo wherein 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.759
 I'll finish reviewing Elle's 107 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.950
 Bye
