00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
you get into but certainly I don't think

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.320 
you get into but certainly I don't think
there's<00:02:27.720> a<00:02:27.780> you<00:02:28.349> know<00:02:28.470> with<00:02:28.620> Marcus<00:02:29.040> now<00:02:29.330> fit

and<00:02:30.569> in<00:02:30.690> shape<00:02:30.720> I<00:02:31.230> don't<00:02:31.410> think<00:02:31.650> there's<00:02:31.860> a

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
and in shape I don't think there's a

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.920 
and in shape I don't think there's a
team<00:02:32.220> in<00:02:32.430> the<00:02:32.489> league<00:02:32.670> with<00:02:32.910> with<00:02:33.599> two<00:02:33.750> better

but you know that sort of stuff but you

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:48.080 
but you know that sort of stuff but you
know<00:02:46.769> my<00:02:46.980> positioning<00:02:47.489> I<00:02:47.610> thought<00:02:47.819> was<00:02:48.000> pretty

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
know my positioning I thought was pretty

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.440 
know my positioning I thought was pretty
good<00:02:48.360> and<00:02:49.640> you<00:02:50.640> know<00:02:50.760> I<00:02:50.790> read<00:02:51.030> a<00:02:51.060> couple<00:02:51.239> of

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
good and you know I read a couple of

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.150 
good and you know I read a couple of
threw<00:02:51.630> balls<00:02:51.870> came<00:02:52.260> and<00:02:52.410> took<00:02:52.500> a<00:02:52.560> cross<00:02:52.830> but

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
threw balls came and took a cross but

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.830 
threw balls came and took a cross but
you<00:02:53.819> know<00:02:53.910> there's<00:02:54.090> always<00:02:54.330> things<00:02:54.510> you<00:02:54.660> could

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
you know there's always things you could

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.059 
you know there's always things you could
improve<00:02:55.080> on<00:02:55.290> you<00:02:55.530> know<00:02:55.650> there<00:02:55.769> was<00:02:55.830> one<00:02:56.010> I

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
improve on you know there was one I

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:57.710 
improve on you know there was one I
caught<00:02:56.610> and<00:02:56.819> I<00:02:56.880> could<00:02:57.030> have<00:02:57.120> just<00:02:57.269> chested<00:02:57.599> it

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
caught and I could have just chested it

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:58.940 
caught and I could have just chested it
down<00:02:57.870> and<00:02:58.110> waist<00:02:58.260> a<00:02:58.349> little<00:02:58.440> bit<00:02:58.620> more<00:02:58.739> time

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
down and waist a little bit more time

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.039 
down and waist a little bit more time
and<00:02:59.190> I<00:02:59.340> think<00:02:59.940> I<00:03:00.120> could<00:03:00.269> throw<00:03:00.750> the<00:03:00.840> ball<00:03:01.019> a

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
and I think I could throw the ball a

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:02.449 
and I think I could throw the ball a
little<00:03:01.230> bit<00:03:01.380> more<00:03:01.590> which<00:03:01.799> Ziggy's<00:03:02.190> probably

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
little bit more which Ziggy's probably

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.479 
little bit more which Ziggy's probably
gonna<00:03:02.549> give<00:03:03.330> me<00:03:03.420> a<00:03:03.450> near<00:03:03.569> fall<00:03:03.870> but<00:03:04.470> I'm<00:03:05.010> not

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
gonna give me a near fall but I'm not

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.039 
gonna give me a near fall but I'm not
used<00:03:05.670> to<00:03:05.760> giving<00:03:05.940> the<00:03:06.090> ball<00:03:06.239> out<00:03:06.420> I'm<00:03:06.810> used<00:03:06.989> to

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
used to giving the ball out I'm used to

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:08.720 
used to giving the ball out I'm used to
pump<00:03:07.260> it<00:03:07.410> as<00:03:07.560> far<00:03:07.769> as<00:03:07.890> I<00:03:07.950> can<00:03:08.010> you<00:03:08.459> know<00:03:08.610> in

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
pump it as far as I can you know in
