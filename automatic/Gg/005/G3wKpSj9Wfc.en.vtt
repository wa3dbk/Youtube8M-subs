00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
told you guys that I had started using

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.830 
told you guys that I had started using
this<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.550> week<00:00:47.730> of<00:00:48.000> when<00:00:48.390> my<00:00:48.629> school

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
this the week of when my school

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.540 
this the week of when my school
homecoming<00:00:49.079> and<00:00:49.559> I<00:00:49.890> thought<00:00:50.100> it<00:00:50.309> might<00:00:50.460> have

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
homecoming and I thought it might have

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.250 
homecoming and I thought it might have
broken<00:00:50.760> me<00:00:50.940> out<00:00:51.059> but<00:00:51.300> I<00:00:51.329> also<00:00:51.690> wasn't<00:00:52.050> sure<00:00:52.199> if

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
broken me out but I also wasn't sure if

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.569 
broken me out but I also wasn't sure if
that<00:00:52.410> was<00:00:52.530> because<00:00:52.559> of<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:53.039> stress<00:00:53.430> of

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
that was because of the stress of

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.459 
that was because of the stress of
homecoming<00:00:54.000> week<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:54.719> I<00:00:54.780> really<00:00:55.110> think<00:00:55.350> it

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
homecoming week and I really think it

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.200 
homecoming week and I really think it
was<00:00:55.620> because<00:00:55.920> I<00:00:56.250> have<00:00:56.489> not<00:00:56.640> broken<00:00:56.850> out<00:00:57.059> with

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
was because I have not broken out with

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.619 
was because I have not broken out with
this<00:00:57.329> this<00:00:57.629> time<00:00:57.870> around<00:00:58.079> so<00:00:58.800> I<00:00:58.829> think<00:00:59.239> that<00:01:00.239> it

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
this this time around so I think that it

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.209 
this this time around so I think that it
was<00:01:00.780> just<00:01:00.989> a<00:01:01.079> stress<00:01:01.260> homecoming<00:01:01.680> week<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:02.010> I

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
was just a stress homecoming week and I

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.229 
was just a stress homecoming week and I
feel<00:01:02.340> like<00:01:02.460> it's<00:01:02.579> been<00:01:02.670> working<00:01:02.850> better<00:01:03.059> since

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
feel like it's been working better since

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.329 
feel like it's been working better since
I<00:01:03.390> paired<00:01:03.660> it<00:01:03.780> with<00:01:03.809> my<00:01:04.080> setup<00:01:04.739> a<00:01:04.890> moisturizer

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
I paired it with my setup a moisturizer

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.880 
I paired it with my setup a moisturizer
because<00:01:05.700> I<00:01:05.970> was<00:01:06.570> just<00:01:06.810> using<00:01:06.990> it<00:01:07.229> by<00:01:07.439> itself

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
because I was just using it by itself

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.450 
because I was just using it by itself
and<00:01:08.130> my<00:01:08.670> face<00:01:08.880> felt<00:01:09.240> dry<00:01:09.780> for<00:01:10.770> some<00:01:10.920> reason<00:01:11.220> and

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
and my face felt dry for some reason and

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.070 
and my face felt dry for some reason and
I<00:01:11.790> didn't<00:01:12.330> feel<00:01:12.420> like<00:01:12.479> there's<00:01:12.720> enough<00:01:12.900> so

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
I didn't feel like there's enough so

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.810 
I didn't feel like there's enough so
once<00:01:13.229> I<00:01:13.320> started<00:01:13.560> mixing<00:01:13.680> it<00:01:13.979> with<00:01:14.130> it<00:01:14.310> I<00:01:14.490> felt

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
once I started mixing it with it I felt

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.219 
once I started mixing it with it I felt
that<00:01:15.030> it<00:01:15.240> was<00:01:15.390> working<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:15.900> lot<00:01:15.930> more

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
that it was working a lot more

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.870 
that it was working a lot more
effectively<00:01:16.740> when<00:01:17.340> I<00:01:17.369> wake<00:01:17.580> up<00:01:17.670> in<00:01:17.790> the

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880
