00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:16.070
 Russia's largest robotic 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.540
 farm opened her sick of scam area 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.520
 in the village of noodle scoop 

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:21.710
 German company which has long been 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.230
 works in our region has invested in this 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.060
 project 400 million rubles but you 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.759
 livestock complex is designed for 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:31.640
 1800 head of cattle but it is still in the plans 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:34.160
 Now the barn for 440 heads is working 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.350
 maternity ward and the robot barely Lyakh 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.680
 present and future enterprise sergey 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.149
 novels milking robots continue 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.220
 walk through our area 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:45.260
 here is another farm decided to refuse 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.840
 from manual labor and call for help 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.360
 automaton and the truth is the solution it did not come 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.400
 just farms are still big a 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.720
 This region of our robots have become 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.940
 mostly small farms 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.940
 but after a month of work, the main investor 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:02.120
 admitted mental agony were in vain 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:04.339
 just three months ago I honestly say 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.619
 schlansky why not hot wine 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:09.920
 make a mistake driven up differed 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:14.360
 which are really all souls 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.020
 your mistake ie experience from 1 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.510
 month 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.920
 and further our experts that you already 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.870
 continue skeptical they are now 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.670
 recognizes that before this goes well 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.830
 modern technology milking 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.450
 used in the company before on their 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.040
 agricultural enterprises are mainly 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.140
 milking carousel system 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.970
 but here are some robots 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.860
 skepticism but the regional ministry of agriculture 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.600
 found the right words 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.490
 to still convince the German 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.580
 partners turn a look at agricultural 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.590
 robot headgear headlights police dealers 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.110
 largest companies on setting 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.970
 robots I naturally speak shtepa but 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.799
 as you will agitate you must on 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.830
 his own example in his household 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:52.970
 put and then I think that 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.990
 agitate no one else you 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.700
 will be 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.560
 on show already directly 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.380
 production now in the enterprise 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.570
 working until two robots a day they 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.280
 will be able to serve 120 cows 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.700
 but in the plans when in the farm soaked 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:10.160
 all 1800 cows will work here 32
