we have a grind stock allowance which
means<00:01:37.210> the<00:01:37.420> Machine<00:01:37.780> Rapids<00:01:38.380> to<00:01:38.500> a<00:01:38.530> start

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
means the Machine Rapids to a start

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.280 
means the Machine Rapids to a start
position<00:01:39.100> then<00:01:40.000> it<00:01:40.150> starts<00:01:40.450> the<00:01:40.570> grind<00:01:40.810> cycle

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 
position then it starts the grind cycle

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.230 
position then it starts the grind cycle
so<00:01:41.650> then<00:01:41.800> from<00:01:42.040> there<00:01:42.280> we<00:01:42.909> have<00:01:43.000> three

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
so then from there we have three

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.080 
so then from there we have three
possibilities<00:01:43.810> a<00:01:44.290> B<00:01:45.010> and<00:01:45.159> C<00:01:45.340> or<00:01:45.460> positions

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090

that's<00:01:46.450> rough<00:01:46.780> medium<00:01:47.260> and<00:01:47.440> fine<00:01:47.650> and<00:01:48.040> then<00:01:48.880> D

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
that's rough medium and fine and then D

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.350 
that's rough medium and fine and then D
E<00:01:49.570> and<00:01:49.960> F<00:01:50.170> are<00:01:50.440> how<00:01:50.890> quick<00:01:51.310> we<00:01:51.490> go<00:01:51.670> from<00:01:51.940> A<00:01:52.150> to<00:01:52.180> B

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
E and F are how quick we go from A to B

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.320 
E and F are how quick we go from A to B
B<00:01:53.020> to<00:01:53.050> C<00:01:53.229> and<00:01:53.650> then<00:01:53.890> C<00:01:53.920> to<00:01:54.280> finish<00:01:54.610> sighs<00:01:54.820> all

B to C and then C to finish sighs all

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.550 
B to C and then C to finish sighs all
the<00:01:55.509> cycles<00:01:55.900> have<00:01:56.050> three<00:01:56.259> steps<00:01:56.530> in<00:01:56.740> them<00:01:58.560> so

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
the cycles have three steps in them so

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.380 
the cycles have three steps in them so
first<00:02:00.009> operation<00:02:00.700> was<00:02:00.880> a<00:02:00.909> plunge<00:02:01.210> with

diameter is now complete I then did a

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.440 
diameter is now complete I then did a
shoulder<00:02:08.289> plunge<00:02:08.590> with<00:02:08.830> oscillation<00:02:09.520> and<00:02:09.729> you

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
shoulder plunge with oscillation and you

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:11.910 
shoulder plunge with oscillation and you

shoulder on the workpiece is higher than

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.479 
shoulder on the workpiece is higher than
what<00:02:14.290> the<00:02:14.380> height<00:02:14.560> of<00:02:14.709> the<00:02:14.769> grinding<00:02:15.160> wheel<00:02:15.310> is

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
what the height of the grinding wheel is

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.370 
what the height of the grinding wheel is
so<00:02:15.670> we'd<00:02:15.820> have<00:02:15.850> to<00:02:16.090> make<00:02:16.239> a<00:02:16.269> an<00:02:16.630> oscillation

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
so we'd have to make a an oscillation

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.790 
so we'd have to make a an oscillation
move<00:02:17.709> on<00:02:17.920> it<00:02:18.420> and<00:02:19.420> once<00:02:19.989> again<00:02:20.170> if<00:02:20.470> you<00:02:20.590> see

I<00:02:48.510> didn't<00:02:49.510> swivel<00:02:49.870> the<00:02:49.959> wheel<00:02:50.159> 240<00:02:51.159> degrees

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
I didn't swivel the wheel 240 degrees

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:54.210 
I didn't swivel the wheel 240 degrees
the<00:02:51.849> original<00:02:52.299> setup<00:02:52.510> was<00:02:52.810> 30<00:02:53.109> I'm<00:02:53.859> now<00:02:54.069> going

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
the original setup was 30 I'm now going

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:55.619 
the original setup was 30 I'm now going
to<00:02:54.310> grind<00:02:54.489> 10<00:02:54.849> degree<00:02:55.150> taper<00:02:55.359> on<00:02:55.599> the

00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:55.629 
to grind 10 degree taper on the

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:58.710 
to grind 10 degree taper on the
workpiece<00:02:56.079> so<00:02:56.530> I<00:02:56.829> manually<00:02:57.430> move<00:02:57.909> to<00:02:58.060> be<00:02:58.239> axes

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
workpiece so I manually move to be axes

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.140

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.740 
parallel setup and I can plunge on a
taper<00:03:03.700> so<00:03:04.599> I<00:03:04.629> do<00:03:04.720> this<00:03:04.989> two<00:03:05.260> times<00:03:06.510> there's<00:03:07.510> the

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
taper so I do this two times there's the

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.839 
taper so I do this two times there's the
first<00:03:07.900> operation<00:03:08.709> with<00:03:09.040> plunge<00:03:09.370> on<00:03:09.579> taper

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:17.349 
taper and for this feature what I did is

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:20.309 
taper and for this feature what I did is
I<00:03:17.470> just<00:03:17.500> copied<00:03:18.220> and<00:03:18.400> pasted<00:03:19.060> it<00:03:19.359> and<00:03:19.540> I<00:03:20.139> only

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:20.319 
I just copied and pasted it and I only

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:22.110 
I just copied and pasted it and I only
change<00:03:20.590> dimensionally<00:03:21.220> to<00:03:21.430> features<00:03:21.879> other

00:03:36.149 --> 00:03:36.159 
internal grinding wheel I let the

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:38.699 
internal grinding wheel I let the
Machine<00:03:36.250> know<00:03:36.700> via<00:03:37.209> this<00:03:37.420> icon<00:03:37.930> that<00:03:38.109> it's<00:03:38.290> ID

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
Machine know via this icon that it's ID

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:40.409 
Machine know via this icon that it's ID
grinding<00:03:39.400> so<00:03:39.549> I<00:03:39.579> have<00:03:39.760> a<00:03:39.790> bore<00:03:40.060> approach

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:40.419 
grinding so I have a bore approach

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:44.069 
grinding so I have a bore approach
position<00:03:41.849> but<00:03:42.849> then<00:03:43.000> I<00:03:43.030> did<00:03:43.359> a<00:03:43.389> multi<00:03:43.810> plunge

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:44.079 
position but then I did a multi plunge

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:46.650 
position but then I did a multi plunge
and<00:03:44.290> Traverse<00:03:44.709> on<00:03:44.859> the<00:03:45.010> board<00:03:45.310> meaning<00:03:45.760> the

and Traverse on the board meaning the

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.990 
and Traverse on the board meaning the
width<00:03:46.900> of<00:03:47.049> the<00:03:47.169> pore<00:03:47.440> was<00:03:48.220> wider<00:03:48.579> than<00:03:48.879> the

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
width of the pore was wider than the

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.490 
width of the pore was wider than the
width<00:03:49.150> of<00:03:49.299> the<00:03:49.389> wheel<00:03:49.599> so<00:03:49.810> I<00:03:49.840> can<00:03:50.049> do<00:03:50.230> it<00:03:50.319> in<00:03:50.410> a

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
width of the wheel so I can do it in a

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:51.990 
width of the wheel so I can do it in a
single<00:03:50.709> plunge<00:03:51.129> I<00:03:51.280> had<00:03:51.400> to<00:03:51.519> do<00:03:51.639> it<00:03:51.760> in<00:03:51.879> the

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
single plunge I had to do it in the

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.939 
single plunge I had to do it in the
multiple<00:03:52.449> plunge

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:52.949 
multiple plunge

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:56.099
