00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.690 
here's some new progress on the drift
trike<00:00:06.290> starting<00:00:07.290> with<00:00:07.500> the<00:00:07.620> frame<00:00:07.890> got<00:00:08.550> the

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
trike starting with the frame got the

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.259 
trike starting with the frame got the
forks<00:00:09.030> mounted<00:00:09.780> on<00:00:09.960> the<00:00:10.200> down<00:00:10.349> tube

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:14.269 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:24.390 

everything's<00:00:15.269> all<00:00:15.389> welded<00:00:15.660> up<00:00:15.870> here

Boyd<00:00:38.570> 65<00:00:39.380> on<00:00:39.980> YouTube<00:00:40.489> for<00:00:40.910> his<00:00:41.410> video<00:00:42.410> on<00:00:42.770> how

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:42.950 
Boyd 65 on YouTube for his video on how

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.799 
Boyd 65 on YouTube for his video on how
to<00:00:43.010> modify<00:00:43.460> the<00:00:43.670> Harbor<00:00:44.300> Freight<00:00:44.770> to<00:00:45.770> bender

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:46.809 
to modify the Harbor Freight to bender

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:50.740 
to modify the Harbor Freight to bender
basically<00:00:47.809> it's<00:00:48.580> just<00:00:49.580> this<00:00:49.760> piece<00:00:50.090> that<00:00:50.450> goes

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
basically it's just this piece that goes

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:58.750 
basically it's just this piece that goes
over<00:00:51.050> the<00:00:51.170> die<00:00:54.340> so<00:00:55.340> the<00:00:55.990> die<00:00:56.990> you<00:00:57.520> drill<00:00:58.520> a<00:00:58.550> hole

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
over the die so the die you drill a hole

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.210 
over the die so the die you drill a hole
through<00:00:58.790> it<00:00:59.090> right<00:00:59.300> there<00:00:59.650> and<00:01:00.650> then<00:01:00.980> you<00:01:01.070> get

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:01.220 
through it right there and then you get

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:07.210 
through it right there and then you get
a<00:01:01.250> piece<00:01:01.490> of<00:01:01.550> that<00:01:03.339> 1/8<00:01:04.339> inch<00:01:05.200> then<00:01:06.200> did<00:01:06.440> put<00:01:07.190> a

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
a piece of that 1/8 inch then did put a

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.510 
a piece of that 1/8 inch then did put a
nut<00:01:07.940> on<00:01:07.970> top<00:01:08.390> with<00:01:08.600> a<00:01:08.630> bolt<00:01:09.160> and<00:01:10.160> then<00:01:10.310> that

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
nut on top with a bolt and then that

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:20.830 
nut on top with a bolt and then that
goes<00:01:12.040> there<00:01:18.820> and<00:01:19.820> what<00:01:20.000> it<00:01:20.119> does<00:01:20.390> is<00:01:20.630> basically

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
goes there and what it does is basically

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.800 
goes there and what it does is basically
you<00:01:21.649> put<00:01:21.890> your<00:01:22.040> tube<00:01:22.250> in<00:01:22.520> and<00:01:23.210> it<00:01:23.420> holds<00:01:23.630> it

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
you put your tube in and it holds it

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.940 
you put your tube in and it holds it
down<00:01:23.990> so<00:01:24.350> it<00:01:24.470> doesn't<00:01:24.500> kink<00:01:25.009> up<00:01:25.580> at<00:01:25.759> this<00:01:25.940> area

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
down so it doesn't kink up at this area

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.160 
down so it doesn't kink up at this area
did<00:01:27.950> some<00:01:28.130> really<00:01:28.520> good<00:01:28.670> bends<00:01:29.119> right<00:01:29.330> here

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
did some really good bends right here

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.700 
did some really good bends right here
without<00:01:31.009> any<00:01:31.399> kinks<00:01:31.910> in<00:01:32.119> it<00:01:32.330> as<00:01:33.229> well<00:01:33.470> as<00:01:33.679> here

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
without any kinks in it as well as here

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.930 
without any kinks in it as well as here
down<00:01:36.710> at<00:01:36.890> the<00:01:36.950> bottom<00:01:37.009> I<00:01:39.550> got<00:01:40.550> a<00:01:40.580> couple<00:01:40.819> more

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
down at the bottom I got a couple more

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.109 
down at the bottom I got a couple more
bends<00:01:41.509> to<00:01:41.780> do<00:01:41.929> when<00:01:42.229> some<00:01:42.729> straight<00:01:43.729> pieces

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
bends to do when some straight pieces

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:45.630 
bends to do when some straight pieces
that<00:01:44.270> are<00:01:44.330> going<00:01:44.420> to<00:01:44.479> go<00:01:44.630> right<00:01:44.780> here<00:01:45.319> and

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
that are going to go right here and

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.749 
that are going to go right here and
along<00:01:46.640> the<00:01:46.700> back<00:01:47.500> around<00:01:48.500> here<00:01:49.069> build<00:01:49.520> it<00:01:49.670> up

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
along the back around here build it up

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:55.300 
along the back around here build it up
right<00:01:49.940> there<00:01:53.619> might<00:01:54.619> be<00:01:54.800> putting<00:01:55.009> some<00:01:55.220> more

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
right there might be putting some more

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
right there might be putting some more
braces<00:01:55.850> in<00:01:56.090> between<00:01:56.780> here<00:01:57.459> too<00:01:58.459> for<00:01:58.729> the<00:01:58.910> motor

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 
braces in between here too for the motor

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.510 
braces in between here too for the motor
mount<00:01:59.569> which<00:01:59.929> I<00:02:00.050> got<00:02:00.229> from<00:02:00.410> VMI<00:02:00.890> carting<00:02:01.369> a

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
mount which I got from VMI carting a

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:08.580 
mount which I got from VMI carting a

front here I had to redo retour actually
make<00:05:07.050> a<00:05:10.220> bracket<00:05:11.220> for<00:05:11.250> it<00:05:14.479> yes<00:05:16.760> that's<00:05:17.760> gonna

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:17.910 
make a bracket for it yes that's gonna

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:23.570 
make a bracket for it yes that's gonna
go<00:05:18.120> in<00:05:18.270> here

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:23.580 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:26.190 

so<00:05:24.580> to<00:05:24.640> go<00:05:24.790> back<00:05:24.820> and<00:05:25.120> forth<00:05:25.360> section<00:05:25.810> goes<00:05:26.020> up

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:26.200 
so to go back and forth section goes up

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:34.800 
so to go back and forth section goes up
just<00:05:30.300> to<00:05:31.300> compress<00:05:31.720> the<00:05:31.840> piston<00:05:32.050> and<00:05:33.810> these

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:34.810 
just to compress the piston and these

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:39.480 
just to compress the piston and these
are<00:05:35.260> the<00:05:36.030> pegs<00:05:37.030> that<00:05:37.300> I'm<00:05:37.450> putting<00:05:37.780> on<00:05:38.460> so<00:05:39.460> I

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:39.490 
are the pegs that I'm putting on so I

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:42.300 
are the pegs that I'm putting on so I
got<00:05:39.670> to<00:05:39.760> mount<00:05:39.850> those<00:05:41.100> figure<00:05:42.100> out<00:05:42.190> where

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:42.310 
got to mount those figure out where

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:47.000 
got to mount those figure out where
they're<00:05:42.430> gonna<00:05:42.490> be<00:05:43.170> mounted<00:05:44.170> comfortably<00:05:45.780> and

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.010

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:06.100 
GSXR street bike and I had to modify it

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:11.940 
GSXR street bike and I had to modify it
to<00:06:06.790> work<00:06:07.000> with<00:06:09.000> with<00:06:10.000> this<00:06:10.210> project<00:06:10.840> and<00:06:11.620> I<00:06:11.740> had

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:11.950 
to work with with this project and I had

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:15.480 
to work with with this project and I had
to<00:06:12.100> basically<00:06:12.670> make<00:06:12.970> this<00:06:14.460> connection<00:06:15.460> right

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:15.490 
to basically make this connection right

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:23.720 
to basically make this connection right
here<00:06:15.840> which<00:06:16.840> is<00:06:16.870> going<00:06:17.020> to<00:06:17.170> be<00:06:17.290> mounted<00:06:17.770> to

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:23.730 

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:28.100 

the<00:06:24.270> calliper<00:06:24.810> are<00:06:25.170> actually<00:06:25.560> the<00:06:27.110> reservoir

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:28.110 
the calliper are actually the reservoir

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:38.840 
the calliper are actually the reservoir
tank<00:06:28.350> and<00:06:32.060> go<00:06:33.060> like<00:06:33.240> this<00:06:36.320> and<00:06:37.730> you're<00:06:38.730> gonna

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:38.850 
tank and go like this and you're gonna

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:43.070 
tank and go like this and you're gonna
compress<00:06:39.270> the<00:06:39.450> piston<00:06:39.980> right<00:06:40.980> there<00:06:41.510> and<00:06:42.510> then

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:43.080 
compress the piston right there and then

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:48.260 
compress the piston right there and then
this<00:06:43.440> will<00:06:44.280> be<00:06:44.400> mounted<00:06:44.930> here<00:06:46.310> with<00:06:47.310> the<00:06:47.520> screw

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:48.270 
this will be mounted here with the screw

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:53.260 
this will be mounted here with the screw
flush<00:06:48.960> mount<00:06:51.110> and<00:06:52.110> then<00:06:52.470> there'll<00:06:52.650> be<00:06:52.710> another

on<00:06:55.680> to<00:06:56.550> the<00:06:56.640> foot<00:06:56.850> the<00:06:57.080> tubing<00:06:58.080> that<00:06:58.350> comes<00:06:58.560> out

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:02.360 

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:10.300 

and<00:07:03.360> then<00:07:03.780> I<00:07:03.990> couldn't<00:07:04.290> figure<00:07:04.590> it<00:07:04.770> out

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:10.310 

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:12.770 

other<00:07:11.310> than<00:07:11.490> that<00:07:11.730> I<00:07:12.000> think<00:07:12.390> I'm<00:07:12.510> done<00:07:12.750> for

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:12.780 
other than that I think I'm done for

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:17.720 
other than that I think I'm done for
today<00:07:14.780> probably<00:07:15.780> get<00:07:15.900> some<00:07:16.080> more<00:07:16.200> done<00:07:16.610> in<00:07:17.610> the

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:17.730 
today probably get some more done in the

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:20.930 
today probably get some more done in the
next<00:07:17.880> couple<00:07:18.270> of<00:07:18.300> days<00:07:19.400> get<00:07:20.400> everything<00:07:20.610> lined

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:20.940 
next couple of days get everything lined

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:24.080 
next couple of days get everything lined
up<00:07:21.180> and<00:07:21.420> then<00:07:21.930> once<00:07:22.620> I<00:07:22.800> finish<00:07:23.280> putting<00:07:23.490> on<00:07:23.790> the
