00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
to do it through a shady way which is

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.000 
to do it through a shady way which is
going<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.420> install<00:00:48.780> us<00:00:48.989> but<00:00:49.260> I<00:00:49.469> justify<00:00:49.950> this

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
going to install us but I justify this

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.250 
going to install us but I justify this
because<00:00:50.489> it's<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.300> only<00:00:51.360> way<00:00:51.660> really<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:52.050> do

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
because it's the only way really to do

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.420 
because it's the only way really to do
it<00:00:52.410> so<00:00:52.649> how<00:00:52.920> this<00:00:53.100> works<00:00:53.399> is<00:00:53.670> you<00:00:53.789> can<00:00:53.940> type

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
it so how this works is you can type

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.450 
it so how this works is you can type
with<00:00:56.750> motions<00:00:57.750> of<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.140> keyboard<00:00:58.350> so<00:00:59.070> if<00:00:59.370> I

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
with motions of the keyboard so if I

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.279 
with motions of the keyboard so if I
want<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.730> say<00:00:59.940> something<00:01:00.000> like<00:01:00.510> what's<00:01:00.870> up<00:01:01.079> i

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
want to say something like what's up i

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:08.660 
want to say something like what's up i
could<00:01:01.469> just<00:01:01.620> go<00:01:02.090> what's<00:01:03.140> up<00:01:06.290> YouTube<00:01:07.670> and

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670

you'll<00:01:08.850> see<00:01:09.000> it<00:01:09.119> types<00:01:09.390> that<00:01:09.630> for<00:01:09.869> me<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.200> if

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
you'll see it types that for me and if

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.109 
you'll see it types that for me and if
you're<00:01:10.920> good<00:01:11.189> at<00:01:11.310> this<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:11.670> I'm<00:01:11.790> not<00:01:11.970> in<00:01:12.060> the

you're good at this and I'm not in the
best<00:01:12.240> position<00:01:12.479> but<00:01:12.840> I<00:01:12.869> can<00:01:13.110> type<00:01:13.790> quite<00:01:14.790> fast

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
best position but I can type quite fast

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.910 
best position but I can type quite fast
especially<00:01:16.080> if<00:01:16.350> I<00:01:16.409> don't<00:01:16.590> make<00:01:16.710> a<00:01:16.740> lot<00:01:16.830> of

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
especially if I don't make a lot of

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.910 
especially if I don't make a lot of
mistakes<00:01:17.299> it's<00:01:18.320> great<00:01:19.320> for<00:01:19.590> typing

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
mistakes it's great for typing

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.280 
mistakes it's great for typing
especially<00:01:20.460> with<00:01:20.610> one<00:01:20.850> hand<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.750> downsides

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
especially with one hand the downsides

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.160 
especially with one hand the downsides
are<00:01:22.530> it<00:01:23.009> doesn't<00:01:23.640> get<00:01:24.030> too<00:01:24.270> many<00:01:24.570> of<00:01:24.689> like

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
are it doesn't get too many of like

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.289 
are it doesn't get too many of like
names<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:26.159> such<00:01:26.369> so<00:01:26.850> you<00:01:26.939> have<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.180> enter

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
names and such so you have to enter

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.899 
names and such so you have to enter
those<00:01:27.570> in<00:01:27.840> separately<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.650> you<00:01:29.400> can't<00:01:29.610> use<00:01:29.729> it

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
those in separately and you can't use it

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.819 
those in separately and you can't use it
out<00:01:30.060> of<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.360> app<00:01:30.540> but<00:01:31.259> if<00:01:31.350> you<00:01:31.439> do<00:01:31.560> want<00:01:31.770> to

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
out of the app but if you do want to

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.230

like<00:01:31.979> write<00:01:32.189> a<00:01:32.220> paragraph<00:01:32.430> really<00:01:32.880> quickly

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
like write a paragraph really quickly

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.480 
like write a paragraph really quickly
this<00:01:33.869> might<00:01:34.049> be<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.500> best<00:01:34.650> way<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:34.890> do<00:01:35.070> it<00:01:35.189> so

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
this might be the best way to do it so

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.700
