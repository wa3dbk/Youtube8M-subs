in<00:00:13.889> general<00:00:14.280> and<00:00:14.460> it<00:00:14.610> is<00:00:14.730> called<00:00:15.030> the<00:00:15.269> bose

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719

in general and it is called the bose
noble<00:00:16.199> ice<00:00:16.410> it's<00:00:17.220> called<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.580> ice<00:00:17.760> because

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
noble ice it's called the ice because

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.540 
noble ice it's called the ice because
it's<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.300> lower<00:00:18.480> value<00:00:19.410> of<00:00:19.560> all<00:00:19.800> three<00:00:20.160> of<00:00:20.400> the

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
it's the lower value of all three of the

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.040 
it's the lower value of all three of the
set<00:00:20.789> and<00:00:21.000> this<00:00:21.270> because<00:00:21.630> it's<00:00:21.750> only<00:00:21.930> a

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
set and this because it's only a

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.230 
set and this because it's only a
cardioid<00:00:22.560> mic<00:00:22.920> this<00:00:23.490> means<00:00:23.789> it's<00:00:23.939> not<00:00:24.029> good

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
cardioid mic this means it's not good

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.849 
cardioid mic this means it's not good

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.250 
for podcast with multiple people in the
room<00:00:25.980> I<00:00:26.430> got<00:00:26.820> this<00:00:26.939> off<00:00:27.090> of<00:00:27.119> Amazon<00:00:27.599> for<00:00:27.630> 46

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
room I got this off of Amazon for 46

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.950 
room I got this off of Amazon for 46
pounds<00:00:28.439> it<00:00:28.710> was<00:00:28.800> reduced<00:00:29.220> from<00:00:29.400> around<00:00:30.090> 55<00:00:30.750> so

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
pounds it was reduced from around 55 so

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.650 
pounds it was reduced from around 55 so
I<00:00:30.990> thought<00:00:31.170> it<00:00:31.289> was<00:00:31.410> a<00:00:31.439> good<00:00:31.590> deal<00:00:31.769> at<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.070> time

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
I thought it was a good deal at the time

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.910 
I thought it was a good deal at the time
personally<00:00:33.660> I<00:00:33.690> think<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:34.110> mic<00:00:34.260> looks<00:00:34.530> really

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
personally I think the mic looks really

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.799 
personally I think the mic looks really
nice<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.430> it's<00:00:35.790> got<00:00:35.850> really<00:00:35.969> nice<00:00:36.270> feel<00:00:36.570> to<00:00:36.600> it

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
nice and it's got really nice feel to it

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.780 
nice and it's got really nice feel to it
and<00:00:36.899> really<00:00:37.110> nice<00:00:37.260> weight<00:00:37.610> looking<00:00:38.610> at<00:00:38.700> the

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
and really nice weight looking at the

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.549 
and really nice weight looking at the
back<00:00:38.969> of<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.149> mic<00:00:39.360> again<00:00:39.870> looks<00:00:40.140> really<00:00:40.230> nice

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
back of the mic again looks really nice

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.830 
back of the mic again looks really nice
I<00:00:40.829> think<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.579> three<00:00:41.879> mesh<00:00:42.180> plates<00:00:42.540> on<00:00:42.690> either

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
I think the three mesh plates on either

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.229 
I think the three mesh plates on either
side<00:00:43.200> of<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.469> mic<00:00:43.680> just<00:00:43.950> helps<00:00:44.610> to<00:00:44.730> add<00:00:44.879> a<00:00:44.910> bit

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
side of the mic just helps to add a bit

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.970 
side of the mic just helps to add a bit
more<00:00:45.270> character<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:45.840> it<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.500> input<00:00:46.770> plug

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
more character to it and the input plug

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.200 
more character to it and the input plug
is<00:00:47.160> nice<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:47.550> big<00:00:47.670> you<00:00:47.820> know<00:00:47.940> what<00:00:48.090> you're

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
is nice and big you know what you're

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.880 
is nice and big you know what you're
doing<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:48.629> there's<00:00:48.989> no<00:00:49.050> way<00:00:49.379> you<00:00:49.440> can<00:00:49.649> really

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
doing and there's no way you can really

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.010 
doing and there's no way you can really
make<00:00:50.039> a<00:00:50.070> mistake<00:00:50.219> with<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.730> setup<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.750> stand

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
make a mistake with the setup the stand

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.540 
make a mistake with the setup the stand
as<00:00:52.199> well<00:00:52.230> so<00:00:52.559> quite<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:52.800> lot<00:00:52.980> of<00:00:53.039> weight<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.250> it

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
as well so quite a lot of weight to it

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.790 
as well so quite a lot of weight to it
and<00:00:53.670> it's<00:00:54.539> more<00:00:54.750> metal<00:00:55.110> than<00:00:55.230> plastic<00:00:55.440> and

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
and it's more metal than plastic and

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.099 
and it's more metal than plastic and
that's<00:00:55.860> really<00:00:56.070> nice<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.550> see<00:00:56.750> going<00:00:57.750> onto<00:00:58.020> the

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
that's really nice to see going onto the

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.170 
that's really nice to see going onto the
USB<00:00:58.230> stick<00:00:58.590> it's<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.070> very<00:00:59.370> very<00:00:59.699> good<00:00:59.789> cable

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
USB stick it's a very very good cable

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.180 
USB stick it's a very very good cable
it's<00:01:00.870> got<00:01:01.109> mesh<00:01:01.469> around<00:01:01.649> it<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.070> it's

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
it's got mesh around it and it's

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.830 
it's got mesh around it and it's
incredibly<00:01:02.760> strong<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.270> you<00:01:03.329> do<00:01:03.449> really

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
incredibly strong and you do really

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.960 
incredibly strong and you do really
really<00:01:04.080> well<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.500> break<00:01:04.680> it<00:01:04.979> it's<00:01:05.460> also<00:01:05.580> really

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
really well to break it it's also really

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.910 
really well to break it it's also really
large<00:01:06.240> it's<00:01:06.450> about<00:01:06.600> 6<00:01:06.960> foot<00:01:07.200> long<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.560> cable

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
large it's about 6 foot long the cable

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.469 
large it's about 6 foot long the cable

that's really good to see it's because

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.390 
that's really good to see it's because
with<00:01:30.900> small<00:01:31.229> vibrations<00:01:31.799> on<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:31.979> table<00:01:32.340> it

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
with small vibrations on the table it

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.800 
with small vibrations on the table it
doesn't<00:01:32.670> pick<00:01:32.850> up<00:01:33.000> and<00:01:33.180> it's<00:01:33.299> really<00:01:33.479> easy<00:01:33.720> to

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
doesn't pick up and it's really easy to

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.170 
doesn't pick up and it's really easy to
fold<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:34.380> place<00:01:34.590> down<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.700> three<00:01:35.939> rubber

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
fold and place down the three rubber

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.210 
fold and place down the three rubber
feet<00:01:36.479> also<00:01:36.960> mean<00:01:37.200> that<00:01:37.380> you<00:01:37.650> won't<00:01:37.770> scratch<00:01:38.070> a

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
feet also mean that you won't scratch a

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.969 
feet also mean that you won't scratch a
desk<00:01:38.430> or<00:01:38.610> table<00:01:38.790> and<00:01:39.180> it<00:01:39.840> also<00:01:40.110> again<00:01:40.530> helps<00:01:40.890> to

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
desk or table and it also again helps to

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.310 
desk or table and it also again helps to
stop<00:01:41.189> some<00:01:41.369> vibrations<00:01:42.000> putting<00:01:42.960> it<00:01:43.020> down<00:01:43.140> it

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
stop some vibrations putting it down it

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.679 
stop some vibrations putting it down it
looks<00:01:43.470> actually<00:01:43.649> really<00:01:43.890> nice<00:01:44.189> and<00:01:44.549> it<00:01:45.390> does

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
looks actually really nice and it does

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.389 
looks actually really nice and it does
not<00:01:45.840> move<00:01:46.110> around<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.530> mic<00:01:46.710> at<00:01:46.890> all<00:01:47.130> last

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
filling it with there and it didn't move

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.469 
filling it with there and it didn't move
at<00:01:49.200> all<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:49.530> it's<00:01:50.280> just<00:01:50.430> a<00:01:50.670> really<00:01:50.939> good<00:01:51.119> stand

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
already tell the difference in sound it

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.280 
already tell the difference in sound it
just<00:02:11.730> doesn't<00:02:12.120> sound<00:02:12.270> right<00:02:12.390> it<00:02:12.690> doesn't<00:02:12.959> pick

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
just doesn't sound right it doesn't pick

just doesn't sound right it doesn't pick
anything<00:02:13.530> up<00:02:13.770> although<00:02:14.340> it's<00:02:14.550> a<00:02:14.610> headset<00:02:14.970> it's

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
anything up although it's a headset it's

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.360 
anything up although it's a headset it's
much<00:02:15.420> close<00:02:15.690> to<00:02:15.959> my<00:02:16.050> mouth<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:16.920> sound<00:02:17.190> just

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
much close to my mouth the sound just

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.220 
much close to my mouth the sound just
doesn't<00:02:17.640> seem<00:02:17.790> to<00:02:17.880> travel<00:02:18.300> it's<00:02:18.420> very<00:02:18.630> crackly

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
doesn't seem to travel it's very crackly

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.900 
doesn't seem to travel it's very crackly
and<00:02:19.620> it<00:02:19.709> changes<00:02:20.100> your<00:02:20.220> tone<00:02:20.400> of<00:02:20.430> voice<00:02:20.580> as

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
well so you can see how much of a

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.990 
well so you can see how much of a
difference<00:02:23.489> that<00:02:23.610> blue<00:02:23.940> snowball<00:02:24.209> makes<00:02:24.739> I've

now gone back to the blue snowball and

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.110 
now gone back to the blue snowball and
you<00:02:28.860> can<00:02:29.010> tell<00:02:29.250> the<00:02:29.400> difference<00:02:29.790> of<00:02:29.880> audio

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
you can tell the difference of audio

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.850 
you can tell the difference of audio
straightaway<00:02:30.660> somewhat<00:02:31.050> richer<00:02:31.500> and<00:02:31.620> so<00:02:31.739> much

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
straightaway somewhat richer and so much

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.620 
straightaway somewhat richer and so much

surprising<00:02:46.319> me<00:02:46.470> how<00:02:46.620> good<00:02:46.890> it<00:02:47.040> really<00:02:47.670> is<00:02:47.819> for

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
surprising me how good it really is for

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.180 
surprising me how good it really is for
the<00:02:48.060> money<00:02:48.269> you<00:02:48.450> pay<00:02:48.660> it<00:02:49.440> comes<00:02:49.650> with<00:02:49.830> a<00:02:49.860> stand

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.699 
picks up the peas in the pronunciation
because<00:03:38.790> it<00:03:38.970> is<00:03:39.090> a<00:03:39.120> good<00:03:39.390> mic<00:03:39.570> this<00:03:40.230> means<00:03:40.530> and

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
because it is a good mic this means and

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.259 
because it is a good mic this means and
sometimes<00:03:41.070> when<00:03:41.250> I<00:03:41.310> breathe<00:03:41.579> you<00:03:41.609> might<00:03:41.940> hear

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
sometimes when I breathe you might hear

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:43.940 
sometimes when I breathe you might hear
in<00:03:42.450> this<00:03:42.600> video<00:03:42.930> if<00:03:43.140> I<00:03:43.260> take<00:03:43.470> a<00:03:43.500> breath<00:03:43.739> between

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
in this video if I take a breath between

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.180

words<00:03:44.310> you<00:03:44.489> can<00:03:44.609> hear<00:03:44.940> that<00:03:45.150> and<00:03:45.560> air<00:03:46.560> this<00:03:47.130> is

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
words you can hear that and air this is

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.830 
words you can hear that and air this is
because<00:03:47.549> the<00:03:47.640> mic<00:03:47.790> is<00:03:47.940> just<00:03:48.120> simply<00:03:48.329> so<00:03:48.570> good

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
because the mic is just simply so good

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.720 
because the mic is just simply so good
so<00:03:49.019> pop<00:03:49.260> filter<00:03:49.590> is<00:03:49.709> needed<00:03:50.100> to<00:03:50.220> cancel<00:03:50.430> out

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
so pop filter is needed to cancel out

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.039 
so pop filter is needed to cancel out
those<00:03:50.910> abbreviations<00:03:51.269> and<00:03:51.930> those

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
pronunciations secondly it is a bit

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.229 
pronunciations secondly it is a bit
plastic<00:03:55.440> I<00:03:55.620> found<00:03:56.070> this<00:03:56.190> out<00:03:56.459> well<00:03:56.880> after<00:03:57.180> I
