00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.710 
so those cameras are just measuring
density<00:02:05.160> the<00:02:05.340> black<00:02:05.550> versus<00:02:05.970> the<00:02:06.119> white<00:02:06.300> so

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
density the black versus the white so

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.419 
density the black versus the white so
this<00:02:06.899> fish<00:02:07.170> pump<00:02:07.410> is<00:02:07.590> cycling<00:02:08.039> on<00:02:08.190> and<00:02:08.220> off

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
this fish pump is cycling on and off

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.370 
this fish pump is cycling on and off
based<00:02:08.729> on<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.149> density<00:02:09.630> to<00:02:09.929> maintain<00:02:10.350> a

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
based on the density to maintain a

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.620 
based on the density to maintain a
constant<00:02:10.709> density<00:02:11.250> of<00:02:11.459> fish<00:02:11.670> in<00:02:11.820> there<00:02:12.000> this

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
constant density of fish in there this

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.140 
constant density of fish in there this
whole<00:02:12.870> mechanism<00:02:13.110> here<00:02:13.650> is<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:14.070> sorter<00:02:14.489> so

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
whole mechanism here is the sorter so

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.590 
whole mechanism here is the sorter so
what's<00:02:16.110> happening<00:02:16.470> here<00:02:16.530> is<00:02:17.540> there's<00:02:18.540> a

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
what's happening here is there's a

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.479 
what's happening here is there's a
camera<00:02:19.410> in<00:02:19.440> each<00:02:19.620> one<00:02:19.800> of<00:02:19.830> these<00:02:19.950> black<00:02:20.190> boxes

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
camera in each one of these black boxes

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.270 
camera in each one of these black boxes
and<00:02:21.140> again<00:02:22.140> if<00:02:22.260> you<00:02:22.350> come<00:02:22.530> over<00:02:22.680> here<00:02:22.799> it's

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
and again if you come over here it's

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.949 
and again if you come over here it's
taking<00:02:23.580> an<00:02:23.670> image<00:02:23.790> of<00:02:24.060> every<00:02:24.360> single<00:02:24.510> fish<00:02:24.810> as

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
taking an image of every single fish as

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.070 
taking an image of every single fish as
it<00:02:25.049> goes<00:02:25.200> down<00:02:25.470> and<00:02:26.040> it<00:02:26.489> uses<00:02:26.700> a<00:02:26.940> equation<00:02:27.840> to

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
it goes down and it uses a equation to

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.630 
it goes down and it uses a equation to
calculate<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.560> overall<00:02:28.739> total<00:02:29.370> length<00:02:29.549> of

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
calculate the overall total length of

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.100 
calculate the overall total length of
the<00:02:29.730> fish<00:02:29.970> within<00:02:30.299> a<00:02:30.510> tenth<00:02:30.750> of<00:02:30.900> the

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
the fish within a tenth of the

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.620 
the fish within a tenth of the
millimeter<00:02:31.700> and<00:02:32.700> that<00:02:32.820> equation<00:02:33.120> is<00:02:33.480> to

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
millimeter and that equation is to

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.240 
millimeter and that equation is to
account<00:02:33.959> for<00:02:34.049> curvature<00:02:34.650> of<00:02:34.680> the<00:02:34.799> fish<00:02:35.040> so

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
account for curvature of the fish so

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.130 
account for curvature of the fish so
that<00:02:35.459> it<00:02:35.519> gets<00:02:35.610> a<00:02:35.790> straight<00:02:36.150> length<00:02:36.390> on<00:02:36.630> it<00:02:36.780> ok

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
that it gets a straight length on it ok

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.740 
that it gets a straight length on it ok
so<00:02:37.950> and<00:02:38.310> in<00:02:38.400> this<00:02:38.519> particular<00:02:38.670> case<00:02:39.180> worldly

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
so and in this particular case worldly

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.330 
so and in this particular case worldly

and they go right back out for pond
what's<00:02:49.380> happening<00:02:49.709> on<00:02:49.829> this<00:02:49.980> one<00:02:50.250> is<00:02:50.489> that

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
what's happening on this one is that

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.090 
what's happening on this one is that
half<00:02:51.239> of<00:02:51.420> what<00:02:51.570> goes<00:02:51.720> through<00:02:51.989> that<00:02:52.019> side<00:02:52.440> is

half of what goes through that side is

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.860 
half of what goes through that side is
sorted<00:02:53.640> two<00:02:53.880> lines<00:02:54.180> that's<00:02:54.630> where<00:02:54.810> the

there's six of the automated lines and

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:02.670 
there's six of the automated lines and
as<00:03:02.070> I<00:03:02.160> mentioned

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
as I mentioned

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.280 
as I mentioned
this<00:03:03.400> order's<00:03:03.849> sort<00:03:04.180> them<00:03:04.329> for<00:03:04.510> size<00:03:04.719> so<00:03:05.079> these

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
this order's sort them for size so these

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.140 
this order's sort them for size so these
six<00:03:05.590> lines<00:03:05.859> are<00:03:06.189> set<00:03:06.400> up<00:03:06.519> for<00:03:06.549> different<00:03:06.969> sized

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
six lines are set up for different sized

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.830 
assistants you'll have to be those
manually<00:03:15.519> so<00:03:15.700> she'll<00:03:15.939> manually<00:03:16.329> clip<00:03:16.540> and<00:03:16.689> tag

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
manually so she'll manually clip and tag

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.250 
manually so she'll manually clip and tag
those<00:03:17.079> fish<00:03:17.459> so<00:03:18.459> each<00:03:19.180> line<00:03:19.540> has<00:03:19.569> its<00:03:20.109> own

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
those fish so each line has its own

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.699 
those fish so each line has its own

what<00:03:24.310> that<00:03:24.489> is<00:03:24.670> that's<00:03:24.879> just<00:03:25.120> an<00:03:25.269> inverted

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
what that is that's just an inverted

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.330 
what that is that's just an inverted
image<00:03:25.959> of<00:03:26.230> the<00:03:26.290> fish<00:03:26.500> that's<00:03:26.980> the<00:03:27.129> Clipper

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
image of the fish that's the Clipper

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.270 
image of the fish that's the Clipper
going<00:03:27.639> and<00:03:27.790> clipping<00:03:28.030> the<00:03:28.120> adipose<00:03:28.480> fin

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
going and clipping the adipose fin

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.009 
going and clipping the adipose fin
there's<00:03:30.280> a<00:03:30.670> sensor<00:03:31.030> on<00:03:31.090> the<00:03:31.209> top<00:03:31.359> of<00:03:31.389> smart<00:03:31.780> for

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
there's a sensor on the top of smart for

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:34.410 
there's a sensor on the top of smart for
when<00:03:32.950> the<00:03:33.069> snout<00:03:33.280> of<00:03:33.310> the<00:03:33.489> fish<00:03:33.670> is<00:03:33.819> detected<00:03:34.329> a

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
when the snout of the fish is detected a

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.300 
when the snout of the fish is detected a
set<00:03:34.599> of<00:03:34.720> clamp<00:03:34.930> which<00:03:35.500> I'll<00:03:35.709> show<00:03:35.919> you<00:03:35.950> a<00:03:36.099> set

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
set of clamp which I'll show you a set

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.729 
set of clamp which I'll show you a set
of<00:03:36.430> clamps<00:03:36.849> so<00:03:37.419> what<00:03:37.569> happens<00:03:37.900> is<00:03:38.049> that<00:03:38.079> sensor

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
of clamps so what happens is that sensor

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:40.830 
of clamps so what happens is that sensor
triggers<00:03:39.189> the<00:03:39.609> clamps<00:03:39.970> gently<00:03:40.389> come<00:03:40.510> together

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
triggers the clamps gently come together

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.929 
triggers the clamps gently come together
to<00:03:41.019> hold<00:03:41.169> the<00:03:41.319> fish<00:03:41.439> in<00:03:41.620> place<00:03:41.859> and<00:03:42.639> then

00:03:42.929 --> 00:03:42.939 
to hold the fish in place and then

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:44.280 
to hold the fish in place and then
there's<00:03:43.150> these<00:03:43.299> other<00:03:43.540> little<00:03:43.720> pads<00:03:44.049> right

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
there's these other little pads right

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.289 
there's these other little pads right
here<00:03:44.349> that<00:03:45.069> are<00:03:45.220> called<00:03:45.400> belly<00:03:45.700> liquors<00:03:46.120> and

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:46.299 
here that are called belly liquors and

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:48.390 
here that are called belly liquors and
the<00:03:46.629> idea<00:03:46.930> behind<00:03:47.079> that<00:03:47.349> is<00:03:47.469> so<00:03:48.010> that<00:03:48.189> it

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
the idea behind that is so that it

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.729 
the idea behind that is so that it
arches<00:03:48.700> the<00:03:48.969> fish<00:03:49.150> is<00:03:49.269> back<00:03:49.510> so<00:03:50.169> the<00:03:50.379> adipose

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739 
arches the fish is back so the adipose

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:52.800 
arches the fish is back so the adipose
fin<00:03:50.919> sticks<00:03:51.310> up<00:03:51.459> very<00:03:51.760> well<00:03:51.819> so<00:03:52.389> they<00:03:52.569> can<00:03:52.689> go

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
fin sticks up very well so they can go

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.839 
fin sticks up very well so they can go
down<00:03:52.989> and<00:03:53.109> get<00:03:53.200> a<00:03:53.260> good<00:03:53.409> clean<00:03:53.680> clip<00:03:53.980> and<00:03:54.189> then

00:03:54.839 --> 00:03:54.849 
down and get a good clean clip and then

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:57.300 
down and get a good clean clip and then
the<00:03:55.389> camera<00:03:56.019> on<00:03:56.079> the<00:03:56.230> line<00:03:56.409> takes<00:03:56.769> two<00:03:57.010> images

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
the camera on the line takes two images

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.280 
the camera on the line takes two images
of<00:03:57.639> every<00:03:57.849> single<00:03:58.030> face<00:03:58.359> well<00:03:58.989> here's<00:03:59.169> the

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
of every single face well here's the

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.199 
of every single face well here's the
first<00:03:59.620> image<00:04:00.010> where<00:04:00.549> it's<00:04:00.700> finding<00:04:01.090> the

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
first image where it's finding the

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:04.740 
first image where it's finding the
center<00:04:01.510> point<00:04:01.739> adipose<00:04:02.739> fin<00:04:03.120> so<00:04:04.120> that's<00:04:04.480> where

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
center point adipose fin so that's where

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.590 
center point adipose fin so that's where
funny<00:04:05.349> mix<00:04:05.650> and<00:04:05.829> wife

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
funny mix and wife

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.180 
funny mix and wife
super<00:04:06.810> knows<00:04:07.020> where<00:04:07.320> to<00:04:07.350> go<00:04:07.530> to<00:04:07.590> cook<00:04:07.830> up<00:04:07.980> in

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
super knows where to go to cook up in

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:13.010 
super knows where to go to cook up in
and<00:04:09.170> there's<00:04:10.170> after<00:04:10.740> it<00:04:10.860> flips<00:04:11.870> the<00:04:12.870> fish

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:13.020 
and there's after it flips the fish

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:14.660 
and there's after it flips the fish
flips<00:04:13.320> its<00:04:13.500> tail<00:04:13.740> or<00:04:14.130> it's<00:04:14.370> the<00:04:14.490> wrong<00:04:14.640> size

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
flips its tail or it's the wrong size

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.600 
flips its tail or it's the wrong size
fish<00:04:15.230> that<00:04:16.230> fish<00:04:16.470> will<00:04:16.620> get<00:04:16.770> rejected<00:04:17.190> each

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:37.950 
what the adipose fin is like grab a fish

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:39.710 
what the adipose fin is like grab a fish
and<00:04:38.070> jeopardy<00:04:38.580> to<00:04:38.700> tell<00:04:38.880> me<00:04:39.000> yeah<00:04:39.180> yeah<00:04:39.390> so

this<00:04:39.930> one<00:04:40.140> right<00:04:40.260> here<00:04:40.320> is<00:04:40.530> missing<00:04:40.860> the<00:04:40.950> pin

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 
this one right here is missing the pin

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.330 
this one right here is missing the pin
right<00:04:41.250> there<00:04:41.520> this<00:04:41.790> one<00:04:42.000> here<00:04:42.150> still<00:04:42.420> has<00:04:42.570> it

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
right there this one here still has it

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.950 
right there this one here still has it
and<00:04:44.340> that<00:04:44.670> one<00:04:44.820> friend<00:04:45.030> missing<00:04:45.390> indicates<00:04:45.840> us

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
and that one friend missing indicates us

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.820 
and that one friend missing indicates us
to<00:04:46.080> tag<00:04:46.320> yep<00:04:46.940> and<00:04:47.940> it's<00:04:48.210> so<00:04:48.540> fast<00:04:48.900> pretty<00:04:49.710> much

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
to tag yep and it's so fast pretty much

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.590 
to tag yep and it's so fast pretty much
into<00:04:50.160> stadium<00:04:50.520> I<00:04:50.610> think<00:04:50.760> it<00:04:50.850> takes<00:04:50.880> 2.1

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 
into stadium I think it takes 2.1

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.120 
into stadium I think it takes 2.1
seconds<00:04:52.020> to<00:04:52.110> actually<00:04:52.380> process<00:04:52.560> a<00:04:52.830> fish

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
seconds to actually process a fish

00:04:53.130 --> 00:05:07.730 
seconds to actually process a fish
between<00:04:53.640> the<00:04:53.940> clip<00:04:54.120> and<00:04:54.270> tags

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.490 

what<00:05:08.520> happens<00:05:08.940> on<00:05:09.060> these<00:05:09.569> lines<00:05:09.900> is<00:05:10.139> the

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
what happens on these lines is the

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.200 
what happens on these lines is the
machine<00:05:10.770> there's<00:05:10.979> a<00:05:11.039> hollow<00:05:11.280> needle<00:05:11.430> that<00:05:12.030> it

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.210 
machine there's a hollow needle that it

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:15.320 
machine there's a hollow needle that it
clip<00:05:12.449> or<00:05:12.720> cuts<00:05:13.020> off<00:05:13.229> a<00:05:13.520> 1.1<00:05:14.520> millimeter<00:05:15.150> long

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
clip or cuts off a 1.1 millimeter long

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.210 
clip or cuts off a 1.1 millimeter long
pieces<00:05:15.630> of<00:05:15.840> wire<00:05:16.080> and<00:05:16.440> that's<00:05:16.919> what's

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:17.220 
pieces of wire and that's what's

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:19.059 
pieces of wire and that's what's
injected<00:05:17.759> into<00:05:18.030> the<00:05:18.150> sand<00:05:18.330> out<00:05:18.419> of<00:05:18.449> the<00:05:18.569> fish

00:05:19.059 --> 00:05:19.069 
injected into the sand out of the fish

00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:22.010 
injected into the sand out of the fish
basically<00:05:20.069> my<00:05:20.520> best<00:05:20.759> analogy<00:05:21.270> for<00:05:21.569> this<00:05:21.780> is

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020 
basically my best analogy for this is

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.469 
basically my best analogy for this is
it's<00:05:22.349> a<00:05:22.440> six-digit<00:05:22.800> numerical<00:05:23.580> code<00:05:23.819> so<00:05:24.150> if

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:24.479 
it's a six-digit numerical code so if

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:26.240 
it's a six-digit numerical code so if
you<00:05:24.660> look<00:05:24.870> under<00:05:25.169> a<00:05:25.410> microscope<00:05:25.470> with<00:05:26.130> this

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.250 
you look under a microscope with this

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:28.430 
you look under a microscope with this
wire<00:05:26.460> it<00:05:26.699> just<00:05:26.910> repetitively<00:05:27.509> says<00:05:27.870> that<00:05:28.080> over

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 
wire it just repetitively says that over

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.309 
wire it just repetitively says that over
and<00:05:28.560> over<00:05:28.680> and<00:05:28.889> over<00:05:29.090> this<00:05:30.090> wire<00:05:30.479> is<00:05:30.509> actually

00:05:31.309 --> 00:05:31.319 
and over and over this wire is actually

00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:33.020 
and over and over this wire is actually
like<00:05:31.470> given<00:05:31.770> a<00:05:31.860> specific<00:05:32.069> group<00:05:32.520> of<00:05:32.639> fish<00:05:32.849> a

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:33.030 
like given a specific group of fish a

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:34.760 
like given a specific group of fish a
social<00:05:33.270> security<00:05:33.720> number<00:05:33.990> if<00:05:34.199> you<00:05:34.440> put<00:05:34.650> the

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:34.770 
social security number if you put the

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:36.559
