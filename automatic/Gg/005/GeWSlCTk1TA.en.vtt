bearing on the transmission and what I'm

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.880 
bearing on the transmission and what I'm
doing<00:01:08.050> is<00:01:08.170> I'm<00:01:08.350> trying<00:01:08.710> to<00:01:08.890> check<00:01:09.190> the<00:01:09.729> clutch

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
doing is I'm trying to check the clutch

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.120 
doing is I'm trying to check the clutch
for<00:01:11.890> clearance<00:01:12.369> and<00:01:12.759> check<00:01:13.569> the<00:01:13.780> draw<00:01:14.709> bearing

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130

for clearance and check the draw bearing
how<00:01:15.490> much<00:01:15.640> travel<00:01:15.940> it<00:01:16.179> has<00:01:16.360> how<00:01:17.259> much<00:01:17.410> it<00:01:17.590> moves

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:17.800 
how much travel it has how much it moves

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.490 
how much travel it has how much it moves
the<00:01:17.979> diaphragm<00:01:18.429> fingers<00:01:18.850> on<00:01:19.090> the<00:01:19.330> on<00:01:20.319> the

the diaphragm fingers on the on the
pressure<00:01:20.740> plate<00:01:20.890> and<00:01:22.410> I<00:01:23.410> had<00:01:23.950> to<00:01:24.160> kind<00:01:24.940> of<00:01:25.060> mock

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:25.300 
pressure plate and I had to kind of mock

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.260 
pressure plate and I had to kind of mock
up<00:01:25.509> a<00:01:25.660> spacer<00:01:26.319> to<00:01:26.349> go<00:01:26.740> between<00:01:26.920> the<00:01:27.190> stock<00:01:27.910> flex

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
up a spacer to go between the stock flex

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.919 
up a spacer to go between the stock flex
plate<00:01:28.599> that's<00:01:29.200> attached<00:01:30.069> directly<00:01:30.280> to<00:01:30.610> the<00:01:30.929> to

00:01:31.919 --> 00:01:31.929 
plate that's attached directly to the to

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:35.580 
plate that's attached directly to the to
the<00:01:32.020> rear<00:01:32.200> of<00:01:32.229> the<00:01:32.380> crank<00:01:32.709> and<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:34.630> spacer

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
the rear of the crank and the spacer

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.699 
the rear of the crank and the spacer
goes<00:01:35.800> between<00:01:36.090> that<00:01:37.090> and<00:01:37.360> the<00:01:37.840> aluminum

00:01:38.699 --> 00:01:38.709 
goes between that and the aluminum

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:40.980 
goes between that and the aluminum
flywheel<00:01:38.950> the<00:01:39.490> flywheel<00:01:40.149> had<00:01:40.330> to<00:01:40.450> go<00:01:40.569> inside

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
flywheel the flywheel had to go inside

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.050 
flywheel the flywheel had to go inside
the<00:01:41.170> bell<00:01:41.319> housing<00:01:41.470> deeper<00:01:42.069> then<00:01:42.550> the<00:01:42.849> stock

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
the bell housing deeper then the stock

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.630 
the bell housing deeper then the stock
flex<00:01:43.450> plate<00:01:43.690> goes<00:01:43.929> in<00:01:44.200> and<00:01:44.470> I<00:01:45.099> couldn't<00:01:45.429> just

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
flex plate goes in and I couldn't just

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.580 
flex plate goes in and I couldn't just
use<00:01:45.880> the<00:01:46.090> stock<00:01:46.300> flywheel<00:01:46.840> because<00:01:47.170> it<00:01:47.289> just

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
use the stock flywheel because it just

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.080 
use the stock flywheel because it just
doesn't<00:01:47.830> go<00:01:48.009> in<00:01:48.190> far<00:01:48.459> enough<00:01:48.580> so<00:01:48.729> I<00:01:48.849> had<00:01:48.910> to

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
doesn't go in far enough so I had to

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.630 
doesn't go in far enough so I had to
remove<00:01:49.360> the<00:01:49.539> ring<00:01:49.780> gear<00:01:50.050> off<00:01:50.289> of<00:01:51.009> the<00:01:51.190> flywheel

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
remove the ring gear off of the flywheel

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.669 
remove the ring gear off of the flywheel
so<00:01:54.640> the<00:01:54.940> spacer<00:01:55.390> that's<00:01:55.959> in<00:01:56.140> there<00:01:56.259> now<00:01:56.289> is

00:01:56.669 --> 00:01:56.679 
so the spacer that's in there now is

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:58.499 
so the spacer that's in there now is
just<00:01:56.920> a<00:01:57.009> mock<00:01:57.250> up<00:01:57.459> kind<00:01:57.729> of<00:01:57.819> a<00:01:57.880> spacer<00:01:58.330> it's

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:58.509 
just a mock up kind of a spacer it's

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:01.589 
just a mock up kind of a spacer it's
just<00:01:58.929> a<00:01:59.259> stack<00:01:59.860> of<00:01:59.890> washers<00:02:00.550> and<00:02:00.789> so<00:02:01.239> for<00:02:01.509> you

00:02:01.589 --> 00:02:01.599 
just a stack of washers and so for you

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:03.180 
just a stack of washers and so for you
guys<00:02:01.750> that<00:02:02.020> are<00:02:02.050> thinking<00:02:02.830> of<00:02:02.920> doing<00:02:03.039> a

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.190 
guys that are thinking of doing a

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.490 
guys that are thinking of doing a
project<00:02:03.399> like<00:02:03.670> this<00:02:03.789> don't<00:02:04.209> you<00:02:04.360> dare<00:02:04.690> use<00:02:05.470> a

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
project like this don't you dare use a

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.540 
project like this don't you dare use a
stack<00:02:05.890> of<00:02:05.920> washers<00:02:06.580> as<00:02:06.910> your<00:02:07.599> spacer<00:02:08.429> for<00:02:09.429> your

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
stack of washers as your spacer for your

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.059 
stack of washers as your spacer for your
final<00:02:09.970> version<00:02:10.420> for<00:02:10.690> me<00:02:10.840> that<00:02:11.260> this<00:02:11.530> is<00:02:11.770> fine

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
final version for me that this is fine

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:14.280 
final version for me that this is fine
because<00:02:13.060> the<00:02:13.480> engine<00:02:13.750> isn't<00:02:13.900> going<00:02:14.110> to<00:02:14.170> be

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
because the engine isn't going to be

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:15.720 
because the engine isn't going to be
running<00:02:14.560> or<00:02:14.770> anything<00:02:14.860> like<00:02:15.099> that<00:02:15.160> I'm<00:02:15.489> just

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
running or anything like that I'm just

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.520 
running or anything like that I'm just
going<00:02:15.849> to<00:02:15.940> actuate<00:02:16.510> the<00:02:16.870> clutch<00:02:17.110> throw<00:02:17.439> up

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
going to actuate the clutch throw up

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.800 
going to actuate the clutch throw up
bearing<00:02:17.860> with<00:02:18.010> the<00:02:18.040> mr2<00:02:18.909> master<00:02:19.329> cylinder
