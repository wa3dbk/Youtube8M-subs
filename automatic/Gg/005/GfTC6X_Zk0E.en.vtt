00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.830
 the use as a monkey saw 

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:07.190
 to factor algebraic expressions 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.530
 there are rules 

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:11.190
 the first one refers to my monkey that is 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:15.719
 a common factor 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:18.600
 in this case it is not only mine is 13 x 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:22.770
 square less 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:25.650
 x linear and the linear the first thing that 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:28.710
 we have to do is defragment every 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:32.930
 this and this one we separate it from the sign 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.930
 less and it's down 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:42.110
 we go down and go down then we start it 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:47.280
 to stop fragmenting 3x 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:50.329
 3 x square is equal to 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.329
 3 x 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:58.200
 x for them 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:01:00.770
 and 6 x 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.770
 is 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:09.180
 3 for 2 for X because then of 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.509
 this what we have to do is look 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.110
 the literal factor factor and factor 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:16.799
 numeric 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:19.670
 you have to identify then in this 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.670
 case here is 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:28.540
 3 and 3 thousand 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:31.900
 xxy un x 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:35.200
 and nothing else the leftovers are then 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:39.230
 open we open parentheses 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:42.740
 we copy the first term that matches 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:48.120
 that he had three and X we met outside 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:50.790
 3x panel and time seems 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.740
 that you have inside the parentheses goes into 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.890
 these two terms 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.990
 these three terms then the 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.229
 leftovers are those that between then 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.229
 would be 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:07.590
 x minus 2 and respecting the order of these 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.770
 and the one that is first of would like 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.780
 there is first and understand this is the 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.360
 realization now as we check and 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:20.410
 this is fine doing the exercise 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:26.260
 3x xx 3 x 2 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:30.620
 3x minus for minus two and it's the same minus 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:33.290
 6 x y is what this result gives us is 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.120
 the same as we had at the beginning 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.600
 is the way to perform a factor like 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.600
 a monkey
