skis over here also known as for input

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:05.359 
skis over here also known as for input
and<00:01:01.579> we're<00:01:02.579> just<00:01:02.760> as<00:01:02.879> Sen<00:01:03.479> s<00:01:03.839> also<00:01:04.710> known<00:01:05.159> as

and we're just as Sen s also known as
short<00:01:06.030> for<00:01:06.270> sensitivity<00:01:08.899> and<00:01:09.899> yes<00:01:10.350> you<00:01:10.530> can

00:01:10.639 --> 00:01:10.649

see<00:01:10.860> I<00:01:10.890> have<00:01:11.159> a<00:01:11.570> mini<00:01:12.570> coal<00:01:12.930> master<00:01:13.320> fan<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.670> it

00:01:14.779 --> 00:01:14.789 
see I have a mini coal master fan and it

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:19.010 
see I have a mini coal master fan and it
has<00:01:15.440> like<00:01:16.729> this<00:01:17.729> cooling<00:01:18.149> part<00:01:18.360> already<00:01:18.660> but

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
has like this cooling part already but

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.020 
has like this cooling part already but
it's<00:01:19.770> for<00:01:19.920> summer<00:01:20.130> days<00:01:20.369> so<00:01:20.670> watch<00:01:20.820> my<00:01:21.000> other

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
it's for summer days so watch my other

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.919 
it's for summer days so watch my other
video<00:01:21.330> I<00:01:21.570> talked<00:01:21.869> about<00:01:21.929> it<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.350> then<00:01:23.250> you<00:01:23.399> got

00:01:23.919 --> 00:01:23.929 
video I talked about it and then you got

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:28.160 
video I talked about it and then you got
your<00:01:24.929> speaker<00:01:25.410> input<00:01:25.580> but<00:01:26.580> yet<00:01:26.820> you<00:01:27.000> have<00:01:27.170> up

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
your speaker input but yet you have up

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.430 
your speaker input but yet you have up
bridged<00:01:29.300> speaker<00:01:30.300> input<00:01:30.450> already<00:01:30.960> which<00:01:31.259> I'm

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 
bridged speaker input already which I'm

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.770 
bridged speaker input already which I'm
not<00:01:31.590> using<00:01:32.300> because<00:01:34.789> they're<00:01:35.789> taped<00:01:36.270> in<00:01:36.600> the

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
not using because they're taped in the

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.359 
not using because they're taped in the
bundle<00:01:37.220> rate<00:01:38.569> and<00:01:39.600> I<00:01:40.500> already<00:01:40.770> tested<00:01:41.159> so

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
bundle rate and I already tested so

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.830 
bundle rate and I already tested so
using<00:01:41.940> a<00:01:42.060> speaker<00:01:42.360> input<00:01:42.509> works<00:01:43.319> very<00:01:43.619> well

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
using a speaker input works very well

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:50.210 
using a speaker input works very well
and<00:01:45.840> when<00:01:46.020> you<00:01:46.110> come<00:01:46.289> the<00:01:46.380> process<00:01:49.220> mindset

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
and when you come the process mindset

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.219 
and when you come the process mindset
kind<00:01:50.429> of<00:01:50.580> in<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.819> middle<00:01:51.030> that's<00:01:52.020> for<00:01:52.380> like

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
kind of in the middle that's for like
