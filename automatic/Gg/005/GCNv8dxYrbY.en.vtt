trouble with it I'm going to be using an

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:24.220 
trouble with it I'm going to be using an
angler<00:00:20.120> in<00:00:20.210> water<00:00:20.480> fruit<00:00:20.750> and<00:00:22.300> it's<00:00:23.300> the<00:00:23.690> size

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:40.720 
learned what would usually do is just

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.320 
learned what would usually do is just
put<00:05:40.960> that<00:05:41.080> to<00:05:41.290> the<00:05:41.320> side<00:05:41.440> note<00:05:41.980> and<00:05:42.220> let<00:05:42.880> it<00:05:43.060> dry
