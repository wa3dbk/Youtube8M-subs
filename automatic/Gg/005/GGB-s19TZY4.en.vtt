00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
I ran on a treadmill at an incline got

I ran on a treadmill at an incline got
all<00:01:36.360> my<00:01:36.479> ventilatory<00:01:36.840> thresholds<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:37.740> heart

all my ventilatory thresholds and heart
rates<00:01:38.159> tested<00:01:38.790> and<00:01:39.780> then<00:01:39.930> I<00:01:39.960> went<00:01:40.110> on<00:01:40.259> the

rates tested and then I went on the

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.130 
rates tested and then I went on the
product<00:01:40.680> for<00:01:40.799> six<00:01:41.040> weeks<00:01:41.689> returned<00:01:42.689> to<00:01:43.020> the

same clinical tests had it all done i
was<00:01:45.600> able<00:01:45.750> to<00:01:45.869> run<00:01:46.770> faster<00:01:47.280> at<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.759> steeper

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
was able to run faster at a steeper

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.569 
was able to run faster at a steeper
incline<00:01:48.240> at<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:48.899> lower<00:01:49.140> heart<00:01:49.439> rate<00:01:49.500> as<00:01:49.829> a<00:01:50.220> coach

and<00:01:50.850> a<00:01:50.909> bike<00:01:51.060> racer<00:01:51.479> i<00:01:51.509> take<00:01:51.780> my<00:01:51.899> training<00:01:52.110> very

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
and a bike racer i take my training very

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.289 
and a bike racer i take my training very
seriously<00:01:52.500> it's<00:01:53.070> all<00:01:53.189> very<00:01:53.399> calculated<00:01:54.090> down

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
seriously it's all very calculated down

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.090 
seriously it's all very calculated down
for<00:01:54.540> last<00:01:54.720> minute<00:01:54.899> i<00:01:55.229> use<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.619> power<00:01:55.950> meter

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
for last minute i use a power meter

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.950 
for last minute i use a power meter
which<00:01:56.399> gives<00:01:56.610> me<00:01:56.790> a<00:01:56.820> very<00:01:56.969> objective<00:01:57.600> readout

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
which gives me a very objective readout

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.840 
which gives me a very objective readout
of<00:01:57.990> how<00:01:58.560> much<00:01:58.890> work<00:01:59.100> i'm<00:01:59.280> doing<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.759> how

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
of how much work i'm doing and how

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.030 
of how much work i'm doing and how
strong<00:02:00.149> I<00:02:00.329> am<00:02:00.360> and<00:02:00.689> I've<00:02:01.380> noticed<00:02:01.710> when<00:02:01.829> I'm<00:02:01.920> on

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
strong I am and I've noticed when I'm on

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.819 
strong I am and I've noticed when I'm on
the<00:02:02.070> asiya<00:02:02.460> I<00:02:02.729> can<00:02:03.140> sustain<00:02:04.140> my<00:02:04.290> power<00:02:04.530> output

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
the asiya I can sustain my power output

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.500 
the asiya I can sustain my power output
for<00:02:05.009> much<00:02:05.130> longer<00:02:05.310> periods<00:02:05.490> of<00:02:05.820> time<00:02:05.880> I<00:02:06.060> can

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:06.510 
for much longer periods of time I can

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.359 
for much longer periods of time I can
you<00:02:06.570> more<00:02:07.470> intervals<00:02:07.860> in<00:02:08.010> a<00:02:08.070> row<00:02:08.220> without

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
you more intervals in a row without

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.090 
you more intervals in a row without
having<00:02:08.820> to<00:02:08.970> arrest<00:02:09.690> so<00:02:10.140> I<00:02:10.170> started<00:02:10.710> taking<00:02:10.890> the

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
having to arrest so I started taking the

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.890 
having to arrest so I started taking the
product<00:02:11.400> couple<00:02:12.060> weeks<00:02:12.270> and<00:02:12.480> i<00:02:12.510> said<00:02:12.720> i'm

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
product couple weeks and i said i'm

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.110 
product couple weeks and i said i'm
going<00:02:13.350> to<00:02:13.440> try<00:02:13.650> this<00:02:13.800> out<00:02:14.190> I'm<00:02:14.520> gonna<00:02:14.640> do<00:02:14.910> what

going to try this out I'm gonna do what
I<00:02:15.150> normally<00:02:15.300> do<00:02:15.930> when<00:02:16.080> I<00:02:16.140> exercise<00:02:16.590> and<00:02:17.130> push

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
I normally do when I exercise and push

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.630 
I normally do when I exercise and push
myself<00:02:17.870> because<00:02:18.870> I<00:02:19.110> know<00:02:19.500> how<00:02:19.770> I<00:02:19.800> feel<00:02:20.190> my<00:02:20.460> body

myself because I know how I feel my body

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.970 
myself because I know how I feel my body
feels<00:02:21.000> when<00:02:21.300> I<00:02:21.330> do<00:02:21.420> that<00:02:21.660> so<00:02:22.500> I'd<00:02:22.620> ran<00:02:22.800> the

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
feels when I do that so I'd ran the

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.610 
feels when I do that so I'd ran the
stairs<00:02:23.220> up<00:02:23.430> in<00:02:23.580> the<00:02:23.670> canyon<00:02:24.060> and<00:02:24.180> I<00:02:24.960> know<00:02:25.200> I<00:02:25.320> can

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
stairs up in the canyon and I know I can

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.290 
stairs up in the canyon and I know I can
do<00:02:25.740> a<00:02:25.770> certain<00:02:26.070> number<00:02:26.220> of<00:02:26.460> times<00:02:26.820> and<00:02:27.180> I<00:02:27.240> know

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
do a certain number of times and I know

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.240 
do a certain number of times and I know
the<00:02:27.540> way<00:02:27.660> I<00:02:27.690> feel<00:02:27.990> afterwards<00:02:28.530> how<00:02:28.680> I<00:02:28.710> did<00:02:29.100> it

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
the way I feel afterwards how I did it

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.510 
the way I feel afterwards how I did it
and<00:02:29.370> then<00:02:30.120> I<00:02:30.180> ran<00:02:30.750> a<00:02:30.990> few<00:02:31.260> more<00:02:31.470> because<00:02:32.160> I<00:02:32.190> felt

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
and then I ran a few more because I felt

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.580 
and then I ran a few more because I felt
pretty<00:02:32.730> good<00:02:32.970> okay<00:02:33.720> if<00:02:33.870> I<00:02:33.990> feel<00:02:34.170> that<00:02:34.320> good<00:02:34.440> i'm

pretty good okay if I feel that good i'm
gonna<00:02:34.740> push<00:02:34.950> myself<00:02:35.160> even<00:02:35.580> harder<00:02:36.000> just<00:02:36.180> to

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
gonna push myself even harder just to

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.860 
gonna push myself even harder just to
see<00:02:36.510> how<00:02:36.690> how<00:02:37.050> things<00:02:37.350> go<00:02:37.820> so<00:02:38.820> i<00:02:38.850> ran<00:02:39.510> a<00:02:39.570> few

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
see how how things go so i ran a few

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.870 
see how how things go so i ran a few
more<00:02:40.050> sets<00:02:40.380> and<00:02:40.650> i<00:02:40.710> come<00:02:40.980> down<00:02:41.010> and<00:02:41.520> normally

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
more sets and i come down and normally

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.550 
more sets and i come down and normally
my<00:02:42.030> legs<00:02:42.300> are<00:02:42.480> shaking<00:02:42.510> they<00:02:43.140> weren't<00:02:43.290> shaking

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
my legs are shaking they weren't shaking

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.470 
my legs are shaking they weren't shaking
I<00:02:43.920> thought<00:02:44.640> well<00:02:44.820> I'll<00:02:45.000> know<00:02:45.210> for<00:02:45.240> sure

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
I thought well I'll know for sure

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.320 
I thought well I'll know for sure
tomorrow<00:02:45.960> because<00:02:46.530> tomorrow<00:02:47.220> is<00:02:47.670> the<00:02:48.180> day

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
tomorrow because tomorrow is the day

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.060 
tomorrow because tomorrow is the day
when<00:02:48.480> I<00:02:48.510> really<00:02:48.990> feel<00:02:49.200> it<00:02:49.380> in<00:02:49.470> my<00:02:49.590> legs<00:02:49.620> and<00:02:49.950> I'm

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
when I really feel it in my legs and I'm

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.400 
when I really feel it in my legs and I'm
limping<00:02:50.430> around<00:02:50.700> when<00:02:51.390> I<00:02:51.420> push<00:02:51.780> myself<00:02:51.990> that

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
limping around when I push myself that

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.590 
limping around when I push myself that
hard<00:02:52.710> and<00:02:53.610> the<00:02:53.760> next<00:02:53.940> day<00:02:54.030> I<00:02:54.120> barely<00:02:54.480> felt

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
hard and the next day I barely felt

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.990 
hard and the next day I barely felt
anything<00:02:55.110> I<00:02:55.530> felt<00:02:55.980> something<00:02:56.250> I<00:02:56.580> knew<00:02:56.730> I<00:02:56.760> did

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
anything I felt something I knew I did

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.580 
anything I felt something I knew I did
something<00:02:57.300> but<00:02:57.630> it<00:02:57.720> wasn't<00:02:58.290> the<00:02:58.410> way<00:02:58.560> I

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
something but it wasn't the way I

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.070 
something but it wasn't the way I
normally<00:02:59.220> feel<00:02:59.790> when<00:03:00.120> i<00:03:00.150> run<00:03:00.450> the<00:03:00.600> stair<00:03:00.840> so<00:03:01.050> i

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
normally feel when i run the stair so i

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.490 
normally feel when i run the stair so i
thought<00:03:01.290> oh<00:03:01.530> this<00:03:02.400> is<00:03:03.000> for<00:03:03.240> real<00:03:03.390> after<00:03:04.110> about

thought oh this is for real after about
two<00:03:04.740> weeks<00:03:04.770> on<00:03:05.070> ASEA<00:03:05.459> I<00:03:05.580> noticed<00:03:06.060> that<00:03:06.180> my

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
two weeks on ASEA I noticed that my

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:07.940 
two weeks on ASEA I noticed that my
workouts<00:03:06.840> were<00:03:07.050> a<00:03:07.110> lot<00:03:07.290> stronger<00:03:07.620> especially

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
workouts were a lot stronger especially

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.580 
workouts were a lot stronger especially
the<00:03:08.280> second<00:03:08.610> half<00:03:08.730> of<00:03:08.850> my<00:03:08.970> workouts<00:03:09.420> I<00:03:09.930> was<00:03:10.440> I

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
the second half of my workouts I was I

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.560 
the second half of my workouts I was I
was<00:03:10.709> much<00:03:10.920> more<00:03:11.130> energetic<00:03:11.910> I<00:03:12.180> had<00:03:12.360> more

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
was much more energetic I had more

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.180 
was much more energetic I had more
endurance<00:03:12.989> and<00:03:13.260> that<00:03:13.620> made<00:03:13.739> a<00:03:13.770> huge

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
endurance and that made a huge

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.530 
endurance and that made a huge
difference<00:03:14.430> in<00:03:14.730> my<00:03:14.850> times<00:03:15.150> and<00:03:15.420> in<00:03:15.480> my

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
difference in my times and in my

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.720 
difference in my times and in my
performance<00:03:16.110> and<00:03:16.260> immediately<00:03:17.220> I<00:03:17.310> can<00:03:17.520> tell

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
performance and immediately I can tell

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.930 
performance and immediately I can tell
that<00:03:17.760> i<00:03:18.180> had<00:03:18.540> a<00:03:18.570> huge<00:03:18.989> energy<00:03:19.170> boost<00:03:19.470> i<00:03:19.940> went

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
that i had a huge energy boost i went

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.250 
that i had a huge energy boost i went
through<00:03:21.060> my<00:03:21.150> work<00:03:21.360> out<00:03:21.570> within<00:03:21.720> an<00:03:21.930> hour<00:03:22.019> and<00:03:22.230> a

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
through my work out within an hour and a

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.110 
through my work out within an hour and a
half<00:03:22.440> and<00:03:22.709> when<00:03:22.830> I<00:03:22.860> got<00:03:23.070> done<00:03:23.280> I<00:03:23.550> was<00:03:23.760> ready<00:03:23.970> for

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
half and when I got done I was ready for

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.290 
half and when I got done I was ready for
more<00:03:24.330> I<00:03:24.590> got<00:03:25.590> my<00:03:25.709> time<00:03:26.010> down<00:03:26.310> to<00:03:26.670> an<00:03:26.910> absolute

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
more I got my time down to an absolute

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.990 
more I got my time down to an absolute
best<00:03:27.989> so<00:03:28.680> my<00:03:28.800> heart<00:03:29.100> rate<00:03:29.310> stay<00:03:29.640> where<00:03:29.910> it

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
best so my heart rate stay where it

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.729 
best so my heart rate stay where it
would<00:03:30.239> have<00:03:30.330> been<00:03:30.420> normally<00:03:30.870> my<00:03:30.989> power<00:03:31.230> output

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
would have been normally my power output

would have been normally my power output
was<00:03:31.920> up<00:03:32.130> and<00:03:32.310> my<00:03:32.370> time<00:03:32.610> was<00:03:32.760> down<00:03:32.970> 40<00:03:33.330> seconds

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930

was up and my time was down 40 seconds
on<00:03:34.110> a<00:03:34.170> climb<00:03:34.980> that<00:03:35.130> overtakes<00:03:35.340> me<00:03:35.489> for<00:03:35.640> 17

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
on a climb that overtakes me for 17

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.790 
on a climb that overtakes me for 17
minutes<00:03:36.209> took<00:03:36.540> me<00:03:36.720> 16<00:03:37.110> minutes<00:03:37.380> and<00:03:37.530> 20

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
minutes took me 16 minutes and 20

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.440 
minutes took me 16 minutes and 20
seconds<00:03:38.190> the<00:03:38.820> only<00:03:39.120> thing<00:03:39.300> I've<00:03:39.420> done

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
seconds the only thing I've done

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.240 
seconds the only thing I've done
difference<00:03:39.989> is<00:03:40.110> add<00:03:40.290> to<00:03:40.440> see<00:03:40.650> it<00:03:40.739> into<00:03:40.980> the<00:03:41.100> mix

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
difference is add to see it into the mix

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.940 
difference is add to see it into the mix
it's<00:03:42.030> not<00:03:42.300> an<00:03:42.480> energy<00:03:42.870> drink<00:03:43.140> it's<00:03:43.769> an

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
it's not an energy drink it's an

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.530 
it's not an energy drink it's an
endurance<00:03:44.220> which<00:03:44.580> is<00:03:44.730> completely<00:03:45.209> different

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
endurance which is completely different

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.479 
endurance which is completely different
because<00:03:45.810> with<00:03:46.230> energy<00:03:46.680> there's<00:03:46.890> a<00:03:46.950> high<00:03:47.160> and

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
because with energy there's a high and

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:49.250 
because with energy there's a high and
then<00:03:47.670> there's<00:03:47.820> a<00:03:47.880> loan<00:03:48.150> with<00:03:48.959> an<00:03:49.110> insurance

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
then there's a loan with an insurance

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.550 
then there's a loan with an insurance
product<00:03:49.830> there's<00:03:50.220> not<00:03:50.489> ever<00:03:50.910> low<00:03:51.300> it's<00:03:52.200> just
