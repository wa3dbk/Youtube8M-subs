made by 3m you're gonna find some

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:39.479 
made by 3m you're gonna find some
callers<00:00:37.809> this<00:00:38.230> is<00:00:38.290> the<00:00:38.590> first<00:00:38.890> one<00:00:39.070> is<00:00:39.340> the

will use for the polishing of the
surface<00:00:52.329> and<00:00:53.070> probably<00:00:54.070> the<00:00:54.220> major<00:00:54.460> advantage

00:00:55.259 --> 00:00:55.269 
surface and probably the major advantage

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:57.600 
surface and probably the major advantage
of<00:00:55.420> this<00:00:55.690> kind<00:00:56.079> of<00:00:56.140> wheel<00:00:56.470> actually<00:00:57.100> is<00:00:57.519> a

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:57.610 
of this kind of wheel actually is a

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.509 
of this kind of wheel actually is a
rubber<00:00:57.909> wheel<00:00:58.239> is<00:00:58.690> that<00:00:59.320> it's<00:00:59.649> easy<00:00:59.979> to<00:01:00.100> use

00:01:00.509 --> 00:01:00.519 
rubber wheel is that it's easy to use

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:04.880 
rubber wheel is that it's easy to use
you<00:01:00.879> don't<00:01:01.090> have<00:01:01.359> to<00:01:01.510> use<00:01:01.629> any<00:01:01.930> paste<00:01:02.289> and<00:01:02.910> also

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
you don't have to use any paste and also

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.880 
you don't have to use any paste and also
because<00:01:05.890> of<00:01:05.920> its<00:01:06.759> flexibility<00:01:07.600> I<00:01:07.869> can<00:01:08.170> use<00:01:08.470> in

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
because of its flexibility I can use in

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.680 
because of its flexibility I can use in
many<00:01:10.050> occlusal<00:01:11.050> surfaces<00:01:11.679> and<00:01:12.070> I<00:01:12.670> can<00:01:13.060> adapt

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:13.690 
many occlusal surfaces and I can adapt

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.969 
many occlusal surfaces and I can adapt
in<00:01:14.080> many<00:01:14.759> details<00:01:15.759> of<00:01:16.179> this<00:01:16.770> sculpture<00:01:17.770> for

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 
in many details of this sculpture for

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:19.919 
in many details of this sculpture for
instance<00:01:18.369> the<00:01:18.580> principle<00:01:19.300> circles<00:01:19.780> or

00:01:19.919 --> 00:01:19.929 
instance the principle circles or

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:23.060 
instance the principle circles or
secondary<00:01:20.500> circles<00:01:20.979> and<00:01:21.160> also<00:01:22.030> when<00:01:22.240> I<00:01:22.270> use

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
secondary circles and also when I use

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.730 
secondary circles and also when I use
this<00:01:24.070> on<00:01:24.460> interior<00:01:24.970> restorations<00:01:25.899> I<00:01:26.050> can<00:01:26.500> also

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
this on interior restorations I can also

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.399 
this on interior restorations I can also
adapt<00:01:27.340> very<00:01:27.490> much<00:01:28.240> in<00:01:28.600> the<00:01:28.780> interproximal

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
adapt very much in the interproximal

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:33.870 
adapt very much in the interproximal
areas<00:01:30.369> so<00:01:30.759> this<00:01:31.179> is<00:01:31.539> the<00:01:31.780> idea<00:01:32.350> of<00:01:32.679> this<00:01:33.520> kind

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
areas so this is the idea of this kind

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.880 
areas so this is the idea of this kind
of<00:01:34.119> wheel<00:01:34.590> so<00:01:35.590> I<00:01:36.009> will<00:01:36.970> only<00:01:37.300> show<00:01:37.479> you<00:01:37.899> how<00:01:38.830> to
