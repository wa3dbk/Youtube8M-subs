00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:39.829 
starts and they're the ones who set the

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
they just kind of encourage the status

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.070 
they just kind of encourage the status
quo<00:00:52.910> their<00:00:53.910> attitude<00:00:54.330> was<00:00:54.360> this<00:00:54.720> is<00:00:54.870> what's

been run and really just kind of

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.470 
been run and really just kind of
discouraged<00:01:01.920> a<00:01:02.040> lot<00:01:02.280> of<00:01:02.400> new<00:01:02.550> ideas<00:01:02.700> I<00:01:03.300> did

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
discouraged a lot of new ideas I did

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.530 
discouraged a lot of new ideas I did
have<00:01:03.660> a<00:01:03.690> principle<00:01:04.170> that<00:01:04.320> never<00:01:05.060> was<00:01:06.060> very

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540

unclear about what they wanted about
expectations<00:01:09.960> very<00:01:10.200> unclear<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:11.270> it<00:01:12.270> was<00:01:12.540> a

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
expectations very unclear and it was a

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.350 
expectations very unclear and it was a
very<00:01:13.020> reactionary<00:01:13.740> situation<00:01:14.400> where<00:01:14.640> if

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
something wasn't being done right you

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.530 
something wasn't being done right you
weren't<00:01:16.830> told<00:01:17.070> until<00:01:17.520> you<00:01:17.910> were<00:01:18.030> already<00:01:18.360> in

trouble working in other schools you're

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.230 
trouble working in other schools you're
just<00:01:21.830> another<00:01:22.830> teacher<00:01:23.160> they're<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.729> lot<00:01:24.119> of

just another teacher they're a lot of

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.790 
just another teacher they're a lot of
times<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.810> you're<00:01:24.990> just<00:01:25.229> doing<00:01:25.530> your<00:01:25.560> own

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:25.800 
times and you're just doing your own

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.500 
times and you're just doing your own
thing<00:01:25.830> in<00:01:26.100> your<00:01:26.220> classroom

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:30.510 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.540 

it<00:01:30.960> was<00:01:31.080> very<00:01:31.290> very<00:01:31.560> clear<00:01:31.950> from<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.310> start

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:32.550 
it was very very clear from the start

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.820 
it was very very clear from the start
that<00:01:32.760> the<00:01:33.570> whole<00:01:33.750> school<00:01:34.050> was<00:01:34.230> about<00:01:34.320> Student

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830 
that the whole school was about Student

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.040 
that the whole school was about Student
Success<00:01:34.980> it<00:01:35.520> makes<00:01:35.820> a<00:01:36.090> big<00:01:36.300> difference<00:01:36.720> when

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:37.050 
Success it makes a big difference when

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.310 
Success it makes a big difference when
the<00:01:37.260> focus<00:01:37.500> is<00:01:37.830> on<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.370> student<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.320> the

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
the focus is on the student and the

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.490 
the focus is on the student and the
staff<00:01:40.740> rather<00:01:41.520> than<00:01:41.880> on<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.390> rules<00:01:42.690> in<00:01:43.230> this

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.100 
staff rather than on the rules in this
system<00:01:43.830> I<00:01:44.340> care<00:01:45.000> about<00:01:45.180> their<00:01:45.330> teachers<00:01:45.960> is

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
system I care about their teachers is

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.320 
system I care about their teachers is
more<00:01:46.320> than<00:01:46.440> just<00:01:46.760> workers<00:01:47.760> they<00:01:48.000> care<00:01:48.180> about

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330 
more than just workers they care about

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:49.580 
more than just workers they care about
them<00:01:48.450> as<00:01:48.570> people<00:01:48.930> as<00:01:49.050> well<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:49.410> then<00:01:49.500> the

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
them as people as well and then the

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.380 
them as people as well and then the
teachers<00:01:49.890> will<00:01:50.040> then<00:01:50.160> impart<00:01:50.490> that<00:01:50.550> care<00:01:51.090> of

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
teachers will then impart that care of

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.400 
teachers will then impart that care of

on to the students and think of their
