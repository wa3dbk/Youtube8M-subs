00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:16.710
 already more than 7 but I am certainly not an ex girlfriend and that started 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.079
 Forget this but I think the mileage charge I can often find 

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:24.900
 at the wrong party 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.949
 critics has posted positively 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:30.259
 that's not kidding 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:33.640
 So it's java time 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.740
 yet something does not understand 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:38.110
 unravel the system 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.720
 16 percent still not fit 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.720
 because I am liberated during the rubble 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.750
 the order 8 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.750
 I feel like we have 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.110
 This weekend is not profitable 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.810
 you can get the old town I asked for extra 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.590
 who made the mistake 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.590
 result-oriented and I get to see you because I can't complain 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.950
 7 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.210
 a positive closing position 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.210
 on the fort island really not the best song 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.590
 fact is that probably I knew I am going to think so too 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.240
 and then the NFL draws the club 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.160
 the owner has reported the insight questions 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.980
 7 percent 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.090
 it was 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.260
 That puts one of the top pieces in possession already working 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.160
 raising of securities in Iraq 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.660
 the flag goes to the creative projects with a night shop 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.590
 and that I lost out of the boxes and that was closing during the savings 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.440
 he says the day came 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.750
 around the holidays 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.530
 the locals blew the suitcases to determine the winner it stinks 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.690
 a package 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.529
 still get a chance 

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:12.889
 the text in the source language 12 we get a perk i thought i can't 

00:02:12.889 --> 00:02:13.669
 really 

00:02:13.669 --> 00:02:16.359
 prinsengracht 

00:02:16.359 --> 00:02:19.359
 and then father watch 

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:22.760
 The net effect was that it means a newspaper 

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:27.219
 and with that joking at the strengths and weaknesses 

00:02:30.499 --> 00:02:33.829
 it seems to me that i think 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:36.829
 after patrick franken placed internet 

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:42.189
 just as compared to a year earlier you see the acceptance obligation 

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:45.189
 found from my pocket 3 

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:47.829
 but pay 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:50.609
 what i know is giving it a chore 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:51.769
 and that has not yet been done
