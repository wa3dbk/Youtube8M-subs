00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.759
 god learned my light is asking for 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.290
 Evil is what is just it 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.480
 treatment to have less evil 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.309
 be using my nerves in my 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.940
 back but good to fall unfortunately still 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.630
 enough to find in the world where i am 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.130
 for example about 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.600
 there are two things that are just that 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:23.220
 I noticed and the first is something I do 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.470
 if you have a twitter account a bit 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.050
 has been following for quite some time and very much 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.570
 pissed about am that is official body 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.669
 positions and gaming and then it doesn't work 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.559
 your chin about game addiction a bit 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.300
 finish that bullshit 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.649
 it doesn't make sense for anything at all 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.420
 Games Violence With Now Passes 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.350
 recently a press release was that one 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:46.829
 organization called but I one at 10 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.410
 million euros a fund had before 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.120
 dutch the velkers for yes their 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.789
 continue to help to play cool games 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.500
 and that sounds good 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.750
 bold the disclosed during the casual 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.750
 connect in Amsterdam only once a week 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.960
 or two ago and today appeared 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.960
 a butt on a tweet and therefore 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.090
 an arc of our much appreciated 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:12.540
 friend in that flax cinerama 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:15.570
 up on his website on his vlog 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.810
 and he indicates it appears so there 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.930
 we already have ten million there 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.240
 online the idea of ​​what that is known for 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.729
 is and that is therefore not in the scene 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.540
 who in the Netherlands is an in the scene who 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.829
 form may not yet do what it does 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.180
 should be really really whole 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.920
 many gems in the Netherlands very much 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.450
 creativity a lot of grass that really 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.460
 very nice introduction to the right one 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.900
 a little subsidy or a small one 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.310
 bit of a helping hand in particular 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.740
 in the field of marketing 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.869
 just make games that in the world it 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.399
 would sell pretty well and I think 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.490
 for example, that glass again or vanguard 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.619
 or rony may show that games 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.790
 we could just make a profit that was 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.689
 a little bit the goal they gave 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.290
 to of year we want 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.909
 help the company to care about itself 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.110
 to be able to reliability to the profit 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.880
 so that they can invest 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.500
 are going to earn back 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.719
 but nothing with the Indian at least that 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.780
 is what what what what what gives rami and what 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:12.720
 and I taste that because I also taste it 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.310
 they say we are looking for new ones 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.840
 companies that 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.610
 create free-to-play mobile games 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.709
 because according to them that is the future and 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.209
 things where they have that than 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.700
 for heaven's sake again that free-to-play 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.989
 mobile games are the future because if 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.569
 you now see what is happening worldwide 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:29.400
 then 99 percent of the bikes are omafiets 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:31.050
 play mobile games 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.060
 scores even better for one meter 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.129
 free-to-play there is still a lot 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.900
 mutual discussion in the games 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:37.920
 that or free-to-play really is the 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.500
 future is 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.030
 do you have some call that it is whole 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.280
 is successful but the majority feel 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.319
 just total your goal is really bad 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.090
 good companies as in yes because it is also 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:49.620
 a thought comes to him behind the fund 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.209
 of pivot games is after as you pivot games 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:55.140
 um mars go to the website 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:57.180
 really like those candy pink games in particular 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:00.360
 for girls and kids and that kind 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.709
 things and then there will be potential in it 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.650
 but that is about one 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.030
 gigantic company whatever or worldwide 90 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.560
 grams of this one dark maybe 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.239
 rims game and you have it everywhere 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.310
 farmville which is now back 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:12.270
 what facebook brings walk back 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.130
 zinga is already 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:16.020
 as it were huge loss of distractors 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.780
 banal that is gas set and the murder 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:22.020
 from proven to employ that simply 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:25.170
 scoring to ignore it because it is 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:27.120
 free to play and thus witness the 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.850
 government or government or that succeeds 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.550
 body jailer that they just don't 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.770
 understand how gaming works how 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:37.920
 gamers what gamers want how gaming in 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:40.380
 each other is what is cool what is profitable 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.210
 it's just another idea from the 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.320
 government of opening must something with game 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:45.900
 is going to do it you should go to 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:48.540
 that website go from gameon and 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:51.180
 really have something about the weirdest 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.470
 quotes about that in Amsterdam 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.820
 sorrow see the world in the world 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.890
 number three or so different from them 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.750
 bullshit but guys is here and the and 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.280
 ge studio wants to go start in 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.080
 Amsterdam you pay the same as Amsterdam 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.660
 entirely to taxes and all that 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.100
 kind of stuff so no way that here studios 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.620
 would have been calmer otherwise it had already passed it 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.210
 seated but your case they totally understand 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.410
 was not base now and I really hope is time 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:12.390
 that they sometimes go looking 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.610
 to be least a bit real here 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:17.640
 indie games that sit instead of all 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:18.870
 those weird scientists and grab them 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.790
 they all say she 's in it 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.830
 have a good lease is the second thing 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:25.500
 I think many essentials for you 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:30.240
 and that is namely the message that I 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:32.760
 just read that motty also indicates that the 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:36.270
 chance of a single of the burdens firth 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:38.280
 fifty-fifty is and yes I think this is 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.720
 for brakes because for me the 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.880
 tricky is simply the best game of it 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.130
 last year and I'd love to 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.390
 just a successor wants another can 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.650
 I understand a little because 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:49.230
 last fish is of course just one 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.460
 game that is ready one time or online 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:51.270
 something types or go girl 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.730
 to do 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.560
 and those same guests don't feel it 

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:57.060
 quite nice on the other side 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.520
 it may actually be more difficult 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.050
 more for something for metaphor of one 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.510
 particular 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:05.850
 yes we are the last in the so you would 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:07.680
 can also see it as of, for example 

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:09.360
 that's the series 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.800
 the detective you are doing now is factual 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.050
 tell my story 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.490
 and then just after the series 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.169
 go tell a new story with 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:18.539
 other guests that would that should here 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:21.720
 also can do 

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:23.970
 the funny thing about it is that game 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.169
 who with all fear is that who 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:27.570
 visitors 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:29.039
 indicate the probability of a sibel 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:30.449
 actually quite small, the just want 

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:32.490
 for each 

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:34.590
 jan asshole game lately 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:36.360
 Singles come from there will come exactly 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.520
 and what great is coming again 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.990
 no sibel out and the other side is that 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.419
 actually already whitened or well I hope 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:44.310
 yet that note ii still good 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:46.530
 looking at who we are the burden 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:49.949
 so behaves as for coat rack for 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:52.020
 kind of story and the games that 

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:53.220
 than the same terms just type hands 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.840
 then in a different way because I think 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:57.180
 that the last one was the title is now 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:59.160
 is just really good in ep that stands and 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:00.449
 the account 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.880
 yes that is does with the sequels as one 

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:03.990
 name is known then yes well then it becomes 

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.639
 also purchased earlier 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:08.130
 then if you suddenly again a whole 

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:09.630
 must build a new game but me 

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:10.650
 think it's just a shame 

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:13.409
 but again that actually always the 

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:13.740
 good yeah you don't get that from you 

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:15.510
 want 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:17.159
 while the bad always give you what 

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:19.550
 you actually don't want to have 

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:19.550
 so customers
