set now let's discuss anchoring your

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.830 
set now let's discuss anchoring your
boat<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:50.489> first<00:00:50.760> step<00:00:51.000> in<00:00:51.180> anchoring<00:00:51.660> is

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
boat the first step in anchoring is

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.160 
boat the first step in anchoring is
estimating<00:00:52.440> your<00:00:52.500> final<00:00:52.860> location<00:00:54.020> you'll<00:00:55.020> be

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
estimating your final location you'll be

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.350 
estimating your final location you'll be
drifting<00:00:55.590> away<00:00:55.710> from<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.219> actual<00:00:56.579> location

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
drifting away from the actual location

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.389 
drifting away from the actual location
that<00:00:57.480> you<00:00:57.629> drop<00:00:57.899> your<00:00:58.140> anchor<00:00:58.320> so<00:00:59.070> there<00:00:59.280> are<00:00:59.370> a

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
that you drop your anchor so there are a

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.119 
that you drop your anchor so there are a
lot<00:00:59.489> of<00:00:59.879> things<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.359> consider<00:01:00.890> some<00:01:01.890> of<00:01:01.920> those

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
lot of things to consider some of those

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.690 
lot of things to consider some of those
are<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:03.090> depth<00:01:03.359> of<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.629> water<00:01:04.100> the<00:01:05.100> direction

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
are the depth of the water the direction

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.929 
are the depth of the water the direction
and<00:01:05.880> speed<00:01:06.030> of<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.420> current<00:01:07.100> tide<00:01:08.100> changes<00:01:08.729> is

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
and speed of the current tide changes is

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.410 
and speed of the current tide changes is
it<00:01:09.659> rising<00:01:09.869> or<00:01:10.229> falling<00:01:10.909> will<00:01:11.909> you<00:01:12.030> be<00:01:12.210> there

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
it rising or falling will you be there

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.810 
it rising or falling will you be there
through<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.720> whole<00:01:12.869> tidal<00:01:13.380> cycle<00:01:13.890> if<00:01:14.040> so<00:01:14.369> what

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
through the whole tidal cycle if so what

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.820 
through the whole tidal cycle if so what
is<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.060> difference<00:01:15.479> between<00:01:15.540> high<00:01:16.320> tide<00:01:16.350> and

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
is the difference between high tide and

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.020 
is the difference between high tide and
low<00:01:16.890> tide<00:01:17.900> wind<00:01:18.900> speed<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:19.500> direction<00:01:20.030> other

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
low tide wind speed and direction other
