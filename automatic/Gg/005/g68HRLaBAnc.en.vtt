seems really well I actually like the

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.610 
seems really well I actually like the
way<00:00:38.070> that<00:00:38.370> they<00:00:38.520> put<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:39.570> packaging<00:00:40.140> in<00:00:40.320> this

detailed sculpture on the Man of Steel

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:03.859 
detailed sculpture on the Man of Steel
obviously<00:02:01.619> not<00:02:01.799> a<00:02:02.040> lifelike<00:02:02.810> kind<00:02:03.810> of

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
obviously not a lifelike kind of

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.840 
obviously not a lifelike kind of
sculpture<00:02:04.259> of<00:02:04.500> Henry<00:02:04.950> Cavill<00:02:05.130> himself<00:02:05.610> but<00:02:05.820> I

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
sculpture of Henry Cavill himself but I

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.730 
sculpture of Henry Cavill himself but I
do<00:02:05.969> like<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.360> details<00:02:06.719> especially<00:02:07.229> since

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
do like the details especially since

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.619 
do like the details especially since
this<00:02:07.890> is<00:02:08.099> only<00:02:08.489> around<00:02:08.759> four<00:02:09.030> inches<00:02:09.300> it's<00:02:09.479> not

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
this is only around four inches it's not

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.790 
this is only around four inches it's not
even<00:02:09.840> as<00:02:09.929> big<00:02:09.959> as<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.379> DVD<00:02:11.420> box<00:02:12.420> itself

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
even as big as the DVD box itself

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.830 
even as big as the DVD box itself
but<00:02:14.190> everything<00:02:14.550> else<00:02:14.700> looks<00:02:14.820> super<00:02:15.390> spot-on

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
but everything else looks super spot-on

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.570 
but everything else looks super spot-on
accurate<00:02:16.260> as<00:02:16.560> far<00:02:16.590> as<00:02:16.800> the<00:02:16.890> movie<00:02:17.070> goes<00:02:17.100> comes

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
accurate as far as the movie goes comes

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.730 
accurate as far as the movie goes comes
with<00:02:17.760> a<00:02:17.910> display<00:02:18.090> stand<00:02:18.360> which<00:02:19.170> pretty<00:02:19.650> much

with a display stand which pretty much

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.290 
with a display stand which pretty much
has<00:02:20.040> already<00:02:20.280> kind<00:02:20.670> of<00:02:20.700> attached<00:02:21.000> to<00:02:21.150> it<00:02:21.270> you

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
has already kind of attached to it you

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.660 
has already kind of attached to it you
can't<00:02:21.600> really<00:02:21.810> take<00:02:22.020> it<00:02:22.050> off<00:02:22.460> details<00:02:23.460> in<00:02:23.610> the

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
can't really take it off details in the

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.190 
can't really take it off details in the
Cape<00:02:23.850> are<00:02:24.030> pretty<00:02:24.210> nice<00:02:24.390> I'm<00:02:24.750> really<00:02:25.020> actually

enjoying<00:02:25.710> it<00:02:25.890> even<00:02:25.950> though<00:02:26.100> it<00:02:26.220> is<00:02:26.310> a<00:02:26.340> little

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
enjoying it even though it is a little

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:27.890 
enjoying it even though it is a little
bit<00:02:26.730> smaller<00:02:27.060> than<00:02:27.270> say<00:02:27.480> some<00:02:27.690> of<00:02:27.720> the<00:02:27.870> other

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
bit smaller than say some of the other

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.290 
bit smaller than say some of the other
figures<00:02:28.650> that<00:02:29.040> I<00:02:29.070> have<00:02:29.340> and<00:02:29.580> this<00:02:29.880> is<00:02:30.000> actually

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
figures that I have and this is actually

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.600 
figures that I have and this is actually
my<00:02:30.420> first<00:02:30.660> well<00:02:31.290> not<00:02:31.320> my<00:02:31.590> first<00:02:31.890> Azad<00:02:32.280> figure

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
my first well not my first Azad figure

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:33.980 
my first well not my first Azad figure
but<00:02:32.760> this<00:02:32.880> is<00:02:33.000> this<00:02:33.090> first<00:02:33.390> sawed<00:02:33.570> figure<00:02:33.840> that

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
but this is this first sawed figure that

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.930 
but this is this first sawed figure that
I'm<00:02:34.080> gonna<00:02:34.170> be<00:02:34.380> reviewing<00:02:35.250> here<00:02:35.460> the<00:02:35.580> detail

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
I'm gonna be reviewing here the detail

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.300 
I'm gonna be reviewing here the detail
on<00:02:35.970> Zod<00:02:36.360> looks<00:02:36.690> I<00:02:36.900> think<00:02:37.140> even<00:02:37.320> better<00:02:37.680> than

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
on Zod looks I think even better than

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.430 
on Zod looks I think even better than
say<00:02:38.580> on<00:02:38.760> Superman<00:02:39.270> it<00:02:39.450> actually<00:02:39.810> does<00:02:40.050> kind<00:02:40.350> of

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
say on Superman it actually does kind of

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.830 
say on Superman it actually does kind of
look<00:02:40.710> like<00:02:40.740> Michael<00:02:41.550> Shannon's<00:02:42.150> version<00:02:42.630> of

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
look like Michael Shannon's version of

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.440 
look like Michael Shannon's version of
Zod<00:02:43.140> so<00:02:43.380> I'm<00:02:43.470> really<00:02:43.910> thrilled<00:02:44.910> to<00:02:45.060> have<00:02:45.270> this

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
Zod so I'm really thrilled to have this

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:46.610
