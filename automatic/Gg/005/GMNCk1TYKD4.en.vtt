00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:09.690 
sea vegetable is the only one that can

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:13.370 
sea vegetable is the only one that can
make<00:05:09.720> vitamin<00:05:10.350> D<00:05:10.590> and<00:05:10.890> vitamin<00:05:11.270> D<00:05:12.270> it<00:05:12.570> doesn't

exist in any land base vegetable right
the<00:05:18.720> only<00:05:18.990> other<00:05:19.610> plan<00:05:20.610> that<00:05:21.120> make<00:05:21.360> vitamin<00:05:22.230> D

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:22.410 
the only other plan that make vitamin D

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:27.130 
the only other plan that make vitamin D
is<00:05:22.650> mushroom<00:05:23.510> but<00:05:24.510> mushroom<00:05:24.960> is<00:05:25.110> now<00:05:25.500> really<00:05:25.950> a

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:27.140 
is mushroom but mushroom is now really a

mushroom exposed to UV can make vitamin

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:44.630 
mushroom exposed to UV can make vitamin
D<00:05:40.880> but<00:05:41.880> all<00:05:42.090> the<00:05:42.450> seaweed<00:05:42.930> is<00:05:43.140> making<00:05:43.740> vitamin
