exhaust gas recirculation valve our

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.039 
exhaust gas recirculation valve our
second<00:01:10.740> thing<00:01:10.920> here<00:01:11.159> is<00:01:11.340> our<00:01:11.580> i-i<00:01:12.090> AK<00:01:12.510> which<00:01:12.869> is

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
second thing here is our i-i AK which is

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.679 
second thing here is our i-i AK which is
also<00:01:13.380> known<00:01:13.560> as<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.830> idle<00:01:14.100> air<00:01:14.189> control<00:01:14.250> valve

also known as the idle air control valve
these<00:01:15.689> things<00:01:16.020> especially<00:01:16.350> on<00:01:16.799> Fords<00:01:17.250> and

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
these things especially on Fords and

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.670 
these things especially on Fords and
some<00:01:17.640> GM<00:01:17.909> models<00:01:18.390> they<00:01:18.600> get<00:01:18.810> gummed<00:01:19.320> up<00:01:19.470> with

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
some GM models they get gummed up with

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.249 
some GM models they get gummed up with
carbon<00:01:20.159> and<00:01:20.310> carbon<00:01:20.820> is<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.509> byproduct<00:01:21.869> of

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
carbon and carbon is the byproduct of

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.280 
carbon and carbon is the byproduct of
gasoline<00:01:22.799> being<00:01:23.070> burned

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
gasoline being burned

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:46.549 
have a mass airflow sensor and you

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:51.550 
have a mass airflow sensor and you
cannot<00:01:47.229> by<00:01:48.229> any<00:01:48.259> means<00:01:48.850> get<00:01:49.850> this<00:01:50.560> you

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
cannot by any means get this you

cannot by any means get this you
cannot<00:01:51.890> under<00:01:52.670> any<00:01:52.729> circumstances<00:01:53.600> get<00:01:53.810> this

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
cannot under any circumstances get this

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.190 
cannot under any circumstances get this
stuff<00:01:54.350> on<00:01:54.590> the<00:01:55.130> mass<00:01:55.280> airflow<00:01:55.549> sensor

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
stuff on the mass airflow sensor

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.660 
stuff on the mass airflow sensor
Massell<00:01:57.200> mass<00:01:57.680> airflow<00:01:57.979> sensor<00:01:58.220> is<00:01:58.610> very

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
Massell mass airflow sensor is very

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.700 
Massell mass airflow sensor is very
delicate<00:01:59.060> so<00:01:59.990> this<00:02:00.080> is<00:02:00.170> what<00:02:00.259> we're<00:02:00.380> gonna<00:02:00.440> do

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710

see<00:02:06.409> from<00:02:06.619> the<00:02:06.770> entire<00:02:07.009> engine<00:02:07.929> okay<00:02:08.929> this<00:02:09.500> is

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
see from the entire engine okay this is

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.440 
see from the entire engine okay this is
how<00:02:09.769> you're<00:02:09.979> going<00:02:10.130> to<00:02:10.220> see<00:02:10.369> from<00:02:10.580> a<00:02:10.850> 96

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
what that is all that is is carbon so

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.270 
what that is all that is is carbon so
you<00:03:38.260> got<00:03:38.380> to<00:03:38.470> read<00:03:38.590> the<00:03:38.680> engine<00:03:38.890> a<00:03:38.950> little<00:03:39.160> bit

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
you got to read the engine a little bit

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.310 
you got to read the engine a little bit
get<00:03:39.520> it<00:03:39.550> out<00:03:39.760> that's<00:03:40.480> all<00:03:40.630> the<00:03:40.720> carbon<00:03:41.110> that's

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320 
get it out that's all the carbon that's

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.220 
get it out that's all the carbon that's
been<00:03:41.650> in<00:03:41.800> your<00:03:41.920> intake<00:03:42.310> and<00:03:42.580> in<00:03:43.330> your<00:03:43.930> engine

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
been in your intake and in your engine

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.610 
been in your intake and in your engine
you<00:03:44.350> want<00:03:44.530> to<00:03:44.590> get<00:03:44.710> that<00:03:44.830> out<00:03:44.890> of<00:03:45.160> there<00:03:45.310> so<00:03:45.790> you

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
you want to get that out of there so you

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.690 
you want to get that out of there so you
let<00:03:47.620> it<00:03:47.710> run<00:03:47.860> for<00:03:48.010> a<00:03:48.100> little<00:03:48.310> bit

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
let it run for a little bit

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.610 
let it run for a little bit
bring<00:03:49.120> the<00:03:49.240> RPMs<00:03:49.690> up<00:03:49.930> a<00:03:50.050> little<00:03:50.260> bit<00:03:50.410> and

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
bring the RPMs up a little bit and

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.450 
bring the RPMs up a little bit and
that's<00:03:51.490> how<00:03:51.640> you<00:03:51.700> seafoam<00:03:52.300> in<00:03:52.870> 1996<00:03:53.800> Ford

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:54.460 
that's how you seafoam in 1996 Ford

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:57.210 
that's how you seafoam in 1996 Ford
Mustang<00:03:54.850> with<00:03:55.000> a<00:03:55.030> 4.6<00:03:55.720> liter<00:03:55.990> engine<00:03:56.320> and<00:03:56.530> if
