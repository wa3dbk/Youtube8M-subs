00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:55.870 

interesting<00:02:55.070> to<00:02:55.130> have<00:02:55.220> a<00:02:55.310> look<00:02:55.460> at<00:02:55.550> this<00:02:55.670> day

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
interesting to have a look at this day

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:01.099 
interesting to have a look at this day
be<00:02:56.030> particularly<00:02:56.510> aside<00:02:56.840> because

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:01.109 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:05.819 

mostly<00:03:02.109> far<00:03:02.290> away<00:03:03.239> with<00:03:04.379> that<00:03:05.379> wasn't<00:03:05.650> the<00:03:05.709> way

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:05.829 
mostly far away with that wasn't the way

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:07.980 
mostly far away with that wasn't the way
it<00:03:05.859> was<00:03:06.010> just<00:03:06.219> just<00:03:06.459> a<00:03:06.549> balance<00:03:06.909> issue

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:07.990 
it was just just a balance issue

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:14.430 
it was just just a balance issue
I<00:03:10.350> think<00:03:11.350> you<00:03:11.410> can<00:03:11.530> do<00:03:11.680> it<00:03:13.050> played<00:03:14.050> one<00:03:14.260> of<00:03:14.290> his

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
I think you can do it played one of his

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.980 
I think you can do it played one of his
cards<00:03:14.910> so<00:03:15.910> now<00:03:16.120> is<00:03:16.180> to<00:03:16.300> make<00:03:16.420> the<00:03:16.540> decision<00:03:16.660> is

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:16.990 
cards so now is to make the decision is

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.820 
cards so now is to make the decision is
you're<00:03:17.080> going<00:03:17.170> to<00:03:17.230> come<00:03:17.380> out<00:03:17.410> and<00:03:17.560> do<00:03:17.680> it<00:03:17.770> again

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830 
you're going to come out and do it again

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.040 
you're going to come out and do it again
or<00:03:18.100> is<00:03:18.190> it<00:03:18.280> going<00:03:18.370> to<00:03:18.460> move<00:03:18.640> up<00:03:18.820> if<00:03:19.600> I<00:03:19.780> receive

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.050 
or is it going to move up if I receive

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.740 
or is it going to move up if I receive
our<00:03:20.200> to<00:03:20.410> negate<00:03:21.000> the<00:03:22.000> touchdown<00:03:22.030> Worcester

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
our to negate the touchdown Worcester

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.140 
our to negate the touchdown Worcester
165<00:03:23.440> so<00:03:23.740> actually<00:03:24.610> they're<00:03:24.730> helping<00:03:25.000> each

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
165 so actually they're helping each

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:31.150 
165 so actually they're helping each
other<00:03:25.300> just<00:03:26.260> gives<00:03:26.500> him<00:03:26.620> a<00:03:26.710> few<00:03:26.890> moments

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:20.969 
so love CEA's got a decision does he go

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:26.689 
so love CEA's got a decision does he go
165<00:04:22.110> stay<00:04:23.110> in<00:04:23.259> touch<00:04:23.469> or<00:04:23.909> if<00:04:24.909> you<00:04:25.240> go<00:04:25.360> up<00:04:25.509> to<00:04:25.539> 166

00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:26.699 
165 stay in touch or if you go up to 166

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:30.300 
165 stay in touch or if you go up to 166
is<00:04:27.699> it<00:04:27.849> an<00:04:27.939> interesting<00:04:28.360> question<00:04:28.689> because<00:04:29.310> 65

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
is it an interesting question because 65

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.969 
is it an interesting question because 65
may<00:04:30.969> be<00:04:31.029> useful<00:04:31.240> in<00:04:31.539> the<00:04:31.599> overall<00:04:31.990> then<00:04:32.860> the

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:32.979 
may be useful in the overall then the

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:34.080 
may be useful in the overall then the
Armenians<00:04:33.370> have<00:04:33.460> already<00:04:33.669> got<00:04:33.819> the<00:04:33.909> gold

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
Armenians have already got the gold

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.650 
Armenians have already got the gold
medal

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.480 

so<00:04:37.170> I<00:04:37.200> think<00:04:37.410> it<00:04:37.500> just<00:04:37.620> just<00:04:37.920> depends<00:04:38.370> on<00:04:38.430> the

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
so I think it just just depends on the

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.590 
so I think it just just depends on the
decision<00:04:39.210> to<00:04:39.300> coaches<00:04:39.660> with<00:04:40.250> 166<00:04:41.270> he<00:04:42.270> wants

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 
decision to coaches with 166 he wants

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:46.220 
decision to coaches with 166 he wants
the<00:04:42.690> gold<00:04:42.930> medal

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:46.230 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:50.650 

so<00:04:46.830> better<00:04:47.100> pride<00:04:47.400> at<00:04:47.640> stake<00:04:47.670> here

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:50.660

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050
