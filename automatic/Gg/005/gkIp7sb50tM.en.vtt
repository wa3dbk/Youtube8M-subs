perform a little pose at the top of the
movement<00:00:55.410> when<00:00:56.410> we<00:00:56.559> reach<00:00:56.770> the<00:00:56.950> muscle

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.250 
movement when we reach the muscle

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.549 
movement when we reach the muscle
failure<00:00:57.460> we<00:00:58.149> will<00:00:58.300> switch<00:00:58.480> right<00:00:58.780> away<00:00:59.020> to<00:00:59.440> the

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
failure we will switch right away to the

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:03.869 
failure we will switch right away to the
dumbbell<00:00:59.980> press<00:01:00.309> exercise<00:01:01.260> at<00:01:02.260> this<00:01:03.219> stage<00:01:03.489> we

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:03.879 
dumbbell press exercise at this stage we

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:05.790 
dumbbell press exercise at this stage we
are<00:01:03.910> targeting<00:01:04.509> the<00:01:04.629> core<00:01:04.839> of<00:01:05.229> the<00:01:05.379> shoulder

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:05.800 
are targeting the core of the shoulder

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.880 
are targeting the core of the shoulder
muscle<00:01:06.600> counting<00:01:07.600> the<00:01:07.720> reps<00:01:07.899> is<00:01:08.200> irrelevant

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
muscle counting the reps is irrelevant

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.670 
muscle counting the reps is irrelevant
at<00:01:09.310> this<00:01:09.640> stage<00:01:09.880> as<00:01:10.119> well<00:01:10.270> so<00:01:11.259> we'll<00:01:11.470> take<00:01:11.619> it

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
at this stage as well so we'll take it

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.980 
at this stage as well so we'll take it
to<00:01:11.830> the<00:01:11.920> muscle<00:01:12.310> failure<00:01:12.520> which<00:01:13.479> should<00:01:13.690> occur

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
to the muscle failure which should occur

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:19.260 
to the muscle failure which should occur
between<00:01:14.590> 12<00:01:15.160> and<00:01:15.399> 15<00:01:15.970> reps<00:01:16.509> usually<00:01:18.210> now<00:01:19.210> you

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
between 12 and 15 reps usually now you

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.510 
between 12 and 15 reps usually now you
should<00:01:19.600> already<00:01:19.899> feel<00:01:20.050> that<00:01:20.560> gratifying
