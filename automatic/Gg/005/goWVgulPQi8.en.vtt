then yeah while we've been able to put a
lot<00:00:59.309> of<00:00:59.340> additional<00:00:59.640> car<00:01:00.480> parking<00:01:00.930> bays<00:01:01.199> in<00:01:01.230> in

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
lot of additional car parking bays in in

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.100 
lot of additional car parking bays in in
recent<00:01:02.070> years<00:01:02.129> we<00:01:02.609> will<00:01:02.820> put<00:01:03.030> in<00:01:03.180> more<00:01:03.840> in<00:01:04.019> the

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
recent years we will put in more in the

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.469 
recent years we will put in more in the
coming<00:01:04.290> years<00:01:05.210> unfortunately<00:01:06.210> there<00:01:06.299> is<00:01:06.450> a

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
coming years unfortunately there is a

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.300 
coming years unfortunately there is a
limit<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:06.960> amount<00:01:07.049> of<00:01:07.380> land<00:01:07.740> available

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
limit to the amount of land available

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.090 
limit to the amount of land available
for<00:01:08.490> car<00:01:08.700> paid<00:01:09.200> so<00:01:10.200> there<00:01:10.409> isn't<00:01:10.710> an<00:01:10.770> endless

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
for car paid so there isn't an endless

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.950 
for car paid so there isn't an endless
supply<00:01:11.220> that<00:01:11.640> will<00:01:11.820> be<00:01:11.970> able<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.270> buy<00:01:12.510> depend

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
supply that will be able to buy depend

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.170 
supply that will be able to buy depend
so<00:01:13.260> it's<00:01:13.590> important<00:01:14.130> that<00:01:14.250> people<00:01:14.430> understand

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
so it's important that people understand

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.780 
so it's important that people understand
as<00:01:16.110> well<00:01:16.140> as<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.830> option<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.280> drive<00:01:17.520> into

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
as well as the option and drive into

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.390 
as well as the option and drive into
stations<00:01:18.270> I<00:01:18.479> can<00:01:18.900> capture<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.320> trains<00:01:19.619> to

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
stations I can capture the trains to

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.890 
stations I can capture the trains to
port<00:01:20.670> no<00:01:20.880> avail<00:01:21.180> themselves<00:01:21.750> of<00:01:21.780> other

port no avail themselves of other

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.050 
port no avail themselves of other

using a feeder bus service and that feed
and<00:01:25.330> number<00:01:25.630> of<00:01:25.690> our<00:01:25.870> stations<00:01:26.350> but<00:01:27.040> also<00:01:27.250> to

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:27.550 
and number of our stations but also to

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.610 
and number of our stations but also to
cycle<00:01:28.330> so<00:01:28.510> we<00:01:28.630> do<00:01:28.780> have<00:01:28.870> a<00:01:28.900> program<00:01:29.230> in<00:01:29.590> place

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:29.620 
cycle so we do have a program in place
