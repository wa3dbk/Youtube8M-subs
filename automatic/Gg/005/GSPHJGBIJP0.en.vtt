00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
the default startup project so i can't

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.070 
the default startup project so i can't
run<00:01:52.520> it<00:01:52.670> because<00:01:52.910> it's<00:01:53.060> a<00:01:53.150> dll<00:01:53.570> but<00:01:53.840> i<00:01:53.870> can

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
run it because it's a dll but i can

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.070 
run it because it's a dll but i can
build<00:01:54.230> it<00:01:54.970> it<00:01:55.970> takes<00:01:56.330> quite<00:01:56.570> a<00:01:56.630> little<00:01:56.930> while

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080 
build it it takes quite a little while

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.050 
build it it takes quite a little while
to<00:01:57.290> rebuild<00:01:57.710> because<00:01:58.190> it's<00:01:58.370> rebuilding<00:01:58.730> all

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
to rebuild because it's rebuilding all

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.970 
to rebuild because it's rebuilding all
of<00:01:59.450> those<00:01:59.600> projects<00:02:00.140> now<00:02:00.500> i'm<00:02:00.650> going<00:02:00.860> to

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:00.980 
of those projects now i'm going to

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.020 
of those projects now i'm going to
change<00:02:01.280> my<00:02:02.080> startup<00:02:03.080> project<00:02:03.590> to<00:02:04.310> project<00:02:04.520> one

and<00:02:06.550> this<00:02:07.550> is<00:02:07.820> an<00:02:08.110> executable<00:02:09.110> project<00:02:09.619> so<00:02:09.769> i

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
and this is an executable project so i

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.790 
and this is an executable project so i
can<00:02:10.069> run<00:02:10.280> it<00:02:10.459> a<00:02:10.550> very<00:02:11.450> simple<00:02:11.870> ribbon<00:02:12.080> and<00:02:12.379> now

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
can run it a very simple ribbon and now

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.380 
can run it a very simple ribbon and now
i'm<00:02:12.920> going<00:02:13.129> to<00:02:13.220> walk<00:02:13.430> through<00:02:13.760> the<00:02:13.910> code<00:02:14.150> with

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
i'm going to walk through the code with

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.870 
i'm going to walk through the code with
you<00:02:14.599> to<00:02:15.050> show<00:02:15.260> you<00:02:15.290> what<00:02:15.620> had<00:02:15.800> to<00:02:15.920> be<00:02:15.950> done<00:02:16.070> to

you to show you what had to be done to

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.390 
you to show you what had to be done to
create<00:02:17.060> this<00:02:17.420> basic<00:02:17.870> simple<00:02:18.080> ribbon<00:02:18.350> first<00:02:19.220> of

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
create this basic simple ribbon first of

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.420 
create this basic simple ribbon first of
all<00:02:19.520> there's<00:02:19.940> a

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
all there's a

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.229 
all there's a
it's<00:02:20.579> over<00:02:20.790> here<00:02:21.030> to<00:02:21.629> that<00:02:21.900> ribbon<00:02:22.200> dll<00:02:22.829> and

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 
it's over here to that ribbon dll and

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:27.080 
it's over here to that ribbon dll and
then<00:02:24.239> if<00:02:24.359> i<00:02:24.480> open<00:02:24.659> forum<00:02:25.140> one<00:02:25.879> you<00:02:26.879> can<00:02:27.060> see

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
then if i open forum one you can see

00:02:32.179 --> 00:02:32.189 
here in the class you can see that i'm

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:35.479 
here in the class you can see that i'm
instantiated<00:02:33.060> a<00:02:33.329> ribbon<00:02:33.629> object<00:02:34.049> and<00:02:34.489> also

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
instantiated a ribbon object and also

instantiated a ribbon object and also
that<00:02:36.030> i've<00:02:36.209> added<00:02:36.510> to<00:02:36.900> form<00:02:37.230> one<00:02:37.530> a

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
that i've added to form one a

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:40.369 
that i've added to form one a
declaration<00:02:39.239> that<00:02:39.269> it's<00:02:39.569> going<00:02:39.810> to<00:02:39.930> implement

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379 
declaration that it's going to implement

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:43.550 
declaration that it's going to implement
I<00:02:41.000> ribbon<00:02:42.000> form<00:02:42.299> now<00:02:42.810> that<00:02:43.049> interface

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
I ribbon form now that interface

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.709 
I ribbon form now that interface
requires<00:02:44.099> two<00:02:44.430> things<00:02:44.459> and<00:02:45.030> here<00:02:45.540> they<00:02:45.689> are

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:45.719 
requires two things and here they are

00:02:45.719 --> 00:02:47.479 
requires two things and here they are
here<00:02:45.840> are<00:02:46.260> its<00:02:46.500> members<00:02:46.920> i'm<00:02:47.010> going<00:02:47.189> to<00:02:47.280> open

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
here are its members i'm going to open

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.729 
here are its members i'm going to open
up<00:02:47.609> this<00:02:47.760> collapsed<00:02:48.359> section<00:02:48.719> and<00:02:49.049> show<00:02:49.680> you

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
up this collapsed section and show you

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:53.420 
up this collapsed section and show you
one<00:02:50.159> is<00:02:50.340> a<00:02:50.370> window<00:02:51.359> handle<00:02:51.810> property<00:02:52.319> and<00:02:52.590> the

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
one is a window handle property and the

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.649 
one is a window handle property and the
other<00:02:53.579> is<00:02:53.909> a<00:02:54.780> ribbon<00:02:55.620> height<00:02:56.040> updated<00:02:57.000> very

00:02:57.649 --> 00:02:57.659 
other is a ribbon height updated very

00:02:57.659 --> 00:02:59.420 
other is a ribbon height updated very
simple<00:02:58.109> but<00:02:58.230> you<00:02:58.409> do<00:02:58.560> have<00:02:58.680> to<00:02:58.829> implement<00:02:59.099> them

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
simple but you do have to implement them

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.960 
simple but you do have to implement them
and<00:03:00.829> then<00:03:01.829> the<00:03:01.950> only<00:03:02.129> thing<00:03:02.250> left<00:03:02.579> to<00:03:02.700> do<00:03:02.819> in

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
and then the only thing left to do in

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.869 
and then the only thing left to do in
maine<00:03:03.209> is<00:03:03.739> to<00:03:04.739> initialize<00:03:05.040> the<00:03:05.579> ribbon

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:05.879 
maine is to initialize the ribbon

framework on form load and then destroy

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:12.229 
framework on form load and then destroy
it<00:03:08.639> when<00:03:09.150> the<00:03:09.269> form<00:03:09.510> closes<00:03:09.989> and<00:03:10.909> now<00:03:11.909> i'm<00:03:12.060> done

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
it when the form closes and now i'm done

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.539 
it when the form closes and now i'm done
with<00:03:12.419> the<00:03:12.540> form<00:03:12.810> one<00:03:12.989> code<00:03:13.349> let's<00:03:14.069> look<00:03:14.280> at<00:03:14.430> the

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
the fixed panel was panel one this one

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.800 
the fixed panel was panel one this one
here<00:03:42.329> at<00:03:42.389> the<00:03:42.479> top<00:03:43.549> that<00:03:44.549> the<00:03:44.790> dock<00:03:45.030> style<00:03:45.479> is

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
here at the top that the dock style is

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:53.119 
here at the top that the dock style is
fill<00:03:49.879> that<00:03:50.879> the<00:03:51.120> is<00:03:51.359> splitter<00:03:52.019> fixed<00:03:52.560> property

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:53.129

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:57.170 
fill that the is splitter fixed property
is<00:03:53.310> true<00:03:54.739> that<00:03:55.739> the<00:03:55.979> orientations<00:03:56.939> is

horizontal and that the splitter width
is<00:04:04.139> one<00:04:05.810> ok<00:04:06.810> so<00:04:06.870> that's<00:04:07.229> the<00:04:07.439> design<00:04:07.979> part<00:04:08.250> and

is one ok so that's the design part and

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:11.059 
is one ok so that's the design part and
then<00:04:09.239> you<00:04:09.780> have<00:04:10.019> to<00:04:10.169> add<00:04:10.199> to<00:04:10.560> the<00:04:10.680> basic
