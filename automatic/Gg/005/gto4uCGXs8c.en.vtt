00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 halli hello and welcome to the 30th episode 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.560
 of fifa 14 red I think so of course 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.410
 still on the ps3 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.120
 but they have our new team for that 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.889
 and we will play with console 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.680
 our new team then today once more 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.070
 after we follow in the last though 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.109
 I'm not mistaking the silver 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.460
 have won the cup final and that time 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.000
 again a book grab us 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.730
 to have 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.289
 yes, it should continue this time with the 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.420
 Gold Cup we had the first round 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.300
 already graduated and we have 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.030
 today, then almost the two 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.739
 next round we were one 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.629
 semi-final today and not for that 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.469
 final'm so the trophy ran again 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.910
 make perfect 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.860
 ida in the first try the whole 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.530
 profit taking in the first game against 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.300
 the seven are not quite dangerous 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.309
 looking bundesliga team with 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.600
 lewandowski and mandzukic in front 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.489
 particularly on so-called, of course, a striker 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.289
 against the man not so much 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.000
 arriving at flanks also lewandowski 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.859
 of course not much worse 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.890
 and if now to meet the 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:05.040
 post by strotmann and it was one 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.060
 In any case, I am in the lot 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.420
 I would not say I was totally 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.880
 but I think I was superior 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.290
 somewhere the visitorship he had 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.340
 not really anything forward 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.270
 offer then it is also logical 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.100
 christian benteke who meets for 1 0 per 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.020
 wonderful outfit shot stroked that 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.119
 position game by kfw and then isses 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.470
 shut up I try the whole thing 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.850
 again here in the first try too 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.290
 create and with the silver team at it 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.820
 Yes, whether it is now with the gold 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.100
 team works that depends on now 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.930
 little next contender but there meets 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.460
 this time only the latte there we would have 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.530
 already can put on 2 10:00 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.570
 must have chance but remains there 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.600
 detail again on the ball and also the 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.619
 lose the ball and then it's so 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.869
 but once in the other direction 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.850
 affect the latte and quasi in the 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.040
 direct counterattack a long ball on 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.979
 robert lewandowski then very bad 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.850
 defended by me and it stands 1 1 in 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:58.649
 the 45 minute game again balanced 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:01.049
 rather undeserved but good is so 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.490
 fifa sometimes sometimes and therefore can 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.200
 I do not do so much then always 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.880
 this dreamlike ball of d started up 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.160
 place the middle part of the profits 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.310
 because the ball somehow comes to kevin de 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.739
 bruyne so what the keeper then makes 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.420
 I'm not wonderful either 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:16.690
 may be toys this class ball 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.430
 from the past perfect in the foot of 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:22.040
 memphis trying to hit the ball 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.480
 put on thick but in the last end 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.370
 defended and almost always the 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.640
 keeper there trying to fit i know it 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.930
 Not 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:31.280
 the tan is there and hits the 2 2 1 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.750
 and so we were back in management 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.640
 Of course it would be nice if we did it completely 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:38.330
 win again in the first try 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:42.459
 Shaqiri and twice stevan we have only 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:45.830
 my goal is still handanovic 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:47.690
 so that keeps us here are the top five 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.230
 and opponent then of course brought barack 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.019
 obama 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.489
 you look for patterns for soft so from 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:54.440
 At this moment he has a lot of pace 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:55.970
 You can already change that way to me 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.120
 But everything has a chance of everything 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.470
 make and fail keeper I know 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.450
 not like thin-skinned the two cases 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.970
 or eagle i just do not know 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.470
 next pass again on mirallas great 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.720
 in the gap schmelzer I can 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:12.140
 keep up and then it happened 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:14.299
 that three single earned 75 minutes 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.950
 deserves and, above all, very nice 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:17.900
 important because now was the pressure 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.310
 of course a bit out of that 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.390
 game 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.220
 and even if the enemy again 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.950
 should make it was kind of just 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:27.290
 because yes, okay, I still have it 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.280
 the two-goal lead superparade still 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.100
 from handanovic 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.329
 and yes, it was actually over 92 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.769
 minutes to a party 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:37.549
 jan-david graduation 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:39.560
 mirallas the paderborn elaborate and 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:41.600
 Band is gone with the fat again 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.370
 AuÃŸenrist hopefully the guy is too 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.930
 Simply I mean, I've said I 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.700
 I would like to give them a try 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.680
 something I have never made reed, and 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:52.790
 the most bought player in fifa 10 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:54.290
 ultimate team yes even if I already 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.519
 you have to say on the games 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.280
 Now I understand that quite naturally 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:59.870
 even more wins every header felt 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.180
 is death feels strong pretty much 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.430
 quickly and feels his shot 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:06.170
 just incredibly strong so 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.160
 as strong as he is about the same 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:09.049
 his shot about 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:12.049
 So that's pretty hard thing 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:14.090
 he had to offer works and on and 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:15.410
 so definitely a pretty 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.630
 overpowered striker 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:20.510
 to say so and now there was 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:22.520
 quasi even now experienced and by 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:26.270
 Therefore, I can do it more first 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:28.070
 Hand testify that I am so overboard 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:31.640
 yes then it was already the last 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:33.020
 for this Cup match and us 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:34.940
 of course wanted to try somehow 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.800
 to win this cup final like 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:38.180
 first said to who the whole already 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.180
 pretty nice if you can do it 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:43.220
 could be necessary but everything serious 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:45.530
 thing depending on can come on others 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.690
 he I 've got it in the final you can 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:49.880
 either against the strongest 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:51.740
 opponents come or you have 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.810
 somehow very lucky and meets 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.010
 really really bad what had 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.570
 I now in silver a few more times 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:59.350
 final in the final of our team 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:59.350
 I thought okay 

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:04.400
 interesting how the hell are you! 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:04.940
 I would like to come to the finale 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.770
 let's know 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:09.650
 Something like that I also had a few one 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:11.300
 gold finale always the last years and 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:13.250
 so it was definitely 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:18.040
 interesting against what would come to me 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:22.910
 and the answer immediately followed 5221 

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:26.000
 brazil team my gold went something like that 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:28.070
 you just do not want to compete 120 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.760
 the full chemistry because of hard in the gate 

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:34.070
 but that's just pace that's just pace 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:36.080
 this team millions and lukas on the 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:39.110
 outside so I rarely have such problems 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:40.790
 There was somehow in tempo in 14 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:42.260
 So keep up actually went the 

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:44.870
 so far always clear if you have something 

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.980
 slower fullback I have 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:47.540
 Mine we have no slow 

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:49.210
 We have left-back on the outside 

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:52.250
 we have 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:53.600
 danilo and left me williams 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:56.740
 it is not the slowest of the 

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:59.990
 Share with well over 80 pace but 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:02.480
 Lukas and william have run me about it 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:04.190
 being a believer is not at all 

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:06.230
 funny it was definitely with that 

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:08.330
 worst game today in 14 very 

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:10.190
 should play a five-chain the 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:11.419
 defensive or very defensive in there 

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:14.000
 I do not know for sure 

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:16.520
 and then just a long tall one 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.500
 or a steep pass on lukas and or 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:20.330
 million and yes then my defense 

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:23.449
 still shit out though 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:26.060
 could keep up with his striker 0 

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:27.319
 was just totally weird first me 

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:29.120
 can not do that at all anyway 

00:06:27.319 --> 00:06:30.800
 attack as soon as lost to him 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.229
 had in midfield, it was very fast 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:35.270
 the other direction and he somehow a 

00:06:32.229 --> 00:06:37.639
 private one played on lukas and co 

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:39.229
 if they got bored simply 

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:40.699
 started playing this backside 

00:06:39.229 --> 00:06:42.620
 is my very first shot on goal 

00:06:40.699 --> 00:06:45.650
 by the pi but of course no problem 

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:47.810
 for eagle in goal so that should be confessed 

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:50.659
 a really funky game of fives 

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:52.669
 on defensive or the defensive and then 

00:06:50.659 --> 00:06:56.419
 this still has this fast-paced 

00:06:52.669 --> 00:06:58.370
 Striker and yes you do not have to go further 

00:06:56.419 --> 00:07:00.199
 that's the worst kind of thing 

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:02.240
 of teams and especially players 

00:07:00.199 --> 00:07:04.370
 I went to play my wife 

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:06.250
 Nicola is just behind 

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:08.659
 and start playing 

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:10.580
 From this moment on, something has happened 

00:07:08.659 --> 00:07:12.919
 better for me at tk today the ball 

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:15.020
 and then try and in the second attempt 

00:07:12.919 --> 00:07:16.550
 Somehow I still thought Chancellor 

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:19.580
 I do not do that now either 

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:21.800
 but the ones to meet for to individual 

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:23.389
 new hope we still have 

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:25.039
 time but you know if not 

00:07:23.389 --> 00:07:28.940
 works then works anyway 

00:07:25.039 --> 00:07:31.340
 nothing here and then benteke but also 

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:33.319
 the ball is deflected and all 

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:35.960
 in the end we are already without problems 

00:07:33.319 --> 00:07:37.009
 the 81 minute and we as nothing indicates 

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:39.250
 point out that we again 

00:07:37.009 --> 00:07:41.930
 return benteke for the tan and 

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:44.210
 Also this ball finds the way new 

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:45.710
 line no why would also be too 

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:49.520
 funny that's just a goal so do 

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:51.440
 wins this yes ultimately 4 to 1 against 

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:53.150
 not from the statistics ultimately a 

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:56.180
 total and deserved victory in height 

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:58.310
 but well that one has in the round 

00:07:56.180 --> 00:08:00.979
 before that one can say and he was 

00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:02.330
 simply one of them wrong in 

00:08:00.979 --> 00:08:03.770
 stood in and ultimately is 

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:06.319
 mostly nothing to do if you 

00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:07.909
 such a basic rumspielt well I've got 

00:08:06.319 --> 00:08:09.169
 It would not be so much better if itself 

00:08:07.909 --> 00:08:10.430
 many Rheinermark but I want 

00:08:09.169 --> 00:08:12.139
 of course in a rating of you 

00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:13.789
 happy and then I have the next 

00:08:12.139 --> 00:08:16.900
 video again a bit people then 

00:08:13.789 --> 00:08:16.900
 new about themes and beautiful
