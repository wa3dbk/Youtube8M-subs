I<00:02:44.060> don't<00:02:44.780> always<00:02:44.990> encapsulate<00:02:45.980> when<00:02:46.190> I<00:02:46.220> use

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
I don't always encapsulate when I use

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.480 
I don't always encapsulate when I use
acrylic<00:02:46.760> colors<00:02:47.420> but<00:02:48.260> in<00:02:48.410> this<00:02:48.560> case<00:02:48.920> I<00:02:49.160> did

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:49.490 
acrylic colors but in this case I did

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:52.050 
acrylic colors but in this case I did
because<00:02:50.180> of<00:02:50.360> the<00:02:50.480> metallic<00:02:50.930> silver<00:02:51.410> I<00:02:51.830> have

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
because of the metallic silver I have

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.540 
because of the metallic silver I have
this<00:02:53.060> idea<00:02:53.480> that<00:02:53.600> it<00:02:53.870> looks<00:02:54.050> better

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
this idea that it looks better
