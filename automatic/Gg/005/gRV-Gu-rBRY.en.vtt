this<00:01:11.880> is

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
this is

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.490 
this is
your<00:01:14.439> first<00:01:14.770> strike<00:01:15.009> ration<00:01:16.170> it's<00:01:17.170> the<00:01:17.320> first

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
your first strike ration it's the first

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.870 
your first strike ration it's the first
one<00:01:17.679> of<00:01:17.770> these<00:01:17.829> that<00:01:18.009> I've<00:01:18.130> ever<00:01:18.280> had<00:01:18.549> so<00:01:18.820> I'm

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
one of these that I've ever had so I'm

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:27.630 
one of these that I've ever had so I'm
pretty<00:01:19.060> excited<00:01:19.299> about<00:01:19.450> that

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.399 

first<00:01:28.640> strike<00:01:28.820> fashion<00:01:29.210> it's<00:01:30.109> obviously

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
first strike fashion it's obviously

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:35.630 
first strike fashion it's obviously
somewhat<00:01:30.740> similar<00:01:31.100> to<00:01:31.130> in<00:01:31.549> Amar'e

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.240 

it<00:01:36.640> feels<00:01:36.850> quite<00:01:37.030> a<00:01:37.120> bit<00:01:37.270> heavier<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:38.770> the

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
it feels quite a bit heavier and the

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.470 
it feels quite a bit heavier and the
point<00:01:39.490> of<00:01:39.610> these<00:01:39.730> is<00:01:40.060> that<00:01:40.240> an<00:01:40.390> MRE<00:01:40.690> meal

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:42.480 
point of these is that an MRE meal

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.720 
point of these is that an MRE meal
ready-to-eat<00:01:43.480> is<00:01:43.750> meant<00:01:43.930> for<00:01:43.960> one<00:01:44.200> meal<00:01:44.730> first

00:02:59.309 --> 00:02:59.319 
about them but it's usually just looking

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:00.660 
about them but it's usually just looking
at<00:02:59.440> them<00:02:59.590> you<00:03:00.190> don't<00:03:00.340> see<00:03:00.430> too<00:03:00.489> many<00:03:00.549> people

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
at them you don't see too many people

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.280 
at them you don't see too many people
opening<00:03:01.060> them<00:03:01.180> up<00:03:01.239> and<00:03:01.420> reviewing<00:03:01.690> them<00:03:01.900> but

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
opening them up and reviewing them but

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.460 
opening them up and reviewing them but
gundog<00:03:02.940> has<00:03:03.940> made<00:03:04.150> some<00:03:04.450> memory<00:03:04.750> usage<00:03:05.379> to

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
gundog has made some memory usage to

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.979 
gundog has made some memory usage to
checkout<00:03:05.890> and<00:03:06.160> he<00:03:06.700> has<00:03:06.819> done<00:03:07.060> a<00:03:07.360> couple<00:03:07.569> on<00:03:07.840> the

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
checkout and he has done a couple on the

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:10.500 
checkout and he has done a couple on the
first<00:03:08.200> straight<00:03:08.410> crash<00:03:08.910> so<00:03:09.910> I<00:03:09.940> don't<00:03:10.360> think

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
first straight crash so I don't think

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:11.610 
first straight crash so I don't think
that<00:03:10.630> won't<00:03:10.690> be<00:03:10.810> the<00:03:10.900> first<00:03:11.079> to<00:03:11.200> do<00:03:11.319> it<00:03:11.440> but

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
that won't be the first to do it but

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.740 
that won't be the first to do it but
they'll<00:03:11.950> do<00:03:12.099> my<00:03:12.220> own<00:03:12.370> videos<00:03:12.700> on<00:03:12.880> it<00:03:13.030> too<00:03:13.180> in

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
they'll do my own videos on it too in

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.519 
they'll do my own videos on it too in
the<00:03:13.989> near<00:03:14.140> future<00:03:14.290> so<00:03:14.650> stay<00:03:15.069> tuned<00:03:15.280> for<00:03:15.310> that
