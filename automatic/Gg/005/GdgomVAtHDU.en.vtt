00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
lesson I'm going to show you this basic

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.510 
lesson I'm going to show you this basic
pattern<00:01:18.600> so<00:01:19.049> you<00:01:19.110> can<00:01:19.380> practice<00:01:19.619> it<00:01:20.040> goes<00:01:20.340> like

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
pattern so you can practice it goes like

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:38.350 
pattern so you can practice it goes like
this

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.480 

there<00:01:39.360> are<00:01:39.540> two<00:01:39.930> main<00:01:40.320> components<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:41.190> this

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
there are two main components to this

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.380 
there are two main components to this
rhythmic<00:01:42.150> guitar<00:01:42.780> style<00:01:43.580> first<00:01:44.580> the<00:01:45.180> bass

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
rhythmic guitar style first the bass

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.290 
rhythmic guitar style first the bass
line<00:01:45.780> it<00:01:46.200> follows<00:01:46.830> a<00:01:46.860> common<00:01:47.460> latin<00:01:47.880> pattern

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:48.300 
line it follows a common latin pattern

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.990 
line it follows a common latin pattern
called<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.750> one-five<00:01:49.400> meaning<00:01:50.400> playing<00:01:50.729> the

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
called the one-five meaning playing the

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.770 
called the one-five meaning playing the
root<00:01:51.210> and<00:01:51.900> the<00:01:52.680> fifth<00:01:53.270> so<00:01:54.270> it<00:01:54.390> goes<00:01:54.540> like<00:01:54.630> this

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
root and the fifth so it goes like this

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:05.660 
root and the fifth so it goes like this
but<00:02:02.690> bass<00:02:03.690> players<00:02:04.259> tend<00:02:04.619> to<00:02:04.830> invert<00:02:05.369> the

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
but bass players tend to invert the

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.809 
but bass players tend to invert the
fifth<00:02:06.000> meaning<00:02:06.899> playing<00:02:07.259> it<00:02:07.500> one<00:02:08.250> octave

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
fifth meaning playing it one octave

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.870 
fifth meaning playing it one octave
below<00:02:09.200> so<00:02:10.200> that<00:02:10.440> movement<00:02:10.950> turns<00:02:11.160> turns<00:02:11.580> into

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
below so that movement turns turns into

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:23.720 
below so that movement turns turns into
this<00:02:19.700> and<00:02:20.930> the<00:02:21.930> second<00:02:22.590> part<00:02:22.980> is<00:02:23.190> related<00:02:23.700> to

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
this and the second part is related to

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.990 
this and the second part is related to
the<00:02:23.940> higher<00:02:24.150> notes<00:02:24.950> there<00:02:25.950> you<00:02:26.489> play<00:02:26.820> the

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
the higher notes there you play the

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.540 
the higher notes there you play the
strong<00:02:27.390> beat<00:02:27.660> with<00:02:27.930> the<00:02:28.080> bass<00:02:28.290> one<00:02:28.980> time<00:02:29.250> and

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
strong beat with the bass one time and

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.030 
strong beat with the bass one time and
do<00:02:30.120> some<00:02:30.540> syncopation<00:02:30.989> thereafter<00:02:31.860> so<00:02:32.340> the

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
do some syncopation thereafter so the

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.320 
do some syncopation thereafter so the
basic<00:02:35.040> movement<00:02:35.400> will<00:02:35.519> be<00:02:35.550> like<00:02:35.819> this<00:02:36.060> just

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
basic movement will be like this just

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
basic movement will be like this just
the<00:02:36.480> higher<00:02:36.690> notes<00:02:53.150> now<00:02:54.150> if<00:02:54.450> you<00:02:54.630> combine<00:02:55.110> the

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
the higher notes now if you combine the

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.069 
the higher notes now if you combine the
two<00:02:55.380> elements<00:02:56.280> you<00:02:56.519> get<00:02:56.790> the<00:02:57.180> basic<00:02:57.630> pattern<00:02:57.989> I

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
two elements you get the basic pattern I

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:08.010 
two elements you get the basic pattern I
show<00:02:58.290> you<00:02:58.320> earlier

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.020 

so<00:03:09.020> in<00:03:09.140> the<00:03:09.230> next<00:03:09.440> section<00:03:09.770> I<00:03:10.160> will<00:03:10.280> do<00:03:10.670> a<00:03:10.700> close

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
so in the next section I will do a close

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.510 
so in the next section I will do a close
up<00:03:11.060> of<00:03:11.390> both<00:03:11.690> hands<00:03:12.230> so<00:03:12.590> that<00:03:12.620> you<00:03:12.920> can<00:03:13.130> see<00:03:13.370> the

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:13.520 
up of both hands so that you can see the

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.720 
up of both hands so that you can see the
details<00:03:14.770> let's<00:03:15.770> start<00:03:16.160> with<00:03:16.400> the<00:03:16.520> right<00:03:16.700> hand

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
details let's start with the right hand

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.650 
details let's start with the right hand
in<00:03:17.270> the<00:03:17.360> baseline<00:03:18.200> you<00:03:18.790> pluck<00:03:19.790> the<00:03:20.030> baseline

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
in the baseline you pluck the baseline

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.900 
in the baseline you pluck the baseline
with<00:03:21.110> your<00:03:21.350> thumb<00:03:21.710> because<00:03:21.950> you<00:03:22.400> need<00:03:22.550> to<00:03:22.700> keep

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
with your thumb because you need to keep

in one final note I wanted to tell

in one final note I wanted to tell
before<00:06:28.649> I<00:06:28.679> end<00:06:28.830> the<00:06:28.949> lesson<00:06:29.159> is<00:06:29.489> that<00:06:29.969> once<00:06:30.929> you

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:31.080 
before I end the lesson is that once you

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:33.109 
before I end the lesson is that once you
get<00:06:31.229> used<00:06:31.499> to<00:06:31.619> this<00:06:31.769> pattern<00:06:32.279> if<00:06:32.429> you<00:06:32.669> can<00:06:32.879> play

00:06:33.109 --> 00:06:33.119 
get used to this pattern if you can play

00:06:33.119 --> 00:06:44.149 
get used to this pattern if you can play
it<00:06:33.299> fast<00:06:33.689> like<00:06:34.110> this<00:06:42.349> then<00:06:43.349> what<00:06:43.919> you're

00:06:44.149 --> 00:06:44.159 
it fast like this then what you're

00:06:44.159 --> 00:06:47.059 
it fast like this then what you're
getting<00:06:44.549> here<00:06:44.579> is<00:06:44.909> more<00:06:45.119> of<00:06:45.239> a<00:06:45.329> Samba<00:06:45.929> feel<00:06:46.259> you

00:06:47.059 --> 00:06:47.069 
getting here is more of a Samba feel you

00:06:47.069 --> 00:06:49.819 
getting here is more of a Samba feel you
see<00:06:47.339> like<00:06:47.669> I<00:06:47.699> said<00:06:47.999> before<00:06:48.209> Boston<00:06:49.079> ovens<00:06:49.589> done

00:06:49.819 --> 00:06:49.829 
see like I said before Boston ovens done

00:06:49.829 --> 00:06:51.679 
see like I said before Boston ovens done
but<00:06:50.009> they<00:06:50.279> have<00:06:50.610> similar<00:06:51.089> roots<00:06:51.329> and<00:06:51.569> it's

00:06:51.679 --> 00:06:51.689 
but they have similar roots and it's

00:06:51.689 --> 00:06:54.859 
but they have similar roots and it's
like<00:06:51.989> jazz<00:06:52.469> and<00:06:52.799> bebop<00:06:53.189> but<00:06:53.939> one<00:06:54.209> is<00:06:54.389> play<00:06:54.659> the

00:06:54.859 --> 00:06:54.869 
like jazz and bebop but one is play the

00:06:54.869 --> 00:06:57.799 
like jazz and bebop but one is play the
much<00:06:55.139> faster<00:06:55.439> tempos<00:06:56.300> thanks<00:06:57.300> for<00:06:57.449> watching

00:06:57.799 --> 00:06:57.809 
much faster tempos thanks for watching
