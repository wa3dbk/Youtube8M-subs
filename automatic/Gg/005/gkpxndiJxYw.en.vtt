00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.210 
part of being a kid and a teenager is
this<00:02:33.080> feeling<00:02:33.319> of<00:02:33.470> invincibility<00:02:34.870> but<00:02:36.220> over

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
this feeling of invincibility but over

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.699 
this feeling of invincibility but over
the<00:02:37.670> past<00:02:37.880> a<00:02:38.390> couple<00:02:38.510> years<00:02:39.230> I've<00:02:39.470> had<00:02:39.590> to

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
the past a couple years I've had to

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:41.280 
the past a couple years I've had to
realize<00:02:40.040> that<00:02:40.069> that's<00:02:40.400> just<00:02:40.670> not<00:02:40.819> true

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
realize that that's just not true

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.259 
realize that that's just not true
remember<00:02:42.290> that<00:02:42.860> if<00:02:42.980> you<00:02:43.100> suffer<00:02:43.580> concussion

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:44.269 
remember that if you suffer concussion

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:46.750 
remember that if you suffer concussion
you're<00:02:44.810> probably<00:02:45.170> not<00:02:45.709> going<00:02:45.980> to<00:02:46.040> perform<00:02:46.459> at

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
you're probably not going to perform at

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.420 
you're probably not going to perform at
the<00:02:47.209> level<00:02:47.480> you're<00:02:47.600> capable<00:02:47.840> of<00:02:48.230> so<00:02:48.500> not<00:02:49.040> only

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
the level you're capable of so not only

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.550 
the level you're capable of so not only
is<00:02:49.670> it<00:02:49.819> not<00:02:50.180> going<00:02:50.420> to<00:02:50.480> help<00:02:50.720> out<00:02:50.900> the<00:02:51.079> team<00:02:51.110> or

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
is it not going to help out the team or

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.069 
is it not going to help out the team or
help<00:02:52.040> out<00:02:52.190> your<00:02:52.370> individual<00:02:52.880> performance<00:02:53.510> but

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:54.079 
help out your individual performance but

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:56.080 
help out your individual performance but
could<00:02:54.290> be<00:02:54.380> dangerous<00:02:54.920> for<00:02:55.489> not<00:02:55.640> just<00:02:55.910> that

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
could be dangerous for not just that

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:01.949 
could be dangerous for not just that
season<00:02:56.989> but<00:02:57.380> for<00:02:57.560> the<00:02:57.620> rest<00:02:57.769> of<00:02:57.890> your<00:02:58.010> life

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:04.000 

certainly<00:03:02.959> after<00:03:03.109> my<00:03:03.230> first<00:03:03.500> experience<00:03:03.980> of

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
certainly after my first experience of

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.500 
certainly after my first experience of
eating<00:03:04.280> a<00:03:04.340> couple<00:03:04.609> concussions<00:03:04.790> at<00:03:05.209> a<00:03:05.269> time

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
eating a couple concussions at a time

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.590 
eating a couple concussions at a time
that<00:03:06.049> the<00:03:06.709> more<00:03:06.890> happened<00:03:07.340> the<00:03:08.030> more<00:03:08.209> severe

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
that the more happened the more severe

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.569 
that the more happened the more severe
was<00:03:08.810> and<00:03:09.109> the<00:03:09.530> harder<00:03:09.799> it<00:03:09.859> was<00:03:09.950> to<00:03:10.010> bounce<00:03:10.310> back

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:10.579 
was and the harder it was to bounce back

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:13.840 
was and the harder it was to bounce back

on time needing extra time to do things
and<00:03:18.200> just<00:03:18.560> kind<00:03:18.739> of<00:03:18.829> put<00:03:19.160> together<00:03:19.340> ideas<00:03:19.700> in

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
and just kind of put together ideas in

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.539 
and just kind of put together ideas in
class<00:03:20.180> afterwards<00:03:22.840> definitely<00:03:23.840> that<00:03:24.019> the

class afterwards definitely that the

class afterwards definitely that the
recovery<00:03:25.549> time<00:03:25.730> got<00:03:25.970> a<00:03:26.000> lot<00:03:26.299> longer<00:03:26.570> and<00:03:27.170> in

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:27.799 
recovery time got a lot longer and in

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:29.440 
recovery time got a lot longer and in
the<00:03:27.920> case<00:03:28.100> of<00:03:28.280> the<00:03:28.549> last<00:03:28.730> time<00:03:28.940> I<00:03:28.970> hit<00:03:29.180> my<00:03:29.299> head

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
I mean it was it was years before I felt

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.349 
I mean it was it was years before I felt
more<00:03:32.630> or<00:03:32.780> less<00:03:32.959> normal<00:03:33.670> the<00:03:34.670> proper
