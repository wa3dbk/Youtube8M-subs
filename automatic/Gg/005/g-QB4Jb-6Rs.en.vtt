00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:54.990 
the wireless models were includes 802 11
in<00:01:50.469> and<00:01:51.009> it<00:01:51.729> it<00:01:52.630> costs<00:01:53.170> 199<00:01:53.560> dollars<00:01:54.250> MSRP

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
in and it it costs 199 dollars MSRP

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.190 
in and it it costs 199 dollars MSRP
these<00:01:55.390> are<00:01:55.509> coming<00:01:55.810> they're<00:01:55.960> not<00:01:56.079> available

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
these are coming they're not available

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.109 
these are coming they're not available
yet<00:01:56.649> they<00:01:56.829> will<00:01:56.979> be<00:01:57.069> available<00:01:57.310> first<00:01:57.700> quarter

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119 
yet they will be available first quarter

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:00.600 
yet they will be available first quarter
and<00:01:58.509> so<00:01:58.899> what<00:01:59.110> it<00:01:59.229> actually<00:01:59.409> does<00:01:59.679> is<00:02:00.189> it

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
and so what it actually does is it

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.050 
and so what it actually does is it
streams<00:02:00.909> directly<00:02:01.600> from<00:02:01.810> your<00:02:01.899> PC<00:02:02.610> to<00:02:03.610> your

streams directly from your PC to your

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.899 
streams directly from your PC to your
television<00:02:04.390> so<00:02:05.200> over<00:02:05.829> wireless<00:02:06.100> technology

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909 
television so over wireless technology

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:09.539 
television so over wireless technology
or<00:02:07.090> over<00:02:07.420> wired<00:02:07.689> either<00:02:08.049> way<00:02:08.319> and<00:02:08.619> the<00:02:09.340> cool

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:09.549 
or over wired either way and the cool

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:11.460 
or over wired either way and the cool
thing<00:02:09.580> is<00:02:09.759> is<00:02:10.000> they<00:02:10.119> have<00:02:10.239> a<00:02:10.269> very<00:02:10.569> cool<00:02:10.959> remote

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
thing is is they have a very cool remote

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.940 
thing is is they have a very cool remote
with<00:02:11.709> a<00:02:11.739> full<00:02:12.099> qwerty<00:02:12.400> keyboard

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
with a full qwerty keyboard

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.920 
with a full qwerty keyboard
so<00:02:15.550> the<00:02:15.879> difference<00:02:16.060> between<00:02:16.270> this<00:02:16.569> and<00:02:16.629> say<00:02:16.900> i

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
so the difference between this and say i

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.559 
so the difference between this and say i
Roku<00:02:17.379> or<00:02:17.590> the<00:02:18.069> pop<00:02:18.250> box<00:02:18.550> this<00:02:19.209> is<00:02:19.390> obviously

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
Roku or the pop box this is obviously

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:21.089 
Roku or the pop box this is obviously
something<00:02:20.050> that's<00:02:20.410> a<00:02:20.530> little<00:02:20.680> bit<00:02:20.920> more

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:21.099 
something that's a little bit more

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:23.610 
something that's a little bit more
techie<00:02:21.459> it<00:02:22.390> does<00:02:22.629> make<00:02:22.840> it<00:02:22.989> possible<00:02:23.230> to

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
techie it does make it possible to

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.070 
techie it does make it possible to
navigate<00:02:23.950> the<00:02:24.580> full<00:02:24.849> internet<00:02:25.300> from<00:02:25.870> your
