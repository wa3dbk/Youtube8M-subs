00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.500
 I'll be angry . 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:12.300
 I'm just doing this sort of thing to taste the real 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:14.460
 In addition to the high-quality beans that give up work, the mug of coffee along with the pants 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.340
 It is variously equipped. 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:22.080
 Recently, I've been drinking this cup . 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:25.590
 And I think that's how the cat eyes look like this. 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:30.260
 It's pretty. It's better than just eating on a paper cup . 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.260
 If the cup is pretty, it looks like the taste is different. 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:40.879
 Her extraordinary coffee love is made of songs. 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.879
 Your coffee composition song, as well as the red song, is long and green. 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.160
 woo 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.160
 Oh 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:01:00.530
 How many of us are trapped alone. 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:05.170
 It's 3:00, but I think I'm a bit reluctant. 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.170
 I smoked more than a hundred words. 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:13.050
 The luxury brand of coffee shop with the best juniors of the road to re-word the pack 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.050
 I stopped by 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:21.890
 A cup of coffee that is more expensive than rice 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:26.720
 Bang me daughter controversial haeteotneunde also Diary What are her thoughts 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:31.070
 Or I heard such a sound as a joke on his friend 100 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:36.800
 Now that you've been around for a while, 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:38.960
 Oh, to what degree I can hear everything you say so luxurious geureongeol 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:45.710
 Laguji Adverb 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:47.539
 I need to do merely because I do not want to go again, I will pay 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:52.759
 For that we can limit 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:54.770
 I do not think time for preview is big because there is to enjoy it 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:59.420
 same 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:04.210
 Since the light bulb showed the Korean myth in the late 90's , 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.210
 The number of stores and sales are increasing every year. 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:11.870
 To find out why this is so, we have a brand coffee shop 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:16.459
 I prepared a picture of one or two women as background 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:21.650
 And I showed these photos to ae2 group of college students. 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:26.159
 a group of women for a career in pictures intellectual and tasteful chic brain circle 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:31.319
 For the back group, the banker asked the odds. 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:35.480
 As a result, the banker has a 72% 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:40.530
 The odds were higher than 53%. 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:42.090
 Common sense, the second case is more likely than the first case. 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:46.379
 Because the relationship is established. 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:51.599
 The first case is never more likely to happen. 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:56.040
 The answer is that the first case is much more this guy is a sophisticated and intelligent banker 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:03:01.079
 I do not have the memories of Hwang . 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:05.750
 If so, will the experimenters see these alternatives ? 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:05.750
 We have to look at using eye-tracking device 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:19.190
 In addition to this, the facilities of the participants are not only the women in the photos but also the environment 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:21.700
 You can see that you have stayed in coffee shops and coffee cup stores for a considerable time. 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.700
 I was there. 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:31.720
 Koreans are more likely than others in other western cultures 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:36.190
 When you look at any object, the background surrounding it 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:40.660
 Or maybe things are more about contextual information. 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:45.250
 This tendency was higher than average on average store coffee 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:50.530
 Then, if the surrounding environment suggests brand coffee, 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:54.490
 I keep cognition of the information and then I become the person 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:58.840
 I mean when I was thinking of forming an impression is cast 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:04:03.460
 So, like the main character in the film and out carrying the brand of coffee shop 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:07.720
 In the process of bucking the streets with branded coffee in one hand 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:08.740
 A desire to be seen as a sophisticated and intelligent person, 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.830
 Will 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:17.020
 I did not eat brand coffee . 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:22.090
 Sometimes I feel a little bit like I 'm going to get a little bit like that. 

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:28.540
 I used to drink a few times . Everybody was carrying a lot of coffee. 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:31.660
 Brand coffee Yes, I eat today, and I have your coffee name. 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:36.160
 You know, I do not know much. 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:40.210
 Then I felt something when a person looks directly when holding coffee 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:42.160
 I think the image looks better . 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:47.920
 more 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:52.120
 So the addition of sophisticated, 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:55.210
 The benefit is that it functions as a session. 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:05:01.920
 I also walked around with such a cup of quaker coffee. 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:01.920
 It sounds like a good New Yorker who seems to be a New Yorker 4
