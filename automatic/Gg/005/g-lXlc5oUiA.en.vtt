00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:13.490 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:16.430

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
the next one is a half-up half-down so

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.510 
the next one is a half-up half-down so
again<00:03:16.680> I'm<00:03:16.800> just<00:03:16.830> gonna<00:03:16.980> start<00:03:17.280> off<00:03:17.370> by

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:17.520 
again I'm just gonna start off by

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.910 
again I'm just gonna start off by
brushing<00:03:17.670> my<00:03:17.940> hair<00:03:18.180> then<00:03:18.660> I<00:03:18.690> split<00:03:19.110> my<00:03:19.200> parting

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
brushing my hair then I split my parting

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.160 
brushing my hair then I split my parting
into<00:03:20.250> two<00:03:20.430> parts<00:03:20.850> one<00:03:21.330> side<00:03:21.600> with<00:03:21.750> more<00:03:21.960> hair

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
into two parts one side with more hair

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:23.990 
into two parts one side with more hair
on<00:03:22.200> and<00:03:22.560> then<00:03:22.680> I<00:03:22.770> just<00:03:22.950> loosely<00:03:23.370> pinned<00:03:23.700> it<00:03:23.850> up

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
on and then I just loosely pinned it up

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.550 
on and then I just loosely pinned it up
and<00:03:24.240> it's<00:03:24.630> exactly<00:03:24.870> the<00:03:25.140> same<00:03:25.260> to<00:03:25.440> the<00:03:25.530> other

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
and it's exactly the same to the other

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.130 
and it's exactly the same to the other
side<00:03:25.740> so<00:03:26.130> one<00:03:26.400> hair<00:03:26.670> had<00:03:27.270> more<00:03:27.660> hair<00:03:27.870> than<00:03:28.080> the

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
side so one hair had more hair than the

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.170
