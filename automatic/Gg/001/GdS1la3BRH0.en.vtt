to remove and fold the cover and to

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:16.090 
to remove and fold the cover and to
install<00:00:13.970> it<00:00:14.180> again<00:00:14.330> it's<00:00:14.960> just<00:00:15.260> basically<00:00:15.769> the

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:16.100 
install it again it's just basically the

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.620 
install it again it's just basically the
revert<00:00:16.460> if<00:00:16.609> you<00:00:16.699> look<00:00:16.880> into<00:00:17.029> the<00:00:17.180> back<00:00:17.359> of<00:00:17.390> the

all the straps are loosened grab the

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:20.710 
all the straps are loosened grab the
corner<00:01:19.070> of<00:01:19.250> the<00:01:19.520> cover<00:01:20.000> where<00:01:20.450> the

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
corner of the cover where the

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.050 
corner of the cover where the
walkthrough<00:01:21.200> is<00:01:21.410> and<00:01:21.740> you're<00:01:22.550> basically

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
walkthrough is and you're basically

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.510 
walkthrough is and you're basically
going<00:01:23.300> to<00:01:23.510> fold<00:01:23.750> it<00:01:23.930> over<00:01:24.050> in<00:01:24.320> itself<00:01:24.740> probably

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
going to fold it over in itself probably

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.720 
going to fold it over in itself probably
two<00:01:26.120> to<00:01:26.330> three<00:01:26.360> times<00:01:27.190> now<00:01:28.190> if<00:01:28.310> you'll<00:01:28.490> notice

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:28.730 
two to three times now if you'll notice

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.420 
two to three times now if you'll notice
in<00:01:29.060> there<00:01:29.300> are<00:01:29.600> a<00:01:29.630> set<00:01:30.170> of<00:01:30.320> tent<00:01:30.590> poles<00:01:30.860> that

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
in there are a set of tent poles that

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.480 
in there are a set of tent poles that
actually<00:01:31.940> keep<00:01:32.180> the<00:01:32.330> cover<00:01:32.600> up<00:01:33.290> and<00:01:33.620> prevent

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
actually keep the cover up and prevent

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.510 
actually keep the cover up and prevent
water<00:01:34.760> from<00:01:34.940> pooling<00:01:35.690> in<00:01:35.870> your<00:01:36.020> cover<00:01:36.370> if<00:01:37.370> you

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
water from pooling in your cover if you

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.220 
water from pooling in your cover if you
can<00:01:37.640> see<00:01:37.850> Matt<00:01:38.090> he's<00:01:38.360> already<00:01:38.630> rolled<00:01:38.960> it<00:01:39.110> over

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:39.230 
can see Matt he's already rolled it over

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.560 
can see Matt he's already rolled it over
twice<00:01:39.650> and<00:01:39.950> he'll<00:01:40.430> pull<00:01:40.670> the<00:01:40.850> other<00:01:40.970> side<00:01:41.330> up

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
twice and he'll pull the other side up

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.420 
twice and he'll pull the other side up
and<00:01:41.780> roll<00:01:42.050> it<00:01:42.200> over<00:01:42.320> the<00:01:42.620> third<00:01:42.860> time<00:01:43.190> on

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
and roll it over the third time on

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.230 
and roll it over the third time on
itself<00:01:45.220> this<00:01:46.220> is<00:01:46.400> probably<00:01:46.640> the<00:01:46.940> most

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
itself this is probably the most

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.560 
itself this is probably the most
efficient<00:01:47.810> way<00:01:47.840> to<00:01:47.960> take<00:01:48.350> it<00:01:48.500> off<00:01:48.680> and<00:01:49.390> roll<00:01:50.390> it

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
efficient way to take it off and roll it

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.020 
efficient way to take it off and roll it
into<00:01:50.690> the<00:01:50.900> smallest<00:01:51.350> possible<00:01:51.620> bundle<00:01:52.370> for

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
into the smallest possible bundle for

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.960 
into the smallest possible bundle for
storage<00:01:53.680> now<00:01:54.680> he'll<00:01:54.890> start<00:01:55.159> at<00:01:55.340> the<00:01:55.460> back<00:01:55.640> and

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
storage now he'll start at the back and

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.090 
storage now he'll start at the back and
he'll<00:01:56.540> create<00:01:56.900> a<00:01:56.990> roll<00:01:57.380> just<00:01:57.740> like<00:01:57.920> you're

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
he'll create a roll just like you're

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.270 
he'll create a roll just like you're
doing<00:01:58.130> on<00:01:58.580> a<00:01:58.610> sleeping<00:01:59.150> bag<00:01:59.360> and<00:01:59.860> he<00:02:00.860> will<00:02:01.040> roll

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
doing on a sleeping bag and he will roll

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.790 
doing on a sleeping bag and he will roll
that<00:02:01.550> completely<00:02:02.150> up<00:02:05.080> all<00:02:06.080> the<00:02:06.320> way<00:02:06.440> to<00:02:06.500> the

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.800 
that completely up all the way to the

the taller pole in the rear what you do

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.280 
the taller pole in the rear what you do
is<00:02:38.330> you<00:02:38.420> pop<00:02:38.660> those<00:02:38.900> poles<00:02:39.200> out<00:02:39.800> and<00:02:41.290> their

length and put it in the socket on the

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:46.660 
length and put it in the socket on the
front<00:03:43.790> holder<00:03:44.410> now<00:03:45.410> he'll<00:03:45.739> take<00:03:45.769> the<00:03:46.070> Bimini

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
front holder now he'll take the Bimini

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.600 
front holder now he'll take the Bimini
and<00:03:46.880> he'll<00:03:47.480> hook<00:03:47.780> the<00:03:47.840> bow<00:03:48.260> part<00:03:48.709> over<00:03:49.310> the<00:03:49.340> bow

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 
and he'll hook the bow part over the bow

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.380 
and he'll hook the bow part over the bow
and<00:03:49.910> roll<00:03:50.690> it<00:03:50.870> backwards<00:03:51.410> the<00:03:52.400> reason<00:03:52.880> we<00:03:53.060> roll

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
and roll it backwards the reason we roll

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.020 
and roll it backwards the reason we roll
from<00:03:53.750> back<00:03:53.989> to<00:03:54.019> front<00:03:54.290> is<00:03:54.829> that<00:03:55.519> it's<00:03:55.670> always

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
from back to front is that it's always

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.630 
from back to front is that it's always
very<00:03:56.150> consistent<00:03:57.140> and<00:03:57.320> you<00:03:57.950> always<00:03:58.340> have<00:03:58.610> the

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640 
very consistent and you always have the

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.270 
very consistent and you always have the
front<00:03:59.090> hooked<00:03:59.480> over<00:03:59.720> and<00:04:00.110> then<00:04:00.500> you<00:04:00.680> take<00:04:00.980> the

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
front hooked over and then you take the

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.630 
front hooked over and then you take the
cover<00:04:01.820> to<00:04:02.299> the<00:04:02.329> rear<00:04:02.780> and<00:04:02.989> it's<00:04:03.980> very<00:04:04.250> simple

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 
cover to the rear and it's very simple

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.509 
cover to the rear and it's very simple
it's<00:04:05.030> just<00:04:05.420> an<00:04:05.570> exact<00:04:05.989> reverse<00:04:06.410> of<00:04:06.519> putting

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:07.519 
it's just an exact reverse of putting

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:17.320 
it's just an exact reverse of putting
the<00:04:07.700> cover<00:04:08.440> away

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:17.330 

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:19.789 

now<00:04:18.330> when<00:04:18.480> you're<00:04:18.630> on<00:04:18.750> a<00:04:18.780> dock<00:04:19.110> it's<00:04:19.440> a<00:04:19.560> little

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
now when you're on a dock it's a little

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:21.979 
now when you're on a dock it's a little
more<00:04:19.950> complicated<00:04:20.459> because<00:04:21.030> you're<00:04:21.690> at

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
more complicated because you're at

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:24.620 
more complicated because you're at
different<00:04:22.440> angles<00:04:22.850> sometimes<00:04:23.850> it<00:04:24.120> be<00:04:24.330> easier

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
different angles sometimes it be easier

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.170 
different angles sometimes it be easier
to<00:04:24.720> raise<00:04:25.050> your<00:04:25.380> boat<00:04:25.680> and<00:04:25.920> get<00:04:26.760> it<00:04:26.880> where<00:04:27.060> you

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
to raise your boat and get it where you

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.300 
to raise your boat and get it where you
can<00:04:27.210> reach<00:04:27.660> the<00:04:27.960> rails<00:04:28.200> and<00:04:28.680> have<00:04:29.010> it<00:04:29.160> at<00:04:29.280> a

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
can reach the rails and have it at a

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.820 
can reach the rails and have it at a
height<00:04:29.580> that's<00:04:29.970> workable<00:04:30.420> when<00:04:31.380> it's<00:04:31.530> on<00:04:31.680> the

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
height that's workable when it's on the

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.040 
height that's workable when it's on the
trailer<00:04:32.100> sometimes<00:04:32.970> it's<00:04:33.150> a<00:04:33.210> little<00:04:33.240> tall<00:04:33.690> and

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
trailer sometimes it's a little tall and

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.890 
trailer sometimes it's a little tall and
above<00:04:34.320> your<00:04:34.500> head<00:04:34.740> but<00:04:35.610> it's<00:04:35.760> still<00:04:35.970> easier<00:04:36.510> to

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
above your head but it's still easier to

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.390 
above your head but it's still easier to
stretch<00:04:37.200> the<00:04:37.410> cover<00:04:38.150> over<00:04:39.150> the<00:04:39.420> rails<00:04:39.720> and

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 
stretch the cover over the rails and

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.610 
stretch the cover over the rails and
attach<00:04:41.400> all<00:04:41.880> of<00:04:42.210> the<00:04:42.330> appropriate<00:04:42.600> straps<00:04:43.290> and

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
attach all of the appropriate straps and

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.670 
attach all of the appropriate straps and
then<00:04:43.850> Ratchet<00:04:44.850> it<00:04:44.940> tight<00:04:45.210> if<00:04:46.140> you're<00:04:46.380> going<00:04:46.560> to

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
then Ratchet it tight if you're going to

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.650 
then Ratchet it tight if you're going to
trail<00:04:47.010> with<00:04:47.250> this<00:04:47.430> cover<00:04:47.730> you<00:04:48.240> want<00:04:48.450> to<00:04:48.540> make

on both sides of the boat making sure
that<00:05:38.520> the<00:05:38.910> straps<00:05:39.210> are<00:05:39.360> very<00:05:40.200> tight<00:05:41.210> now<00:05:42.210> if

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:42.300 
that the straps are very tight now if

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:43.640 
that the straps are very tight now if
you<00:05:42.419> look<00:05:42.570> up<00:05:42.750> at<00:05:42.900> the<00:05:42.990> top<00:05:43.200> of<00:05:43.260> the<00:05:43.470> boat

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:43.650 
you look up at the top of the boat

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:46.070 
you look up at the top of the boat
you'll<00:05:43.919> see<00:05:44.160> where<00:05:44.340> the<00:05:44.430> tent<00:05:44.640> poles<00:05:44.940> are<00:05:45.240> it's

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 
you'll see where the tent poles are it's

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.190 
you'll see where the tent poles are it's
actually<00:05:46.400> supporting<00:05:47.400> the<00:05:47.550> cover<00:05:47.820> above<00:05:48.810> the

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:49.200 
actually supporting the cover above the

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.650 
actually supporting the cover above the
top<00:05:49.740> of<00:05:49.919> the<00:05:50.010> boat<00:05:50.220> so<00:05:50.880> that<00:05:51.090> when<00:05:51.240> it<00:05:51.360> rains

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:51.660 
top of the boat so that when it rains

00:05:51.660 --> 00:06:11.899 
top of the boat so that when it rains
the<00:05:52.169> water<00:05:52.500> will<00:05:53.190> drain<00:05:53.940> off<00:05:54.360> of<00:05:54.390> it

00:06:11.899 --> 00:06:11.909 

00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:14.189 

again<00:06:12.909> you<00:06:13.090> want<00:06:13.180> to<00:06:13.300> make<00:06:13.449> sure<00:06:13.479> this<00:06:13.810> is<00:06:14.020> good

00:06:14.189 --> 00:06:14.199 
again you want to make sure this is good

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:26.119 
again you want to make sure this is good
and<00:06:14.289> tight<00:06:14.529> that<00:06:19.080> way<00:06:20.080> it<00:06:20.259> is<00:06:20.289> a<00:06:20.439> towable<00:06:21.069> cover

00:06:26.119 --> 00:06:26.129 

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:28.679 

the<00:06:27.129> last<00:06:27.370> step<00:06:27.669> would<00:06:27.879> be<00:06:27.939> to<00:06:28.060> take<00:06:28.330> the<00:06:28.509> two

00:06:28.679 --> 00:06:28.689 
the last step would be to take the two

00:06:28.689 --> 00:06:31.200 
the last step would be to take the two
straps<00:06:29.050> in<00:06:29.289> the<00:06:29.319> back<00:06:29.409> and<00:06:30.029> run<00:06:31.029> them<00:06:31.180> down

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:31.210 
straps in the back and run them down

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:34.320 
straps in the back and run them down
through<00:06:31.810> your<00:06:31.840> rear<00:06:32.319> eyes<00:06:32.909> again<00:06:33.909> this<00:06:34.060> adds

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:34.330 
through your rear eyes again this adds

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:35.879 
through your rear eyes again this adds
just<00:06:34.599> a<00:06:34.749> little<00:06:34.990> bit<00:06:35.110> more<00:06:35.319> attention<00:06:35.409> and

00:06:35.879 --> 00:06:35.889 
just a little bit more attention and

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:38.249 
just a little bit more attention and
makes<00:06:36.699> the<00:06:36.849> cover<00:06:37.090> a<00:06:37.389> little<00:06:37.810> more<00:06:37.960> stable

00:06:38.249 --> 00:06:38.259 
makes the cover a little more stable

00:06:38.259 --> 00:06:41.670 
makes the cover a little more stable
when<00:06:38.860> you're<00:06:39.009> towing<00:06:39.249> it<00:06:40.259> now<00:06:41.259> Matt<00:06:41.499> will

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:41.680 
when you're towing it now Matt will

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.860 
when you're towing it now Matt will
demonstrate<00:06:42.069> the<00:06:42.610> tightness<00:06:43.060> of<00:06:43.270> this<00:06:43.629> by

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:43.870 
demonstrate the tightness of this by

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:46.920 
demonstrate the tightness of this by
grasping<00:06:44.800> one<00:06:45.009> of<00:06:45.159> the<00:06:45.249> edges<00:06:45.669> and<00:06:45.930> snapping

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:46.930 
grasping one of the edges and snapping

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:49.739 
grasping one of the edges and snapping
it<00:06:47.520> you<00:06:48.520> want<00:06:48.669> to<00:06:48.729> make<00:06:48.849> sure<00:06:48.879> you<00:06:49.210> have<00:06:49.479> plenty

00:06:49.739 --> 00:06:49.749 
it you want to make sure you have plenty

00:06:49.749 --> 00:06:53.700 
it you want to make sure you have plenty
of<00:06:49.990> tightness<00:06:50.289> on<00:06:50.650> there<00:06:51.539> in<00:06:52.539> that<00:06:53.020> case<00:06:53.349> we're

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:53.710 
of tightness on there in that case we're

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:55.110 
of tightness on there in that case we're
going<00:06:53.860> to<00:06:53.919> have<00:06:54.099> to<00:06:54.219> tighten<00:06:54.460> just<00:06:54.759> a<00:06:54.879> little

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:55.120 
going to have to tighten just a little

00:06:55.120 --> 00:07:01.739 
going to have to tighten just a little
bit<00:06:55.240> more<00:06:59.219> this<00:07:00.219> is<00:07:00.339> very<00:07:00.639> critical<00:07:00.909> to<00:07:01.539> keep

00:07:01.739 --> 00:07:01.749 
bit more this is very critical to keep
