00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.620 
once again that the color palette is the
same<00:01:51.140> and<00:01:51.410> it's<00:01:52.040> the<00:01:52.160> same<00:01:52.490> level<00:01:53.240> of

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
same and it's the same level of

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.580 
same and it's the same level of
technology<00:01:54.140> that<00:01:54.650> we<00:01:55.160> have<00:01:55.310> in<00:01:55.340> cath<00:01:55.610> lab<00:01:55.790> one

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
technology that we have in cath lab one

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.530 
technology that we have in cath lab one
we<00:01:57.590> enlarged<00:01:57.920> this<00:01:58.190> room<00:01:58.400> as<00:01:58.580> a<00:01:58.910> function<00:01:59.450> of

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
we enlarged this room as a function of

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.810 
we enlarged this room as a function of
putting<00:01:59.780> in<00:01:59.870> the<00:01:59.960> new<00:02:00.080> cath<00:02:00.320> lab<00:02:00.590> so<00:02:01.400> that<00:02:01.640> we

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
putting in the new cath lab so that we

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.540 
putting in the new cath lab so that we
have<00:02:02.090> more<00:02:02.990> room<00:02:03.590> and<00:02:03.800> also<00:02:03.920> more<00:02:04.370> room<00:02:04.520> for

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:04.550 
have more room and also more room for

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.229 
have more room and also more room for
storage<00:02:05.000> but<00:02:05.150> also<00:02:05.180> back<00:02:05.780> in<00:02:05.810> here<00:02:06.200> is<00:02:06.320> our

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:07.239 
storage but also back in here is our

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:10.120 
storage but also back in here is our
inventory<00:02:08.239> room<00:02:08.479> and<00:02:08.750> this<00:02:09.229> has<00:02:09.440> head<00:02:09.619> there's

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
inventory room and this has head there's

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.550 
inventory room and this has head there's
access<00:02:10.580> to<00:02:10.729> this<00:02:10.820> room<00:02:11.060> from<00:02:11.330> lab<00:02:11.540> to<00:02:11.870> and<00:02:12.140> from

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
access to this room from lab to and from

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.040 
access to this room from lab to and from
lab<00:02:12.800> 1<00:02:13.150> so<00:02:14.150> we<00:02:14.270> don't<00:02:14.300> have<00:02:14.540> to<00:02:14.630> be<00:02:14.690> running

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
lab 1 so we don't have to be running

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.110 
lab 1 so we don't have to be running
on<00:02:15.080> the<00:02:15.200> cath<00:02:15.410> lab<00:02:15.440> we<00:02:15.710> are<00:02:15.740> very<00:02:15.980> close<00:02:16.610> access

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
on the cath lab we are very close access

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.840 
on the cath lab we are very close access
to<00:02:17.300> getting<00:02:17.720> new<00:02:17.990> catheters<00:02:18.530> new<00:02:18.710> stands<00:02:19.640> and

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
to getting new catheters new stands and

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.030 
to getting new catheters new stands and
things<00:02:19.940> like<00:02:20.120> that<00:02:20.180> so<00:02:20.570> all<00:02:21.320> three<00:02:21.590> labs<00:02:21.830> are

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
things like that so all three labs are

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.130 
things like that so all three labs are
set<00:02:22.220> up<00:02:22.310> in<00:02:22.430> such<00:02:22.580> a<00:02:22.610> way<00:02:22.850> that<00:02:22.880> the<00:02:23.630> technical

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
set up in such a way that the technical

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.840 
set up in such a way that the technical
staff<00:02:24.320> and<00:02:24.560> the<00:02:24.650> doctors<00:02:24.680> can<00:02:25.580> work

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
staff and the doctors can work

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.820 
staff and the doctors can work
interchangeably<00:02:26.750> and<00:02:26.990> know<00:02:27.290> where<00:02:27.590> things

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
interchangeably and know where things

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.140 
interchangeably and know where things
are<00:02:28.070> and<00:02:28.520> how<00:02:28.970> they<00:02:29.150> operate<00:02:29.980> and<00:02:30.980> we<00:02:31.150> now

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
are and how they operate and we now

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.570 
are and how they operate and we now
enter<00:02:32.600> a<00:02:32.630> sort<00:02:33.350> of<00:02:33.410> a<00:02:33.470> common<00:02:33.890> area<00:02:34.100> here<00:02:34.460> where

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
enter a sort of a common area here where

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.300 
enter a sort of a common area here where
patients<00:02:35.030> are<00:02:35.120> brought<00:02:35.540> into<00:02:36.230> the<00:02:37.010> cath<00:02:37.280> lab

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
patients are brought into the cath lab

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.890 
as part of the whole remodeling of this
area<00:03:23.540> we<00:03:23.720> wanted<00:03:24.080> to<00:03:24.170> redo<00:03:24.590> the<00:03:25.220> waiting<00:03:25.550> room

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
area we wanted to redo the waiting room

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.690 
area we wanted to redo the waiting room
and<00:03:26.900> this<00:03:27.050> is<00:03:27.200> where<00:03:27.350> families<00:03:28.010> stay<00:03:28.040> while

and this is where families stay while

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.760 
and this is where families stay while
we're<00:03:28.880> doing<00:03:28.970> the<00:03:29.150> procedures<00:03:29.770> typically

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:30.770 
we're doing the procedures typically

we're doing the procedures typically
these<00:03:30.890> procedures<00:03:31.370> do<00:03:31.489> not<00:03:31.520> take<00:03:31.820> a<00:03:31.850> long<00:03:32.090> time

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:32.300 
these procedures do not take a long time

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.900 
these procedures do not take a long time
and<00:03:32.570> most<00:03:33.080> commonly<00:03:33.650> we<00:03:34.070> only<00:03:34.220> have<00:03:34.430> one<00:03:34.670> going

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
and most commonly we only have one going

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.270 
and most commonly we only have one going
at<00:03:35.120> a<00:03:35.300> particular<00:03:35.690> moment<00:03:35.989> so<00:03:36.709> the<00:03:36.920> families
