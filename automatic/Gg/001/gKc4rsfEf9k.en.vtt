running<00:01:02.370> around<00:01:02.760> I<00:01:02.969> mean<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.359> bunch<00:01:03.840> of

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
running around I mean a bunch of

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.950 
running around I mean a bunch of
teenagers<00:01:04.439> and<00:01:05.479> Starfire's<00:01:06.479> like

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
teenagers and Starfire's like

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.530 
teenagers and Starfire's like
emotionally<00:01:07.890> disturbed<00:01:08.670> kind<00:01:09.450> of

emotionally disturbed kind of

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.450 
emotionally disturbed kind of
unavailable<00:01:10.080> but<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.380> highly<00:01:10.710> destructive<00:01:11.040> I

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
unavailable but the highly destructive I

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.830 
unavailable but the highly destructive I
don't<00:01:12.030> think<00:01:12.180> they<00:01:12.299> should<00:01:12.330> be<00:01:12.630> running

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
don't think they should be running

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.240 
don't think they should be running
around<00:01:13.020> Gotham<00:01:13.350> it's<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:13.799> pretty<00:01:13.979> dangerous

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
around Gotham it's a pretty dangerous

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.969 
around Gotham it's a pretty dangerous
place<00:01:14.549> I<00:01:15.090> mean<00:01:15.780> these<00:01:15.900> kids<00:01:16.110> need<00:01:16.350> a<00:01:16.409> chaperone

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
place I mean these kids need a chaperone

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.230 
place I mean these kids need a chaperone
so<00:01:17.400> that<00:01:17.549> really<00:01:17.640> could<00:01:17.790> make<00:01:17.939> more<00:01:18.090> of<00:01:18.150> a<00:01:18.210> mess

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
so that really could make more of a mess

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.080 
so that really could make more of a mess
then<00:01:18.780> they're<00:01:19.710> just<00:01:19.860> another<00:01:20.100> liability<00:01:20.759> for

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
then they're just another liability for

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.780 
then they're just another liability for
Batman<00:01:21.420> yeah<00:01:21.840> but<00:01:22.439> I<00:01:22.470> definitely<00:01:23.400> think<00:01:23.610> it's

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
Batman yeah but I definitely think it's

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.390 
Batman yeah but I definitely think it's
good<00:01:24.030> that<00:01:24.380> Arsenal<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.470> Starfire<00:01:25.950> showed<00:01:26.250> up

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400
