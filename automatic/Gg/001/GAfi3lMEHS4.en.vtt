tutorial for eyeballs this design is

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.950 
tutorial for eyeballs this design is
stitched<00:00:05.130> in<00:00:05.370> two<00:00:05.730> different<00:00:05.940> ways<00:00:06.210> you<00:00:06.569> can

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
stitched in two different ways you can

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.560 
stitched in two different ways you can
first<00:00:07.440> stitch<00:00:07.710> a<00:00:07.919> big<00:00:08.250> circle<00:00:08.519> then<00:00:09.179> go<00:00:09.389> inside

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
first stitch a big circle then go inside

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.930 
first stitch a big circle then go inside
of<00:00:09.809> that<00:00:10.050> big<00:00:10.290> circle<00:00:10.740> with<00:00:11.040> a<00:00:11.070> little<00:00:11.370> spiral

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
of that big circle with a little spiral

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.660 
of that big circle with a little spiral
and<00:00:12.179> then<00:00:12.990> fill<00:00:13.230> that<00:00:13.469> little<00:00:13.740> spiral<00:00:14.160> with<00:00:14.639> a

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
and then fill that little spiral with a

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.849 
and then fill that little spiral with a
spiral<00:00:15.450> sorry<00:00:15.929> a<00:00:16.080> little<00:00:16.289> circle<00:00:16.680> with<00:00:16.830> a

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
spiral sorry a little circle with a

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.630 
spiral sorry a little circle with a
spiral<00:00:17.310> or<00:00:18.260> you<00:00:19.260> can<00:00:19.529> start<00:00:19.920> with<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.340> smaller

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
spiral or you can start with the smaller

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.630 
spiral or you can start with the smaller
circle<00:00:21.210> first<00:00:21.710> go<00:00:22.710> inside<00:00:22.890> and<00:00:23.250> fill<00:00:23.460> that

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
circle first go inside and fill that

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.720 
circle first go inside and fill that
with<00:00:23.820> a<00:00:23.880> spiral<00:00:24.359> and<00:00:24.980> then<00:00:25.980> come<00:00:26.279> all<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.699> way

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
with a spiral and then come all the way

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.359 
with a spiral and then come all the way
back<00:00:26.820> out<00:00:27.240> and<00:00:27.630> surround<00:00:28.529> that<00:00:28.740> with<00:00:28.859> a<00:00:29.099> bigger

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
back out and surround that with a bigger

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.970 
back out and surround that with a bigger
circle<00:00:29.699> and<00:00:30.539> I<00:00:30.750> think<00:00:31.170> of<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.500> two<00:00:31.710> different

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
circle and I think of the two different

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.799 
circle and I think of the two different
ways<00:00:32.160> that<00:00:32.399> you<00:00:32.430> can<00:00:32.730> create<00:00:32.910> this<00:00:33.210> design<00:00:33.600> I

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
ways that you can create this design I

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.040 
ways that you can create this design I
really<00:00:34.380> prefer<00:00:34.940> the<00:00:35.940> first<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.630> second<00:00:36.960> way

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
really prefer the first the second way

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.990 
really prefer the first the second way
because<00:00:37.620> I<00:00:37.860> think<00:00:37.920> creating<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.700> smaller

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
because I think creating the smaller

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.299 
because I think creating the smaller
circle<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.899> spiral<00:00:40.350> is<00:00:40.530> actually<00:00:40.920> easier

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
circle and the spiral is actually easier

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.580 
circle and the spiral is actually easier
because<00:00:42.210> there's<00:00:43.020> a<00:00:43.079> little<00:00:43.230> bit<00:00:43.410> less

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
because there's a little bit less

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.920 
because there's a little bit less
estimation<00:00:44.430> of<00:00:44.520> space<00:00:44.820> sometimes<00:00:45.629> we<00:00:45.780> can

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
estimation of space sometimes we can

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.690 
estimation of space sometimes we can
stitch<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.440> big<00:00:46.649> circle<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:47.250> we<00:00:47.309> think<00:00:47.489> that's

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
stitch a big circle and we think that's

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.729 
stitch a big circle and we think that's
going<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:47.940> be<00:00:48.120> big<00:00:48.329> enough<00:00:48.480> to<00:00:48.840> such<00:00:49.500> the

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
going to be big enough to such the

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.130 
going to be big enough to such the
second<00:00:50.160> smaller<00:00:50.430> circle<00:00:50.820> within<00:00:50.969> it<00:00:51.270> when<00:00:52.020> in

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
second smaller circle within it when in

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.720 
second smaller circle within it when in
fact<00:00:52.170> actually<00:00:52.680> it's<00:00:52.829> not<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.370> then<00:00:53.460> you<00:00:53.520> end

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
fact actually it's not and then you end

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.729 
fact actually it's not and then you end
up<00:00:53.879> stitching<00:00:54.719> some<00:00:54.899> really<00:00:55.170> small<00:00:55.350> circles

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
up stitching some really small circles

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.520 
up stitching some really small circles
and<00:00:55.860> it's<00:00:55.949> just<00:00:56.129> really<00:00:56.309> annoying<00:00:56.520> so<00:00:57.360> I<00:00:57.600> would

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
and it's just really annoying so I would

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.700 
and it's just really annoying so I would
say<00:00:58.680> start<00:00:59.129> with<00:00:59.340> a<00:00:59.370> smaller<00:00:59.670> circle<00:01:00.000> first

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
say start with a smaller circle first

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.160 
say start with a smaller circle first
put<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.800> spiral<00:01:02.219> on<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.489> inside<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.210> then

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
put the spiral on the inside and then

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.050 
put the spiral on the inside and then
surround<00:01:04.710> that<00:01:04.799> with<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:05.100> bigger<00:01:05.339> circle<00:01:05.909> and

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
surround that with a bigger circle and

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.969 
surround that with a bigger circle and
just<00:01:06.420> see<00:01:06.570> how<00:01:06.600> that<00:01:06.930> feels<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.500> you<00:01:07.530> try<00:01:07.920> it

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
just see how that feels to you try it

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.370 
just see how that feels to you try it
both<00:01:08.159> ways<00:01:08.400> really<00:01:09.030> this<00:01:09.689> is<00:01:09.869> kind<00:01:10.140> of<00:01:10.260> a

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
both ways really this is kind of a

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.890 
both ways really this is kind of a
combination<00:01:10.590> of<00:01:11.360> double<00:01:12.360> pebble<00:01:12.750> and

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
combination of double pebble and

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.740 
combination of double pebble and
escargot<00:01:13.710> two<00:01:14.340> of<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.700> early<00:01:15.150> stacking

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
escargot two of the early stacking

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.240 
escargot two of the early stacking
designs<00:01:16.049> from<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.770> beginning<00:01:17.100> of<00:01:17.189> the

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
designs from the beginning of the

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.359 
designs from the beginning of the
project<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.939> I<00:01:18.509> really<00:01:19.110> enjoy<00:01:19.470> combining<00:01:20.009> the

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
project and I really enjoy combining the

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.179 
project and I really enjoy combining the
two<00:01:20.580> to<00:01:20.909> create<00:01:21.240> this<00:01:21.479> eyeballs<00:01:21.990> design<00:01:22.500> it's

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
two to create this eyeballs design it's

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.130 
two to create this eyeballs design it's
kind<00:01:23.490> of<00:01:23.549> creepy<00:01:23.850> looking<00:01:24.360> whenever<00:01:24.720> you<00:01:24.930> see

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
kind of creepy looking whenever you see

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.010 
kind of creepy looking whenever you see
the<00:01:25.320> texture<00:01:25.759> stitched<00:01:26.759> out<00:01:27.030> over<00:01:27.479> a<00:01:27.509> larger

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
the texture stitched out over a larger

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.330 
the texture stitched out over a larger
area<00:01:28.049> of<00:01:28.380> your<00:01:28.470> quote<00:01:28.740> as<00:01:28.890> you<00:01:29.009> can<00:01:29.159> see<00:01:29.310> right

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
area of your quote as you can see right

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.390 
area of your quote as you can see right
here<00:01:29.759> well<00:01:30.450> especially<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.170> title<00:01:31.650> um<00:01:31.799> James

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
here well especially the title um James

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.700 
here well especially the title um James
came<00:01:32.790> up<00:01:32.939> with<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.240> title<00:01:33.420> because<00:01:33.810> he<00:01:34.350> never

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
came up with the title because he never

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.370 
came up with the title because he never
says<00:01:35.130> just<00:01:35.670> I<00:01:35.880> you<00:01:36.570> know<00:01:36.689> I've<00:01:36.900> got<00:01:37.049> something

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
says just I you know I've got something

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.740 
says just I you know I've got something
in<00:01:37.470> my<00:01:37.560> eye<00:01:37.590> he<00:01:37.979> always<00:01:38.250> says<00:01:38.430> my<00:01:39.119> eyeballs

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
in my eye he always says my eyeballs

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.819 
in my eye he always says my eyeballs
hurt<00:01:40.259> which<00:01:41.100> is<00:01:41.280> so<00:01:41.610> funny<00:01:42.140> so<00:01:43.140> I<00:01:43.170> had<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:43.680> name

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
hurt which is so funny so I had to name

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.830 
hurt which is so funny so I had to name
a<00:01:43.890> design<00:01:44.280> after<00:01:44.640> that<00:01:44.820> and<00:01:45.060> this<00:01:45.659> is

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
a design after that and this is

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.440 
a design after that and this is
absolutely<00:01:46.350> perfect<00:01:46.470> for<00:01:46.770> it<00:01:47.420> something<00:01:48.420> that

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
absolutely perfect for it something that

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.170 
absolutely perfect for it something that
I<00:01:48.899> get<00:01:49.409> a<00:01:49.439> lot<00:01:49.619> of<00:01:49.649> questions<00:01:50.040> about<00:01:50.220> is<00:01:50.759> what

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
I get a lot of questions about is what

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.050 
I get a lot of questions about is what
