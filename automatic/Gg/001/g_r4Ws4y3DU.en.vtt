a<00:00:43.559> suppliant<00:00:43.920> spot<00:00:47.030> so<00:00:48.030> once<00:00:48.210> you<00:00:48.329> take<00:00:48.480> that

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
a suppliant spot so once you take that

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.690 
a suppliant spot so once you take that
down<00:00:48.960> you're<00:00:49.200> only<00:00:49.350> left<00:00:49.649> with<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.100> archer

towers and the mission objective which

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.170 
towers and the mission objective which
is<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.980> take<00:00:53.309> down

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.180 
is to take down

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:01.209 
is to take down
so<00:00:56.079> on<00:00:56.199> the<00:00:56.289> middle<00:00:57.870> use<00:00:58.870> those<00:00:59.050> extra<00:00:59.260> ramps

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:01.219

brought some Sammy rising too quickly to

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.100 
brought some Sammy rising too quickly to
some<00:01:08.540> dangers<00:01:08.960> to<00:01:09.170> quickly<00:01:09.380> look<00:01:09.740> those

it's a very small amount

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.380 
it's a very small amount
it<00:01:26.680> doesn't<00:01:27.580> really<00:01:27.760> matter<00:01:28.000> if<00:01:28.210> you<00:01:28.270> don't
