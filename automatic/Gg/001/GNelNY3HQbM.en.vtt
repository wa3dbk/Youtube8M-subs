00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
all right so some folks had some

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:05.480 
all right so some folks had some
interest<00:00:03.300> in<00:00:03.449> the<00:00:03.600> LED<00:00:03.929> lighting<00:00:04.140> on<00:00:04.470> my<00:00:04.620> 2015

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
interest in the LED lighting on my 2015

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.919 
interest in the LED lighting on my 2015
WX<00:00:06.950> so<00:00:07.950> we're<00:00:08.130> gonna<00:00:08.220> start<00:00:08.610> with<00:00:08.670> the<00:00:08.929> turn

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
WX so we're gonna start with the turn

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.209 
WX so we're gonna start with the turn
signals<00:00:10.410> these<00:00:11.130> are<00:00:11.280> V<00:00:11.790> LEDs<00:00:12.000> v3<00:00:12.900> Triton's<00:00:13.469> I

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
signals these are V LEDs v3 Triton's I

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.849 
signals these are V LEDs v3 Triton's I
have<00:00:14.730> on<00:00:14.880> all<00:00:15.059> four<00:00:15.240> corners<00:00:15.509> and<00:00:15.870> I've<00:00:16.740> also

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
have on all four corners and I've also

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.310 
have on all four corners and I've also
got<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.130> tap<00:00:17.310> turn<00:00:17.520> module<00:00:17.970> which<00:00:18.570> gives<00:00:19.230> you

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
got the tap turn module which gives you

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.560 
got the tap turn module which gives you
a<00:00:19.350> couple<00:00:19.560> of<00:00:19.740> benefits<00:00:20.119> obviously<00:00:21.119> it<00:00:21.449> makes

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
a couple of benefits obviously it makes

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.290 
a couple of benefits obviously it makes
the<00:00:21.720> LEDs<00:00:22.020> work<00:00:22.289> without<00:00:23.130> hyper<00:00:23.880> blink<00:00:24.210> or

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
the LEDs work without hyper blink or

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.970 
the LEDs work without hyper blink or
anything<00:00:24.449> like<00:00:24.600> that<00:00:24.689> and<00:00:24.990> also<00:00:25.650> brings<00:00:25.830> you<00:00:25.920> a

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
anything like that and also brings you a

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.980 
anything like that and also brings you a
lot<00:00:26.010> of<00:00:26.189> extra<00:00:26.400> features<00:00:26.599> so<00:00:27.599> right<00:00:27.810> now<00:00:27.930> the

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
lot of extra features so right now the

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.410 
lot of extra features so right now the
car<00:00:28.199> is<00:00:28.230> not<00:00:28.410> running<00:00:28.650> and<00:00:29.130> we're<00:00:30.029> gonna<00:00:30.119> do<00:00:30.330> is

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
car is not running and we're gonna do is

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.939 
car is not running and we're gonna do is
we're<00:00:30.510> gonna<00:00:30.570> demonstrate<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:31.349> parking

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
we're gonna demonstrate the parking

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.130 
we're gonna demonstrate the parking
light<00:00:32.070> feature<00:00:32.340> so<00:00:33.120> we're<00:00:33.630> gonna<00:00:33.870> go<00:00:34.050> ahead

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
light feature so we're gonna go ahead

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.540 
light feature so we're gonna go ahead
and<00:00:34.260> if<00:00:34.380> you<00:00:34.469> turn<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.890> stock<00:00:35.130> one<00:00:35.340> way<00:00:35.460> or<00:00:35.520> the

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
and if you turn the stock one way or the

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.660 
and if you turn the stock one way or the
other<00:00:36.170> basically<00:00:37.170> you<00:00:37.739> can<00:00:37.890> have<00:00:38.070> one<00:00:38.460> light

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
other basically you can have one light

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.819 
other basically you can have one light
just<00:00:39.540> beyond<00:00:39.870> also<00:00:40.170> you<00:00:40.230> can<00:00:40.440> see<00:00:40.649> how

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
just beyond also you can see how

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.350 
just beyond also you can see how
incredibly<00:00:41.520> bright<00:00:41.730> these<00:00:41.910> things<00:00:42.149> actually

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
incredibly bright these things actually

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.340 
incredibly bright these things actually
are<00:00:42.860> so<00:00:43.860> if<00:00:43.950> we<00:00:44.040> go<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.250> stock<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.640> other<00:00:44.760> side

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
are so if we go the stock the other side

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.740 
are so if we go the stock the other side
basically<00:00:46.350> you<00:00:46.469> can<00:00:46.649> just<00:00:46.680> see<00:00:46.950> that<00:00:46.980> now<00:00:47.760> you

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
basically you can just see that now you

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.590 
basically you can just see that now you
have<00:00:49.110> this<00:00:49.230> parking<00:00:49.559> light<00:00:49.710> feature<00:00:49.950> so

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
have this parking light feature so

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.639 
have this parking light feature so
honestly<00:00:51.600> I<00:00:51.629> never<00:00:51.780> used<00:00:52.020> I<00:00:52.170> don't<00:00:52.320> ever<00:00:52.440> use

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
honestly I never used I don't ever use

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:53.569 
honestly I never used I don't ever use
this<00:00:52.800> but<00:00:53.039> I<00:00:53.070> suppose<00:00:53.309> it<00:00:53.430> could<00:00:53.550> be

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
this but I suppose it could be

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.340 
this but I suppose it could be
interesting<00:00:53.879> in<00:00:54.570> certain<00:00:54.870> situations

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
interesting in certain situations

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.709 
interesting in certain situations
they're<00:00:55.920> almost<00:00:56.309> too<00:00:56.760> bright<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.300> really<00:00:57.539> work

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
they're almost too bright to really work

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.939 
they're almost too bright to really work
as<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:57.899> as<00:00:58.710> parking<00:00:59.160> lights<00:00:59.539> so<00:01:00.539> anyway<00:01:00.949> we're

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
as a as parking lights so anyway we're

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.110 
as a as parking lights so anyway we're
going<00:01:02.070> to<00:01:02.190> disable<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.670> parking<00:01:02.969> light

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
going to disable the parking light

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.179 
going to disable the parking light
feature<00:01:03.300> now<00:01:03.570> and<00:01:03.899> turn<00:01:04.379> on<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.619> hazard<00:01:04.799> so

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
feature now and turn on the hazard so

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.380 
feature now and turn on the hazard so
you<00:01:05.250> can<00:01:05.430> kind<00:01:05.610> of<00:01:05.640> see<00:01:05.820> that<00:01:05.909> what<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.060> strobe

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
you can kind of see that what the strobe

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.440 
you can kind of see that what the strobe
feature<00:01:06.570> looks<00:01:06.930> like<00:01:07.080> with<00:01:07.260> a<00:01:07.290> tap<00:01:07.530> turn<00:01:08.450> there

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
feature looks like with a tap turn there

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.410 
feature looks like with a tap turn there
we<00:01:09.600> go<00:01:09.750> you<00:01:10.320> can<00:01:10.380> see<00:01:10.530> that<00:01:10.710> they<00:01:11.420> strobe

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
we go you can see that they strobe

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.000 
we go you can see that they strobe
pretty<00:01:12.990> well<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.380> strobe<00:01:13.560> feature<00:01:13.710> is<00:01:13.890> great

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
pretty well the strobe feature is great

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.340 
pretty well the strobe feature is great
for<00:01:14.280> LED<00:01:14.640> because<00:01:14.970> it's<00:01:15.150> hard<00:01:15.750> on<00:01:15.869> hard<00:01:16.170> off

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
for LED because it's hard on hard off

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.710 
for LED because it's hard on hard off
and<00:01:16.740> then<00:01:17.580> you<00:01:17.700> can<00:01:17.729> use<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.119> turning<00:01:18.450> stock

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
and then you can use the turning stock

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.130 
and then you can use the turning stock
to<00:01:19.220> basically<00:01:20.220> modify<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.270> functionality

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
to basically modify the functionality

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.490 
to basically modify the functionality
have<00:01:22.229> a<00:01:22.290> slow<00:01:23.090> there<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:24.479> if<00:01:25.200> you<00:01:25.290> go<00:01:25.380> the

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
have a slow there and if you go the

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.859 
have a slow there and if you go the
other<00:01:25.530> direction<00:01:25.979> you<00:01:26.189> have<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.369> wig<00:01:26.549> wag<00:01:26.869> just

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
other direction you have a wig wag just

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.679 
other direction you have a wig wag just
like<00:01:28.020> that<00:01:28.259> so<00:01:29.180> that's<00:01:30.180> actually<00:01:30.360> kind<00:01:30.659> of

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
like that so that's actually kind of

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.050 
like that so that's actually kind of
nice<00:01:30.869> I<00:01:31.380> think<00:01:31.770> that<00:01:32.009> brings<00:01:32.250> an<00:01:32.490> unbelievable

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
nice I think that brings an unbelievable

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.850 
nice I think that brings an unbelievable
amount<00:01:33.240> of<00:01:33.299> attention<00:01:33.600> I'm<00:01:34.350> gonna<00:01:34.530> come<00:01:34.740> back

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
amount of attention I'm gonna come back

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.039 
amount of attention I'm gonna come back
around<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.369> side<00:01:35.579> back<00:01:36.119> side<00:01:36.390> now<00:01:36.540> so<00:01:36.570> you<00:01:36.930> can

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
around the side back side now so you can

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.760 
around the side back side now so you can
kind<00:01:37.229> of<00:01:37.259> see<00:01:37.470> what<00:01:38.340> effect<00:01:38.640> that<00:01:38.700> has<00:01:39.619> you<00:01:40.619> can

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
kind of see what effect that has you can

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.350 
kind of see what effect that has you can
see<00:01:40.950> how<00:01:41.100> much<00:01:41.280> light<00:01:41.579> these<00:01:41.790> things<00:01:41.939> put<00:01:42.180> out

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
see how much light these things put out

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.660 
see how much light these things put out
these<00:01:42.960> are<00:01:43.200> some<00:01:43.560> of<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.680> few<00:01:43.979> LEDs<00:01:44.399> that<00:01:44.430> you

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
these are some of the few LEDs that you

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.240 
these are some of the few LEDs that you
can<00:01:44.790> actually<00:01:44.970> see<00:01:45.329> during<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:45.990> day

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:54.600 

so<00:01:48.780> that<00:01:49.780> looks<00:01:50.760> pretty<00:01:51.760> nice<00:01:53.070> so<00:01:54.070> we<00:01:54.190> can<00:01:54.520> go

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
so that looks pretty nice so we can go

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.270 
so that looks pretty nice so we can go
back<00:01:54.790> to<00:01:54.820> standard<00:01:55.420> hazards<00:01:55.930> now<00:01:56.080> and<00:01:56.380> kind<00:01:57.220> of

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
back to standard hazards now and kind of

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.390 
back to standard hazards now and kind of
see<00:01:57.370> in<00:01:57.460> the<00:01:57.550> back<00:01:57.730> what<00:01:58.600> effect<00:01:58.900> that<00:01:58.960> has

00:01:59.390 --> 00:01:59.400 
see in the back what effect that has

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.190 
see in the back what effect that has
that's<00:02:00.400> probably<00:02:00.730> enough<00:02:01.000> about<00:02:01.960> turn

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
that's probably enough about turn

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.680 
that's probably enough about turn
signals<00:02:02.560> at<00:02:02.680> this<00:02:03.130> point<00:02:03.340> so<00:02:03.580> it<00:02:04.240> can<00:02:04.390> turn<00:02:04.480> our

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690 
signals at this point so it can turn our

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.070 
signals at this point so it can turn our
hazards<00:02:05.080> off<00:02:05.230> and<00:02:06.570> let's<00:02:07.570> see<00:02:07.690> if<00:02:07.780> we<00:02:07.900> can

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
hazards off and let's see if we can

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.870 
hazards off and let's see if we can
while<00:02:09.040> we're<00:02:09.160> back<00:02:09.310> here<00:02:09.460> we<00:02:09.580> can<00:02:09.700> get<00:02:09.790> our

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
while we're back here we can get our

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.070 
while we're back here we can get our
reverse<00:02:10.210> lights<00:02:10.509> I<00:02:10.690> did<00:02:10.869> V<00:02:11.380> LEDs<00:02:11.940> reverse<00:02:13.080> LEDs

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
reverse lights I did V LEDs reverse LEDs

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.080 
reverse lights I did V LEDs reverse LEDs
I<00:02:14.440> can't<00:02:15.040> remember<00:02:15.160> the<00:02:15.340> specific<00:02:15.760> model

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
I can't remember the specific model

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.770 
I can't remember the specific model
number<00:02:16.390> but<00:02:17.250> we<00:02:18.250> can<00:02:18.490> get<00:02:19.120> that<00:02:19.270> going<00:02:19.330> here

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
number but we can get that going here

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:27.050 
number but we can get that going here
just<00:02:20.140> a<00:02:20.230> second<00:02:20.590> the<00:02:21.550> reverse<00:02:21.880> LED<00:02:22.480> lights

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.620 

there<00:02:28.060> we<00:02:28.209> go<00:02:29.190> there<00:02:30.190> we<00:02:30.310> go<00:02:30.340> so<00:02:31.120> you<00:02:31.150> can<00:02:31.270> see

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
there we go there we go so you can see

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:37.170 
there we go there we go so you can see
how<00:02:32.410> much<00:02:32.650> light<00:02:32.950> these<00:02:33.190> things<00:02:33.459> put<00:02:33.700> out<00:02:36.180> all

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
how much light these things put out all

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.600 
how much light these things put out all
the<00:02:37.360> way<00:02:37.480> back<00:02:37.690> here<00:02:38.110> they're<00:02:38.950> very<00:02:39.280> very<00:02:39.459> very

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
the way back here they're very very very

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.210 
the way back here they're very very very
bright<00:02:40.200> they're<00:02:41.200> about<00:02:41.350> 40<00:02:41.709> bucks<00:02:41.860> it's<00:02:42.160> a

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
bright they're about 40 bucks it's a

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.920 
bright they're about 40 bucks it's a
little<00:02:42.430> ridiculous<00:02:42.790> but<00:02:43.240> they're<00:02:43.720> the

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
little ridiculous but they're the

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.150 
little ridiculous but they're the
brightest<00:02:44.260> I've<00:02:44.380> seen<00:02:44.650> and<00:02:44.920> they're<00:02:45.010> also

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
brightest I've seen and they're also

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.090 
brightest I've seen and they're also
really<00:02:45.430> really<00:02:45.730> clean<00:02:46.560> alright<00:02:47.560> so<00:02:47.800> let's<00:02:47.980> go

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
really really clean alright so let's go

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.560 
really really clean alright so let's go
ahead<00:02:48.130> and<00:02:48.340> turn<00:02:48.610> off<00:02:48.820> the<00:02:48.970> reverse<00:02:49.120> lights

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
ahead and turn off the reverse lights

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.430 
ahead and turn off the reverse lights
and<00:02:49.930> let's<00:02:50.680> look<00:02:50.830> at<00:02:50.980> the<00:02:51.070> headlights
