00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
caught some fast on these at cranes

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.290 
caught some fast on these at cranes
roost<00:02:23.740> to<00:02:24.100> which<00:02:24.430> I<00:02:24.550> really<00:02:24.700> recommend<00:02:24.910> to<00:02:25.270> go

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
roost to which I really recommend to go

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.020 
roost to which I really recommend to go
there<00:02:26.040> because<00:02:27.040> there's<00:02:27.340> some<00:02:27.490> good<00:02:27.820> fish

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
there because there's some good fish

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.670 
there because there's some good fish
there<00:02:28.770> so<00:02:29.770> that's<00:02:30.250> really<00:02:30.640> that<00:02:30.970> and<00:02:31.780> then

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
there so that's really that and then

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.780 
there so that's really that and then
these<00:02:33.010> are<00:02:33.420> swamped<00:02:34.420> crawler<00:02:34.720> junebugs<00:02:35.790> they

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
these are swamped crawler junebugs they

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.850 
these are swamped crawler junebugs they
look<00:02:37.420> like<00:02:37.570> finesse<00:02:37.900> they<00:02:38.200> look<00:02:38.380> like<00:02:38.410> trick

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
look like finesse they look like trick

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.780 
look like finesse they look like trick
worms<00:02:39.070> but<00:02:39.489> they're<00:02:39.880> just<00:02:40.050> thinner<00:02:41.050> and

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
worms but they're just thinner and

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.900 
worms but they're just thinner and
they're<00:02:42.790> pretty<00:02:43.690> long<00:02:43.959> they're<00:02:44.890> really<00:02:45.250> not

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
they're pretty long they're really not

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.970 
they're pretty long they're really not
that<00:02:46.090> hard<00:02:46.300> II<00:02:46.510> but<00:02:46.840> good<00:02:47.410> for<00:02:47.970> fish<00:02:48.970> who<00:02:49.270> just

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
that hard II but good for fish who just

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.150 
that hard II but good for fish who just
fish<00:02:50.980> you<00:02:51.100> want<00:02:51.220> smaller<00:02:51.550> meal<00:02:51.850> I<00:02:52.030> guess<00:02:53.160> so

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
fish you want smaller meal I guess so

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.560
