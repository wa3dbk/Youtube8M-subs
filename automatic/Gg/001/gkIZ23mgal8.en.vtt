00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
about 16 16 years 60 days is there's a

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.120 
about 16 16 years 60 days is there's a
couple<00:02:11.840> of<00:02:12.019> floods<00:02:12.260> in<00:02:12.410> the<00:02:12.440> mid<00:02:12.620> nineties<00:02:12.980> so

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
couple of floods in the mid nineties so

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.039 
couple of floods in the mid nineties so
we're<00:02:13.280> not<00:02:13.340> sure<00:02:13.549> exactly<00:02:13.940> which<00:02:14.239> one<00:02:14.480> yeah

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:15.049 
we're not sure exactly which one yeah

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:18.009 
we're not sure exactly which one yeah
roughly<00:02:15.470> 94<00:02:16.010> 95<00:02:16.430> they<00:02:17.269> just<00:02:17.510> said<00:02:17.660> that<00:02:17.690> you

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:18.019 
roughly 94 95 they just said that you

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:21.819 
roughly 94 95 they just said that you
did<00:02:18.170> a<00:02:18.200> small<00:02:18.470> titled<00:02:18.950> a<00:02:19.959> the<00:02:20.959> brings<00:02:21.230> water<00:02:21.410> in

that's<00:02:30.260> one<00:02:30.410> of<00:02:30.470> the<00:02:30.560> amazing<00:02:30.769> things<00:02:31.010> about

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:31.359 
that's one of the amazing things about

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:34.210 
that's one of the amazing things about
about<00:02:32.359> bull<00:02:32.600> sharks<00:02:33.049> is<00:02:33.680> that<00:02:33.950> they<00:02:34.040> can

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
about bull sharks is that they can
