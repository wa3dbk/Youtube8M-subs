00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:11.920
 Ramat Hanadiv is a vivid memory of Baron Benjamin Edmond de Rothschild and continues his vision. 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:21.700
 For more than half a century, there has been activity for the public in Israel, which is manifested, inter alia, in the preservation of natural and cultural values. 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:32.320
 The two faces of Ramat Hanadiv, the man-made man-made gardens, on the one hand, and the nature park acquires wildlife on the other, meet at the visitors' center. 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:43.460
 Architect Ada Karmi Melamed, designed the building as a green, circular wall that surrounds the entrance to the memorial gardens to the Baron and his departure. 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:54.900
 Two axes perpendicular to each other cross the building, a axis of light that runs from east to west and creates a symbolic barrier between the memorial gardens and the nature park. 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:04.880
 And a physical walking axis, connecting from north to south the heart of the gardens to the starting point for the paths of the nature walk through the center of the visitors' heart. 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:21.960
 As part of Ramat Hanadiv's many years of activity in the fields of environment and sustainability, the building of the Visitor Center has provided an opportunity to implement these principles in a structure that will take into account the environment, merge with it and have minimal impact on it. 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:30.140
 All these earned the Visitors Center an outstanding green building standard from the Standards Institute and the Ministry of the Environment. 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:44.740
 How things are implemented, the axis of light composed of windows installed on the roof saves about 30 percent of the lighting costs and allows to enjoy the sunlight in a building that is an underground pit. 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:54.520
 The roof of the building is covered with soil and vegetation, creating a layer of insulation and connecting the visitors' center to the surrounding area. 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:05.100
 Landscape architect Amir Blum planned a faÃ§ade of cultural plants that faces the memorial garden and a local vegetation front facing the natural park. 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:12.920
 A biothermic cooling system utilizes the soil temperature to merge the internal spaces. 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:22.020
 The local soil was scattered on the roof and rocks were incorporated in gardening and construction debris was crushed and used as a filler for infrastructure 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:36.080
 A great effort has been invested in protecting mature trees and their integration into the structure. The visitors center of Ramat Hanadiv is a vibrant and vibrant center of educational activity and a stage for exploration in the nature park. 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:47.840
 National and international conferences take place there, and students in a wide range of in-depth research on ecology. 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:56.300
 In the western part of the building lies the foot garden that invites a discourse on the footprint of the ecological foot. 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:04.540
 It is a butterfly-attracting garden cultivated by gardeners with special needs. 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.380
 The younger generation is invited to a playground made of natural materials. 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:22.780
 The Visitors Center at Ramat Hanadiv is another slaughterhouse in preserving the interrelationships between nature, nature and the environment.
