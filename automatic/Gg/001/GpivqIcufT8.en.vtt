00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 we always see the theme of an evening 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:08.099
 special though this time with hair 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.110
 doctor, let's try the ridge that 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.809
 all of you always try to 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.030
 do it at home 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:17.369
 I will try to give you advice to make it a 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.520
 at best combed hair 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.520
 backwards 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:26.160
 we take all the central part and how 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.880
 did you see before we went to 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.859
 crown this time the length 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.780
 different then start right from the 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:38.430
 tip and push the hat in play 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.020
 don't worry about messing up 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:46.320
 because then we go to those that all 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:51.350
 go ahead continue taking them all 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:54.070
 sections and coordinates 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.070
 other section 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:03.090
 no need to make a scheme 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:05.940
 the important thing is to coordinate the 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.740
 central part above so not 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.910
 worry in the air or too much 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.910
 right or too far left 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.830
 always help yourself with hairspray 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.850
 arrived at the goal of the part 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.960
 back of the head we take care of 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.500
 attachments 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:40.680
 let's take a plus or minus section 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:49.070
 less to the limit of the ear we go 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:49.070
 listen to our city and comb our hair 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:11.130
 put intention and block with two 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:13.520
 hairpins one down and one verse 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.520
 up 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:21.390
 at this point we will find ourselves on the other 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.550
 part left side out we take it e 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.740
 we put it intention so we have to 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.610
 recreate a lesson on one side 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.870
 other 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:33.060
 once the right attention is reached 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:40.830
 you do the same thing you put one 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:43.260
 hairpin southward and a hairpin the 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.300
 right day for safety we go to 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.670
 put one last hairpin then in 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:50.460
 total make 5 hairpins at this point 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:03:00.710
 we go to bring back with the hands i 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:03:00.710
 Our hair of the cow 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:14.020
 and always with this outlet we go to 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:14.680
 clean the entire height of the part 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.840
 crest 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.390
 but of course according to your taste a 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.880
 I personally like them so high 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:25.030
 we will leave high enough to take from 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:28.000
 part of the underlying hair is gone 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:31.860
 hook to the top with the lacquer 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.860
 let's mess the whole thing up 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.640
 and here is the hairstyle made 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.120
 have a special hair evening 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.120
 average
