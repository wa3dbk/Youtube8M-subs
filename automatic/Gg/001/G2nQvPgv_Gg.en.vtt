some<00:00:16.260> chest<00:00:16.500> exercises<00:00:17.010> and<00:00:17.550> I<00:00:17.970> thought<00:00:18.360> he

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
some chest exercises and I thought he

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.660 
some chest exercises and I thought he
didn't<00:00:18.720> be<00:00:18.780> a<00:00:18.810> great<00:00:19.050> example<00:00:19.170> with<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.280> mass

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
didn't be a great example with the mass

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.820 
didn't be a great example with the mass
that<00:00:20.700> he<00:00:21.000> has<00:00:21.150> in<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.450> shape<00:00:21.660> that<00:00:21.840> he<00:00:21.930> has<00:00:22.140> so

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
that he has in the shape that he has so

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.770 
that he has in the shape that he has so
in<00:00:23.250> bodybuilding<00:00:23.580> world<00:00:23.970> what<00:00:24.150> we<00:00:24.270> say<00:00:24.660> is

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:24.780 
in bodybuilding world what we say is

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:25.910 
in bodybuilding world what we say is
actually<00:00:25.050> total<00:00:25.320> package

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
actually total package

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.880 
actually total package
he<00:00:26.250> has<00:00:26.370> both<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:26.670> size<00:00:26.910> and<00:00:27.270> the<00:00:27.780> shape<00:00:27.860> okay

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
he has both the size and the shape okay

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.080 
he has both the size and the shape okay
the<00:00:29.250> exercise<00:00:29.610> that<00:00:29.700> we're<00:00:29.820> going<00:00:29.850> to<00:00:30.000> be

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
the exercise that we're going to be

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.509 
the exercise that we're going to be
doing<00:00:30.270> is<00:00:30.990> called<00:00:31.290> smith<00:00:31.710> machine<00:00:31.860> incline

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:32.519 
doing is called smith machine incline

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:35.569 
doing is called smith machine incline
it's<00:00:33.300> very<00:00:33.539> similar<00:00:33.809> to<00:00:33.960> dumbbell<00:00:34.800> inclines<00:00:35.249> a

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
it's very similar to dumbbell inclines a

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.209 
it's very similar to dumbbell inclines a
regular<00:00:36.210> barbell<00:00:36.570> incline<00:00:36.960> there's<00:00:37.920> pluses

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
regular barbell incline there's pluses

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.729 
regular barbell incline there's pluses
and<00:00:38.489> cons<00:00:38.730> to<00:00:38.940> doing<00:00:38.969> it<00:00:39.390> this<00:00:39.510> way<00:00:39.570> one<00:00:40.530> is

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
and cons to doing it this way one is

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.590 
and cons to doing it this way one is
it's<00:00:40.920> already<00:00:41.190> on<00:00:41.699> a<00:00:41.760> machine<00:00:42.059> so<00:00:42.420> it's

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
it's already on a machine so it's

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.819 
it's already on a machine so it's
already<00:00:42.780> stabilized<00:00:43.199> for<00:00:43.469> you<00:00:43.589> so<00:00:43.710> you<00:00:43.800> don't

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
already stabilized for you so you don't

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.860 
already stabilized for you so you don't
have<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:44.159> do<00:00:44.249> that<00:00:44.399> that<00:00:44.999> can<00:00:45.030> be<00:00:45.239> a<00:00:45.269> con<00:00:45.539> or

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
have to do that that can be a con or

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.959 
have to do that that can be a con or
plus<00:00:46.199> your<00:00:46.859> training<00:00:47.129> by<00:00:47.219> yourself<00:00:47.249> it's<00:00:47.850> a

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
plus your training by yourself it's a

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.729 
plus your training by yourself it's a
plus<00:00:48.239> because<00:00:49.050> you<00:00:49.199> don't<00:00:49.379> really<00:00:49.469> need<00:00:49.679> a

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
plus because you don't really need a

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.590 
plus because you don't really need a
spot<00:00:50.069> you<00:00:50.699> have<00:00:50.850> all<00:00:50.999> these<00:00:51.089> different<00:00:51.239> hooks

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
spot you have all these different hooks

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.630 
spot you have all these different hooks
so<00:00:52.440> if<00:00:52.530> you've<00:00:52.620> got<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:52.739> point<00:00:53.010> of<00:00:53.100> failure<00:00:53.280> you

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
so if you've got a point of failure you

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.549 
so if you've got a point of failure you
can<00:00:54.059> write<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.420> weight<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:54.839> you<00:00:55.289> don't<00:00:55.440> need

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
can write the weight and you don't need

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:56.869 
can write the weight and you don't need
someone<00:00:55.829> there<00:00:55.920> helping<00:00:56.249> you<00:00:56.370> so<00:00:56.699> it's<00:00:56.819> a

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
someone there helping you so it's a

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.160 
someone there helping you so it's a
great<00:00:57.120> exercise<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.659> do<00:00:57.749> if<00:00:57.870> your<00:00:57.989> training

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
great exercise to do if your training

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.750 
great exercise to do if your training
alone<00:00:58.409> and<00:00:59.039> you<00:00:59.129> really<00:00:59.370> need<00:00:59.519> to<00:00:59.550> push

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
alone and you really need to push

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.639 
alone and you really need to push

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.670 

just<00:02:24.780> remember<00:02:25.200> though<00:02:25.319> if<00:02:25.409> you're<00:02:25.560> doing

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
just remember though if you're doing

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.680 
just remember though if you're doing
this<00:02:25.860> movement<00:02:26.159> you<00:02:26.519> don't<00:02:27.000> want<00:02:27.239> to<00:02:27.330> do<00:02:27.420> this

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690

and<00:02:28.129> barbell<00:02:29.129> inclines<00:02:29.519> at<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:29.790> same<00:02:29.970> time

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:30.349 
and barbell inclines at the same time

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:32.300 
and barbell inclines at the same time
reason<00:02:31.349> being<00:02:31.500> because<00:02:31.590> they're<00:02:31.920> both<00:02:32.099> the

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
reason being because they're both the

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.640 
reason being because they're both the
same<00:02:32.340> exercise<00:02:32.909> pretty<00:02:33.150> much<00:02:33.390> so<00:02:34.110> pick<00:02:34.319> one<00:02:34.500> to

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
same exercise pretty much so pick one to

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.289 
same exercise pretty much so pick one to
the<00:02:34.769> other<00:02:34.799> need<00:02:35.610> to<00:02:35.700> go<00:02:35.819> with<00:02:35.940> the<00:02:36.060> Smith

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:36.299 
the other need to go with the Smith

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:39.850 
the other need to go with the Smith
machine<00:02:36.659> or<00:02:37.049> pick<00:02:37.290> a<00:02:37.319> barber<00:02:37.680> our<00:02:37.830> dumbbell

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
machine or pick a barber our dumbbell

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.020

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
and there you have it from structure
