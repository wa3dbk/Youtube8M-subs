00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:30.520
 29 have been on the ground Compper what to look for when you have something 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:32.550
 Percent trained very well 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.000
 Amon yeah that's not just so clear i'm aiming 9 20 inches always means 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.220
 a bit hurt Â»less than 26 2 was a big event, for example 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:44.470
 to act against it 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.130
 he measures and is supposed to be quite well done because we have short chains 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.850
 Waves in the seat, among other things thereby naturally larger chains stood 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.330
 by about ten percent accordingly AG the 26 inches how do you imagine that 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:57.480
 should be driving 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.800
 we have on the 29 on 40 bets 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.650
 just like in 26 years, but slightly over what I have to me as another 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.810
 fellow 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.510
 very comfortable 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.660
 Swallows all obstacles better way 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.450
 I have another member who just sits better on it than on 26 2 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.240
 yes that's the big big benefits at 9 20 clock 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.010
 ours this one 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:25.660
 she should restrain her lover 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.870
 he is the standard that has abused these days 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:29.280
 among them 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.090
 Furthermore, there are a number of 5-year warranty on the program 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.540
 Since you have to operate quite safe already Jansen be convinced that 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.330
 End product year at least in covert trains with us it must be the 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.470
 Hamburg ver the standard is based on the weaving in the canton frame 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:45.990
 laid inside covers 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.940
 But he did not just have to go in and out son Dr 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.880
 the end user tries to find our know-how with us one 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.680
 complete disgusting laid the flight so I have an outer shell in the frame 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:57.770
 laid yourself 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.540
 because that one really is also the flight of the train had best design of Enz 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.340
 to look at Lauritz Cadena Ser 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.880
 at the shoulder of the bike, if need be, I should have 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.049
 disadvantage 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:14.889
 m "We think I'm the first one Alfa a radio seatpost 

00:02:15.419 --> 00:02:17.489
 a deposited on the topic 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:20.879
 because I also think inconsistent ready that is a huge topic 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:24.349
 to draw your five years Helvetic I believe 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:27.959
 those on the market have the toughest testing criteria in our house as well 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.869
 It does not look like they can enter the classroom 

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:35.169
 with us in the laboratory and thereby always can be very sure that we are up there 

00:02:35.169 --> 00:02:37.289
 the good side are in warranty 

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:39.590
 Century I would like to say price 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.790
 December 2010 EUR 20 4 

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:49.040
 1999 the country Gabon and Mountainbike ca in this quality that is for me 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.099
 to say a word now they were gone 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:55.209
 Do you have the right thinks are deadlocked because of course that will be 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:58.230
 Danger awareness on the market clearly that the effect of the 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:59.799
 Product managers are avoided 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:02.629
 because who would like me too many teams that already more experience 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:04.039
 have collected and the 

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:07.339
 No, of course, I've just given it away in geometry tuning 

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:10.779
 based in keel and steering angle what white spot in a very crucial 

00:03:10.779 --> 00:03:11.859
 is 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:15.539
 and they were all very very satisfied and really just want to 

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:20.189
 09 20 12h 1907 then I would say that the control center allowed the ride 

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:22.859
 There is also a waiting list 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:23.439
 the forecasts
