bodacious<00:00:02.759> here<00:00:03.120> on<00:00:03.239> this<00:00:03.330> iced-over<00:00:03.779> lake

00:00:04.119 --> 00:00:04.129 
bodacious here on this iced-over lake

00:00:04.129 --> 00:00:06.409 
bodacious here on this iced-over lake
what<00:00:05.129> I<00:00:05.160> want<00:00:05.370> to<00:00:05.430> get<00:00:05.520> warm<00:00:05.759> from<00:00:05.939> the<00:00:05.970> inside

00:00:06.409 --> 00:00:06.419 
what I want to get warm from the inside

00:00:06.419 --> 00:00:08.210 
what I want to get warm from the inside
out<00:00:06.450> I'll<00:00:06.779> go<00:00:06.990> snag<00:00:07.259> a<00:00:07.290> bodacious<00:00:07.649> being<00:00:08.040> and

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
out I'll go snag a bodacious being and

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.400 
out I'll go snag a bodacious being and
sip<00:00:08.400> that<00:00:08.430> sucker<00:00:08.850> down<00:00:08.940> as<00:00:09.330> you<00:00:10.050> can<00:00:10.140> see<00:00:10.290> the

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
sip that sucker down as you can see the

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.810 
sip that sucker down as you can see the
speedo<00:00:10.770> probably<00:00:11.220> not<00:00:11.340> going<00:00:11.460> to<00:00:11.520> keeping<00:00:11.790> the

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
speedo probably not going to keeping the

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.340 
speedo probably not going to keeping the
warmest<00:00:12.240> so<00:00:12.360> hopefully<00:00:12.660> bodacious<00:00:13.020> being

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:13.350 
warmest so hopefully bodacious being

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:42.130 
warmest so hopefully bodacious being
will<00:00:13.470> do<00:00:13.590> the<00:00:13.710> trick<00:00:13.890> sink<00:00:14.250> or<00:00:14.370> swim

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140

going<00:01:14.000> just<00:01:14.210> what<00:01:14.770> much<00:01:15.770> surface<00:01:16.100> space<00:01:16.250> you

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400 
going just what much surface space you

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:30.670 
going just what much surface space you
can<00:01:16.550> yell<00:01:28.180> over<00:01:29.180> here<00:01:29.630> we've<00:01:29.840> got<00:01:29.869> a<00:01:30.050> look<00:01:30.560> at<00:01:30.650> a

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
can yell over here we've got a look at a

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.210 
can yell over here we've got a look at a
fairly<00:01:31.070> stable<00:01:31.550> I<00:01:31.960> situation<00:01:32.960> over<00:01:33.229> there<00:01:33.260> the

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
fairly stable I situation over there the

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:35.710 
fairly stable I situation over there the
ice<00:01:34.340> starts<00:01:34.729> breaking<00:01:35.030> in<00:01:35.270> about<00:01:35.510> the<00:01:35.690> middle

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
ice starts breaking in about the middle

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.090 
ice starts breaking in about the middle
and<00:01:37.780> wasn't<00:01:38.780> expecting<00:01:39.229> that<00:01:39.260> so<00:01:39.770> I<00:01:39.800> kept

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
and wasn't expecting that so I kept

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.020 
and wasn't expecting that so I kept
going<00:01:40.280> and<00:01:40.670> I<00:01:41.259> I<00:01:42.259> broke<00:01:42.649> terbuka<00:01:43.130> one<00:01:43.850> of<00:01:43.970> the

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
going and I I broke terbuka one of the

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.270 
going and I I broke terbuka one of the
more<00:01:44.210> scary<00:01:44.600> experiences<00:01:45.229> of<00:01:45.410> my<00:01:45.440> life<00:01:45.590> there

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:50.460 
wasn't a look of surprise no this is fun
it<00:01:48.440> was<00:01:48.500> probably<00:01:48.920> like<00:01:49.100> crap<00:01:49.460> I'm<00:01:49.670> gonna<00:01:49.790> die

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
it was probably like crap I'm gonna die

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.260 
it was probably like crap I'm gonna die
surface<00:01:51.470> area<00:01:51.860> was<00:01:52.040> the<00:01:52.160> key<00:01:52.340> just<00:01:52.610> wasn't<00:01:52.940> the

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
surface area was the key just wasn't the

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.570 
surface area was the key just wasn't the
kind<00:01:53.450> of<00:01:53.600> wall<00:01:54.140> herself<00:01:54.649> onto<00:01:54.860> the<00:01:55.070> shore<00:01:55.340> that

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:55.580 
kind of wall herself onto the shore that

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:03.950 
kind of wall herself onto the shore that
it<00:01:55.970> may<00:01:56.210> go<00:01:56.420> skate<00:01:57.020> neither

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.580 

I<00:02:04.049> wasn't<00:02:04.710> cold<00:02:05.190> until<00:02:06.180> my<00:02:06.450> as<00:02:06.690> you<00:02:07.260> can<00:02:07.409> see

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
I wasn't cold until my as you can see

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.430 
I wasn't cold until my as you can see
you<00:02:07.770> Canada<00:02:08.130> kind<00:02:08.310> of<00:02:08.369> blow<00:02:08.580> out<00:02:08.789> here<00:02:09.060> and<00:02:09.440> the

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
hot chocolate held up for a little bit

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.199 
hot chocolate held up for a little bit
then<00:02:13.170> I<00:02:13.200> fell<00:02:13.500> in<00:02:13.709> again<00:02:13.980> over<00:02:14.280> there<00:02:14.459> and

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
then I fell in again over there and

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:18.590 
then I fell in again over there and
that's<00:02:15.780> when<00:02:16.110> it<00:02:16.290> got<00:02:16.520> kind<00:02:17.520> of<00:02:17.610> failed<00:02:17.940> for

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
that's when it got kind of failed for

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.860 
that's when it got kind of failed for
the<00:02:18.690> most<00:02:18.870> part<00:02:19.050> I<00:02:19.350> was<00:02:19.500> warped<00:02:20.540> all<00:02:21.540> in<00:02:21.720> all<00:02:21.840> I

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
the most part I was warped all in all I

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.770 
the most part I was warped all in all I
would<00:02:21.959> never<00:02:22.170> do<00:02:22.319> that<00:02:22.350> again<00:02:22.850> that<00:02:23.850> sucked

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
would never do that again that sucked

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.020 
would never do that again that sucked
suit<00:02:25.680> was<00:02:25.890> a<00:02:25.920> good<00:02:26.100> idea<00:02:26.840> executed<00:02:27.840> for
