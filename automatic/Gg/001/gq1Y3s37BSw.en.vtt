we're<00:00:00.900> doing<00:00:01.170> a<00:00:01.260> demonstration<00:00:01.829> video<00:00:02.129> on<00:00:02.340> how

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
we're doing a demonstration video on how

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.490 
we're doing a demonstration video on how
to<00:00:02.639> use<00:00:02.879> the<00:00:03.060> flash<00:00:03.330> system<00:00:03.629> to<00:00:03.899> find<00:00:04.110> the<00:00:04.290> leak

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
to use the flash system to find the leak

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.960 
to use the flash system to find the leak
in<00:00:04.650> return<00:00:04.950> lines<00:00:05.220> of<00:00:05.400> a<00:00:05.490> swimming<00:00:05.790> pool

in return lines of a swimming pool
before<00:00:06.750> we<00:00:06.870> do<00:00:07.020> that<00:00:07.049> the<00:00:07.470> demonstration<00:00:08.189> I

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
before we do that the demonstration I

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:09.680 
before we do that the demonstration I
want<00:00:08.849> to<00:00:08.910> just<00:00:09.030> go<00:00:09.150> over<00:00:09.179> some<00:00:09.540> of<00:00:09.630> the

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
want to just go over some of the

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.470 
want to just go over some of the
components<00:00:10.230> real<00:00:10.469> quick<00:00:10.740> we<00:00:11.130> have<00:00:11.219> the<00:00:11.480> lt1000

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
components real quick we have the lt1000

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.690 
components real quick we have the lt1000
which<00:00:12.630> hooks<00:00:12.840> up<00:00:13.019> to<00:00:13.049> the<00:00:13.259> flash<00:00:13.500> mic<00:00:13.889> and<00:00:14.519> we

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
which hooks up to the flash mic and we

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.369 
which hooks up to the flash mic and we
have<00:00:14.820> the<00:00:14.910> sender<00:00:15.389> which<00:00:15.599> sends<00:00:15.929> out<00:00:16.049> a<00:00:16.080> signal

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
have the sender which sends out a signal

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.859 
have the sender which sends out a signal
from<00:00:16.680> the<00:00:16.830> flash<00:00:17.100> mic<00:00:17.400> we<00:00:17.910> have<00:00:18.029> a<00:00:18.060> cable<00:00:18.539> pull

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
from the flash mic we have a cable pull

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.260 
from the flash mic we have a cable pull
system<00:00:19.170> we<00:00:19.980> have<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.250> mesh<00:00:20.430> bag<00:00:20.699> that<00:00:20.939> goes<00:00:21.090> on

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
system we have the mesh bag that goes on

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.640 
system we have the mesh bag that goes on
the<00:00:21.449> end<00:00:21.570> of<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:21.840> flash<00:00:22.050> so<00:00:22.289> that<00:00:22.410> we<00:00:22.500> could

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
the end of the flash so that we could

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.410 
the end of the flash so that we could
pull<00:00:22.859> it<00:00:23.010> through<00:00:23.220> a<00:00:23.250> line<00:00:23.550> we<00:00:24.180> have<00:00:24.300> our

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
pull it through a line we have our

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.390 
pull it through a line we have our
pressure<00:00:24.750> rig<00:00:25.080> which<00:00:25.350> we<00:00:25.529> put<00:00:25.710> up<00:00:25.859> under<00:00:26.039> low

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
pressure rig which we put up under low

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.220 
pressure rig which we put up under low
pressure<00:00:26.640> six<00:00:27.180> pounds<00:00:27.599> to<00:00:27.720> find<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.050> leak

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
pressure six pounds to find the leak

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.050 
pressure six pounds to find the leak
with<00:00:28.410> this<00:00:28.590> system<00:00:28.800> and<00:00:29.369> then<00:00:29.670> we<00:00:29.760> have<00:00:29.939> our

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
with this system and then we have our

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.990 
with this system and then we have our
scanner<00:00:30.449> which<00:00:30.779> scans<00:00:31.380> so<00:00:32.070> when<00:00:32.309> this<00:00:32.430> is<00:00:32.610> over

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
scanner which scans so when this is over

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.060 
scanner which scans so when this is over
the<00:00:33.149> leak<00:00:33.329> then<00:00:33.719> we<00:00:33.899> send<00:00:34.170> in<00:00:34.350> a<00:00:34.440> signal<00:00:34.860> we

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
the leak then we send in a signal we

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.740 
the leak then we send in a signal we
scan<00:00:35.399> and<00:00:35.640> then<00:00:35.700> we<00:00:35.820> can<00:00:36.000> tell<00:00:36.149> you<00:00:36.270> exactly

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
scan and then we can tell you exactly

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.150 
scan and then we can tell you exactly
where<00:00:37.050> under<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.710> ground

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
where under the ground

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.000 
where under the ground
this<00:00:38.579> actually<00:00:39.030> is<00:00:39.660> what<00:00:40.440> we're<00:00:40.530> gonna<00:00:40.620> do<00:00:40.860> is

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
this actually is what we're gonna do is

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.590 
this actually is what we're gonna do is
show<00:00:41.160> you<00:00:41.190> how<00:00:41.309> to<00:00:41.489> use<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.850> pull<00:00:42.090> guide<00:00:42.329> to

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
show you how to use the pull guide to

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.119 
show you how to use the pull guide to
pull<00:00:42.809> a<00:00:42.840> string<00:00:43.200> through<00:00:43.530> which<00:00:43.800> is<00:00:43.950> that

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
pull a string through which is that

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.160 
pull a string through which is that
centrally<00:00:44.579> gonna<00:00:44.730> pull<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.570> mic<00:00:45.809> head

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
centrally gonna pull the mic head

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.040 
centrally gonna pull the mic head
through<00:00:46.590> put<00:00:47.280> it<00:00:47.399> under<00:00:47.610> low<00:00:47.820> pressure<00:00:48.120> listen

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
through put it under low pressure listen

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.350 
through put it under low pressure listen
with<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.370> lt1000<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.489> pinpoint<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:51.180> actual

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
with the lt1000 to pinpoint the actual

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.569 
with the lt1000 to pinpoint the actual
leak<00:00:51.809> then<00:00:52.469> we're<00:00:52.620> gonna<00:00:52.710> plug<00:00:52.980> in<00:00:53.190> our<00:00:53.309> Flash

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
leak then we're gonna plug in our Flash

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.970 
leak then we're gonna plug in our Flash
sender<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:54.329> use<00:00:54.780> our<00:00:54.899> scanner<00:00:55.289> to<00:00:55.559> actually

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
sender and use our scanner to actually

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.040 
sender and use our scanner to actually
pick<00:00:56.250> it<00:00:56.370> up<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.699> tell<00:00:57.059> you<00:00:57.180> exactly<00:00:57.420> where

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
pick it up and tell you exactly where

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.099 
pick it up and tell you exactly where
the<00:00:58.109> leak<00:00:58.289> is<00:00:58.410> in<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.710> line<00:00:59.059> so<00:01:00.059> those<00:01:00.510> two<00:01:00.809> tee

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
the leak is in the line so those two tee

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.290 
the leak is in the line so those two tee
into<00:01:01.320> one<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:02.190> trunk<00:01:02.579> line<00:01:02.760> which<00:01:02.969> is<00:01:03.149> inch

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
into one the trunk line which is inch

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.810 
into one the trunk line which is inch
and<00:01:03.449> a<00:01:03.510> half<00:01:03.539> so<00:01:04.379> we<00:01:04.409> take<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:04.979> stand<00:01:05.250> pipe<00:01:05.519> and

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
and a half so we take the stand pipe and

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.820 
and a half so we take the stand pipe and
we<00:01:05.909> raise<00:01:06.119> it<00:01:06.299> above<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.720> water<00:01:06.930> line<00:01:07.200> so<00:01:07.799> that

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
we raise it above the water line so that

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.410 
we raise it above the water line so that
we<00:01:08.040> don't<00:01:08.220> have<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.490> drain<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.729> pool<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.390> pool

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
we don't have to drain the pool the pool

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.060 
we don't have to drain the pool the pool
is<00:01:09.720> drained<00:01:09.990> you<00:01:10.140> don't<00:01:10.320> need<00:01:10.470> a<00:01:10.500> stand<00:01:10.799> pipe

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
is drained you don't need a stand pipe

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.490 
is drained you don't need a stand pipe
you<00:01:11.700> just<00:01:11.939> need<00:01:12.119> an<00:01:12.299> inch<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:12.869> a<00:01:12.900> half<00:01:12.930> nipple

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
you just need an inch and a half nipple

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.109 
you just need an inch and a half nipple
a<00:01:13.590> converter<00:01:13.950> that<00:01:14.130> actually<00:01:14.520> comes<00:01:14.790> with<00:01:15.000> the

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
a converter that actually comes with the

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.770 
a converter that actually comes with the
flash<00:01:15.360> system<00:01:15.860> we<00:01:16.860> plug<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.400> other<00:01:17.580> side<00:01:17.880> to

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
flash system we plug the other side to

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.320 
flash system we plug the other side to
prevent<00:01:19.020> it<00:01:19.170> from<00:01:19.200> sucking<00:01:19.799> in<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.369> what<00:01:21.210> we

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
prevent it from sucking in and what we

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.030 
prevent it from sucking in and what we
also<00:01:21.540> did<00:01:21.869> over<00:01:22.140> at<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.380> equipment<00:01:22.680> which

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
also did over at the equipment which

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.789 
also did over at the equipment which
we'll<00:01:23.220> show<00:01:23.430> you<00:01:23.460> is<00:01:23.880> we<00:01:24.330> cut<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.200> line<00:01:25.380> free

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
we'll show you is we cut the line free

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.620 
we'll show you is we cut the line free
and<00:01:26.070> we<00:01:26.189> stubbed<00:01:26.490> it<00:01:26.670> up<00:01:26.790> for<00:01:27.000> demonstration

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
and we stubbed it up for demonstration

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.490 
and we stubbed it up for demonstration
purposes<00:01:28.640> so<00:01:29.640> by<00:01:29.850> using<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.750> reverse<00:01:31.020> side<00:01:31.290> of

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
purposes so by using the reverse side of

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.649 
purposes so by using the reverse side of
a<00:01:31.590> shop<00:01:31.799> vac<00:01:32.070> we<00:01:32.340> blow<00:01:32.579> that<00:01:32.820> hole<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.450> water

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
a shop vac we blow that hole the water

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.240 
a shop vac we blow that hole the water
out<00:01:33.869> of<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.020> line<00:01:34.259> it<00:01:34.439> makes<00:01:34.680> it<00:01:34.829> easier<00:01:35.189> than

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
out of the line it makes it easier than

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.960 
out of the line it makes it easier than
actually<00:01:35.790> sucking<00:01:36.060> it<00:01:36.329> in<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.570> line<00:01:37.970> all

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
actually sucking it in the line all

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.760 
actually sucking it in the line all
right<00:01:39.119> so<00:01:39.270> now<00:01:39.450> we<00:01:39.509> have<00:01:39.630> suction<00:01:40.290> in<00:01:40.530> that

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
right so now we have suction in that

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.380 
right so now we have suction in that
line<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.369> what<00:01:41.490> we're<00:01:41.610> gonna<00:01:41.670> do<00:01:41.970> is<00:01:42.210> we're

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
line and what we're gonna do is we're

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.359 
line and what we're gonna do is we're
gonna<00:01:42.479> introduce<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.409> pull<00:01:44.100> guide

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
gonna introduce the the pull guide

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.700 
gonna introduce the the pull guide
system<00:01:44.869> with<00:01:45.869> this<00:01:46.049> we<00:01:46.229> have<00:01:46.320> we<00:01:46.560> have<00:01:46.680> a

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
system with this we have we have a

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.740 
system with this we have we have a
couple<00:01:46.890> different<00:01:47.070> options<00:01:47.399> of<00:01:47.850> heads<00:01:48.329> to<00:01:48.570> put

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
couple different options of heads to put

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.190 
couple different options of heads to put
on<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:48.990> end<00:01:49.110> this<00:01:49.860> is<00:01:50.040> our<00:01:50.189> plastic<00:01:50.759> sleeve

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
on the end this is our plastic sleeve

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.539 
on the end this is our plastic sleeve
which<00:01:52.200> will<00:01:52.350> get<00:01:52.500> pulled<00:01:52.770> right<00:01:53.009> in<00:01:53.250> so<00:01:53.430> go

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
which will get pulled right in so go

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.600 
which will get pulled right in so go
ahead<00:01:53.610> William<00:01:54.030> stop<00:01:54.240> baiting<00:01:54.479> it<00:01:55.460> feeds<00:01:56.460> it

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
ahead William stop baiting it feeds it

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:03.080 
ahead William stop baiting it feeds it
nice

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.730 

so<00:02:03.600> now<00:02:03.750> that<00:02:03.930> we<00:02:04.079> fed<00:02:04.290> it<00:02:04.320> through<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.649> other

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
so now that we fed it through the other

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.289 
so now that we fed it through the other
side<00:02:05.130> you're<00:02:05.430> just<00:02:05.460> gonna<00:02:05.700> pull<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.090> back

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
side you're just gonna pull the back

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:11.809 
side you're just gonna pull the back
line<00:02:06.570> on<00:02:07.079> the<00:02:07.259> on<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.770> shop<00:02:08.280> back<00:02:09.170> and<00:02:10.170> they<00:02:11.069> go

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
line on the on the shop back and they go

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:17.630 
line on the on the shop back and they go
g-string<00:02:12.420> and<00:02:12.920> now<00:02:13.920> you're<00:02:14.130> all<00:02:14.280> away<00:02:16.520> and<00:02:17.520> I'm

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
g-string and now you're all away and I'm

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.070 
g-string and now you're all away and I'm
gonna<00:02:17.819> start<00:02:18.060> sending<00:02:18.300> the<00:02:18.510> mic<00:02:18.720> door<00:02:18.930> I'm

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
gonna start sending the mic door I'm

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.229 
gonna start sending the mic door I'm
gonna<00:02:19.230> feed<00:02:19.530> it<00:02:19.680> while<00:02:19.830> he<00:02:19.980> pulls<00:02:20.220> it<00:02:20.459> so<00:02:21.090> now

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
gonna feed it while he pulls it so now

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.449 
gonna feed it while he pulls it so now
he's<00:02:21.480> gonna<00:02:21.599> start<00:02:21.959> pulling<00:02:22.380> on<00:02:22.530> it<00:02:22.560> while<00:02:23.280> I'm

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
he's gonna start pulling on it while I'm

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.610 
he's gonna start pulling on it while I'm
feeding<00:02:23.700> it<00:02:24.000> and<00:02:24.180> we'll<00:02:25.050> show<00:02:25.080> you<00:02:25.260> when<00:02:25.530> it

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
feeding it and we'll show you when it

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.160 
feeding it and we'll show you when it
comes<00:02:25.830> through<00:02:26.040> so<00:02:26.640> once<00:02:26.970> we<00:02:27.150> pull<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.690> mesh

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
comes through so once we pull the mesh

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.839 
comes through so once we pull the mesh
bag<00:02:28.440> with<00:02:28.800> the<00:02:28.920> wire<00:02:29.160> through

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
bag with the wire through

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:32.059 
bag with the wire through
now<00:02:30.510> we're<00:02:30.660> gonna<00:02:30.989> disconnect<00:02:31.260> a<00:02:31.680> mesh<00:02:31.860> bag

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
now we're gonna disconnect a mesh bag

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.790 
now we're gonna disconnect a mesh bag
from<00:02:32.489> it<00:02:32.750> we<00:02:33.750> are<00:02:33.870> gonna<00:02:33.959> actually<00:02:34.230> put<00:02:34.680> the

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
from it we are gonna actually put the

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.420 
from it we are gonna actually put the
wire<00:02:35.150> ahead<00:02:36.150> of<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:36.510> mic<00:02:36.690> back<00:02:36.959> in<00:02:37.350> and<00:02:37.650> then

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
wire ahead of the mic back in and then

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.009 
wire ahead of the mic back in and then
we're<00:02:38.549> gonna<00:02:38.640> put<00:02:38.910> our<00:02:39.030> pressure<00:02:39.299> rig<00:02:39.600> on<00:02:39.840> it

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
we're gonna put our pressure rig on it

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:41.840 
we're gonna put our pressure rig on it
so<00:02:40.440> that<00:02:40.590> we<00:02:40.709> can<00:02:40.860> induce<00:02:41.100> pressure<00:02:41.430> from<00:02:41.730> this

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
so that we can induce pressure from this

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.509 
so that we can induce pressure from this
side<00:02:41.910> I<00:02:42.600> think<00:02:42.870> we<00:02:42.930> have<00:02:43.140> our<00:02:43.290> flash<00:02:43.620> mic<00:02:44.190> all

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
side I think we have our flash mic all

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:46.309 
side I think we have our flash mic all
the<00:02:44.640> way<00:02:44.730> back<00:02:45.000> at<00:02:45.360> the<00:02:45.420> beginning<00:02:45.750> over<00:02:46.200> there

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
the way back at the beginning over there

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:48.440 
the way back at the beginning over there
we're<00:02:46.470> gonna<00:02:46.560> keep<00:02:46.799> pulling<00:02:47.250> it<00:02:47.400> and<00:02:47.790> we<00:02:48.420> just

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
we're gonna keep pulling it and we just

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.320 
we're gonna keep pulling it and we just
keep<00:02:48.870> pulling<00:02:49.080> it<00:02:49.349> through<00:02:50.000> until<00:02:51.000> we<00:02:51.030> get

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
keep pulling it through until we get

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.140 
keep pulling it through until we get
right<00:02:51.630> over<00:02:51.840> the<00:02:52.049> sound<00:02:52.319> that's<00:02:52.620> a<00:02:52.709> very

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
right over the sound that's a very

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.820 
right over the sound that's a very
distinctive<00:02:54.150> jet<00:02:54.540> sound<00:02:54.900> that<00:02:55.200> it<00:02:55.290> makes<00:02:55.470> and

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
distinctive jet sound that it makes and

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.800 
distinctive jet sound that it makes and
we're<00:02:56.489> gonna<00:02:56.610> introduce<00:02:57.000> that<00:02:57.360> right<00:02:57.630> now

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
we're gonna introduce that right now

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.860 
we're gonna introduce that right now
into<00:02:58.140> the<00:02:58.260> video<00:02:58.640> I'm<00:02:59.640> getting<00:03:00.090> closer<00:03:00.390> to<00:03:00.569> it

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
into the video I'm getting closer to it

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.589 
into the video I'm getting closer to it
when<00:03:01.769> you<00:03:01.860> get<00:03:02.010> up<00:03:02.190> close<00:03:02.220> to<00:03:02.700> it<00:03:02.730> it<00:03:03.060> just

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
when you get up close to it it just

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:06.860 
when you get up close to it it just
screams<00:03:04.200> like<00:03:04.470> a<00:03:04.530> jet<00:03:04.890> noise<00:03:05.160> and<00:03:05.640> we're<00:03:06.630> right

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
screams like a jet noise and we're right

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:13.520 
screams like a jet noise and we're right
there<00:03:07.140> right<00:03:07.440> now

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.590 

unplug<00:03:14.430> this<00:03:14.640> and<00:03:14.850> we're<00:03:14.940> gonna<00:03:15.060> plug<00:03:15.300> it<00:03:15.480> into

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
unplug this and we're gonna plug it into

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:22.010 
unplug this and we're gonna plug it into
our<00:03:15.870> sander<00:03:19.069> and<00:03:20.209> what<00:03:21.209> I<00:03:21.240> like<00:03:21.480> to<00:03:21.510> do<00:03:21.720> is<00:03:21.900> I

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:22.020 
our sander and what I like to do is I

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.630 
our sander and what I like to do is I
like<00:03:22.170> to<00:03:22.200> put<00:03:22.470> it<00:03:22.590> in<00:03:22.709> the<00:03:22.800> pulse<00:03:23.040> motor<00:03:23.400> and

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
like to put it in the pulse motor and

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.000 
like to put it in the pulse motor and
sender<00:03:24.030> because<00:03:24.569> it<00:03:24.720> makes<00:03:24.930> a<00:03:25.020> very<00:03:25.050> distinct

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
sender because it makes a very distinct

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.920 
sender because it makes a very distinct
noise<00:03:26.190> it's<00:03:26.760> almost<00:03:26.970> like<00:03:27.150> a<00:03:27.180> submarine<00:03:27.480> in

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
noise it's almost like a submarine in

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.180 
noise it's almost like a submarine in
which<00:03:28.050> you're<00:03:28.230> gonna<00:03:28.319> hear<00:03:28.650> on<00:03:28.800> the<00:03:28.890> scanner

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
which you're gonna hear on the scanner

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.240 
which you're gonna hear on the scanner
right<00:03:29.430> now<00:03:30.080> so<00:03:31.080> now<00:03:31.290> we're<00:03:31.530> sending<00:03:31.770> the<00:03:32.040> flash

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
right now so now we're sending the flash

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.070
