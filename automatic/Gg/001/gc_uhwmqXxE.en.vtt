that<00:00:52.809> were<00:00:52.929> in<00:00:53.109> it<00:00:53.230> so<00:00:53.800> we're<00:00:53.920> going<00:00:54.010> to<00:00:54.070> plant

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:54.339 
that were in it so we're going to plant

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:56.910 
that were in it so we're going to plant
three<00:00:54.969> slips<00:00:55.420> in<00:00:55.570> it<00:00:55.660> that<00:00:55.809> may<00:00:56.109> be<00:00:56.170> pushing<00:00:56.649> it

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:56.920 
three slips in it that may be pushing it

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.560 
three slips in it that may be pushing it
too<00:00:57.160> would<00:00:57.250> probably<00:00:57.579> be<00:00:57.640> safe<00:00:57.879> but<00:00:58.269> we<00:00:58.390> have

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.570 
too would probably be safe but we have

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.599 
too would probably be safe but we have
extra<00:00:58.899> slips<00:00:59.199> the<00:00:59.739> other<00:00:59.949> three<00:01:00.280> will<00:01:00.370> go<00:01:00.550> to

00:01:00.599 --> 00:01:00.609 
extra slips the other three will go to

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:02.520 
extra slips the other three will go to
the<00:01:00.820> small<00:01:01.149> garden<00:01:01.539> where<00:01:01.690> they<00:01:01.870> will<00:01:02.109> climb

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
the small garden where they will climb

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.400 
the small garden where they will climb
over<00:01:02.800> the<00:01:03.249> fence<00:01:03.660> we<00:01:04.660> own<00:01:04.750> both<00:01:04.989> sides<00:01:05.230> of<00:01:05.350> the

here now what happens to this sweet

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.819 
here now what happens to this sweet
potatoes<00:01:34.329> are<00:01:34.570> different<00:01:35.110> than<00:01:35.320> regular

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:40.329 
plant they want sunlight and they want

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:43.620 
plant they want sunlight and they want
heat<00:01:40.780> so<00:01:41.500> what<00:01:41.799> happens<00:01:42.369> is<00:01:42.549> we<00:01:42.969> plant<00:01:43.329> this<00:01:43.479> in

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
heat so what happens is we plant this in

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.649 
heat so what happens is we plant this in
the<00:01:43.719> ground<00:01:43.990> and<00:01:44.229> this<00:01:45.040> potato<00:01:45.399> will<00:01:45.670> begin<00:01:46.479> to

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
the ground and this potato will begin to

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:49.319 
the ground and this potato will begin to
vine<00:01:46.960> that's<00:01:47.530> the<00:01:47.920> expectations<00:01:48.880> of<00:01:49.030> it<00:01:49.119> and

vine that's the expectations of it and

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:52.560 
vine that's the expectations of it and
the<00:01:50.049> potatoes<00:01:50.590> themselves<00:01:50.979> will<00:01:51.850> produce<00:01:52.060> in

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
the potatoes themselves will produce in

most<00:02:02.289> of<00:02:02.530> the<00:02:02.619> potatoes<00:02:02.890> will<00:02:03.430> grow<00:02:03.670> in<00:02:03.939> the

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:04.509 
most of the potatoes will grow in the

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:07.170 
most of the potatoes will grow in the
bucket<00:02:05.350> that<00:02:05.560> we<00:02:05.680> have<00:02:05.920> them<00:02:06.039> in<00:02:06.159> if<00:02:06.310> you<00:02:06.820> have

bucket that we have them in if you have
them<00:02:07.450> growing<00:02:08.020> on<00:02:08.320> a<00:02:08.350> tree<00:02:08.649> in<00:02:08.710> a<00:02:08.950> traditional

could<00:02:11.319> be<00:02:11.349> potential<00:02:11.950> potatoes<00:02:12.430> possibly

growing beyond the main roots but that's

growing beyond the main roots but that's
not

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
likely so we're just going to take our

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.240 
likely so we're just going to take our
slip<00:02:19.050> and<00:02:19.260> we're<00:02:19.950> going<00:02:20.220> to<00:02:20.250> bury<00:02:20.670> it<00:02:20.790> as<00:02:22.250> deep

growing<00:02:39.990> on<00:02:40.230> the<00:02:40.440> potatoes<00:02:40.890> itself<00:02:41.280> that<00:02:41.430> we

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
growing on the potatoes itself that we

had emerged in a mason jar this is where
it<00:02:44.580> came<00:02:44.940> off<00:02:45.239> of<00:02:45.270> the<00:02:45.510> potato<00:02:45.720> and<00:02:46.080> this<00:02:46.230> is<00:02:46.380> a

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
have that potato emerge in the water

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.080 
have that potato emerge in the water
about<00:02:54.660> two<00:02:54.959> or<00:02:55.140> three<00:02:55.170> months<00:02:55.620> prior<00:02:56.010> to<00:02:56.090> ever

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
about two or three months prior to ever

about two or three months prior to ever
wanting<00:02:57.390> slips<00:02:57.630> because<00:02:57.810> it<00:02:58.019> does<00:02:58.230> take<00:02:58.500> time

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
wanting slips because it does take time

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.640 
wanting slips because it does take time
for<00:02:59.580> the<00:02:59.730> potato<00:03:00.030> to<00:03:00.269> germinate<00:03:00.720> slips<00:03:01.170> you

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
for the potato to germinate slips you

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.560 
for the potato to germinate slips you
can<00:03:01.769> also<00:03:01.890> buy<00:03:02.190> them<00:03:02.400> but<00:03:02.580> they<00:03:02.730> can<00:03:03.000> be<00:03:03.239> pricey

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
can also buy them but they can be pricey

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.380 
can also buy them but they can be pricey
based<00:03:03.900> on<00:03:04.110> where<00:03:04.290> you<00:03:04.410> get<00:03:04.590> them<00:03:04.709> from<00:03:04.920> so<00:03:05.580> I'm

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
based on where you get them from so I'm

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:18.059 
based on where you get them from so I'm
going<00:03:06.570> to<00:03:06.630> put<00:03:06.780> another<00:03:07.019> one<00:03:07.260> right<00:03:09.800> here

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:18.069 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:19.979

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
and we're going to put a third one which

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:22.199 
and we're going to put a third one which
probably<00:03:20.530> is<00:03:20.590> pushing<00:03:20.980> it<00:03:21.069> but<00:03:21.670> I'm<00:03:22.000> going<00:03:22.120> to

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
probably is pushing it but I'm going to

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:25.830 
probably is pushing it but I'm going to
take<00:03:22.359> a<00:03:22.390> smaller<00:03:23.400> smaller<00:03:24.400> one<00:03:24.670> here<00:03:24.939> still

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
take a smaller smaller one here still

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.709 
take a smaller smaller one here still
got<00:03:26.079> a<00:03:26.109> lot<00:03:26.260> of<00:03:26.290> roots<00:03:27.090> got<00:03:28.090> roots<00:03:28.299> coming<00:03:28.629> out

got a lot of roots got roots coming out

00:03:28.719 --> 00:03:30.149 
got a lot of roots got roots coming out
everywhere<00:03:29.079> I'm<00:03:29.500> going<00:03:29.620> to<00:03:29.709> put<00:03:29.859> it<00:03:29.980> on<00:03:30.069> the

00:03:30.149 --> 00:03:30.159 
everywhere I'm going to put it on the

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:35.849 
everywhere I'm going to put it on the
backside<00:03:30.909> here<00:03:32.400> and<00:03:34.140> we'll<00:03:35.140> let<00:03:35.319> them<00:03:35.530> vine

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:35.859 
backside here and we'll let them vine

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:38.849 
backside here and we'll let them vine
out<00:03:36.189> and<00:03:36.579> in<00:03:37.060> approximately<00:03:37.780> a<00:03:38.109> hundred<00:03:38.470> days

out and in approximately a hundred days

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:42.119

or so 100 to 120 days based on the

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:44.520 
or so 100 to 120 days based on the
variety<00:03:42.519> of<00:03:42.579> sweet<00:03:42.790> potato<00:03:43.090> you<00:03:43.239> have<00:03:43.530> we

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
variety of sweet potato you have we

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:45.960 
variety of sweet potato you have we
hopefully<00:03:44.739> will<00:03:44.920> be<00:03:45.129> harvesting<00:03:45.670> at<00:03:45.790> least

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
hopefully will be harvesting at least

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:47.490 
hopefully will be harvesting at least
better<00:03:46.359> sweet<00:03:46.750> potatoes<00:03:47.079> than<00:03:47.200> we<00:03:47.319> did<00:03:47.439> last

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
better sweet potatoes than we did last

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:48.809 
better sweet potatoes than we did last
year<00:03:47.799> each<00:03:48.040> year<00:03:48.250> is<00:03:48.370> a<00:03:48.400> learning<00:03:48.760> experience

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:48.819 
year each year is a learning experience

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:51.390 
year each year is a learning experience
so<00:03:49.780> we're<00:03:49.900> going<00:03:49.989> to<00:03:50.049> go<00:03:50.230> the<00:03:50.560> elevated<00:03:51.010> method

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
so we're going to go the elevated method

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.610 
so we're going to go the elevated method
with<00:03:51.519> good<00:03:51.849> organic<00:03:52.569> certified<00:03:53.109> leaf<00:03:53.319> compost
