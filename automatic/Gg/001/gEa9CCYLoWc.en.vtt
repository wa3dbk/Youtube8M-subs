00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
discovered recently of course is they

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.289 
discovered recently of course is they
seem<00:01:43.470> to<00:01:43.619> set<00:01:43.829> seed<00:01:44.159> quite<00:01:44.520> easily<00:01:44.759> if<00:01:45.090> you<00:01:45.149> get

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
seem to set seed quite easily if you get

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.580 
seem to set seed quite easily if you get
a<00:01:45.329> few<00:01:45.540> bees<00:01:45.780> around<00:01:47.659> they'll<00:01:48.659> set<00:01:49.020> seed<00:01:49.320> and

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
a few bees around they'll set seed and

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.590 
a few bees around they'll set seed and
then<00:01:49.649> in<00:01:49.829> a<00:01:50.119> you've<00:01:51.119> got<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.270> bit<00:01:51.450> of<00:01:51.479> a

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
types and none of these ones are

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.860 
types and none of these ones are
flowered<00:02:17.730> yet<00:02:17.910> so<00:02:18.120> I'll<00:02:18.180> be<00:02:18.300> interested<00:02:18.570> to

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
flowered yet so I'll be interested to

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.690 
flowered yet so I'll be interested to
see<00:02:19.110> what<00:02:19.260> sort<00:02:19.500> of<00:02:19.560> flowers<00:02:19.950> I<00:02:20.070> get<00:02:20.280> from<00:02:20.490> them

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
see what sort of flowers I get from them

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.860 
see what sort of flowers I get from them
but<00:02:21.200> looking<00:02:22.200> at<00:02:22.350> the<00:02:22.790> form<00:02:23.790> on<00:02:24.030> each<00:02:24.180> plant<00:02:24.570> I

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
but looking at the form on each plant I

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.930 
but looking at the form on each plant I
would<00:02:25.710> imagine<00:02:25.950> that<00:02:26.190> I'll<00:02:26.430> end<00:02:26.610> up<00:02:26.730> with<00:02:26.790> a
