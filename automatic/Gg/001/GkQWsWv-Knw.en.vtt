00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
keeper for most of the 90s and he's the

Danish<00:01:27.299> guy<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:28.189> once<00:01:29.189> I<00:01:29.310> saw<00:01:29.520> him<00:01:29.640> play<00:01:29.820> once

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
Danish guy and once I saw him play once

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.760 
Danish guy and once I saw him play once
I<00:01:30.270> knew<00:01:30.420> he<00:01:30.600> was<00:01:30.689> he<00:01:31.170> was<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.409> best<00:01:31.590> goalkeeper

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
I knew he was he was the best goalkeeper

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.289

I've<00:01:32.070> ever<00:01:32.250> seen<00:01:32.460> and<00:01:32.670> I<00:01:32.729> wanted<00:01:32.939> to<00:01:33.000> be<00:01:33.119> like

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
I've ever seen and I wanted to be like

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.969 
I've ever seen and I wanted to be like
you<00:01:33.840> guys<00:01:33.930> definitely<00:01:34.200> got<00:01:34.380> great<00:01:34.680> reactions

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.240 

now<00:01:38.810> so<00:01:39.810> being<00:01:40.079> a<00:01:40.229> goalkeeper<00:01:40.439> right<00:01:41.009> you<00:01:41.130> go

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
now so being a goalkeeper right you go

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.010 
now so being a goalkeeper right you go
through<00:01:41.460> those<00:01:41.549> years<00:01:41.789> when<00:01:42.000> you're<00:01:42.119> 13<00:01:42.450> when

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
through those years when you're 13 when

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.149

tight-knit<00:04:07.160> group<00:04:08.160> of<00:04:08.250> guys<00:04:08.400> so<00:04:09.030> it<00:04:09.270> was<00:04:09.570> an

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
tight-knit group of guys so it was an

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.870 
tight-knit group of guys so it was an
easy<00:04:09.750> transition<00:04:09.930> I<00:04:10.500> think<00:04:10.530> we<00:04:11.370> had<00:04:11.490> so<00:04:11.700> many

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
easy transition I think we had so many

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.320 
easy transition I think we had so many
new<00:04:12.180> players<00:04:12.480> come<00:04:12.810> in<00:04:13.640> that<00:04:14.640> you<00:04:15.060> know<00:04:15.150> there

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
was a bit of nerves that we thought it

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:18.949 
was a bit of nerves that we thought it
might<00:04:17.520> not<00:04:17.730> go<00:04:17.880> well<00:04:18.120> might<00:04:18.420> not<00:04:18.540> go<00:04:18.660> smooth

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
might not go well might not go smooth

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.570 
might not go well might not go smooth
the<00:04:19.140> team<00:04:19.320> might<00:04:19.500> not<00:04:19.800> be<00:04:19.980> you<00:04:20.430> know<00:04:20.489> a

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:20.580 
the team might not be you know a

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:22.700 
the team might not be you know a
cohesive<00:04:21.090> unit<00:04:21.120> but<00:04:21.600> the<00:04:22.140> guys<00:04:22.290> have<00:04:22.470> messed
