00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
a bit closer to our objective but this

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.459

point

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.460 

in<00:04:25.920> the<00:04:26.700> main<00:04:26.880> tunnels<00:04:27.300> these<00:04:27.780> ladders<00:04:28.110> are

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
in the main tunnels these ladders are

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.770 
in the main tunnels these ladders are
the<00:04:28.590> underground<00:04:29.100> access<00:04:29.640> points<00:04:30.090> so<00:04:30.570> watch

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
the underground access points so watch
