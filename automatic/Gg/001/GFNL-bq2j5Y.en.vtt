00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
let's see first we hook up the actually

let's see first we hook up the actually
last<00:00:28.109> you<00:00:28.349> hook<00:00:28.470> up<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.680> power<00:00:28.859> here<00:00:29.820> before

the<00:00:30.810> fuse<00:00:31.080> this<00:00:31.380> is<00:00:31.619> a<00:00:31.650> straight<00:00:32.130> from<00:00:32.309> the

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
the fuse this is a straight from the

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.209 
the fuse this is a straight from the
battery<00:00:33.110> goes<00:00:34.110> around<00:00:34.380> that's<00:00:34.980> where<00:00:35.190> I

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
battery goes around that's where I

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.049 
battery goes around that's where I
mounted<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.730> fuse<00:00:36.450> for<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.719> amp<00:00:37.910> ran<00:00:38.910> the

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
mounted the fuse for the amp ran the

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:46.310 
mounted the fuse for the amp ran the
power<00:00:39.270> wire<00:00:40.219> over<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:41.790> around<00:00:42.000> I<00:00:45.140> ran<00:00:46.140> it<00:00:46.289> down

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
power wire over and around I ran it down

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.029 
power wire over and around I ran it down
and<00:00:46.950> there's<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.550> hole<00:00:47.789> down<00:00:48.090> there<00:00:49.039> that

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
and there's a hole down there that

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.920 
and there's a hole down there that
already<00:00:50.280> existed<00:00:50.940> I<00:00:51.180> don't<00:00:51.360> think<00:00:51.570> I<00:00:51.660> can<00:00:51.719> get

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
already existed I don't think I can get

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.650 
already existed I don't think I can get
it<00:00:52.050> in<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.289> camera<00:00:52.530> but<00:00:53.270> so<00:00:54.270> I<00:00:54.329> pulled<00:00:54.629> the

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
it in the camera but so I pulled the

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.299 
it in the camera but so I pulled the
grommet<00:00:55.079> out<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.410> was<00:00:55.530> able<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:55.829> jam<00:00:56.129> this

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
grommet out and was able to jam this

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.479 
grommet out and was able to jam this
through<00:00:56.610> I<00:00:56.640> think<00:00:57.090> it<00:00:57.239> is<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:58.460> that<00:00:59.460> I

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
through I think it is the that I

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.090 
through I think it is the that I
remember<00:00:59.910> what<00:01:00.030> it's<00:01:00.239> for<00:01:00.390> all<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.809> hood

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
remember what it's for all the hood

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:10.310 
remember what it's for all the hood
release<00:01:02.100> cable<00:01:07.610> you<00:01:08.610> can<00:01:08.640> pick<00:01:09.570> it<00:01:09.720> up<00:01:09.780> inside

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
release cable you can pick it up inside

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.350 
release cable you can pick it up inside
here<00:01:10.710> now<00:01:10.890> you<00:01:11.580> probably<00:01:11.790> can't<00:01:12.119> see<00:01:12.330> but

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
here now you probably can't see but

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.330 
here now you probably can't see but
anyways<00:01:12.900> are<00:01:13.170> in<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.409> power<00:01:13.560> over<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.100> across

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
anyways are in the power over and across

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:21.600 
anyways are in the power over and across

where<00:01:30.410> is<00:01:30.560> the<00:01:30.740> stay<00:01:30.950> good<00:01:31.130> to<00:01:31.400> go<00:01:31.550> to<00:01:31.610> the<00:01:31.760> amp

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
where is the stay good to go to the amp

where is the stay good to go to the amp
the<00:01:32.980> background<00:01:33.980> here<00:01:34.520> I<00:01:34.900> tapped<00:01:35.900> onto<00:01:36.320> there

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
the background here I tapped onto there

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.750 
the background here I tapped onto there
I<00:01:36.770> think<00:01:37.340> that's<00:01:37.520> a<00:01:37.640> half<00:01:37.820> inch<00:01:39.490> bolt<00:01:40.490> there

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:40.760 
I think that's a half inch bolt there

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.630 
I think that's a half inch bolt there
and<00:01:40.970> that's<00:01:41.630> a<00:01:41.750> good<00:01:41.900> ground<00:01:42.200> check<00:01:42.710> that<00:01:42.890> out

them<00:02:53.930> I<00:02:54.400> ran<00:02:55.400> this<00:02:55.610> set<00:02:55.880> of<00:02:56.000> wires<00:02:56.950> this<00:02:57.950> is<00:02:58.130> a

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
them I ran this set of wires this is a

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.060 
them I ran this set of wires this is a
dual<00:02:58.519> coil<00:02:58.910> subwoofer<00:02:59.690> and<00:03:00.530> they're<00:03:00.799> fed

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
dual coil subwoofer and they're fed

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.880 
dual coil subwoofer and they're fed
separately<00:03:01.610> so<00:03:02.330> I<00:03:02.360> cut<00:03:02.840> that<00:03:02.989> configuration<00:03:03.560> I

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
separately so I cut that configuration I

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.140 
separately so I cut that configuration I
did<00:03:04.070> not<00:03:04.220> bridge<00:03:04.549> my<00:03:04.730> amp<00:03:05.380> so<00:03:06.380> I<00:03:06.410> tapped<00:03:06.799> off

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
did not bridge my amp so I tapped off

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.800 
did not bridge my amp so I tapped off
the<00:03:08.150> four<00:03:08.420> wires<00:03:09.160> here<00:03:10.160> they<00:03:10.430> go<00:03:10.580> into<00:03:10.760> my<00:03:11.030> line

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
the four wires here they go into my line

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.539 
the four wires here they go into my line
converter<00:03:12.320> that<00:03:12.680> I<00:03:12.709> picked<00:03:13.010> up<00:03:13.100> at<00:03:13.280> Walmart

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:18.699 

from<00:03:16.549> here<00:03:16.820> they<00:03:17.060> go<00:03:17.209> to<00:03:17.299> the<00:03:17.450> rca's<00:03:18.019> that<00:03:18.500> run

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
from here they go to the rca's that run

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:20.920 
from here they go to the rca's that run
back<00:03:18.920> to<00:03:19.130> the<00:03:19.220> amp<00:03:19.400> then<00:03:20.209> the<00:03:20.420> speaker<00:03:20.750> waves

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
back to the amp then the speaker waves

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.830 
back to the amp then the speaker waves
from<00:03:21.140> the<00:03:21.320> amp<00:03:21.440> come<00:03:21.709> up<00:03:21.860> and<00:03:22.239> tap<00:03:23.239> into<00:03:23.480> the

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
from the amp come up and tap into the

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:29.819 
from the amp come up and tap into the
four<00:03:24.320> wires<00:03:24.560> here<00:03:24.920> going<00:03:25.190> to<00:03:25.280> the<00:03:25.400> subwoofer

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:29.829 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:33.720 

and<00:03:31.150> things<00:03:32.150> work<00:03:32.389> really<00:03:32.630> good<00:03:32.870> it<00:03:33.049> was<00:03:33.079> a

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
and things work really good it was a

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.320 
and things work really good it was a
totally<00:03:34.730> happy<00:03:35.090> it's

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:35.330 
totally happy it's

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:39.400 
totally happy it's
much<00:03:35.980> much<00:03:36.980> beefier<00:03:37.610> a<00:03:37.880> little<00:03:38.510> tip<00:03:38.780> that<00:03:39.110> I

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
much much beefier a little tip that I

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.030 
much much beefier a little tip that I
found<00:03:39.830> is<00:03:40.160> on<00:03:40.700> my<00:03:41.630> amp<00:03:41.870> it's<00:03:42.350> got<00:03:42.590> a<00:03:42.620> low-pass

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
found is on my amp it's got a low-pass

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.980 
found is on my amp it's got a low-pass
filter<00:03:43.550> and<00:03:43.580> a<00:03:43.820> PHY<00:03:44.030> I<00:03:44.060> want<00:03:44.450> to<00:03:44.540> turn<00:03:44.660> that<00:03:44.840> off

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:44.990 
filter and a PHY I want to turn that off

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:47.440 
filter and a PHY I want to turn that off
it<00:03:45.440> sounds<00:03:45.740> much<00:03:45.890> better<00:03:45.920> i<00:03:46.490> I<00:03:46.970> think<00:03:47.240> that

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
it sounds much better i I think that

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.570 
it sounds much better i I think that
subwoofer<00:03:48.080> up<00:03:48.230> there<00:03:48.470> handles<00:03:49.250> some<00:03:49.430> of<00:03:49.460> the

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:49.580 
subwoofer up there handles some of the

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.260 
subwoofer up there handles some of the
higher<00:03:49.850> frequencies<00:03:50.480> a<00:03:50.510> little<00:03:50.840> bit<00:03:50.960> to<00:03:52.270> this

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:53.270 
higher frequencies a little bit to this

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:55.660 
higher frequencies a little bit to this
will<00:03:53.930> fit<00:03:54.170> underneath<00:03:54.530> the<00:03:54.740> seat<00:03:54.980> but<00:03:55.220> I<00:03:55.250> think

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
will fit underneath the seat but I think

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.860 
will fit underneath the seat but I think
I'm<00:03:55.790> going<00:03:55.940> to<00:03:55.970> have<00:03:56.120> to<00:03:56.270> cut<00:03:56.420> a<00:03:56.450> hole<00:03:56.690> in<00:03:57.350> the

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
I'm going to have to cut a hole in the

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.150 
I'm going to have to cut a hole in the
and<00:03:59.870> whatever<00:04:00.080> this<00:04:00.350> thing<00:04:00.590> is<00:04:00.710> called<00:04:00.890> here

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
and whatever this thing is called here

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.410 
and whatever this thing is called here
to<00:04:01.310> get<00:04:01.430> it<00:04:01.550> to<00:04:01.640> fit<00:04:03.160> but<00:04:04.160> that's<00:04:04.730> what<00:04:04.970> so

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 
to get it to fit but that's what so

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.660 
to get it to fit but that's what so
kelly<00:04:05.660> guy<00:04:05.870> 81<00:04:06.350> did<00:04:06.590> and<00:04:06.800> I<00:04:06.830> worked<00:04:07.400> out<00:04:07.490> really

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
kelly guy 81 did and I worked out really

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:09.790 
kelly guy 81 did and I worked out really
good<00:04:07.760> for<00:04:07.910> him<00:04:08.180> so<00:04:08.420> I'll<00:04:09.230> be<00:04:09.410> getting<00:04:09.500> there

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:09.800 
good for him so I'll be getting there

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.020 
good for him so I'll be getting there
soon<00:04:10.390> this<00:04:11.390> is<00:04:11.450> a<00:04:11.920> 200<00:04:12.920> watt<00:04:13.040> amp<00:04:13.370> I<00:04:13.610> think<00:04:13.880> it's

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
soon this is a 200 watt amp I think it's

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:17.140 
soon this is a 200 watt amp I think it's
probably<00:04:14.600> 75<00:04:15.170> watts<00:04:15.410> per<00:04:15.680> channel<00:04:15.709> and<00:04:16.280> I've

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
probably 75 watts per channel and I've

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.449 
probably 75 watts per channel and I've
got<00:04:17.359> it<00:04:17.480> maxed<00:04:17.870> out<00:04:18.019> and<00:04:18.260> it<00:04:18.950> seems<00:04:19.190> to<00:04:19.370> be

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
got it maxed out and it seems to be

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:26.350 
got it maxed out and it seems to be
doing<00:04:19.700> just<00:04:19.730> fine<00:04:24.250> for<00:04:25.250> the<00:04:25.370> amp<00:04:25.820> installed

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
doing just fine for the amp installed

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.890 
doing just fine for the amp installed

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
I used this basket here from Amazon it's

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:35.290 
I used this basket here from Amazon it's
the<00:04:33.680> 4<00:04:33.890> gauge<00:04:34.100> but<00:04:34.490> if<00:04:34.580> you<00:04:34.670> read<00:04:34.820> the<00:04:34.850> reviews

the 4 gauge but if you read the reviews

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.120 
the 4 gauge but if you read the reviews
everyone<00:04:35.750> says<00:04:35.960> it<00:04:36.140> says<00:04:36.320> 4<00:04:36.590> gauge<00:04:36.770> but<00:04:37.040> the

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
everyone says it says 4 gauge but the

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:40.690 
everyone says it says 4 gauge but the
wire<00:04:37.250> is<00:04:37.370> really<00:04:37.580> 8<00:04:37.790> gauge<00:04:38.060> and<00:04:38.950> and<00:04:39.950> the<00:04:40.550> wire

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:40.700 
wire is really 8 gauge and and the wire

wire is really 8 gauge and and the wire
and<00:04:40.910> it<00:04:41.030> really<00:04:41.300> is<00:04:41.419> garbage

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
and it really is garbage

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.930

it's<00:04:43.550> the<00:04:44.830> installation<00:04:45.830> on<00:04:45.950> it<00:04:46.160> is<00:04:46.340> it's

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
it's the installation on it is it's

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:50.890 
it's the installation on it is it's
thick<00:04:47.390> but<00:04:47.630> it's<00:04:47.900> cheap<00:04:48.290> and<00:04:48.500> chintzy<00:04:49.720> and<00:04:50.720> I

thick but it's cheap and chintzy and I
don't<00:04:51.020> think<00:04:51.260> it'll<00:04:51.380> hold<00:04:51.560> up<00:04:51.740> very<00:04:51.770> good<00:04:52.660> I'm

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:53.660 
don't think it'll hold up very good I'm

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:55.300 
don't think it'll hold up very good I'm
not<00:04:53.720> sure<00:04:54.050> I<00:04:54.080> would<00:04:54.200> recommend<00:04:54.710> it<00:04:54.830> I'm<00:04:54.980> afraid

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310 
not sure I would recommend it I'm afraid

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.000 
not sure I would recommend it I'm afraid
