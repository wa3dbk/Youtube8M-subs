00:00:03.069 --> 00:00:05.889 

hi<00:00:04.069> my<00:00:04.399> name's<00:00:04.609> Tom<00:00:04.880> welcome<00:00:05.420> to<00:00:05.540> QuickBooks

hi my name's Tom welcome to QuickBooks

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:09.129 
hi my name's Tom welcome to QuickBooks
weekly<00:00:06.319> and<00:00:06.559> this<00:00:06.799> is<00:00:06.980> the<00:00:07.279> fourth<00:00:08.209> lesson<00:00:08.750> in

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:09.139 
weekly and this is the fourth lesson in

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:11.500 
weekly and this is the fourth lesson in
a<00:00:09.200> miniseries<00:00:09.740> I'm<00:00:10.040> doing<00:00:10.340> on<00:00:10.490> the<00:00:10.639> fourth

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:11.510 
a miniseries I'm doing on the fourth

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:15.400 
a miniseries I'm doing on the fourth
tuning<00:00:12.020> so<00:00:12.230> EAD<00:00:12.910> GCF<00:00:13.910> tuning<00:00:14.660> for<00:00:14.840> guitar<00:00:15.139> and

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:15.410 
tuning so EAD GCF tuning for guitar and

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:16.359 
tuning so EAD GCF tuning for guitar and
this<00:00:15.559> let's<00:00:15.740> we're<00:00:15.830> going<00:00:15.949> to<00:00:16.010> be<00:00:16.070> looking<00:00:16.129> at

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:16.369 
this let's we're going to be looking at

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:18.310 
this let's we're going to be looking at
arpeggios<00:00:17.119> in<00:00:17.390> this<00:00:17.510> tuning<00:00:17.869> so<00:00:18.020> before<00:00:18.260> we

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:18.320 
arpeggios in this tuning so before we

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.470 
arpeggios in this tuning so before we
get<00:00:18.439> started<00:00:18.560> you<00:00:19.280> keep<00:00:19.490> your<00:00:19.640> low<00:00:20.210> for

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480 
get started you keep your low for

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:21.820 
get started you keep your low for
Strings<00:00:20.780> exactly<00:00:21.230> the<00:00:21.320> same<00:00:21.500> and<00:00:21.590> then<00:00:21.710> we've

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:21.830 
Strings exactly the same and then we've

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.460 
Strings exactly the same and then we've
got<00:00:21.860> instead<00:00:22.400> of<00:00:22.460> a<00:00:22.550> B<00:00:22.700> string<00:00:22.970> we've<00:00:23.090> got<00:00:23.270> see

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
got instead of a B string we've got see

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.390 
got instead of a B string we've got see
and<00:00:26.470> instead<00:00:26.740> of<00:00:26.800> a<00:00:26.950> string<00:00:27.820> we've<00:00:27.940> gone<00:00:28.120> f

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:30.400 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.339 

so<00:00:31.060> basically<00:00:31.420> tuning<00:00:31.810> those<00:00:31.960> up<00:00:32.140> one

00:00:32.339 --> 00:00:32.349 
so basically tuning those up one

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:34.080 
so basically tuning those up one
semitone<00:00:32.739> or<00:00:33.010> one<00:00:33.160> frappe<00:00:33.460> or<00:00:33.700> you<00:00:33.850> can<00:00:34.030> just

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:34.090 
semitone or one frappe or you can just

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.880 
semitone or one frappe or you can just
turn<00:00:34.300> them<00:00:34.450> off<00:00:34.630> 5th<00:00:35.350> string<00:00:35.970> trick<00:00:36.970> for<00:00:37.150> every

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
turn them off 5th string trick for every

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.770 
turn them off 5th string trick for every
every<00:00:38.890> 5th<00:00:39.640> fret<00:00:39.760> trick<00:00:40.090> for<00:00:40.239> every<00:00:40.510> string

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:40.780 
every 5th fret trick for every string

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.040 
every 5th fret trick for every string
basically<00:00:41.350> to<00:00:41.559> to<00:00:41.770> get<00:00:41.890> up<00:00:42.040> to<00:00:42.510> over<00:00:43.510> to<00:00:43.809> pitch

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.050 
basically to to get up to over to pitch

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.020 
basically to to get up to over to pitch
so<00:00:44.770> the<00:00:45.040> arpeggio<00:00:45.340> that<00:00:45.670> we're<00:00:45.790> going<00:00:45.910> to<00:00:45.970> be

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.030 
so the arpeggio that we're going to be

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.229 
so the arpeggio that we're going to be
doing<00:00:46.270> or<00:00:46.960> looking<00:00:47.290> at<00:00:47.410> today<00:00:47.650> is<00:00:48.220> a<00:00:48.790> dominant

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:49.239 
doing or looking at today is a dominant

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:50.939 
doing or looking at today is a dominant
7<00:00:49.690> arpeggio<00:00:49.930> but<00:00:50.230> I'm<00:00:50.290> just<00:00:50.410> kind<00:00:50.589> of<00:00:50.620> a<00:00:50.710> quick

00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:50.949 
7 arpeggio but I'm just kind of a quick

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:52.680 
7 arpeggio but I'm just kind of a quick
word<00:00:51.190> about<00:00:51.220> our<00:00:51.460> pages<00:00:51.850> in<00:00:52.120> general<00:00:52.480> in<00:00:52.570> this

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.690 
word about our pages in general in this

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.650 
word about our pages in general in this
tuning<00:00:53.050> they<00:00:53.589> are<00:00:53.940> maybe<00:00:54.940> even<00:00:55.210> more<00:00:55.360> so<00:00:55.420> than

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:55.660 
tuning they are maybe even more so than

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.479 
tuning they are maybe even more so than
scales<00:00:55.960> the<00:00:56.170> things<00:00:56.379> that<00:00:56.530> really<00:00:56.890> open<00:00:57.370> up

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:57.489 
scales the things that really open up

00:00:57.489 --> 00:00:59.850 
scales the things that really open up
with<00:00:57.879> this<00:00:58.030> new<00:00:58.300> pattern<00:00:58.750> basically<00:00:59.320> there's

00:00:59.850 --> 00:00:59.860 
with this new pattern basically there's

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.170 
with this new pattern basically there's
an<00:00:59.920> arpeggio<00:01:00.160> that<00:01:00.430> I<00:01:00.489> used<00:01:00.699> to<00:01:00.790> like<00:01:00.910> to<00:01:01.030> do

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:01.180 
an arpeggio that I used to like to do

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:02.910 
an arpeggio that I used to like to do
since<00:01:01.420> that<00:01:01.600> the<00:01:01.750> start<00:01:02.019> of<00:01:02.110> them<00:01:02.290> it's

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
since that the start of them it's

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.570 
since that the start of them it's
similar<00:01:03.220> to<00:01:03.339> the<00:01:03.519> start<00:01:03.760> of<00:01:03.940> the<00:01:05.430> prowl<00:01:06.430> huge

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:06.580 
similar to the start of the prowl huge

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.219 
similar to the start of the prowl huge
here<00:01:06.880> in<00:01:06.970> all<00:01:07.060> the<00:01:07.180> final<00:01:07.420> fantasy<00:01:07.750> games<00:01:07.960> and

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:08.229 
here in all the final fantasy games and

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:09.990 
here in all the final fantasy games and
which<00:01:08.890> go<00:01:09.070> which<00:01:09.369> sounds<00:01:09.549> something<00:01:09.850> like

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
which go which sounds something like

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.050 
which go which sounds something like
this<00:01:13.170> which<00:01:14.170> is<00:01:14.320> a<00:01:14.350> major<00:01:14.799> second<00:01:15.400> or<00:01:15.549> or<00:01:15.820> major

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
this which is a major second or or major

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.320 
this which is a major second or or major
90<00:01:16.630> peggio<00:01:17.320> but<00:01:17.979> it<00:01:18.640> was<00:01:18.760> very<00:01:18.970> difficult<00:01:19.119> to

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.330 
90 peggio but it was very difficult to

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.030 
90 peggio but it was very difficult to
do<00:01:19.450> before<00:01:19.780> because<00:01:20.020> when<00:01:20.200> you<00:01:20.290> got<00:01:20.470> to<00:01:20.710> the

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040 
do before because when you got to the

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.810 
do before because when you got to the
wall<00:01:21.520> stream<00:01:22.799> you<00:01:23.799> needed<00:01:24.040> to<00:01:24.159> move<00:01:24.490> up<00:01:24.700> a

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
wall stream you needed to move up a

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.450 
wall stream you needed to move up a
friend<00:01:25.680> obviously<00:01:26.680> in<00:01:26.799> this<00:01:26.890> tune<00:01:27.100> you<00:01:27.280> don't

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
friend obviously in this tune you don't

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:28.560 
friend obviously in this tune you don't
have<00:01:27.580> to<00:01:27.670> do<00:01:27.760> that<00:01:27.790> because<00:01:28.119> the<00:01:28.299> pattern

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
have to do that because the pattern

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.249 
have to do that because the pattern
continues<00:01:29.820> on<00:01:30.820> so<00:01:31.420> that<00:01:31.570> was<00:01:31.750> the<00:01:31.869> exciting

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:32.259 
continues on so that was the exciting

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:33.870 
continues on so that was the exciting
initial<00:01:32.710> thing<00:01:32.920> the<00:01:33.070> second<00:01:33.369> I<00:01:33.400> picked<00:01:33.610> up<00:01:33.700> is

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
initial thing the second I picked up is

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.910 
initial thing the second I picked up is
cheating<00:01:34.180> and<00:01:34.330> then<00:01:34.810> everything<00:01:35.200> started<00:01:35.740> to

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
cheating and then everything started to

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.800 
cheating and then everything started to
open<00:01:36.190> up<00:01:36.490> more<00:01:36.700> and<00:01:36.850> more<00:01:36.940> and<00:01:37.060> there's<00:01:37.720> a

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
open up more and more and there's a

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.690 
open up more and more and there's a
shape<00:01:38.080> that<00:01:38.110> I<00:01:38.500> like<00:01:38.710> to<00:01:38.830> do<00:01:38.980> is<00:01:39.010> sort<00:01:39.370> of<00:01:39.490> the

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
shape that I like to do is sort of the

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.640 
shape that I like to do is sort of the
c-shape<00:01:40.570> if<00:01:40.810> you're<00:01:40.960> thinking<00:01:41.080> in<00:01:41.440> in

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650 
c-shape if you're thinking in in

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.280 
c-shape if you're thinking in in
standard<00:01:42.160> tuning<00:01:42.190> and<00:01:42.640> so<00:01:43.420> you<00:01:43.480> can<00:01:43.750> do<00:01:43.930> a

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290 
standard tuning and so you can do a

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.440 
standard tuning and so you can do a
fifth<00:01:44.830> fret<00:01:45.100> on<00:01:45.130> the<00:01:45.280> E<00:01:45.600> forth<00:01:46.600> on<00:01:46.870> the<00:01:47.290> a

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
fifth fret on the E forth on the a

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.290 
fifth fret on the E forth on the a
second<00:01:49.450> on<00:01:49.570> the<00:01:49.659> day<00:01:49.690> and<00:01:50.080> then<00:01:50.409> 6<00:01:50.620> on<00:01:51.340> the<00:01:51.820> D

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:52.300 
second on the day and then 6 on the D

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.040 
second on the day and then 6 on the D
for<00:01:53.020> a<00:01:53.050> major<00:01:53.230> 7<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:54.909> then<00:01:55.150> move<00:01:55.360> that<00:01:55.659> up<00:01:55.840> one

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.050 
for a major 7 and then move that up one

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:08.040 
for a major 7 and then move that up one

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
fret saw the whole pan again you can

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.410 
fret saw the whole pan again you can
flatten<00:02:08.349> that<00:02:08.500> seventh<00:02:09.069> and<00:02:09.340> that<00:02:09.909> seventh

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
flatten that seventh and that seventh

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.360 
flatten that seventh and that seventh
interval<00:02:11.260> which<00:02:11.409> would<00:02:11.530> be<00:02:11.620> on<00:02:11.800> the<00:02:11.890> 6th<00:02:12.159> fret

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
interval which would be on the 6th fret

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.910

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
and in keeping with that you can keep

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:22.259 
and in keeping with that you can keep
that<00:02:20.260> up<00:02:20.440> in<00:02:20.620> Gion<00:02:20.860> flatten<00:02:21.190> the<00:02:21.280> major<00:02:21.640> 3rd<00:02:21.970> on

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
minus 7 arpeggios so everything's a lot

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.930 
minus 7 arpeggios so everything's a lot
more<00:02:32.349> visual<00:02:32.769> that's<00:02:33.190> the<00:02:33.340> arpeggio<00:02:33.580> going<00:02:33.879> to

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
more visual that's the arpeggio going to

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:34.949 
more visual that's the arpeggio going to
look<00:02:34.090> at<00:02:34.239> today<00:02:34.360> we're<00:02:34.540> going<00:02:34.629> to<00:02:34.690> look<00:02:34.780> at<00:02:34.870> the

look at today we're going to look at the

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.410 
look at today we're going to look at the
dominant<00:02:35.410> one<00:02:35.440> and<00:02:36.120> because<00:02:37.120> everything

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
dominant one and because everything

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.000 
dominant one and because everything
repeats<00:02:37.750> naturally<00:02:38.290> it<00:02:38.379> makes<00:02:38.560> makes

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.770 
thinking in terms of arpeggios over
courts<00:02:41.379> a<00:02:41.440> lot<00:02:41.620> easier<00:02:41.799> this<00:02:42.220> is<00:02:42.370> one<00:02:42.549> I've

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
courts a lot easier this is one I've

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.030 
courts a lot easier this is one I've
enjoyed<00:02:43.780> a<00:02:43.840> lot<00:02:44.019> so<00:02:44.260> we're<00:02:44.799> going<00:02:44.920> to<00:02:44.980> be

picking<00:02:55.569> for<00:02:55.870> that<00:02:55.959> i'm<00:02:56.110> doing<00:02:56.380> is<00:03:03.900> a<00:03:04.900> little

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
picking for that i'm doing is a little

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.050 
picking for that i'm doing is a little
bit<00:03:05.620> better<00:03:05.739> on<00:03:05.860> electric<00:03:06.340> but<00:03:06.549> all<00:03:06.670> my<00:03:06.790> toe<00:03:06.849> of

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
bit better on electric but all my toe of

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.520 
bit better on electric but all my toe of
electrics<00:03:07.569> are<00:03:07.690> getting<00:03:08.019> really<00:03:08.110> strong<00:03:08.470> and

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
electrics are getting really strong and

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.319 
electrics are getting really strong and
all<00:03:08.769> that<00:03:08.920> nonsense<00:03:08.950> at<00:03:09.489> the<00:03:09.549> moment<00:03:09.849> so<00:03:09.879> and

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:10.329 
all that nonsense at the moment so and

all that nonsense at the moment so and
i'm<00:03:11.140> going<00:03:11.379> to<00:03:11.470> be<00:03:11.560> doing<00:03:11.709> down<00:03:12.190> down<00:03:12.579> down<00:03:12.940> up

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
i'm going to be doing down down down up

i'm going to be doing down down down up
slide<00:03:14.410> down<00:03:15.099> town<00:03:15.459> Oh<00:03:15.900> slide

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:22.710 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:25.050 

of<00:03:23.710> course<00:03:23.950> that<00:03:24.100> can<00:03:24.220> move<00:03:24.430> up<00:03:24.640> if<00:03:24.880> we're

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
of course that can move up if we're

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.870 
of course that can move up if we're
doing<00:03:25.210> it<00:03:25.360> in<00:03:25.570> on<00:03:25.810> siding<00:03:26.470> on<00:03:26.530> the<00:03:26.620> a<00:03:26.650> string

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:38.480 

exactly<00:03:30.880> the<00:03:31.030> same<00:03:31.240> shape<00:03:31.630> so<00:03:31.990> give<00:03:32.200> this<00:03:32.290> go

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:38.490 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:40.770 

and<00:03:39.490> try<00:03:39.970> and<00:03:40.090> get<00:03:40.180> a<00:03:40.209> little<00:03:40.390> bit<00:03:40.600> clearer

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
and try and get a little bit clearer

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.810 
and try and get a little bit clearer
than<00:03:40.959> me<00:03:41.140> and<00:03:41.350> hopefully<00:03:42.220> I'm<00:03:42.490> messing<00:03:42.730> around

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:42.820 
than me and hopefully I'm messing around

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.490 
than me and hopefully I'm messing around
with<00:03:43.060> our<00:03:43.150> pedos<00:03:43.570> if<00:03:43.720> it<00:03:43.840> hasn't<00:03:44.110> already<00:03:44.170> with

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
with our pedos if it hasn't already with

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.560 
with our pedos if it hasn't already with
scales<00:03:44.770> and<00:03:45.010> cause<00:03:45.190> so<00:03:45.730> you<00:03:45.940> might<00:03:46.120> self<00:03:46.420> get

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:46.570 
scales and cause so you might self get

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:48.330 
scales and cause so you might self get
that<00:03:46.720> light<00:03:46.990> bulb<00:03:47.200> Eureka<00:03:47.709> moment<00:03:48.070> when<00:03:48.220> you

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
that light bulb Eureka moment when you

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.910 
that light bulb Eureka moment when you
solve<00:03:48.610> maybe<00:03:49.390> appreciate<00:03:49.990> that<00:03:50.260> this<00:03:50.470> this

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
solve maybe appreciate that this this

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.190 
solve maybe appreciate that this this
tuning<00:03:51.400> is<00:03:51.730> a<00:03:52.060> little<00:03:52.420> bit<00:03:52.510> more<00:03:52.630> logical<00:03:53.110> in

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
tuning is a little bit more logical in

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.190 
tuning is a little bit more logical in
terms<00:03:53.410> of<00:03:53.590> fretboard<00:03:54.930> harmony<00:03:55.930> and<00:03:56.020> things

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
terms of fretboard harmony and things

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.680 
terms of fretboard harmony and things
like<00:03:56.380> that<00:03:56.440> so<00:03:57.100> a<00:03:57.130> little<00:03:57.459> bit<00:03:57.640> of<00:03:57.700> a<00:03:57.910> quick<00:03:58.660> a
