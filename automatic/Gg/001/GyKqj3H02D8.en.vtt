claim that they are 100% compostable but
SunChips<00:01:09.570> can<00:01:09.780> but<00:01:10.680> there<00:01:10.920> is<00:01:11.070> a<00:01:11.100> downfall<00:01:11.520> to

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
SunChips can but there is a downfall to

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.899 
SunChips can but there is a downfall to
this<00:01:12.150> technology<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.830> downfall<00:01:14.070> is<00:01:14.310> this

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
this technology and the downfall is this

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.770 
this technology and the downfall is this
bag<00:01:15.299> is<00:01:15.720> freaking<00:01:16.530> loud<00:01:17.330> I'm<00:01:18.330> holding<00:01:18.689> it

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
bag is freaking loud I'm holding it

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:19.999 
bag is freaking loud I'm holding it
pretty<00:01:18.990> steady<00:01:19.320> because<00:01:19.590> I<00:01:19.650> don't<00:01:19.799> want<00:01:19.920> to

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
pretty steady because I don't want to

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.140 
pretty steady because I don't want to
give<00:01:20.130> it<00:01:20.220> away<00:01:20.310> but<00:01:20.490> we're<00:01:20.790> going<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:21.000> do<00:01:21.119> a

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
give it away but we're going to do a

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.480 
give it away but we're going to do a
little<00:01:21.360> scientific<00:01:21.900> test<00:01:22.140> today<00:01:22.409> I've<00:01:23.250> got

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
little scientific test today I've got

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.330 
little scientific test today I've got
with<00:01:23.759> me<00:01:23.790> right<00:01:24.570> here<00:01:24.810> this<00:01:25.110> is<00:01:25.170> a<00:01:25.350> decimal

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
with me right here this is a decimal

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.609 
with me right here this is a decimal
meter<00:01:26.610> for<00:01:26.850> RadioShack<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:27.720> I've<00:01:28.409> got<00:01:28.590> a

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
meter for RadioShack and I've got a

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.980 
meter for RadioShack and I've got a
regular<00:01:28.890> bag<00:01:29.189> of<00:01:29.340> chips<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:29.759> a<00:01:30.509> bag<00:01:30.689> of<00:01:30.720> Sun

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
regular bag of chips and a bag of Sun

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.060 
regular bag of chips and a bag of Sun
chips<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.380> we're<00:01:31.500> just<00:01:31.650> going<00:01:31.799> to<00:01:31.890> see

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
chips and we're just going to see

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.969 
chips and we're just going to see
exactly<00:01:32.939> how<00:01:33.119> many<00:01:33.390> decibels<00:01:34.110> this<00:01:34.710> thing

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
exactly how many decibels this thing

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.950 
exactly how many decibels this thing
puts<00:01:35.280> out<00:01:35.460> just<00:01:35.729> from<00:01:35.850> normal<00:01:36.090> crinkling<00:01:36.720> so

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
puts out just from normal crinkling so

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.080 
puts out just from normal crinkling so
let's<00:01:37.710> get<00:01:37.860> started<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.310> test<00:01:38.579> I've<00:01:38.909> got

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
let's get started the test I've got

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.340 
let's get started the test I've got
another<00:01:39.299> camera<00:01:39.600> over<00:01:39.840> here<00:01:40.020> that's<00:01:40.200> going<00:01:40.229> to

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
another camera over here that's going to

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.380 
another camera over here that's going to
measure<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.860> decibel<00:01:41.790> readings<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.270> I'll

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
measure the decibel readings and I'll

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.050 
measure the decibel readings and I'll
just<00:01:42.540> set<00:01:42.720> this<00:01:42.840> baby<00:01:43.020> up<00:01:43.290> here<00:01:43.500> and<00:01:43.790> I'll<00:01:44.790> grab

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
just set this baby up here and I'll grab

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.139 
just set this baby up here and I'll grab
my<00:01:45.090> other<00:01:45.270> potato<00:01:45.750> chips<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.430> now<00:01:47.430> give<00:01:47.970> it<00:01:48.000> a

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
my other potato chips and now give it a

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.520 
my other potato chips and now give it a
whirl<00:01:48.299> to<00:01:48.450> see<00:01:48.600> what<00:01:48.720> happens<00:01:49.049> so<00:01:49.170> these<00:01:49.380> are

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
whirl to see what happens so these are

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.700 
whirl to see what happens so these are
Tostitos<00:01:50.100> scoops<00:01:50.310> family<00:01:51.299> size<00:01:51.540> let's<00:01:52.530> turn

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
Tostitos scoops family size let's turn

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.649 
Tostitos scoops family size let's turn
to<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.920> decibel<00:01:53.490> meter<00:01:53.610> on<00:01:53.880> right<00:01:54.149> now<00:01:54.329> and

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
to the decibel meter on right now and

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.749 
to the decibel meter on right now and
we'll<00:01:55.590> take<00:01:55.619> a<00:01:55.860> look<00:01:56.070> I'll<00:01:56.189> set<00:01:56.399> that<00:01:56.549> 80

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
we'll take a look I'll set that 80

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.660 
we'll take a look I'll set that 80
decibels<00:01:57.000> and<00:01:57.500> I'll<00:01:58.500> start<00:01:58.920> crackling<00:01:59.549> we'll

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
decibels and I'll start crackling we'll

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:06.610 
decibels and I'll start crackling we'll

and we'll take a look at 14 weeks later
see<00:04:01.769> if<00:04:01.829> it<00:04:01.920> actually<00:04:02.120> composted<00:04:03.120> but<00:04:03.269> way<00:04:03.900> to

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
see if it actually composted but way to
