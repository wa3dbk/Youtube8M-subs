00:02:57.369 --> 00:02:57.379 
but I like the inclusion of the base I'm

00:02:57.379 --> 00:02:59.319 
but I like the inclusion of the base I'm
always<00:02:57.560> a<00:02:57.680> sucker<00:02:57.890> for<00:02:58.010> display<00:02:58.609> basis<00:02:59.060> when

00:02:59.319 --> 00:02:59.329 
always a sucker for display basis when

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:01.869 
always a sucker for display basis when

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:01.879

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:04.720 
done right and I think this display base
was<00:03:02.150> done<00:03:02.390> right<00:03:02.810> I<00:03:03.370> think<00:03:04.370> I'll<00:03:04.430> look<00:03:04.519> at<00:03:04.640> the

00:05:59.270 --> 00:05:59.280 
to have too much mobility in the legs

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:02.180 
to have too much mobility in the legs
the<00:06:00.210> waist<00:06:00.510> and<00:06:00.870> really<00:06:01.590> essentially<00:06:01.950> this

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:02.190 
the waist and really essentially this

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:03.980 
the waist and really essentially this
section<00:06:02.580> right<00:06:02.700> here<00:06:02.760> you<00:06:03.450> can<00:06:03.600> still<00:06:03.810> get<00:06:03.960> a

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:03.990 
section right here you can still get a

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:06.380 
section right here you can still get a
lot<00:06:04.050> of<00:06:04.260> poses<00:06:04.710> in<00:06:04.890> his<00:06:05.100> arms<00:06:05.550> and<00:06:05.760> also<00:06:06.210> in<00:06:06.300> his

lot of poses in his arms and also in his
hands<00:06:06.930> and<00:06:07.590> I<00:06:07.890> think<00:06:08.160> for<00:06:08.430> a<00:06:08.610> figure<00:06:09.240> that<00:06:09.390> is

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:09.690 
hands and I think for a figure that is

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:12.740 
hands and I think for a figure that is
more<00:06:10.080> of<00:06:10.170> a<00:06:10.290> showpiece<00:06:10.710> of<00:06:11.460> a<00:06:11.730> display<00:06:12.240> piece<00:06:12.480> I

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:12.750 
more of a showpiece of a display piece I

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:16.730 
more of a showpiece of a display piece I
think<00:06:13.470> it<00:06:13.560> actually<00:06:13.860> still<00:06:14.100> works<00:06:15.560> there<00:06:16.560> are

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:16.740 
think it actually still works there are

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:17.930 
think it actually still works there are
other<00:06:16.890> certainly<00:06:17.400> other<00:06:17.550> figures<00:06:17.910> available

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:17.940 
other certainly other figures available

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:20.630 
other certainly other figures available
that<00:06:18.480> have<00:06:18.690> articulation<00:06:19.590> but<00:06:20.340> when<00:06:20.490> you're

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:20.640 
that have articulation but when you're

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:23.330 
that have articulation but when you're
getting<00:06:20.880> down<00:06:21.030> to<00:06:21.300> just<00:06:21.630> a<00:06:21.840> showpiece<00:06:22.340> show

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:23.340 
getting down to just a showpiece show

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:25.580 
getting down to just a showpiece show
pieces<00:06:23.820> don't<00:06:24.330> always<00:06:24.570> necessarily<00:06:24.930> need<00:06:25.560> to

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:25.590 
pieces don't always necessarily need to

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:27.560 
pieces don't always necessarily need to
have<00:06:25.770> articulation<00:06:26.520> and<00:06:26.790> I<00:06:27.120> would<00:06:27.300> not<00:06:27.420> want

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:27.570 
have articulation and I would not want

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:30.530 
have articulation and I would not want
to<00:06:27.630> sacrifice<00:06:27.890> detail<00:06:28.890> for<00:06:29.610> an<00:06:29.850> articulated

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:30.540 
to sacrifice detail for an articulated

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:31.430 
to sacrifice detail for an articulated
figure<00:06:30.750> because<00:06:30.930> you<00:06:31.020> can<00:06:31.140> always<00:06:31.290> get

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:31.440 
figure because you can always get

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.470 
figure because you can always get
articulated<00:06:32.070> figures<00:06:32.370> but<00:06:32.880> if<00:06:33.000> the<00:06:33.120> sculpt

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:33.480 
articulated figures but if the sculpt

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:36.050 
articulated figures but if the sculpt
isn't<00:06:33.870> there<00:06:34.080> the<00:06:34.980> figure<00:06:35.430> as<00:06:35.640> a<00:06:35.670> whole

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:36.060 
isn't there the figure as a whole

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:38.840 
isn't there the figure as a whole
doesn't<00:06:36.630> work<00:06:36.860> Invisible<00:06:37.860> Man<00:06:37.890> I<00:06:38.130> think<00:06:38.550> works

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:38.850 
doesn't work Invisible Man I think works

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:41.180 
doesn't work Invisible Man I think works
because<00:06:39.300> he<00:06:39.870> does<00:06:40.050> have<00:06:40.260> a<00:06:40.290> good<00:06:40.590> solid

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:41.190 
because he does have a good solid

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:43.670 
because he does have a good solid
sculpt<00:06:41.760> in<00:06:41.880> his<00:06:42.090> suit<00:06:42.450> the<00:06:42.990> paint<00:06:43.320> is<00:06:43.530> all

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:43.680 
sculpt in his suit the paint is all

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.710 
sculpt in his suit the paint is all
there<00:06:43.980> and<00:06:44.190> where<00:06:44.910> he<00:06:45.090> needs<00:06:45.390> to<00:06:45.600> have

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:45.720 
there and where he needs to have

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:49.130 
there and where he needs to have
articulation<00:06:46.290> he<00:06:46.650> has<00:06:46.920> it<00:06:47.190> in<00:06:47.370> his<00:06:47.550> arms<00:06:48.140> I'm

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:49.140 
articulation he has it in his arms I'm

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:50.780 
articulation he has it in his arms I'm
glad<00:06:49.350> he<00:06:49.470> doesn't<00:06:49.560> just<00:06:49.830> have<00:06:49.980> a<00:06:50.010> swivel<00:06:50.400> that

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:50.790 
glad he doesn't just have a swivel that

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:52.460 
glad he doesn't just have a swivel that
you<00:06:50.880> can<00:06:51.030> still<00:06:51.360> actually<00:06:51.540> move<00:06:51.840> the<00:06:51.990> arms<00:06:52.230> out

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:52.470 
you can still actually move the arms out

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:55.040 
you can still actually move the arms out
and<00:06:52.790> between<00:06:53.790> that<00:06:53.940> and<00:06:53.970> moving<00:06:54.450> the<00:06:54.570> hands

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:55.050 
and between that and moving the hands

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:58.940 
and between that and moving the hands
you<00:06:55.230> can<00:06:55.620> still<00:06:55.890> get<00:06:56.130> a<00:06:56.430> really<00:06:57.300> genuine<00:06:57.990> pose

00:06:58.940 --> 00:06:58.950 
you can still get a really genuine pose

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:00.500 
you can still get a really genuine pose
out<00:06:59.250> of<00:06:59.550> the<00:06:59.670> Invisible<00:07:00.120> Man
