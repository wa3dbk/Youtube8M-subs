once you go to the edge it gives you

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.970 
once you go to the edge it gives you
nail<00:00:14.490> a<00:00:14.519> fuller<00:00:14.969> look<00:00:15.210> which<00:00:15.450> is<00:00:15.630> nicer<00:00:15.980> okay

is<00:00:45.059> because<00:00:45.210> this<00:00:45.600> one<00:00:45.870> they<00:00:46.680> do<00:00:46.920> drive<00:00:47.280> a<00:00:47.309> bit

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
is because this one they do drive a bit

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.350 
is because this one they do drive a bit
we<00:00:48.000> just<00:00:48.030> have<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.590> tap<00:00:49.590> it<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.360> eventually

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
we just have to tap it and eventually

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.619 
we just have to tap it and eventually
should<00:00:52.199> come<00:00:52.530> out<00:00:52.610> if<00:00:53.610> it<00:00:53.820> doesn't<00:00:54.239> just<00:00:54.420> get

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
should come out if it doesn't just get

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:03.709 
should come out if it doesn't just get
some<00:00:55.610> nail<00:00:56.610> varnish<00:00:57.090> remover<00:00:57.239> thing<00:01:02.629> ok<00:01:03.629> I<00:01:03.660> got

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
it to come out you might have to dip it

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.149 
it to come out you might have to dip it
in<00:01:05.909> some<00:01:05.939> nail<00:01:06.330> varnish<00:01:06.810> remover<00:01:06.990> like<00:01:07.650> I<00:01:07.890> did

roughly<00:02:33.569> the<00:02:33.780> same<00:02:33.959> size<00:02:34.019> because<00:02:34.530> they<00:02:34.830> will

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
roughly the same size because they will

as you can they're not all going to look
the<00:02:46.170> same<00:02:46.319> but<00:02:46.590> that's<00:02:47.519> the<00:02:47.670> closest<00:02:48.090> with<00:02:48.269> and

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
the same but that's the closest with and

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:55.039 
the same but that's the closest with and
again<00:02:49.130> the<00:02:50.130> next<00:02:50.549> step<00:02:50.970> is<00:02:51.180> to<00:02:53.540> take<00:02:54.540> clearly

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
again the next step is to take clearly

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:57.830 
again the next step is to take clearly
