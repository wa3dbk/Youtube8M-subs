 unlock sequence and is out of 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.629
 you can use your device which is a 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.790
 something that happens people quite a lot 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.750
 have forgotten the default 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.090
 unlock 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.920
 there you will do the following 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:58.559
 preference without a chip without 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:01:00.570

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.629
 the home key and even power on and off 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.629
 The device 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:14.070
 when the device breaks you loose 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.470
 technique on and off remains 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.500
 holding the other two keys and then 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.260
 will open the ricouer module wherever you go 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.510
 until the web option insect luisete with the 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:27.720
 GuerrÃ³n attacker down and confirms 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:31.220

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.220
 I confirm again 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.390
 at the moment it is formatting the entire 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.890

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.810
 you confirm the device and restart it 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.060
 When you call, you're already fully 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.710
 restored from factory exactly when 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.170
 if you buy a new one in the store 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.480
 the first initiation is very time consuming but 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:58.080
 It is normal I will advance the video to not 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:00.690
 become so tired and then when he 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.090
 finishes initializing and will ask for all 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.760
 android initial settings 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.920
 it is only you to configure your mode and 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.880
 hugging on your device will be
