00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
think if you go the other way it's very

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.010 
think if you go the other way it's very
selfish<00:00:37.770> yeah<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:38.940> especially<00:00:39.120> for<00:00:39.629> Scotland

selfish yeah and especially for Scotland

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.810 
selfish yeah and especially for Scotland
-<00:00:40.140> -<00:00:40.469> when<00:00:40.620> something<00:00:40.920> would<00:00:41.040> be<00:00:41.160> nice<00:00:41.340> it's

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
- - when something would be nice it's

- - when something would be nice it's
actually<00:00:42.120> great<00:00:42.450> so<00:00:42.660> yeah<00:00:42.809> I<00:00:42.840> think<00:00:43.079> that's

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230
