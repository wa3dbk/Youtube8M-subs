00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.269
 do not 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.660
 let's start therefore to make a relationship 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.490
 of terms that we use in common use 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.679
 to understand it is the best possible and 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.230
 so they can be framed in the part of the 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.939
 process that corresponds to each one in 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.610
 first place let's start talking about 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:22.410
 the color space we have it 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.800
 define very well that is the space of 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.990
 lava color 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.419
 the space of color the first of all is a 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.539
 theoretical space is a mathematical space 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:33.010
 three-dimensional where they are 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.579
 all visible colors represented 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.920
 for us it is a generic space of 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:40.960
 human vision is how I like to call it 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.820
 to me because it really is what it is 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.890
 to explain it in a simple way is the 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.780
 space created based on the maximum 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.059
 ability to display the color of 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.829
 every human being if we could find 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:53.649
 a person who was able to see very 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:56.199
 very well for example a very large range 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:58.480
 of reds and another of violets and another of 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:59.949
 green is another one of yellows imagine 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.239
 that we could find a person with 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:03.160
 a different capacity each 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:04.770
 let's imagine that we could extract their 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.179
 capabilities and put them together somewhere 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:08.979
 that place would be the color space lav 

00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:11.770
 that's why I say it's a space of color 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:13.119
 generic human vision besides that 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.610
 you have to know that it is a space of 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:17.259
 three-dimensional color therefore to the being 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.660
 Three-dimensional colors you have to 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:21.310
 represent them with three coordinates 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.450
 what are those three coordinates I say 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.399
 which uses for example adobe 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.520
 photoshop that in this matter is the king 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:29.770
 or the coordinates are the bird the 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.229
 as the very name of the space or of 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:35.320
 otherwise they are x and y minuscule and 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:37.750
 capital letters are the two different forms 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.820
 which is to represent the same 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.619
 coordinates destined to the same space 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.750
 color is exactly the same when 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:46.000
 see in any application 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.069
 coordinates x xii and lowercase and 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.990
 capital letters I insist what you have 

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:52.420
 It really is the same as if you 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:55.060
 they were giving the coordinates l 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.439
 b so there's no problem 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.909
 they are referring to the same numbers 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:59.860
 they can change and they can be different 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:02.110
 but they are referring exactly to 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.270
 the same thing finally and to finish this 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.090
 quick lesson you know that space 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.280
 color lab is an independent space 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.929
 of any device the profiles of 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.760
 color are dependent on the device 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.680
 because they refer to them a 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.930
 color profile x referenced 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.819
 precisely to that to a plotter to a 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.980
 printing system to any medium 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:22.930
 of color reproduction the space of 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.760
 color lab is created based on the 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.739
 ability of human vision so in 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.540
 no moment was thought of a device 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:30.640
 color reproduction is thought of 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.080
 based on the best perception apparatus of the 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.550
 color that is the human eye 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.250
 that's why it is said that the color space 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.300
 lab is independent of the device in 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.220
 Anywhere in any program 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.140
 that you see something that says profile 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.880
 independent of the device refers 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.910
 the space with the lab almost with all 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.910
 security
