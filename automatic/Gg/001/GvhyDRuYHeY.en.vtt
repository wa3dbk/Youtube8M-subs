00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.580
I wanted to see all the postcards that we
designed from scratch, and I

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.900
asked them weekly to be delivered to me and
it's well over 100 a week of

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.779
brand new customers that we're designing for.

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:19.019
So, I got boxes of postcards
brought to my office, and I started looking

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:20.190
through them and they were
beautiful.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:22.280
But I said, "Let me see what the website looks
like."

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.470
It's so
important that when the person receives a

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.840
promotional piece that when they
go to your website there's some congruence

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.210
there, so that it looks like
it's the same company.

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.160
So, I started going to the websites.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.510
It was amazing to me how many
postcards had no website listed, or the website

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.280
was so bad that I
understood why it wasn't listed.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.350
Or it looked really beautiful, but the
whole thing was done in images, so there was

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:58.210
no way for the search engines,
Google, Yahoo, Bing, to find this website,

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:03.160
and there was no way for the
visitor to communicate with you on the website.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.250
There was no place to fill
in my information or ask for more data, no

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:08.970
live chat.

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.009
The Internet is much
more interactive these days, and so I put

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:16.840
my head down and I said, "I guess
we're going to have to do website development

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.999
because people aren't being
taken care of out there."

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:23.380
I said once that I would never ever buy printing
equipment, I would never buy presses.

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.310
"I don't need this big equipment."

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.770
Critical mass, you get to a point where you
better buy the equipment, so

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.009
now I have all these presses, and now we develop
websites.

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:35.909
It's actually
been going fantastic.

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.359
If you look at that, we have over 50,000 customers
and we've been doing it

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:44.179
for a couple of years, we've only developed
about 300 websites so far.

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:45.469
But
300 is a nice, hearty number.

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:48.609
I can tell you that there are many website
development companies out there that never

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:53.599
even touch 100 websites in the
entirety of their careers.

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:56.079
But because we have such a large customer
base,

00:01:56.079 --> 00:02:00.399
we were able to offer it slowly to certain
customers, and it's going quite

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:01.399
well.

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:04.899
It's very important that the website is developed
in such a way that

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:08.440
the search engines can find it, that there
is a way to capture the identity

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:14.120
of the visitor, that it makes the visitor
want to give their contact

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.530
information to you, that there's a flow to
the website.

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:18.659
You're leading them
some place.

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:20.010
You want them to go some place.

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.590
So it can't be too busy.

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.030
So
there's an aesthetic function of the site.

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.860
There's the functionality, the
marketing functionality of the site, how it's

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:28.910
programmed.

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.409
Then, you need to have a blog anymore.

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:34.030
I know that sounds horrible, because
who wants to sit and write a blog all the

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.030
time?

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.159
But if you update it even
once a month, that's going to help the search

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:38.159
engines find you.

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:40.560
A blog just
stands for web log.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.140
It's just a page that you can upload information
on

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.590
yourself, and it just scrolls down in chronological
order of when you post

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.840
things so that you can maybe, post testimonials
on that page.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.380
You can post
anything you learned in your business that

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.560
you think would be very helpful
to the customer, even if it's just a few sentences.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.439
I'm sure that all of
you have an experience where you worked with

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:08.650
a customer and it was really
terrific the way you handled something.

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.040
That would help somebody in your
industry, a customer.

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.390
You want to write things that's going to help
the

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:15.620
customers, right?

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.519
So if you can tell a story...

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:18.670
You don't have to be a
great writer.

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.920
People appreciate conversational writing,
so I'm trying to

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.409
take the horribleness out of blogging.

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:25.269
But it's actually pretty good once
you get rolling on it.

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:28.520
But it's important to have that on your site,
because a site that's updated

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.329
often gets found faster by the search engines.

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:37.060
So now we're also setting up
pay-per-click management for business owners.

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.799
What that is, is you know
when you go to Google, you see at the very

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:44.610
top there's a beiged out area,
where there are sites listed.

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:48.980
Then down the right-hand column of Google,
you'll see sites listed.

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.319
Those people are paying every time you click.

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:54.629
They're paying to be on that first page or
second page.

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:56.590
So, we can help you
set that up.

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.530
We can help you set up Google Analytics, which
is a beautiful

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:00.530
thing.

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.870
Google Analytics is free, and it's basically
some code that's added

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.049
to your site, so that you can go on Google
Analytics, log in, and see how

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:09.510
many people visited your website.

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.709
So when your postcards go out, you can tell
they hit because you get a lot

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:14.249
more people visiting your website.

00:04:14.249 --> 00:04:15.890
Then you can even say, "Wow.

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:20.060
I've had
1,000 people visit, but I've only gotten 100

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:21.060
leads.

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.150
Let's see if we can
tweak the site and make it more comfortable

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.099
for people to give their
contact information."

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:28.699
So you can use Google Analytics even to see
what

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:31.490
pages people are leaving your site from.

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:32.770
Let's say they're on your
homepage.

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:33.980
Then they go to your gallery.

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:35.680
Then they go to your pricing page.

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.300
Then they go to the About Us page, and maybe
they leave from the About Us

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.300
page.

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.000
Well, probably if you don't have a mission
statement, maybe a video

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.050
with you saying something very sincere about
your purpose for helping

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.300
people with their construction needs, that
they'll leave there because they

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.300
didn't like you.

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:53.650
They lost trust in you.

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:57.880
So there are just ways that you
can analyze your site using Google Analytics

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.000
so that you can improve it.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.389
So I hope you've learned a lot from what I've
been telling you in this past

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:05.930
hour in terms of marketing.

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:11.920
But I wasn't expecting you to become a genius
marketer in one hour from listening to me

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:12.920
chat.

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:17.150
So what I'd like to do is
I'd like you to take the opportunity to call

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:21.110
one of my marketing
consultants and let us figure out a campaign

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:26.580
for you because I feel very
confident that we can help you take your business

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:27.600
to the next level.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.690
That
we can help you put a campaign in place that

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:33.550
you can afford that doesn't
break the bank, but you're going to have to

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:37.479
take some trust in us and take
some risks in marketing.

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:40.810
It's never a lay-down.

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:44.150
Take your business to the
next level.

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:46.849
How many quotes do you need to do in order
to make a sale?

00:05:46.849 --> 00:05:49.210
How
many sales do you need to take your company

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:51.940
from where it is now to the
next level?

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.960
What's the average ticket of a job that you
do?

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.810
If you figure
out exactly what you know that you want and

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:00.919
what you need, we can take that
and work it backwards for you and figure out

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:01.580
what campaign is going to get
you there.
