00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.550 
100% and so you know I have
of<00:01:58.740> stuff<00:01:59.460> I<00:01:59.670> shouldn't<00:02:00.360> have<00:02:00.420> had<00:02:00.570> but<00:02:01.380> you

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.260 
know I enjoyed it and then I go back on
the<00:02:04.230> bandwagon<00:02:04.410> so<00:02:05.070> so<00:02:05.580> you<00:02:05.640> know<00:02:05.850> it'll<00:02:06.150> be

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
the bandwagon so so you know it'll be

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.610 
the bandwagon so so you know it'll be
interesting<00:02:06.540> to<00:02:06.780> see<00:02:07.020> what<00:02:07.230> my<00:02:07.380> Bloods
