00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:05.440
 hello youtube friends thank you for 

00:00:03.219 --> 00:00:09.190
 follow my tutorials this time 

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:11.170
 I'm going to do a tutorial on how to use 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:12.690
 a program to be able to record in your 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:15.299
 screen 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.890
 and so for example for example making a 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:21.009
 tutorial and upload it to youtube 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:24.400
 alright I will use a program that is 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:27.270
 the lsm recorder is a program that is 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:30.410
 written in Spanish 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:33.420
 it's quite simple to use and 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.730
 receives very good reviews because the 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.880
 Video quality is pretty enough 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:42.360
 acceptable and I think to do to 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:45.000
 start is ideal well this is the one that 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.380
 I'm currently using to upload 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.160
 my 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:51.540
 my tutorials well what are we going to 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.510
 do now 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:58.160
 before downloading you take your 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.160
 Favorite search you open 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:04.110
 Anyway, I'll leave the link 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.110
 download on the page too 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.120
 here we have it we write it sm 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:19.470
 remember 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:23.580
 download well i use this page you 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:27.190
 I recommend it is very good you can not 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.380
 download many programs of many things 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.800
 It does not have a virus or there is no problem 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.800
 with them 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.700
 we will give you here in free downloads 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.940
 and from here we will download the program 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:47.000
 I already have it 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:49.780
 it's not a program that weighs a lot 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.780
 we open 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:56.720
 and well we have to wait for it to start 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.470
 the discharge 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.470
 one 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.630
 to accept this I recommend removing it 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:15.620
 because you download 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.819
 unnecessary things on the computer 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.190
 that is not what we are looking for 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:22.420
 us now and well me directly 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.420
 you must start downloading 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:30.820
 It would not take long for 30 seconds 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:32.950
 ok me for the download because of course already 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.110
 I have downloaded it and I do not need it 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.640
 but good with this would be 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.200
 downloaded to your computer and already 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.660
 you would have this icon 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.280
 and here would be more program now I'm going to 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.140
 explain a little bit because of course I can not 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.319
 manipulate the program because it would stop 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:50.299
 Record 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:50.299
 I will explain it on this page 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.409
 basically as you use you will see that it is 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:58.220
 very simple here they already explain it but what 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:58.220
 I will explain myself 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.990
 when starting the program we in the 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:05.870
 control panel this 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:08.150
 with which you can make different 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.890
 operations put it in motion would be here 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.480
 new homework 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.710
 this is paused and this is a 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.540
 completion of the program 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:18.900
 at the end of the program what you have 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:21.240
 recorded automatically is saved and 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.790
 would take them to the area where it is 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:26.130
 saved and you can see the video 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.500
 I will be also 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.630
 a little 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.480
 when you start the program before 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.010
 start recording takes you here new 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.030
 recording task that would be what 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.110
 we have given to the beginning here indicates us 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.150
 if we want to record a video of 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.890
 desktop we want to record from a camera 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.260
 Web 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.819
 if we want to record some sound of 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.849
 good desk 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:53.939
 here in general volume you have 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:57.060
 different ways of recording you can put 

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:59.770
 micro how am I using now I know 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:03.010
 from other means 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:05.140
 in this case put micro because if not 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.990
 will come virtually volume and os 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:11.880
 would be the video without volume here 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:11.880
 you can choose the minutes you want 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:18.769
 recording 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:21.019
 and here in capture the size tells you if 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:23.570
 you want to record the entire full screen 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:26.600
 or an exclusive area only of the screen 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:28.160
 well that in this case it would be the 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.199
 only you have to do with the mouse 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:33.349
 would be to select an area that 

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:35.030
 you want like that and in that area exclusively 

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:37.580
 in recording already 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.990
 well then this is more or less what 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.620
 you are going to find and you see that it is not very 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.620
 complicated 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:47.289
 and when you have finished recording what 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.470
 that you want, you just have to give it 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:49.470
 here 

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:53.960
 that comes out on the desktop and would stop 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:55.700
 to record would be as slow 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.440
 you would end the recording and the 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:00.320
 would lead directly to the site where 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:03.129
 it is saved that I in this case 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:06.330
 I will leave here my documents 

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:06.330
 I remembered myself in 

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:10.119
 and here we would have a play down 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.240
 good and that's it 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.949
 and this is all friends then and you 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:20.979
 I could upload it to youtube where 

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:23.080
 you would like as a study then nothing this 

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:25.410
 it's all and until my next tutorial 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.410
 friends
