00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:15.870
 that's nice 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:18.240
 today hair is all about hair 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.090
 colors remover with I show you 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.330
 right in the packaging on the 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.760
 is now just my camera 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:29.590
 I have my hair darker 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.000
 dyed here a photo 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.570
 yes and that was a lie they are not 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.340
 dyed but yes intense 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:42.750
 tinted that means the hair 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.930
 28h should wash this hair color long 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.570
 to keep 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.580
 but it is said that such hair colors never 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.770
 really go out so that's quasi 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:54.550
 quite wrong on the package on it 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:56.290
 is yes and I was very very 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.510
 dissatisfied with this hair color wanted 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:01.090
 have the hair color away and have 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.260
 started my hair with cleaning 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.479
 to wash shampoo 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.090
 anti dandruff shampoo because that's a whole 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:09.670
 especially aggressive I have is what 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:13.330
 it should cause the hair color 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:15.220
 is washed out faster and too 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.630
 Last of all, I then my hair with 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.940
 Washed detergent 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.770
 I would not do that to you at all 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.750
 recommend my hair are after that 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:26.830
 have you been dry, you believe me 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:28.680
 not the last one in any case 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:32.320
 medium 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.000
 what could have helped me was that 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.920
 medium what I found on the internet 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.750
 and what's up with rossmann and 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:44.670
 though carla as before from which brand 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.670
 that's the hot brand name 

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:54.700
 that's exactly what I have in the 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:58.360
 Direction that I removed extra dark 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:04.000
 shades and gatherings that exist 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:05.679
 So also for philipp for lighter things 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.020
 apparently somehow but as I said 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:10.000
 black hair a bit difficult 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.790
 In any case, I have this one 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.270
 process of application very short for you 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.270
 arrested 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:34.439
 that's how the hair looks like right now 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.120
 By the way, she was one of the applications 

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:40.319
 bit brighter the hair are after ge 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:42.239
 I can darken this remedy absolutely 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:44.670
 I do not recommend my hair 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:46.890
 Worsens so the hair is neither 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.780
 become more fragile and dry 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.769
 if they are brittle then it lies 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.599
 Just because I'm in 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:55.109
 had detergent in my hair in it 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:57.540
 20 minutes only thing I say about it 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:03:00.030
 can is that the hair after such way 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:03.359
 Sulfur wants to take care of it 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:10.739
 that the hair color is dissolved in the 

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:12.269
 But I do not care about hair 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:15.420
 Much more important for me now 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:17.069
 bright hair had because if one the 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.689
 do not like it then that it 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:21.150
 dangerous only becomes depressive 

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:22.769
 That's why I wanted that short 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.480
 achieve because quite a lot of people 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.519
 asked what I have a new one now 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.040
 hair color what that already again from 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:29.910
 Hair color is it is almost the distant 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.480
 version 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:35.459
 yes you can almost with my nature 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.620
 hair color compare approximately 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:40.409
 nature only probably with a whole 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.030
 little bit of color in there because 

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:43.470
 I do not know if this scale like 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:47.879
 before now really all out 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:49.229
 washed has well just so 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:52.019
 maybe I could see some of you 

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:53.579
 above all things help those who are now 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:55.979
 just looking for a solution 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:04:01.190
 are her crazy hair color too 

00:03:55.979 --> 00:04:05.129
 but you have to say 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:07.470
 that this only works if you 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:09.690
 your hair color or yours 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:12.150
 nature's hair color is not already with you anyway 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:15.599
 some chemicals have changed 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:18.989
 that means if you, for example, yours 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:23.099
 have brighter hair killed or brighter 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:26.430
 dyed then you do not come up anymore 

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:28.169
 your natural hair color back and 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.909
 Of course, even if their real 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:32.279
 have used hair color so so 

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:33.620
 permanent intense tint this level 3 

00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:37.020
 I would say now 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:38.400
 just as much in each case on the subject 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.080
 my hair 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.600
 I hope you could do something with it 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.550
 start and see you otherwise 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:47.030
 either tomorrow or the day until then 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.030
 bye
