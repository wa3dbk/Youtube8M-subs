00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
over top of the black out there that we

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.940 
over top of the black out there that we
applied<00:01:58.189> starting<00:01:59.189> from<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.640> outer<00:01:59.670> corner

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.249

harder<00:02:09.039> to<00:02:09.069> blend<00:02:09.429> into<00:02:09.819> the<00:02:10.090> inner<00:02:10.239> corner

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:10.629 
harder to blend into the inner corner

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:12.479 
harder to blend into the inner corner
because<00:02:10.810> it's<00:02:11.080> such<00:02:11.260> a<00:02:11.290> different<00:02:11.590> contrast

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
because it's such a different contrast

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:14.910 
because it's such a different contrast
from<00:02:12.790> the<00:02:13.060> inner<00:02:13.360> corner<00:02:13.450> like<00:02:14.410> beige
