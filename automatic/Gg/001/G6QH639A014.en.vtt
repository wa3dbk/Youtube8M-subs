when<00:00:00.659> I<00:00:00.690> think<00:00:00.810> about<00:00:00.989> location<00:00:01.800> awareness

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070 
when I think about location awareness

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.820 
when I think about location awareness
it's<00:00:02.909> taking<00:00:03.870> advantage<00:00:04.259> of<00:00:04.380> the<00:00:04.500> fact<00:00:04.650> that

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
it's taking advantage of the fact that

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.140 
it's taking advantage of the fact that
we're<00:00:05.009> putting<00:00:05.160> in<00:00:05.370> intelligence<00:00:05.940> in

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
we're putting in intelligence in

about<00:00:43.730> that<00:00:45.250> I've<00:00:46.250> been<00:00:46.460> working<00:00:46.879> more<00:00:47.030> and

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
about that I've been working more and

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.240 
about that I've been working more and
more<00:00:47.300> in<00:00:47.449> the<00:00:47.570> area<00:00:47.840> of<00:00:47.900> sensors<00:00:48.410> and<00:00:48.620> in<00:00:48.890> micro

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
more in the area of sensors and in micro

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:50.650 
more in the area of sensors and in micro
electronics<00:00:49.820> and<00:00:50.030> I've<00:00:50.120> seen<00:00:50.360> over<00:00:50.449> the<00:00:50.629> last

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660 
electronics and I've seen over the last

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.140 
electronics and I've seen over the last
couple<00:00:50.900> of<00:00:51.170> years<00:00:51.440> how<00:00:52.059> Electronics<00:00:53.059> is

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:53.150 
couple of years how Electronics is

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.240 
couple of years how Electronics is
getting<00:00:53.420> smaller<00:00:53.809> and<00:00:54.140> cheaper<00:00:54.199> and<00:00:55.129> it's

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
getting smaller and cheaper and it's

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.060 
getting smaller and cheaper and it's
making<00:00:55.519> objects<00:00:56.180> smarter<00:00:56.659> and<00:00:56.979> started<00:00:57.979> me

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
making objects smarter and started me

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.640 
making objects smarter and started me
thinking<00:00:58.460> about<00:00:58.580> what<00:00:59.390> does<00:00:59.479> that<00:00:59.510> mean<00:00:59.989> what

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:00.650 
thinking about what does that mean what

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.350 
thinking about what does that mean what
what<00:01:00.979> does<00:01:01.070> it<00:01:01.190> mean<00:01:01.339> when<00:01:01.519> we<00:01:01.640> can<00:01:01.820> figure<00:01:02.210> out

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:02.360 
what does it mean when we can figure out

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.140 
what does it mean when we can figure out
where<00:01:02.870> every<00:01:03.379> car<00:01:03.650> is<00:01:03.890> or<00:01:04.190> where<00:01:04.580> traffic<00:01:04.850> is

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
where every car is or where traffic is

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.110 
where every car is or where traffic is
or<00:01:05.479> where<00:01:05.870> weather<00:01:06.110> is<00:01:06.260> or<00:01:07.100> even<00:01:07.340> where<00:01:07.760> trash

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:08.120 
or where weather is or even where trash

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.219 
or where weather is or even where trash
is<00:01:08.770> so<00:01:09.770> that<00:01:10.280> took<00:01:10.460> me<00:01:10.670> back<00:01:11.120> here<00:01:11.510> to<00:01:11.900> my<00:01:12.049> alma

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
is so that took me back here to my alma

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:14.620 
is so that took me back here to my alma

patrasche is a really big problem first
of<00:01:20.299> all<00:01:20.450> so<00:01:21.409> the<00:01:21.530> idea<00:01:21.860> was<00:01:22.070> to<00:01:22.190> look<00:01:22.370> at<00:01:22.580> you

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
of all so the idea was to look at you

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:24.819 
of all so the idea was to look at you
know<00:01:23.090> take<00:01:23.570> a<00:01:23.600> location<00:01:24.140> device<00:01:24.409> a<00:01:24.439> small

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:24.829 
know take a location device a small

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:26.770 
know take a location device a small
low-energy<00:01:25.280> thing<00:01:25.969> that<00:01:26.180> can<00:01:26.360> live<00:01:26.570> for<00:01:26.750> a

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
low-energy thing that can live for a

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.270 
low-energy thing that can live for a
long<00:01:26.840> time<00:01:27.200> and<00:01:27.439> tell<00:01:27.590> you<00:01:27.740> in<00:01:27.890> real<00:01:28.039> time

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
long time and tell you in real time

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.190 
long time and tell you in real time
where<00:01:28.490> it<00:01:28.610> is<00:01:28.729> everywhere<00:01:29.509> in<00:01:29.630> the<00:01:29.750> world<00:01:29.780> and

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
where it is everywhere in the world and

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.999 
where it is everywhere in the world and
attach<00:01:30.950> it<00:01:31.130> to<00:01:31.250> garbage<00:01:32.200> can<00:01:33.200> we<00:01:33.350> learn<00:01:33.530> where

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 
attach it to garbage can we learn where

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:35.920 
attach it to garbage can we learn where
our<00:01:34.159> garbage<00:01:34.430> really<00:01:34.700> goes<00:01:34.880> so<00:01:35.359> we<00:01:35.539> developed

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
our garbage really goes so we developed

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.279 
our garbage really goes so we developed
this<00:01:36.020> little<00:01:36.200> tag<00:01:37.390> it's<00:01:38.390> it's<00:01:38.869> cellphone

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:39.289 
this little tag it's it's cellphone

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:43.120 
this little tag it's it's cellphone
based<00:01:39.560> and<00:01:40.299> it<00:01:41.299> can<00:01:41.570> live<00:01:41.840> up<00:01:42.200> to<00:01:42.409> one<00:01:42.770> year<00:01:43.009> on

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
based and it can live up to one year on

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.899 
based and it can live up to one year on
a<00:01:43.219> single<00:01:43.520> charge

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
a single charge

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:46.660 
a single charge
then<00:01:44.630> later<00:01:44.840> we<00:01:45.109> invited<00:01:45.649> several<00:01:46.430> hundred

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
then later we invited several hundred

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.200 
then later we invited several hundred
people<00:01:47.060> in<00:01:47.509> Seattle<00:01:48.259> to<00:01:48.560> collect<00:01:48.890> trash<00:01:49.210> based

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
people in Seattle to collect trash based

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.169 
people in Seattle to collect trash based
on<00:01:50.509> a<00:01:50.539> sort<00:01:51.380> of<00:01:51.469> wedding<00:01:51.979> wish<00:01:52.399> list<00:01:52.640> of<00:01:52.850> trash

00:01:53.169 --> 00:01:53.179 
on a sort of wedding wish list of trash

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:55.770 
on a sort of wedding wish list of trash
we<00:01:53.539> developed<00:01:53.990> with<00:01:54.560> a<00:01:54.619> recycling<00:01:55.280> expert

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
we developed with a recycling expert

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.260 
we developed with a recycling expert
here<00:01:56.780> at<00:01:56.869> MIT<00:01:57.109> so<00:01:57.770> then<00:01:58.070> people<00:01:58.880> threw<00:01:59.090> it<00:01:59.179> away

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
here at MIT so then people threw it away

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.149 
here at MIT so then people threw it away
and<00:01:59.390> the<00:01:59.990> tag<00:02:00.200> started<00:02:00.619> saying<00:02:00.829> where<00:02:01.070> they

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:01.159 
and the tag started saying where they

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:02.349 
and the tag started saying where they
are<00:02:01.310> every<00:02:01.520> once<00:02:01.700> in<00:02:01.820> a<00:02:01.909> while

00:02:02.349 --> 00:02:02.359 
are every once in a while

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:05.349 
are every once in a while
so<00:02:02.869> we<00:02:02.990> got<00:02:03.140> these<00:02:03.289> beautiful<00:02:03.499> maps<00:02:04.009> of<00:02:04.359> flows

00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:05.359 
so we got these beautiful maps of flows

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:07.810 
so we got these beautiful maps of flows
of<00:02:05.539> garbage<00:02:05.899> starting<00:02:06.289> from<00:02:06.409> Seattle<00:02:06.920> through

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
of garbage starting from Seattle through

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
the art system for recycling

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.300 
the art system for recycling
which<00:02:17.900> is<00:02:18.050> why<00:02:18.200> we<00:02:18.380> chose<00:02:18.560> to<00:02:18.740> focus<00:02:18.890> on<00:02:19.220> that

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
which is why we chose to focus on that

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.750 
which is why we chose to focus on that
particular<00:02:19.520> city<00:02:20.090> we<00:02:20.480> wanted<00:02:20.660> to<00:02:20.750> study<00:02:21.290> a

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
particular city we wanted to study a

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.160 
particular city we wanted to study a
complex<00:02:22.760> system<00:02:23.000> what<00:02:23.630> we<00:02:23.720> were<00:02:23.780> looking<00:02:24.140> to

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
complex system what we were looking to

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.750 
complex system what we were looking to
see<00:02:24.470> is<00:02:24.650> what<00:02:24.950> kind<00:02:25.130> of<00:02:25.220> increased<00:02:25.580> awareness

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
see is what kind of increased awareness

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.000 
see is what kind of increased awareness
comes<00:02:26.510> out<00:02:26.720> of<00:02:26.870> it<00:02:26.960> what<00:02:27.110> would<00:02:27.170> happen<00:02:27.530> if<00:02:27.650> if

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
comes out of it what would happen if if

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.130 
comes out of it what would happen if if
you<00:02:28.550> know<00:02:28.640> this<00:02:28.760> plastic<00:02:29.270> cup<00:02:29.450> that<00:02:29.810> I<00:02:29.840> threw

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
you know this plastic cup that I threw

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.210 
you know this plastic cup that I threw
away<00:02:30.170> what<00:02:30.950> happened

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
away what happened

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:32.890 
away what happened
if<00:02:31.280> I<00:02:31.370> knew<00:02:31.580> that<00:02:31.610> it<00:02:31.850> actually<00:02:32.300> sits<00:02:32.540> in<00:02:32.840> a

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
if I knew that it actually sits in a

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.960 
if I knew that it actually sits in a
place<00:02:33.110> not<00:02:33.380> far<00:02:33.560> away<00:02:33.710> and<00:02:34.610> it's<00:02:34.760> actually

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
place not far away and it's actually

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:35.620 
place not far away and it's actually
gonna<00:02:35.120> stay<00:02:35.300> there

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
gonna stay there

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.470 
gonna stay there
would<00:02:35.840> it<00:02:35.930> make<00:02:36.140> me<00:02:36.320> rethink<00:02:36.860> my<00:02:36.920> actions<00:02:37.520> next

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
would it make me rethink my actions next

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.020 
would it make me rethink my actions next
time<00:02:38.690> so<00:02:39.020> the<00:02:39.830> capacity<00:02:40.370> for<00:02:40.550> behavioral

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
time so the capacity for behavioral

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.120 
time so the capacity for behavioral
change<00:02:41.420> was<00:02:42.020> one<00:02:42.230> interesting<00:02:42.380> aspect<00:02:42.770> that

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
change was one interesting aspect that

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.240 
change was one interesting aspect that
we<00:02:43.190> were<00:02:43.280> looking<00:02:43.430> at<00:02:43.810> with<00:02:44.810> this<00:02:44.990> project<00:02:45.260> and

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
we were looking at with this project and

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.840 
we were looking at with this project and
we<00:02:46.400> had<00:02:46.580> hundreds<00:02:47.420> of<00:02:47.510> emails<00:02:47.900> a<00:02:48.050> week<00:02:48.850> from

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
we had hundreds of emails a week from

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.100 
we had hundreds of emails a week from
people<00:02:50.150> who<00:02:50.240> wanted<00:02:50.510> to<00:02:50.570> know<00:02:50.810> where<00:02:50.990> their

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
people who wanted to know where their

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.600 
people who wanted to know where their
trash<00:02:51.380> really<00:02:51.740> goes<00:02:51.950> and<00:02:52.310> people<00:02:52.550> were

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
trash really goes and people were

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.580 
trash really goes and people were
interested<00:02:52.820> in<00:02:53.030> particular<00:02:53.570> things<00:02:53.900> people

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
interested in particular things people

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.560 
interested in particular things people
wanted<00:02:54.980> to<00:02:55.010> know<00:02:55.250> first<00:02:55.610> of<00:02:55.790> all<00:02:55.910> he's<00:02:56.300> really

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570 
wanted to know first of all he's really

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:58.870 
wanted to know first of all he's really
getting<00:02:56.660> recycled<00:02:57.290> people<00:02:57.950> said<00:02:58.160> in<00:02:58.430> the<00:02:58.640> past

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
getting recycled people said in the past

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.240 
getting recycled people said in the past
throw<00:02:59.480> to<00:02:59.600> the<00:02:59.690> garbage<00:02:59.990> forget<00:03:00.440> about<00:03:00.530> it<00:03:00.830> now

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
throw to the garbage forget about it now

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.190 
throw to the garbage forget about it now
you<00:03:01.310> throw<00:03:01.520> to<00:03:01.580> the<00:03:01.700> garbage<00:03:01.960> it's<00:03:02.960> still

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
you throw to the garbage it's still

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.430 
you throw to the garbage it's still
yours<00:03:03.910> the<00:03:04.910> trace<00:03:05.240> shows<00:03:05.600> you<00:03:06.230> where<00:03:06.350> it<00:03:06.410> goes

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
yours the trace shows you where it goes

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.230 
yours the trace shows you where it goes
you<00:03:06.709> follow<00:03:07.010> it<00:03:07.280> there<00:03:07.610> is<00:03:07.670> still<00:03:07.880> some<00:03:08.150> kind

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:08.240 
you follow it there is still some kind

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.030 
you follow it there is still some kind
of<00:03:08.360> a<00:03:08.480> relationship<00:03:08.690> and<00:03:09.260> I<00:03:09.410> think<00:03:09.620> that<00:03:09.770> ties

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
of a relationship and I think that ties

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.300 
of a relationship and I think that ties
directly<00:03:10.420> to<00:03:11.420> the<00:03:11.959> sort<00:03:12.320> of<00:03:12.350> possibility<00:03:13.040> for

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
directly to the sort of possibility for

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.970 
directly to the sort of possibility for
a<00:03:13.840> behavioral<00:03:14.840> change<00:03:15.110> or<00:03:15.290> at<00:03:15.380> least<00:03:15.530> greater

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
a behavioral change or at least greater

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.010 
a behavioral change or at least greater
awareness<00:03:16.190> about<00:03:16.910> our<00:03:17.240> impact<00:03:17.750> on<00:03:17.959> the

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.020 
awareness about our impact on the

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:22.480 
awareness about our impact on the
environment<00:03:20.920> location<00:03:21.920> awareness<00:03:22.160> is

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:22.490 
environment location awareness is

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:24.610 
environment location awareness is
actually<00:03:22.820> a<00:03:22.850> projection<00:03:23.060> of<00:03:23.510> human<00:03:23.870> curiosity

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
actually a projection of human curiosity

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.160 
actually a projection of human curiosity
into<00:03:25.280> the<00:03:25.400> material<00:03:26.000> world<00:03:26.270> we<00:03:26.540> can<00:03:26.810> extend

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
into the material world we can extend

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.470 
into the material world we can extend
our<00:03:27.410> vision<00:03:28.070> we<00:03:28.280> can<00:03:28.310> extend<00:03:28.730> our<00:03:28.910> senses<00:03:29.120> and

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
our vision we can extend our senses and

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.720 
our vision we can extend our senses and
actually<00:03:30.200> make<00:03:30.380> it<00:03:30.410> part<00:03:30.980> of<00:03:31.040> the<00:03:31.190> environment

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
actually make it part of the environment

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.440 
actually make it part of the environment
if<00:03:31.820> we<00:03:32.810> can<00:03:33.530> understand<00:03:34.010> that<00:03:34.760> you<00:03:35.060> can<00:03:35.209> tag

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
if we can understand that you can tag

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.870 
if we can understand that you can tag
trash<00:03:35.890> it<00:03:36.890> pretty<00:03:37.130> much<00:03:37.340> says<00:03:37.550> that<00:03:37.670> you<00:03:37.760> can

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
trash it pretty much says that you can

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.570 
trash it pretty much says that you can
tag<00:03:38.060> anything<00:03:38.510> in<00:03:38.630> a<00:03:39.019> very<00:03:39.200> near<00:03:39.410> future<00:03:39.620> you

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:40.580 
tag anything in a very near future you

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.810 
tag anything in a very near future you
know<00:03:40.760> where<00:03:41.060> something<00:03:41.570> is<00:03:41.900> and<00:03:42.550> what<00:03:43.550> it<00:03:43.670> is

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:43.820 
know where something is and what it is

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.150 
know where something is and what it is
in<00:03:44.120> real<00:03:44.570> time<00:03:44.840> I<00:03:45.230> think<00:03:45.739> of<00:03:45.920> the<00:03:46.010> new

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
in real time I think of the new

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.600 
in real time I think of the new
processes<00:03:46.700> that<00:03:47.630> we<00:03:48.620> could<00:03:48.800> invent<00:03:49.130> and<00:03:49.400> start

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 
processes that we could invent and start

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:52.449 
processes that we could invent and start
using<00:03:49.820> in<00:03:50.120> cities<00:03:50.709> this<00:03:51.709> is<00:03:51.830> a<00:03:51.860> great<00:03:52.160> time<00:03:52.430> to

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
using in cities this is a great time to
