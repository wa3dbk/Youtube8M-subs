00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:04.230
 our workshop is today 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.480
 Arcos does not give a lot of different batteries and how they look after the 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.420
 One way to the other uses one must also note different things that only way 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.619
 His new middle class is no different 

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:16.470
 Year classics let's say the modern form of the classic recognize the design 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.689
 all for a very long time 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:20.800
 that's the r-class shell, Takko announced 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:21.689
 that is a 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.509
 but relatively robust battery has never quite a row disadvantages for one he loses 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:29.550
 his charge even if he is not used relatively quickly the other one is 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.949
 also loses its total capacity relatively fast, that is their areas 

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:33.680
 on Lada 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.350
 the less that everyone has maybe ever watched so 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.170
 long half year is easy to pay attention to if it is used regularly 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.730
 Hard to find is that this dreaded memory effect then not 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.740
 possible that's another story 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:51.380
 who has something else at home Tashi same in shape but that there are some 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.770
 Cadmium demolition years please take care of the occasion 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.460
 Does it really say give and replace with the communicated becomes a big one 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.940
 just better for the environment you should not actually do things anymore 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.740
 to buy 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.780
 Now have to be problematic for very old device but there you should 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.750
 really think about new purchases Gust and the next Algol 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.850
 the wm-out notebook and so all the love of these heroes can be shortly 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:15.530
 almost the same 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.250
 We have been spending millions of dollars on notebooks for quite a long time 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.040
 in smaller design here 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.100
 for example, to retrieve such a mobile phone 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.900
 they are relatively robust they only have a few problems that one now they 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.360
 Not at all that is the depth discharged that is when I have such a 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:40.040
 not unloaded tightly 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:43.490
 really definitely enriches the depth discharge the problem is 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.610
 if I put the notebook to the side then 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.280
 discharges the battery by the self-discharge on and eventually 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.100
 is just a deep ditch and with it in the bucket to avoid that should I 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.620
 here recharge as regularly as possible 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:59.429
 Mask vegetable products most of the evening evening netzt stronger 

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:02.669
 then the battery is always nice with charged he does that too 

00:02:02.669 --> 00:02:04.100
 not big or even 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.420
 so the lithium-ion batteries do not particularly recommend it 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.629
 we actually place him regularly 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.529
 operates on the network and if it is even possible with many notebooks 

00:02:12.529 --> 00:02:15.610
 that he does not understand the notebook is not stable anymore so if possible 

00:02:15.609 --> 00:02:19.609
 then you have to build it up to 60 to 70 percent and at one 

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:22.569
 cool place for not being in the fridge because of the condensation 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:24.620
 Increase location store 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.530
 and after a certain period of time again check that he is not on any 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:28.580
 Case deeply discharged 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.400
 this is not the best polling put the other problem is these batteries 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.430
 In any case, aging over time means that the longer I have seven, the more 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.819
 Worse, they are no matter what I do not mitmache the EBITDA on batteries 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:42.349
 Buy stock which you will use later 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:45.189
 Markus Kaufmann always fresh after yes 

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:48.290
 how much he left the load a bit more power after so much month for 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.790
 Month no matter what you do is not so terribly many employers 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.529
 in percentages to pay was great 

00:02:53.529 --> 00:02:57.759
 quite similar is that with the latest technology these are the 

00:02:57.759 --> 00:03:01.829
 So-called lithium-polymer batteries are in the past especially in mobile phones 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:05.089
 be installed because you have been such a polemic he holds in each 

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:06.610
 can bring any shape 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.240
 are very very robust 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.360
 show what you do not like as well as the Liz Union batteries is half 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.350
 deep discharge 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.780
 and especially high temperatures so please do not lie in the car in the summer 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.159
 leave in the snow in winter in the snow in the jacket 

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:20.760
 They do not like that so much 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.780
 70 of them, however, could last the life of each Augustus whole 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.469
 Houses is used or not 

00:03:27.469 --> 00:03:30.339
 That is exactly what was an act must, unfortunately, the case 

00:03:30.339 --> 00:03:33.669
 Percent the sensitivity how fast that goes is different the the 

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:37.379
 Speed ​​Limits Ergo are therefore relatively insensitive anyway one can say so 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:38.449
 every two years 

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:41.609
 they have definitely lost a lot of capacity that goes up to 

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:44.419
 Half under and then you can just buy new ones 

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:46.949
 with the purchase of poets appropriately 

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:50.789
 just then if you do not need it before because then loses so long 

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:53.650
 next to it Liddy Rallye cooler is somehow too 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.650
 you know what exactly happened is thank you
