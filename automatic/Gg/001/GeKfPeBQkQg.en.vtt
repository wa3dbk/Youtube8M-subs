body<00:00:48.980> growth<00:00:49.339> with<00:00:49.789> the<00:00:49.910> protein<00:00:50.300> and<00:00:50.449> energy

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
body growth with the protein and energy

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.650 
body growth with the protein and energy
what<00:00:51.679> i'm<00:00:51.800> gonna<00:00:51.949> do<00:00:52.190> is<00:00:52.429> is<00:00:52.670> come<00:00:52.969> in<00:00:53.120> here<00:00:53.449> in

what i'm gonna do is is come in here in

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.599 
what i'm gonna do is is come in here in
about<00:00:53.780> two<00:00:54.109> weeks<00:00:54.140> and<00:00:54.649> i'm<00:00:55.070> gonna<00:00:55.249> take<00:00:55.429> our

about two weeks and i'm gonna take our

00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:58.450 
about two weeks and i'm gonna take our
plot<00:00:55.850> max<00:00:56.260> spray<00:00:57.260> this<00:00:57.469> filled<00:00:57.739> with<00:00:57.920> plot<00:00:58.160> max

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
plot max spray this filled with plot max

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.729 
plot max spray this filled with plot max
then<00:00:59.300> i'm<00:00:59.390> going<00:00:59.570> to<00:00:59.629> come<00:00:59.929> in<00:00:59.960> and<00:01:00.260> work<00:01:00.410> it<00:01:00.589> up

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
then i'm going to come in and work it up

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.299 
then i'm going to come in and work it up
and<00:01:01.550> i'm<00:01:01.670> gonna<00:01:01.789> plant<00:01:02.089> our<00:01:02.359> red<00:01:02.899> zone<00:01:03.140> now<00:01:03.440> the

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
and i'm gonna plant our red zone now the

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:06.130 
and i'm gonna plant our red zone now the
plot<00:01:04.580> max<00:01:04.879> is<00:01:05.089> a<00:01:05.120> soil<00:01:05.420> conditioner<00:01:05.990> it's

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
plot max is a soil conditioner it's

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:07.870 
plot max is a soil conditioner it's
gonna<00:01:06.260> raise<00:01:06.560> the<00:01:06.800> pH<00:01:07.100> of<00:01:07.130> the<00:01:07.400> soil<00:01:07.580> it's

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
gonna raise the pH of the soil it's

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.700 
gonna raise the pH of the soil it's
gonna<00:01:08.000> help<00:01:08.240> the<00:01:08.420> soil<00:01:08.600> retain<00:01:09.050> moisture<00:01:09.260> it's

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
gonna help the soil retain moisture it's

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.280 
gonna help the soil retain moisture it's
gonna<00:01:09.830> raise<00:01:10.160> organic<00:01:10.760> matter<00:01:11.140> basically<00:01:12.140> it

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
gonna raise organic matter basically it

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.530 
gonna raise organic matter basically it
creates<00:01:12.800> the<00:01:13.220> most<00:01:13.250> fertile<00:01:13.790> environment<00:01:14.030> for

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
creates the most fertile environment for

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.560 
creates the most fertile environment for
plants<00:01:15.260> and<00:01:15.440> or<00:01:16.160> seeds<00:01:16.520> to<00:01:16.820> thrive<00:01:17.120> in<00:01:17.450> the

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
plants and or seeds to thrive in the

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.530 
plants and or seeds to thrive in the
soil<00:01:17.840> so<00:01:18.710> i'm<00:01:19.490> not<00:01:19.640> sure<00:01:19.700> if<00:01:19.910> i'm<00:01:20.090> gonna<00:01:20.270> mix

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
soil so i'm not sure if i'm gonna mix

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.990 
soil so i'm not sure if i'm gonna mix
roundup<00:01:21.020> it<00:01:21.200> with<00:01:21.410> this<00:01:21.620> or<00:01:21.770> not<00:01:21.890> oh<00:01:22.220> I'll<00:01:22.700> see

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
roundup it with this or not oh I'll see

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.030 
roundup it with this or not oh I'll see
how<00:01:23.200> basically<00:01:24.200> what<00:01:24.350> this<00:01:24.470> looks<00:01:24.710> like<00:01:24.800> in

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
how basically what this looks like in

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.010 
how basically what this looks like in
two<00:01:25.190> weeks<00:01:25.220> if<00:01:25.670> I<00:01:25.880> feel<00:01:26.210> I<00:01:26.240> need<00:01:26.570> to<00:01:26.600> spray<00:01:26.960> it

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
two weeks if I feel I need to spray it

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.140 
two weeks if I feel I need to spray it
with<00:01:27.080> roundup<00:01:27.590> and<00:01:27.740> kill<00:01:27.920> it<00:01:28.040> first<00:01:28.310> what<00:01:29.030> I'll

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
with roundup and kill it first what I'll

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.330 
with roundup and kill it first what I'll
do<00:01:29.360> is<00:01:29.540> put<00:01:29.570> the<00:01:29.990> roundup<00:01:30.440> and<00:01:30.620> the<00:01:30.830> plot<00:01:31.070> max

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
do is put the roundup and the plot max

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.150 
do is put the roundup and the plot max
in<00:01:31.550> the<00:01:31.640> same<00:01:31.880> tank<00:01:32.180> and<00:01:32.450> with<00:01:32.930> one<00:01:33.170> pass<00:01:33.440> I'll

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:34.160 
in the same tank and with one pass I'll

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.370 
in the same tank and with one pass I'll
kill<00:01:34.490> all<00:01:34.520> the<00:01:34.850> weeds<00:01:35.060> with<00:01:35.270> the<00:01:35.360> roundup<00:01:35.780> get

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
kill all the weeds with the roundup get

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:37.990 
kill all the weeds with the roundup get
the<00:01:36.500> plot<00:01:36.680> max<00:01:36.980> on<00:01:37.190> the<00:01:37.280> ground<00:01:37.490> and<00:01:37.760> then<00:01:37.850> I'm

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
the plot max on the ground and then I'm

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.240 
the plot max on the ground and then I'm
going<00:01:38.150> to<00:01:38.180> tear<00:01:38.420> it<00:01:38.450> up<00:01:38.630> at<00:01:39.500> that<00:01:39.740> point<00:01:40.070> then

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
going to tear it up at that point then

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:41.560 
going to tear it up at that point then
I'm<00:01:40.340> going<00:01:40.460> to<00:01:40.520> come<00:01:40.670> in<00:01:40.820> I'm<00:01:40.970> gonna<00:01:41.090> plant<00:01:41.390> our

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
I'm going to come in I'm gonna plant our

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
maturity some of the earlier planted

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.909 
maturity some of the earlier planted
stuff<00:02:57.239> if<00:02:57.480> the<00:02:57.900> deer<00:02:58.079> haven't<00:02:58.439> wiped<00:02:58.620> it<00:02:58.799> out

late<00:03:02.010> season<00:03:02.250> attractant<00:03:02.939> but<00:03:03.510> basically<00:03:04.019> I

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:04.349 
late season attractant but basically I

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:05.690 
late season attractant but basically I
found<00:03:04.709> that<00:03:04.889> you'll<00:03:05.040> have<00:03:05.189> deer<00:03:05.459> in<00:03:05.579> there

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:11.870 
found that you'll have deer in there
every<00:03:06.060> day<00:03:06.209> of<00:03:06.329> the<00:03:06.389> fall<00:03:06.650> so<00:03:08.510> hope<00:03:09.510> you<00:03:09.629> enjoy
