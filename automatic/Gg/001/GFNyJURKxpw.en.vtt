00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
prototype study is telemedicine does

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.280 
prototype study is telemedicine does
make<00:02:46.590> a<00:02:46.620> lot<00:02:46.740> of<00:02:46.890> sense<00:02:47.150> clinically

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
make a lot of sense clinically

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.720 
make a lot of sense clinically
economically<00:02:49.290> socially<00:02:50.130> and<00:02:50.610> emotionally

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
and we're going to see a lot of

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.010 
and we're going to see a lot of
telemedicine<00:02:53.520> taking<00:02:54.150> place<00:02:54.360> in<00:02:54.540> the<00:02:54.630> future

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
telemedicine taking place in the future

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.620 
telemedicine taking place in the future
what<00:02:55.740> telemedicine<00:02:56.250> does<00:02:56.730> in<00:02:56.940> a<00:02:57.030> nutshell<00:02:57.240> it

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
what telemedicine does in a nutshell it

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.060 
what telemedicine does in a nutshell it
takes<00:02:57.870> the<00:02:58.020> distance<00:02:58.440> away<00:02:58.620> from<00:02:58.770> the

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
takes the distance away from the

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.820 
takes the distance away from the
equation<00:02:59.340> and<00:02:59.700> it's<00:03:00.270> easier<00:03:00.660> to<00:03:00.840> move<00:03:00.990> data

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
equation and it's easier to move data

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.380 
equation and it's easier to move data
and<00:03:02.160> images<00:03:02.610> than<00:03:02.790> to<00:03:02.970> move<00:03:03.150> either

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
and images than to move either

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.870 
and images than to move either
physicians<00:03:04.020> or<00:03:04.230> patients<00:03:04.709> so<00:03:05.220> I<00:03:05.250> see<00:03:05.640> great

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
physicians or patients so I see great

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.390 
physicians or patients so I see great
future<00:03:06.330> for<00:03:06.360> telemedicine<00:03:06.870> and<00:03:07.350> my<00:03:07.920> own<00:03:08.100> sense

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
future for telemedicine and my own sense

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:19.030 
future for telemedicine and my own sense
is<00:03:08.610> really<00:03:09.030> the<00:03:09.240> best<00:03:09.600> is<00:03:10.050> yet<00:03:10.170> to<00:03:10.350> come
