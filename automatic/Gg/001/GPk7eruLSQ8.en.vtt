00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
why I was collecting all those pallets

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.599 
why I was collecting all those pallets
all<00:00:25.410> that<00:00:25.710> scrap<00:00:26.630> wood<00:00:27.630> in<00:00:27.960> whatever<00:00:28.470> well<00:00:29.400> I

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
was wondering that myself and I tried

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.069 
was wondering that myself and I tried
coming<00:00:32.910> up<00:00:33.120> with<00:00:33.239> several<00:00:33.390> different<00:00:33.780> ideas

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
coming up with several different ideas

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.069 
coming up with several different ideas
for<00:00:34.110> how<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:34.829> use<00:00:35.130> that<00:00:35.399> but<00:00:35.670> you<00:00:36.660> know<00:00:36.690> trying

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
for how to use that but you know trying

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.240 
for how to use that but you know trying
to<00:00:37.370> disassemble<00:00:38.570> the<00:00:39.570> wood<00:00:40.020> from<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.260> palace

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
to disassemble the wood from the palace

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.750 
to disassemble the wood from the palace
was<00:00:41.489> like<00:00:41.700> it<00:00:42.690> was<00:00:42.840> murder<00:00:43.129> and<00:00:44.129> there<00:00:44.489> was<00:00:44.610> no

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
was like it was murder and there was no

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.369 
was like it was murder and there was no
way<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.559> to<00:00:46.730> easily<00:00:47.730> get<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.149> nails<00:00:48.360> out<00:00:48.629> all

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
way to to easily get the nails out all

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.490 
way to to easily get the nails out all
right<00:00:49.530> so<00:00:49.829> it<00:00:49.950> was<00:00:50.070> like<00:00:50.190> well<00:00:51.079> and<00:00:52.079> I

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
right so it was like well and I

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.069 
right so it was like well and I
came<00:00:52.980> over<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.550> I<00:00:54.260> had<00:00:55.260> an<00:00:55.379> idea<00:00:56.809> so<00:00:57.809> there<00:00:57.989> you

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
came over and I had an idea so there you

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.910 
came over and I had an idea so there you
have<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.489> fairly<00:00:59.489> nice<00:00:59.760> palette<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:00.920> in

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
have a fairly nice palette and in

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.760 
have a fairly nice palette and in
between<00:01:02.039> each<00:01:02.520> of<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.350> supports<00:01:06.500> the<00:01:07.500> length

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
between each of the supports the length

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.080 
between each of the supports the length
here<00:01:08.240> so<00:01:09.320> almost<00:01:10.320> two<00:01:10.560> feet<00:01:10.770> about<00:01:11.610> 18<00:01:12.000> inches

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
here so almost two feet about 18 inches

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.670 
here so almost two feet about 18 inches
something<00:01:12.600> like<00:01:12.720> that<00:01:13.790> but<00:01:14.810> but<00:01:15.810> you<00:01:16.020> know<00:01:16.140> the

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
something like that but but you know the

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.100 
something like that but but you know the
easiest<00:01:16.860> way<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.250> do<00:01:17.460> it<00:01:17.610> is<00:01:17.939> it<00:01:18.540> just<00:01:18.720> cut<00:01:18.960> out

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
easiest way to do it is it just cut out

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.179 
easiest way to do it is it just cut out
all<00:01:19.290> of<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:20.840> the<00:01:21.840> good<00:01:22.020> pieces<00:01:22.320> all<00:01:22.890> right<00:01:23.009> and

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
all of the the good pieces all right and

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.179 
all of the the good pieces all right and
then<00:01:23.310> do<00:01:23.490> something<00:01:23.700> with<00:01:23.939> that<00:01:24.799> here's<00:01:25.799> what

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
then do something with that here's what

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.859 
then do something with that here's what
I've<00:01:26.280> come<00:01:26.430> up<00:01:26.490> with<00:01:26.610> so<00:01:26.880> far

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:33.499 

now<00:01:30.869> I'm<00:01:31.409> gonna<00:01:31.619> do<00:01:31.770> with<00:01:31.920> these<00:01:32.509> suppose
