00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
this is a bit weird he got an upgrade in

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:55.929 
this is a bit weird he got an upgrade in
his<00:03:52.759> strength<00:03:53.209> but<00:03:53.629> he<00:03:53.870> feels<00:03:54.199> weaker<00:03:55.099> at

00:03:55.929 --> 00:03:55.939 
his strength but he feels weaker at

00:03:55.939 --> 00:03:58.659 
his strength but he feels weaker at
times<00:03:56.569> not<00:03:56.840> his<00:03:57.169> normal<00:03:57.349> card<00:03:57.769> but<00:03:58.489> then

00:03:58.659 --> 00:03:58.669 
times not his normal card but then

00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:00.369 
times not his normal card but then
there's<00:03:58.879> sometimes<00:03:59.090> he<00:03:59.449> feels<00:03:59.659> a<00:03:59.989> lot

00:04:00.369 --> 00:04:00.379

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
stronger than his normal car so the

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.490 
stronger than his normal car so the

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
strength is a better if he's but for the

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.490
