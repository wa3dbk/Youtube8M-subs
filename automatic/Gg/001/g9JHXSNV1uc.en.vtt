00:00:14.909 --> 00:00:19.369
 then the students who will be taking the entrance exam for the manager is necessary 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:22.369
 they have in mind they need to be good readers 

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:27.310
 and where do I mean to be with the right the g20 they need to be 

00:00:27.309 --> 00:00:29.339
 attentive to current information 

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:30.739
 this is a point 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:33.179
 how to be aware of current information 

00:00:33.179 --> 00:00:35.320
 suddenly if these newspapers 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.570
 It may be tomorrow, there's no problem with AIDS. 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:39.679
 pork 

00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:45.079
 draw the silence did not put and within textual interpretation there are 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:49.709
 some reading strategies that we need to develop in students 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.130
 for example all the information is contained in the text replacing the 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.600
 title bold words 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.380
 It's not the source of biography. 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.380
 can give a tip not to make a good test 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.710
 some points such as relatives 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.219
 that we call speech markers 

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:18.890
 they are fundamental 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.460
 because they help to establish for example are between stops and closed 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.130
 in 3 parts of the text 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.500
 so this is an important point 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.719
 in another matter in question is or his comments 

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:33.350
 the English also falsified 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.010
 which is also a matter that the current in Spanish are words that 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:37.470
 he 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.600
 similar to the one in Portuguese that we think tradition and 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.060
 Portuguese identity 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.689
 but it has a completely different version 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.689
 are excellent 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.740
 one of the trademark titles 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.460
 the coordinator 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:59.820
 are options 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:00.749
 and there is not 

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:02.590
 I like the customer 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.680
 herrera converted suspect however did not shake the northeast coast of the state 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.490
 the real caption marks 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.259
 an obsession that is a dream 

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:16.159
 did not know 

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:18.679
 with trumpets and flags 

00:02:18.679 --> 00:02:21.679
 I got crazy 

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:25.469
 to duty 

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:31.149
 of comparison and comparison with March and also to speak 

00:02:32.419 --> 00:02:34.579
 the stage director and actor 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:36.590
 It's important, you knew. 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.239
 there are some words 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:42.170
 which can initially replace it 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.189
 even with catar 

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:47.429
 the pastoral 

00:02:47.429 --> 00:02:48.370
 it's a word 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.139
 a 22-year-old man to marry him 

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:52.869
 the word 

00:02:52.869 --> 00:02:55.869
 at the time it was 

00:02:56.929 --> 00:02:59.929
 and sometimes some things that only the police 

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:02.190
 the house of culture 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.369
 we have 

00:03:03.369 --> 00:03:04.589
 the word 

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:05.539
 and them 

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:07.869
 in a solemn session to preserve 

00:03:07.869 --> 00:03:08.910
 for example 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.779
 When are we going to have 

00:03:10.779 --> 00:03:13.149
 before 

00:03:13.149 --> 00:03:16.199
 like a glove 

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:17.689
 yea 

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:20.199
 years 

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:23.209
 When we talk about four weeks 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:24.979
 I want to say which was 

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:28.129
 the idea is that this word is to go 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:29.280
 so come on 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.529
 I gave a different shape 

00:03:31.529 --> 00:03:34.839
 the decision to end his career at the club of light 

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:35.720
 dr 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.349
 we believe 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:40.650
 according to the minister, this Christian word will work 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.980
 when the skin of the sun's rays 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.719
 questions now I know these words 

00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:48.719
 in which case the operation does not change 

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:52.909
 die the score 

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:54.529
 it's the word 

00:03:54.529 --> 00:03:57.039
 it is the very condition 

00:03:57.039 --> 00:04:00.139
 We always talk via 

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:03.509
 ae 

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:06.509
 in the middle of the tension climate 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:10.349
 and we also 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:17.559
 this important position due to another 

00:04:17.559 --> 00:04:19.180
 word 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.859
 a part of the intestine 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:23.210
 it's that I am 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.349
 ovalor week he said 

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:28.349
 the greatest return 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:33.979
 I do not know how to lose he still said that the idea 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.849
 mentioned in the country 

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:40.849
 So we're trying to talk to the United States. 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.590
 such as 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:45.809
 the word 

00:04:45.809 --> 00:04:47.129
 they 

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:48.509
 The work 

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:51.029
 the word 

00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:54.330
 and she has a work to preserve the soil 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.279
 means 

00:04:57.279 --> 00:04:59.639
 so that he promised 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:02.080
 then you will know what is essential 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.110
 this is how it started to circulate 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.110
 in some rooms and cells what they presented 

00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:14.430
 then selected until January 5 the network 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.210
 divided into three years with the mint 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.759
 are the famous anonymous 

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:22.759
 counterfeiters 

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:27.629
 We also like to talk about it. 

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:29.730
 they are the false friends 

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:32.730
 are words that seem to be one thing 

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:34.350
 the promotion 

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:35.349
 they have 

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:38.979
 a form very similar to ours 

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:40.889
 no use of Portuguese 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:43.849
 but hirings should be different 

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:44.880
 for example 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:45.780
 the classic 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:47.169
 it's the word 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:49.770
 gets lost 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:51.580
 that means 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.610
 to write for them 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:56.610
 join mayan complex 

00:05:57.689 --> 00:06:01.180
 another word 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:03.270
 pretty good 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:05.389
 It's the word of course. 

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:07.909
 What we evaluate is that the analysis 

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:09.369
 that was 

00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:12.330
 but it is not just the number of missing 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:15.330
 this word means in fact 

00:06:16.849 --> 00:06:20.150
 I'm really going 

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:21.869
 and she fell 

00:06:21.869 --> 00:06:24.339
 impossible not to mention names 

00:06:24.339 --> 00:06:26.259
 who is in reserve 

00:06:26.259 --> 00:06:28.449
 such as 

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:31.039
 in port is 

00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:33.490
 every day 

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:36.199
 tumors are two sectors 

00:06:36.199 --> 00:06:39.199
 in teresina 

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:42.990
 generally in relation to the ground under penalty of 

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:45.869
 have to stay 

00:06:45.869 --> 00:06:49.389
 because it is important for this evidence that it is not 

00:06:49.389 --> 00:06:51.759
 if you try to win more titles 

00:06:51.759 --> 00:06:54.379
 you have to provide the competitors 

00:06:54.379 --> 00:06:56.580
 It's me they're talking about. 

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:58.470
 and then you will achieve 

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:00.069
 make sense 

00:07:00.069 --> 00:07:00.949
 real 

00:07:00.949 --> 00:07:01.739
 in this round
