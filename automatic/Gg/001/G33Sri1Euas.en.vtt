00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:07.450
 easy hairstyles to go to class 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.390
 in the first option we will separate a 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:26.710
 tuft on one side and with all 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:28.630
 hair we will make a pigtail aside 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.609
 with the lock we left loose 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.379
 before we are going to make the root braid of 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:34.180
 three ends crossed inside 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:36.250
 we just have to go through the 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:39.540
 tufts of the ends adding 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.490
 hair here we cross normal 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.230
 and now we are going to pass the queue 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:45.750
 between the braiding we continue 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:49.340
 braiding a little more and with a rubber band 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:52.420
 small we tie the lock 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.420
 and ready 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.760
 If you prefer, you can also leave all 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.760
 the pigtail 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.800
 and tie it with a small rubber 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.920
 in the second option we will make a pigtail 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.920
 high 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.450
 we open it by the bottom part we pass 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:30.380
 all the hair we squeeze and we do 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:32.780
 a braid with the whole lock 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.759
 we tie it with the small rubber the 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.920
 we roll up we put some hairpin 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:41.170
 inside we open it from the sides the 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.170
 we just hold and ready 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.930
 in the third option we take the two 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:03.360
 tufts of the laterals we make a 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:05.520
 pigtail to one side and we went inside 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.200
 Now we are going to take two locks of 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.970
 side of the queue and let's go 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.120
 using above making a 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.190
 Tang braid we always keep two 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.230
 strands and we are going hair of the 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.270
 ends from one side to the other 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.910
 we hold it with a small rubber band and 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.830
 ready what options have you liked to leave
