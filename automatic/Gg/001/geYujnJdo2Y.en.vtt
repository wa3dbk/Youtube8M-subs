00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:07.980
 so let's analyze but as for the rain 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.500
 the volumes of rain 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:14.250
 are being estimated for all of Brazil 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.000
 by the end of the month in the next 15 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.109
 days 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.949
 good here we have until the time of day 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:26.340
 19 and the passage of this cold front 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.590
 northeastern coast of Brazil, which helps 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.380
 to stimulate those areas of rain that we 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.020
 we are seeing here in the southeast region 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.020
 here is great news because there is a lot 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.390
 time we did not see the estimate of 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.840
 so many volumes of rain to lend 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.820
 attention to areas such as the 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.989
 paraíba serra da mantiqueira south of 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.930
 mine 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.360
 the mining triangle all the north of Sao 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.260
 paulo here in the south of goiás 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.820
 areas such as reservoirs for 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.280
 energy supply as the region 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.739
 there look of paranaíba and the river region 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.930
 should receive large volumes of 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.450
 rain then the possibility of rain 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.210
 really bulky and maybe we 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.119
 let's have a little more than 100 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.409
 accumulated millimeters, and this is 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.869
 19th day 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:19.170
 also quite voluminous 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.000
 in these coastal areas between são paulo 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.549
 to the north coast of Santa Catarina 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.650
 however almost all this rain is going 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.900
 happen just now at the end of 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.060
 week and we're talking about there 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.600
 volumes of more than 100 millimeters 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:37.200
 accumulated to have in these near 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.829
 a drying day or drying the 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.090
 atmosphere decrease rainfall 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:45.810
 in rio grande do sul 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.729
 so already from this weekend already 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.829
 should not have this more rain in the 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.630
 region of towers for example is then 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.659
 greatly reduce this instability 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.000
 also in areas where the center-west 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.290
 santa catarina and paraná and in the south of 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.680
 mato grosso do sul 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.899
 note that there is such an organization 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.329
 unstable areas in the Midwest 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.340
 Most areas of the Midwest of the 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:11.700
 then in those next five days 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.319
 many heavy showers of rain and 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.480
 many areas so we can 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:18.239
 we will have around 100 millimeters 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.999
 or more accumulated né and also remains 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:22.290
 this structure and massive rainfall in 

00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:25.019
 top of the para 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.359
 there are even tocantins maranhão and piauí 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:28.739
 little rain right? 

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:32.069
 is being expected and for the spirit 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:33.239
 santo bahia sergipe alagoas and in the north 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.670
 of Minas Gerais 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:37.709
 as the period was expected to be 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.919
 20 to 24 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:42.749
 remains the situation looks only little rain 

00:02:40.919 --> 00:02:45.090
 mostly in the northeast the rain 

00:02:42.749 --> 00:02:47.760
 will be concentrated maranhão and piauí 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:50.189
 Look and fix, look at the spirit. 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.599
 saint has almost nothing north of 

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:54.959
 mine and rio de janeiro 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:57.840
 also not in the river the rain is now 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:00.239
 then the cold front goes away and then I 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.000
 I will not have this rain anymore, what 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:06.750
 happens in this period after the 20th 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:10.590
 February, my flow of moisture should be 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:12.870
 to be more directed here the flow of 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.599
 moisture directed further to the south to 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:18.449
 Sao Paulo, then I have a chance. 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:21.329
 voluminous rains through the interior of 

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:23.819
 sao paulo especially're not so much 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:25.919
 here in the Cantareira region but the 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:28.859
 rains were killed in the interior of São 

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:31.319
 paulo mato grosso do sul and make a lot of 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:32.189
 rainfall on top of goiás and also 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:34.139
 Mato Grosso 

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:36.840
 coming back to rain on the south of 

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:39.479
 Brazil, especially the paraná and 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:42.060
 Santa Catarina there may shoot with 

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:43.169
 some problems there with heavy rains 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.599
 intensity 

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:48.120
 finally the last period looks only at us 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:50.609
 we are already in the last days of 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.329
 February is starting to enter into 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:53.729
 March 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:56.519
 good the month of March the expectation is that the 

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:59.459
 We end this month of February then the 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:02.579
 with an amount with a little air 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:04.829
 driest here again is then less 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:07.469
 instability in most areas 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:10.979
 there southeastern Midwest will give 

00:04:07.469 --> 00:04:14.430
 a decrease again in this one dried 

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:16.979
 again this dry period will not 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.989
 if it continues for a long time then this 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:21.030
 We have to get out of here. 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.699
 fact that it is an estimate of 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:26.650
 A little rain does not mean that we're going 

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:30.310
 to spend the month of March there 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:33.520
 with no rain is not is a one 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:35.800
 here in the atmosphere then we 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.500
 last days of February decreased from 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.509
 new rain condition for later 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.750
 to increase again in the month of March is 

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:46.270
 here in the last map you are seeing 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.370
 the accumulated expected right 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:51.100
 the rain estimate for the 15 days 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.810
 that you will see then that we have there 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:55.030
 large volumes accumulated in 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:57.970
 practically all of the south of Brazil are 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:00.729
 paulo centro-oeste and north of Brazil né 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:02.440
 then in all these areas here in 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:05.320
 dark green ok 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:09.000
 we have an estimate of more than 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:09.000
 200mm of rain
