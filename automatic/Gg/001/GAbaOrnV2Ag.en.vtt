temperature for this brand-new GPU from
Nvidia<00:00:42.420> is<00:00:42.629> actually<00:00:43.170> 38<00:00:43.800> degrees<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.550> it

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
Nvidia is actually 38 degrees and it

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.080 
Nvidia is actually 38 degrees and it
does<00:00:45.660> that<00:00:45.960> at<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.289> fan<00:00:46.710> speed<00:00:47.070> of<00:00:47.280> about<00:00:47.520> 40

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
does that at a fan speed of about 40

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.540 
does that at a fan speed of about 40
percent<00:00:48.300> well<00:00:48.809> exactly<00:00:49.140> 40<00:00:49.649> percent<00:00:50.039> which

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
percent well exactly 40 percent which

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:59.689 
percent well exactly 40 percent which
equates<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.270> almost<00:00:51.770> 1,400<00:00:52.770> rpm<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:58.399> yeah<00:00:59.399> so

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
equates to almost 1,400 rpm and yeah so

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:00.950 
equates to almost 1,400 rpm and yeah so
that's<00:00:59.850> fairly<00:01:00.059> straightforward<00:01:00.239> isn't<00:01:00.870> it

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
that's fairly straightforward isn't it

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.410 
that's fairly straightforward isn't it
so<00:01:01.410> I'll<00:01:01.590> show<00:01:01.800> you<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:02.250> low<00:01:02.640> temperatures<00:01:03.239> as

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
so I'll show you the low temperatures as

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.479 
so I'll show you the low temperatures as
well<00:01:03.570> as<00:01:03.719> compare<00:01:04.140> it<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.379> its<00:01:04.530> predecessor

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
well as compare it to its predecessor

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.510 
well as compare it to its predecessor
which<00:01:06.090> was<00:01:06.390> often<00:01:06.710> criticized<00:01:07.710> for<00:01:08.040> running

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
too hot the GTX 480 for the GPU load

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.600 
too hot the GTX 480 for the GPU load
comparison<00:01:15.360> on<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.540> GTX<00:01:15.990> 580<00:01:16.619> you<00:01:17.250> can<00:01:17.430> see

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
comparison on the GTX 580 you can see

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.190 
comparison on the GTX 580 you can see
I've<00:01:17.759> got<00:01:17.970> fir<00:01:18.270> mark<00:01:18.540> running<00:01:18.869> here<00:01:19.110> in

I've got fir mark running here in

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.100 
I've got fir mark running here in
extreme<00:01:19.590> burning<00:01:20.009> mode<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:20.490> you<00:01:21.360> can<00:01:21.570> see<00:01:21.840> the

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
extreme burning mode and you can see the

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.950 
extreme burning mode and you can see the
the<00:01:22.740> rise<00:01:22.979> in<00:01:23.340> temperature<00:01:23.520> while<00:01:24.270> I<00:01:24.299> held<00:01:24.810> a

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
the rise in temperature while I held a

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.690 
the rise in temperature while I held a
piece<00:01:25.170> of<00:01:25.320> paper<00:01:25.439> over<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:25.979> intake<00:01:26.430> of<00:01:26.460> the

piece of paper over the intake of the

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.850 
piece of paper over the intake of the
fan<00:01:26.939> so<00:01:26.970> that<00:01:27.390> it<00:01:27.509> wouldn't<00:01:28.290> so<00:01:28.710> that<00:01:28.829> I

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
fan so that it wouldn't so that I

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.800 
fan so that it wouldn't so that I
wouldn't<00:01:29.130> heat<00:01:29.729> up<00:01:29.880> pretty<00:01:30.030> quickly<00:01:30.390> so<00:01:30.540> that

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
wouldn't heat up pretty quickly so that

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.200 
wouldn't heat up pretty quickly so that
I<00:01:30.869> could<00:01:31.049> get<00:01:31.140> my<00:01:31.290> results<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:32.009> you<00:01:33.000> can<00:01:33.030> see

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
I could get my results and you can see

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.109 
I could get my results and you can see
it<00:01:33.450> actually<00:01:33.600> settled<00:01:34.259> down<00:01:34.439> into<00:01:34.770> a

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
it actually settled down into a

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:39.620 
it actually settled down into a
temperature<00:01:36.119> of<00:01:36.180> 69<00:01:36.990> degrees<00:01:37.130> Celsius<00:01:38.630> okay

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
temperature of 69 degrees Celsius okay

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:40.910 
temperature of 69 degrees Celsius okay
you<00:01:39.689> can<00:01:39.930> see<00:01:40.079> that<00:01:40.259> is<00:01:40.409> backed<00:01:40.650> up<00:01:40.860> by

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
you can see that is backed up by

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.920 
you can see that is backed up by

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
GTX 480 really does tell the story

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.219 
GTX 480 really does tell the story
despite<00:02:08.190> this<00:02:08.369> card<00:02:08.670> being<00:02:09.229> significantly

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.490 
despite this card being significantly
less<00:02:10.500> powerful<00:02:11.190> than<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.400> fighting

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.820

it<00:02:12.650> runs<00:02:13.630> significantly<00:02:14.630> and<00:02:15.020> I<00:02:15.170> am<00:02:15.500> over

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
it runs significantly and I am over

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.060 
it runs significantly and I am over
using<00:02:16.040> that<00:02:16.340> word<00:02:16.550> hotter<00:02:17.300> than<00:02:17.810> the<00:02:18.050> GTX<00:02:18.260> 580

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
using that word hotter than the GTX 580

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.180 
using that word hotter than the GTX 580
so<00:02:19.370> it<00:02:19.490> idles<00:02:19.850> at<00:02:20.030> a<00:02:20.210> whopping<00:02:20.600> 47<00:02:21.500> degrees<00:02:21.650> and

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
so it idles at a whopping 47 degrees and

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.630 
so it idles at a whopping 47 degrees and
that's<00:02:22.640> with<00:02:22.940> a<00:02:22.970> fan<00:02:23.270> rpm<00:02:23.720> of<00:02:23.900> over<00:02:24.170> 1500<00:02:25.070> RPM

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
that's with a fan rpm of over 1500 RPM

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.670 
that's with a fan rpm of over 1500 RPM
bear<00:02:25.910> in<00:02:26.000> mind<00:02:26.180> these<00:02:26.330> are<00:02:26.390> using<00:02:26.900> a<00:02:27.020> fairly

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
bear in mind these are using a fairly

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.970 
bear in mind these are using a fairly
similar<00:02:28.460> fan<00:02:29.030> although<00:02:29.959> the<00:02:30.140> cooler<00:02:30.560> design

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
similar fan although the cooler design

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.940 
similar fan although the cooler design
is<00:02:31.280> quite<00:02:31.490> different<00:02:31.880> because<00:02:32.420> the<00:02:32.630> GTX<00:02:33.110> 480

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
is quite different because the GTX 480

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.690 
is quite different because the GTX 480
uses<00:02:34.670> heat<00:02:34.940> pipes<00:02:35.260> whereas<00:02:36.260> the<00:02:36.590> GTX<00:02:37.160> 580

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
uses heat pipes whereas the GTX 580

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.880 
uses heat pipes whereas the GTX 580
actually<00:02:38.300> uses<00:02:38.630> a<00:02:38.660> vapor<00:02:39.020> chamber<00:02:39.560> design

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
actually uses a vapor chamber design

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.770 
actually uses a vapor chamber design
that<00:02:40.100> is<00:02:40.220> hidden<00:02:40.459> by<00:02:40.730> the<00:02:40.790> plastic<00:02:41.540> shroud<00:02:43.780> so

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
that is hidden by the plastic shroud so

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.040 
that is hidden by the plastic shroud so

nudge-nudge<00:03:44.420> but<00:03:45.350> I<00:03:45.380> guess<00:03:46.280> the<00:03:46.489> 5870<00:03:47.360> will

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
nudge-nudge but I guess the 5870 will

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.390 
nudge-nudge but I guess the 5870 will
this<00:03:47.570> have<00:03:47.780> to<00:03:47.989> do<00:03:48.110> for<00:03:48.380> now<00:03:48.470> so<00:03:49.100> you<00:03:49.190> can<00:03:49.370> see

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
this have to do for now so you can see

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.550 
this have to do for now so you can see
we're<00:03:49.700> running<00:03:49.790> at<00:03:50.030> above<00:03:50.269> 38<00:03:50.810> degrees<00:03:51.230> and

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
we're running at above 38 degrees and

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.199 
we're running at above 38 degrees and
that<00:03:51.620> is<00:03:51.680> with<00:03:51.950> a<00:03:51.980> fan<00:03:52.250> speed<00:03:52.579> percentage<00:03:53.090> of

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 
that is with a fan speed percentage of

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:55.539 
that is with a fan speed percentage of
only<00:03:53.360> about<00:03:53.600> 20<00:03:54.440> percent<00:03:54.470> so<00:03:55.190> we'll<00:03:55.340> show<00:03:55.519> you

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:55.549 
only about 20 percent so we'll show you

00:03:55.549 --> 00:04:00.819 
only about 20 percent so we'll show you
the<00:03:55.670> load<00:03:56.570> temperatures<00:03:57.410> and<00:03:59.650> that'll<00:04:00.650> be<00:04:00.769> in

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:00.829 
the load temperatures and that'll be in

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:03.220 
the load temperatures and that'll be in
just<00:04:00.950> a<00:04:01.070> moment<00:04:01.400> so<00:04:01.610> I<00:04:02.450> guess<00:04:02.660> we<00:04:02.810> kind<00:04:02.959> of<00:04:03.079> know

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
just a moment so I guess we kind of know

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.740 
just a moment so I guess we kind of know
this<00:04:03.410> already<00:04:03.769> but<00:04:03.920> there<00:04:04.370> we<00:04:04.489> go<00:04:04.610> the<00:04:04.790> 5870

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
this already but there we go the 5870

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.960 
this already but there we go the 5870
it's<00:04:06.140> been<00:04:06.350> on<00:04:06.440> the<00:04:06.560> market<00:04:06.709> for<00:04:07.130> a<00:04:07.160> while<00:04:07.430> it

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
it's been on the market for a while it

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.030 
it's been on the market for a while it
loads<00:04:08.180> at<00:04:08.420> about<00:04:08.660> 85<00:04:09.079> degrees<00:04:09.500> with<00:04:09.739> a<00:04:09.769> fan

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
loads at about 85 degrees with a fan

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.060 
loads at about 85 degrees with a fan
speed<00:04:10.340> of<00:04:10.489> yeah<00:04:10.700> only<00:04:11.060> about<00:04:11.209> 37%<00:04:11.900> so<00:04:12.500> you

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:13.070 
speed of yeah only about 37% so you

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:14.890 
speed of yeah only about 37% so you
could<00:04:13.250> tweak<00:04:13.459> the<00:04:13.610> fan<00:04:13.790> profile<00:04:14.299> a<00:04:14.329> little<00:04:14.780> bit

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
could tweak the fan profile a little bit

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.199 
could tweak the fan profile a little bit
if<00:04:15.019> you<00:04:15.140> wanted<00:04:15.560> set<00:04:16.130> it<00:04:16.220> up<00:04:16.370> so<00:04:16.579> that<00:04:16.609> that<00:04:16.760> fan

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209 
if you wanted set it up so that that fan

if you wanted set it up so that that fan
ramps<00:04:17.600> up<00:04:17.720> a<00:04:17.840> little<00:04:18.019> bit<00:04:18.200> more<00:04:18.470> and<00:04:18.680> gives<00:04:18.890> you

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.100 
ramps up a little bit more and gives you

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:20.949 
ramps up a little bit more and gives you
a<00:04:19.130> better<00:04:19.459> temperatures<00:04:20.150> but<00:04:20.419> honestly<00:04:20.810> it's

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 
a better temperatures but honestly it's

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.140 
a better temperatures but honestly it's
not<00:04:21.080> necessary<00:04:21.709> it's<00:04:22.310> designed<00:04:22.700> to<00:04:22.820> run<00:04:22.940> just

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
not necessary it's designed to run just

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.450 
not necessary it's designed to run just
fine

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
fine

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.820
