00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.590
 great goal of spending a holiday week in switzerland every summer 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:11.960
 or at my sister's house it starts to be a tradition and once again I'm going to 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.490
 try to make a Swiss recipe and the truth that I have not left as 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.570
 It should be but good if you follow the steps if you want a better yeast 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.810
 sure you look good the yeast was frozen then went to try 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.029
 to revitalize it with a couple of tablespoons of sugar and covering the 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:33.840
 milk of time in this fair while at the biennial we add two tablespoons of 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.510
 CÃ¡ceres after the butter in pieces and that as you can see this 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.120
 tempered that is to say it is very soft to make it easy 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.120
 to mix with flour 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.420
 but none of this was 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.540
 that when we tighten it take shape but it breaks loose easily we can 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.540
 incorporate the yeast 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.380
 Dec 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.240
 and we mix everything well we are open to distribute it 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.240
 uniform 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:26.000
 and we incorporate the milk that should not be cold either, this activity is more 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 best 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.929
 but if we analyze until we have 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:43.929
 a very compact mass 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.160
 we put it in a ball covered with a pillar cloth we are in a warm place 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.080
 it has been preferred the yeast will not react 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.810
 and should double its size here I think one of the reasons why I do not 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.619
 has gone well is that the yeast was not in good condition then not 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:11.639
 everything that had to grow has grown 

00:02:11.639 --> 00:02:16.609
 in principle with an hour is enough we take it out we live the mass in two 

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:20.469
 two 

00:02:34.649 --> 00:02:39.859
 and we make two citizen jets to access the press first we braid the 

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:41.389
 two jets 

00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:44.389
 p 

00:02:58.899 --> 00:03:01.899
 bush 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:11.169
 and then we will see squeeze between them 

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:16.059
 efe 

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:23.389
 do not 

00:03:27.179 --> 00:03:32.389
 and we have this Swiss bread here we put it on a baking sheet on the 

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:34.980
 that dusted flour so that it does not stick 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.540
 and we're going to put it in the fridge for ten minutes to keep the shape or 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.540
 be cool or just take it out on the street 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:46.599
 and now we paint it well with whipped egg yolk 

00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:50.549
 i 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:53.549
 efe 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:01.269
 villa we can put it in the oven this preheated 200 degrees and when 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:05.919
 we do not go down to 180 and after half an hour we can check but 

00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:09.129
 probably need between 40 and 45 minutes 

00:04:11.369 --> 00:04:15.169
 which would be to put the cry at the end to take color 

00:04:21.559 --> 00:04:24.890
 and buenavista estefan de mantequilla 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:27.890
 but they liked a hug until then 

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:29.879
