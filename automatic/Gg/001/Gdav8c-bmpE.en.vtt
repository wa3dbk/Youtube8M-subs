of all this Adam
well<00:03:00.519> one<00:03:00.819> level<00:03:01.060> it's<00:03:01.720> a<00:03:01.750> bit<00:03:01.870> of<00:03:01.930> a<00:03:01.959> shaggy

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200

dog<00:03:02.319> story<00:03:02.769> I<00:03:02.860> think<00:03:04.080> in<00:03:05.080> the<00:03:05.230> sense<00:03:05.440> that<00:03:05.680> this

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:05.799 
dog story I think in the sense that this

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:07.830 
dog story I think in the sense that this
is<00:03:05.980> not<00:03:06.160> the<00:03:06.310> most<00:03:06.459> important<00:03:06.970> thing<00:03:07.150> that's

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
is not the most important thing that's

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.039 
is not the most important thing that's
happened<00:03:08.350> we've<00:03:08.470> had<00:03:08.620> many<00:03:08.860> examples<00:03:09.310> before

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
happened we've had many examples before

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:14.460 
happened we've had many examples before
of<00:03:11.730> cabinet<00:03:12.730> speakers<00:03:13.150> from<00:03:13.720> all<00:03:13.810> parties

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
of cabinet speakers from all parties

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.430 
of cabinet speakers from all parties
taking<00:03:15.359> tabloid<00:03:16.359> headlines<00:03:16.840> writing<00:03:17.320> them

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
taking tabloid headlines writing them

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.500

into<00:03:17.620> their<00:03:17.739> speech<00:03:18.070> and<00:03:18.310> then<00:03:18.430> finding<00:03:18.880> that

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
into their speech and then finding that

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.569 
into their speech and then finding that
they<00:03:19.660> don't<00:03:19.870> quite<00:03:20.140> stand<00:03:20.769> up<00:03:20.920> to<00:03:21.040> the<00:03:21.130> facts<00:03:21.370> I

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:21.579 
they don't quite stand up to the facts I

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:23.520 
they don't quite stand up to the facts I
think<00:03:22.000> there<00:03:22.359> are<00:03:22.390> two<00:03:22.660> significant<00:03:23.320> things

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
think there are two significant things

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.849 
think there are two significant things
which<00:03:23.709> come<00:03:23.920> out<00:03:24.130> of<00:03:24.280> that<00:03:24.459> one<00:03:25.390> is<00:03:25.859> obviously

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:26.859 
which come out of that one is obviously

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:29.550 
which come out of that one is obviously
it's<00:03:27.250> never<00:03:27.549> pretty<00:03:27.930> when<00:03:28.930> two<00:03:29.140> cabinet

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
it's never pretty when two cabinet

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.039 
it's never pretty when two cabinet
colleagues<00:03:29.980> are<00:03:30.359> publicly<00:03:31.359> arguing<00:03:31.900> with
