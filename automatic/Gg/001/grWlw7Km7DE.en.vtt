new place made an actual channel real
narrow<00:00:24.580> to<00:00:25.269> get<00:00:25.449> spot<00:00:25.720> all<00:00:25.929> the<00:00:25.960> things<00:00:26.320> and<00:00:26.710> I

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:27.519 
narrow to get spot all the things and I

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:29.939 
narrow to get spot all the things and I
love<00:00:27.699> the<00:00:27.880> idea<00:00:27.999> but<00:00:28.449> I<00:00:28.720> didn't<00:00:29.679> like<00:00:29.800> the

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:29.949 
love the idea but I didn't like the

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:32.700 
love the idea but I didn't like the
thought<00:00:30.159> of<00:00:30.189> you<00:00:31.119> can't<00:00:31.929> straddle<00:00:32.290> the<00:00:32.500> tap

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:32.710 
thought of you can't straddle the tap

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.100 
thought of you can't straddle the tap
you<00:00:33.100> couldn't<00:00:33.460> do<00:00:33.579> full<00:00:34.210> pirouette<00:00:34.540> doesn't

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:35.110 
you couldn't do full pirouette doesn't

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:36.150 
you couldn't do full pirouette doesn't
you<00:00:35.200> know<00:00:35.290> because<00:00:35.530> you<00:00:35.650> could<00:00:35.800> really<00:00:35.950> only

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:36.160 
you know because you could really only

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.160 
you know because you could really only
do<00:00:36.400> certain<00:00:36.940> but<00:00:37.450> the<00:00:37.540> concept<00:00:37.900> thought<00:00:38.020> that

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.170 
do certain but the concept thought that

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.750 
do certain but the concept thought that
was<00:00:38.260> great<00:00:38.470> so<00:00:39.040> I<00:00:39.100> was<00:00:39.190> sharing<00:00:39.430> that<00:00:39.550> idea

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:39.760 
was great so I was sharing that idea

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.190 
was great so I was sharing that idea
with<00:00:39.880> Steve<00:00:40.060> Elliot<00:00:40.390> he<00:00:40.660> said<00:00:40.810> I<00:00:40.840> think<00:00:40.960> I'm

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:41.200 
with Steve Elliot he said I think I'm

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.480 
with Steve Elliot he said I think I'm
gonna<00:00:41.350> do<00:00:41.530> him<00:00:41.650> he<00:00:41.830> thought<00:00:41.980> it<00:00:42.070> was<00:00:42.130> just<00:00:42.310> so

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:42.490 
gonna do him he thought it was just so

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:44.280 
gonna do him he thought it was just so
that's<00:00:43.360> the<00:00:43.480> dumbest<00:00:43.780> thing<00:00:43.900> I've<00:00:43.960> ever<00:00:44.020> heard

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:44.290 
that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:45.720 
that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard
of<00:00:44.350> because<00:00:44.800> what<00:00:45.040> if<00:00:45.130> it<00:00:45.190> doesn't<00:00:45.370> work<00:00:45.580> then

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:45.730 
of because what if it doesn't work then

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.280 
of because what if it doesn't work then
you've<00:00:45.850> got<00:00:46.000> this<00:00:46.120> bigger<00:00:46.450> than<00:00:46.480> I<00:00:46.570> can<00:00:46.750> write

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:47.290 
you've got this bigger than I can write

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.680 
you've got this bigger than I can write
app<00:00:47.500> so<00:00:48.010> I<00:00:48.070> just<00:00:48.220> wanted<00:00:48.520> to<00:00:48.580> build<00:00:48.850> it<00:00:49.060> seven

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:49.690 
app so I just wanted to build it seven

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.960 
app so I just wanted to build it seven
and<00:00:49.840> a<00:00:49.870> half<00:00:49.930> or<00:00:50.170> seven<00:00:50.620> feet<00:00:50.830> wide<00:00:50.890> and<00:00:51.490> then<00:00:51.850> I

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:51.970 
and a half or seven feet wide and then I

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.690 
and a half or seven feet wide and then I
built<00:00:52.270> these<00:00:52.450> cables<00:00:52.960> to<00:00:53.110> slide<00:00:53.410> in<00:00:53.710> so<00:00:54.520> that

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:54.700 
built these cables to slide in so that

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.670 
built these cables to slide in so that
and<00:00:54.940> it<00:00:55.030> worked<00:00:55.240> out<00:00:55.420> better<00:00:55.930> than<00:00:56.170> anything<00:00:56.440> I

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:56.680 
and it worked out better than anything I

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.680 
and it worked out better than anything I
ever<00:00:56.710> imagined<00:00:57.400> because<00:00:57.880> we<00:00:58.150> literally<00:00:58.450> can

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690 
ever imagined because we literally can

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.860 
ever imagined because we literally can
do<00:00:58.810> routines<00:00:59.200> off<00:00:59.410> and<00:00:59.850> we<00:01:00.850> spot<00:01:01.090> dismounts<00:01:01.750> in

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
do routines off and we spot dismounts in

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.170 
do routines off and we spot dismounts in
it<00:01:02.110> but<00:01:02.560> we<00:01:02.650> can<00:01:02.830> move<00:01:03.040> all<00:01:03.250> six<00:01:03.550> cables<00:01:03.940> in<00:01:04.059> to

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180 
it but we can move all six cables in to

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.240 
it but we can move all six cables in to
make<00:01:04.360> a<00:01:04.390> little<00:01:04.629> channel<00:01:04.989> if<00:01:05.229> we<00:01:05.350> want<00:01:05.590> or<00:01:06.009> just

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 
make a little channel if we want or just

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:07.320 
make a little channel if we want or just
one

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.330 
one

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.900 
one
spot<00:01:07.900> to<00:01:08.080> catch<00:01:08.260> me<00:01:08.440> if<00:01:08.500> we<00:01:08.590> can<00:01:08.710> do<00:01:08.800> it<00:01:09.280> how

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:09.910 
spot to catch me if we can do it how

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:22.889 
spot to catch me if we can do it how
many<00:01:10.090> years<00:01:10.150> ago<00:01:10.270> was<00:01:10.800> 11

00:01:22.889 --> 00:01:22.899 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:26.830 

and<00:01:23.899> we<00:01:24.609> actually<00:01:25.609> I<00:01:25.670> built<00:01:25.939> it<00:01:26.060> before<00:01:26.210> that

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
and we actually I built it before that

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.630 
and we actually I built it before that
at<00:01:27.229> my<00:01:27.439> other<00:01:27.560> germ<00:01:27.829> I<00:01:27.979> just<00:01:28.189> didn't<00:01:28.429> have<00:01:28.490> the

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
at my other germ I just didn't have the

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.330 
at my other germ I just didn't have the
nice<00:01:28.850> sliding<00:01:29.119> tables<00:01:29.509> identities<00:01:30.159> tip<00:01:31.159> up

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
nice sliding tables identities tip up

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.510 
nice sliding tables identities tip up
yeah<00:01:31.789> so<00:01:32.649> the<00:01:33.649> kids<00:01:33.829> wrong<00:01:33.979> reason<00:01:34.219> having<00:01:34.369> to

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
yeah so the kids wrong reason having to

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.910 
yeah so the kids wrong reason having to
jump<00:01:34.729> downs<00:01:35.000> tip<00:01:35.600> it<00:01:35.750> up<00:01:35.869> come<00:01:36.200> climb<00:01:36.469> back<00:01:36.709> up

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
jump downs tip it up come climb back up

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.490 
jump downs tip it up come climb back up
here<00:01:37.159> get<00:01:37.429> up<00:01:37.459> so<00:01:38.000> I<00:01:38.030> wanted<00:01:38.420> this<00:01:38.569> kind<00:01:39.289> of<00:01:39.409> a

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
here get up so I wanted this kind of a

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.919 
here get up so I wanted this kind of a
shelf<00:01:39.829> slightly<00:01:40.340> my<00:01:41.149> father-in-law<00:01:41.659> helped

00:01:41.919 --> 00:01:41.929 
shelf slightly my father-in-law helped

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:45.160 
shelf slightly my father-in-law helped
me<00:01:42.049> design<00:01:42.200> that<00:01:43.630> and<00:01:44.630> then<00:01:44.780> we're<00:01:44.929> did<00:01:45.049> the

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
me design that and then we're did the

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:46.480 
me design that and then we're did the
hydraulic<00:01:45.649> one<00:01:45.859> come<00:01:46.100> from

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
hydraulic one come from

00:01:46.490 --> 00:02:11.260 
hydraulic one come from
I<00:01:46.810> heard<00:01:47.810> of<00:01:47.899> that<00:01:48.020> somewhere<00:01:48.439> so<00:01:48.649> I<00:01:48.709> built<00:01:48.979> it
