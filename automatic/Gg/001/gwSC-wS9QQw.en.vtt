00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
put in there those three cups of sugar

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.339 
put in there those three cups of sugar
well<00:02:15.140> pour<00:02:16.000> right<00:02:17.000> about<00:02:17.239> half<00:02:17.569> of<00:02:17.810> it<00:02:17.930> in<00:02:18.079> and

well pour right about half of it in and
mix<00:02:18.560> it<00:02:18.829> and<00:02:19.100> then<00:02:19.190> do<00:02:19.370> more<00:02:19.609> I<00:02:20.560> find<00:02:21.560> it<00:02:21.680> a

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769 
mix it and then do more I find it a

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:26.380 
mix it and then do more I find it a
little<00:02:22.190> bit<00:02:22.609> easier<00:02:24.190> than<00:02:25.190> trying<00:02:25.489> to<00:02:25.670> pour<00:02:26.060> a

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
little bit easier than trying to pour a

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.309 
little bit easier than trying to pour a
huge<00:02:27.290> glob<00:02:27.560> in<00:02:27.769> there<00:02:27.890> and<00:02:28.010> have<00:02:28.130> it<00:02:28.160> stick

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
huge glob in there and have it stick

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:31.390 
huge glob in there and have it stick
that's<00:02:30.319> time<00:02:30.470> I<00:02:30.530> think<00:02:30.709> I'm<00:02:30.799> doing<00:02:31.069> three

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
that's time I think I'm doing three

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.039 
that's time I think I'm doing three
batches<00:02:32.620> okay<00:02:33.650> creates<00:02:34.430> this<00:02:34.639> big<00:02:34.940> clump<00:02:35.510> when

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:36.049 
batches okay creates this big clump when

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:39.370 
batches okay creates this big clump when
it<00:02:36.170> hits

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.500 

okay<00:02:41.560> all<00:02:42.560> of<00:02:42.740> the<00:02:42.890> sugar<00:02:43.130> added<00:02:43.580> now<00:02:44.150> we<00:02:44.210> gotta

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
okay all of the sugar added now we gotta

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.000 
okay all of the sugar added now we gotta
bring<00:02:44.690> this<00:02:44.780> back<00:02:45.140> to<00:02:45.410> a<00:02:45.440> boil<00:02:47.470> or<00:02:48.470> stumble<00:02:48.950> it

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
bring this back to a boil or stumble it

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.630

gonna be more of a jam it's gonna be
thicker<00:03:15.550> normally<00:03:17.890> some<00:03:18.890> things<00:03:19.130> I<00:03:19.250> make<00:03:19.400> some

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
thicker normally some things I make some

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.030 
thicker normally some things I make some
excess<00:03:19.940> liquid<00:03:20.480> it's<00:03:21.290> a<00:03:21.440> more<00:03:21.680> of<00:03:21.710> a<00:03:21.800> jelly

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
excess liquid it's a more of a jelly

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.950 
excess liquid it's a more of a jelly
it's<00:03:22.520> more<00:03:22.820> runny<00:03:23.030> and<00:03:23.360> I'm<00:03:23.510> okay<00:03:23.780> with<00:03:23.930> that

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:23.960 
it's more runny and I'm okay with that

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:28.360 
it's more runny and I'm okay with that
and<00:03:24.850> if<00:03:25.850> it's<00:03:26.060> not<00:03:26.180> as<00:03:26.330> thick<00:03:26.510> as<00:03:26.660> you<00:03:26.810> want<00:03:27.370> you

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
and if it's not as thick as you want you

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.930 
and if it's not as thick as you want you
can<00:03:28.820> take<00:03:29.300> and<00:03:29.780> add<00:03:30.740> more<00:03:30.920> pectin<00:03:31.370> to<00:03:31.580> it

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
can take and add more pectin to it

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.510 
can take and add more pectin to it
um<00:03:32.240> this<00:03:32.840> one<00:03:33.080> I<00:03:33.110> find<00:03:33.440> one<00:03:33.590> half<00:03:33.800> packs<00:03:34.070> is

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:34.520 
um this one I find one half packs is

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:38.890 
um this one I find one half packs is
usually<00:03:34.880> plenty<00:03:36.460> and<00:03:37.460> it<00:03:37.610> will<00:03:37.820> thicken<00:03:38.660> up

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
usually plenty and it will thicken up

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.020 
usually plenty and it will thicken up
even<00:03:39.260> more<00:03:39.470> as<00:03:39.680> it<00:03:39.830> processes<00:03:40.040> and<00:03:40.700> as<00:03:40.850> it

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
even more as it processes and as it

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.200 
even more as it processes and as it
cools<00:03:41.800> it'll<00:03:42.800> thicken<00:03:43.040> a<00:03:43.250> little<00:03:43.280> more<00:03:43.700> it's

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:44.210 
cools it'll thicken a little more it's

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:45.130 
cools it'll thicken a little more it's
all<00:03:44.330> mixed<00:03:44.750> in

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
all mixed in

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.200 
all mixed in
someone<00:03:45.860> let<00:03:45.950> this<00:03:46.040> come<00:03:46.250> back<00:03:46.400> to<00:03:46.520> a<00:03:46.610> boil<00:03:46.880> and

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:47.210 
someone let this come back to a boil and

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:50.530 
someone let this come back to a boil and
then<00:03:47.270> we<00:03:47.780> will<00:03:47.960> test<00:03:48.290> it<00:03:48.440> and<00:03:48.590> see<00:03:49.330> how<00:03:50.330> close

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
then we will test it and see how close

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:55.030 
then we will test it and see how close
we<00:03:50.660> are<00:03:50.840> to<00:03:51.610> the<00:03:52.610> next<00:03:52.880> step
