step in did what I did and it's a it's
basically<00:01:35.500> a<00:01:35.770> motherboard<00:01:36.429> that's<00:01:37.179> got<00:01:37.450> LEDs

00:01:37.919 --> 00:01:37.929 
basically a motherboard that's got LEDs

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:40.290 
basically a motherboard that's got LEDs
on<00:01:38.200> it<00:01:38.380> you<00:01:39.039> know<00:01:39.130> saying<00:01:39.429> go<00:01:39.700> ahead<00:01:39.909> and<00:01:40.060> put

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:47.649 
and you see all the LEDs in there on the

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:49.969 
and you see all the LEDs in there on the
motherboard<00:01:48.179> you<00:01:49.179> know<00:01:49.299> what<00:01:49.390> I'm<00:01:49.479> saying

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
motherboard you know what I'm saying

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.020 
motherboard you know what I'm saying
on<00:01:50.979> there<00:01:52.110> you<00:01:53.110> know<00:01:53.229> it's<00:01:53.500> got<00:01:53.679> the

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
on there you know it's got the

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.080 
on there you know it's got the
sequential<00:01:55.800> light<00:01:56.800> up<00:01:57.009> after<00:01:57.729> you<00:01:57.849> put<00:01:58.060> your

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
sequential light up after you put your

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.260 
sequential light up after you put your
turn<00:01:58.390> signal<00:01:58.869> on<00:01:59.129> or<00:02:00.129> you<00:02:00.580> put<00:02:00.759> your<00:02:00.879> brake<00:02:01.060> on

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
turn signal on or you put your brake on

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.900 
turn signal on or you put your brake on
go<00:02:02.229> ahead<00:02:02.410> up<00:02:02.920> hit<00:02:03.580> the<00:02:03.729> brake

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:05.910 
go ahead up hit the brake

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:13.010 
go ahead up hit the brake
all<00:02:06.910> right<00:02:07.090> take<00:02:07.390> off<00:02:08.099> break<00:02:09.179> off<00:02:10.530> break<00:02:11.530> Oh

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
all right take off break off break Oh

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.770 
all right take off break off break Oh
so<00:02:14.020> basically<00:02:14.379> keep<00:02:14.890> doing<00:02:15.160> that<00:02:15.250> Gary

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
so basically keep doing that Gary

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.559 
so basically keep doing that Gary
basically<00:02:17.040> when<00:02:18.040> a<00:02:18.069> turn<00:02:18.340> signal<00:02:18.580> on<00:02:18.849> his<00:02:19.090> turn

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
basically when a turn signal on his turn

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:20.759 
basically when a turn signal on his turn
stick<00:02:19.810> is<00:02:19.900> not<00:02:20.019> working<00:02:20.290> right<00:02:20.410> now<00:02:20.470> in<00:02:20.680> this

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
stick is not working right now in this

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:23.190 
stick is not working right now in this
car<00:02:21.010> but<00:02:21.239> when<00:02:22.239> the<00:02:22.330> turn<00:02:22.510> signal<00:02:22.810> this<00:02:22.930> is<00:02:22.989> how

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
car but when the turn signal this is how

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.890 
car but when the turn signal this is how
his<00:02:23.349> turn<00:02:23.590> signal<00:02:23.620> flash<00:02:24.330> they're<00:02:25.330> starting

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
his turn signal flash they're starting
