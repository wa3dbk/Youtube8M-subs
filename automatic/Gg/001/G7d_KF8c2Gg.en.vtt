00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
somehow hanging on it can't last it

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.600 
somehow hanging on it can't last it
cannot<00:00:47.090> last<00:00:47.330> surely<00:00:48.230> cannot<00:00:48.560> last<00:00:48.860> if<00:00:49.310> he<00:00:49.490> was

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:49.610 
cannot last surely cannot last if he was

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:50.980 
cannot last surely cannot last if he was
to<00:00:49.790> pit<00:00:50.030> now<00:00:50.240> which<00:00:50.450> would<00:00:50.570> be<00:00:50.690> the<00:00:50.750> non

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:50.990 
to pit now which would be the non

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:52.720 
to pit now which would be the non
adventurous<00:00:51.620> thing<00:00:51.770> to<00:00:51.890> do<00:00:52.010> I<00:00:52.040> suppose<00:00:52.460> he

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
adventurous thing to do I suppose he

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.490 
adventurous thing to do I suppose he
would<00:00:53.120> probably<00:00:53.360> be<00:00:53.630> able<00:00:53.750> to<00:00:53.930> come<00:00:54.110> out<00:00:54.170> just

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
would probably be able to come out just

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.990 
would probably be able to come out just
behind<00:00:54.710> Heidfeld<00:00:55.250> he'd<00:00:55.370> still<00:00:55.640> be<00:00:55.760> on<00:00:55.880> the

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
behind Heidfeld he'd still be on the

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.800 
behind Heidfeld he'd still be on the
podium<00:00:56.210> but<00:00:57.050> it'd<00:00:57.200> be<00:00:57.380> I<00:00:57.590> mean<00:00:57.680> is<00:00:57.950> this<00:00:58.040> unsafe
