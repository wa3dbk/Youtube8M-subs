 It was perfect in almost every 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:34.400
 symmetry volume definition 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:36.980
 thenceforth dexter remained with the 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.980
 spectacular physical condition always 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:42.739
 highlighting among the top five in 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.360
 all competitions but the best yet 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:47.630
 was about to come 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:50.239
 the mister olympia of 2007 jex ter 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.640
 got third place but many 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:55.100
 said that was the most he 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.860
 I would get it but it was there in 2008 and 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:00.830
 shut the mouths of critics by defeating 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.989
 current season champion jack cam making 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:05.390
 if the newest mister olympia da 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:07.970
 story to show that it was not luck 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:11.269
 in the same year he again defeated 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:13.670
 jec in the classic arnold championship 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:16.430
 2008 was a great year for jackie 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.769
 jackson because he repeated the victory in 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.680
 bow of classic and continue in its 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:24.829
 best phase also winning australia 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:27.210
 grand pix brom and grand pix of the new 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:30.240
 zeland and the grand pix in russia 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:33.540
 in 2009 jackson jackson lost his 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:36.270
 mister olympia title for jack cam 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.730
 It's the way it was there and it took its title from 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:40.560
 back in 2009 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.500
 jacques has filmed his first 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.840
 documentary entitled jacques pierre 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.300
 jackson an unbreakable 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.490
 another amazing fact about this guy 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:53.310
 is the amount of competitions he 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:57.840
 has participated since the beginning of 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:04:00.660
 to present in bodybuilding in 1992 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:03.300
 The fact of so many presentations is that 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.700
 he is always in full shape he you 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:08.310

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:12.030
 pounds over his weight of competition 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:14.940
 hence his name comes from blade to blade 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:18.180
 The guy is always cut, man, it's torn. 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:20.790
 set the guy always gets in the top 10 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.810
 He currently lives in Jacksonville, 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.640
 florida 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:26.310
