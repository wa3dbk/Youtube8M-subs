April of 2010 and the only reason they
did<00:00:36.210> that<00:00:36.450> was<00:00:37.230> because<00:00:37.350> real<00:00:37.739> numbers<00:00:38.100> don't

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309

months after it launched so

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.920 
months after it launched so
understandably<00:01:33.580> most<00:01:34.180> of<00:01:34.330> Looby<00:01:34.600> softs

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930 
understandably most of Looby softs

understandably most of Looby softs
development<00:01:35.500> effort<00:01:35.770> went<00:01:35.980> into<00:01:36.070> that<00:01:36.340> HD

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
development effort went into that HD

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.470 
development effort went into that HD
version<00:01:37.540> but<00:01:38.170> of<00:01:38.260> course<00:01:38.500> 198<00:01:39.490> gajillion<00:01:40.060> is<00:01:40.450> a

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:40.480 
version but of course 198 gajillion is a

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.610 
version but of course 198 gajillion is a
whole<00:01:40.780> lot<00:01:40.930> of<00:01:40.990> people

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:41.620 
whole lot of people

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.070 
whole lot of people
so<00:01:41.920> another<00:01:42.340> Ubisoft<00:01:43.000> team<00:01:43.270> was<00:01:43.480> responsible

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
so another Ubisoft team was responsible

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.980 
so another Ubisoft team was responsible
for<00:01:44.310> retrofitting<00:01:45.310> Advanced<00:01:45.820> Warfighter<00:01:45.990> to

for retrofitting Advanced Warfighter to
the<00:01:47.110> ps2<00:01:47.800> and<00:01:48.010> that's<00:01:48.430> what<00:01:48.610> they<00:01:48.730> did

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
the ps2 and that's what they did

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.290 
the ps2 and that's what they did
they<00:01:49.960> took<00:01:50.140> a<00:01:50.200> very<00:01:50.470> good<00:01:50.800> game<00:01:51.100> and<00:01:51.520> made<00:01:52.150> it

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:52.300 
they took a very good game and made it

00:01:52.300 --> 00:02:02.130 
they took a very good game and made it
not<00:01:52.420> so<00:01:52.750> good<00:02:00.060> it's<00:02:01.060> not<00:02:01.270> like<00:02:01.450> this<00:02:01.600> is<00:02:01.780> just<00:02:01.990> a

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
not so good it's not like this is just a

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.950 
not so good it's not like this is just a
lower-resolution<00:02:03.060> adaptation<00:02:04.060> of<00:02:04.150> the<00:02:04.300> 360

lower-resolution adaptation of the 360

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.510 
lower-resolution adaptation of the 360
game<00:02:05.110> this<00:02:05.290> is<00:02:05.440> almost<00:02:05.740> a<00:02:05.950> completely

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
game this is almost a completely

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.090 
game this is almost a completely
different<00:02:06.760> game<00:02:07.150> altogether<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:08.530> story<00:02:08.890> and

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
different game altogether the story and

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:10.830 
different game altogether the story and
mission<00:02:09.399> structure<00:02:09.700> pretty<00:02:10.240> much<00:02:10.420> the<00:02:10.600> same

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
mission structure pretty much the same

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.540 
mission structure pretty much the same
but<00:02:11.410> just<00:02:11.440> about<00:02:11.740> everything<00:02:12.040> else<00:02:12.340> was

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
but just about everything else was

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.880 
but just about everything else was
changed<00:02:13.030> for<00:02:13.210> the<00:02:13.270> ps2<00:02:13.600> it<00:02:14.320> strips<00:02:14.650> away<00:02:14.800> the

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
changed for the ps2 it strips away the

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.280 
changed for the ps2 it strips away the
game's<00:02:15.160> third-person<00:02:15.790> option<00:02:16.330> entirely<00:02:16.840> and

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
game's third-person option entirely and

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.140 
game's third-person option entirely and
it<00:02:17.680> also<00:02:17.830> reduces<00:02:18.400> the<00:02:18.460> amount<00:02:18.610> of<00:02:18.880> other

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
it also reduces the amount of other

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.770 
it also reduces the amount of other
soldiers<00:02:19.720> you<00:02:19.900> can<00:02:20.050> control<00:02:20.530> to<00:02:21.160> just<00:02:21.400> one

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
soldiers you can control to just one

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.120 
soldiers you can control to just one
basically<00:02:22.780> controlling<00:02:23.350> this<00:02:23.560> game<00:02:23.680> is<00:02:24.010> like

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
basically controlling this game is like
