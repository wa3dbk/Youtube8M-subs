00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
together it took us about 90 minutes and

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.580 
together it took us about 90 minutes and
the<00:01:29.250> instructions<00:01:29.790> are<00:01:30.000> only<00:01:30.360> pictures<00:01:30.870> so

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.810 
they're a little bit hard to follow so
the<00:01:34.080> trick<00:01:34.380> is<00:01:34.410> make<00:01:34.980> sure<00:01:35.010> you've<00:01:35.280> sorted<00:01:35.730> the
