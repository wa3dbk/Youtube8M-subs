00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.690 
okay the dew line now pops up in
elevation<00:02:08.410> and<00:02:08.830> you<00:02:09.010> see<00:02:09.160> here<00:02:09.430> we've<00:02:09.580> got

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
elevation and you see here we've got

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.150 
elevation and you see here we've got
this<00:02:09.850> little<00:02:10.030> icon<00:02:10.590> which<00:02:11.590> is<00:02:11.740> basically<00:02:12.040> I'll

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
this little icon which is basically I'll

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.060 
this little icon which is basically I'll
get<00:02:12.340> out<00:02:12.550> so<00:02:13.150> go<00:02:13.300> back<00:02:13.450> into<00:02:13.660> our<00:02:13.840> family

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
get out so go back into our family

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:15.840 
get out so go back into our family
obviously<00:02:15.070> at<00:02:15.130> the<00:02:15.190> minute<00:02:15.400> we're<00:02:15.490> working<00:02:15.760> in

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
obviously at the minute we're working in

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.030 
obviously at the minute we're working in
2d<00:02:16.030> wireframe<00:02:16.420> so<00:02:17.110> the<00:02:17.500> drawing<00:02:17.770> looks<00:02:17.920> a

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
2d wireframe so the drawing looks a

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.150 
2d wireframe so the drawing looks a
little<00:02:18.160> bit<00:02:18.400> crazy<00:02:18.520> so<00:02:19.420> let's<00:02:19.690> change<00:02:19.900> this<00:02:20.170> we

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
little bit crazy so let's change this we

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.140 
little bit crazy so let's change this we
can<00:02:21.310> either<00:02:21.400> change<00:02:21.730> it<00:02:21.970> to

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
can either change it to

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.780 
can either change it to
a<00:02:24.239> simple<00:02:25.640> conceptual

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
a simple conceptual

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.000 
a simple conceptual
like<00:02:28.360> that<00:02:28.659> which<00:02:29.080> I<00:02:29.200> like<00:02:29.379> working<00:02:29.590> in<00:02:29.830> there

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
like that which I like working in there

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.009 
like that which I like working in there
makes<00:02:30.190> it<00:02:30.340> quite<00:02:30.550> quick<00:02:30.730> and<00:02:30.909> easy<00:02:31.030> or<00:02:31.659> what<00:02:31.870> we

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:32.019 
makes it quite quick and easy or what we

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:36.660 
makes it quite quick and easy or what we
really<00:02:32.349> want<00:02:32.530> to<00:02:33.480> we<00:02:34.480> can<00:02:34.629> start<00:02:34.900> working<00:02:35.670> in

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
really want to we can start working in

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.220 
really want to we can start working in
realistic<00:02:37.060> now<00:02:37.420> this<00:02:37.569> can<00:02:37.720> take<00:02:37.840> a<00:02:37.900> little<00:02:38.049> bit

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
realistic now this can take a little bit

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.080 
realistic now this can take a little bit
longer<00:02:38.379> and<00:02:38.830> different<00:02:39.280> on<00:02:39.610> your<00:02:39.730> machine<00:02:40.060> but

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
longer and different on your machine but

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.119 
longer and different on your machine but
sometimes<00:02:40.780> to<00:02:40.989> get<00:02:41.110> a<00:02:41.170> good<00:02:41.349> idea<00:02:41.799> of<00:02:41.950> what's

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:42.129 
sometimes to get a good idea of what's

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:48.000 
sometimes to get a good idea of what's
going<00:02:42.190> on<00:02:42.540> it's<00:02:43.540> also<00:02:43.810> also<00:02:44.110> possible

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.190 

and<00:02:48.430> here<00:02:48.790> we<00:02:48.909> go<00:02:49.060> we<00:02:49.209> now<00:02:49.330> have<00:02:49.540> our<00:02:49.569> elevation

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
and here we go we now have our elevation

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.500 
and here we go we now have our elevation
just<00:02:50.230> here<00:02:50.590> and<00:02:50.769> I<00:02:50.830> put<00:02:51.010> it<00:02:51.129> into<00:02:51.510> realistic

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
just here and I put it into realistic

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.420 
just here and I put it into realistic
view<00:02:52.720> so<00:02:52.900> we<00:02:52.959> see<00:02:53.110> the<00:02:53.200> brickwork<00:02:53.560> previous

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
view so we see the brickwork previous

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.220 
view so we see the brickwork previous
use<00:02:54.760> the<00:02:54.879> architecture<00:02:55.599> it's<00:02:55.870> not<00:02:56.019> one<00:02:56.110> of<00:02:56.140> my

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
use the architecture it's not one of my

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.380 
use the architecture it's not one of my
strong<00:02:56.409> points<00:02:56.440> in<00:02:56.830> design<00:02:57.069> however<00:02:58.000> here<00:02:58.299> we

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
strong points in design however here we

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.149 
strong points in design however here we
go<00:02:58.510> I'm<00:02:58.569> going<00:02:58.599> to<00:02:58.810> quickly<00:02:58.959> show<00:02:59.080> you<00:02:59.290> some<00:03:00.099> of

00:03:00.149 --> 00:03:00.159 
go I'm going to quickly show you some of

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:01.619 
go I'm going to quickly show you some of
the<00:03:00.220> nice<00:03:00.340> little<00:03:00.489> tools<00:03:00.760> that<00:03:00.909> you<00:03:00.970> can<00:03:01.120> do

00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:01.629 
the nice little tools that you can do

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:04.860 
the nice little tools that you can do
while<00:03:02.560> you're<00:03:02.650> using<00:03:02.890> in<00:03:03.099> this<00:03:03.250> way<00:03:03.870> for

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
while you're using in this way for

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.539 
while you're using in this way for
example<00:03:05.230> we<00:03:05.319> can<00:03:05.470> just<00:03:05.590> simply<00:03:05.950> take<00:03:06.160> the<00:03:06.310> milk

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:06.549 
example we can just simply take the milk

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:09.360 
example we can just simply take the milk
the<00:03:06.819> window<00:03:07.180> sorry<00:03:08.019> and<00:03:08.260> we<00:03:08.590> can<00:03:08.769> move<00:03:08.980> it<00:03:09.220> in

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
the window sorry and we can move it in

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:14.850 
the window sorry and we can move it in
elevation<00:03:13.349> there<00:03:14.349> we<00:03:14.440> go<00:03:14.560> and<00:03:14.650> it<00:03:14.769> will

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
elevation there we go and it will

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.259 
elevation there we go and it will
actually<00:03:14.950> move<00:03:15.280> it<00:03:15.489> in<00:03:15.579> elevation<00:03:16.000> obviously

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
actually move it in elevation obviously

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:18.059 
actually move it in elevation obviously
that's<00:03:16.420> going<00:03:16.629> to<00:03:16.690> filter<00:03:16.989> through<00:03:17.200> to<00:03:17.950> the

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:18.069 
that's going to filter through to the

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:21.630 
that's going to filter through to the
plan<00:03:18.250> we<00:03:18.760> can<00:03:18.879> also<00:03:19.030> then<00:03:19.180> copy

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.650 

and<00:03:21.880> I<00:03:22.030> say<00:03:22.240> two<00:03:22.570> meters<00:03:22.960> in<00:03:22.990> this<00:03:23.170> direction

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
and I say two meters in this direction

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.600 
and I say two meters in this direction
there<00:03:25.170> we<00:03:25.320> go<00:03:25.500> so<00:03:25.920> if<00:03:25.980> you<00:03:26.070> start<00:03:26.340> having<00:03:26.490> a

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
there we go so if you start having a

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.000 
there we go so if you start having a
look<00:03:26.730> now<00:03:27.000> and<00:03:27.270> designing<00:03:28.200> and<00:03:28.530> having<00:03:28.800> a<00:03:28.860> look

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
look now and designing and having a look

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.980 
look now and designing and having a look
that<00:03:29.250> how<00:03:29.850> our<00:03:30.000> elevations<00:03:30.570> going<00:03:30.750> to<00:03:30.810> work

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:30.990 
that how our elevations going to work

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:33.440 
that how our elevations going to work
and<00:03:31.400> let's<00:03:32.400> face<00:03:32.520> it<00:03:32.580> that's<00:03:32.880> the<00:03:33.000> way<00:03:33.120> that<00:03:33.300> we

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
and let's face it that's the way that we

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.250 
and let's face it that's the way that we
work<00:03:33.630> we<00:03:33.840> can<00:03:33.960> even<00:03:34.080> for<00:03:34.230> a<00:03:34.260> window<00:03:34.500> upstairs

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
work we can even for a window upstairs

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.950 
work we can even for a window upstairs
especially<00:03:37.260> copying<00:03:37.800> it<00:03:37.950> vertically

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:41.960 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.730 

there<00:03:42.350> we<00:03:42.470> go

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:44.740 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:48.000 

thank<00:03:45.490> you

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.820 

they're<00:03:48.550> down<00:03:48.819> master<00:03:49.060> piece<00:03:49.650> okay<00:03:50.650> well

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:50.830 
they're down master piece okay well

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:52.860 
they're down master piece okay well
anyway<00:03:51.400> I<00:03:51.430> hope<00:03:51.580> this<00:03:51.760> helps<00:03:52.269> you<00:03:52.390> in<00:03:52.690> every
