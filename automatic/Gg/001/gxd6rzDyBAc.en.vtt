00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
it and it was it was perfect gauge read

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.849 
it and it was it was perfect gauge read
properly<00:00:26.750> you<00:00:27.750> can<00:00:27.900> see<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.199> gauge<00:00:28.349> installed

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
properly you can see the gauge installed

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.450 
properly you can see the gauge installed
there<00:00:29.099> I<00:00:30.260> put<00:00:31.260> it<00:00:31.380> exactly<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:32.130> way<00:00:32.219> it<00:00:32.340> was

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
there I put it exactly the way it was

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.520 
there I put it exactly the way it was
supposed<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.759> be<00:00:32.910> in<00:00:33.090> and<00:00:33.360> wire<00:00:34.260> tied

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
supposed to be in and wire tied

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.110 
supposed to be in and wire tied
everything<00:00:35.070> made<00:00:35.280> sure<00:00:35.460> all<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.700> connectors

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
everything made sure all the connectors

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.850 
everything made sure all the connectors
were<00:00:36.270> just<00:00:36.540> right<00:00:36.809> so<00:00:37.410> I'm<00:00:37.469> going<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:37.620> go<00:00:37.739> ahead

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
were just right so I'm going to go ahead

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.010 
were just right so I'm going to go ahead
and<00:00:38.129> plug<00:00:38.340> it<00:00:38.520> in<00:00:38.640> here's<00:00:39.329> what's<00:00:39.540> happening

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
and plug it in here's what's happening

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.869 
and plug it in here's what's happening
when<00:00:40.170> it<00:00:40.320> powers<00:00:40.649> up<00:00:40.890> I<00:00:41.070> hope<00:00:41.190> we<00:00:41.370> can<00:00:41.550> see<00:00:41.760> the

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
when it powers up I hope we can see the

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:50.290 
when it powers up I hope we can see the
digital<00:00:43.550> okay<00:00:47.870> it'll<00:00:48.870> read<00:00:49.050> high<00:00:49.289> temperature

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
digital okay it'll read high temperature

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.250 
digital okay it'll read high temperature
I'm<00:00:51.300> gonna<00:00:51.449> hit<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.690> mode<00:00:51.899> button<00:00:54.020> rpm<00:00:55.020> and

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
I'm gonna hit the mode button rpm and

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.920 
I'm gonna hit the mode button rpm and
everything<00:00:55.649> will<00:00:55.800> read<00:00:55.980> zero<00:00:56.629> come<00:00:57.629> around

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
everything will read zero come around

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.380 
everything will read zero come around
I'm<00:00:58.379> hitting<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.829> mode<00:00:59.390> ours<00:01:00.390> went<00:01:00.629> to<00:01:00.750> zero

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
I'm hitting the mode ours went to zero

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.690 
I'm hitting the mode ours went to zero
130<00:01:03.390> degree<00:01:03.690> temp<00:01:04.019> on<00:01:04.379> both<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.129> temperatures

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
130 degree temp on both the temperatures

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.899 
130 degree temp on both the temperatures
the<00:01:06.600> chrono<00:01:06.990> actually<00:01:07.530> still<00:01:07.890> works<00:01:08.159> the

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
the chrono actually still works the

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.929 
the chrono actually still works the
compass<00:01:09.390> is<00:01:09.600> there<00:01:10.250> okay<00:01:11.250> now<00:01:11.460> what<00:01:11.700> I'm<00:01:11.790> going

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
compass is there okay now what I'm going

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.940 
compass is there okay now what I'm going
to<00:01:11.970> do<00:01:12.090> is<00:01:12.180> I'm<00:01:12.270> going<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.450> start<00:01:12.869> it<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.470> watch

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
to do is I'm going to start it and watch

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.560 
to do is I'm going to start it and watch
what<00:01:14.159> happens<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.520> rpm<00:01:15.060> right<00:01:15.299> when<00:01:15.450> it

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
what happens the rpm right when it

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:28.260 
what happens the rpm right when it
starts

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.290

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:32.300 
you can see the idol is shown it at 5800

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:38.410 
you can see the idol is shown it at 5800
rpm<00:01:32.860> I'll<00:01:33.860> plug<00:01:34.100> it<00:01:34.130> back<00:01:34.250> in<00:01:37.030> again<00:01:38.030> the<00:01:38.180> alarm

rpm I'll plug it back in again the alarm

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.000 
rpm I'll plug it back in again the alarm
is<00:01:38.540> gonna<00:01:38.600> go<00:01:38.720> off<00:01:38.900> and<00:01:39.140> it<00:01:39.470> just<00:01:39.500> goes<00:01:39.770> right

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.010 
is gonna go off and it just goes right

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.190 
is gonna go off and it just goes right
to<00:01:40.040> high<00:01:40.250> temperature<00:01:40.820> and<00:01:41.060> just<00:01:41.840> starts

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
through that strange sequence of went

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.130 
through that strange sequence of went
the<00:01:54.500> across<00:01:55.160> the<00:01:55.190> the<00:01:55.790> digits<00:01:56.330> here<00:01:56.570> it<00:01:56.660> went<00:01:56.870> 1

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
the across the the digits here it went 1

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.500 
the across the the digits here it went 1
1<00:01:57.380> 1<00:01:57.700> 2<00:01:58.700> 2<00:01:58.730> 2<00:01:58.910> 3<00:01:59.810> 3<00:01:59.930> 3<00:02:00.560> and<00:02:00.800> so<00:02:01.400> on<00:02:01.640> then<00:02:01.940> it<00:02:01.970> 1<00:02:02.180> 9<00:02:02.480> 9

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.510 
1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 and so on then it 1 9 9

1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 and so on then it 1 9 9
9<00:02:03.020> and<00:02:03.410> then<00:02:03.980> it<00:02:04.160> went<00:02:04.310> star<00:02:05.060> star<00:02:05.600> star<00:02:05.630> star

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
9 and then it went star star star star

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.940 
9 and then it went star star star star
and<00:02:06.680> then<00:02:06.800> it<00:02:06.920> was<00:02:07.040> blank<00:02:07.310> just<00:02:07.640> like<00:02:07.820> that<00:02:08.950> so

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
and then it was blank just like that so

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.540 
and then it was blank just like that so
then<00:02:10.130> I<00:02:10.220> pull<00:02:10.429> the<00:02:10.520> lanyard<00:02:10.700> cord<00:02:11.180> off<00:02:12.550> went

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
then I pull the lanyard cord off went

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.130 
then I pull the lanyard cord off went
ahead<00:02:13.640> and<00:02:13.910> plugged<00:02:14.180> it<00:02:14.300> back<00:02:14.330> in<00:02:14.690> thinking<00:02:14.900> it

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
ahead and plugged it back in thinking it

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.550 
ahead and plugged it back in thinking it
would<00:02:15.290> you<00:02:16.100> know<00:02:16.190> spark<00:02:16.520> it<00:02:16.640> back<00:02:16.820> up<00:02:17.090> and<00:02:17.560> now

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
would you know spark it back up and now

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.880 
would you know spark it back up and now
it's<00:02:18.800> it<00:02:19.130> is<00:02:19.310> what<00:02:19.520> it<00:02:19.640> is<00:02:20.350> so<00:02:21.350> anyways<00:02:21.680> I<00:02:21.740> took

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
it's it is what it is so anyways I took

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.280 
it's it is what it is so anyways I took
it<00:02:21.980> to<00:02:22.040> my<00:02:22.130> jet<00:02:22.340> ski<00:02:22.370> guy<00:02:22.700> today<00:02:23.090> we<00:02:23.780> plugged<00:02:24.110> it
