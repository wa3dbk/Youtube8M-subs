locations<00:02:02.750> so<00:02:03.680> that's<00:02:03.920> the<00:02:04.159> models

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
locations so that's the models

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.789 
locations so that's the models
essentially<00:02:05.450> they're<00:02:05.780> pretty<00:02:06.260> much<00:02:06.470> all<00:02:06.650> the

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 
essentially they're pretty much all the

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:08.350 
essentially they're pretty much all the
same<00:02:07.040> today<00:02:07.400> there's<00:02:08.000> some<00:02:08.119> little

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
same today there's some little

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.540 
same today there's some little
differences<00:02:08.840> along<00:02:09.110> the<00:02:09.319> way<00:02:09.500> now<00:02:10.220> what<00:02:10.459> about

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
differences along the way now what about

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.600 
differences along the way now what about
if<00:02:10.970> there<00:02:11.060> was<00:02:11.150> a<00:02:11.180> model<00:02:11.569> be<00:02:11.810> made<00:02:12.170> into

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
if there was a model be made into

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.130 
if there was a model be made into
I<00:02:12.640> made<00:02:12.940> in<00:02:13.030> Hamburg<00:02:13.420> are<00:02:13.570> they<00:02:13.660> at<00:02:13.960> all

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
I made in Hamburg are they at all

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.530 
I made in Hamburg are they at all
different<00:02:14.410> well<00:02:15.190> they're<00:02:15.940> basically

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
different well they're basically

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.180 
different well they're basically
fundamentally<00:02:17.290> the<00:02:17.410> same<00:02:17.440> but<00:02:17.920> there<00:02:18.040> are

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
fundamentally the same but there are

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.560 
fundamentally the same but there are
some<00:02:18.520> differences<00:02:18.820> you<00:02:19.060> should<00:02:19.270> know<00:02:19.450> about

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
some differences you should know about

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.840 
some differences you should know about
perhaps<00:02:20.320> the<00:02:20.650> most<00:02:20.800> fundamental<00:02:21.130> difference

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
perhaps the most fundamental difference

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.510 
perhaps the most fundamental difference
is<00:02:22.000> the<00:02:22.270> actions<00:02:22.870> New<00:02:23.650> York<00:02:23.920> makes<00:02:24.250> their<00:02:24.490> own

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
is the actions New York makes their own

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.990 
is the actions New York makes their own
actions<00:02:25.300> whereas<00:02:26.070> Hamburg<00:02:27.070> Steinway<00:02:27.310> Stu's

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
actions whereas Hamburg Steinway Stu's

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.420 
actions whereas Hamburg Steinway Stu's
to<00:02:28.180> use<00:02:28.330> renter<00:02:28.870> rent<00:02:29.650> or<00:02:29.770> the<00:02:29.860> great<00:02:30.040> German

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
to use renter rent or the great German

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.220 
to use renter rent or the great German
company<00:02:30.820> that<00:02:31.210> makes<00:02:31.450> actions<00:02:31.870> from<00:02:32.050> many

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
company that makes actions from many

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.580 
company that makes actions from many
pianos<00:02:32.710> like<00:02:32.920> booze<00:02:33.430> and/or<00:02:33.790> fur<00:02:34.030> and<00:02:34.240> others

pianos like booze and/or fur and others

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.050 
pianos like booze and/or fur and others
if<00:02:35.590> that's<00:02:35.860> what's<00:02:36.070> used<00:02:36.250> in<00:02:36.460> the<00:02:36.730> Homburg

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
if that's what's used in the Homburg

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.910 
if that's what's used in the Homburg
stein<00:02:37.540> ways<00:02:37.810> where<00:02:38.320> New<00:02:38.470> York<00:02:38.740> they<00:02:38.890> have

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
stein ways where New York they have

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.800 
stein ways where New York they have
their<00:02:39.130> own<00:02:39.160> which<00:02:40.000> means<00:02:40.300> that<00:02:40.480> you<00:02:40.600> get

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
their own which means that you get

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.890 
their own which means that you get
certain<00:02:41.440> unique<00:02:42.130> Steinway<00:02:42.970> design<00:02:43.360> elements

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
certain unique Steinway design elements

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.350 
certain unique Steinway design elements
like<00:02:43.930> their<00:02:44.370> accelerated<00:02:45.370> action<00:02:46.000> which<00:02:46.209> is

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
like their accelerated action which is

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.570 
like their accelerated action which is
not<00:02:46.510> available<00:02:47.050> on<00:02:47.230> the<00:02:47.500> Homburg<00:02:47.740> Stein<00:02:48.310> ways

not available on the Homburg Stein ways

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.120 
not available on the Homburg Stein ways
now<00:02:49.540> are<00:02:49.900> there<00:02:50.050> any<00:02:50.110> other<00:02:50.320> substantial

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
now are there any other substantial

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.640 
now are there any other substantial
difference<00:02:51.459> as<00:02:51.640> well<00:02:51.850> the<00:02:52.630> sound<00:02:53.050> boards<00:02:53.440> tend

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
difference as well the sound boards tend

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.260 
difference as well the sound boards tend
to<00:02:53.739> be<00:02:53.830> just<00:02:53.860> a<00:02:54.130> little<00:02:54.160> fatter<00:02:54.730> on<00:02:54.880> the

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 
to be just a little fatter on the

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.540 
to be just a little fatter on the
Homburg<00:02:55.540> Stein<00:02:56.080> ways<00:02:56.350> so<00:02:56.920> the<00:02:57.070> tone<00:02:57.310> is<00:02:57.520> a

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
Homburg Stein ways so the tone is a

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.330 
Homburg Stein ways so the tone is a
little<00:02:57.640> bit<00:02:58.020> more<00:02:59.020> subdued<00:02:59.350> it<00:02:59.950> takes<00:03:00.100> oh<00:03:00.220> it

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
little bit more subdued it takes oh it

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.100 
little bit more subdued it takes oh it
could<00:03:00.459> take<00:03:00.610> a<00:03:00.640> little<00:03:00.820> more<00:03:00.940> energy<00:03:01.420> a<00:03:01.630> little

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
could take a little more energy a little

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.520 
could take a little more energy a little
bit<00:03:02.260> different<00:03:02.770> but<00:03:02.920> you<00:03:03.070> know<00:03:03.190> what<00:03:03.400> to<00:03:03.940> my

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
bit different but you know what to my

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.110 
bit different but you know what to my
playing<00:03:05.530> I<00:03:05.920> think<00:03:06.310> the<00:03:06.550> difference<00:03:07.030> between

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
playing I think the difference between

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.910 
playing I think the difference between
Hamburg<00:03:07.510> in<00:03:07.840> New<00:03:07.930> York<00:03:08.110> Steinway<00:03:08.530> is<00:03:08.590> is<00:03:08.709> more

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
Hamburg in New York Steinway is is more

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.610 
Hamburg in New York Steinway is is more
the<00:03:09.130> individual<00:03:09.760> piano<00:03:10.350> because<00:03:11.350> there<00:03:11.500> are

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
the individual piano because there are

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.830 
the individual piano because there are
variants<00:03:12.220> many<00:03:12.820> people<00:03:13.209> feel<00:03:13.450> that<00:03:13.480> the

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
variants many people feel that the

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.580 
variants many people feel that the
quality<00:03:14.680> of<00:03:14.709> manufacturing<00:03:15.700> in<00:03:15.940> Hamburg<00:03:16.720> is<00:03:16.959> a

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
quality of manufacturing in Hamburg is a

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.520 
quality of manufacturing in Hamburg is a
couple<00:03:18.370> of<00:03:18.430> notches<00:03:18.870> superior<00:03:19.870> to<00:03:20.080> New<00:03:20.200> York

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
couple of notches superior to New York

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.520 
couple of notches superior to New York
overall<00:03:21.130> however<00:03:21.850> if<00:03:22.390> you<00:03:22.840> have<00:03:23.049> first-class

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
overall however if you have first-class

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.740 
overall however if you have first-class
technicians<00:03:24.310> prepping<00:03:24.790> your<00:03:24.880> piano<00:03:25.180> that

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
technicians prepping your piano that

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.140 
technicians prepping your piano that
difference<00:03:26.170> becomes<00:03:26.530> quite<00:03:26.830> negligible<00:03:27.250> so

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
difference becomes quite negligible so

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.150 
difference becomes quite negligible so
the<00:03:28.390> pianos<00:03:28.780> come<00:03:28.959> out<00:03:29.049> of<00:03:29.140> the<00:03:29.230> factory<00:03:29.470> on<00:03:30.100> a

the pianos come out of the factory on a

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.310 
the pianos come out of the factory on a
higher<00:03:30.730> level<00:03:31.209> in<00:03:31.330> Hamburg<00:03:31.720> than<00:03:31.870> they<00:03:31.989> do<00:03:32.049> in

to the final preparation which is why

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.420 
to the final preparation which is why
you'll<00:03:40.630> find<00:03:40.900> great<00:03:41.080> variance<00:03:41.709> of<00:03:41.890> Stein<00:03:42.190> ways

00:03:58.289 --> 00:03:58.299 
I think the difference between one piano

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:00.210 
I think the difference between one piano
to<00:03:58.570> the<00:03:58.660> next<00:03:58.870> is<00:03:58.959> probably<00:03:59.110> more<00:03:59.500> substantial

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
to the next is probably more substantial

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.310 
to the next is probably more substantial
than<00:04:00.640> to<00:04:00.820> generalize<00:04:01.390> about<00:04:01.420> all<00:04:01.870> the<00:04:02.019> pianos

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:02.320 
than to generalize about all the pianos

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.110 
than to generalize about all the pianos

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
the pianos coming out of New York great
