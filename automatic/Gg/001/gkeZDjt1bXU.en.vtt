00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
version I think has red wheels so I like

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.209 
version I think has red wheels so I like
blue<00:00:47.309> better<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:48.559> color<00:00:49.559> is<00:00:49.770> really<00:00:49.920> an

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
blue better and color is really an

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.420 
blue better and color is really an
opinion<00:00:50.610> so<00:00:51.030> this<00:00:51.870> is<00:00:51.989> cool<00:00:52.260> green<00:00:52.649> on<00:00:53.100> the

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
opinion so this is cool green on the

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.330 
opinion so this is cool green on the
side<00:00:53.640> I'm<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.420> first<00:00:54.629> would<00:00:55.350> what<00:00:55.920> apply<00:00:56.129> for

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
side I'm the first would what apply for

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.630 
side I'm the first would what apply for
wood<00:00:56.430> so<00:00:57.390> goes<00:00:57.750> around<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:57.960> whole<00:00:58.109> nother<00:00:58.260> thing

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
wood so goes around a whole nother thing

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.439 
wood so goes around a whole nother thing
it's<00:00:59.640> slightly<00:00:59.969> concave<00:01:01.219> so<00:01:02.219> that<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:03.329> know

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
it's slightly concave so that you know

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.950 
it's slightly concave so that you know
it's<00:01:03.840> slightly<00:01:04.650> just<00:01:05.090> better<00:01:06.090> grip<00:01:06.420> it<00:01:06.689> grips

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
it's slightly just better grip it grips

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.899 
it's slightly just better grip it grips
your<00:01:07.140> foot<00:01:07.409> a<00:01:07.439> ton<00:01:08.040> you<00:01:08.250> don't<00:01:08.460> even<00:01:08.580> need<00:01:08.729> good

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
your foot a ton you don't even need good

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.000 
your foot a ton you don't even need good
shoes<00:01:08.939> at<00:01:09.360> all<00:01:09.450> because<00:01:09.990> this<00:01:10.200> will<00:01:10.350> grip<00:01:10.680> your

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.560 
like extremely extremely well I only has
its<00:01:27.570> concave<00:01:27.780> so<00:01:28.560> this<00:01:28.710> stuff's<00:01:28.920> wheel<00:01:29.189> bite<00:01:29.570> I

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
its concave so this stuff's wheel bite I

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.630 
its concave so this stuff's wheel bite I
don't<00:01:31.470> know<00:01:31.560> if<00:01:31.740> you<00:01:31.829> should<00:01:31.890> put<00:01:32.159> 70

millimeter these are sixty nine
millimeter<00:01:34.350> wheels<00:01:34.590> you<00:01:35.490> could<00:01:35.640> probably<00:01:35.759> put

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
millimeter wheels you could probably put

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.940 
millimeter wheels you could probably put
70<00:01:36.390> mil<00:01:36.570> on<00:01:36.720> there<00:01:36.930> without<00:01:37.350> getting<00:01:37.590> wheel

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
get some 66 Mills some on there and

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:51.609 
get some 66 Mills some on there and
these<00:01:45.570> are<00:01:47.869> slalom<00:01:48.869> wheels<00:01:49.020> sector<00:01:50.060> 969<00:01:51.060> mill

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
these are slalom wheels sector 969 mill

these are slalom wheels sector 969 mill
79<00:01:52.619> a<00:01:52.649> 78<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.549> slow<00:01:54.450> on<00:01:54.600> wheels<00:01:54.780> so<00:01:55.310> they're<00:01:56.310> not

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
79 a 78 a slow on wheels so they're not

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.940 
79 a 78 a slow on wheels so they're not
good<00:01:56.790> for<00:01:56.909> sliding<00:01:57.149> they're<00:01:57.899> a<00:01:58.350> lot<00:01:58.590> really

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
good for sliding they're a lot really

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.830 
good for sliding they're a lot really
really<00:01:59.219> hard<00:01:59.399> to<00:01:59.460> slide<00:01:59.670> it<00:01:59.759> on<00:01:59.820> then<00:02:00.390> they

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
really hard to slide it on then they

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.719 
really hard to slide it on then they
like<00:02:01.110> they'll<00:02:01.860> probably<00:02:01.979> destroyed<00:02:02.490> if<00:02:02.640> you

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
like they'll probably destroyed if you

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.819 
like they'll probably destroyed if you
slide<00:02:02.909> on<00:02:02.939> them<00:02:03.210> but<00:02:03.960> they're<00:02:04.170> very<00:02:04.409> very<00:02:04.680> very

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
slide on them but they're very very very

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.969 
slide on them but they're very very very
good<00:02:05.219> for<00:02:05.399> slaloming<00:02:06.290> so<00:02:07.290> I'm<00:02:07.590> gonna<00:02:07.710> ride

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
good for slaloming so I'm gonna ride

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.260 
good for slaloming so I'm gonna ride
this<00:02:08.099> around<00:02:08.340> a<00:02:08.489> little<00:02:08.520> bit<00:02:08.789> let's<00:02:08.940> do<00:02:09.090> this

so<00:02:25.739> the<00:02:25.950> slide<00:02:26.129> puck<00:02:26.370> is<00:02:26.550> like<00:02:26.730> new<00:02:26.940> and<00:02:27.750> it's

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
so the slide puck is like new and it's

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:30.580 
so the slide puck is like new and it's
Kevlar<00:02:28.709> on<00:02:28.830> the<00:02:28.890> tips<00:02:29.099> so<00:02:29.580> this<00:02:29.730> is<00:02:29.849> not<00:02:30.000> gonna

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
Kevlar on the tips so this is not gonna

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.400 
Kevlar on the tips so this is not gonna
break<00:02:31.590> anytime<00:02:32.400> soon<00:02:33.080> and<00:02:34.080> it<00:02:34.170> looks<00:02:34.290> pretty

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
break anytime soon and it looks pretty

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.740 
break anytime soon and it looks pretty
cool<00:02:34.700> that<00:02:35.700> there's<00:02:35.910> a<00:02:36.000> pad<00:02:36.209> here<00:02:36.480> that<00:02:36.660> is

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
cool that there's a pad here that is

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:43.940 
cool that there's a pad here that is
used<00:02:36.989> to<00:02:37.200> wipe<00:02:37.410> off<00:02:37.590> sweat<00:02:42.440> so<00:02:43.440> I'm<00:02:43.500> gonna<00:02:43.620> ride

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
used to wipe off sweat so I'm gonna ride

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.220 
used to wipe off sweat so I'm gonna ride
this<00:02:43.980> thing<00:02:44.370> around<00:02:44.459> a<00:02:44.700> little<00:02:44.819> bit<00:02:45.000> just<00:02:45.299> to

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
this thing around a little bit just to

00:02:46.230 --> 00:03:03.589 
this thing around a little bit just to
show<00:02:46.260> you<00:02:47.450> how<00:02:48.450> it<00:02:48.630> rides<00:03:01.970> deathly<00:03:02.970> turns<00:03:03.239> very

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
show you how it rides deathly turns very

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:08.960 
show you how it rides deathly turns very
very<00:03:03.930> sharply<00:03:04.319> I<00:03:05.780> can<00:03:06.780> easily<00:03:07.049> get<00:03:07.760> these<00:03:08.760> my

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
very sharply I can easily get these my

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.809 
very sharply I can easily get these my
start<00:03:09.269> on<00:03:09.299> the<00:03:09.480> right<00:03:09.660> side<00:03:09.690> of<00:03:09.959> the<00:03:10.019> road<00:03:10.170> I

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:10.819 
start on the right side of the road I

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:16.509 
start on the right side of the road I
can<00:03:11.819> easily<00:03:12.269> easily<00:03:14.090> get<00:03:15.090> all<00:03:15.329> the<00:03:15.510> way<00:03:15.599> around

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519 
can easily easily get all the way around

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:20.900 
can easily easily get all the way around
pretty<00:03:17.519> nice<00:03:17.730> I<00:03:18.829> have<00:03:19.829> a<00:03:20.010> back<00:03:20.190> five<00:03:20.459> bearings

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
pretty nice I have a back five bearings

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.809 
pretty nice I have a back five bearings
on<00:03:21.060> here<00:03:21.239> but<00:03:21.569> normally<00:03:21.780> I<00:03:22.590> would<00:03:23.459> definitely

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 
on here but normally I would definitely

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:26.629 
on here but normally I would definitely
recommend<00:03:23.910> getting<00:03:24.450> better<00:03:24.780> bearings<00:03:25.639> it's

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:26.639 
recommend getting better bearings it's

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:29.599 
recommend getting better bearings it's
four<00:03:27.420> bearings<00:03:27.840> I<00:03:28.019> would<00:03:28.170> just<00:03:28.380> say<00:03:28.590> get<00:03:29.400> like

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609 
four bearings I would just say get like

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:31.479 
four bearings I would just say get like
the<00:03:29.760> most<00:03:29.940> expensive<00:03:30.299> bearings<00:03:30.959> you<00:03:31.019> can<00:03:31.170> buy

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489 
the most expensive bearings you can buy

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:35.660 
the most expensive bearings you can buy
because<00:03:32.489> they'll<00:03:32.940> make<00:03:33.180> it<00:03:33.329> super<00:03:33.900> fun<00:03:34.670> I'm

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
because they'll make it super fun I'm

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.020 
because they'll make it super fun I'm
gonna<00:03:35.880> probably<00:03:36.180> get<00:03:36.540> some<00:03:37.109> epic<00:03:37.410> nines

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
gonna probably get some epic nines

00:03:38.030 --> 00:04:02.589 
gonna probably get some epic nines
there's<00:03:39.030> some<00:03:39.239> bones<00:03:39.450> super<00:03:39.930> swiss<00:03:43.730> so<00:03:45.230> yeah

00:04:02.589 --> 00:04:02.599 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:05.979 

my<00:04:03.470> board<00:04:03.860> in<00:04:04.069> particular<00:04:04.569> is<00:04:05.569> I<00:04:05.689> bought<00:04:05.870> this

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:05.989 
my board in particular is I bought this

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:12.309 
my board in particular is I bought this
on<00:04:06.109> Amazon<00:04:06.260> so<00:04:07.239> I<00:04:08.290> would<00:04:09.290> recommend<00:04:11.140> Amazon<00:04:12.140> it

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:12.319 
on Amazon so I would recommend Amazon it

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:15.910 
on Amazon so I would recommend Amazon it
is<00:04:12.439> $30<00:04:13.129> cheaper<00:04:14.049> but<00:04:15.049> they<00:04:15.379> don't<00:04:15.680> it<00:04:15.829> doesn't

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 
is $30 cheaper but they don't it doesn't

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.810 
is $30 cheaper but they don't it doesn't
come<00:04:16.250> with<00:04:16.570> bearing<00:04:17.570> spacers<00:04:18.109> or<00:04:18.139> whatever<00:04:18.820> it

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
come with bearing spacers or whatever it

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.310 
come with bearing spacers or whatever it
doesn't<00:04:20.030> go<00:04:20.090> in<00:04:20.209> bearing<00:04:20.479> spacers<00:04:20.900> and<00:04:21.139> you

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 
doesn't go in bearing spacers and you

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.529 
doesn't go in bearing spacers and you
walked<00:04:21.650> up<00:04:21.799> you<00:04:21.919> definitely<00:04:22.039> want<00:04:22.400> those<00:04:22.580> next

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:23.539 
walked up you definitely want those next

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:24.610 
walked up you definitely want those next
time<00:04:23.660> I<00:04:23.750> get<00:04:23.930> I'm<00:04:24.139> gonna<00:04:24.199> get<00:04:24.410> some<00:04:24.530> new

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
time I get I'm gonna get some new

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.250 
time I get I'm gonna get some new
bearings<00:04:24.979> and<00:04:25.190> wheels<00:04:25.250> and<00:04:25.970> put<00:04:26.960> them<00:04:27.110> on

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
bearings and wheels and put them on

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:33.719 
bearings and wheels and put them on
there<00:04:28.449> but<00:04:29.449> the<00:04:31.330> it<00:04:32.330> also<00:04:32.510> does<00:04:32.870> not<00:04:33.020> come<00:04:33.350> with

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:33.729 
there but the it also does not come with

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:36.850 
there but the it also does not come with
better<00:04:34.729> bearings<00:04:35.300> because<00:04:35.690> on<00:04:36.169> the<00:04:36.410> sector<00:04:36.680> 9

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
better bearings because on the sector 9

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:42.879 
better bearings because on the sector 9
site<00:04:37.130> it<00:04:37.729> comes<00:04:38.000> with<00:04:38.330> I<00:04:39.070> believe<00:04:40.840> Nordic<00:04:41.889> MX

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:42.889 
site it comes with I believe Nordic MX

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:43.420 
site it comes with I believe Nordic MX
sevens

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
sevens

00:04:43.430 --> 00:05:14.760 
sevens
I<00:04:43.840> think<00:05:12.699> it'll<00:05:13.699> probably<00:05:13.760> go<00:05:14.060> away<00:05:14.150> though

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:14.770 
I think it'll probably go away though

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:23.680 
I think it'll probably go away though
also<00:05:20.710> completely<00:05:22.330> gone<00:05:23.330> like<00:05:23.570> I've

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:23.690 
also completely gone like I've

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:25.659 
also completely gone like I've
completely<00:05:24.020> made<00:05:24.229> this<00:05:24.349> board<00:05:24.620> go<00:05:24.830> sideways

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:25.669 
completely made this board go sideways

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:29.710 
completely made this board go sideways
it<00:05:25.880> didn't<00:05:26.270> get<00:05:26.330> real<00:05:26.510> white<00:05:27.580> so<00:05:28.580> guys<00:05:28.820> that

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:29.720 
it didn't get real white so guys that

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.430 
it didn't get real white so guys that
was<00:05:29.750> the<00:05:30.880> chamber<00:05:31.880> 2<00:05:32.090> Sidewinder<00:05:32.389> by<00:05:32.900> second<00:05:33.289> 9

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:33.440 
was the chamber 2 Sidewinder by second 9

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.940 
was the chamber 2 Sidewinder by second 9
and<00:05:33.770> the<00:05:34.580> second<00:05:34.970> 9b<00:05:35.539> HNC<00:05:36.020> slide<00:05:36.289> gloves

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:37.950 
and the second 9b HNC slide gloves

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:43.050 
and the second 9b HNC slide gloves
so<00:05:39.660> see<00:05:40.660> you<00:05:40.720> later<00:05:40.870> guys
