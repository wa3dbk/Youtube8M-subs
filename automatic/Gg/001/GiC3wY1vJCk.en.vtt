village<00:00:30.390> calm<00:00:30.840> which<00:00:31.560> downloads<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.610> file

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
village calm which downloads the file

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.840 
village calm which downloads the file
according<00:00:33.059> to<00:00:33.329> your<00:00:33.510> Windows<00:00:34.380> or<00:00:34.680> on<00:00:35.340> your<00:00:35.489> PC

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
according to your Windows or on your PC

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.150 
according to your Windows or on your PC
so<00:00:36.030> it's<00:00:36.600> like<00:00:36.809> a<00:00:36.960> succes<00:00:37.410> bit<00:00:37.920> architecture

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
so it's like a succes bit architecture

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.760 
so it's like a succes bit architecture
so<00:00:38.760> this<00:00:38.910> is<00:00:39.000> what<00:00:39.149> I<00:00:39.180> got<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:40.260> first<00:00:40.500> step<00:00:40.649> you

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
so this is what I got the first step you

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.830 
so this is what I got the first step you
should<00:00:40.800> do<00:00:41.100> is<00:00:41.250> make<00:00:41.280> a<00:00:41.520> copy<00:00:41.940> of<00:00:42.300> this<00:00:42.540> and

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
should do is make a copy of this and

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:49.310 
should do is make a copy of this and
name<00:00:43.829> it<00:00:43.980> as<00:00:44.190> let's<00:00:44.730> say<00:00:46.100> review<00:00:47.899> got'em<00:00:48.899> is

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
name it as let's say review got'em is

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.939 
name it as let's say review got'em is
Hugh<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:51.140> you<00:00:52.140> know<00:00:52.260> then<00:00:52.440> what<00:00:52.620> we'll<00:00:52.770> do<00:00:52.920> is

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:42.469 
file so so I'll just copy this part here
I'll<00:01:36.420> do<00:01:36.930> that<00:01:37.110> again<00:01:37.170> so<00:01:38.840> Windows<00:01:39.840> 8

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.330 

I'm<00:01:43.170> great<00:01:45.320> for<00:01:46.320> some<00:01:46.590> reason<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:46.979> command

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
I'm great for some reason the command

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.069 
I'm great for some reason the command
prompt<00:01:47.640> doesn't<00:01:48.829> recognize<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:50.659> spaces<00:01:51.659> so

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
prompt doesn't recognize the spaces so

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.330 
prompt doesn't recognize the spaces so
people<00:01:52.829> I'll<00:01:53.759> do<00:01:53.939> that<00:01:54.890> okay<00:01:55.890> so<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.219> one

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
people I'll do that okay so the one

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.010 
people I'll do that okay so the one
mistake<00:01:56.789> which<00:01:57.030> I<00:01:57.270> made<00:01:57.539> was<00:01:57.840> I<00:01:58.460> give<00:01:59.460> as<00:02:00.020> MSU

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
mistake which I made was I give as MSU

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:08.240 
mistake which I made was I give as MSU
but<00:02:01.289> instead<00:02:01.649> I<00:02:01.770> need<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:02.100> give<00:02:02.280> it<00:02:02.369> as<00:02:02.549> cab<00:02:07.250> so

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
but instead I need to give it as cab so

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.809 
but instead I need to give it as cab so
I<00:02:08.280> made<00:02:08.910> a<00:02:08.940> mistake<00:02:09.090> there<00:02:09.959> I<00:02:10.530> gave<00:02:10.950> it<00:02:11.069> as<00:02:11.220> MSU

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
I made a mistake there I gave it as MSU

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.520 
I made a mistake there I gave it as MSU
actually<00:02:12.239> I<00:02:12.299> need<00:02:12.450> to<00:02:12.480> give<00:02:12.690> it<00:02:12.720> a<00:02:12.840> scab<00:02:13.200> so

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
actually I need to give it a scab so

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.620 
actually I need to give it a scab so
there's<00:02:14.310> something<00:02:14.610> you<00:02:14.670> should<00:02:14.700> remember<00:02:15.150> so

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
there's something you should remember so

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.789 
there's something you should remember so
give<00:02:16.319> that<00:02:17.180> and<00:02:18.180> let's<00:02:18.569> see<00:02:18.780> if<00:02:18.900> it<00:02:19.019> works<00:02:19.410> it's

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:19.799 
give that and let's see if it works it's

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:23.089 
give that and let's see if it works it's
processing<00:02:20.610> second<00:02:21.150> time<00:02:21.390> so<00:02:21.690> big<00:02:22.590> chances

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
processing second time so big chances

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:26.390 
processing second time so big chances
that's<00:02:23.280> going<00:02:23.549> to<00:02:23.640> work<00:02:24.470> okay<00:02:25.470> so<00:02:25.530> they<00:02:26.069> both

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
that's going to work okay so they both

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.339 
that's going to work okay so they both
hundred<00:02:26.849> percent<00:02:27.209> complete<00:02:27.450> now<00:02:27.930> I'm<00:02:27.989> waiting

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
hundred percent complete now I'm waiting

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:33.920 
hundred percent complete now I'm waiting
for<00:02:28.709> a<00:02:28.970> final<00:02:30.349> result<00:02:32.450> and<00:02:33.450> I'll<00:02:33.630> have<00:02:33.780> to
