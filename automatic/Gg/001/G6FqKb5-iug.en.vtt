00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:09.599
 hehehe and very good to all friends of 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.820
 youtube again speaks to them skin of 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:16.520
 viper your reptilian assistant 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:19.220
 Well, this video that I'm going to show you is 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:22.279
 to see this product that I just 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:25.009
 iu to acquire for me and crested gecko 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:27.829
 for my terrarium because I dry 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:29.600
 I was having a little bit of trouble 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:32.750
 the time of the change 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:35.900
 and what we often do not take into 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:40.900
 account about this type of lizard 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.900
 reptile called eco create state 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:47.190
 this dry 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:50.840
 lives in tropical forest areas 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:55.820
 where the minimum humidity is from 60 to a 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:58.430
 70% maximum of 80 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:02.540
 because sometimes we have it in a terrarium and 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:04.720
 sometimes we forget about how it is so 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.490
 important humidity 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:10.480
 humidity is so important in this 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:15.580
 lizard that without it could not have a 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:17.980
 optimal or irregular development 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:21.040
 Well, here I just presented it to you 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:23.860
 lab flame show me what I finish 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:27.810
 to acquire is called rectify is a 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:30.790
 modifier exclusively for reptiles 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.620
 This can be useful for many 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:36.070
 snakes in the process of moving 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:39.760
 chameleons for like green iguanas all 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:42.220
 type of iguana then and all types of 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:45.580
 reptile animal exclusively that 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:47.800
 require high humidity as are 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.200
 geckos crested here see how my 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.590
 terrarium this terrarium is perfect for 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.850
 Dry believes state of the sommer laboratory 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.010
 this keyboard has a grid 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.950
 ventilation in the front 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:03.010
 what serves as a chimney because 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.600
 Ventilation enters and exits above 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:08.350
 we can have a game that was in a 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:10.869
 fish tank type terrarium and more when they are 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.580
 high because those animals being 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.060
 something real and they need enough 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.910
 height 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.010
 Iliana to climb if you are not 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.270
 Provides good ventilation can be 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.680
 this animal may also have 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.220
 difficulties like is that 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.220
 chameleons 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.099
 I've seen a lot on youtube 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:34.100
 person who has in play borrowed and what 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:37.970
 they have in slow but I started was and I do not know 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:42.020
 I do not like this kind of habitat that 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:44.780
 they give some to some people to these 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:47.330
 reptiles because it's as if we do not 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.860
 will force him to be in a 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:52.230
 habitat 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:55.290
 you are going to live there and 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.750
 that is your habitat no sir you like 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.360
 I have always let you know always 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.489
 has to orient and evaluate and 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.580
 study your reptile before taking it to 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:08.190
 house and so we learn a little from him his 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.319
 behavior its reproduction its 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.569
 nutrition nutrition your kind of 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:13.050
 therapy habitat temperature heating 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:16.200
 humidity 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.340
 all this factors after what 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.980
 we learn then we are already 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:24.670
 prepared to take a reptile home 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:26.650
 Well, like that weird 20, look how they look 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.720
 with high humidity I will show you the 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.870
 humidity right now as soon as you look 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.790
 the needle measures 180 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.490
 this is a verifier not necessarily 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:40.240
 they have to install it 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:42.590
 many hours a day or 24 hours with 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.880
 only one hour 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:48.000
 or two hours a day 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:50.970
 it's more than enough then I'm going to 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.890
 proceed have several speeds has 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.290
 minimum has maximum one container 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:58.840
 that is filled with water is water there 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:01.990
 to declare it because the humidity 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:04.030
 This is due to water 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:06.100
 if we leave it with heavy metals and 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:09.670
 chlorine then maybe it can make us 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:12.160
 damage to our erectile as the 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.430
 we declare and you have a conduit as you see 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:17.000
 here 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:20.480
 and here we proceed to 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:24.460
 look for a side of our terrarium 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:27.699
 to be able to put into operation 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:30.280
 the humidifier has maximum speed 

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:32.920
 and here we can graduate it the water what 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:36.370
 until minimum and so we can 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:38.860
 desire the humidity that we want 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.930
 that is, we can adjust the humidity that 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:44.440
 we want 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:47.320
 because we turned it off and already 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:50.100
 they see the sound they have has a good 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:52.700
 sound works very well 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:57.600
 this humidifier we can also 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:05:00.450
 place it with a thermos hygrometer or is 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:03.120
 a device that to measure as a 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:06.240
 thermostat that we have data we also have 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.890
 that have a combo come with a 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:11.390
 thermostat for temperature and also 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:13.460
 for the stopwatch for humidity and so 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:16.039
 we graduate 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:18.949
 the humidity that we want not 

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:21.020
 pass and that does not reach the minute of 

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:22.550
 we achieve the minimum and the maximum by 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:25.639
 example an echo that minimal state should 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:28.639
 be a maximum 60 to 180 we can put you 

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:30.770
 I fear it and we can put it 

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:34.460
 that does not go below 60 and that add more 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:36.110
 of 80 and so this device is going to 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:38.060
 to be turning off constant go up 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:41.960
 more than 80 when he's already showing 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:44.360
 As well as more than 80 and when 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:46.490
 lowers off 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:49.879
 that is, it turns off when it reaches the limit 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:53.509
 of 80 when the humidity is already going down 

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:55.289
 to a 60 to a 59 then it turns on 

00:05:53.509 --> 00:05:59.999
 automatically 

00:05:55.289 --> 00:06:02.339
 this thermostat for humidity I asked 

00:05:59.999 --> 00:06:04.589
 I will arrive soon because 

00:06:02.339 --> 00:06:07.499
 to not be turning off constant and so 

00:06:04.589 --> 00:06:10.409
 the humidity will be irregular and this 

00:06:07.499 --> 00:06:13.229
 also maybe it does not suit the 

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:15.880
 health of the game that was due to 

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:18.730
 what is going to have 

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:21.220
 is going to have a few hours of dryness and 

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:23.890
 other works and other works of humidity or 

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:25.660
 is going to have some arid hours that 

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:27.760
 comes being arid comes being the 

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:30.820
 term as dry since the end of 

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:33.100
 desert and tropical humidity 

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:35.770
 is going to have like this is going to have then maybe 

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:38.370
 is going to feel disoriented because if you 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:41.080
 liked the video about the product 

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:43.990
 skeptical of a modifier 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:45.940
 laboratory submit dale thumbs up and 

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:47.830
 Share it with your friends 

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:50.500
 subscribe if you have not done so 

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:54.180
 do not miss the next video then

 until next time
