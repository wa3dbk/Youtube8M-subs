the bottom of the plant as we can it's

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.060 
the bottom of the plant as we can it's
gonna<00:01:02.039> promote<00:01:02.660> additional<00:01:03.660> growth<00:01:04.070> newer

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
gonna promote additional growth newer

better berries way to identify and
holder<00:01:12.210> pain<00:01:12.479> just<00:01:13.260> look<00:01:13.710> at<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.400> diameter<00:01:14.760> of

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
holder pain just look at the diameter of

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.480 
holder pain just look at the diameter of
the<00:01:15.270> particular<00:01:15.840> piece<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.950> larger<00:01:17.340> the

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
the particular piece the larger the

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.690 
the particular piece the larger the
diameter<00:01:18.110> probably<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.290> older<00:01:19.619> it<00:01:19.740> is<00:01:19.860> as

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
diameter probably the older it is as

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.280 
diameter probably the older it is as
well<00:01:21.030> as<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.360> fact<00:01:21.630> that<00:01:21.810> it<00:01:21.930> becomes

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
well as the fact that it becomes

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.580 
well as the fact that it becomes
relatively<00:01:22.860> Twiggy<00:01:23.430> growth<00:01:23.689> with<00:01:24.689> very<00:01:25.080> few

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
relatively Twiggy growth with very few

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.880 
relatively Twiggy growth with very few
fruit<00:01:26.100> buds<00:01:26.369> at<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.880> end<00:01:27.409> so<00:01:28.409> we're<00:01:28.590> looking

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
fruit buds at the end so we're looking

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.109 
fruit buds at the end so we're looking
to<00:01:28.920> get<00:01:29.159> rid<00:01:29.340> of<00:01:29.369> that<00:01:29.579> it's<00:01:29.880> not<00:01:30.030> gonna

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
to get rid of that it's not gonna

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.270 
to get rid of that it's not gonna
produce<00:01:30.420> particularly<00:01:31.049> large<00:01:31.470> berries<00:01:31.979> nor

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
produce particularly large berries nor

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.600 
produce particularly large berries nor
large<00:01:32.549> numbers<00:01:33.060> of<00:01:33.090> berries<00:01:33.920> the<00:01:34.920> wood<00:01:35.159> is<00:01:35.369> old

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
large numbers of berries the wood is old

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.460 
large numbers of berries the wood is old
so<00:01:36.000> we're<00:01:36.150> gonna<00:01:36.270> take<00:01:36.540> it<00:01:36.720> out<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:37.140> as<00:01:37.320> I

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
so we're gonna take it out and as I

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.410 
so we're gonna take it out and as I
indicated<00:01:37.619> we<00:01:38.430> want<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.670> cut<00:01:38.850> it<00:01:38.970> as<00:01:39.119> close<00:01:39.390> to

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
indicated we want to cut it as close to

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.260 
indicated we want to cut it as close to
the<00:01:39.659> bottom<00:01:40.140> of<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.380> plant<00:01:40.680> as<00:01:40.890> we<00:01:41.040> can<00:01:41.310> so

that<00:02:12.690> may<00:02:12.900> be<00:02:12.959> in<00:02:13.230> that<00:02:13.410> plan<00:02:13.680> we're<00:02:14.220> trying<00:02:14.459> to

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
that may be in that plan we're trying to

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.390 
that may be in that plan we're trying to
keep<00:02:14.670> our<00:02:14.849> plant<00:02:15.180> as<00:02:15.480> clean<00:02:15.750> as<00:02:15.930> we<00:02:16.080> can<00:02:16.400> that

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
keep our plant as clean as we can that

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.880 
keep our plant as clean as we can that
was<00:02:17.610> probably<00:02:17.849> the<00:02:17.970> oldest<00:02:18.360> cane<00:02:18.599> in<00:02:18.780> this

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.420 

this<00:02:22.890> is<00:02:23.900> we're<00:02:24.900> gonna<00:02:24.959> take<00:02:25.290> it<00:02:25.500> out<00:02:25.680> as<00:02:25.890> well

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
this is we're gonna take it out as well

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.970 
this is we're gonna take it out as well
well<00:02:26.760> prune<00:02:27.060> out<00:02:27.270> as<00:02:27.450> much<00:02:27.629> as<00:02:27.840> 20%<00:02:28.410> of<00:02:28.860> this

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
well prune out as much as 20% of this

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.229 
well prune out as much as 20% of this
plant<00:02:29.280> each<00:02:29.520> year

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:37.270 

there<00:02:35.239> are<00:02:35.330> a<00:02:35.360> couple<00:02:35.480> of<00:02:35.690> small<00:02:36.280> branches

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
there are a couple of small branches

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.670 
there are a couple of small branches
less<00:02:37.700> diameter<00:02:38.330> now<00:02:38.510> and<00:02:38.989> are<00:02:39.110> very<00:02:39.260> tricky

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
less diameter now and are very tricky

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.740 
less diameter now and are very tricky
and<00:02:40.010> a<00:02:40.069> branch<00:02:40.370> very<00:02:40.730> close<00:02:40.970> to<00:02:41.180> the<00:02:41.300> bottom<00:02:41.660> of

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
and a branch very close to the bottom of

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.690 
and a branch very close to the bottom of
the<00:02:41.840> plant<00:02:42.110> would<00:02:42.769> like<00:02:42.980> to<00:02:43.129> take<00:02:43.310> those<00:02:43.519> out

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
the plant would like to take those out

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.640 
the plant would like to take those out
too<00:02:44.000> because<00:02:44.300> we<00:02:44.450> want<00:02:44.629> the<00:02:44.750> fruit<00:02:44.989> up<00:02:45.200> on<00:02:45.410> top

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
too because we want the fruit up on top

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.100 
too because we want the fruit up on top
so<00:02:46.489> I'm<00:02:47.090> gonna<00:02:47.239> reach<00:02:47.420> in<00:02:47.629> here<00:02:47.810> with<00:02:47.989> this

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
so I'm gonna reach in here with this

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.589 
so I'm gonna reach in here with this
pair<00:02:48.319> lockers<00:02:48.800> and<00:02:48.950> just<00:02:49.129> kinda<00:02:50.120> wait<00:02:50.300> till<00:02:50.510> I

00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:50.599 
pair lockers and just kinda wait till I

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:54.160 
pair lockers and just kinda wait till I
get<00:02:50.780> rid<00:02:50.930> of<00:02:51.019> some<00:02:51.260> of<00:02:51.349> that<00:02:51.380> piggy<00:02:51.860> growth<00:02:53.170> and

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
get rid of some of that piggy growth and

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.140 
get rid of some of that piggy growth and
see<00:02:54.410> how<00:02:54.560> we're<00:02:54.769> doing<00:02:54.800> on<00:02:55.340> the<00:02:55.550> middle<00:02:55.849> and

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
see how we're doing on the middle and

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.420 
see how we're doing on the middle and
opening<00:02:56.599> it<00:02:56.690> up<00:02:56.840> and<00:02:57.110> making<00:02:57.800> this<00:02:57.950> thing<00:02:58.190> grow

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
opening it up and making this thing grow

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.449 
opening it up and making this thing grow
very<00:02:58.730> vertical<00:02:59.470> it<00:03:00.470> would<00:03:00.620> also<00:03:00.769> help<00:03:01.099> if<00:03:01.340> you

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
very vertical it would also help if you

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:05.500 
very vertical it would also help if you
have<00:03:01.670> a<00:03:02.170> set<00:03:03.170> of<00:03:03.319> hand<00:03:03.560> pruners<00:03:03.830> with<00:03:04.190> you<00:03:04.510> we

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
have a set of hand pruners with you we

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.170 
have a set of hand pruners with you we
use<00:03:05.660> these<00:03:05.840> for<00:03:05.900> the<00:03:06.200> smaller<00:03:06.530> cuts<00:03:06.970> and<00:03:07.970> keep

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
use these for the smaller cuts and keep

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.660 
use these for the smaller cuts and keep
the<00:03:08.330> bush<00:03:08.540> clean<00:03:08.900> here's<00:03:09.620> a<00:03:09.680> crossover<00:03:10.220> branch

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
the bush clean here's a crossover branch

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.910 
the bush clean here's a crossover branch
that<00:03:10.910> we're<00:03:11.060> gonna<00:03:11.150> take<00:03:11.480> out<00:03:11.690> of<00:03:11.959> this

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
that we're gonna take out of this

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.760 
that we're gonna take out of this
particular<00:03:13.310> bush

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 
particular bush

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:16.340 
particular bush
because<00:03:15.100> it's<00:03:15.250> growing<00:03:15.520> into<00:03:15.760> the<00:03:15.880> center

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
because it's growing into the center

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.230 
because it's growing into the center
just<00:03:17.350> take<00:03:17.530> that<00:03:17.710> one<00:03:17.860> out<00:03:18.040> and<00:03:18.730> throw<00:03:19.090> it<00:03:19.120> away

just take that one out and throw it away

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.550 
just take that one out and throw it away
over<00:03:19.570> there<00:03:19.720> on<00:03:19.840> the<00:03:19.930> ground<00:03:20.140> for<00:03:20.350> later

good air circulation and we're keeping
it<00:04:29.580> growing<00:04:30.060> vertically<00:04:30.920> now<00:04:31.920> as<00:04:32.070> I<00:04:32.190> begin<00:04:32.490> to

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:32.640 
it growing vertically now as I begin to

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.970 
it growing vertically now as I begin to
look<00:04:32.790> we<00:04:33.270> have<00:04:33.420> one<00:04:33.690> major<00:04:33.960> crossover<00:04:34.590> fridge

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:34.980
