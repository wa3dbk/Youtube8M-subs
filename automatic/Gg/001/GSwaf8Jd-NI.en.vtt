firstly we do the settings on 560 mark 3

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.140 
firstly we do the settings on 560 mark 3
for<00:00:14.880> that<00:00:15.350> make<00:00:16.350> sure<00:00:16.560> your<00:00:16.949> 560<00:00:17.490> mark<00:00:17.699> 3<00:00:17.880> is<00:00:18.000> on

for that make sure your 560 mark 3 is on

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.779 
for that make sure your 560 mark 3 is on
our<00:00:18.359> effort<00:00:18.960> trigger<00:00:19.710> more<00:00:19.949> so<00:00:20.130> that<00:00:20.250> it<00:00:20.400> will

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
our effort trigger more so that it will

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.480 
our effort trigger more so that it will
receive<00:00:21.090> signals<00:00:21.449> from<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.869> 560<00:00:22.859> TX<00:00:23.100> for<00:00:23.369> that

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
receive signals from the 560 TX for that

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.650 
receive signals from the 560 TX for that
