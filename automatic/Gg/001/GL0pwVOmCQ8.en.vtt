00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.920
 and this one today under my video camera 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.719
 we have the cat game capture hd 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.390
 let's start immediately with the unboxing of this one 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.579
 small is very practical 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.530
 acquisition the box of this game 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.600
 capsules and very appealing as 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.309
 opens as if it were a book is in 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.870
 first, of course, we find the 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.640
 acquisition card that really is 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.500
 very small that will go to see in 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.570
 followed is on the left we find 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.610
 let's say a little magician's bed 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.759
 instructions on how to start using 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.320
 our new game capture 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:09.090
 take a moment the card 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.250
 take a quick look at it is 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.899
 let's put it a little aside because 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.679
 I want to analyze the content first 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:16.409
 of the box 

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:17.700
 we open it is this space that is found below 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.170
 precisely the acquisition and back 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.149
 we will find many accessories now 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.979
 we're going to analyze one by one 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:25.259
 the endowment of this game capture is 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.080
 very rich first we can 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.970
 note the data cable that goes from usb 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.830
 standard that allows connection to 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.009
 pc to mini usb 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.690
 after we find the hdmi cable is really a 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.820
 very short cable I always recommend 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:42.960
 buy 2 and then you will understand why 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:45.210
 is then we find the adapter for per 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.520
 the ps3, that is, a connector goes 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.680
 track is another connector and to the scale 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.899
 tradition via jack s video and then 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.719
 this component adapter can 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.659
 be used with the xbox in the event not 

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:59.820
 we have precisely xbox with hdmi output 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.579
 let us now analyze the game 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.200
 capsule hd is really a very card 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.460
 very small I have never seen card 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.020
 acquisition that records in high 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.450
 definition of these dimensions 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.549
 however as you can see is the 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.980
 box was covered with this 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:16.769
 casing that protected it from scratches 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.380
 the card is a lot during transport 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:21.269
 elegant finished with this glossy black 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.820
 and on the top we can find 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:26.220
 the game capture hd and delegate logo 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:29.730
 the cans the end we can find 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.560
 the dvi and hdmi inputs in and turning the 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:35.070
 tab on the other side we can find 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:37.950
 obviously the HDMI output and the input 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:40.440
 usb to power it and to connect it to 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.360
 pc as you have noticed in this 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.230
 acquisition card not by cable of 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.220
 supply 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.930
 this simply because 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.790
 the acquisition card is fed 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.740
 through five times they come from 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.890
 pc thanks to usb cable 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:55.630
 only sore point in accessories 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.880
 of this acquisition card not 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.990
 a second hdmi cable is given but ne 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.340
 only one is given 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:02.830
 so if we would like to use maybe 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.990
 the ps3 to make the record we want to record 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:07.420
 hdmi cable themes and we don't have a cable 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:09.910
 hdmi at home we have to buy it for 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.680
 force another so this is the only one 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.350
 neo but if we already have one 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.340
 console connected with the hdmi cable to 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.590
 our tv we shouldn't have 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.150
 this is not a problem at all 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.160
 it was all about this new card 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.990
 acquisition if you are curious if this 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.000
 acquisition card can register the 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:26.950
 gameplay coming from the pc the answer 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.450
 is yes and look at the link description that 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.740
 I did a beautiful tutorial if the 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.120
 video liked invitation leave me not 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:33.120
 like it's bye bye
