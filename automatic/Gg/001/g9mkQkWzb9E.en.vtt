00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
thumb strap slides into that and then

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.170 
thumb strap slides into that and then
you<00:02:26.340> want<00:02:26.520> to<00:02:26.550> go<00:02:26.700> ahead<00:02:26.790> and<00:02:27.000> you<00:02:27.060> can

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
you want to go ahead and you can

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.540 
you want to go ahead and you can
actually<00:02:27.360> see<00:02:27.840> here<00:02:28.110> let's<00:02:28.920> see<00:02:29.040> if<00:02:29.190> the

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
actually see here let's see if the

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.330 
actually see here let's see if the
camera<00:02:29.730> can<00:02:30.000> grab<00:02:30.239> this<00:02:30.450> for<00:02:30.720> us<00:02:31.100> right<00:02:32.100> here

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
camera can grab this for us right here

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.540 
camera can grab this for us right here
Eric<00:02:33.650> it's<00:02:34.650> going<00:02:34.830> to<00:02:34.890> be<00:02:34.950> kind<00:02:35.160> of<00:02:35.220> tough<00:02:35.280> to

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
Eric it's going to be kind of tough to

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:36.800 
Eric it's going to be kind of tough to
see<00:02:35.730> I<00:02:35.760> think<00:02:35.970> with<00:02:36.120> a<00:02:36.150> camera<00:02:36.480> but<00:02:36.510> you<00:02:36.690> can

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
see I think with a camera but you can

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.570 
see I think with a camera but you can
actually<00:02:36.959> see<00:02:37.350> the<00:02:37.470> locator<00:02:37.920> pin<00:02:38.190> down<00:02:38.370> on

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
actually see the locator pin down on

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:39.949 
actually see the locator pin down on
this<00:02:38.670> channel<00:02:38.940> it's<00:02:39.120> really<00:02:39.420> clear<00:02:39.690> where<00:02:39.870> it

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
this channel it's really clear where it

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:41.509 
this channel it's really clear where it
needs<00:02:40.140> to<00:02:40.230> go<00:02:40.319> so<00:02:40.470> you<00:02:41.010> know<00:02:41.100> all<00:02:41.160> you<00:02:41.250> have<00:02:41.400> to

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
needs to go so you know all you have to

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:43.009 
needs to go so you know all you have to
do<00:02:41.640> is<00:02:41.730> just<00:02:41.880> kind<00:02:42.090> of<00:02:42.180> take<00:02:42.330> a<00:02:42.360> little<00:02:42.569> look<00:02:42.810> at

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
do is just kind of take a little look at

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:45.080 
do is just kind of take a little look at
it<00:02:43.140> here<00:02:43.319> as<00:02:43.410> you're<00:02:43.560> gone<00:02:43.709> dip<00:02:44.640> it<00:02:44.790> in<00:02:44.880> there

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
it here as you're gone dip it in there

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.210 
it here as you're gone dip it in there
you<00:02:45.930> know<00:02:46.019> push<00:02:46.290> it<00:02:46.410> down<00:02:46.590> you'll<00:02:46.769> feel<00:02:47.069> it

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
you know push it down you'll feel it

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.900 
you know push it down you'll feel it
engage<00:02:47.550> it<00:02:48.150> goes<00:02:48.330> right<00:02:48.660> in<00:02:49.280> piece<00:02:50.280> of<00:02:50.459> cake

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
engage it goes right in piece of cake

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.910 
engage it goes right in piece of cake
you<00:02:51.120> know<00:02:51.209> something<00:02:51.630> this<00:02:51.750> expensive<00:02:52.019> you

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
you know something this expensive you

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.350 
you know something this expensive you
know<00:02:53.010> certainly<00:02:53.459> I<00:02:53.489> think<00:02:53.580> it's<00:02:53.880> important

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
know certainly I think it's important

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.870 
know certainly I think it's important
that<00:02:54.390> it<00:02:54.630> is<00:02:54.720> serviceable<00:02:55.410> especially<00:02:55.980> to<00:02:56.760> be

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
that it is serviceable especially to be

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.789 
that it is serviceable especially to be
able<00:02:57.060> to<00:02:57.120> wash<00:02:57.360> it<00:02:57.600> and<00:02:57.720> clean<00:02:57.870> it<00:02:58.140> and<00:02:58.319> if

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
able to wash it and clean it and if

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:01.630 
able to wash it and clean it and if
you're<00:02:58.950> a<00:02:58.980> rider<00:02:59.250> that<00:02:59.430> rides<00:02:59.790> quite<00:03:00.239> a<00:03:00.269> bit

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
you're a rider that rides quite a bit

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.090 
you're a rider that rides quite a bit
you're<00:03:02.640> going<00:03:02.790> to<00:03:02.850> get<00:03:03.030> to<00:03:03.180> a<00:03:03.209> point<00:03:03.480> where

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
you're going to get to a point where

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.039 
you're going to get to a point where
before<00:03:05.100> the<00:03:05.489> helmet<00:03:05.850> expires<00:03:06.299> I<00:03:06.600> think<00:03:06.870> a

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
before the helmet expires I think a

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:09.229 
before the helmet expires I think a
liner<00:03:07.380> replacement<00:03:08.100> is<00:03:08.190> a<00:03:08.220> good<00:03:08.459> idea<00:03:08.580> because

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
liner replacement is a good idea because

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:11.330 
liner replacement is a good idea because
it<00:03:09.780> does<00:03:10.019> a<00:03:10.049> few<00:03:10.319> different<00:03:10.620> things<00:03:10.769> one<00:03:11.130> it

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
it does a few different things one it

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.890 
it does a few different things one it
makes<00:03:11.519> the<00:03:11.670> helmet<00:03:11.819> smell<00:03:12.209> a<00:03:12.239> whole<00:03:12.540> heck<00:03:12.720> of<00:03:12.810> a

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
makes the helmet smell a whole heck of a

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.559 
makes the helmet smell a whole heck of a
lot<00:03:12.989> better<00:03:13.049> and<00:03:13.560> two<00:03:14.370> it's<00:03:15.120> going<00:03:15.269> to<00:03:15.360> take

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569 
lot better and two it's going to take

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:17.330 
lot better and two it's going to take
the<00:03:15.720> fifth<00:03:15.930> right<00:03:16.290> back<00:03:16.620> to<00:03:16.890> where<00:03:17.069> it<00:03:17.190> was

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
the fifth right back to where it was

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.640 
the fifth right back to where it was
basically<00:03:18.299> on<00:03:18.510> the<00:03:18.600> first<00:03:18.870> day<00:03:19.080> you<00:03:19.110> got<00:03:19.260> it

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
basically on the first day you got it

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:20.270 
basically on the first day you got it
okay

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
okay

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.460 
okay
the<00:03:20.640> EPS<00:03:20.970> does<00:03:21.390> break<00:03:21.660> in<00:03:21.840> a<00:03:21.900> little<00:03:22.140> bit<00:03:22.260> for

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
the EPS does break in a little bit for

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.740 
the EPS does break in a little bit for
your<00:03:22.590> head<00:03:22.799> and<00:03:23.209> that<00:03:24.209> happens<00:03:24.600> pretty

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
your head and that happens pretty

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.229 
your head and that happens pretty
quickly<00:03:25.140> but<00:03:25.980> you<00:03:26.190> know<00:03:26.280> over<00:03:26.579> time<00:03:26.790> you<00:03:27.150> know

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
quickly but you know over time you know

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:28.520 
quickly but you know over time you know
if<00:03:27.359> you're<00:03:27.510> a<00:03:27.540> guy<00:03:27.720> that's<00:03:27.959> going<00:03:28.079> to<00:03:28.170> keep<00:03:28.350> one
