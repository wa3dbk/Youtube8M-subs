00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
was having I guess you could call it a

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.150 
was having I guess you could call it a
discussion<00:00:38.399> with<00:00:39.350> someone<00:00:40.350> on<00:00:40.530> their<00:00:40.739> channel

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
discussion with someone on their channel

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.100 
discussion with someone on their channel
and<00:00:41.370> it<00:00:41.579> was<00:00:41.670> about<00:00:41.790> what<00:00:42.059> makes<00:00:42.239> a<00:00:42.390> good<00:00:42.690> perk

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
and it was about what makes a good perk

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.150 
and it was about what makes a good perk
and<00:00:43.350> in<00:00:44.280> short<00:00:45.410> what<00:00:46.410> I<00:00:46.440> got<00:00:46.710> out<00:00:46.739> of<00:00:46.890> that

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
and in short what I got out of that

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.930 
and in short what I got out of that
would<00:00:47.309> basically<00:00:47.960> perks<00:00:48.960> are<00:00:49.280> only<00:00:50.280> good<00:00:50.700> if

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
would basically perks are only good if

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.529 
would basically perks are only good if
they're<00:00:51.270> tailored<00:00:51.690> to<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.020> maps<00:00:52.320> elements<00:00:53.539> so

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
they're tailored to the maps elements so

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.930 
they're tailored to the maps elements so
what<00:00:54.840> I<00:00:54.870> mean<00:00:55.020> by<00:00:55.140> that<00:00:55.230> is<00:00:55.410> for<00:00:55.980> instance<00:00:56.370> PhD

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
what I mean by that is for instance PhD

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.729 
what I mean by that is for instance PhD
flopper<00:00:57.090> would<00:00:57.449> have<00:00:57.570> been<00:00:57.690> fantastic<00:00:58.350> on<00:00:58.530> die

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
flopper would have been fantastic on die

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.410 
flopper would have been fantastic on die
rise<00:00:59.010> because<00:00:59.550> die<00:00:59.730> rise<00:00:59.940> has<00:01:00.120> all<00:01:00.270> those

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
rise because die rise has all those

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.130 
rise because die rise has all those
Falls<00:01:00.809> but<00:01:01.609> origins<00:01:02.609> doesn't<00:01:03.539> really<00:01:03.660> need<00:01:03.930> it

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
Falls but origins doesn't really need it

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.080 
Falls but origins doesn't really need it
even<00:01:04.379> though<00:01:04.470> it<00:01:04.559> has<00:01:04.769> it<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.220> so<00:01:05.760> it's<00:01:05.909> kind

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
even though it has it and so it's kind

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.899 
even though it has it and so it's kind
of<00:01:06.119> a<00:01:06.210> useless<00:01:06.510> perk<00:01:06.900> when<00:01:07.350> on<00:01:07.619> origins<00:01:08.250> that's

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
of a useless perk when on origins that's

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.300 
of a useless perk when on origins that's
basically<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.420> gist<00:01:09.720> of<00:01:09.900> what<00:01:10.710> I<00:01:10.740> took<00:01:10.830> out<00:01:11.130> of

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
basically the gist of what I took out of

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.330 
basically the gist of what I took out of
that<00:01:11.490> so<00:01:12.299> taking<00:01:13.229> that<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:13.590> applying<00:01:13.950> it<00:01:14.159> to

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
that so taking that and applying it to

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.240 
that so taking that and applying it to
this<00:01:14.580> question<00:01:15.200> we<00:01:16.200> can<00:01:16.439> kind<00:01:16.619> of<00:01:16.740> determine

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
this question we can kind of determine

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.850 
this question we can kind of determine
that<00:01:17.369> these<00:01:17.580> are<00:01:17.820> overall<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.840> most<00:01:18.869> useful

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
that these are overall the most useful

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.030

all in fact it would be considered

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.830 
all in fact it would be considered
useless<00:02:45.570> and<00:02:45.930> a<00:02:45.959> waste<00:02:45.990> of<00:02:46.440> two<00:02:46.950> grand<00:02:47.540> so<00:02:48.540> this

useless and a waste of two grand so this

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.390 
useless and a waste of two grand so this
kind<00:02:49.050> of<00:02:49.140> shows<00:02:49.290> that<00:02:49.470> PhD<00:02:49.920> flopper<00:02:50.040> is<00:02:50.340> a

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
kind of shows that PhD flopper is a

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.790 
kind of shows that PhD flopper is a
situational<00:02:51.240> perk<00:02:51.540> not<00:02:51.810> just<00:02:52.080> a<00:02:52.200> generally

many<00:05:22.900> points<00:05:23.470> on<00:05:23.590> a<00:05:23.650> perk<00:05:24.010> that<00:05:24.220> is<00:05:24.370> not

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610 
many points on a perk that is not

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.390 
many points on a perk that is not
necessary<00:05:25.450> to<00:05:25.750> survival<00:05:26.110> when<00:05:26.740> all<00:05:26.920> four

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:27.400 
necessary to survival when all four

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.180 
necessary to survival when all four
original<00:05:27.850> perks<00:05:28.390> are<00:05:28.630> more<00:05:29.080> useful<00:05:29.290> and<00:05:29.740> way

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:30.190 
original perks are more useful and way

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:33.240 
original perks are more useful and way
cheaper<00:05:30.480> so<00:05:31.480> in<00:05:31.780> my<00:05:32.230> opinion<00:05:32.320> this<00:05:32.800> is<00:05:32.860> not

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.250 
cheaper so in my opinion this is not

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:36.690 
cheaper so in my opinion this is not
worth<00:05:33.730> buying<00:05:34.150> in<00:05:34.510> any<00:05:35.050> map<00:05:35.460> another<00:05:36.460> good

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:36.700 
worth buying in any map another good

worth buying in any map another good
example<00:05:36.820> of<00:05:37.330> this<00:05:37.480> would<00:05:37.780> be<00:05:37.840> who's<00:05:38.230> who<00:05:38.590> and

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:38.830 
example of this would be who's who and

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.250 
example of this would be who's who and
the<00:05:39.130> price<00:05:39.370> tag<00:05:39.640> is<00:05:39.850> not<00:05:40.180> that<00:05:40.420> bad<00:05:40.660> news<00:05:41.050> too

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:41.260

it's<00:05:41.560> another<00:05:41.830> perk<00:05:42.130> that's<00:05:42.370> just<00:05:42.610> 2,000

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:43.300 
it's another perk that's just 2,000

it's another perk that's just 2,000
points<00:05:43.420> very<00:05:43.960> reasonable<00:05:44.680> however<00:05:45.460> I<00:05:45.730> don't

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:45.940 
points very reasonable however I don't

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:48.120

electric cherry and I believe that the

only reason they put PhD flopper in was

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:13.260

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:15.760 
it even though it wasn't too useful I

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:18.300 
it even though it wasn't too useful I
believe<00:07:16.419> that<00:07:16.449> if<00:07:16.750> there<00:07:16.930> was<00:07:17.080> no<00:07:17.310> popular

seen vulture aid within the map because
