00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.700 
were dancing sharks at the Super Bowl
are<00:01:35.040> these<00:01:35.369> sharks<00:01:35.759> running<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.210> NFL<00:01:36.750> let's

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
are these sharks running the NFL let's

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.670 
are these sharks running the NFL let's
get<00:01:37.979> out<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.310> calculator<00:01:38.340> x'<00:01:39.110> shark<00:01:40.110> has<00:01:40.380> five

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
get out the calculator x' shark has five

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.100 
get out the calculator x' shark has five
letters<00:01:40.950> but<00:01:41.700> there<00:01:41.909> were<00:01:42.030> only<00:01:42.060> two<00:01:42.540> sharks

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
letters but there were only two sharks

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.200 
letters but there were only two sharks
five<00:01:44.040> does<00:01:44.280> not<00:01:44.460> equal<00:01:44.790> two

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
five does not equal two

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.139 
five does not equal two
therefore<00:01:46.170> that<00:01:46.380> is<00:01:46.500> not<00:01:46.680> right<00:01:46.979> it<00:01:47.700> is<00:01:47.909> left

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
therefore that is not right it is left

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.560 
therefore that is not right it is left
we'll<00:01:49.140> wait<00:01:49.439> a<00:01:49.470> minute<00:01:49.610> left<00:01:50.610> there<00:01:51.329> was<00:01:51.509> a
