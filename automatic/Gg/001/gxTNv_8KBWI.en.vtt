00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.679 
reality of what we're doing with these
things<00:01:30.240> these<00:01:30.420> days

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
things these days

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.660 
things these days
yeah<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.290> look<00:01:31.409> I<00:01:31.530> think<00:01:31.560> these<00:01:31.950> these<00:01:32.009> really

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
yeah and look I think these these really

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.370 
yeah and look I think these these really
are<00:01:32.820> they're<00:01:33.090> pitched<00:01:33.299> at<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.930> desktop

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
are they're pitched at the the desktop

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.740 
are they're pitched at the the desktop
monitoring<00:01:34.860> market<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:35.520> when<00:01:36.450> you<00:01:36.570> want

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
monitoring market and when you want

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.270 
monitoring market and when you want
something<00:01:37.200> that's<00:01:37.380> better<00:01:37.650> than<00:01:37.829> computer

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
something that's better than computer

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.429 
something that's better than computer
speakers<00:01:38.729> but<00:01:39.420> you<00:01:39.540> don't<00:01:39.720> necessarily<00:01:39.869> have

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
speakers but you don't necessarily have

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.760 
speakers but you don't necessarily have
you<00:01:40.829> know<00:01:40.979> really<00:01:41.310> fancy<00:01:41.850> DAC<00:01:42.659> involved<00:01:43.259> or<00:01:43.409> an

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
you know really fancy DAC involved or an

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.560 
you know really fancy DAC involved or an
interface<00:01:44.159> or<00:01:44.340> anything<00:01:44.490> like<00:01:44.729> that<00:01:44.759> you<00:01:45.450> know

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
interface or anything like that you know

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.679 
interface or anything like that you know
this<00:01:45.840> this<00:01:46.170> is<00:01:46.229> a<00:01:46.439> perfect<00:01:47.130> solution<00:01:47.600> you<00:01:48.600> know

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
this this is a perfect solution you know

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.929 
this this is a perfect solution you know
that<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.409> level<00:01:49.740> you<00:01:49.860> get<00:01:50.040> out<00:01:50.189> of<00:01:50.340> them<00:01:50.460> is<00:01:50.490> is

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
that the level you get out of them is is

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.910 
that the level you get out of them is is
quite<00:01:51.299> solid<00:01:51.689> for<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.170> for<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.560> amount<00:01:52.829> of

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
quite solid for the for the amount of

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.859 
quite solid for the for the amount of
driver<00:01:53.250> space<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:53.970> cabinet<00:01:54.360> volume<00:01:54.689> they've

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
driver space and cabinet volume they've

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.990 
driver space and cabinet volume they've
got<00:01:55.079> I<00:01:55.380> reckon<00:01:56.100> they'd<00:01:56.250> they<00:01:56.610> do<00:01:56.670> a<00:01:56.790> pretty

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
got I reckon they'd they do a pretty

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.230 
got I reckon they'd they do a pretty
good<00:01:57.149> job<00:01:57.560> the<00:01:58.560> limiting<00:01:58.979> on<00:01:59.130> them<00:01:59.310> is<00:01:59.490> is<00:01:59.820> the

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
good job the limiting on them is is the

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.300 
good job the limiting on them is is the
most<00:02:00.420> aggressive<00:02:00.750> thing<00:02:01.170> I've<00:02:01.290> heard<00:02:01.469> the

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
most aggressive thing I've heard the

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.709 
most aggressive thing I've heard the
only<00:02:02.520> negative<00:02:03.060> thing<00:02:03.090> I<00:02:03.299> can<00:02:03.450> say<00:02:03.600> about

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
only negative thing I can say about

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.179 
only negative thing I can say about
these<00:02:03.960> is<00:02:04.140> what<00:02:04.320> happens<00:02:04.680> when<00:02:04.799> you<00:02:04.890> push<00:02:05.070> them

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
these is what happens when you push them

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.010 
these is what happens when you push them
too<00:02:05.369> far<00:02:05.549> which<00:02:05.790> is<00:02:05.939> they<00:02:06.270> get<00:02:06.420> out<00:02:06.689> that<00:02:06.869> the

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
too far which is they get out that the

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.109 
too far which is they get out that the
stock<00:02:07.380> does<00:02:07.680> stuff<00:02:07.979> which<00:02:08.220> is<00:02:08.250> no<00:02:08.610> maybe<00:02:08.970> no

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
stock does stuff which is no maybe no

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.150 
stock does stuff which is no maybe no
bad<00:02:09.300> thing

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
bad thing

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.340 
bad thing
but<00:02:10.490> the<00:02:10.640> thing<00:02:10.820> is<00:02:10.850> I<00:02:11.090> think<00:02:11.140> what<00:02:12.140> plays

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
but the thing is I think what plays

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:13.960 
but the thing is I think what plays
against<00:02:12.800> that<00:02:12.920> limiting<00:02:13.280> is<00:02:13.400> that<00:02:13.550> it's<00:02:13.850> a

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
against that limiting is that it's a

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.240 
against that limiting is that it's a
very<00:02:14.150> brief<00:02:14.480> stop<00:02:14.930> staff<00:02:15.350> yeah<00:02:15.710> you<00:02:15.890> know<00:02:16.100> it's

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
very brief stop staff yeah you know it's

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.130 
very brief stop staff yeah you know it's
like<00:02:16.430> it's<00:02:16.580> really<00:02:16.850> fast<00:02:17.180> attack<00:02:17.570> and<00:02:17.780> really

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
like it's really fast attack and really

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.820 
like it's really fast attack and really
fast<00:02:18.350> release<00:02:18.770> yeah<00:02:19.220> on<00:02:19.430> the<00:02:20.050> on<00:02:21.050> the<00:02:21.440> limiting

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
fast release yeah on the on the limiting

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.950 
fast release yeah on the on the limiting
so<00:02:22.370> look<00:02:22.550> up<00:02:22.670> I<00:02:22.970> mean<00:02:23.180> it<00:02:23.300> is<00:02:23.420> what<00:02:23.570> it<00:02:23.600> is<00:02:23.780> as

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:23.960 
so look up I mean it is what it is as

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.230 
so look up I mean it is what it is as
long<00:02:23.990> as<00:02:24.110> you<00:02:24.290> sort<00:02:24.470> of<00:02:25.150> listing<00:02:26.150> it

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
long as you sort of listing it

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.480 
long as you sort of listing it
comfortable<00:02:26.750> levels<00:02:27.110> then<00:02:27.620> you<00:02:28.250> know<00:02:28.340> and

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
comfortable levels then you know and

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:29.860 
comfortable levels then you know and
they're<00:02:28.610> more<00:02:28.730> than<00:02:28.880> capable<00:02:29.090> of<00:02:29.450> sustaining

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
they're more than capable of sustaining

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.800 
they're more than capable of sustaining
quite<00:02:30.620> comfortable<00:02:31.130> listening<00:02:31.280> ones<00:02:31.670> and<00:02:32.660> I

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
quite comfortable listening ones and I

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.300 
quite comfortable listening ones and I
think<00:02:32.840> that<00:02:33.140> is<00:02:33.230> probably<00:02:33.350> a<00:02:33.650> good<00:02:33.860> thing<00:02:34.130> you

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
think that is probably a good thing you

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:35.860 
think that is probably a good thing you
know<00:02:34.430> I<00:02:34.460> think<00:02:34.610> if<00:02:34.850> it<00:02:34.970> encourages<00:02:35.510> people<00:02:35.690> to

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
know I think if it encourages people to

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.900 
know I think if it encourages people to
monitor<00:02:36.260> at<00:02:36.380> sensible<00:02:36.830> levels<00:02:37.160> yeah<00:02:37.400> yeah

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
monitor at sensible levels yeah yeah

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.450 
monitor at sensible levels yeah yeah
good<00:02:38.350> you<00:02:39.350> know<00:02:39.410> avoid<00:02:39.590> the<00:02:39.860> the<00:02:39.890> fatigue

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:40.460 
good you know avoid the the fatigue

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.340 
good you know avoid the the fatigue
factor<00:02:40.820> and<00:02:41.360> and<00:02:41.630> you<00:02:41.840> know<00:02:41.930> hearing<00:02:42.230> damage

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
factor and and you know hearing damage

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.500 
factor and and you know hearing damage
look<00:02:43.040> I<00:02:43.250> just<00:02:43.280> can't<00:02:43.640> get<00:02:43.880> over<00:02:43.940> these<00:02:44.300> huh

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
look I just can't get over these huh

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.350 
look I just can't get over these huh
yeah<00:02:45.010> it's<00:02:46.010> just<00:02:46.130> stupidly<00:02:46.820> good<00:02:47.090> for<00:02:47.300> the

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
yeah it's just stupidly good for the

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.930 
yeah it's just stupidly good for the
money<00:02:47.570> and<00:02:47.840> I<00:02:48.500> can't<00:02:49.160> think<00:02:49.550> of<00:02:49.700> anything

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
money and I can't think of anything

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.240 
money and I can't think of anything
better
