hair of my eyebrows and I will use a
very<00:00:32.160> light<00:00:32.579> hand<00:00:32.940> when<00:00:33.270> doing<00:00:33.600> this<00:00:33.809> because

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
very light hand when doing this because

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.440 
very light hand when doing this because
I<00:00:34.320> don't<00:00:34.380> want<00:00:34.770> them<00:00:34.950> to<00:00:35.190> be<00:00:35.370> very<00:00:35.399> precise<00:00:36.239> and

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
I don't want them to be very precise and

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.770 
I don't want them to be very precise and
very<00:00:37.079> out<00:00:37.350> drone<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:37.920> I<00:00:38.340> want<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.850> a<00:00:39.120> very<00:00:39.450> high

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
very out drone and I want to a very high

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.709 
very out drone and I want to a very high
a<00:00:40.020> very<00:00:40.350> pointy<00:00:40.890> art<00:00:41.190> because<00:00:41.820> that<00:00:42.510> just

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
a very pointy art because that just

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.750 
a very pointy art because that just
doesn't<00:00:42.899> look<00:00:43.170> good<00:00:43.379> in<00:00:43.559> my<00:00:43.680> opinion

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.319 

and<00:00:47.199> then<00:00:48.199> I<00:00:48.410> will<00:00:48.589> brush<00:00:48.890> my<00:00:49.160> hair<00:00:49.280> up<00:00:49.730> with<00:00:50.300> a

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:50.329 
and then I will brush my hair up with a

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:54.669 
and then I will brush my hair up with a
spoolie<00:00:50.690> for<00:00:51.050> that<00:00:51.199> natural<00:00:51.379> effect<00:00:52.129> and<00:00:53.679> I

00:00:54.669 --> 00:00:54.679 
spoolie for that natural effect and I

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:56.649 
spoolie for that natural effect and I
will<00:00:54.859> fix<00:00:55.039> my<00:00:55.219> eyebrow<00:00:55.699> with<00:00:55.909> the<00:00:56.059> clear<00:00:56.269> gel

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:56.659 
will fix my eyebrow with the clear gel

00:00:56.659 --> 00:01:00.950 
will fix my eyebrow with the clear gel
mascara

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.600 

and<00:01:01.050> now<00:01:01.410> you<00:01:01.469> can<00:01:01.739> see<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.040> things<00:01:02.340> that<00:01:02.579> I

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:02.610 
and now you can see the things that I

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.789 
and now you can see the things that I
wouldn't<00:01:03.030> recommend<00:01:03.329> so<00:01:03.870> my<00:01:04.019> eyebrows<00:01:04.530> are

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
wouldn't recommend so my eyebrows are

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.700 
wouldn't recommend so my eyebrows are
very<00:01:05.400> precise<00:01:05.909> very<00:01:06.150> exact<00:01:06.810> very<00:01:07.080> out<00:01:07.320> drawn

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
very precise very exact very out drawn

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.000 
very precise very exact very out drawn
and<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.400> arch<00:01:08.580> is<00:01:08.970> too<00:01:09.000> high<00:01:09.540> too<00:01:10.200> pointy<00:01:10.710> so

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
and the arch is too high too pointy so

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:26.359 
and the arch is too high too pointy so
they<00:01:11.490> are<00:01:11.610> just<00:01:11.790> looking<00:01:12.060> fake<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:25.009> now<00:01:26.009> on<00:01:26.220> to

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
they are just looking fake and now on to

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.790 
they are just looking fake and now on to
the<00:01:26.399> eyes<00:01:26.640> I<00:01:26.970> will<00:01:27.270> do<00:01:27.479> a<00:01:27.509> quick<00:01:27.899> easy<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:28.619> not

too<00:01:29.070> dramatic<00:01:29.610> smokey<00:01:30.090> eyes<00:01:30.240> because<00:01:30.960> the

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.080 
too dramatic smokey eyes because the

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.200 
too dramatic smokey eyes because the
smokiness<00:01:31.470> of<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.800> shadows<00:01:32.369> will<00:01:32.850> always

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
smokiness of the shadows will always

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.150 
smokiness of the shadows will always
open<00:01:33.630> up<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.990> whole<00:01:34.200> look<00:01:34.470> will<00:01:34.740> make<00:01:34.770> your

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
going for the only thing that really

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.960 
going for the only thing that really
matters<00:03:09.480> is<00:03:09.720> you<00:03:10.290> know<00:03:10.440> the<00:03:10.620> line<00:03:10.829> should<00:03:11.130> be<00:03:11.190> a

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
matters is you know the line should be a

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.850 
matters is you know the line should be a
newest<00:03:12.300> line<00:03:12.570> so<00:03:12.930> that's<00:03:13.170> the<00:03:13.410> only<00:03:13.650> thing

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
newest line so that's the only thing

newest line so that's the only thing
that<00:03:14.040> you<00:03:14.160> have<00:03:14.190> to<00:03:14.400> take<00:03:14.790> care<00:03:15.060> of<00:03:15.090> so<00:03:15.930> the

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
that you have to take care of so the

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.990 
that you have to take care of so the
line<00:03:16.350> shouldn't<00:03:16.890> be<00:03:16.980> broken<00:03:17.250> in<00:03:17.670> the<00:03:17.790> outer

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000
