00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:08.920
 we have allocated one billion euros and it is true that there are 300 million 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.549
 in less respect 

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:15.849
 to the previous situation but we have also eliminated many mirrors 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:16.700
 many 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.140
 useless degree courses many lessons 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:25.300
 which represented duplication of many specialized schools c 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.340
 there were 1600 of them, today there are 1200, which is the truth is that in the dispute 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.440
 the university's educational offer 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.880
 meanwhile in the best of the most financing and the most attention 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.560
 by politicians 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.890
 and when I have to cut a thing to the shark cuts from the university years 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.270
 15 years a very short-sighted vision because without culture you don't go anywhere 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:54.320
 if this country has few resources for scholarships for the loan of honor 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.170
 for university residences 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.860
 depends on the fact that larry university was not hahaha 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.690
 is calibrated on needs and needs 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.740
 students need but on those of professors and innovation 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.810
 innovation is achieved through research and research, the fruit of research 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.150
 applied that the result of pure research 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.750
 therefore they are great ignorants amber to realize dress 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.250
 so more attention should be paid to the students 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:31.060
 that is, today under water you left yourself one of the biggest breakdowns for you 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:32.730
 of walnut university 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:39.300
 40% are lost on the street and therefore ideas I believe our first task is in 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.700
 a moment of economic crisis not only cap 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.380
 that of stopping investment but also of avoiding waste is always done 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.160
 case of germany i remind you that germany 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:55.310
 about 20 lcn 20 million more inhabitants than Italy but 150 thousand teachers - 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:02.220
 that is, in Italy we have 750,000 in Germany there are 600,000 so it's true 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.280
 Germany invested more but probably if we go to see the 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.850
 rules are very different from the Italian ones to evade the boys that i 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.750
 bastions invest more resources to solve problems in my opinion 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.799
 deeply wrong scene lack of silver russel brand new away 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:22.119
 indoor realize the importance of research 

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:28.430
 and then another mirabello blow that one would like to give to the university with this one 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.569
 gelmini law 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:35.299
 the detracts that the researchers indefinite contract because 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:38.879
 this search will love me ancona seeks tranquility of mind 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:41.029
 not knowing if next year 

00:02:41.029 --> 00:02:46.269
 then a contract - it comes from an anxiety because a person cannot certainly 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:48.879
 dedicate all his time to Alice 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:52.399
 walnut researchers are the worst paid in europe 

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:54.550
 at least we leave the contract 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.090
 indefinitely
