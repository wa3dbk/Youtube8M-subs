00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
in this video I show you how to connect

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.050 
in this video I show you how to connect
your<00:00:03.300> turntables<00:00:04.080> to<00:00:04.140> your<00:00:04.350> iPad<00:00:04.819> here's<00:00:05.819> my

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
your turntables to your iPad here's my

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.080 
your turntables to your iPad here's my
good<00:00:06.270> old<00:00:06.450> turntable<00:00:06.660> from<00:00:07.140> the<00:00:07.259> 1970s<00:00:08.160> which

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
good old turntable from the 1970s which

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.680 
good old turntable from the 1970s which
has<00:00:09.360> phonon<00:00:09.840> outputs<00:00:10.559> here<00:00:11.480> the<00:00:12.480> photo

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
has phonon outputs here the photo

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.049 
has phonon outputs here the photo
outputs<00:00:13.230> are<00:00:13.440> connected<00:00:13.469> to<00:00:14.219> USB<00:00:14.580> sound<00:00:14.969> card

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
outputs are connected to USB sound card

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.380 
outputs are connected to USB sound card
with<00:00:15.630> follow<00:00:15.870> inputs<00:00:16.379> of<00:00:17.180> course<00:00:18.180> there<00:00:18.359> are

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
with follow inputs of course there are

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.080 
with follow inputs of course there are
some<00:00:18.720> turntables<00:00:19.320> with<00:00:19.380> line<00:00:19.650> outputs<00:00:20.220> the

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
some turntables with line outputs the

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.640 
some turntables with line outputs the
case<00:00:21.330> is<00:00:21.539> a<00:00:21.570> little<00:00:21.779> bit<00:00:21.900> more<00:00:22.050> easy<00:00:22.289> with<00:00:22.500> them

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
case is a little bit more easy with them

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.200 
case is a little bit more easy with them
so<00:00:23.490> this<00:00:24.150> USB<00:00:24.570> sound<00:00:24.990> card<00:00:25.080> is<00:00:25.760> connected<00:00:26.760> to<00:00:26.789> a

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
so this USB sound card is connected to a

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.240 
so this USB sound card is connected to a
provid<00:00:27.810> USB<00:00:28.260> hub<00:00:29.570> a<00:00:30.570> powered<00:00:31.320> USB<00:00:31.529> hub<00:00:31.740> is<00:00:32.040> not

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
provid USB hub a powered USB hub is not

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.060 
provid USB hub a powered USB hub is not
always<00:00:32.700> necessary<00:00:33.210> but<00:00:33.480> this<00:00:34.469> sound<00:00:34.739> card

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
always necessary but this sound card

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.150 
always necessary but this sound card
draws<00:00:35.640> too<00:00:35.969> much<00:00:36.000> power<00:00:36.510> from<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.440> USB<00:00:37.770> line

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
draws too much power from the USB line

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.450 
draws too much power from the USB line
and<00:00:38.629> can't<00:00:39.629> be<00:00:39.899> used<00:00:40.140> with<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.530> iPad<00:00:40.890> directly

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
and can't be used with the iPad directly

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.200 
and can't be used with the iPad directly
so<00:00:41.850> I<00:00:41.879> had<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.570> use<00:00:42.780> this<00:00:42.989> powered<00:00:43.410> USB<00:00:43.620> hub<00:00:44.210> the

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
so I had to use this powered USB hub the

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.139 
so I had to use this powered USB hub the
hub<00:00:45.239> is<00:00:45.629> connected<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.500> Apple's<00:00:47.460> camera

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
hub is connected to Apple's camera

shift<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.360> lock<00:01:30.540> into<00:01:30.900> this<00:01:30.990> position<00:01:31.500> and

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:31.939 
shift to lock into this position and

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:36.710 
shift to lock into this position and
then<00:01:32.939> turn<00:01:33.750> it<00:01:33.900> on<00:01:34.049> and<00:01:35.060> here<00:01:36.060> you<00:01:36.240> can<00:01:36.450> see<00:01:36.689> a

then turn it on and here you can see a

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.039 
then turn it on and here you can see a
small<00:01:37.049> vu<00:01:37.500> meter<00:01:37.820> for<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.939> USB<00:01:39.210> input<00:01:40.220> showing

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049 
small vu meter for the USB input showing

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:46.010 
small vu meter for the USB input showing
what<00:01:43.049> is<00:01:43.200> coming<00:01:43.530> in<00:01:43.799> from<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.340> turntable<00:01:45.020> so

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
what is coming in from the turntable so

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.410 
what is coming in from the turntable so
now<00:01:46.229> this<00:01:46.890> turntable<00:01:47.220> is<00:01:47.579> connected<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.090> USB

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
now this turntable is connected to USB

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.819 
now this turntable is connected to USB
input<00:01:48.780> 3<00:01:48.990> &amp;<00:01:49.140> 4<00:01:49.350> let's<00:01:49.860> switch<00:01:50.070> to<00:01:50.100> that<00:01:50.689> and

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:51.829 
input 3 &amp; 4 let's switch to that and

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:57.470 
input 3 &amp; 4 let's switch to that and
then

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:57.480 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.380 

it<00:01:58.020> works
