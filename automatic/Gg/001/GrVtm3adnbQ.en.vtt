00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
first let's talk about the equipment

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.459 
first let's talk about the equipment
you'll<00:00:11.969> need<00:00:12.000> to<00:00:12.389> make<00:00:12.540> this<00:00:12.690> process<00:00:12.990> as

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
you'll need to make this process as

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.430 
you'll need to make this process as
smooth<00:00:13.740> as<00:00:13.860> possible<00:00:14.570> for<00:00:15.570> recording<00:00:16.170> we

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
smooth as possible for recording we

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.429 
smooth as possible for recording we
recommend<00:00:16.920> using<00:00:17.100> a<00:00:17.400> hard<00:00:17.670> drive<00:00:17.880> camera<00:00:18.439> this

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
recommend using a hard drive camera this

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.439 
recommend using a hard drive camera this
means<00:00:19.740> using<00:00:20.160> a<00:00:20.340> camera<00:00:20.760> where<00:00:21.000> you're<00:00:21.150> able

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
means using a camera where you're able

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.290 
means using a camera where you're able
to<00:00:21.480> save<00:00:21.900> video<00:00:22.260> to<00:00:22.590> an<00:00:22.710> SD<00:00:22.980> card<00:00:23.430> or<00:00:23.640> the

to save video to an SD card or the

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
internal drive of the device the reason

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.630 
internal drive of the device the reason
we<00:00:27.300> suggest<00:00:27.510> hard<00:00:28.109> drive<00:00:28.320> cameras<00:00:28.859> is<00:00:29.310> because

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
we suggest hard drive cameras is because

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.400 
we suggest hard drive cameras is because
they<00:00:29.789> are<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.000> fastest<00:00:30.599> way<00:00:30.779> to<00:00:30.810> get<00:00:31.170> your
