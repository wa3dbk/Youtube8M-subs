00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.070 

I<00:00:01.280> guess<00:00:02.280> this<00:00:02.580> edge<00:00:02.879> afternoon<00:00:03.480> and<00:00:03.689> today

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
I guess this edge afternoon and today

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.660 
I guess this edge afternoon and today
I'm<00:00:04.170> gonna<00:00:04.319> show<00:00:04.560> you<00:00:04.620> how<00:00:04.770> to<00:00:04.830> make<00:00:05.040> fire<00:00:05.430> and

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
I'm gonna show you how to make fire and

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.900 
I'm gonna show you how to make fire and
smoke<00:00:05.970> in<00:00:06.240> cinema<00:00:06.569> 4d<00:00:07.400> so<00:00:08.400> we're<00:00:08.519> gonna<00:00:08.639> start

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
smoke in cinema 4d so we're gonna start

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.820 
smoke in cinema 4d so we're gonna start
off<00:00:08.970> by<00:00:09.030> making<00:00:09.240> an<00:00:09.870> environment<00:00:10.800> and<00:00:12.830> an

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
off by making an environment and an

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.950 
off by making an environment and an
emitter<00:00:14.160> and<00:00:15.030> then<00:00:15.210> take<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:15.570> rotate<00:00:15.929> tool

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
emitter and then take the rotate tool

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.790 
emitter and then take the rotate tool
and<00:00:16.789> rotate<00:00:17.789> it<00:00:19.640> 90<00:00:20.640> degrees<00:00:21.140> but<00:00:22.140> and<00:00:22.380> by

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
and rotate it 90 degrees but and by

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.040 
and rotate it 90 degrees but and by
holding<00:00:22.980> shift<00:00:23.130> is<00:00:23.699> kind<00:00:23.910> of<00:00:24.000> snap<00:00:24.300> every<00:00:24.779> 5

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
holding shift is kind of snap every 5

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.990 
holding shift is kind of snap every 5
degrees<00:00:25.410> so<00:00:25.619> you<00:00:25.710> can<00:00:25.859> rotate<00:00:26.070> it<00:00:26.279> on<00:00:26.519> more

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
degrees so you can rotate it on more

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.460 
degrees so you can rotate it on more
precise<00:00:29.150> and<00:00:30.150> I'm<00:00:30.300> gonna<00:00:30.480> go<00:00:30.689> to<00:00:30.720> materials

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
precise and I'm gonna go to materials

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.030 
precise and I'm gonna go to materials
file<00:00:31.859> shader<00:00:32.870> pyro<00:00:33.870> constant<00:00:34.380> volume<00:00:34.620> tracer

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
file shader pyro constant volume tracer

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.869 
file shader pyro constant volume tracer
and<00:00:35.309> pull<00:00:36.120> that<00:00:36.239> to<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.450> environment<00:00:37.110> and

00:00:37.869 --> 00:00:37.879 
and pull that to the environment and

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:42.889 
and pull that to the environment and
then<00:00:38.879> file<00:00:39.329> shader<00:00:40.219> on<00:00:41.219> pyro<00:00:41.820> cluster<00:00:42.300> and

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
then file shader on pyro cluster and

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.369 
then file shader on pyro cluster and
then<00:00:43.350> just<00:00:43.590> hold<00:00:44.160> ctrl<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:45.059> click<00:00:45.110> and<00:00:46.110> drag

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
then just hold ctrl and click and drag

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.520 
then just hold ctrl and click and drag
it<00:00:46.590> so<00:00:47.340> we'll<00:00:47.550> get<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:47.910> then<00:00:48.840> double<00:00:49.200> click<00:00:49.289> one

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
it so we'll get to then double click one

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.189 
it so we'll get to then double click one
of<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.770> pipe<00:00:49.980> lustres<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:50.700> change<00:00:51.030> it<00:00:51.570> to

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
of the pipe lustres and change it to

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.670 
of the pipe lustres and change it to
fire<00:00:52.530> thank<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.670> kiss<00:00:54.079> you<00:00:55.079> know<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.469> other

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
control and hope you measure down so we

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.260 
control and hope you measure down so we
get<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:09.439> you<00:01:10.439> want<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.100> be<00:01:11.189> measures<00:01:11.580> to

and<00:01:16.600> now<00:01:17.320> we<00:01:18.510> take<00:01:19.510> the<00:01:19.780> fire<00:01:20.130> pull<00:01:21.130> it<00:01:21.250> to<00:01:21.400> the

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
and now we take the fire pull it to the

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.520 
and now we take the fire pull it to the
to<00:01:22.060> one<00:01:22.210> of<00:01:22.330> the<00:01:22.420> emitters<00:01:22.780> and<00:01:22.930> take<00:01:23.170> it<00:01:23.260> smoke

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
to one of the emitters and take it smoke

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.680 
to one of the emitters and take it smoke
and<00:01:23.740> pull<00:01:23.950> it<00:01:24.040> to<00:01:24.160> the<00:01:24.190> other<00:01:24.400> one<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:25.540> then

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:25.690 
and pull it to the other one and then

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:33.170 
and pull it to the other one and then
just<00:01:25.930> play<00:01:26.410> it<00:01:26.620> to<00:01:27.160> the<00:01:27.280> round<00:01:27.490> frame<00:01:28.470> party

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:49.200 

and<00:01:34.180> then<00:01:34.630> just<00:01:35.140> render<00:01:35.530> it

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.410 

and<00:01:49.780> as<00:01:49.900> you<00:01:49.990> can<00:01:50.140> see<00:01:50.320> it<00:01:50.470> looks<00:01:50.620> pretty<00:01:50.800> real

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
and as you can see it looks pretty real

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.720 
and as you can see it looks pretty real
but<00:01:52.420> you<00:01:52.660> can<00:01:52.870> see<00:01:53.110> the<00:01:53.320> smoke<00:01:53.830> there<00:01:54.130> well<00:01:54.310> so

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:54.730 
but you can see the smoke there well so

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:58.400 
but you can see the smoke there well so
I'm<00:01:55.150> just<00:01:55.210> gonna<00:01:55.540> create<00:01:55.900> a<00:01:55.960> floor<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:57.520> white

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:58.410 
I'm just gonna create a floor the white

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:17.500 
I'm just gonna create a floor the white
material

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.790 

so<00:02:18.110> here<00:02:18.290> you<00:02:18.379> can<00:02:18.440> see<00:02:18.760> that<00:02:19.760> looks<00:02:20.800> real

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
so here you can see that looks real

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.290 
so here you can see that looks real
pretty<00:02:22.670> real

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
settings here like volcano cloud steam

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:38.320 
settings here like volcano cloud steam
fireball<00:02:34.670> and<00:02:35.560> user-defined<00:02:36.610> which<00:02:37.610> is<00:02:37.880> like
