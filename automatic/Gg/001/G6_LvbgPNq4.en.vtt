Harvick<00:01:07.680> called<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:08.340> karma<00:01:08.729> good<00:01:09.600> karma<00:01:09.900> and

after<00:01:11.010> losing<00:01:11.130> shell<00:01:11.580> after<00:01:12.299> three<00:01:12.659> years<00:01:12.900> I

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
after losing shell after three years I

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.710 
after losing shell after three years I
think<00:01:13.979> there<00:01:14.189> was<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.340> bit<00:01:14.520> of<00:01:14.640> satisfaction<00:01:15.479> in

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
think there was a bit of satisfaction in

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.359 
think there was a bit of satisfaction in
winning<00:01:17.420> rather<00:01:18.420> action-packed<00:01:19.170> race<00:01:19.470> we're

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
winning rather action-packed race we're

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.160 
winning rather action-packed race we're
the<00:01:20.520> action-packed<00:01:20.880> sort<00:01:21.570> of<00:01:21.659> surprisingly

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
the action-packed sort of surprisingly

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.810 
the action-packed sort of surprisingly
so<00:01:23.479> look<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.600> me<00:01:24.750> like<00:01:25.250> there<00:01:26.250> were<00:01:26.340> two<00:01:26.520> groups

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
so look to me like there were two groups

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.880

don't<00:02:02.579> think<00:02:02.729> they're<00:02:02.880> playing<00:02:03.450> around<00:02:03.689> right

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
don't think they're playing around right

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.910 
don't think they're playing around right
now<00:02:04.100> so<00:02:05.100> it's<00:02:05.250> kevin<00:02:05.520> harvick<00:02:05.850> winning

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920
