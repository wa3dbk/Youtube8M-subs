Michael if you find yourself just

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.270 
Michael if you find yourself just
getting<00:00:09.719> over<00:00:09.990> an<00:00:10.080> illness<00:00:10.290> perhaps<00:00:10.889> and<00:00:11.130> you

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
getting over an illness perhaps and you

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.490 
getting over an illness perhaps and you
you<00:00:11.730> maybe<00:00:12.090> have<00:00:12.420> a<00:00:12.450> feeling<00:00:12.929> that<00:00:13.080> it's

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
you maybe have a feeling that it's

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.470 
you maybe have a feeling that it's
taking<00:00:13.830> a<00:00:13.860> little<00:00:13.950> bit<00:00:14.130> longer<00:00:14.299> than<00:00:15.299> it

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
taking a little bit longer than it

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.910 
taking a little bit longer than it
should<00:00:15.509> and<00:00:15.960> you<00:00:16.080> you<00:00:16.379> think<00:00:16.619> that<00:00:16.650> perhaps

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
should and you you think that perhaps

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.010 
should and you you think that perhaps
you<00:00:17.220> need<00:00:17.430> to<00:00:17.640> do<00:00:18.150> something<00:00:18.510> to<00:00:18.630> restore

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
you need to do something to restore

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.840 
you need to do something to restore
friendly<00:00:19.800> bacteria<00:00:20.310> in<00:00:20.400> your<00:00:20.490> system<00:00:20.760> how

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
friendly bacteria in your system how

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.880 
friendly bacteria in your system how
would<00:00:20.910> you<00:00:21.060> go<00:00:21.150> about<00:00:21.210> doing<00:00:21.330> that<00:00:21.600> well<00:00:22.560> there

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
would you go about doing that well there

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:23.960 
would you go about doing that well there
are<00:00:22.980> a<00:00:23.010> number<00:00:23.189> of<00:00:23.310> ways<00:00:23.490> you<00:00:23.640> could<00:00:23.789> do<00:00:23.939> that

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
are a number of ways you could do that

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.170 
are a number of ways you could do that
you<00:00:24.390> could<00:00:24.949> start<00:00:25.949> taking<00:00:26.160> food<00:00:26.670> products

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
you could start taking food products

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.640 
you could start taking food products
eating<00:00:27.449> foods<00:00:27.689> that<00:00:27.810> have<00:00:28.019> probiotic

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
eating foods that have probiotic

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.769 
eating foods that have probiotic
bacteria<00:00:28.680> like<00:00:29.340> yogurts<00:00:29.789> or<00:00:30.060> things<00:00:30.599> like

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
bacteria like yogurts or things like

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.770 
bacteria like yogurts or things like
that<00:00:31.019> but<00:00:31.710> you<00:00:32.399> know<00:00:32.940> sometimes<00:00:33.420> those<00:00:33.570> are<00:00:33.719> in

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
that but you know sometimes those are in

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.990 
that but you know sometimes those are in
lower<00:00:33.960> concentrations<00:00:34.829> it's<00:00:35.130> hard<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.520> get<00:00:35.730> an

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
lower concentrations it's hard to get an

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.459 
lower concentrations it's hard to get an
extra<00:00:36.450> number<00:00:36.630> of<00:00:36.840> bacteria<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.440> bacteria

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
extra number of bacteria the bacteria

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.709 
extra number of bacteria the bacteria
needed<00:00:38.190> to<00:00:38.309> actually<00:00:38.640> replenish<00:00:39.000> the

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
needed to actually replenish the

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.930 
needed to actually replenish the
bacteria<00:00:40.260> that<00:00:40.410> might<00:00:40.620> have<00:00:40.800> been<00:00:41.460> killed<00:00:41.730> off

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
bacteria that might have been killed off

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.180 
bacteria that might have been killed off
in<00:00:41.969> your<00:00:42.239> body<00:00:42.450> due<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.590> illness<00:00:44.010> or<00:00:44.129> whatever

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
in your body due to illness or whatever

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.260 
in your body due to illness or whatever
reason<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:44.910> so<00:00:45.539> a<00:00:45.570> probiotic<00:00:46.079> supplement<00:00:46.320> is

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.270 
reason and so a probiotic supplement is

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.279 
reason and so a probiotic supplement is
that's<00:00:48.270> a<00:00:48.360> good<00:00:48.480> time<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.750> take<00:00:48.870> a<00:00:48.930> probiotic

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
that's a good time to take a probiotic

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.549 
that's a good time to take a probiotic
supplement<00:00:49.530> you<00:00:50.520> mentioned<00:00:50.879> earlier<00:00:51.210> that

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 
supplement you mentioned earlier that

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:59.029 
supplement you mentioned earlier that
the<00:00:52.559> amount<00:00:53.250> of<00:00:55.039> active<00:00:57.590> bacteria<00:00:58.590> that<00:00:58.859> you

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
the amount of active bacteria that you

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.160 
the amount of active bacteria that you
get<00:00:59.340> in<00:00:59.670> a<00:00:59.789> probiotic<00:01:00.390> is<00:01:00.510> important<00:01:00.989> that

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
get in a probiotic is important that

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.020 
get in a probiotic is important that
right<00:01:01.710> there<00:01:02.070> are<00:01:02.129> products<00:01:02.460> on<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.699> market

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
right there are products on the market

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.119 
right there are products on the market
that<00:01:03.180> claimed<00:01:03.899> that<00:01:04.199> that<00:01:04.409> will<00:01:04.890> tell<00:01:05.040> you

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
that claimed that that will tell you

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.830 
that claimed that that will tell you
that<00:01:05.280> they<00:01:05.369> have<00:01:05.519> millions<00:01:06.210> of<00:01:06.600> bacteria

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
and working on speaking of food to help

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.560 
and working on speaking of food to help
it<00:01:58.950> grow<00:01:59.159> on<00:01:59.340> are<00:01:59.549> there<00:01:59.670> other<00:01:59.850> things<00:01:59.939> that

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
it grow on are there other things that

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.630 
it grow on are there other things that
you<00:02:00.689> might<00:02:00.810> look<00:02:01.049> for<00:02:01.110> in<00:02:01.380> a<00:02:01.710> probiotic<00:02:02.100> that

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
you might look for in a probiotic that

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.060 
you might look for in a probiotic that
would<00:02:02.820> be<00:02:03.750> in<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.140> probiotic<00:02:04.680> there<00:02:04.890> are

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
would be in the probiotic there are

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.600 
would be in the probiotic there are
substances<00:02:05.790> of<00:02:06.270> now<00:02:07.429> discovered<00:02:08.429> and

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
substances of now discovered and

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.479 
substances of now discovered and
available<00:02:09.030> called<00:02:09.209> prebiotics<00:02:09.959> and

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.489 
available called prebiotics and

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:12.860 
available called prebiotics and
prebiotics<00:02:11.489> are<00:02:11.580> not<00:02:11.760> live<00:02:12.000> bacteria<00:02:12.690> and

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
prebiotics are not live bacteria and

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.410 
prebiotics are not live bacteria and
probiotics<00:02:13.860> you<00:02:14.069> know<00:02:14.310> as<00:02:14.580> we<00:02:14.700> say<00:02:14.849> probiotics

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
probiotics you know as we say probiotics

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.589 
probiotics you know as we say probiotics
as<00:02:15.540> we<00:02:15.659> know<00:02:15.780> probiotics<00:02:16.349> are<00:02:16.470> live<00:02:16.680> bacteria

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599 
as we know probiotics are live bacteria

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:21.350 
as we know probiotics are live bacteria
prebiotics<00:02:18.599> are<00:02:18.720> substances<00:02:19.409> that<00:02:19.640> I<00:02:20.640> think

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
prebiotics are substances that I think

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.789 
prebiotics are substances that I think
the<00:02:21.420> best<00:02:21.569> way<00:02:21.690> to<00:02:21.720> think<00:02:21.840> of<00:02:22.019> prebiotics<00:02:22.650> is

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:22.799 
the best way to think of prebiotics is

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:25.309 
the best way to think of prebiotics is
like<00:02:23.489> fertilizer<00:02:24.030> you<00:02:24.569> know<00:02:24.690> you<00:02:25.140> put

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
like fertilizer you know you put

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:29.080 
like fertilizer you know you put
fertilizer<00:02:26.090> available<00:02:27.090> for<00:02:27.659> the<00:02:27.840> plants<00:02:28.260> or

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
fertilizer available for the plants or

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.339 
fertilizer available for the plants or
organisms<00:02:30.090> to<00:02:30.209> grow<00:02:30.420> on<00:02:30.599> and<00:02:30.840> that's<00:02:31.170> what

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
organisms to grow on and that's what

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:33.199 
organisms to grow on and that's what
prebiotics<00:02:31.980> do<00:02:32.129> they<00:02:32.280> act<00:02:32.430> as<00:02:32.610> a<00:02:32.640> fertilizer

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
prebiotics do they act as a fertilizer

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.569 
prebiotics do they act as a fertilizer
for<00:02:33.569> the<00:02:33.629> the<00:02:34.500> good<00:02:34.650> bacteria<00:02:34.860> to<00:02:35.250> grow<00:02:35.489> on

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:35.579 
for the the good bacteria to grow on

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:39.830 
for the the good bacteria to grow on
their<00:02:36.060> their<00:02:38.060> carbohydrates<00:02:39.060> that<00:02:39.569> aren't

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
their their carbohydrates that aren't

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.960 
their their carbohydrates that aren't
really<00:02:39.959> digested<00:02:40.560> by<00:02:40.650> the<00:02:40.709> human<00:02:41.069> being<00:02:41.310> but

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
really digested by the human being but

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.819 
really digested by the human being but
they're<00:02:42.150> digested<00:02:42.659> by<00:02:42.780> those<00:02:42.959> bacteria<00:02:43.530> so

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:43.829 
they're digested by those bacteria so

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:45.979 
they're digested by those bacteria so
the<00:02:43.920> bacteria<00:02:44.069> like<00:02:44.519> them<00:02:44.760> they<00:02:45.209> grow<00:02:45.450> faster

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
the bacteria like them they grow faster

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:50.089 
the bacteria like them they grow faster
they<00:02:46.950> proliferate<00:02:47.549> more<00:02:47.790> and<00:02:48.379> it<00:02:49.379> helps<00:02:49.680> build

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099 
they proliferate more and it helps build

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:51.380 
they proliferate more and it helps build
up<00:02:50.220> those<00:02:50.370> bacteria<00:02:50.849> in<00:02:50.910> the<00:02:51.090> body

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
up those bacteria in the body

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.830 
up those bacteria in the body
so<00:02:52.379> things<00:02:52.620> that<00:02:52.709> like<00:02:53.549> fos<00:02:54.150> might<00:02:54.510> be<00:02:54.690> that's

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
so things that like fos might be that's

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.170 
so things that like fos might be that's
right<00:02:54.989> or<00:02:55.260> inulin<00:02:55.590> inulin<00:02:56.129> fos<00:02:56.819> there<00:02:57.090> are<00:02:57.150> a

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
right or inulin inulin fos there are a

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.869 
right or inulin inulin fos there are a
number<00:02:57.209> of<00:02:57.420> different<00:02:57.750> kinds<00:02:58.079> of<00:02:58.879> prebiotics

00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879 
number of different kinds of prebiotics

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:02.089 
number of different kinds of prebiotics
available<00:03:00.329> today<00:03:00.620> and<00:03:01.620> you<00:03:01.709> would<00:03:01.859> suggest

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:02.099 
available today and you would suggest

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:04.520 
available today and you would suggest
that<00:03:02.400> that<00:03:02.489> is<00:03:02.909> a<00:03:02.970> good<00:03:03.269> thing<00:03:03.450> to<00:03:03.720> look<00:03:04.109> for<00:03:04.409> is

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
that that is a good thing to look for is

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:05.890 
that that is a good thing to look for is
an<00:03:04.709> additional<00:03:05.129> thing<00:03:05.190> to<00:03:05.430> help<00:03:05.609> that

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
an additional thing to help that

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.849 
an additional thing to help that
bacteria<00:03:06.900> yes<00:03:07.109> that's<00:03:07.319> certainly<00:03:07.470> something

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:07.859 
bacteria yes that's certainly something

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:09.399 
bacteria yes that's certainly something
that<00:03:07.980> can<00:03:08.280> help<00:03:08.459> the<00:03:08.640> bacteria<00:03:09.120> grow

00:03:09.399 --> 00:03:09.409 
that can help the bacteria grow

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:12.860 
that can help the bacteria grow
prebiotics<00:03:10.409> and<00:03:10.560> probiotics<00:03:10.790> are<00:03:11.790> as<00:03:12.540> I<00:03:12.659> said

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
prebiotics and probiotics are as I said

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.319 
prebiotics and probiotics are as I said
like<00:03:13.019> a<00:03:13.049> fertilizer<00:03:13.769> effect<00:03:14.190> but<00:03:14.819> every

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329 
like a fertilizer effect but every

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:18.140 
like a fertilizer effect but every
probiotic<00:03:16.230> doesn't<00:03:17.010> grow<00:03:17.310> with<00:03:17.819> the<00:03:17.940> same

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
probiotic doesn't grow with the same

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.050 
probiotic doesn't grow with the same
prebiotic<00:03:18.870> so<00:03:19.260> it<00:03:19.650> is<00:03:19.889> important<00:03:20.370> to<00:03:20.400> get<00:03:21.000> a

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
prebiotic so it is important to get a

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.789 
prebiotic so it is important to get a
good<00:03:21.239> quality<00:03:21.419> prebiotic<00:03:22.380> so<00:03:22.530> that<00:03:22.680> the

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
good quality prebiotic so that the

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:25.039 
good quality prebiotic so that the
probiotics<00:03:23.310> will<00:03:23.430> actually<00:03:23.730> utilize<00:03:24.150> that

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
probiotics will actually utilize that

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:27.740 
probiotics will actually utilize that
that<00:03:25.380> source<00:03:25.980> of<00:03:26.160> fertilizer<00:03:26.940> if<00:03:27.450> you<00:03:27.569> will

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
that source of fertilizer if you will

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.440 
that source of fertilizer if you will
now<00:03:28.739> another<00:03:28.980> question<00:03:29.250> I<00:03:29.549> guess<00:03:29.760> I<00:03:29.940> would

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
now another question I guess I would

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.420 
now another question I guess I would
have<00:03:30.480> as<00:03:30.810> far<00:03:31.049> as<00:03:31.319> if<00:03:31.680> you're<00:03:31.889> taking<00:03:32.280> now<00:03:32.400> a

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
have as far as if you're taking now a

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.449 
have as far as if you're taking now a
program<00:03:32.730> of<00:03:33.500> probiotics<00:03:34.500> you're<00:03:35.010> taking<00:03:35.310> them

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
program of probiotics you're taking them

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:37.159 
program of probiotics you're taking them
through<00:03:35.489> as<00:03:35.849> say<00:03:36.269> a<00:03:36.299> supplement<00:03:36.810> yes

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:37.169 
through as say a supplement yes

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:39.470 
through as say a supplement yes
or<00:03:37.319> maybe<00:03:37.620> something<00:03:38.069> like<00:03:38.190> your<00:03:38.370> over<00:03:38.430> how<00:03:39.419> do

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
or maybe something like your over how do

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.030 
or maybe something like your over how do
we<00:03:39.720> know<00:03:39.870> that<00:03:40.790> taking<00:03:41.790> them<00:03:42.090> is<00:03:42.329> actually

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
we know that taking them is actually

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.409 
we know that taking them is actually
being<00:03:44.040> beneficial<00:03:44.579> that<00:03:44.849> they're<00:03:44.970> actually

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:45.419 
being beneficial that they're actually

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:49.220 
being beneficial that they're actually
be<00:03:45.660> helping<00:03:46.199> to<00:03:46.440> propagate<00:03:47.220> the<00:03:47.930> GI<00:03:48.930> tract

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
be helping to propagate the GI tract

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:50.750 
be helping to propagate the GI tract
that's<00:03:49.530> no<00:03:49.739> that's<00:03:49.889> a<00:03:50.040> difficult<00:03:50.519> thing<00:03:50.579> to

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
that's no that's a difficult thing to

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.939 
that's no that's a difficult thing to
prove<00:03:51.090> actually<00:03:51.660> but<00:03:52.199> it<00:03:52.319> is<00:03:52.440> possible<00:03:52.919> to

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:52.949 
prove actually but it is possible to

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:55.460 
prove actually but it is possible to
test<00:03:53.280> a<00:03:53.819> fecal<00:03:54.389> matter<00:03:54.569> to<00:03:54.900> know<00:03:55.079> that<00:03:55.349> the

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
test a fecal matter to know that the

temporarily they stay in the intestines
for<00:04:03.449> a<00:04:03.510> while<00:04:03.660> but<00:04:04.079> eventually<00:04:04.410> they're<00:04:04.739> going

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:04.889 
for a while but eventually they're going

awhile<00:04:08.970> to<00:04:09.269> see<00:04:09.449> if<00:04:09.690> the<00:04:09.840> probiotics<00:04:10.440> are

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
awhile to see if the probiotics are

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.470 
awhile to see if the probiotics are
still<00:04:10.829> there<00:04:11.370> for<00:04:11.609> a<00:04:11.639> while<00:04:11.849> and<00:04:12.120> then<00:04:12.269> they'll

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
still there for a while and then they'll

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.219 
still there for a while and then they'll
be<00:04:12.750> gone<00:04:13.760> but<00:04:14.760> the<00:04:14.970> good<00:04:15.389> quality<00:04:16.019> probiotic

and important and useful probiotic will
actually<00:04:19.049> stay<00:04:19.289> in<00:04:19.320> the<00:04:19.560> gut<00:04:19.769> and<00:04:20.549> implant<00:04:21.060> at

actually stay in the gut and implant at

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.040 
actually stay in the gut and implant at

00:04:25.589 --> 00:04:25.599 
for a number of weeks so it's

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:27.659 
for a number of weeks so it's
