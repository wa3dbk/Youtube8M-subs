00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.320
 and good to all and welcome to the 

00:00:06.519 --> 00:00:10.269
 fourth race of this season of 2015 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.099
 of formula-1 and about the grand prize of 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:13.930
 bahrain a career in which hamilton 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:15.699
 has returned to take the victory are already 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:17.260
 three of four races in which he has 

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:19.480
 won in this World Cup start 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.789
 formula 1 but today it has not been for a 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.539
 difference too bulky since 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:26.179
 ferrari 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:28.759
 has known how to sustain those 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:31.460
 differences and good at certain times 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:33.320
 as it was after the first pit stop of 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.140
 ross hamilton where he came to see 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.769
 overtaking vettel and they came out super 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:42.949
 all stuck but at that moment 

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:45.589
 hamilton put on a machete and extended another 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:48.170
 quickly the differences and then 

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:51.949
 the rest of the race so I think 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:55.729
 that 99% of the laps are passed and 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:01:00.409
 keeping tires and mechanics like that 

00:00:55.729 --> 00:01:02.390
 that yes well ferrari is close I think 

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:06.610
 that at the moment that you squeeze more 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:11.030
 the nuts could have pushed 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:12.530
 more since Robert today 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.740
 and has been at the end of the third 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:18.850
 position after putting on a tray a 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:22.009
 great king with in that second place 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.960
 Raikkonen has had a great race and 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:25.369
 has even been about to win if the 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.720
 race would have lasted one more lap 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:31.690
 possibly since mercedes 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.430
 has reported that its two pilots have 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.950
 had problems at the end of the race 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.870
 with braces gives and maybe also that 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:41.020
 final error that Rosberg has had 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:44.650
 He has left track and he has cost 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:47.320
 that second position and hamilton it has 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:50.620
 pretty soft braking on that last one 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:53.500
 return so that the same will not happen and 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:56.020
 not be overcome by raikkonen but let's go 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.470
 re condemned I made a great comeback 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:02.560
 since its last stop has cut 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:04.030
 like 20 seconds to rosberg and in the end he has 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.960
 finished in that second position 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:10.899
 after carrying 26 or 27 races without 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:15.940
 go up to the podium so kim and again 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:18.520
 this year your morals go up a bit and then 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.220
 of so many races because it's good that a 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.560
 pilot again step on the podium in 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.560
 third position has remained rosberg a 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.540
 rover that today has been during a 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:32.349
 part of the race 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:35.829
 little known as he has had guts and 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:37.780
 has advanced to vettel and raikkonen the 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:39.670
 record in which he had surpassed him after 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:43.090
 stay a little locked in the exit 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:47.829
 and in a few laps he surpassed both kimi 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:50.349
 as a sebastián and a vettel that today 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:53.079
 has been quite inaccurate in many 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:54.609
 moments of the race has had several 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:57.150
 runway exits 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:59.590
 already in the last part of the race even 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.659
 had to change the spoiler with what 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.870
 lost all probability of climbing the 

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:07.780
 podium and then later he could not overcome 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:12.069
 boots and it's almost worn today 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:15.010
 vettel has not been entirely fine and that 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:18.730
 has also done in part that I could 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:20.709
 go up to the podium and then in fourth 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.079
 position since you have determined boots that 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:25.389
 as I said he has put things 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:28.959
 difficult to vettel in that last stretch 

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:30.819
 of career and it has shown quite 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:33.010
 strong in that aspect 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:35.499
 and he has not let vettel surpass him 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.760
 so a good fourth web 

00:03:35.499 --> 00:03:39.999
 position for boots 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:42.310
 vettel as I said fifth in sixth 

00:03:39.999 --> 00:03:45.069
 richard position or red bull pretty 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:48.819
 Blurred is not in anyone's land 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:51.219
 practically not this year no no it's not your 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:52.590
 year and we'll see how long the 

00:03:51.219 --> 00:03:55.810
 redbook union with renault 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:04:00.370
 gross yang in seventh place eighth 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:02.290
 ninth pérez has been warm lukewarm that not 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.209
 I know what's wrong with him but this year he 's 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:08.079
 making many mistakes has many 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:12.879
 problems with your car and I see something 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:14.949
 nervous as the mistake he had yesterday of 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:16.959
 get stuck in the gravel to not 

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:19.750
 for not stopping the car and letting it roll 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:22.210
 strange and strange things that you 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:25.060
 they are happening but hey is not 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:27.699
 in a position to win redbull so 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:30.120
 little else could do and close the 

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:32.790
 points positions more 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:35.310
 and Alonso has been a tenth to four 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:37.979
 massa seconds so the lack of a 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:40.260
 little to enter for the first time 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:43.260
 So far the season mclaren 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:45.720
 and hopefully points already in the 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:48.830
 next big prize in Barcelona where 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.830
 also presumably 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:54.460
 a step in which hopefully 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.020
 step forward from now to enter and 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.480
 consecrated to a little what are the 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:01.270
 positions of points and little by little go 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:03.310
 opting to see if from here to the end of 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.230
 so they can even do 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:07.480
 a podium which is the minimum that 

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:09.010
 ask so nothing here ends the video 

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:11.580
 I hope you enjoyed a greeting and 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:11.580
 until next time 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.120
 okay
