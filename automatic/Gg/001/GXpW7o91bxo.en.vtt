00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
and pinching the top together gets me a

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:11.240 
and pinching the top together gets me a
grip<00:02:04.320> on<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.649> debris<00:02:05.040> as<00:02:05.250> I'm<00:02:05.790> removing<00:02:06.119> it

once the gutter is free of leaves I use

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:20.330 
once the gutter is free of leaves I use
a<00:02:14.380> garden<00:02:14.890> hose<00:02:15.100> to<00:02:15.430> flush<00:02:15.700> out<00:02:15.880> the<00:02:16.120> downspout

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
the bad news is I'm going to be putting

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.229 
the bad news is I'm going to be putting
a<00:02:44.739> whole<00:02:44.950> lot<00:02:45.130> of<00:02:45.160> water<00:02:45.400> right<00:02:45.700> up<00:02:45.760> here<00:02:46.000> next

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
a whole lot of water right up here next

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:48.000 
a whole lot of water right up here next
to<00:02:46.330> my<00:02:46.480> foundation<00:02:47.140> and<00:02:47.319> that's<00:02:47.440> never<00:02:47.770> a<00:02:47.920> good

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
to my foundation and that's never a good

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.550 
to my foundation and that's never a good
idea<00:02:48.340> so<00:02:49.120> what<00:02:49.300> I<00:02:49.330> want<00:02:49.569> to<00:02:49.630> do<00:02:49.720> now<00:02:49.750> is<00:02:50.200> add

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
idea so what I want to do now is add

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.350 
idea so what I want to do now is add
something<00:02:50.890> to<00:02:51.040> the<00:02:51.250> end<00:02:51.430> of<00:02:51.610> that<00:02:51.700> downspout

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
something to the end of that downspout

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.330 
something to the end of that downspout
that<00:02:52.840> will<00:02:52.989> carry<00:02:53.200> the<00:02:53.410> water<00:02:53.590> well<00:02:54.069> away<00:02:54.310> from

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
that will carry the water well away from

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.110 
that will carry the water well away from
the<00:02:54.640> house<00:02:54.790> a<00:02:55.590> splash<00:02:56.590> block<00:02:56.950> like<00:02:57.280> this<00:02:57.550> made

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:41.580 
strainer in the top of the downspout
this<00:03:37.660> is<00:03:37.840> a<00:03:37.870> wire<00:03:38.140> mesh<00:03:38.470> type

now I know the best way to keep my
gutters<00:03:53.930> clean<00:03:54.230> is<00:03:54.439> to<00:03:54.560> prevent<00:03:54.829> debris<00:03:55.069> from

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
gutters clean is to prevent debris from

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:56.550 
gutters clean is to prevent debris from

gutter guards are one option they come

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:01.210 
gutter guards are one option they come

improvement<00:04:02.720> center<00:04:05.859> quite<00:04:06.859> honestly<00:04:07.010> I

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
improvement center quite honestly I

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.399 
improvement center quite honestly I
found<00:04:07.730> these<00:04:07.849> little<00:04:08.180> tricky<00:04:08.510> to<00:04:08.540> install<00:04:09.079> and

00:04:09.399 --> 00:04:09.409 
found these little tricky to install and

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:11.349 
found these little tricky to install and
if<00:04:09.859> wet<00:04:10.040> leaves<00:04:10.280> were<00:04:10.519> to<00:04:10.639> collect<00:04:10.909> on<00:04:11.060> top

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:11.359 
if wet leaves were to collect on top

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:12.819 
if wet leaves were to collect on top
well<00:04:11.629> I<00:04:11.659> think<00:04:11.750> it<00:04:11.989> could<00:04:12.230> restrict<00:04:12.560> the<00:04:12.739> flow

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:12.829 
well I think it could restrict the flow

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:14.949 
well I think it could restrict the flow
of<00:04:12.920> water<00:04:13.219> so<00:04:13.760> I'm<00:04:14.239> going<00:04:14.510> to<00:04:14.540> check<00:04:14.810> out

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
of water so I'm going to check out
