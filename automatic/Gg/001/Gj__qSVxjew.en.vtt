00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
a feel for the script and the material

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.469 
a feel for the script and the material
to<00:01:22.439> see<00:01:22.619> if<00:01:22.799> what<00:01:23.490> we've<00:01:23.729> written<00:01:24.030> as<00:01:24.210> working

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
and then we can get a sense of if

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.260 
and then we can get a sense of if
there's<00:01:27.479> chemistry<00:01:27.659> between<00:01:28.110> Seth<00:01:28.950> or

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.219 
real actors there as much as I can what
if<00:01:47.009> someone<00:01:47.280> isn't<00:01:47.820> good<00:01:48.119> at<00:01:48.210> improvising<00:01:48.600> do

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
if someone isn't good at improvising do

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.020 
if someone isn't good at improvising do
you<00:01:49.320> take<00:01:49.649> that<00:01:49.799> into<00:01:49.979> consideration<00:01:50.009> or<00:01:50.850> will

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
you take that into consideration or will

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.760 
you take that into consideration or will
they<00:01:51.119> just<00:01:51.149> not<00:01:51.450> work<00:01:51.720> and<00:01:52.439> you<00:01:52.590> it<00:01:52.740> just

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
they just not work and you it just

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.170 
they just not work and you it just
depends<00:01:53.340> on<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.549> part<00:01:53.820> you<00:01:53.939> know<00:01:54.000> there<00:01:54.149> are

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
depends on the part you know there are

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.270 
depends on the part you know there are
certain<00:01:54.329> parts<00:01:54.720> where<00:01:55.020> you<00:01:55.740> realize<00:01:56.070> though

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
certain parts where you realize though

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.090 
certain parts where you realize though
that<00:01:56.490> seems<00:01:56.759> not<00:01:57.030> going<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.299> change<00:01:57.930> much<00:01:58.259> but

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
that seems not going to change much but

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.499 
that seems not going to change much but
I<00:01:59.159> find<00:01:59.460> that<00:01:59.520> most<00:01:59.700> actors<00:02:00.000> are<00:02:00.149> good<00:02:00.420> at

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
I find that most actors are good at

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:01.999 
I find that most actors are good at
improvising<00:02:00.840> if<00:02:01.140> they<00:02:01.229> just<00:02:01.409> relax<00:02:01.740> I<00:02:01.920> have

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
improvising if they just relax I have

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.170 
improvising if they just relax I have
yet<00:02:02.189> to<00:02:02.219> see<00:02:02.579> a<00:02:02.909> fantastic<00:02:03.540> actor<00:02:03.869> who
