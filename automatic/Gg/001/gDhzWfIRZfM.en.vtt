 tears were in her eyes and everyone thought 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.950
 and the insult she later recognized that from 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.500

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:26.000
 two Korean specialists with whom 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:28.630
 she used to work but separately 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:32.569

 rolled rather weakly warm up 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:54.440
 because a break of two years 

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:58.120
 naturally deprived her of rating points 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:06:00.260
 therefore she could not be sown in that 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:06.340
 where the 12 strongest are in the basket 

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:06.340
