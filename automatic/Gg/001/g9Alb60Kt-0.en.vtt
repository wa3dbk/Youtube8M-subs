00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:13.580 
they are is a carbon fiber right here it

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.100 
they are is a carbon fiber right here it
says<00:00:13.610> that<00:00:13.940> here<00:00:14.680> vapor<00:00:15.680> may<00:00:16.219> presume<00:00:17.110> flywire

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:20.930 
and what it is is carbon fiber here on

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.560 
and what it is is carbon fiber here on
the<00:00:21.020> bottom<00:00:21.340> which<00:00:22.340> is<00:00:22.580> really<00:00:23.330> good<00:00:23.510> because

it gives it extra strength and also has
some<00:00:26.690> flexibility<00:00:27.470> to<00:00:27.680> it<00:00:27.830> so<00:00:28.189> when<00:00:28.310> you<00:00:28.430> take

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180 
kind of hard to get on so you want to

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:57.369 
kind of hard to get on so you want to
make<00:00:56.210> sure<00:00:56.329> you<00:00:56.480> have<00:00:56.600> thin<00:00:56.809> socks<00:00:57.079> and

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
make sure you have thin socks and

00:00:57.379 --> 00:00:58.779 
make sure you have thin socks and
they're<00:00:57.710> pretty<00:00:57.829> comfortable<00:00:58.340> you<00:00:58.579> know<00:00:58.610> it

00:00:58.779 --> 00:00:58.789 
they're pretty comfortable you know it

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:01.510 
they're pretty comfortable you know it
has<00:00:59.050> super<00:01:00.050> good<00:01:00.230> ankle<00:01:00.800> support<00:01:01.190> around<00:01:01.309> here

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:01.520 
has super good ankle support around here

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:02.950 
has super good ankle support around here
because<00:01:01.760> I<00:01:01.940> don't<00:01:02.090> know<00:01:02.149> if<00:01:02.210> you<00:01:02.270> can<00:01:02.449> see<00:01:02.660> but

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
because I don't know if you can see but

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.279 
because I don't know if you can see but
it<00:01:03.590> has<00:01:03.879> really<00:01:04.879> thick<00:01:05.210> padding<00:01:05.719> around<00:01:05.840> here

00:01:06.279 --> 00:01:06.289 
it has really thick padding around here

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:09.849 
it has really thick padding around here
so<00:01:06.889> it<00:01:07.039> keeps<00:01:07.189> your<00:01:07.459> ankle<00:01:07.880> from<00:01:08.679> being<00:01:09.679> able

00:01:09.849 --> 00:01:09.859 
so it keeps your ankle from being able

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:11.260 
so it keeps your ankle from being able
to<00:01:09.979> roll<00:01:10.189> is<00:01:10.369> easy<00:01:10.639> when<00:01:10.909> you're<00:01:11.060> playing

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:12.910 
to roll is easy when you're playing
frisbee<00:01:11.569> because<00:01:11.929> in<00:01:12.079> frisbee<00:01:12.259> you<00:01:12.529> jump<00:01:12.829> a

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
frisbee because in frisbee you jump a

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.830 
frisbee because in frisbee you jump a
lot<00:01:13.069> and<00:01:13.310> a<00:01:14.149> lot<00:01:14.179> of<00:01:14.299> times<00:01:14.569> when<00:01:14.749> you're

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840

thing is I really like the cleats here

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:24.339 
thing is I really like the cleats here
on<00:01:21.319> the<00:01:21.409> bottom<00:01:21.590> um<00:01:22.399> see<00:01:23.299> here<00:01:23.539> you<00:01:23.569> really

00:01:24.339 --> 00:01:24.349 
on the bottom um see here you really

00:01:24.349 --> 00:01:26.349 
on the bottom um see here you really
