functions<00:00:36.440> basically<00:00:36.770> should<00:00:37.730> we<00:00:37.910> observe

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:38.270 
functions basically should we observe

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.050 
functions basically should we observe
water<00:00:38.630> and<00:00:38.989> minerals<00:00:39.890> from<00:00:40.100> a<00:00:40.190> food<00:00:40.820> that<00:00:40.910> have

you've got the colon about 50 feet long
and<00:00:58.010> the<00:00:58.370> concept<00:00:58.879> is<00:00:59.000> soon<00:00:59.210> or<00:00:59.450> under

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
and the concept is soon or under

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.740 
and the concept is soon or under
sedation<00:01:00.559> when<00:01:01.010> we<00:01:01.160> can<00:01:01.340> do<00:01:01.520> a<00:01:01.550> good<00:01:01.790> job<00:01:01.850> is<00:01:02.390> to

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
sedation when we can do a good job is to

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.980 
sedation when we can do a good job is to
look<00:01:02.960> with<00:01:03.260> a<00:01:03.290> tube<00:01:03.649> that<00:01:04.089> we<00:01:05.089> call<00:01:05.329> in<00:01:05.600> oaklawn

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
look with a tube that we call in oaklawn

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.080 
look with a tube that we call in oaklawn
scope<00:01:06.469> is<00:01:06.590> a<00:01:06.619> flexible<00:01:07.039> tube<00:01:07.459> with<00:01:07.670> a<00:01:07.700> light<00:01:07.939> at

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
scope is a flexible tube with a light at

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:09.669 
scope is a flexible tube with a light at
the<00:01:08.119> end<00:01:08.240> of<00:01:08.450> this<00:01:08.659> time<00:01:08.899> and<00:01:09.109> that<00:01:09.439> still

00:01:09.669 --> 00:01:09.679 
the end of this time and that still

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:12.190 
the end of this time and that still
allows<00:01:09.829> us<00:01:10.310> to<00:01:10.520> travel<00:01:10.939> the<00:01:11.299> five<00:01:11.810> feet

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
allows us to travel the five feet

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.289 
allows us to travel the five feet
distance<00:01:12.799> owes<00:01:13.069> to<00:01:13.429> the<00:01:13.549> beginning<00:01:13.700> of<00:01:14.149> the

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:14.299 
distance owes to the beginning of the

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:16.719 
distance owes to the beginning of the
column<00:01:14.630> okay<00:01:15.170> and<00:01:15.469> as<00:01:15.649> we<00:01:15.859> come<00:01:16.219> back<00:01:16.490> we

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
column okay and as we come back we

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
didn't pay close attention to think that

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.010 
didn't pay close attention to think that
shouldn't<00:01:19.279> be<00:01:19.399> there<00:01:19.609> this<00:01:20.359> is<00:01:20.509> what<00:01:20.659> a<00:01:20.689> normal

it knows one one big one one problem
that<00:01:47.569> is<00:01:47.810> growing<00:01:48.049> out<00:01:48.349> of<00:01:48.380> control<00:01:48.529> oh<00:01:49.130> I<00:01:49.399> see

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
that is growing out of control oh I see

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:51.339 
that is growing out of control oh I see
that's<00:01:50.240> why<00:01:50.419> we're<00:01:50.569> saying<00:01:50.779> it<00:01:50.840> takes<00:01:51.020> to<00:01:51.169> go

00:01:51.339 --> 00:01:51.349 
that's why we're saying it takes to go

00:01:51.349 --> 00:01:53.949 
that's why we're saying it takes to go
from<00:01:51.380> this<00:01:51.770> stage<00:01:52.130> here<00:01:52.459> to<00:01:52.819> cancel<00:01:53.119> stage<00:01:53.689> is

00:01:53.949 --> 00:01:53.959 
from this stage here to cancel stage is

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:57.129 
from this stage here to cancel stage is
about<00:01:54.740> 10<00:01:55.219> years<00:01:55.700> and<00:01:56.270> that's<00:01:56.779> what<00:01:56.959> we're

00:01:57.129 --> 00:01:57.139 
about 10 years and that's what we're

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:59.199 
about 10 years and that's what we're
talking<00:01:57.469> about<00:01:57.529> here<00:01:57.739> so<00:01:58.249> so<00:01:58.609> if<00:01:58.880> we<00:01:58.909> were<00:01:59.149> to

00:01:59.199 --> 00:01:59.209 
talking about here so so if we were to

00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:00.729 
talking about here so so if we were to
find<00:01:59.329> cancer<00:01:59.810> because<00:02:00.259> there's<00:02:00.499> what<00:02:00.619> we<00:02:00.709> call

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:00.739 
find cancer because there's what we call

00:02:00.739 --> 00:02:04.050 
find cancer because there's what we call
stage<00:02:01.249> 1<00:02:01.549> 2<00:02:01.819> 3<00:02:01.849> and<00:02:02.329> 4<00:02:02.389> or<00:02:02.810> cat<00:02:03.049> stage<00:02:03.319> one<00:02:03.560> is

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
stage 1 2 3 and 4 or cat stage one is

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.790 
stage 1 2 3 and 4 or cat stage one is
didn<00:02:05.060> t<00:02:05.149> know

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:05.800 
didn t know

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.180 
didn t know
lumen<00:02:06.700> of<00:02:06.910> the<00:02:07.660> colon<00:02:08.200> itself<00:02:08.620> its<00:02:08.860> meaning

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
lumen of the colon itself its meaning

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.160 
lumen of the colon itself its meaning
that<00:02:09.340> is<00:02:09.520> inside<00:02:09.880> the<00:02:10.000> cone<00:02:10.210> wall<00:02:10.600> and<00:02:10.840> that's

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
that is inside the cone wall and that's

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.920 
that is inside the cone wall and that's
the<00:02:11.320> best<00:02:11.800> stage<00:02:12.220> of<00:02:12.460> cancer<00:02:12.700> to<00:02:13.540> be<00:02:13.690> picked

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
the best stage of cancer to be picked

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.600 
the best stage of cancer to be picked
obviously<00:02:14.470> prevention<00:02:15.130> is<00:02:15.220> better<00:02:15.250> than<00:02:15.490> cure

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
obviously prevention is better than cure

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.940 
obviously prevention is better than cure
but<00:02:16.480> if<00:02:16.570> you<00:02:16.660> would<00:02:16.810> have<00:02:16.990> cancer<00:02:17.470> stage<00:02:17.740> one

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
but if you would have cancer stage one

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.590 
but if you would have cancer stage one
is<00:02:18.610> a<00:02:18.670> personal<00:02:19.300> stage<00:02:19.570> then<00:02:20.110> it<00:02:20.380> was<00:02:21.390> 34<00:02:22.390> is

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
is a personal stage then it was 34 is

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.240 
is a personal stage then it was 34 is
when<00:02:22.810> it<00:02:22.930> spread<00:02:23.200> to<00:02:23.230> all<00:02:23.470> no<00:02:23.650> distant<00:02:24.070> organs

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
when it spread to all no distant organs

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.730 
when it spread to all no distant organs
so<00:02:24.880> survival<00:02:25.480> here<00:02:25.810> on<00:02:26.020> stage<00:02:26.230> one<00:02:26.290> is<00:02:26.560> about

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
so survival here on stage one is about

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.060 
so survival here on stage one is about
ninety<00:02:27.220> percent<00:02:27.660> okay<00:02:28.660> and<00:02:28.930> in<00:02:29.560> stage<00:02:29.800> three

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
ninety percent okay and in stage three

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.220 
ninety percent okay and in stage three
here<00:02:30.400> between<00:02:30.910> here<00:02:31.300> and<00:02:31.390> there<00:02:31.510> about<00:02:31.600> sixty

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
here between here and there about sixty

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:33.600 
here between here and there about sixty
percent<00:02:32.410> when<00:02:32.890> you<00:02:33.010> know<00:02:33.160> if<00:02:33.310> you<00:02:33.400> especially

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
percent when you know if you especially

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.270 
percent when you know if you especially
got<00:02:34.090> lemon<00:02:34.570> nodes<00:02:34.750> are<00:02:34.960> involved<00:02:35.290> and<00:02:35.620> if<00:02:36.160> you

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
got lemon nodes are involved and if you

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.860 
got lemon nodes are involved and if you
got<00:02:36.430> this<00:02:36.640> time<00:02:36.850> spread<00:02:37.210> is<00:02:37.360> about<00:02:37.600> ten

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
got this time spread is about ten

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.750 
got this time spread is about ten
percent<00:02:38.050> five-year<00:02:38.680> survival<00:02:38.830> so<00:02:39.400> it's<00:02:39.580> so

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
percent five-year survival so it's so

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.480 
percent five-year survival so it's so
obviously<00:02:40.240> very<00:02:40.780> very<00:02:41.140> important<00:02:41.980> just<00:02:42.280> to

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
obviously very very important just to

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:46.650 
obviously very very important just to
pick<00:02:42.790> it<00:02:42.910> up<00:02:43.030> early<00:02:43.510> all<00:02:43.690> our<00:02:43.870> soul<00:02:44.170> yeah
