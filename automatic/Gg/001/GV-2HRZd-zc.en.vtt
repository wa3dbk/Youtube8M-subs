00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:12.730
 yes 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.460
 if you start the rap session on 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:21.070
 climbing fire and thinner than you 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.079

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.480
 they cover me by counting in this rhyme the 

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:27.789
 visions that I had in dreams because if the 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.070
 death is disguised as katrina no 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:31.900
 I can undress these days because 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.360
 Sometimes 100 people suffer so that you 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.580
 you laugh in this world is I have to say the 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.170
 true journalists are our models 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:40.420
 that come out on the screen disguises 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.220
 you lie the truth and suddenly without 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.050
 neglecting radio came out through your blood and 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.329
 for your post and people die of hunger 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.910
 and poverty that we forgot and without goodbye 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:50.500
 while others pray is very common these 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.780
 times who behaves like a 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.640
 true madrid but there is also that 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.620
 that has a tremendous desire to live 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.820
 there are people who have their mouths full but 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.379
 the empty brain 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.840
 there are those who block problems and want 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:04.030
 just jump empty the labels be 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.520
 only for anarchist clothes 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:10.229
 communist specialists in this world 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.229
 our souls are just lives 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.899
 the petrol pumps and three grenades 

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:18.819
 is the balance exploited by the media is 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:23.590
 time to look for the state by your side and 

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:25.869
 release all your fears your new ones do not 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.969
 it takes three grenades is the balance in 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:29.829
 told by the media it's time to look 

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:32.549
 whereby it showed side and release 

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:32.549
 all fears 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:38.550
 We spend the salary in the squares and we 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.830
 we make 200 women consumers 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.420
 born from scratch the only thing we can 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.070
 brag about our life are the 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.260
 photographs that we upload to facebook 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.300
 walking on the beach because that's why 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.670
 that we are fed up with ourselves 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:53.100
 now we wake up we procure a country 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.050
 better and that's why we fight the sky 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.060
 God governs it and the earth the Bavaria 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.190
 the devil that I do not want to open my eyes 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.860
 to advance will be left behind in the 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:04.290
 happened the same with the lion's fury and 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.450
 the rumor of a thousand waters of the ocean we went 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.490
 all together the rhymes of a rapper who 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.010
 claims more apathy than a dancer 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:13.020
 when the exasperating crying of 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:14.850
 a dam has hit me the anti-bullfighting 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.220
 of outrage when no animals 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.710
 mistreated the blood of a society 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.880
 stained rage the sadness of a 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.890
 raped woman 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.750
 we are the brutal reality that is breathed 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.580
 in the streets fighting against a 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.830
 television that wants the candles already 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.710
 only what you speak for each door that 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.360
 it closes there is a window that opens 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:35.490
 we leave alone inside of us we have 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.910
 cried so much alone that today the 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.910
 blood 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:45.090
 molotov bombs and grenades is the balance the 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:47.310
 county by the media it's time to look 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.760
 by the track not only divides the art of 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.760
 the walls 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:55.400
 two molotov bombs three grenades is the 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.960
 balance seized by the media is time 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.220
 to look for the one next to us 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.220
 and release all fears 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:08.550
 remember what makes you happy to bring in 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:11.160
 what makes you happy if you do not have 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:14.580
 a job try if you are afraid of 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:17.040
 fail try see others as 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:20.010
 if it was your own self and you speak for 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:23.010
 those who have no voice to 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:25.280
 Conquering a nation will be necessary 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.410
 first conquer our interior 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:32.010
 brothers around the world of all 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:35.060
 races what they are not is the fight and the 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:38.819
 Hope we are the wealth of the earth 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:40.319
 the beauty of the flora and the strength of 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:42.270
 the fauna 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:44.290
 hope 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:47.969
 hold 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.969
 the people lift you
