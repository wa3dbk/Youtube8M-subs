00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.030

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.490
 difficult and then we had to comply with 

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:23.320
 a few more that were already signed 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.140
 and we were two of us 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.360
 and we canceled or we could already cancel 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.430
 what was coming because it was wrong when 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.990
 fernanda also in fact we made a 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.420
 show and still she did not know I was 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.520
 normal and is that it was and we went to 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.190
 to do a show and after two days I was 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:42.450
 hospitalized and well we also had 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:45.390
 to fulfill some commitments this 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.760
 and singing more and I also the minimum 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:51.060
 what what could no longer be canceled 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:55.380

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:57.900

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:01.970

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.970
 that it has not touched me and it touches me 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:09.060
 there is a cold that to touch ok you know 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.860
 ask one last question and this is with 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.510
 respect I say we all know that the 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.270
 artists of the 80s are filling the 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.310
 national audience very well and you are 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.710
 going perfect on the tours in manuel 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.020
 Mijares and there are other functions 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.840
 there in this case you were the 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.670
 wick that turned on for the tour of flans 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.560
 to leave and good to me I would have 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.320
 chances of how are you doing 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.550
 also to her if to you too 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.100
 they did audiences because I'm sure 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.900
 what would they do 10 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.640
 well we take into account you 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.600
 it seems we keep it here is a good 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.360
 commentary 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:44.400
 and we chew it 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.740
 hair against hair to this 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.560
 advancing against the demon not but in 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.420
 the concepts and also because if for a 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.970
 side sing successes and on the other also 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.970
 I assure you it works 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:04.640
 very good, my question is what is the 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.890
 secret for you to stay 28 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:10.759
 years together because they are currently 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:13.310
 trios groups and duets spend 23 years and 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.530
 we consider the people who follow them 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.930
 they are at the top and suddenly soon 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.640
 separate they become soloists for you 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.020
 what is the advice or the secret more than 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:26.209
 nothing to always stay together and 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:28.150
 successful not especially look we grew 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:30.159
 together 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.680
 we grew up together and we love each other 

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:35.970
 good house crib and same rolled the 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.970
 calm if I changed diapers 

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:41.970
 if this comes from the families that is 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.120
 they know about life then so 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.799
 as good as blood calls 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.840
 the time to get together to work 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:51.510
 they change the stories a little bit despite 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.290
 of the love that we have there is much 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.849
 respect we respect each other very much 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.590
 we try to see for the good of the neighbor 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:01.950
 really whenever there is any with 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.480
 some problem the mood sometimes not 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.879
 we are in such good spirits 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.160
 we go better we have to raise the note 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:11.040
 we always try to lift it away from 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.819
 there is again with your character you do not know 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:18.120
 can you say anything that does not exist 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:19.920
 we hold the moments we respect them 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.690
 we are very respectful in our down 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.090
 in our work we are very 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.470
 responsible in our work because 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.549
 that would also be a meeting point 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:33.239
 hey, he never arrives he arrives too late 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:35.129
 he wanted to come in order we give him the same 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:37.140
 priority we agree on that we give 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:39.450
 priority to our work as with 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.489
 another one we also give high priority to 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.099
 our personal life in that too 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:45.720
 we agree and we see to shelter that 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:47.340
 part of our lives 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.959
 Hey, I have the wedding of I do not know who 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.639
 I have the baptism I have to be in the 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:52.709
 school with my daughter and we see the 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:54.720
 possibility of opening that space for 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:56.790
 that we can fulfill and if you are well 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:00.209
 everything will be fine when you have a 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.769
 deficiency out there a lack or you're 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:04.169
 of bad for something you could not do 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:06.959
 we all start four chirping we always see 

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:09.000
 for the good of us and well then I 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:10.470
 I think it's basically communication 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.680
 the respect 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.250
 and the love of what we do no longer 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.530
 we would be here 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:20.019
 we like to sing a lot and we like it very much 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:22.630
 sing together and tell you one that is 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:24.310
 came out and came back it fascinated me to be in 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:27.100
 pandora I really like what they do 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:29.500
 so much now I really like those harmonies 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:32.340
 we make that sound that pandora has 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.340
 you do not know what excites me 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:40.529
 it's hot a little bit we have if we 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:45.599
 could they put an idea or not 

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:48.440
 that they raise it a little bit of human warmth 

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:50.600
 and of love 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:53.930
 yes the pinkest diary this yesterday 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:56.270
 lupita d'alessio and yuri announced a 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:59.000
 joint tour to step on a stage 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:02.330
 I would call you I do not know with daniela 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:06.080
 blunt another figure of the 80 please more 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:08.870
 go ahead to offer them ocesa then 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:11.690
 it's a bit with combined with the question 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:14.480
 de de france I do not think that if in some 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:19.400
 moment we step on stage with someone 

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:23.600
 and eighty clearly so the first 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:26.300
 option that we think could be the cns 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:29.180
 because that's what I as a public 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:31.610
 I would like to sit down and watch everything we have not 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:33.980
 thought they throw us the question right now 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:36.350
 who is father and could be feasible 

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:39.170
 pose that a little light is that 

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:41.810
 our truth now we have shared 

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:43.250
 scenario with great people and always 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:45.620
 cute is the truth is that it is always 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:47.360

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:50.620
