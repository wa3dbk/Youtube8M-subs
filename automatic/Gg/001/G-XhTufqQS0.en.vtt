and the original river door is I have a

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.450 
and the original river door is I have a
signal<00:00:13.710> inverted<00:00:14.599> it<00:00:15.599> just<00:00:16.049> I<00:00:16.289> think<00:00:17.100> it's<00:00:17.250> a

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
signal inverted it just I think it's a

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.920 
signal inverted it just I think it's a
little<00:00:17.730> better<00:00:18.710> place<00:00:19.710> like<00:00:19.920> this<00:00:20.779> just<00:00:21.779> open

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
little better place like this just open

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.540 
little better place like this just open
