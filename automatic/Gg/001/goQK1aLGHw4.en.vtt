00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
with that 9 speed automatic transmission

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.510 
with that 9 speed automatic transmission
whilst<00:02:31.820> it<00:02:32.090> operates<00:02:32.510> OK<00:02:33.020> in<00:02:33.200> auto<00:02:33.470> mode<00:02:33.980> when

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520

you go to sport it gets a bit abrupt the
more<00:02:37.310> worrying<00:02:37.790> aspect<00:02:38.300> is<00:02:38.480> the<00:02:38.600> fact<00:02:38.840> that

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
more worrying aspect is the fact that

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.350 
more worrying aspect is the fact that
during<00:02:39.230> the<00:02:39.440> test<00:02:39.710> I<00:02:40.010> hardly<00:02:40.610> ever<00:02:40.730> saw<00:02:41.120> 8th
