 the Apostle 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.080
 he only evangelized for four years by mexico and the united states that 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.540
 those that Jesus Christ had for him and his wife a very important mission 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.520
 that medical mission brings the apostles to the city of origin if the 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.290
 city ​​of ontinyent in the united states in the place chosen by god 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.460
