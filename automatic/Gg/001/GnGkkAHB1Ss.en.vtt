00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
get it very easily one way is to get all

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.960 
get it very easily one way is to get all
your<00:02:12.170> team<00:02:12.560> constantly<00:02:13.400> rushing<00:02:13.610> from<00:02:13.849> the

really<00:02:44.299> playing<00:02:44.569> the<00:02:44.840> objective<00:02:44.900> since<00:02:45.500> I

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
really playing the objective since I

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.199 
really playing the objective since I
haven't<00:02:45.859> been<00:02:46.010> going<00:02:46.190> to<00:02:46.340> the<00:02:46.489> capture<00:02:46.850> points

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
haven't been going to the capture points

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:49.210 
haven't been going to the capture points
but<00:02:47.450> that<00:02:48.019> brings<00:02:48.170> me<00:02:48.380> to<00:02:48.530> the<00:02:48.590> second<00:02:48.950> way<00:02:49.069> of

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
but that brings me to the second way of

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.620 
but that brings me to the second way of
winning<00:02:49.400> this<00:02:49.579> game<00:02:49.790> if<00:02:50.000> you've<00:02:50.150> got<00:02:50.329> a<00:02:50.359> pretty

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
winning this game if you've got a pretty

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.320 
winning this game if you've got a pretty
decent<00:02:50.840> team

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
decent team

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.000 
decent team
what<00:02:52.420> you<00:02:52.540> can<00:02:52.720> do<00:02:52.900> is<00:02:53.140> have<00:02:53.320> two<00:02:53.530> or<00:02:53.680> three<00:02:53.710> of

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
what you can do is have two or three of

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:55.590 
what you can do is have two or three of
them<00:02:54.160> constantly<00:02:54.640> going<00:02:54.910> for<00:02:55.210> the<00:02:55.330> capture

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
them constantly going for the capture

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.600 
them constantly going for the capture
point<00:02:55.990> and<00:02:56.230> you<00:02:56.860> have<00:02:57.040> the<00:02:57.190> rest<00:02:57.370> of<00:02:57.520> your

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
point and you have the rest of your

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.120 
point and you have the rest of your
clearly<00:02:57.880> sit<00:02:58.750> just<00:02:58.990> outside<00:02:59.170> of<00:02:59.500> the<00:02:59.710> capture

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
clearly sit just outside of the capture

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.160 
clearly sit just outside of the capture
point<00:03:00.310> and<00:03:00.670> pick<00:03:01.090> off<00:03:01.270> all<00:03:01.480> the<00:03:01.660> people<00:03:01.930> just

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
point and pick off all the people just

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.900 
point and pick off all the people just
running<00:03:02.470> straight<00:03:02.650> for<00:03:03.220> the<00:03:03.430> capture<00:03:03.640> point

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
running straight for the capture point

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.250 
running straight for the capture point
because<00:03:04.240> a<00:03:04.270> lot<00:03:04.540> of<00:03:04.570> people<00:03:04.660> don't<00:03:05.110> really

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
because a lot of people don't really

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.380 
because a lot of people don't really
look<00:03:05.500> around<00:03:05.830> all<00:03:06.280> they<00:03:06.550> focus<00:03:06.940> on<00:03:07.090> its<00:03:07.270> go

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
look around all they focus on its go

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.510 
look around all they focus on its go
into<00:03:07.690> that<00:03:07.780> get<00:03:08.050> into<00:03:08.230> that<00:03:08.320> area<00:03:08.590> and<00:03:08.920> so<00:03:09.460> if

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:09.520 
into that get into that area and so if

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.560 
into that get into that area and so if
you<00:03:09.640> have<00:03:09.760> a<00:03:09.790> couple<00:03:10.060> people<00:03:10.210> sitting<00:03:10.540> around

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:10.570 
you have a couple people sitting around

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.450 
you have a couple people sitting around
the<00:03:10.900> perimeter<00:03:11.290> of<00:03:11.320> that<00:03:11.560> which<00:03:11.980> is<00:03:12.010> what<00:03:12.310> I'm

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:12.460 
the perimeter of that which is what I'm

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.270 
the perimeter of that which is what I'm
doing<00:03:12.820> you<00:03:13.450> get<00:03:13.840> a<00:03:13.870> lot<00:03:14.200> of<00:03:14.230> kills<00:03:14.620> very<00:03:14.980> easily

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
doing you get a lot of kills very easily

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.330 
doing you get a lot of kills very easily
so<00:03:15.760> that<00:03:16.750> way<00:03:16.930> it<00:03:17.080> helps<00:03:17.110> out<00:03:17.440> the<00:03:17.560> team<00:03:17.770> you

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
so that way it helps out the team you

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:19.620 
so that way it helps out the team you
don't<00:03:18.520> have<00:03:18.640> as<00:03:18.760> many<00:03:18.850> people<00:03:19.240> go<00:03:19.360> into<00:03:19.480> the

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
don't have as many people go into the

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.090 
don't have as many people go into the
capture<00:03:19.990> point<00:03:20.140> and<00:03:20.350> got<00:03:20.470> the<00:03:20.560> two<00:03:20.710> people

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
capture point and got the two people

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.210 
capture point and got the two people
sitting<00:03:21.250> on<00:03:21.490> the<00:03:22.140> capture<00:03:23.140> area<00:03:23.170> and<00:03:23.830> you're

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
sitting on the capture area and you're

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.980 
sitting on the capture area and you're
getting<00:03:24.340> a<00:03:24.490> lot<00:03:24.700> of<00:03:24.760> points<00:03:25.240> a<00:03:25.420> lot<00:03:25.600> of<00:03:25.630> kills

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:25.990 
getting a lot of points a lot of kills

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:27.870 
getting a lot of points a lot of kills
and<00:03:26.740> make<00:03:26.980> sure<00:03:27.130> you<00:03:27.220> always<00:03:27.400> have<00:03:27.670> people

another way to win this that's exactly

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.620 
another way to win this that's exactly
what

up saving my life and allowing me to get

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.800 
up saving my life and allowing me to get
my<00:04:23.350> moab<00:04:23.950> and<00:04:24.130> this<00:04:24.550> is<00:04:24.790> my<00:04:25.090> very<00:04:25.300> first<00:04:25.510> Moab

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
my moab and this is my very first Moab

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:27.750 
my moab and this is my very first Moab
I've<00:04:26.260> never<00:04:26.440> gotten<00:04:26.740> a<00:04:26.830> more<00:04:27.010> out<00:04:27.130> before<00:04:27.490> and

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
I've never gotten a more out before and

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.640 
I've never gotten a more out before and
I<00:04:28.360> wasn't<00:04:28.570> expecting<00:04:28.840> to<00:04:29.169> get<00:04:29.290> one<00:04:29.470> in<00:04:29.560> this

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
I wasn't expecting to get one in this

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:31.820 
I wasn't expecting to get one in this
game<00:04:29.889> play<00:04:30.130> just<00:04:30.400> kind<00:04:30.580> of<00:04:30.639> ended<00:04:30.790> up<00:04:31.000> at<00:04:31.180> me<00:04:31.389> so

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
game play just kind of ended up at me so

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.409 
game play just kind of ended up at me so
that's<00:04:32.830> why<00:04:33.130> I<00:04:33.160> as<00:04:33.580> you<00:04:33.729> can<00:04:33.850> see<00:04:33.970> the<00:04:34.090> title

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:34.419 
that's why I as you can see the title

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:36.690 
that's why I as you can see the title
this<00:04:34.660> is<00:04:34.720> my<00:04:35.110> very<00:04:35.530> first<00:04:35.860> Moab<00:04:36.160> and<00:04:36.310> it<00:04:36.550> just

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:36.700 
this is my very first Moab and it just

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.200 
this is my very first Moab and it just
happened<00:04:37.030> to<00:04:37.060> be<00:04:37.120> on<00:04:37.300> drop<00:04:37.570> zone<00:04:38.820> on<00:04:39.820> bootleg

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
happened to be on drop zone on bootleg

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:43.250 
happened to be on drop zone on bootleg
so<00:04:41.020> a<00:04:41.350> couple<00:04:41.919> unique<00:04:42.340> things<00:04:42.580> about<00:04:42.729> this

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:43.260 
so a couple unique things about this

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:47.460 
so a couple unique things about this
