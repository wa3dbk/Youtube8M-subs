00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
shrinking this one this one right so the

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.310 
shrinking this one this one right so the
music<00:04:58.520> control<00:04:58.880> will<00:04:59.060> be<00:04:59.210> only<00:04:59.660> three<00:04:59.990> and

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
this too will be something else so this

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.330 
this too will be something else so this
isn't<00:05:02.540> a<00:05:02.600> final<00:05:02.990> model<00:05:03.200> is<00:05:03.530> not<00:05:03.770> it<00:05:04.040> is<00:05:04.070> very

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:04.340 
isn't a final model is not it is very

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:07.150 
isn't a final model is not it is very
close<00:05:04.580> purpose<00:05:05.240> right<00:05:05.780> when<00:05:06.020> the<00:05:06.680> user

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 
close purpose right when the user
