00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
better than you expected and the second

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.280 
better than you expected and the second
cow<00:01:05.220> probably<00:01:05.850> because<00:01:06.659> that<00:01:06.840> was<00:01:06.960> when<00:01:07.140> I<00:01:07.170> was

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
cow probably because that was when I was

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.230

trying to cut on my first cut but it
didn't<00:01:09.539> really<00:01:09.659> work<00:01:09.780> out<00:01:10.109> and<00:01:10.319> so<00:01:10.469> I<00:01:10.499> got

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
didn't really work out and so I got

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.559 
didn't really work out and so I got
nervous<00:01:11.069> and<00:01:11.429> switched<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:12.030> a<00:01:12.060> different<00:01:12.119> one

00:01:12.559 --> 00:01:12.569
