00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.690
 Belgian Grand Prix with his soup 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:22.009

 and when we talk about spatm we know the 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.750
 steep red water that makes this 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.360
 turn you arrive at 290 km hour 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.769
 feel at 275 290 that the car was 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.989
 crushed by the slope 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:59.489
 it's a circuit where you have a lot of fun 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.159
 yeah that's the longest circuit of 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.290
 championship 7 km is so big 

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:06.060
 in nature that in fact they can to 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.789
 several weather on one turn and that 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.420
 make the race that's a bit complicated 

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:11.070
 a little 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.840

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.780
 so I love the whipped cream siphon 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:29.670
 does not happen to be a team of 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.600
