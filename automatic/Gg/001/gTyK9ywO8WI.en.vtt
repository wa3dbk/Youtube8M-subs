00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
opinion I do not believe that they

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.610 
opinion I do not believe that they
should<00:04:12.060> have<00:04:12.389> added<00:04:12.750> the<00:04:12.870> speakers<00:04:13.290> to<00:04:13.319> the

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
should have added the speakers to the

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.379 
should have added the speakers to the
bottom<00:04:13.919> of<00:04:14.010> the<00:04:14.189> phone<00:04:14.430> because<00:04:14.819> once<00:04:15.060> I<00:04:15.209> try

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:15.389 
bottom of the phone because once I try

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:18.050 
bottom of the phone because once I try
to<00:04:15.419> play<00:04:15.689> a<00:04:15.720> game<00:04:15.810> and<00:04:16.590> landscape<00:04:17.280> my<00:04:17.519> fingers

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
to play a game and landscape my fingers

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.930 
to play a game and landscape my fingers
cover<00:04:18.419> up<00:04:18.630> the<00:04:18.780> speaker<00:04:19.109> and<00:04:19.289> it<00:04:19.769> just<00:04:20.759> does

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
cover up the speaker and it just does

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.029 
cover up the speaker and it just does
not<00:04:21.090> work<00:04:21.389> right<00:04:21.750> so<00:04:22.079> i<00:04:22.109> really<00:04:22.440> think<00:04:22.919> that

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:23.039 
not work right so i really think that

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:25.909 
not work right so i really think that
it's<00:04:23.280> a<00:04:23.370> dell<00:04:23.550> fall<00:04:23.849> for<00:04:24.180> them<00:04:24.330> to<00:04:24.509> do<00:04:24.660> that<00:04:24.919> my

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
it's a dell fall for them to do that my

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:27.499 
it's a dell fall for them to do that my
