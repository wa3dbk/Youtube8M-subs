00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:16.299 
150 Samsung netbook use it for about a

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:18.570 
150 Samsung netbook use it for about a
week<00:00:16.480> week<00:00:17.320> ish<00:00:17.530> approximately<00:00:18.280> right<00:00:18.430> now

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:18.580 
week week ish approximately right now

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.779 
week week ish approximately right now
and<00:00:19.500> you<00:00:20.500> know<00:00:20.619> I<00:00:20.650> there's<00:00:21.130> some<00:00:21.340> positive

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:21.789 
and you know I there's some positive

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:23.160 
and you know I there's some positive
things<00:00:21.939> about<00:00:22.029> it<00:00:22.330> but<00:00:22.510> there's<00:00:22.689> certainly

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:23.170 
things about it but there's certainly

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:25.919 
things about it but there's certainly
some<00:00:23.500> negatives<00:00:24.240> that<00:00:25.240> I'm<00:00:25.359> going<00:00:25.509> to<00:00:25.539> go<00:00:25.660> into

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:25.929 
some negatives that I'm going to go into

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:27.599 
some negatives that I'm going to go into
a<00:00:25.960> little<00:00:26.109> bit<00:00:26.320> more<00:00:26.349> but<00:00:27.160> I'm<00:00:27.369> trying

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:27.609 
a little bit more but I'm trying

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:28.679 
a little bit more but I'm trying
something<00:00:27.730> new<00:00:27.880> also<00:00:28.179> with<00:00:28.300> this<00:00:28.390> video<00:00:28.599> I'm

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:28.689 
something new also with this video I'm

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:30.269 
something new also with this video I'm
going<00:00:28.779> to<00:00:28.869> make<00:00:28.960> it<00:00:29.080> as<00:00:29.170> fast<00:00:29.410> as<00:00:29.710> possible<00:00:30.250> so

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:30.279 
going to make it as fast as possible so

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:31.890 
going to make it as fast as possible so
this<00:00:30.550> doesn't<00:00:30.789> go<00:00:31.000> beyond<00:00:31.300> maybe<00:00:31.509> two<00:00:31.779> or

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:31.900 
this doesn't go beyond maybe two or

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:32.519 
this doesn't go beyond maybe two or
three<00:00:32.080> minutes

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:32.529 
three minutes

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:35.360 
three minutes
so<00:00:32.950> essentially<00:00:33.550> keyboard<00:00:34.540> guys<00:00:34.780> is

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
so essentially keyboard guys is

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.470 
so essentially keyboard guys is
fantastic<00:00:36.370> I<00:00:36.520> love<00:00:36.670> using<00:00:36.879> this<00:00:37.090> keyboard

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:37.480 
fantastic I love using this keyboard

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.080 
fantastic I love using this keyboard
very<00:00:37.989> similar<00:00:38.559> to<00:00:38.860> chiclet<00:00:39.370> keyboard<00:00:39.700> except

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:40.090 
very similar to chiclet keyboard except

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:41.279 
very similar to chiclet keyboard except
it's<00:00:40.270> not

00:00:41.279 --> 00:00:41.289 
it's not

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:42.660 
it's not
I<00:00:41.320> guess<00:00:41.559> there's<00:00:42.039> the<00:00:42.129> only<00:00:42.280> way<00:00:42.430> to<00:00:42.489> explain

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.670 
I guess there's the only way to explain

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.369 
I guess there's the only way to explain
it<00:00:43.030> is<00:00:43.120> it's<00:00:43.329> essentially<00:00:43.930> like<00:00:44.050> a<00:00:44.079> normal

00:00:44.369 --> 00:00:44.379 
it is it's essentially like a normal

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:46.650 
it is it's essentially like a normal
keyboard<00:00:44.530> but<00:00:44.980> the<00:00:45.100> keys<00:00:45.280> are<00:00:45.460> got<00:00:46.149> this<00:00:46.270> bevel

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:46.660 
keyboard but the keys are got this bevel

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.349 
keyboard but the keys are got this bevel
feels<00:00:47.110> great<00:00:47.379> to<00:00:47.559> type<00:00:47.739> on<00:00:47.920> the<00:00:48.489> touchpad<00:00:48.760> and

00:00:49.349 --> 00:00:49.359 
feels great to type on the touchpad and

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:51.569 
feels great to type on the touchpad and
the<00:00:49.960> left<00:00:50.260> and<00:00:50.440> right<00:00:50.559> click<00:00:50.770> are<00:00:50.920> fantastic

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:51.579 
the left and right click are fantastic

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:54.270 
the left and right click are fantastic
there<00:00:52.510> may<00:00:52.690> in<00:00:52.840> limited<00:00:53.289> few<00:00:53.559> sensitivity

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.280 
there may in limited few sensitivity

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.340 
there may in limited few sensitivity
issues<00:00:54.670> but<00:00:55.420> I<00:00:55.449> think<00:00:55.510> that<00:00:55.780> was<00:00:55.899> cleared<00:00:56.199> up

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 
issues but I think that was cleared up

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.020 
issues but I think that was cleared up
after<00:00:56.859> you<00:00:57.399> know<00:00:57.489> I<00:00:57.550> think<00:00:57.670> there<00:00:57.820> was<00:00:57.940> some

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
after you know I think there was some

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:59.790 
after you know I think there was some
dust<00:00:58.239> particles<00:00:58.750> or<00:00:58.899> something<00:00:59.289> that<00:00:59.559> you

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800 
dust particles or something that you

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.799 
dust particles or something that you
know<00:00:59.920> the<00:01:00.039> sensitivity<00:01:00.579> was<00:01:00.730> messing<00:01:01.480> up<00:01:01.600> on

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:01.809 
know the sensitivity was messing up on

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:03.720 
know the sensitivity was messing up on
but<00:01:02.050> not<00:01:02.350> quite<00:01:02.649> sure<00:01:02.679> there<00:01:03.070> but<00:01:03.399> might<00:01:03.699> be

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730 
but not quite sure there but might be

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.940 
but not quite sure there but might be
just<00:01:04.000> the<00:01:04.059> model<00:01:04.360> I<00:01:04.420> got<00:01:04.629> or<00:01:05.290> the<00:01:05.530> version<00:01:05.860> I

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:05.950 
just the model I got or the version I

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.300 
just the model I got or the version I
got<00:01:06.810> battery<00:01:07.810> life<00:01:07.990> is<00:01:08.200> also<00:01:08.530> fantastic<00:01:08.740> it

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
got battery life is also fantastic it

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.850 
got battery life is also fantastic it
lasted<00:01:09.759> I<00:01:09.880> think<00:01:10.150> around<00:01:10.930> six<00:01:11.200> and<00:01:11.320> a<00:01:11.439> half<00:01:11.470> to

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
lasted I think around six and a half to

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.800 
lasted I think around six and a half to
seven<00:01:12.100> hours<00:01:12.400> with<00:01:12.790> my<00:01:12.970> normal<00:01:13.030> use<00:01:13.570> of

you can check my other video for the

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.789 
you can check my other video for the
specs<00:01:21.220> but<00:01:21.670> the<00:01:21.909> n450<00:01:22.689> processor<00:01:23.439> is<00:01:23.530> great

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:23.799 
specs but the n450 processor is great

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:25.710 
specs but the n450 processor is great
the<00:01:24.579> only<00:01:24.670> thing<00:01:24.909> that<00:01:25.060> doesn't<00:01:25.240> perform<00:01:25.600> well

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 
the only thing that doesn't perform well

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.140 
the only thing that doesn't perform well
is<00:01:26.020> of<00:01:26.170> course<00:01:26.409> HD<00:01:26.950> movie<00:01:27.220> is<00:01:27.310> so<00:01:27.549> really<00:01:27.909> in

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
say about this netbook it's probably one

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:15.960 
say about this netbook it's probably one
of<00:02:14.680> the<00:02:14.830> worst<00:02:15.160> that<00:02:15.400> I've<00:02:15.550> seen

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
of the worst that I've seen

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.660 
of the worst that I've seen
experiences<00:02:16.390> is<00:02:16.540> the<00:02:16.600> amount<00:02:17.020> of<00:02:17.170> bloatware

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
experiences is the amount of bloatware

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.820 
experiences is the amount of bloatware
that's<00:02:18.670> installed<00:02:19.000> in<00:02:19.240> the<00:02:19.360> Samsung<00:02:19.870> it<00:02:20.590> took

that's installed in the Samsung it took

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.100 
that's installed in the Samsung it took
approximately<00:02:21.210> 25<00:02:22.210> minutes<00:02:22.420> to<00:02:22.720> start<00:02:22.930> this

approximately 25 minutes to start this
up<00:02:23.320> and<00:02:23.530> I<00:02:23.710> was<00:02:23.890> directly<00:02:24.370> plugged<00:02:24.670> into<00:02:24.790> an<00:02:25.000> AC

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.670 
changing issues it was selected and it
just<00:02:30.400> was<00:02:31.150> running<00:02:31.600> and<00:02:31.780> installing<00:02:32.440> and

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
just was running and installing and

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.130 
just was running and installing and
first<00:02:33.400> time<00:02:33.640> start<00:02:33.910> abused<00:02:34.180> took<00:02:34.420> about<00:02:34.570> 20-25

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
first time start abused took about 20-25

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.010 
first time start abused took about 20-25
minutes<00:02:35.700> after<00:02:36.700> that<00:02:36.910> it<00:02:37.150> restarted<00:02:37.660> several

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
minutes after that it restarted several

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.350 
minutes after that it restarted several
times<00:02:38.260> because<00:02:38.500> of<00:02:38.710> this<00:02:38.920> weird<00:02:39.280> Sam<00:02:40.000> sound

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
times because of this weird Sam sound

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.870 
times because of this weird Sam sound
like<00:02:40.540> update<00:02:41.050> hard<00:02:41.710> drive<00:02:42.040> back<00:02:42.400> up

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
like update hard drive back up

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.360 
like update hard drive back up
also<00:02:43.660> it<00:02:43.900> partitioned<00:02:44.650> the<00:02:44.740> harddrive<00:02:45.100> into

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
also it partitioned the harddrive into

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.960 
also it partitioned the harddrive into
two<00:02:46.500> two<00:02:47.500> hard<00:02:47.860> drives<00:02:48.040> a<00:02:48.310> virtual<00:02:48.610> hard<00:02:48.760> drive

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
two two hard drives a virtual hard drive

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.760 
two two hard drives a virtual hard drive
so<00:02:49.300> it's<00:02:49.570> segmented<00:02:50.140> the<00:02:50.230> hard<00:02:50.380> drive<00:02:50.560> into

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
so it's segmented the hard drive into

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.920 
so it's segmented the hard drive into
two<00:02:50.950> not<00:02:51.670> sure<00:02:51.970> what<00:02:52.120> was<00:02:52.270> there<00:02:52.480> but<00:02:52.660> I<00:02:52.720> think

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
two not sure what was there but I think

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.030 
two not sure what was there but I think
it<00:02:53.020> had<00:02:53.110> something<00:02:53.320> to<00:02:53.440> do<00:02:53.500> with<00:02:53.530> like<00:02:53.740> backup

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
it had something to do with like backup

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.640 
it had something to do with like backup
or<00:02:54.520> something<00:02:54.790> like<00:02:54.850> that<00:02:54.940> but<00:02:55.270> not<00:02:56.170> a<00:02:56.230> big<00:02:56.470> fan

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
or something like that but not a big fan

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:57.870 
or something like that but not a big fan
of<00:02:56.680> that<00:02:56.830> the<00:02:57.040> amount<00:02:57.280> of<00:02:57.310> bloatware<00:02:57.520> that<00:02:57.790> was

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
of that the amount of bloatware that was

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.360 
of that the amount of bloatware that was
installed<00:02:58.209> on<00:02:58.330> this<00:02:58.510> the<00:02:58.840> both<00:02:59.530> the<00:02:59.709> 210<00:03:00.130> and

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
installed on this the both the 210 and

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.900 
installed on this the both the 210 and
the<00:03:00.610> eight<00:03:00.760> asus<00:03:01.270> epc<00:03:02.370> started<00:03:03.370> up<00:03:03.490> much

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
the eight asus epc started up much

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.210 
the eight asus epc started up much
faster<00:03:04.390> than<00:03:04.510> this<00:03:04.660> one<00:03:04.959> after<00:03:05.800> everything

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
faster than this one after everything

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.340 
faster than this one after everything
had<00:03:06.400> been<00:03:06.490> installed<00:03:06.880> yes<00:03:07.720> it<00:03:07.959> starts<00:03:08.230> up

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
had been installed yes it starts up

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.140 
had been installed yes it starts up
pretty<00:03:08.530> good<00:03:08.740> but<00:03:09.040> that<00:03:09.280> initial<00:03:09.459> start<00:03:09.910> up<00:03:10.000> in

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
pretty good but that initial start up in

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.000 
pretty good but that initial start up in
the<00:03:10.209> amount<00:03:10.450> of<00:03:10.540> icons<00:03:11.080> and<00:03:11.410> bloatware<00:03:11.800> that<00:03:11.980> I

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
the amount of icons and bloatware that I

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.370 
the amount of icons and bloatware that I
saw<00:03:12.220> installed<00:03:12.580> on<00:03:12.730> this<00:03:12.880> was<00:03:13.510> ridiculous<00:03:14.080> so

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
saw installed on this was ridiculous so

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.850 
saw installed on this was ridiculous so
I<00:03:15.090> don't<00:03:16.090> know<00:03:16.150> the<00:03:16.390> I<00:03:16.690> would<00:03:17.050> say<00:03:17.080> this<00:03:17.650> is<00:03:17.830> a

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
I don't know the I would say this is a

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.750 
I don't know the I would say this is a
great<00:03:18.100> netbook<00:03:18.550> if<00:03:18.760> you<00:03:19.060> erase<00:03:19.660> the<00:03:19.690> drive<00:03:20.140> and

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
great netbook if you erase the drive and

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.640 
great netbook if you erase the drive and
installed<00:03:21.760> a<00:03:22.030> fresh<00:03:22.360> operating<00:03:22.900> system<00:03:23.290> with

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
installed a fresh operating system with

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.350 
installed a fresh operating system with
nothing<00:03:23.950> installed<00:03:24.280> but<00:03:24.820> I'm<00:03:24.910> going<00:03:25.209> to<00:03:25.269> say

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
nothing installed but I'm going to say

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.110 
nothing installed but I'm going to say
that<00:03:25.540> with<00:03:25.660> any<00:03:25.750> netbook<00:03:26.190> but<00:03:27.190> if<00:03:27.400> you<00:03:28.000> go

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
that with any netbook but if you go

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.270 
that with any netbook but if you go
stock<00:03:28.500> probably<00:03:29.500> not<00:03:29.650> the<00:03:29.800> one<00:03:29.950> you<00:03:30.040> want<00:03:30.220> to

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
stock probably not the one you want to

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.250 
stock probably not the one you want to
go<00:03:30.430> with<00:03:30.640> at<00:03:31.269> least<00:03:31.540> with<00:03:31.810> regard<00:03:32.110> to<00:03:32.170> the

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
go with at least with regard to the

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:33.449 
go with at least with regard to the
amount<00:03:32.380> of<00:03:32.470> bloatware<00:03:32.709> that's<00:03:32.980> installed<00:03:33.280> on

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
amount of bloatware that's installed on

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:36.050 
amount of bloatware that's installed on
this<00:03:33.640> but<00:03:34.630> all<00:03:34.810> in<00:03:34.959> all<00:03:35.080> physically

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
this but all in all physically

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.360 
this but all in all physically
durability<00:03:37.060> it's<00:03:37.480> great<00:03:37.810> for<00:03:38.019> this<00:03:38.140> n1<00:03:38.470> 50<00:03:38.860> but

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
durability it's great for this n1 50 but

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.280 
durability it's great for this n1 50 but
yeah<00:03:39.489> the<00:03:39.640> bloatware<00:03:39.850> was<00:03:40.120> a<00:03:40.150> big<00:03:40.570> weakness<00:03:40.900> at

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
yeah the bloatware was a big weakness at

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.400 
yeah the bloatware was a big weakness at
least<00:03:41.500> a<00:03:41.680> nitpick<00:03:42.250> of<00:03:42.400> mine<00:03:42.580> so<00:03:42.910> I<00:03:43.410> can't

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
least a nitpick of mine so I can't

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.620
