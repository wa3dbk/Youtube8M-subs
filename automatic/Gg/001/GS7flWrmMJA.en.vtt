know that I'm gonna be heating the milk
and<00:02:25.010> frothing<00:02:25.640> it<00:02:25.939> at<00:02:26.060> the

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
and frothing it at the

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.900 
and frothing it at the
time<00:02:26.960> now<00:02:27.410> speaking<00:02:27.680> of<00:02:27.890> frothing<00:02:28.190> I<00:02:28.580> have<00:02:28.760> my

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
time now speaking of frothing I have my

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.940 
time now speaking of frothing I have my
choice<00:02:29.120> of<00:02:29.300> two<00:02:29.570> different<00:02:29.600> frothing<00:02:30.380> whisks

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
choice of two different frothing whisks

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.910 
choice of two different frothing whisks
I'm<00:02:31.220> gonna<00:02:31.880> probably<00:02:32.390> use<00:02:32.960> this<00:02:33.260> one<00:02:33.530> most

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
I'm gonna probably use this one most

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.160 
I'm gonna probably use this one most
often<00:02:34.220> this<00:02:34.550> is<00:02:34.730> the<00:02:34.850> frothing<00:02:35.150> whisk<00:02:35.630> and

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
often this is the frothing whisk and

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.630 
often this is the frothing whisk and
this<00:02:36.290> one<00:02:36.440> of<00:02:36.530> course<00:02:36.560> looks<00:02:36.980> kind<00:02:37.370> of<00:02:37.460> like

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
this one of course looks kind of like

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.430 
this one of course looks kind of like
other<00:02:37.820> frothing<00:02:38.300> whisks<00:02:38.660> that<00:02:38.720> I<00:02:38.900> have<00:02:39.140> found

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
other frothing whisks that I have found

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.230 
other frothing whisks that I have found
with<00:02:39.830> other<00:02:40.100> milk<00:02:40.700> frothers

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:41.240 
with other milk frothers

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.110 
with other milk frothers
then<00:02:41.990> I<00:02:42.020> have<00:02:42.410> attached<00:02:42.800> to<00:02:43.070> the<00:02:43.160> lid<00:02:43.700> my<00:02:43.880> other

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
then I have attached to the lid my other

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.210 
then I have attached to the lid my other
frothing<00:02:44.810> whisk<00:02:45.050> which<00:02:45.350> just<00:02:45.560> pops<00:02:45.770> right<00:02:45.920> off

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
frothing whisk which just pops right off

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.190 
frothing whisk which just pops right off
this<00:02:46.490> one's<00:02:46.700> real<00:02:46.910> small<00:02:47.180> this<00:02:47.690> one<00:02:47.900> is<00:02:48.020> just

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
this one's real small this one is just

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.500 
this one's real small this one is just
for<00:02:48.410> simply<00:02:48.740> basically<00:02:49.370> stirring<00:02:49.940> your<00:02:50.240> milk

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
for simply basically stirring your milk

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:51.670 
for simply basically stirring your milk
so<00:02:50.720> maybe<00:02:50.900> if<00:02:51.080> you<00:02:51.200> were<00:02:51.350> doing<00:02:51.500> something

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
so maybe if you were doing something

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.890 
so maybe if you were doing something
flavored<00:02:52.640> and<00:02:52.940> you<00:02:53.120> didn't<00:02:53.360> really<00:02:53.540> need<00:02:53.720> as

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
flavored and you didn't really need as

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.600 
flavored and you didn't really need as
much<00:02:54.050> foam<00:02:54.380> you<00:02:54.950> would<00:02:55.100> go<00:02:55.190> ahead<00:02:55.340> and<00:02:55.490> use

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
much foam you would go ahead and use

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.000 
much foam you would go ahead and use
that<00:02:55.640> one<00:02:55.880> really<00:02:56.480> good<00:02:56.750> for<00:02:56.960> a<00:02:56.990> cold<00:02:57.260> stir<00:02:57.710> as

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
that one really good for a cold stir as

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.030 
that one really good for a cold stir as
well<00:02:58.450> but<00:02:59.450> today<00:02:59.570> as<00:02:59.990> I<00:03:00.410> say<00:03:00.590> I'm<00:03:00.710> gonna<00:03:00.800> go

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
well but today as I say I'm gonna go

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.860 
well but today as I say I'm gonna go
ahead<00:03:01.100> and<00:03:01.310> make<00:03:01.400> a<00:03:01.430> quick<00:03:01.640> cappuccino<00:03:02.330> so

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
ahead and make a quick cappuccino so

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.300 
ahead and make a quick cappuccino so
we're<00:03:03.050> going<00:03:03.200> to<00:03:03.320> make<00:03:03.530> use<00:03:03.770> of<00:03:03.800> the<00:03:04.040> frothing

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
we're going to make use of the frothing

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.520 
we're going to make use of the frothing
whisk<00:03:04.730> now<00:03:05.000> inside<00:03:05.780> of<00:03:05.840> the<00:03:06.110> unit<00:03:06.440> you're

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
whisk now inside of the unit you're

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.310 
whisk now inside of the unit you're
going<00:03:06.860> to<00:03:07.010> find<00:03:07.310> a<00:03:07.670> couple<00:03:08.330> of<00:03:08.540> hash<00:03:08.810> marks

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
going to find a couple of hash marks

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.050 
going to find a couple of hash marks
those<00:03:09.830> are<00:03:09.980> gonna<00:03:10.070> look<00:03:10.340> just<00:03:10.400> like<00:03:10.880> the

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
those are gonna look just like the

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.580 
those are gonna look just like the
frothing<00:03:11.300> whisks<00:03:12.200> they're<00:03:12.350> gonna<00:03:12.440> have

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
frothing whisks they're gonna have
