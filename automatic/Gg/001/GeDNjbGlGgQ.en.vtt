00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:18.039 
should work now you can see here if I

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:25.410 
should work now you can see here if I
just<00:00:18.220> do<00:00:18.310> a<00:00:18.340> quick<00:00:18.640> test<00:00:23.850> that's<00:00:24.850> meant<00:00:25.150> to<00:00:25.210> say

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:25.420 
just do a quick test that's meant to say

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.689 
just do a quick test that's meant to say
works<00:00:25.720> I<00:00:26.080> have<00:00:26.949> the<00:00:27.100> tripod<00:00:27.460> you<00:00:27.490> know<00:00:27.609> the

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:27.699 
works I have the tripod you know the

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:29.160 
works I have the tripod you know the
cameras<00:00:28.060> that's<00:00:28.240> very<00:00:28.449> hard<00:00:28.690> to<00:00:28.810> write<00:00:28.930> here

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:29.170 
cameras that's very hard to write here

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:31.529 
cameras that's very hard to write here
but<00:00:29.350> it<00:00:29.529> does<00:00:29.770> actually<00:00:30.010> work<00:00:30.400> and<00:00:30.699> you<00:00:31.090> to<00:00:31.270> get

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:31.539 
but it does actually work and you to get

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:34.380 
but it does actually work and you to get
that<00:00:31.890> different<00:00:32.890> levels<00:00:33.460> there<00:00:33.670> are<00:00:33.699> pressure

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:34.390 
that different levels there are pressure

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.619 
that different levels there are pressure
sensitivity<00:00:35.399> depending<00:00:36.399> on<00:00:36.550> how<00:00:36.879> hard<00:00:37.300> you

00:00:37.619 --> 00:00:37.629 
sensitivity depending on how hard you

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:39.959 
sensitivity depending on how hard you
push<00:00:37.929> down<00:00:38.379> on<00:00:38.409> the<00:00:38.710> screen<00:00:39.100> what<00:00:39.699> I<00:00:39.729> have

00:00:39.959 --> 00:00:39.969 
push down on the screen what I have

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:42.299 
push down on the screen what I have
noticed<00:00:40.239> though<00:00:40.690> is<00:00:40.899> that<00:00:40.960> sometimes<00:00:41.679> without

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:42.309 
noticed though is that sometimes without

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:44.459 
noticed though is that sometimes without
the<00:00:42.609> actual<00:00:42.999> tip<00:00:43.329> of<00:00:43.510> the<00:00:43.659> pen<00:00:43.839> touching<00:00:44.379> the

00:00:44.459 --> 00:00:44.469 
the actual tip of the pen touching the

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:46.619 
the actual tip of the pen touching the
screen<00:00:44.829> there<00:00:45.429> will<00:00:45.579> sometimes<00:00:46.179> it<00:00:46.479> will

00:00:46.619 --> 00:00:46.629 
screen there will sometimes it will

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:48.509 
screen there will sometimes it will
start<00:00:46.960> to<00:00:47.170> right<00:00:47.469> there<00:00:47.739> you<00:00:47.859> can<00:00:48.039> see<00:00:48.219> it<00:00:48.309> just

00:00:48.509 --> 00:00:48.519 
start to right there you can see it just

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:51.629 
start to right there you can see it just
sometimes<00:00:48.909> happening<00:00:49.389> and<00:00:50.159> I'm<00:00:51.159> not<00:00:51.519> really

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:51.639 
sometimes happening and I'm not really

00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:53.699 
sometimes happening and I'm not really
sure<00:00:51.760> what<00:00:52.059> is<00:00:52.209> causing<00:00:52.629> that<00:00:52.709> probably

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:53.709 
sure what is causing that probably

00:00:53.709 --> 00:00:55.979 
sure what is causing that probably
because<00:00:53.979> maybe<00:00:54.190> this<00:00:54.639> stylus<00:00:55.120> isn't<00:00:55.539> really

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
because maybe this stylus isn't really

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:58.619 
because maybe this stylus isn't really
made<00:00:56.829> for<00:00:57.190> this<00:00:57.399> screen<00:00:57.940> so<00:00:58.149> you<00:00:58.209> have<00:00:58.329> to<00:00:58.420> bear

00:00:58.619 --> 00:00:58.629 
made for this screen so you have to bear

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:00.959 
made for this screen so you have to bear
that<00:00:58.749> in<00:00:58.809> mind<00:00:58.899> that<00:00:59.319> if<00:00:59.469> you<00:00:59.619> are<00:00:59.969> perhaps

00:01:00.959 --> 00:01:00.969 
that in mind that if you are perhaps

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:03.449 
that in mind that if you are perhaps
writing<00:01:01.899> something<00:01:02.289> you<00:01:02.469> might<00:01:02.889> now<00:01:03.190> and<00:01:03.339> then

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:03.459 
writing something you might now and then

00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:06.210 
writing something you might now and then
get<00:01:03.789> that<00:01:04.540> happening<00:01:05.110> you<00:01:05.650> can<00:01:05.770> just<00:01:05.890> see<00:01:06.070> now

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 
get that happening you can just see now

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.700 
get that happening you can just see now
it's<00:01:06.490> right<00:01:07.420> there<00:01:07.600> that<00:01:07.870> it's<00:01:08.080> starting<00:01:08.680> to

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710 
it's right there that it's starting to

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.590 
it's right there that it's starting to
draw<00:01:09.010> on<00:01:09.070> the<00:01:09.160> screen<00:01:09.460> without<00:01:09.640> me<00:01:09.970> wanting<00:01:10.510> it

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
draw on the screen without me wanting it

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.160 
draw on the screen without me wanting it
to<00:01:10.780> without<00:01:11.080> it<00:01:11.230> touching<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:13.000> you<00:01:13.120> do<00:01:13.300> you<00:01:14.050> do

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
to without it touching and you do you do

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.340 
to without it touching and you do you do
get<00:01:14.380> that<00:01:14.530> nice<00:01:14.740> kind<00:01:14.980> of<00:01:15.130> level<00:01:15.970> of<00:01:16.350> pressure

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
get that nice kind of level of pressure

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.640 
get that nice kind of level of pressure
sensitivity<00:01:18.010> there<00:01:18.370> and<00:01:18.940> of<00:01:19.420> course<00:01:19.650> without

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:20.650 
sensitivity there and of course without

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.830 
sensitivity there and of course without
the<00:01:20.830> pen<00:01:21.160> touching<00:01:21.550> the<00:01:21.640> screen<00:01:21.910> it<00:01:22.480> will<00:01:22.660> not

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
the pen touching the screen it will not

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.570 
the pen touching the screen it will not
write<00:01:23.050> anything<00:01:23.380> with<00:01:23.710> the<00:01:23.800> official<00:01:24.160> stylus

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 
write anything with the official stylus

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.940 
write anything with the official stylus
so<00:01:25.450> bear<00:01:25.840> that<00:01:25.870> in<00:01:26.140> mind<00:01:26.170> if<00:01:26.500> you're<00:01:26.680> going<00:01:26.860> to

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
so bear that in mind if you're going to

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.380 
so bear that in mind if you're going to
get<00:01:27.010> the<00:01:27.130> official<00:01:27.400> stylus<00:01:27.790> probably<00:01:28.270> be<00:01:28.360> a

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
get the official stylus probably be a

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:29.640 
get the official stylus probably be a
little<00:01:28.480> bit<00:01:28.600> better<00:01:28.810> because<00:01:28.990> this<00:01:29.230> is<00:01:29.470> the

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:29.650 
little bit better because this is the

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.910 
little bit better because this is the
one<00:01:29.830> that<00:01:30.040> cube<00:01:30.340> has<00:01:30.610> for<00:01:31.150> the<00:01:31.300> tablet<00:01:31.740> but<00:01:32.740> if

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
one that cube has for the tablet but if

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.590 
one that cube has for the tablet but if
you<00:01:33.190> didn't<00:01:33.580> have<00:01:33.640> the<00:01:33.760> stylus<00:01:34.090> with<00:01:34.270> you<00:01:34.480> or

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
you didn't have the stylus with you or

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.390 
you didn't have the stylus with you or
you're<00:01:34.750> waiting<00:01:34.930> for<00:01:35.110> one<00:01:35.470> or<00:01:35.740> you<00:01:35.860> lost<00:01:36.070> it

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:36.400 
you're waiting for one or you lost it

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.970 
you're waiting for one or you lost it
then<00:01:36.640> you<00:01:36.820> could<00:01:37.090> use<00:01:37.360> this<00:01:37.930> your<00:01:38.350> note<00:01:38.590> 4

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:38.980 
then you could use this your note 4

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.010 
then you could use this your note 4
stylus<00:01:39.550> there<00:01:39.760> but<00:01:40.000> you<00:01:40.510> know<00:01:40.630> you<00:01:40.690> might<00:01:40.870> have

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
stylus there but you know you might have

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:49.710 
stylus there but you know you might have
that<00:01:41.140> problem<00:01:47.010> that<00:01:48.010> works<00:01:49.000> just<00:01:49.420> fine

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
that problem that works just fine

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.940 
that problem that works just fine
there's<00:01:50.170> standard<00:01:50.530> one<00:01:50.740> and<00:01:52.680> I'm<00:01:53.680> just<00:01:53.800> doing

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
there's standard one and I'm just doing

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.340 
there's standard one and I'm just doing
out<00:01:54.130> a<00:01:54.159> quick<00:01:54.430> demonstration<00:01:55.240> here<00:01:56.020> that<00:01:56.229> how

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
out a quick demonstration here that how

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.460 
out a quick demonstration here that how
fast<00:01:56.710> it<00:01:56.920> is<00:01:57.040> when<00:01:57.940> you're<00:01:58.090> writing<00:01:58.330> at<00:01:58.870> least

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
fast it is when you're writing at least
