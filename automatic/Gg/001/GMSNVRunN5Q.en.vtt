00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:30.779
 you guessed it today 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.450
 talk about how to set up the back 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.770
 switch 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.150
 consider the main nuances of setting 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:41.489
 rear derailleur 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:44.460
 we have two screws high and low which 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.650
 adjusts the limiter and we have a nut 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.589
 the tension of the cable is enough for us 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:51.629
 to configure the switch first we 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:56.210
 switch to the rear of the smallest 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.210
 star on the front largest 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:12.380
 now we look like located 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:15.530
 rear switch rollers if they are not 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:19.100
 match up clearly with this star need 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:21.410
 pull the cable the smallest star 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.170
 should form a straight line with 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.340
 rear derailleur rollers for this 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.680
 we need to pull up 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.680
 or loosen the cable tensioner nut 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:38.270
 now we need to switch back to 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:53.120
 the largest and the foremost 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:55.280
 small as we see here a little cable 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:59.030
 drag over so we return it 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:09.429
 slightly backwards to not 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:12.560
 I flew myself on the spokes check perfectly 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:15.290
 if nevertheless chains jumps you 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.370
 knitting needles means you are poorly adjusted 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.739
 blocking stroke 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.830
 as I said on regulated 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:24.050
 cogs high and low hi this more 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.540
 the speed of the stars of the words is more 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.930
 the slowest part of the stars 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:33.920
 when we spin the screw hi 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:35.970
 so we move the switch further 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.180
 from the star 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:41.570
 so we need his glory so that the chain does not 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:45.810
 downloaded in the wrong direction if we 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:48.120
 spin the cog low here already 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.640
 the opposite order is obtained if 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.830
 we spin it that color doesn't go on 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.770
 needles if we unscrew his patient 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:03:00.420
 still will go on the spokes so low 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:04.350
 we twist hi we loosen after 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:07.740
 how we set up our foot 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:10.800
 we switch the front transfer to 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:13.770
 second star and read nod watch 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:16.050
 how our stars work remember what 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:18.570
 on the second star you should work 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:21.420
 Fully full range of stars given 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:24.060
 the case here is their 7 well and let's go 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:28.040
 check switch to higher 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:31.040
 will say yes as you can see it is still bad 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.040
 switches 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.790
 back 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:49.349
 well still not perfect right now 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:53.870
 for example does not switch it means that 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:53.870
 need a little loosen rose 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:15.620
 try again now better but all 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:20.290
 Equally not perfect yet 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:20.290
 loosening about going further 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.750
 backwards 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:47.100
 almost perfectly still on the floor back 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:49.650
 I think it will be great fucking 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:52.770
 everything works fine bike same 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:55.170
 just breaks down and he leaves this 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:58.260
 I showed you the video how to configure 

00:04:55.170 --> 00:05:01.470
 switch from scratch for those who 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:04.200
 the switch has already been configured and the code 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:06.120
 locking paws has already been exposed these 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.640
 operations are not required 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:11.460
 just turn the nut 

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:14.730
 cable tensioner and you customize your 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:17.220
 switch for the same who replaced 

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:19.740
 switch either bought a bike in 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:26.550
 my video box fits perfectly 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:28.850
 because there are all the nuances 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:28.850
 until
