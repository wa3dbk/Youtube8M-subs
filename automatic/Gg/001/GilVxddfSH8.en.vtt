here<00:00:26.720> I'm<00:00:26.869> playing<00:00:27.110> it<00:00:27.320> for<00:00:27.529> a<00:00:27.560> little<00:00:27.770> bit<00:00:27.860> and

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:28.400 
here I'm playing it for a little bit and

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.420 
here I'm playing it for a little bit and
basically<00:00:29.150> it's<00:00:29.570> not<00:00:29.869> mod<00:00:30.349> it's<00:00:30.830> not<00:00:31.130> a<00:00:31.160> new

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:31.430 
basically it's not mod it's not a new

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.299 
basically it's not mod it's not a new
game<00:00:31.730> mode<00:00:32.000> it's<00:00:32.300> just<00:00:32.540> a<00:00:32.720> server<00:00:33.309> plugin

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:34.309 
game mode it's just a server plugin

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:37.270 
game mode it's just a server plugin
basically<00:00:34.910> and<00:00:35.180> what<00:00:35.780> it<00:00:35.900> does<00:00:36.050> is<00:00:36.440> it<00:00:36.470> sort<00:00:37.190> of

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
basically and what it does is it sort of

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.610 
basically and what it does is it sort of
changes<00:00:37.340> I<00:00:38.000> guess<00:00:38.210> some<00:00:38.930> of<00:00:38.960> the<00:00:39.140> rules<00:00:39.440> that

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
changes I guess some of the rules that

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.890 
changes I guess some of the rules that
you<00:00:39.860> would<00:00:40.010> have<00:00:40.190> in<00:00:40.580> a<00:00:41.030> regular<00:00:41.660> team

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:41.900 
you would have in a regular team

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.750 
you would have in a regular team
deathmatch<00:00:42.379> the<00:00:42.739> player<00:00:42.980> models<00:00:43.400> haven't

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
deathmatch the player models haven't

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.299 
deathmatch the player models haven't
changed<00:00:44.210> nothing's<00:00:44.600> really<00:00:44.780> changed<00:00:45.309> only

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:46.309 
changed nothing's really changed only

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:47.680 
changed nothing's really changed only
some<00:00:46.519> of<00:00:46.549> the<00:00:46.670> rules<00:00:46.850> like<00:00:47.120> you<00:00:47.180> can't<00:00:47.510> use

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
some of the rules like you can't use

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.539 
some of the rules like you can't use
certain<00:00:48.019> weapons<00:00:48.199> when<00:00:48.559> your<00:00:48.680> zombie<00:00:49.159> Claire

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:49.549 
certain weapons when your zombie Claire

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:50.890 
certain weapons when your zombie Claire
models<00:00:49.940> are<00:00:50.030> the<00:00:50.120> same<00:00:50.330> it's<00:00:50.600> just<00:00:50.659> pretty

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:50.900 
models are the same it's just pretty

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.750 
models are the same it's just pretty
much<00:00:51.049> people<00:00:51.379> that<00:00:51.830> are<00:00:51.979> zombies<00:00:52.460> that<00:00:52.699> are

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
much people that are zombies that are

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.280 
much people that are zombies that are
running<00:00:53.180> around<00:00:53.269> with<00:00:53.540> knives<00:00:53.780> or<00:00:54.110> power

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:54.290 
running around with knives or power

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.560 
running around with knives or power
tools<00:00:54.650> and<00:00:55.010> I<00:00:55.400> think<00:00:55.460> the<00:00:55.729> fibularis<00:00:55.970> as<00:00:56.360> well

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
tools and I think the fibularis as well

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.320 
tools and I think the fibularis as well
and<00:00:56.869> from<00:00:57.379> my<00:00:57.530> experience<00:00:57.559> so<00:00:58.280> far<00:00:58.309> it's<00:00:58.940> the

00:00:59.320 --> 00:00:59.330 
and from my experience so far it's the

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.600 
and from my experience so far it's the
game<00:00:59.510> modes<00:00:59.750> okay<00:01:00.320> and<00:01:00.949> in<00:01:01.250> a<00:01:01.369> game<00:01:01.580> like

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:01.610 
game modes okay and in a game like

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.570 
game modes okay and in a game like
Battlefield<00:01:02.570> it's<00:01:02.869> really<00:01:03.260> hard<00:01:03.530> to<00:01:03.860> make

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
Battlefield it's really hard to make

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.580 
Battlefield it's really hard to make
something<00:01:04.909> like<00:01:05.150> this<00:01:05.210> work<00:01:05.659> i<00:01:05.930> remember<00:01:06.409> in

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
something like this work i remember in

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.620 
something like this work i remember in
call<00:01:06.860> duty<00:01:07.100> they<00:01:07.340> had<00:01:07.490> a<00:01:07.729> game<00:01:08.000> mode<00:01:08.240> call

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
call duty they had a game mode call

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.780 
call duty they had a game mode call
infection<00:01:09.200> I<00:01:09.380> believe<00:01:09.650> I'm<00:01:09.770> mono<00:01:09.950> warfare<00:01:10.280> 3<00:01:10.549> a

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
infection I believe I'm mono warfare 3 a

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.300 
infection I believe I'm mono warfare 3 a
lot<00:01:11.240> like<00:01:11.450> this<00:01:11.750> and<00:01:12.110> essentially<00:01:12.920> it's<00:01:13.040> kind

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
lot like this and essentially it's kind

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.039 
lot like this and essentially it's kind
of<00:01:13.369> the<00:01:13.460> same<00:01:13.640> thing<00:01:13.700> when<00:01:14.630> players<00:01:14.900> were

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:15.049 
of the same thing when players were

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:17.080 
of the same thing when players were
infected<00:01:15.409> they<00:01:15.710> would<00:01:15.860> have<00:01:16.040> knives<00:01:16.580> and<00:01:17.030> they

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
infected they would have knives and they

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.609 
infected they would have knives and they
have<00:01:17.270> to<00:01:17.390> go<00:01:17.479> kill<00:01:17.720> other<00:01:17.869> players<00:01:18.080> except

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
have to go kill other players except

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:21.279 
have to go kill other players except
since<00:01:19.340> this<00:01:19.460> is<00:01:19.520> a<00:01:19.700> sort<00:01:20.060> of<00:01:20.119> server<00:01:20.509> plugin<00:01:21.049> it

00:01:21.279 --> 00:01:21.289 
since this is a sort of server plugin it

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:23.859 
since this is a sort of server plugin it
isn't<00:01:21.740> perfect<00:01:21.950> and<00:01:22.539> since<00:01:23.539> this<00:01:23.659> is<00:01:23.840> a

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869 
isn't perfect and since this is a

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:26.410 
isn't perfect and since this is a
battlefield<00:01:24.259> game<00:01:24.770> there's<00:01:25.340> lots<00:01:25.939> of<00:01:26.090> hiding

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
battlefield game there's lots of hiding

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:27.819 
battlefield game there's lots of hiding
places<00:01:26.659> for<00:01:26.840> the<00:01:27.049> zombies<00:01:27.409> pretty<00:01:27.649> much<00:01:27.799> a

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:27.829 
places for the zombies pretty much a

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:30.580 
places for the zombies pretty much a
typical<00:01:28.640> match<00:01:28.820> consists<00:01:29.479> of<00:01:29.570> everyone<00:01:30.320> on

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
typical match consists of everyone on

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.569 
typical match consists of everyone on
the<00:01:30.799> enemy<00:01:30.950> team<00:01:31.130> or<00:01:31.820> the<00:01:32.289> humans<00:01:33.289> I<00:01:33.649> guess<00:01:33.890> sa

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:34.579 
the enemy team or the humans I guess sa

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:37.690 
the enemy team or the humans I guess sa
camping<00:01:35.210> with<00:01:35.359> an<00:01:35.479> m60<00:01:36.200> on<00:01:36.499> top<00:01:36.829> of<00:01:37.039> a<00:01:37.310> hill<00:01:37.640> or

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
camping with an m60 on top of a hill or

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.359 
camping with an m60 on top of a hill or
you<00:01:38.539> know<00:01:38.659> some<00:01:38.990> place<00:01:39.170> that<00:01:39.350> you<00:01:39.439> can<00:01:39.679> get<00:01:40.039> and

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
you know some place that you can get and

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:41.770 
you know some place that you can get and
so<00:01:40.549> the<00:01:40.700> zombies<00:01:41.030> are<00:01:41.060> just<00:01:41.179> kind<00:01:41.390> of<00:01:41.479> dying

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
so the zombies are just kind of dying

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.679 
so the zombies are just kind of dying
dying<00:01:42.109> constantly<00:01:42.740> and<00:01:43.159> the<00:01:43.759> gay<00:01:43.880> men<00:01:44.090> usually

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:44.689 
dying constantly and the gay men usually

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:46.779 
dying constantly and the gay men usually
ends<00:01:45.439> up<00:01:45.499> with<00:01:45.679> the<00:01:45.770> humans<00:01:46.100> winning<00:01:46.460> I've

00:01:46.779 --> 00:01:46.789 
ends up with the humans winning I've

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:48.999 
ends up with the humans winning I've
seen<00:01:47.179> very<00:01:47.600> few<00:01:47.659> matches<00:01:47.990> so<00:01:48.380> far<00:01:48.409> where<00:01:48.859> the

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:12.740 
was just kind of like you could get on

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:14.199 
was just kind of like you could get on
those<00:03:12.980> servers<00:03:13.250> where<00:03:13.640> everyone's<00:03:14.000> actually

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
those servers where everyone's actually

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:15.520 
those servers where everyone's actually
playing<00:03:14.600> how<00:03:14.720> they're<00:03:14.900> supposed<00:03:14.990> to<00:03:15.230> and<00:03:15.350> it

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
could be a little bit of fun but usually

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.020 
could be a little bit of fun but usually
everyone's<00:03:18.170> exploiting<00:03:18.890> every<00:03:19.310> possible

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
everyone's exploiting every possible

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.240 
everyone's exploiting every possible
cheap<00:03:20.450> maneuver<00:03:21.080> in<00:03:21.200> the<00:03:21.290> book<00:03:21.530> like<00:03:21.800> a<00:03:21.830> lot<00:03:22.130> of

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
cheap maneuver in the book like a lot of

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.430 
cheap maneuver in the book like a lot of
times<00:03:22.489> you'll<00:03:22.700> see<00:03:22.730> players<00:03:23.600> camping<00:03:24.200> and

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
times you'll see players camping and

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:25.690 
times you'll see players camping and
then<00:03:24.530> as<00:03:24.680> soon<00:03:24.800> as<00:03:24.890> the<00:03:24.980> zombies<00:03:25.280> get<00:03:25.459> close

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
then as soon as the zombies get close

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:26.920 
then as soon as the zombies get close
they'll<00:03:25.970> kill<00:03:26.180> themselves<00:03:26.570> and<00:03:26.810> they'll

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
they'll kill themselves and they'll

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.930 
they'll kill themselves and they'll
respond<00:03:27.320> experiments<00:03:27.830> which<00:03:27.980> should<00:03:28.790> be

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
respond experiments which should be

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.570 
respond experiments which should be
fixed<00:03:29.330> hopefully<00:03:30.260> but<00:03:30.650> in<00:03:30.890> a<00:03:30.980> game<00:03:31.130> mode<00:03:31.370> where

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:31.580 
fixed hopefully but in a game mode where

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.160 
fixed hopefully but in a game mode where
people<00:03:31.850> are<00:03:31.970> exploding<00:03:32.360> things<00:03:32.630> like<00:03:32.840> that<00:03:32.989> it

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
people are exploding things like that it

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.080 
people are exploding things like that it
usually<00:03:33.200> doesn't<00:03:34.040> end<00:03:34.160> up<00:03:34.310> being<00:03:34.489> fun<00:03:34.670> I<00:03:34.730> could

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
usually doesn't end up being fun I could

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.180 
usually doesn't end up being fun I could
see<00:03:35.239> this<00:03:35.390> getting<00:03:35.540> really<00:03:36.260> boring<00:03:36.739> in<00:03:37.010> the

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
see this getting really boring in the

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.430 
see this getting really boring in the
next<00:03:37.790> couple<00:03:37.970> of<00:03:38.180> weeks<00:03:38.450> really<00:03:39.200> this<00:03:39.380> could

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
next couple of weeks really this could

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.340 
next couple of weeks really this could
be<00:03:40.100> a<00:03:40.130> good<00:03:40.430> game<00:03:41.000> mode<00:03:41.269> or<00:03:41.480> an<00:03:41.600> idea<00:03:41.989> if<00:03:42.200> they

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350 
be a good game mode or an idea if they

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.020 
be a good game mode or an idea if they
totally<00:03:42.800> revamped<00:03:43.220> it<00:03:43.489> like<00:03:43.610> i<00:03:43.760> was<00:03:43.880> saying

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
totally revamped it like i was saying

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:45.850 
totally revamped it like i was saying
maybe<00:03:44.330> he<00:03:44.510> dies<00:03:44.750> could<00:03:45.019> get<00:03:45.140> involved<00:03:45.680> and

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:45.860 
maybe he dies could get involved and

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:46.900 
maybe he dies could get involved and
they<00:03:45.950> could<00:03:46.100> actually<00:03:46.280> make<00:03:46.640> this<00:03:46.850> a

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
they could actually make this a

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.630 
they could actually make this a
legitimate<00:03:47.870> zombie<00:03:48.620> game<00:03:48.830> mode<00:03:49.070> get<00:03:49.519> some

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
legitimate zombie game mode get some

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.580 
legitimate zombie game mode get some
more<00:03:49.790> player<00:03:50.030> models<00:03:50.450> in<00:03:50.600> there<00:03:50.780> and<00:03:51.080> actually

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
more player models in there and actually

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.740 
more player models in there and actually
have<00:03:51.980> kits<00:03:52.280> and<00:03:52.610> with<00:03:53.030> assigned<00:03:53.360> weapons

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
have kits and with assigned weapons

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.930 
have kits and with assigned weapons
instead<00:03:54.080> of<00:03:54.200> just<00:03:54.380> using<00:03:54.470> whatever<00:03:55.370> kind<00:03:55.910> of

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
instead of just using whatever kind of

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:57.340 
instead of just using whatever kind of
weapon<00:03:56.239> walk<00:03:56.480> because<00:03:56.690> you<00:03:56.810> know<00:03:56.930> everyone's

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:57.350 
weapon walk because you know everyone's

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:59.230 
weapon walk because you know everyone's
going<00:03:57.530> to<00:03:57.620> use<00:03:58.220> an<00:03:58.370> LMG

00:03:59.230 --> 00:03:59.240 
going to use an LMG

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.750 
going to use an LMG
and<00:03:59.390> drop<00:04:00.050> themselves<00:04:00.470> ammo<00:04:00.800> so<00:04:01.040> really<00:04:01.730> I

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
and drop themselves ammo so really I

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.180 
and drop themselves ammo so really I
think<00:04:01.970> it<00:04:02.840> could<00:04:03.050> be<00:04:03.260> worked<00:04:03.500> on<00:04:03.650> maybe<00:04:04.010> it

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
think it could be worked on maybe it

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:05.770 
think it could be worked on maybe it
could<00:04:04.370> be<00:04:04.490> good<00:04:04.670> but<00:04:04.850> so<00:04:05.030> far<00:04:05.240> it's<00:04:05.450> just<00:04:05.600> kind

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
could be good but so far it's just kind

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.870 
could be good but so far it's just kind
of<00:04:05.840> whatever<00:04:06.260> now<00:04:06.980> what<00:04:07.340> I<00:04:07.370> really<00:04:07.670> want<00:04:07.850> to

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:07.880

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.120 
of whatever now what I really want to
see<00:04:07.970> and<00:04:08.330> what<00:04:08.660> everybody<00:04:09.140> else<00:04:09.230> wants<00:04:09.740> to<00:04:09.920> see

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
see and what everybody else wants to see

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
know look I don't know probably will

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.450 
know look I don't know probably will
never<00:04:23.420> happen<00:04:23.750> but<00:04:24.200> you<00:04:24.530> know<00:04:24.680> the<00:04:25.250> hopes

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
never happen but you know the hopes

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.640 
never happen but you know the hopes
always<00:04:25.670> there<00:04:26.000> but<00:04:26.720> you<00:04:26.960> know<00:04:26.990> for<00:04:27.080> now<00:04:27.350> we<00:04:27.410> got

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
always there but you know for now we got

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.380 
always there but you know for now we got
zombie<00:04:28.100> mode<00:04:28.280> maybe<00:04:28.640> this<00:04:28.910> will<00:04:28.940> become<00:04:29.180> a

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:29.390 
zombie mode maybe this will become a

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:33.040 
zombie mode maybe this will become a
thing<00:04:29.690> I<00:04:29.960> don't<00:04:30.500> know<00:04:30.740> probably<00:04:31.400> not<00:04:31.910> but<00:04:32.360> you

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050

thing I don't know probably not but you
know<00:04:33.170> here's<00:04:33.470> just<00:04:33.740> some<00:04:33.770> gameplay<00:04:34.460> of<00:04:34.790> it<00:04:35.120> it

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
know here's just some gameplay of it it

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.870 
know here's just some gameplay of it it
was<00:04:36.020> an<00:04:36.110> ok<00:04:36.200> game<00:04:36.620> mode<00:04:36.890> but<00:04:37.280> we'll<00:04:37.670> see<00:04:37.790> what

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 
was an ok game mode but we'll see what

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.330 
was an ok game mode but we'll see what
happens<00:04:38.030> and<00:04:38.680> so<00:04:39.680> I'm<00:04:39.890> pretty<00:04:39.980> much<00:04:40.100> done
