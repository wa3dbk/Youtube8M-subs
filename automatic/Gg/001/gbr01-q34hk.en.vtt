I<00:00:55.300> remember<00:00:56.290> this<00:00:56.440> game<00:00:56.649> when<00:00:56.860> it<00:00:56.980> was<00:00:57.129> new

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:57.309 
I remember this game when it was new

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:00.150 
I remember this game when it was new
because<00:00:57.640> I<00:00:57.760> had<00:00:58.000> an<00:00:58.210> Atari<00:00:58.600> 2600<00:00:59.440> and<00:00:59.829> loved

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:00.160 
because I had an Atari 2600 and loved

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.040 
because I had an Atari 2600 and loved
space<00:01:00.640> invaders<00:01:01.149> I<00:01:01.300> still<00:01:01.570> love<00:01:01.750> space

invaders<00:01:02.530> to<00:01:02.710> this<00:01:02.829> day<00:01:03.129> a<00:01:03.520> friend<00:01:04.360> of<00:01:04.479> mine

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:04.660 
invaders to this day a friend of mine

invaders to this day a friend of mine
had<00:01:04.960> an<00:01:05.170> Atari<00:01:05.530> 5200<00:01:06.310> and<00:01:06.820> I<00:01:07.210> was<00:01:07.360> blown<00:01:07.690> away

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:07.869 
had an Atari 5200 and I was blown away

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:10.560 
had an Atari 5200 and I was blown away
by<00:01:08.200> the<00:01:08.259> fact<00:01:08.350> that<00:01:08.830> the<00:01:09.220> invaders<00:01:10.090> were

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 
by the fact that the invaders were

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.440 
by the fact that the invaders were
colorful

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.600 

and<00:01:16.450> there's<00:01:17.380> more<00:01:17.590> variety<00:01:17.740> in<00:01:18.160> these<00:01:18.370> space

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.610 
and there's more variety in these space

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.610 
and there's more variety in these space
invaders<00:01:19.120> or<00:01:19.330> at<00:01:19.660> least<00:01:19.840> they<00:01:19.990> look<00:01:20.170> different

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:20.620 
invaders or at least they look different

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.890 
invaders or at least they look different
than<00:01:20.770> they<00:01:20.890> do<00:01:20.950> in<00:01:21.070> the<00:01:21.250> Atari<00:01:21.580> 2600<00:01:22.270> version

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:22.900 
than they do in the Atari 2600 version

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.430 
than they do in the Atari 2600 version

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
to be more powerful than the Atari 2600

to be more powerful than the Atari 2600
and<00:02:29.700> strike<00:02:30.700> three<00:02:31.120> is<00:02:32.010> the<00:02:33.010> controller<00:02:33.519> not<00:02:34.510> a

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:34.570 
and strike three is the controller not a

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:41.789 
and strike three is the controller not a
good<00:02:34.870> game<00:02:35.049> for<00:02:35.320> the<00:02:35.410> 5200<00:02:36.130> controller<00:02:40.799> but

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 
good game for the 5200 controller but

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:43.229 
good game for the 5200 controller but
seriously<00:02:42.280> that<00:02:42.459> just<00:02:42.640> added<00:02:43.000> a<00:02:43.060> whole

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
seriously that just added a whole

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:45.150 
seriously that just added a whole
strategic<00:02:43.420> element<00:02:44.170> to<00:02:44.290> space<00:02:44.530> invaders<00:02:44.980> when

strategic element to space invaders when

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.160 
strategic element to space invaders when
you<00:02:45.280> only<00:02:45.730> saw<00:02:45.970> them<00:02:46.180> when<00:02:46.360> you<00:02:46.450> hit<00:02:46.660> them<00:02:46.870> and

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
you only saw them when you hit them and

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:48.630 
you only saw them when you hit them and
they<00:02:47.230> were<00:02:47.440> invisible<00:02:47.950> the<00:02:48.040> rest<00:02:48.250> of<00:02:48.400> the<00:02:48.489> time

on the 5200 is a nice-looking game and
it<00:03:02.580> would<00:03:02.760> play<00:03:03.090> well<00:03:03.360> or<00:03:03.870> it<00:03:03.960> not<00:03:04.110> for<00:03:04.380> the

horrible 5200 controller which really

horrible 5200 controller which really
gets<00:03:07.590> in<00:03:07.800> the<00:03:07.920> way<00:03:08.130> of<00:03:08.370> this<00:03:09.030> game<00:03:09.360> in

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
gets in the way of this game in

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.230 
gets in the way of this game in
particular<00:03:09.920> more<00:03:10.920> so<00:03:11.190> than<00:03:11.400> any<00:03:11.580> other<00:03:11.700> Atari

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.240

particular more so than any other Atari
5200<00:03:12.870> game<00:03:13.320> that<00:03:13.500> I've<00:03:13.590> played<00:03:13.890> even<00:03:14.550> pac-man

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
5200 game that I've played even pac-man

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.120 
5200 game that I've played even pac-man
because<00:03:15.480> in<00:03:15.780> pac-man<00:03:16.020> you<00:03:16.290> don't<00:03:16.680> need<00:03:16.920> to<00:03:17.040> use

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
because in pac-man you don't need to use

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.270 
because in pac-man you don't need to use
a<00:03:17.160> fire<00:03:17.520> button<00:03:18.350> now<00:03:19.350> moving<00:03:19.650> left<00:03:19.890> and<00:03:20.100> right

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
a fire button now moving left and right

a fire button now moving left and right
in<00:03:20.430> this<00:03:20.520> game<00:03:20.790> is<00:03:20.970> bad<00:03:21.150> enough<00:03:21.330> because<00:03:21.780> you

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
in this game is bad enough because you

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.690 
in this game is bad enough because you
really<00:03:22.140> want<00:03:22.170> to<00:03:22.410> make<00:03:22.590> very<00:03:22.830> short<00:03:23.190> precise

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
really want to make very short precise

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.460 
really want to make very short precise
movements<00:03:24.270> which<00:03:24.390> are<00:03:24.540> difficult<00:03:24.780> with<00:03:25.260> the

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
movements which are difficult with the

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.150 
movements which are difficult with the
5200<00:03:26.250> analog<00:03:26.820> non<00:03:27.540> self-centering<00:03:28.530> joystick

5200 analog non self-centering joystick

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.850 
5200 analog non self-centering joystick
but<00:03:29.760> the<00:03:29.910> big<00:03:30.150> problem<00:03:30.720> is<00:03:30.870> that<00:03:30.930> my<00:03:31.500> fire

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
but the big problem is that my fire

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.010 
but the big problem is that my fire
button<00:03:32.160> was<00:03:32.880> stuck<00:03:33.210> for<00:03:33.480> about<00:03:33.750> half<00:03:33.990> the

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:34.020 
button was stuck for about half the

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.370 
button was stuck for about half the
review<00:03:35.120> you<00:03:36.120> can<00:03:36.180> hold<00:03:36.510> down<00:03:36.690> the<00:03:36.900> button<00:03:37.050> and

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
review you can hold down the button and

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.530 
review you can hold down the button and
rapid<00:03:38.010> fire<00:03:38.310> the<00:03:38.520> aliens<00:03:39.000> if<00:03:39.150> you're<00:03:39.300> shooting

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
rapid fire the aliens if you're shooting

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.600 
rapid fire the aliens if you're shooting
the<00:03:39.780> bottom<00:03:40.110> row<00:03:40.350> or<00:03:40.590> you're<00:03:40.740> firing<00:03:41.070> up<00:03:41.310> into

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
the bottom row or you're firing up into

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.330 
the bottom row or you're firing up into
your<00:03:41.730> shield<00:03:42.030> because<00:03:42.360> you<00:03:42.540> can<00:03:42.690> fire<00:03:42.990> once<00:03:43.380> at

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
your shield because you can fire once at

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.790 
your shield because you can fire once at
a<00:03:44.400> time<00:03:44.820> you<00:03:45.690> cannot<00:03:45.930> fire<00:03:46.260> again<00:03:46.560> once

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:46.800 
a time you cannot fire again once

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.170 
a time you cannot fire again once
there's<00:03:47.010> a<00:03:47.100> shot<00:03:47.310> on<00:03:47.490> screen<00:03:47.820> so<00:03:48.000> if<00:03:48.060> you're

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
there's a shot on screen so if you're

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.550 
there's a shot on screen so if you're
shooting<00:03:48.360> something<00:03:48.660> close<00:03:49.020> to<00:03:49.050> you<00:03:49.320> it's

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
shooting something close to you it's

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.260 
shooting something close to you it's
like<00:03:49.800> you<00:03:49.920> can<00:03:50.100> machine-gun<00:03:50.670> them<00:03:50.850> this

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:51.270 
like you can machine-gun them this

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.120 
like you can machine-gun them this
becomes<00:03:51.720> a<00:03:51.870> problem<00:03:52.110> when<00:03:52.350> the<00:03:52.650> fire<00:03:52.860> button

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
becomes a problem when the fire button

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:54.830 
becomes a problem when the fire button
is<00:03:53.340> stuck<00:03:53.640> and<00:03:53.820> you're<00:03:53.910> trying<00:03:54.270> to<00:03:54.390> shoot<00:03:54.600> the

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
is stuck and you're trying to shoot the

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
last alien invading because then you

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.060 
last alien invading because then you
cannot<00:03:59.340> line<00:03:59.610> up<00:03:59.790> a<00:03:59.970> precise<00:04:00.510> shot<00:04:01.110> and<00:04:01.410> you're

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070 
cannot line up a precise shot and you're
