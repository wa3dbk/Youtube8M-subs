includes all the gearbox and the only

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.470 
includes all the gearbox and the only
motor<00:00:22.260> of<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.590> power<00:00:22.859> functions<00:00:23.400> and<00:00:23.609> mounts

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
motor of the power functions and mounts

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.849 
motor of the power functions and mounts
it<00:00:24.570> on<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.779> back<00:00:24.930> of<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.140> truck<00:00:25.410> so<00:00:25.439> you<00:00:25.650> can

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
it on the back of the truck so you can

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.650 
it on the back of the truck so you can
see<00:00:26.039> it<00:00:26.130> there<00:00:26.340> so<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:27.000> only<00:00:27.119> thing<00:00:27.359> that<00:00:27.510> is

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
see it there so the only thing that is

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.880 
see it there so the only thing that is
left<00:00:27.689> to<00:00:28.050> build<00:00:28.260> is<00:00:29.130> book<00:00:29.640> 6<00:00:29.970> and<00:00:30.300> book<00:00:31.260> 6<00:00:31.590> go

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
left to build is book 6 and book 6 go

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.770 
left to build is book 6 and book 6 go
goes<00:00:32.399> ahead<00:00:32.520> and<00:00:32.759> finishes<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.329> boom<00:00:33.510> and

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
goes ahead and finishes the boom and

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.200 
goes ahead and finishes the boom and
will<00:00:34.320> attach<00:00:34.620> it<00:00:34.890> to<00:00:35.130> these<00:00:35.250> linear<00:00:35.700> actuators

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
will attach it to these linear actuators

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.750 
will attach it to these linear actuators
here<00:00:36.620> so<00:00:37.620> I<00:00:37.649> just<00:00:37.920> wanted<00:00:38.399> to<00:00:38.489> give<00:00:38.610> you<00:00:38.700> a

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
here so I just wanted to give you a

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.389 
here so I just wanted to give you a
quick<00:00:38.969> look<00:00:39.180> of<00:00:39.500> how<00:00:40.500> this<00:00:40.680> thing<00:00:40.920> mounts<00:00:41.250> up

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
quick look of how this thing mounts up

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.000 
quick look of how this thing mounts up
on<00:00:41.550> there<00:00:41.790> before<00:00:42.059> we<00:00:42.180> get<00:00:42.270> it<00:00:42.390> completely

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 
on there before we get it completely

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.389 
on there before we get it completely
mounted<00:00:44.010> up<00:00:44.160> but<00:00:44.430> it<00:00:44.520> does<00:00:44.730> just<00:00:45.090> sit<00:00:45.329> on<00:00:45.450> a<00:00:46.399> on

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
mounted up but it does just sit on a on

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.650 
mounted up but it does just sit on a on
a<00:00:47.460> on<00:00:47.700> a<00:00:47.760> pivot<00:00:48.270> gear<00:00:48.660> there<00:00:48.930> so<00:00:49.200> it's<00:00:50.660> this

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
a on a pivot gear there so it's this

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.389 
a on a pivot gear there so it's this
thing<00:00:51.930> is<00:00:52.050> enormous<00:00:52.170> I<00:00:52.680> mean<00:00:52.890> this<00:00:52.980> set<00:00:53.250> is

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
thing is enormous I mean this set is

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:54.860 
thing is enormous I mean this set is
almost<00:00:53.550> so<00:00:53.820> big<00:00:53.969> I<00:00:54.000> can't<00:00:54.300> even<00:00:54.390> hardly<00:00:54.539> handle

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
almost so big I can't even hardly handle

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:02.619 
almost so big I can't even hardly handle
it<00:00:55.110> but<00:00:55.289> it<00:00:55.980> is<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.219> big<00:00:56.460> big<00:00:56.730> set<00:00:58.730> but<00:00:59.730> this<00:00:59.940> a

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:04.880 

couple<00:01:03.629> things<00:01:03.809> I<00:01:03.930> want<00:01:04.110> you<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.229> note<00:01:04.470> is<00:01:04.680> this

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
couple things I want you to note is this

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.130 
couple things I want you to note is this
switch<00:01:05.159> right<00:01:05.189> here<00:01:05.670> is<00:01:06.270> what<00:01:06.600> brings<00:01:06.840> your

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
switch right here is what brings your

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.000 
switch right here is what brings your
outriggers<00:01:07.770> in<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.640> out<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:09.049> the<00:01:10.049> motor<00:01:10.350> is

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
outriggers in and out and the motor is

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.609 
outriggers in and out and the motor is
in<00:01:11.310> here<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:11.820> it<00:01:12.810> drives<00:01:13.080> all<00:01:13.260> that<00:01:13.470> in<00:01:13.560> the

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
in here and it drives all that in the

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.920 
in here and it drives all that in the
chassis<00:01:14.010> so<00:01:14.040> it<00:01:14.310> is<00:01:14.640> fantastically<00:01:15.540> designed

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
chassis so it is fantastically designed

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.749 
chassis so it is fantastically designed
as<00:01:16.110> far<00:01:16.350> as<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.740> gear<00:01:16.979> train<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.460> everything

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
as far as the gear train and everything

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:18.920 
as far as the gear train and everything
in<00:01:17.880> there<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.119> like<00:01:18.210> I<00:01:18.240> said<00:01:18.509> in<00:01:18.659> my<00:01:18.689> last

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
in there and like I said in my last

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.580 
in there and like I said in my last
video<00:01:19.320> it<00:01:19.979> is<00:01:20.159> amazing<00:01:20.729> at<00:01:21.659> how<00:01:21.900> well<00:01:22.229> that

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
video it is amazing at how well that

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.280 
video it is amazing at how well that
gear<00:01:23.549> box<00:01:23.759> is<00:01:23.970> designed<00:01:26.689> all<00:01:27.689> right<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:28.110> then

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
gear box is designed all right and then

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.740 
gear box is designed all right and then
something<00:01:28.650> else<00:01:28.770> over<00:01:29.100> here<00:01:29.130> is<00:01:29.430> this<00:01:30.390> is<00:01:30.600> like

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
something else over here is this is like

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:37.760 
something else over here is this is like
a<00:01:30.780> little<00:01:30.990> 4-way<00:01:34.369> a<00:01:35.369> gear<00:01:35.909> box<00:01:35.939> shifter<00:01:36.900> where

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
a little 4-way a gear box shifter where

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.370 
a little 4-way a gear box shifter where
you<00:01:37.950> can<00:01:38.189> this<00:01:39.000> is<00:01:39.210> how<00:01:39.360> you<00:01:39.420> select<00:01:39.930> all<00:01:40.259> the

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
you can this is how you select all the

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.440 
you can this is how you select all the
different<00:01:40.770> features<00:01:41.490> that<00:01:42.079> that<00:01:43.079> one<00:01:43.320> motor

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
different features that that one motor

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.850 
different features that that one motor
drives<00:01:45.450> all<00:01:45.780> of<00:01:45.960> those<00:01:46.079> different<00:01:46.530> features

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
drives all of those different features

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.620 
drives all of those different features
so<00:01:47.009> that<00:01:47.159> kind<00:01:47.399> of<00:01:47.430> gives<00:01:47.610> you<00:01:47.700> an<00:01:47.790> idea<00:01:47.850> of<00:01:48.240> the

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
so that kind of gives you an idea of the

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.139 
so that kind of gives you an idea of the
complexity<00:01:49.170> of<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.500> gear<00:01:49.680> box<00:01:49.860> that<00:01:50.790> that

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
complexity of the gear box that that

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.950 
complexity of the gear box that that
that<00:01:51.960> has<00:01:52.290> right<00:01:52.590> there<00:01:53.570> but<00:01:54.570> anyway<00:01:54.840> guys

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
that has right there but anyway guys

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.950 
that has right there but anyway guys
that's<00:01:55.290> book<00:01:55.649> 5<00:01:56.060> one<00:01:57.060> more<00:01:57.270> book<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:57.750> get<00:01:57.869> all

that's book 5 one more book and get all

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.109 
that's book 5 one more book and get all
get<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.320> boom<00:01:58.500> done<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:59.009> I'll<00:01:59.100> do<00:01:59.340> a<00:01:59.579> review

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
get the boom done and I'll do a review

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.120 
get the boom done and I'll do a review
on<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.659> boom<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:01.140> then<00:02:01.259> once<00:02:01.439> I<00:02:01.590> get<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:01.950> boom

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
on the boom and then once I get the boom

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.789 
on the boom and then once I get the boom
installed<00:02:02.700> and<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.450> completion<00:02:03.780> of<00:02:03.960> book<00:02:04.200> 6<00:02:04.500> I

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799
