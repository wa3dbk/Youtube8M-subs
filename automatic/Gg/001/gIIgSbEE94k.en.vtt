00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:20.340
 Hello Smart climbing classroom festival 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:23.220
 So it is Aboriginal this time 10 layering system third layer 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:31.410
 I'll have time to learn about the outer garment. 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:36.180
 Ah, the third layer is called Perfection Layer in English. 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:41.910
 Protection means to be right, but what does that mean ? 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:43.920
 When we see this kind of bad weather, 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:48.180
 I want my body. 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:51.149
 So the rain forest is called the elimination city soon Oh well Wind jacket of yo 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:55.109
 The windshield lc belongs to the third layer. 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:57.870
 Yes. Yes, those clothes are right. This coat needs a football . 

00:00:55.109 --> 00:01:02.760
 No, because I do not need warmth. 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:07.170
 The fabric is simply something to give to know dense because the do not eat a rainstorm 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:09.060
 To prevent wind and rain there is donor plain fabric yo mum matter if Joe directly 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.510
 I would not be able to weather it completely. 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:16.860
 Haha So thin on the cloth 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.180
 Usually by a rubber-coated rubber coating on the study of the social polyurethane 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.200
 When will you use it? 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.280
 Oh, well, this rubber coating has wind and rain, but it does not discharge sweat well. 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.780
 I will. 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:33.000
 Yes, the disadvantage of rubber coating is that this wind does not block much sweat emissions 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:37.890
 So there is a drawback to not having a rubber coating so thin nylon fabric 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:42.420
 It is very densely coated with a water-repellent directly reach the surface outrageous 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.920
 Water- repellent coating is a chemical that passes water droplets now. 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.750
 4 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:52.170
 If this happens to some extent now is the rest of the Viva and the wife is discharged sweat 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:55.500
 I can use it a little more lightly . 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:02:00.000
 Oh, really, these two things have drawbacks . 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:04.890
 In the case of Como Coating, the wind and rain are perfectly increased, but the sweat is good. 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:07.560
 If it designed as another water-repellent coating, sweat emissions, but some good weather 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:12.300
 There are a few weaknesses that can not be collected. 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.150
 Yes, but I came up with a new resin that solves those shortcomings. 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:18.040
 4 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:23.470
 The cortex is just right for you Gore-Tex is also true rubber coating 1 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:28.629
 Jungyijiman is that which is perfect to sales, but the ball is coated waterproof windproof 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:31.150
 Give the new material with breathable features to really here below I x deungsanbok 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:34.659
 I think there are a lot of advantages as 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.560
 I want to know more about Gore Tax . 

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:39.310
 Please tell us 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:42.370
 I'm going to go into more detail about next-generation atex next time. 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:45.909
 There is a caution when wearing the third layer 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:49.000
 It is not to be worn in everyday wear 

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:53.049
 Oh, do not dress up as usual. 4 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:57.849
 This wind jacket-like jacket should be on the third layer . 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:59.650
 For the three pre-wind at the time of the second layer when hers Oh evil cloth 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:04.359
 The clothes you wear when you eat. 4 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:06.519
 Usually, many people like to wear jackets such as wind jackets for climbing purposes 

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:09.909
 There are so many things you wear. 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:13.930
 Yes. That's the wrong way. The third layer. 

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:17.680
 Normally, I carry it in a small pocket and carry it when I need it. 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:21.699
 You only need to take it out and put it on it. 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:26.500
 Wore 3rd if it was cold 

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:30.639
 Then the second yaw control rear that is sufficient for the clothes I wear something nice third 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:33.340
 Even wear layers of clothes to wear also maintain a self-sufficient body temperature 

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:37.629
 Hers is the correct array system 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.980
 Oh, there are a lot of people who read this wrong way . 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:44.019
 I'm the same 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:46.359
 4 This time, the last three layers of the triage layering system 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:51.040
 I learned about it. 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:51.790
 Wink is Jacquet windshield doeneundeyo falls under this cloak as a third layer 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:57.280
 In the case of 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:04:01.599
 Still not what always read regardless of the season has approached danisi of about weather 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:04.500
 When you meet 1,000 won, you need to wear a smart climbing 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:04.500
 Keep in mind 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.700
