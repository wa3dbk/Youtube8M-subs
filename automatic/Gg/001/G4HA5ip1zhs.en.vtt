the faith and the homemade one this

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:35.150 
the faith and the homemade one this
isn't<00:02:29.730> it<00:02:29.819> as<00:02:30.500> a<00:02:31.500> mid<00:02:32.330> dark<00:02:33.330> color<00:02:33.900> as<00:02:34.440> the<00:02:34.860> real

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
one because I get fast draft print for

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:44.690 
one because I get fast draft print for
them<00:02:39.650> ok<00:02:40.650> so<00:02:41.420> then<00:02:42.420> on<00:02:42.569> the<00:02:42.720> front<00:02:43.220> I'll<00:02:44.220> show

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
them ok so then on the front I'll show

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.300 
them ok so then on the front I'll show
you<00:02:44.760> a<00:02:45.030> real<00:02:45.690> lightning<00:02:46.110> energy<00:02:46.650> and<00:02:46.920> one<00:02:47.190> of

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
you a real lightning energy and one of

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.520 
you a real lightning energy and one of
my<00:02:47.489> fake<00:02:48.480> lightly<00:02:48.930> energies<00:02:49.440> that<00:02:49.739> I<00:02:49.799> made<00:02:51.530> by

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
my fake lightly energies that I made by

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.059 
my fake lightly energies that I made by
here's<00:02:52.890> the<00:02:53.190> real<00:02:54.030> energy<00:02:54.830> the<00:02:55.830> real

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
here's the real energy the real

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:59.270 
here's the real energy the real
lightning<00:02:56.340> energy<00:02:56.940> then<00:02:57.780> here<00:02:58.260> is<00:02:58.410> a<00:02:58.799> fake

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
lightning energy then here is a fake

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.830 
lightning energy then here is a fake
plate<00:03:00.680> ok<00:03:01.680> so<00:03:01.739> as<00:03:02.190> you<00:03:02.310> can<00:03:02.430> see<00:03:02.730> this<00:03:03.420> one<00:03:03.630> has

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
plate ok so as you can see this one has

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.039 
plate ok so as you can see this one has
like<00:03:04.019> a<00:03:04.049> shadow<00:03:04.470> of<00:03:04.620> Pokemon<00:03:05.400> and<00:03:05.730> a<00:03:06.180> tower

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
like a shadow of Pokemon and a tower

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:12.250 
like a shadow of Pokemon and a tower
back<00:03:07.410> there<00:03:08.120> and<00:03:09.120> this<00:03:09.239> one<00:03:09.299> is<00:03:09.780> just<00:03:09.810> a<00:03:10.170> normal

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
back there and this one is just a normal

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:18.380 
back there and this one is just a normal
ok<00:03:13.260> so<00:03:13.320> that's<00:03:13.530> a<00:03:13.620> fake<00:03:13.950> and<00:03:14.930> the<00:03:15.930> real<00:03:16.560> and<00:03:17.489> and

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
ok so that's a fake and the real and and

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.920 
ok so that's a fake and the real and and
it<00:03:19.109> has<00:03:19.260> rounded<00:03:19.890> edges<00:03:20.370> the<00:03:21.209> real<00:03:21.450> one<00:03:21.690> and

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
it has rounded edges the real one and

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.650 
it has rounded edges the real one and
the<00:03:22.560> fake<00:03:22.769> one<00:03:23.010> I<00:03:23.220> just<00:03:23.570> cut<00:03:24.570> little<00:03:25.170> slots<00:03:25.859> I

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
the fake one I just cut little slots I

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.349 
the fake one I just cut little slots I
just<00:03:27.660> cut<00:03:27.870> off<00:03:28.019> each<00:03:28.200> side<00:03:28.280> some<00:03:29.280> sort<00:03:30.090> of<00:03:30.180> make

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:30.359 
just cut off each side some sort of make

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:32.150
