and a very stiff joint on the leg there

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:28.959 
and a very stiff joint on the leg there
the<00:04:26.060> secondary<00:04:26.690> join<00:04:26.900> just<00:04:27.199> above<00:04:27.500> or<00:04:27.770> just<00:04:27.969> on

00:04:28.959 --> 00:04:28.969 
the secondary join just above or just on

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:31.719 
the secondary join just above or just on
the<00:04:29.150> top<00:04:29.450> of<00:04:29.630> the<00:04:29.810> thigh<00:04:30.229> area<00:04:30.529> and<00:04:31.010> we<00:04:31.520> have

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:31.729 
the top of the thigh area and we have

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:34.480 
the top of the thigh area and we have
again<00:04:32.090> our<00:04:32.620> double<00:04:33.620> hinge<00:04:33.889> joint

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
again our double hinge joint

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.480 
again our double hinge joint
two<00:04:34.610> of<00:04:34.849> the<00:04:34.970> knee<00:04:35.120> and<00:04:35.410> our<00:04:36.410> last<00:04:36.860> joint<00:04:37.099> is

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
two of the knee and our last joint is

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.870 
two of the knee and our last joint is
our<00:04:37.789> foot<00:04:38.120> which<00:04:38.419> as<00:04:38.720> I<00:04:39.199> say<00:04:39.470> like<00:04:40.160> we<00:04:40.370> do<00:04:40.669> have

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 
our foot which as I say like we do have

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.180 
our foot which as I say like we do have
a<00:04:40.910> lot<00:04:41.120> of<00:04:41.150> spread<00:04:41.660> on<00:04:41.810> these<00:04:41.990> feasts<00:04:42.410> so<00:04:42.440> this

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
a lot of spread on these feasts so this

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.189 
a lot of spread on these feasts so this
figure<00:04:43.430> will<00:04:43.639> stand<00:04:43.940> up<00:04:44.090> very<00:04:44.479> well<00:04:44.569> so<00:04:44.930> maybe

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:45.199 
figure will stand up very well so maybe

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:47.860 
figure will stand up very well so maybe
you<00:04:45.949> won't<00:04:46.160> need<00:04:46.490> to<00:04:46.699> use<00:04:46.729> an<00:04:47.300> action<00:04:47.690> figure

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
you won't need to use an action figure

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.140 
you won't need to use an action figure
standard<00:04:48.410> with<00:04:48.560> this<00:04:48.800> like<00:04:49.460> you<00:04:49.639> made<00:04:49.849> it<00:04:50.000> with

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
standard with this like you made it with

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.350 
standard with this like you made it with
some<00:04:50.389> likely<00:04:50.870> black<00:04:51.020> cat<00:04:51.560> for<00:04:52.120> example<00:04:53.120> we<00:04:53.210> do

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 
some likely black cat for example we do

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.570 
some likely black cat for example we do
have<00:04:53.569> our<00:04:53.900> rocking<00:04:54.710> foot<00:04:54.979> there<00:04:55.130> and<00:04:55.280> you<00:04:55.400> can

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
have our rocking foot there and you can

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:59.770 
have our rocking foot there and you can
twist<00:04:55.880> that<00:04:56.000> foot<00:04:56.330> as<00:04:56.539> well<00:04:56.690> so<00:04:57.560> loss<00:04:57.860> of<00:04:58.780> scope

00:04:59.770 --> 00:04:59.780 
twist that foot as well so loss of scope

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.950 
twist that foot as well so loss of scope
for<00:05:00.440> positioning<00:05:01.250> this<00:05:01.430> figure<00:05:01.819> on<00:05:02.030> display

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 
for positioning this figure on display

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.809 
for positioning this figure on display
lady<00:05:03.229> to<00:05:03.410> see<00:05:03.620> standing<00:05:04.009> up<00:05:04.280> straight<00:05:04.610> away

00:05:04.809 --> 00:05:04.819 
lady to see standing up straight away

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:06.879 
lady to see standing up straight away
even<00:05:05.270> with<00:05:05.360> all<00:05:05.509> that<00:05:05.539> manipulation<00:05:06.199> this

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:06.889 
even with all that manipulation this

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:10.779 
even with all that manipulation this
figure<00:05:07.250> will<00:05:07.400> stand<00:05:07.789> up<00:05:08.440> immediately<00:05:09.440> I<00:05:09.789> think

00:05:10.779 --> 00:05:10.789 
figure will stand up immediately I think

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:12.999 
figure will stand up immediately I think
maybe<00:05:11.509> the<00:05:11.870> red<00:05:12.169> color<00:05:12.440> looks<00:05:12.740> a<00:05:12.889> little

00:05:12.999 --> 00:05:13.009 
maybe the red color looks a little

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:16.029 
maybe the red color looks a little
cheaper<00:05:13.759> on<00:05:14.090> this<00:05:15.050> figure<00:05:15.289> then<00:05:15.500> a<00:05:15.530> lot<00:05:15.770> of<00:05:15.949> the

00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:16.039 
cheaper on this figure then a lot of the

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:18.339 
cheaper on this figure then a lot of the
colors<00:05:16.310> on<00:05:16.520> the<00:05:16.699> other<00:05:16.819> action<00:05:17.240> figures<00:05:17.630> the

00:05:18.339 --> 00:05:18.349 
colors on the other action figures the

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:21.550 
colors on the other action figures the
the<00:05:18.979> red<00:05:19.250> in<00:05:19.400> my<00:05:19.430> opinion<00:05:19.970> does<00:05:20.210> seem<00:05:20.539> to<00:05:21.409> make

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:21.560 
the red in my opinion does seem to make

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.330 
the red in my opinion does seem to make
the<00:05:21.740> plastic<00:05:22.220> look<00:05:22.639> a<00:05:22.940> little<00:05:23.720> cheaper<00:05:24.380> then

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:25.340 
the plastic look a little cheaper then

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:26.980 
the plastic look a little cheaper then
on<00:05:25.550> the<00:05:25.669> most<00:05:25.909> of<00:05:26.120> the<00:05:26.240> other<00:05:26.360> action<00:05:26.720> figures

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:26.990 
on the most of the other action figures

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:28.930 
on the most of the other action figures
but<00:05:27.139> please<00:05:27.590> don't<00:05:27.860> let<00:05:28.130> that<00:05:28.190> take<00:05:28.580> anything

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:28.940 
but please don't let that take anything

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.450 
but please don't let that take anything
