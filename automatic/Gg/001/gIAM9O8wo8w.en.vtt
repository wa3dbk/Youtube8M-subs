00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:38.510 
the risotto or at the very end after
that<00:01:32.689> we<00:01:33.689> pour<00:01:34.610> we<00:01:35.610> deglaze<00:01:35.939> with<00:01:37.070> some<00:01:38.070> white

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520

that we pour we deglaze with some white
wine

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.840 

and<00:01:42.210> we<00:01:42.570> let<00:01:42.750> it<00:01:42.870> evaporate<00:01:43.200> if<00:01:44.159> we<00:01:44.430> don't<00:01:44.610> let

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
and we let it evaporate if we don't let

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.420 
and we let it evaporate if we don't let
evaporator<00:01:45.510> white<00:01:45.900> wine<00:01:46.229> there<00:01:46.890> will<00:01:47.070> result

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
evaporator white wine there will result

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.500 
evaporator white wine there will result
as<00:01:47.640> a<00:01:48.050> given<00:01:49.050> a<00:01:49.370> acidic<00:01:50.370> taste<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.940> your<00:01:51.120> result

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:51.510 
as a given a acidic taste to your result

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.320 
as a given a acidic taste to your result
so<00:01:51.660> once<00:01:51.960> we<00:01:52.170> had<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.920> whiners<00:01:53.820> evaporate

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
so once we had the whiners evaporate

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.730 
so once we had the whiners evaporate
completely<00:01:55.640> we<00:01:56.640> can<00:01:56.880> add<00:01:57.030> a<00:01:57.690> little<00:01:58.470> bit<00:01:58.680> of

at the very high flame until the broth

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.270 
at the very high flame until the broth
is<00:03:02.160> not<00:03:02.489> almost<00:03:03.450> evaporated<00:03:03.959> after<00:03:04.829> that

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
is not almost evaporated after that

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.890 
is not almost evaporated after that
we're<00:03:05.670> going<00:03:05.820> to<00:03:05.910> start<00:03:06.150> adding<00:03:06.299> our<00:03:06.570> fish

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
we're going to start adding our fish

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.710 
we're going to start adding our fish
broth<00:03:07.170> into<00:03:07.560> our<00:03:08.100> risotto<00:03:08.519> and<00:03:09.060> we're<00:03:09.540> gonna

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
broth into our risotto and we're gonna

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.960 
broth into our risotto and we're gonna
do<00:03:09.930> that<00:03:09.959> little<00:03:10.620> by<00:03:10.739> little<00:03:10.769> just<00:03:11.400> enough<00:03:11.519> to

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
do that little by little just enough to

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.539 
do that little by little just enough to
cover<00:03:12.180> the<00:03:12.329> rice<00:03:12.690> with<00:03:13.110> the<00:03:13.230> broth<00:03:13.470> so<00:03:14.310> they

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
cover the rice with the broth so they

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:17.289 
cover the rice with the broth so they
would<00:03:14.730> not<00:03:14.940> end<00:03:15.750> up<00:03:15.989> we<00:03:16.470> will<00:03:16.590> not<00:03:16.799> end<00:03:17.070> up

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
would not end up we will not end up

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:22.430 
would not end up we will not end up
overcooking<00:03:18.299> a<00:03:18.709> result<00:03:21.079> meantime<00:03:22.079> we<00:03:22.230> keep

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
overcooking a result meantime we keep

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.289 
overcooking a result meantime we keep
steering<00:03:22.799> because<00:03:23.220> otherwise<00:03:23.579> the<00:03:23.850> result<00:03:24.150> is

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
steering because otherwise the result is

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.270 
steering because otherwise the result is
gonna<00:03:24.480> stick<00:03:24.810> to<00:03:24.840> the<00:03:25.079> bottom<00:03:25.230> of<00:03:25.530> our<00:03:25.620> path<00:03:25.890> of

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
gonna stick to the bottom of our path of

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.509 
gonna stick to the bottom of our path of
our<00:03:26.400> pot<00:03:27.410> okay<00:03:28.410> since<00:03:28.650> our<00:03:28.860> juices<00:03:29.280> have

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
our pot okay since our juices have

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:32.390 
our pot okay since our juices have
evaporated<00:03:30.450> completely<00:03:31.410> we're<00:03:32.190> going<00:03:32.310> to

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
evaporated completely we're going to

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.680 
evaporated completely we're going to
start<00:03:32.459> adding<00:03:33.180> the<00:03:33.989> fish<00:03:34.260> stock<00:03:34.880> as<00:03:35.880> I<00:03:36.480> say

start adding the fish stock as I say

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.690 
start adding the fish stock as I say
just<00:03:36.930> a<00:03:37.079> little<00:03:37.320> by<00:03:37.440> little<00:03:37.470> just<00:03:38.280> enough<00:03:38.370> to

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
just a little by little just enough to

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.280 
just a little by little just enough to
cover<00:03:39.019> the<00:03:40.019> right<00:03:40.200> so<00:03:41.100> we're<00:03:41.280> making<00:03:41.579> risotto

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
cover the right so we're making risotto

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.259 
cover the right so we're making risotto
there<00:03:43.290> is<00:03:43.410> no<00:03:43.590> really<00:03:43.860> an<00:03:44.040> exact<00:03:44.549> quantity<00:03:45.180> of

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
there is no really an exact quantity of

there is no really an exact quantity of
stock<00:03:45.690> you<00:03:46.079> need<00:03:46.320> to<00:03:46.470> use<00:03:46.650> for<00:03:46.980> your<00:03:47.010> rice

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
stock you need to use for your rice

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.850 
stock you need to use for your rice
because<00:03:48.870> that<00:03:49.079> may

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
because that may

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.800 
because that may
according<00:03:50.820> to<00:03:50.850> the<00:03:51.030> kind<00:03:51.270> of<00:03:51.390> rice<00:03:51.570> you're

according to the kind of rice you're
using<00:03:52.790> so<00:03:53.790> that's<00:03:53.970> why<00:03:54.120> we<00:03:54.150> add<00:03:54.480> in<00:03:54.690> the<00:03:54.870> water

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
using so that's why we add in the water

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.250 
using so that's why we add in the water
stock<00:03:56.010> little<00:03:56.430> by<00:03:56.550> little<00:03:56.580> so<00:03:57.570> they<00:03:57.870> would<00:03:58.080> not

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
stock little by little so they would not

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.230 
stock little by little so they would not
