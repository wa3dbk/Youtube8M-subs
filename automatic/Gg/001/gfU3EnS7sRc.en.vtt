00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
office and this is my office you'll

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.310 
office and this is my office you'll
notice<00:03:36.910> the<00:03:37.150> walls<00:03:37.420> are<00:03:37.720> very<00:03:37.840> thick<00:03:38.170> in

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:38.320 
notice the walls are very thick in

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.290 
notice the walls are very thick in
Minecraft<00:03:38.830> and<00:03:39.010> that<00:03:39.160> does<00:03:39.850> have<00:03:40.030> a<00:03:40.060> tendency

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:40.300 
Minecraft and that does have a tendency

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.090 
Minecraft and that does have a tendency
to<00:03:40.690> make<00:03:40.810> rooms<00:03:41.140> look<00:03:41.410> smaller<00:03:41.740> than<00:03:41.950> they

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
to make rooms look smaller than they

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.460 
to make rooms look smaller than they
really<00:03:42.370> are<00:03:42.400> so<00:03:43.360> while<00:03:43.570> things<00:03:43.780> are<00:03:43.990> to<00:03:44.230> scale

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
really are so while things are to scale

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.640 
really are so while things are to scale
and<00:03:44.800> things<00:03:45.010> are<00:03:45.310> life-size<00:03:46.110> they<00:03:47.110> end<00:03:47.470> up

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
and things are life-size they end up

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.230 
and things are life-size they end up
looking<00:03:48.040> a<00:03:48.100> little<00:03:48.220> bit<00:03:48.430> smaller<00:03:48.700> just

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:49.240 
looking a little bit smaller just

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.480 
looking a little bit smaller just
because<00:03:49.600> the<00:03:50.200> waltz<00:03:50.470> take<00:03:50.620> up<00:03:50.740> a<00:03:50.830> lot<00:03:51.070> of<00:03:51.130> space

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:51.490 
because the waltz take up a lot of space

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:53.430 
because the waltz take up a lot of space
so<00:03:52.480> we<00:03:52.510> can<00:03:52.690> go<00:03:52.810> back<00:03:52.959> through<00:03:53.170> the<00:03:53.290> back

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
so we can go back through the back

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:54.750 
so we can go back through the back
