looking<00:00:15.570> at<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:15.870> dysplasia<00:00:16.550> I<00:00:17.550> actually<00:00:17.940> came

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
looking at the dysplasia I actually came

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.609 
looking at the dysplasia I actually came
across<00:00:18.449> this<00:00:18.840> when<00:00:19.109> I<00:00:19.170> was<00:00:19.230> looking<00:00:19.350> at<00:00:19.590> a

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
across this when I was looking at a

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.070 
across this when I was looking at a
plug-in<00:00:20.039> in<00:00:20.130> cinema<00:00:20.520> 4d<00:00:20.699> and<00:00:21.449> it<00:00:21.660> kind<00:00:21.869> of<00:00:21.900> me

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
plug-in in cinema 4d and it kind of me

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.220 
plug-in in cinema 4d and it kind of me
the<00:00:22.619> demo<00:00:23.460> and<00:00:23.850> I<00:00:24.060> towards<00:00:24.449> a<00:00:24.539> mother<00:00:24.779> pre<00:00:25.080> boo

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
the demo and I towards a mother pre boo

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.890 
the demo and I towards a mother pre boo
had<00:00:25.920> this<00:00:26.070> fear<00:00:26.430> and<00:00:26.460> it<00:00:26.880> was<00:00:27.029> it<00:00:27.570> was<00:00:27.720> a<00:00:27.750> little

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
had this fear and it was it was a little

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.480 
had this fear and it was it was a little
jagged<00:00:28.109> on<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.439> top<00:00:28.650> and<00:00:28.890> it<00:00:28.949> can<00:00:29.099> look<00:00:29.250> quite

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
jagged on the top and it can look quite

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.959 
jagged on the top and it can look quite
nice<00:00:29.670> and<00:00:30.470> at<00:00:31.470> my<00:00:31.710> garage<00:00:31.949> you<00:00:32.130> read<00:00:32.460> creating

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
nice and at my garage you read creating

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.139 
nice and at my garage you read creating
this<00:00:34.040> as<00:00:35.040> you<00:00:35.190> see<00:00:35.370> here<00:00:35.550> this<00:00:35.700> is<00:00:35.760> actually<00:00:35.880> my

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
this as you see here this is actually my

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.110 
this as you see here this is actually my
Facebook<00:00:36.570> page<00:00:36.600> so<00:00:37.160> I've<00:00:38.160> done<00:00:38.370> a<00:00:38.760> lot<00:00:39.030> of

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
Facebook page so I've done a lot of

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.700 
Facebook page so I've done a lot of
projects<00:00:39.450> or<00:00:39.600> work<00:00:39.809> on<00:00:39.989> just<00:00:40.200> random<00:00:40.559> things

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
projects or work on just random things

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.590 
projects or work on just random things
often<00:00:40.980> upload<00:00:41.430> here<00:00:41.640> and<00:00:42.059> this<00:00:42.270> was<00:00:42.420> one<00:00:42.570> of

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
often upload here and this was one of

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.450 
often upload here and this was one of
them<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:43.050> you<00:00:43.559> see<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.860> top<00:00:44.040> of<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.250> sphere

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
them and you see the top of the sphere

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.270 
them and you see the top of the sphere
this<00:00:45.300> is<00:00:45.360> kind<00:00:45.840> of<00:00:45.870> like<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.020> mountain<00:00:46.469> range

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
this is kind of like a mountain range

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.459 
this is kind of like a mountain range
you<00:00:47.489> know<00:00:47.610> it's<00:00:48.360> all<00:00:48.450> jagged<00:00:48.750> at<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:48.989> top<00:00:49.230> and

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
you know it's all jagged at the top and

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.069 
you know it's all jagged at the top and
you<00:00:50.280> can<00:00:50.340> pretty<00:00:50.579> much<00:00:50.640> do<00:00:50.910> this<00:00:51.600> I<00:00:51.719> mean<00:00:51.809> this

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
you can pretty much do this I mean this

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.830 
you can pretty much do this I mean this
is<00:00:52.140> using<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.530> displacer<00:00:53.129> I<00:00:53.910> think<00:00:54.750> that

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
is using the displacer I think that

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.810 
is using the displacer I think that
looks<00:00:54.960> best<00:00:55.170> on<00:00:55.350> a<00:00:55.410> sphere<00:00:55.800> you<00:00:56.460> can<00:00:56.489> do<00:00:56.760> it

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
looks best on a sphere you can do it

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.709 
looks best on a sphere you can do it
with<00:00:56.940> text<00:00:57.329> or<00:00:57.420> whatever<00:00:57.800> I<00:00:59.000> think<00:01:00.000> that's<00:01:00.510> all

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
with text or whatever I think that's all

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.229 
with text or whatever I think that's all
talk<00:01:01.020> I<00:01:01.230> think<00:01:01.440> we'll<00:01:01.530> get<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.829> it<00:01:01.949> now<00:01:02.239> cinema

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
talk I think we'll get to it now cinema

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.600 
talk I think we'll get to it now cinema
4d<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:04.379> so<00:01:04.799> we're<00:01:04.949> just<00:01:04.979> going<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.220> start<00:01:05.460> off

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
4d and so we're just going to start off

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.880 
4d and so we're just going to start off
and<00:01:05.909> obviously<00:01:06.540> I'm<00:01:06.780> going<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.229> be<00:01:07.320> working<00:01:07.439> on

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
and obviously I'm going to be working on

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.609 
and obviously I'm going to be working on
a<00:01:08.130> sphere<00:01:08.490> you<00:01:09.119> can<00:01:09.659> add<00:01:09.869> in<00:01:10.020> text<00:01:10.290> it<00:01:10.590> is

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
a sphere you can add in text it is

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.410 
a sphere you can add in text it is
exactly<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.250> same<00:01:11.400> process<00:01:11.700> you<00:01:12.180> don't<00:01:12.330> need

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
exactly the same process you don't need

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.820 
exactly the same process you don't need
to<00:01:12.479> make<00:01:12.600> it<00:01:12.750> edit<00:01:12.930> or<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.229> think<00:01:13.439> what<00:01:13.650> about

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
to make it edit or to think what about

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:14.410 
to make it edit or to think what about
all<00:01:14.010> of<00:01:14.040> that

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
all of that

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.899 
all of that
so<00:01:15.420> once<00:01:15.600> you've<00:01:15.689> got<00:01:15.869> this<00:01:16.020> fear<00:01:16.290> in<00:01:16.790> how<00:01:17.790> you

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
so once you've got this fear in how you

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.760 
so once you've got this fear in how you
want<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.060> do<00:01:18.210> is<00:01:18.299> literally<00:01:18.600> go<00:01:19.409> into<00:01:19.560> the

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
want to do is literally go into the

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.840 
want to do is literally go into the
displacer<00:01:20.509> ROM<00:01:21.509> tab<00:01:21.720> effects<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:22.890> displacer

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
displacer ROM tab effects and displacer

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.020 
displacer ROM tab effects and displacer
and<00:01:24.240> simply<00:01:24.990> drag<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.500> displacer<00:01:25.950> as<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.640> child

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
and simply drag the displacer as a child

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.730 
and simply drag the displacer as a child
of<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.630> sphere<00:01:28.070> like<00:01:29.070> so<00:01:29.960> and<00:01:30.960> now<00:01:31.229> on<00:01:31.590> that

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
of the sphere like so and now on that

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.410 
of the sphere like so and now on that
his<00:01:31.860> face<00:01:32.070> obviously<00:01:32.850> nothing<00:01:33.090> what<00:01:33.210> happened

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
his face obviously nothing what happened

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.350 
his face obviously nothing what happened
immediately<00:01:33.650> he<00:01:34.650> need<00:01:34.829> truth<00:01:35.549> or<00:01:35.670> say<00:01:35.820> shade

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
immediately he need truth or say shade

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.460 
immediately he need truth or say shade
it<00:01:36.509> with<00:01:36.630> this<00:01:36.810> is<00:01:36.930> kind<00:01:37.079> of<00:01:37.110> gonna<00:01:37.229> be<00:01:37.320> the

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
it with this is kind of gonna be the

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.350 
it with this is kind of gonna be the
effect<00:01:37.799> that's<00:01:38.040> actually<00:01:38.280> created<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:39.210> I

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
effect that's actually created and I

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.120 
effect that's actually created and I
need<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.630> go<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:40.290> shader<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:40.860> we<00:01:40.950> need<00:01:41.070> to

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
need to go to a shader and we need to

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.850 
need to go to a shader and we need to
add<00:01:41.250> a<00:01:41.280> noise<00:01:41.930> the<00:01:42.930> noise<00:01:42.960> is<00:01:43.290> often<00:01:43.530> added<00:01:43.740> and

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
add a noise the noise is often added and

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.539 
add a noise the noise is often added and
bunk'd<00:01:44.189> give<00:01:44.369> it<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.490> bit<00:01:44.670> more<00:01:45.079> than<00:01:46.079> depth<00:01:46.549> but

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
bunk'd give it a bit more than depth but

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.249 
bunk'd give it a bit more than depth but
you<00:01:47.670> hear<00:01:47.909> is<00:01:48.060> used<00:01:48.329> to<00:01:48.479> kind<00:01:48.659> of<00:01:48.720> shrivel<00:01:49.170> up

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
you hear is used to kind of shrivel up

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.859 
you hear is used to kind of shrivel up
and<00:01:49.470> you<00:01:49.950> see<00:01:50.130> immediately<00:01:50.479> we<00:01:51.479> kind<00:01:51.659> of<00:01:51.720> got<00:01:51.810> a

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
and you see immediately we kind of got a

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.960 
and you see immediately we kind of got a
distorted<00:01:52.320> feel<00:01:52.710> like<00:01:52.920> a<00:01:52.950> rock<00:01:53.280> kind<00:01:53.549> of<00:01:53.640> if

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
distorted feel like a rock kind of if

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.190 
distorted feel like a rock kind of if
you<00:01:54.090> have<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.270> right<00:01:54.420> texture<00:01:54.930> and<00:01:55.049> could

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
you have the right texture and could

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.870 
you have the right texture and could
kind<00:01:55.380> of<00:01:55.439> pull<00:01:55.649> it<00:01:55.740> off<00:01:56.060> and<00:01:57.060> that's<00:01:57.719> all<00:01:58.049> there

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
kind of pull it off and that's all there

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.139 
kind of pull it off and that's all there
so<00:01:59.880> I'm<00:02:00.390> sure<00:02:00.450> that<00:02:00.780> I'll<00:02:01.049> tell<00:02:01.259> you<00:02:01.320> what<00:02:02.149> I'm

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
so I'm sure that I'll tell you what I'm

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.730 
so I'm sure that I'll tell you what I'm
gonna<00:02:03.270> move<00:02:03.479> it<00:02:03.600> up<00:02:03.719> a<00:02:03.840> little<00:02:03.960> bit<00:02:04.200> I'm<00:02:04.560> gonna

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
gonna move it up a little bit I'm gonna

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.619 
gonna move it up a little bit I'm gonna
make<00:02:04.979> a<00:02:05.240> floor<00:02:06.240> like<00:02:06.899> so<00:02:07.259> so<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:08.039> same<00:02:08.250> and

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:08.629 
make a floor like so so the same and

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:11.270 
make a floor like so so the same and
which<00:02:09.629> the<00:02:09.869> displace<00:02:10.200> is<00:02:10.379> in<00:02:10.530> and

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
which the displace is in and

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.190 
which the displace is in and
and<00:02:12.120> that<00:02:12.240> literally<00:02:12.600> this<00:02:12.690> is<00:02:12.750> how<00:02:12.959> you<00:02:13.020> use<00:02:13.170> a

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
and that literally this is how you use a

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.590 
and that literally this is how you use a
dysplasia<00:02:13.620> dragula<00:02:13.980> child<00:02:14.430> you<00:02:15.090> can<00:02:15.209> do<00:02:15.390> many

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
dysplasia dragula child you can do many

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.750 
dysplasia dragula child you can do many
different<00:02:15.720> effects<00:02:16.490> I'm<00:02:17.490> going<00:02:17.640> to<00:02:17.700> be

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
different effects I'm going to be

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.040 
different effects I'm going to be
working<00:02:18.060> on<00:02:18.150> this<00:02:18.300> kind<00:02:18.450> of<00:02:18.540> effect<00:02:18.810> that<00:02:18.900> we

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
working on this kind of effect that we

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.059 
working on this kind of effect that we
created<00:02:19.380> here<00:02:19.650> so<00:02:20.400> determine<00:02:20.790> this<00:02:21.170> and<00:02:22.170> fall

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
created here so determine this and fall

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.390 
created here so determine this and fall
off<00:02:23.280> if<00:02:23.490> you<00:02:23.550> go<00:02:23.670> to<00:02:23.880> shape<00:02:24.150> and<00:02:24.450> you<00:02:24.569> go<00:02:24.660> to<00:02:24.720> box

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
off if you go to shape and you go to box

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.620 
off if you go to shape and you go to box
and<00:02:26.400> kind<00:02:26.610> of<00:02:26.670> stretch<00:02:26.880> out<00:02:27.090> the<00:02:27.240> box<00:02:27.450> just

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
and kind of stretch out the box just

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.870 
and kind of stretch out the box just
sort<00:02:27.840> of<00:02:27.900> kind<00:02:28.050> of<00:02:28.110> fills<00:02:29.069> out<00:02:29.310> the<00:02:29.520> sphere

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
sort of kind of fills out the sphere

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.590 
sort of kind of fills out the sphere
like<00:02:30.810> so<00:02:31.260> and<00:02:31.560> then<00:02:32.459> also<00:02:32.730> if<00:02:33.060> you're<00:02:33.209> going<00:02:33.239> to

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
like so and then also if you're going to

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.960 
like so and then also if you're going to
object<00:02:34.140> and<00:02:34.739> strengthen<00:02:35.489> if<00:02:35.580> you<00:02:35.640> increase

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
object and strengthen if you increase

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.510 
object and strengthen if you increase
the<00:02:36.120> strength<00:02:36.450> you<00:02:37.140> see<00:02:37.709> the<00:02:37.860> way<00:02:38.010> things<00:02:38.069> seem

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
the strength you see the way things seem

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.340 
the strength you see the way things seem
to<00:02:38.580> happen<00:02:38.850> as<00:02:39.480> well<00:02:39.630> as<00:02:39.750> you<00:02:39.870> can<00:02:39.930> change<00:02:40.170> the

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
to happen as well as you can change the

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.040 
to happen as well as you can change the
height<00:02:40.610> you've<00:02:41.610> got<00:02:41.790> a<00:02:41.819> very<00:02:41.970> way<00:02:42.209> kind<00:02:43.020> of

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
height you've got a very way kind of

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.199 
height you've got a very way kind of
abstract<00:02:43.440> shape<00:02:43.650> to<00:02:43.800> happen<00:02:44.070> also<00:02:44.940> this<00:02:45.090> is

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
abstract shape to happen also this is

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.060 
abstract shape to happen also this is
actually<00:02:45.450> a<00:02:45.480> very<00:02:45.600> good<00:02:45.690> way<00:02:45.959> to<00:02:46.260> create<00:02:46.860> them

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
actually a very good way to create them

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.400 
actually a very good way to create them
quick<00:02:47.280> abstract<00:02:47.730> shapes<00:02:48.000> also<00:02:48.900> if<00:02:49.019> you<00:02:49.230> use

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
quick abstract shapes also if you use

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.350 
quick abstract shapes also if you use
this<00:02:49.530> to<00:02:49.709> text<00:02:50.130> as<00:02:50.250> well<00:02:50.430> you<00:02:51.030> can<00:02:51.150> cut<00:02:51.330> a

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
this to text as well you can cut a

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.420 
this to text as well you can cut a
keyframe<00:02:51.840> it<00:02:52.110> and<00:02:52.230> so<00:02:52.709> it<00:02:52.830> kind<00:02:52.980> of<00:02:53.010> comes<00:02:53.220> into

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
keyframe it and so it kind of comes into

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.520 
keyframe it and so it kind of comes into
the<00:02:53.550> abstract<00:02:53.850> mesh<00:02:54.300> or<00:02:54.450> whatever<00:02:54.720> kind<00:02:55.470> of

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
the abstract mesh or whatever kind of

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.229 
the abstract mesh or whatever kind of
evolves<00:02:55.920> into<00:02:56.040> the<00:02:56.250> text<00:02:56.640> that's<00:02:56.760> a<00:02:56.910> good<00:02:57.090> way

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
evolves into the text that's a good way

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.470 
evolves into the text that's a good way
there<00:02:57.540> nice<00:02:58.380> effect<00:02:58.800> and<00:02:59.120> I've<00:03:00.120> already<00:03:00.239> been

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
there nice effect and I've already been

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.199 
there nice effect and I've already been
used<00:03:00.690> I've<00:03:00.870> been<00:03:00.989> perfectly<00:03:01.350> honest<00:03:01.970> so<00:03:02.970> back

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
used I've been perfectly honest so back

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.690 
used I've been perfectly honest so back
at<00:03:03.360> this<00:03:03.510> blazer<00:03:04.280> we<00:03:05.280> obviously<00:03:05.370> don't<00:03:05.580> want

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
at this blazer we obviously don't want

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.910 
at this blazer we obviously don't want
that<00:03:05.970> strong<00:03:06.269> so<00:03:06.750> turn<00:03:07.140> down<00:03:07.380> the<00:03:07.560> strength

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
that strong so turn down the strength

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.160 
that strong so turn down the strength
and<00:03:08.340> the<00:03:08.940> height<00:03:09.350> and<00:03:10.430> can<00:03:11.430> implode<00:03:11.790> it<00:03:12.000> out

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
and the height and can implode it out

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.680 
and the height and can implode it out
yeah<00:03:13.170> and<00:03:13.530> then<00:03:13.800> we're<00:03:13.890> going<00:03:14.069> to<00:03:14.160> drag<00:03:14.400> the

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
yeah and then we're going to drag the

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.170 
yeah and then we're going to drag the
box<00:03:15.690> to<00:03:15.989> the<00:03:16.110> top<00:03:16.440> like<00:03:16.980> so<00:03:17.010> as<00:03:17.670> you<00:03:17.880> only<00:03:18.000> want

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
box to the top like so as you only want

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.050 
box to the top like so as you only want
it<00:03:18.239> to<00:03:18.450> affect<00:03:19.170> the<00:03:19.530> top<00:03:19.769> of<00:03:19.920> the<00:03:20.040> sphere<00:03:20.100> this

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
it to affect the top of the sphere this

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.850 
it to affect the top of the sphere this
can<00:03:21.209> work<00:03:21.329> whenever<00:03:21.540> you<00:03:22.320> can<00:03:22.470> drag<00:03:22.650> it<00:03:22.739> to<00:03:22.829> the

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
can work whenever you can drag it to the

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.490 
can work whenever you can drag it to the
bottom<00:03:23.130> of<00:03:23.220> a<00:03:23.310> sphere<00:03:23.549> should<00:03:23.850> you<00:03:24.030> wish<00:03:24.500> I'm

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
bottom of a sphere should you wish I'm

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.199 
bottom of a sphere should you wish I'm
not<00:03:25.650> drag<00:03:25.829> to<00:03:25.950> the<00:03:26.040> top<00:03:26.100> of<00:03:26.549> the<00:03:26.640> time<00:03:26.880> being

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
not drag to the top of the time being

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:32.330 
not drag to the top of the time being
like<00:03:28.049> so<00:03:29.630> and<00:03:30.630> that's<00:03:30.930> not<00:03:31.079> as<00:03:31.290> jagged<00:03:31.920> as<00:03:32.100> the

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
like so and that's not as jagged as the

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:33.680 
like so and that's not as jagged as the
one<00:03:32.489> so<00:03:32.670> obviously<00:03:32.910> just<00:03:33.120> need<00:03:33.239> to<00:03:33.360> literally

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
one so obviously just need to literally

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.020 
one so obviously just need to literally
play<00:03:33.930> around<00:03:34.230> with<00:03:35.100> the<00:03:35.190> strength<00:03:35.519> settings

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
play around with the strength settings

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:41.060 
play around with the strength settings
and<00:03:36.299> the<00:03:37.170> height<00:03:37.640> and<00:03:38.640> whatnot<00:03:39.540> and<00:03:40.010> to<00:03:41.010> be

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
and the height and whatnot and to be

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.509 
and the height and whatnot and to be
perfectly<00:03:41.549> honest<00:03:42.019> that<00:03:43.019> is<00:03:43.079> it<00:03:43.380> as<00:03:44.190> you<00:03:44.340> see

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
perfectly honest that is it as you see

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:47.090 
perfectly honest that is it as you see
if<00:03:44.670> you<00:03:44.760> render<00:03:44.970> this<00:03:45.150> out<00:03:45.299> here<00:03:45.950> and<00:03:46.950> it's

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
if you render this out here and it's

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.130 
if you render this out here and it's
really<00:03:47.280> jagged<00:03:47.670> the<00:03:48.450> ends<00:03:48.720> it<00:03:48.780> probably<00:03:49.019> kind

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
really jagged the ends it probably kind

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.470 
really jagged the ends it probably kind
of<00:03:49.200> smooth<00:03:49.500> out<00:03:49.709> I<00:03:50.010> put<00:03:50.609> two<00:03:50.760> hypernurbs

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
of smooth out I put two hypernurbs

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.300 
of smooth out I put two hypernurbs
and<00:03:51.630> drug<00:03:51.810> the<00:03:51.959> sphere<00:03:52.290> as<00:03:52.500> a<00:03:52.650> child<00:03:53.010> of<00:03:53.220> the

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
and drug the sphere as a child of the

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.000 
and drug the sphere as a child of the
hypernurbs<00:03:53.850> like<00:03:54.630> so<00:03:54.989> and<00:03:55.500> then<00:03:55.620> again<00:03:55.650> you

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
hypernurbs like so and then again you

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.940 
hypernurbs like so and then again you
get<00:03:56.160> a<00:03:56.190> really<00:03:56.519> nice<00:03:56.640> effect<00:03:56.700> is<00:03:57.739> so<00:03:58.739> weird

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
get a really nice effect is so weird

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.810 
get a really nice effect is so weird
effect<00:03:59.310> it<00:04:00.269> kind<00:04:00.450> of<00:04:00.480> makes<00:04:01.400> can<00:04:02.400> we<00:04:02.519> describe

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
effect it kind of makes can we describe

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.849 
effect it kind of makes can we describe
it<00:04:03.120> but<00:04:03.810> this<00:04:03.900> kind<00:04:04.079> of<00:04:04.140> runs<00:04:04.350> off<00:04:04.560> the<00:04:04.650> edges

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:04.859 
it but this kind of runs off the edges

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:07.400 
it but this kind of runs off the edges
makes<00:04:05.280> it<00:04:05.430> smooth<00:04:05.730> so<00:04:06.480> get<00:04:06.660> all<00:04:06.810> the<00:04:06.959> jagged<00:04:07.320> if

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
makes it smooth so get all the jagged if

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.830 
makes it smooth so get all the jagged if
I'm<00:04:07.620> in<00:04:07.709> the<00:04:07.799> middle<00:04:07.980> change<00:04:08.880> the<00:04:09.120> subdivision

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
I'm in the middle change the subdivision

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.630 
I'm in the middle change the subdivision
editor<00:04:10.260> for<00:04:11.130> example<00:04:11.400> if<00:04:11.459> change<00:04:11.670> to<00:04:11.850> one<00:04:13.640> will

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
editor for example if change to one will

be<00:04:14.760> jagged<00:04:15.420> like<00:04:15.690> it<00:04:15.810> just<00:04:16.019> was<00:04:17.209> you<00:04:18.209> know<00:04:18.269> it

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
be jagged like it just was you know it

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.960 
be jagged like it just was you know it
took<00:04:18.600> five<00:04:18.959> or<00:04:18.989> whatever<00:04:19.519> energy<00:04:20.519> just<00:04:20.789> the

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
took five or whatever energy just the

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.650 
took five or whatever energy just the
scale<00:04:21.180> of<00:04:21.419> how<00:04:22.140> smooth<00:04:22.530> or<00:04:22.800> how<00:04:22.919> many<00:04:22.979> segments

scale of how smooth or how many segments
since<00:04:24.530> on<00:04:24.650> 2<00:04:24.890> and<00:04:25.070> that<00:04:25.160> was<00:04:25.250> fine<00:04:25.460> so<00:04:26.170> there<00:04:27.170> we

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
since on 2 and that was fine so there we

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.440 
since on 2 and that was fine so there we
go<00:04:27.350> a<00:04:27.800> nice<00:04:28.520> effect

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:29.450 
go a nice effect

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:32.860 
go a nice effect
