 tomorrow and if I can put change point of 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.650
 pressure to the conception of the player you 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.260
 I give here 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.020
 all right 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:53.500
 now in the inventory 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:55.360
 these objects will not resemble the 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.550
 that we have in the inventory currently 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.010
 we give him here this is because it's from 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.510
 wood for example and if we want to put 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.390

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.940

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.960

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:20.080
 I do not know if above all it counts but I have done 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:23.500
 here a little cut because I have a 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:27.280
 maximum time in the video and good that 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:29.810

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.010
 and look, we want an emerald block 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.500
