fearless<00:00:46.410> player<00:00:47.070> I<00:00:47.339> mean<00:00:47.579> this<00:00:47.789> is<00:00:47.999> just<00:00:48.030> a

00:00:48.349 --> 00:00:48.359 
fearless player I mean this is just a

fearless player I mean this is just a
crazy<00:00:48.989> game<00:00:49.440> play<00:00:49.800> he's<00:00:50.339> hopping<00:00:50.730> into<00:00:50.850> the

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
crazy game play he's hopping into the

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.939 
crazy game play he's hopping into the
enemy's<00:00:51.359> faces<00:00:51.809> he's<00:00:52.050> sliding<00:00:52.350> all<00:00:52.620> around

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
enemy's faces he's sliding all around

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.889 
enemy's faces he's sliding all around
constantly<00:00:53.249> moving<00:00:53.789> keeping<00:00:54.149> that<00:00:54.269> momentum

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
constantly moving keeping that momentum

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.989 
constantly moving keeping that momentum
all<00:00:55.199> with<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.679> ASM<00:00:56.190> one<00:00:56.429> and<00:00:56.670> you<00:00:56.730> can<00:00:56.760> see

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:56.999 
all with the ASM one and you can see

00:00:56.999 --> 00:00:58.160 
all with the ASM one and you can see
that<00:00:57.030> this<00:00:57.210> class<00:00:57.449> setup<00:00:57.719> is<00:00:57.839> pretty<00:00:57.929> unique

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
that this class setup is pretty unique

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.619 
that this class setup is pretty unique
as<00:00:58.469> well<00:00:58.710> using<00:00:59.339> the<00:00:59.460> ASM<00:00:59.909> one<00:01:00.120> magnitude

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
as well using the ASM one magnitude

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:01.669 
as well using the ASM one magnitude
which<00:01:00.780> already<00:01:00.929> gives<00:01:01.170> you<00:01:01.289> a<00:01:01.319> little<00:01:01.440> bit<00:01:01.559> of

00:01:01.669 --> 00:01:01.679 
which already gives you a little bit of

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:03.349 
which already gives you a little bit of
extra<00:01:01.859> range<00:01:02.249> and<00:01:02.519> here's<00:01:02.940> where<00:01:03.089> it<00:01:03.210> comes

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
extra range and here's where it comes

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:04.759 
extra range and here's where it comes
into<00:01:03.510> question<00:01:03.690> I'm<00:01:04.050> not<00:01:04.260> actually<00:01:04.440> sure<00:01:04.620> if

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
into question I'm not actually sure if

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.770 
into question I'm not actually sure if
he's<00:01:05.010> using<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.700> advanced<00:01:06.000> rifling<00:01:06.450> or<00:01:06.600> not

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
he's using the advanced rifling or not

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.120 
he's using the advanced rifling or not
you<00:01:07.140> can<00:01:07.290> clearly<00:01:07.500> see<00:01:07.740> that<00:01:07.770> he's<00:01:07.979> got

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
you can clearly see that he's got

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.590 
you can clearly see that he's got
extended<00:01:08.460> magazines<00:01:08.940> in<00:01:09.120> there<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:09.450> a

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
extended magazines in there and a

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.360 
extended magazines in there and a
foregrip<00:01:09.990> so<00:01:10.440> there's<00:01:10.650> two<00:01:10.860> off<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.040> bat<00:01:11.190> but

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:11.370 
foregrip so there's two off the bat but

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.340 
foregrip so there's two off the bat but
you<00:01:11.640> can<00:01:11.820> also<00:01:11.970> see<00:01:12.210> that<00:01:12.240> he's<00:01:12.479> using<00:01:12.690> the<00:01:12.840> UAV

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
you can also see that he's using the UAV

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.200 
you can also see that he's using the UAV
and<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.890> system<00:01:14.310> hack<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:14.729> I<00:01:14.820> think<00:01:15.090> that

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
and the system hack and I think that

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.789 
and the system hack and I think that
that's<00:01:15.300> pretty<00:01:15.630> ingenious<00:01:15.900> it's<00:01:16.439> really

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
that's pretty ingenious it's really

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.679 
that's pretty ingenious it's really
really<00:01:17.070> smart<00:01:17.369> using<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:17.969> system<00:01:18.149> hack<00:01:18.479> to

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
really smart using the system hack to

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.630 
really smart using the system hack to
basically<00:01:19.020> disorient<00:01:19.710> your<00:01:19.890> enemies<00:01:20.219> while

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
basically disorient your enemies while

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.550 
basically disorient your enemies while
using<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.030> UAV<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:21.689> point<00:01:21.960> them<00:01:22.079> out<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.350> show

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
using the UAV to point them out and show

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.959 
using the UAV to point them out and show
you<00:01:22.619> where<00:01:22.860> you<00:01:23.009> need<00:01:23.040> to<00:01:23.189> go<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.460> kill<00:01:23.759> them

00:01:23.959 --> 00:01:23.969 
you where you need to go to kill them

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:25.730 
you where you need to go to kill them
that's<00:01:24.450> great<00:01:24.840> and<00:01:25.049> that<00:01:25.200> makes<00:01:25.409> for<00:01:25.590> a<00:01:25.619> really

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
that's great and that makes for a really

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.139 
that's great and that makes for a really
entertaining<00:01:26.070> gameplay<00:01:26.670> because<00:01:26.850> if<00:01:27.060> you're

00:01:27.139 --> 00:01:27.149 
entertaining gameplay because if you're

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:29.029 
entertaining gameplay because if you're
constantly<00:01:27.360> hopping<00:01:27.869> around<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.140> map<00:01:28.350> moving

00:01:29.029 --> 00:01:29.039 
constantly hopping around the map moving

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:30.440 
constantly hopping around the map moving
navigating<00:01:29.670> making<00:01:29.969> sure<00:01:30.149> that<00:01:30.360> you're

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
navigating making sure that you're

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.330 
navigating making sure that you're
always<00:01:30.659> up<00:01:30.990> close<00:01:31.409> and<00:01:31.649> personal<00:01:31.710> in<00:01:32.250> your

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
always up close and personal in your

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.730 
always up close and personal in your
enemies<00:01:33.090> faces<00:01:33.539> they'll<00:01:33.960> never<00:01:33.990> expect<00:01:34.469> it

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
enemies faces they'll never expect it

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.350 
enemies faces they'll never expect it
especially<00:01:35.310> while<00:01:35.460> you<00:01:35.579> have<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:35.759> system<00:01:36.149> hack

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
especially while you have a system hack

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.330 
especially while you have a system hack
active<00:01:36.899> and<00:01:37.110> he<00:01:37.409> even<00:01:37.500> went<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.890> extra<00:01:37.920> mile

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
active and he even went the extra mile

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.130 
active and he even went the extra mile
and<00:01:38.369> put<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.789> extra<00:01:39.030> time<00:01:39.299> bonuses<00:01:39.810> on<00:01:39.960> there

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
and put the extra time bonuses on there

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
so it's going to last even longer and

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:46.099 
so it's going to last even longer and

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
as you can see we already have one in

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.730 
as you can see we already have one in
our<00:01:47.700> inventory<00:01:48.060> which<00:01:48.810> means<00:01:49.079> we<00:01:49.259> need<00:01:49.439> two

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
our inventory which means we need two

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.459 
our inventory which means we need two
more<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:50.280> get<00:01:50.460> this<00:01:50.670> thing<00:01:50.729> truly<00:01:51.479> rolling<00:01:52.109> but

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:52.469 
more to get this thing truly rolling but

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:53.569 
more to get this thing truly rolling but
let's<00:01:52.649> talk<00:01:52.799> a<00:01:52.859> little<00:01:52.979> bit<00:01:53.219> about<00:01:53.340> pub

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
let's talk a little bit about pub

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.010 
let's talk a little bit about pub
stomping<00:01:54.030> as<00:01:54.149> well<00:01:54.329> because<00:01:54.630> there's<00:01:54.810> a<00:01:54.869> lot

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
stomping as well because there's a lot

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.999 
stomping as well because there's a lot
of<00:01:55.049> people<00:01:55.289> that<00:01:55.409> have<00:01:55.439> personally<00:01:55.950> been

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
of people that have personally been

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.590 
of people that have personally been
asking<00:01:56.460> me<00:01:56.640> how<00:01:56.820> I<00:01:56.850> feel<00:01:57.179> about<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.539> whole

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
asking me how I feel about the whole

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.480 
asking me how I feel about the whole
situation<00:01:57.780> and<00:01:58.350> honestly<00:01:58.890> I<00:01:58.979> see<00:01:59.219> it<00:01:59.310> as<00:01:59.369> an

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
situation and honestly I see it as an

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.069 
situation and honestly I see it as an
art<00:01:59.640> form<00:01:59.700> especially<00:02:00.090> if<00:02:00.390> you<00:02:00.450> play<00:02:00.630> this<00:02:00.840> way

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
art form especially if you play this way

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.289 
art form especially if you play this way
like<00:02:01.530> pup<00:02:01.770> stopping<00:02:02.219> can<00:02:02.369> go<00:02:02.520> two<00:02:02.579> different

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
like pup stopping can go two different

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.899 
like pup stopping can go two different
directions<00:02:03.390> you<00:02:03.840> can<00:02:03.869> have<00:02:04.140> a<00:02:04.670> group<00:02:05.670> of<00:02:05.759> your

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
directions you can have a group of your

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.910 
directions you can have a group of your
friends<00:02:05.969> actually<00:02:06.479> spawn<00:02:06.899> trapping<00:02:07.259> for<00:02:07.740> you

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
friends actually spawn trapping for you

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.590 
friends actually spawn trapping for you
and<00:02:08.160> you<00:02:08.280> can<00:02:08.399> get<00:02:08.580> all<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:08.729> DNA<00:02:09.060> bombs<00:02:09.390> you

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
and you can get all the DNA bombs you

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.999 
and you can get all the DNA bombs you
want<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:09.899> world<00:02:10.050> or<00:02:10.320> you<00:02:10.470> could<00:02:10.619> be<00:02:10.740> like

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
want the world or you could be like

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.820 
want the world or you could be like

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
clues and be playing solo and just show

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.500 
clues and be playing solo and just show
how<00:02:13.980> badass<00:02:14.250> you<00:02:14.400> could<00:02:14.670> truly<00:02:14.850> be<00:02:15.000> and<00:02:15.360> that's

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
how badass you could truly be and that's

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:16.760 
how badass you could truly be and that's
what<00:02:15.630> I<00:02:15.660> really<00:02:15.930> like<00:02:16.080> about<00:02:16.110> this<00:02:16.500> gameplay

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
what I really like about this gameplay

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.710 
what I really like about this gameplay
another<00:02:17.580> reason<00:02:17.760> that<00:02:17.910> this<00:02:18.120> shines<00:02:18.390> is<00:02:18.570> it's

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
another reason that this shines is it's

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.270 
another reason that this shines is it's
in<00:02:18.870> domination<00:02:19.500> you<00:02:19.770> can<00:02:19.920> see<00:02:20.040> that<00:02:20.069> the

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
in domination you can see that the

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.339 
in domination you can see that the
objective<00:02:20.760> is<00:02:20.879> constantly<00:02:21.420> being<00:02:21.659> played<00:02:22.080> and

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349 
objective is constantly being played and

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:23.540 
objective is constantly being played and
that<00:02:22.560> is<00:02:22.680> another<00:02:22.920> thing<00:02:23.010> I<00:02:23.250> want<00:02:23.430> to<00:02:23.489> point

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
that is another thing I want to point

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.640 
that is another thing I want to point
out<00:02:23.940> even<00:02:24.840> with<00:02:25.140> this

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
out even with this

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.250 
out even with this
solo<00:02:26.220> play<00:02:26.549> right<00:02:26.849> here<00:02:27.299> he's<00:02:27.689> got<00:02:27.840> a<00:02:27.870> bunch<00:02:28.110> of

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
solo play right here he's got a bunch of

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.750 
solo play right here he's got a bunch of
random<00:02:28.560> people<00:02:28.680> that<00:02:28.890> are<00:02:29.159> constantly<00:02:29.370> going

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
random people that are constantly going

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:30.949 
random people that are constantly going
for<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.060> sea<00:02:30.239> objective<00:02:30.689> for<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:30.930> a

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
for the sea objective for the a

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.869 
for the sea objective for the a
objective<00:02:31.620> and<00:02:31.860> flipping<00:02:32.250> and<00:02:32.370> flopping<00:02:32.579> the

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
objective and flipping and flopping the

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:34.759 
objective and flipping and flopping the
spawns<00:02:33.150> all<00:02:33.450> around<00:02:33.900> that<00:02:34.470> would<00:02:34.590> make<00:02:34.739> it

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
spawns all around that would make it

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:37.160 
spawns all around that would make it
really<00:02:35.340> really<00:02:35.370> interesting<00:02:35.909> for<00:02:36.629> not<00:02:36.930> only<00:02:37.049> a

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
really really interesting for not only a

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.199 
really really interesting for not only a
solo<00:02:37.470> player<00:02:37.829> but<00:02:38.340> for<00:02:38.489> any<00:02:38.640> player<00:02:38.970> in<00:02:39.000> the

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
solo player but for any player in the

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:40.670 
solo player but for any player in the
game<00:02:39.329> because<00:02:39.540> the<00:02:39.810> spawns<00:02:40.110> would<00:02:40.290> constantly

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
game because the spawns would constantly

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.619 
game because the spawns would constantly
be<00:02:40.739> flipping<00:02:41.280> as<00:02:41.430> well<00:02:41.760> so<00:02:42.239> that's<00:02:42.359> why<00:02:42.569> you

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
be flipping as well so that's why you

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:44.750 
be flipping as well so that's why you
have<00:02:42.870> to<00:02:43.049> see<00:02:43.319> that<00:02:43.650> this<00:02:43.859> is<00:02:44.099> such<00:02:44.459> a<00:02:44.489> unique

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
have to see that this is such a unique

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.880 
have to see that this is such a unique
and<00:02:45.239> awesome<00:02:45.420> gameplay<00:02:45.930> because<00:02:46.739> you'll

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
and awesome gameplay because you'll

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.440 
and awesome gameplay because you'll
never<00:02:46.950> know<00:02:47.370> where<00:02:47.609> an<00:02:47.730> enemy<00:02:47.849> could<00:02:48.209> spawn

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
never know where an enemy could spawn

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.059 
never know where an enemy could spawn
especially<00:02:48.959> when<00:02:49.079> you're<00:02:49.200> rushing<00:02:49.620> as<00:02:49.769> hard

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
especially when you're rushing as hard

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:52.280 
especially when you're rushing as hard
as<00:02:50.220> he<00:02:50.400> is<00:02:50.519> in<00:02:50.760> this<00:02:50.909> game<00:02:51.180> play<00:02:51.450> and<00:02:51.629> one<00:02:52.109> thing

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
as he is in this game play and one thing

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.140 
as he is in this game play and one thing
that<00:02:52.319> I<00:02:52.470> do<00:02:52.560> want<00:02:52.829> to<00:02:52.920> say<00:02:53.099> is<00:02:53.280> the<00:02:53.760> use<00:02:54.120> of

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
that I do want to say is the use of

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.910 
that I do want to say is the use of
peripherals<00:02:54.930> in<00:02:55.170> this<00:02:55.319> gameplay<00:02:55.530> is

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
peripherals in this gameplay is

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.619 
peripherals in this gameplay is
ridiculously<00:02:56.549> awesome<00:02:56.760> as<00:02:57.030> well<00:02:57.209> because<00:02:57.480> you

00:02:57.619 --> 00:02:57.629 
ridiculously awesome as well because you

00:02:57.629 --> 00:02:59.720 
ridiculously awesome as well because you
don't<00:02:57.840> often<00:02:58.109> see<00:02:58.290> people<00:02:58.470> use<00:02:58.980> that<00:02:59.190> perk<00:02:59.519> and

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
don't often see people use that perk and

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.250 
don't often see people use that perk and
you<00:03:00.030> can<00:03:00.150> see<00:03:00.329> with<00:03:00.540> the<00:03:00.690> mini-map<00:03:01.019> that's

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
you can see with the mini-map that's

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.629 
you can see with the mini-map that's
elongated<00:03:01.739> sort<00:03:02.040> of<00:03:02.099> like<00:03:02.220> the<00:03:02.340> ghost

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:02.639 
elongated sort of like the ghost

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:04.430 
elongated sort of like the ghost
variation<00:03:03.299> of<00:03:03.450> it<00:03:03.569> where<00:03:03.959> it's<00:03:04.079> a<00:03:04.109> little<00:03:04.349> bit

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
variation of it where it's a little bit

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.319 
variation of it where it's a little bit
longer<00:03:04.620> than<00:03:04.950> usual<00:03:04.980> I<00:03:05.459> really<00:03:05.879> like<00:03:06.090> the<00:03:06.299> use

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:06.329 
longer than usual I really like the use

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:08.300 
longer than usual I really like the use
of<00:03:06.480> that<00:03:06.810> because<00:03:07.200> not<00:03:07.440> only<00:03:07.470> is<00:03:07.709> the<00:03:07.920> UAV

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
of that because not only is the UAV

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.099 
of that because not only is the UAV
going<00:03:08.519> to<00:03:08.579> play<00:03:08.730> a<00:03:08.760> bigger<00:03:09.030> role<00:03:09.150> in<00:03:09.569> how<00:03:10.049> you

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:10.109 
going to play a bigger role in how you

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:12.199 
going to play a bigger role in how you
play<00:03:10.470> and<00:03:10.859> tackle<00:03:11.280> the<00:03:11.430> enemies<00:03:11.760> that<00:03:11.939> are<00:03:12.000> at

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
play and tackle the enemies that are at

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.509 
play and tackle the enemies that are at
hand<00:03:12.450> but<00:03:12.840> using<00:03:13.200> peripherals<00:03:13.799> is<00:03:14.040> always

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
hand but using peripherals is always

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:16.280 
hand but using peripherals is always
going<00:03:14.730> to<00:03:14.970> test<00:03:15.239> your<00:03:15.420> patience<00:03:15.870> as<00:03:16.049> well

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
going to test your patience as well

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.309 
going to test your patience as well
because<00:03:16.950> a<00:03:17.310> lot<00:03:17.579> of<00:03:17.609> people<00:03:17.879> don't<00:03:18.030> know<00:03:18.090> this

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:18.319 
because a lot of people don't know this

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:20.270 
because a lot of people don't know this
peripherals<00:03:19.319> will<00:03:19.470> actually<00:03:19.829> make<00:03:19.950> it<00:03:20.099> so<00:03:20.220> if

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
peripherals will actually make it so if

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.099 
peripherals will actually make it so if
you<00:03:20.430> kill<00:03:20.639> an<00:03:20.790> enemy<00:03:20.939> they<00:03:21.359> won't<00:03:21.599> appear<00:03:22.079> on

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:22.109 
you kill an enemy they won't appear on

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:24.259 
you kill an enemy they won't appear on
their<00:03:22.680> enemies<00:03:23.189> screen<00:03:23.639> with<00:03:23.879> a<00:03:23.909> skull<00:03:24.239> above
