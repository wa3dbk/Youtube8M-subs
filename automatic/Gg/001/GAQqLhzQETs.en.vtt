00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.160 
I didn't want to lose such a great
friendship<00:01:35.610> and<00:01:35.939> she<00:01:36.090> didn't<00:01:36.900> know<00:01:36.960> how<00:01:37.079> to

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
friendship and she didn't know how to

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.630 
friendship and she didn't know how to
accept<00:01:37.500> that<00:01:37.650> I<00:01:37.710> think<00:01:37.920> we<00:01:38.009> share<00:01:38.159> like<00:01:38.340> two<00:01:38.549> or

accept that I think we share like two or

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.160 
accept that I think we share like two or
three<00:01:38.820> more<00:01:38.939> times<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.479> an<00:01:39.659> issue<00:01:39.810> kept

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
three more times and an issue kept

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.870 
three more times and an issue kept
coming<00:01:40.470> up<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:40.740> it<00:01:40.829> was<00:01:40.920> like<00:01:41.100> it<00:01:41.520> wasn't<00:01:41.790> like

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
coming up and it was like it wasn't like

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:42.770 
coming up and it was like it wasn't like
we<00:01:41.939> were<00:01:42.000> talking<00:01:42.210> about<00:01:42.390> it<00:01:42.630> was<00:01:42.720> like

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
we were talking about it was like

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.480 
we were talking about it was like
arguments<00:01:43.530> that<00:01:43.649> were<00:01:43.770> going<00:01:43.950> on<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.399> we

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
arguments that were going on and we

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.859 
arguments that were going on and we
never<00:01:44.790> argued<00:01:45.210> because<00:01:45.270> of<00:01:45.450> who<00:01:45.600> was<00:01:45.689> just

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
never argued because of who was just

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.990 
never argued because of who was just
friends<00:01:46.290> so<00:01:46.649> we<00:01:46.799> had<00:01:46.950> nothing<00:01:47.280> to<00:01:47.430> argue<00:01:47.520> about

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
friends so we had nothing to argue about

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.730 
friends so we had nothing to argue about
long<00:01:48.270> story<00:01:48.600> short<00:01:48.720> when<00:01:49.110> I<00:01:49.200> didn't<00:01:49.530> bow<00:01:49.710> down

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
long story short when I didn't bow down

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.920 
long story short when I didn't bow down
and<00:01:50.340> want<00:01:50.970> to<00:01:51.030> be<00:01:51.180> a<00:01:51.210> huntress<00:01:51.450> saying

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
and want to be a huntress saying

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.230 
and want to be a huntress saying
exclusive<00:01:52.619> or<00:01:52.740> do<00:01:52.950> what<00:01:53.340> I<00:01:53.369> originally<00:01:53.700> wanted

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
exclusive or do what I originally wanted

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.780 
exclusive or do what I originally wanted
to<00:01:54.450> do<00:01:54.659> with<00:01:55.110> her<00:01:55.320> she<00:01:55.979> couldn't<00:01:56.340> take<00:01:56.490> it<00:01:56.549> I

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
to do with her she couldn't take it I

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.310 
to do with her she couldn't take it I
guess<00:01:57.030> I<00:01:57.210> don't<00:01:57.420> know<00:01:57.570> she<00:01:57.659> was<00:01:57.869> just<00:01:58.049> used<00:01:58.229> to

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
guess I don't know she was just used to

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.719 
guess I don't know she was just used to
hearing<00:01:58.560> yes<00:01:58.860> all<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.159> time<00:01:59.340> and<00:01:59.520> when<00:01:59.610> I<00:01:59.640> told

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
hearing yes all the time and when I told

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.730 
hearing yes all the time and when I told
her<00:01:59.939> no<00:02:00.119> she<00:02:00.360> didn't<00:02:00.930> like<00:02:01.049> it<00:02:01.170> at<00:02:01.259> all<00:02:01.350> she

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
her no she didn't like it at all she

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.530 
her no she didn't like it at all she
eventually<00:02:01.979> gave<00:02:02.490> me<00:02:02.729> like<00:02:02.880> an<00:02:03.060> ultimatum

she should cut everything off which I

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.400 
she should cut everything off which I
could<00:02:24.340> respect<00:02:24.670> that<00:02:24.820> but<00:02:25.480> on<00:02:25.720> top<00:02:25.990> of<00:02:26.230> her

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
could respect that but on top of her

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.200 
could respect that but on top of her
cutting<00:02:26.770> everything<00:02:26.980> off<00:02:27.280> she<00:02:27.880> took<00:02:28.060> it<00:02:28.180> to

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.210 
cutting everything off she took it to

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.170 
cutting everything off she took it to
