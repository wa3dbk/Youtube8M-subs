00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879 
you're using this as your controller a

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:01.479 
you're using this as your controller a
lot<00:00:59.420> of<00:00:59.539> guys<00:00:59.690> try<00:00:59.989> to<00:01:00.050> use<00:01:01.010> this<00:01:01.280> as<00:01:01.339> a

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
lot of guys try to use this as a

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:03.160 
lot of guys try to use this as a
controller<00:01:02.030> stopping<00:01:02.539> they<00:01:02.600> don't<00:01:02.780> wanna<00:01:02.899> be

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
controller stopping they don't wanna be

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.849 
controller stopping they don't wanna be
an<00:01:03.230> off-balance

00:01:03.849 --> 00:01:03.859 
an off-balance

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:05.710 
an off-balance
now<00:01:04.519> just<00:01:04.790> elevate<00:01:05.150> straight<00:01:05.420> up<00:01:05.540> in<00:01:05.630> the<00:01:05.659> air

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
now just elevate straight up in the air

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.360 
now just elevate straight up in the air
and<00:01:06.020> I<00:01:06.050> elevate<00:01:06.470> and<00:01:06.590> I<00:01:06.620> finish<00:01:06.920> over<00:01:07.130> the<00:01:07.190> top

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:07.370 
and I elevate and I finish over the top

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.520 
and I elevate and I finish over the top
so<00:01:08.300> now<00:01:08.480> it<00:01:08.630> really<00:01:08.780> doesn't<00:01:08.930> know<00:01:09.170> what<00:01:09.320> to<00:01:09.350> do

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
so now it really doesn't know what to do

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.230 
so now it really doesn't know what to do
as<00:01:09.830> a<00:01:10.130> defender<00:01:10.610> doesn't<00:01:10.790> know<00:01:10.940> if<00:01:11.030> I<00:01:11.060> will

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
as a defender doesn't know if I will

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.120 
as a defender doesn't know if I will
always<00:01:11.540> hit<00:01:11.630> basket<00:01:12.170> I'm<00:01:12.560> gonna<00:01:12.710> raise<00:01:12.860> up<00:01:13.040> a

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
always hit basket I'm gonna raise up a

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.340 
always hit basket I'm gonna raise up a

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
shoot I'm gonna stop pull up that's the

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:16.660 
shoot I'm gonna stop pull up that's the
key<00:01:15.530> about<00:01:15.680> the<00:01:15.799> pull-up<00:01:16.130> jump<00:01:16.369> shot<00:01:16.549> is

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
key about the pull-up jump shot is

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.550 
key about the pull-up jump shot is
taking<00:01:17.000> them<00:01:17.090> to<00:01:17.180> one<00:01:17.360> spot<00:01:17.630> then<00:01:18.110> raise<00:01:18.320> up

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
taking them to one spot then raise up

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.970 
taking them to one spot then raise up
over<00:01:18.770> the<00:01:18.860> top<00:01:19.040> shooter

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:20.980 
over the top shooter

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:25.750 
over the top shooter
so<00:01:22.420> the<00:01:23.420> hell<00:01:24.040> rest'<00:01:25.040> abs<00:01:25.220> we<00:01:25.400> can<00:01:25.520> shoot<00:01:25.640> the

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:25.760 
so the hell rest' abs we can shoot the

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.430 
so the hell rest' abs we can shoot the
jumper<00:01:26.060> drive<00:01:26.780> to<00:01:26.930> the<00:01:26.990> basket

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:27.440 
jumper drive to the basket

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.290 
jumper drive to the basket
we<00:01:27.620> got<00:01:27.740> a<00:01:27.770> mid-range<00:01:28.190> game<00:01:28.490> if<00:01:29.030> it's<00:01:29.210> an

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
it goes for it now there are two

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.370 
it goes for it now there are two
different<00:01:50.270> ways<00:01:50.420> of<00:01:50.570> stepping<00:01:50.960> through<00:01:51.110> a<00:01:51.260> lot

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
different ways of stepping through a lot

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.070 
different ways of stepping through a lot
of<00:01:51.500> times<00:01:51.760> if<00:01:52.760> I<00:01:52.880> pump<00:01:53.180> fake<00:01:53.420> and<00:01:53.690> I<00:01:53.780> create

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
of times if I pump fake and I create

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.050 
of times if I pump fake and I create
this<00:01:54.229> space<00:01:54.500> right<00:01:54.710> here<00:01:54.979> now<00:01:55.550> I'll<00:01:55.640> just<00:01:55.700> step

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
this space right here now I'll just step

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.940 
this space right here now I'll just step
on<00:01:56.240> through<00:01:56.420> right<00:01:56.660> here<00:01:56.690> a<00:01:56.990> lot<00:01:57.560> of<00:01:57.590> defenders

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
on through right here a lot of defenders

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.190 
on through right here a lot of defenders
are<00:01:58.160> very<00:01:58.369> physical<00:01:58.580> they<00:01:58.880> like<00:01:59.030> to<00:01:59.180> just<00:01:59.840> keep

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
row so now I'm reading on the weak side

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.449 
row so now I'm reading on the weak side
I'm<00:02:47.080> seeing<00:02:47.290> as<00:02:47.410> big<00:02:47.650> as<00:02:47.830> late<00:02:48.040> so<00:02:48.220> there's<00:02:48.400> a
