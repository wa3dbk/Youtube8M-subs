00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
then use the other half and have it

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.420 
then use the other half and have it
later<00:01:36.750> on<00:01:36.930> in<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.200> day<00:01:37.229> as<00:01:37.590> your<00:01:37.799> second<00:01:38.220> meal

sweaty more you're gonna get tired
quicker<00:05:33.389> and<00:05:33.960> you're<00:05:34.169> going<00:05:34.289> to<00:05:34.349> burn<00:05:34.529> more

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:34.770
