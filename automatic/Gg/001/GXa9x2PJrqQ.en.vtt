00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:08.370
 Hello and welcome last 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:11.219
 with him 23 like you see times today 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:14.670
 what else and a kite when where 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.529
 I died relatively early that's it 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:22.050
 unfortunately comes before it if you revenge four 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:26.039
 but is that happening I start 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:29.099
 Just city â€‹â€‹new and he has me then 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.390
 redone and so on you become 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:35.130
 probably remember that I 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:38.850
 just after commenting because 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:43.579
 I just think I would not go to 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:47.340
 We could have concentrated our play 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:48.980
 just made in the kites so that 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:55.050
 has been a bit more difficult 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:58.890
 but it works quite well so markus and 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:03.539
 I packed it so alone 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:06.960
 still had a damage hairstyle on markus 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:10.280
 I mean the human pumpkin, too 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.280
 strong against monster blabla 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.270
 But we also went without it 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.160
 tested 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.660
 but we just wanted one 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:23.260
 I'll see what's wrong 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:25.420
 and so has actually quite a lot of fun 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:28.720
 we are now definitely 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:31.000
 to be diligent when it comes to work 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:34.630
 create them together and then have to 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.920
 yes only two people are there and that's enough 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.350
 then that means you do not have to 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.050
 prepare and so on must stop 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.390
 but a few thousand years ago that's it 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.800
 then too 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.210
 I have no idea what we are up to 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.729
 but we will do the things 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.800
 Collect everything on a sheep and share 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:55.060
 then later on so that's just fair 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:58.510
 i think i might have one 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.820
 few quirin shoes off 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:04.180
 For that one needs a lot of claws and 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.990
 three sheds no i know but i do 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:10.099
 not yet 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:13.000
 but that's just a few 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:15.380
 things that would interest me 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.860
 I already need 80's armor 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:21.790
 I do not have one more but cool shoes 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:26.860
 I think you can not have enough 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:29.440
 and that 's why I think that' s me 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:34.489
 will prefer 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:39.440
 and yes, I 'm here in the video at 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:44.360
 kites up to 6 3 degrees not me 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:46.390
 no putts would have thrown 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:50.260
 actually the same 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:52.180
 closeness is still active so the 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.020
 part was shorter than the drank and 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:58.750
 therefore 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:03:03.610
 I wanted to wait until now ranking 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.610
 has expired from the long run ago 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.090
 I would have to go back to the 6 k 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:14.250
 do 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:17.610
 It's even a memorial to me 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:20.580
 of course, no comparison is acceptable 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:24.500
 to the body warrior so markus has to 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.500
 example i think 11k made 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.230
 what do you want 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:35.780
 are not native so the pvm 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:39.770
 soil you see, you are already relatively dead 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:42.440
 often with the kite if you have 418 more 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:48.130
 for example a couple of times over 30 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:56.569
 Give days and young everyone falls 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:04:00.319
 I had to stop about 26 ktp now 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:03.620
 the bios taken twice since I am 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:06.739
 ask again I do not know 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.660
 How much has been deducted from me? 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:11.280
 just blind it over one 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:15.790
 Speech bubble 1 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:18.790
 So I have to watch over youtube 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:21.400
 that I have no option because that already 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:25.030
 so close are so close 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:29.020
 a bit difficult because then yes 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:29.380
 also be hit by the kite 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.240
 can 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.340
 He makes you human beyond one 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:37.120
 half room 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:42.310
 the wonder no ek gets or so 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:47.010
 that is a bit more difficult 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:47.010
 but we are just finishing 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:54.370
 Now the phase will come where it likes 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:56.920
 so his poison helmet renger has one 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:05:02.960
 he still needs a little bit 

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:06.720
 but let's see what we have 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:12.280
 by already very pleased 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:15.400
 but very worthy was able to say so 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:17.910
 he later i cant do that 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.910
 too mean 

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:26.580
 He will soon see what we print 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.580
 I think you already had her poison 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:39.300
 It is almost as far as he almost goes 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:45.070
 bit still needed but we have 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:47.520
 Kraler shop and the line pressed 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:47.520
 G 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:52.449
 We were really looking forward to it 

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:54.849
 The pack on the chart bucket later 

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:57.909
 clear on everything 

00:05:54.849 --> 00:05:59.770
 that 's it if you liked it 

00:05:57.909 --> 00:06:01.120
 then he gives it up if it is you 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:03.099
 did not like thumb down then 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:06.250
 but write a bit why should 

00:06:03.099 --> 00:06:08.889
 I did not like it that's it 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:10.919
 then I'm out to greet you 

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:10.919
 ii
