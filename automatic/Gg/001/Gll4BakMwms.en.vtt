00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
water in the dough but as we stretch the

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.349 
water in the dough but as we stretch the
dough<00:00:57.809> all<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.920> water<00:00:59.100> will<00:00:59.340> get<00:00:59.460> absorbed<00:00:59.640> so

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
dough all the water will get absorbed so

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.830

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.900 
keep aside let's make one more button in
the<00:03:04.990> similar<00:03:05.350> way<00:03:05.500> so<00:03:05.709> we<00:03:06.220> have<00:03:06.250> rolled<00:03:06.640> both

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
the similar way so we have rolled both

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.180 
the similar way so we have rolled both
the<00:03:07.060> parathas<00:03:07.570> now<00:03:08.410> at<00:03:08.560> this<00:03:08.740> point<00:03:09.010> of<00:03:09.160> time

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
the parathas now at this point of time

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.070 
the parathas now at this point of time
you<00:03:10.150> can<00:03:10.300> sprinkle<00:03:10.630> little<00:03:10.990> bit<00:03:11.260> of<00:03:11.380> flour<00:03:11.709> and

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
you can sprinkle little bit of flour and

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.750 
you can sprinkle little bit of flour and
roll<00:03:14.080> it<00:03:14.260> out<00:03:14.440> into<00:03:14.650> a<00:03:14.830> thick<00:03:15.160> paratha

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
roll it out into a thick paratha

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.470 
roll it out into a thick paratha
make<00:03:16.510> sure<00:03:16.930> that<00:03:17.830> you<00:03:18.220> roll<00:03:18.430> it<00:03:18.580> out<00:03:18.700> lightly

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
make sure that you roll it out lightly

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.440 
make sure that you roll it out lightly
so<00:03:20.350> that<00:03:20.380> the<00:03:20.800> layers<00:03:21.100> are<00:03:21.459> not<00:03:21.700> pressed<00:03:22.090> and

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
so that the layers are not pressed and

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.870 
so that the layers are not pressed and
they<00:03:23.230> are<00:03:23.290> nice<00:03:23.500> and<00:03:23.800> separate<00:03:24.250> after<00:03:24.730> we'd

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
they are nice and separate after we'd

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:31.970 
they are nice and separate after we'd
roast<00:03:25.150> the<00:03:25.480> paratha<00:03:25.750> or<00:03:26.110> paratha

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.310 

so<00:03:32.980> paratha<00:03:33.459> is<00:03:33.519> now<00:03:33.700> rolled<00:03:34.000> put<00:03:34.900> it<00:03:35.019> on<00:03:35.170> the

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.320 
so paratha is now rolled put it on the

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.780 
so paratha is now rolled put it on the
hot<00:03:35.590> tawa<00:03:35.860> and<00:03:36.989> roast<00:03:37.989> on<00:03:38.260> medium<00:03:38.320> flame<00:03:38.950> till

sides once the underside is done we'll

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:45.810 
sides once the underside is done we'll
flip<00:03:44.440> it<00:03:44.500> and<00:03:44.830> we'll<00:03:45.190> cook<00:03:45.370> the<00:03:45.580> other<00:03:45.610> side
