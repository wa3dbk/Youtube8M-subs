today what we're gonna do is look at the
breeding<00:00:49.379> hints<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:50.100> direct<00:00:50.610> and<00:00:50.820> absolute

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
breeding hints the direct and absolute

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.580 
breeding hints the direct and absolute
combinations<00:00:52.640> that<00:00:53.640> was<00:00:53.820> given<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.510> us<00:00:54.629> as<00:00:55.410> you

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
combinations that was given to us as you

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.439 
combinations that was given to us as you
can<00:00:55.710> see<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:55.980> autumn<00:00:56.340> dragon<00:00:56.699> is<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:56.910> an

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
can see the autumn dragon is a an

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.729 
can see the autumn dragon is a an
element<00:00:57.989> of<00:00:58.670> fire<00:00:59.670> cold<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.690> air<00:01:01.230> so<00:01:01.530> you<00:01:01.620> have

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
element of fire cold and air so you have

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.080 
element of fire cold and air so you have
to<00:01:01.829> use<00:01:01.980> fire<00:01:02.250> cold<00:01:02.609> in<00:01:02.730> air<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:02.969> it's

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
to use fire cold in air and it's

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.350 
to use fire cold in air and it's
actually<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.480> element<00:01:03.870> of<00:01:03.960> seasonal<00:01:04.470> but

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
actually the element of seasonal but

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.030 
actually the element of seasonal but
these<00:01:06.360> are<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.689> hidden<00:01:06.900> elements<00:01:07.619> that<00:01:07.740> make

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
these are the hidden elements that make

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.580 
these are the hidden elements that make
up<00:01:08.070> this<00:01:08.549> dragon<00:01:09.150> so<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:09.689> get<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.409> dragon

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
up this dragon so to get the dragon

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.859 
up this dragon so to get the dragon
let's<00:01:10.920> tap<00:01:11.100> into<00:01:11.369> info<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:11.880> says<00:01:12.119> that<00:01:12.390> the

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
let's tap into info it says that the

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.560 
let's tap into info it says that the
breeding<00:01:13.229> pair<00:01:13.380> of<00:01:13.470> Dragons<00:01:13.830> must<00:01:14.040> contain

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
breeding pair of Dragons must contain

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.460 
breeding pair of Dragons must contain
fire<00:01:15.570> cold<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:16.470> air<00:01:16.770> elements<00:01:17.990> now<00:01:18.990> I'm<00:01:19.290> gonna

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
fire cold and air elements now I'm gonna

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.560 
fire cold and air elements now I'm gonna
use<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.920> most<00:01:20.159> simple<00:01:20.640> combination<00:01:21.299> in<00:01:21.420> my

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
use the most simple combination in my

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.950 
use the most simple combination in my
opinion<00:01:21.990> because<00:01:23.030> it's<00:01:24.030> easier<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:24.600> obtain

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
opinion because it's easier to obtain

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.929 
opinion because it's easier to obtain
based<00:01:25.530> on<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.799> Dragons<00:01:26.189> but<00:01:26.280> you<00:01:26.400> can<00:01:26.520> use<00:01:26.670> any

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
based on the Dragons but you can use any

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.300 
based on the Dragons but you can use any
other<00:01:27.060> combination<00:01:27.840> that<00:01:28.380> adds<00:01:28.439> up<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:28.979> these

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
other combination that adds up to these

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.230 
other combination that adds up to these
three<00:01:29.750> elements<00:01:30.750> now<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:32.130> cold<00:01:32.430> type<00:01:32.759> we<00:01:33.060> are

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
three elements now the cold type we are

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.850 
three elements now the cold type we are
going<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:33.750> use<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.110> snow<00:01:34.320> dragon<00:01:34.530> we're<00:01:34.770> gonna

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
going to use the snow dragon we're gonna

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.260 
going to use the snow dragon we're gonna
use<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.189> fire<00:01:35.400> dragon<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.909> snow<00:01:36.090> dragon

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
use the fire dragon the snow dragon

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.240 
use the fire dragon the snow dragon
we're<00:01:36.960> using<00:01:37.110> this<00:01:37.350> because<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.799> fire<00:01:38.009> dragon

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
we're using this because the fire dragon

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.190 
we're using this because the fire dragon
is<00:01:38.490> easy<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:38.909> obtain<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.450> snow<00:01:39.659> dragon<00:01:39.900> is

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
is easy to obtain the snow dragon is

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.870 
is easy to obtain the snow dragon is
easier<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:41.040> obtain<00:01:41.340> too<00:01:42.060> but<00:01:42.750> you<00:01:43.409> know<00:01:43.880> air

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
easier to obtain too but you know air

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.420 
easier to obtain too but you know air
element<00:01:45.509> oni<00:01:45.720> are<00:01:46.070> activated<00:01:47.070> at<00:01:47.189> level<00:01:47.460> 14<00:01:48.030> so

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
element oni are activated at level 14 so

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.580 
element oni are activated at level 14 so
you<00:01:50.430> can<00:01:50.610> use<00:01:50.790> something<00:01:51.149> like<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.450> blue<00:01:52.320> fire

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
you can use something like the blue fire

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.490 
you can use something like the blue fire
dragon<00:01:53.100> and<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:54.060> air<00:01:54.210> dragon<00:01:54.750> or<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.079> forest

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
dragon and the air dragon or the forest

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.260

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
dragon so that's just my opinion but if

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:16.789 
dragon so that's just my opinion but if
you're<00:03:15.540> watching<00:03:15.690> this<00:03:15.930> video<00:03:16.110> while<00:03:16.410> the

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
you're watching this video while the

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:19.759 
you're watching this video while the
dragons<00:03:17.280> already<00:03:17.579> expired<00:03:17.910> then<00:03:18.299> I<00:03:19.260> guess

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
dragons already expired then I guess

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:23.930 
dragons already expired then I guess
that<00:03:20.250> is<00:03:20.459> no<00:03:21.120> use<00:03:21.450> anyways<00:03:22.170> so<00:03:22.769> this<00:03:23.400> is<00:03:23.640> the

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
that is no use anyways so this is the

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.000

into the adult form and there's that
leaf<00:04:04.019> Kanna<00:04:04.380> explosion<00:04:04.980> again<00:04:05.100> and<00:04:05.459> that<00:04:06.000> that

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
leaf Kanna explosion again and that that

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:07.580 
leaf Kanna explosion again and that that
is<00:04:06.359> the<00:04:06.510> same<00:04:06.720> thing<00:04:06.930> it<00:04:07.019> comes<00:04:07.200> out<00:04:07.350> of<00:04:07.380> his
