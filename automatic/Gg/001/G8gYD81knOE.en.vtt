 new top 5 after five weeks 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.480
 of absence that I hope will not have been 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.650
 too long for you today we get 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.090
 was good for making your com 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.189

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.099
 previously again at the top twenty 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.359
 so who says top 5 10 new topics and 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.650
 the new subject today is not 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.480
 the one you voted for 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.339
 last time I'm sorry but 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.739
 since I had five weeks vacation 

00:00:35.339 --> 00:00:39.170
 I did not have the opportunity to 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.730
 prepare properly 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.379
 so I was able to prepare new topics 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.750
 today we talked about the modes 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.550
 useful so I'm doing it like that it's 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.640
 modes that are very useful to us 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.640

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.399

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.960
 serve you in fashion and short series 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.820
 all full of interesting test mode which 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.129
 walk all is forge and who I hope 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.809
 you will like it as usual 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.280
 do not hesitate to leave your opinion in 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.660
 the comments and do not forget that 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.940
 this video and ben du pure were released 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.590
 of my brain so basically it's 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.149
 exactly my opinion to me and you can 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.649
 have years of different opinions 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:17.130
 so do not hesitate to put them in 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:21.110
 comment 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.110
 here we go 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:29.430
 and we are good for this issue 5 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.560
 of this top 5 and we end up with the 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.509
 mode of everything but read haythem what 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.460
 is no longer widely used e beats 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.409
 today a foot more and more 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.610
 sad is why I put this mode in 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.140
 fifth position 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.960
 well because I find it very 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.420
 useful in relation to its functions 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.520
 of enchantment to create creation of 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.439
 potions and to create especially the fires 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.679
 fireworks that are quite complicated to 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:55.500
 created by crushing in survival I find 

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:56.670
 so I find it extremely useful by 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.289
 example of creating wide edges 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.610
 really it's a lot simpler 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:01.679
 because as you know they are only 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.420
 not available in creative and it's for 

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:05.429
 that I find this mode much more 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.110
 interesting if you want a tutorial 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:08.610
 complete on this mode to explain to you 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.080
 all the hidden functions every 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.970
 functions that could be interesting 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.310
 to show do not hesitate to put it to me 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.599
 comments I would not hesitate to 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.099
 do it because it's a mode that I like 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:18.900
 a lot even if it is less and 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:20.250
 less used but I find that 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.410
 it's really one of the most 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.510
 old minecraft and hop on 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:28.250
 would find good for this number 4 of 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.250
 this fourth position to the east 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:35.379
 and for this fourth mode of this 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:37.000
 ranking of the top 5 best mods 

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:39.159
 dutil we will take care 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.680
 today their fashion of quite useful 

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:43.690
 you will see it since it is the mode 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.440
 of dynamic light so here you can 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.150
 see right away 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.860
 what is it actually is a 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.750
 multi mode is by many a lot 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.519
 from youtube hours and actually and that's 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.650
 really a very simple mode I add 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:55.329
 realistic utility at the torch 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.890
 so basically to explain to you 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:58.659
 watch when I learn it bassam is 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.879
 clear and if we put ourselves in a hole 

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:02.110
 really low really black where we see 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:03.730
 absolutely nothing there we will agree 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.470
 you do not see anything and now 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.299
 you see provided you have to 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.010
 the torch in the hand so basically that 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:10.299
 can be really really useful when 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.950
 you walk in caves to 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:13.540
 explore a little bit the cave without 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.340
 necessarily put billions of torches 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.420
 on the ground and it's really a mode that 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.430
 I like it a lot because I find it 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.319
 very useful a lot of the super use it 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.239
 do not know if you have already noticed but 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:24.190
 it really is often present in 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:25.660
 fashion series is so basically I wanted 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.890
 you put it in fourth position 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.190
 so we end up for the third 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.190
 position 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.500
 and for this third position 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.300
 found with inventory mode tweet 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.550
 that you must surely know 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.140
 since the star of the fashions the three 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:42.880
 next few months in his 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.430
 investments are ultra ultra known 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.050
 the inventor there is a very useful mode 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.300
 that lets you down as you go 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:50.890
 to be able to see it in a while 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.780
 manage your inventory and give you 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:54.760
 the tools the most useful tools 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.290
 quickly possible and it's really 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.950
 really ultra proof so for example 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:02.140
 if you shows 7.7 gooden choice look is 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.900
 almost down we look she is 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.220
 almost dead we agree 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.600
 it was then a little trick but it's 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.310
 really as an example term I am 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:12.130
 not there for such a fashion look if I 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.300
 peace see you there hop it's the other one who 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.950
 came directly the one that was 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.970
 spent here in my inventory 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.910
 in short that's why I find this mode 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:20.350
 ultra really useful it helps to tidy up 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.120
 the inventory with the to share very 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.980
 easily when you have a lot of 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.750
 theme you are lazy to put them away 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.810
 to classify them correctly it can be 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.690
 very useful he also arranges the chests 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:33.220
 so basically it can be very useful 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.450
 so here is still in mode that I you 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.919
 advise for your adventures words of 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:37.450
 ways the five modes that are present 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:39.160
 in this ranking I advise you 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:40.030
 absolutely for all your adventures 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.950

 let's meet for the second 

00:04:44.749 --> 00:04:50.099
 and for this second issue of this 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.740
 useful modes ranking we're going 

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:54.900
 approach the toumba mode and not man 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.729
 to man is the times where lola mode not 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.349
 enough high times which is a mode of 

00:04:56.729 --> 00:05:00.840
 more and more known which used in 

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:04.259
 three quarters of the situations of 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:06.029
 same in all tac modes since 

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:07.860
 it's a very useful mode that form 

00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:09.960
 a little bit like toumaÃ¯ believes that 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:12.539
 the meeting early there are many more 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.310
 of options in Lesson 1.7.2 there are 

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:16.770
 some differences a market a little 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.569
 less well but to explain bravely 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:20.460
 the advantage of this mode is that you 

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:22.620
 have the opportunity to know the kraft 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:24.389
 by pressing the r key is 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.039
 know how to use them while waiting for a 

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:28.770
 child by pressing the button there was 

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:32.669
 so that if you want game can you 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:34.020
 do a how to tell a complete tutorial 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:35.460
 of this mode does not hesitate as usual 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.900
 to comment if you want 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:39.569
 tutos complicate some modes 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.800
 in any case it is a mode that I you 

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:42.330
 especially advises for your 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.439
 fashion and fashion adventures 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:45.629
 and for all that you wish to do 

00:05:43.439 --> 00:05:48.300
 in mode and since you will be very very 

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:50.939
 very very very useful so we end up 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:52.349
 for the number 1 of this ranking which 

00:05:50.939 --> 00:05:53.669
 is the most useful mode of minecraft 

00:05:52.349 --> 00:05:55.020
 you will see it in a few 

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:57.259
 hundredths of a second 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.259
 going 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:05.330
 and we are good for the last 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:06.790
 number one mode that I'm not going 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:09.340
 able to introduce you 

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:11.690
 no it's not that it's a member of 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:13.370
 professionalism but it's rather that 

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:15.350
 I do not know what was that 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:19.220
 little fans but yes the mode in question 

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:20.600
 these tiny toddlers so it's a world 

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:22.550
 to say one of the most useful modes by 

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.410
 against 6 months it does not work that does not 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:26.780
 not walk nor on a pot this night on 

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:29.210
 a pot 7.10 so after I could have you 

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:30.740
 present it under 1.6 good finally you 

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:32.300
 see in my opinion you all know 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:33.620
 the years after the autopsies fine plays 

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:35.840
 anyway, you present quickly 

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:37.070
 fashion the wholesale mode it's going to add you 

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:39.500
 options that will be placed in 

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:40.550
 your video zone setting wholesale you 

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:42.020
 have more options 

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:43.910
 here you do not have a reseller 

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:45.560
 distance in Czech but you go 

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:47.780
 to be rounded away from the old 

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:51.350
 it means in small ball mode plus 15 

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:53.150
 then 20 then 16 32 64 short that you 

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:54.440
 no longer manage your performance 

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:57.260
 distance depending on your computer 

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:59.180
 that I find absolutely huge and the 

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:01.700
 extreme is a lot more actually it's 

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:03.080
 30 of more extreme chang of base so 

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:04.340
 basically you can also increased their 

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:05.180
 offers their distance for what they have 

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:08.060
 not a good pc 

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:09.410
 you also have the britpop level which 

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:11.750
 now arrived in point this but 

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:14.360
 before it was that in my little fen 

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:17.300
 you have a lot of videos of how 

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:19.100
 say a video finally no why I 

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:21.200
 told of videos - a lot of options for 

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:23.240
 improve the graphics of the game or then 

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:24.500
 even to increase its number of species 

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:26.240
 in minecraft it can be very useful 

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:28.010
 especially in fashion series and finally 

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:30.530

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:31.760

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:32.870
 if you really ask for it in 

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.190
 such comments I could do 

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:36.890
 a tutorial on this mode I like to watch 

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:37.970
 of the moc rate but you also have a 

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:39.650
 zoom key 

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:41.030

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:42.440

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:44.540

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:48.410

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:49.130
