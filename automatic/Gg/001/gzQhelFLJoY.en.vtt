hey what is up guys Fenix here and today
we're<00:00:03.510> going<00:00:03.659> to<00:00:03.780> be<00:00:03.929> building<00:00:04.110> a<00:00:04.529> skull<00:00:04.980> and

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
we're going to be building a skull and

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.150 
we're going to be building a skull and
crossbones<00:00:05.370> from<00:00:06.029> I<00:00:06.390> guess<00:00:07.170> every<00:00:07.890> pirate

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
crossbones from I guess every pirate

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.910 
crossbones from I guess every pirate
movie<00:00:08.700> you've<00:00:08.820> ever<00:00:08.910> watched<00:00:09.269> that<00:00:09.630> or<00:00:10.019> this

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
movie you've ever watched that or this

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.440 
movie you've ever watched that or this
you<00:00:11.190> can<00:00:11.370> use<00:00:11.460> as<00:00:11.670> like<00:00:11.849> a<00:00:11.880> poison<00:00:12.330> or<00:00:12.389> toxic

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
you can use as like a poison or toxic

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.089 
you can use as like a poison or toxic
sign<00:00:13.019> so<00:00:13.349> it's<00:00:13.500> just<00:00:13.620> the<00:00:13.830> skull<00:00:14.009> and

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
sign so it's just the skull and

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.250 
sign so it's just the skull and
crossbones<00:00:14.160> that<00:00:14.849> it's<00:00:15.210> really<00:00:15.450> famous<00:00:15.630> so

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
crossbones that it's really famous so

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.480 
crossbones that it's really famous so
we're<00:00:16.500> gonna<00:00:16.619> stew<00:00:16.890> to<00:00:17.039> start<00:00:17.250> off<00:00:17.340> this

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
we're gonna stew to start off this

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.189 
we're gonna stew to start off this
picture<00:00:17.640> let's<00:00:18.060> go<00:00:18.210> over<00:00:18.510> our<00:00:18.539> color<00:00:18.960> palette

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
picture let's go over our color palette

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.460 
picture let's go over our color palette
which<00:00:19.619> is<00:00:19.830> black<00:00:20.130> and<00:00:20.369> white<00:00:21.000> war<00:00:21.240> so<00:00:22.080> first

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
which is black and white war so first

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.050 
which is black and white war so first
off<00:00:22.710> we're<00:00:22.830> gonna<00:00:22.890> go<00:00:23.130> up<00:00:23.340> into<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.609> air<00:00:23.640> and

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
off we're gonna go up into the air and

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.419 
off we're gonna go up into the air and
we'll<00:00:24.359> place<00:00:24.539> one<00:00:24.779> block<00:00:25.130> like<00:00:26.130> so<00:00:26.930> and<00:00:27.930> just

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:28.429 
we'll place one block like so and just

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:31.339 
we'll place one block like so and just
walk<00:00:29.429> it<00:00:29.609> like<00:00:29.730> I<00:00:30.210> guess<00:00:30.869> it's<00:00:31.019> gonna<00:00:31.109> be<00:00:31.260> our

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
walk it like I guess it's gonna be our

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.170 
walk it like I guess it's gonna be our
base<00:00:31.560> I've<00:00:32.219> never<00:00:32.399> had<00:00:32.579> a<00:00:32.610> one<00:00:32.790> block<00:00:32.940> base

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
base I've never had a one block base

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.430 
base I've never had a one block base
before<00:00:33.390> but<00:00:33.719> yeah<00:00:33.899> we're<00:00:34.020> just<00:00:34.050> gonna<00:00:34.230> start

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
before but yeah we're just gonna start

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.830 
before but yeah we're just gonna start
with<00:00:34.530> this<00:00:34.739> so<00:00:35.430> come<00:00:35.670> up<00:00:35.700> in<00:00:35.910> to<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.030> left<00:00:36.270> at<00:00:36.780> a

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
with this so come up in to the left at a

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.819 
with this so come up in to the left at a
diagonal<00:00:37.230> of<00:00:37.590> one<00:00:37.920> in<00:00:38.460> each<00:00:38.700> side<00:00:39.079> like<00:00:40.079> so<00:00:40.110> and

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
diagonal of one in each side like so and

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.680 
diagonal of one in each side like so and
that's<00:00:41.070> gonna<00:00:41.219> be<00:00:41.460> there's<00:00:42.030> our<00:00:42.180> start<00:00:42.540> off

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
that's gonna be there's our start off

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.869 
that's gonna be there's our start off
and<00:00:42.930> I<00:00:43.710> would<00:00:43.920> start<00:00:44.190> at<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.370> Centers<00:00:44.700> into

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
and I would start at the Centers into

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.610 
and I would start at the Centers into
the<00:00:44.940> pixel<00:00:45.239> symmetrical<00:00:45.899> but<00:00:46.050> I<00:00:46.110> kind<00:00:46.559> of

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
the pixel symmetrical but I kind of

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.500 
the pixel symmetrical but I kind of
wanted<00:00:46.860> to<00:00:46.920> go<00:00:47.070> down<00:00:47.280> in<00:00:47.760> that<00:00:47.910> direction<00:00:48.090> so

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
wanted to go down in that direction so

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.529 
wanted to go down in that direction so
yeah<00:00:49.430> so<00:00:50.430> now<00:00:50.579> we're<00:00:50.850> gonna<00:00:50.940> go<00:00:51.090> up<00:00:51.270> into<00:00:51.390> the

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
yeah so now we're gonna go up into the

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.319 
yeah so now we're gonna go up into the
left<00:00:51.719> one<00:00:51.840> black<00:00:52.649> and<00:00:52.890> then<00:00:53.670> on<00:00:53.820> top<00:00:54.000> of<00:00:54.180> that

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
left one black and then on top of that

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.619 
left one black and then on top of that
we're<00:00:54.899> gonna<00:00:54.989> come<00:00:55.140> back<00:00:55.320> in<00:00:55.559> two<00:00:56.570> so<00:00:57.570> it

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
we're gonna come back in two so it

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.680 
we're gonna come back in two so it
should<00:00:57.780> look<00:00:57.809> like<00:00:57.930> this<00:00:58.289> now<00:00:59.480> we'll<00:01:00.480> do<00:01:00.570> that

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
should look like this now we'll do that

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:08.060 
should look like this now we'll do that
again<00:01:01.050> so<00:01:01.230> another<00:01:01.500> two<00:01:03.559> like<00:01:04.559> so<00:01:05.720> and<00:01:07.070> then

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
again so another two like so and then

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.010 
again so another two like so and then
we'll<00:01:08.189> come<00:01:08.340> back<00:01:08.369> outward<00:01:08.909> too<00:01:11.659> so<00:01:12.659> yeah<00:01:12.810> that

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
we'll come back outward too so yeah that

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.870 
we'll come back outward too so yeah that
was<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.229> lot<00:01:13.439> of<00:01:13.470> weird<00:01:13.770> mumbo-jumbo<00:01:14.159> just<00:01:14.790> to

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
was a lot of weird mumbo-jumbo just to

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.630 
was a lot of weird mumbo-jumbo just to
get<00:01:15.000> that<00:01:15.119> shape<00:01:15.390> but<00:01:15.840> it's<00:01:16.110> two<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.619> two<00:01:16.650> now

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
get that shape but it's two to two now

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.580 
get that shape but it's two to two now
this<00:01:17.820> work<00:01:18.150> down<00:01:18.390> here<00:01:18.689> so<00:01:19.170> we're<00:01:19.290> gonna<00:01:19.380> come

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
this work down here so we're gonna come

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.030 
this work down here so we're gonna come
up<00:01:19.740> guess<00:01:20.250> what<00:01:20.490> to<00:01:21.049> like<00:01:22.049> so<00:01:22.290> then<00:01:22.950> we're

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
up guess what to like so then we're

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.609 
up guess what to like so then we're
gonna<00:01:23.130> come<00:01:23.280> up<00:01:23.310> one<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:24.330> this<00:01:25.049> is<00:01:25.110> actually

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
gonna come up one and this is actually

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.850 
gonna come up one and this is actually
our<00:01:25.740> axis<00:01:26.100> of<00:01:26.220> symmetry<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:27.140> just<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.470> get<00:01:28.740> the

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
our axis of symmetry and just to get the

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.710 
our axis of symmetry and just to get the
whole<00:01:28.979> thing<00:01:29.130> done<00:01:29.189> I<00:01:29.640> guess<00:01:30.060> for<00:01:30.450> where

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
whole thing done I guess for where

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:31.819 
whole thing done I guess for where
you're<00:01:30.869> gonna<00:01:30.930> reflect<00:01:31.229> it<00:01:31.439> on<00:01:31.560> we're<00:01:31.740> gonna

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
you're gonna reflect it on we're gonna

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:37.760 
you're gonna reflect it on we're gonna
come<00:01:32.009> up<00:01:32.130> white<00:01:32.479> black<00:01:33.479> black<00:01:34.490> white<00:01:36.770> black

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
come up white black black white black

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.280 
come up white black black white black
white<00:01:39.829> black

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290 
white black

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:48.280 
white black
then<00:01:43.100> five<00:01:43.520> whites<00:01:45.070> then<00:01:46.070> black<00:01:47.290> that's

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
then five whites then black that's

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:49.810 
then five whites then black that's
pretty<00:01:48.500> much<00:01:48.650> gonna<00:01:48.830> be<00:01:48.920> our<00:01:49.190> entire<00:01:49.430> pencil

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
pretty much gonna be our entire pencil

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.460 
pretty much gonna be our entire pencil
right<00:01:50.060> there<00:01:50.300> but<00:01:50.690> we're<00:01:50.990> gonna<00:01:51.050> build<00:01:51.320> the

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
right there but we're gonna build the

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:52.810 
right there but we're gonna build the
left<00:01:51.650> side<00:01:51.860> and<00:01:52.070> then<00:01:52.190> make<00:01:52.340> it<00:01:52.370> meet<00:01:52.610> up<00:01:52.700> with

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
left side and then make it meet up with

00:01:52.820 --> 00:02:01.719 
left side and then make it meet up with
the<00:01:52.910> right<00:01:53.060> side<00:01:59.020> so<00:02:00.400> what<00:02:01.400> we're<00:02:01.490> gonna<00:02:01.580> do

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
the right side so what we're gonna do

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:04.450 
the right side so what we're gonna do
for<00:02:01.910> the<00:02:01.970> left<00:02:02.150> side<00:02:02.360> now<00:02:02.600> is<00:02:02.870> after<00:02:03.830> we<00:02:04.160> get<00:02:04.310> do

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
for the left side now is after we get do

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:05.620 
for the left side now is after we get do
this<00:02:04.610> we're<00:02:04.760> gonna<00:02:04.850> come<00:02:05.090> up<00:02:05.240> into<00:02:05.450> the<00:02:05.540> left

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
this we're gonna come up into the left

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.870 
this we're gonna come up into the left
one<00:02:06.070> and<00:02:07.070> come<00:02:07.280> back<00:02:07.400> inward<00:02:07.850> one<00:02:09.640> inward<00:02:10.640> one

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
one and come back inward one inward one

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.740 
one and come back inward one inward one
then<00:02:11.870> we're<00:02:11.990> gonna<00:02:12.080> come<00:02:12.290> inward<00:02:12.440> -<00:02:13.720> so<00:02:14.720> I

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
then we're gonna come inward - so I

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.720 
then we're gonna come inward - so I
should<00:02:14.930> look<00:02:15.020> like<00:02:15.080> this<00:02:15.320> outward<00:02:15.890> one<00:02:16.310> inward

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
should look like this outward one inward

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.240 
should look like this outward one inward
one<00:02:16.970> then<00:02:17.300> inward<00:02:17.630> to<00:02:17.840> then<00:02:18.800> we're<00:02:18.890> gonna<00:02:18.980> come

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
one then inward to then we're gonna come

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.130 
one then inward to then we're gonna come
down<00:02:19.280> off<00:02:19.760> this<00:02:19.940> block<00:02:20.180> not<00:02:20.420> out<00:02:20.720> of<00:02:20.750> diagonal

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
down off this block not out of diagonal

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.130 
down off this block not out of diagonal
just<00:02:21.470> off<00:02:21.920> of<00:02:21.950> that<00:02:22.220> block<00:02:22.459> -<00:02:22.880> I<00:02:23.150> want<00:02:23.990> to<00:02:24.050> come

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
just off of that block - I want to come

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.710 
just off of that block - I want to come
down<00:02:24.200> again<00:02:24.500> and<00:02:25.459> make<00:02:25.640> it<00:02:25.670> go<00:02:25.970> and<00:02:26.180> attach<00:02:26.480> to

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
down again and make it go and attach to

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.230 
down again and make it go and attach to
that<00:02:26.900> right<00:02:27.080> there<00:02:27.850> this<00:02:28.850> should<00:02:28.910> look<00:02:29.180> like

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240 
that right there this should look like

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.040 
that right there this should look like
this<00:02:30.730> now<00:02:31.730> coming<00:02:32.060> off<00:02:32.240> of<00:02:32.300> this<00:02:32.570> block<00:02:32.840> we're

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
this now coming off of this block we're

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:34.990 
this now coming off of this block we're
gonna<00:02:33.140> come<00:02:33.350> up<00:02:33.500> into<00:02:33.680> the<00:02:33.890> right<00:02:34.070> one<00:02:34.700> block

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
gonna come up into the right one block

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.720 
gonna come up into the right one block
like<00:02:35.720> so<00:02:35.989> and<00:02:36.830> they're<00:02:36.980> gonna<00:02:37.100> come<00:02:37.340> out<00:02:37.489> word

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
like so and they're gonna come out word

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.610 
like so and they're gonna come out word
one<00:02:38.450> get<00:02:38.959> out<00:02:39.110> word<00:02:39.260> one<00:02:39.440> again<00:02:41.290> now<00:02:42.290> on<00:02:42.470> this

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
one get out word one again now on this

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.020 
one get out word one again now on this
block<00:02:42.890> we're<00:02:43.070> gonna<00:02:43.160> actually<00:02:43.340> come<00:02:43.610> up<00:02:43.760> three

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
block we're gonna actually come up three

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.060 
block we're gonna actually come up three
more<00:02:44.239> off<00:02:44.390> of<00:02:44.420> that<00:02:44.660> so<00:02:44.810> one<00:02:45.020> two<00:02:45.350> three<00:02:45.380> so

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
more off of that so one two three so

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.130 
more off of that so one two three so
it's<00:02:46.190> four<00:02:46.400> blocks<00:02:46.640> and<00:02:46.940> then<00:02:47.870> we're<00:02:47.959> going<00:02:48.080> to

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
it's four blocks and then we're going to

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.520 
it's four blocks and then we're going to
come<00:02:48.260> up<00:02:48.410> one<00:02:48.650> to<00:02:48.769> the<00:02:48.890> right<00:02:49.010> one<00:02:50.110> up<00:02:51.110> into<00:02:51.440> the

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
come up one to the right one up into the

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.040 
come up one to the right one up into the
right<00:02:51.680> one<00:02:51.920> again<00:02:52.250> and<00:02:52.720> make<00:02:53.720> it<00:02:53.810> meet<00:02:53.930> up

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
right one again and make it meet up

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.560 
right one again and make it meet up
right<00:02:54.260> there<00:02:54.470> I<00:02:55.030> want<00:02:56.030> to<00:02:56.090> do<00:02:56.209> that<00:02:56.390> that's

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570 
right there I want to do that that's

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:57.820 
right there I want to do that that's
pretty<00:02:56.630> much<00:02:56.840> your<00:02:57.080> halfway<00:02:57.260> point

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
pretty much your halfway point

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:59.140 
pretty much your halfway point
all<00:02:57.980> you<00:02:58.070> have<00:02:58.190> to<00:02:58.280> do<00:02:58.370> is<00:02:58.489> reflect<00:02:58.700> it<00:02:58.970> on<00:02:59.060> to

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
all you have to do is reflect it on to

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.090 
all you have to do is reflect it on to
the<00:02:59.239> opposite<00:02:59.510> side<00:02:59.720> and<00:02:59.750> you'll<00:03:00.049> be<00:03:00.200> done<00:03:00.320> but

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
the opposite side and you'll be done but

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:02.530 
the opposite side and you'll be done but
I'll<00:03:01.370> guide<00:03:01.640> you<00:03:01.700> through<00:03:02.000> it<00:03:02.120> just<00:03:02.299> in<00:03:02.390> case

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
I'll guide you through it just in case

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:03.820 
I'll guide you through it just in case
if<00:03:02.720> you're<00:03:02.870> not<00:03:02.989> able<00:03:03.140> to<00:03:03.290> reflect<00:03:03.680> properly

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
if you're not able to reflect properly

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.370 
if you're not able to reflect properly
so<00:03:04.549> coming<00:03:05.060> down<00:03:05.090> right<00:03:05.420> here<00:03:05.720> gonna<00:03:06.170> come

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
so coming down right here gonna come

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.300 
so coming down right here gonna come
down<00:03:06.560> into<00:03:06.739> the<00:03:06.860> right<00:03:06.950> -<00:03:07.280> then<00:03:07.959> down<00:03:08.959> once<00:03:09.350> at

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
down into the right - then down once at

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.340 
down into the right - then down once at
a<00:03:10.370> diagonal<00:03:10.930> then<00:03:11.930> again<00:03:12.430> like<00:03:13.430> so<00:03:14.049> -<00:03:15.049> see<00:03:15.230> it's

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
a diagonal then again like so - see it's

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.370 
a diagonal then again like so - see it's
just<00:03:15.500> a<00:03:15.590> mirror<00:03:15.860> image<00:03:16.340> of<00:03:16.700> the<00:03:16.880> opposite<00:03:17.150> side

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
just a mirror image of the opposite side

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.560 
just a mirror image of the opposite side
now<00:03:18.380> we<00:03:18.440> have<00:03:18.590> to<00:03:18.680> climb<00:03:18.830> back<00:03:18.860> up<00:03:19.220> so<00:03:19.459> up<00:03:19.730> to

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 
now we have to climb back up so up to

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:23.710 
now we have to climb back up so up to
the<00:03:20.630> right<00:03:20.810> open<00:03:21.440> to<00:03:21.680> the<00:03:21.799> right<00:03:21.950> like<00:03:22.250> so<00:03:22.720> then

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
the right open to the right like so then

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.590 
the right open to the right like so then
up<00:03:23.930> into<00:03:24.170> the<00:03:24.260> left<00:03:24.350> -<00:03:25.269> and<00:03:26.269> we're<00:03:26.360> gonna<00:03:26.450> get

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
up into the left - and we're gonna get

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.390 
up into the left - and we're gonna get
that<00:03:26.720> weird<00:03:26.930> shape<00:03:27.140> of<00:03:27.320> two<00:03:27.500> again<00:03:27.799> so<00:03:28.010> up<00:03:28.190> into

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
that weird shape of two again so up into

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.690 
that weird shape of two again so up into
the<00:03:28.459> left<00:03:28.549> -<00:03:28.790> again<00:03:29.920> then<00:03:30.920> up<00:03:31.190> into<00:03:31.400> the<00:03:31.580> right

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
the left - again then up into the right

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.320 
the left - again then up into the right
-<00:03:33.010> so<00:03:34.010> it<00:03:34.070> should<00:03:34.250> look<00:03:34.400> like<00:03:34.459> this

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
- so it should look like this

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.490 
- so it should look like this
now<00:03:37.330> what<00:03:37.510> you're<00:03:37.630> gonna<00:03:37.720> do<00:03:37.900> is<00:03:38.050> come<00:03:38.200> up<00:03:38.350> into

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
now what you're gonna do is come up into

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.090 
now what you're gonna do is come up into
the<00:03:38.650> right<00:03:38.770> one<00:03:40.620> actually<00:03:41.620> I<00:03:41.680> was<00:03:41.920> gonna<00:03:42.040> say

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
the right one actually I was gonna say

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.330 
the right one actually I was gonna say
diagonal<00:03:42.640> then<00:03:42.940> diagonal<00:03:43.480> left<00:03:43.690> one<00:03:44.340> then

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
diagonal then diagonal left one then

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.870 
diagonal then diagonal left one then
diagonal<00:03:45.820> left<00:03:46.000> two<00:03:46.240> -<00:03:46.620> like<00:03:47.620> so<00:03:47.860> and<00:03:48.130> instead

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
diagonal left two - like so and instead

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.310 
diagonal left two - like so and instead
of<00:03:49.000> diagonal<00:03:49.420> now<00:03:49.540> come<00:03:49.840> on<00:03:49.960> for<00:03:50.080> that<00:03:50.140> last

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:50.320 
of diagonal now come on for that last

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.560 
of diagonal now come on for that last
piece<00:03:50.560> we'll<00:03:50.830> come<00:03:50.980> over<00:03:51.100> -<00:03:51.430> then<00:03:52.360> we're<00:03:52.510> gonna

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:52.570 
piece we'll come over - then we're gonna

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:53.940 
piece we'll come over - then we're gonna
do<00:03:52.750> that<00:03:52.870> again<00:03:53.020> and<00:03:53.200> make<00:03:53.470> the<00:03:53.560> meet<00:03:53.710> up<00:03:53.830> with

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
do that again and make the meet up with

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.440 
do that again and make the meet up with
the<00:03:54.040> rest<00:03:54.780> like<00:03:55.780> so<00:03:57.090> so<00:03:58.090> now<00:03:58.210> we're<00:03:58.360> almost

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
the rest like so so now we're almost

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.260 
the rest like so so now we're almost

done let's just finish it up so right
here<00:04:01.720> we're<00:04:01.959> gonna<00:04:02.050> come<00:04:02.350> over<00:04:02.770> up<00:04:03.010> into<00:04:03.370> the

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
here we're gonna come over up into the

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.770 
here we're gonna come over up into the
left<00:04:03.610> one<00:04:03.810> diagonal<00:04:04.810> 1<00:04:05.760> then<00:04:06.760> diagonal<00:04:07.300> right

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
left one diagonal 1 then diagonal right

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:12.530 
left one diagonal 1 then diagonal right
one<00:04:09.690> then<00:04:10.690> that<00:04:10.720> for<00:04:11.170> block<00:04:11.410> we<00:04:11.560> had<00:04:11.709> before<00:04:11.890> so

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
one then that for block we had before so

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:18.479 
one then that for block we had before so
1<00:04:13.540> 2<00:04:13.900> 3<00:04:14.260> 4<00:04:15.030> then<00:04:16.030> diagonal<00:04:16.630> left<00:04:16.900> 1<00:04:17.500> and<00:04:17.829> then<00:04:18.400> we

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
1 2 3 4 then diagonal left 1 and then we

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.030 
1 2 3 4 then diagonal left 1 and then we
got<00:04:18.609> to<00:04:18.700> make<00:04:18.820> it<00:04:18.850> meet<00:04:19.090> up<00:04:19.180> with<00:04:19.299> the<00:04:19.390> rest<00:04:20.040> so

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:21.040 
got to make it meet up with the rest so

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.860 
got to make it meet up with the rest so
technically<00:04:21.519> we're<00:04:21.669> done<00:04:21.850> now<00:04:22.030> we<00:04:22.600> just<00:04:22.750> have

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
technically we're done now we just have

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.020 
technically we're done now we just have
everything<00:04:23.410> to<00:04:23.530> fill<00:04:23.680> in<00:04:23.800> with<00:04:23.919> white<00:04:24.160> but<00:04:24.880> we

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
everything to fill in with white but we

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:26.880 
everything to fill in with white but we
need<00:04:25.180> the<00:04:25.300> eye<00:04:25.330> sockets<00:04:25.870> as<00:04:26.020> well<00:04:26.200> so<00:04:26.620> coming

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:26.890 
need the eye sockets as well so coming

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:30.510 
need the eye sockets as well so coming
to<00:04:26.919> each<00:04:27.190> side<00:04:27.490> of<00:04:28.050> the<00:04:29.050> this<00:04:29.950> piece<00:04:30.340> right

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
to each side of the this piece right

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:31.740 
to each side of the this piece right
here<00:04:30.730> which<00:04:30.880> I<00:04:31.000> guess<00:04:31.030> is<00:04:31.330> supposed<00:04:31.390> to<00:04:31.540> be<00:04:31.630> the

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
here which I guess is supposed to be the

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.159 
here which I guess is supposed to be the
nose<00:04:31.900> we're<00:04:32.590> gonna<00:04:32.710> put<00:04:32.950> a<00:04:33.160> 2x2<00:04:34.000> square<00:04:34.690> as<00:04:34.960> the

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:35.169 
nose we're gonna put a 2x2 square as the

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:39.930 
nose we're gonna put a 2x2 square as the
eye<00:04:35.200> sockets<00:04:36.630> and<00:04:38.280> then<00:04:39.280> everything<00:04:39.640> else<00:04:39.700> is

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
eye sockets and then everything else is

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.580 
eye sockets and then everything else is
white<00:04:40.150> and<00:04:40.450> I<00:04:40.540> will<00:04:40.570> time-lapse<00:04:41.140> that<00:04:41.380> for<00:04:41.530> you

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
white and I will time-lapse that for you

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:42.840 
white and I will time-lapse that for you
guys<00:04:41.740> so<00:04:41.979> there's<00:04:42.130> still<00:04:42.280> everything<00:04:42.490> else<00:04:42.700> in

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:42.850 
guys so there's still everything else in

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:51.470 
guys so there's still everything else in
with<00:04:43.000> white

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:51.480 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:59.930 

you

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.990 

and<00:05:00.030> there<00:05:00.960> we<00:05:01.170> go<00:05:01.200> so<00:05:02.130> that<00:05:02.160> is<00:05:02.460> depict<00:05:02.790> alert

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 
and there we go so that is depict alert

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.180 
and there we go so that is depict alert
