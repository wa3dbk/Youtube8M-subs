Kurt Angle who went on Twitter I believe

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.820

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
it was a few days ago I went up to I

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.440 
it was a few days ago I went up to I
went<00:00:11.070> on<00:00:11.130> his<00:00:11.280> profile<00:00:11.670> maybe<00:00:11.880> yesterday<00:00:12.330> or

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
went on his profile maybe yesterday or

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:13.610 
went on his profile maybe yesterday or
the<00:00:12.540> day<00:00:12.570> before<00:00:12.690> to<00:00:13.080> check<00:00:13.290> if<00:00:13.410> it<00:00:13.500> was

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
the day before to check if it was

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.020 
the day before to check if it was
actually<00:00:13.950> true<00:00:14.160> it<00:00:14.370> wasn't<00:00:14.639> on<00:00:14.730> there<00:00:14.940> of

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
actually true it wasn't on there of

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.880 
actually true it wasn't on there of
course<00:00:15.240> I<00:00:15.509> think<00:00:15.960> he<00:00:16.049> deleted<00:00:16.289> it<00:00:16.560> may<00:00:16.830> be

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
course I think he deleted it may be

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.740 
course I think he deleted it may be
shortly<00:00:17.279> thereafter<00:00:17.460> words<00:00:17.940> but<00:00:18.480> someone

shortly thereafter words but someone

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.840 
shortly thereafter words but someone

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
surprise TNA probably realizes this too

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.430 
surprise TNA probably realizes this too
that's<00:00:41.489> why<00:00:41.670> they<00:00:41.820> had<00:00:42.000> him<00:00:42.290> inducted<00:00:43.290> into

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
that's why they had him inducted into

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.990 
that's why they had him inducted into
their<00:00:43.590> Hall<00:00:43.770> of<00:00:43.800> Fame<00:00:44.129> just<00:00:44.340> a<00:00:44.489> few<00:00:44.670> weeks<00:00:44.760> ago

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
their Hall of Fame just a few weeks ago

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.639 
their Hall of Fame just a few weeks ago
as<00:00:45.270> opposed<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.750> waiting<00:00:45.899> until<00:00:46.230> bound<00:00:46.410> for

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
as opposed to waiting until bound for

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.590 
as opposed to waiting until bound for
glory<00:00:46.739> in<00:00:47.070> October<00:00:47.579> because<00:00:47.700> his<00:00:48.030> his

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
glory in October because his his

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.110 
glory in October because his his
contract<00:00:49.050> expires<00:00:49.469> in<00:00:49.680> august<00:00:49.829> so<00:00:50.730> they

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
contract expires in august so they

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.360 
contract expires in august so they
probably<00:00:51.390> realized<00:00:51.780> oh<00:00:52.170> crap<00:00:52.469> if<00:00:52.739> he's<00:00:53.219> going

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
probably realized oh crap if he's going

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.350 
probably realized oh crap if he's going
to<00:00:53.460> go<00:00:53.550> into<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.730> whole<00:00:53.850> thing<00:00:53.879> we<00:00:54.210> should

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
to go into the whole thing we should

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.819 
to go into the whole thing we should
probably<00:00:54.570> do<00:00:54.899> it<00:00:54.930> now<00:00:55.170> because<00:00:55.379> he<00:00:55.469> might<00:00:55.620> not

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
probably do it now because he might not

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.180 
probably do it now because he might not
be<00:00:55.980> around<00:00:56.129> come<00:00:56.760> October<00:00:57.329> so<00:00:57.870> joining<00:00:58.710> Hogan

be around come October so joining Hogan
and<00:00:59.309> sting<00:00:59.550> might<00:00:59.910> be<00:01:00.059> angled<00:01:00.239> on<00:01:00.570> WWE<00:01:01.199> before

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
and sting might be angled on WWE before

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.500 
and sting might be angled on WWE before
long<00:01:01.829> a<00:01:02.100> lot<00:01:02.460> of<00:01:02.489> people<00:01:02.640> are<00:01:02.969> saying<00:01:03.180> that<00:01:03.359> his

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
long a lot of people are saying that his

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.690 
long a lot of people are saying that his
then<00:01:04.140> he<00:01:04.229> might<00:01:04.350> not<00:01:04.530> pass<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.070> physical<00:01:05.220> test

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
then he might not pass the physical test

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.070 
then he might not pass the physical test
we<00:01:05.909> might<00:01:06.060> not<00:01:06.180> even<00:01:06.240> be<00:01:06.450> able<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.750> wrestle<00:01:06.930> a

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
we might not even be able to wrestle a

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.219 
we might not even be able to wrestle a
match<00:01:07.350> in<00:01:07.650> WWE<00:01:08.210> but<00:01:09.210> maybe<00:01:09.570> I<00:01:09.659> would<00:01:10.080> like<00:01:10.200> to

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
match in WWE but maybe I would like to

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.630 
match in WWE but maybe I would like to
say<00:01:10.439> maybe<00:01:10.590> one<00:01:10.890> match<00:01:11.100> I<00:01:11.280> don't<00:01:11.430> think<00:01:11.549> he's

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
say maybe one match I don't think he's

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:12.859 
say maybe one match I don't think he's
beat<00:01:11.820> up<00:01:11.939> to<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.119> point<00:01:12.360> where<00:01:12.479> he<00:01:12.600> can't

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
beat up to the point where he can't

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.870 
beat up to the point where he can't
wrestle<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.229> match<00:01:13.380> if<00:01:13.680> sting<00:01:14.250> can<00:01:14.400> get<00:01:14.580> cleared

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
wrestle a match if sting can get cleared

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.460 
wrestle a match if sting can get cleared
the<00:01:14.970> wrestling<00:01:15.330> match<00:01:15.450> I<00:01:15.659> think<00:01:15.960> Kurt<00:01:16.140> Angle

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
the wrestling match I think Kurt Angle

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.950 
the wrestling match I think Kurt Angle
could<00:01:16.650> too<00:01:16.860> but<00:01:17.040> um<00:01:17.880> with<00:01:18.479> that<00:01:18.689> being<00:01:18.840> said

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
could too but um with that being said

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.420 
could too but um with that being said

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.560 
he could even be a trainer for NXT so
that's<00:03:28.680> useful<00:03:28.980> on<00:03:29.370> itself<00:03:29.760> he's<00:03:30.450> done

everything there is to do in TNA he's

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.670 
everything there is to do in TNA he's
pretty<00:03:33.329> beat<00:03:33.480> up<00:03:33.540> at<00:03:33.810> the<00:03:33.900> moment<00:03:34.019> so<00:03:34.230> when<00:03:34.440> his

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
pretty beat up at the moment so when his

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.270 
pretty beat up at the moment so when his
contract<00:03:34.950> expires<00:03:35.730> in<00:03:35.970> TNA<00:03:36.360> in<00:03:36.540> August<00:03:37.290> um<00:03:37.470> it

doesn't<00:03:38.489> really<00:03:38.700> matter<00:03:38.910> to<00:03:39.120> me<00:03:39.269> whether<00:03:39.420> he

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
doesn't really matter to me whether he

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.600 
doesn't really matter to me whether he
stays<00:03:39.690> or<00:03:39.900> goes<00:03:40.110> but<00:03:40.950> I<00:03:40.980> think<00:03:41.190> the<00:03:41.310> best<00:03:41.519> bet

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
stays or goes but I think the best bet

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.319 
stays or goes but I think the best bet
for<00:03:41.790> him<00:03:42.239> would<00:03:42.420> be<00:03:42.480> to<00:03:42.660> leave<00:03:43.590> TNA<00:03:44.190> take<00:03:45.060> a<00:03:45.090> few

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.329 
for him would be to leave TNA take a few

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:47.060 
for him would be to leave TNA take a few
months<00:03:45.480> off<00:03:45.750> and<00:03:45.810> then<00:03:46.079> come<00:03:46.109> back<00:03:46.290> maybe<00:03:46.739> for

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
months off and then come back maybe for

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.190 
months off and then come back maybe for
a<00:03:47.100> one-off<00:03:47.549> spot<00:03:48.090> in<00:03:48.209> the<00:03:48.299> Royal<00:03:48.540> Rumble<00:03:48.630> maybe

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
a one-off spot in the Royal Rumble maybe

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.240
