00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
about working with Coles is the fact

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.680 
about working with Coles is the fact
that<00:02:45.950> it's<00:02:46.160> very<00:02:46.340> large<00:02:46.610> and<00:02:47.000> thus<00:02:47.180> it<00:02:47.390> helps

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
that it's very large and thus it helps

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.150

if you're having fun at work well then

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:01.210 
if you're having fun at work well then
it<00:03:00.500> doesn't<00:03:00.710> really<00:03:00.800> feel<00:03:00.980> like<00:03:01.010> you're

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220
