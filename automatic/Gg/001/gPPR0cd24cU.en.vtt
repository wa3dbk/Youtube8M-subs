00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.040
 down to keep the attention 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.119
 under the pecs and go back to the end already 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.770

 wet of recovery between each series if 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.930
 you can think of staying two 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.610
 seconds in water in contraction 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.680
 in order to properly solicit your muscles from

 when you go up

 remember to lock your triceps 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.560
 in order to really feel the contraction you 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.600
 go do four sets of 15 the 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.690
 petition with a minute of recul 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:32.920
 equine triceps necessarily says the 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:35.510
 mold is far from there nicknamed biceps

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.390
 release gently also makes four 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.160
 series of two repetitions with ten 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.600
 minutes of the cub but we all case 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.640
 biceps is not highlighted 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.350
 if it is not delivered with the standards 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.910
 3d shoulders that goes with 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.650
 put yourself against a wall upside down 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.480

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.580
 balanced and get off by looting your 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.070
 elbows against the wall makes four sets 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.870
 of ten repetition doses with one minute 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:08.150
 of hindsight and not the training is not 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.550
 still finished it remains the best 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.920
 part the one that everyone expects I 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.269

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.850
 Pecs has done you I speak of 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:18.500
 legs guys I hate doing the 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.239

 you're going to have to work 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.200
 so make dynamic slots based 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:30.050
 of three sets of two repetitions of 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.090
 each side with 30 seconds of recovery 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:34.160
 between tv series go legion thought 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.170
