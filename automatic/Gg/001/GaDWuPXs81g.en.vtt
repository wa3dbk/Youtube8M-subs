00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:15.440
 Hello, I want to show you recently 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:18.800
 made a knife from steel 95 x 18 if anyone 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.510
 remember i ordered the parcel here and there in 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.480
 In general, in this package there were two 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:26.510
 plate 195 x bald spot so here is this knife and 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:29.900
 but from these plates I will show the knife 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:31.130
 turned out pretty good beautiful 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.220
 without jambs 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:37.000
 it seems to be in my opinion that is to fight 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:40.129
 I used to have style here 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.100
 there was a hole I couldn't fit the raft 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:45.769
 torment everything turned out fine 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:51.049
 do so now by the knife itself 

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:56.440
 saying a knife of steel 95 x 18 stainless steel 

00:00:51.049 --> 00:01:00.159

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:10.340
 blade width three centimeters length 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:15.259
 blade 15 by 15 centimeters need it 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:20.810
 still sharp paper in principle can be and 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:23.509
 cut well here I don't know it of course 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:26.420
 the form of an amateur in general, that is, well, 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:29.179
 other tests how to spend on it 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.549
 I do not plan a knife because the knife is tomorrow 

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:33.530

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:35.719
 legitimate asked to do so do not know 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.119
 can in the forest where to go but in general 

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:40.939
 basically this knife do how to put 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:42.740
 on the shelf to admire but filling so 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:46.100

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:56.390
