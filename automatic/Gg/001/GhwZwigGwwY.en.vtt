00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
believe and I thought that was an

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.589 
believe and I thought that was an
amazing<00:00:26.130> deal<00:00:26.580> for<00:00:26.910> all<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.150> brushes<00:00:27.449> you're

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
amazing deal for all the brushes you're

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.839 
amazing deal for all the brushes you're
getting<00:00:27.840> and<00:00:28.050> considering<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:29.160> quality<00:00:29.609> and

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
getting and considering the quality and

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.150 
getting and considering the quality and
I<00:00:30.240> found<00:00:30.510> these<00:00:30.630> bristles<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.199> be<00:00:31.320> very<00:00:31.619> soft

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
I found these bristles to be very soft

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.400 
I found these bristles to be very soft
and<00:00:32.489> I've<00:00:32.850> had<00:00:33.030> very<00:00:33.059> little<00:00:33.600> fallout<00:00:33.930> in<00:00:34.200> fact

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
and I've had very little fallout in fact

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.780 
and I've had very little fallout in fact
I<00:00:34.500> don't<00:00:34.590> think<00:00:34.710> I've<00:00:34.890> really<00:00:35.040> noticed<00:00:35.309> any

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
I don't think I've really noticed any

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.959 
I don't think I've really noticed any
fallout<00:00:36.239> from<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.480> brushes<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:37.280> I<00:00:38.280> have<00:00:38.850> the

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
fallout from the brushes and I have the

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.630 
fallout from the brushes and I have the
whole<00:00:39.180> set<00:00:39.420> here<00:00:39.629> actually<00:00:40.110> these<00:00:40.320> two<00:00:40.640> didn't

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
whole set here actually these two didn't

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.830 
whole set here actually these two didn't
come<00:00:41.820> with<00:00:41.969> a<00:00:42.000> set<00:00:42.270> I<00:00:42.300> purchased<00:00:42.750> these

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
come with a set I purchased these

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.420 
come with a set I purchased these
separately<00:00:43.290> and<00:00:43.620> then<00:00:43.980> this<00:00:44.160> brush<00:00:44.309> is

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
separately and then this brush is

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.160 
separately and then this brush is
actually<00:00:44.700> from<00:00:44.820> their<00:00:45.000> essentials<00:00:45.480> line<00:00:45.719> but

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
actually from their essentials line but

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.510 
actually from their essentials line but
as<00:00:46.260> you<00:00:46.350> can<00:00:46.469> see<00:00:46.530> this<00:00:46.800> is<00:00:46.950> a<00:00:46.980> great<00:00:47.280> little

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
as you can see this is a great little

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.889 
as you can see this is a great little
brush<00:00:47.730> set<00:00:48.000> because<00:00:48.270> you<00:00:48.300> can<00:00:48.510> just<00:00:48.660> kind<00:00:48.840> of

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
brush set because you can just kind of

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.150 
brush set because you can just kind of
stick<00:00:49.200> other<00:00:49.620> random<00:00:50.070> stuff<00:00:50.309> in<00:00:50.340> here<00:00:50.579> too<00:00:50.850> and

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
stick other random stuff in here too and

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.549 
stick other random stuff in here too and
here's<00:00:53.160> a<00:00:53.280> comparison<00:00:53.789> of<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.960> essentials

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
here's a comparison of the essentials

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.150 
here's a comparison of the essentials
line<00:00:55.920> I<00:00:56.340> shadow<00:00:57.149> brush<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.590> studio<00:00:58.949> line

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
line I shadow brush and the studio line

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.889 
line I shadow brush and the studio line
eye<00:00:59.190> shadow<00:00:59.609> brush<00:01:02.030> and<00:01:03.030> I<00:01:03.120> think<00:01:03.359> this<00:01:03.510> Studio

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
eye shadow brush and I think this Studio

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.200 
eye shadow brush and I think this Studio
line<00:01:04.199> brush<00:01:04.559> does<00:01:05.220> have<00:01:05.489> bristles<00:01:05.970> that<00:01:06.090> are

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
line brush does have bristles that are

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.050 
line brush does have bristles that are
packed<00:01:06.540> more<00:01:07.140> densely<00:01:07.799> and<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.580> bristles<00:01:08.760> are

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
packed more densely and the bristles are

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:16.310 
packed more densely and the bristles are
also<00:01:09.240> softer<00:01:13.130> and<00:01:14.689> then<00:01:15.689> here's<00:01:15.900> a<00:01:15.960> comparison

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
also softer and then here's a comparison

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.070 
also softer and then here's a comparison
of<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:17.070> essential<00:01:17.610> line<00:01:17.850> allover<00:01:18.750> face<00:01:18.869> brush

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
of the essential line allover face brush

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.830 
of the essential line allover face brush
to<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:19.860> estudio<00:01:20.400> line<00:01:20.640> complexion<00:01:21.210> brush<00:01:21.420> and

to the estudio line complexion brush and

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.570 
to the estudio line complexion brush and
I<00:01:22.170> hope<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:22.409> can<00:01:22.530> see<00:01:22.650> this<00:01:22.740> on<00:01:22.920> camera<00:01:23.189> the

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
or concealer with a brush that's just me

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.000 
or concealer with a brush that's just me
but<00:02:17.760> I<00:02:17.819> did<00:02:18.120> try<00:02:18.480> using<00:02:19.050> the<00:02:19.319> foundation<00:02:19.530> brush

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
but I did try using the foundation brush

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.550 
but I did try using the foundation brush
to<00:02:20.100> apply<00:02:20.340> my<00:02:20.610> BB<00:02:20.940> cream<00:02:20.970> and<00:02:21.569> I<00:02:21.930> also<00:02:22.080> did<00:02:22.350> try

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
to apply my BB cream and I also did try

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.080 
to apply my BB cream and I also did try
using<00:02:22.770> the<00:02:22.980> concealer<00:02:23.430> brush<00:02:23.640> to<00:02:23.670> apply

using the concealer brush to apply

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.660 
using the concealer brush to apply
concealer<00:02:24.270> and<00:02:24.930> they<00:02:25.440> both<00:02:25.650> worked<00:02:25.950> fine<00:02:26.280> but

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
concealer and they both worked fine but

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.190 
concealer and they both worked fine but
I<00:02:26.819> just<00:02:26.970> don't<00:02:27.120> really<00:02:27.360> like<00:02:27.510> using<00:02:27.900> those

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200

that I have to point out is that my
small<00:02:33.630> precision<00:02:34.080> brush<00:02:34.260> did<00:02:35.070> come<00:02:35.640> apart<00:02:36.030> as

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300
