 the operation is reversed unit 61 is very simple 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.590
 all controls are located on the left side of the instrument and it 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.170
 is a combined control of control buttons 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.860
 and keyboard 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.350

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:20.649
 Keyboard of the instrument 

00:02:20.649 --> 00:02:25.309
 to get a better look how it works 

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:27.559
 Yamaha delivers a small one 

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:29.949
 if you have people ready 

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:33.949

 just to be confused it is mistaken Spartan 

00:02:57.689 --> 00:02:58.799
