00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:12.110 
so we passed a law and you better follow
that<00:04:09.690> goddamn<00:04:10.260> law<00:04:10.560> you<00:04:11.459> know<00:04:11.579> which<00:04:11.790> is<00:04:11.940> why

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
that goddamn law you know which is why

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.720 
that goddamn law you know which is why
you<00:04:12.180> see<00:04:12.690> minor<00:04:13.290> little<00:04:13.680> petty<00:04:14.069> crimes<00:04:14.459> that

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
you see minor little petty crimes that

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.400 
you see minor little petty crimes that
aren't<00:04:14.940> really<00:04:15.090> crimes<00:04:15.510> people<00:04:15.810> get<00:04:16.109> arrested

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
aren't really crimes people get arrested

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.140 
aren't really crimes people get arrested
in<00:04:16.709> black<00:04:16.950> neighborhoods<00:04:17.459> for<00:04:17.669> those<00:04:17.820> crimes

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
in black neighborhoods for those crimes

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:19.750 
in black neighborhoods for those crimes
because<00:04:18.389> it's<00:04:18.660> a<00:04:18.750> form<00:04:19.019> of<00:04:19.200> social<00:04:19.680> control

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
because it's a form of social control

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.279 
because it's a form of social control
that's<00:04:20.760> why<00:04:20.970> like<00:04:21.329> we<00:04:21.479> discuss<00:04:21.780> all<00:04:21.959> the<00:04:22.080> time

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:22.289 
that's why like we discuss all the time

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:23.870 
that's why like we discuss all the time
when<00:04:22.620> black<00:04:22.860> people<00:04:23.159> and<00:04:23.250> white<00:04:23.370> people<00:04:23.430> use

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
when black people and white people use

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.490 
when black people and white people use
drugs<00:04:24.030> at<00:04:24.270> a<00:04:24.330> similar<00:04:24.510> rate<00:04:24.659> black<00:04:25.050> people<00:04:25.380> get

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
drugs at a similar rate black people get

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.170 
drugs at a similar rate black people get
arrested<00:04:25.680> four<00:04:26.010> to<00:04:26.130> six<00:04:26.310> times<00:04:26.460> more<00:04:26.640> often

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
arrested four to six times more often

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.090 
arrested four to six times more often
because<00:04:27.960> they're<00:04:28.139> using<00:04:28.530> their<00:04:28.889> discretion

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
because they're using their discretion

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.700 
because they're using their discretion
they<00:04:29.759> only<00:04:30.060> want<00:04:30.270> to<00:04:30.389> enforce<00:04:31.050> laws<00:04:31.410> that

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
they only want to enforce laws that

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.439 
they only want to enforce laws that
shouldn't<00:04:32.009> really<00:04:32.130> be<00:04:32.250> laws<00:04:32.610> when<00:04:33.300> it's

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:33.449 
shouldn't really be laws when it's

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:35.659 
shouldn't really be laws when it's
people<00:04:33.750> who<00:04:33.900> are<00:04:33.930> undesirable<00:04:34.800> who<00:04:35.520> are
