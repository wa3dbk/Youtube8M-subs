00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:31.480 
wrecked by the teams that do scream a

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.180 
wrecked by the teams that do scream a
lot<00:04:31.660> and<00:04:31.840> you<00:04:32.050> have<00:04:32.320> a<00:04:32.350> lot<00:04:32.650> of<00:04:32.680> chemistry<00:04:33.010> I

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
lot and you have a lot of chemistry I

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.040 
lot and you have a lot of chemistry I
put<00:04:33.430> in<00:04:33.520> the<00:04:33.610> time<00:04:33.760> and<00:04:33.790> effort<00:04:33.970> to<00:04:34.540> become<00:04:34.690> a

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
put in the time and effort to become a

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.920 
put in the time and effort to become a
better<00:04:35.200> team<00:04:35.590> and<00:04:35.860> that's<00:04:36.700> the<00:04:36.910> downfall<00:04:37.240> of<00:04:37.510> a

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
better team and that's the downfall of a

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:39.960 
better team and that's the downfall of a
lot<00:04:38.320> of<00:04:38.470> teams<00:04:38.740> out<00:04:38.950> there<00:04:38.980> they<00:04:39.430> don't<00:04:39.670> think

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:39.970 
lot of teams out there they don't think

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:41.730 
lot of teams out there they don't think
they<00:04:40.120> need<00:04:40.330> to<00:04:40.360> scram<00:04:40.750> or<00:04:40.780> practice<00:04:41.410> and<00:04:41.590> they

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
they need to scram or practice and they

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.290 
they need to scram or practice and they
just<00:04:41.950> go<00:04:42.070> on<00:04:42.100> gamebattles<00:04:42.550> immediately

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
just go on gamebattles immediately

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:44.910 
just go on gamebattles immediately
because<00:04:43.630> they're<00:04:43.870> extremely<00:04:44.260> impatient

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:44.920 
because they're extremely impatient

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.990 
because they're extremely impatient
that's<00:04:45.490> that's<00:04:46.000> how<00:04:46.150> a<00:04:46.180> lot<00:04:46.450> of<00:04:46.510> teams<00:04:46.810> end<00:04:48.000> so

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
that's that's how a lot of teams end so

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.370 
that's that's how a lot of teams end so
if<00:04:49.240> your<00:04:49.360> first<00:04:49.600> time<00:04:49.810> team<00:04:50.050> then<00:04:50.260> you're

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.380 
if your first time team then you're

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:51.990 
if your first time team then you're
definitely<00:04:50.740> going<00:04:51.220> to<00:04:51.370> need<00:04:51.490> a<00:04:51.670> lot<00:04:51.970> of

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
definitely going to need a lot of

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.670 
definitely going to need a lot of
practice<00:04:52.450> go<00:04:52.840> to<00:04:52.900> league<00:04:53.140> if<00:04:53.320> you're<00:04:53.440> doing

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680

team<00:05:27.370> because<00:05:27.820> if<00:05:28.180> you<00:05:28.270> don't<00:05:28.450> have<00:05:28.540> chemistry

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:28.840 
team because if you don't have chemistry

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.080 
team because if you don't have chemistry
you<00:05:29.380> are<00:05:29.500> not<00:05:29.830> going<00:05:30.040> to<00:05:30.220> go<00:05:30.340> anywhere<00:05:30.550> poor

you are not going to go anywhere poor
really<00:05:31.510> good<00:05:31.720> players<00:05:31.990> with<00:05:32.260> no<00:05:32.440> chemistry<00:05:32.770> do

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:33.430 
really good players with no chemistry do

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:35.370 
really good players with no chemistry do
not<00:05:33.790> last<00:05:34.090> long<00:05:34.450> trust<00:05:34.720> me<00:05:34.810> I've<00:05:34.990> been<00:05:35.020> there

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:35.380 
not last long trust me I've been there

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:37.530 
not last long trust me I've been there
before<00:05:35.760> because<00:05:36.760> when<00:05:36.970> you<00:05:37.030> play<00:05:37.180> with<00:05:37.300> people

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:37.540 
before because when you play with people

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:38.880 
before because when you play with people
you<00:05:37.630> don't<00:05:37.660> have<00:05:37.900> chemistry<00:05:38.200> with<00:05:38.410> and<00:05:38.770> want

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:38.890 
you don't have chemistry with and want

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:40.740 
you don't have chemistry with and want
to<00:05:38.980> form<00:05:39.190> a<00:05:39.250> team<00:05:39.430> with<00:05:39.700> even<00:05:40.450> though<00:05:40.540> they're

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:40.750 
to form a team with even though they're

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:43.110 
to form a team with even though they're
really<00:05:41.230> good<00:05:41.440> it<00:05:41.890> doesn't<00:05:42.430> go<00:05:42.580> far<00:05:42.850> just

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:43.120 
really good it doesn't go far just

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.370 
really good it doesn't go far just
because<00:05:43.210> when<00:05:43.540> you<00:05:43.630> lose<00:05:43.810> a<00:05:43.840> game<00:05:44.050> you<00:05:44.230> start

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:44.380 
because when you lose a game you start

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:46.350 
because when you lose a game you start
pointing<00:05:44.620> fingers<00:05:44.770> at<00:05:45.280> one<00:05:45.460> another<00:05:45.730> and<00:05:46.060> you

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:46.360 
pointing fingers at one another and you
