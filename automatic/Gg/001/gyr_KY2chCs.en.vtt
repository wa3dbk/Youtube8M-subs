here I'm kind of like this oh yeah we're
very<00:01:33.340> much<00:01:33.490> actually<00:01:33.940> they<00:01:34.150> were<00:01:34.420> designed<00:01:34.960> by

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
very much actually they were designed by

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.600 
very much actually they were designed by
the<00:01:35.110> same<00:01:35.230> people<00:01:35.560> the<00:01:35.740> arc<00:01:36.010> mouse<00:01:36.190> in<00:01:36.370> the<00:01:36.460> arc

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
the same people the arc mouse in the arc

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.340 
the same people the arc mouse in the arc
keyboard<00:01:36.730> but<00:01:37.450> this<00:01:37.570> one<00:01:37.720> actually<00:01:37.750> has<00:01:38.020> what

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
keyboard but this one actually has what

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.400 
keyboard but this one actually has what
we<00:01:38.380> call<00:01:38.470> a<00:01:38.650> nano<00:01:39.360> transceiver<00:01:40.360> and<00:01:40.570> the<00:01:41.080> idea

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:41.410 
we call a nano transceiver and the idea

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.680 
we call a nano transceiver and the idea
here<00:01:41.470> is<00:01:41.680> it's<00:01:41.950> so<00:01:42.160> compact<00:01:42.700> that<00:01:43.060> you<00:01:43.480> just

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 
here is it's so compact that you just

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.899 
here is it's so compact that you just
pull<00:01:43.900> it<00:01:43.990> out<00:01:44.110> plug<00:01:44.560> it<00:01:44.650> into<00:01:44.770> your<00:01:44.830> PC<00:01:45.310> and<00:01:45.520> if
