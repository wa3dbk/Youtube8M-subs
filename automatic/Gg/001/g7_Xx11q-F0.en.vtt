second showdown video today I'm going to

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.789 
second showdown video today I'm going to
be<00:00:11.820> putting<00:00:12.000> the<00:00:12.240> two<00:00:12.480> best<00:00:12.780> budget<00:00:12.990> CPUs<00:00:13.620> to

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
be putting the two best budget CPUs to

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.670 
be putting the two best budget CPUs to
the<00:00:13.889> test<00:00:14.190> which<00:00:14.429> is<00:00:14.460> the<00:00:14.790> Intel<00:00:15.330> Pentium<00:00:15.680> g3

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
the test which is the Intel Pentium g3

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.830 
the test which is the Intel Pentium g3
258<00:00:17.400> and<00:00:17.609> the<00:00:18.600> AMD<00:00:19.109> athlon<00:00:19.650> x4<00:00:20.189> 860<00:00:20.939> k<00:00:21.150> let's

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
258 and the AMD athlon x4 860 k let's

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:22.970 
258 and the AMD athlon x4 860 k let's
look<00:00:21.930> a<00:00:22.050> bit<00:00:22.199> of<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.410> background<00:00:22.619> information

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
look a bit of the background information

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.800 
look a bit of the background information
of<00:00:23.340> these<00:00:23.460> processes<00:00:23.699> back<00:00:24.300> in<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.600> day<00:00:24.779> like

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
of these processes back in the day like

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.710 
of these processes back in the day like
years<00:00:25.500> ago<00:00:25.590> actually<00:00:26.119> pentium<00:00:27.119> and<00:00:27.269> a<00:00:27.390> phony

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
years ago actually pentium and a phony

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.540 
years ago actually pentium and a phony
should<00:00:27.869> be<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:27.990> high-end<00:00:28.470> series<00:00:28.859> processes

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
should be the high-end series processes

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.030 
should be the high-end series processes
but<00:00:30.119> sadly<00:00:30.689> they<00:00:30.929> got<00:00:31.109> overlapped<00:00:31.619> by<00:00:31.859> the

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
but sadly they got overlapped by the

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.120 
but sadly they got overlapped by the
core<00:00:32.520> i5<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:33.000> i7<00:00:33.239> for<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:33.899> pentium<00:00:34.320> and<00:00:34.469> for

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
core i5 and i7 for the pentium and for

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.770 
core i5 and i7 for the pentium and for
the<00:00:35.219> after<00:00:35.460> on<00:00:35.550> it<00:00:35.670> was<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.850> FX<00:00:36.210> series<00:00:36.300> of<00:00:36.690> the

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
the after on it was the FX series of the

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.520 
the after on it was the FX series of the
8350<00:00:37.530> gain<00:00:38.190> 95<00:00:38.670> 90<00:00:39.090> but<00:00:39.719> now<00:00:39.870> these<00:00:40.140> are<00:00:40.290> become

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
8350 gain 95 90 but now these are become

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.979 
8350 gain 95 90 but now these are become
great<00:00:40.950> budget<00:00:41.219> cpu<00:00:41.850> that<00:00:42.030> which<00:00:42.270> one<00:00:42.510> is<00:00:42.540> best

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
great budget cpu that which one is best

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.319 
great budget cpu that which one is best
for<00:00:43.320> you<00:00:43.440> let's<00:00:44.340> look<00:00:44.430> at<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.610> pros<00:00:44.850> of<00:00:44.879> the

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
for you let's look at the pros of the

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.930 
for you let's look at the pros of the
pentium<00:00:45.809> g3<00:00:46.350> 258<00:00:47.010> so<00:00:47.190> firstly<00:00:47.550> it's<00:00:47.789> got

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
pentium g3 258 so firstly it's got

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.569 
pentium g3 258 so firstly it's got
powerful<00:00:48.450> two<00:00:48.809> calls<00:00:49.170> so<00:00:49.800> it<00:00:49.920> is<00:00:49.980> a<00:00:50.039> dual-core

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
powerful two calls so it is a dual-core

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.729 
powerful two calls so it is a dual-core
processor<00:00:51.239> but<00:00:51.629> it's<00:00:51.660> really<00:00:52.170> powerful<00:00:52.590> to

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
processor but it's really powerful to

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.639 
processor but it's really powerful to
fall<00:00:52.770> so<00:00:53.280> per<00:00:54.270> core<00:00:54.600> performance<00:00:54.780> of<00:00:55.230> singular

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
fall so per core performance of singular

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.080 
fall so per core performance of singular
core<00:00:55.829> performance<00:00:55.980> is<00:00:56.340> really<00:00:56.879> really

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
core performance is really really

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.410 
core performance is really really
powerful<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:58.620> second<00:00:59.039> point<00:00:59.160> is<00:00:59.430> it<00:00:59.850> runs

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
powerful and the second point is it runs

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.330 
powerful and the second point is it runs
on<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.660> has<00:01:00.899> will<00:01:01.170> eat<00:01:01.379> architecture<00:01:02.190> which

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
on the has will eat architecture which

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.920 
on the has will eat architecture which
means<00:01:02.609> there's<00:01:02.789> a<00:01:02.850> lot<00:01:03.180> of<00:01:03.210> growing<00:01:03.629> room

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
means there's a lot of growing room

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.560 
means there's a lot of growing room
available<00:01:04.439> for<00:01:04.500> this<00:01:04.830> cpu<00:01:05.430> meaning<00:01:06.210> if<00:01:06.330> you<00:01:06.450> do

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
available for this cpu meaning if you do

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.030 
available for this cpu meaning if you do
want<00:01:06.750> to<00:01:06.810> upgrade<00:01:06.930> in<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.409> future<00:01:07.770> you<00:01:07.890> can

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
want to upgrade in the future you can

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.789 
want to upgrade in the future you can
add<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.159> core<00:01:08.460> i5<00:01:08.610> or<00:01:08.909> i7<00:01:09.229> even<00:01:10.229> because<00:01:10.590> he's

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
add a core i5 or i7 even because he's

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.840 
add a core i5 or i7 even because he's
the<00:01:11.040> same<00:01:11.280> LGA<00:01:11.760> 1150<00:01:12.570> socket<00:01:13.250> also<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.400> cpu

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
the same LGA 1150 socket also the cpu

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.020 
the same LGA 1150 socket also the cpu
can<00:01:15.000> overclock<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:15.689> really<00:01:16.259> high<00:01:16.729> 4.7<00:01:17.729> gig

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
can overclock to a really high 4.7 gig

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.190 
can overclock to a really high 4.7 gig
ahead<00:01:18.270> you<00:01:18.479> can<00:01:18.509> even<00:01:18.840> get<00:01:18.930> it<00:01:19.020> higher<00:01:19.170> than

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
ahead you can even get it higher than

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.740 
ahead you can even get it higher than
4.7<00:01:19.890> gigahertz<00:01:20.220> like<00:01:20.640> a<00:01:20.670> stable<00:01:21.119> 5<00:01:21.360> gigahertz

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
4.7 gigahertz like a stable 5 gigahertz

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.490 
4.7 gigahertz like a stable 5 gigahertz
even<00:01:22.229> if<00:01:22.710> you<00:01:22.890> have<00:01:22.979> a<00:01:23.040> good<00:01:23.250> cooler<00:01:23.720> now<00:01:24.720> what

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
even if you have a good cooler now what

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.530 
even if you have a good cooler now what
disappoints<00:01:25.650> me<00:01:26.100> about<00:01:26.369> this<00:01:26.520> cpu<00:01:27.090> is<00:01:27.299> only

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
disappoints me about this cpu is only

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.080 
disappoints me about this cpu is only
has<00:01:27.780> two<00:01:28.020> cause<00:01:28.380> now<00:01:29.220> this<00:01:29.520> leads<00:01:29.700> on<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:29.909> our

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
has two cause now this leads on to our

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.510 
has two cause now this leads on to our
second<00:01:30.509> point<00:01:30.689> to<00:01:31.229> Klaus<00:01:31.560> is<00:01:31.590> just<00:01:32.070> not<00:01:32.310> enough

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
second point to Klaus is just not enough

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.219 
second point to Klaus is just not enough
for<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.090> future<00:01:33.540> games<00:01:33.750> which<00:01:33.930> are<00:01:33.990> going<00:01:34.170> to

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
for the future games which are going to

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.350 
for the future games which are going to
be<00:01:34.320> released<00:01:34.650> now<00:01:35.340> a<00:01:35.369> game<00:01:35.670> that<00:01:35.790> far<00:01:36.090> cry<00:01:36.299> 4

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360

even though they can run on the Pentium
it<00:01:38.790> just<00:01:39.150> doesn't<00:01:39.450> want<00:01:39.630> it<00:01:39.810> playing<00:01:39.840> out<00:01:40.259> does

only good integrated graphics that i
know<00:02:35.500> it's<00:02:35.680> probably<00:02:35.799> AMD's<00:02:36.430> a<00:02:36.670> AP<00:02:37.450> use

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660

processor<00:03:33.430> is<00:03:33.639> it<00:03:34.510> doesn't<00:03:35.079> like<00:03:35.349> core<00:03:35.799> /<00:03:36.069> core

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
processor is it doesn't like core / core

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.099 
processor is it doesn't like core / core
performance<00:03:36.519> is<00:03:37.030> not<00:03:37.299> as<00:03:37.419> powerful<00:03:37.660> as<00:03:37.989> the

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:38.109 
performance is not as powerful as the

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:41.220 
performance is not as powerful as the
pentium<00:03:38.530> is<00:03:38.680> because<00:03:39.040> the<00:03:39.940> way<00:03:40.230> AMD's

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
pentium is because the way AMD's

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.830 
pentium is because the way AMD's
architecture<00:03:42.220> works<00:03:42.400> is<00:03:42.790> that<00:03:42.819> it<00:03:43.120> give<00:03:43.540> they

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
architecture works is that it give they

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.559 
architecture works is that it give they
give<00:03:44.109> a<00:03:44.230> lot<00:03:44.530> to<00:03:44.590> the<00:03:44.829> customers<00:03:45.459> but<00:03:46.239> the

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:46.569 
give a lot to the customers but the

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:48.780 
give a lot to the customers but the
customers<00:03:47.079> don't<00:03:47.230> expect<00:03:47.739> a<00:03:47.919> lot<00:03:48.099> so<00:03:48.370> what<00:03:48.669> I'm

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
customers don't expect a lot so what I'm

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.270 
customers don't expect a lot so what I'm
saying<00:03:49.000> here<00:03:49.150> is<00:03:49.359> basically<00:03:50.099> they're<00:03:51.099> going

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
saying here is basically they're going

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.620 
saying here is basically they're going
to<00:03:51.370> give<00:03:51.519> you<00:03:51.609> some<00:03:51.639> like<00:03:51.940> an<00:03:52.060> eight-core

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
to give you some like an eight-core

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.990 
to give you some like an eight-core
processor<00:03:52.660> from<00:03:53.349> the<00:03:53.709> FX<00:03:54.099> is<00:03:54.310> an<00:03:54.549> eight-core

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
processor from the FX is an eight-core

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.319 
processor from the FX is an eight-core
mansoura<00:03:55.629> processor<00:03:56.079> but<00:03:56.349> the<00:03:56.470> thing<00:03:56.709> is<00:03:56.739> is

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329 
mansoura processor but the thing is is

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:00.360 
mansoura processor but the thing is is
like<00:03:58.329> if<00:03:59.019> you<00:03:59.230> combine<00:03:59.739> the<00:03:59.950> course<00:04:00.190> together

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
like if you combine the course together

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:01.890 
like if you combine the course together
is<00:04:00.639> really<00:04:00.849> powerful<00:04:01.180> if<00:04:01.480> you're<00:04:01.629> doing<00:04:01.780> it

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
is really powerful if you're doing it

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.690 
is really powerful if you're doing it
single<00:04:02.379> core<00:04:02.620> proc<00:04:02.859> or<00:04:03.069> performance<00:04:03.489> work

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
single core proc or performance work

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.059 
single core proc or performance work
it's<00:04:04.269> not<00:04:04.450> as<00:04:04.569> powerful<00:04:04.780> as<00:04:05.049> you<00:04:05.200> think<00:04:05.530> which

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:06.069 
it's not as powerful as you think which

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:07.800 
it's not as powerful as you think which
is<00:04:06.220> a<00:04:06.250> disappointment<00:04:06.700> because<00:04:07.090> I<00:04:07.299> hope<00:04:07.629> I

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
is a disappointment because I hope I

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.050 
is a disappointment because I hope I
only<00:04:08.019> can<00:04:08.260> sort<00:04:08.590> this<00:04:08.739> issue<00:04:09.220> up<00:04:09.639> because

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
only can sort this issue up because

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.220 
only can sort this issue up because
obviously<00:04:10.500> intel<00:04:11.500> really

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
obviously intel really

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.640 
obviously intel really
like<00:04:12.409> destroy<00:04:13.370> AMD<00:04:14.000> they<00:04:14.450> you<00:04:15.200> know<00:04:15.260> if<00:04:15.440> day

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
like destroy AMD they you know if day

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.270 
like destroy AMD they you know if day
per<00:04:16.459> core<00:04:16.820> performance<00:04:16.970> is<00:04:17.329> higher<00:04:17.570> and<00:04:18.280> it's

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
per core performance is higher and it's

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.969 
per core performance is higher and it's
got<00:04:19.790> no<00:04:20.000> integrated<00:04:20.720> graphics<00:04:20.930> now<00:04:21.530> for<00:04:21.889> me

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:21.979 
got no integrated graphics now for me

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:23.890 
got no integrated graphics now for me
that's<00:04:22.220> not<00:04:22.370> a<00:04:22.430> big<00:04:22.580> problem<00:04:22.639> but<00:04:23.240> save<00:04:23.720> your

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
that's not a big problem but save your

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.040 
that's not a big problem but save your
graphics<00:04:24.290> card<00:04:24.669> like<00:04:25.669> just<00:04:26.060> dies<00:04:26.300> out<00:04:26.630> in<00:04:26.840> the

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
graphics card like just dies out in the

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.260 
graphics card like just dies out in the
middle<00:04:27.320> of<00:04:27.560> you<00:04:27.949> doing<00:04:28.490> anything<00:04:28.790> and<00:04:29.120> you

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
middle of you doing anything and you

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.900 
middle of you doing anything and you
need<00:04:29.510> graphics<00:04:30.470> to<00:04:30.860> just<00:04:31.070> do<00:04:31.250> some<00:04:31.580> type<00:04:31.880> of

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910 
need graphics to just do some type of

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.050 
need graphics to just do some type of
work<00:04:32.270> you<00:04:32.630> can<00:04:33.560> like<00:04:34.130> you're<00:04:34.699> not<00:04:34.850> going<00:04:35.000> to

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
work you can like you're not going to

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:36.909 
work you can like you're not going to
have<00:04:35.150> anything<00:04:35.479> like<00:04:36.080> literally<00:04:36.530> you<00:04:36.560> won't

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:36.919 
have anything like literally you won't

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:38.080 
have anything like literally you won't
be<00:04:37.010> able<00:04:37.130> to<00:04:37.220> use<00:04:37.250> your<00:04:37.430> computer<00:04:37.580> as<00:04:37.940> you

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
be able to use your computer as you

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.150 
be able to use your computer as you
would<00:04:38.240> like<00:04:38.449> literally<00:04:39.350> everything<00:04:39.800> now

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
would like literally everything now

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.180 
would like literally everything now
requires<00:04:40.699> graphics<00:04:41.350> not<00:04:42.350> everything<00:04:43.040> but

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
requires graphics not everything but

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.760 
requires graphics not everything but
most<00:04:43.310> of<00:04:43.760> the<00:04:43.850> things<00:04:44.030> require<00:04:44.389> graphic<00:04:44.870> so<00:04:45.139> it

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
most of the things require graphic so it

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:47.529 
most of the things require graphic so it
would<00:04:45.949> have<00:04:45.979> been<00:04:46.190> great<00:04:46.370> if<00:04:46.490> we<00:04:46.729> there<00:04:47.389> was

00:04:47.529 --> 00:04:47.539 
would have been great if we there was

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:50.500 
would have been great if we there was
any<00:04:47.780> graphics<00:04:48.410> I<00:04:48.620> mean<00:04:49.130> safety<00:04:49.520> would<00:04:49.639> put<00:04:49.880> r7

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:50.510 
any graphics I mean safety would put r7

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:52.930 
any graphics I mean safety would put r7
260x<00:04:51.020> I<00:04:51.320> thought<00:04:51.770> with<00:04:52.039> the<00:04:52.100> athlon<00:04:52.580> you<00:04:52.760> can

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:52.940 
260x I thought with the athlon you can

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.879 
260x I thought with the athlon you can
cross<00:04:53.210> fly<00:04:53.479> that<00:04:53.720> but<00:04:53.960> then<00:04:54.260> arena<00:04:54.530> there's<00:04:54.800> no

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:54.889 
cross fly that but then arena there's no

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:56.740 
cross fly that but then arena there's no
integrated<00:04:55.310> graphics<00:04:55.520> on<00:04:55.850> board<00:04:56.090> anyways<00:04:56.510> and

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:56.750 
integrated graphics on board anyways and

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.409 
integrated graphics on board anyways and
also<00:04:57.530> it<00:04:57.800> runs<00:04:57.979> hotter<00:04:58.250> than<00:04:58.520> the<00:04:58.580> Pentium<00:04:59.120> so

00:04:59.409 --> 00:04:59.419 
also it runs hotter than the Pentium so

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:02.050 
also it runs hotter than the Pentium so
it's<00:05:00.289> harder<00:05:00.800> and<00:05:01.070> louder<00:05:01.250> than<00:05:01.580> the<00:05:01.610> Pentium

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
it's harder and louder than the Pentium

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:03.939 
it's harder and louder than the Pentium
the<00:05:02.210> Intel<00:05:02.510> fan<00:05:02.720> is<00:05:02.900> actually<00:05:03.169> quite<00:05:03.289> good<00:05:03.410> the

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:03.949 
the Intel fan is actually quite good the

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:06.520 
the Intel fan is actually quite good the
cpu<00:05:04.550> fan<00:05:04.729> that<00:05:04.940> comes<00:05:05.180> with<00:05:05.389> it<00:05:05.419> it's<00:05:06.380> pretty

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:06.530 
cpu fan that comes with it it's pretty

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:10.629 
cpu fan that comes with it it's pretty
cool<00:05:06.770> and<00:05:07.600> the<00:05:08.600> AMD<00:05:09.289> fans<00:05:09.620> i<00:05:09.919> have<00:05:10.190> realized

00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:10.639 
cool and the AMD fans i have realized

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:12.219 
cool and the AMD fans i have realized
they're<00:05:10.850> really<00:05:11.210> loud<00:05:11.389> they<00:05:11.810> were<00:05:11.960> like<00:05:12.199> a

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:12.229 
they're really loud they were like a

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:15.490 
they're really loud they were like a
Jets<00:05:12.710> but<00:05:13.520> they're<00:05:13.940> really<00:05:14.210> loud<00:05:14.419> and<00:05:14.810> they

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:15.500 
Jets but they're really loud and they

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.070 
Jets but they're really loud and they
can<00:05:15.800> get<00:05:16.010> really<00:05:16.190> hot<00:05:16.550> at<00:05:16.729> times<00:05:17.030> because<00:05:17.780> this

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080 
can get really hot at times because this

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.980 
can get really hot at times because this
