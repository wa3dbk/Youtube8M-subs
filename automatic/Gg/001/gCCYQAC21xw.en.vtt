00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
should be able to narrow it out and just

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.200 
should be able to narrow it out and just
look<00:02:01.890> at<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.130> facts<00:02:02.399> and<00:02:02.610> everything<00:02:02.970> but

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
look at the facts and everything but
