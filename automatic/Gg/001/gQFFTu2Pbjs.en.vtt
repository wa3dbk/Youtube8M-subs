Lincoln compote that we did yesterday

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.809 
Lincoln compote that we did yesterday
because<00:02:24.540> sometimes<00:02:24.870> like<00:02:25.110> I<00:02:25.319> think<00:02:25.500> there

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
because sometimes like I think there

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.089 
because sometimes like I think there
the<00:02:27.270> back<00:02:27.599> end<00:02:27.810> kind<00:02:27.959> of<00:02:28.050> itches<00:02:28.500> a<00:02:28.709> little<00:02:28.770> bit

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
the back end kind of itches a little bit

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:30.830 
the back end kind of itches a little bit
you<00:02:29.489> know<00:02:29.580> when<00:02:29.760> like<00:02:30.120> since<00:02:30.420> we<00:02:30.540> got<00:02:30.690> the

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
you know when like since we got the

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.720 
you know when like since we got the
front<00:02:31.019> and<00:02:31.200> it<00:02:31.260> moved<00:02:31.470> down<00:02:31.560> like<00:02:32.010> bamboo<00:02:32.459> I

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
front and it moved down like bamboo I

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.670 
front and it moved down like bamboo I
think<00:02:33.180> sometimes<00:02:33.510> the<00:02:33.629> back<00:02:33.810> over<00:02:34.019> rotates<00:02:34.530> a

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
think sometimes the back over rotates a

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.380 
think sometimes the back over rotates a
little<00:02:34.890> bit<00:02:35.010> and<00:02:35.550> like<00:02:35.730> coming<00:02:36.090> out<00:02:36.180> at<00:02:36.300> the

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.220 
improvements on it you know with the
frame<00:03:11.190> and<00:03:11.459> just<00:03:11.670> certain<00:03:11.849> things<00:03:11.970> with<00:03:12.420> it<00:03:12.569> so

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
frame and just certain things with it so

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.100 
frame and just certain things with it so
for<00:03:13.500> me<00:03:13.620> I<00:03:14.250> had<00:03:14.700> a<00:03:14.730> chance<00:03:15.000> to<00:03:15.209> ride<00:03:15.510> it<00:03:15.660> back<00:03:15.870> in

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
for me I had a chance to ride it back in

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.289 
for me I had a chance to ride it back in
I<00:03:16.349> think<00:03:16.560> September<00:03:16.829> maybe<00:03:17.730> August<00:03:18.180> September

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
I think September maybe August September

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:20.750 
I think September maybe August September
last<00:03:18.750> year<00:03:18.959> and<00:03:19.530> I<00:03:19.829> knew<00:03:20.099> it<00:03:20.220> was<00:03:20.310> better<00:03:20.519> than

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
last year and I knew it was better than

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.539 
last year and I knew it was better than
and<00:03:21.599> so<00:03:21.900> obviously<00:03:22.560> we<00:03:22.829> worked<00:03:23.040> on<00:03:23.220> it<00:03:23.340> a<00:03:23.400> lot

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
and so obviously we worked on it a lot

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:26.030 
and so obviously we worked on it a lot
for<00:03:23.730> Supercross<00:03:24.239> and<00:03:24.780> it's<00:03:25.620> a<00:03:25.709> lot<00:03:25.860> better

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
for Supercross and it's a lot better

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.009 
for Supercross and it's a lot better
unfortunately<00:03:26.849> as<00:03:27.180> you<00:03:27.420> know<00:03:27.540> I<00:03:27.569> haven't<00:03:27.840> had
