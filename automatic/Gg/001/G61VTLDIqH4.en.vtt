00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
little swing stitch and I pull the yarn

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.760 
little swing stitch and I pull the yarn
tight<00:01:11.340> but<00:01:11.880> not<00:01:11.909> too<00:01:12.150> tight

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.920 

it's<00:01:17.770> important<00:01:18.399> to<00:01:18.549> pay<00:01:18.820> attention<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:21.930> swing

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930 
it's important to pay attention to swing

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.169 
it's important to pay attention to swing
together<00:01:23.380> the<00:01:23.649> same<00:01:23.920> amount<00:01:24.340> of<00:01:24.520> stitches<00:01:24.850> on

00:01:25.169 --> 00:01:25.179 
together the same amount of stitches on

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:27.060 
together the same amount of stitches on
the<00:01:25.360> right<00:01:25.390> and<00:01:25.810> on<00:01:25.899> the<00:01:25.960> left<00:01:26.320> side<00:01:26.500> which<00:01:26.920> I

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
the right and on the left side which I

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.889 
the right and on the left side which I
did<00:01:27.280> not<00:01:27.579> in<00:01:27.789> this<00:01:27.969> case<00:01:28.320> so<00:01:29.320> you<00:01:29.740> have<00:01:30.130> to<00:01:30.840> do<00:01:31.840> a

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:31.899 
did not in this case so you have to do a

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:35.219 
did not in this case so you have to do a
little<00:01:32.079> magic<00:01:33.030> so<00:01:34.030> I<00:01:34.270> have<00:01:34.600> to<00:01:34.840> do<00:01:34.990> a<00:01:35.079> little

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229 
little magic so I have to do a little

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:43.899 
little magic so I have to do a little
magic<00:01:35.470> here<00:01:35.920> at<00:01:36.100> the<00:01:36.310> end

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:50.130 

so<00:01:44.869> very<00:01:45.320> simple<00:01:46.219> stitches

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.550 

at<00:01:51.490> the<00:01:52.490> end<00:01:52.610> you<00:01:52.820> may<00:01:53.000> balance<00:01:53.570> the<00:01:53.900> border

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
at the end you may balance the border

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:01.900 
at the end you may balance the border
with<00:01:54.830> a<00:01:54.860> few<00:01:55.220> stitches<00:01:55.790> and<00:01:59.800> then<00:02:00.800> I<00:02:01.040> continue

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:01.910 
with a few stitches and then I continue

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:09.639 
with a few stitches and then I continue
on<00:02:02.000> the<00:02:02.150> inside<00:02:02.810> of<00:02:03.170> the<00:02:03.890> Tigers<00:02:04.490> head<00:02:08.619> with<00:02:09.619> a

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
on the inside of the Tigers head with a

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:16.120 
on the inside of the Tigers head with a
few<00:02:10.160> stitches<00:02:10.640> in<00:02:11.830> one<00:02:12.830> direction<00:02:14.680> so<00:02:15.680> I<00:02:15.710> cut

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
few stitches in one direction so I cut

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:24.790 
few stitches in one direction so I cut
the<00:02:16.550> yarn<00:02:16.850> a<00:02:17.410> little<00:02:18.410> bit<00:02:18.800> shorter<00:02:19.520> so<00:02:23.170> a<00:02:24.170> few

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
the yarn a little bit shorter so a few

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:33.480 
the yarn a little bit shorter so a few
stitches<00:02:25.250> into<00:02:25.820> one<00:02:26.570> direction

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.620 

and<00:02:33.580> always<00:02:34.530> plunge<00:02:35.530> your<00:02:35.800> needle<00:02:36.630> through

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
and always plunge your needle through

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:46.410 
and always plunge your needle through
the<00:02:37.660> stitches<00:02:38.580> through<00:02:39.580> the<00:02:39.820> yarn<00:02:40.090> a<00:02:45.420> few

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
the stitches through the yarn a few

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.040 
the stitches through the yarn a few
stitches<00:02:46.960> in<00:02:46.990> one<00:02:47.170> direction<00:02:47.740> a<00:02:48.720> few<00:02:49.720> stitches

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
stitches in one direction a few stitches

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:55.200 
stitches in one direction a few stitches
in<00:02:50.560> the<00:02:51.010> other<00:02:51.190> direction<00:02:51.990> again<00:02:53.850> plunge<00:02:54.850> the

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:55.210 
in the other direction again plunge the

00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:02.430 
in the other direction again plunge the
needle<00:02:55.570> through<00:02:56.140> the<00:02:56.410> yarn<00:02:58.620> and<00:03:00.780> again<00:03:01.780> in<00:03:02.050> the

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
needle through the yarn and again in the

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:08.670 
needle through the yarn and again in the
other<00:03:02.710> direction<00:03:06.330> this<00:03:07.330> does<00:03:07.690> fix<00:03:08.080> the<00:03:08.410> yarn

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
other direction this does fix the yarn

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.720 
other direction this does fix the yarn
securely<00:03:09.310> so<00:03:10.000> you<00:03:10.090> see<00:03:10.300> the<00:03:10.450> seam<00:03:10.750> is<00:03:10.930> almost

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
securely so you see the seam is almost

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.950 
securely so you see the seam is almost
invisible<00:03:12.750> and<00:03:14.190> I<00:03:15.190> made<00:03:15.700> here<00:03:16.570> you<00:03:16.660> see<00:03:16.930> a

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:16.960 
invisible and I made here you see a

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.440 
invisible and I made here you see a
tiger's<00:03:17.590> head<00:03:17.620> with<00:03:18.250> two<00:03:18.550> different<00:03:19.030> yarns

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
tiger's head with two different yarns

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.680 
tiger's head with two different yarns
one<00:03:20.260> with<00:03:20.740> a<00:03:20.770> single<00:03:21.100> color<00:03:21.550> and<00:03:21.940> one<00:03:22.390> with<00:03:22.660> a

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
one with a single color and one with a

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.300 
one with a single color and one with a
gradient<00:03:23.080> yarn<00:03:23.650> I<00:03:24.840> love<00:03:25.840> this<00:03:26.110> as<00:03:26.410> it<00:03:26.650> makes<00:03:27.010> a

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
gradient yarn I love this as it makes a

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.350 
gradient yarn I love this as it makes a
more<00:03:27.610> subtle<00:03:28.000> color<00:03:28.540> combination
