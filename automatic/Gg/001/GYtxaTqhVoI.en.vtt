do have tips on that there's actually

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.810 
do have tips on that there's actually
very<00:00:30.380> vast<00:00:31.380> amounts<00:00:31.890> of<00:00:31.980> scientific<00:00:32.489> research

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
very vast amounts of scientific research

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:33.830 
very vast amounts of scientific research
on<00:00:32.969> this<00:00:33.149> there's<00:00:33.300> a<00:00:33.329> lot<00:00:33.480> of<00:00:33.600> psychological

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
on this there's a lot of psychological

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.930 
on this there's a lot of psychological
research<00:00:34.410> on<00:00:34.920> this<00:00:35.130> this<00:00:35.280> is<00:00:35.460> something

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
research on this this is something

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.110 
research on this this is something
studied<00:00:36.420> in<00:00:36.630> psychology<00:00:36.870> itself<00:00:37.969> so<00:00:38.969> let's

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
studied in psychology itself so let's

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.090 
studied in psychology itself so let's
cover<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.480> few<00:00:39.540> things<00:00:39.750> that<00:00:40.260> will<00:00:40.500> help

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
cover a few things that will help

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.950 
cover a few things that will help
promote<00:00:41.399> sleep<00:00:41.940> that<00:00:42.149> will<00:00:42.270> help<00:00:42.420> keep<00:00:42.600> you<00:00:42.809> in

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
promote sleep that will help keep you in

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.750 
promote sleep that will help keep you in
your<00:00:43.079> REM<00:00:43.350> cycles<00:00:43.829> and<00:00:44.040> keep<00:00:44.129> your<00:00:44.280> melatonin

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
your REM cycles and keep your melatonin

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.440 
your REM cycles and keep your melatonin
production<00:00:44.940> up<00:00:45.510> because<00:00:46.320> much<00:00:46.530> of<00:00:46.649> your<00:00:46.800> sleep

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:47.450 
production up because much of your sleep

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.450 
production up because much of your sleep
revolves<00:00:48.450> around<00:00:48.950> hormone<00:00:49.950> levels<00:00:50.309> and

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
revolves around hormone levels and

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.029 
revolves around hormone levels and
hormone<00:00:50.789> production<00:00:51.379> number<00:00:52.379> one<00:00:52.620> is<00:00:52.890> going

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
hormone production number one is going

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.850 
hormone production number one is going
to<00:00:53.100> be<00:00:53.250> light<00:00:53.690> electronic<00:00:54.690> light<00:00:54.930> can<00:00:55.260> disrupt

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
to be light electronic light can disrupt

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.650 
to be light electronic light can disrupt
melatonin<00:00:56.550> production<00:00:56.730> which<00:00:57.390> is<00:00:57.539> your

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
melatonin production which is your

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.139 
melatonin production which is your
primary<00:00:57.899> sleep<00:00:58.410> hormone<00:00:58.739> in<00:00:58.890> your<00:00:58.920> body<00:00:59.149> and

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
primary sleep hormone in your body and

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.099 
primary sleep hormone in your body and
so<00:01:00.270> people<00:01:00.480> are<00:01:00.570> going<00:01:00.660> to<00:01:00.750> be<00:01:00.840> shocked

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
so people are going to be shocked

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.689 
so people are going to be shocked
because<00:01:01.410> some<00:01:01.559> common<00:01:01.949> bro<00:01:02.219> myths<00:01:02.520> are

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
because some common bro myths are

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.270 
because some common bro myths are
actually<00:01:03.229> not<00:01:04.229> helpful<00:01:04.530> in<00:01:04.680> this<00:01:04.830> regard<00:01:04.920> they

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
actually not helpful in this regard they

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.649 
actually not helpful in this regard they
actually<00:01:05.610> hurt<00:01:05.820> you<00:01:06.030> so<00:01:06.180> we're<00:01:06.270> gonna<00:01:06.360> jump

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659
