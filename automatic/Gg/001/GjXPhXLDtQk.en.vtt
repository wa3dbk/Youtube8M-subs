them<00:02:05.250> to<00:02:05.430> on<00:02:05.969> its<00:02:06.329> own<00:02:06.570> have<00:02:07.140> a<00:02:07.170> supervised

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
them to on its own have a supervised

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:12.530 
them to on its own have a supervised
version<00:02:08.849> of<00:02:09.379> autonomy<00:02:10.379> to<00:02:11.039> be<00:02:11.190> autonomous<00:02:11.640> but

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
version of autonomy to be autonomous but

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.670 
version of autonomy to be autonomous but
of<00:02:12.690> course<00:02:13.020> never

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
of course never

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.789 
of course never
losing<00:02:14.129> control<00:02:14.579> this<00:02:15.269> if<00:02:16.109> you<00:02:16.469> could<00:02:16.650> just

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:16.799 
losing control this if you could just

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:19.809 
losing control this if you could just
imagine<00:02:17.480> how<00:02:18.480> this<00:02:18.780> could<00:02:18.840> go<00:02:19.140> wrong<00:02:19.379> if

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
imagine how this could go wrong if

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:23.270 
imagine how this could go wrong if
weaponized<00:02:21.109> it<00:02:22.140> sky's<00:02:22.739> the<00:02:22.769> limit

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
weaponized it sky's the limit

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.920 
weaponized it sky's the limit
yeah<00:02:23.459> absolutely<00:02:23.640> well<00:02:24.120> and<00:02:24.420> you<00:02:24.569> what<00:02:24.810> you're

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
yeah absolutely well and you what you're

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.420 
yeah absolutely well and you what you're
describing<00:02:25.200> essentially<00:02:25.799> Lionel<00:02:26.310> as<00:02:26.400> a

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
describing essentially Lionel as a

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.390 
describing essentially Lionel as a
terminator<00:02:26.879> right<00:02:27.120> it's<00:02:27.420> a<00:02:28.129> robot<00:02:29.129> that<00:02:29.250> looks

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
terminator right it's a robot that looks

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.649 
terminator right it's a robot that looks
like<00:02:29.579> a<00:02:29.640> human<00:02:29.939> and<00:02:30.180> that<00:02:30.239> has<00:02:30.420> these<00:02:30.599> these

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:30.659 
like a human and that has these these

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:32.990 
like a human and that has these these
functions<00:02:31.409> talk<00:02:32.400> to<00:02:32.519> me<00:02:32.609> a<00:02:32.639> little<00:02:32.790> bit<00:02:32.879> about

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
functions talk to me a little bit about

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.750 
functions talk to me a little bit about
how<00:02:33.209> advanced<00:02:33.659> the<00:02:34.019> the<00:02:34.260> warfare<00:02:35.010> research<00:02:35.579> is

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
how advanced the the warfare research is

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.459 
how advanced the the warfare research is
right<00:02:36.000> now<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:36.569> idea<00:02:36.870> of<00:02:36.989> creating<00:02:37.379> these

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:37.469 
right now the idea of creating these

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:39.709 
right now the idea of creating these
autonomous<00:02:37.769> essentially<00:02:38.549> killer<00:02:38.790> robots<00:02:39.269> so

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:39.719 
autonomous essentially killer robots so

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:41.420 
autonomous essentially killer robots so
that<00:02:39.870> we<00:02:39.959> don't<00:02:40.139> need<00:02:40.439> soldiers<00:02:41.010> we<00:02:41.159> can<00:02:41.280> put

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
that we don't need soldiers we can put

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.160 
that we don't need soldiers we can put
them<00:02:41.519> into<00:02:41.670> Wars<00:02:41.879> elves<00:02:42.180> we<00:02:42.269> don't<00:02:42.450> lose<00:02:42.930> the

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
them into Wars elves we don't lose the

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.229 
them into Wars elves we don't lose the
lives<00:02:43.409> of<00:02:43.680> you<00:02:44.400> know<00:02:44.489> Americans<00:02:45.000> were<00:02:45.120> going

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
lives of you know Americans were going

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.539 
lives of you know Americans were going
to<00:02:45.450> fight<00:02:45.599> these<00:02:45.720> wars<00:02:45.950> what's<00:02:46.950> the<00:02:47.129> moral

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
to fight these wars what's the moral

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:49.809 
to fight these wars what's the moral
issue<00:02:47.879> that<00:02:48.299> we're<00:02:48.629> facing<00:02:48.659> here<00:02:49.290> with<00:02:49.439> this

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:49.819 
issue that we're facing here with this

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:52.849 
issue that we're facing here with this
the<00:02:50.819> moral<00:02:51.090> is<00:02:51.180> it's<00:02:52.019> fascinating<00:02:52.439> because<00:02:52.650> if

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:52.859 
the moral is it's fascinating because if

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:54.080 
the moral is it's fascinating because if
you<00:02:52.919> think<00:02:53.040> about<00:02:53.129> this<00:02:53.370> in<00:02:53.579> the<00:02:53.669> history<00:02:54.060> of

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
you think about this in the history of

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.569 
you think about this in the history of
warfare<00:02:54.450> one<00:02:55.379> of<00:02:55.500> the<00:02:55.560> most<00:02:55.769> important<00:02:56.400> events

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:56.579 
warfare one of the most important events

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:58.970 
warfare one of the most important events
ever<00:02:57.209> was<00:02:57.900> the<00:02:58.109> longbow

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
ever was the longbow

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.159 
ever was the longbow
the<00:02:59.159> longbow<00:02:59.569> separated<00:03:00.569> humans<00:03:00.989> for<00:03:01.109> the

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:01.169 
the longbow separated humans for the

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:03.140 
the longbow separated humans for the
first<00:03:01.379> time<00:03:01.620> it<00:03:01.859> was<00:03:01.980> always<00:03:02.219> mano-a-mano<00:03:02.609> and

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
first time it was always mano-a-mano and

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.670 
first time it was always mano-a-mano and
knives<00:03:03.329> and<00:03:03.599> clubs<00:03:03.780> and<00:03:04.139> Spears

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
knives and clubs and Spears

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.679 
knives and clubs and Spears
up<00:03:04.739> close<00:03:05.189> and<00:03:05.430> personal<00:03:05.879> the<00:03:06.419> longbow

00:03:06.679 --> 00:03:06.689 
up close and personal the longbow

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:09.559 
up close and personal the longbow
removed<00:03:07.409> us<00:03:07.650> so<00:03:08.040> therefore<00:03:08.519> we<00:03:08.849> became<00:03:09.269> less

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
removed us so therefore we became less

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:12.649 
removed us so therefore we became less
involved<00:03:10.439> less<00:03:10.680> emotionally<00:03:11.639> committed<00:03:12.150> to

00:03:12.649 --> 00:03:12.659 
involved less emotionally committed to

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:14.509 
involved less emotionally committed to
the<00:03:12.780> battle<00:03:13.200> then<00:03:13.560> later<00:03:13.769> on<00:03:13.980> with<00:03:14.159> artillery

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
robotic adair I say that is hacked that

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.679 
robotic adair I say that is hacked that
goes<00:03:48.989> ask<00:03:49.409> you<00:03:49.650> the<00:03:50.340> same<00:03:50.609> type<00:03:50.909> of<00:03:50.939> oops<00:03:51.419> that
