00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:45.230 
i'm not sure what to make of this one I

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:47.770 
i'm not sure what to make of this one I
mean<00:01:45.500> I<00:01:45.740> consider<00:01:46.520> it<00:01:46.640> a<00:01:46.670> full<00:01:46.880> ravine<00:01:47.180> it<00:01:47.450> does

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
mean I consider it a full ravine it does

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.830 
mean I consider it a full ravine it does
go<00:01:47.990> pretty<00:01:48.200> far<00:01:48.710> it's<00:01:48.920> awfully<00:01:49.430> skinny<00:01:49.820> but<00:01:50.090> it

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
go pretty far it's awfully skinny but it

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.660 
go pretty far it's awfully skinny but it
does<00:01:51.200> go<00:01:51.380> really<00:01:51.590> far<00:01:51.890> so<00:01:52.159> I<00:01:52.220> think<00:01:52.280> we're

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
does go really far so I think we're

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.880 
does go really far so I think we're
going<00:01:52.760> to<00:01:52.850> have<00:01:52.940> to<00:01:53.090> count<00:01:53.300> that<00:01:53.510> and<00:01:53.780> we<00:01:54.740> will

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
going to have to count that and we will

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.520 
going to have to count that and we will
continue<00:01:55.010> on<00:01:55.670> and<00:01:56.090> I<00:01:56.330> have<00:01:56.630> to<00:01:56.810> find<00:01:57.080> my<00:01:57.290> way<00:01:57.500> to

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
continue on and I have to find my way to

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.770 
continue on and I have to find my way to
whatever<00:01:58.340> else<00:01:58.580> I<00:01:58.760> was<00:01:58.909> looking<00:01:59.240> for<00:01:59.510> because

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
whatever else I was looking for because

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.420 
whatever else I was looking for because
as<00:02:00.020> I<00:02:00.140> told<00:02:00.170> you<00:02:00.470> I<00:02:00.500> would<00:02:00.710> probably<00:02:00.890> get<00:02:01.159> lost

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
as I told you I would probably get lost

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.649 
as I told you I would probably get lost
and<00:02:01.760> what<00:02:02.030> did<00:02:02.120> i<00:02:02.210> do<00:02:02.320> get<00:02:03.320> myself<00:02:03.620> lost<00:02:03.890> so

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:04.659 
and what did i do get myself lost so

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:07.780 
and what did i do get myself lost so
look<00:02:05.659> for<00:02:05.900> more<00:02:06.080> gaps<00:02:06.409> and<00:02:06.890> see<00:02:07.430> if<00:02:07.520> we<00:02:07.610> can

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
look for more gaps and see if we can

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.869 
look for more gaps and see if we can
find<00:02:08.090> our<00:02:08.509> way<00:02:08.750> out<00:02:08.989> of<00:02:09.050> here<00:02:09.489> if<00:02:10.489> you'll<00:02:10.700> also

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:10.879 
find our way out of here if you'll also

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:13.629 
find our way out of here if you'll also
notice<00:02:11.359> that<00:02:11.540> there<00:02:12.079> is<00:02:12.109> another<00:02:13.040> ravine<00:02:13.430> like

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:13.639 
notice that there is another ravine like

00:02:13.639 --> 00:02:15.670 
notice that there is another ravine like
on<00:02:13.819> top<00:02:14.090> of<00:02:14.269> this<00:02:14.329> one<00:02:14.569> which<00:02:14.780> is<00:02:14.810> explaining

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
on top of this one which is explaining

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:16.820 
on top of this one which is explaining
why<00:02:15.829> it's<00:02:16.040> so<00:02:16.280> damn

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
why it's so damn

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.280 
why it's so damn
large<00:02:17.070> I<00:02:17.550> mean<00:02:17.760> look<00:02:18.450> at<00:02:18.840> the<00:02:18.930> height<00:02:19.080> of<00:02:19.110> this

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
large I mean look at the height of this

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.740 
large I mean look at the height of this
thing<00:02:19.560> like<00:02:20.370> this<00:02:20.550> one<00:02:20.730> right<00:02:20.850> here<00:02:20.940> obviously

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
thing like this one right here obviously

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.150 
thing like this one right here obviously
one<00:02:21.960> is<00:02:22.050> on<00:02:22.170> top<00:02:22.380> of<00:02:22.530> the<00:02:22.590> other<00:02:22.740> because<00:02:23.010> it

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
one is on top of the other because it

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.340 
one is on top of the other because it
goes<00:02:23.280> way<00:02:23.640> the<00:02:23.940> hell<00:02:24.090> down<00:02:24.120> there<00:02:24.360> and<00:02:24.810> all<00:02:25.290> the

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
goes way the hell down there and all the

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.370 
goes way the hell down there and all the
way<00:02:25.860> the<00:02:26.010> hell<00:02:26.040> up<00:02:26.160> here<00:02:26.420> so<00:02:27.420> right<00:02:27.900> now<00:02:27.930> I

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
way the hell up here so right now I

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.620 
way the hell up here so right now I
guess<00:02:28.590> our<00:02:28.710> count<00:02:29.010> to<00:02:29.190> be<00:02:29.370> at<00:02:29.490> five<00:02:29.790> or<00:02:30.150> six

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
guess our count to be at five or six

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.690 
guess our count to be at five or six
whichever<00:02:31.350> you<00:02:31.590> choose<00:02:31.620> but<00:02:32.310> then<00:02:32.490> you<00:02:32.550> come

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
whichever you choose but then you come

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.240 
whichever you choose but then you come
over<00:02:32.790> here<00:02:32.910> and<00:02:33.170> what<00:02:34.170> do<00:02:34.230> we<00:02:34.320> got<00:02:34.470> another

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
over here and what do we got another

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.740 
over here and what do we got another
ravine<00:02:36.230> yes<00:02:37.230> that<00:02:37.470> is<00:02:37.620> at<00:02:37.860> least<00:02:37.920> six<00:02:38.910> if<00:02:39.270> not

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
ravine yes that is at least six if not

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.450 
ravine yes that is at least six if not
more<00:02:39.990> ravines<00:02:40.440> and<00:02:40.740> then<00:02:40.950> you<00:02:41.010> come<00:02:41.190> over<00:02:41.310> here

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
more ravines and then you come over here

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:45.260 
more ravines and then you come over here
and<00:02:42.030> you<00:02:43.020> float<00:02:43.320> up<00:02:43.650> and<00:02:44.010> you<00:02:44.190> load<00:02:44.580> up<00:02:44.880> you

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
and you float up and you load up you

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
and you float up and you load up you
float<00:02:45.600> up<00:02:45.810> and<00:02:46.080> this<00:02:46.710> is<00:02:47.010> yet<00:02:47.820> another<00:02:48.290> ravine

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
float up and this is yet another ravine

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.500 
float up and this is yet another ravine
so<00:02:50.190> I'm<00:02:50.460> gonna<00:02:50.670> go<00:02:50.850> ahead<00:02:50.880> and<00:02:51.090> say<00:02:51.270> but

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
there's at least seven or beans all

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.610 
there's at least seven or beans all
connected<00:02:54.120> here<00:02:54.300> if<00:02:54.480> not<00:02:54.810> eight<00:02:55.110> and<00:02:55.440> what's

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
connected here if not eight and what's

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.050 
connected here if not eight and what's
really<00:02:55.740> awesome<00:02:55.860> is<00:02:56.280> if<00:02:56.490> you'll<00:02:56.640> notice<00:02:56.820> when

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
really awesome is if you'll notice when

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.150 
really awesome is if you'll notice when
I<00:02:57.120> come<00:02:57.330> out<00:02:57.360> here<00:02:57.630> this<00:02:58.380> is<00:02:58.530> the<00:02:58.680> ravine<00:02:58.980> that

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
I come out here this is the ravine that

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.890 
I come out here this is the ravine that
was<00:02:59.430> originally<00:03:00.240> in<00:03:00.330> the<00:03:00.360> beginning<00:03:00.570> of<00:03:00.840> the

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
was originally in the beginning of the

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.690 
was originally in the beginning of the
video<00:03:01.140> so<00:03:01.170> its<00:03:01.410> way<00:03:01.590> on<00:03:01.709> the<00:03:01.830> other<00:03:01.860> side<00:03:02.040> so

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
video so its way on the other side so

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.180 
video so its way on the other side so
these<00:03:03.300> ravines<00:03:03.720> connect<00:03:04.230> underground<00:03:04.800> from

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
these ravines connect underground from

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.180 
these ravines connect underground from
here<00:03:05.760> all<00:03:06.360> the<00:03:06.420> way<00:03:07.020> around<00:03:07.470> this<00:03:07.950> mountain

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
here all the way around this mountain

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.430 
here all the way around this mountain
you<00:03:08.760> keep<00:03:08.970> going<00:03:09.209> I'm<00:03:09.600> going<00:03:09.840> to<00:03:09.959> flush<00:03:10.170> slow

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
you keep going I'm going to flush slow

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.380 
you keep going I'm going to flush slow
so<00:03:10.650> you<00:03:10.709> can<00:03:10.860> kind<00:03:11.040> of<00:03:11.100> get<00:03:11.520> judging<00:03:11.940> distance

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
so you can kind of get judging distance

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.540 
so you can kind of get judging distance
but<00:03:12.570> from<00:03:12.720> all<00:03:12.930> the<00:03:13.080> way<00:03:13.140> over<00:03:13.350> there<00:03:13.380> to<00:03:14.280> all

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
but from all the way over there to all

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:15.949 
but from all the way over there to all
the<00:03:14.850> way<00:03:14.910> over<00:03:15.180> there<00:03:15.209> all<00:03:15.540> of<00:03:15.840> them

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:17.870 
the way over there all of them
underground<00:03:16.290> all<00:03:16.770> of<00:03:17.010> them<00:03:17.130> connected<00:03:17.310> some

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
underground all of them connected some

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.250 
underground all of them connected some
of<00:03:18.000> them<00:03:18.120> layered<00:03:18.390> on<00:03:18.570> top<00:03:18.600> of<00:03:18.990> each<00:03:19.110> other

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
because I've seen a lot of connected

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.780 
because I've seen a lot of connected
ravines<00:03:27.180> I've<00:03:27.570> never<00:03:27.989> seen<00:03:28.140> two<00:03:28.890> ravines<00:03:29.310> not

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
ravines I've never seen two ravines not

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.270 
ravines I've never seen two ravines not
on<00:03:30.030> the<00:03:30.150> surface<00:03:30.590> connected<00:03:31.590> by<00:03:31.739> that<00:03:32.040> many

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
on the surface connected by that many

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.000 
on the surface connected by that many
ravines<00:03:32.700> underground<00:03:33.420> how<00:03:34.380> that<00:03:34.620> happened

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
top of itself you know just collapsing

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.690 
top of itself you know just collapsing
into<00:03:39.510> the<00:03:39.660> earth<00:03:39.780> is<00:03:39.989> beyond<00:03:40.500> me<00:03:40.769> minecraft

has<00:03:41.880> some<00:03:42.060> crazy<00:03:42.300> rules<00:03:42.810> and<00:03:43.080> apparently<00:03:43.500> that

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
has some crazy rules and apparently that

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.620 
has some crazy rules and apparently that
was<00:03:43.800> one<00:03:43.980> of<00:03:44.130> them<00:03:44.310> that<00:03:44.519> no<00:03:45.120> matter<00:03:45.269> how<00:03:45.510> many

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
was one of them that no matter how many

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.150 
was one of them that no matter how many
ravines<00:03:46.019> and<00:03:46.170> how<00:03:46.290> many<00:03:46.470> holes<00:03:46.709> are<00:03:46.920> in<00:03:46.980> the

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
ravines and how many holes are in the

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.400 
ravines and how many holes are in the
ground<00:03:47.400> the<00:03:47.760> ground<00:03:47.910> will<00:03:48.120> not<00:03:48.239> collapse<00:03:48.630> and

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
ground the ground will not collapse and

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:50.930 
ground the ground will not collapse and
I<00:03:49.500> guess<00:03:49.650> that's<00:03:49.860> good<00:03:50.070> for<00:03:50.280> the<00:03:50.400> sheep<00:03:50.760> and

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
here and check out all these islands

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.830 
here and check out all these islands
just<00:04:35.400> to<00:04:35.550> make<00:04:35.580> sure<00:04:35.730> there's<00:04:36.120> not<00:04:36.300> a<00:04:36.360> mushroom

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
just to make sure there's not a mushroom

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.840 
just to make sure there's not a mushroom
I'll<00:04:36.990> in<00:04:37.200> there<00:04:37.440> because<00:04:38.040> if<00:04:38.250> there<00:04:38.430> is<00:04:38.460> this

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
I'll in there because if there is this

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.450 
I'll in there because if there is this
seed<00:04:39.120> might<00:04:39.600> also<00:04:39.810> have<00:04:40.080> all<00:04:40.320> the<00:04:40.440> biomes<00:04:40.980> so

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
seed might also have all the biomes so

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.640 
seed might also have all the biomes so
let's<00:04:41.640> get<00:04:42.120> over<00:04:42.150> here<00:04:42.660> really<00:04:43.170> quick<00:04:43.470> and
