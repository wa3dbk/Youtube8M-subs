was<00:05:43.890> coded<00:05:44.310> as<00:05:44.430> a<00:05:44.490> buff<00:05:44.940> and<00:05:45.270> the<00:05:45.990> three-second

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:46.830 
was coded as a buff and the three-second

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:49.670 
was coded as a buff and the three-second
silence<00:05:47.310> on<00:05:47.490> top<00:05:47.850> of<00:05:48.030> that<00:05:48.150> is<00:05:48.390> a<00:05:48.420> crazy<00:05:49.200> long

duration and really is just insane for

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.650 
duration and really is just insane for
shutting<00:05:52.950> down<00:05:53.160> an<00:05:53.340> opponent<00:05:53.670> and<00:05:54.030> really

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:54.660 
shutting down an opponent and really

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:56.450 
shutting down an opponent and really
denying<00:05:55.020> any<00:05:55.320> champion<00:05:55.890> in<00:05:55.980> the<00:05:56.070> game<00:05:56.100> who
