00:00:12.421 --> 00:00:14.421
 In my world 

00:00:15.838 --> 00:00:17.838
 where everyone sticks to the other 

00:00:19.614 --> 00:00:21.614
 There would be no more tears 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:25.860
 life would not be so difficult 

00:00:28.196 --> 00:00:30.196
 In my world 

00:00:32.263 --> 00:00:35.894
 where everyone sticks to the other 

00:00:35.894 --> 00:00:37.894
 There would be no more tears 

00:00:40.342 --> 00:00:42.342
 life would not be so difficult 

00:00:44.404 --> 00:00:46.404
 In my world 

00:00:48.426 --> 00:00:50.426
 In my world 

00:00:52.696 --> 00:00:54.812
 In my world 

00:00:54.812 --> 00:00:56.812
 there is always a fight 

00:00:58.472 --> 00:01:00.472
 and nobody stays fair anymore 

00:01:02.682 --> 00:01:04.682
 I'm getting too far 

00:01:06.876 --> 00:01:08.876
 Rules do not count anymore 

00:01:11.095 --> 00:01:13.095
 is there something? 

00:01:14.893 --> 00:01:16.893
 How can I change that? 

00:01:19.103 --> 00:01:21.103
 we often become mean 

00:01:23.038 --> 00:01:25.038
 I ask myself must this be? 

00:01:27.112 --> 00:01:29.112
 I think of something else 

00:01:31.108 --> 00:01:33.108
 I imagine something 

00:01:35.084 --> 00:01:37.084
 In my world 

00:01:39.295 --> 00:01:41.295
 where everyone sticks to the other 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:44.970
 There would be no more tears 

00:01:47.458 --> 00:01:49.458
 life would not be so difficult 

00:01:51.521 --> 00:01:53.521
 In my world 

00:01:55.573 --> 00:01:56.650
 In my world 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.053
 In my world 

00:02:02.054 --> 00:02:04.054
 a nasty word too much 

00:02:05.851 --> 00:02:07.851
 and gossip only out of envy 

00:02:09.868 --> 00:02:11.868
 and now I am the target 

00:02:14.001 --> 00:02:16.001
 Hello EAT! 

00:02:18.094 --> 00:02:20.094
 I want to understand you 

00:02:22.117 --> 00:02:24.117
 and what matters to you 

00:02:26.173 --> 00:02:28.173
 want everything, if possible, 

00:02:30.194 --> 00:02:32.194
 to see with your eyes 

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:36.339
 I think of something else 

00:02:38.454 --> 00:02:40.454
 I imagine something 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:43.470
 In my world 

00:02:46.483 --> 00:02:48.483
 where everyone sticks to the other 

00:02:50.093 --> 00:02:52.093
 There would be no more tears 

00:02:54.583 --> 00:02:56.583
 life would not be so difficult 

00:02:58.604 --> 00:03:00.504
 In my world 

00:03:00.504 --> 00:03:02.772
 in my world, ooh 

00:03:02.772 --> 00:03:03.772
 In my world 

00:03:06.927 --> 00:03:08.770
 In my world, he is a hero 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:10.966
 that helps everyone who falls once 

00:03:10.966 --> 00:03:12.966
 then again on his feet 

00:03:12.966 --> 00:03:15.366
 In my world, he is a hero who cries 

00:03:15.564 --> 00:03:16.964
 when he is crying 

00:03:17.253 --> 00:03:18.853
 he laughs when you are full of joy 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:20.951
 which is then at your side 

00:03:20.951 --> 00:03:23.140
 if something goes completely wrong 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.264
 because everyone counts on everyone 

00:03:25.264 --> 00:03:29.664
 do not just talk 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.920
 In my world 

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:48.229
 In my world 

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:51.631
 In my world 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:55.099
 where everyone sticks to the other 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 There would be no more tears 

00:04:01.812 --> 00:04:03.812
 life would not be so difficult 

00:04:05.896 --> 00:04:07.896
 in my world 

00:04:09.945 --> 00:04:13.520
 where everyone sticks to the other 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.520
 There would be no more tears 

00:04:17.808 --> 00:04:20.808
 life would not be so difficult, not so difficult 

00:04:22.028 --> 00:04:24.028
 In my world 

00:04:26.551 --> 00:04:28.551
 in my world 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.240
 in my world
