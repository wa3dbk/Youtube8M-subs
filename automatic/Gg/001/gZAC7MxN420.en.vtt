during the summer months that would be a
very<00:00:34.770> good<00:00:34.920> medical<00:00:35.460> use<00:00:35.670> for<00:00:35.940> sea<00:00:36.120> salt<00:00:36.420> just

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
very good medical use for sea salt just

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.430

that<00:00:42.510> waterfall<00:00:43.379> of<00:00:43.559> salt<00:00:43.860> so<00:00:44.550> if<00:00:44.670> you<00:00:44.820> were<00:00:44.940> to

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
that waterfall of salt so if you were to

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.910 
that waterfall of salt so if you were to
lay<00:00:45.210> salt<00:00:45.570> on<00:00:45.870> your<00:00:46.079> counter<00:00:46.530> it<00:00:46.770> would

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
lay salt on your counter it would

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.069 
lay salt on your counter it would
collect<00:00:47.280> water<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:48.180> same<00:00:48.420> thing<00:00:48.600> happens<00:00:48.960> in

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
collect water the same thing happens in

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.260 
collect water the same thing happens in
the<00:00:49.170> body<00:00:49.379> so<00:00:50.219> that<00:00:50.250> could<00:00:50.850> be<00:00:50.879> very<00:00:51.180> useful

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
the body so that could be very useful

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.810 
the body so that could be very useful
there<00:00:51.960> in<00:00:52.230> terms<00:00:52.649> of<00:00:52.860> preventing<00:00:53.280> any<00:00:53.489> any

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
there in terms of preventing any any

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.479 
there in terms of preventing any any
problems<00:00:54.360> you<00:00:55.170> could<00:00:55.350> also<00:00:55.500> gargle<00:00:56.010> with<00:00:56.430> a

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
problems you could also gargle with a

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
your body that salt water gargle can go

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.749 
your body that salt water gargle can go
a<00:01:14.729> long<00:01:14.970> way<00:01:15.180> to<00:01:15.240> healing<00:01:15.509> that<00:01:15.750> tissue<00:01:16.759> you

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
a long way to healing that tissue you

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.179 
a long way to healing that tissue you
can<00:01:17.939> also<00:01:18.090> i<00:01:18.630> would<00:01:19.020> consider<00:01:19.229> another<00:01:19.770> form

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
can also i would consider another form

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.300 
can also i would consider another form
of<00:01:20.750> medical<00:01:21.750> use<00:01:21.930> for<00:01:22.229> sea<00:01:22.439> salt<00:01:22.710> being<00:01:23.040> just

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
of medical use for sea salt being just

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.450 
of medical use for sea salt being just
simply<00:01:23.610> adding<00:01:24.000> it<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.150> your<00:01:24.299> food<00:01:25.220> we<00:01:26.220> came

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
simply adding it to your food we came

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.090 
simply adding it to your food we came
from<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.880> sea<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:27.420> quite<00:01:28.229> frankly<00:01:28.259> we<00:01:28.920> are

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
from the sea and quite frankly we are

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.450 
from the sea and quite frankly we are
very<00:01:29.340> deficient<00:01:29.729> in<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.119> minerals<00:01:30.600> that<00:01:31.460> we

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
very deficient in the minerals that we

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.090 
very deficient in the minerals that we
used<00:01:32.729> to<00:01:32.909> get<00:01:33.090> on<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:33.740> very<00:01:34.740> high<00:01:35.729> basis<00:01:36.979> that<00:01:37.979> we

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
used to get on a very high basis that we

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.550 
used to get on a very high basis that we
no<00:01:38.220> longer<00:01:38.250> get<00:01:38.640> anymore<00:01:38.909> so<00:01:39.390> simply<00:01:39.930> using

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
no longer get anymore so simply using

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.010 
no longer get anymore so simply using
that<00:01:40.799> sea<00:01:41.250> salt<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:41.729> your<00:01:41.909> food<00:01:42.119> can<00:01:42.869> go<00:01:42.990> a

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
that sea salt and your food can go a

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.420 
that sea salt and your food can go a
long<00:01:43.259> way<00:01:43.439> to<00:01:43.500> supporting<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.130> mineral

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
long way to supporting the mineral

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.670 
long way to supporting the mineral
status<00:01:44.850> of<00:01:45.000> your<00:01:45.119> body<00:01:45.329> now<00:01:46.020> in<00:01:46.170> particular

you<00:01:46.829> want<00:01:47.040> to<00:01:47.130> buy<00:01:47.280> sea<00:01:48.060> salt<00:01:48.329> that<00:01:48.450> has<00:01:48.600> a

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
you want to buy sea salt that has a

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.660 
you want to buy sea salt that has a
color<00:01:48.930> to<00:01:49.229> it<00:01:49.380> because<00:01:49.680> that<00:01:49.710> color<00:01:50.070> indicates

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
color to it because that color indicates

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.170 
color to it because that color indicates
the<00:01:50.970> mineral<00:01:51.270> content<00:01:51.619> so<00:01:52.619> I<00:01:52.950> like<00:01:53.280> Celtic<00:01:53.880> sea

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
the mineral content so I like Celtic sea
