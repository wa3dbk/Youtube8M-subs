 German company is this model is 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:18.150
 I bought the dealer model from the dealer 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.980
 mercedes-benz with a model still in the kit 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.250
 here were such a mirror 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:27.060
 but I have them removed because the model is in 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.160
 box lies and they take off to their 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.880
 do not hurt 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:36.079
 that is, the model is made of metal 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:41.309
 the lower part of the body is also metal 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:43.860
 stand made of plastic to the model 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:48.420
 also comes a trailer which I later 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:51.090
 I will show in principle a pretty model 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.539
 not bad done this is quite old 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.360

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:59.940

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:06.510
 and turn and the front wheels that is 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:14.450
 removable awning can be removed here such 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:14.450
 the bottom is quite simple but in principle 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.970
 these models of this company all that kind of 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:29.840
 tank and 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.840
 models go trailer take model 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:35.460
 such a trailer goes with him 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:39.990
 to regulate 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.990
 upper and lower bracket they move 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:54.520
 basically made in the same style 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:58.509
 also removable tarp so set 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:01.380
 and so it is made from below nothing 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:01.380
 written in german 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:10.720
 principle, as if all this is put 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:15.340
 together and secure without being fasten 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:18.069
 its meaning it is fixed on top and 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.879
 bottom 2 hooks in general, that's all 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:20.879
