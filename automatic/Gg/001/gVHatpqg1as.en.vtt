 Nice is it has the right size 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.170

 Government visitors come however 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.840

 consists of two spiral staircase the 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:45.040

 merge to separate a staircase 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.000
 his back so that what the 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.610
 Middle Ages could be said 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:59.840
 The grazers call the stairs reconciliation 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:03:01.970
 the modern face of graz got that 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.520

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:16.640
 Excited at first but it is a 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.650
 it was really built to windows

 furnished and the people have come 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:24.080
 Looked like this art house grows and 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.370
 it is then slowly something nice 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.070
 become with the grazer 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.690

 Designer scene emerged and it's up 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:05.840
 once hipp 2003 graz was european 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:08.600
 cultural capital at that time was the 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:11.170

 Actually, the island should be at the end of 2003 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.820
 but the grazer wanted to be mined 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.560
