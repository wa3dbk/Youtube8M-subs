00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
the beam will will point all the way

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.590 
the beam will will point all the way
down<00:00:16.770> and<00:00:17.130> you<00:00:17.670> won't<00:00:17.850> see<00:00:18.090> anything<00:00:18.449> in<00:00:18.570> front

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600

down and you won't see anything in front
of<00:00:18.840> you<00:00:19.400> so<00:00:20.400> this<00:00:21.150> is<00:00:21.210> a<00:00:22.460> very<00:00:23.460> very<00:00:23.730> low-budget

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
of you so this is a very very low-budget

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.890 
of you so this is a very very low-budget
fix<00:00:25.250> of<00:00:26.250> course<00:00:26.550> you<00:00:26.699> can<00:00:26.880> buy<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.090> adjusters

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
fix of course you can buy the adjusters

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.569 
fix of course you can buy the adjusters
new<00:00:28.289> and<00:00:29.150> you<00:00:30.150> will<00:00:30.300> have<00:00:30.449> to<00:00:30.630> take<00:00:31.250> the<00:00:32.250> front

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
new and you will have to take the front

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.060 
new and you will have to take the front
cover<00:00:32.820> I'll<00:00:33.210> separate<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.290> front<00:00:34.530> cover<00:00:34.739> out

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
cover I'll separate the front cover out

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.950 
cover I'll separate the front cover out
of<00:00:35.190> this<00:00:35.430> so<00:00:35.880> you<00:00:35.940> will<00:00:36.239> have<00:00:36.390> to<00:00:36.510> put<00:00:36.690> this<00:00:36.809> in

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
of this so you will have to put this in

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.420 
of this so you will have to put this in
the<00:00:37.050> oven<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.770> pry<00:00:38.760> it<00:00:38.790> out<00:00:39.059> and<00:00:39.660> I<00:00:40.430> figure

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
the oven and pry it out and I figure

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.639 
the oven and pry it out and I figure
it's<00:00:41.640> gonna<00:00:41.969> be<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.239> lot<00:00:42.390> of<00:00:42.450> mess<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:43.079> I<00:00:43.379> don't

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
it's gonna be a lot of mess and I don't

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.810 
it's gonna be a lot of mess and I don't
have<00:00:44.010> time<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.610> do<00:00:44.850> all<00:00:45.059> of<00:00:45.090> this<00:00:45.590> so<00:00:46.590> I<00:00:47.190> think

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
have time to do all of this so I think

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.600 
have time to do all of this so I think
of<00:00:48.680> course<00:00:49.680> you<00:00:49.770> can<00:00:49.920> come<00:00:50.070> up<00:00:50.190> with<00:00:50.219> your<00:00:50.460> own

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
of course you can come up with your own

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.310 
of course you can come up with your own
fix<00:00:50.910> but<00:00:51.420> I<00:00:51.449> think<00:00:51.719> this<00:00:51.870> one<00:00:52.020> is<00:00:52.050> pretty

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
fix but I think this one is pretty

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.760 
fix but I think this one is pretty
straightforward<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:54.920> it<00:00:55.920> should<00:00:56.190> work<00:00:56.399> and

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:57.770 
straightforward and it should work and

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.790 
straightforward and it should work and
hopefully<00:00:59.030> so<00:01:00.030> let<00:01:00.420> me<00:01:00.510> just<00:01:00.719> show<00:01:00.870> you<00:01:00.930> what<00:01:01.770> I

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
hopefully so let me just show you what I

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.759 
hopefully so let me just show you what I
did<00:01:01.920> for<00:01:02.340> this<00:01:02.460> first<00:01:03.120> one<00:01:03.300> here<00:01:03.600> what<00:01:04.500> I<00:01:04.530> did

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
did for this first one here what I did

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:11.710 
did for this first one here what I did
is<00:01:04.949> I<00:01:04.979> bought<00:01:05.400> these<00:01:07.369> screw<00:01:08.369> type<00:01:09.860> you<00:01:10.860> can<00:01:11.040> see

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
is I bought these screw type you can see

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:18.590 
is I bought these screw type you can see
632<00:01:13.250> by<00:01:14.250> one-and-a-half<00:01:14.820> inch<00:01:17.240> you<00:01:18.240> could<00:01:18.420> buy

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
632 by one-and-a-half inch you could buy

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.570 
632 by one-and-a-half inch you could buy
them<00:01:18.930> separately<00:01:19.560> I<00:01:19.860> think<00:01:20.189> or<00:01:20.840> with<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:22.580> nuts

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
them separately I think or with the nuts

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.520 
them separately I think or with the nuts
but<00:01:23.970> I<00:01:24.180> just<00:01:24.450> got<00:01:24.630> this<00:01:24.810> it's<00:01:25.049> like<00:01:25.229> dollar

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
but I just got this it's like dollar

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.700 
but I just got this it's like dollar
something<00:01:26.030> not<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.060> big<00:01:27.270> deal

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
something not a big deal

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.390 
something not a big deal
I<00:01:28.770> started<00:01:29.400> drilling<00:01:29.640> here<00:01:30.119> this<00:01:30.570> was<00:01:30.780> too<00:01:31.049> far

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 
I started drilling here this was too far

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:37.219 
I started drilling here this was too far
so<00:01:32.400> this<00:01:32.850> one<00:01:33.119> works<00:01:33.450> out<00:01:33.630> much<00:01:33.840> better<00:01:36.200> let<00:01:37.200> me

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
so this one works out much better let me

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.109 
so this one works out much better let me
show<00:01:37.500> you<00:01:37.560> on<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.250> inside<00:01:38.610> how<00:01:38.790> it's<00:01:39.000> gonna

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
show you on the inside how it's gonna

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:46.940 
show you on the inside how it's gonna
look<00:01:39.240> like<00:01:39.600> I<00:01:42.350> can<00:01:43.350> I<00:01:45.200> can't<00:01:46.200> turn<00:01:46.320> on<00:01:46.710> the

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
look like I can I can't turn on the

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.219 
look like I can I can't turn on the
flashlight<00:01:47.220> one<00:01:47.729> I'm<00:01:47.899> videoing<00:01:48.899> about

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
flashlight one I'm videoing about

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:55.609 
flashlight one I'm videoing about
anyways<00:01:50.720> on<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.930> inside<00:01:52.490> for<00:01:53.490> light<00:01:54.409> if<00:01:55.409> you

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
anyways on the inside for light if you

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.550 
anyways on the inside for light if you
can<00:01:55.799> see<00:01:56.130> where<00:01:56.719> these<00:01:57.719> screws<00:01:58.110> are<00:01:58.229> going<00:01:58.290> to

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
can see where these screws are going to

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.889 
can see where these screws are going to
touch<00:01:58.770> if<00:01:59.640> you<00:01:59.820> put<00:02:00.000> one<00:02:00.180> screw<00:02:00.540> it's<00:02:00.750> not

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
touch if you put one screw it's not

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.160 
touch if you put one screw it's not
going<00:02:01.079> to<00:02:01.140> be<00:02:01.229> enough<00:02:01.530> if<00:02:02.060> you<00:02:03.060> want<00:02:03.270> to<00:02:03.509> kind

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
going to be enough if you want to kind

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.560 
going to be enough if you want to kind
of<00:02:04.350> control<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:05.189> headlights<00:02:05.939> up-down<00:02:06.540> and

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
of control the headlights up-down and

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.809 
of control the headlights up-down and
left-right<00:02:07.759> you're<00:02:08.759> gonna<00:02:09.030> need<00:02:09.209> two<00:02:09.450> screws

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
left-right you're gonna need two screws

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:13.160 
left-right you're gonna need two screws
at<00:02:11.819> least

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
at least

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.400 
at least
so<00:02:13.430> if<00:02:14.430> you<00:02:14.640> pull<00:02:14.849> one<00:02:14.880> screw<00:02:15.450> like<00:02:16.110> in<00:02:16.290> the

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
so if you pull one screw like in the

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.320 
so if you pull one screw like in the
middle<00:02:16.680> you're<00:02:17.489> going<00:02:17.520> to<00:02:17.730> be<00:02:17.819> able<00:02:17.970> to<00:02:18.150> adjust

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
middle you're going to be able to adjust

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.640 
middle you're going to be able to adjust
the<00:02:18.810> height<00:02:18.840> of<00:02:19.530> the<00:02:20.069> headlight<00:02:20.750> but<00:02:21.750> I<00:02:21.780> I<00:02:22.230> put

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
the height of the headlight but I I put

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.370 
the height of the headlight but I I put
one<00:02:23.069> on<00:02:23.220> the<00:02:23.340> right<00:02:23.849> here<00:02:24.120> one<00:02:24.450> on<00:02:24.480> the<00:02:24.630> left<00:02:24.870> so

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
one on the right here one on the left so

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.199 
one on the right here one on the left so
I<00:02:25.410> can<00:02:25.709> adjust<00:02:26.010> the<00:02:26.250> height<00:02:26.280> and<00:02:26.760> at<00:02:26.940> the<00:02:27.030> same

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
I can adjust the height and at the same

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.820 
I can adjust the height and at the same
time<00:02:27.739> the<00:02:28.739> left<00:02:29.370> and<00:02:29.640> right<00:02:29.850> position<00:02:30.590> so<00:02:31.590> this

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
time the left and right position so this

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:38.570 
time the left and right position so this
is<00:02:33.890> from<00:02:34.890> the<00:02:35.010> inside<00:02:35.510> and<00:02:37.160> this<00:02:38.160> is<00:02:38.340> where

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
is from the inside and this is where

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.070 
is from the inside and this is where
it's<00:02:38.819> going<00:02:39.180> to<00:02:40.819> stop<00:02:41.819> the<00:02:41.850> from<00:02:42.540> moving<00:02:42.930> and

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
it's going to stop the from moving and

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.410 
it's going to stop the from moving and
if<00:02:43.170> you<00:02:43.290> can<00:02:43.440> see<00:02:44.060> it's<00:02:45.350> it's<00:02:46.350> pretty<00:02:46.530> sturdy

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
if you can see it's it's pretty sturdy

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.880 
if you can see it's it's pretty sturdy
it<00:02:48.420> doesn't<00:02:48.840> move<00:02:48.930> anywhere<00:02:49.200> left<00:02:49.590> right<00:02:49.860> or

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
it doesn't move anywhere left right or

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.870 
it doesn't move anywhere left right or
up<00:02:50.400> down<00:02:51.200> so<00:02:52.200> hopefully<00:02:52.830> this<00:02:53.010> will<00:02:53.190> work

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
up down so hopefully this will work

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.140 
up down so hopefully this will work
of<00:02:54.420> course<00:02:54.660> I<00:02:54.780> will<00:02:54.959> report<00:02:55.290> back<00:02:55.880> after<00:02:56.880> a<00:02:56.910> few

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
of course I will report back after a few

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.449 
of course I will report back after a few
weeks<00:02:57.299> to<00:02:57.750> let<00:02:58.470> you<00:02:58.650> know<00:02:58.769> if<00:02:58.950> it<00:02:59.069> worked<00:02:59.310> or

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
weeks to let you know if it worked or

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:00.039 
weeks to let you know if it worked or
not

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:00.049 
not

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:06.800 
not
what<00:03:01.049> I<00:03:01.080> did<00:03:01.350> here<00:03:01.380> I<00:03:01.590> used<00:03:02.040> a<00:03:02.510> drill<00:03:05.360> and<00:03:06.360> this

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
what I did here I used a drill and this

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:13.160 
what I did here I used a drill and this
was<00:03:07.709> the<00:03:08.160> size<00:03:08.459> of<00:03:08.700> the<00:03:08.850> bit<00:03:09.030> was<00:03:10.580> 764<00:03:11.600> um<00:03:12.600> it

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
was the size of the bit was 764 um it

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.599 
was the size of the bit was 764 um it
worked<00:03:13.489> very<00:03:14.489> very<00:03:14.610> well<00:03:14.910> with<00:03:15.720> the<00:03:16.459> with<00:03:17.459> the

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:17.609 
worked very very well with the with the

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:19.699 
worked very very well with the with the
screw<00:03:17.880> type<00:03:18.090> the<00:03:19.019> one<00:03:19.140> I<00:03:19.170> just<00:03:19.260> showed<00:03:19.470> you

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
screw type the one I just showed you

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:24.949 
screw type the one I just showed you
earlier<00:03:20.070> it<00:03:20.790> fits<00:03:21.150> perfectly<00:03:22.459> um<00:03:23.600> so<00:03:24.600> you<00:03:24.690> just

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
earlier it fits perfectly um so you just

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:30.470 
earlier it fits perfectly um so you just
need<00:03:25.109> to<00:03:25.170> screw<00:03:27.980> you<00:03:28.980> know<00:03:29.070> I<00:03:29.100> mean<00:03:29.310> uh<00:03:29.480> doesn't

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
need to screw you know I mean uh doesn't

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.360 
need to screw you know I mean uh doesn't
have<00:03:30.600> to<00:03:30.690> be<00:03:30.780> exactly<00:03:31.290> here<00:03:31.680> maybe<00:03:32.010> a<00:03:32.100> little

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
have to be exactly here maybe a little

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.660 
have to be exactly here maybe a little
bit<00:03:32.459> up-down<00:03:33.209> but<00:03:33.570> this<00:03:33.959> was<00:03:34.200> really<00:03:34.470> far<00:03:34.769> so

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
bit up-down but this was really far so

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.759 
bit up-down but this was really far so
the<00:03:35.820> entire<00:03:36.090> screw<00:03:36.450> went<00:03:36.690> in<00:03:36.959> and<00:03:37.470> didn't

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
the entire screw went in and didn't

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:43.430 
the entire screw went in and didn't
touch<00:03:37.950> the<00:03:38.480> interior<00:03:39.480> like<00:03:39.840> the<00:03:42.440> displace

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
touch the interior like the displace

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.650 
touch the interior like the displace
here<00:03:45.290> basically<00:03:46.290> these<00:03:46.709> headlights<00:03:47.660> another

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
here basically these headlights another

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.090 
here basically these headlights another
piece<00:03:48.870> of<00:03:49.019> information<00:03:49.290> this<00:03:49.739> Hydra

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
piece of information this Hydra

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:54.979 
piece of information this Hydra
headlights<00:03:50.670> are<00:03:50.910> from<00:03:51.239> a<00:03:51.299> 2003<00:03:52.049> BMW<00:03:52.370> 530i<00:03:53.989> and

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
headlights are from a 2003 BMW 530i and

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:58.940 
headlights are from a 2003 BMW 530i and
apparently<00:03:55.530> they<00:03:55.709> have<00:03:55.739> the<00:03:56.600> motor<00:03:57.859> for<00:03:58.859> the

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
apparently they have the motor for the

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:03.020 
apparently they have the motor for the
self<00:03:59.190> leveling<00:03:59.579> which<00:04:00.510> is<00:04:00.690> this<00:04:00.900> guy<00:04:01.670> but<00:04:02.670> I

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
self leveling which is this guy but I

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.539 
self leveling which is this guy but I
think<00:04:03.299> I'm<00:04:03.450> going<00:04:03.660> to<00:04:03.810> disconnect<00:04:04.140> it<00:04:04.650> because

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:05.549 
think I'm going to disconnect it because

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:07.880 
think I'm going to disconnect it because
it's<00:04:06.150> going<00:04:06.359> to<00:04:06.450> be<00:04:06.540> it's<00:04:07.470> going<00:04:07.620> to<00:04:07.709> cause<00:04:07.859> a

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
it's going to be it's going to cause a

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.699 
it's going to be it's going to cause a
problem<00:04:08.750> because<00:04:09.750> this<00:04:09.959> thing<00:04:10.230> doesn't<00:04:10.260> move

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
problem because this thing doesn't move

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:14.420 
problem because this thing doesn't move
anymore<00:04:10.980> so<00:04:11.400> when<00:04:11.940> you<00:04:12.090> start<00:04:12.389> the<00:04:12.480> car<00:04:13.430> this

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
anymore so when you start the car this

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.289 
anymore so when you start the car this
thing<00:04:14.670> is<00:04:14.790> going<00:04:14.940> to<00:04:16.130> it's<00:04:17.130> going<00:04:17.310> to<00:04:17.400> move<00:04:17.549> to

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
thing is going to it's going to move to

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:21.199 
thing is going to it's going to move to
like<00:04:18.570> kind<00:04:18.870> of<00:04:19.400> it's<00:04:20.400> kind<00:04:20.639> of<00:04:20.700> a<00:04:20.820> check<00:04:21.090> I

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
like kind of it's kind of a check I

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.600 
like kind of it's kind of a check I
think<00:04:21.239> the<00:04:21.840> car<00:04:22.080> does<00:04:22.320> or<00:04:22.500> something<00:04:22.830> it's

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
think the car does or something it's

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.420 
think the car does or something it's
going<00:04:23.820> to<00:04:23.880> move<00:04:24.000> and<00:04:24.270> it<00:04:24.599> might<00:04:24.810> break<00:04:25.650> or

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
going to move and it might break or

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.490 
going to move and it might break or
something<00:04:26.820> so<00:04:26.970> just<00:04:27.210> don't<00:04:27.930> plug<00:04:28.850> the<00:04:29.850> motor

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
something so just don't plug the motor

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.860 
something so just don't plug the motor
wire<00:04:31.500> back<00:04:31.830> and<00:04:32.610> that's<00:04:33.210> what<00:04:33.360> I'm<00:04:33.479> going<00:04:33.660> to

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
wire back and that's what I'm going to

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:38.020 
wire back and that's what I'm going to
do<00:04:35.060> really<00:04:36.060> straightforward<00:04:36.449> just<00:04:37.020> two<00:04:37.259> holes

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
do really straightforward just two holes

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:41.900 
do really straightforward just two holes
you<00:04:39.030> screwing<00:04:39.389> them<00:04:39.479> down<00:04:40.460> whenever<00:04:41.460> you<00:04:41.759> want

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910 
you screwing them down whenever you want

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:43.850 
you screwing them down whenever you want
to<00:04:42.030> like<00:04:42.780> right<00:04:42.960> now<00:04:43.110> I<00:04:43.289> don't<00:04:43.350> know<00:04:43.560> if<00:04:43.680> this

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
to like right now I don't know if this

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.100 
to like right now I don't know if this
is<00:04:44.070> the<00:04:44.820> correct<00:04:45.180> beam<00:04:45.389> I'm<00:04:45.570> going<00:04:45.750> to<00:04:45.810> get<00:04:45.960> on

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
is the correct beam I'm going to get on

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:49.520 
is the correct beam I'm going to get on
the<00:04:46.229> road<00:04:46.380> the<00:04:46.680> height<00:04:47.930> so<00:04:48.930> you<00:04:49.020> can<00:04:49.350> always

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
the road the height so you can always

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:52.249 
the road the height so you can always
adjust<00:04:50.240> what<00:04:51.240> you<00:04:51.360> want<00:04:51.539> to<00:04:51.630> do<00:04:51.720> you<00:04:51.900> can<00:04:51.930> just

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:52.259 
adjust what you want to do you can just

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:54.740 
adjust what you want to do you can just
lose<00:04:52.470> these<00:04:52.880> even<00:04:53.880> after<00:04:54.150> you<00:04:54.270> put<00:04:54.449> everything

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
lose these even after you put everything

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.600 
lose these even after you put everything
back<00:04:55.050> you<00:04:55.320> put<00:04:55.530> the<00:04:55.680> bulb<00:04:55.889> and<00:04:56.070> everything<00:04:56.520> you

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
back you put the bulb and everything you

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:59.270 
back you put the bulb and everything you
can<00:04:56.759> still<00:04:57.090> move<00:04:57.660> it<00:04:57.840> from<00:04:58.020> here<00:04:58.320> after<00:04:59.160> the

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
can still move it from here after the

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.450 
can still move it from here after the
bulb<00:04:59.460> is<00:04:59.610> in<00:04:59.960> you<00:05:00.960> can<00:05:01.139> just<00:05:01.320> loosen<00:05:01.530> this<00:05:01.889> move

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
bulb is in you can just loosen this move

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.189 
bulb is in you can just loosen this move
it<00:05:02.639> position<00:05:03.150> it<00:05:03.240> and<00:05:03.330> then<00:05:03.449> hold<00:05:03.690> it<00:05:03.840> and<00:05:04.080> then

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:04.199 
it position it and then hold it and then

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:06.589 
it position it and then hold it and then
put<00:05:05.099> the<00:05:05.220> screws<00:05:05.490> back<00:05:05.520> in<00:05:05.880> and<00:05:06.180> it<00:05:06.300> will<00:05:06.389> keep

00:05:06.589 --> 00:05:06.599 
put the screws back in and it will keep

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:10.010 
put the screws back in and it will keep
it<00:05:06.720> in<00:05:06.810> place<00:05:07.250> so<00:05:08.250> you<00:05:08.669> can<00:05:08.910> adjust<00:05:09.330> this<00:05:09.509> even

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
it in place so you can adjust this even

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.320 
it in place so you can adjust this even
after<00:05:10.320> you're<00:05:10.470> done<00:05:10.680> working<00:05:11.099> on<00:05:11.220> it<00:05:11.400> it

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330 
after you're done working on it it

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.950 
after you're done working on it it
should<00:05:12.599> be<00:05:12.750> very<00:05:12.930> simple<00:05:13.550> but<00:05:14.550> if<00:05:15.449> you<00:05:15.750> make

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 
should be very simple but if you make

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.960 
should be very simple but if you make
such<00:05:16.169> a<00:05:16.199> mistake<00:05:16.410> here<00:05:16.919> and<00:05:16.949> you<00:05:17.430> end<00:05:17.669> up<00:05:17.820> with

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970 
such a mistake here and you end up with

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:20.779 
such a mistake here and you end up with
a<00:05:18.000> hole<00:05:18.210> with<00:05:19.199> a<00:05:19.229> small<00:05:19.620> hole<00:05:19.860> here<00:05:20.190> external

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:20.789 
a hole with a small hole here external

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:24.800 
a hole with a small hole here external
like<00:05:20.970> I<00:05:21.150> did<00:05:21.650> you<00:05:22.650> can<00:05:22.680> put<00:05:23.099> some<00:05:23.690> sort<00:05:24.690> of

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:24.810 
like I did you can put some sort of

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.999 
like I did you can put some sort of
silicone<00:05:25.349> or<00:05:25.710> glue<00:05:25.949> I<00:05:26.400> think<00:05:27.389> I'm<00:05:27.449> gonna<00:05:27.599> put<00:05:27.870> a

00:05:27.999 --> 00:05:28.009 
silicone or glue I think I'm gonna put a

00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:33.140 
silicone or glue I think I'm gonna put a
electric<00:05:29.009> tape<00:05:29.220> here<00:05:31.039> like<00:05:32.039> a<00:05:32.070> bit<00:05:32.610> big<00:05:32.789> area

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.150 
electric tape here like a bit big area

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.570 
electric tape here like a bit big area
and<00:05:33.210> probably<00:05:33.750> one<00:05:34.139> on<00:05:34.260> the<00:05:34.380> inside<00:05:34.470> or<00:05:34.919> put

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:35.580 
and probably one on the inside or put

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.460 
and probably one on the inside or put
silicon<00:05:36.120> and<00:05:36.300> then<00:05:36.360> electric<00:05:36.810> tape<00:05:36.990> on<00:05:37.169> top<00:05:37.349> of

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:37.470 
silicon and then electric tape on top of

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:40.870 
silicon and then electric tape on top of
it<00:05:38.539> usually<00:05:39.539> water<00:05:39.720> doesn't<00:05:40.229> come<00:05:40.380> in<00:05:40.500> here

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:40.880 
it usually water doesn't come in here

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.860 
it usually water doesn't come in here
even<00:05:41.880> when<00:05:42.060> you're<00:05:42.210> driving<00:05:42.419> in<00:05:42.659> rain<00:05:42.840> and

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:42.870 
even when you're driving in rain and

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:48.020 
even when you're driving in rain and
stuff<00:05:43.199> because<00:05:43.310> you<00:05:44.310> got<00:05:44.490> this<00:05:46.849> gasket<00:05:47.849> here

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:48.030 
stuff because you got this gasket here

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:50.600 
stuff because you got this gasket here
that<00:05:48.240> keeps<00:05:48.449> it<00:05:48.630> from<00:05:48.659> coming<00:05:49.289> in<00:05:49.560> so<00:05:50.310> that

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:50.610 
that keeps it from coming in so that

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:54.740 
that keeps it from coming in so that
should<00:05:51.539> not<00:05:51.690> be<00:05:51.840> a<00:05:51.870> problem<00:05:53.360> so<00:05:54.360> hopefully

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:54.750 
should not be a problem so hopefully

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:57.350 
should not be a problem so hopefully
this<00:05:54.960> will<00:05:55.110> help<00:05:55.169> I<00:05:55.650> know<00:05:56.370> you<00:05:56.580> know<00:05:56.880> you're

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:02.870 
perfect and stuff yeah I understand but

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:05.480 
perfect and stuff yeah I understand but
that<00:06:03.870> just<00:06:04.199> errs<00:06:04.440> run<00:06:04.680> on<00:06:04.800> eBay<00:06:05.099> they<00:06:05.430> are

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:05.490 
that just errs run on eBay they are

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:07.610 
that just errs run on eBay they are
plastic<00:06:06.000> and<00:06:06.240> as<00:06:06.840> you<00:06:06.930> can<00:06:07.050> see<00:06:07.110> they're

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:07.620 
plastic and as you can see they're

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:12.850 
plastic and as you can see they're
really<00:06:08.300> they<00:06:09.300> get<00:06:09.509> so<00:06:09.720> brittle<00:06:10.139> and<00:06:10.550> dry<00:06:11.840> after

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:12.860 
really they get so brittle and dry after

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:17.629 
really they get so brittle and dry after
so<00:06:13.860> much<00:06:14.099> time<00:06:14.490> and<00:06:14.789> they<00:06:15.780> break<00:06:16.310> so<00:06:17.310> you<00:06:17.340> can

00:06:17.629 --> 00:06:17.639 
so much time and they break so you can

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:19.580 
so much time and they break so you can
buy<00:06:17.820> the<00:06:17.880> aluminum<00:06:18.509> adjusters<00:06:19.020> I<00:06:19.199> guess<00:06:19.409> they

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:19.590 
buy the aluminum adjusters I guess they

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:22.550 
buy the aluminum adjusters I guess they
run<00:06:19.800> around<00:06:19.919> ninety<00:06:20.370> dollars<00:06:20.729> or<00:06:21.599> the<00:06:22.349> same

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:22.560 
run around ninety dollars or the same

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.589 
run around ninety dollars or the same
plastic<00:06:22.800> ones<00:06:23.280> they<00:06:23.699> run<00:06:23.880> around

00:06:24.589 --> 00:06:24.599 
plastic ones they run around

00:06:24.599 --> 00:06:28.189 
plastic ones they run around
I<00:06:25.400> think<00:06:26.400> forty<00:06:26.699> dollars<00:06:27.060> or<00:06:27.240> something<00:06:27.449> on

00:06:28.189 --> 00:06:28.199 
I think forty dollars or something on

00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:33.110 
I think forty dollars or something on
eBay<00:06:28.639> but<00:06:30.770> anyways<00:06:31.770> you<00:06:32.280> still<00:06:32.520> have<00:06:32.669> to<00:06:32.820> take

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:33.120 
eBay but anyways you still have to take

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:35.870 
eBay but anyways you still have to take
this<00:06:33.389> from<00:06:33.810> here<00:06:34.099> you<00:06:35.099> have<00:06:35.219> to<00:06:35.370> bake<00:06:35.610> the

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:35.880 
this from here you have to bake the

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:39.670 
this from here you have to bake the
headlight<00:06:36.210> in<00:06:36.419> the<00:06:36.539> oven<00:06:36.930> and<00:06:37.849> then<00:06:38.849> pry

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:39.680 
headlight in the oven and then pry

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.890 
headlight in the oven and then pry
out<00:06:39.830> of<00:06:40.340> course<00:06:40.669> there<00:06:40.940> are<00:06:41.090> two<00:06:41.300> screws<00:06:41.570> here

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:41.900 
out of course there are two screws here

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:43.779 
out of course there are two screws here
you<00:06:42.139> have<00:06:42.320> to<00:06:42.470> take<00:06:42.680> off<00:06:42.889> don't<00:06:43.490> forget<00:06:43.759> about

00:06:43.779 --> 00:06:43.789 
you have to take off don't forget about

00:06:43.789 --> 00:06:50.260 
you have to take off don't forget about
that<00:06:47.770> and<00:06:48.770> it's<00:06:49.400> going<00:06:49.789> to<00:06:49.880> take<00:06:50.000> a<00:06:50.030> lot<00:06:50.240> more

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:50.270 
that and it's going to take a lot more

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:53.159 
that and it's going to take a lot more
time<00:06:50.570> I<00:06:50.630> don't<00:06:50.900> have<00:06:51.110> much<00:06:51.259> time<00:06:51.470> so<00:06:51.740> this<00:06:52.729> is

00:06:53.159 --> 00:06:53.169 
time I don't have much time so this is

00:06:53.169 --> 00:06:55.719 
time I don't have much time so this is
less<00:06:54.169> than<00:06:54.380> two<00:06:54.530> dollars<00:06:54.919> and<00:06:55.190> I<00:06:55.400> think<00:06:55.639> it

00:06:55.719 --> 00:06:55.729 
less than two dollars and I think it

00:06:55.729 --> 00:06:58.540 
less than two dollars and I think it
should<00:06:56.000> work<00:06:56.210> pretty<00:06:56.630> pretty<00:06:56.930> good<00:06:57.169> and<00:06:57.550> of

00:06:58.540 --> 00:06:58.550 
should work pretty pretty good and of

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:01.270 
should work pretty pretty good and of
course<00:06:58.789> nobody<00:06:59.479> can<00:06:59.539> see<00:06:59.780> it<00:06:59.870> so<00:07:00.470> hope<00:07:01.039> this

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:01.280 
course nobody can see it so hope this

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:05.470 
course nobody can see it so hope this
helps<00:07:01.639> and<00:07:01.960> thank<00:07:02.960> you<00:07:03.080> very<00:07:03.110> much
