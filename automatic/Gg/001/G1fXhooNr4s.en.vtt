00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.430
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:06.430
 me 

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:06.430
 ame 

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:14.750
 It is a flower paperback 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:21.430
 Four feathers overlap and it is a pretty obi tie 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:21.430
 It can be easily connected simply by changing the folding method of the paperback knot 

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:30.690
 The length of the hand should be about 60 cm as a guide 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.270
 Make a roll and adjust this point to back sewing 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:02.460
 I will roll to match the first volume and the second volume 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:18.900
 Carelessly shut 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:18.900
 Who to fold inwards 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.710
 Remove your hand from ironing 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.970
 I move my hand up to half-width until I sew 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.010
 With your hands on 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.010
 I miss you 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:52.509
 Close firmly I think that is 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.810
 Tie a knot and put your hand on the shoulder 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:16.730
 From approximately 7 cm from the knot the splashing of was to have a play of about 10 centimeters 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:20.319
 Center and decision 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.319
 Match you to SeNui 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.290
 We make feather with both parts tatami 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:43.680
 The size of the wings depends on the remaining length of the body type and the band is roughly 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.680
 It may be a much width of the body as a guide 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:03:00.100
 I will decide the wing on the other side well in balance and decide the length of the upper wing 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:03:04.140
 The wings of the upper wings are roughly 5 cm to 10 cm or so, but this is also the whole 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.140
 See balance and adjust 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:10.810
 Check if the left and right sisters are the same length 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:19.900
 Make a double sheet 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:32.700
 First, firmly grasp the center of the wings 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:32.700
 Weave both ends and pass through the cloth 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.500
 Tighten it again and put the feathers on the knot 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:51.230
 Pull the hair tip from the bottom up like wrapping the knot and knot 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.750
 Carelessly shut 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:10.519
 How is the second volume put in the fire 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.519
 Pull out 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:30.380
 The hand that I did outside winding so that there is not too much loose the same 1 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:33.590
 It will be between the date tightening 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:37.270
 This will be the foundation of the knot 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.270
 It will be difficult to loosen the obi 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:55.220
 Adjust the shape of the feathers 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:58.400
 Check again if it is symmetrical 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:02.170
 Wings of the above with a movement 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.170
 Lower the wings 

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:08.870
 It is the completion of flower paperback 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:11.490
 Hmm 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:22.350
 of 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.400
 Hmm 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.400
 Cormorants Uu 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.430
