00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.960 

tank<00:02:54.770> by<00:02:54.920> the<00:02:54.980> way<00:02:55.130> it<00:02:55.220> definitely<00:02:55.550> controls

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
tank by the way it definitely controls

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.870 
tank by the way it definitely controls
kind<00:02:56.870> of<00:02:56.930> heavily<00:02:57.230> it's<00:02:57.410> not<00:02:57.560> super<00:02:58.070> mobile<00:02:58.220> so

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:36.230 
I think they did a decent job of
balancing<00:03:01.280> out<00:03:01.700> the<00:03:01.730> units<00:03:02.120> here
