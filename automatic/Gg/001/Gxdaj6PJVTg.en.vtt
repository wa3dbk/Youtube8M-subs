00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
ms is inflammation around the nerves the

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.350 
ms is inflammation around the nerves the
water<00:02:10.599> molecules<00:02:11.170> there<00:02:11.650> are<00:02:11.709> more<00:02:11.890> water

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
water molecules there are more water

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.850 
water molecules there are more water
Kollek<00:02:12.510> eul's<00:02:12.690> there<00:02:13.020> and<00:02:13.200> they<00:02:13.260> vibrate<00:02:13.680> more

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
Kollek eul's there and they vibrate more

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.490 
Kollek eul's there and they vibrate more
so<00:02:14.190> really<00:02:14.520> looking<00:02:14.850> at<00:02:14.910> water<00:02:15.150> why<00:02:15.990> our<00:02:16.170> MRIs

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
so really looking at water why our MRIs

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.800 
so really looking at water why our MRIs
an<00:02:16.980> important<00:02:17.460> diagnostic<00:02:17.730> tool<00:02:18.270> for<00:02:18.300> people

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
an important diagnostic tool for people

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.920 
an important diagnostic tool for people
with<00:02:18.930> ms<00:02:19.230> ms<00:02:20.060> presents<00:02:21.060> in<00:02:21.270> a<00:02:21.330> really<00:02:21.690> typical

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
with ms ms presents in a really typical

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.010 
with ms ms presents in a really typical
way<00:02:22.470> and<00:02:22.920> if<00:02:23.580> you<00:02:23.670> see<00:02:23.910> that<00:02:24.120> typical<00:02:24.600> pattern

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
way and if you see that typical pattern

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.830 
way and if you see that typical pattern
you<00:02:25.260> have<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:25.560> enosis<00:02:26.220> right<00:02:26.430> there

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
you have the enosis right there

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.880 
you have the enosis right there
especially<00:02:27.840> if<00:02:27.930> you<00:02:28.020> have<00:02:28.200> a<00:02:28.230> pattern<00:02:28.560> that

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
especially if you have a pattern that

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.430 
especially if you have a pattern that
clinically<00:02:29.220> goes<00:02:29.490> along<00:02:29.760> with<00:02:29.820> ms<00:02:30.120> and<00:02:30.660> what

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
clinically goes along with ms and what

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.220 
clinically goes along with ms and what
exactly<00:02:31.770> is<00:02:32.010> the<00:02:32.370> MRI<00:02:32.640> measuring<00:02:33.390> I<00:02:33.630> know<00:02:34.050> you

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
exactly is the MRI measuring I know you

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.420 
exactly is the MRI measuring I know you
said<00:02:34.500> so<00:02:34.620> it's<00:02:34.830> measuring<00:02:35.040> the<00:02:35.250> water

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
said so it's measuring the water

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.550 
said so it's measuring the water
molecules<00:02:35.850> but<00:02:36.000> what<00:02:36.120> does<00:02:36.210> it<00:02:36.240> seen<00:02:36.560> it's

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
molecules but what does it seen it's

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.370 
molecules but what does it seen it's
seeing<00:02:37.950> little<00:02:38.910> white<00:02:39.240> lines<00:02:39.570> that<00:02:40.170> radiate

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
seeing little white lines that radiate

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.530 
seeing little white lines that radiate
from<00:02:40.680> the<00:02:41.190> ventricles<00:02:41.670> which<00:02:41.760> are<00:02:42.090> the<00:02:42.270> spaces

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
from the ventricles which are the spaces

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.660 
from the ventricles which are the spaces
in<00:02:43.020> the<00:02:43.230> middle<00:02:43.500> of<00:02:43.650> the<00:02:43.770> brain<00:02:43.980> where<00:02:44.550> the

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
in the middle of the brain where the

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.240 
in the middle of the brain where the
fluid<00:02:44.850> goes<00:02:45.380> this<00:02:46.380> look<00:02:46.560> it<00:02:46.800> looks<00:02:47.040> like

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
fluid goes this look it looks like

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.900 
fluid goes this look it looks like
fingers

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
fingers

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.330 
fingers
it's<00:02:48.780> called<00:02:48.959> Dawson's<00:02:49.410> fingers<00:02:49.770> and<00:02:50.040> we're

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
it's called Dawson's fingers and we're

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.400 
it's called Dawson's fingers and we're
looking<00:02:50.610> for<00:02:50.760> Dawson's<00:02:51.120> fingers<00:02:51.450> so<00:02:52.140> talk<00:02:52.380> to

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
looking for Dawson's fingers so talk to

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.530 
looking for Dawson's fingers so talk to
me<00:02:52.620> when<00:02:52.770> someone<00:02:52.980> says<00:02:53.310> oh<00:02:53.489> I<00:02:53.520> had<00:02:53.850> an<00:02:53.940> MRI<00:02:54.180> and

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
me when someone says oh I had an MRI and

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.780 
me when someone says oh I had an MRI and
I<00:02:54.630> saw<00:02:55.140> that<00:02:55.470> there<00:02:55.620> were<00:02:55.680> three<00:02:55.950> lesions<00:02:56.370> what

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
I saw that there were three lesions what

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.610 
I saw that there were three lesions what
does<00:02:56.880> that<00:02:56.910> mean<00:02:57.270> mm-hmm<00:02:57.690> well<00:02:58.170> that<00:02:58.440> means

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
does that mean mm-hmm well that means

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.530 
does that mean mm-hmm well that means
they<00:02:58.890> hadn't<00:02:59.280> really<00:02:59.400> advanced<00:03:00.000> the<00:03:00.150> point<00:03:00.390> of

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
they hadn't really advanced the point of

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:01.910 
they hadn't really advanced the point of
having<00:03:00.630> what<00:03:00.870> we<00:03:00.900> called<00:03:01.140> Dawson's<00:03:01.560> fingers

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
having what we called Dawson's fingers

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.710 
having what we called Dawson's fingers
and<00:03:02.250> it<00:03:02.310> meant<00:03:02.489> that<00:03:02.670> they<00:03:02.820> have<00:03:03.000> little<00:03:03.330> round

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
and it meant that they have little round

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.470 
and it meant that they have little round
or<00:03:04.050> oval<00:03:04.400> areas<00:03:05.400> that<00:03:05.700> are<00:03:06.000> areas<00:03:06.450> of

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
or oval areas that are areas of

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.470 
or oval areas that are areas of
demyelination<00:03:07.700> inflammation<00:03:08.700> more<00:03:09.209> water

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
demyelination inflammation more water

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.650 
demyelination inflammation more water
and<00:03:09.750> that's<00:03:10.140> what<00:03:10.290> they're<00:03:10.410> seeing<00:03:11.239> how<00:03:12.239> often

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
and that's what they're seeing how often

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.330 
and that's what they're seeing how often
do<00:03:12.810> you<00:03:12.930> feel<00:03:13.170> that<00:03:13.440> people<00:03:13.620> and<00:03:14.100> patients

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
do you feel that people and patients

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.789 
do you feel that people and patients
with<00:03:15.120> MS<00:03:15.450> should<00:03:15.750> have<00:03:15.900> an<00:03:15.989> MRI<00:03:16.320> well<00:03:16.769> I

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
with MS should have an MRI well I

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:19.039 
with MS should have an MRI well I
believe<00:03:17.040> everybody<00:03:17.610> needs<00:03:18.030> an<00:03:18.180> MRI<00:03:18.299> to<00:03:18.900> have<00:03:19.019> a

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
believe everybody needs an MRI to have a

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:20.930 
believe everybody needs an MRI to have a
diagnosis<00:03:19.680> first<00:03:19.950> of<00:03:20.130> all<00:03:20.280> you<00:03:20.459> can't<00:03:20.700> really

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
diagnosis first of all you can't really

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.520 
diagnosis first of all you can't really
make<00:03:21.090> a<00:03:21.150> diagnosis<00:03:21.780> for<00:03:21.900> sure<00:03:22.110> without<00:03:22.260> the

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
make a diagnosis for sure without the

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.420 
make a diagnosis for sure without the
MRI<00:03:22.830> and<00:03:23.330> I'm<00:03:24.330> a<00:03:25.019> strong<00:03:25.530> believer<00:03:25.769> have<00:03:26.250> been

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
MRI and I'm a strong believer have been

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.009 
MRI and I'm a strong believer have been
for<00:03:26.670> a<00:03:26.700> long<00:03:26.880> time<00:03:27.150> and<00:03:27.360> probably<00:03:27.570> was<00:03:27.810> one<00:03:27.900> of

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
for a long time and probably was one of

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:29.600 
for a long time and probably was one of
the<00:03:28.080> first<00:03:28.290> believers<00:03:28.739> that<00:03:28.950> a<00:03:28.980> person<00:03:29.400> needs

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
the first believers that a person needs

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.610 
the first believers that a person needs
a<00:03:29.820> MRI<00:03:30.299> of<00:03:30.600> the<00:03:30.810> upper<00:03:31.080> part<00:03:31.260> of<00:03:31.290> the<00:03:31.410> spinal

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
a MRI of the upper part of the spinal

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.800 
a MRI of the upper part of the spinal
cord<00:03:31.830> too<00:03:32.100> because<00:03:32.850> a<00:03:32.880> lot<00:03:33.000> of<00:03:33.209> lesions<00:03:33.660> occur

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
cord too because a lot of lesions occur

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.440 
cord too because a lot of lesions occur
there<00:03:34.250> once<00:03:35.250> you<00:03:35.430> have<00:03:35.640> the<00:03:35.820> diagnosis

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
there once you have the diagnosis

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.960 
there once you have the diagnosis
established<00:03:37.110> in<00:03:37.380> our<00:03:37.860> practice<00:03:38.430> I<00:03:38.670> believe

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
established in our practice I believe

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.580 
established in our practice I believe
that<00:03:39.239> you<00:03:39.330> need<00:03:39.510> to<00:03:39.630> do<00:03:39.780> it<00:03:39.930> about<00:03:40.110> every<00:03:40.410> two

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
that you need to do it about every two

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.039 
that you need to do it about every two
years<00:03:40.890> and<00:03:41.250> the<00:03:41.850> reason<00:03:42.000> you<00:03:42.239> do<00:03:42.420> is<00:03:42.720> because

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
years and the reason you do is because

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:45.890 
years and the reason you do is because
you<00:03:43.380> can<00:03:43.530> have<00:03:43.769> hidden<00:03:44.390> lesions<00:03:45.390> that<00:03:45.780> the

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
you can have hidden lesions that the

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.229 
you can have hidden lesions that the
patient<00:03:46.260> isn't<00:03:46.470> aware<00:03:46.769> of<00:03:47.030> they're<00:03:48.030> called

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
patient isn't aware of they're called

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:49.910 
patient isn't aware of they're called
silent<00:03:48.750> I<00:03:48.900> don't<00:03:49.110> believe<00:03:49.320> they're<00:03:49.500> silent

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
silent I don't believe they're silent

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.140 
silent I don't believe they're silent
because<00:03:50.070> they're<00:03:50.370> taking<00:03:50.700> a<00:03:50.790> toll<00:03:51.000> on<00:03:51.030> a

be causing depression and we know it's

be causing depression and we know it's
doing<00:03:58.769> these<00:03:58.890> things<00:03:59.070> because<00:03:59.459> depression

doing these things because depression

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.610 
doing these things because depression
and<00:04:00.090> cognitive<00:04:00.209> impairment<00:04:00.900> are<00:04:01.019> are<00:04:01.350> very

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
and cognitive impairment are are very

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.090 
and cognitive impairment are are very
prevalent<00:04:02.310> no-mess<00:04:02.820> right<00:04:03.630> so<00:04:03.989> but<00:04:04.950> what

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
prevalent no-mess right so but what

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.830 
prevalent no-mess right so but what
you're<00:04:05.220> saying<00:04:05.430> is<00:04:05.670> by<00:04:05.850> taking<00:04:06.060> an<00:04:06.269> MRI<00:04:06.630> it's

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
you're saying is by taking an MRI it's

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.199 
you're saying is by taking an MRI it's
actually<00:04:07.260> possible<00:04:07.739> to<00:04:07.920> see<00:04:08.160> that<00:04:08.820> there

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
actually possible to see that there

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:11.270 
actually possible to see that there
there<00:04:09.660> is<00:04:09.690> activity<00:04:10.170> happening<00:04:10.829> in<00:04:11.040> a<00:04:11.160> way

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
there is activity happening in a way

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.770 
there is activity happening in a way
that<00:04:11.579> may<00:04:11.850> be<00:04:11.910> affecting<00:04:12.420> somebody's

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
that may be affecting somebody's

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.330 
that may be affecting somebody's
thinking<00:04:12.959> and<00:04:13.410> the<00:04:13.620> answer<00:04:13.950> is<00:04:14.130> that's

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
thinking and the answer is that's

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.099 
thinking and the answer is that's
correct<00:04:14.610> and<00:04:14.850> reason<00:04:15.299> that's<00:04:15.420> important<00:04:15.930> is

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
correct and reason that's important is

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:18.979 
correct and reason that's important is
because<00:04:16.440> you<00:04:16.919> we<00:04:17.400> have<00:04:17.579> so<00:04:17.790> many<00:04:17.940> good<00:04:18.239> disease

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
because you we have so many good disease

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.050 
because you we have so many good disease
modifying<00:04:19.470> treatments<00:04:19.890> available<00:04:19.979> now

drug we have better options now so you

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.190 
drug we have better options now so you
you<00:04:31.110> you<00:04:31.410> don't<00:04:31.650> want<00:04:31.860> those<00:04:32.040> to<00:04:32.100> get<00:04:32.669> so<00:04:32.880> bad

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:33.200 
you you don't want those to get so bad

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.659 
you you don't want those to get so bad
as<00:04:34.200> to<00:04:34.380> cause<00:04:34.560> major<00:04:34.889> problems<00:04:35.040> you<00:04:35.430> want<00:04:35.610> to
