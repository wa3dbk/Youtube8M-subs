many<00:00:09.110> times<00:00:09.410> we<00:00:09.740> have<00:00:09.920> practices<00:00:10.660> management

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:11.660 
many times we have practices management

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:13.600 
many times we have practices management
practices<00:00:12.050> that<00:00:12.170> we<00:00:12.290> want<00:00:12.470> to<00:00:12.559> do<00:00:12.710> or<00:00:13.190> we<00:00:13.400> can

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:13.610 
practices that we want to do or we can

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:15.370 
practices that we want to do or we can
get<00:00:13.730> by<00:00:13.910> with<00:00:13.940> cutting<00:00:14.780> trees<00:00:14.990> down<00:00:15.019> with<00:00:15.230> a

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:15.380 
get by with cutting trees down with a

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.409 
get by with cutting trees down with a
chainsaw<00:00:15.620> and<00:00:16.460> this<00:00:16.579> is<00:00:16.669> a<00:00:16.730> situation<00:00:16.939> here

00:00:17.409 --> 00:00:17.419 
chainsaw and this is a situation here

00:00:17.419 --> 00:00:19.989 
chainsaw and this is a situation here
where<00:00:17.449> we've<00:00:17.720> got<00:00:17.749> we've<00:00:18.619> got<00:00:18.829> a<00:00:19.279> number<00:00:19.880> of

00:00:19.989 --> 00:00:19.999 
where we've got we've got a number of

00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:23.259 
where we've got we've got a number of
small<00:00:20.300> trees<00:00:20.630> in<00:00:20.839> this<00:00:20.989> stand<00:00:21.489> beech<00:00:22.489> maple

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:23.269 
small trees in this stand beech maple

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:26.679 
small trees in this stand beech maple
other<00:00:24.140> typical<00:00:24.529> understory<00:00:25.220> trees<00:00:25.579> and<00:00:26.480> we

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:26.689 
other typical understory trees and we

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:29.800 
other typical understory trees and we
want<00:00:26.929> those<00:00:27.140> removed<00:00:27.679> before<00:00:28.310> we<00:00:28.550> do<00:00:28.880> a<00:00:29.119> timber

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:29.810 
want those removed before we do a timber

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.439 
want those removed before we do a timber
harvest<00:00:29.989> and<00:00:30.409> so<00:00:31.039> one<00:00:31.339> way<00:00:31.519> of<00:00:31.729> getting<00:00:32.119> rid<00:00:32.300> of

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:32.449 
harvest and so one way of getting rid of

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:34.540 
harvest and so one way of getting rid of
those<00:00:32.629> of<00:00:32.809> course<00:00:33.050> is<00:00:33.440> with<00:00:33.680> a<00:00:33.710> chainsaw<00:00:34.039> and

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:34.550 
those of course is with a chainsaw and

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.639 
those of course is with a chainsaw and
and<00:00:35.180> remember<00:00:35.840> that<00:00:35.989> you<00:00:36.109> have<00:00:36.260> all<00:00:36.469> your

00:00:36.639 --> 00:00:36.649 
and remember that you have all your

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:38.740 
and remember that you have all your
personal<00:00:36.949> protective<00:00:37.370> equipment<00:00:37.579> on<00:00:38.059> like<00:00:38.600> we

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 
personal protective equipment on like we

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.290 
personal protective equipment on like we
have<00:00:38.929> here<00:00:39.289> and<00:00:40.160> then<00:00:40.460> go<00:00:41.000> through<00:00:41.210> the

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
have here and then go through the

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.970 
have here and then go through the
process<00:00:41.750> of<00:00:41.840> cutting<00:00:42.050> all<00:00:42.320> these<00:00:42.530> unwanted

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
process of cutting all these unwanted

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:58.090 
process of cutting all these unwanted
trees<00:00:43.460> in<00:00:44.359> your<00:00:44.899> woods

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.770 

now<00:00:59.100> that's<00:00:59.610> pretty<00:00:59.850> simple<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.329> do<00:01:00.480> when<00:01:00.630> it's

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
now that's pretty simple to do when it's

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.450 
now that's pretty simple to do when it's
one<00:01:00.930> tree<00:01:01.230> but<00:01:01.410> it's<00:01:01.559> much<00:01:01.710> more<00:01:01.739> difficult

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
one tree but it's much more difficult

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.759 
one tree but it's much more difficult
when<00:01:02.940> you<00:01:03.090> do<00:01:03.300> hundreds<00:01:04.050> of<00:01:04.199> trees<00:01:04.409> per<00:01:04.680> acre

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
when you do hundreds of trees per acre

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.700 
when you do hundreds of trees per acre
like<00:01:05.220> this<00:01:05.519> but<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.869> chainsaw<00:01:07.320> certainly

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
like this but the chainsaw certainly

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.320 
like this but the chainsaw certainly
could<00:01:07.860> be<00:01:07.920> used<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.190> do<00:01:08.340> that<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:08.970> notice<00:01:09.240> that

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
could be used to do that you notice that

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.969 
could be used to do that you notice that
I<00:01:09.390> cut<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.750> stump<00:01:10.020> pretty<00:01:10.229> low<00:01:10.440> what<00:01:10.650> you<00:01:10.770> want

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
I cut the stump pretty low what you want

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.700 
I cut the stump pretty low what you want
to<00:01:11.070> do<00:01:11.250> obviously<00:01:12.259> and<00:01:13.259> and<00:01:15.020> this<00:01:16.020> practice<00:01:16.500> of

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
to do obviously and and this practice of

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.590 
to do obviously and and this practice of
cutting<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.580> trees<00:01:17.820> like<00:01:18.000> this<00:01:18.210> with<00:01:18.570> a

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
cutting the trees like this with a

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.140 
cutting the trees like this with a
chainsaw<00:01:18.900> is<00:01:19.229> fine<00:01:19.500> if<00:01:20.460> you're<00:01:20.759> not<00:01:20.940> going<00:01:21.090> to

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
chainsaw is fine if you're not going to

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.719 
chainsaw is fine if you're not going to
worry<00:01:21.420> about<00:01:21.509> stump<00:01:22.110> sprouting<00:01:22.619> now<00:01:23.130> all<00:01:23.460> our

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
worry about stump sprouting now all our

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.340 
worry about stump sprouting now all our
hardwood<00:01:24.119> species<00:01:24.690> are<00:01:24.840> going<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.110> stump

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
hardwood species are going to stump

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.800 
hardwood species are going to stump
sprout<00:01:25.680> this<00:01:26.520> beech<00:01:26.850> certainly<00:01:27.390> will<00:01:27.540> stump

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
sprout this beech certainly will stump

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.600 
sprout this beech certainly will stump
sprout<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:29.009> that<00:01:29.220> will<00:01:29.369> have<00:01:29.580> a

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
sprout and that will have a

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.279 
sprout and that will have a
proliferation<00:01:30.149> of<00:01:30.450> sprouts<00:01:30.780> coming<00:01:31.140> from

00:01:31.279 --> 00:01:31.289 
proliferation of sprouts coming from

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:33.219 
proliferation of sprouts coming from
this<00:01:31.530> if<00:01:31.770> that's<00:01:32.310> going<00:01:32.550> to<00:01:32.610> be<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:32.759> problem

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
this if that's going to be a problem

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:35.870 
this if that's going to be a problem
then<00:01:34.229> that<00:01:34.470> sprouting<00:01:35.009> needs<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.759> be

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
then that sprouting needs to be

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.070 
then that sprouting needs to be
controlled<00:01:36.300> and<00:01:36.420> you<00:01:36.539> can<00:01:36.660> work<00:01:36.840> with<00:01:36.869> your

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080 
controlled and you can work with your

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.380 
controlled and you can work with your
Forester<00:01:37.619> to<00:01:37.740> determine<00:01:38.220> when<00:01:38.940> that<00:01:39.149> might<00:01:39.360> be

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
Forester to determine when that might be

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.570 
Forester to determine when that might be
and<00:01:39.869> we're<00:01:40.320> gonna<00:01:40.410> control<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.070> sprouting<00:01:41.490> on

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:41.580 
and we're gonna control the sprouting on

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.359 
and we're gonna control the sprouting on
this<00:01:41.789> stump<00:01:42.330> using<00:01:43.289> chemicals<00:01:43.770> so<00:01:43.950> let's<00:01:44.160> talk

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
this stump using chemicals so let's talk

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.040 
this stump using chemicals so let's talk
a<00:01:44.429> little<00:01:44.550> bit<00:01:44.820> about<00:01:44.850> how<00:01:45.539> we<00:01:45.600> would<00:01:45.810> go<00:01:45.960> about

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.050 
a little bit about how we would go about

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:47.810 
a little bit about how we would go about
doing<00:01:46.200> that<00:01:46.590> so<00:01:47.100> when<00:01:47.250> you<00:01:47.340> have<00:01:47.490> a<00:01:47.520> situation

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
doing that so when you have a situation

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.820 
doing that so when you have a situation
where<00:01:48.360> you've<00:01:48.509> got<00:01:48.720> up<00:01:48.899> you've<00:01:49.380> got<00:01:49.560> trees

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 
where you've got up you've got trees

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.560 
where you've got up you've got trees
that<00:01:50.009> you've<00:01:50.160> cut<00:01:50.399> down<00:01:50.429> and<00:01:50.940> you<00:01:51.330> want<00:01:51.509> to

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
that you've cut down and you want to

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.749 
that you've cut down and you want to
control<00:01:51.899> their<00:01:52.050> sprouting<00:01:52.590> you<00:01:53.070> can<00:01:53.250> use<00:01:53.520> what

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
control their sprouting you can use what

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.690 
control their sprouting you can use what
we<00:01:53.789> call<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:54.300> cut<00:01:54.660> stump<00:01:54.960> treatment<00:01:55.500> which<00:01:56.460> is

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
we call a cut stump treatment which is

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.300 
we call a cut stump treatment which is
you<00:01:57.539> you<00:01:57.899> do<00:01:58.110> that<00:01:58.289> just<00:01:58.560> like<00:01:58.679> that<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:59.130> name

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
you you do that just like that the name

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.880 
you you do that just like that the name
implies<00:01:59.700> you<00:02:00.390> cut<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.049> trees<00:02:01.259> down<00:02:01.290> creating

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
implies you cut the trees down creating

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.350 
implies you cut the trees down creating
a<00:02:01.920> stump<00:02:02.189> which<00:02:02.369> we've<00:02:02.549> done<00:02:02.700> here<00:02:03.000> we've<00:02:03.180> got

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
a stump which we've done here we've got

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.300 
a stump which we've done here we've got
a<00:02:03.420> small<00:02:03.479> beech<00:02:03.960> tree<00:02:04.259> down<00:02:04.470> we<00:02:04.920> want<00:02:05.040> to<00:02:05.159> make

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
a small beech tree down we want to make

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.249 
a small beech tree down we want to make
sure<00:02:05.490> that<00:02:05.670> it's<00:02:05.820> not<00:02:06.000> going<00:02:06.150> to<00:02:06.240> sprout<00:02:06.509> so<00:02:07.079> we

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
sure that it's not going to sprout so we

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.410 
sure that it's not going to sprout so we
can<00:02:07.409> take<00:02:07.619> chemical<00:02:08.160> that<00:02:08.369> that<00:02:08.670> is<00:02:08.850> that's

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
can take chemical that that is that's

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.270 
can take chemical that that is that's
labeled<00:02:09.899> for<00:02:09.959> this<00:02:10.200> use<00:02:10.470> for<00:02:10.679> this<00:02:10.799> cut<00:02:11.040> stump

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280

that stump the chemical label will tell

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.310 
that stump the chemical label will tell
you<00:02:56.070> how<00:02:56.850> long<00:02:57.090> you<00:02:57.269> have<00:02:57.510> once<00:02:57.840> you<00:02:57.989> cut<00:02:58.170> that

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
you how long you have once you cut that

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.630 
you how long you have once you cut that
stump<00:02:58.560> to<00:02:58.739> apply<00:02:58.920> the<00:02:58.980> chemical<00:02:59.400> code<00:02:59.489> would

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
stump to apply the chemical code would

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.789 
stump to apply the chemical code would
be<00:02:59.730> two<00:02:59.940> hours<00:03:00.299> could<00:03:00.540> be<00:03:00.630> eight<00:03:00.810> hours<00:03:00.840> but

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
be two hours could be eight hours but

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:03.949 
be two hours could be eight hours but
but<00:03:02.040> certainly<00:03:02.280> it's<00:03:02.700> the<00:03:02.880> day<00:03:03.060> that<00:03:03.390> that<00:03:03.780> you

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
but certainly it's the day that that you

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.140 
but certainly it's the day that that you
you<00:03:04.290> cut<00:03:04.530> and<00:03:04.769> the<00:03:04.860> fresher<00:03:05.129> the<00:03:05.400> better<00:03:05.430> so

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
you cut and the fresher the better so

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.910 
you cut and the fresher the better so
here<00:03:06.390> we<00:03:06.510> had<00:03:06.690> a<00:03:06.720> stump<00:03:07.050> that<00:03:07.110> we<00:03:07.290> just<00:03:07.560> cut<00:03:07.739> it

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
here we had a stump that we just cut it

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.100 
here we had a stump that we just cut it
was<00:03:08.040> fresh<00:03:08.310> sprayed<00:03:09.030> the<00:03:09.150> chemical<00:03:09.569> on<00:03:09.660> it

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
was fresh sprayed the chemical on it

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.170 
was fresh sprayed the chemical on it
to<00:03:10.230> absorb<00:03:10.560> down<00:03:10.740> in<00:03:10.920> there<00:03:11.100> and<00:03:11.820> it'll<00:03:11.970> do<00:03:12.150> a

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
to absorb down in there and it'll do a

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.940 
to absorb down in there and it'll do a
good<00:03:12.480> effective<00:03:12.930> job<00:03:13.200> of<00:03:13.230> controlling<00:03:13.740> the

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
good effective job of controlling the

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.400 
good effective job of controlling the
sprouting<00:03:14.510> from<00:03:15.510> this<00:03:15.660> stump<00:03:15.930> and<00:03:16.050> now<00:03:16.140> notice

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
sprouting from this stump and now notice

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.680 
sprouting from this stump and now notice
that<00:03:16.830> that<00:03:17.760> also<00:03:17.910> something<00:03:18.330> I<00:03:18.390> want<00:03:18.510> to<00:03:18.570> point

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
that that also something I want to point

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.350 
that that also something I want to point
out<00:03:18.870> the<00:03:19.080> the<00:03:19.350> this<00:03:19.890> chemical<00:03:20.190> was<00:03:20.400> purple<00:03:20.850> and

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
out the the this chemical was purple and

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.540 
out the the this chemical was purple and
it<00:03:21.900> was<00:03:22.020> purple<00:03:22.350> because<00:03:22.650> we<00:03:22.800> put<00:03:23.010> a<00:03:23.040> dye<00:03:23.310> in

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
it was purple because we put a dye in

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.910 
it was purple because we put a dye in
the<00:03:23.640> chemical<00:03:24.030> and<00:03:24.240> we<00:03:24.930> put<00:03:25.170> a<00:03:25.200> dye<00:03:25.410> in<00:03:25.620> the<00:03:25.740> kit

of<00:03:53.610> the<00:03:54.120> wood<00:03:54.360> and<00:03:54.690> and<00:03:55.140> and<00:03:55.560> including<00:03:56.220> you

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:56.520 
of the wood and and and including you

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.220 
of the wood and and and including you
want<00:03:56.700> to<00:03:56.760> treat<00:03:56.940> the<00:03:57.090> outer<00:03:57.270> bark<00:03:57.570> as<00:03:57.780> well<00:03:57.959> so

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
want to treat the outer bark as well so

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:59.840 
want to treat the outer bark as well so
it's<00:03:58.350> a<00:03:58.440> band<00:03:58.739> around<00:03:59.370> the<00:03:59.459> outside<00:03:59.760> the

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
it's a band around the outside the

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:01.880 
it's a band around the outside the
middle<00:04:00.180> of<00:04:00.300> the<00:04:00.420> tree<00:04:00.690> or<00:04:00.870> the<00:04:01.110> heartwood<00:04:01.739> of

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
middle of the tree or the heartwood of

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:03.590 
middle of the tree or the heartwood of
the<00:04:01.980> tree<00:04:02.250> you<00:04:02.790> wouldn't<00:04:03.180> necessarily<00:04:03.300> have

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
the tree you wouldn't necessarily have

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.199 
the tree you wouldn't necessarily have
to<00:04:03.810> treat<00:04:04.110> it<00:04:04.290> and<00:04:04.530> so<00:04:05.130> in<00:04:05.280> this<00:04:05.430> case<00:04:05.670> using<00:04:05.970> it

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
to treat it and so in this case using it

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:09.620 
to treat it and so in this case using it
using<00:04:06.600> a<00:04:06.720> using<00:04:07.410> the<00:04:07.730> backpack<00:04:08.730> sprayer<00:04:09.120> you

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
using a using the backpack sprayer you

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.170 
using a using the backpack sprayer you
can<00:04:09.810> simply<00:04:10.230> run<00:04:10.500> your<00:04:11.220> chemical<00:04:11.760> around<00:04:12.060> the

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
can simply run your chemical around the

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.920 
can simply run your chemical around the
outside<00:04:12.690> of<00:04:12.870> the<00:04:12.989> of<00:04:13.530> the<00:04:13.800> stump<00:04:14.100> like<00:04:14.340> this

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
outside of the of the stump like this

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:20.390 
outside of the of the stump like this
treating<00:04:15.930> that<00:04:18.109> surface<00:04:19.109> area<00:04:19.470> on<00:04:19.650> the

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
treating that surface area on the

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.120 
treating that surface area on the
outside<00:04:21.120> of<00:04:21.269> the<00:04:21.359> stump<00:04:21.630> and<00:04:21.840> the<00:04:22.320> bark<00:04:22.590> and

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
outside of the stump and the bark and

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.370 
outside of the stump and the bark and
that's<00:04:23.850> where<00:04:24.060> the<00:04:24.180> living<00:04:24.390> tissue<00:04:24.630> is<00:04:24.960> at<00:04:25.140> and

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
that's where the living tissue is at and

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.409 
that's where the living tissue is at and
that<00:04:25.800> chemical<00:04:26.070> will<00:04:26.490> be<00:04:26.640> absorbed<00:04:27.090> down<00:04:27.240> in

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:27.419 
that chemical will be absorbed down in

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:27.920 
that chemical will be absorbed down in
the<00:04:27.510> stump

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
the stump

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:29.510 
the stump
transfer<00:04:28.560> it<00:04:28.620> into<00:04:28.770> roots<00:04:29.010> and<00:04:29.280> and

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
transfer it into roots and and

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.770 
transfer it into roots and and
