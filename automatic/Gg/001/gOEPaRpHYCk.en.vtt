romhack but the best example I give is
well<00:02:51.600> there's<00:02:51.750> repetitious<00:02:52.290> use<00:02:52.470> of<00:02:52.680> a<00:02:52.830> lot<00:02:53.040> of

well there's repetitious use of a lot of

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.380 
well there's repetitious use of a lot of
the<00:02:53.280> music<00:02:53.430> that<00:02:53.550> it's<00:02:53.760> used<00:02:53.940> from<00:02:54.150> level

the music that it's used from level

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.870 
the music that it's used from level
level<00:02:54.750> for<00:02:55.170> example<00:02:55.590> in<00:02:55.770> the<00:02:56.070> ice<00:02:56.310> world<00:02:56.610> of

the<00:02:57.090> snow<00:02:57.390> theme<00:02:57.630> from<00:02:57.870> Sonic<00:02:58.200> Advance<00:02:58.440> plays

and nearly every level just a little bit

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.920 
and nearly every level just a little bit
more<00:03:02.190> variety<00:03:02.460> would<00:03:02.970> have<00:03:03.120> helped<00:03:03.540> break<00:03:03.720> up

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
more variety would have helped break up

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.440 
more variety would have helped break up
the<00:03:04.050> monotony<00:03:04.320> a<00:03:04.530> little<00:03:04.830> bit<00:03:05.180> on<00:03:06.180> another
