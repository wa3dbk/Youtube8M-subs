00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.160
 I present you my best friend from 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.350
 moment the kobold to 202 for work a 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:22.380
 robot vacuum cleaner really very 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:24.720
 powerful if it is efficient in fact 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.220
 only air 200 well it's thanks to one 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.160
 particularities of the mark this is the 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.630
 laser range finder that scans the room 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.250
 permanence when the vacuum cleaner gets 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.840
 move to ensure coverage 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.270
 almost perfect 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.579
 of course the product and donations 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.559
 that he will not go under all the furniture 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.570
 low but his intelligence allows him 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.010
 really going to clean up 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.690
 in corners where along baseboards 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.129
 to go to the corners precisely and 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.610
 well it is equipped with a rotating brush 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.960
 on its front part since the product has 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.270
 a form in which allows him therefore 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.460
 to go very well against the 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.840
 walls with 90 degree angles and then 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.690
 especially the central brush actually 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.829
 occupies the entire width or almost 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.890
 the vacuum cleaner which allows it so 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.510
 to be effective with a single pass the 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.100
 product ensures very good 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.439
 performance on the floors 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.689
 hardwood floor tiles lino but also 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.970
 on more complicated soils like the 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.009
 carpeting or long pile carpets 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.810
 a bit like all its competitors this 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.220
 vacuum cleaner offers a mode of 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.900
 programming you will be able to 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.820
 scheduled hours of cleaning 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.560
 depending on the days of the week 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.450
 it is also highly recommended 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.369
 since if he is very efficient he is 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.680
 also very noisy we measured near 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.200
 70 of the 1 m of the vacuum cleaner 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.150
 another positive point that contributed to 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.430
 the intelligence of this vacuum cleaner to good 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.220
 these are the 3 proximity sensors 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.470
 who will avoid this robot from coming 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.049
 hurting yourself and well the complaints are 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.280
 the furniture he will get really close 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.470
 very gently from all obstacles 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.240
 to come and get around it 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.549
 multiplied tests so depending on 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.920
 different surfaces supported by this 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.680
 vacuum cleaner here on the carpet of our 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.479
 stock is well we responded to both the 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.430
 semolina rice from the remains of 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.450
 crackers a little grind we'll see it 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.450
 works pretty well 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.830
 the centralbrush we talked about it all to 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.750
 the time is great 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.890
 effective but in fact this is the first 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.080
 time it happens we could 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.330
 find that the plastic blades are 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.850
 are torn apart by three place so 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.110
 it's quite disturbing because in fact 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.250
 we can actually assume that this 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.420
 are for example hair that comes 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:30.630
 to get involved and who ended up 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:32.430
 severing the palms could so 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.930
 think that the balance sheet is overall very 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.900
 positive for doing this two way but he 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.200
 remains a last problem is the price 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.870
 EUR 749 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.970
 it's still 150 to 200 euros more 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.840
 expensive that some models really very 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.239
 performing also 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.840
 so in the end we can not recommend 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.840
 buying this product
