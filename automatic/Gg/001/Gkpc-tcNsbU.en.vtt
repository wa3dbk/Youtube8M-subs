00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
ado guys it's gonna be a little bit hard

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.670 
ado guys it's gonna be a little bit hard
for<00:01:15.060> me<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.299> show<00:01:15.540> you<00:01:15.600> guys<00:01:15.750> at<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.200> beginning

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
for me to show you guys at the beginning

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.530 
for me to show you guys at the beginning
I<00:01:16.799> did<00:01:17.580> I<00:01:17.610> actually<00:01:17.909> I<00:01:18.060> think<00:01:18.090> I'm<00:01:18.240> gonna<00:01:18.330> put

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
I did I actually I think I'm gonna put

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.990 
I did I actually I think I'm gonna put
an<00:01:18.659> example<00:01:19.140> in<00:01:19.259> right<00:01:19.530> now<00:01:19.860> or<00:01:20.700> maybe<00:01:20.880> a

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
an example in right now or maybe a

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.429 
an example in right now or maybe a
little<00:01:21.180> bit<00:01:21.360> before<00:01:21.479> that<00:01:21.689> of<00:01:21.840> what<00:01:22.200> this

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
little bit before that of what this

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.140 
little bit before that of what this
trick<00:01:22.710> show<00:01:22.830> actually<00:01:23.189> looks<00:01:23.430> like<00:01:23.610> because

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
trick show actually looks like because

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.520 
trick show actually looks like because
you<00:01:24.180> can't<00:01:24.600> see<00:01:24.900> it<00:01:25.020> from<00:01:25.170> my<00:01:25.470> perspective

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
you can't see it from my perspective

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.410 
you can't see it from my perspective
doing<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.340> tutorial<00:01:26.640> here<00:01:26.850> so<00:01:27.090> it's<00:01:27.180> gonna<00:01:27.299> be

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
doing the tutorial here so it's gonna be

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.090 
doing the tutorial here so it's gonna be
