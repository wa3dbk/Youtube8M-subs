 I have tutorials pro and good the other and 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.400
 everything that would be a new video 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.009
 tutorial in which I'm going to teach you 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.079
 how to download and install and step 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:25.169
 leave completely full what would be the 

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:28.410
 asian burning studio fully full 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:30.960
 in version 14 that of course the 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.120
 last currently compatible with 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.640
 versions of windows 7 and now with 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.170
 windows 8 so good to start 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.050
 what this program for those who do not 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.000
 they know is very simple is a program 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.580
 that is intended more to what would be the 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.519
 recording you decide you also divide for 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:49.440
 make different copies burn images 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:51.629
 now on albums also bluray and good 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.339
 it's an excellent program which is going to 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.530
 provide many options when it 

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:58.860
 you want to do anything with a cd or 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.869
 dvd to check well that your computer 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.970
 remember I'll give you what would be the 

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:05.860
 page so that you go to the part of 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:08.710
 requirements and you take a look 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.290
 and good what your computer needs 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.000
 as much as the processor ram memory 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.160
 and the rest for you to run 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.560
 completely fine without any problem 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.270
 so good once you have everything 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.240
 that and that you know that if you are going to return 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:25.229
 without any problem let's proceed with 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.229
 what would be the discharge 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.710
 I am currently uploading it and good not 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.210
 nothing happens as well as some that already in 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.190
 this case that you are seeing the 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.230
 video takes up the uploaded and good them 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.510
 I leave the link linked with gaspar ay 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:40.400
 wait 5 seconds without jumping advertising 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.650
 and they have to have the activity what 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.270
 it is the I speak for anything and good 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.770
 once we have what will be read 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.570
 the downloaded file will leave us a 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.390
 winrar file like this which we will give 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.400
 right click extract here and we'll wait 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.680
 that is extracted then that 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.870
 we will execute what would be the page and the 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.700
 folder that left us and here we would have 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.860
 what would the installer also be 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.130
 I leave the official page and the requirements 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.130
 of the system 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.640
 and let's first avoid everything that 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.129
 would be the installer that would be that way 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.410
 that we go double click and hope that we 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:14.430
 initiate any permit that asks you to 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.650
 yes 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.349
 and well, we hope that we get what we 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.510
 it would be this window in which we will give in 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:23.220
 this button we will click here 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.319
 select where you want to install it in 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.750
 my case I'll leave it like that and then 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:30.330
 we will give again in wire is in a 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.459
 language and medium rare and let's see it here 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.129
 this part that does not stop so we do not get 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.840
 this program and not language I do not know what 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:40.110
 language is that but logically everything is 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.120
 same here we go that name take we give a 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.250
 click there and we hope it was done 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.079
 what the program would be the program 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.260
 It weighs a lot so it will not delay 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:50.970
 so nothing what is the process of 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.980
 installation so we're not going to wait 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.980
 that we are completely installed 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.900
 once finished we will see here in the 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.700
 part of final we will click and it will 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.190
 will automatically open what would be 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.440
 the default program opens up but 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.569
 what you have to do now is close it 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.730
 in this case we will see continue and 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:22.560
 let's close it, let's give it all this 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.390
 to close to be able to leave full 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.459
 activating it as well as we do not give back 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:30.300
 to the folder and here in the part of 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:32.220
 registration to bs 2014 we will extract it because 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:35.310
 there would be what would be the file of 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.989
 record which we have to execute it 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.060
 here I also have what is my channel 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.920
 and social networks 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.959
 and good to this registry file only 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.329
 we have to double click and if you 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:48.060
 I go to some permission although yes and here we 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:51.120
 he says he will be what he is going to copy 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:53.069
 a record file I edit it and we go 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.230
 to see what I do not register it for 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:57.840
 here he tells us that everything has gone well and 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.329
 that things were added correctly 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.950
 to the registry then we will accept and 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:04.230
 we would have what the program would be 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.390
 completely full and we could already 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.190
 be using without any problem like that 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.580
 how good can you see if I 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:13.849
 we execute we have everything we have 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:16.350
 if we go to the part of my shampoo 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:18.810
 here if we go to the part of lerna 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:21.060
 boudou new sector shampoo of wands 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.790
 we click here shows us that 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:26.400
 is already activated with see here is and 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:28.260
 here is activated as you can see there is 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.880
 and well this would be all for this video 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.400
 as a family we have it completely 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.169
 full and good with this we would be 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.060
