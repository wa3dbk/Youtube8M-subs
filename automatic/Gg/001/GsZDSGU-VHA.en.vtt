relative<00:00:17.430> for<00:00:17.670> mass<00:00:17.940> I<00:00:18.869> guess<00:00:19.320> there's<00:00:19.500> a

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
relative for mass I guess there's a

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.740 
relative for mass I guess there's a
couple<00:00:19.740> records<00:00:20.010> that<00:00:20.640> destroyers<00:00:21.270> made<00:00:21.449> were

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
couple records that destroyers made were

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.880 
couple records that destroyers made were
maybe<00:00:22.680> I<00:00:22.830> thought<00:00:23.609> we<00:00:24.420> were<00:00:24.810> as<00:00:25.350> far<00:00:25.710> as

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
maybe I thought we were as far as

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.429 
maybe I thought we were as far as
trying<00:00:26.580> to<00:00:26.640> play<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:26.880> music<00:00:27.000> it's<00:00:27.420> live<00:00:27.660> but<00:00:28.410> I

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
trying to play the music it's live but I

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:29.810 
trying to play the music it's live but I
don't<00:00:28.650> really<00:00:28.740> think<00:00:28.920> about<00:00:29.039> that<00:00:29.189> when

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
don't really think about that when

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.690 
don't really think about that when
actually<00:00:30.269> making<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:30.929> songs<00:00:31.700> sometimes

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
actually making the songs sometimes

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.459 
actually making the songs sometimes
though<00:00:33.270> you<00:00:33.300> just<00:00:33.600> asked<00:00:33.989> people<00:00:34.020> who<00:00:34.290> played

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
though you just asked people who played

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.729 
though you just asked people who played
on<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.680> record<00:00:34.980> to<00:00:35.130> play<00:00:35.340> and<00:00:36.320> it<00:00:37.320> all<00:00:37.500> turns

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
on the record to play and it all turns

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.220 
on the record to play and it all turns
out<00:00:37.860> really<00:00:38.070> good<00:00:38.280> with<00:00:39.239> kaput<00:00:39.629> and<00:00:39.930> the

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
out really good with kaput and the

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:58.040 
out really good with kaput and the
players<00:00:40.800> that's<00:00:41.160> kind<00:00:41.430> of<00:00:56.539> like<00:00:57.539> these<00:00:57.780> songs

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
players that's kind of like these songs

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.240 
players that's kind of like these songs
that<00:00:58.260> were<00:00:58.379> playing<00:00:58.649> some<00:00:58.920> of<00:00:59.010> them<00:00:59.129> are

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
that were playing some of them are

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.130 
that were playing some of them are
pretty<00:00:59.370> involved<00:01:00.000> even<00:01:00.359> just<00:01:00.750> on<00:01:00.899> a<00:01:00.930> technical

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
pretty involved even just on a technical

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.920 
pretty involved even just on a technical
level<00:01:01.469> so<00:01:02.129> we<00:01:02.760> probably<00:01:03.120> didn't<00:01:03.390> learn<00:01:03.510> as

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
level so we probably didn't learn as

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.130 
level so we probably didn't learn as
many<00:01:04.470> older<00:01:05.040> songs<00:01:05.309> as<00:01:05.700> we<00:01:06.420> could<00:01:06.630> have<00:01:06.750> I<00:01:07.020> also

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
many older songs as we could have I also

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.989 
many older songs as we could have I also
hate<00:01:07.409> practicing

00:01:11.989 --> 00:01:11.999 

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:14.840 

there's<00:01:12.509> definitely<00:01:13.289> like<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.439> focus<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.490> we

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
there's definitely like a focus and we

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.520 
there's definitely like a focus and we
just<00:01:14.999> kind<00:01:15.149> of<00:01:15.179> went<00:01:15.359> cherry<00:01:15.600> picking<00:01:16.020> or<00:01:16.499> a

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
just kind of went cherry picking or a

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.459 
just kind of went cherry picking or a
couple<00:01:16.770> older<00:01:17.069> songs<00:01:17.310> that<00:01:17.640> we<00:01:17.759> thought<00:01:17.969> could

00:01:18.459 --> 00:01:18.469 
couple older songs that we thought could

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:22.459 
couple older songs that we thought could
be<00:01:19.469> like<00:01:20.090> ravaged<00:01:21.090> by<00:01:21.359> the<00:01:21.390> horn<00:01:21.689> players<00:01:21.990> and

00:01:22.459 --> 00:01:22.469 
be like ravaged by the horn players and

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:26.300 
be like ravaged by the horn players and
turn<00:01:23.250> out<00:01:23.429> better<00:01:24.060> for<00:01:24.420> it<00:01:24.569> you<00:01:24.719> know<00:01:25.280> well<00:01:26.280> I

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
turn out better for it you know well I

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.709 
turn out better for it you know well I
don't<00:01:26.549> sit<00:01:26.759> down<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.119> try<00:01:27.209> and<00:01:27.299> write<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.479> song

00:01:27.709 --> 00:01:27.719 
don't sit down and try and write a song

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:31.219 
don't sit down and try and write a song
you<00:01:28.590> never<00:01:28.679> never<00:01:29.429> tried<00:01:29.789> never<00:01:30.179> tried<00:01:30.869> I

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
you never never tried never tried I

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.380 
you never never tried never tried I
think<00:01:31.859> I<00:01:31.979> just<00:01:32.280> write<00:01:32.579> it<00:01:32.609> and<00:01:32.909> see<00:01:33.090> how<00:01:33.240> it

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
think I just write it and see how it

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.389 
think I just write it and see how it
feels

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:34.399 
feels

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:38.809 
feels
but<00:01:35.399> I'm<00:01:35.520> not<00:01:35.670> really<00:01:35.969> very<00:01:36.420> conscious<00:01:37.380> in<00:01:37.890> my

00:01:38.809 --> 00:01:38.819 
but I'm not really very conscious in my

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:42.139 
but I'm not really very conscious in my
writing<00:01:39.569> process<00:01:39.719> so<00:01:40.530> these<00:01:41.250> days<00:01:41.459> if<00:01:41.819> I

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:42.149 
writing process so these days if I

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:44.149 
writing process so these days if I
happened<00:01:43.020> to<00:01:43.109> write<00:01:43.380> something<00:01:43.590> that<00:01:43.799> sounded

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
happened to write something that sounded

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.999 
happened to write something that sounded
like<00:01:44.219> a<00:01:44.369> rock<00:01:44.759> song<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.270> me<00:01:45.360> I'd<00:01:45.509> probably<00:01:46.009> try

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
like a rock song to me I'd probably try

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.309 
like a rock song to me I'd probably try
and<00:01:47.129> do<00:01:47.310> it<00:01:47.459> with<00:01:47.610> a<00:01:47.640> new<00:01:47.819> prog<00:01:48.060> refers<00:01:48.450> because

00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:49.319 
and do it with a new prog refers because

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:51.380 
and do it with a new prog refers because
I'm<00:01:49.409> not<00:01:49.530> really<00:01:49.860> interested<00:01:50.819> in<00:01:50.909> doing<00:01:51.239> that

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
I'm not really interested in doing that

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.679 
I'm not really interested in doing that
with<00:01:51.679> destroyer
