00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.969
 Y 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:19.440
 the monterianos that we need are 

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:22.500
 coming I'm doing comedy commanded 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:27.570
 in black scissors 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:29.520
 a pencil ruler and cardboard of the color of 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.970
 your preference and also any 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.480
 material you want to decorate 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.480
 i 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:42.580
 The first thing we are going to do in your way 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:45.150
 is to draw a rectangle of 20 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.150
 centimeters 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.320
 20 centimeters by 10 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:03.160
 and once you have your rectangle 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.510
 of 20 per day 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.510
 we are going to cut it 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:16.880
 since you have your rectangle, we're going to 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:20.360
 put aside and now let's do 1 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:23.060
 but two centimeters wide 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.390
 for 10 long 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.390
 to 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.950
 2 x 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.060
 10 let's leave our foamy aside and 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:38.820
 let's take our cardboard 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:44.130
 and let's make a long life 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:47.100
 9 centimeters wide 9 centimeters 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.830
 wide as long as you want 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.190
 you can be two halves you can 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:55.000
 to serve 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:59.080
 and the fat ones and you have your strip 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.230
 cropped 9 centimeters wide you're going 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.880
 to make marks 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.880
 9 centimeters left 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.360
 up and down 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.110
 and about two points 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.510
 to form squares of 9 cm 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.600
 you will do it throughout all your 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:27.450
 life since you have your strips and checked if 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:30.200
 you have a bit left over, cut it out and 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:34.330
 now let's fold it by the lines 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:37.350
 doing a zig zag one back 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:40.569
 and one ahead 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:45.299
 can you help like a 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:45.299
 with your scissors to mark the folds 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:53.270
 and so on until you have like an accordion or 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:55.520
 like a worm 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:58.690
 well once you have to throw like this 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:05.310
 doubled I'll explain you well 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:08.000
 that are up front 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:11.680
 outward like that is from your right 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:15.800
 I did not go here 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:18.550
 and we are going to take our 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.550
 like me 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:24.510
 and let's put it 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.870
 so in half in a half of the 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.810
 fomin 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.970
 we are going to stick it with liquid silicone 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.420
 I forgot to tell you that we were going to occupy 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.420
 Liquid silicone 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.290
 or it can be the glue of your 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.860
 preference can also be silicone 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.860
 hot 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:48.420
 enough for it to stick well 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.420
 i 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.569
 we're 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.569
 never 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:03.830
 and we are going to paste our 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.830
 2 centimeters strips 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.590
 outside 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.260
 well about half the comic 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:24.759
 and we are going to close our album 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:30.780
 and today I am very distracted 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:33.570
 let's also occupy a bit a 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.520
 little piece of Velcro forgiveness 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:39.840
 this is the velcro or also what is 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:42.590
 call contact the one that sticks if in a 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:46.560
 side knows a hundred and the average deposits 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:50.510
 we are going to occupy only a bit that 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.510
 we are going to put it in this part 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.340
 and point 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:02.110
 with silicone 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:17.630
 and we also put silicon on top of the 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.630
 another velcro 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:28.270
 and we close like that and we 're going to let it dry 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:30.850
 well once you have dried you can 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:34.480
 decorate I put a flower like this 

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:37.169
 that the best and know how to do it 

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:40.390
 we opened 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:42.430
 and in to be our long strip 

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:44.050
 that you equal every space you can 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:46.210
 decorate 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:49.330
 and here in this part we can put 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:51.430
 when you take a photo of group is 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:54.879
 that everyone sits on their sidewalks or 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:57.250
 all stand are seated and the 

00:05:54.879 --> 00:06:02.580
 men are standing and the teacher in 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:07.770
 you can put it on your computer 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:09.900
 how we join 9 by 9 8 by 8 the glue and 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:12.289
 in each compartment of these in each 

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:12.289
 little box 

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:17.889
 because in front 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:20.699
 and from behind 

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:24.099
 you can write all your classmates 

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:25.389
 they can decorate the you 

00:06:24.099 --> 00:06:29.050
 they can be if they have many companions 

00:06:25.389 --> 00:06:30.789
 you can do 21 blue for those who 

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:34.210
 write pure men and 1 rose so that 

00:06:30.789 --> 00:06:35.770
 write you for women or you can also 

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:38.370
 be 3 to write all the 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:38.370
 teachers 

00:06:39.689 --> 00:06:44.550
 and so we have left 

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:49.259
 and you will have a good memory of your 

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:51.539
 companions in those times of school that 

00:06:49.259 --> 00:06:53.550
 I hope you liked it as well as 

00:06:51.539 --> 00:06:57.330
 my typical notebook but I got a 

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:59.250
 good idea without making it small 

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:03.080
 and you can be a lot more 

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:03.080
 long you can join two 

00:07:04.139 --> 00:07:08.099
 Well I hope you liked it if it's 

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:11.939
