00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
my crossbow then we boosted enough that

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:39.120 
my crossbow then we boosted enough that
it<00:02:36.390> it<00:02:37.390> does<00:02:37.569> a<00:02:37.599> fair<00:02:37.900> bit<00:02:38.140> of<00:02:38.200> base<00:02:38.440> damage<00:02:38.709> and

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
it it does a fair bit of base damage and

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.190 
it it does a fair bit of base damage and
then<00:02:39.640> my<00:02:39.910> crit<00:02:40.209> damage<00:02:40.390> is<00:02:40.690> going<00:02:40.870> to<00:02:40.930> help<00:02:41.080> me

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
then my crit damage is going to help me

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.009 
then my crit damage is going to help me
boost<00:02:41.410> those<00:02:41.980> big<00:02:42.780> attacks<00:02:43.780> with

boost those big attacks with

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:46.410 
boost those big attacks with
sharpshooter<00:02:44.580> so<00:02:45.580> I<00:02:45.640> can<00:02:45.819> think<00:02:45.970> Aspen<00:02:46.330> and

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
sharpshooter so I can think Aspen and

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.500 
sharpshooter so I can think Aspen and
down<00:02:46.890> with<00:02:47.890> the<00:02:47.920> crit<00:02:48.160> damage<00:02:48.310> like<00:02:49.180> I'm<00:02:49.330> gonna

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
down with the crit damage like I'm gonna

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.620 
down with the crit damage like I'm gonna
have<00:02:49.600> to<00:02:49.780> go<00:02:49.810> on<00:02:50.110> pretty<00:02:50.620> much<00:02:50.769> base<00:02:51.040> it<00:02:51.220> on

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
have to go on pretty much base it on

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.020 
have to go on pretty much base it on
crit<00:02:52.630> is<00:02:53.220> I<00:02:54.220> think<00:02:54.280> I<00:02:54.519> think<00:02:54.760> that's<00:02:54.880> the<00:02:54.970> only

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
crit is I think I think that's the only

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.490 
crit is I think I think that's the only
way<00:02:55.269> you<00:02:55.330> can<00:02:55.480> take<00:02:55.690> down<00:02:55.840> a<00:02:55.870> lot<00:02:56.080> of<00:02:56.170> these<00:02:56.260> big

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500
