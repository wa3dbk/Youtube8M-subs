 this story 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.709
 pitaco and it happens with msn 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:13.079
 I thought I knew the body better. 

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:16.349
 on this Tuesday behind Korean it seems that you want 

00:02:17.779 --> 00:02:23.019
 is the 4 5 and 5 5 is the Brazilian choir of this corpus callosum that reveals that 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:24.339
 Brazil 

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:26.079
 We'll put it here first. 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:28.219
 the dvd rick beauty 

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:31.059
 and to the telephone every person 

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:32.459
 ham 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.699
 remembering that we have here 

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:35.959
 The following is 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:37.619
 we have the same 

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:40.839
 You have a tip note that is there all day. 

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:43.139
 is 

00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:45.889
 the people 

00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:50.209
 we have 30 minutes a day Melina stays every day more than 30 minutes 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:55.149
 Exactly because in terms of 

00:02:55.149 --> 00:02:57.999
 is a good time considering that we will not have 

00:02:57.999 --> 00:03:00.530
 blackout in defeat can deny anywhere in the world 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:01.439
 but others 

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:04.189
 works the following way 

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:06.069
 you have it 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:09.269

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:10.409
 purity 

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:13.749
 is almost the regulation here of what is written and give 

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:16.169
 s 

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:19.169
 although 2010 passed from 2 thousand families are acre 

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:23.339
 Then you can call only ten minutes from here. 

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:26.579
 But there is something like that. 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:31.629

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:35.909

 beauty 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:48.809
 and portalegre again totaling 

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:51.409
 for her here 

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:54.409
