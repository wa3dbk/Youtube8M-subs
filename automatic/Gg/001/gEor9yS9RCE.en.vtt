for obvious evolutionary reasons so the

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.960 
for obvious evolutionary reasons so the
kids<00:02:27.620> that<00:02:27.950> I<00:02:27.980> had<00:02:28.130> photographed<00:02:28.340> growing<00:02:28.849> up

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
kids that I had photographed growing up

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.339 
kids that I had photographed growing up
quickly<00:02:29.209> the<00:02:29.660> woman<00:02:30.049> that<00:02:30.140> I<00:02:30.200> had

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:30.349 
quickly the woman that I had

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:32.710 
quickly the woman that I had
photographed<00:02:30.799> trying<00:02:31.099> to<00:02:31.220> stay<00:02:31.430> young<00:02:31.720> then

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
photographed trying to stay young then

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.110 
photographed trying to stay young then
that<00:02:33.470> all<00:02:33.680> made<00:02:33.889> sense<00:02:34.250> to<00:02:34.489> me<00:02:34.609> not<00:02:34.819> just

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
that all made sense to me not just

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.610 
that all made sense to me not just
because<00:02:35.540> of<00:02:35.569> the<00:02:35.900> pressures<00:02:36.319> of<00:02:36.500> our

because of the pressures of our

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.580 

well<00:02:43.850> in<00:02:44.150> my<00:02:44.300> aging<00:02:44.660> project<00:02:45.110> it's<00:02:45.260> actually

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
well in my aging project it's actually

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.670 
well in my aging project it's actually
men<00:02:45.800> too<00:02:46.040> but<00:02:46.400> that<00:02:47.030> work<00:02:47.600> is<00:02:47.840> not<00:02:48.020> in<00:02:48.230> the<00:02:48.410> show

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
men too but that work is not in the show

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.770 
men too but that work is not in the show
because<00:02:48.890> the<00:02:49.160> show<00:02:49.370> is<00:02:49.400> about<00:02:49.790> women<00:02:50.150> but<00:02:50.720> I

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
because the show is about women but I

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.750 
because the show is about women but I
think<00:02:51.140> that<00:02:51.410> there's<00:02:51.740> a<00:02:51.860> deeper<00:02:52.220> reason<00:02:52.370> for

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
think that there's a deeper reason for

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.640 
think that there's a deeper reason for
that<00:02:52.970> which<00:02:53.150> is<00:02:53.180> that<00:02:53.360> I'm<00:02:53.660> a<00:02:53.690> woman<00:02:54.170> and<00:02:54.200> my

that which is that I'm a woman and my

and<00:03:02.750> kind<00:03:03.140> of<00:03:04.150> raison<00:03:05.150> d'etre<00:03:05.600> for<00:03:05.690> a<00:03:05.840> lot<00:03:06.050> of

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
and kind of raison d'etre for a lot of

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.040 
and kind of raison d'etre for a lot of
the<00:03:06.290> things<00:03:06.530> that<00:03:06.680> I've<00:03:06.860> decided<00:03:07.190> to<00:03:07.610> document

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 
the things that I've decided to document

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.050 
the things that I've decided to document
so<00:03:09.050> I<00:03:09.410> started<00:03:09.860> with<00:03:10.010> growing<00:03:10.280> up<00:03:10.370> in<00:03:10.520> LA<00:03:10.790> and<00:03:10.970> I

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
so I started with growing up in LA and I

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.000 
so I started with growing up in LA and I
had<00:03:11.240> grown<00:03:11.390> up<00:03:11.450> in<00:03:11.690> LA<00:03:11.930> girl<00:03:12.320> culture<00:03:12.800> was<00:03:12.980> a

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
had grown up in LA girl culture was a

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.400 
had grown up in LA girl culture was a
way<00:03:13.250> for<00:03:13.280> me<00:03:13.550> to<00:03:13.760> contemplate<00:03:14.600> a<00:03:14.870> lot<00:03:15.200> of<00:03:15.320> the

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
way for me to contemplate a lot of the

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:16.750 
way for me to contemplate a lot of the
things<00:03:15.680> that<00:03:15.830> I<00:03:15.890> had<00:03:16.010> thought<00:03:16.220> about<00:03:16.520> growing

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
things that I had thought about growing

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.170 
things that I had thought about growing
up<00:03:17.090> and<00:03:17.450> also<00:03:17.810> as<00:03:18.110> a<00:03:18.170> woman<00:03:18.640> when<00:03:19.640> I<00:03:19.670> did<00:03:19.910> thin

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
up and also as a woman when I did thin

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:21.580 
up and also as a woman when I did thin
which<00:03:20.390> was<00:03:20.510> about<00:03:20.660> eating<00:03:20.960> disorders<00:03:21.380> I

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
which was about eating disorders I

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.800 
which was about eating disorders I
happen<00:03:22.010> to<00:03:22.040> work<00:03:22.280> in<00:03:22.520> a<00:03:22.550> clinic<00:03:23.000> that<00:03:23.030> was<00:03:23.330> only

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
happen to work in a clinic that was only

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.820 
happen to work in a clinic that was only
women<00:03:24.170> my<00:03:25.070> new<00:03:25.280> work<00:03:25.550> is<00:03:26.240> is<00:03:26.840> not<00:03:27.230> about<00:03:27.470> women

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:27.830 
women my new work is is not about women

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:31.360 
women my new work is is not about women
so<00:03:27.860> I'm<00:03:28.220> not<00:03:29.020> you<00:03:30.020> know<00:03:30.050> I'm<00:03:30.260> not<00:03:30.370> exclusively

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
so I'm not you know I'm not exclusively

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.790 
so I'm not you know I'm not exclusively
a<00:03:31.540> female<00:03:32.540> photographer<00:03:33.080> but<00:03:33.200> I<00:03:33.260> do<00:03:33.380> think

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:33.800 
a female photographer but I do think

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.040 
a female photographer but I do think
that<00:03:34.190> of<00:03:34.580> course<00:03:35.030> you<00:03:35.540> use<00:03:35.750> your<00:03:35.930> own

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.050 
that of course you use your own

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:38.200 
that of course you use your own
experience<00:03:36.770> and<00:03:37.130> that<00:03:37.340> helps<00:03:37.700> you<00:03:37.940> have

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:38.210 
experience and that helps you have

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:40.570 
experience and that helps you have
insight<00:03:38.840> into<00:03:39.140> the<00:03:39.710> documentation<00:03:40.280> you're

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:40.580 
insight into the documentation you're

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.060 
insight into the documentation you're
doing<00:03:40.970> and<00:03:41.210> I<00:03:41.630> have<00:03:41.780> more<00:03:41.990> experience<00:03:42.080> as<00:03:43.010> a

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:43.070 
doing and I have more experience as a

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:46.180 
doing and I have more experience as a
woman<00:03:43.520> that's<00:03:44.510> said<00:03:44.810> I<00:03:44.840> have<00:03:45.170> two<00:03:45.410> boys<00:03:45.620> and

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
woman that's said I have two boys and

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.030 
woman that's said I have two boys and
I'm<00:03:46.370> taking<00:03:46.820> that<00:03:46.850> process<00:03:47.720> in<00:03:47.959> and<00:03:48.380> you<00:03:48.980> know

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
I'm taking that process in and you know

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.830 
I'm taking that process in and you know
they<00:03:49.310> keep<00:03:49.760> asking<00:03:49.940> me<00:03:50.240> what<00:03:50.360> I'm<00:03:50.480> gonna<00:03:50.600> do

usually<00:04:13.740> say<00:04:13.920> balance<00:04:14.310> is<00:04:14.460> overrated<00:04:14.850> I<00:04:15.150> think

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
usually say balance is overrated I think

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.720 
usually say balance is overrated I think
that's<00:04:15.510> true<00:04:15.810> in<00:04:15.840> my<00:04:16.050> personal<00:04:16.500> life<00:04:16.650> too<00:04:16.950> but

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:17.730 
that's true in my personal life too but

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:22.370 
that's true in my personal life too but

independent<00:04:24.360> films<00:04:24.840> the<00:04:25.410> books<00:04:25.770> none<00:04:26.520> of

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.620 

I<00:05:19.200> don't<00:05:20.070> really<00:05:20.340> plan<00:05:20.700> them<00:05:21.030> but<00:05:21.270> they<00:05:21.420> are

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:21.630 
I don't really plan them but they are

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.350 
I don't really plan them but they are
very<00:05:21.960> far<00:05:22.200> ahead<00:05:22.350> in<00:05:22.770> the<00:05:22.860> sense<00:05:23.130> that<00:05:23.280> I<00:05:23.730> tend

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:28.200 
often I don't know I'm working on it

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.620 
often I don't know I'm working on it
until<00:05:28.320> I'm<00:05:28.620> years<00:05:28.890> into<00:05:29.220> it<00:05:29.370> so<00:05:30.150> for<00:05:30.480> girl

culture and even for beauty culture I go

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:37.010 
culture and even for beauty culture I go
back<00:05:33.810> years<00:05:34.470> and<00:05:34.800> and<00:05:35.280> look<00:05:35.790> at<00:05:35.970> work<00:05:36.390> and<00:05:36.780> then

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 
back years and and look at work and then

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:41.290 
back years and and look at work and then
it<00:05:37.350> starts<00:05:37.680> to<00:05:37.740> make<00:05:37.830> sense<00:05:38.160> to<00:05:38.400> me

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:41.300 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.300 

it<00:05:41.539> really<00:05:41.870> connected<00:05:42.379> the<00:05:42.500> dots<00:05:42.680> between<00:05:43.129> a

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:43.310 
it really connected the dots between a

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:44.800 
it really connected the dots between a
lot<00:05:43.520> of<00:05:43.639> things<00:05:43.849> that<00:05:44.000> I've<00:05:44.120> worked<00:05:44.240> on<00:05:44.419> before

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:44.810

work-in-progress
I<00:05:52.610> was<00:05:53.120> able<00:05:53.240> to<00:05:53.389> really<00:05:53.629> delve<00:05:53.960> into<00:05:54.229> and

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:54.770 
I was able to really delve into and

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:56.770 
I was able to really delve into and
bring<00:05:55.069> out<00:05:55.250> for<00:05:55.490> this<00:05:55.610> project<00:05:55.849> and<00:05:56.419> start<00:05:56.690> to

creating new work so I find that you
know<00:06:12.680> one<00:06:12.979> project<00:06:13.849> really<00:06:14.240> leads<00:06:14.780> to<00:06:15.050> another

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:15.289 
know one project really leads to another

you can do but I think the dangerous
thing<00:06:48.000> for<00:06:48.180> young<00:06:48.330> photographer<00:06:48.870> is<00:06:49.080> trying
