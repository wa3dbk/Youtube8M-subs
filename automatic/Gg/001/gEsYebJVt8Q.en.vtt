 many spectators came back to the Fair Live TV and the sequel to our 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.049
 Reporting from the Hannover Messe 2011 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.380
 Electromobility is not just one of the much discussed topics of 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.849
 Present but also one of the exhibition focuses on the 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:32.449
 Hannover Messe we have the trends in the field of electromobility for you 

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:35.820
 summarized 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.210
 shiny paint and hot to grab those cars that special 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.150
 you can not see them being environmentally friendly at first glance 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:48.060
 but the cars have the hustle and bustle of BMW has an emission-free 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:53.950
 Electric motor with a whopping 170 hp leaves the battery of the Mercedes BlueZERO 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:58.280
 crown Korbel electromagnetic refueling high tech for the 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.430
 Road traffic of morning 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.850
 the goal is clearly a lead market but also a lead provider for the troupe 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:05.489
 pained 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.160
 to become 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.440
 by the year 2020, at least one million electric cars and in addition 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.750
 more electric vehicles in Germany on the road too 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.180
 from October, the automakers want the first prototype 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.289
 to test their t-Mobile in city traffic 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:25.479
 important for the functioning of electromobility is an existing one 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:26.830
 infrastructure 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.800
 The car, for example, draw their electricity from epidemic dispensers 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.910
 simply connect the cable from the trunk to the socket and the 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.150
 Start charging 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.410
 Such a charging station can also be installed at home 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.150
 especially here for the home area he wants to have the solution created 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.730
 or SK run already in the ground he is looking at the government endangered 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.890
 In particular, what the subject of photography was Lotte Verbeek 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.420
 that the consumer does not build up from the man he has already integrated 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.020
 Numerous companies present their innovations for the sector 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.420
 Electromobility at this year's Hannover Messe 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.800
 In the future, the entire inner-city road traffic of 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.870
 Gasoline to be switched to electric motors believe experts 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:17.090
 Also a model for the future, this vehicle is half a car 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.309
 Aircraft traffic jams are now a thing of the past 

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:23.739
 yes she can use that as a writer as normal as she 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:27.929
 the previous Sarthe have used and also park kindergarten leader 

00:02:27.929 --> 00:02:32.369
 and since working on television with the Senator to make an airfield election 

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:35.369
 even the smallest airfield can start as a flop 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:40.379
 Of course, the carplane is also powered by an electric motor on the ground 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:42.139
 and accomplishes that 

00:02:42.139 --> 00:02:45.619
 up to 167 km / h 

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:49.529
 no wonder so if the electric mobility leads in such 

00:02:49.529 --> 00:02:52.529
 should take a rapid development 

00:02:54.399 --> 00:02:57.760
 and so much of the Halloren is he sets today 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.810
 You can find these and many more contributions to the Hannover Messe 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.599
