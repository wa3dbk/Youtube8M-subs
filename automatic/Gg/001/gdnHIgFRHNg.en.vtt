going through this phase where I'm

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:53.209 
going through this phase where I'm
really<00:00:51.539> getting<00:00:51.809> tired<00:00:52.079> of<00:00:52.410> making<00:00:52.800> videos

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
really getting tired of making videos

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.119 
really getting tired of making videos
altogether<00:00:53.879> you<00:00:54.239> know<00:00:54.270> it's<00:00:54.660> it's<00:00:54.870> like<00:00:55.140> my

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
altogether you know it's it's like my

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.119 
altogether you know it's it's like my
time<00:00:56.430> could<00:00:56.670> be<00:00:56.699> much<00:00:57.239> more<00:00:58.050> productive<00:00:58.379> if

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
time could be much more productive if

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.840 
time could be much more productive if
I'd<00:00:59.850> spent<00:01:00.300> it<00:01:00.469> doing<00:01:01.469> my<00:01:01.649> own<00:01:01.800> projects<00:01:02.520> and

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
I'd spent it doing my own projects and

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.719 
I'd spent it doing my own projects and
it<00:01:03.690> would<00:01:03.899> make<00:01:04.110> me<00:01:04.350> money<00:01:04.680> a<00:01:05.040> lot<00:01:05.489> of<00:01:05.549> money

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
it would make me money a lot of money

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.130 
it would make me money a lot of money
whereas<00:01:06.330> doing<00:01:06.720> these<00:01:06.900> videos<00:01:07.380> is

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
whereas doing these videos is

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.750 
whereas doing these videos is
counterproductive<00:01:10.140> to<00:01:10.680> my<00:01:10.890> personal<00:01:11.520> life

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
counterproductive to my personal life

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.149 
counterproductive to my personal life
that<00:01:11.790> takes<00:01:12.390> my<00:01:12.570> time<00:01:12.900> my<00:01:13.170> energy<00:01:13.350> it

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
that takes my time my energy it

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.340 
that takes my time my energy it
distracts<00:01:14.909> me<00:01:14.970> from<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.479> real<00:01:15.720> world<00:01:16.020> things

distracts me from the real world things
that<00:01:16.650> I'm<00:01:16.770> doing<00:01:18.770> and<00:01:19.770> it's<00:01:19.979> really

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
that I'm doing and it's really

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.960 
that I'm doing and it's really
disruptive<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.799> what<00:01:22.799> do<00:01:22.890> I<00:01:22.950> get<00:01:23.040> for<00:01:23.520> it<00:01:23.700> most
