the<00:01:54.360> draw<00:01:55.159> so<00:01:56.159> I've<00:01:56.250> opted<00:01:56.520> for<00:01:56.700> suppression

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
the draw so I've opted for suppression

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.870 
the draw so I've opted for suppression
field<00:01:57.329> in<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:58.530> main<00:01:58.799> deck<00:01:58.979> hate<00:01:59.189> card<00:01:59.460> slot<00:01:59.700> or

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
field in the main deck hate card slot or

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.209 
field in the main deck hate card slot or
the<00:02:00.060> main<00:02:00.180> deck<00:02:00.299> interactive<00:02:00.719> card<00:02:01.009> Harry<00:02:02.009> and

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
the main deck interactive card Harry and

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:09.729 
the main deck interactive card Harry and
Mark<00:02:02.460> had<00:02:02.820> path<00:02:03.630> to<00:02:03.840> exile<00:02:04.280> instead<00:02:05.280> I<00:02:07.489> think

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739 
Mark had path to exile instead I think

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:12.410 
Mark had path to exile instead I think
that<00:02:10.739> was<00:02:10.860> a<00:02:10.890> lot<00:02:11.129> to<00:02:11.280> do<00:02:11.370> with<00:02:11.400> zoo<00:02:11.879> being<00:02:12.180> part

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
that was a lot to do with zoo being part

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.530 
that was a lot to do with zoo being part
of<00:02:12.450> the<00:02:12.540> metagame

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
of the metagame

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.330 
of the metagame
instead<00:02:13.750> of<00:02:13.780> specifically<00:02:14.590> twin<00:02:14.860> and<00:02:15.010> pod<00:02:15.129> I

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
instead of specifically twin and pod I

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.830 
instead of specifically twin and pod I
think<00:02:15.549> fields<00:02:15.939> a<00:02:16.000> little<00:02:16.390> better<00:02:16.569> against

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
think fields a little better against

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.199 
think fields a little better against
those<00:02:16.959> two<00:02:17.140> decks<00:02:17.349> than<00:02:17.530> path<00:02:17.799> is<00:02:18.060> it's<00:02:19.060> worth

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
those two decks than path is it's worth

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:20.910 
those two decks than path is it's worth
noting<00:02:19.390> that<00:02:19.569> path<00:02:19.930> is<00:02:20.109> better<00:02:20.319> than<00:02:20.500> gelid

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
noting that path is better than gelid

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.679 
noting that path is better than gelid

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.060 
over with it there's actually a lot more
play<00:05:20.150> this<00:05:20.330> deck<00:05:20.570> and<00:05:20.780> again<00:05:21.530> I'll<00:05:21.680> cite<00:05:21.890> the

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:22.070 
play this deck and again I'll cite the

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:24.100 
play this deck and again I'll cite the
most<00:05:22.250> ridiculous<00:05:22.790> thing<00:05:23.000> which<00:05:23.240> is<00:05:23.450> rest<00:05:23.990> in

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
most ridiculous thing which is rest in

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.290 
most ridiculous thing which is rest in
peace<00:05:24.260> is<00:05:24.410> not<00:05:24.560> good<00:05:24.740> against<00:05:24.950> living<00:05:25.220> end<00:05:25.370> and

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:26.300 
peace is not good against living end and

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.270 
peace is not good against living end and
the<00:05:26.420> reason<00:05:26.720> for<00:05:26.750> that<00:05:26.870> is<00:05:27.200> you<00:05:27.500> are<00:05:28.040> actually

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:28.280 
the reason for that is you are actually

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:30.130 
the reason for that is you are actually
trying<00:05:28.790> to<00:05:28.970> set<00:05:29.270> up<00:05:29.360> a<00:05:29.480> situation<00:05:29.660> where<00:05:30.050> they

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:30.140 
trying to set up a situation where they

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:31.420 
trying to set up a situation where they
have<00:05:30.230> to<00:05:30.350> constantly<00:05:30.650> end<00:05:30.980> back<00:05:31.190> in<00:05:31.340> the

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.430 
have to constantly end back in the

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.400 
have to constantly end back in the
spirit<00:05:31.610> dancer<00:05:32.000> and<00:05:32.180> eventually<00:05:33.080> they<00:05:33.200> just

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:33.410 
spirit dancer and eventually they just

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:35.290 
spirit dancer and eventually they just
lose<00:05:33.530> to<00:05:33.710> that<00:05:33.740> so<00:05:34.640> I<00:05:34.670> think<00:05:34.880> it's<00:05:35.090> worth

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:35.300 
lose to that so I think it's worth

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:36.700 
lose to that so I think it's worth
noting<00:05:35.570> there's<00:05:35.900> a<00:05:35.960> lot<00:05:36.110> of<00:05:36.140> very<00:05:36.440> weird

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:36.710 
noting there's a lot of very weird

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:38.170 
noting there's a lot of very weird
interactions<00:05:37.220> because<00:05:37.340> of<00:05:37.610> the<00:05:37.670> deck<00:05:37.820> and<00:05:38.060> the

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:38.180 
interactions because of the deck and the

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:42.400 
interactions because of the deck and the
way<00:05:38.270> it<00:05:38.390> works<00:05:38.600> and<00:05:40.780> it's<00:05:41.780> not<00:05:41.960> just<00:05:42.020> the<00:05:42.260> kind

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:42.410 
way it works and it's not just the kind

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:43.630 
way it works and it's not just the kind
of<00:05:42.440> thing<00:05:42.590> you<00:05:42.620> straight<00:05:42.860> up<00:05:42.890> pick<00:05:43.130> up<00:05:43.250> out<00:05:43.580> of

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:43.640 
of thing you straight up pick up out of

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.880 
of thing you straight up pick up out of
nowhere<00:05:43.880> so<00:05:44.750> that's<00:05:45.380> why<00:05:45.500> I'm<00:05:45.590> playing<00:05:45.770> it

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:45.890 
nowhere so that's why I'm playing it

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:48.100 
nowhere so that's why I'm playing it
today
