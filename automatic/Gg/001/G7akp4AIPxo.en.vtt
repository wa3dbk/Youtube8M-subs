him to be honest with you you know we

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.919 
him to be honest with you you know we
had<00:00:44.609> some<00:00:44.789> of<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:44.969> greatest<00:00:45.059> point<00:00:45.510> guards<00:00:45.840> in

00:00:45.919 --> 00:00:45.929 
had some of the greatest point guards in

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:47.330 
had some of the greatest point guards in
the<00:00:46.050> game<00:00:46.230> and<00:00:46.500> I<00:00:46.559> think<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:46.920> team<00:00:47.129> was

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
the game and I think the team was

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.939 
the game and I think the team was
assembly<00:00:47.910> based<00:00:48.420> on<00:00:48.690> you<00:00:49.350> know<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.679> players

00:00:49.939 --> 00:00:49.949 
assembly based on you know the players

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:51.590 
assembly based on you know the players
that<00:00:50.250> we<00:00:50.339> could<00:00:50.519> get<00:00:50.640> in<00:00:50.789> certain<00:00:51.059> positions

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
that we could get in certain positions

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.479 
that we could get in certain positions
and<00:00:51.839> I<00:00:51.960> think<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.530> position<00:00:52.949> that<00:00:53.039> he<00:00:53.219> played

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
and I think the position that he played

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.150 
and I think the position that he played
in<00:00:53.760> was<00:00:54.000> it<00:00:54.929> was<00:00:55.079> taken<00:00:55.469> it<00:00:55.589> was<00:00:55.620> just<00:00:55.949> no

in was it was taken it was just no

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.910 
in was it was taken it was just no
playing<00:00:57.120> space<00:00:57.660> there<00:00:57.960> for<00:00:58.230> him<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.499> you<00:00:58.769> know

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
playing space there for him and you know

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.009 
playing space there for him and you know

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:03.510 
best point guards to ever play the game

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.780 
best point guards to ever play the game
and<00:02:03.900> so<00:02:04.350> he<00:02:04.560> deserved<00:02:05.010> to<00:02:05.160> be<00:02:05.220> on<00:02:05.430> that<00:02:05.580> team

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
and so he deserved to be on that team

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.330 
and so he deserved to be on that team
especially<00:02:06.450> with<00:02:06.930> his<00:02:07.110> head<00:02:07.290> coach<00:02:07.560> as<00:02:07.800> our

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
especially with his head coach as our

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.850 
especially with his head coach as our
head<00:02:08.550> coach<00:02:08.759> Chuck<00:02:09.119> Daly<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:09.660> so<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.500> reason

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
head coach Chuck Daly and so the reason

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.890 
head coach Chuck Daly and so the reason
he<00:02:10.979> was<00:02:11.129> not<00:02:11.340> was<00:02:11.610> because<00:02:12.060> we'd<00:02:12.600> be<00:02:12.750> together

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
he was not was because we'd be together

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.050 
he was not was because we'd be together
for<00:02:13.290> long<00:02:13.440> stretches<00:02:13.650> of<00:02:13.890> time<00:02:14.040> and<00:02:14.550> he<00:02:14.850> had

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
for long stretches of time and he had

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.550 
for long stretches of time and he had
get<00:02:15.239> along<00:02:15.420> with<00:02:15.599> your<00:02:15.750> teammates<00:02:16.110> but<00:02:16.349> in

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
get along with your teammates but in

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.010 
get along with your teammates but in
terms<00:02:17.010> of<00:02:17.190> his<00:02:17.310> talent<00:02:17.700> I<00:02:17.819> think<00:02:18.750> you<00:02:18.840> should

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
terms of his talent I think you should

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.630 
terms of his talent I think you should
have<00:02:19.110> been<00:02:19.200> on<00:02:19.319> that<00:02:19.349> team<00:02:19.590> right<00:02:19.890> but<00:02:20.430> it<00:02:20.520> was

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
have been on that team right but it was

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.190 
have been on that team right but it was
a<00:02:20.730> camaraderie<00:02:20.940> issue<00:02:21.390> because<00:02:21.780> the<00:02:21.900> truth<00:02:22.080> is

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
a camaraderie issue because the truth is

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.470 
a camaraderie issue because the truth is
you<00:02:22.260> didn't<00:02:22.620> need<00:02:22.739> him<00:02:22.860> to<00:02:23.010> win<00:02:23.220> so<00:02:24.030> at<00:02:24.330> that

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
you didn't need him to win so at that

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.720 
you didn't need him to win so at that
point<00:02:24.750> it<00:02:24.900> became<00:02:25.110> a<00:02:25.170> chemistry<00:02:25.709> issue<00:02:25.920> let's
