this level isn't that difficult the
second<00:01:54.960> half<00:01:55.110> is<00:01:55.410> though<00:01:56.570> in<00:01:57.570> a<00:01:57.750> minute<00:01:58.020> here

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:58.230

I'm<00:01:58.500> gonna<00:01:58.680> jump<00:01:58.980> on<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.510> on<00:02:00.510> the<00:02:00.980> turret<00:02:01.980> of<00:02:02.250> a

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
I'm gonna jump on the on the turret of a

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.680

of<00:02:03.570> a<00:02:03.690> downed<00:02:03.900> helicopter<00:02:04.110> and<00:02:04.860> I<00:02:05.580> use<00:02:05.760> that<00:02:06.030> to

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
of a downed helicopter and I use that to

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.090 
of a downed helicopter and I use that to
take<00:02:06.900> out<00:02:07.080> a<00:02:07.110> couple<00:02:07.380> more<00:02:07.560> helicopters<00:02:07.800> that

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100
