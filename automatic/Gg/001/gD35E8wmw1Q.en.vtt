and honestly i come pretty much

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.600 
and honestly i come pretty much
completely<00:01:13.960> randomly<00:01:14.409> picked<00:01:14.740> them<00:01:14.890> the<00:01:15.430> only

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
completely randomly picked them the only

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.459 
completely randomly picked them the only
perk<00:01:15.820> I<00:01:15.969> really<00:01:16.539> picked<00:01:16.780> because<00:01:16.960> I<00:01:17.079> needed<00:01:17.289> to

00:01:17.459 --> 00:01:17.469 
perk I really picked because I needed to

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:19.260 
perk I really picked because I needed to
was<00:01:17.649> warlord<00:01:18.100> to<00:01:18.280> have<00:01:18.399> the<00:01:18.520> two<00:01:18.670> attachments

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
was warlord to have the two attachments

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.929 
was warlord to have the two attachments
and<00:01:19.360> this<00:01:20.200> is<00:01:20.320> just<00:01:20.530> so<00:01:20.770> random<00:01:21.100> of<00:01:21.490> a<00:01:21.579> setup

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:21.939 
and this is just so random of a setup

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:23.609 
and this is just so random of a setup
and<00:01:22.119> I<00:01:22.899> just<00:01:23.049> thought<00:01:23.200> it'd<00:01:23.350> be<00:01:23.380> kind<00:01:23.590> of

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:23.619 
and I just thought it'd be kind of

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:25.679 
and I just thought it'd be kind of
interesting<00:01:23.890> to<00:01:24.219> see<00:01:24.399> if<00:01:24.939> I<00:01:25.090> could<00:01:25.149> get<00:01:25.390> a<00:01:25.450> good

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:25.689 
interesting to see if I could get a good

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:27.240 
interesting to see if I could get a good
game<00:01:25.960> with<00:01:26.170> a<00:01:26.200> setup<00:01:26.530> like<00:01:26.590> this<00:01:26.710> and<00:01:27.039> it<00:01:27.130> took

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
game with a setup like this and it took

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.160 
game with a setup like this and it took
me<00:01:27.280> a<00:01:27.460> while<00:01:27.579> I'm<00:01:27.789> not<00:01:27.909> gonna<00:01:28.030> lie<00:01:28.270> the<00:01:28.329> it's

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
me a while I'm not gonna lie the it's

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.800 
me a while I'm not gonna lie the it's
the<00:01:29.710> m14<00:01:30.490> when<00:01:30.700> you<00:01:30.759> strap<00:01:31.030> on<00:01:31.210> the<00:01:31.299> silencer

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
the m14 when you strap on the silencer

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.469 
the m14 when you strap on the silencer
is<00:01:32.020> extremely<00:01:32.859> inaccurate<00:01:33.070> from<00:01:33.609> range<00:01:33.850> but<00:01:34.210> I

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 
is extremely inaccurate from range but I

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:36.660 
is extremely inaccurate from range but I
never<00:01:35.259> actually<00:01:35.380> have<00:01:35.829> used<00:01:36.039> a<00:01:36.159> weapon<00:01:36.280> with

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
never actually have used a weapon with

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.910 
never actually have used a weapon with
the<00:01:36.939> thermal<00:01:37.420> scope<00:01:37.689> on<00:01:37.960> it<00:01:37.990> or<00:01:38.350> what's<00:01:38.799> it

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
the thermal scope on it or what's it

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.260 
the thermal scope on it or what's it
called<00:01:39.070> its<00:01:39.250> called<00:01:39.280> infrared<00:01:39.850> in<00:01:39.939> this<00:01:40.060> game

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
called its called infrared in this game

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:41.700 
called its called infrared in this game
i<00:01:40.299> think<00:01:40.509> in<00:01:40.570> modern<00:01:40.840> warfare<00:01:40.869> 2<00:01:41.320> is<00:01:41.500> called

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
i think in modern warfare 2 is called

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.429 
i think in modern warfare 2 is called
the<00:01:41.799> thermal<00:01:42.189> though<00:01:42.340> but<00:01:43.240> if<00:01:43.990> you're<00:01:44.259> trying

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:44.439 
the thermal though but if you're trying

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:45.870 
the thermal though but if you're trying
to<00:01:44.530> get<00:01:44.679> a<00:01:44.710> good<00:01:44.859> gameplay<00:01:45.280> this<00:01:45.429> is<00:01:45.549> honestly

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
to get a good gameplay this is honestly

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.550 
to get a good gameplay this is honestly
one<00:01:46.060> of<00:01:46.210> the<00:01:46.299> worst<00:01:46.539> setups<00:01:47.140> you<00:01:47.259> can<00:01:47.409> possibly

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
one of the worst setups you can possibly

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.190 
one of the worst setups you can possibly
use<00:01:47.859> but<00:01:48.429> i<00:01:48.640> think<00:01:49.329> it<00:01:49.390> could<00:01:49.570> be<00:01:49.780> pretty

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
use but i think it could be pretty

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.289 
use but i think it could be pretty
interesting<00:01:50.770> to<00:01:50.950> you<00:01:51.070> guys<00:01:51.250> and<00:01:51.579> that's<00:01:52.119> why<00:01:52.240> i

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:52.299 
interesting to you guys and that's why i

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:55.410 
interesting to you guys and that's why i
decided<00:01:52.719> to<00:01:52.960> use<00:01:52.990> it<00:01:53.320> but<00:01:54.130> on<00:01:54.310> my<00:01:54.939> perks<00:01:55.210> i'm

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
decided to use it but on my perks i'm

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.239 
decided to use it but on my perks i'm
using<00:01:55.689> flak<00:01:55.929> jacket<00:01:56.469> i<00:01:56.679> think<00:01:56.979> that<00:01:57.130> might

00:01:57.239 --> 00:01:57.249 
using flak jacket i think that might

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:58.620 
using flak jacket i think that might
actually<00:01:57.399> save<00:01:57.759> me<00:01:57.909> a<00:01:57.969> couple<00:01:58.119> times<00:01:58.240> because

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
actually save me a couple times because

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.260 
actually save me a couple times because
a<00:01:59.159> not<00:02:00.159> in<00:02:00.280> this<00:02:00.369> game<00:02:00.609> but<00:02:00.789> in<00:02:00.909> like<00:02:01.090> other

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
a not in this game but in like other

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:02.940 
a not in this game but in like other
games<00:02:01.509> and<00:02:01.749> I<00:02:01.780> strapped<00:02:02.200> it<00:02:02.320> on<00:02:02.409> because<00:02:02.649> the

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
games and I strapped it on because the

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.069 
games and I strapped it on because the
RCX<00:02:03.399> DS<00:02:03.579> actually<00:02:03.999> can't<00:02:04.299> kill<00:02:04.600> you<00:02:04.810> unless

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:05.079 
RCX DS actually can't kill you unless

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:07.200 
RCX DS actually can't kill you unless
they<00:02:05.380> actually<00:02:05.829> hit<00:02:06.100> you<00:02:06.280> if<00:02:06.520> they<00:02:06.700> blow<00:02:07.179> up

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
they actually hit you if they blow up

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.419 
they actually hit you if they blow up
right<00:02:07.569> next<00:02:07.749> to<00:02:07.960> your<00:02:08.200> fine<00:02:08.440> so<00:02:09.190> it's<00:02:09.310> actually

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
right next to your fine so it's actually

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.270 
right next to your fine so it's actually
a<00:02:09.670> pretty<00:02:09.910> useful<00:02:10.390> perk<00:02:10.869> even<00:02:11.290> though<00:02:11.440> it's

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
a pretty useful perk even though it's

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.220 
a pretty useful perk even though it's
like<00:02:12.490> not<00:02:12.819> one<00:02:12.970> I<00:02:13.000> recommend<00:02:13.240> because<00:02:13.840> I<00:02:13.870> mean

it's<00:04:53.650> like<00:04:53.889> you're<00:04:54.100> flying<00:04:54.340> straight<00:04:54.850> like

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
it's like you're flying straight like

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.310 
it's like you're flying straight like
all<00:04:55.210> you<00:04:55.300> have<00:04:55.389> to<00:04:55.449> control<00:04:55.720> the<00:04:55.900> missile<00:04:56.229> I

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 
all you have to control the missile I

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.950 
all you have to control the missile I
don't<00:04:56.500> know<00:04:56.560> just<00:04:56.740> I<00:04:57.010> had<00:04:58.000> a<00:04:58.060> tough<00:04:58.479> time<00:04:58.510> with

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
don't know just I had a tough time with

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.659 
don't know just I had a tough time with
yeah<00:04:59.080> I<00:04:59.139> think<00:04:59.440> I<00:04:59.590> maybe<00:04:59.740> get<00:04:59.949> one<00:05:00.130> kill<00:05:00.460> out<00:05:00.639> of

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:00.669 
yeah I think I maybe get one kill out of

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:03.870 
yeah I think I maybe get one kill out of
it<00:05:00.880> but<00:05:01.590> and<00:05:02.590> this<00:05:02.740> definitely<00:05:03.100> is<00:05:03.460> fun<00:05:03.729> to

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.880 
it but and this definitely is fun to

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.100 
it but and this definitely is fun to
explore<00:05:04.210> the<00:05:04.360> different<00:05:04.660> killstreaks

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 
explore the different killstreaks

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:06.330 
explore the different killstreaks
because<00:05:05.380> I'm<00:05:05.500> really<00:05:05.710> not<00:05:05.800> used<00:05:06.010> to<00:05:06.190> using

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
because I'm really not used to using

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.779 
because I'm really not used to using
much<00:05:07.240> else<00:05:07.479> other<00:05:07.720> than<00:05:08.080> like<00:05:09.010> the<00:05:09.190> spy<00:05:09.400> point

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:09.789 
much else other than like the spy point

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:13.050 
much else other than like the spy point
when<00:05:10.060> the<00:05:10.710> napalm<00:05:11.710> strike<00:05:12.070> the<00:05:12.610> chopper

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060 
when the napalm strike the chopper

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.080 
when the napalm strike the chopper
gunner<00:05:13.330> black<00:05:13.810> bird<00:05:14.520> dogs<00:05:15.520> those<00:05:15.970> are

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:28.120 
I kind of run into the ground so I think

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.089 
I kind of run into the ground so I think
this<00:05:28.300> game<00:05:28.510> is<00:05:28.570> just<00:05:29.200> about<00:05:29.440> over<00:05:29.500> now<00:05:29.800> I<00:05:29.919> think
