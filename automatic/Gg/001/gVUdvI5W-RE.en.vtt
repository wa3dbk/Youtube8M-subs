 steering wheel 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.980
 once it's usada 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.980
 I'm behind the wheel 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.550
 I'm not on the Molenstraat 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.250
 the total export was sent away 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.280
 not for the council 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.280
 a lack of supervision 

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:14.599
 before the second world war 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:16.249

 Haaksbergen week is controlled 

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:33.199
 the steering wheel argues for this 

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:48.199
 for getting back 

00:02:49.249 --> 00:02:52.649

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:39.169
 then from the site 

00:03:42.499 --> 00:03:45.499
