00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
way the colors look on it and it was

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.289 
way the colors look on it and it was
kind<00:01:43.110> of<00:01:43.259> a<00:01:43.350> weird<00:01:43.590> thing<00:01:43.680> but<00:01:44.159> personally<00:01:45.090> I

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
kind of a weird thing but personally I

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.539 
kind of a weird thing but personally I
like<00:01:45.990> having<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.500> colorful<00:01:46.950> zone<00:01:47.100> map<00:01:47.369> even

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
like having a colorful zone map even

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.639 
like having a colorful zone map even
ascension<00:01:48.240> ascension<00:01:49.020> was<00:01:49.170> like<00:01:49.259> a<00:01:49.380> fan

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
ascension ascension was like a fan

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.440 
ascension ascension was like a fan

me<00:01:52.340> not<00:01:53.340> so<00:01:53.729> much<00:01:53.759> I<00:01:54.240> don't<00:01:54.299> hate<00:01:55.170> it<00:01:55.200> as<00:01:55.470> much

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
me not so much I don't hate it as much

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.459 
me not so much I don't hate it as much
as<00:01:56.009> I<00:01:56.280> do<00:01:56.340> this<00:01:56.820> map<00:01:57.090> but<00:01:57.509> I<00:01:57.570> didn't<00:01:58.140> like<00:01:58.290> that

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
as I do this map but I didn't like that

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.520 
as I do this map but I didn't like that
map<00:01:58.680> very<00:01:58.920> much<00:01:59.159> just<00:01:59.909> because<00:02:00.149> of<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:01.140> colors

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
map very much just because of the colors

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.160 
map very much just because of the colors
I<00:02:01.649> thought<00:02:01.799> to<00:02:01.979> be<00:02:02.070> so<00:02:02.280> dark<00:02:02.670> and<00:02:03.030> great<00:02:03.899> to

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
I thought to be so dark and great to

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.530 
I thought to be so dark and great to
look<00:02:04.320> at<00:02:04.560> I<00:02:04.590> just<00:02:04.829> didn't<00:02:05.280> like<00:02:05.460> it<00:02:05.670> I<00:02:05.790> got<00:02:05.969> just

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
look at I just didn't like it I got just

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.800 
look at I just didn't like it I got just
looking<00:02:06.899> at<00:02:07.020> it<00:02:07.140> is<00:02:07.290> very<00:02:07.320> boring<00:02:07.940> now<00:02:08.940> another

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
looking at it is very boring now another

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.309 
looking at it is very boring now another
reason<00:02:10.080> that<00:02:10.440> I<00:02:11.250> don't<00:02:11.520> like<00:02:11.640> this<00:02:11.760> map<00:02:12.000> is

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
reason that I don't like this map is

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:17.320 
reason that I don't like this map is
it's<00:02:13.319> very<00:02:13.950> very<00:02:14.700> close<00:02:15.150> quarters<00:02:15.690> and<00:02:16.170> that

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
it's very very close quarters and that

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.350 
it's very very close quarters and that
makes<00:02:18.330> it<00:02:18.569> very<00:02:18.780> hard<00:02:19.170> to<00:02:20.129> play<00:02:20.340> on<00:02:20.580> now<00:02:20.790> your

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
makes it very hard to play on now your

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.850 
makes it very hard to play on now your
look<00:02:21.750> just<00:02:21.930> look<00:02:22.050> at<00:02:22.200> this<00:02:22.290> area<00:02:22.530> right<00:02:22.800> here

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
look just look at this area right here

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.589 
look just look at this area right here
where<00:02:23.160> the<00:02:23.280> Smith<00:02:23.489> plays<00:02:23.760> is<00:02:23.940> training<00:02:24.420> it's

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 
where the Smith plays is training it's

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:26.839 
where the Smith plays is training it's
it's<00:02:24.810> very<00:02:24.959> very<00:02:25.290> close<00:02:25.770> quarters<00:02:26.160> I<00:02:26.580> don't

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
it's very very close quarters I don't

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:28.970 
it's very very close quarters I don't
really<00:02:27.030> ever<00:02:27.120> remember<00:02:27.840> playing<00:02:28.500> a<00:02:28.650> zombie

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
really ever remember playing a zombie

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.460 
really ever remember playing a zombie
map<00:02:29.160> other<00:02:29.550> than<00:02:29.970> shangri-la<00:02:30.569> where<00:02:31.260> it's

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
map other than shangri-la where it's

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.670 
map other than shangri-la where it's
this<00:02:31.800> close<00:02:32.220> quarters<00:02:32.760> and<00:02:32.940> maybe<00:02:33.540> I<00:02:33.930> haven't

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
this close quarters and maybe I haven't

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.589 
this close quarters and maybe I haven't
given<00:02:34.890> the<00:02:35.160> map<00:02:35.340> enough<00:02:35.670> time<00:02:35.970> I<00:02:36.000> honestly

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
given the map enough time I honestly

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:38.600 
given the map enough time I honestly
really<00:02:37.019> did<00:02:37.319> not<00:02:37.500> play<00:02:37.709> this<00:02:37.830> map<00:02:38.040> much<00:02:38.310> just

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
really did not play this map much just

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:39.920 
really did not play this map much just
because<00:02:38.760> I<00:02:38.940> didn't<00:02:39.180> like<00:02:39.330> it<00:02:39.510> that<00:02:39.660> much

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
because I didn't like it that much

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.100 
because I didn't like it that much
um<00:02:40.709> but<00:02:41.430> the<00:02:41.610> map<00:02:41.790> is<00:02:42.000> closed<00:02:42.209> waters<00:02:42.510> I<00:02:42.810> find

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
um but the map is closed waters I find

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.320 
um but the map is closed waters I find
it<00:02:43.200> to<00:02:43.260> be<00:02:43.290> very<00:02:43.769> very<00:02:43.980> difficult<00:02:44.280> I<00:02:44.790> find<00:02:44.970> it

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
it to be very very difficult I find it

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.140 
it to be very very difficult I find it
be<00:02:45.420> very<00:02:45.629> solo<00:02:46.050> friendly<00:02:46.560> though<00:02:46.709> because

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
be very solo friendly though because

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.400 
be very solo friendly though because
when<00:02:48.150> you're<00:02:48.269> playing<00:02:48.450> on<00:02:48.569> co-op<00:02:48.989> it's<00:02:49.200> kind

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
when you're playing on co-op it's kind

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.250 
when you're playing on co-op it's kind
of<00:02:49.470> tough<00:02:49.739> to<00:02:50.340> get<00:02:51.180> to<00:02:51.300> a<00:02:51.330> high<00:02:51.569> round<00:02:51.840> with<00:02:51.959> 4

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
of tough to get to a high round with 4

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.670 
of tough to get to a high round with 4
players

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
players

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.170 
players
unless<00:02:53.430> you're<00:02:53.610> kind<00:02:53.790> of<00:02:53.849> running<00:02:54.090> the

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
unless you're kind of running the

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
pack-a-punch area and that leads me into

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.330 
pack-a-punch area and that leads me into
my<00:02:56.910> third<00:02:57.510> reason<00:02:57.750> why<00:02:58.050> I<00:02:58.110> do<00:02:58.290> not<00:02:58.650> like<00:02:58.950> the

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
my third reason why I do not like the

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.199 
my third reason why I do not like the
this<00:02:59.819> map<00:03:00.090> is<00:03:00.360> the<00:03:01.140> pack<00:03:01.409> punch<00:03:01.920> area<00:03:02.250> I<00:03:02.459> find

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
this map is the pack punch area I find

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.509 
this map is the pack punch area I find
it<00:03:03.360> to<00:03:03.450> be<00:03:03.480> kind<00:03:03.989> of<00:03:04.110> a<00:03:04.200> hassle<00:03:04.440> to<00:03:04.980> pack<00:03:05.489> a

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
it to be kind of a hassle to pack a

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.820 
it to be kind of a hassle to pack a
punch<00:03:05.909> having<00:03:06.659> to<00:03:06.810> assemble<00:03:07.290> all<00:03:07.409> the<00:03:07.530> parts

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
punch having to assemble all the parts

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.890 
punch having to assemble all the parts
of<00:03:07.920> the<00:03:08.010> plane<00:03:08.250> and<00:03:08.550> then<00:03:08.970> afterwards<00:03:09.659> if<00:03:09.840> you

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
of the plane and then afterwards if you

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.540 
of the plane and then afterwards if you
want<00:03:09.989> to<00:03:10.230> go<00:03:10.319> again<00:03:10.590> you<00:03:10.769> have<00:03:10.860> to<00:03:10.950> go<00:03:11.040> all<00:03:11.280> the

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
want to go again you have to go all the

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.960 
want to go again you have to go all the
way<00:03:11.580> back<00:03:11.940> to<00:03:12.180> all<00:03:12.209> those<00:03:12.480> spots<00:03:12.720> and<00:03:13.080> get<00:03:13.590> the

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
way back to all those spots and get the

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.820 
way back to all those spots and get the
canisters<00:03:14.970> I<00:03:15.150> kind<00:03:15.330> of<00:03:15.390> find<00:03:15.659> it<00:03:15.720> annoying<00:03:16.290> and

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
canisters I kind of find it annoying and

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.009 
canisters I kind of find it annoying and
just<00:03:17.430> a<00:03:17.519> hassle<00:03:17.760> going<00:03:18.330> to<00:03:18.420> the<00:03:18.540> pack<00:03:18.690> of<00:03:18.870> munch

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
just a hassle going to the pack of munch

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:23.199 
just a hassle going to the pack of munch
area<00:03:19.879> also<00:03:20.879> I<00:03:21.180> do<00:03:21.599> not<00:03:21.840> like<00:03:22.560> Brutus

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
area also I do not like Brutus

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:26.240 
area also I do not like Brutus
especially<00:03:24.209> because<00:03:25.019> this<00:03:25.349> map<00:03:25.590> is<00:03:25.799> so<00:03:25.830> close

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
especially because this map is so close

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.240 
especially because this map is so close
quarters<00:03:26.760> when<00:03:27.269> Brutus<00:03:27.690> spawns<00:03:28.019> in<00:03:28.319> you<00:03:29.040> got

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
quarters when Brutus spawns in you got

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:30.920 
quarters when Brutus spawns in you got
to<00:03:29.370> go<00:03:29.489> one<00:03:29.730> way<00:03:29.760> you<00:03:30.030> can't<00:03:30.390> turn<00:03:30.599> around<00:03:30.659> and

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
to go one way you can't turn around and

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.750 
to go one way you can't turn around and
go<00:03:31.080> the<00:03:31.230> same<00:03:31.260> way<00:03:31.500> Brutus<00:03:32.040> is<00:03:32.159> coming<00:03:32.430> at<00:03:32.549> you

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
go the same way Brutus is coming at you

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.110 
go the same way Brutus is coming at you
or<00:03:32.970> you're<00:03:33.450> pretty<00:03:33.750> much<00:03:33.989> screwed<00:03:34.349> and<00:03:35.120> when

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
or you're pretty much screwed and when

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.720 
or you're pretty much screwed and when
he<00:03:36.269> walks<00:03:36.540> and<00:03:37.019> the<00:03:37.230> footstep<00:03:37.769> shakes<00:03:38.519> your

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
he walks and the footstep shakes your

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.960 
he walks and the footstep shakes your
screen<00:03:39.090> I<00:03:39.530> just<00:03:40.530> I<00:03:40.890> just<00:03:40.920> don't<00:03:41.159> like<00:03:41.670> it<00:03:41.879> I

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
screen I just I just don't like it I

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.910 
screen I just I just don't like it I
really<00:03:42.420> really<00:03:42.629> don't<00:03:42.810> like<00:03:42.959> it<00:03:43.290> another

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
really really don't like it another

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.559 
really really don't like it another
reason<00:03:44.370> why<00:03:44.489> I<00:03:44.580> don't<00:03:44.790> like<00:03:44.940> this<00:03:45.060> map<00:03:45.299> is

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:45.569 
reason why I don't like this map is

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:48.589 
reason why I don't like this map is
after<00:03:46.440> life<00:03:46.739> a<00:03:47.010> perfect<00:03:47.549> timing<00:03:47.879> huh<00:03:48.120> after

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:48.599 
after life a perfect timing huh after

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:51.680 
after life a perfect timing huh after
life<00:03:49.049> I<00:03:49.349> don't<00:03:50.010> like<00:03:50.430> it<00:03:50.640> because<00:03:50.819> I<00:03:51.060> think<00:03:51.360> it

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
life I don't like it because I think it

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.550 
life I don't like it because I think it
it's<00:03:52.370> you<00:03:53.370> have<00:03:53.549> unlimited<00:03:54.239> lives<00:03:54.450> and<00:03:54.930> that

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
it's you have unlimited lives and that

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.679 
it's you have unlimited lives and that
kind<00:03:55.769> of<00:03:55.799> takes<00:03:56.069> away<00:03:56.400> from<00:03:56.430> the<00:03:56.730> whole<00:03:56.849> zombie

00:03:57.679 --> 00:03:57.689 
kind of takes away from the whole zombie

00:03:57.689 --> 00:04:00.050 
kind of takes away from the whole zombie
survival<00:03:58.349> experience<00:03:59.129> now<00:03:59.640> you<00:03:59.700> don't<00:04:00.000> have

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
survival experience now you don't have

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.759 
survival experience now you don't have
unlimited<00:04:00.330> lives<00:04:00.629> you<00:04:00.840> go<00:04:00.989> down<00:04:01.230> I<00:04:01.260> think<00:04:01.650> if

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
unlimited lives you go down I think if

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:04.160 
unlimited lives you go down I think if
you<00:04:01.890> only<00:04:02.069> have<00:04:02.310> three<00:04:02.760> of<00:04:03.150> them<00:04:03.689> at<00:04:03.840> a<00:04:03.870> time

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
you only have three of them at a time

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.530 
you only have three of them at a time
but<00:04:04.379> every<00:04:04.769> round<00:04:05.010> you<00:04:05.189> get<00:04:05.340> a<00:04:05.370> new<00:04:05.610> one<00:04:05.819> so

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
but every round you get a new one so

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.110 
but every round you get a new one so
that<00:04:06.900> could<00:04:07.200> turn<00:04:07.470> into<00:04:07.530> unlimited<00:04:08.519> lives<00:04:08.700> and

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
that could turn into unlimited lives and

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.880 
that could turn into unlimited lives and
I<00:04:09.569> find<00:04:09.870> that<00:04:09.930> that<00:04:09.989> kind<00:04:10.200> of<00:04:10.230> takes<00:04:10.530> away<00:04:10.860> from

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
I find that that kind of takes away from

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.520 
I find that that kind of takes away from
the<00:04:11.189> whole<00:04:11.430> zombie<00:04:11.730> survival<00:04:12.390> experience<00:04:13.140> you

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
the whole zombie survival experience you

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.380 
the whole zombie survival experience you
know<00:04:13.680> I<00:04:13.890> liked<00:04:14.430> it<00:04:14.580> how<00:04:14.700> it<00:04:14.819> was<00:04:14.879> in<00:04:15.090> world<00:04:15.269> at

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
know I liked it how it was in world at

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.409 
know I liked it how it was in world at

go down and go down and I really didn't

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:26.870

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 
had the quick revive where you had three

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:34.280 
had the quick revive where you had three
lives<00:04:33.060> I<00:04:33.270> cannot<00:04:33.510> felt<00:04:33.840> that<00:04:33.960> it<00:04:34.050> took<00:04:34.140> away

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:34.290 
lives I cannot felt that it took away

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:35.600 
lives I cannot felt that it took away
from<00:04:34.440> the<00:04:34.680> whole<00:04:34.830> zombie<00:04:35.040> survival

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
from the whole zombie survival

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.580 
from the whole zombie survival
experience<00:04:36.330> you<00:04:36.810> know<00:04:36.930> I<00:04:36.960> kind<00:04:37.230> of<00:04:37.260> liked<00:04:37.440> it<00:04:37.560> a

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
experience you know I kind of liked it a

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.920 
experience you know I kind of liked it a
little<00:04:37.650> bit<00:04:37.830> better<00:04:37.950> now<00:04:38.240> but<00:04:39.240> I<00:04:39.300> really<00:04:39.750> liked

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
little bit better now but I really liked

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.930 
little bit better now but I really liked
the<00:04:40.110> whole<00:04:40.140> role<00:04:40.950> that<00:04:41.100> War<00:04:41.310> zombie<00:04:41.730> type

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
the whole role that War zombie type

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.030 
the whole role that War zombie type
thing<00:04:42.180> where<00:04:42.390> it's<00:04:42.630> one<00:04:42.930> life<00:04:43.170> and<00:04:43.470> that's<00:04:43.740> it

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 
thing where it's one life and that's it

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.570 
thing where it's one life and that's it
and<00:04:44.300> a<00:04:45.350> couple<00:04:46.350> of<00:04:46.530> things<00:04:46.770> that<00:04:46.980> I<00:04:47.010> liked

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
and a couple of things that I liked

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.150 
and a couple of things that I liked
about<00:04:47.610> this<00:04:48.150> map<00:04:48.450> I<00:04:48.810> like<00:04:49.260> the<00:04:49.380> blundergat<00:04:49.770> or

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
about this map I like the blundergat or

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.040 
about this map I like the blundergat or
the<00:04:50.280> acid<00:04:50.670> gate<00:04:50.880> I<00:04:50.910> really<00:04:51.510> like<00:04:51.660> that<00:04:51.810> gun

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
the acid gate I really like that gun

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.710 
the acid gate I really like that gun
it's<00:04:52.230> really<00:04:52.500> cool<00:04:52.800> really<00:04:53.520> fun<00:04:53.670> to<00:04:54.090> use<00:04:54.120> and

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
it's really cool really fun to use and

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.720 
it's really cool really fun to use and
again<00:04:55.410> I<00:04:55.560> love<00:04:55.800> the<00:04:55.950> way<00:04:56.040> the<00:04:56.160> colors<00:04:56.460> look<00:04:56.580> on

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:56.730 
again I love the way the colors look on

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:58.070 
again I love the way the colors look on
that<00:04:56.880> gun<00:04:57.030> especially<00:04:57.270> when<00:04:57.750> you<00:04:57.840> pack<00:04:58.050> a

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 
that gun especially when you pack a

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.660 
that gun especially when you pack a
punched<00:04:58.530> it<00:04:58.710> just<00:04:59.580> a<00:04:59.640> normal<00:04:59.760> version<00:05:00.090> and<00:05:00.480> the

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:01.670 
punched it just a normal version and the

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:05.750 
punched it just a normal version and the
what's<00:05:02.670> it<00:05:02.790> called<00:05:03.000> and<00:05:03.360> the<00:05:04.550> acid<00:05:05.550> gate

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:05.760 
what's it called and the acid gate

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:10.550 
what's it called and the acid gate
version<00:05:06.320> also<00:05:07.320> I<00:05:07.350> like<00:05:07.890> the<00:05:08.930> thumb<00:05:09.930> iconic<00:05:10.410> I

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
version also I like the thumb iconic I

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.020 
version also I like the thumb iconic I
can't<00:05:10.860> remember<00:05:11.100> a<00:05:11.220> lot<00:05:11.310> of<00:05:11.460> things<00:05:11.760> on<00:05:11.910> this

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 
can't remember a lot of things on this

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:13.850 
can't remember a lot of things on this
map<00:05:12.210> because<00:05:12.660> I<00:05:12.780> really<00:05:13.170> didn't<00:05:13.410> play<00:05:13.560> it

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 
map because I really didn't play it

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.000 
map because I really didn't play it
I<00:05:13.890> like<00:05:14.640> the<00:05:14.850> hells<00:05:15.150> retriever<00:05:15.240> or<00:05:16.010> whatever

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.010 
I like the hells retriever or whatever

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:19.520 
I like the hells retriever or whatever
it's<00:05:17.160> called<00:05:17.370> I<00:05:17.730> guess<00:05:18.180> pretty<00:05:18.360> cool<00:05:18.690> and

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530 
it's called I guess pretty cool and

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:21.350 
it's called I guess pretty cool and
equipment<00:05:20.010> you<00:05:20.160> can<00:05:20.310> get<00:05:20.580> rid<00:05:20.730> of<00:05:20.760> over<00:05:21.180> and

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 
equipment you can get rid of over and

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.000 
equipment you can get rid of over and
over<00:05:21.600> and<00:05:21.720> over<00:05:21.810> again<00:05:22.050> I<00:05:22.380> think<00:05:22.650> it's<00:05:22.860> pretty

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:23.010 
over and over again I think it's pretty

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:24.950 
over and over again I think it's pretty
sweet<00:05:23.310> the<00:05:23.490> golden<00:05:23.790> spork<00:05:24.060> also<00:05:24.570> I've<00:05:24.780> never

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 
sweet the golden spork also I've never

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.930 
sweet the golden spork also I've never
actually<00:05:25.170> gotten<00:05:25.560> it<00:05:25.800> but<00:05:26.220> I<00:05:26.280> heard<00:05:26.670> that<00:05:26.790> it's

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:26.940 
actually gotten it but I heard that it's

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:28.430 
actually gotten it but I heard that it's
pretty<00:05:27.120> sweet<00:05:27.360> I<00:05:27.510> see<00:05:27.630> some<00:05:27.780> gameplay<00:05:28.170> of<00:05:28.320> it

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 
pretty sweet I see some gameplay of it

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.440 
pretty sweet I see some gameplay of it
it's<00:05:28.530> like<00:05:28.620> a<00:05:28.680> 1<00:05:28.860> -<00:05:29.160> 2<00:05:29.370> like<00:05:29.490> around<00:05:29.640> 30<00:05:29.940> I<00:05:30.240> think

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:30.450 
it's like a 1 - 2 like around 30 I think

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:33.110 
it's like a 1 - 2 like around 30 I think
that's<00:05:30.840> pretty<00:05:30.990> cool<00:05:31.460> but<00:05:32.460> other<00:05:32.760> than<00:05:33.030> that

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 
that's pretty cool but other than that

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.880 
that's pretty cool but other than that
there's<00:05:33.600> not<00:05:33.780> really<00:05:33.840> much<00:05:34.290> like<00:05:34.530> about<00:05:34.770> this

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:57.570 
reason that I did forget to mention I

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:59.180 
reason that I did forget to mention I
think<00:05:57.600> this<00:05:57.870> is<00:05:57.960> a<00:05:58.050> pretty<00:05:58.320> important<00:05:58.890> reason

00:05:59.180 --> 00:05:59.190 
think this is a pretty important reason

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:01.640 
think this is a pretty important reason
why<00:05:59.400> I<00:05:59.430> don't<00:05:59.910> like<00:06:00.090> this<00:06:00.240> map<00:06:00.480> and<00:06:00.840> that<00:06:00.870> is

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:01.650 
why I don't like this map and that is

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:03.590 
why I don't like this map and that is
the<00:06:01.920> perk<00:06:02.370> selection<00:06:02.640> I<00:06:03.030> find<00:06:03.270> the<00:06:03.330> perk

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:03.600 
the perk selection I find the perk

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.040 
the perk selection I find the perk
selection<00:06:03.750> this<00:06:04.140> map<00:06:04.320> to<00:06:04.530> be<00:06:04.680> just<00:06:04.950> flat-out

selection this map to be just flat-out

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:08.930 
selection this map to be just flat-out
horrible<00:06:07.050> and<00:06:07.320> bad<00:06:07.950> because<00:06:08.550> if<00:06:08.670> you<00:06:08.730> look<00:06:08.850> at

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:08.940 
horrible and bad because if you look at

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.690 
horrible and bad because if you look at
the<00:06:09.000> perks<00:06:09.240> you<00:06:09.780> have<00:06:10.040> juggernaut<00:06:11.040> speed<00:06:11.490> coal
