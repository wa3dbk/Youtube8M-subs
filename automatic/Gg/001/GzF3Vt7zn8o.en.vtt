00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.090
 Hi there, you are watching a video blog about 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.639
 raw food eating 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:10.620
 My name is Elena and today I will answer 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.770
 as many as two burning questions 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.840
 concerning the area so 1 how to survive 

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:17.820
 Syroyid during the crisis without prejudice to 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.859
 family budget and 2 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.810
 how to overcome a panic desire 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.660
 eat a hamburger sandwich or something 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.369
 similar answer to both of these questions you 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.669
 learn in the recipe with which I am today 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.310
 share with you don't miss get started 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:34.110
 it is from a sandwich know my one 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.449
 familiar to athletes who switched to 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.449
 raw foods still dream of a hamburger and 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:41.489
 it is no coincidence that we are not so dependent on 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:44.699
 ingredients included in the composition of fast food 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.100
 how much psychologically want to feel in 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:49.379
 Mouth juicy mess with bread such here 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.539
 I civilization that is what you can eat 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.190
 Of course to overcome this desire by force of will 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.350
 get rid of squeak get 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.840
 dependencies but get a couple of others 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.210
 neurosis and you can go on a gentle path 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.879
 and cook for example raw food eater and sandwich 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.250
 and it will be really easy and teach 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.870
 you make raw food loaves I have more than once 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.480
 preparing them experimenting with the recipe 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:11.040
 and finally found the perfect and not 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.050
 only according to taste characteristics 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.270
 but also for the price of incoming ingredients 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.590
 composition that automatically translates us 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.560
 to solve 2 problems 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.290
 healthy nutrition and crisis likely 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.660
 bread enters carrots which never 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.830
 no crisis will hit onions 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:33.150
 the fault of seven hundred rubles for half a kilogram 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:36.030
 dried herbs to taste salt and garlic 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.680
 which is also quite available for 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.780
 making bread to us again 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.490
 will need the same dehydrator in 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.340
 which we once dried tomatoes 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.710
 now he was sushi for on the blind for 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:50.450
 dough we need to grind a length of 7 in 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.450
 coffee grinder to flour 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:03.369
 and we get a real live 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:05.979
 chemical not bleached flour 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:19.330
 by the same of very useful flaxseed 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:28.500
 Seed chop carrot onion in a blender 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:31.780
 and garlic 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.670
 by the way do not forget before cooking 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:43.420
 soak the onion in lemon juice and drinking 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:47.190
 water otherwise it will be bitter 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.190
 mass add a few layout 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:03:02.489
 add the final touch to taste 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:03:02.489
 dried herbs salt i use sea and 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:11.380
 stir the dough 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:13.660
 trying to achieve a homogeneous mass after 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.889
 we all have to be given 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:19.049
 Dough a little stand 

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:19.049
 so that flax flour absorbs moisture 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:25.120
 we spread homogeneous mass on sheets 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:28.109
 the parchment layer must be thick 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.109
 about 5 millimeters 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.200
 these sheets well, then we will put 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:38.710
 dehydrator so forget right away about 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:42.630
 that the size was necessary we cut at once 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:42.630
 knife into pieces of desired shape and 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:55.030
 now load the parchment dryer 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.760
 don't forget that temperature we 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:00.720
 exhibit no more than forty degrees for 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:03.940
 to keep breads alive 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:06.580
 they will need to dry about 12 hours 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:11.010
 and after drying they make you look like this 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:11.010
 I did in advance to show you 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:16.720
 you know, I had an idea 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.940

00:04:47.809 --> 00:04:52.529
 chemical declare or flour and other 

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:54.149
 eat bad things with areas of bread with your 

00:04:52.529 --> 00:04:56.399
 make salads from non burgers and

00:04:56.399 --> 00:05:00.599

 raw food experiments now require 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:08.939
