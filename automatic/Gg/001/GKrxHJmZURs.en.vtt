 in Nancy last weekend it's a 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.790

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.269
 started in in the same club and that's 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.280
 a player with great potential 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.030
 missed technique largely above 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.469

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.650
 training 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.029

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.039
 on his journey information that is 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.570
 also his first experience with 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.890
 the professionals he machine and 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.869
 stéphane orré kenny montage david 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.320
 pelletier is the love of football 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.039
 since all the time I do that I 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:42.210
 could not explain but it's 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:44.940
 like that it's in me I like football me 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.360
 already I come from a family that plays 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.090
 football 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.640
 my father played a good level also did not 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.230
 not had the chance to play at a very high level 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.730
 level 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.070
 then even in the barrel very early I 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:00.030
 liked that and I started my first 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:02.219
 club in l1 18th I did two years after 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.159
 I was lucky to be rubbed by Lyon 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.960
 and at the end of a day in lyon because 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.840
 that it was my heart club it was the 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.010
 club the big club of lyon and I would say 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.050
 that came without hesitation 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.810
 waze is younger age judges 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.890
 had made it easier to touch the ball 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.720
 throw it 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:23.460
 I also had big shots that made me 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.460
 aided also in the category 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.000
 me it is true that we had made a beautiful 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.590
 course last year we had done 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.340
 a good season that allowed hac to 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.870
 allowed to qualify in the final pool 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.870
 well I'm great we managed to 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:54.150
 final score is unfortunately that 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:56.030
 will fit mâcon failed to win 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:59.160
 but we did a very nice course and 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.830
 I was very honored this year the 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.840
 voice are a lot of players we were in 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.640
 cohesion we are friends first and foremost 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.250
 and after that it feels on the ground and 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.880
 young talents who are either caries 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:14.640
 or anthony or romaric luis and one is 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.500
 really have a good cohesion and that 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.370
 is on the ground and I hope 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:24.780
 we will do good things has 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:26.520
 the impression of addressing the whole there is 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.959
 some regrets because then we 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.420
 could have won because that's it 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:32.070
 had an opinion all for but here you go 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.540
 it's a little past but allah I 'm going 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.540
 still a little through the throat 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.340
 Yes 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:03:02.250
 I took over with 19 years the coach 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.780
 told me that if I do a good 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.819
 preparation I was going to join the group 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:09.750
 That's what I managed to do 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:12.510
 climb in cfa and after I was expecting 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.690
 really it's been really 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.690
 quick 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:29.349
 afterwards I knew the world a little 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.410
 pro and that's it's really another 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:34.980
 world is very very happy to have 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.980
 reached that group 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:42.540
 for sure it's me managing on TV 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.490
 it made me dream like that 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.400
 how was everyone when the 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:48.060
 rub shoulders with everyday life it's really 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.220
 really take all that is to 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.390
 take with them because it's 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.580
 experienced people is often not 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.050
 Patients us young but because 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.630
 we are hungry for balloon we want to play 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:58.170
 when we look at the top it gives 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.780
 really want 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:03.860
 I was listening this weekend I really 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.860
 want to go back very quickly 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.720
 we arrive every day it's really 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.250
 every day I would really love 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.670
 will do everything to make her dreams come true 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:14.890
 realize 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:18.170
 is it really a pride 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:21.260
 I scored at gerland in front of his club 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:23.560
 inform us that this is really 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.560
 awesome 

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:31.560
 that's how it was said cyril was 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.669
 better placed than all of us except for 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.249
 talk because you really are 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:36.840
 the academy since forever 

00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:38.610
 I would almost say it's a little thy 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.249
 specialty in the chain is a name but 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:43.080
 this is frankly if this player keeps 

00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:44.819
 although as mentioned earlier the 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.210
 head on the shoulders if the entourage is 

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:46.919
 clean 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.240
 around him normally that should 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:49.949
 to be something very interesting 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.509
 it is a player in any case take 

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:53.789
 potential that has enormous potential 

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:55.259
 it's one of those generations 95 on 

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:57.840
 talked a lot about the generation 87 

00:04:55.259 --> 00:05:00.599
 much talked about the 91 generation and the 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.620
 generation 95 were also going from a very 

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:03.300
 high level will still remind him that he 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.830
 are five club players who are in 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.659
 France team and it's rarely a 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:08.370
 chance when there is such a generation 

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:10.169
 who is there so here anyway we 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.370
 obviously wish good luck to fares 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:12.629
 bat loïc has discovered this group 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:16.849
 professional and we wish him 

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:16.849
 obviously the most beautiful future possible
