00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
stance in this program I think that the

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.330 
stance in this program I think that the
presidency<00:00:25.590> of<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.680> United<00:00:25.949> States<00:00:26.010> is

presidency of the United States is

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.670 
presidency of the United States is
something<00:00:26.609> we<00:00:26.699> all<00:00:26.849> care<00:00:27.029> about<00:00:27.230> and<00:00:28.230> what<00:00:28.560> I'd

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
something we all care about and what I'd

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.429 
something we all care about and what I'd
like<00:00:28.890> to<00:00:28.980> see<00:00:29.099> on<00:00:29.189> election<00:00:29.550> night<00:00:29.660> is<00:00:30.660> as<00:00:31.230> the

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
like to see on election night is as the

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:32.749 
like to see on election night is as the
votes<00:00:31.619> are<00:00:31.769> coming<00:00:31.920> in<00:00:32.189> they're<00:00:32.430> they're

votes are coming in they're they're

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.780

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
being counted and the numbers rise that

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.150 
being counted and the numbers rise that
we<00:00:36.059> see<00:00:36.600> numbers<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.320> we<00:00:37.530> can<00:00:37.559> recognize<00:00:37.920> that

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
we see numbers and we can recognize that

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.470 
we see numbers and we can recognize that
one<00:00:38.460> of<00:00:38.489> those<00:00:38.670> votes<00:00:38.879> is<00:00:39.149> ours

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
one of those votes is ours

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.819 
one of those votes is ours
and<00:00:39.690> when<00:00:40.469> it<00:00:40.559> gets<00:00:40.680> to<00:00:40.980> be<00:00:41.480> 65<00:00:42.480> million<00:00:42.780> to<00:00:43.140> 62

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
and when it gets to be 65 million to 62

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.069 
and when it gets to be 65 million to 62
million<00:00:44.070> or<00:00:44.340> whatever<00:00:44.489> it<00:00:44.789> is<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.750> one<00:00:45.930> with

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
million or whatever it is the one with

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.319 
million or whatever it is the one with
more<00:00:46.230> votes<00:00:46.469> wins<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:47.039> that<00:00:47.670> every<00:00:48.030> vote<00:00:48.180> is

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
more votes wins and that every vote is

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.000 
more votes wins and that every vote is
equal<00:00:48.629> wherever<00:00:48.930> it's<00:00:49.110> cast<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.680> that's<00:00:49.860> what

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
equal wherever it's cast and that's what

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.529 
equal wherever it's cast and that's what
we<00:00:50.100> don't<00:00:50.219> we<00:00:50.399> don't<00:00:50.520> have<00:00:50.640> that<00:00:50.969> now<00:00:51.000> so<00:00:51.390> we

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
we don't we don't have that now so we

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.560 
we don't we don't have that now so we
can<00:00:51.690> have<00:00:52.699> presidents<00:00:53.699> win<00:00:53.850> with<00:00:54.090> fewer<00:00:54.360> votes

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
can have presidents win with fewer votes

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.180 
can have presidents win with fewer votes
and<00:00:54.870> that<00:00:55.140> happens<00:00:55.530> more<00:00:55.590> often<00:00:55.920> than<00:00:56.070> people

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
and that happens more often than people

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.340 
and that happens more often than people
think<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:56.820> almost<00:00:57.180> happens<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.719> lot<00:00:57.960> more<00:00:58.199> than

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
think and almost happens a lot more than

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.979 
think and almost happens a lot more than
that<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:58.770> that<00:00:59.730> of<00:01:00.000> course<00:01:00.030> is<00:01:00.359> a<00:01:00.390> problem<00:01:00.570> and

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
that and that of course is a problem and

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.470 
that and that of course is a problem and
I<00:01:01.170> think<00:01:01.789> fundamentally<00:01:02.789> what<00:01:02.910> happens<00:01:03.180> every

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
I think fundamentally what happens every

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.570 
I think fundamentally what happens every
election<00:01:03.510> is<00:01:04.049> that<00:01:04.650> there's<00:01:04.799> a<00:01:04.860> few<00:01:05.250> states

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
election is that there's a few states

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.100 
election is that there's a few states
that<00:01:05.700> get<00:01:05.939> all<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.299> attention<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:06.840> their

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
that get all the attention and their

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.080 
that get all the attention and their
votes<00:01:07.290> are<00:01:07.439> magnified<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.310> their<00:01:08.880> votes

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
votes are magnified and their votes

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.420 
votes are magnified and their votes
really<00:01:09.450> count<00:01:09.600> and<00:01:10.110> that's<00:01:10.170> maybe<00:01:10.409> 10<00:01:11.010> 12

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
really count and that's maybe 10 12

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.160 
really count and that's maybe 10 12
states<00:01:11.790> at<00:01:12.000> most<00:01:13.760> 98<00:01:14.760> percent<00:01:15.450> of<00:01:15.600> money<00:01:15.900> and

states at most 98 percent of money and

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.170 
states at most 98 percent of money and
campaign<00:01:16.590> visits<00:01:16.950> was<00:01:17.130> in<00:01:17.250> just<00:01:17.460> 15<00:01:17.850> states

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
campaign visits was in just 15 states

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.649 
campaign visits was in just 15 states
this<00:01:18.479> this<00:01:18.869> cycle<00:01:19.110> in<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.619> fall<00:01:20.100> and<00:01:20.369> then<00:01:21.000> the

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
this this cycle in the fall and then the

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:22.940 
this this cycle in the fall and then the
rest<00:01:21.840> of<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:21.990> votes<00:01:22.140> are<00:01:22.320> really<00:01:22.500> diminished

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
rest of the votes are really diminished

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.950 
rest of the votes are really diminished
they're<00:01:23.220> they're<00:01:23.700> they're<00:01:24.119> miniaturized<00:01:24.509> and

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
they're they're they're miniaturized and

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.830 
they're they're they're miniaturized and
and<00:01:25.200> those<00:01:25.799> votes<00:01:26.070> don't<00:01:26.369> count<00:01:26.520> in<00:01:27.240> in<00:01:27.509> nearly

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
and those votes don't count in in nearly

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.090 
and those votes don't count in in nearly
the<00:01:27.960> same<00:01:28.110> way<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.530> I<00:01:28.560> think<00:01:28.650> we<00:01:28.799> should<00:01:29.009> have

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
the same way and I think we should have

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.890 
the same way and I think we should have
a<00:01:29.159> system<00:01:29.460> where<00:01:29.549> every<00:01:29.759> vote<00:01:29.850> cycle<00:01:30.210> at<00:01:30.810> the

state system the states were all and
it's<00:01:51.270> part<00:01:51.540> of<00:01:51.570> a<00:01:51.689> system<00:01:52.049> in<00:01:52.170> which<00:01:52.200> was

in which the states have a significant

significant role in presidential

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.420 
significant role in presidential
elections<00:02:00.750> in<00:02:00.930> making<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.740> rules<00:02:01.979> and<00:02:02.340> then

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
elections in making the rules and then

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.280 
elections in making the rules and then
carrying<00:02:02.850> out<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.149> elections<00:02:03.869> and<00:02:04.020> this<00:02:04.140> is

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
carrying out the elections and this is

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.709 
carrying out the elections and this is
part<00:02:04.560> of<00:02:04.649> it<00:02:04.799> I<00:02:04.920> think<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.790> Electoral<00:02:06.689> College

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
part of it I think the Electoral College

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.460 
part of it I think the Electoral College
is<00:02:07.350> part<00:02:07.740> of<00:02:07.950> maintaining<00:02:08.250> a<00:02:08.789> balance<00:02:09.330> between

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
is part of maintaining a balance between

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.170 
is part of maintaining a balance between
state<00:02:10.470> and<00:02:10.800> nation<00:02:11.340> between

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
state and nation between

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.059 
state and nation between
sort<00:02:13.390> of<00:02:13.420> fragmentation<00:02:14.379> of<00:02:14.500> power<00:02:14.739> and

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
sort of fragmentation of power and

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:16.800 
sort of fragmentation of power and
centralization<00:02:15.939> of<00:02:16.060> power<00:02:16.120> I<00:02:16.390> think<00:02:16.540> that's

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
centralization of power I think that's

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.839 
centralization of power I think that's
an<00:02:16.930> important<00:02:17.439> thing<00:02:17.680> if<00:02:18.159> we<00:02:18.370> move<00:02:18.579> to<00:02:18.819> a

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:18.849 
an important thing if we move to a

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:20.670 
an important thing if we move to a
direct<00:02:19.269> election<00:02:19.810> what<00:02:19.959> I<00:02:19.989> would<00:02:20.200> think<00:02:20.349> of<00:02:20.560> as

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
direct election what I would think of as

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.160 
direct election what I would think of as
a<00:02:20.709> national<00:02:21.340> democracy<00:02:21.870> we're<00:02:22.870> going<00:02:23.079> to

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
a national democracy we're going to

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.470 
a national democracy we're going to
change<00:02:23.500> the<00:02:23.739> regime<00:02:23.890> in<00:02:24.280> important<00:02:24.760> ways<00:02:24.790> and

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
change the regime in important ways and

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.229 
change the regime in important ways and
I<00:02:25.659> think<00:02:25.689> it's<00:02:26.079> a<00:02:26.200> change<00:02:26.890> that<00:02:27.549> is<00:02:27.700> actually

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
I think it's a change that is actually

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.149 
I think it's a change that is actually
fundamental<00:02:28.900> and<00:02:29.109> should<00:02:29.290> be<00:02:29.409> done<00:02:29.620> by<00:02:29.920> if

00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:30.159 
fundamental and should be done by if

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:31.860 
fundamental and should be done by if
it's<00:02:30.340> going<00:02:30.489> to<00:02:30.579> be<00:02:30.760> done<00:02:30.939> should<00:02:31.239> be<00:02:31.269> done<00:02:31.389> by

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
it's going to be done should be done by

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.319 
it's going to be done should be done by
a<00:02:31.900> constitutional<00:02:32.889> amendment<00:02:33.010> right<00:02:34.000> now<00:02:34.150> in

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:34.329 
a constitutional amendment right now in

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:35.940 
a constitutional amendment right now in
other<00:02:34.420> words<00:02:34.510> the<00:02:35.049> system<00:02:35.260> we<00:02:35.590> have<00:02:35.769> the

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
other words the system we have the

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.129 
other words the system we have the
Electoral<00:02:36.430> College<00:02:36.459> is<00:02:36.939> important<00:02:37.540> to<00:02:37.780> having

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:38.139 
Electoral College is important to having

00:02:38.139 --> 00:02:39.720 
Electoral College is important to having
what<00:02:38.290> I<00:02:38.319> would<00:02:38.530> think<00:02:38.799> of<00:02:38.980> as<00:02:39.099> a<00:02:39.129> compound

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
what I would think of as a compound

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.789 
what I would think of as a compound
Republic<00:02:40.450> that's<00:02:40.719> what<00:02:40.959> our<00:02:41.170> Constitution

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 
Republic that's what our Constitution

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:44.759 
Republic that's what our Constitution
what<00:02:42.519> the<00:02:42.639> founding<00:02:43.060> fathers<00:02:43.480> set<00:02:43.780> up<00:02:43.989> and<00:02:44.680> I

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
what the founding fathers set up and I

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:47.069 
what the founding fathers set up and I
think<00:02:45.010> if<00:02:45.579> you<00:02:45.760> change<00:02:46.090> that<00:02:46.389> if<00:02:46.569> you<00:02:46.659> move<00:02:46.870> to

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:47.079 
think if you change that if you move to

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:50.009 
think if you change that if you move to
a<00:02:47.109> more<00:02:47.470> national<00:02:47.769> system<00:02:48.780> you're<00:02:49.780> really

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
a more national system you're really

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:51.780 
a more national system you're really
going<00:02:50.169> to<00:02:50.260> change<00:02:50.560> the<00:02:51.099> system<00:02:51.280> fundamentally

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
going to change the system fundamentally

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.569 
going to change the system fundamentally
and<00:02:52.450> a<00:02:52.720> lot<00:02:52.870> of<00:02:52.900> the<00:02:53.079> things<00:02:53.290> Rob<00:02:53.590> said<00:02:53.950> are

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:54.579 
and a lot of the things Rob said are

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:57.470 
and a lot of the things Rob said are
very<00:02:54.790> common<00:02:55.180> but<00:02:55.209> I<00:02:55.329> think<00:02:55.540> many<00:02:55.810> of<00:02:56.019> them<00:02:56.260> are

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
very common but I think many of them are

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.729 
very common but I think many of them are
questionable<00:02:58.480> and<00:02:58.629> in<00:02:58.959> some<00:02:59.139> cases<00:02:59.349> wrong

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
questionable and in some cases wrong

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:02.759 
questionable and in some cases wrong
about<00:03:00.010> the<00:03:00.939> way<00:03:01.450> to<00:03:01.480> vote<00:03:01.750> we<00:03:02.469> could<00:03:02.620> talk

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:02.769 
about the way to vote we could talk

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:04.379 
about the way to vote we could talk
about<00:03:02.889> those<00:03:03.129> in<00:03:03.310> more<00:03:03.340> detail<00:03:03.760> as<00:03:03.939> our<00:03:04.090> half

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:04.389 
about those in more detail as our half

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:05.940 
about those in more detail as our half
hour<00:03:04.540> with<00:03:04.810> both<00:03:04.989> of<00:03:05.139> you<00:03:05.230> progresses<00:03:05.739> let<00:03:05.859> me

had a different outcome but that

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.890 
had a different outcome but that
certainly<00:04:02.139> the<00:04:02.530> voters<00:04:02.889> perceived<00:04:03.459> it<00:04:03.699> as<00:04:03.909> one

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
certainly the voters perceived it as one

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.020 
certainly the voters perceived it as one
that<00:04:05.169> was<00:04:05.680> unfair<00:04:06.040> certainly<00:04:06.459> at<00:04:06.669> least<00:04:06.879> a

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
that was unfair certainly at least a

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:08.789 
that was unfair certainly at least a
chunk<00:04:07.359> of<00:04:07.479> voters<00:04:07.720> did<00:04:07.900> in<00:04:07.989> 2000<00:04:08.500> and<00:04:08.590> others

chunk of voters did in 2000 and others

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:11.909 
chunk of voters did in 2000 and others
didn't<00:04:09.129> but<00:04:10.090> we<00:04:10.180> also<00:04:10.389> see<00:04:10.840> that<00:04:11.079> happen<00:04:11.560> again

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:11.919 
didn't but we also see that happen again

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:15.479 
didn't but we also see that happen again
and<00:04:12.009> again<00:04:12.280> as<00:04:12.720> as<00:04:13.720> coming<00:04:14.199> very<00:04:14.470> close<00:04:14.799> so

what's the the division of votes in the
region<00:05:15.940> and<00:05:16.060> so<00:05:16.150> on<00:05:16.330> but<00:05:16.450> let<00:05:16.600> me<00:05:16.690> respond<00:05:17.170> to

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:17.290 
region and so on but let me respond to

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:18.720 
region and so on but let me respond to
this<00:05:17.410> question<00:05:17.650> because<00:05:17.980> I<00:05:18.130> think<00:05:18.400> it's

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:18.730 
this question because I think it's

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:21.360 
this question because I think it's
actually<00:05:18.910> a<00:05:19.780> one<00:05:20.200> that<00:05:20.470> I<00:05:20.740> would<00:05:21.040> disagree

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:21.370 
actually a one that I would disagree

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:24.450 
actually a one that I would disagree
with<00:05:21.520> Rob<00:05:22.030> about<00:05:22.330> for<00:05:23.110> example<00:05:23.560> the<00:05:24.190> sort<00:05:24.400> of

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:24.460 
with Rob about for example the sort of

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:25.860 
with Rob about for example the sort of
notion<00:05:24.790> here<00:05:25.000> is<00:05:25.030> that<00:05:25.120> things<00:05:25.450> don't<00:05:25.720> change

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
notion here is that things don't change

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.710 
notion here is that things don't change
we<00:05:26.440> saw<00:05:26.650> here<00:05:26.950> in<00:05:27.070> the<00:05:27.190> 2008<00:05:27.910> campaign<00:05:28.180> and<00:05:28.660> the

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:28.720 
we saw here in the 2008 campaign and the

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.740 
we saw here in the 2008 campaign and the
results<00:05:29.170> are<00:05:29.290> actually<00:05:29.440> a<00:05:29.770> very<00:05:30.450> productive<00:05:31.450> I

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:31.750 
results are actually a very productive I

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:33.390 
results are actually a very productive I
think<00:05:31.960> for<00:05:32.170> the<00:05:32.290> electoral<00:05:32.800> cards<00:05:33.070> they<00:05:33.220> show

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:33.400 
think for the electoral cards they show

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.760 
think for the electoral cards they show
one<00:05:33.610> of<00:05:33.640> its<00:05:33.850> strengths<00:05:34.300> and<00:05:34.440> President<00:05:35.440> Obama

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:35.770 
one of its strengths and President Obama

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.910 
one of its strengths and President Obama
won<00:05:36.160> by<00:05:36.510> three<00:05:37.510> or<00:05:37.600> four<00:05:37.630> points<00:05:38.410> in<00:05:38.560> the

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:38.920 
won by three or four points in the

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.490 
won by three or four points in the
popular<00:05:39.790> vote<00:05:39.820> he<00:05:40.270> won<00:05:40.300> two-to-one<00:05:41.140> in<00:05:41.170> the

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:41.500 
popular vote he won two-to-one in the

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.290 
popular vote he won two-to-one in the
electoral<00:05:41.890> college<00:05:41.980> he's<00:05:42.580> going<00:05:42.820> to<00:05:42.910> come<00:05:43.090> in

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:43.300 
electoral college he's going to come in

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.470 
electoral college he's going to come in
with<00:05:43.590> a<00:05:44.590> more<00:05:45.070> settled<00:05:45.370> and<00:05:45.730> legitimate<00:05:46.330> I

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:46.480 
with a more settled and legitimate I

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:47.880 
with a more settled and legitimate I
think<00:05:46.690> presidency<00:05:47.290> than<00:05:47.470> he<00:05:47.530> would<00:05:47.650> have<00:05:47.740> had

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:47.890 
think presidency than he would have had

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:51.360 
think presidency than he would have had
otherwise<00:05:48.780> the<00:05:49.780> other<00:05:49.930> thing<00:05:50.200> I<00:05:50.440> would<00:05:50.770> say

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:51.370 
otherwise the other thing I would say

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.130 
otherwise the other thing I would say
about<00:05:51.550> this<00:05:51.730> is<00:05:51.790> the<00:05:52.120> states<00:05:52.390> that<00:05:52.660> get<00:05:52.810> all<00:05:52.990> of

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:53.140 
about this is the states that get all of

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:54.960 
about this is the states that get all of
the<00:05:53.260> attention<00:05:53.500> it's<00:05:53.860> not<00:05:54.010> clear<00:05:54.310> that<00:05:54.340> that's

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:54.970 
the attention it's not clear that that's

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:57.240 
the attention it's not clear that that's
true<00:05:55.240> at<00:05:55.360> all<00:05:55.480> and<00:05:55.840> I'll<00:05:56.470> go<00:05:56.860> into<00:05:57.040> some<00:05:57.070> of

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:57.250 
true at all and I'll go into some of

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:58.980 
true at all and I'll go into some of
those<00:05:57.340> studies<00:05:57.640> later<00:05:58.030> but<00:05:58.570> I<00:05:58.600> would<00:05:58.750> point

00:05:58.980 --> 00:05:58.990 
those studies later but I would point

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:01.440 
those studies later but I would point
out<00:05:59.140> that<00:05:59.380> five<00:05:59.680> states<00:06:00.160> in<00:06:00.580> this<00:06:01.090> election

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:01.450 
out that five states in this election

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:03.030 
out that five states in this election
that<00:06:01.690> were<00:06:01.810> assumed<00:06:02.200> to<00:06:02.350> be<00:06:02.380> rock-ribbed

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:03.040 
that were assumed to be rock-ribbed

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.700 
that were assumed to be rock-ribbed
Republican<00:06:03.760> states<00:06:04.060> forever<00:06:04.540> turned<00:06:05.320> out<00:06:05.500> and

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:05.710 
Republican states forever turned out and

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:07.620 
Republican states forever turned out and
voted<00:06:05.980> for<00:06:06.010> Barack<00:06:06.550> Obama<00:06:06.970> in<00:06:07.180> this<00:06:07.330> election

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:09.940 
states moved from competitive to

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:11.970 
states moved from competitive to
non-competitive<00:06:10.780> so<00:06:10.960> it's<00:06:11.080> not<00:06:11.230> always<00:06:11.740> like

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:11.980 
non-competitive so it's not always like

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:13.620 
non-competitive so it's not always like
the<00:06:12.310> states<00:06:12.580> we're<00:06:12.910> talking<00:06:13.270> about<00:06:13.450> are

the states we're talking about are

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:16.650 
the states we're talking about are

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:16.660 
always going to be states that are taken

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:20.070 
always going to be states that are taken
