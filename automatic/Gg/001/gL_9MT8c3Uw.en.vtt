 I would like to explain Poohsoft 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:13.490
 I downloaded that software, I'm launching 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:18.080

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.260
 I think you will see the screen is out 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.300
 Because it is what appears on the screen of that mac 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.570

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:09.750
 Kedomo is this kind of game this large Sugen 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:09.750
 It will be a little swaying movement of the screen 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:19.229
 Yama it will not clean out that ward psychic 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.229

 Luigi N 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:33.250
 But such is the feeling 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.250
 I'm doing while watching the Imai package 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:40.630

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:43.630
 Play games 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:47.159
 It's say the kana difficult 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.159
 I think I can not get creative 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.619
 Yes 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:57.909
 I'm doing just so much game 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.590
 It is a game because the father-in-law is not the subject 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:03.930
 It is and 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:08.940
 Not 's It is the other game, for example, Well 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:13.880
 It feels like you're changing something on ipad when you're meeting 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:18.600
 I think but whether not it becomes possible also that it is also possible to say that while holding down the key 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:20.240

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:28.569
 If the character is about the corner of a thing 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:30.740
 Well, I don't think so much about drawing speed 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:33.100
 Be surprising 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:35.730

 I think it will be easier to explain but what about it? 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:07.430
 It is red, and the size of the screen is 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.430
 You can change it freely 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:27.299
 The first Mako can be free and small to bring 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.299
 It can also move 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:35.720

 To be 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:51.380
 Yes 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:53.190
 End and after all the software 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:56.799
 By chance 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:04:00.280
 Well, when it comes to the end form 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:03.689
