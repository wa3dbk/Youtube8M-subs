00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.529 

that's<00:00:23.860> always<00:00:24.100> been<00:00:24.370> about<00:00:24.610> doing

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:26.539 
that's always been about doing

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:28.109 
that's always been about doing
set<00:00:26.779> yourself<00:00:26.929> apart<00:00:27.259> from<00:00:27.650> the<00:00:27.710> competition

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930 
it's about time that I come out with a

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.440 
it's about time that I come out with a
new<00:00:48.050> look<00:00:48.470> that's<00:00:48.890> fresh<00:00:49.250> and<00:00:49.640> something<00:00:50.300> that

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:50.450 
new look that's fresh and something that

fits<00:00:50.690> my<00:00:50.870> image<00:00:51.320> so<00:00:51.680> it's<00:00:51.890> always<00:00:52.160> been<00:00:52.370> black

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
fits my image so it's always been black

00:00:52.670 --> 00:01:50.340 
fits my image so it's always been black
and<00:00:53.120> dark

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.039 

we<00:01:51.159> have<00:01:51.310> the<00:01:51.490> best<00:01:51.670> team<00:01:51.970> it's<00:01:52.540> about<00:01:52.600> Lenny

we have the best team it's about Lenny

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:55.289 
we have the best team it's about Lenny
being<00:01:53.560> a<00:01:53.619> champion<00:01:53.860> have<00:01:54.610> a<00:01:54.640> look<00:01:54.909> that<00:01:55.090> no<00:01:55.180> one
