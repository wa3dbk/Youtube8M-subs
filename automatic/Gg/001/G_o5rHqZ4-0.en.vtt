when you're walking

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.420 
when you're walking

I recommend carrying extra mags but you

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.529 
I recommend carrying extra mags but you
just<00:00:44.610> start<00:00:44.850> now<00:00:44.969> you<00:00:45.030> only<00:00:45.239> have<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.420> couple

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
just start now you only have a couple

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.470 
just start now you only have a couple
mags<00:00:46.610> maybe<00:00:47.610> this<00:00:47.789> will<00:00:47.910> be<00:00:48.000> an<00:00:48.090> option<00:00:48.450> for

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
mags maybe this will be an option for

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.779 
mags maybe this will be an option for
you<00:00:48.750> carry<00:00:49.020> ammo<00:00:49.379> and<00:00:49.590> it's<00:00:49.890> not<00:00:50.070> as<00:00:50.190> noisy<00:00:50.370> as

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
you carry ammo and it's not as noisy as

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.630 
you carry ammo and it's not as noisy as
carrying<00:00:51.120> in<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.270> box<00:00:52.070> the<00:00:53.070> next<00:00:53.340> thing<00:00:53.520> will

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
carrying in the box the next thing will

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.560 
carrying in the box the next thing will
be<00:00:53.760> for<00:00:54.410> revolvers<00:00:55.879> revolvers<00:00:56.879> typically<00:00:57.420> has

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
be for revolvers revolvers typically has

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.720 
be for revolvers revolvers typically has
less<00:00:57.809> firepower<00:00:58.079> than<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.590> semi-automatic<00:00:59.280> so

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
less firepower than a semi-automatic so

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.260 
less firepower than a semi-automatic so
you<00:00:59.789> have<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.329> be<00:01:01.489> careful<00:01:02.489> with<00:01:02.760> your<00:01:02.850> rounds

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270
