you're pretty confident and you can do

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.420 
you're pretty confident and you can do
the<00:01:24.270> most<00:01:24.450> of<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.990> times<00:01:25.259> you're<00:01:25.920> now<00:01:26.130> ready

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
the most of the times you're now ready

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.389 
the most of the times you're now ready
to<00:01:26.700> try<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.360> flick<00:01:27.720> it<00:01:27.869> up<00:01:27.960> yourself<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.649> try

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:29.399 
to try to flick it up yourself and try

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:31.370 
to try to flick it up yourself and try
to<00:01:29.460> move<00:01:29.700> here's<00:01:30.509> how<00:01:30.689> your<00:01:30.810> leg<00:01:30.990> should<00:01:31.170> look

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
to move here's how your leg should look

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:40.460 
to move here's how your leg should look
like<00:01:31.409> when<00:01:31.920> your<00:01:32.310> foot<00:01:32.580> meets<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.210> ball

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.900 

a<00:01:40.530> very<00:01:41.460> important<00:01:42.360> tip<00:01:42.870> is<00:01:43.280> the<00:01:44.280> positioning

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:44.910 
a very important tip is the positioning

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.440 
a very important tip is the positioning
of<00:01:45.060> your<00:01:45.120> leg<00:01:45.450> your<00:01:46.200> leg<00:01:46.470> should<00:01:46.740> be<00:01:46.800> bent<00:01:47.450> like

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
of your leg your leg should be bent like

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.900 
of your leg your leg should be bent like
your<00:01:48.750> knee<00:01:48.930> has<00:01:49.230> to<00:01:49.380> be<00:01:49.470> up<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:49.920> a<00:01:50.280> 90-degree

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:50.910 
your knee has to be up and a 90-degree

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.110 
your knee has to be up and a 90-degree
angle<00:01:51.530> so<00:01:52.530> it's<00:01:52.830> easier<00:01:53.250> when<00:01:53.640> you<00:01:53.790> flick

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:54.120 
angle so it's easier when you flick

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.750 
angle so it's easier when you flick
after<00:01:54.960> you're<00:01:55.140> very<00:01:55.380> confident<00:01:55.950> doing<00:01:56.580> it

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:56.760 
after you're very confident doing it

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.860 
after you're very confident doing it

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:00.870 
while bouncing it's now time to do one

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.200 
while bouncing it's now time to do one
of<00:02:00.900> your<00:02:01.110> own<00:02:01.200> flicks<00:02:01.590> and<00:02:01.860> then<00:02:02.400> try<00:02:02.850> to<00:02:02.910> do
