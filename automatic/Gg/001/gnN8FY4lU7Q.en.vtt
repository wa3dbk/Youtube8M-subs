00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 hey what's going on donated simon yours 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.609
 muscle maker today is why 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.099
 Tricks how to make the point special 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.900
 my muscle can hold well in the muscle burner 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.120
 workout from five to ten minutes ago 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.549
 I'm still a bit after 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.470
 finish and thought I'll explain myself 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.960
 just once how to do that in hinbekommt 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.420
 very fresh dollars in the 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.859
 keep muscles burning and the whole 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.420
 best, of course, as long as possible 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.340
 after training 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.320
 there are certain things in the chambers 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.779
 I'll come soon 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.700
 but the most important is the base at all 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.040
 it is training in and of itself 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.719
 There are people who are the biggest smashes 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.640
 Banks in the gym just 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:42.149
 through the area work with swing 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.430
 work with dynamic work by chance 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.360
 and there at the end of the pump too 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.250
 random product 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.469
 I'll tell you honestly I'll leave it 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.539
 just do not get to chance 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.340
 I want everything that I create myself 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.379
 also deliberately produced 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.600
 And that is just the point of 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.910
 point is not necessarily the indicator 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.190
 but for muscle growth it is one of the 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.439
 main motivators and heard 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.720
 Just that you just notice 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.909
 hits the target muscles of the target muscle 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.439
 is properly tied up and exactly 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.390
 this is definitely one for me 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.979
 the most important things in the training as well 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.000
 if that would govern the try 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.950
 to talk about the whole thing 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.960
 I'll tell you quite honestly the pump 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.640
 is quite important so what can 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.200
 you do what the training is about 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.909
 me very important all three strains 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.159
 concentrically and symmetrically 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.990
 eccentric, especially on the 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.759
 Isometric eighth just try it 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.439
 at the moment to stop the trade 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.970
 simply tries moment this voltage 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.250
 to hold on you will notice what it is you 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.960
 it brings a huge difference 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.939
 most people completely despise this 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.740
 three types of stress and put that 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.479
 perhaps to a maximum of two 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.399
 but there are three of the numbers allowed 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.149
 Just do not forget that's it 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.890
 leading 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.060
 otherwise you try such a technique 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.979
 from super set use 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.479
 Just try something out when you are 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:54.460
 really in different areas 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:56.290
 but just the antagonistic 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.130
 Training is incredibly easy to cool 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.649
 point to feel 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.820
 to keep the point and there are 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:03.100
 Of course, certain things, too 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.570
 you can take before the training to the 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.369
 simply improve points 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.009
 for me one of the most interesting 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:11.830
 Products in this area is the akg 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.090
 in addition to alfredo bluttat is simply a 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.670
 huge difference between the l 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.810
 arginine in free form and akg who 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.310
 just felt this difference 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.170
 simply has more would it just what 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.330
 the point when the muscle is so 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.890
 really nice turned on 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.690
 and of course the feeling 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.459
 conveys that one is exactly his goal 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.860
 Muscle simply hits the horny easy 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.630
 give it a try there is everything there 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.130
 I do not need to show it now 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.480
 link to this video 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.760
 which, for example, a pretty good one 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.560
 The thing is, the carbs are straight 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.090
 so in the form of strength so not the 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.099
 sugar carbohydrates but just in 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.989
 form of for example potatoes when 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:45.790
 on the eve of such a really nice 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:47.290
 has eaten potatoes has not tasted 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.360
 only excellent you can easily 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.380
 Prepare to cost a few cents 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.330
 It is simply a very big thing 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.430
 cheap product such a beautiful one 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.260
 eaten potatoes on the eve and 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.630
 the following day, there will be a murderer 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.549
 moderate point without potatoes or rice 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.870
 or something like that I get only halfway 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:03.489
 that's pretty good for me 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.500
 important and one with its natural 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:07.180
 things also as a basis as it were 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.980
 work if you have a kg or 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.390
 You can make something like that 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.980
 But you do not have to do that 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.480
 So now I have explained to you again 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.680
 if now 5 had success on the one hand that 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.299
 Training on fluid trainings 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.650
 techniques then especially important 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:19.630
 of course, the normal diet 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.020
 carbohydrates in the form of potatoes for 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.490
 example and the akg just times 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.320
 really cool then still that 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:27.270
 icing on the cake more than that 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.980
 it is not typical for us either 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:32.150
 see you in the next video many greetings 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.150
 your simon
