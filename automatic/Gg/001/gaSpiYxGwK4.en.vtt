00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:05.260

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:06.880
 made rockea and if what we are going 

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:09.340
 to be there because we found in the 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:11.650
 outside of the burger world that out there is 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.600
 a corner where the best are made 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.309
 guayaquil hamburgers that have 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:18.010
 said I still do not know you have already 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:20.830
 tried friend cameraman that the best 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:23.470
 it is very good this camera does not know no 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.000
 convinces others in any case its 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.380
 a little bit of work here because 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.699
 we just came making the promise 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.740
 who had already seen the flours 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:31.649
 flying and all those things and the truth 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:35.879
 that I'm a little bit hungry so 

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:35.879
 can work for food let's go 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.050
 to ask the crisis 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:01:07.540
 so that the hamburger plus super friend 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.310
 cristian who is the manager of this 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.290
 gastronomic moment that you are seeing 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.670
 here it is correct because people are 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.880
 as of all the world the most expensive with a 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.880
 world 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.970
 First of all, try nothing else 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.770
 meat ripe brown salt 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:27.640
 burger cheese sauce or not 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:33.670
 they continue like this I had to manufacture a pair 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:35.170
 many of the drops from the house of the 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.650
 other 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:44.369
 who is so mature 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:47.369
 mature but for Ecuadorians 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.369
 advanced 

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:06.820
 Ecuadorian is more mature than pizza 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.640
 that is the most requested here 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.150
 the process 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:35.590
 perfect of the flesh 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.590
 Y 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:42.900
 and we proceed to put the delicious 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.900
 sauce 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.010
 correct and from there it happens 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.910
 to an explosion in your mouth 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.500
 the idea is precisely that they feel 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.960
 well-identified the flavors do not have 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:10.490
 you arrive and you feel well marked the 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:12.380
 mature like that gave him a little bit like that 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:14.300
 rescue her the idea to start since 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:17.510
 we are talking let's talk a little bit in 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:19.910
 world died with the idea the idea the idea 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.250
 He came out just to make a site 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.780
 of hamburgers that has hamburgers 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.459
 of different nationalities but as 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.200
 a picket and obviously we were not going to 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:29.090
 leave the table outside measuring yourself to see 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.190
 where are we going we all take names from 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.270
 each of the characters 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.250
 corresponding to the country where in 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:36.140
 burgers and it's here let's be other 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.450
 drops and good was the nightingale grandpa 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.980
 For me, each one of the 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.630
 hamburgers from different parts with a 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.000
 picket each one has an agent 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:46.670
 specific do not put the Japanese in the 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.590
 Italian all good you know Italian that 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.480
 we are ar in the savanna and we saw a small 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.459
 and the simple detail let's put the cheese 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.680
 parmesan then for example that has 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:56.930
 enough that supervised the American 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.730
 which is the barbie kit bible that he used but 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.880

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:12.430
 Y 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:14.320
 I still wanted to do this myself 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:17.190
 asked me this one advice for 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.190

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:37.190

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.410

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:44.300

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:46.220
