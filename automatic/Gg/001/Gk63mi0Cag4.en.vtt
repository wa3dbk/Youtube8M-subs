 units of pinganillo a new inductor 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.739
 with integrated microphone extraction bar 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.080
 and extractor magnet to remove the 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:04.440
 Ear plug cable to connect

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.390
 part that we will introduce in the ear 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.740
 As you can see, it's very small, it 's perfect 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.490
 to establish a communication 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:25.250
 Discreet due to its design you do not need 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:28.180
 no type of battery or maintenance 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:31.130
 what makes its minimum size possible 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:34.220
 you can use it with total security 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.530
 since once installed no one will see 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.310
 the little penguin will not hear the 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.860
 conversation 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:43.970
 from outside the mono jean switchboard 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:47.510
 tiny is in charge of managing everything 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:50.810

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:57.140
 inductor ring is responsible for making 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:59.960
 get the signal to the penguin also in 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.450
 he is integrated the microphone what you 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.410
 will allow to install it in a very 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.410

 and listen to the conversation in your ear 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:45.890
 to speak do it through the microphone 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.780
 of the ring in doctor remember the 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.360
 distance with your interlocutor is 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.459
 unlimited since the communication the 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.130
 will establish is through a call 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:58.450
 phone you will be in Madrid and your 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.450
 companion in barcelona 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:03.489
 you also have the option to listen 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.760
 recordings that you have saved in 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:09.340
 any mp3 you just have to connect 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.889
 memorize tiny to your player and 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:14.560
 select the recording you want 

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:19.109
 press to play and you will hear in your ear 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.109
 the dictations that you previously recorded 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:26.260
 The montaigne installation is very 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:29.140
 simple first we must place the 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.330
 ear ring in the ear we place the 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.240
 head horizontally and what 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:36.880
 let's go inside the ear we move 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:39.700
 slightly until we feel like a 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:42.099
 small drop of water 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.680
 if it is not properly placed it will be seen 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:46.900
 from outside in this case 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:50.620
 you must extract it with the extractor bar 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:53.950
 or the magnet and reinsert it until 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:56.769
 I do not see other check 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:04:00.459
 you must do is turn your ear to the 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:03.489
 floor and make sure you do not leave cover 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:05.940
 heard with your hand before performing this 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:09.299
 operation to extract the pinch 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:12.340
 we will use the extractor bar that 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:15.160
 we will introduce in the ear or the magnet 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.690
 extractor that we will approach the exit 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.419
 of the ear 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:21.880
 Also remember that if we use the 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:23.620
 two one one in each ear the 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.240
 audio quality is going to be very much 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.370
 best 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:30.280
 then we put the ring on 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:32.590
 doctor in the neck to camouflage what 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.660
 we can better use a shirt 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:37.090
 previous and paste it with adhesive tape 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:40.210
 we put the microphone in the flap of 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:42.700
 shirt is a microphone 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.380
 high sensitivity to talk to him 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:47.230
 will suffice 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:49.900
 and you will not have to turn your mouth towards 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:52.120
 the microphone we connect the ring in 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:55.630
 doctor to the switchboard by the connector 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:57.550
 loop and connect one end 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:01.090
 of the cable through the connector of the 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:03.700
 centralita inputs last only we 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:08.440
 will be connected to the mobile phone or 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:11.050
 mp3 and camouflage the switchboard good this 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:13.090
 It has been everything I hope you have helped 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:15.370
 better understand how jean works 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:17.890
 tiny but if you still have any doubt 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:22.930
