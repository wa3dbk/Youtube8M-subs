00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:06.930
 what is it like, how good is it? 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.269
 week in the ions bloggers we are going to 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.070
 be Christmas and we are going to tell you 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.200
 of our Christmases of how we the 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.460
 we pass what does the 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.970
 Christmas et cetera 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:20.950
 Well, for me, Christmas used to 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.920
 spend it with my good family I follow it 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:26.470
 doing alone than before when my 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:29.740
 granny mom my dad sometimes 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:33.610
 came to the df to spend Christmas with everyone 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:36.130
 they and he was very father were they 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.170
 Very parents have memories that I 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.910
 pretty no longer lives any of my 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.760
 grandparents live then I think that 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:46.690
 for me for that reason Christmas sometimes 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:49.539
 it becomes a bit nostalgic sometimes what 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:52.030
 bad that this time is like 

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:54.129
 nostalgia and to remember and that is that 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.570
 well in at least in my case it ends 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:58.449
 one 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.969
 calling people who do not or sending 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:04.059
 mails that no no because with all this 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:07.650
 how to close the year in harmony and leave 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:10.390
 back everything ends one sending 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.320
 writing things that I do not good I do not know 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:16.720
 but this year I do not want to do anything 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.190
 good father of this time and you're 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.110
 parties for 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.090
 to those who are like me who are not of the 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.770
 city is that you can is the 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.900
 opportunity to be with your family and 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.630
 live with them to take advantage of the 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.370
 apapachar the and all this that during the 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.350
 year to many it is difficult for us 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:34.510
 do then for me it's like the 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.160
 opportunity to be for a while with 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:39.520
 my mom and with my sister and take advantage of them 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:41.560
 to the maximum and it's also a time like in 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.810
 which for some reason I do not know if for the 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.480
 cold as feelings come to the surface 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.970
 but not in its spiral for those of 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.920
 suddenly they are as cold as me 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.780
 It costs a bit of work to tell you 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.850
 I want and those things because it's like a 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:58.230
 good time to express these 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:01.510
 loved ones, your feelings 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:04.510
 Well, as I see it, Christmas is 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:06.220
 it happens like family and all this but 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.679
 already the new year is already like the party and 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:11.620
 the total chaos not especially in the 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:14.200
 The last years of my life have been and have been 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.810
 been very funny last year and the 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.570
 ancestor I went to playa del carmen 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.750
 good is like a very buna environment and the 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.540
 true not 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:26.810
 loved it so much and this year I'll go to 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.910
 Mazatlan with my kim and from Mazatlan 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.940
 as you all know and then to see how 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.790
 what is going to be very father the subject of 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.480
 the gifts for me is super father 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.760
 obviously I think that for all 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.800
 receiving gifts and giving gifts is also 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.830
 very father and good if they do not have flat 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.510
 money to give many gifts because what 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.120
 what they can do is give gifts made 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.250
 with their own hands that for me have 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.410
 a super-large value and it's something super 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.870
 father and can do so from a 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:57.020
 drawing or if they know how to make cakes or if 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:59.600
 They know how to make bracelets or necklaces or knit 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.760
 a sweater or anything they can 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.620
 do with your hands 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.050
 It is a gift also very father and in the 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.820
 which then do not have to spend me this 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:09.230
 year did not put Christmas tree though I 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.750
 love the whole theme of decoration 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.489
 Christmas and I'm going to show the culprit 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.060
 that he did not put a Christmas tree 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:18.489
 of this year 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:22.300
 marimar because imagine it would be a 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:23.860
 disaster is thus more mischievous than ever 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.370
 there is more tremendous than ever then 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:29.170
 would end the tree and we would end 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.760
 burned down here in my house good them 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.250
 I'm going to say the gifts that I would give 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:38.019
 my aunt david if there was no limit of 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:40.450
 money wow well I said to me that I think 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:44.170
 that would give him a barbie house 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:47.920
 where I could live and with the car of the 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:50.350
 chin if the rosano virus and yet 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.810
 and Barbies and a kit 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:58.330
 makeup so huge and a closet 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:04:01.960
 of wigs ja ja david I think that 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:04.360
 I would give him a beauty salon 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:08.910
 private where they could all be arranged 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.910
 the days the hair and a private spa 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.430
 and I do not know maybe it would lead to that 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.290
 knew lindsay lohan that is like his 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:19.049
 I dream and well now I have to tell you 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:24.630
 my letter to Santa Claus 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:26.550
 I would ask my perfect man because I 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.080
 what I would ask santaclós is that he 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:31.200
 the men who are the 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.790
 miserable all the truth I do not know if 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.650
 I want 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:36.660
 Falling in love again because it gives me a little 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:40.410
 I was very scared 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:42.350
 know all but good if I had to 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:44.620
 Ask Santaclós for a perfect name 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:47.260
 well 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.060
 I believe that the first thing would be that 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:51.970
 was a slob and was not a child of 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:56.590
 bitch like what has touched me 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:59.710
 lately he basically wanted me 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:02.650
 that respected me that I would worry about 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:06.220
 me that was nice with me son them that 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:08.470
 I would ask for a lot of requirements rather 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:10.949
 I ask and that's why I'm alone because good 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:10.949
 ok ah 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:18.010
 and if we talk about physics because you look so much 

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:20.680
 that the ones in Justin Bieber's picture like that 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:23.770
 what exactly and good if it is not like that 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:26.650
 Well, what I like is that they have 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:30.100
 style or have a style of dress 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:33.310
 father and preferably if he has live 

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:36.320
 no visit costumes better and if it's european 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:39.590
 improved Canadian 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:43.850
 this and what else 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:45.230
 and well basically that which has 

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:47.540
 conversation topic that is intelligent 

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:49.970
 that he knows what he wants from life is not 

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:52.010
 I tell them that I do not know if there is 

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:53.780
 perfect man but good if we assume 

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:56.060
 that there is Santa Claus we suppose 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:58.070
 there is the perfect man good
