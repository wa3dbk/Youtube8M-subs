00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
overall score that I'll give at the end

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.360 
overall score that I'll give at the end
of<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.420> video<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:36.960> will<00:00:37.500> first<00:00:37.770> be<00:00:37.920> starting

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
of the video and will first be starting

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.430 
of the video and will first be starting
things<00:00:38.640> off<00:00:38.790> with<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.210> duration<00:00:39.840> this<00:00:40.260> is

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
things off with the duration this is

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.889 
things off with the duration this is
about<00:00:40.800> a<00:00:40.829> forty<00:00:41.399> second<00:00:41.910> ride<00:00:42.149> it<00:00:42.360> is<00:00:42.540> very

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
about a forty second ride it is very

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.110 
about a forty second ride it is very
short<00:00:43.379> of<00:00:43.590> course<00:00:44.070> it<00:00:44.250> is<00:00:44.399> an<00:00:44.550> incomplete

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
short of course it is an incomplete

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.330 
short of course it is an incomplete
circuit<00:00:45.719> so<00:00:45.960> it's<00:00:46.170> no<00:00:46.379> surprise<00:00:46.590> that's<00:00:47.190> a

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
circuit so it's no surprise that's a

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.310 
circuit so it's no surprise that's a
short<00:00:47.579> ride<00:00:47.760> it<00:00:48.000> has<00:00:48.390> that<00:00:48.600> launch<00:00:48.870> it<00:00:49.170> goes

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
short ride it has that launch it goes

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.350 
short ride it has that launch it goes
through<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.649> inverted<00:00:50.190> top<00:00:50.370> hat<00:00:50.610> a<00:00:50.640> wide<00:00:51.000> turn

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
through the inverted top hat a wide turn

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.869 
through the inverted top hat a wide turn
then<00:00:51.870> comes<00:00:52.350> up<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:52.649> spike<00:00:53.010> falls<00:00:53.489> back<00:00:53.699> down

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
then comes up a spike falls back down

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.819 
then comes up a spike falls back down
and<00:00:54.059> does<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.390> whole<00:00:54.539> layout<00:00:54.719> over<00:00:55.230> again<00:00:55.469> so

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
and does the whole layout over again so

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.889 
and does the whole layout over again so
it's<00:00:56.100> getting<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.610> three<00:00:57.000> very<00:00:57.360> short<00:00:57.449> ride

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
it's getting a three very short ride

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.750 
it's getting a three very short ride
however<00:00:58.469> most<00:00:58.649> incomplete<00:00:59.219> circuits<00:00:59.640> are

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
however most incomplete circuits are

giving<00:01:42.750> it<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:42.990> 9<00:01:43.320> it's<00:01:43.680> not<00:01:43.920> perfect<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:45.060> only

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
giving it a 9 it's not perfect the only

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.179 
giving it a 9 it's not perfect the only
thing<00:01:45.450> I<00:01:45.600> would<00:01:45.659> really<00:01:45.990> fix<00:01:46.439> with<00:01:46.740> this<00:01:46.950> is

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
thing I would really fix with this is

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.120 
thing I would really fix with this is
when<00:01:47.939> you're<00:01:48.090> going<00:01:48.329> around<00:01:48.630> that<00:01:49.170> turn<00:01:49.560> right

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
when you're going around that turn right

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.399 
when you're going around that turn right
before<00:01:50.460> you<00:01:50.549> enter<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.060> spike<00:01:51.479> at<00:01:51.720> this<00:01:52.170> point

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
before you enter the spike at this point

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.109 
before you enter the spike at this point
you're<00:01:52.590> going<00:01:52.770> backwards<00:01:53.399> it<00:01:53.520> does<00:01:53.700> kind<00:01:54.000> of

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
you're going backwards it does kind of

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.389 
you're going backwards it does kind of
jerk<00:01:54.420> you<00:01:54.600> into<00:01:54.840> that<00:01:54.960> overbank<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.680> little<00:01:56.219> bit

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
jerk you into that overbank a little bit

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.969 
jerk you into that overbank a little bit
however<00:01:56.820> it's<00:01:57.210> not<00:01:57.450> that<00:01:57.509> bad<00:01:58.200> however<00:01:58.649> that's

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
however it's not that bad however that's

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.230 
however it's not that bad however that's
really<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.399> only<00:01:59.670> reason<00:02:00.000> why<00:02:00.119> I'm<00:02:00.210> not

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
really the only reason why I'm not

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.810 
really the only reason why I'm not
giving<00:02:00.899> it<00:02:01.020> a<00:02:01.140> perfect<00:02:01.409> 10<00:02:01.860> now<00:02:02.280> we're<00:02:02.430> talking

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
giving it a perfect 10 now we're talking

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.359 
giving it a perfect 10 now we're talking
about<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:03.450> drop<00:02:03.840> now<00:02:04.380> a<00:02:04.409> couple<00:02:04.890> years<00:02:05.189> ago

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
about the drop now a couple years ago

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.370 
about the drop now a couple years ago
for<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:05.969> drop<00:02:06.240> you<00:02:06.479> would<00:02:06.630> have<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:06.930> face<00:02:07.110> that

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
for the drop you would have to face that

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.559 
for the drop you would have to face that
drop<00:02:07.710> backwards<00:02:08.489> because<00:02:08.759> they<00:02:09.090> had<00:02:09.300> you

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
drop backwards because they had you

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.260 
drop backwards because they had you
launched<00:02:09.840> forwards<00:02:10.590> however<00:02:11.430> a<00:02:11.790> couple<00:02:12.090> of

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
launched forwards however a couple of

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.670 
launched forwards however a couple of
years<00:02:12.420> ago<00:02:12.629> Six<00:02:13.050> Flags<00:02:13.170> made<00:02:13.470> some

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
years ago Six Flags made some

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.210 
years ago Six Flags made some
modifications

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
modifications

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.400 
modifications
nations<00:02:14.490> and<00:02:14.700> now<00:02:14.820> it<00:02:15.030> is<00:02:15.180> mr.<00:02:15.570> Frese<00:02:15.870> reverse

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
nations and now it is mr. Frese reverse

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.460 
nations and now it is mr. Frese reverse
blast<00:02:16.890> so<00:02:17.640> you<00:02:17.700> face<00:02:18.210> that<00:02:18.480> 90<00:02:18.840> degree<00:02:18.990> drop

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
blast so you face that 90 degree drop

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.680 
blast so you face that 90 degree drop
face<00:02:19.980> forward<00:02:20.610> if<00:02:20.790> you're<00:02:21.150> in<00:02:21.240> the<00:02:21.330> back<00:02:21.510> of

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
face forward if you're in the back of

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.540 
face forward if you're in the back of
the<00:02:21.810> Train<00:02:22.080> naturally<00:02:22.860> you<00:02:23.010> have<00:02:23.040> a<00:02:23.190> bigger

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
the Train naturally you have a bigger

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.310 
the Train naturally you have a bigger
drop<00:02:23.940> and<00:02:24.390> if<00:02:24.480> you're<00:02:24.690> in<00:02:24.780> the<00:02:24.840> front<00:02:25.110> of<00:02:25.200> the

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
drop and if you're in the front of the

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.590 
drop and if you're in the front of the
Train<00:02:25.680> then<00:02:26.250> you<00:02:26.400> get<00:02:26.580> a<00:02:26.610> better<00:02:26.850> view<00:02:27.240> however

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
Train then you get a better view however

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.990 
Train then you get a better view however
the<00:02:27.930> drop<00:02:28.170> isn't<00:02:28.500> as<00:02:28.590> big<00:02:28.860> it's<00:02:29.130> a<00:02:29.430> very<00:02:29.610> fun

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
the drop isn't as big it's a very fun

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.970 
the drop isn't as big it's a very fun
drop<00:02:30.300> I'm<00:02:30.480> giving<00:02:30.840> it<00:02:30.960> an<00:02:31.050> 8<00:02:31.230> you<00:02:31.440> experience

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
drop I'm giving it an 8 you experience

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.310 
drop I'm giving it an 8 you experience
lots<00:02:32.310> of<00:02:32.550> weightlessness<00:02:33.150> next<00:02:34.020> up<00:02:34.110> is<00:02:34.200> the

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
lots of weightlessness next up is the

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.110 
lots of weightlessness next up is the
launch<00:02:34.500> category<00:02:35.070> and<00:02:35.340> I<00:02:35.490> talked<00:02:35.730> a<00:02:35.850> little

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
launch category and I talked a little

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.540 
launch category and I talked a little
bit<00:02:36.360> about<00:02:36.660> this<00:02:36.930> earlier<00:02:37.200> now<00:02:37.950> naturally

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
bit about this earlier now naturally

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.370 
bit about this earlier now naturally
this<00:02:38.730> is<00:02:38.880> a<00:02:38.910> backwards<00:02:39.660> launching<00:02:40.080> coaster

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
this is a backwards launching coaster

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.140 
this is a backwards launching coaster
which<00:02:40.530> means<00:02:40.740> if<00:02:40.920> you<00:02:41.100> sit<00:02:41.340> in<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:41.580> last<00:02:41.850> row

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
which means if you sit in the last row

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.690 
which means if you sit in the last row
that<00:02:42.570> you<00:02:43.020> are<00:02:43.080> essentially<00:02:43.620> now<00:02:43.920> the<00:02:43.980> head<00:02:44.460> of

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
that you are essentially now the head of

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.850 
that you are essentially now the head of
the<00:02:44.880> train<00:02:45.210> for<00:02:45.510> the<00:02:45.600> launch<00:02:45.810> and<00:02:46.140> being<00:02:46.680> at<00:02:46.830> a

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
the train for the launch and being at a

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.800 
the train for the launch and being at a
backwards<00:02:47.340> launch<00:02:47.580> is<00:02:47.880> a<00:02:47.910> very<00:02:48.390> unique

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
backwards launch is a very unique

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.000 
backwards launch is a very unique
experience<00:02:49.020> there<00:02:49.620> aren't<00:02:49.770> too<00:02:49.980> many

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
experience there aren't too many

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.800 
experience there aren't too many
coasters<00:02:50.760> out<00:02:50.970> there<00:02:51.180> that<00:02:51.360> launch<00:02:51.600> you

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
coasters out there that launch you

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:52.430 
coasters out there that launch you
backwards

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
backwards

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.280 
backwards
especially<00:02:53.310> 0<00:02:53.640> to<00:02:53.820> 70<00:02:54.180> miles<00:02:54.360> per<00:02:54.510> hour<00:02:54.690> it's

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
especially 0 to 70 miles per hour it's

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.650 
especially 0 to 70 miles per hour it's
very<00:02:55.620> fast<00:02:56.010> it's<00:02:56.340> very<00:02:56.430> powerful<00:02:57.300> and<00:02:57.540> it's

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
very fast it's very powerful and it's

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.530 
very fast it's very powerful and it's
very<00:02:57.930> intense<00:02:58.350> I'm<00:02:58.650> giving<00:02:58.980> it<00:02:59.130> a<00:02:59.280> 9<00:02:59.670> now<00:03:00.390> we're

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
very intense I'm giving it a 9 now we're

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.810 
very intense I'm giving it a 9 now we're
moving<00:03:00.720> on<00:03:00.990> to<00:03:01.020> the<00:03:01.200> intensity<00:03:01.920> level<00:03:02.459> this

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
moving on to the intensity level this

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.240 
moving on to the intensity level this
coaster<00:03:03.209> is<00:03:03.390> somewhat<00:03:03.840> intense<00:03:04.290> however<00:03:05.040> it's

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
coaster is somewhat intense however it's

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.850 
coaster is somewhat intense however it's
more<00:03:05.520> fun<00:03:06.120> it's<00:03:06.510> very<00:03:06.810> enjoyable<00:03:07.350> and<00:03:07.770> you

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
more fun it's very enjoyable and you

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.890 
more fun it's very enjoyable and you
aren't<00:03:08.100> feeling<00:03:08.280> the<00:03:08.520> G's<00:03:08.970> as<00:03:09.240> much<00:03:09.510> during

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
aren't feeling the G's as much during

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.050 
aren't feeling the G's as much during
some<00:03:10.170> portions<00:03:10.650> of<00:03:10.770> the<00:03:10.830> ride<00:03:11.130> as<00:03:11.430> you<00:03:11.459> are<00:03:11.790> in

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
some portions of the ride as you are in

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.970 
some portions of the ride as you are in
others<00:03:12.510> definitely<00:03:13.110> the<00:03:13.440> most<00:03:13.560> intense

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
others definitely the most intense

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.070 
others definitely the most intense
portions<00:03:14.490> of<00:03:14.640> this<00:03:14.790> coaster<00:03:15.300> are<00:03:15.480> during<00:03:16.050> the

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
portions of this coaster are during the

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.930 
portions of this coaster are during the
launch<00:03:16.500> and<00:03:16.890> when<00:03:17.370> you're<00:03:17.520> going<00:03:17.670> through

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
launch and when you're going through

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.270 
launch and when you're going through
that<00:03:18.060> inverted<00:03:18.630> top<00:03:18.870> hat<00:03:19.140> element<00:03:19.590> I'd<00:03:20.010> say

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
that inverted top hat element I'd say

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.530 
that inverted top hat element I'd say
that<00:03:20.459> the<00:03:20.580> rest<00:03:20.820> of<00:03:20.940> the<00:03:21.060> elements<00:03:21.120> are<00:03:21.510> just

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
that the rest of the elements are just

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.259 
that the rest of the elements are just
fun<00:03:22.140> and<00:03:22.170> not<00:03:22.739> meant<00:03:23.160> to<00:03:23.250> be<00:03:23.370> intense<00:03:23.850> this

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
fun and not meant to be intense this

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.210 
fun and not meant to be intense this
coaster<00:03:24.630> is<00:03:24.690> receiving<00:03:25.260> a<00:03:25.410> seven<00:03:25.860> and<00:03:26.010> that's

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
coaster is receiving a seven and that's

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.580 
coaster is receiving a seven and that's
not<00:03:26.370> a<00:03:26.430> bad<00:03:26.730> thing<00:03:26.790> either<00:03:27.360> a<00:03:27.720> coaster<00:03:28.290> doesn't

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
not a bad thing either a coaster doesn't

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.470 
not a bad thing either a coaster doesn't
have<00:03:28.739> to<00:03:28.890> be<00:03:29.010> intense<00:03:29.580> throughout<00:03:29.970> the<00:03:30.120> entire

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
have to be intense throughout the entire

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.479 
have to be intense throughout the entire
ride<00:03:30.810> and<00:03:31.140> even<00:03:31.709> when<00:03:31.860> a<00:03:31.890> coaster<00:03:32.280> isn't

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
ride and even when a coaster isn't

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.430 
ride and even when a coaster isn't
intense<00:03:33.060> that's<00:03:33.300> fine<00:03:33.600> a<00:03:33.630> coaster<00:03:34.110> doesn't

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
intense that's fine a coaster doesn't

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.199 
intense that's fine a coaster doesn't
have<00:03:34.560> to<00:03:34.680> be<00:03:34.769> intense<00:03:35.190> to<00:03:35.489> be<00:03:35.640> great

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
have to be intense to be great

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.900 
have to be intense to be great
next<00:03:36.720> is<00:03:36.840> the<00:03:36.989> inversions<00:03:37.800> now<00:03:38.370> this<00:03:38.580> coaster

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
next is the inversions now this coaster

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.640 
next is the inversions now this coaster
does<00:03:39.150> go<00:03:39.390> upside<00:03:39.660> down<00:03:39.690> twice

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
does go upside down twice

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.680 
does go upside down twice
however<00:03:41.070> only<00:03:41.340> has<00:03:41.519> that<00:03:41.730> one<00:03:42.000> inversion

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
however only has that one inversion

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.750 
however only has that one inversion
which<00:03:42.870> is<00:03:43.019> the<00:03:43.170> inverted<00:03:43.560> top<00:03:43.890> hat<00:03:44.130> you<00:03:44.549> go

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
which is the inverted top hat you go

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.400 
which is the inverted top hat you go
through<00:03:45.060> the<00:03:45.180> element<00:03:45.570> twice<00:03:45.780> and<00:03:46.080> I'd<00:03:46.170> say

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
through the element twice and I'd say

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.620 
through the element twice and I'd say
that<00:03:46.440> is<00:03:46.739> very<00:03:47.070> enjoyable<00:03:47.400> this<00:03:48.239> is<00:03:48.390> one<00:03:48.600> of

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
that is very enjoyable this is one of

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.990 
that is very enjoyable this is one of
the<00:03:48.870> few<00:03:49.140> inverted<00:03:49.739> top<00:03:49.950> hats<00:03:50.190> out<00:03:50.370> there<00:03:50.760> and

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
the few inverted top hats out there and

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.420 
the few inverted top hats out there and
it's<00:03:51.150> very<00:03:51.420> fun<00:03:51.720> judging<00:03:52.380> it<00:03:52.500> based<00:03:52.769> purely

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
it's very fun judging it based purely

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.460 
it's very fun judging it based purely
off<00:03:53.580> of<00:03:53.760> that<00:03:53.940> element<00:03:54.239> I'm<00:03:54.540> giving<00:03:54.930> it<00:03:55.049> a<00:03:55.140> 9

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
off of that element I'm giving it a 9

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.710 
off of that element I'm giving it a 9
and<00:03:55.830> the<00:03:56.280> final<00:03:56.610> category<00:03:56.760> before<00:03:57.269> the

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720

and that is going to give this coaster a
7<00:04:23.520> it's<00:04:24.030> not<00:04:24.240> crazy<00:04:24.690> detailed<00:04:25.470> theming

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
probably my second favorite coaster at

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.800 
probably my second favorite coaster at
the<00:04:46.830> park<00:04:47.069> I<00:04:47.219> like<00:04:47.610> it<00:04:47.759> more<00:04:47.969> than<00:04:48.150> Titan<00:04:48.569> but

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 
the park I like it more than Titan but

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:50.869 
the park I like it more than Titan but
not<00:04:48.990> as<00:04:49.139> much<00:04:49.349> as<00:04:49.560> the<00:04:49.680> new<00:04:49.860> Texas<00:04:50.219> giant<00:04:50.280> it's

00:04:50.869 --> 00:04:50.879 
not as much as the new Texas giant it's

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:53.119 
not as much as the new Texas giant it's
a<00:04:51.000> very<00:04:51.240> short<00:04:51.659> ride<00:04:51.870> however<00:04:52.199> it<00:04:52.530> packs<00:04:52.860> a<00:04:53.099> lot

00:04:53.119 --> 00:04:53.129 
a very short ride however it packs a lot
