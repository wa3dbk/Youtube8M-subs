the ability to tune dial this in what
does<00:01:07.350> this<00:01:07.470> mean<00:01:07.740> you<00:01:07.950> add<00:01:08.100> new<00:01:08.310> pipes<00:01:08.610> you<00:01:09.000> add

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
does this mean you add new pipes you add

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.630 
does this mean you add new pipes you add
a<00:01:09.479> high<00:01:10.229> performance<00:01:10.770> exhaust<00:01:11.310> high

a high performance exhaust high
performance<00:01:12.119> air<00:01:12.270> intake<00:01:12.350> you<00:01:13.350> may<00:01:13.500> find

performance air intake you may find

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.260 
performance air intake you may find
yourself<00:01:14.130> now<00:01:14.310> running<00:01:14.790> a<00:01:14.880> lean<00:01:15.119> condition

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
yourself now running a lean condition

yourself now running a lean condition
typically<00:01:16.400> victory<00:01:17.400> sends<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.909> stock<00:01:18.720> bikes

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
typically victory sends the stock bikes

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.620 
typically victory sends the stock bikes
out<00:01:19.650> of<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.860> factory<00:01:20.310> a<00:01:20.520> running<00:01:21.180> lean<00:01:21.330> this

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
out of the factory a running lean this

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.060 
out of the factory a running lean this
is<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:21.900> meet<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.640> draconian<00:01:23.640> government<00:01:24.210> EPA

is to meet the draconian government EPA
environment<00:01:26.070> restrictions<00:01:26.850> so<00:01:27.090> they<00:01:27.210> don't

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
environment restrictions so they don't

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.510 
environment restrictions so they don't
pollute<00:01:27.630> so<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.380> pipes<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:29.159> bike<00:01:29.340> in

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
pollute so the pipes the bike in

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.980 
pollute so the pipes the bike in
themselves<00:01:29.909> are<00:01:30.119> naturally<00:01:31.369> running<00:01:32.659> in<00:01:33.659> a

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
lean condition you can always just get

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.840 
lean condition you can always just get
your<00:01:36.659> new<00:01:36.780> bike<00:01:36.960> pop<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.040> plugs<00:01:38.280> out<00:01:38.460> you're

your new bike pop the plugs out you're
going<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.030> typically<00:01:39.630> find<00:01:39.869> that<00:01:39.990> you're

they're not gonna be rich um that's my

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.609 
they're not gonna be rich um that's my
experience<00:01:48.630> that's<00:01:48.840> what<00:01:48.990> that's<00:01:49.350> what<00:01:49.470> we've

seen that's what we typically see with

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.069 
seen that's what we typically see with
all<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.210> bikes<00:01:51.390> we've<00:01:51.570> come<00:01:51.780> through<00:01:51.810> from

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
all the bikes we've come through from

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.240 
all the bikes we've come through from
the<00:01:52.170> victories<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:52.530> our<00:01:52.710> own<00:01:52.829> personal

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
the victories and our own personal

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.209 
the victories and our own personal
victories<00:01:54.530> so<00:01:55.530> if<00:01:55.710> you're<00:01:55.860> going<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.040> upgrade

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
victories so if you're going to upgrade

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.149 
victories so if you're going to upgrade
your<00:01:56.610> but<00:01:56.759> victory<00:01:57.149> and<00:01:57.840> you're<00:01:58.829> going<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:59.009> add

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
your but victory and you're going to add

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.160 
your but victory and you're going to add
all<00:01:59.189> this<00:01:59.430> performance<00:02:00.060> stuff<00:02:00.240> you're<00:02:01.020> going

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
all this performance stuff you're going

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.840 
all this performance stuff you're going
to<00:02:01.229> definitely<00:02:01.939> possibly<00:02:02.939> run<00:02:04.369> more<00:02:05.369> lean<00:02:05.640> and

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
to definitely possibly run more lean and

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.550 
to definitely possibly run more lean and
you<00:02:06.420> don't<00:02:06.540> want<00:02:06.659> to<00:02:06.719> run<00:02:06.810> too<00:02:06.990> lean<00:02:07.229> because

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
you don't want to run too lean because

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.350

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
running lean the VFC is the best thing

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.920

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.500 
take this install it you know and then
go<00:03:13.500> to<00:03:13.560> a<00:03:13.740> dyno<00:03:14.430> and<00:03:14.760> you<00:03:15.120> have<00:03:15.330> the<00:03:15.450> ability

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
go to a dyno and you have the ability

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.900 
go to a dyno and you have the ability
while<00:03:15.990> you're<00:03:16.200> dialing<00:03:16.590> the<00:03:16.650> bike<00:03:16.830> to<00:03:17.490> set

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
while you're dialing the bike to set

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.660 
while you're dialing the bike to set
your<00:03:18.060> mode<00:03:18.320> increment<00:03:19.320> decrement<00:03:19.920> all<00:03:20.370> the

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
your mode increment decrement all the

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:21.980 
your mode increment decrement all the
stuff<00:03:20.910> through<00:03:21.120> these<00:03:21.300> push<00:03:21.510> buttons<00:03:21.540> and

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:21.990 
stuff through these push buttons and

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:26.510 
stuff through these push buttons and
basically<00:03:22.380> what<00:03:22.620> I<00:03:22.650> do<00:03:22.770> is<00:03:25.160> when<00:03:26.160> you<00:03:26.250> install

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 
basically what I do is when you install

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.730 
basically what I do is when you install
this<00:03:26.760> just<00:03:27.030> stick<00:03:27.630> it<00:03:27.720> under<00:03:27.900> your<00:03:27.930> side<00:03:28.260> panel

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:28.740 
this just stick it under your side panel

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:30.830 
this just stick it under your side panel
next<00:03:29.340> to<00:03:29.400> the<00:03:29.520> seat<00:03:29.760> and<00:03:29.940> with<00:03:30.570> the<00:03:30.660> velcro

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
next to the seat and with the velcro

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.199 
next to the seat and with the velcro
attached<00:03:31.320> to<00:03:31.590> the<00:03:31.800> side<00:03:32.280> of<00:03:32.459> the<00:03:32.580> fuse<00:03:32.820> box<00:03:33.000> so

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
attached to the side of the fuse box so

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:34.490 
attached to the side of the fuse box so
it's<00:03:33.420> successful<00:03:33.840> you<00:03:33.930> just<00:03:33.959> pop<00:03:34.200> off<00:03:34.380> the

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
it's successful you just pop off the

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:29.020

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:30.870 
kingpin we can probably just run through
and<00:07:29.139> show<00:07:29.289> you<00:07:29.350> but<00:07:29.590> this<00:07:30.280> should<00:07:30.490> be<00:07:30.610> enough

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:30.880 
and show you but this should be enough

plugs no splicing stuff like that just
plug-and-play<00:07:39.820> hooking<00:07:40.360> BAM<00:07:40.930> simple<00:07:41.680> as<00:07:41.740> that

00:07:41.909 --> 00:07:41.919 
plug-and-play hooking BAM simple as that

00:07:41.919 --> 00:07:45.090
