which<00:04:04.739> one<00:04:05.040> is<00:04:05.280> the<00:04:05.549> Brazilian<00:04:06.060> hair<00:04:06.329> and

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
which one is the Brazilian hair and

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.150 
which one is the Brazilian hair and

which one is the Peruvian hair for
instance<00:04:08.250> so<00:04:09.239> I<00:04:09.540> guess<00:04:09.930> as<00:04:10.109> time<00:04:10.350> goes<00:04:10.560> along

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
instance so I guess as time goes along

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.860 
instance so I guess as time goes along
they'll<00:04:11.190> probably<00:04:11.459> be<00:04:11.760> able<00:04:11.880> to<00:04:12.030> they'll

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
they'll probably be able to they'll

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.050

probably<00:04:13.079> be<00:04:13.319> able<00:04:13.410> to<00:04:13.680> UM<00:04:13.859> share<00:04:14.819> themselves

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
probably be able to UM share themselves

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.840 
probably be able to UM share themselves
a<00:04:15.389> bit<00:04:15.540> more<00:04:15.780> that<00:04:16.709> makes<00:04:16.950> sense<00:04:17.220> but<00:04:17.639> yeah

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
a bit more that makes sense but yeah

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.180
