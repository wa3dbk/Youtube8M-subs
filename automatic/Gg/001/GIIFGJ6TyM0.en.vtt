D&amp;D<00:00:05.220> at<00:00:05.400> dawn<00:00:05.730> I<00:00:06.180> wish<00:00:06.540> we<00:00:06.779> would<00:00:06.870> have<00:00:06.930> focused

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
D&amp;D at dawn I wish we would have focused

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.470 
D&amp;D at dawn I wish we would have focused
a<00:00:07.560> little<00:00:07.740> more<00:00:07.890> on<00:00:08.040> his<00:00:08.400> death<00:00:08.639> and<00:00:08.940> a<00:00:09.000> funeral

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
a little more on his death and a funeral

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.000 
a little more on his death and a funeral
or<00:00:09.630> something<00:00:09.660> but<00:00:10.290> I<00:00:10.320> think<00:00:10.410> to<00:00:10.740> show

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
or something but I think to show

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.249 
or something but I think to show
Watchers<00:00:11.460> Berenstain<00:00:12.090> isn't<00:00:12.540> as<00:00:12.690> important

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
Watchers Berenstain isn't as important

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.230 
Watchers Berenstain isn't as important

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
as he is to book readers so they kind of

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.269 
as he is to book readers so they kind of
were<00:00:15.360> like<00:00:15.389> and<00:00:15.780> I<00:00:15.960> like<00:00:16.350> Daenerys<00:00:16.740> jumping

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
definitely different in the show versus

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.439 
definitely different in the show versus
the<00:00:25.680> book<00:00:25.859> for<00:00:26.099> Daenerys<00:00:26.460> and<00:00:26.789> marine<00:00:27.119> the

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
the book for Daenerys and marine the

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.540 
the book for Daenerys and marine the
Great<00:00:27.660> Houses<00:00:27.930> are<00:00:28.289> using<00:00:28.740> Daenerys<00:00:29.189> to<00:00:29.369> get

controlled<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.119> city<00:00:30.390> in<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:31.019> book<00:00:31.230> and

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
controlled the city in the book and

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.229 
controlled the city in the book and
she's<00:00:31.679> basically<00:00:31.920> just<00:00:32.279> seems<00:00:32.640> like<00:00:32.850> a<00:00:32.880> pawn

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
she's basically just seems like a pawn

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.260 
she's basically just seems like a pawn
in<00:00:33.660> their<00:00:33.780> games<00:00:34.079> show<00:00:35.040> Daenerys<00:00:35.610> is<00:00:35.640> handling

being<00:01:20.220> foiled<00:01:20.520> by<00:01:20.909> ska<00:01:21.540> has<00:01:21.780> in<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.530> show<00:01:22.740> but

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
being foiled by ska has in the show but

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.410 
being foiled by ska has in the show but
I<00:01:23.159> think<00:01:23.549> they're<00:01:23.729> trying<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:24.090> streamline

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
I think they're trying to streamline

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.749 
I think they're trying to streamline
murine<00:01:24.990> as<00:01:25.229> much<00:01:25.500> as<00:01:25.680> possible<00:01:25.950> because<00:01:26.460> they

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
murine as much as possible because they

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.789 
murine as much as possible because they
just<00:01:26.909> have<00:01:27.240> so<00:01:27.600> much<00:01:27.780> they<00:01:28.229> have<00:01:28.439> planned

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
just have so much they have planned

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.130 
just have so much they have planned
going<00:01:29.130> on<00:01:29.280> I<00:01:29.310> think<00:01:29.520> at<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.299> wall<00:01:30.509> could<00:01:30.960> we

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
going on I think at the wall could we

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.590 
going on I think at the wall could we
have<00:01:31.320> been<00:01:31.350> more<00:01:31.860> obvious<00:01:32.430> with<00:01:32.640> aim<00:01:32.939> on<00:01:33.150> Sam

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
have been more obvious with aim on Sam

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.050 
have been more obvious with aim on Sam
in<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.079> John<00:01:34.290> scene<00:01:34.650> a<00:01:34.890> Targaryen<00:01:35.460> alone<00:01:35.729> in

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
in the John scene a Targaryen alone in

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.149 
in the John scene a Targaryen alone in
the<00:01:36.150> world<00:01:36.390> is<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:36.659> terrible<00:01:37.140> thing<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.740> then

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
the world is a terrible thing and then

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.060 
the world is a terrible thing and then

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
helping wildlings who butchered their

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.790 
helping wildlings who butchered their
people<00:03:21.030> so<00:03:21.600> they're<00:03:21.840> gonna<00:03:21.930> off<00:03:22.200> John<00:03:22.560> for

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
people so they're gonna off John for

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.740 
people so they're gonna off John for
that<00:03:22.830> the<00:03:23.519> environment<00:03:24.209> and<00:03:24.300> the<00:03:24.390> things<00:03:24.630> that

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
that the environment and the things that

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.870 
that the environment and the things that
led<00:03:25.080> up<00:03:25.290> to<00:03:25.320> the<00:03:25.500> stabbing<00:03:25.680> of<00:03:26.100> John<00:03:26.340> is<00:03:26.610> just

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
led up to the stabbing of John is just

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.210 
led up to the stabbing of John is just
so<00:03:27.269> different<00:03:27.720> in<00:03:28.019> the<00:03:28.050> show<00:03:28.350> John<00:03:28.860> really

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
so different in the show John really

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.340 
so different in the show John really
seems<00:03:29.489> like<00:03:29.700> the<00:03:29.850> hero<00:03:30.150> in<00:03:30.480> the<00:03:30.570> show<00:03:30.780> and<00:03:31.110> that

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
seems like the hero in the show and that

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.110 
seems like the hero in the show and that
his<00:03:31.590> people<00:03:31.860> that<00:03:32.160> are<00:03:32.280> going<00:03:32.400> to<00:03:32.580> stab<00:03:32.850> him

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
his people that are going to stab him

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.610 
his people that are going to stab him
are<00:03:33.269> just<00:03:33.330> unhappy<00:03:33.959> because<00:03:34.110> he's<00:03:34.440> helping

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
are just unhappy because he's helping

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.560 
are just unhappy because he's helping
other<00:03:34.980> people<00:03:35.070> but<00:03:35.730> again<00:03:36.000> I<00:03:36.209> think<00:03:36.269> this<00:03:36.510> is

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
other people but again I think this is

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.390 
other people but again I think this is
all<00:03:36.810> about<00:03:37.019> streamlining<00:03:37.410> things<00:03:37.920> and<00:03:38.250> not

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
all about streamlining things and not

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.370 
all about streamlining things and not
over<00:03:38.700> complicating<00:03:39.420> them<00:03:39.570> ten<00:03:39.930> episodes

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
over complicating them ten episodes

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:41.810 
over complicating them ten episodes
isn't<00:03:40.739> enough<00:03:40.980> to<00:03:41.190> go<00:03:41.310> through<00:03:41.489> all<00:03:41.670> this

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
isn't enough to go through all this

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.300 
isn't enough to go through all this
stuff<00:03:41.880> and<00:03:42.390> it<00:03:42.989> would<00:03:43.110> most<00:03:43.320> likely<00:03:43.590> just<00:03:43.890> bog

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
stuff and it would most likely just bog

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.940 
stuff and it would most likely just bog
the<00:03:44.640> show<00:03:44.880> down<00:03:45.180> I<00:03:45.540> did<00:03:46.049> love<00:03:46.260> Stannis<00:03:46.769> the

to bring back like the Lord of Light or

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:32.650 
to bring back like the Lord of Light or
the<00:04:30.289> chosen<00:04:30.710> one<00:04:30.889> and<00:04:31.190> instead<00:04:31.940> of<00:04:32.000> Stannis

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
the chosen one and instead of Stannis

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.540 
the chosen one and instead of Stannis
being<00:04:32.870> resurrected<00:04:33.110> it's<00:04:33.830> John<00:04:34.190> instead

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
being resurrected it's John instead

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.060 
being resurrected it's John instead
