00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
strong structure that is a lot more

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.189 
strong structure that is a lot more
affordable<00:00:48.090> than<00:00:48.449> carbon<00:00:48.750> fiber<00:00:48.930> which<00:00:49.170> is

00:00:49.189 --> 00:00:49.199 
affordable than carbon fiber which is

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:51.709 
affordable than carbon fiber which is
very<00:00:49.530> nice<00:00:49.739> that<00:00:50.699> said<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.180> boat<00:00:51.300> does<00:00:51.510> use

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
very nice that said the boat does use

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.369 
very nice that said the boat does use
carbon<00:00:52.140> fiber<00:00:52.350> on<00:00:52.680> its<00:00:52.980> mast<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:53.699> on<00:00:54.030> its

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 
carbon fiber on its mast and on its

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:57.830 
carbon fiber on its mast and on its
sprit<00:00:55.379> pulp<00:00:55.590> rod<00:00:56.120> so<00:00:57.120> they<00:00:57.239> are<00:00:57.359> eliminating

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
sprit pulp rod so they are eliminating

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.270 
sprit pulp rod so they are eliminating
weight<00:00:57.989> when<00:00:58.170> necessary<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:58.829> where<00:00:58.980> needed

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
weight when necessary and where needed

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.919 
weight when necessary and where needed
I'd<00:00:59.789> also<00:00:59.969> use<00:01:00.210> this<00:01:00.359> carpet<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:00.719> quite

00:01:00.919 --> 00:01:00.929 
I'd also use this carpet and quite

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:03.169 
I'd also use this carpet and quite
intelligently<00:01:01.500> on<00:01:01.910> lifelines<00:01:02.910> and

00:01:03.169 --> 00:01:03.179 
intelligently on lifelines and

00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:04.850 
intelligently on lifelines and
throughout<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.629> cockpit<00:01:03.989> different<00:01:04.500> braces

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
throughout the cockpit different braces

throughout the cockpit different braces
and<00:01:05.009> foot<00:01:05.549> positions<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.180> things<00:01:06.330> like<00:01:06.450> that

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
and foot positions and things like that

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.810 
and foot positions and things like that
as<00:01:07.680> you<00:01:07.799> can<00:01:07.920> see<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.159> boat<00:01:08.310> uses<00:01:08.670> dual

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
as you can see the boat uses dual

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.640 
as you can see the boat uses dual

right here and really quite nice central
pod<00:01:17.250> control<00:01:18.000> station<00:01:18.420> where<00:01:18.570> a<00:01:18.600> lot<00:01:19.200> of<00:01:19.229> your

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
pod control station where a lot of your

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.080 
pod control station where a lot of your
critical<00:01:20.250> running<00:01:20.520> rigging<00:01:20.670> is<00:01:20.880> brought

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
critical running rigging is brought

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.890 
critical running rigging is brought
right<00:01:21.119> back<00:01:21.420> there

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
right back there

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.840 
right back there
you<00:01:22.350> might<00:01:22.500> notice<00:01:22.650> here<00:01:23.100> this<00:01:23.549> is<00:01:23.610> the

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
you might notice here this is the

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.429 
you might notice here this is the
blow-off<00:01:24.060> for<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.659> boom<00:01:24.810> bang<00:01:25.049> so<00:01:25.320> if<00:01:25.380> you

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
blow-off for the boom bang so if you

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.050 
blow-off for the boom bang so if you
need<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:25.680> dump<00:01:25.860> pressure<00:01:26.100> fast<00:01:26.369> can<00:01:26.700> easily<00:01:26.939> be

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
need to dump pressure fast can easily be

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.020 
need to dump pressure fast can easily be
done<00:01:28.100> moving<00:01:29.100> forward<00:01:29.520> on<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.700> boat

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
done moving forward on the boat

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.210 
done moving forward on the boat
you've<00:01:30.149> got<00:01:30.470> hydraulics<00:01:31.470> which<00:01:31.619> control<00:01:32.009> both

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
you've got hydraulics which control both

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.980 
you've got hydraulics which control both
the<00:01:32.250> mast<00:01:32.549> jack<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.360> hydraulic<00:01:33.780> force

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
the mast jack and the hydraulic force

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.200 
the mast jack and the hydraulic force
day<00:01:34.170> so<00:01:34.710> you<00:01:34.770> can<00:01:34.860> put<00:01:35.159> pressure<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:35.549> just

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
day so you can put pressure and just

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.060 
day so you can put pressure and just
make<00:01:36.540> adjustments<00:01:37.020> as<00:01:37.110> needed<00:01:37.229> while<00:01:37.860> this

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
make adjustments as needed while this

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.260 
make adjustments as needed while this

appreciate the most on it is the

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.880 
appreciate the most on it is the
adjustable<00:01:42.570> jib<00:01:43.049> tracks<00:01:43.350> that<00:01:43.560> are<00:01:43.649> attached

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
adjustable jib tracks that are attached

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.620

to<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.159> hull<00:01:44.310> liner<00:01:44.520> right<00:01:44.729> there<00:01:44.939> you<00:01:45.479> have<00:01:45.600> a

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
to the hull liner right there you have a

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.780 
to the hull liner right there you have a
short<00:01:45.990> ship<00:01:46.170> control<00:01:46.500> as<00:01:46.770> well<00:01:47.100> as<00:01:47.130> vertical

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
short ship control as well as vertical

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.120 
short ship control as well as vertical
control<00:01:48.060> on<00:01:48.329> on<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:49.049> leads<00:01:49.380> so<00:01:49.649> you<00:01:50.009> can

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
control on on the leads so you can

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.830 
control on on the leads so you can
really<00:01:50.310> dial<00:01:50.460> in<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:51.030> exact<00:01:51.270> ship<00:01:51.450> shape<00:01:51.659> that

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
really dial in the exact ship shape that

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.510 
really dial in the exact ship shape that
you're<00:01:51.960> looking<00:01:52.229> to<00:01:52.259> achieve<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:53.070> given<00:01:53.340> wind
