in<00:06:17.130> with<00:06:17.160> a<00:06:17.400> glue<00:06:17.850> pen<00:06:18.090> I<00:06:18.770> had<00:06:19.770> first<00:06:20.070> used<00:06:20.520> my

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:20.730 
in with a glue pen I had first used my

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:22.430 
in with a glue pen I had first used my
multi<00:06:21.090> matte<00:06:21.300> medium<00:06:21.450> which<00:06:21.780> I<00:06:21.930> love<00:06:22.140> but<00:06:22.380> I

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:22.440 
multi matte medium which I love but I

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.680 
multi matte medium which I love but I
found<00:06:22.860> that<00:06:23.100> when<00:06:23.340> the<00:06:23.550> glue<00:06:23.820> or<00:06:24.030> anything<00:06:24.060> wet

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:24.690 
found that when the glue or anything wet

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:27.590 
found that when the glue or anything wet
got<00:06:25.560> onto<00:06:25.860> the<00:06:26.490> side<00:06:26.880> with<00:06:27.120> all<00:06:27.240> the<00:06:27.390> color

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:27.600 
got onto the side with all the color

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.390 
got onto the side with all the color
bursts<00:06:27.990> it<00:06:28.110> kind<00:06:28.350> of<00:06:28.410> reactivated<00:06:29.100> the<00:06:29.130> color

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:29.400 
bursts it kind of reactivated the color

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.460 
bursts it kind of reactivated the color
so<00:06:29.940> I<00:06:29.970> very<00:06:30.270> carefully<00:06:30.540> used<00:06:30.960> a<00:06:31.080> glue<00:06:31.260> pen

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:31.470 
so I very carefully used a glue pen

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:33.290 
so I very carefully used a glue pen
making<00:06:31.860> sure<00:06:32.010> not<00:06:32.190> to<00:06:32.250> let<00:06:32.460> any<00:06:32.670> of<00:06:32.820> that<00:06:32.970> any

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:33.300 
making sure not to let any of that any

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:37.850 
making sure not to let any of that any
wetness<00:06:33.570> touch<00:06:34.020> the<00:06:34.320> the<00:06:35.190> color<00:06:36.180> of<00:06:36.300> the<00:06:36.860> color

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:37.860 
wetness touch the the color of the color

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:40.340 
wetness touch the the color of the color
bursts<00:06:38.310> and<00:06:38.460> I<00:06:38.700> was<00:06:38.850> good<00:06:39.090> to<00:06:39.240> go<00:06:39.360> so<00:06:40.020> again<00:06:40.260> i'm

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:40.350
