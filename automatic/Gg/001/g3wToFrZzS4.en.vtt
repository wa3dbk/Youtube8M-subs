00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:04.560
 hey people the adventure respect my 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.759
 weekly grammy right now we are 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.770
 start immediately because it was one 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.150
 pretty busy week again 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.620
 and we are going to start with something i 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.030
 actually talks very little about it 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.059
 namely about the who 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:18.090
 you last 30 may was of course 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.550
 mario kart 8 selected by wiu 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.070
 finally a game for who use how 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.720
 without looking out and has Nintendo 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.960
 announced the game 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.570
 1.2 million copies sold since the 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.210
 along on May 30 which amounts to that 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.450
 20% of review owners 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.040
 so have bought Mario Kart 8 and the 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.629
 sales figures in for example the 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.760
 united kingdom were since to 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.820
 release of mario kart 8 with no less than 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.010
 increased six hundred percent 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.620
 so you definitely have nintendo on 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.719
 done to finally release mario kart 8 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.690
 let's spend we go with apple 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.940
 who namely beach for 3 billion 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.350
 dollars and for people who don't 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.719
 know what beats is of course that 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.760
 company with those headphones that are best 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.379
 be expensive and I hear it 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.760
 actually a bit overpriced is what 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.570
 maybe a little according to some 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.950
 with apple 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.110
 but they probably just have it 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.909
 purchased for the streaming service that 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.740
 offers itself also put for sale that is possible 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.420
 now use apple nicely and 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.400
 of course really that is from doctor 3 and 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.750
 jimmy loafing so say the founder 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.939
 are from beach 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.740
 in addition, apple has on their own 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.290
 developer conference I just know the 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.070
 name not purely from yesterday or via 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.619
 for you that is a few days 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.320
 ago apple hi-res 8 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.900
 announced some new things and that 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.060
 there are for example that you 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.990
 So you have interactive notifications 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.909
 for example from the 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.950
 to respond to a notification screen 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.540
 SMS now text prediction 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.750
 through swiftie developers 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.549
 now also say their own in app store 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.409
 keyboards so the toss so 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.479
 users can use a different keyboard 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.430
 and it's mostly with you 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.380
 little things it 's not big 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.409
 video like that lesson 7 as compared to 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.259
 arjo s6 and yes that will probably work 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.969
 come out at the same time as the new one 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.860
 iPhone rumors were going about that 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.420
 two versions arrived between 4.7 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.069
 inch screen and five and a half inches 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.840
 screen but we still have to go there 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.180
 corridor wait before apple who goes 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.099
 we will continue to announce 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.650
 yes, because actually a little e3 news 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:19.379
 it seems like all publishers and 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.909
 announce things for the e3 because they 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:22.260
 otherwise not enough on the e3 itself 

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:23.909
 get attention 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.079
 For example, cry tank is one of those 

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:28.620
 first had a new mumbai game or 1hv 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:30.959
 announced 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.400
 they also have homefront revolution 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.750
 they have new detail is already known 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.310
 they also made before a 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.439
 trailer throws online 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.209
 is of course a continuation of the home front 

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:41.040
 she plays a few years after the game 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.530
 and it is made by quartet usa 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.950
 which therefore logically in America 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.599
 and they now have a new one 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.040
 namely hear horizon game announced 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:52.859
 so tap share tates 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.599
 and this will be a calf you are going to be 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:56.370
 and probably runs on the corail 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:58.230
 engines like almost all games 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.419
 nowadays I cried logically 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.750
 the cryengine is their we we go 

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:05.489
 by with naughty dog the rumor is already going 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.469
 that they may have started a 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:10.139
 new the charge fixed charges much two 

00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:11.969
 of course even though of course the 

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:14.310
 bothered by spraying him out 

00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:15.750
 and of course they are also busy with one 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.639
 chart it 4 for which a long time 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.560
 was already a teaser trailer 

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:22.139
 released we will continue with 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.879
 your software was of course previous 

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:25.949
 soak or become pieces for hatching 

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:27.870
 playstation 4 the xbox one 

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:30.479
 the computer and in my opinion also for the 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.519
 PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and is 

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:34.949
 soon there is more than 4 million times 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:37.260
 sold in the first week and a week 

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:39.329
 that's pretty expected 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.739
 the expected is sometimes actually there 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:41.909
 sold six million times 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:43.769
 be out of my mind 

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:45.599
 so four million copies in the first 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:46.889
 week for a new franchise 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:49.349
 that is really just very neat 

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:51.389
 done by us or but I wonder 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:54.329
 for the people who will sometimes have 

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:56.669
 purchased for any platform whatever 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:58.769
 is your opinion about game because I hear 

00:03:56.669 --> 00:04:00.540
 really many different stories 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:02.069
 one found the other way the one 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.229
 they think it meets expectations 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:06.900
 the other again totally not 

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:08.159
 and to be honest the e3 demo 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.169
 2012 

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:12.509
 yes the expectations were huge 

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:14.909
 high up firstly by the yes 

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:17.159
 great graphics of course and outdoor 

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:18.449
 yes it is the gameplay with the fence 

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:19.289
 in that we would have worked things out well 

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:21.090
 are going to be 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:22.409
 what is your opinion about was so is late 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.849
 let me know in the comments there 

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:24.810
 I'm quite curious about that 

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:25.530
 and then we continue with the latter 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.930
 news 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:30.030
 about Poortstra was of course the 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:32.940
 ice was the lungs of the xbox one 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:36.330
 ports offered sport 6 if I remember correctly 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:38.580
 have come true and the now goes a new one 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.900
 Ford Samurai were two hatches 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.450
 of course for the xbox 360 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.010
 was samurai that was something 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:45.389
 other than for his possible foot 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:47.100
 is normal that's always just 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:48.990
 nice on a circuit 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:51.389
 racing that was before sunrise in any 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.490
 case had a big open world and then 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:56.490
 Going now is a full consequence of occurrence 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:59.040
 the something must have won and yes really 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:00.570
 so much announced for the e3 of 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.000
 this year actually wanted to be weird 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:05.730
 the remains so little about forms full 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.260
 for the e3 but yes differences from life 

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:09.900
 They are said to be with some 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:11.610
 big announcements came where we 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.020
 unaware of it 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:16.080
 so let's hope we go 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:17.910
 surprise on the e3 that about one and a half or 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.080
 two weeks or something is actually fashion 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:20.250
 Drop your thanks for watching 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.810
 this video 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:23.490
 did you like the video deserves the blue 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.150
 has allowed as to load and until next 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.600
 times 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.600
 later on
