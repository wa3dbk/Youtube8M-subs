00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:03.020 

hey<00:00:02.490> everybody

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
hey everybody

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:03.980 
hey everybody
so<00:00:03.149> today<00:00:03.300> I'm<00:00:03.389> gonna<00:00:03.510> show<00:00:03.659> you<00:00:03.720> a<00:00:03.840> very

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
so today I'm gonna show you a very

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:05.720 
so today I'm gonna show you a very
interesting<00:00:04.250> modification<00:00:05.250> you<00:00:05.370> can<00:00:05.490> do<00:00:05.609> to

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
interesting modification you can do to

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.070 
interesting modification you can do to
your<00:00:05.819> car<00:00:05.879> to<00:00:06.299> lower<00:00:06.540> your<00:00:06.720> air<00:00:06.899> intake

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
your car to lower your air intake

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.040 
your car to lower your air intake
temperatures<00:00:08.120> so<00:00:09.120> this<00:00:09.269> is<00:00:09.389> not<00:00:09.630> a<00:00:09.660> vehicle

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
temperatures so this is not a vehicle

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.830 
temperatures so this is not a vehicle
specific<00:00:10.740> modification<00:00:11.420> but<00:00:12.420> I'll<00:00:12.540> be<00:00:12.660> doing

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
specific modification but I'll be doing

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.200 
specific modification but I'll be doing
this<00:00:12.900> on<00:00:13.049> my<00:00:13.080> 2011<00:00:14.040> Genesis<00:00:14.519> cube<00:00:14.759> 2<00:00:15.000> liter

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
this on my 2011 Genesis cube 2 liter

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.840 
this on my 2011 Genesis cube 2 liter
turbo<00:00:15.650> so<00:00:16.650> if<00:00:16.740> you'll<00:00:16.890> notice<00:00:17.100> your<00:00:17.340> throttle

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
turbo so if you'll notice your throttle

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.890 
turbo so if you'll notice your throttle
body<00:00:18.590> just<00:00:19.590> right<00:00:19.920> here<00:00:20.390> you'll<00:00:21.390> see<00:00:21.449> two

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
body just right here you'll see two

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:22.970 
body just right here you'll see two
lines<00:00:22.109> going<00:00:22.410> into<00:00:22.680> it

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
lines going into it

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.500 
lines going into it
this<00:00:23.250> one<00:00:23.430> right<00:00:23.609> here<00:00:23.939> and<00:00:24.119> then<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:24.390> one

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
this one right here and then the one

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.269 
this one right here and then the one
right<00:00:24.750> below<00:00:24.930> it<00:00:25.199> those<00:00:25.800> are<00:00:25.949> actually

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
right below it those are actually

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.160 
right below it those are actually
coolant<00:00:26.730> lines<00:00:26.939> that<00:00:27.300> go<00:00:27.449> to<00:00:27.510> your<00:00:27.750> radiator

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
coolant lines that go to your radiator

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.439 
coolant lines that go to your radiator
and<00:00:28.439> for<00:00:29.130> this<00:00:29.250> car<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.670> normal<00:00:30.150> operating

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
and for this car the normal operating

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.540 
and for this car the normal operating
temperatures<00:00:30.960> around<00:00:31.230> 180<00:00:31.859> degrees<00:00:31.949> for<00:00:32.489> the

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
temperatures around 180 degrees for the

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.520 
temperatures around 180 degrees for the
radiator<00:00:32.850> fluid<00:00:33.059> so<00:00:33.870> basically<00:00:34.290> what<00:00:34.500> that

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
radiator fluid so basically what that

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.889 
radiator fluid so basically what that
does<00:00:34.680> that's<00:00:35.489> circulating<00:00:36.120> hot<00:00:36.660> radiator

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
does that's circulating hot radiator

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.690 
does that's circulating hot radiator
fluid<00:00:37.230> into<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:37.890> throttle<00:00:38.129> body<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.610> the

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
fluid into the throttle body and the

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.700 
fluid into the throttle body and the
reason<00:00:39.239> that<00:00:39.390> they<00:00:39.510> do<00:00:39.570> that<00:00:39.750> is<00:00:40.170> basically

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
reason that they do that is basically

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.950 
reason that they do that is basically
for<00:00:40.800> winter<00:00:41.309> times<00:00:41.550> if<00:00:41.879> it<00:00:42.000> is<00:00:42.149> freezing

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
for winter times if it is freezing

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.479 
for winter times if it is freezing
temperatures<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.469> air<00:00:43.860> going<00:00:44.129> into<00:00:44.430> the

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
temperatures the air going into the

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.490 
temperatures the air going into the
throttle<00:00:44.850> body<00:00:44.940> can<00:00:45.570> freeze<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:46.050> throttle

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
throttle body can freeze the throttle

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.650 
throttle body can freeze the throttle
plate<00:00:46.590> and<00:00:46.890> kind<00:00:47.070> of<00:00:47.129> develop<00:00:47.399> ice<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:48.030> with<00:00:48.629> a

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
plate and kind of develop ice and with a

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.569 
plate and kind of develop ice and with a
electric<00:00:49.230> motor<00:00:49.469> that<00:00:49.710> opens<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.399> throttle

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
electric motor that opens the throttle

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.510 
electric motor that opens the throttle
plate<00:00:50.820> it<00:00:51.329> can<00:00:51.629> wear<00:00:51.870> out<00:00:51.989> that<00:00:52.020> motor<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:52.680> the

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
plate it can wear out that motor and the

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.250 
plate it can wear out that motor and the
ice<00:00:53.670> that<00:00:54.030> could<00:00:54.210> develop<00:00:54.510> inside<00:00:54.989> could

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
ice that could develop inside could

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.569 
ice that could develop inside could
actually<00:00:55.500> choke<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.860> engine<00:00:55.890> which<00:00:56.550> is

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
actually choke the engine which is

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.700 
actually choke the engine which is
obviously<00:00:56.969> not<00:00:57.120> good<00:00:57.329> but<00:00:58.140> about<00:00:58.320> nine<00:00:58.530> months

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
obviously not good but about nine months

00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:59.869 
obviously not good but about nine months
out<00:00:58.920> of<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.070> year<00:00:59.219> we<00:00:59.250> don't<00:00:59.370> even<00:00:59.640> see

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
out of the year we don't even see

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.910 
out of the year we don't even see
freezing<00:01:00.090> temperatures<00:01:00.690> so<00:01:01.289> pumping<00:01:01.739> more

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
freezing temperatures so pumping more

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.709 
freezing temperatures so pumping more
heat<00:01:02.160> into<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.520> throttle<00:01:02.879> body<00:01:03.059> is<00:01:03.270> pointless

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
heat into the throttle body is pointless

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.390 
heat into the throttle body is pointless
and<00:01:03.930> in<00:01:04.049> fact<00:01:04.229> it's<00:01:04.500> hindering<00:01:04.739> performance

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
and in fact it's hindering performance

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.890 
and in fact it's hindering performance
just<00:01:05.580> because<00:01:05.790> it's<00:01:05.970> heating<00:01:06.570> up<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.810> air

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
just because it's heating up the air

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.440 
just because it's heating up the air
intake<00:01:07.200> temperatures<00:01:07.619> just<00:01:07.770> a<00:01:07.890> little<00:01:08.100> bit<00:01:08.450> so

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
intake temperatures just a little bit so

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.090 
intake temperatures just a little bit so
to<00:01:09.540> do<00:01:09.720> this<00:01:09.869> modification<00:01:10.260> you<00:01:10.770> need<00:01:10.799> to<00:01:10.979> look

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
to do this modification you need to look

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.950 
to do this modification you need to look
at<00:01:11.310> both<00:01:11.610> of<00:01:11.640> these<00:01:11.850> hoses<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.420> top<00:01:12.630> one<00:01:12.840> in

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
at both of these hoses the top one in

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.960 
at both of these hoses the top one in
the<00:01:13.020> bottom<00:01:13.170> one<00:01:13.470> and<00:01:13.710> basically<00:01:14.700> what<00:01:14.850> you're

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
the bottom one and basically what you're

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.270 
the bottom one and basically what you're
gonna<00:01:15.030> do<00:01:15.390> instead<00:01:15.810> of<00:01:15.869> having<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.500> fluid<00:01:16.890> go

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
gonna do instead of having the fluid go

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.920 
gonna do instead of having the fluid go
through<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.640> hose<00:01:17.820> into<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.540> throttle<00:01:18.750> body

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
through the hose into the throttle body

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.450 
through the hose into the throttle body
and<00:01:19.110> then<00:01:19.320> back<00:01:19.500> out<00:01:19.710> through<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.009> other<00:01:20.250> one

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
and then back out through the other one

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.219 
and then back out through the other one
you're<00:01:21.030> basically<00:01:21.420> just<00:01:21.479> gonna<00:01:21.689> cut<00:01:21.960> that<00:01:22.080> off

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
you're basically just gonna cut that off

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.230 
you're basically just gonna cut that off
and<00:01:22.409> just<00:01:22.470> circulate<00:01:22.920> it<00:01:23.070> from<00:01:23.250> one<00:01:23.430> hose<00:01:23.640> to

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
and just circulate it from one hose to

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.999 
and just circulate it from one hose to
the<00:01:24.360> other<00:01:24.509> directly<00:01:25.020> bypassing<00:01:25.470> the

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
the other directly bypassing the

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.700 
the other directly bypassing the
throttle<00:01:26.369> body<00:01:26.430> completely<00:01:27.200> all<00:01:28.200> right<00:01:28.290> so<00:01:28.560> to

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
throttle body completely all right so to

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.170 
throttle body completely all right so to
do<00:01:28.829> this<00:01:28.950> modification<00:01:29.340> you'll<00:01:29.790> just<00:01:29.939> need<00:01:30.119> a

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
do this modification you'll just need a

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.640 
do this modification you'll just need a
pair<00:01:30.390> of<00:01:30.420> pliers<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:30.869> some<00:01:31.170> paper<00:01:31.380> towels

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
pair of pliers and some paper towels

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.289 
pair of pliers and some paper towels
you're<00:01:32.460> gonna<00:01:32.579> lose<00:01:32.759> a<00:01:32.820> little<00:01:33.000> bit<00:01:33.180> of

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
you're gonna lose a little bit of

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.380 
you're gonna lose a little bit of
coolant<00:01:33.810> while<00:01:34.020> you<00:01:34.110> do<00:01:34.290> this<00:01:34.939> so<00:01:35.939> first<00:01:36.180> what

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
coolant while you do this so first what

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.580 
coolant while you do this so first what
I'm<00:01:36.479> gonna<00:01:36.570> start<00:01:36.840> with<00:01:37.049> I'm<00:01:37.170> gonna<00:01:37.290> take<00:01:37.470> this

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
I'm gonna start with I'm gonna take this

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.020 
I'm gonna start with I'm gonna take this
one<00:01:37.799> right<00:01:37.829> here<00:01:38.250> just<00:01:38.460> take<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.850> little

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
one right here just take the little

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.609 
one right here just take the little
metal<00:01:39.270> clamp<00:01:39.509> off

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 
metal clamp off

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:43.710 
metal clamp off
and<00:01:42.369> sometimes<00:01:42.939> depending<00:01:43.329> if<00:01:43.450> you've<00:01:43.600> ever

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
and sometimes depending if you've ever

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.420 
and sometimes depending if you've ever
taken<00:01:43.869> these<00:01:44.079> off<00:01:44.229> before<00:01:44.439> you<00:01:45.130> might<00:01:45.280> just

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
taken these off before you might just

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.490 
taken these off before you might just
want<00:01:45.549> to<00:01:45.610> squeeze<00:01:46.420> it<00:01:46.570> and<00:01:46.659> turn<00:01:47.170> it<00:01:47.200> a<00:01:47.350> little

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
want to squeeze it and turn it a little

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:57.570 
want to squeeze it and turn it a little
just<00:01:47.619> to<00:01:47.740> kind<00:01:47.890> of<00:01:47.920> break<00:01:48.100> that<00:01:48.130> seal

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.670 

alright<00:01:58.580> now<00:01:58.820> what<00:01:58.940> you<00:01:59.060> need<00:01:59.210> to<00:01:59.330> do<00:01:59.620> go<00:02:00.620> to

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
alright now what you need to do go to

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.470 
alright now what you need to do go to
this<00:02:00.860> lower<00:02:01.490> line<00:02:01.760> right<00:02:02.030> here<00:02:02.240> and

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:02.480 
this lower line right here and

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:11.270 
this lower line right here and
disconnect<00:02:03.020> it<00:02:03.110> from<00:02:03.170> the<00:02:03.410> throttle<00:02:03.650> body

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.940 

so<00:02:12.270> now<00:02:12.420> this<00:02:12.630> longer<00:02:13.020> hose<00:02:13.200> is<00:02:13.380> gonna<00:02:13.560> circle

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
so now this longer hose is gonna circle

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.650 
so now this longer hose is gonna circle
back<00:02:14.070> and<00:02:14.130> get<00:02:14.520> connected<00:02:14.760> right<00:02:15.090> to<00:02:15.120> this<00:02:15.390> one

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
back and get connected right to this one

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.180 
back and get connected right to this one
so<00:02:15.840> now<00:02:15.960> we're<00:02:16.110> just<00:02:16.170> gonna<00:02:16.320> reapply<00:02:17.070> this

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
so now we're just gonna reapply this

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.950 
so now we're just gonna reapply this
metal<00:02:17.970> bracket<00:02:20.360> so<00:02:21.360> now<00:02:21.510> this<00:02:21.630> side<00:02:21.840> is

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
metal bracket so now this side is

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.630 
metal bracket so now this side is
completely<00:02:22.080> hooked<00:02:22.500> back<00:02:22.740> together<00:02:22.920> so<00:02:23.520> the

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
completely hooked back together so the

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.000 
completely hooked back together so the
flue<00:02:23.820> is<00:02:23.940> just<00:02:24.090> gonna<00:02:24.210> go<00:02:24.420> in<00:02:24.540> a<00:02:24.600> circle<00:02:25.010> so

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
flue is just gonna go in a circle so

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.320 
flue is just gonna go in a circle so
instead<00:02:26.310> of<00:02:26.370> going<00:02:26.550> into<00:02:26.760> the<00:02:26.850> throttle<00:02:27.240> body

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
instead of going into the throttle body

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.290 
instead of going into the throttle body
just<00:02:27.660> looping<00:02:28.590> itself<00:02:29.000> you<00:02:30.000> just<00:02:30.120> want<00:02:30.240> to

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
just looping itself you just want to

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.910 
just looping itself you just want to
make<00:02:30.420> sure<00:02:30.570> that<00:02:30.720> there<00:02:31.020> are<00:02:31.230> two<00:02:31.620> doesn't

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
make sure that there are two doesn't

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.590 
make sure that there are two doesn't
have<00:02:32.010> any<00:02:32.130> kinks<00:02:32.370> in<00:02:32.520> it<00:02:32.640> depending<00:02:33.270> on<00:02:33.540> what

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
have any kinks in it depending on what

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.030 
have any kinks in it depending on what
kind<00:02:33.780> of<00:02:33.810> car<00:02:34.020> you<00:02:34.140> have<00:02:34.170> you<00:02:34.440> might<00:02:34.650> have<00:02:34.830> a

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
kind of car you have you might have a

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.590 
kind of car you have you might have a
different<00:02:35.430> setup<00:02:35.640> so<00:02:36.000> just<00:02:36.420> make<00:02:36.540> sure

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
different setup so just make sure

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.140 
different setup so just make sure
there's<00:02:36.720> no<00:02:36.810> kinks<00:02:37.550> but<00:02:38.550> there's<00:02:38.730> no<00:02:38.820> kinks

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
there's no kinks but there's no kinks

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.970 
there's no kinks but there's no kinks
like<00:02:39.300> it<00:02:39.420> is<00:02:39.510> now<00:02:39.660> that<00:02:39.960> is<00:02:40.080> perfectly<00:02:40.590> safe<00:02:40.920> to

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
like it is now that is perfectly safe to

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.370 
like it is now that is perfectly safe to
run<00:02:41.310> so<00:02:42.210> now<00:02:42.300> I'm<00:02:42.390> gonna<00:02:42.570> hook<00:02:42.690> this<00:02:42.840> pipe<00:02:43.140> back

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
run so now I'm gonna hook this pipe back

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.410 
run so now I'm gonna hook this pipe back
into<00:02:43.800> the<00:02:43.980> outlet<00:02:44.340> right<00:02:44.459> there<00:02:44.700> and<00:02:45.300> you

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
into the outlet right there and you

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:46.970 
into the outlet right there and you
can't<00:02:45.660> actually<00:02:45.780> just<00:02:45.930> put<00:02:46.200> caps<00:02:46.440> on<00:02:46.740> these

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
can't actually just put caps on these

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.190 
can't actually just put caps on these
two<00:02:47.190> openings<00:02:47.550> but<00:02:48.150> since<00:02:48.450> for<00:02:48.810> a<00:02:48.840> few<00:02:49.020> months

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
two openings but since for a few months

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.270 
two openings but since for a few months
out<00:02:49.260> of<00:02:49.320> the<00:02:49.440> year<00:02:49.530> I<00:02:49.620> will<00:02:49.830> be<00:02:49.950> putting<00:02:50.160> this

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
out of the year I will be putting this

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.130 
out of the year I will be putting this
back<00:02:50.490> to<00:02:50.640> stock<00:02:50.880> when<00:02:51.090> it's<00:02:51.209> winter<00:02:51.390> I'm<00:02:51.959> just

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
back to stock when it's winter I'm just

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.870 
back to stock when it's winter I'm just
gonna<00:02:52.230> go<00:02:52.440> ahead<00:02:52.560> and<00:02:52.740> use<00:02:52.890> itself<00:02:53.459> as<00:02:53.580> a<00:02:53.610> cap

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
gonna go ahead and use itself as a cap

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.449 
gonna go ahead and use itself as a cap
and<00:02:54.060> just<00:02:54.150> kind<00:02:54.360> of<00:02:54.390> loop<00:02:54.570> it<00:02:54.690> back<00:02:55.310> so<00:02:56.310> here's

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
and just kind of loop it back so here's

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.320 
and just kind of loop it back so here's
a<00:02:56.520> close-up<00:02:56.760> of<00:02:57.030> what<00:02:57.180> it<00:02:57.270> looks<00:02:57.420> like<00:02:59.120> you<00:03:00.120> see

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
a close-up of what it looks like you see

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:05.120 
a close-up of what it looks like you see
that<00:03:00.480> hose<00:03:00.660> nicely<00:03:01.200> looped<00:03:03.860> and<00:03:04.860> then<00:03:05.010> this

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
that hose nicely looped and then this

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:11.300 
that hose nicely looped and then this
one<00:03:05.310> right<00:03:05.490> here

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:12.890 

so<00:03:11.910> now<00:03:12.030> you'll<00:03:12.180> see<00:03:12.240> the<00:03:12.510> actual<00:03:12.630> difference

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
so now you'll see the actual difference

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.270 
so now you'll see the actual difference
to<00:03:13.200> see<00:03:13.350> if<00:03:13.410> there<00:03:13.530> really<00:03:13.560> is<00:03:13.770> a<00:03:13.860> difference

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
to see if there really is a difference

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.340 
to see if there really is a difference
I'm<00:03:14.850> gonna<00:03:15.090> use<00:03:15.360> the<00:03:15.510> torque<00:03:15.780> app<00:03:15.959> on<00:03:16.140> my<00:03:16.319> phone

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
I'm gonna use the torque app on my phone

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.500 
I'm gonna use the torque app on my phone
and<00:03:16.920> measure<00:03:17.340> the<00:03:17.550> intake<00:03:17.850> air<00:03:17.970> temperatures

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
and measure the intake air temperatures

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.540 
and measure the intake air temperatures
compared<00:03:18.959> to<00:03:19.080> ambient<00:03:19.410> air<00:03:19.650> temperature<00:03:19.680> to

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
compared to ambient air temperature to

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.490 
compared to ambient air temperature to
see<00:03:20.730> the<00:03:20.850> difference<00:03:21.209> and<00:03:21.390> then<00:03:21.959> I<00:03:21.990> will<00:03:22.230> also

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
see the difference and then I will also

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.410 
see the difference and then I will also
be<00:03:22.590> using<00:03:22.860> an<00:03:22.980> infrared<00:03:23.280> heat<00:03:23.640> gun<00:03:23.819> to<00:03:24.209> see

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
be using an infrared heat gun to see

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:25.610 
be using an infrared heat gun to see
what<00:03:24.630> the<00:03:24.720> throttle<00:03:25.020> body's<00:03:25.290> actual

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
what the throttle body's actual

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.940 
what the throttle body's actual
temperature<00:03:26.010> is<00:03:27.500> so<00:03:28.500> with<00:03:28.620> the<00:03:28.739> stock

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
temperature is so with the stock

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:30.380 
temperature is so with the stock
configuration<00:03:29.130> you<00:03:29.790> can<00:03:29.880> see<00:03:30.090> that<00:03:30.270> the

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
configuration you can see that the

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.510 
configuration you can see that the
intake<00:03:30.810> air<00:03:31.020> temperature<00:03:31.440> is<00:03:31.890> staying<00:03:32.250> about

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 
intake air temperature is staying about

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.610 
intake air temperature is staying about
22<00:03:33.270> degrees<00:03:33.450> above<00:03:33.930> the<00:03:34.050> ambient<00:03:34.200> air

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
22 degrees above the ambient air

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:45.820 
22 degrees above the ambient air
temperature<00:03:35.030> notice<00:03:36.030> when<00:03:36.209> driving<00:03:43.910> about

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:45.830 
temperature notice when driving about

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.830 
temperature notice when driving about
120<00:03:46.830> degrees<00:03:47.100> and<00:03:47.790> then<00:03:48.390> right<00:03:48.600> where<00:03:48.750> the

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
120 degrees and then right where the

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.630 
120 degrees and then right where the
tubes<00:03:49.080> connect<00:03:50.180> looking<00:03:51.180> about<00:03:51.330> 150<00:03:52.050> degrees

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 
tubes connect looking about 150 degrees

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.770 
tubes connect looking about 150 degrees
so<00:03:53.640> now<00:03:53.790> driving<00:03:54.120> with<00:03:54.360> this<00:03:54.510> modification

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
so now driving with this modification

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.720 
so now driving with this modification
done<00:03:55.380> you<00:03:55.590> can<00:03:55.709> see<00:03:55.860> that<00:03:55.980> the<00:03:56.130> air<00:03:56.310> intake

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
done you can see that the air intake

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.580 
done you can see that the air intake
temperature<00:03:57.269> is<00:03:57.420> just<00:03:57.660> about<00:03:57.930> 10<00:03:58.440> or<00:03:58.560> 11

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
temperature is just about 10 or 11

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.220 
temperature is just about 10 or 11
degrees<00:03:59.160> above<00:03:59.190> ambient<00:03:59.970> so<00:04:00.780> that's<00:04:00.930> about<00:04:01.170> a

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
degrees above ambient so that's about a

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.710 
degrees above ambient so that's about a
10<00:04:01.530> degree<00:04:01.830> drop<00:04:01.970> and<00:04:02.970> I've<00:04:03.060> noticed<00:04:03.480> when

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
10 degree drop and I've noticed when

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.840 
10 degree drop and I've noticed when
driving<00:04:04.080> like<00:04:04.380> this<00:04:04.410> it<00:04:04.860> stays<00:04:05.130> about<00:04:05.430> 10<00:04:05.730> to

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
driving like this it stays about 10 to

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:12.259 
driving like this it stays about 10 to
15<00:04:06.239> degrees<00:04:08.269> about<00:04:09.350> 25<00:04:10.730> all<00:04:11.730> right<00:04:11.880> so<00:04:12.060> now

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
15 degrees about 25 all right so now

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:16.340 
15 degrees about 25 all right so now
after<00:04:12.390> the<00:04:12.600> modification<00:04:14.840> so<00:04:15.840> the<00:04:15.959> top<00:04:16.200> of

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
after the modification so the top of

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.640 
after the modification so the top of
throttle<00:04:16.650> body<00:04:16.769> is<00:04:16.919> 92<00:04:17.579> degrees<00:04:17.760> and<00:04:18.750> right

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
throttle body is 92 degrees and right

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.790 
throttle body is 92 degrees and right
where<00:04:19.890> the<00:04:20.870> hoses<00:04:21.870> go<00:04:22.049> is<00:04:22.229> a<00:04:22.260> hundred<00:04:22.710> and

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
where the hoses go is a hundred and

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.300 
where the hoses go is a hundred and
eleven<00:04:22.830> Wow<00:04:23.600> so<00:04:24.600> that's<00:04:24.750> a<00:04:24.900> huge<00:04:25.410> decrease<00:04:26.010> in

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
eleven Wow so that's a huge decrease in

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.159 
eleven Wow so that's a huge decrease in
temperature<00:04:26.820> which<00:04:27.300> obviously<00:04:27.630> you<00:04:27.810> just<00:04:27.960> saw

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:28.169 
temperature which obviously you just saw

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:29.480 
temperature which obviously you just saw
with<00:04:28.380> the<00:04:28.410> air<00:04:28.620> intake<00:04:28.770> temperature<00:04:29.310> being

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
with the air intake temperature being

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.480 
with the air intake temperature being
lower<00:04:30.410> all<00:04:31.410> right<00:04:31.500> so<00:04:31.710> there<00:04:31.860> you<00:04:31.979> go<00:04:32.100> that<00:04:32.310> is

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
lower all right so there you go that is

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.550 
lower all right so there you go that is
a<00:04:32.520> three<00:04:33.180> modification<00:04:33.960> that<00:04:34.080> you<00:04:34.229> can<00:04:34.380> do

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
a three modification that you can do

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.190 
a three modification that you can do
it's<00:04:34.830> basically<00:04:35.070> any<00:04:35.550> car<00:04:35.880> and<00:04:36.150> it's<00:04:36.840> free<00:04:37.080> to

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.200 
it's basically any car and it's free to

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.190 
it's basically any car and it's free to
do<00:04:37.350> takes<00:04:37.650> about<00:04:37.800> five<00:04:38.190> minutes<00:04:38.220> and<00:04:38.910> just

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:39.200 
do takes about five minutes and just

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.180 
do takes about five minutes and just
want<00:04:40.200> to<00:04:40.260> make<00:04:40.380> sure<00:04:40.410> when<00:04:40.740> it's<00:04:40.860> winter<00:04:41.070> time

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
want to make sure when it's winter time

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:43.430 
want to make sure when it's winter time
to<00:04:41.729> reverse<00:04:42.419> it<00:04:42.630> and<00:04:42.660> put<00:04:42.840> it<00:04:42.960> back<00:04:43.080> to<00:04:43.200> stock

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
to reverse it and put it back to stock

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.200 
to reverse it and put it back to stock
just<00:04:43.740> to<00:04:43.830> prevent<00:04:44.310> any<00:04:44.460> icing<00:04:45.000> in<00:04:45.120> the

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
just to prevent any icing in the

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.180 
just to prevent any icing in the
throttle<00:04:45.419> body<00:04:45.660> but<00:04:46.350> other<00:04:46.470> than<00:04:46.680> that<00:04:46.740> this

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
throttle body but other than that this

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:48.740 
throttle body but other than that this
is<00:04:47.250> a<00:04:47.400> good<00:04:47.970> way<00:04:48.120> to<00:04:48.180> get<00:04:48.419> a<00:04:48.479> few<00:04:48.720> extra

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
is a good way to get a few extra

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.450 
is a good way to get a few extra
horsepower<00:04:49.410> and<00:04:49.620> a<00:04:49.710> little<00:04:49.919> bit<00:04:50.010> lower<00:04:50.130> air

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
horsepower and a little bit lower air

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.430 
horsepower and a little bit lower air
