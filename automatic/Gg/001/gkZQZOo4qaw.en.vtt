00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.290
 hello everyone knows going for 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.509
 video test.com today I you 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.210
 presents the 100% test to schools 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.099
 standard of optimum nutrition a 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.790
 100% protein but that has a pretty good 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.080
 reputation 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.080
 here we go 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:32.290
 here we have taxes of 900 ighram taste 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:34.360
 chocolate the business arguments of the 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.820
 mark are therefore the quality of 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.480
 used proteins including viso the 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.920
 that the filtration quality then 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.900
 100% but it indicates that the mixture of 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.730
 protein is composed exclusively of 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.010
 milk protein whether it's for 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.570
 isolate or concentrate it and finally the brand 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.350
 puts forward the fact that for 30 grams 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.980
 of powder 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:57.040
 we have 24 gram of protein 5.5 g of bca 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.360
 and four grams of glutamine so this 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.790
 which concerns the ingredients one can 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:04.330
 see compromise on to isolate two 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:07.390
 wes protein followed by concentrated 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.710
 way proteins also gold for them 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.409
 characteristics of these two proteins 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.020
 I invite you to consult our file 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:16.180
 proteins on the site 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.100
 quickly the difference between the insulation 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.570
 concentrated is that we enjoy a 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.979
 better rate of protein for isola 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.520
 a low level of carbohydrates and fats 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:25.600
 and also a lot less lactose 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.159
 then we find the ingredients 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.860
 who participate in the end and the texture 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:31.480
 of this protein 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.850
 regarding the composition so 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:37.180
 we see here on the chocolate taste that we 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:40.420
 is 78 grams of protein per 100 grams 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.760
 it goes up to 81 81 grams for others 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.370
 aromas 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:48.540
 was against by 3.8 g for liquids 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:50.830
 and 5.8 grams for carbohydrates 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.330
 so we saw it with the composition 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.350
 according to perfumes the concentration in 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.930
 Protein may vary 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.610
 here we drip chocolate so it's more 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.820
 low but otherwise usually letourneau 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:04.570
 about 80% protein what is the 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:06.120
 average of the concentrates here in 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.039
 presence of a protein mixture 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.720
 with the first ingredients insulator then 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.549
 the concentrate so we can deduce 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.819
 that there is more isola than concentrating 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:17.530
 in this pot we can see so that we 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:19.090
 is far from the concentrations 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.099
 usual isolates that in general 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.519
 revolves around 4 to him 10% of 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:26.069
 proteins and we have a rate of 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:28.510
 carbohydrates and lipids that is found 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:31.269
 in the mean between an isolate is a 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.849
 focused for the missile test it and 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:38.280
 so I took a dose of 30 g of 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:38.280
 proteins and 250 milliliters of 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:48.769
 so very little foam we want that 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:52.189
 no lumps or in the bottom of the shaker 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:53.840
 nor on the edges in conclusion so for 

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:56.269
 the strong points I retained we find 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.049
 two isolated it a low carbohydrate 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:00.260
 and lipids 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:01.730
 if we compare to others concentrated by 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.049
 against weak points we can see 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.780
 we do not enjoy all the benefits 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:08.060
 of an isola sand and we also find the 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.579
 presence of soy lecithin with 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.409
 possibilities of gm for my personal opinion 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:13.419
 so first of all this time a good taste 

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:17.389
 and good visibility 

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:18.950
 no digestion problem with regard to 

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:21.889
 concerns the concentrations so we have it 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.780
 seen we are here in front of a species 

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:25.129
 of hybrid between the concentrated isolate due 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.169
 to the mixture of these two proteins 

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:28.879
 so we do not take full advantage of a 

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:30.439
 isola which still benefits from a 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:32.840
 product that is slightly higher than 

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:34.629
 a simple concentrate especially at the level 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.340
 lipids and carbohydrates 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:39.530
 on the other hand, the positive point is that we 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.750
 has one or is composed of two proteins 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.979
 slopes % which is appreciable 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.199
 when you know that a lot of brands 

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:46.879
 do not hesitate to use the wii 

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:47.479
 cheese to reduce the cost of 

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:49.370
 manufacturing 

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:51.799
 this is the test is over I tell you to 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:54.590
 very quickly on u2 test.com if you have 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:56.030
 tested this product do not hesitate to note 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.010
 and leave your comments on 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.489
