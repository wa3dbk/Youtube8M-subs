00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:20.460

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:21.810
 they too the diapason our dodi 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:27.210
 battle and rome doesn't look stupid 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:28.949
 tonight we can have a second but only 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.670
 the attack in the text taken from the 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.670
 wrinkled musical comedy 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.449
 I see that Rome is not stupid tonight 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:44.839
 is a perfect piece for a young person 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:51.140
 rugantino suitor asks Rome for 

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:51.140
 help him and instead rosetta would not want 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:03.180
 share plan what interests you the most 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.769
 fabio when we perform this passage are 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.680
 the dynamics which is a suggestive piece 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.659
 so we will have to insist a lot on 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.500
 colors that are tones themes then need 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.500
 get on and off 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.680
 I hope this track can be 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.920
 let it stand for victory 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:29.180
 the curtain closes the lights go out 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.180
 Rome is not stupid tonight 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.220
