I think to find the shaking Patrick the
grass<00:02:36.430> is<00:02:36.820> I<00:02:37.209> just<00:02:37.810> up<00:02:38.230> here<00:02:38.670> so<00:02:39.670> what<00:02:40.000> you<00:02:40.060> want

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
grass is I just up here so what you want

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:43.979 
grass is I just up here so what you want
to<00:02:40.300> do<00:02:40.450> is<00:02:40.540> just<00:02:40.690> keep<00:02:40.870> running<00:02:41.080> across<00:02:42.989> until

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
to do is just keep running across until

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:57.330

use my juice has a five to seven cattle
right<00:05:55.300> in<00:05:55.800> these<00:05:57.060> shaking<00:05:58.060> patches<00:05:58.419> of<00:05:58.570> grass

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:58.810 
right in these shaking patches of grass

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:02.010 
right in these shaking patches of grass
and<00:05:59.110> white<00:05:59.290> version<00:06:00.090> so<00:06:01.090> it<00:06:01.389> can<00:06:01.540> take<00:06:01.690> a<00:06:01.750> while

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:02.020 
and white version so it can take a while

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:33.900 
and white version so it can take a while
to<00:06:02.050> find<00:06:04.320> so<00:06:05.320> I<00:06:05.650> just<00:06:06.010> keep<00:06:06.190> at<00:06:06.370> it

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:33.910 

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:38.340 

although<00:06:34.660> yeah<00:06:34.980> mismatch<00:06:35.980> is<00:06:36.160> a<00:06:37.350> world

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:38.350 
although yeah mismatch is a world

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:44.100 
although yeah mismatch is a world
mismatches<00:06:41.370> so<00:06:42.570> all<00:06:43.570> that<00:06:43.720> didn't<00:06:43.960> take<00:06:44.080> very

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:44.110 
mismatches so all that didn't take very

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:50.400 
mismatches so all that didn't take very
long<00:06:44.320> at<00:06:44.620> all<00:06:45.960> so<00:06:48.570> this<00:06:49.570> is<00:06:49.720> only<00:06:49.900> encounter

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:50.410 
long at all so this is only encounter

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:53.220
