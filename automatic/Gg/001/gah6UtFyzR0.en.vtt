00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 today we are going to talk about the giant sites 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.140
 prehistoric and scary animals 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.690
 who have lived on our planet the gift 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.340
 that yours is known as low 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.889
 armor because of its appearance 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.660
 frightening and yours that passes from 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.359
 drilling building 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.029
 he swam on our planet already makes more 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:24.029
 of 200 million years and arrive at nine 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:27.150
 meters in length once more 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.910
 brutal species already seen feeds 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:33.560
 of large sharks and even 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.560
 of animals of their own species 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:38.730
 can not expect an appearance 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.489
 of an animal that has been 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.590
 known as bequeath of myspace cement 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.460
 of prehistory like a giant in place 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.309
 of troubadours using up to 620 kilos and 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:55.190
 reaching seven meters in length 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:55.190
 I may have lived up to 40 thousand years ago 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.980
 The name means giant head but I 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.860
 I'm seems much more like a sloth. 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:15.040
 and so it is also known 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.830
 that way the mega had an othelio man 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:21.130
 lived in the pleistocene trio of what goes from 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:23.740
 2.5 million to 11 thousand books behind and 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.800
 also fed only leaves 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:30.060
 even so this oak animal use 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.060
 4 to 2 or more 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.500
 dubbed the terror birds 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:40.290
 did not match the fame they had 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:43.080
 reaching 2.5 meters in height 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.140
 provisional classes were capable of killing 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.659
 other animals quite easily 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:51.689
 thanks to feet with sharp claws and 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.909
 very strong beak having lived during the 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.220
 these birds could send 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:59.090
 communicated or seized victims 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.090
 against the ground 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:15.290
 the blue sun plot can 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.880
 its different but with the jaw will 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.490
 more big port 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.340
 it is stipulated that I have lived on earth 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.330
 between 23 million and 5 million years 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.670
 behind 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.070
 just like the relatives who live 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.140
 currently the blame course of button 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:34.300
 was fed only to hospitals 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.300
 mainly aquatic plants 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:42.290
 titanoboa could reach within 3 meters of 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.620
 length weighed over one tonne 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.840
 and like other giant snakes she 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.010
 fed on anything she 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.830
 wanted to 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:54.490
 these animals have already been extinct for 60 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.490
 millions of years 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.990
