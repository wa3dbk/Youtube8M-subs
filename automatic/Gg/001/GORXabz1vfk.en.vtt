don't<00:01:41.400> like<00:01:41.670> is<00:01:42.979> when<00:01:43.979> you're<00:01:44.130> using<00:01:44.370> infrared

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.040

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
it's got a little bit of a delay about a

00:01:50.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
it's got a little bit of a delay about a
quarter<00:01:50.490> of<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:50.729> second<00:01:51.119> delay

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.150 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.620 

but<00:02:01.150> if<00:02:01.270> you<00:02:01.420> use<00:02:01.450> the<00:02:01.659> USB<00:02:02.590> adapter<00:02:03.630> it's

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
but if you use the USB adapter it's

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:12.030 
but if you use the USB adapter it's
pretty<00:02:04.930> quick<00:02:10.110> this<00:02:11.110> button<00:02:11.440> right<00:02:11.470> here<00:02:11.620> in

the middle changes it from rf2 I are the

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.500 
the middle changes it from rf2 I are the
reason<00:02:17.830> I<00:02:17.920> use<00:02:17.950> IR<00:02:18.489> is<00:02:18.670> because<00:02:20.040> when<00:02:21.040> you<00:02:21.510> use

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
reason I use IR is because when you use
