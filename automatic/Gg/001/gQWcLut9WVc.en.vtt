00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.300
ONLYUSEmeBLADE: The reason why
I want to do the show is just

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:11.260
to show the world that the
stereotypical gamer can

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:15.510
actually go out, be active, and
dance, and do something

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:17.480
besides just being a
basement dweller.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.320
Also, the money wouldn't
hurt either.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.510
I feel 200% better than when
I first walked in.

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.090
I'm going to win this thing.

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.130
All the preparation from this
past week, it's all kind of

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.966
heading up to this moment.

00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:34.640
DOMINIC "D-TRIX" SANDOVAL: Next
up, please give it up for

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:25.350
DOMINIC "D-TRIX" SANDOVAL:
Well done.

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.950
Excellent job.

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:26.520
Bringing in the hugs.

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.640
Bringing in the hugs.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.430
So let's just see what
the judges thought.

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:30.205
Laurieann?

00:02:30.205 --> 00:02:31.420
LAURIEANN GIBSON: [SCREAMS]

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:32.120
I'm just teasing.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.480
That's how real you were.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.340
I was scared up here,
scared for my life.

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.410
There was a lot of athleticism
in that.

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:39.740
I mean, you were
up your levels.

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:40.560
You were down.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.380
I was really impressed,
and you know what?

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.350
I felt like you loved it.

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.360
And I mean, the athleticism
was very, very impressive.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.855
And I'm thinking as a gamer,
you might not be that--

00:02:49.855 --> 00:02:50.810
ONLYUSEmeBLADE: You nailed it.

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:51.775
LAURIEANN GIBSON: --physical,
right?

00:02:51.775 --> 00:02:52.130
ONLYUSEmeBLADE: Yeah.

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.190
LAURIEANN GIBSON: So I was
really impressed with that.

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.260
RYAN HIGA: It's a lot of
hand-eye coordination.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.110
LAURIEANN GIBSON: I
mean, you took up

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.010
the space, your staging.

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.070
You used the stage.

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.920
I mean really, all of these
elements for a non-dancer is

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.150
very, very difficult.

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.820
And there's a fearlessness that
I really appreciate in

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:08.920
your performance.

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.690
Some people might not get it,
but for me, I love that more

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:13.990
than I do a perfect routine.

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.810
ONLYUSEmeBLADE: Thank you.

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:15.565
LAURIEANN GIBSON: Well done.

00:03:15.565 --> 00:03:16.380
DOMINIC "D-TRIX" SANDOVAL:
You did it, man.

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:17.100
ONLYUSEmeBLADE: Thank you.

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.440
DOMINIC "D-TRIX"
SANDOVAL: Cool.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:18.230
Ryan, what did you think, man.

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.250
RYAN HIGA: Coming from a
non-dancer myself, I think you

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.950
did amazing.

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.090
I thought that was great.

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.970
I think my favorite moment was
just when you slapped the

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.470
money on the table just because
it just showcases your

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.200
comedy, your personality.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:30.460
Brilliant.

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:31.940
It's a good bribe too.

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:32.800
There was moments--

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.530
obviously, it's not the cleanest
performance, but like

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:36.850
I said, you're not a dancer.

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.420
Your personality, your
expressions, they carry the

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:40.470
entire performance.

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.900
And if I was watching the
show as a viewer, I

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.080
would want to subscribe.

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.740
I would want to watch.

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:45.100
ONLYUSEmeBLADE: Thank you.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.110
DOMINIC "D-TRIX" SANDOVAL:
Well done.

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.550
Joey.

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:50.520
JOEY FATONE: I mean, for me,
exactly, dancing was OK, but

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.830
you know what?

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:51.660
It didn't matter to me.

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.635
I didn't care, because
I saw the storyline.

00:03:53.635 --> 00:03:54.810
I saw what was happening.

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.160
Obviously, costumes were
executed really well.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.070
I think there was a couple of
mouth movements of the singing

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.760
of the song, which I tend
to do as well sometimes.

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.960
So it was highly entertaining
for me.

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.385
I really enjoyed it.

00:04:06.385 --> 00:04:07.005
BRINN NICOLE: Yeah.

00:04:07.005 --> 00:04:08.210
DOMINIC "D-TRIX" SANDOVAL:
Dude, it doesn't get any

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:09.070
better than that, right?

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:09.280
ONLYUSEmeBLADE: No.

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.552
It's awesome.

00:04:10.552 --> 00:04:11.450
DOMINIC "D-TRIX" SANDOVAL:
All right.

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.020
LAURIEANN GIBSON: Don't
try it, squirrel.

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:14.748
JOEY FATONE: It's ours.

00:04:14.748 --> 00:04:16.290
DOMINIC "D-TRIX" SANDOVAL:
Squirrel?

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:16.870
All right.

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.170
The money's not yours
anymore, but--

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:19.480
ONLYUSEmeBLADE: It's
out of my hands.

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.240
I'm glad you guys liked
it, so thank you.

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.690
JOEY FATONE: Yeah, no problem.

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:23.810
DOMINIC "D-TRIX"
SANDOVAL: Nice.

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.430
And Brinn, how was your time?

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.320
BRINN NICOLE: Well, one thing
that you guys don't know is

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.470
that he just quit smoking on
Friday, he just quit drinking,

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.660
and he's trying to use this
also to lose weight.

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.570
So it's like so much more than
him just being here--

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:38.260
JOEY FATONE: Good job.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:39.180
BRINN NICOLE: --to dance.

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.160
Like he used this as a catapult
to change his life.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.370
LAURIEANN GIBSON: Thank
you for being so

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.450
fearless and amazing.

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:47.060
DOMINIC "D-TRIX" SANDOVAL:
It's that time, so

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.140
good luck to you.

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:49.620
I hope you get the votes
to come back.

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:50.680
And here's your bag.

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:51.110
ONLYUSEmeBLADE: Thank you.

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.850
DOMINIC "D-TRIX" SANDOVAL:
Thank you, guys so much.

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:54.420

you, guys.
