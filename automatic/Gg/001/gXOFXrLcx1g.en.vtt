thing about detective novels even though

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.660 
thing about detective novels even though
they're<00:02:43.320> mostly<00:02:43.590> setting<00:02:44.040> the<00:02:44.190> quote<00:02:44.400> real

about<00:02:49.950> them<00:02:50.160> and<00:02:50.280> I<00:02:50.340> think<00:02:50.400> that<00:02:50.760> that's

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
about them and I think that that's

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.600 
about them and I think that that's
partly<00:02:51.420> these<00:02:52.050> moments<00:02:52.440> these<00:02:52.740> steps<00:02:53.310> if<00:02:53.520> you

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
partly these moments these steps if you

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.780 
partly these moments these steps if you
like<00:02:53.790> these<00:02:53.940> holes<00:02:54.660> in<00:02:55.020> logic<00:02:55.470> not<00:02:55.800> floors<00:02:56.340> not

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
like these holes in logic not floors not

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.900 
like these holes in logic not floors not
problems<00:02:57.390> in<00:02:57.570> logic<00:02:57.960> but<00:02:58.170> just<00:02:58.380> these<00:02:58.530> moments

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
problems in logic but just these moments

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.060 
problems in logic but just these moments
where<00:02:59.910> you<00:03:00.360> can't<00:03:00.690> see<00:03:01.020> in<00:03:01.200> I<00:03:01.500> find<00:03:01.950> that

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
where you can't see in I find that

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.670 
where you can't see in I find that
incredibly<00:03:02.400> exciting<00:03:03.000> as<00:03:03.210> a<00:03:03.930> reader<00:03:04.260> and<00:03:04.590> I

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
incredibly exciting as a reader and I

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.970 
incredibly exciting as a reader and I
really<00:03:05.070> like<00:03:05.400> those<00:03:06.330> crime<00:03:06.930> books<00:03:07.260> i<00:03:07.530> read<00:03:07.920> in

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
really like those crime books i read in

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.450 
really like those crime books i read in
which<00:03:08.970> you<00:03:09.180> can't<00:03:09.540> necessarily<00:03:09.980> follow<00:03:10.980> every

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:11.460 
which you can't necessarily follow every

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.550 
which you can't necessarily follow every
single<00:03:11.640> step<00:03:12.210> and<00:03:12.450> yet<00:03:12.900> the<00:03:12.990> whole<00:03:13.200> thing

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
single step and yet the whole thing

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.530 
single step and yet the whole thing
makes<00:03:13.800> sense<00:03:14.130> to<00:03:14.370> you<00:03:14.520> and<00:03:14.700> there's<00:03:15.090> a<00:03:15.150> slight

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
makes sense to you and there's a slight

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.810 
makes sense to you and there's a slight
sense<00:03:15.900> of<00:03:16.080> dislocation<00:03:16.440> to<00:03:17.040> it<00:03:17.130> I<00:03:17.280> find<00:03:17.730> that

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
sense of dislocation to it I find that

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.280 
sense of dislocation to it I find that
very<00:03:17.910> exciting

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
very exciting

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.349 
very exciting
you
