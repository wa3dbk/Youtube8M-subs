00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
one but this one was actually kind of

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.240 
one but this one was actually kind of
close<00:01:13.170> I<00:01:13.320> think<00:01:13.470> I<00:01:13.530> get<00:01:13.590> out<00:01:13.799> of<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:13.950> chopper

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250
