00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.929 

okay<00:01:11.880> it's<00:01:12.299> like<00:01:12.630> this<00:01:12.810> weird<00:01:13.229> shiny

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:13.939 
okay it's like this weird shiny

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:17.289 
okay it's like this weird shiny
holographic<00:01:14.939> pattern<00:01:15.600> it's<00:01:16.080> like<00:01:16.229> a<00:01:16.259> animated

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:17.299 
holographic pattern it's like a animated

you're<00:01:18.299> looking<00:01:18.630> at<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.869> back<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.350> looking

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
you're looking at the back and looking

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.690 
you're looking at the back and looking
how<00:01:20.509> different<00:01:21.509> it<00:01:21.630> looks<00:01:22.369> here<00:01:23.369> I<00:01:23.430> get<00:01:23.580> that

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
how different it looks here I get that

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.109 
how different it looks here I get that
Lily<00:01:23.909> about<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:24.390> this<00:01:24.680> so<00:01:25.680> I've<00:01:26.070> proven<00:01:26.759> these

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
Lily about and this so I've proven these

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.710 
Lily about and this so I've proven these
cards<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:27.630> be<00:01:27.750> fake<00:01:28.400> they<00:01:29.400> feel<00:01:29.939> weird<00:01:30.540> or

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
cards to be fake they feel weird or

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.020 
cards to be fake they feel weird or
flimsy<00:01:31.700> flimsy

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.730 

this<00:01:36.030> one<00:01:36.210> that's<00:01:36.390> not<00:01:36.570> so<00:01:36.810> flimsy<00:01:37.080> but<00:01:37.500> all

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
this one that's not so flimsy but all

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.039 
this one that's not so flimsy but all
Pokemon<00:01:38.250> cards<00:01:38.490> are<00:01:38.670> little<00:01:39.000> flimsy<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.869> this

Pokemon cards are little flimsy and this

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.749 
Pokemon cards are little flimsy and this
is<00:01:40.200> just<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.500> weird<00:01:40.650> holographic<00:01:41.250> pattern<00:01:41.549> and

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
is just a weird holographic pattern and

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.880 
is just a weird holographic pattern and
this<00:01:42.720> card's<00:01:43.229> not<00:01:43.409> supposed<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.770> be

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
holographic and here's my Japanese toad

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.120 
holographic and here's my Japanese toad
addict<00:01:49.880> and<00:01:50.880> see<00:01:51.090> that<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.720> foil<00:01:52.440> pattern<00:01:52.860> and

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
addict and see that the foil pattern and

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.520 
addict and see that the foil pattern and
here's<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.149> frittata<00:01:54.420> it's<00:01:54.720> a<00:01:54.810> way<00:01:55.289> different

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
here's the frittata it's a way different

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:56.870 
here's the frittata it's a way different
foil<00:01:56.130> pattern

foil pattern

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.320 
foil pattern
it's<00:01:57.450> like<00:01:57.799> holographic<00:01:58.799> e<00:01:59.180> it's<00:02:00.180> like

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
it's like holographic e it's like

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.639 
it's like holographic e it's like
laminated<00:02:01.140> it's<00:02:01.440> like<00:02:01.560> rainbow<00:02:02.009> animated<00:02:03.649> and
