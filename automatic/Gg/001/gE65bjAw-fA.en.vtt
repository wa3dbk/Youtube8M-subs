00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:33.730 
okay now let me down to the rice field

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.870 
okay now let me down to the rice field
one<00:01:34.730> thing<00:01:35.210> obviously<00:01:35.540> is<00:01:36.460> the<00:01:37.460> amount<00:01:37.760> of

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
one thing obviously is the amount of

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.860 
one thing obviously is the amount of
chlorophyll<00:01:38.480> in<00:01:38.810> the<00:01:38.870> leaves<00:01:39.200> and<00:01:40.270> to<00:01:41.270> make<00:01:41.840> a

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:41.870 
chlorophyll in the leaves and to make a

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:49.750 
chlorophyll in the leaves and to make a
comparison<00:01:47.260> right<00:01:48.260> over<00:01:48.530> there<00:01:48.740> past<00:01:49.370> all<00:01:49.610> the

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:49.760 
comparison right over there past all the

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.960 
comparison right over there past all the
weeds<00:01:50.000> you<00:01:50.960> can<00:01:51.170> see<00:01:51.410> a<00:01:51.680> small<00:01:52.130> area<00:01:52.550> it's

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
weeds you can see a small area it's

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.930 
weeds you can see a small area it's
about<00:01:53.090> an<00:01:53.330> acre<00:01:53.840> and<00:01:54.140> you<00:01:54.830> can<00:01:55.010> see<00:01:55.190> how<00:01:55.460> dark

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:55.940 
about an acre and you can see how dark

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.510 
about an acre and you can see how dark
green<00:01:56.300> now<00:01:56.960> that<00:01:57.200> had<00:01:57.410> double<00:01:57.800> applications

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
green now that had double applications

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.150 
green now that had double applications
of<00:01:58.700> biote<00:01:59.270> like<00:02:00.260> I<00:02:00.380> mentioned<00:02:00.770> I<00:02:00.860> was<00:02:00.890> here

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.160 
of biote like I mentioned I was here

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.480 
of biote like I mentioned I was here
three<00:02:01.370> weeks<00:02:01.640> ago<00:02:01.790> and<00:02:02.420> it<00:02:02.630> was<00:02:02.780> I<00:02:03.530> mean<00:02:03.890> stop

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:09.260 
green now then we go over to the next

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:13.330 
green now then we go over to the next
field<00:02:11.110> you<00:02:12.110> might<00:02:12.290> see<00:02:12.470> the<00:02:12.650> irrigation<00:02:13.010> water

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
field you might see the irrigation water

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.830 
field you might see the irrigation water
water<00:02:14.060> there<00:02:14.360> now<00:02:15.110> that<00:02:15.560> is<00:02:16.060> the<00:02:17.060> other<00:02:17.210> field

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
water there now that is the other field

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.800 
water there now that is the other field
and<00:02:18.440> you<00:02:18.710> can<00:02:18.740> see<00:02:19.040> it<00:02:19.250> is<00:02:19.550> green<00:02:20.060> but<00:02:20.360> slightly

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
and you can see it is green but slightly

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:26.140 
and you can see it is green but slightly
lighter<00:02:21.620> in<00:02:22.070> color<00:02:22.400> and<00:02:24.190> then<00:02:25.190> I<00:02:25.700> don't<00:02:26.060> know

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
lighter in color and then I don't know
