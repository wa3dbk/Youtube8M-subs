bag expecting up to six feet of water
surge<00:00:28.050> over<00:00:28.470> here<00:00:29.179> so<00:00:30.179> hopefully<00:00:31.430> it<00:00:32.430> will

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 
strong winds before over here we've had

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.520 
strong winds before over here we've had
some<00:01:55.399> Nor'easters<00:01:56.000> where<00:01:56.330> gets<00:01:57.050> up<00:01:57.229> to<00:01:57.380> be

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
some Nor'easters where gets up to be

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.279 
some Nor'easters where gets up to be
like<00:01:57.830> I<00:01:58.100> don't<00:01:58.429> know<00:01:58.610> 60<00:01:59.000> miles<00:01:59.210> an<00:01:59.390> hour<00:01:59.509> you

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:00.289 
like I don't know 60 miles an hour you

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:01.570 
like I don't know 60 miles an hour you
definitely<00:02:00.649> feel<00:02:00.800> the<00:02:01.039> building<00:02:01.190> shake<00:02:01.550> a

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
definitely feel the building shake a

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.020 
definitely feel the building shake a
little<00:02:01.789> bit<00:02:02.140> but<00:02:03.490> our<00:02:04.490> buildings<00:02:04.789> are<00:02:04.909> built

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
little bit but our buildings are built

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.559 
little bit but our buildings are built
pretty<00:02:05.330> well<00:02:05.630> so<00:02:05.990> they<00:02:06.080> can<00:02:06.259> withstand<00:02:06.440> it<00:02:06.800> but

00:02:07.559 --> 00:02:07.569 
pretty well so they can withstand it but

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:10.749 
pretty well so they can withstand it but
again<00:02:08.569> we<00:02:08.840> don't<00:02:08.959> really<00:02:09.380> want<00:02:09.590> to<00:02:09.709> deal<00:02:10.580> with

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
again we don't really want to deal with

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:12.340 
again we don't really want to deal with
100<00:02:11.090> mile<00:02:11.209> an<00:02:11.239> hour<00:02:11.420> winds<00:02:11.750> it's<00:02:12.170> just

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
100 mile an hour winds it's just

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.020 
100 mile an hour winds it's just
probably<00:02:12.530> not<00:02:13.040> the<00:02:13.190> safest<00:02:13.489> thing<00:02:13.610> for<00:02:13.940> our

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
probably not the safest thing for our

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:20.080 
probably not the safest thing for our
family<00:02:16.329> like<00:02:17.329> a<00:02:17.360> leave<00:02:17.900> me<00:02:18.049> alone<00:02:18.940> let's<00:02:19.940> go
