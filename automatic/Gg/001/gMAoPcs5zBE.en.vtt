00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.010
 tell a story that happened to me 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.710
 there are very long 

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:12.300
 sit down on the floor we can take 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:16.139
 a team has firm body weight 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:20.010
 your mouth jane kevin 15-18 will go on 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:22.529
 in the garden so there is very 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.080
 a long time I woke up in the middle 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.050
 from nowhere in an abandoned house 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.730
 I was going back and forth in this 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.830
 house to find some 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.040
 explanations 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.620
 when I went outside the landscape 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.640
 was chaotic and suddenly I saw 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.760
 a silhouette 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.160
 it was a human so I put it to him 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.350
 the question what is happening here 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.530
 it is true that he was not very 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.399
 talkative at one point he tried to me 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.500
 bite 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:56.010
 I immediately understood that it was 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:59.010
 a hobby I started running to 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.010
 through the cornfield as well as in 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.430
 fog after an hour 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:08.100
 in the fog completely 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:10.920
 disoriented I had lost hope until 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.770
 when I go lights I'm 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.619
 so I'm headed to her and there I live 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.290
 a new place a kind of factory 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:22.170
 abandoned so I started to 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.780
 look for useful things to survive 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.680
 and it is at this point that was located 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:31.439
 in a car an old rifle 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:34.229
 I then decide to kill all are bi on 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.570
 my route while continuing to search 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:41.060
 survivors who could give me 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.060
 explanations about this disaster 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:48.910
 when I get to the city I did not 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.970
 still no one on the horizon put to 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:53.740
 part of the zombies I started to believe 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:57.280
 that I was alone in the world 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:59.770
 I do not eat anything except 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.150
 an old box of tictacs guppy death 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.700
 leave can be 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:08.410
 what had taken me to buy 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:11.550
 a pair of such I continue to 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:14.920
 rode in his old sinister one day 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:17.200
 I heard an alarm off then I 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.620
 I said why not go see that 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:23.410
 closer I get to a bus depot 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:27.670
 and there I thought why not 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:30.190
 wait for the bus here about six o'clock 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.170

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.590
 alarm sounds in my big 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:39.040
 ears it was the bus I was not dreaming 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:41.410
 I decided to get in I noticed 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.660
 that the driver was a very robot 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:47.800
 talkative but without lying to you 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:50.260
 he said a little too much sea ​​without 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:53.769
 know where the bus was going to drive me 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:56.200
 the price without hesitation 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:59.440
