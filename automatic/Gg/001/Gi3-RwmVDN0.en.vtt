00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
like a thousand one hundred then you

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:02.390 
like a thousand one hundred then you
have<00:02:56.730> to<00:02:56.790> take<00:02:56.970> off<00:02:57.180> the<00:02:58.730> five<00:02:59.730> percent<00:03:01.400> so

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.790 
that's how much money you you should
make<00:03:05.220> and<00:03:05.520> then<00:03:06.060> -<00:03:07.020> 800

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
make and then - 800

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.320 
make and then - 800
you<00:03:08.730> just<00:03:08.910> made<00:03:09.260> 245<00:03:10.260> coin<00:03:11.040> profit<00:03:11.580> now<00:03:12.180> if

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
you just made 245 coin profit now if

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.690 
you just made 245 coin profit now if
you're<00:03:12.480> poor<00:03:12.780> that's<00:03:13.650> that's<00:03:14.250> a<00:03:14.340> decent

for let's say 20 cards and that's four
thousand<00:03:19.470> nine<00:03:19.500> hundred<00:03:19.650> I<00:03:20.070> mean<00:03:20.250> you<00:03:20.940> could

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
thousand nine hundred I mean you could

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.120 
thousand nine hundred I mean you could
easily<00:03:21.360> do<00:03:21.810> if<00:03:21.930> you<00:03:22.110> were<00:03:22.320> to<00:03:22.470> spend<00:03:23.070> your

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
entire day like just slaving weight.this

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.370 
entire day like just slaving weight.this
you<00:03:25.470> can<00:03:25.650> make<00:03:26.000> probably<00:03:27.000> I<00:03:27.330> would<00:03:27.690> guess<00:03:27.720> over

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
you can make probably I would guess over

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.000 
you can make probably I would guess over
20k<00:03:28.709> and<00:03:28.860> I<00:03:29.280> mean<00:03:29.459> if<00:03:29.580> you're<00:03:29.730> bankrupt<00:03:30.270> or<00:03:30.510> or
