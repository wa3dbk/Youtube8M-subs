00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:18.840
 that's it folks who's talking 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.980
 It's hobby one and welcome to one more. 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:25.009
 video this time I'm doing the 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.169
 Do not forget things in sketchbook here 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:30.300
 Good, and I'll tell a spider man I 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:32.399
 I'm doing here on the river already celebrated. 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.780
 So I drew what he 's doing in the 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.120
 Up to feed 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.450
 What I'd like you to be talking about is 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.760
 about the video today is that 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.770
 this makes it a simpler drawing or 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.080
 Looser because I'm testing 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.970
 some techniques I'll even write there 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.670
 when you make the idea is the 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:53.520
 following is to make a well-drafted version 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.110
 even and do it without shade already with color 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.920
 Then I got the character from the 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.900
 red and I decided to do it 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.280
 using this tool even the only one 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.739
 something that I will do differently than I will 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.100
 initial change was using pencil and pro 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.900
 dog for a brush, but there in the 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.790
 At the end I thought I should have done 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.159
 right side on the left side with more 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.420
 beautiful 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:19.909
 It's good because it's because of me I would like to 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.710
 to draw only on the computer and for you 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:24.439
 make four in total mainly the 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:27.939
 market is the most common is the 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:30.619
 staff do everything at hand but there are some 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:32.000
 illustrators who make direct in the 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:33.829
 computer and I think it's cool and I 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.729
 I would like to do this more 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:36.920
 practical 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:39.049
 however some testing techniques to 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.950
 try to mount a portfolio something 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:43.189
 of the type 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:45.409
 good let me explain the good wish here 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:47.689
 I'm doing the part of the hand so that 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:49.759
 I already taught you some things. 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:51.979
 It's just that something very complicated I 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:54.170
 also with difficulty to do 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.000
 for example trying to make the thumb 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.840
 Team ac.viseu would stay cool leaves 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.700
 there 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.020
 but for you to build the body of the 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.390
 character that has to be at least 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.460
 A little anatomy is not enough to know the 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:09.330
 of the muscles and such and how the 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:12.360
 People do this in the photo reference in the 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:15.209
 anatomy google search 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.799
 once used books but not 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.410
 it's more necessary balance just you 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:21.390
 looking for a year would be cleaner and 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.450
 I already know how to draw a quiet 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:27.239
 Okay, there you have to remember how 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.739
 works after uncharacteristic leave 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:33.630
 to be so real and more to the 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:37.130
 cartoonist the comic door even more 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:41.700
 did you like manga right? 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:43.500
 well I'm already doing part of the uniform and 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:47.099
 a seat for you to consider in this way 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:49.530
 What he has on his back is very simple. 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:51.120
 you build the entire line and then 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.920
 erase the details that do not 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.040
 they need neither the details nor the 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:59.849
 happy parties there will already be 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:03.260
 effect of tightening stuck on you 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:05.639
 only separated by very cool tracks make if 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.410
 already had dozens of other forms there 

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:09.170
 when you had to apply what I never 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.450
 I did it before 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.920
 It's very interesting, this is a drawing. 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.049
 I'm not worrying then 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:20.849
 very common that it will stay in the state 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:22.440
 After all, this is the real drawing. 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:25.230
 would have to reduce the number of 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.630
 arms he got a little too big is 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:30.660
 more Swiss too you can assign your 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:32.040
 style can build character is e 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.290
 leave some characteristics of it 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.660
 higher than it should be right but worth 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.060
 Sorry folks since when will you try 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.380
 drawing is closer to the real 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.569
 only it's cool you have your own 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:46.319
 style to not be all equal is by 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:47.849
 example the comics that stand out in the 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:49.919
 market only those who have a trace 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:51.299
 itself has those who are well 

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:55.709
 realistic not 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:57.329
 are legal tico the top network but in some 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:00.239
 which has its own style and also 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:02.519
 I'm glad I told you about them. 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:04.380
 The only legal return is one of my 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:07.530
 Preferred it is very different style 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:09.569
 inferred also has today madureira 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.150
 Such more personal style speaks than this. 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:14.549
 is that like the comics and I want 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:17.340
 all that way and has another 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:20.219
 example today on our mr page 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.840
 robiano facebook even liked it on 

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:25.080
 A link below only you click there 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:27.900
 write in the beautiful tanned is I left the 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:30.030
 artist named more takara brazilian 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:33.150
 in it has a pretty cool style so 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:35.219
 drawing although he does comics 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.740
 Americans even have a style 

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:40.380
 and it looks great, it's not worth 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:42.539
 sorry you're here doing - my 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:45.300
 style of light and shadow that I am 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:47.669
 Testing here I learned more or less. 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:50.969
 with the drawing is called daniel hdr 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:53.610
 It's also Brazilian, maybe I 'll go 

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:56.370
 let the link remember but it has a 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:58.979
 page on youtube on the channel on youtube and 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:01.500
 It's very cool he draws of course that 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:03.240
 he does that he cried out - but the 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.849
 what does he add what you learn 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.599
 quite tried to do more or less 

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:09.780
 like this 

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:12.950
 only in this digital version any 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:14.960
 idea is to see how it stood in the 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:16.490
 It's good to have some parts that I do not 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:19.520
 I liked it, I can give an improvement. 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:21.860
 but look only to the part of the tongue in the 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.540
 red part, then it's for you 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.640
 work a little light on what is 

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:28.850
 cool, this is not enough 

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:32.290
 credibility to the character is the situation 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:35.210
 so you can come up with a little 

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:36.560
 Shadow presented taking the parts that 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:37.850
 I know I will have shade. 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.700
 only you kind of have to specify 

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:42.290
 Where is this light coming from? 

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:44.240
 because it generates shade 

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:47.000
 When you do it, it gets easier. 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:48.740
 you get certain people was video 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.840
 I hope you enjoyed writing 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:53.200
 channel has not been enrolled in the jewel 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.200
