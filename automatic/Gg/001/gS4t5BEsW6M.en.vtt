 hello maybe the boys of new joy 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.450
 since I was little but anyway 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.070
 during the growth of the years it is me 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.950
 always liked to answer questions 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.380
 what the first six girls were doing to me 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.270

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.430
 so here I am with a series of videos 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.150
 that will be done every Friday on 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.860
 this channel 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.899
 this series is called to questions 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.489
 magic that you can do a sub 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.710
 this video or on my page 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.809
 facebook when i will make a place all the 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.930
 your questions asked madness 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.329
 nonsense will have to follow the question 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.940
 magic so if we go to see the 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.010
 questions you asked me this 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.050
 balance first question a cloak vi 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.000
 he asks where he got the things from me 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.579
 things usually know this from a site 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.059
 which is called clan 52 which is owned 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:06.150
 diego at 15 m with a lot of harmony 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.920
 Alessandro Bonetti asks me to do 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:16.409
 that is, what comes back and ladles make us 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:20.130
 see even if you are not capable gabriella 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.720
 requires 10 fingers of Puglia to this 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.240
 which opened is the most but never knows 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.590
 carmine tells me who it is how it feels to 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.810
 make writings eat 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.520
 then make magic script an emotion 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.649
 beautiful in my opinion is something that 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.960
 all of them must try 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:35.150
 because you see the faces of expectations 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.440
 and people is something fantastic 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.000
 but in my opinion they were one of the things to be 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.880
 try the one in life you want 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.060

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.330

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.330

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:11.050

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:17.980
 since yesterday is the abdominal once 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.570
 the appeals hello giovanni and then qual 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:23.980
 is the low with the heart I find myself from mine 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:25.840
 well surely with blue notes but I know 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.180
 that I'm using more during this time 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.900

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:34.390

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.550
 he asks, I know that conjurers must not 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.560
 have only dexterity but must be 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.420
 also a cultured person because in the case 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.990
 where it wasn't it would be just one 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.580
 juggle yourself how you would describe yourself 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:49.500
 Baghdad was a valentine year 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:53.020
 I still call myself an apprentice 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:55.180
 greta tells me a magic question when 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:03:00.970
 return to Milan in the square and fantasy 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:02.670

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:11.880
 half sheet eight times try the 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.880
 video and if you only want to try to 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.470

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.510
 first bloom makeup with cards that 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.959

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:36.800
 the sangro and the first flowering than at 40 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.800
 this was it 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.580
 instead the first game learned was 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.400
 peter trick 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:46.050
 francesco tells me a magic question but if i 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.590
 Your fans are coming to find you lined up 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:50.160

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:58.050
 boss was j cash because i also greet him 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:00.540
 they came from Ascoli and precisely to 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:03.480

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:06.000

 do you become for the magical half well 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:28.039
 I'm not a real magician so I don't 

00:04:25.319 --> 00:04:30.810
 you will become battered giuseppe loschiavo 

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:36.030
 correct step preferred guys my 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:38.250
 favorite step is the medal cazzata but 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.620
 in the other hand you ask me the greeting between 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:43.169
 the other that advice would you give to whom 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:45.810
 wants to enter the world of magic 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:49.380
 then the advice that is not first is 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:52.229
 to train so much to train so much of 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:55.050

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:12.620

00:05:09.569 --> 00:05:17.460
 copperfield harry potter hermione 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:19.590
