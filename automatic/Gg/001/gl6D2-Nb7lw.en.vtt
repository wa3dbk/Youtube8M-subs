something<00:02:22.410> that<00:02:22.530> we're<00:02:22.740> going<00:02:22.890> to<00:02:23.040> be

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
something that we're going to be

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.530 
something that we're going to be

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
using the repeat list data widget so go

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.200 
using the repeat list data widget so go
ahead<00:02:28.110> and<00:02:28.320> click<00:02:28.470> on<00:02:28.650> the<00:02:28.770> event<00:02:29.130> if<00:02:29.940> you<00:02:30.060> look

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
in the data preview window this makes

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.400 
in the data preview window this makes
sense<00:02:32.160> we<00:02:32.910> have<00:02:33.060> multiple<00:02:33.630> events<00:02:33.810> which<00:02:34.290> are

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
sense we have multiple events which are

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.170 
sense we have multiple events which are
going<00:02:34.590> to<00:02:34.680> be<00:02:34.770> repeated<00:02:35.250> and<00:02:35.400> these<00:02:35.850> events

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
going to be repeated and these events

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.550 
going to be repeated and these events
have<00:02:36.480> dates<00:02:36.870> titles<00:02:37.590> captions<00:02:38.130> time<00:02:38.490> and<00:02:38.820> ID's
