00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.660
 since lagos 5 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.099
 this is the option to locate the iphone for 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.160
 that you go to the settings 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.980
 and then you go down and you 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.989
 go to the tab icloud you 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.660
 go down again and you check well 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.180
 that the option locate iphone is enabled 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:49.290
 otherwise you activate the option and you 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:50.130
 click on allowed now that 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.230
 the option is enabled 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.930
 I will show you how to use it 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.829
 if someday your iphone and fly or any 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.829
 simply if you lose it so you 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.809
 you go to the website 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:06.439
 icloud.com and you enter your 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.439
 itunes identifiers 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:12.509
 then you log in and you 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:14.970
 are going to have several options to 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:18.450
 condition that your iphone is connected 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.820
 you click locate my iphone and 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.299
 so it will locate you will be able to 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:27.720
 then emit a sound activated mode 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:30.299
 lost or erase the iphone to 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.250
 distance so I repeat it must be well 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.690
 that the iphone is connected either in 3g 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.140
 either in wifi for these options 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.140
 works 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:42.079
 so now we're going to go install a 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:43.579
 tweak called rigaudiat this roof he 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:46.100
 simply allows you to take 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:48.700
 a photo via the front camera and 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.469
 locate the iphone if you lose it 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:54.109
 for that you will go to 

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:56.990
 cydia and you will go get the 

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:59.149
 roof iq aygo tia then it's free 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.509
 for in fact a duration of 10 days and 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:04.000
 then it pays $ 3 and a few 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:06.799
 so you install the tweak 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:11.840
 then once it's installed 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:17.989
 will set it up you make it into the 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:22.280
 settings and then you go down and 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:24.440
 you open the tab to gauthier from 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.480
 from there so I check the option that soon 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.359
 that a first time the wrong word of 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.970
 pass returned the tweak is so active 

00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:34.060
 for that he will take a picture so 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.530
 I activated the option take pitch pictures 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.109
 then I want to take the 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.639
 location and I do not wish 

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:43.849
 prevent so I do not layer option 

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:45.739
 chotek this message then if the button 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:49.069
 to be the iphone is in a hurry he's going 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:51.980
 take a picture take the 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:55.510
 location of the iphone and then I 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.510
 will prevent the extinction of the iphone 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.489
 so obviously the goal is to be able to 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:03.200
 retrieve this information for that 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:06.230
 you go down and there you go 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:09.220
 both entered the option to receive 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:12.799
 data via email and via SMS 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.130
 so I enter my email and then I 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:16.160
 coach 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.720
 the option also sms and I enter a 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.430
 phone number that is other than 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.500
 that of the iphone since otherwise it has not 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.790
 no interest 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.459
 now I'm going to show you what he 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.260
 happens when you receive the 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.850
 information either by e-mail or by 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.110
 sms 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:33.480
 the iphone actually provided they 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.770
 be connected in 3g or wifi goes 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.660
 send you an email with the 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:39.030
 location with more accuracy 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:41.010
 or less fifty meters an image in 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:44.760
 attached file that was taken via the 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:47.100
 front camera and if not by sms you 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:50.010
 will receive the location with 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:53.520
 a link and an image also that has been 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:55.170
 taken through the front camera and finally one 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.330
 will install something called otto 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.520
 protect which is a very interesting thing 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.590
 since it allows you to disable the 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.910
 code if ever you are connected in 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.130
 wifi that you have predefined 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.320
 before 6 and wifi is out of range 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:09.120
 the roof it will activate automatically 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.370
 and so your iphone will be locked 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.380
 by a code 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:15.480
 the tweak is free and available on 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.640
 cydia for that so you make it on 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:22.890
 cydia and you're looking for the auto tweak 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:24.900
 protect me I install it for to ie6 a 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:28.500
 once it's installed you 're doing 1st 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.040

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.650
 this tweak 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:35.070
 you'll see that there if I lock 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:37.640
 my iphone he's going to ask me for a code if 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:40.920
 I unlock it so paul roll 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:43.170
 so we will configure them this tweak you 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:44.850

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:49.350
 you go down and you go in 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:51.120
 the auto protect tab then you 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:54.180
 enter the name of the wi fi you are 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:57.830
