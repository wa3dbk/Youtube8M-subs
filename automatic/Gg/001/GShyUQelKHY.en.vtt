00:00:01.239 --> 00:00:03.580
 is 

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:09.030
 who learns Prometheus Atlas of Anatomy combines excellent graphics with 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.490
 Sophisticated that's nasty in three volumes leads us to Prometheus's 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:16.550
 essential structures of the human body in mind 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.670
 the step by step becomes the bone 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.099
 Muscles and tissues free 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:23.780
 Nauen these drawings in a class of their own 

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:26.640
 can have that none of the house painters 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.730
 and his colleague Markus episode worked for more than ten years 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:35.399
 the result is a unique representation of anatomy nowhere else 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.230
 the human body becomes so memorable and detailed 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.000
 presented so beautifully at the same time 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.790
 At the same time, the computer has long since played the role of a crayon with Karl Wesker 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:47.300
 and blocks taken over 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.810
 from the first draft 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:50.940
 to the finished picture 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.040
 before Kahl Wesker and Markus Feulner could begin to work 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.640
 the authors had to choose anatomical content to submit us rich templates 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.690
 create 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.520
 but the teenager who looks after Prometheus in Chile Verlag 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.060
 introduces the authors 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.310
 Prometheus was created by three authors 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.470
 like paper cuts from Kiel 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.410
 Photo Schumacher from Hamburg me 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:17.410
 and her shoulder from Mainz 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.090
 All three are renowned anatomy professors 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.670
 with different subject areas 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.740
 but a common passion 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.740
 the enthusiasm for teachers and didactics 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.070
 the taxidermist approaches the human body differently than the taxidermist 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:37.360
 graphic artist 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.370
 For the former, the structures are free from the outside to the inside for a considerable amount 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:44.920
 anatomical knowledge as possible 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.470
 the graphic artist goes the other way and works from the inside out 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.200
 in front 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.160
 layer by layer 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.840
 This method is also reflected in the book 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.910
 the book starts with the bones all the other structures came along first 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.910
 increasing information level of the reader in the field of vision 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.870
 yet the adolescent explains this kind of world emergence by an example 

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:11.089
 The example of the skull can be seen 

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:14.149
 The successive muscles in part, there are several layers 

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:17.799
 Pain and blood vessels are applied 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:20.859
 until a complete picture emerged 

00:02:20.859 --> 00:02:24.999
 in the computer, these structures are stored as separate building blocks 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:29.009
 This modular principle allows the draftsman 

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:33.629
 the content and didactic wishes of the authors relatively quickly 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:36.629
 what hurled and set like that 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:43.239
 And even in the age of computers, a graphic artist likes to be taken by the 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:47.609
 Values ​​of former artists inspire so no fixed to 

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:51.259
 Example emanating with the famous anatomical wax figures 

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:52.389
 APA 

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:55.669
 In addition, the energy world has lifted a very special treasure 

00:02:56.399 --> 00:03:01.460
 an original edition of anatomical studies from the offices encyclopedias 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:06.480
 the book that Teheran holds his hands dates back to 1776 

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:12.909
 Dr 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:17.159
 Of course, old masters were just a source of inspiration 

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:21.529
 most of the information came from the authors as for young people 

00:03:21.529 --> 00:03:23.659
 existed 

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:25.339
 the decision was 

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:30.879
 that the authors worked out each page of the atlas minutely in picture and text 

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:32.239
 to have 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:36.339
 For example, the graphic artists are not just picture sketches and legends 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.229
 Preparations Photos and layout designs 

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:44.400
 but especially in countless phone calls with the authors 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.649
 look forward to four performances 

00:03:46.649 --> 00:03:50.430
 especially helpful were the on-site studies in Prevalje 

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:55.989
 30 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:59.479
 under the product name Prometheus appearing Georg Thieme publishing house 

00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:04.019
 the three learn atlases on general anatomy and atlases 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:05.529
 movement system 

00:04:05.529 --> 00:04:07.039
 internal organs 

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:09.979
 Head Neck and Innovation Anatomy 

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:12.959
 as well as the learning package of Anatomy Schwerte 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:17.429
 and the anatomy learning package with access to the e-learning program my Prometheus 

00:04:17.429 --> 00:04:18.959
 land 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:25.350
 the plans of Anatomy are available as a box with 367 flashcards and as an app 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:28.350
 for iPhone and iPod has 

00:04:42.499 --> 00:04:45.379
 so sinks 

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:48.249
 or so 

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:51.459
 so everything about Prometheus learn here
