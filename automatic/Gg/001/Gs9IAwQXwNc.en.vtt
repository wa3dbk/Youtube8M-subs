this<00:00:34.739> is<00:00:34.950> how<00:00:35.100> it<00:00:35.280> needs<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:35.640> be<00:00:35.730> remained<00:00:36.090> I

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
this is how it needs to be remained I

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.150 
this is how it needs to be remained I
tried<00:00:36.480> a<00:00:36.510> different<00:00:36.570> option<00:00:37.200> clearly<00:00:37.860> didn't

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
tried a different option clearly didn't

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.580 
tried a different option clearly didn't
work<00:00:38.340> so<00:00:38.690> this<00:00:39.690> is<00:00:39.809> take<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:39.989> good<00:00:40.079> look<00:00:40.320> at<00:00:40.469> this

going<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.440> want<00:00:43.649> to<00:00:43.739> keep<00:00:44.640> four<00:00:44.879> channels<00:00:45.149> 1

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
going to want to keep four channels 1

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.380 
going to want to keep four channels 1
through<00:00:45.450> 4<00:00:45.690> s<00:00:46.350> bus<00:00:46.710> this<00:00:47.700> is<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.879> second<00:00:48.239> set

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
through 4 s bus this is the second set

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.760 
through 4 s bus this is the second set
okay<00:00:48.719> I've<00:00:49.170> got<00:00:50.059> channel<00:00:51.059> 5<00:00:51.239> as<00:00:51.420> my<00:00:51.510> LD<00:00:51.899> that's

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
okay I've got channel 5 as my LD that's

okay I've got channel 5 as my LD that's
my<00:00:52.949> knob<00:00:53.190> here<00:00:53.399> this<00:00:53.699> is<00:00:53.879> what<00:00:54.059> controls<00:00:54.449> my

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
my knob here this is what controls my

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.720 
my knob here this is what controls my
gain<00:00:54.989> so<00:00:55.379> I<00:00:55.410> mean<00:00:55.710> I<00:00:55.739> can<00:00:55.980> control<00:00:56.340> my<00:00:56.460> gain

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
gain so I mean I can control my gain

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.819 
gain so I mean I can control my gain
lower<00:00:57.629> it<00:00:57.809> increase<00:00:58.170> my<00:00:58.350> gain

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
lower it increase my gain

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.650 
lower it increase my gain
that's<00:00:59.789> going<00:00:59.879> to<00:00:59.969> be<00:01:00.030> gains<00:01:00.239> for<00:01:00.390> analysis

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
that's going to be gains for analysis

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.810 
that's going to be gains for analysis
that<00:01:00.780> I<00:01:00.809> have<00:01:00.989> preset<00:01:01.440> 2<00:01:01.559> X<00:01:01.739> 1<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.370> I'll<00:01:02.609> show

where I have manual out GPS ok this is

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.660 
where I have manual out GPS ok this is
also<00:01:37.409> a<00:01:37.560> switch<00:01:37.740> that<00:01:37.920> I<00:01:37.979> use<00:01:38.130> for<00:01:38.340> forced

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
also a switch that I use for forced

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.270 
also a switch that I use for forced
failsafe<00:01:38.880> in<00:01:39.689> all<00:01:39.869> positions<00:01:40.079> so<00:01:41.009> no<00:01:41.130> matter

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
failsafe in all positions so no matter

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.219 
failsafe in all positions so no matter
what<00:01:41.549> I<00:01:41.759> can<00:01:42.000> get<00:01:42.119> enforce<00:01:42.450> trail<00:01:42.720> safe<00:01:42.990> on<00:01:43.170> all

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
what I can get enforce trail safe on all

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.950 
what I can get enforce trail safe on all
positions<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:43.920> I'll<00:01:44.009> definitely<00:01:44.460> show<00:01:44.640> that

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
positions and I'll definitely show that

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.620 
positions and I'll definitely show that
here<00:01:45.960> it's<00:01:46.079> far<00:01:46.259> as<00:01:46.380> setup<00:01:46.560> so<00:01:47.070> that's<00:01:47.759> that's

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
here it's far as setup so that's that's

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.300 
here it's far as setup so that's that's
the<00:01:48.990> channels<00:01:49.320> 1<00:01:49.470> through<00:01:49.649> 7<00:01:49.950> that<00:01:50.070> I'm<00:01:50.159> using

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
the channels 1 through 7 that I'm using

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.020 
the channels 1 through 7 that I'm using
6<00:01:50.759> being<00:01:51.170> taken<00:01:52.170> out<00:01:52.259> obviously<00:01:52.759> I'll<00:01:53.759> go<00:01:53.909> to

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
6 being taken out obviously I'll go to

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.399 
6 being taken out obviously I'll go to
the<00:01:54.119> other<00:01:54.270> ones<00:01:54.450> basically<00:01:54.840> Bank<00:01:55.200> them<00:01:55.350> all

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
the other ones basically Bank them all

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.459 
the other ones basically Bank them all
out<00:01:55.560> I'm<00:01:55.979> not<00:01:56.130> using<00:01:56.250> anything<00:01:56.520> else<00:01:56.759> ok<00:01:57.469> so

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
out I'm not using anything else ok so

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.929 
out I'm not using anything else ok so
that's<00:01:59.430> going<00:01:59.759> to<00:01:59.850> be<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.240> function<00:02:00.509> menu

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:01.939 
that's going to be the function menu

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:03.999 
that's going to be the function menu
reverse<00:02:02.939> this<00:02:03.119> is<00:02:03.270> just<00:02:03.420> kind<00:02:03.540> of<00:02:03.570> depends

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:04.009 
reverse this is just kind of depends

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:06.469 
reverse this is just kind of depends

up

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
up

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.949 
up
there<00:02:12.959> five<00:02:13.860> have<00:02:14.459> that<00:02:14.700> reversed<00:02:15.120> that's

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
there five have that reversed that's

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.860 
there five have that reversed that's
what<00:02:16.290> worked<00:02:16.470> for<00:02:16.650> my<00:02:17.069> for<00:02:18.060> my<00:02:18.090> enough<00:02:18.360> so<00:02:18.630> left

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.140 
what worked for my for my enough so left
was<00:02:19.020> negative<00:02:19.500> right<00:02:20.040> is<00:02:20.190> positive<00:02:20.610> for<00:02:21.060> the

was negative right is positive for the
assistant<00:02:21.660> for<00:02:24.380> four<00:02:25.380> do<00:02:25.470> you<00:02:25.530> gain<00:02:25.709> control

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
assistant for four do you gain control

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.059 
assistant for four do you gain control
six<00:02:26.849> I<00:02:27.090> have<00:02:27.330> it<00:02:27.450> reversed<00:02:27.720> right<00:02:27.870> now

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
six I have it reversed right now

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:30.140 
six I have it reversed right now
obviously<00:02:29.069> like<00:02:29.190> I<00:02:29.250> said<00:02:29.400> I'm<00:02:29.489> not<00:02:29.610> using<00:02:29.790> six

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
obviously like I said I'm not using six

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.309 
obviously like I said I'm not using six

I pull forward that'll be changing into
the<00:02:46.530> different<00:02:46.799> modes<00:02:46.950> so<00:02:47.190> I<00:02:47.400> have<00:02:47.880> that<00:02:48.030> as

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
assistant program is you're going to

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.400 
assistant program is you're going to
find<00:03:15.480> your<00:03:15.599> desired<00:03:15.900> failsafe

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
find your desired failsafe

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.710 
find your desired failsafe
Naza<00:03:16.920> requires<00:03:17.430> minimum<00:03:17.850> ten<00:03:18.090> percent<00:03:18.540> so

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
Naza requires minimum ten percent so

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.860 
Naza requires minimum ten percent so
let's<00:03:19.019> just<00:03:19.410> say<00:03:19.530> I<00:03:19.560> went<00:03:19.980> about<00:03:20.870> 25-30

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
let's just say I went about 25-30

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.150 
let's just say I went about 25-30
percent<00:03:21.959> just<00:03:22.590> to<00:03:22.650> be<00:03:22.769> on<00:03:22.859> the<00:03:22.890> safe<00:03:23.130> side

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
percent just to be on the safe side

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.160 
percent just to be on the safe side
anything<00:03:23.579> above<00:03:23.790> 10<00:03:23.940> percent<00:03:24.000> okay<00:03:24.660> so<00:03:25.140> I

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
anything above 10 percent okay so I

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.740 
anything above 10 percent okay so I
basically<00:03:25.440> go<00:03:25.890> here<00:03:26.190> and<00:03:26.340> it<00:03:27.030> usually<00:03:27.299> comes

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
basically go here and it usually comes

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.050 
basically go here and it usually comes

it to two FS for fail-safes you go to

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:34.490 
it to two FS for fail-safes you go to
this<00:03:33.000> and<00:03:33.269> it<00:03:33.390> says<00:03:33.540> hold<00:03:33.810> one<00:03:33.959> second<00:03:34.319> so<00:03:34.410> you

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
this and it says hold one second so you

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.430 
this and it says hold one second so you
literally<00:03:35.510> push<00:03:36.510> this<00:03:36.720> Return<00:03:37.049> button<00:03:37.079> in<00:03:37.380> the

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
literally push this Return button in the

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:38.780 
literally push this Return button in the
middle<00:03:37.530> and<00:03:37.680> you<00:03:37.859> hold<00:03:38.040> it<00:03:38.100> for<00:03:38.220> one<00:03:38.250> second<00:03:38.670> it

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
middle and you hold it for one second it

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.069 
middle and you hold it for one second it
locks<00:03:39.060> that<00:03:39.840> position<00:03:40.350> okay<00:03:41.630> you<00:03:42.630> can<00:03:42.780> go<00:03:42.870> back

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.079 
locks that position okay you can go back

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:44.809 
locks that position okay you can go back
you<00:03:43.109> can<00:03:43.470> put<00:03:43.829> it<00:03:43.920> back<00:03:44.040> down<00:03:44.220> after<00:03:44.579> you<00:03:44.670> do

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 
you can put it back down after you do

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:47.539 
you can put it back down after you do
that<00:03:45.049> here's<00:03:46.049> the<00:03:46.200> other<00:03:46.290> one<00:03:46.380> years<00:03:46.889> this<00:03:47.340> is

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
that here's the other one years this is

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:49.009 
that here's the other one years this is
going<00:03:47.670> to<00:03:47.760> have<00:03:47.910> to<00:03:48.030> do<00:03:48.150> with<00:03:48.269> end<00:03:48.510> point<00:03:48.810> this

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
going to have to do with end point this

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:50.390 
going to have to do with end point this
is<00:03:49.170> what<00:03:49.350> actually<00:03:49.530> in<00:03:49.889> the<00:03:49.980> assistant

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
is what actually in the assistant

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.949 
is what actually in the assistant
software<00:03:50.579> puts<00:03:51.209> everything<00:03:51.540> in<00:03:51.840> that

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
software puts everything in that

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.759 
software puts everything in that
failsafe<00:03:52.290> position<00:03:53.069> for<00:03:54.060> your<00:03:54.209> when<00:03:55.139> you<00:03:55.230> turn

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
failsafe position for your when you turn

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:57.289 
failsafe position for your when you turn
the<00:03:55.859> transmitter<00:03:56.160> off<00:03:56.430> okay<00:03:56.850> so<00:03:56.910> that's<00:03:57.150> going

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
the transmitter off okay so that's going

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:58.610 
the transmitter off okay so that's going
to<00:03:57.359> be<00:03:57.450> your<00:03:57.540> failsafe<00:03:57.750> for<00:03:58.109> loss<00:03:58.260> of<00:03:58.440> signal

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
to be your failsafe for loss of signal

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.229 
to be your failsafe for loss of signal
transmitter<00:03:59.250> loss<00:03:59.430> you'll<00:03:59.700> see<00:03:59.910> that<00:04:00.030> in<00:04:00.180> the

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
transmitter loss you'll see that in the

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:01.670 
transmitter loss you'll see that in the
assistant<00:04:00.660> as<00:04:00.720> well<00:04:00.750> but<00:04:01.049> that<00:04:01.109> was<00:04:01.470> the

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
assistant as well but that was the

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.789 
assistant as well but that was the
percentage<00:04:02.220> that<00:04:02.250> got<00:04:02.609> the<00:04:03.180> little<00:04:03.329> indicator

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:03.799 
percentage that got the little indicator

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:07.160 
percentage that got the little indicator
basically<00:04:04.799> to<00:04:04.920> slide<00:04:05.310> over<00:04:05.519> to<00:04:05.549> failsafe<00:04:06.170> so

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
basically to slide over to failsafe so

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.199 
basically to slide over to failsafe so
you'll<00:04:07.500> see<00:04:07.680> that<00:04:07.829> in<00:04:07.980> the<00:04:08.130> video<00:04:08.910> the<00:04:09.060> same

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
you'll see that in the video the same

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:11.030 
you'll see that in the video the same
same<00:04:09.510> process<00:04:09.959> now<00:04:10.470> that's<00:04:10.650> going<00:04:10.769> to<00:04:10.829> be<00:04:10.950> done

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
same process now that's going to be done

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.520 
same process now that's going to be done
off<00:04:11.160> endpoints<00:04:11.700> so<00:04:11.959> that<00:04:12.959> kind<00:04:13.139> of<00:04:13.200> brings<00:04:13.350> me

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
off endpoints so that kind of brings me

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:18.640 
off endpoints so that kind of brings me
to<00:04:13.739> the<00:04:13.829> to<00:04:13.950> the<00:04:14.069> endpoint<00:04:14.280> section

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:20.930 

you<00:04:19.650> notice<00:04:19.950> everything<00:04:20.070> is<00:04:20.400> just<00:04:20.580> left<00:04:20.790> alone

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
you notice everything is just left alone

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.790 
you notice everything is just left alone
the<00:04:21.600> way<00:04:21.720> came<00:04:21.989> here<00:04:22.260> channels<00:04:22.650> one<00:04:22.770> through

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
the way came here channels one through

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.340 
the way came here channels one through
four<00:04:23.220> you<00:04:24.180> see<00:04:24.210> the<00:04:24.450> only<00:04:24.570> one<00:04:24.780> that<00:04:24.870> I<00:04:24.930> changed

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
four you see the only one that I changed

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.070 
four you see the only one that I changed
for<00:04:25.650> now<00:04:25.770> the<00:04:26.010> only<00:04:26.130> one<00:04:26.280> I<00:04:26.340> changed<00:04:26.730> now<00:04:27.030> I

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
for now the only one I changed now I

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.300 
for now the only one I changed now I
don't<00:04:28.080> know<00:04:28.170> if<00:04:28.260> I'll<00:04:28.380> have<00:04:28.590> to<00:04:28.860> go<00:04:28.950> back<00:04:28.980> and

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
don't know if I'll have to go back and

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.070 
don't know if I'll have to go back and
change<00:04:29.490> six<00:04:29.850> if<00:04:29.970> I<00:04:30.060> ever<00:04:30.180> do<00:04:30.420> the<00:04:30.540> intelligent

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
change six if I ever do the intelligent

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.230 
change six if I ever do the intelligent
orientation<00:04:31.650> control<00:04:31.830> or<00:04:32.160> not<00:04:32.190> if<00:04:32.490> not<00:04:32.760> it's

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
orientation control or not if not it's

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.940 
orientation control or not if not it's
going<00:04:33.330> to<00:04:33.390> remain<00:04:33.570> like<00:04:33.690> this<00:04:33.750> gear<00:04:34.230> this<00:04:34.770> is

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:34.950 
going to remain like this gear this is

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:37.460 
going to remain like this gear this is
what<00:04:35.190> you'll<00:04:35.820> see<00:04:35.910> actually<00:04:36.750> pushes<00:04:37.200> in<00:04:37.410> the

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
what you'll see actually pushes in the

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.970 
what you'll see actually pushes in the
assistant<00:04:38.010> software<00:04:38.330> gets<00:04:39.330> you<00:04:39.630> to<00:04:40.470> actually

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:40.980 
assistant software gets you to actually

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.670 
assistant software gets you to actually
have<00:04:41.190> your<00:04:41.400> indicator<00:04:41.970> line<00:04:42.570> up<00:04:42.840> with<00:04:43.110> manual

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
have your indicator line up with manual

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.640 
have your indicator line up with manual
altitude<00:04:44.460> and<00:04:44.610> GPS<00:04:45.000> at<00:04:45.960> a<00:04:46.020> hundred<00:04:46.290> percent

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
altitude and GPS at a hundred percent

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:47.690 
altitude and GPS at a hundred percent
it's<00:04:46.800> not<00:04:46.950> going<00:04:47.130> to<00:04:47.190> line<00:04:47.340> up<00:04:47.370> it's<00:04:47.550> going<00:04:47.640> to

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:47.700 
it's not going to line up it's going to

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.390 
it's not going to line up it's going to
be<00:04:47.820> off<00:04:47.970> okay

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 
be off okay

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.740 
be off okay
so<00:04:50.400> that<00:04:50.610> was<00:04:50.820> here<00:04:51.060> now<00:04:51.180> the<00:04:51.240> end<00:04:51.480> point<00:04:51.720> that

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
so that was here now the end point that

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.900 
so that was here now the end point that
I<00:04:51.870> use<00:04:52.080> to<00:04:52.230> do<00:04:52.380> that<00:04:52.530> failsafe<00:04:52.860> for<00:04:53.160> throttle<00:04:53.760> I

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:53.910 
I use to do that failsafe for throttle I

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.060 
I use to do that failsafe for throttle I
was<00:04:54.540> then<00:04:54.690> I<00:04:54.870> ended<00:04:55.050> up<00:04:55.140> in<00:04:55.290> like<00:04:55.500> the<00:04:55.680> forty

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
was then I ended up in like the forty

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:57.620 
was then I ended up in like the forty
percent<00:04:56.250> range<00:04:56.640> so<00:04:57.060> what<00:04:57.180> you<00:04:57.270> do<00:04:57.390> is<00:04:57.480> you<00:04:57.540> go

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
percent range so what you do is you go

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.390 
percent range so what you do is you go
to<00:04:57.660> 40<00:04:58.110> and<00:04:58.200> you'll<00:04:58.350> manage<00:04:58.770> this<00:04:59.100> on<00:04:59.310> the

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
to 40 and you'll manage this on the

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:00.380 
to 40 and you'll manage this on the
assistant<00:04:59.850> I'll<00:04:59.970> show<00:05:00.150> you<00:05:00.270> that

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:00.390 
assistant I'll show you that

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:03.050 
assistant I'll show you that
step-by-step<00:05:01.050> as<00:05:01.200> well<00:05:01.460> once<00:05:02.460> you<00:05:02.670> get<00:05:02.880> it

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
step-by-step as well once you get it

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.700 
step-by-step as well once you get it
down<00:05:03.270> you<00:05:03.330> scrolling<00:05:03.930> around<00:05:04.200> so<00:05:04.380> you<00:05:04.470> click

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710 
down you scrolling around so you click

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.120 
down you scrolling around so you click
on<00:05:04.860> it<00:05:05.010> you<00:05:05.130> basically<00:05:05.280> scroll<00:05:06.000> let's<00:05:06.810> say

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.130 
on it you basically scroll let's say

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:09.650 
on it you basically scroll let's say
let's<00:05:08.130> say<00:05:08.250> here's<00:05:08.460> failsafe<00:05:08.730> right<00:05:09.270> here<00:05:09.480> at

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:09.660 
let's say here's failsafe right here at

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.370 
let's say here's failsafe right here at
40<00:05:10.110> once<00:05:10.920> it's<00:05:11.160> there<00:05:11.250> you<00:05:11.670> go<00:05:12.090> back<00:05:12.540> to<00:05:13.260> your

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.380 
40 once it's there you go back to your

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.620 
40 once it's there you go back to your
failsafe<00:05:13.620> you<00:05:14.460> hit<00:05:14.640> that<00:05:14.850> we<00:05:15.210> have<00:05:15.420> for<00:05:15.570> them

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:15.630 
failsafe you hit that we have for them

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:18.470 
failsafe you hit that we have for them
to<00:05:15.780> come<00:05:15.930> back<00:05:16.110> here<00:05:16.350> you<00:05:16.530> end<00:05:16.680> point<00:05:17.420> you<00:05:18.420> need

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:18.480 
to come back here you end point you need

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.930 
to come back here you end point you need
to<00:05:18.630> change<00:05:18.960> it<00:05:19.260> back<00:05:19.440> it's<00:05:20.400> one<00:05:20.640> thing<00:05:20.880> that

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:20.940 
to change it back it's one thing that

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:25.370 
to change it back it's one thing that
somebody<00:05:21.810> may<00:05:21.960> forget<00:05:22.260> to<00:05:22.320> do<00:05:22.940> okay<00:05:23.940> so<00:05:24.380> that

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:25.380 
somebody may forget to do okay so that

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:32.750 
somebody may forget to do okay so that
was<00:05:25.710> the<00:05:26.270> endpoint<00:05:27.270> position<00:05:31.490> now<00:05:32.490> here's<00:05:32.669> the

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:32.760 
was the endpoint position now here's the

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:33.800 
was the endpoint position now here's the
program<00:05:32.940> X<00:05:33.270> this<00:05:33.390> is<00:05:33.480> what<00:05:33.570> you're<00:05:33.660> going<00:05:33.780> to

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:33.810 
program X this is what you're going to

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:36.650 
program X this is what you're going to
need<00:05:33.930> to<00:05:34.020> use<00:05:34.230> in<00:05:34.410> order<00:05:34.560> to<00:05:34.680> get<00:05:34.890> your<00:05:35.660> forced

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:36.660 
need to use in order to get your forced

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:38.530 
need to use in order to get your forced
failsafe<00:05:36.990> and<00:05:37.530> when<00:05:37.680> I<00:05:37.710> mean<00:05:37.919> forced<00:05:38.250> failsafe

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:38.540 
failsafe and when I mean forced failsafe

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:40.909 
failsafe and when I mean forced failsafe
you're<00:05:39.540> going<00:05:39.660> to<00:05:39.720> want<00:05:39.900> this<00:05:40.080> this<00:05:40.500> is<00:05:40.710> what's

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:40.919 
you're going to want this this is what's

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:45.260 
you're going to want this this is what's
going<00:05:41.040> to<00:05:41.100> force<00:05:41.550> failsafe<00:05:42.169> okay<00:05:44.150> so<00:05:45.150> you're

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:45.270 
going to force failsafe okay so you're

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:47.740 
going to force failsafe okay so you're
going<00:05:45.419> to<00:05:45.480> do<00:05:45.570> a<00:05:45.600> mix<00:05:45.870> your<00:05:46.080> gear<00:05:46.290> channel

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:47.750 
going to do a mix your gear channel

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:49.850 
going to do a mix your gear channel
reason<00:05:48.750> being<00:05:48.930> is<00:05:49.110> this<00:05:49.290> is<00:05:49.500> your<00:05:49.680> gear

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860 
reason being is this is your gear

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:51.770 
reason being is this is your gear
channel<00:05:50.220> okay<00:05:51.060> so<00:05:51.120> this<00:05:51.330> is<00:05:51.480> your<00:05:51.600> gear

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:51.780 
channel okay so this is your gear

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:53.630 
channel okay so this is your gear
channel<00:05:52.080> so<00:05:52.169> you're<00:05:52.290> mixing<00:05:52.710> this<00:05:52.890> that<00:05:53.520> way

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:53.640 
channel so you're mixing this that way

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:54.740 
channel so you're mixing this that way
you're<00:05:53.760> going<00:05:53.820> to<00:05:53.940> have<00:05:54.060> the<00:05:54.180> ability<00:05:54.540> to<00:05:54.570> have

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:54.750 
you're going to have the ability to have

00:05:54.750 --> 00:06:00.710 
you're going to have the ability to have
when<00:05:55.080> you<00:05:55.230> trigger<00:05:56.570> your<00:05:57.570> failsafe<00:05:58.760> option<00:05:59.790> it

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:00.720 
when you trigger your failsafe option it

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.240 
when you trigger your failsafe option it
changes<00:06:01.169> the<00:06:01.320> position<00:06:01.770> of<00:06:01.950> your<00:06:02.070> gear

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:02.250 
changes the position of your gear

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:05.320 
changes the position of your gear
channel<00:06:02.840> so<00:06:03.840> you'll<00:06:03.990> notice<00:06:04.140> here<00:06:04.260> got<00:06:04.830> five

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:05.330 
channel so you'll notice here got five

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:08.030 
channel so you'll notice here got five
three<00:06:06.330> and<00:06:06.600> two<00:06:06.840> notice<00:06:07.620> how<00:06:07.740> it<00:06:07.800> brings

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:08.040 
three and two notice how it brings

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:11.600 
three and two notice how it brings
across<00:06:08.370> the<00:06:08.520> spectrum<00:06:08.760> here<00:06:09.500> okay<00:06:10.500> so<00:06:10.740> this<00:06:11.430> is

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:11.610 
across the spectrum here okay so this is

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:13.760 
across the spectrum here okay so this is
my<00:06:11.640> position<00:06:12.180> five<00:06:12.720> because<00:06:13.020> I<00:06:13.080> have<00:06:13.200> it<00:06:13.290> back

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:13.770 
my position five because I have it back

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:16.430 
my position five because I have it back
so<00:06:14.280> that's<00:06:14.430> position<00:06:14.850> five<00:06:15.440> that's

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:16.440 
so that's position five that's

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.230 
so that's position five that's
positioned<00:06:16.770> to<00:06:17.040> which<00:06:17.160> is<00:06:17.280> altitude<00:06:17.760> that's

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:18.240 
positioned to which is altitude that's

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:22.190 
positioned to which is altitude that's
GPS<00:06:18.780> so<00:06:19.140> GPS<00:06:19.620> altitude<00:06:20.310> manual<00:06:21.210> that's<00:06:21.870> once

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:22.200 
GPS so GPS altitude manual that's once

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:27.560 
GPS so GPS altitude manual that's once
again<00:06:23.030> this<00:06:24.030> position<00:06:24.510> switch<00:06:25.220> okay<00:06:26.510> now<00:06:27.510> you

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:27.570 
again this position switch okay now you

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:28.850 
again this position switch okay now you
can<00:06:27.690> do<00:06:27.900> this<00:06:28.020> mixing<00:06:28.320> but<00:06:28.440> it's<00:06:28.560> not<00:06:28.650> going<00:06:28.800> to

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:28.860 
can do this mixing but it's not going to

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:30.090 
can do this mixing but it's not going to
be<00:06:28.950> active

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:30.100 
be active

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:31.830 
be active
so<00:06:30.580> you<00:06:30.640> come<00:06:30.910> in<00:06:31.030> here<00:06:31.240> and<00:06:31.360> select<00:06:31.690> right

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:31.840 
so you come in here and select right

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:32.610 
so you come in here and select right
here<00:06:31.900> right<00:06:32.140> there<00:06:32.170> it's<00:06:32.410> going<00:06:32.500> to<00:06:32.560> show

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:32.620 
here right there it's going to show

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:35.400 
here right there it's going to show
inhibit<00:06:33.390> right<00:06:34.390> now<00:06:34.510> it<00:06:34.660> shows<00:06:34.750> off<00:06:35.020> the<00:06:35.230> only

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:35.410 
inhibit right now it shows off the only

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:36.780 
inhibit right now it shows off the only
reason<00:06:35.680> it<00:06:35.770> shows<00:06:35.920> off<00:06:36.130> is<00:06:36.280> because<00:06:36.430> I<00:06:36.520> have<00:06:36.670> my

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:36.790 
reason it shows off is because I have my

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:39.510 
reason it shows off is because I have my
position<00:06:37.000> off<00:06:37.710> so<00:06:38.710> when<00:06:38.830> I<00:06:38.860> go<00:06:39.040> on<00:06:39.190> you'll<00:06:39.430> see

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:39.520 
position off so when I go on you'll see

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:41.670 
position off so when I go on you'll see
a<00:06:39.610> change<00:06:39.940> it's<00:06:40.720> off<00:06:40.870> when<00:06:41.080> I<00:06:41.110> flip<00:06:41.380> forward

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:41.680 
a change it's off when I flip forward

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:45.030 
a change it's off when I flip forward
for<00:06:42.100> my<00:06:42.190> forced<00:06:42.610> failsafe<00:06:43.170> turns<00:06:44.170> it<00:06:44.320> on<00:06:44.440> what

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:45.040 
for my forced failsafe turns it on what

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:46.830 
for my forced failsafe turns it on what
that<00:06:45.190> does<00:06:45.310> is<00:06:45.430> that<00:06:45.460> master<00:06:46.090> slave<00:06:46.660> it

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:46.840 
that does is that master slave it

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:49.380 
that does is that master slave it
overrides<00:06:47.260> the<00:06:47.410> gear<00:06:47.940> and<00:06:48.940> puts<00:06:49.180> it<00:06:49.270> into

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:49.390 
overrides the gear and puts it into

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:51.660 
overrides the gear and puts it into
failsafe<00:06:49.800> no<00:06:50.800> matter<00:06:50.980> what<00:06:51.160> position<00:06:51.310> you're

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:51.670 
failsafe no matter what position you're

00:06:51.670 --> 00:07:04.530 
failsafe no matter what position you're
at<00:07:00.840> just<00:07:01.840> to<00:07:01.990> see<00:07:02.200> that<00:07:02.230> again<00:07:03.270> so<00:07:04.270> I'm<00:07:04.360> in

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:04.540 
at just to see that again so I'm in

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:06.510 
at just to see that again so I'm in
manual<00:07:05.050> right<00:07:05.230> now<00:07:05.440> I<00:07:05.710> want<00:07:06.310> to<00:07:06.370> go<00:07:06.460> to

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:06.520 
manual right now I want to go to

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:10.200 
manual right now I want to go to
altitude<00:07:07.560> goes<00:07:08.560> there<00:07:08.920> that<00:07:09.370> will<00:07:09.580> ensure

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:10.210 
altitude goes there that will ensure

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:12.030 
altitude goes there that will ensure
that<00:07:10.240> when<00:07:10.480> I<00:07:10.540> flip<00:07:10.750> my<00:07:10.960> failsafe<00:07:11.200> on<00:07:11.620> see<00:07:11.980> how

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:12.040 
that when I flip my failsafe on see how

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.770 
that when I flip my failsafe on see how
it's<00:07:12.190> off<00:07:12.340> and<00:07:12.490> on<00:07:12.640> it<00:07:13.240> triggers<00:07:13.630> that

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:13.780 
it's off and on it triggers that

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:17.370 
it's off and on it triggers that
failsafe<00:07:14.050> okay<00:07:14.770> when<00:07:15.370> I<00:07:15.400> go<00:07:15.580> to<00:07:15.640> GPS<00:07:16.390> I'm<00:07:17.050> in

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:17.380 
failsafe okay when I go to GPS I'm in
