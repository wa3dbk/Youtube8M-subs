I dude the mandala 323 number two
we<00:06:03.140> structure<00:06:03.800> rediff<00:06:05.080> inspector<00:06:06.080> stuff<00:06:06.530> and

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:07.100 
we structure rediff inspector stuff and

we structure rediff inspector stuff and
number<00:06:07.640> one<00:06:08.740> FN<00:06:09.740> FAL<00:06:10.070> with<00:06:10.430> Python<00:06:10.880> all<00:06:11.150> this

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:11.360 
number one FN FAL with Python all this

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.630 
number one FN FAL with Python all this
there<00:06:11.510> so<00:06:11.750> it<00:06:11.900> goes<00:06:12.110> Harding<00:06:12.620> hacker<00:06:13.039> what

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:13.640 
there so it goes Harding hacker what

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.240 
there so it goes Harding hacker what
social<00:06:13.880> psychology<00:06:14.450> but<00:06:15.140> ups<00:06:15.410> I<00:06:15.680> thought<00:06:16.070> this

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:19.010 
kind of Python for a or shotgun well

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:23.470 
kind of Python for a or shotgun well
alright<00:06:19.910> then<00:06:19.940> guys<00:06:20.470> later
