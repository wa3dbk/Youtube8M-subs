00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.540
 this type of intelligence is elaborated more 

00:00:02.189 --> 00:00:04.860
 that not only in the eighties and peak in the 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.690
 83 

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:09.540
 but already the cerebral gymnastics has already been 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.969
 created in the seventies doctor for 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.679
 improve this kind of skills 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.139
 Multiple intelligences did not have this 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.539
 theory but it was already thought that there 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.149
 exercises and coordination 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.679
 improve overall performance one of 

00:00:21.149 --> 00:00:25.890
 them is for example that is very 

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:29.039
 recognized this touching the table or touching of 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:32.160
 the legs and cross contrary in 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:36.420
 hand not the hand touching the nose with the 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.739
 ear and then it would be a thing 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.010
 fast 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.469
 How about if you need we can practice or 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.379
 be these touched the legs touch the 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:49.769
 legs and cross them exactly to do 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:52.379
 these heavy promo promote what is 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:53.969
 inter brain connection of the two 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.519
 hemispheres of the left hemisphere that 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.730
 is the mathematical logic and the right that 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:01.739
 is the creative one of the emotions 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:04.089
 then we could do another one that is 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:08.229
 this doctor 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:11.729
 and the little finger of the other hand and also 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:14.679
 we are going to facilitate clear to make 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.899
 raise the index and little finger of the 

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:20.709
 opposite hand of the other hand 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:23.560
 this also produces more speed in the 

00:01:20.709 --> 00:01:25.810
 transmission of neurons then 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.959
 there is also this one of points number 4 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:31.319
 and indicate with the thumb towards the 

00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:31.319
 hand 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.400
 then more difficult are this circle 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.310
 inward and the circle outward 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.370
 at the same time it is another great exercise 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.290
 for the two for both sides a 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:50.220
 circle inwards and another one towards 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:53.580
 outside another one could become with the 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:56.940
 foot we could indicate a circle and 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:59.370
 while we draw a 6 with the hand 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.680
 It is very difficult that and another one for 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:05.000
 example a circle with one hand and a 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.000
 square with the other 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:12.030
 and then we change it a circle can 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.270
 be in and out and a 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:18.990
 square drawing with the other hand this 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.700
 allows us to have this 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.450
 coordination of the two hemispheres 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:26.790
 cerebral very well 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:30.720
 we're going to talk like that because we're going 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:33.240
 to go back and call to call says I 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.030
 I have another exercise to see call 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.280
 to the one with the thumb and the index you know 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.970
 How is it 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:43.480
 but think there and there we will see it 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.640
 another exercise 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.930
 who is practicing this week and I 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.930
 he called attention to see how it is 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:59.170
 thumb and pinky so ok 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:00.670
 that is another to see practice it 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.880
 to see how it is to see you can 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:06.930
 do let's see very well well let's go 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:09.240
 to the cut and we come back here in gymnastics 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.960
 cerebral 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.960
 do not
