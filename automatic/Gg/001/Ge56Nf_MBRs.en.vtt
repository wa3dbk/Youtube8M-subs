now<00:00:28.980> most<00:00:29.279> butcher<00:00:29.699> block<00:00:29.880> tops<00:00:30.269> are<00:00:30.570> made<00:00:30.810> out

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
now most butcher block tops are made out

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.260 
now most butcher block tops are made out
of<00:00:30.990> strips<00:00:31.380> of<00:00:31.560> hard<00:00:31.769> maple<00:00:32.040> such<00:00:32.669> as<00:00:32.850> this<00:00:33.030> one

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
of strips of hard maple such as this one

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.720 
of strips of hard maple such as this one
these<00:00:34.110> strips<00:00:34.500> are<00:00:34.649> cut<00:00:34.710> from<00:00:35.040> thick<00:00:35.430> stock

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
these strips are cut from thick stock

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.000 
these strips are cut from thick stock
and<00:00:36.120> then<00:00:36.719> turn<00:00:37.020> down<00:00:37.140> their<00:00:37.350> edges<00:00:37.739> so<00:00:37.980> that

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
and then turn down their edges so that

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.209 
and then turn down their edges so that
the<00:00:38.250> edge<00:00:38.399> grain<00:00:38.820> is<00:00:39.059> up<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:40.350> combination<00:00:40.770> of

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
the edge grain is up the combination of

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.670 
the edge grain is up the combination of
hard<00:00:41.489> maple<00:00:41.790> and<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.180> edge<00:00:42.600> Greene<00:00:42.960> creates<00:00:43.559> a

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
hard maple and the edge Greene creates a

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.029 
hard maple and the edge Greene creates a
very<00:00:44.010> durable<00:00:44.309> surface<00:00:44.940> however<00:00:45.920> gluing<00:00:46.920> and

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
very durable surface however gluing and

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.979 
very durable surface however gluing and
clamping<00:00:47.579> all<00:00:47.730> these<00:00:47.910> pieces<00:00:48.210> together<00:00:48.570> so

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
clamping all these pieces together so

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.770 
clamping all these pieces together so
that<00:00:49.260> you<00:00:49.410> end<00:00:49.559> up<00:00:49.800> with<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.129> flat<00:00:50.550> top<00:00:50.879> can<00:00:51.750> be

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
that you end up with a flat top can be

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.630 
that you end up with a flat top can be
challenging<00:00:52.469> but<00:00:52.980> there<00:00:53.129> are<00:00:53.250> a<00:00:53.280> couple<00:00:53.489> of

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
challenging but there are a couple of

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.430 
challenging but there are a couple of
ways<00:00:53.789> to<00:00:54.180> improve<00:00:54.420> your<00:00:54.480> chances<00:00:55.170> for

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
ways to improve your chances for

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.400 
ways to improve your chances for
achieving<00:00:55.739> a<00:00:55.980> flat<00:00:56.460> top<00:00:56.760> I<00:00:57.090> have<00:00:57.750> another<00:00:58.140> top

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
achieving a flat top I have another top

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.090 
achieving a flat top I have another top
underway<00:00:58.829> let<00:00:59.520> me<00:00:59.579> show<00:00:59.789> you<00:01:00.680> the<00:01:01.680> first<00:01:01.920> thing

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
underway let me show you the first thing

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.799 
underway let me show you the first thing
I<00:01:02.190> do<00:01:02.250> after<00:01:02.609> I<00:01:02.820> have<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.000> strip's<00:01:03.270> cut<00:01:03.480> out<00:01:03.629> is

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
I do after I have the strip's cut out is

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.469 
I do after I have the strip's cut out is
glue<00:01:04.320> them<00:01:04.470> up<00:01:04.619> in<00:01:04.769> sections<00:01:05.040> for<00:01:06.030> this<00:01:06.150> top

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
glue them up in sections for this top

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.590 
glue them up in sections for this top
each<00:01:06.990> section<00:01:07.560> contains<00:01:08.010> four<00:01:08.850> strips<00:01:09.270> after

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
each section contains four strips after

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.980 
each section contains four strips after
the<00:01:10.530> glue<00:01:10.710> is<00:01:10.860> dried<00:01:11.159> I<00:01:11.430> join<00:01:11.970> one<00:01:12.270> face<00:01:12.659> and

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
the glue is dried I join one face and

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.899 
the glue is dried I join one face and
then<00:01:13.470> send<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.860> section<00:01:14.250> through<00:01:14.460> my<00:01:14.580> planer

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
then send the section through my planer

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.840 
then send the section through my planer
to<00:01:15.180> flatten<00:01:15.869> out<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.170> other<00:01:16.320> face<00:01:16.650> I<00:01:16.920> also

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
to flatten out the other face I also

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.050 
to flatten out the other face I also
join<00:01:18.150> both<00:01:18.450> edges<00:01:19.580> making<00:01:20.580> sure<00:01:20.759> that<00:01:20.909> the

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
join both edges making sure that the

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.330 
join both edges making sure that the
section<00:01:21.479> is<00:01:21.600> perfectly<00:01:22.049> flat<00:01:22.409> n<00:01:22.680> square<00:01:23.130> is

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
section is perfectly flat n square is

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.670 
section is perfectly flat n square is
the<00:01:23.850> second<00:01:24.270> thing<00:01:24.420> I<00:01:24.540> do<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:25.229> guarantee<00:01:25.439> a

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
the second thing I do to guarantee a

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.270 
the second thing I do to guarantee a
level<00:01:26.310> flat<00:01:26.580> top<00:01:26.880> when<00:01:27.180> it's<00:01:27.330> done<00:01:28.070> also<00:01:29.070> when

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
level flat top when it's done also when

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.550 
level flat top when it's done also when
the<00:01:29.400> top<00:01:29.610> is<00:01:29.790> all<00:01:29.939> glued<00:01:30.270> up<00:01:30.479> I<00:01:30.720> only<00:01:31.229> have

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
the top is all glued up I only have

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.350 
the top is all glued up I only have
three<00:01:31.979> joints<00:01:32.430> that<00:01:32.610> I<00:01:32.640> have<00:01:32.909> to<00:01:33.060> clean<00:01:33.329> up

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
three joints that I have to clean up

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.530 
three joints that I have to clean up
with<00:01:33.810> my<00:01:33.960> sander<00:01:34.439> or<00:01:34.470> scraper<00:01:35.030> now<00:01:36.030> building<00:01:36.479> a

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
with my sander or scraper now building a

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.420 
with my sander or scraper now building a
butcher<00:01:36.840> block<00:01:36.960> top<00:01:37.350> involves<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.130> lot<00:01:38.400> of

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430

clamps<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.180> glue<00:01:39.570> so<00:01:40.200> it<00:01:40.229> pays<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:40.619> get

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
clamps and glue so it pays to get

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.130 
clamps and glue so it pays to get
organized<00:01:41.400> before<00:01:41.640> you<00:01:41.909> start<00:01:42.240> here's<00:01:43.079> a

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
organized before you start here's a
