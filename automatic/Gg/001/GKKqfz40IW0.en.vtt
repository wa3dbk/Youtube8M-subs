00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:17.490
 we are all boys and welcome back again 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.560
 video how to start this video if not 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.859
 sleeping and in collaboration with others 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.590
 six beautiful girls and capitone comets 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.090
 soft routing so I don't like it 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.980
 this word because it means that 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.990
 you need to wake up early 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.590
 I am a lazy one absurd and I put 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.870
 1000 1000 1000 alarm clocks here first 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.079
 repeat the cuts again 5 minutes more 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.040
 5 minutes still 5 minutes and I turn around in 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.950
 bed 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.920
 and in short I must say that it is really beautiful 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.989
 trauma and barely even hears the alarm 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.629
 she started waking up wants to go 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.559
 outside even if it often appears 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.870
 close to me 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.539
 and it is even more traumatic to wake up 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.760
 because you have this whole furry plume 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.129
 and soft next to you you would like only 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.870
 continue to hug her and sell 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.439
 make it clear while they are necchi 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:10.380
 quietly not really and plastic and 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.479
 terrible at the same time being one 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.909
 patina I have to turn around to get the 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.159
 glasses I have on the bedside table and also 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.500
 this is not a good thing because they are 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.930
 more than half czech 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.090
 as soon as I wake up, I immediately take them 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.080
 resigned and wrapped in cardboard 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:29.460
 go back to sleep with them 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.040
 after that like normal people 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.229
 I head to the bathroom to do the 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.350
 let's call them the usual hygiene questions 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.350
 so 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.040
 after which I take toothpaste 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.450
 toothbrush and started brushing my teeth 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.910
 here seen from the video it seems everything 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.840
 simple when actually at 7am 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.690
 morning 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.540
 nothing is simple and even just one 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:02.590
 little action like brushing your teeth can 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:05.550
 being complicated is really there 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.550
 I would lose hours 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.349
 then with a bertino brush i 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:23.590
 my soft smooth flowing hair 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:27.340
 shiny silky with so much mastery 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:29.290
 ease that no one can imagine e 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.659
 but no, but I'm not in there 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.540
 half an hour with the brush I take off 

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:36.549
 away every hair on my head that i have 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.430
 knots that can not even be dreamed of 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:41.859
 but now you hate going around with him 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.109
 glasses therefore I always wear every day 

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:46.450
 daily, yes, the lenses a 

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:49.209
 contact I love non contact lenses 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.450
 I know that life would be without lenses a 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:51.450
 contact 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:56.019
 then I put myself in front of the window 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.299
 to look a little out you don't know why 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:00.069
 and I realize that my face is not 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:02.650
 of the best, indeed, one would want 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:04.420
 nice retouching then started a 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.329
 I usually wear makeup in the morning 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.129
 like to do tricks on brownish 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:12.849
 I must say that I really like to touch myself there 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:16.480
 morning even if they are half as saying 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:19.780
 delayed, however, I really like the morning 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.340
 definitely make up eye shadows 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.480
 I can do even if I am from 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:28.120
 hurry but one thing is essential 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:30.069
 eyeliner and also mascara 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.560
 I really like to apply also or 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:35.579
 Cocoa butter maybe in the periods where between 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.579
 a little colder 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:44.490
 obviously there is a dilemma how to dress 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.380
 well obviously super easy because that's enough 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:49.440
 enter the closet shake a 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:52.140
 yes, nothing special, yes 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:56.700
 will come out ready and snappy to go 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:59.070
 at school if maybe I open instead 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.740
 the wardrobe with all calm that you are of 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:04.710
 hurry I'm there half an hour to choose what 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:07.110
 I put this no this ugly too 

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:10.800
 too colorful too little color 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:12.900
 too much it is really I would spend hours hours e 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:16.860
 for how many clothes I can have 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:19.400
 I will always and perpetually be with nothing to 

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:19.400
 put me 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:36.050
 I love the accessories and I think that 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:38.660
 really complete a look 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:40.040
 but in the morning I try to put type 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.990
 of simple earrings that go up 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.430
 I don't have to think too much too 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.520
 because there is to find the hole for 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:49.130
 earrings and complicated then passed to impro 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.080
 smoke me with bio gilding and fine perfume 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:52.970
 to poison me yes you got it right 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:57.139
 up to squat carmi because every morning 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:59.450
 then it's not nice to cough and sneeze beautiful 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:01.610
 obviously the school bag is there 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:03.020
 I always do in the morning as not 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.640

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.520

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:09.710

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:16.940

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:20.090
 larger not yet consisting of one 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:21.919
 bag rather a suitcase much more 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:24.590
