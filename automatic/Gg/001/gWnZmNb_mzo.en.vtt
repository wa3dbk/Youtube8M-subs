puncher<00:01:13.470> but<00:01:14.810> we'll<00:01:15.810> see<00:01:15.990> you<00:01:16.170> know<00:01:16.290> it's<00:01:16.439> one

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
puncher but we'll see you know it's one

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.140 
puncher but we'll see you know it's one
of<00:01:16.619> them<00:01:16.799> things<00:01:17.040> had<00:01:17.430> all<00:01:17.580> I<00:01:17.700> don't<00:01:17.759> think

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
of them things had all I don't think

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.310 
of them things had all I don't think
he's<00:01:18.299> going<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.540> run<00:01:18.630> around<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.990> ring<00:01:19.110> like

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
he's going to run around the ring like

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.570 
he's going to run around the ring like
he<00:01:19.409> did<00:01:19.530> against<00:01:19.799> Klitschko<00:01:20.159> I<00:01:20.189> think<00:01:20.460> he's

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
he did against Klitschko I think he's

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.800 
he did against Klitschko I think he's
going<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:20.850> actually<00:01:20.970> bring<00:01:21.360> it<00:01:21.450> this<00:01:21.540> time

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
going to actually bring it this time

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.770 
going to actually bring it this time
because<00:01:22.020> it's<00:01:22.560> his<00:01:22.740> last<00:01:22.920> chance<00:01:23.159> Rowley<00:01:23.780> to

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
because it's his last chance Rowley to

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.530 
because it's his last chance Rowley to
prove<00:01:25.020> that<00:01:25.200> he<00:01:25.380> still<00:01:26.070> got<00:01:26.159> something<00:01:26.340> left

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
prove that he still got something left

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.090 
prove that he still got something left
so<00:01:27.540> I<00:01:27.570> hope<00:01:28.110> he<00:01:28.229> comes<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:28.619> he<00:01:28.710> puts<00:01:28.920> on<00:01:29.040> a

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
so I hope he comes and he puts on a

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.740 
so I hope he comes and he puts on a
great<00:01:29.490> display<00:01:29.939> because<00:01:30.329> it's<00:01:30.479> going<00:01:30.600> to<00:01:30.659> be

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
great display because it's going to be

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.660 
great display because it's going to be
his<00:01:30.840> last<00:01:30.960> one<00:01:31.110> you<00:01:31.380> know<00:01:31.409> whatever<00:01:32.159> David<00:01:32.520> a

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
his last one you know whatever David a

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.960 
his last one you know whatever David a
brings<00:01:32.939> to<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.240> table<00:01:33.420> I<00:01:33.780> can<00:01:34.290> overcome<00:01:34.970> just

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
brings to the table I can overcome just

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.850 
brings to the table I can overcome just
because<00:01:36.299> I'm<00:01:36.420> younger<00:01:36.659> fitter<00:01:37.110> stronger<00:01:37.650> and

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
because I'm younger fitter stronger and

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.390 
because I'm younger fitter stronger and
bigger<00:01:38.420> so<00:01:39.740> that's<00:01:40.740> about<00:01:40.860> it<00:01:41.130> really

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
bigger so that's about it really

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.889 
bigger so that's about it really
I<00:01:41.549> believe<00:01:42.090> I'm<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.240> best<00:01:42.540> have<00:01:42.689> you<00:01:42.780> written
