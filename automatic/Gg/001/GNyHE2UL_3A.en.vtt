the<00:00:52.440> collectors<00:00:55.250> the<00:00:56.250> collectors<00:00:56.730> are<00:00:57.030> able

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
the collectors the collectors are able

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.369 
the collectors the collectors are able
to<00:00:57.540> arrive<00:00:58.170> with<00:00:59.129> this<00:00:59.720> enormous<00:01:00.720> ship<00:01:00.989> very

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
to arrive with this enormous ship very

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.520 
to arrive with this enormous ship very
quickly<00:01:01.790> swarms<00:01:02.790> of<00:01:03.000> little<00:01:03.420> bugs<00:01:03.629> sweep<00:01:04.320> out

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
quickly swarms of little bugs sweep out

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.490 
quickly swarms of little bugs sweep out
and<00:01:04.799> they<00:01:05.460> paralyze<00:01:05.970> all<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.540> people<00:01:07.320> in<00:01:07.409> the

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
and they paralyze all the people in the

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.340 
and they paralyze all the people in the
colony<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:08.130> then<00:01:08.880> at<00:01:09.150> that<00:01:09.390> point<00:01:09.450> it's<00:01:09.990> very

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
colony and then at that point it's very

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.710 
colony and then at that point it's very
easy<00:01:10.590> for<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.979> collectors<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:12.119> gather<00:01:12.360> up<00:01:12.630> the

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
easy for the collectors to gather up the

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.140 
easy for the collectors to gather up the
people<00:01:12.960> put<00:01:13.799> them<00:01:13.950> into<00:01:14.100> pods<00:01:14.520> that<00:01:14.790> keep<00:01:14.970> them

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
people put them into pods that keep them

people put them into pods that keep them
in<00:01:15.240> stasis<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:15.900> they're<00:01:16.380> gone

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:23.979 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:26.050 

well<00:01:24.979> the<00:01:25.070> collectors<00:01:25.430> are<00:01:25.640> a<00:01:25.670> very

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
well the collectors are a very

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.960 
well the collectors are a very
insect-like<00:01:26.990> kind<00:01:27.590> of<00:01:27.680> species<00:01:27.979> they<00:01:28.579> can<00:01:28.729> fly

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
insect-like kind of species they can fly

insect-like kind of species they can fly
in<00:01:29.180> from<00:01:29.810> anywhere<00:01:30.200> they're<00:01:30.560> armed<00:01:30.860> with<00:01:30.890> like

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
in from anywhere they're armed with like

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.039 
in from anywhere they're armed with like
Vance<00:01:31.310> technology<00:01:31.820> like<00:01:32.000> like<00:01:32.479> beam<00:01:32.689> weapons

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.049 
Vance technology like like beam weapons

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:35.469 
Vance technology like like beam weapons
they're<00:01:33.320> controlled<00:01:33.799> by<00:01:34.399> a<00:01:34.820> single<00:01:35.090> leader

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
they're controlled by a single leader

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:37.719 
they're controlled by a single leader
that<00:01:36.140> it<00:01:36.350> has<00:01:36.530> the<00:01:36.679> ability<00:01:37.039> to<00:01:37.070> possess<00:01:37.340> them

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
that it has the ability to possess them

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:39.520 
that it has the ability to possess them
at<00:01:37.909> any<00:01:38.149> time<00:01:38.420> you<00:01:38.659> can<00:01:38.689> turn<00:01:38.899> like<00:01:39.080> a<00:01:39.110> normal

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
at any time you can turn like a normal

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.319 
at any time you can turn like a normal
guy<00:01:39.679> who<00:01:40.009> sort<00:01:40.250> of<00:01:40.310> not<00:01:40.549> really<00:01:40.580> you<00:01:41.119> know<00:01:41.210> all

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:41.329 
guy who sort of not really you know all

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:42.880 
guy who sort of not really you know all
that<00:01:41.360> dangerous<00:01:41.720> and<00:01:42.200> then<00:01:42.350> suddenly<00:01:42.619> he's

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
that dangerous and then suddenly he's

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.289 
that dangerous and then suddenly he's
like<00:01:43.130> the<00:01:43.340> most<00:01:43.490> dangerous<00:01:43.909> guy<00:01:44.060> on<00:01:44.210> the

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:44.299 
like the most dangerous guy on the

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:47.690 
like the most dangerous guy on the
battlefield

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.279 

one<00:01:48.700> reason<00:01:48.909> to<00:01:49.329> believe<00:01:49.509> that<00:01:49.689> the<00:01:49.869> Reapers

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:50.289 
one reason to believe that the Reapers

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:52.289 
one reason to believe that the Reapers
are<00:01:50.380> somehow<00:01:50.619> involved<00:01:51.280> in<00:01:51.399> all<00:01:51.820> these<00:01:51.939> human

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:52.299 
are somehow involved in all these human

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:53.969 
are somehow involved in all these human
disappearances<00:01:52.930> is<00:01:53.170> the<00:01:53.409> enemies<00:01:53.770> that

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
disappearances is the enemies that

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:55.800 
disappearances is the enemies that
you'll<00:01:54.100> see<00:01:54.340> in<00:01:54.549> mass<00:01:54.969> effect<00:01:55.270> 2<00:01:55.450> the

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
you'll see in mass effect 2 the

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.840 
you'll see in mass effect 2 the
collectors<00:01:56.140> have<00:01:56.289> for<00:01:56.890> some<00:01:57.070> reason<00:01:57.430> this

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
collectors have for some reason this

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.760 
collectors have for some reason this
advanced<00:01:58.659> technology<00:01:59.110> that<00:01:59.259> nobody<00:01:59.289> else<00:01:59.649> in

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
advanced technology that nobody else in

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.679 
advanced technology that nobody else in
the<00:01:59.829> galaxy<00:01:59.979> has<00:02:00.369> and<00:02:00.670> the<00:02:01.149> question<00:02:01.479> arises

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:01.689 
the galaxy has and the question arises

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:03.840 
the galaxy has and the question arises
where<00:02:02.439> are<00:02:02.590> they<00:02:02.710> getting<00:02:02.799> that<00:02:03.039> from<00:02:03.219> and<00:02:03.490> the

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
where are they getting that from and the

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.190 
where are they getting that from and the
only<00:02:04.030> logical<00:02:04.179> answer<00:02:04.450> seems<00:02:04.869> to<00:02:04.990> be<00:02:05.079> the

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
only logical answer seems to be the

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.779 
only logical answer seems to be the
Reavers<00:02:05.470> the<00:02:06.130> Reapers<00:02:06.429> are<00:02:06.520> somehow

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:06.789 
Reavers the Reapers are somehow

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:09.210 
Reavers the Reapers are somehow
experimenting<00:02:07.780> with<00:02:07.810> assembling<00:02:08.470> human

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220
