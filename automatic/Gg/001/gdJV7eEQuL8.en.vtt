let's check out ninja gaiden one first a
little<00:01:14.159> interesting<00:01:14.640> fact<00:01:15.920> Japan<00:01:16.920> this<00:01:17.310> is

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
little interesting fact Japan this is

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.649 
little interesting fact Japan this is
called<00:01:17.759> ninja<00:01:18.090> Ryu<00:01:18.840> Ken<00:01:18.869> den<00:01:19.610> which<00:01:20.659> literally

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
called ninja Ryu Ken den which literally

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.190 
called ninja Ryu Ken den which literally
translates<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:23.150> legend<00:01:24.150> of<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.450> ninja<00:01:24.780> dragon

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
translates to legend of the ninja dragon

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.800 
translates to legend of the ninja dragon
sword<00:01:25.580> so<00:01:26.580> it's<00:01:26.700> probably<00:01:26.970> good<00:01:27.270> they<00:01:27.479> chose<00:01:27.780> a

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
sword so it's probably good they chose a

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.690 
sword so it's probably good they chose a
different<00:01:28.020> title<00:01:28.439> for<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.009> states<00:01:29.340> those<00:01:29.670> a

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
different title for the states those a

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.179 
different title for the states those a
little<00:01:30.000> long<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:30.680> if<00:01:31.680> you're<00:01:31.829> a<00:01:31.860> curious

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
little long and if you're a curious

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.960 
little long and if you're a curious
about<00:01:32.939> what<00:01:33.060> guide<00:01:33.299> n<00:01:33.479> means<00:01:34.369> it<00:01:35.369> means<00:01:35.610> side

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
about what guide n means it means side

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.060 
about what guide n means it means side
story<00:01:36.390> which<00:01:37.229> is<00:01:37.259> a<00:01:37.409> little<00:01:37.710> bit<00:01:37.860> weird

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
story which is a little bit weird

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.899 
story which is a little bit weird
because<00:01:38.630> you<00:01:39.630> know<00:01:39.720> this<00:01:39.869> isn't<00:01:40.200> really<00:01:40.380> a

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 
because you know this isn't really a

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:43.639 
because you know this isn't really a
spin-off<00:01:41.909> or<00:01:42.329> a<00:01:42.360> side<00:01:42.659> story<00:01:42.990> of<00:01:43.259> any<00:01:43.439> other

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
spin-off or a side story of any other

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.639 
spin-off or a side story of any other
game<00:01:44.009> but<00:01:44.939> yeah<00:01:45.600> I<00:01:45.840> guess<00:01:46.079> it's<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.350> side

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
game but yeah I guess it's the side

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.330 
game but yeah I guess it's the side
story<00:01:47.070> of<00:01:47.220> Ryu<00:01:47.610> Hayabusa<00:01:48.210> as<00:01:49.220> he
