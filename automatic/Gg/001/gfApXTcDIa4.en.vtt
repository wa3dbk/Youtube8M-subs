00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:12.019
 it continues with the LG Optimus zc 550 and the 3 Mega Pixel Camara 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:16.009
 When I'm concerned, frankly rather that the result is not so intoxicating 

00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:20.249
 Being a mega pixel just is not much and if simple 

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:23.980
 not even somehow only tar or autofocus is in it 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:25.830
 but good 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.100
 I want to see so I have him on the new screenshots the camera 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.680
 placed 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.680
 and you see that's the view 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.700
 Percent over the old problem 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.350
 m the taz in there is just pretty small and 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.489
 because he sees that frightening simply thinks the image section already enormously 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:50.890
 and if I can just have these four points here JAL yourself 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.120
 almost nothing 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.010
 so the four corners she awakens 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.960
 still very interesting here you can just go in there 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.980
 here could just search purely 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.580
 if the smartphone is an honorary citizen 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.910
 so here you can now 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:12.920
 and get out 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.500
 herewith 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.660
 more could just adjust the brightness 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:22.290
 underneath, these effects can apply like black and white negative sepia 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.850
 or so 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.490
 and then below it again 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.619
 Meier, you find the general attitude because he is concerned with the 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:29.800
 image size 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.670
 So Zenta once overathes could also be in the self-timer 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.240
 choose 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.940
 I can look for one here on the right side again 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:41.180
 Reform 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:47.030
 Photo mode in video mode Switching with this you can trigger one 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.950
 otherwise, I have already said that there are no direct ones 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.520
 Proceeds button but that any and everything around and under it 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:56.490
 Quantities on it 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.760
 clicks you can percent of your already recorded 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.840
 Watch photos 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.840
 so i am doing here now 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.200
 our advice February 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.830
 Test photo at one year and you see everything here 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.930
 to make you madder darker over here in the room Achern 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:20.049
 In addition to daylight, I have even more lamps on them 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:23.249
 out as if it was somehow already dusk 

00:02:23.249 --> 00:02:26.689
 the painting photo a 

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:29.730
 yes, so the more mau triggering time is good, of course 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:34.929
 FN me too good that I trigger so perplex railway noise 

00:02:34.929 --> 00:02:38.749
 you have already been able to use it to send or send here 

00:02:38.749 --> 00:02:39.869
 rename 

00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:42.999
 or delete it now 

00:02:42.999 --> 00:02:46.559
 or percent we take a new picture 

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:48.849
 Ladies 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:52.140
 We'll just take a look at what I've just recorded 

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:56.859
 more accurate or so is that 

00:02:56.859 --> 00:03:00.489
 but I do not know when we last seen the video so well 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:05.800
 yes, first of all it is a sheep, as I suspect it is 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.480
 this is just not learning at fixed physical button to trigger there 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.700
 but one really we will be here with the thumb he must trigger what I have 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.759
 put me very impractical turn 

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:20.009
 the contrast is just too dark 

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:23.009
 So there is no one saying that the 

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:25.929
 Camera around 

00:03:25.929 --> 00:03:29.709
 not very good is the but can still paint short 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:30.759
 in the video 

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:31.759
 do 

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:34.219
 but he also sees swinging there 

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:38.799
 In any case, the probable probability of becoming dark will come too 

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:56.769
 Approach Â«If not really good that is a Manson Prokofiev's Peter Mouse 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:00.309
 solve that gives me some security and we'll take a look 

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:03.309
 fear 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:13.539
 yes and so it's like these are said for snapshots or something 

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:14.459
 around 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:16.459
 or if he is the 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.389
 conversely, now all portals want to play 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:20.259
 around 

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:24.379
 then you can certainly use the l, but really somehow 

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:27.550
 nice m shots or something 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.990
 In any case, learning to do it is not possible 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.979
 so in the end there is more of a bit of music from percentages 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:38.730
 music player is at 11 17 sec / a submenu 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.139
 gib customers are music the war i am 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:46.849
 Bayern is just the view that surrounds them representing a filtering Cummins 

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:51.229
 Altena title or you can of course playlists 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:54.229
 compile 

00:04:56.039 --> 00:04:59.110
 I just play games now 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:00.660
 what's up and we hear 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.660
 how is that 

00:05:08.339 --> 00:05:11.339
 he 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.650
 8th 

00:05:21.809 --> 00:05:24.879
 she 

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:27.639
 the 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:32.060
 um so that the planner for me is definitely possible and really good 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:32.730
 Nadal 

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:36.520
 but and here year I saw it's just this typical view here 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:41.380
 Of course you can also a4 yourself and rewind it 

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:44.569
 there are still different ones 

00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:45.740
 around 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:48.960
 Views and clicks with which he just with everything 

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:53.629
 Random play or so they can go around all titles 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.200
 repeated 

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:56.969
 he also looks around here 

00:05:56.969 --> 00:06:00.199
 you can of course take the music player on the homescreen 

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:04.269
 and you can see to me that I'm every what I'm playing right now 

00:06:04.269 --> 00:06:06.840
 I have just displayed all 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:10.460
 around the year altogether and one can say now that the EM 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:15.889
 multimedia tourist Selg percent Optimus Shetty of 4 55 

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:20.439
 thanks to solid can be more with 3 megapixels or 3 megapixels 

00:06:20.439 --> 00:06:23.419
 you do not expect much that has indeed seen 

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:25.740
 the music player is really good for that
