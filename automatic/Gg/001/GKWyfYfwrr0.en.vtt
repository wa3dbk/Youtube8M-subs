00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:04.320
 There is something hidden 

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.670
 inside my head. 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:09.799
 What is; 

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:13.109
 - It's a memory. - A memory? 

00:00:13.109 --> 00:00:19.669
 A memory of what you did. 

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:24.300
 - Everyone can steal a table. - Let's start with 5 million pounds. 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:31.300
 - All you need is little power. - Say down. Below. 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:33.810
 But no artwork 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.680
 it does not deserve a human life. 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:42.680
 Stop where you are. A MOVIE OF DANI BOIL 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.880

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:53.880
 it does not deserve a human life. Translation www.pestograpta.gr 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:03.430
 - Where is; - I can not remember. I hit the head. 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.600
 Do you remember that? 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.220
 Have you ever done hypnosis? 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:15.830
 - Whatever is in his head, she can find it. - I want you to relax Simon. - Stop it. 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:21.890
 - What can you do to him? - Anything. 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:23.180
 Was he part of the plan? 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.990
 - Have you both designed it together? - She made that thought. It's not true. - He wants the table for himself. 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.210
 - I do not believe that. - Where is; 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.480
 Why did you lie to me? 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.040
 A memory is locked in the cage. 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.440
 And with enough strength ... 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:49.440
 ... the lock can break. - Elizabeth, I have something to tell you. 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:01.170
 I remember.
