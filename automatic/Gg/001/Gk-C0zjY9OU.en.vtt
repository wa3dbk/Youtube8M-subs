00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:15.010
 hello everyone how are you I'm bea ' font and 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:17.410
 today as many do not put the 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:20.140
 comments I bring you the solution to 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.990
 problem of pp 25 of which I speak to you 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.700
 closes the applications and the truth that 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.980
 it is very easy to solve this problem what 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.750
 only they have to do and as well as 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.970
 I'm saying it because if they do not 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.770
 Well, it's not going to work 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.770
 next the first thing they have to 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:39.850
 to do is go to this tab 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:42.730
 or sub section of this little house are going to go 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:45.640
 and your device has to be 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:48.310
 connected obviously then it's going to 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:51.360
 appear here a blue button I'm going to 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:51.360
 connect to see 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:58.120
 ok there is the iphone 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:02.260
 will show us so they can see it there 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:04.780
 iphone then I go back to the tab and I do not 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.759
 the blue button appears they have to have 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.399
 your device blocked at that time 

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:11.619
 then right now he blocked it once 

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:14.409
 I blocked it, I'm going to press this 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:16.350
 blue button in this section to forces yes 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:19.000
 they do not do it there it will not work 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.850
 then once I have done this it goes 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.820
 to appear here this 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.640
 one is that they appear ready they are going to 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.470
 operate any applications that 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.310
 they have been locked up for some reason 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.409
 do not open them and well the problem is that 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.869
 they will have to do it every time 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.540
 take them and it's a bit tedious but 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.549
 because we do not have another is the only 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.399
 application to download without jailbreak 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.680
 and we have to wait for another 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.200
 for the jailbreak to come out so that 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.820
 we can all update then these 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.310
 peoples have served if it served him 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.590

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.960
