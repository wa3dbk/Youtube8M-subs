00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:13.230
 hello today we're going to make a 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:16.170
 worry with the accessory as mussig and 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:19.560
 this one we'll make a smoothie with 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:22.500
 banana mango a little bit of 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.039
 hazelnut and then also milk 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.099
 almond 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.980
 so I quickly show you how 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.080
 place the accessory in question 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.329
 smoothie filter so you open 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.710
 the device you had originally the 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:41.910
 juice filter that is orange 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:44.460
 you will simply replace it yourself 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.280
 take the filter at his site you 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:53.420
 slide inside and you place them 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.420
 and that's it 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:04.989
 like these we will start with the 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:07.299
 frozen mango already peeled so you take 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:10.000
 a nice mango of course preferably 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:12.070
 we're going to say we're going to say pretty much the 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.700
 half of the mango a fire the cut 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:17.320
 as these are crudely made 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:25.140
 slices anyway she is very 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:29.110
 ripe soft wanted to be cut 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:32.429
 we operate the device and go 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.429
 for the smoothie 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:40.300
 so the smoothie is a juice too 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:43.450
 but this one contains fiber 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:46.630
 the inverse of the classic juices so that 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:49.300
 it will contain some of the fibers it's 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.250
 usually greedy than a juice 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:54.390
 classic although it's also a 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.390
 a matter of taste 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.720
 the presence of fibers actually 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:03.930
 does that simulation in terms of 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:06.810
 nutrients will be less effective than on 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:10.200
 one day but it remains extremely 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.180
 mourn the banana so I put for 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.390
 the moment about half a 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.540
 mango a little ripe banana I 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.590
 so go put my hazel 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.420
 you can put them directly into 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.800
 the device 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.260
 we'll see in a next video 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:28.230
 how do the ladies angles and 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.360
 soy milk plants so you 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:36.650
 introduce like this site and we will 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:40.310
 end with my almond milk 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.310
 approximately 200 milliliters 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.819
 so compared to achieving a 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.450
 classic game 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:51.540
 here we just have to wait for 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.280
 little that the machine does its job 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.099
 you simply let it run 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.909
 you will see the level going up 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:58.980
 gradually 

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:01.049
 so it takes a little bit more 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.379
 time that making a juice 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:07.290
 classic so here we realized a 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:10.140
 smoothie that is going to be absolutely divine 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.390
 with a mango half a banana 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.379
 all that ripe and a little bit of 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.500
 hazelnut 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:18.750
 see we have 400 milliliters so of 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.659
 so worry with the little worry 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:25.790
 precision you have no output from 

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:28.590
 fiber the fiber stays at the juice level 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.209
 so the smoothie here the interest also 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.709
 knows he will have kept all his 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:34.170
 nutritional properties 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:37.470
 we are still this a rotation 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:41.220
 sweet to cold that allows us this 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:45.359
 quality at the game level we close the 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:48.180
 cap to prevent it from sinking and 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:51.359
 we will be able to taste it is excellent 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.970
 smoothie a wonderful mango smoothie 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:55.919
 hazelnut banana and almond milk view 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:59.579
 it is much thicker more greedy 

00:03:55.919 --> 00:04:02.449
 to your health and very quickly with the 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:02.449
