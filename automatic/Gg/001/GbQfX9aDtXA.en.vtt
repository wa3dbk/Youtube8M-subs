00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
stronger team yeah well we thought the

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.790

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
same so we made a mistake it was like

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.640 
same so we made a mistake it was like
our<00:00:29.070> first<00:00:29.160> loss<00:00:29.720> he<00:00:30.720> was<00:00:30.869> our<00:00:31.019> second<00:00:31.529> game

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
our first loss he was our second game

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.010 
our first loss he was our second game
for<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:31.920> day<00:00:32.189> we<00:00:32.730> had<00:00:32.910> a<00:00:32.940> chance<00:00:33.239> to<00:00:33.540> wait<00:00:33.719> them

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
for the day we had a chance to wait them

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.780

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
to play versus the Corinthians first but

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.760 
to play versus the Corinthians first but

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
each loss without thinking that our

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.400 
each loss without thinking that our
priest<00:00:50.460> can<00:00:50.640> respect<00:00:51.090> that<00:00:51.360> what<00:00:51.899> we<00:00:52.050> can<00:00:52.260> do
