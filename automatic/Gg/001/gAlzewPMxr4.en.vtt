here this is good enough then get this

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.990 
here this is good enough then get this
up<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:55.829> MIT<00:00:56.010> on<00:00:56.449> you<00:00:57.449> know<00:00:57.539> take<00:00:57.750> this<00:00:58.730> as<00:00:59.730> by

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
up and MIT on you know take this as by

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.070 
up and MIT on you know take this as by
the<00:01:00.059> edge<00:01:00.289> it's<00:01:01.289> dripping<00:01:02.539> boiling<00:01:03.539> water<00:01:03.840> all
