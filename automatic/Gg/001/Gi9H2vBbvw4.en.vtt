00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:51.970 
performance of the unit but as we're

trying to keep the costs down on these

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.620 
trying to keep the costs down on these
as<00:00:53.469> low<00:00:53.620> as<00:00:53.800> possible<00:00:53.860> for<00:00:54.460> you<00:00:54.640> they

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:55.630 
as low as possible for you they
