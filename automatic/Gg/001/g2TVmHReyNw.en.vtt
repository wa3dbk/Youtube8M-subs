00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
it's a gimmick that work because it's

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.060 
it's a gimmick that work because it's

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
not really so much a gimmick as just a

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.510 
not really so much a gimmick as just a
return<00:00:50.399> to<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.579> powerup<00:00:51.059> system<00:00:51.510> yeah<00:00:52.520> but<00:00:53.520> i

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 
return to the powerup system yeah but i

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.090 
return to the powerup system yeah but i
haven't<00:00:56.520> enough<00:00:57.030> of<00:00:57.180> it<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.600> rate<00:00:58.500> it<00:00:58.530> with<00:00:58.920> the

this be it's to me yeah to me I think
I'm<00:01:24.420> thinking<00:01:24.750> it's<00:01:24.900> going<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.170> be<00:01:25.350> better

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
I'm thinking it's going to be better

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.280 
I'm thinking it's going to be better
than<00:01:26.159> adventure<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:26.880> not<00:01:27.450> personally<00:01:27.990> I<00:01:28.049> like

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
than adventure to not personally I like

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.859 
than adventure to not personally I like
it<00:01:28.470> but<00:01:28.619> you're<00:01:28.770> one<00:01:28.920> more<00:01:29.070> than<00:01:29.280> two<00:01:29.400> and<00:01:29.869> in

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
it but you're one more than two and in

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.539 
it but you're one more than two and in
particular<00:01:31.350> because<00:01:31.470> of<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.710> sonic<00:01:31.890> status<00:01:32.369> I

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
particular because of the sonic status I

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.660 
particular because of the sonic status I
think<00:01:33.210> that<00:01:33.329> because<00:01:33.840> to<00:01:34.049> me<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:35.070> sonic<00:01:35.490> state

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
think that because to me the sonic state

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.310 
think that because to me the sonic state
is<00:01:35.790> an<00:01:35.880> adventure<00:01:36.060> one<00:01:36.420> is<00:01:36.630> how<00:01:36.900> you<00:01:36.960> really

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
is an adventure one is how you really

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.179 
is an adventure one is how you really
should<00:01:37.680> do<00:01:37.920> sonic<00:01:38.310> in<00:01:38.430> 3d<00:01:38.759> you<00:01:39.710> know<00:01:40.710> you<00:01:40.890> just

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
should do sonic in 3d you know you just

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.249 
should do sonic in 3d you know you just
got<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.369> fine-tune<00:01:41.850> it<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:42.000> little<00:01:42.150> more<00:01:42.390> but<00:01:43.229> uh

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
got to fine-tune it a little more but uh

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.740 
got to fine-tune it a little more but uh
like<00:01:44.250> I<00:01:44.280> do<00:01:44.460> like<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:44.970> only<00:01:45.240> style<00:01:46.189> but<00:01:47.750> this

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
like I do like the only style but this

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.670 
like I do like the only style but this
really<00:01:49.290> isn't<00:01:49.680> a<00:01:50.040> 3d<00:01:50.790> game<00:01:51.049> it's<00:01:52.049> ninety

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
really isn't a 3d game it's ninety

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.219 
really isn't a 3d game it's ninety
percent<00:01:53.009> it<00:01:53.579> is<00:01:53.700> ninety<00:01:54.149> percent<00:01:54.329> 2d<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:55.110> if

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
percent it is ninety percent 2d and if

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.020 
percent it is ninety percent 2d and if
there<00:01:55.380> is<00:01:55.500> a<00:01:55.530> 3d<00:01:55.950> section<00:01:56.369> usually<00:01:56.700> just

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
there is a 3d section usually just

anniversary title will have to I think

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:06.520 
anniversary title will have to I think
depending<00:06:05.450> on<00:06:05.570> what<00:06:05.690> the<00:06:05.720> game<00:06:05.930> next<00:06:06.200> here<00:06:06.410> is

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:06.530 
depending on what the game next here is

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:07.810 
depending on what the game next here is
we<00:06:06.620> really<00:06:06.740> determined<00:06:07.190> what<00:06:07.280> the<00:06:07.310> next<00:06:07.490> big

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:07.820 
we really determined what the next big

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:12.280 
we really determined what the next big
big<00:06:08.150> one<00:06:08.420> is<00:06:10.000> is<00:06:11.000> because<00:06:11.330> if<00:06:11.720> the<00:06:11.900> rumor<00:06:12.260> of

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:12.290 
big one is is because if the rumor of

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:15.670 
big one is is because if the rumor of
the<00:06:12.530> 20th<00:06:12.890> anniversary<00:06:12.920> game<00:06:13.640> is<00:06:13.820> true<00:06:14.590> then<00:06:15.590> I

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:15.680 
the 20th anniversary game is true then I

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.200 
the 20th anniversary game is true then I
really<00:06:15.980> suspect<00:06:16.370> that<00:06:16.490> the<00:06:16.610> next<00:06:16.820> big<00:06:17.030> one

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:17.210 
really suspect that the next big one

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:21.310 
really suspect that the next big one
will<00:06:17.420> be<00:06:17.600> Sonic<00:06:18.530> Colors<00:06:18.680> but<00:06:19.130> better<00:06:20.320> you

will be Sonic Colors but better you

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:22.570 
will be Sonic Colors but better you
probably<00:06:21.560> right<00:06:21.860> because<00:06:22.070> they're<00:06:22.220> actually

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:22.580 
probably right because they're actually
