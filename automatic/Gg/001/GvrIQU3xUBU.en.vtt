00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
the gallic there on the nexus 7 I got to

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:16.870 
the gallic there on the nexus 7 I got to
stop<00:02:11.420> calling<00:02:11.750> at<00:02:11.840> the<00:02:11.930> galaxy<00:02:12.380> here<00:02:15.880> both

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
stop calling at the galaxy here both

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.580 
stop calling at the galaxy here both
load<00:02:17.150> it<00:02:17.300> up<00:02:17.390> pretty<00:02:17.840> quickly<00:02:18.200> now<00:02:18.350> we're

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
load it up pretty quickly now we're

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.710 
load it up pretty quickly now we're
going<00:02:18.710> to<00:02:18.770> put<00:02:18.890> android<00:02:19.280> com<00:02:19.910> on<00:02:20.090> each<00:02:20.240> one<00:02:20.480> and

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
going to put android com on each one and

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.750 
going to put android com on each one and
they're<00:02:21.530> both<00:02:21.680> connected<00:02:21.890> to<00:02:22.220> the<00:02:22.310> same<00:02:22.490> Wi-Fi

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
they're both connected to the same Wi-Fi

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:32.970 
they're both connected to the same Wi-Fi
network<00:02:23.030> so<00:02:23.930> we're<00:02:24.560> going<00:02:24.650> to<00:02:24.740> go<00:02:24.770> truly

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.220 

this<00:02:33.580> isn't<00:02:33.940> just<00:02:34.300> I<00:02:34.510> guess<00:02:34.690> this<00:02:34.870> is<00:02:35.019> turning

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
this isn't just I guess this is turning

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.050 
this isn't just I guess this is turning
more<00:02:35.440> into<00:02:35.500> a<00:02:35.680> speed<00:02:36.129> comparison<00:02:36.879> that

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
more into a speed comparison that

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.320 
more into a speed comparison that
anything<00:02:37.480> but<00:02:38.370> smoothness<00:02:39.370> on<00:02:39.849> both<00:02:40.090> devices

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
anything but smoothness on both devices

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:47.430 
anything but smoothness on both devices
or<00:02:40.930> it's<00:02:41.110> a<00:02:41.260> ready<00:02:42.090> set<00:02:43.090> go<00:02:44.190> and<00:02:45.930> it<00:02:46.930> was<00:02:47.140> near

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
or it's a ready set go and it was near

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.479 
or it's a ready set go and it was near
instant<00:02:47.980> for<00:02:48.670> the<00:02:49.180> get<00:02:49.569> the<00:02:49.900> nexus<00:02:50.470> 7<00:02:50.830> I<00:02:50.980> really

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
instant for the get the nexus 7 I really

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:52.949 
instant for the get the nexus 7 I really
gotta<00:02:51.640> stop<00:02:51.910> calling<00:02:52.180> at<00:02:52.269> the<00:02:52.360> galaxy<00:02:52.629> here

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
gotta stop calling at the galaxy here

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.039 
gotta stop calling at the galaxy here
nexus<00:02:53.890> 7<00:02:54.160> just<00:02:54.340> loaded<00:02:54.760> up<00:02:54.819> instantly<00:02:55.450> well<00:02:55.870> it

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
nexus 7 just loaded up instantly well it

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:58.770 
nexus 7 just loaded up instantly well it
took<00:02:56.200> a<00:02:56.349> second<00:02:56.650> or<00:02:56.769> two<00:02:56.799> for<00:02:57.340> the<00:02:57.629> it<00:02:58.629> took

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
took a second or two for the it took

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.819 
took a second or two for the it took
actually<00:02:59.110> quite<00:02:59.349> a<00:02:59.379> bit<00:02:59.560> longer<00:02:59.769> for<00:02:59.980> the<00:03:01.829> s3

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:02.829 
actually quite a bit longer for the s3

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:07.110 
actually quite a bit longer for the s3
here<00:03:03.269> so<00:03:04.269> close<00:03:05.079> that<00:03:05.319> right<00:03:05.769> there<00:03:06.069> and<00:03:06.370> then

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
here so close that right there and then

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.220 
here so close that right there and then
we'll<00:03:07.299> do<00:03:07.390> a<00:03:07.420> little<00:03:07.510> bit<00:03:07.780> of<00:03:07.810> web<00:03:07.989> browsing

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
we'll do a little bit of web browsing

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.350 
we'll do a little bit of web browsing
here<00:03:08.620> chrome<00:03:08.950> and<00:03:09.280> that<00:03:09.430> is<00:03:09.579> the<00:03:09.940> default

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
here chrome and that is the default

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:16.589 
here chrome and that is the default
browser<00:03:10.660> on<00:03:11.079> s3<00:03:14.849> now<00:03:15.849> there's<00:03:16.209> a<00:03:16.269> little<00:03:16.480> bit

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:16.599 
browser on s3 now there's a little bit

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:19.520 
browser on s3 now there's a little bit
more<00:03:16.840> of<00:03:16.930> a<00:03:17.019> scroll<00:03:17.440> bounce<00:03:17.709> on<00:03:18.040> the<00:03:18.640> on<00:03:19.329> the

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
more of a scroll bounce on the on the

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.729 
more of a scroll bounce on the on the
galaxy<00:03:20.530> s3<00:03:21.010> here<00:03:21.519> and<00:03:21.760> that's<00:03:22.090> more<00:03:22.540> I<00:03:22.840> think

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
galaxy s3 here and that's more I think

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:25.170 
galaxy s3 here and that's more I think
that's<00:03:23.890> more<00:03:24.069> of<00:03:24.160> a<00:03:24.220> thing<00:03:24.400> that<00:03:24.579> Samsung

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
that's more of a thing that Samsung

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.640 
that's more of a thing that Samsung
threw<00:03:25.420> in<00:03:25.599> there<00:03:25.780> versus<00:03:26.200> you<00:03:26.319> got<00:03:26.440> to<00:03:26.530> do<00:03:26.620> a

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
threw in there versus you got to do a

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:27.869 
threw in there versus you got to do a
little<00:03:26.890> more<00:03:27.069> here<00:03:27.280> on<00:03:27.400> Chrome<00:03:27.640> but<00:03:27.790> I'm

00:03:27.869 --> 00:03:27.879 
little more here on Chrome but I'm

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:29.400 
little more here on Chrome but I'm
actually<00:03:28.030> liking<00:03:28.420> the<00:03:28.750> ability<00:03:29.109> to<00:03:29.200> scroll

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
actually liking the ability to scroll

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:35.000 
actually liking the ability to scroll
quickly<00:03:29.859> on<00:03:30.069> s3<00:03:30.910> a<00:03:31.269> little<00:03:31.569> bit<00:03:31.660> better<00:03:31.840> here

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.500 

then<00:03:36.010> let's<00:03:36.250> try<00:03:36.430> a<00:03:36.459> little<00:03:36.609> bit<00:03:36.849> of<00:03:36.940> pinch<00:03:37.269> to

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
then let's try a little bit of pinch to

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:43.020 
then let's try a little bit of pinch to
zoom<00:03:40.620> and<00:03:41.620> everything<00:03:42.130> is<00:03:42.250> running<00:03:42.459> perfectly

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
zoom and everything is running perfectly

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.240 
zoom and everything is running perfectly
fine<00:03:43.329> on<00:03:43.389> both<00:03:43.599> devices<00:03:43.989> they're<00:03:44.590> both<00:03:44.859> going

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
fine on both devices they're both going

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:51.000 
fine on both devices they're both going
very<00:03:45.730> very<00:03:45.880> smoothly<00:03:46.480> here<00:03:49.919> everything<00:03:50.919> is

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
very very smoothly here everything is

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:52.170 
very very smoothly here everything is
running<00:03:51.220> fine<00:03:51.430> now<00:03:51.609> let's<00:03:51.790> see<00:03:51.880> if<00:03:51.940> we<00:03:52.000> can<00:03:52.090> get

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
running fine now let's see if we can get

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:53.789 
running fine now let's see if we can get
the<00:03:52.299> full<00:03:52.480> side<00:03:52.720> up<00:03:52.900> and<00:03:53.079> see<00:03:53.200> how<00:03:53.290> each<00:03:53.500> site

devices so we'll launch each app and see

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:10.119 
devices so we'll launch each app and see
you<00:05:05.960> nope<00:05:06.590> nope<00:05:06.919> bat<00:05:07.189> bat<00:05:08.169> all<00:05:09.169> right<00:05:09.349> we'll

Dima<00:05:40.759> Aria<00:05:41.180> showed<00:05:41.960> me<00:05:44.139> yep<00:05:45.699> it's<00:05:46.699> pretty<00:05:46.940> fun

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:47.090 
Dima Aria showed me yep it's pretty fun

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:51.309 
Dima Aria showed me yep it's pretty fun
game<00:05:47.120> I<00:05:47.509> play<00:05:47.720> it<00:05:47.780> quite<00:05:47.990> often<00:05:48.199> now<00:05:49.449> so<00:05:50.449> right

00:05:51.309 --> 00:05:51.319 
game I play it quite often now so right

00:05:51.319 --> 00:05:53.170 
game I play it quite often now so right
now<00:05:51.349> we<00:05:51.560> figured<00:05:52.009> out<00:05:52.130> that<00:05:52.460> between<00:05:52.880> the<00:05:53.000> two

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:53.180 
now we figured out that between the two

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:55.059 
now we figured out that between the two
devices<00:05:53.300> i'm<00:05:53.930> thinking<00:05:54.410> that<00:05:54.440> both<00:05:54.860> are

00:05:55.059 --> 00:05:55.069 
devices i'm thinking that both are

00:05:55.069 --> 00:05:56.469 
devices i'm thinking that both are
incredibly<00:05:55.520> smooth<00:05:55.849> but<00:05:56.090> there's<00:05:56.240> just<00:05:56.270> a

00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:56.479 
incredibly smooth but there's just a

00:05:56.479 --> 00:05:59.129 
incredibly smooth but there's just a
little<00:05:56.810> bit<00:05:56.930> of<00:05:57.020> an<00:05:57.110> edge<00:05:57.259> in<00:05:57.500> speed<00:05:57.919> for<00:05:58.699> the

00:05:59.129 --> 00:05:59.139 
little bit of an edge in speed for the

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:02.529 
little bit of an edge in speed for the
