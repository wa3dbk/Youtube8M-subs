00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:26.110
 hi to all friends of x fi2 we are here 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:31.180
 with the stereo phone 5 if you can 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:33.940
 see and recently restored as the 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:37.000
 beta 3 from some problems and has come 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:39.580
 time to go through the beta 4 ok 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.900
 we helped a big improvement 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:45.970
 both as a priority and not an improvement 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:49.140
 to touch and what in fact not 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:52.900
 it worked right in the previous beta 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:55.120
 ok let's go and see an old man together 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:59.580
 video I had made that shows 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.580
 just the touch and not working 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:11.760
 let's go and see together let's go into 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:17.350
 touch and add a fingerprint a 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:20.220
 place our index to register 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.220
 in prompt 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.630
 mobile phone will show various video problems 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:43.250
 among which I try to make another finger in 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.080
 previously what I had already registered the 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.200
 finger one that was the thumb 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:53.210
 so let's go to set up the system 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:58.960
 device turn on let's go to 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:02:01.970
 place the thumb just to make us of 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:05.060
 he will tell us again and again until he is there 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:08.380
 ste rino choice to enter the 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.380
 code to unlock the device 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:15.920
 ok with the beta 4 the problem has cost 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:18.380
 almost definitively eliminated let's go 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:24.200
 to see together I have registered both 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:27.610
 thumb that lynch ok is unlocked 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.610
 as you can see in a short time 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.900
 ok 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:40.140
 even with the index read what we go to 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:45.240
 see together device comes 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:47.340
 unlocked, we hope you can 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:51.000
 completely solve this problem 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:54.750
 that how serious and with the next 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.090
 output of ios 7.1 currently there has been 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:00.360
 an improvement then probably the 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.490
 problem is not hardware but a 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.070
 software problem so we wait 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:07.350
 the exit 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:10.850
 keep following us gian mario gelardi 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.850
 and then faible puntonet
