shot<00:00:29.699> out<00:00:29.910> because<00:00:30.330> they<00:00:30.570> have<00:00:30.869> this<00:00:31.109> thing

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
shot out because they have this thing

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.130 
shot out because they have this thing
called<00:00:31.560> salmon<00:00:32.130> actually<00:00:32.460> and<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.600> Kazim<00:00:33.989> the

spawn<00:00:37.020> within<00:00:37.530> I<00:00:37.559> think<00:00:37.890> it's<00:00:38.010> about<00:00:38.219> a<00:00:38.280> half<00:00:38.550> a

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
spawn within I think it's about a half a

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
mile of the Falls because the water the

million federal funding and then the
electric<00:01:48.920> cooperative<00:01:49.310> borrowed<00:01:49.820> about

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
electric cooperative borrowed about

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:51.760 
electric cooperative borrowed about

finish<00:01:52.670> the<00:01:52.820> project<00:01:53.000> and<00:01:53.569> that's<00:01:54.350> one<00:01:54.530> of<00:01:54.560> the

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
finish the project and that's one of the

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.109 
finish the project and that's one of the
reasons<00:01:55.130> why<00:01:55.280> are<00:01:55.460> the<00:01:55.610> cost<00:01:55.819> of<00:01:56.000> our

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
reasons why are the cost of our

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:58.179 
reasons why are the cost of our
electricity<00:01:56.569> is<00:01:56.840> so<00:01:57.170> high<00:01:57.380> still<00:01:57.799> is<00:01:58.009> because

00:01:58.179 --> 00:01:58.189 
electricity is so high still is because

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:01.149 
electricity is so high still is because
we're<00:01:58.549> still<00:01:58.729> paying<00:01:59.030> off<00:01:59.240> that<00:01:59.270> loan<00:01:59.950> this<00:02:00.950> is

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:01.159 
we're still paying off that loan this is

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:03.069 
we're still paying off that loan this is
our<00:02:01.310> intake<00:02:01.729> deck<00:02:02.060> here<00:02:02.360> there<00:02:02.780> are<00:02:02.869> big<00:02:03.049> holes

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:03.079 
our intake deck here there are big holes

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:05.620 
our intake deck here there are big holes
in<00:02:03.530> the<00:02:03.590> concrete<00:02:03.890> and<00:02:04.460> so<00:02:05.090> the<00:02:05.240> water<00:02:05.479> is

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
in the concrete and so the water is

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.229 
in the concrete and so the water is
coming<00:02:05.899> in<00:02:06.170> here<00:02:06.530> goes<00:02:07.399> through<00:02:07.700> some<00:02:07.939> trash

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239 
coming in here goes through some trash

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:11.020 
coming in here goes through some trash
tracks<00:02:08.629> to<00:02:09.560> help<00:02:09.590> keep<00:02:09.979> the<00:02:10.130> trash<00:02:10.429> out<00:02:10.729> and

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
tracks to help keep the trash out and

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.960 
tracks to help keep the trash out and
then<00:02:11.660> there's<00:02:12.349> a<00:02:12.440> five-foot<00:02:13.010> pipe<00:02:13.310> down<00:02:13.610> there

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
then there's a five-foot pipe down there

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.400 
then there's a five-foot pipe down there
and<00:02:14.180> you'll<00:02:14.299> be<00:02:14.330> able<00:02:14.480> to<00:02:14.630> see<00:02:14.810> the<00:02:14.930> pipe<00:02:15.110> once

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
and you'll be able to see the pipe once

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.870 
and you'll be able to see the pipe once
we<00:02:15.560> go<00:02:15.739> down<00:02:15.920> in<00:02:16.130> the<00:02:16.160> turbine<00:02:16.579> room<00:02:18.730> let's<00:02:19.730> go

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
we go down in the turbine room let's go

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.089 
we go down in the turbine room let's go
down<00:02:20.060> down<00:02:20.450> in<00:02:20.660> the<00:02:20.780> pit<00:02:20.959> here

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
down down in the pit here

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:26.479 
down down in the pit here
so<00:02:23.670> we're<00:02:23.909> 120<00:02:24.719> feet<00:02:24.870> underground<00:02:25.260> here<00:02:25.829> this

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
so we're 120 feet underground here this

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:29.360 
so we're 120 feet underground here this
is<00:02:26.670> the<00:02:26.819> penstock<00:02:27.389> the<00:02:28.230> penstock<00:02:28.889> is<00:02:29.159> where

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
is the penstock the penstock is where

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.459 
is the penstock the penstock is where
all<00:02:29.549> the<00:02:29.760> water<00:02:29.909> is<00:02:30.180> coming<00:02:30.450> for<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:31.079> turbine

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:31.469 
all the water is coming for the turbine

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:35.539 
all the water is coming for the turbine
out<00:02:31.829> of<00:02:32.129> the<00:02:32.280> river<00:02:32.489> into<00:02:32.849> the<00:02:33.180> penstock<00:02:34.549> down

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549 
out of the river into the penstock down

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:37.610 
out of the river into the penstock down
under<00:02:35.939> the<00:02:36.060> concrete<00:02:36.299> and<00:02:36.840> then<00:02:36.989> splits<00:02:37.409> off

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
under the concrete and then splits off

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.699 
under the concrete and then splits off
into<00:02:37.650> the<00:02:38.189> two<00:02:38.370> turbine<00:02:38.840> we<00:02:39.840> are<00:02:40.049> lucky<00:02:40.500> here

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
into the two turbine we are lucky here

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.550 
into the two turbine we are lucky here
to<00:02:40.859> have<00:02:41.010> this<00:02:41.250> hydropower<00:02:42.230> having<00:02:43.230> lived

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
to have this hydropower having lived

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.879 
to have this hydropower having lived
here<00:02:44.269> for<00:02:45.269> a<00:02:45.299> long<00:02:45.389> time<00:02:45.659> and<00:02:48.260> lived<00:02:49.260> here<00:02:49.620> when

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:49.889 
here for a long time and lived here when

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:51.860 
here for a long time and lived here when
we<00:02:50.129> had<00:02:50.340> to<00:02:50.489> make<00:02:50.700> our<00:02:50.909> own<00:02:50.939> power<00:02:51.359> with<00:02:51.719> our

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
we had to make our own power with our

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.750 
we had to make our own power with our
own<00:02:52.079> generators<00:02:52.709> I<00:02:52.919> don't<00:02:53.099> ever<00:02:53.280> want<00:02:53.549> to<00:02:53.639> go

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
own generators I don't ever want to go

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.119 
own generators I don't ever want to go
back<00:02:53.939> to<00:02:54.150> that<00:02:54.349> commercial<00:02:55.349> power<00:02:55.620> is<00:02:55.950> the

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:56.129 
back to that commercial power is the

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:57.470 
back to that commercial power is the
best<00:02:56.370> thing<00:02:56.609> that's<00:02:56.639> ever<00:02:56.909> happened<00:02:57.209> to

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
best thing that's ever happened to

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.949 
best thing that's ever happened to
Alaska<00:02:58.139> and<00:02:58.500> especially<00:02:58.950> to<00:02:59.189> Bush<00:02:59.400> Alaska

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
Alaska and especially to Bush Alaska

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.659 
Alaska and especially to Bush Alaska
having<00:03:00.959> commercial<00:03:01.439> power<00:03:01.650> brought<00:03:02.430> Bush

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:02.669 
having commercial power brought Bush

00:03:02.669 --> 00:03:05.390 
having commercial power brought Bush
Alaska<00:03:02.969> out<00:03:03.239> of<00:03:03.419> the<00:03:03.510> dark<00:03:03.719> ages<00:03:04.250> people<00:03:05.250> can

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
Alaska out of the dark ages people can

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.459 
Alaska out of the dark ages people can
have<00:03:05.579> a<00:03:05.609> TV<00:03:05.969> they<00:03:06.419> can<00:03:06.449> have<00:03:06.750> a<00:03:06.780> refrigerator

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:07.469 
have a TV they can have a refrigerator

00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:09.099 
have a TV they can have a refrigerator
they<00:03:07.769> can<00:03:07.949> have<00:03:08.099> a<00:03:08.129> freezer

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:09.109 
they can have a freezer

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:12.349 
they can have a freezer
it's<00:03:10.109> just<00:03:10.439> it's<00:03:11.280> so<00:03:11.549> much<00:03:11.609> easier<00:03:11.760> than

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:12.359 
it's just it's so much easier than

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:14.420 
it's just it's so much easier than
running<00:03:12.510> your<00:03:12.810> own<00:03:12.840> generator<00:03:13.439> and<00:03:13.769> then

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
running your own generator and then

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.390 
running your own generator and then
especially<00:03:14.669> having<00:03:15.389> the<00:03:15.510> hydropower<00:03:16.139> is<00:03:16.560> so

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
especially having the hydropower is so

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.280 
especially having the hydropower is so
cool<00:03:17.730> when<00:03:18.090> you're<00:03:18.239> down<00:03:18.419> in<00:03:18.449> new<00:03:18.750> Halon<00:03:19.169> you

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
cool when you're down in new Halon you

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.770 
cool when you're down in new Halon you
don't<00:03:19.469> hear<00:03:19.680> diesel<00:03:20.040> generators<00:03:20.549> running<00:03:20.819> you

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
don't hear diesel generators running you

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.839 
don't hear diesel generators running you
don't<00:03:21.989> smell<00:03:22.469> diesel<00:03:22.799> generators<00:03:23.549> running

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:23.849 
don't smell diesel generators running

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:26.750 
don't smell diesel generators running
every<00:03:24.689> hour<00:03:24.989> that<00:03:25.409> we<00:03:25.620> keep<00:03:25.859> this<00:03:26.040> hydro<00:03:26.459> plant

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
every hour that we keep this hydro plant

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.119 
every hour that we keep this hydro plant
going<00:03:27.209> is<00:03:27.419> an<00:03:27.599> hour<00:03:27.780> that<00:03:28.229> our<00:03:28.349> diesel<00:03:28.739> engines

00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:29.129 
going is an hour that our diesel engines

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:32.599 
going is an hour that our diesel engines
aren't<00:03:29.340> running<00:03:29.579> and<00:03:31.040> people<00:03:32.040> don't<00:03:32.220> have<00:03:32.459> to

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:32.609 
aren't running and people don't have to

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:34.969 
aren't running and people don't have to
pay<00:03:32.759> for<00:03:32.790> the<00:03:33.000> fuel<00:03:33.239> that's<00:03:33.569> the<00:03:33.870> best<00:03:34.379> part<00:03:34.650> if

00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:34.979 
pay for the fuel that's the best part if

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:37.729 
pay for the fuel that's the best part if
we're<00:03:35.340> saving<00:03:35.699> money
