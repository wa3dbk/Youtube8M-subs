well<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.580> for<00:01:20.580> some<00:01:20.729> reason<00:01:20.759> that's<00:01:21.330> not<00:01:21.509> the

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
well and for some reason that's not the

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.300 
well and for some reason that's not the
cause<00:01:21.990> of<00:01:22.020> their<00:01:22.350> characters<00:01:22.890> which<00:01:23.130> is

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
to change the sensitivity a bit more but

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.390 
to change the sensitivity a bit more but
I've<00:03:03.870> really<00:03:04.230> do<00:03:04.349> not<00:03:04.560> one<00:03:04.709> there<00:03:04.950> because<00:03:05.280> of

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
I've really do not one there because of

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.009 
I've really do not one there because of
the<00:03:05.489> videos<00:03:05.819> sake<00:03:07.640> and<00:03:08.640> I<00:03:08.910> cannot<00:03:09.450> seem<00:03:09.989> to

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
the videos sake and I cannot seem to

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:14.349 
the videos sake and I cannot seem to
move<00:03:11.450> and<00:03:12.450> George's<00:03:13.049> on<00:03:13.170> his<00:03:13.290> period<00:03:13.590> again<00:03:14.040> I

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:14.359 
move and George's on his period again I

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:16.340 
move and George's on his period again I
think<00:03:15.359> that<00:03:15.480> you<00:03:15.600> might<00:03:15.750> be<00:03:15.810> glitzed<00:03:16.260> out

think that you might be glitzed out

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.110 
think that you might be glitzed out
because<00:03:16.739> I<00:03:16.799> did<00:03:17.069> nothing<00:03:17.400> to<00:03:17.760> learn<00:03:17.940> and
