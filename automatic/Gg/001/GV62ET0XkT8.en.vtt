00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
here show what type of motor controller

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:54.950 
here show what type of motor controller
it<00:00:47.280> is<00:00:47.430> I<00:00:49.219> think<00:00:50.219> there<00:00:50.820> grab<00:00:51.120> it<00:00:53.180> it's<00:00:54.180> a<00:00:54.420> multi

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
it is I think there grab it it's a multi

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.889 
it is I think there grab it it's a multi
store<00:00:55.199> up<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:55.649> 30<00:00:56.640> amp<00:00:56.910> ere<00:00:57.829> up<00:00:58.829> to<00:00:59.100> version<00:00:59.899> and

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
store up to 30 amp ere up to version and

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:09.770 
store up to 30 amp ere up to version and
I<00:01:00.960> got<00:01:01.140> four<00:01:01.469> of<00:01:01.500> them<00:01:08.299> control<00:01:09.299> it<00:01:09.420> with<00:01:09.600> my

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
I got four of them control it with my

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:18.440 
I got four of them control it with my
multiplexer<00:01:10.590> transmitter<00:01:15.740> and<00:01:16.970> listen<00:01:17.970> to

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
multiplexer transmitter and listen to

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.539 
multiplexer transmitter and listen to
the<00:01:18.630> sound<00:01:19.080> of<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.530> motor<00:01:20.310> it's<00:01:21.119> not<00:01:21.360> look

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:22.549 
the sound of the motor it's not look

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:34.679 
the sound of the motor it's not look
good<00:01:23.549> at<00:01:23.610> all

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:34.689 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:42.600 

so<00:01:35.289> it's<00:01:35.890> working

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:51.200 

but<00:01:43.210> there<00:01:43.750> are<00:01:43.960> pianist<00:01:44.560> goes<00:01:44.740> up<00:01:45.010> and<00:01:45.280> down

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:02:27.580 

this<00:01:53.490> nice<00:01:54.490> food

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.140 

so<00:02:28.590> I<00:02:28.650> think<00:02:28.769> there<00:02:29.040> is<00:02:29.069> some<00:02:29.459> completely

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
so I think there is some completely

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:36.049 
so I think there is some completely
wrong<00:02:30.359> with<00:02:30.540> a<00:02:30.569> motor<00:02:31.319> controller<00:02:32.930> thank<00:02:33.930> you
