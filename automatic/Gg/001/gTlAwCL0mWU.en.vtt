 exciting minutes remain likely 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.949
 even the rents are true or false 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.539
 and post it in the comments and on 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.539

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.660
 has killed him and we get it 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.219
 even to the middle where once got 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.469
 it's about world of warcraft again 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.090
 There exists near Karat

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.320
 so can not reach 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.430
 Here you could enter through a luck gate 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.280
 but it does not work in the meantime either 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.690
 more what it is trying to hide blaster 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.370
 innumerable people turn heads over 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.350
 were attached chains have become the 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.420
 look at you roddick in 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.550
 hideaway blizzard fireplace room and 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.739
 the player is from 12 and not from 16 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.780
 why not easy on tv 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.379
 does the room really exist or leave 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:05.760

 about hedgehogs too , that's not one 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.780
 Magnificent last did not look like that 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.189
 since some time circulating filenames 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.869
 sonic point excel web 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.790
 This seems like a homemade game 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.680
 to be the on Sonic is based on the 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.210
 Title you already notice that a sick 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.780
 shit I expect my look 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.270
 that still on 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.890
 now you can knuckles in tales or 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.840
 Doktorand plays it starts with the 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.369
 good valley on the island 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.290
 because a little bit happy everything 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.970
 apart from music, the slow 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.110
 played backwards when a 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.880
 a bit more against the sudden 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.670
 parts of animals from animals 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.409
 green hill zone at ok and a few meters 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.180
 further down there you will meet a sonic 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:46.759
 black red shining eyes 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:50.790
 the man says you you get such a 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:53.910
 Suddenly followed sonic tails and 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.290
 Black dazzles you get, however 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.940
 another chance with joke and action 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.310
 commanded but where does that work 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.780
 about the same way you can sonic me up 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.910
 you are dead so soon 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.010
 appears an incredible ups or game 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:08.040
 over screen all three played shredded 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.390
 hung slaughtered and fourth 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.830
 finger no idea how the game 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.110
 but I have to say really 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.640
 good work nude what do you think of the 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.830
 whole thing and the game exists 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:20.670
 I really or only want a game with you 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:23.790
 you play when others play something to 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.680
 At first it is their thoughts 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.240
 mario similar jump'n'run one plays there 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.560
 not quite a princess 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.120
 save from the evil monster 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.740
 in the course of the game it becomes clear that she 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.570
 was kidnapped because of an error 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.040
 has committed and now tries this too 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.930
 fix in the last level flow 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.790
 together in front of the evil monster and the 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.230
 Princess few switches around teams 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.000
 get ahead so it allows that 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.270
 castle and the princess pretend 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.090
 exhaustion with her until today 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.770
 the biggest may the game is playing 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.870
 back and shows it almost as if 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.130
 the whole thing really did play that 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.080
 last level is in reality that 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.550
 first and the girl does not lie down 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.650
 sleep but only ever 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.370
 aroused and popular by the player 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.720
 in front of him 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.370
 she does not put the official circuits 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.709
 to enable moving forward to be 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.090
 but to set up is the 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.040
 possibility of the villain of the 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.540
 he wants to run a percent 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.250
 special doors can be found at the beginning 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.840
 The game would be here becomes aware 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.489
 that everything is just a cycle one man 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.959
 can not change but there is one 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:17.459
 Possibility of the princess in the course of the 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.959
 to touch the game if you can do it 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.090
 is an alternative ending over the 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:23.220
 original bug fixes by 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.400
 a new way as soon as you touch them 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.840
 explodes atomic bombs as a kind 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.799
 what's going on there are some 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.570
 possibilities to play the game 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:32.370
 interpret in the game is in one 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.810
 book was the subject scientist and 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.060
 in another book he says 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.560
 in the bunker weeks lighting had to 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.690
 one with the other together if 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.590
 he for an atomic explosion 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.060
 is jointly responsible and wishes the 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.530
 time he does not make is that 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.060
 whole game a kind of dream world in the 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.010
 rcn tries to undo his mistake 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.500
 make and notice through the eternal cycle 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.820
 that it is not possible 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.470
 that would be exactly what the game is 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.990
 symbolizes what do you think of hearts 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:04:00.860
 sorry and again plausible here 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:04:03.500
 Or me it is but it is about 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:05.209
 satan corner pokémon this time no myth 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.860
 but something terrible 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:08.870
 truth could you knew 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:11.090
 example, that was a dead pixi 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.950
 so rados carries the skull of his 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:15.200
 mother as a mask or she scary 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.970
 misses something like that sad is that 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.709
 the project jumps around his heart 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.209
 to keep moving that is when we 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:22.310
 that my fight is defeated 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:24.650
 theoretically dying is considered as 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:26.300
 delicacy what people eat pokémon 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.100
 should press a balloon held 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.050
 will introduce and young children 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.150
 but the most blatant thing is still the one 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.650
 cronies here they emerge from the halls 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.490
 longitudinal program of people can now 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:35.450
 still on their past 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.430
 recall 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:39.440
 Money is the image of a face 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.930
 you like people or funny people 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.580
 ripped off the little kids 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.230
 try to be kidnapped 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.910
 where to find the dead skull of her mother 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:49.010
 They actually wear and dolls 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:51.260
 deceased people are so much too 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:53.240
 our halls pokémon what do you think 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:56.000
 from the whole reloader background 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:58.870
 created you come or get, too 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.800
 already to the last meter 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.780
 surely some of you already have 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.770
 probably the best mix heard it for the 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:07.940
 I do not know the gutmann 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.919
 really sympathetic look as cooks 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.990
 not warm, he was mixing was next to 90s 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:13.070
 years a kind of educational game for pc at the 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:14.330
 to write that on the fast 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:16.250
 keyboard goes however it is one 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.960
 incredible blatant difficulty 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:19.910
 in the first third we only had ten 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.500
 but you can create words in a minute 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:23.510
 heard such a strange growl in the 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:25.610
 background what was getting louder in the 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:27.890
 the third level was 85 words 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:30.919
 per minute and the fifth teaching content 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:33.290
 500 words completely impossible about it 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:34.729
 Beyond that would have an extremely loudest 

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:36.410
 People even what the eardrum 

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:38.000
 could harm children by device 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:39.770
 dream about mister mix but that 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.360
 all goes much further 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:43.030
 hacker did not make it to the sixth 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.410
 hack level and really have here 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:47.600
 strange the game crashes or warning 

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:49.340
 and led in the system 230 folder 

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:51.770
 Pictures are added or will be pictures 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:52.380
 of half-dead people with distorted 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:53.910
 faces 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:55.980
 there was even someone next 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:58.260
 level without crash could see the 

00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:00.000
 follow post - traumatic stress disorder 

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.290
 nobody really knows what he saw 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.720
 but because of the fact that they are 

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:05.730
 itself misses mix and even more 

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:08.100
 has ever tried a little girl for 

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:10.290
 kidnapped has been there from be normal 

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:12.090
 what has this whole story existed 

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:13.560
 does he really measure or mix that? 

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:15.180
 a bitter taste of beige thriller 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:19.320
 partner kitchen what is true or wrong 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:23.400
 that with the 3 1 it was the space 

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:25.710
 exists - and also was sonic 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:28.740
 excel exists but the critics to 

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:31.100
 with the team called tom is nonsense that 

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:33.930
 Game brain exists and the rest 

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:36.560
 interpretation thing said 

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:39.180
 dolls infos are also all was 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:42.720
 also the story with mister mix or 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:44.310
 percent wrong would be great with not 

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:45.990
 so I liked the video you liked 

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:47.790
 if you leave German here 

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:50.340
 Let's go with the novel and down here
