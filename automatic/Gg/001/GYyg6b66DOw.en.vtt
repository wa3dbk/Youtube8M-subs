00:00:00.142 --> 00:00:05.982
Mac and cheese (classic recipe)

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.100
Ingredients: Mozarella, Cheddar cheese

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.440
unsalted butter (60 g.)

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.440
regular flour (50 g.), milk (300 ml.)

00:00:17.954 --> 00:00:18.954
macaroni (400 g.)

00:00:19.554 --> 00:00:21.214
salt, pepper

00:00:27.254 --> 00:00:30.154
Set some bowl on really low heat

00:00:31.213 --> 00:00:33.253
melt all of the butter in there

00:00:51.794 --> 00:01:04.734
then add the flour and stir until smooth paste

00:01:12.414 --> 00:01:15.354
let this hang out for a minute

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.520
time to give our mac some boiling water! (slightly salted)

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.200
now back to our sauce!

00:01:32.093 --> 00:01:33.533
add milk

00:01:39.813 --> 00:01:42.693
stir until it thickens a bit

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.720
now to the spices! add as much as you need

00:02:04.434 --> 00:02:11.414
stir really well until it thickens a bit more

00:02:14.233 --> 00:02:14.993
IMPORTANT!

00:02:15.513 --> 00:02:19.033
make sure you took your macaroni off the heat (and water) slightly undercooked!

00:02:21.253 --> 00:02:23.973
the moment of truth... CHEESE! :)

00:02:29.853 --> 00:02:33.533
Mozarella will give the sauce all its chewyness!

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.380
add as much as you have...really!

00:02:48.174 --> 00:02:52.254
while cheddar will give all its flavor!

00:02:59.475 --> 00:03:04.735
let the cheese sink in and turn off the heat. we are done here!

00:03:11.114 --> 00:03:12.114
I couldn't cut this all off

00:03:17.214 --> 00:03:18.214
let's just silently stare at all this...

00:03:21.654 --> 00:03:23.774
food... :)

00:04:03.874 --> 00:04:05.834
this is priceless IMO

00:04:10.973 --> 00:04:11.973
Subscribe if you dare enough! :)

00:04:21.975 --> 00:04:26.635
now put all this beauty to some baking dish

00:04:37.294 --> 00:04:40.514
make the top look nice and flat

00:04:47.854 --> 00:04:50.334
before OvENing it make some "glossy in the future" cheese coat

00:04:52.476 --> 00:04:56.056
preheat the oven to 180C aaand bake until golden brown

00:05:04.255 --> 00:05:05.255
Tuh-duuuuh!

00:05:15.335 --> 00:05:17.735
