in order to develop new gameplay we've

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.440 
in order to develop new gameplay we've
gone<00:00:43.170> pretty<00:00:43.860> heavy<00:00:44.130> into<00:00:44.340> rock<00:00:44.520> band<00:00:44.760> pro<00:00:45.120> and

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
gone pretty heavy into rock band pro and

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.440 
gone pretty heavy into rock band pro and
develop<00:00:46.440> two<00:00:46.740> new<00:00:46.980> peripherals<00:00:47.640> that<00:00:47.970> we're

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
develop two new peripherals that we're

on the neck that simulate the string and

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.760 
on the neck that simulate the string and
fret<00:00:56.720> intersection<00:00:57.720> it<00:00:58.170> allows<00:00:58.380> you<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.650> make

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
fret intersection it allows you to make

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.800 
fret intersection it allows you to make
the<00:00:58.890> same<00:00:59.130> left-hand<00:00:59.760> guitar<00:01:00.239> shapes<00:01:00.630> that

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:00.810 
the same left-hand guitar shapes that

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.139 
the same left-hand guitar shapes that
you<00:01:01.110> normally<00:01:01.560> that<00:01:02.430> you<00:01:02.520> would<00:01:02.640> make<00:01:02.820> playing

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
you normally that you would make playing

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.310 
you normally that you would make playing
a<00:01:03.270> real<00:01:03.450> guitar<00:01:03.860> so<00:01:04.860> it's<00:01:05.040> it's<00:01:05.399> a<00:01:06.049> pretty<00:01:07.049> good

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
a real guitar so it's it's a pretty good

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.080 
a real guitar so it's it's a pretty good
simulation<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.250> pretty<00:01:08.460> good<00:01:08.550> teaching

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
simulation and a pretty good teaching

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.180

tool<00:01:09.270> if<00:01:09.570> you<00:01:09.690> want<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.110> learn<00:01:10.290> how<00:01:10.350> to<00:01:10.620> play

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.190 
tool if you want to learn how to play

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.910 
tool if you want to learn how to play
the<00:01:11.430> guitar<00:01:11.780> in<00:01:12.780> that<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.320> buttons<00:01:13.650> are<00:01:13.770> easy

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
the guitar in that the buttons are easy

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.020 
the guitar in that the buttons are easy
to<00:01:14.070> press<00:01:14.280> you<00:01:14.430> don't<00:01:14.610> have<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.820> develop

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
to press you don't have to develop

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.330 
to press you don't have to develop
calluses<00:01:15.360> so<00:01:16.050> the<00:01:16.170> left<00:01:16.350> hand<00:01:16.440> has<00:01:16.740> buttons<00:01:17.159> to

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
calluses so the left hand has buttons to

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.820 
calluses so the left hand has buttons to
simulate<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.390> left<00:01:18.630> hand<00:01:18.900> sort<00:01:19.440> of<00:01:19.500> chord

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
simulate the the left hand sort of chord

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.620 
simulate the the left hand sort of chord
positioning<00:01:20.280> you<00:01:20.370> played<00:01:20.580> G<00:01:20.760> chords<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.180> chords

simulated<00:01:27.240> strings<00:01:27.659> that<00:01:28.020> will<00:01:28.260> pick<00:01:28.620> up

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
simulated strings that will pick up

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:32.180 
simulated strings that will pick up
where<00:01:29.909> you<00:01:29.940> pluck<00:01:30.299> and<00:01:30.799> translate<00:01:31.799> that<00:01:31.950> data
