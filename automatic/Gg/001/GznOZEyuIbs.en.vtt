00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.620
 perfect 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.290
 He said it 's pretty funny because of the 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.510
 music is awesome that's why I think that 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.190
 that's worth it but let's also say 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.040
 that he can not copy and he always knew 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:25.240
 copy then 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.240
