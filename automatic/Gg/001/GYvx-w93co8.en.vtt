what I think is this mp5 not to be

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.780

mistaken<00:01:15.020> for<00:01:15.110> the<00:01:15.290> MPO<00:01:15.740> 5<00:01:16.100> and<00:01:16.430> he<00:01:16.490> also<00:01:16.610> has

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
mistaken for the MPO 5 and he also has

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.069

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:30.190 
really wish they did but you can use
them<00:01:28.400> to<00:01:28.549> hold<00:01:28.820> other<00:01:29.090> guns<00:01:29.450> which<00:01:29.720> is<00:01:29.869> really

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200

perfectly that white paint it could have

perfectly that white paint it could have
been<00:01:58.759> a<00:01:58.789> little<00:01:58.939> better<00:01:59.180> but<00:01:59.570> you<00:01:59.780> know<00:01:59.810> for

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
been a little better but you know for

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.109 
been a little better but you know for
the<00:02:00.259> most<00:02:00.439> part<00:02:00.590> it's<00:02:00.950> not<00:02:01.009> terrible<00:02:01.640> you<00:02:01.939> just

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
the most part it's not terrible you just

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:03.429 
the most part it's not terrible you just
tell<00:02:02.299> when<00:02:02.450> you<00:02:02.539> look<00:02:02.659> in<00:02:02.780> the<00:02:02.810> center<00:02:03.079> it's<00:02:03.350> a

tell when you look in the center it's a

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:04.929 
tell when you look in the center it's a
little<00:02:03.649> crooked<00:02:03.860> that<00:02:04.219> plastic<00:02:04.670> looks<00:02:04.850> a

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:04.939 
little crooked that plastic looks a

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:06.609 
little crooked that plastic looks a
little<00:02:05.119> crackly<00:02:05.570> on<00:02:05.840> the<00:02:05.930> side<00:02:06.170> of<00:02:06.200> his<00:02:06.409> head

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 
little crackly on the side of his head

these<00:02:06.950> shoulder<00:02:07.369> pads<00:02:07.399> are<00:02:08.000> sick<00:02:08.570> I<00:02:08.990> think

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
these shoulder pads are sick I think

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.840 
these shoulder pads are sick I think
that<00:02:09.500> is<00:02:09.649> awesome<00:02:09.860> can<00:02:10.310> see<00:02:10.430> a<00:02:10.460> little<00:02:10.700> bit<00:02:10.789> of

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
that is awesome can see a little bit of

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.100 
that is awesome can see a little bit of
the<00:02:10.910> black<00:02:11.120> plastic<00:02:11.390> coming<00:02:11.840> up<00:02:11.960> from

the black plastic coming up from

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.780 
the black plastic coming up from

underneath the white paint over here and

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.070 
underneath the white paint over here and
that<00:02:13.910> goes<00:02:14.120> throughout<00:02:14.420> the<00:02:14.600> whole<00:02:14.720> figure<00:02:14.930> I

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
that goes throughout the whole figure I

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.810 
that goes throughout the whole figure I
think<00:02:15.260> the<00:02:15.350> spider<00:02:15.620> logo<00:02:16.040> looks<00:02:16.250> pretty<00:02:16.520> clean

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:16.820

on a hinge or anything like that now the

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.240 
on a hinge or anything like that now the
best<00:02:30.480> is<00:02:30.629> only<00:02:30.690> detachable<00:02:31.260> on<00:02:31.500> the<00:02:31.650> left<00:02:31.890> side

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250

over here there are no tabs that come

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.449 
over here there are no tabs that come
apart<00:02:34.140> on<00:02:34.260> this<00:02:34.470> side<00:02:34.620> so<00:02:34.860> if<00:02:34.980> you<00:02:35.069> want<00:02:35.190> to<00:02:35.280> get

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
apart on this side so if you want to get

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:36.680 
apart on this side so if you want to get
completely<00:02:35.819> off<00:02:35.910> it's<00:02:36.209> going<00:02:36.300> to<00:02:36.390> be<00:02:36.480> kind<00:02:36.660> of

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
completely off it's going to be kind of

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.059 
completely off it's going to be kind of
difficult<00:02:36.930> now<00:02:37.230> this<00:02:37.349> part<00:02:37.560> of<00:02:37.620> the<00:02:37.680> arm<00:02:37.830> is

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
difficult now this part of the arm is

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:39.500 
difficult now this part of the arm is
very<00:02:38.190> familiar<00:02:38.700> and<00:02:38.730> they've<00:02:39.000> added<00:02:39.239> these

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
very familiar and they've added these

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.509 
very familiar and they've added these
new<00:02:39.780> sections<00:02:40.170> right<00:02:40.349> here<00:02:40.410> for<00:02:40.860> the<00:02:40.980> forearms

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
new sections right here for the forearms

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:42.710 
new sections right here for the forearms
and<00:02:41.610> I<00:02:41.700> think<00:02:41.879> that<00:02:42.030> looks<00:02:42.239> great

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
and I think that looks great

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.630 
and I think that looks great
these<00:02:42.989> hands<00:02:43.290> are<00:02:43.470> sculpted<00:02:43.860> a<00:02:43.950> little<00:02:44.400> weird

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
these hands are sculpted a little weird

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:45.979 
these hands are sculpted a little weird
when<00:02:44.849> he's<00:02:44.940> holding<00:02:45.120> his<00:02:45.390> guns<00:02:45.630> it<00:02:45.840> always

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
when he's holding his guns it always

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:47.660 
when he's holding his guns it always
just<00:02:46.290> looks<00:02:46.500> a<00:02:46.650> little<00:02:46.800> strange<00:02:47.250> having

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
just looks a little strange having

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.030 
just looks a little strange having
imposed<00:02:48.000> like<00:02:48.269> that<00:02:48.510> because<00:02:49.230> this<00:02:49.530> finger

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
imposed like that because this finger

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.070 
imposed like that because this finger
right<00:02:50.250> here<00:02:50.280> has<00:02:50.849> ring<00:02:51.090> fingers<00:02:51.480> sticking<00:02:51.930> out

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
and the rest of them are kind of tucked

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.280 
and the rest of them are kind of tucked
in<00:02:53.760> so<00:02:54.000> it<00:02:54.420> always<00:02:54.569> just<00:02:54.870> looks<00:02:55.080> a<00:02:55.260> little

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
in so it always just looks a little

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:56.960 
in so it always just looks a little
weird<00:02:55.890> that<00:02:56.160> looks<00:02:56.280> like<00:02:56.400> it's<00:02:56.549> aimed<00:02:56.819> a

weird that looks like it's aimed a
little<00:02:57.209> better<00:02:57.420> but<00:02:57.690> it<00:02:57.900> looks<00:02:58.049> weird<00:02:58.260> without

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
little better but it looks weird without

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:59.750
