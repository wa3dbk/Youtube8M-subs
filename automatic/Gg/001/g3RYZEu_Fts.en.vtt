hygiene<00:00:10.830> and<00:00:11.070> in<00:00:12.030> my<00:00:12.210> journey<00:00:12.570> I've<00:00:12.750> just

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
hygiene and in my journey I've just

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.689 
hygiene and in my journey I've just
realized<00:00:13.380> that<00:00:14.540> flossing<00:00:15.540> is<00:00:16.160> more<00:00:17.160> effective

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
realized that flossing is more effective

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.670 
realized that flossing is more effective
than<00:00:17.730> brushing<00:00:18.180> your<00:00:18.570> teeth<00:00:18.840> and<00:00:19.050> I<00:00:19.410> use<00:00:19.650> both

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
than brushing your teeth and I use both

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.670 
than brushing your teeth and I use both
in<00:00:20.160> tandem<00:00:20.640> and<00:00:20.789> just<00:00:21.689> realizing<00:00:22.350> that<00:00:22.380> a<00:00:22.470> lot

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
in tandem and just realizing that a lot

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.550 
in tandem and just realizing that a lot
of<00:00:22.800> people<00:00:23.100> don't<00:00:23.250> floss<00:00:23.580> and<00:00:24.019> I<00:00:25.019> remember<00:00:25.439> my

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
of people don't floss and I remember my

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.040 
of people don't floss and I remember my
dentist<00:00:26.039> this<00:00:26.160> was<00:00:26.369> maybe<00:00:27.359> about<00:00:27.630> ten<00:00:27.900> years

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
dentist this was maybe about ten years

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.599 
dentist this was maybe about ten years
ago<00:00:28.380> more<00:00:28.980> than<00:00:29.039> that

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
ago more than that

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.420 
ago more than that
he<00:00:29.970> said<00:00:30.179> if<00:00:30.510> you<00:00:31.109> floss<00:00:31.470> you<00:00:31.740> never<00:00:31.980> have<00:00:32.219> to

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
he said if you floss you never have to

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.590 
he said if you floss you never have to
come<00:00:32.669> to<00:00:33.090> me<00:00:33.239> again<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:35.000> I've<00:00:36.000> never<00:00:36.360> been

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
come to me again and I've never been

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.950 
come to me again and I've never been
back<00:00:36.780> since<00:00:37.079> and<00:00:39.050> what<00:00:40.050> is<00:00:40.200> flossing<00:00:40.790> just

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
back since and what is flossing just

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.380 
back since and what is flossing just
this<00:00:42.960> string<00:00:43.410> that<00:00:43.739> we<00:00:44.579> use<00:00:44.820> between<00:00:45.059> our

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
this string that we use between our

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:53.869 
this string that we use between our
teeths<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:47.600> it<00:00:48.600> has<00:00:49.370> tremendous<00:00:52.879> potential

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
teeths and it has tremendous potential

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.650 
teeths and it has tremendous potential
for<00:00:54.870> your<00:00:54.989> teeth<00:00:55.289> and<00:00:55.879> it's<00:00:56.879> helped<00:00:57.210> me<00:00:57.360> in<00:00:57.390> my

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
for your teeth and it's helped me in my

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.840 
for your teeth and it's helped me in my
journey<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:58.289> just<00:00:59.010> what<00:00:59.550> it<00:00:59.670> does

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
journey and just what it does

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.599 
journey and just what it does
essentially<00:01:00.359> is<00:01:00.570> that<00:01:00.809> it<00:01:01.500> can<00:01:01.770> prevent<00:01:02.100> tooth

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
essentially is that it can prevent tooth

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:08.090 
essentially is that it can prevent tooth
decay<00:01:02.640> gum<00:01:03.270> disease<00:01:04.970> halitosis<00:01:05.970> because<00:01:07.100> it's

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
decay gum disease halitosis because it's

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.380 
decay gum disease halitosis because it's
hard<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.400> build<00:01:08.670> up<00:01:08.850> because<00:01:09.030> this<00:01:09.330> is

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
hard to build up because this is

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.210 
hard to build up because this is
essentially<00:01:10.080> it's<00:01:10.200> removing<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.740> plaque<00:01:10.979> the

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
essentially it's removing the plaque the

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.340 
essentially it's removing the plaque the
plaque<00:01:11.250> which<00:01:11.670> is<00:01:11.880> building<00:01:12.750> up<00:01:12.930> through<00:01:13.170> all

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
plaque which is building up through all

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.160 
plaque which is building up through all
of<00:01:13.380> this<00:01:14.090> food<00:01:15.090> that<00:01:15.299> we're<00:01:15.450> eating<00:01:15.570> which<00:01:15.990> is

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
of this food that we're eating which is

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.380 
of this food that we're eating which is
heavily<00:01:16.799> processed<00:01:17.130> heavily<00:01:17.970> refined

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
heavily processed heavily refined

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.780 
heavily processed heavily refined
essentially<00:01:19.020> flossing<00:01:19.920> is<00:01:20.130> getting<00:01:20.580> in

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
essentially flossing is getting in

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.399 
essentially flossing is getting in
between<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.180> teeth<00:01:21.479> and<00:01:22.700> this<00:01:23.700> white<00:01:24.409> string

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
between the teeth and this white string

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.010 
between the teeth and this white string
I<00:01:25.680> don't<00:01:25.979> have<00:01:26.159> it<00:01:26.310> right<00:01:26.729> now<00:01:26.939> but<00:01:27.659> when

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
I don't have it right now but when

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.730 
I don't have it right now but when
you're<00:01:28.140> just<00:01:28.530> flossing<00:01:28.829> that<00:01:29.640> whole<00:01:29.850> motion

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
you're just flossing that whole motion

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.910 
you're just flossing that whole motion
essentially<00:01:31.740> it<00:01:32.070> is<00:01:33.409> really<00:01:34.409> getting<00:01:34.710> rid<00:01:34.890> of

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
essentially it is really getting rid of

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.630 
essentially it is really getting rid of
all<00:01:35.250> of<00:01:35.430> that<00:01:35.460> plaque<00:01:36.060> which<00:01:36.659> even<00:01:37.079> can<00:01:37.290> even

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
all of that plaque which even can even

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.160 
all of that plaque which even can even
trickle<00:01:38.640> down<00:01:38.670> into<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.299> bloodstream<00:01:39.570> and

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
trickle down into the bloodstream and

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.399 
trickle down into the bloodstream and
create<00:01:40.500> heart<00:01:41.159> disease<00:01:41.549> but<00:01:42.540> there's<00:01:43.110> just<00:01:43.290> a

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
create heart disease but there's just a

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.800 
create heart disease but there's just a
lot<00:01:43.439> of<00:01:43.649> research<00:01:44.040> on<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:45.210> benefits<00:01:45.390> of

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
lot of research on the benefits of

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.270 
lot of research on the benefits of
flossing<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:48.170> that's<00:01:49.170> it<00:01:49.439> infinite<00:01:49.950> waters

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
flossing and that's it infinite waters

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.259 
flossing and that's it infinite waters
