action<00:04:35.730> actor<00:04:36.150> motion<00:04:36.600> ones<00:04:40.130> okay<00:04:41.130> and<00:04:41.880> we'll

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
action actor motion ones okay and we'll

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.150 
action actor motion ones okay and we'll
just<00:04:42.840> have<00:04:43.050> it<00:04:43.169> set<00:04:43.320> the<00:04:43.410> x<00:04:43.590> speed<00:04:43.889> to<00:04:44.100> zero

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
just have it set the x speed to zero

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.420 
just have it set the x speed to zero
when<00:04:44.970> left<00:04:45.450> key<00:04:45.780> and<00:04:46.110> right<00:04:46.590> key<00:04:46.800> is<00:04:46.889> not<00:04:47.130> being

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
when left key and right key is not being

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.700 
when left key and right key is not being
pressed<00:04:47.760> which<00:04:48.630> is<00:04:48.780> exactly<00:04:48.960> what<00:04:49.380> we<00:04:49.470> wanted

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
pressed which is exactly what we wanted

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.580 
pressed which is exactly what we wanted
to<00:04:49.770> do<00:04:50.240> so<00:04:51.240> whenever<00:04:51.510> you<00:04:51.600> stop<00:04:51.930> pushing<00:04:52.380> left

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
to do so whenever you stop pushing left

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.330 
to do so whenever you stop pushing left
and<00:04:52.860> right<00:04:53.100> the<00:04:53.550> plane<00:04:54.060> will<00:04:54.240> be<00:04:54.360> at<00:04:54.450> rest<00:04:55.340> so

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
and right the plane will be at rest so

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:01.700 
and right the plane will be at rest so
left<00:04:56.760> stop<00:04:57.210> right<00:04:57.750> stop<00:04:59.000> perfect<00:05:00.000> and<00:05:00.870> then

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 
left stop right stop perfect and then

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.250 
left stop right stop perfect and then
once<00:05:01.919> again<00:05:02.690> what<00:05:03.690> we're<00:05:03.810> actually<00:05:03.930> going<00:05:04.140> to

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:04.260 
once again what we're actually going to

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:05.780 
once again what we're actually going to
have<00:05:04.500> to<00:05:04.650> pull<00:05:04.919> this<00:05:05.070> off<00:05:05.220> because<00:05:05.280> if<00:05:05.580> I<00:05:05.669> were

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:05.790 
have to pull this off because if I were

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:08.840 
have to pull this off because if I were
to<00:05:05.910> right<00:05:06.270> click<00:05:06.540> and<00:05:06.960> duplicate<00:05:07.770> then<00:05:08.730> it

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:08.850 
to right click and duplicate then it

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:10.040 
to right click and duplicate then it
would<00:05:08.970> actually<00:05:09.060> duplicate<00:05:09.630> the<00:05:09.720> entire

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.050 
would actually duplicate the entire

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:11.930 
would actually duplicate the entire
block<00:05:10.440> and<00:05:10.740> not<00:05:10.919> just<00:05:11.100> the<00:05:11.220> one<00:05:11.340> piece<00:05:11.669> that<00:05:11.880> I

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 
block and not just the one piece that I

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.970 
block and not just the one piece that I
want<00:05:12.150> and<00:05:12.390> then<00:05:13.200> we'll<00:05:13.380> just<00:05:13.560> change<00:05:13.710> these

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:13.980 
want and then we'll just change these

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:18.710 
want and then we'll just change these
controls<00:05:14.460> once<00:05:14.730> again<00:05:14.820> to<00:05:15.210> up<00:05:15.450> and<00:05:15.750> down<00:05:17.720> you

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
controls once again to up and down you

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:19.790 
controls once again to up and down you
let<00:05:18.900> us<00:05:18.930> have<00:05:19.110> a<00:05:19.140> lot<00:05:19.290> of<00:05:19.320> times<00:05:19.560> when<00:05:19.710> you're

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
let us have a lot of times when you're

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.590 
let us have a lot of times when you're
programming<00:05:20.010> that<00:05:20.580> you<00:05:20.790> can<00:05:20.970> save<00:05:21.330> a<00:05:21.360> lot<00:05:21.540> of

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:21.600 
programming that you can save a lot of

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.870 
programming that you can save a lot of
steps<00:05:21.960> by<00:05:22.260> just<00:05:22.530> writing<00:05:22.770> similar<00:05:23.220> code<00:05:23.580> that

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:23.880 
steps by just writing similar code that

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:28.250 
steps by just writing similar code that
you<00:05:23.970> can<00:05:24.150> reproduce<00:05:26.540> okay<00:05:27.540> once<00:05:27.930> he<00:05:28.050> get<00:05:28.169> to

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:28.260 
you can reproduce okay once he get to

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.670 
you can reproduce okay once he get to
test<00:05:28.500> it<00:05:28.650> out<00:05:29.030> show<00:05:30.030> you<00:05:30.120> that<00:05:30.210> up<00:05:30.419> stop<00:05:31.260> down

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 
test it out show you that up stop down

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.480 
test it out show you that up stop down
stop<00:05:32.190> left<00:05:32.850> on<00:05:33.240> tried<00:05:33.540> stop<00:05:33.870> perfect<00:05:34.280> and<00:05:35.280> you

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:35.490 
stop left on tried stop perfect and you

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:36.950 
stop left on tried stop perfect and you
can<00:05:35.580> start<00:05:35.760> cruising<00:05:36.120> around<00:05:36.180> with<00:05:36.570> the<00:05:36.660> plane

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 
can start cruising around with the plane

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.659 
can start cruising around with the plane
and<00:05:37.380> then<00:05:37.650> once<00:05:37.830> you<00:05:37.919> stop<00:05:38.130> pushing<00:05:38.460> geez

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:38.669 
and then once you stop pushing geez

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:41.180 
and then once you stop pushing geez
playing<00:05:39.240> stops<00:05:39.540> and<00:05:40.350> that's<00:05:40.590> fine<00:05:40.830> for<00:05:40.860> this

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:41.190 
playing stops and that's fine for this

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:45.290 
playing stops and that's fine for this
project<00:05:43.340> because<00:05:44.340> this<00:05:44.580> is<00:05:44.729> off<00:05:44.880> and<00:05:45.120> then

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300 
project because this is off and then

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:46.550 
project because this is off and then
what<00:05:45.600> we're<00:05:45.750> doing<00:05:45.990> here<00:05:46.200> is<00:05:46.229> we're<00:05:46.530> creating

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 
what we're doing here is we're creating

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.070 
what we're doing here is we're creating
attributes<00:05:47.550> for<00:05:47.970> the<00:05:48.060> animations<00:05:48.690> that<00:05:48.780> way

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.080 
attributes for the animations that way

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.670 
attributes for the animations that way
whenever<00:05:49.260> it<00:05:49.680> changes<00:05:50.870> direction<00:05:51.870> it'll<00:05:52.470> also

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:52.680 
whenever it changes direction it'll also

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.340 
whenever it changes direction it'll also
change<00:05:53.100> what<00:05:53.460> the<00:05:53.610> plane<00:05:53.850> looks<00:05:54.120> like<00:05:54.350> so

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:55.350 
change what the plane looks like so

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:56.510 
change what the plane looks like so
it'll<00:05:55.470> make<00:05:55.620> a<00:05:55.650> little<00:05:55.950> bit<00:05:56.039> more<00:05:56.220> realistic

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:56.520 
it'll make a little bit more realistic

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.730 
it'll make a little bit more realistic
and<00:05:56.940> as<00:05:57.390> we're<00:05:57.570> creating<00:05:57.960> these<00:05:58.050> Astro<00:05:58.500> buttes

00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:58.740 
and as we're creating these Astro buttes

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:00.950 
and as we're creating these Astro buttes
you<00:05:59.700> always<00:05:59.880> want<00:06:00.060> to<00:06:00.090> try<00:06:00.270> and<00:06:00.390> use<00:06:00.510> something

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:00.960 
you always want to try and use something

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:04.100 
you always want to try and use something
meaningful<00:06:01.410> as<00:06:02.310> far<00:06:02.970> as<00:06:03.090> the<00:06:03.240> name<00:06:03.450> goes<00:06:03.750> and

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:04.110 
meaningful as far as the name goes and

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:06.350 
meaningful as far as the name goes and
we're<00:06:04.830> just<00:06:04.919> selecting<00:06:05.490> animation<00:06:06.030> here<00:06:06.180> that

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:06.360 
we're just selecting animation here that

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.980 
we're just selecting animation here that
way<00:06:06.479> whenever<00:06:06.720> we<00:06:06.990> go<00:06:07.169> into<00:06:07.530> the<00:06:08.090> actor<00:06:09.090> and<00:06:09.330> to

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:09.990 
way whenever we go into the actor and to

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:12.529 
way whenever we go into the actor and to
the<00:06:10.080> behavior<00:06:10.470> that<00:06:10.530> we<00:06:10.710> can<00:06:11.190> configure<00:06:11.610> what

00:06:12.529 --> 00:06:12.539 
the behavior that we can configure what

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:16.690 
the behavior that we can configure what
each<00:06:12.690> one<00:06:12.930> of<00:06:12.960> these<00:06:13.050> animations<00:06:13.470> changes<00:06:14.190> to

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:16.700 

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:18.770 

that's<00:06:17.700> one<00:06:17.910> of<00:06:17.970> the<00:06:18.060> beautiful<00:06:18.360> things<00:06:18.510> about

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:18.780 
that's one of the beautiful things about

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:20.960 
that's one of the beautiful things about
stencil<00:06:19.470> because<00:06:19.830> that<00:06:19.950> it<00:06:20.070> just<00:06:20.250> makes<00:06:20.430> stuff

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:20.970 
stencil because that it just makes stuff

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:22.880 
stencil because that it just makes stuff
like<00:06:21.090> this<00:06:21.240> so<00:06:21.600> much<00:06:21.900> easier<00:06:21.960> it<00:06:22.560> makes<00:06:22.620> it

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:22.890 
like this so much easier it makes it

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:27.350 
like this so much easier it makes it
look<00:06:22.979> so<00:06:23.039> much<00:06:23.370> more<00:06:23.550> logical<00:06:25.789> all<00:06:26.789> right<00:06:27.090> and

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:27.360 
look so much more logical all right and

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.000 
look so much more logical all right and
we're<00:06:27.450> just<00:06:27.539> going<00:06:27.660> to<00:06:27.810> grab<00:06:27.930> these<00:06:28.289> these

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:29.010 
we're just going to grab these these

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:30.800 
we're just going to grab these these
switch<00:06:29.340> animations<00:06:29.970> to<00:06:30.180> and<00:06:30.510> you'll<00:06:30.630> find

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:30.810 
switch animations to and you'll find

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:33.230 
switch animations to and you'll find
that<00:06:30.960> it's<00:06:31.110> under<00:06:31.320> actor<00:06:31.890> and<00:06:32.220> draw<00:06:32.460> as<00:06:32.789> you

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:33.240 
that it's under actor and draw as you

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.780 
that it's under actor and draw as you
can<00:06:33.360> see<00:06:33.620> and<00:06:34.620> then<00:06:35.430> just

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:35.790 
can see and then just

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:40.180 
can see and then just
one<00:06:36.000> for<00:06:36.240> each<00:06:36.270> one<00:06:36.570> of<00:06:36.600> these<00:06:37.490> all<00:06:38.490> right<00:06:38.760> and

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:40.190 
one for each one of these all right and

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:43.060 
one for each one of these all right and
should<00:06:41.190> be<00:06:41.280> yeah<00:06:41.490> are<00:06:41.760> you<00:06:41.970> in<00:06:42.030> the<00:06:42.120> attributes

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:43.070 
should be yeah are you in the attributes

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:45.140 
should be yeah are you in the attributes
and<00:06:44.070> just<00:06:44.310> make<00:06:44.430> sure<00:06:44.580> you<00:06:44.670> match<00:06:44.820> these<00:06:45.090> up

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:45.150 
and just make sure you match these up

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:46.760 
and just make sure you match these up
correctly<00:06:45.690> otherwise<00:06:45.840> you'll<00:06:46.260> end<00:06:46.290> up<00:06:46.530> put

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:46.770 
correctly otherwise you'll end up put

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:51.860 
correctly otherwise you'll end up put
some<00:06:46.980> interesting<00:06:47.760> results<00:06:47.910> oh<00:06:49.850> wait<00:06:50.850> too<00:06:51.720> far

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:51.870 
some interesting results oh wait too far

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:58.580 
some interesting results oh wait too far
down<00:06:52.080> go<00:06:52.410> up<00:06:52.590> here<00:06:54.860> there<00:06:55.860> we<00:06:56.040> go<00:06:57.590> left

00:06:58.580 --> 00:06:58.590 
down go up here there we go left

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:02.810 
down go up here there we go left
animation<00:06:59.310> and<00:06:59.670> right<00:07:00.030> animation<00:07:01.280> and<00:07:02.280> save

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:02.820 
animation and right animation and save

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:07.820 
animation and right animation and save
all<00:07:03.060> these<00:07:03.240> things<00:07:03.570> I<00:07:06.170> definitely<00:07:07.170> save<00:07:07.500> a<00:07:07.530> lot

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:07.830 
all these things I definitely save a lot

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:10.190 
all these things I definitely save a lot
because<00:07:08.130> if<00:07:08.880> you<00:07:09.110> experimented<00:07:10.110> with

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:10.200 
because if you experimented with

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:13.580 
because if you experimented with
programs<00:07:10.620> before<00:07:10.860> that<00:07:11.820> crash<00:07:12.150> out<00:07:12.480> then<00:07:12.780> you

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:13.590 
programs before that crash out then you

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:14.990 
programs before that crash out then you
know<00:07:13.740> what<00:07:13.980> a<00:07:14.010> pain<00:07:14.220> it<00:07:14.250> is<00:07:14.460> to<00:07:14.520> have<00:07:14.640> to<00:07:14.760> redo

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:15.000 
know what a pain it is to have to redo

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.090 
know what a pain it is to have to redo
code<00:07:15.240> also<00:07:15.630> a<00:07:16.170> stencil<00:07:16.650> something<00:07:16.890> you<00:07:16.950> need

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:17.100 
code also a stencil something you need

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:20.360 
code also a stencil something you need
to<00:07:17.130> do<00:07:17.340> is<00:07:18.170> close<00:07:19.170> out<00:07:19.410> of<00:07:19.440> an<00:07:19.590> actor<00:07:19.920> sometimes

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:20.370 
to do is close out of an actor sometimes

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:22.160 
to do is close out of an actor sometimes
for<00:07:20.640> it<00:07:20.700> to<00:07:20.820> be<00:07:20.940> able<00:07:21.420> to<00:07:21.690> refresh<00:07:22.050> that

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:22.170 
for it to be able to refresh that

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:25.040 
for it to be able to refresh that
behavior<00:07:22.800> I<00:07:23.030> mean<00:07:24.030> stencil<00:07:24.420> doesn't<00:07:24.690> crash<00:07:24.870> in

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:25.050 
behavior I mean stencil doesn't crash in

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:26.810 
behavior I mean stencil doesn't crash in
a<00:07:25.110> lot<00:07:25.320> but<00:07:25.590> a<00:07:25.830> lot<00:07:26.010> of<00:07:26.040> other<00:07:26.250> programs<00:07:26.490> I've

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:26.820 
a lot but a lot of other programs I've

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:29.270 
a lot but a lot of other programs I've
worked<00:07:27.000> with<00:07:27.120> have<00:07:27.360> so<00:07:27.690> I'm<00:07:27.810> just<00:07:27.960> in<00:07:28.140> this<00:07:28.290> OCD

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:29.280 
worked with have so I'm just in this OCD

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:31.280 
worked with have so I'm just in this OCD
mode<00:07:29.550> of<00:07:29.790> saving<00:07:30.300> just<00:07:30.480> about<00:07:30.600> after<00:07:30.960> every

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:31.290 
mode of saving just about after every

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:34.520 
mode of saving just about after every
line<00:07:31.470> of<00:07:31.500> code<00:07:31.680> and<00:07:32.870> then<00:07:33.870> just<00:07:34.020> make<00:07:34.170> sure<00:07:34.200> for

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:34.530 
line of code and then just make sure for

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:36.020 
line of code and then just make sure for
all<00:07:34.620> these<00:07:34.740> animations<00:07:35.100> just<00:07:35.550> choose<00:07:35.790> the

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:36.030 
all these animations just choose the

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:38.270 
all these animations just choose the
correct<00:07:36.450> one<00:07:36.840> and<00:07:37.020> see<00:07:37.560> we<00:07:37.680> gave<00:07:37.950> a<00:07:37.980> memorable

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:38.280 
correct one and see we gave a memorable

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:40.130 
correct one and see we gave a memorable
name<00:07:38.700> so<00:07:38.970> we<00:07:39.060> know<00:07:39.180> exactly<00:07:39.210> which<00:07:39.780> ones<00:07:40.020> need

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:40.140 
name so we know exactly which ones need

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:44.720 
name so we know exactly which ones need
to<00:07:40.350> go<00:07:40.470> where<00:07:41.750> all<00:07:42.750> right<00:07:43.050> and<00:07:43.350> now<00:07:43.400> left<00:07:44.400> left

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:44.730 
to go where all right and now left left

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:47.090 
to go where all right and now left left
right<00:07:44.940> right<00:07:45.090> up<00:07:45.810> down<00:07:46.290> and<00:07:46.620> that's<00:07:46.860> exactly

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:47.100 
right right up down and that's exactly

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:50.000 
right right up down and that's exactly
what<00:07:47.610> we<00:07:47.700> wanted<00:07:47.940> to<00:07:48.000> do<00:07:48.260> so<00:07:49.260> okay<00:07:49.590> and<00:07:49.800> I'm

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:50.010 
what we wanted to do so okay and I'm

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:51.410 
what we wanted to do so okay and I'm
probably<00:07:50.160> going<00:07:50.400> to<00:07:50.490> be<00:07:50.550> expanding<00:07:50.970> on<00:07:51.240> this
