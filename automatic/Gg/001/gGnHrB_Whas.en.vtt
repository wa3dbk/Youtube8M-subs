 the beginnings of general brawl 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:16.320
 the two general fights 

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.950

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.950

 baby is going to stop him blake who does that 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.320

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.320
 we put it all down quickly 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:39.430
 all look at each other there is a fault 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:42.250
 seemed xing but he's looking for the ball 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:44.920
 and blake at kia who has bad gesture and 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.170
 behind those people tataki who takes it 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.650
 by the neck and the black sheep immediately 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.650
 they answer 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:57.630
 not more expensive 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.630
 I will do a lot 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.270
 is she 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.140
 kimbo 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.190
 at 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.840
 previously 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:19.330
 logical yes quite the analysis is 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.890
 just it's never obvious to them 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.390
 referees to see this situation because 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.660
 that it's going very fast his share a little bit of 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.660
 parts 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.470
 if you 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:30.329
 Why 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.820
 it is logical plexi woman obliged and 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.090
 behind passage did not take it by 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:45.990
 it makes sense that both 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.990
 players are expelled 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.609
 this ear i am i agree 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:02.710
 with this decision it's true that joe 

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:04.390
 appreciation that the blake gesture that 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.219
 touch person can be he does it his 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.960
 retained and perhaps despite the 

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:09.640
 voluntary end of not really really 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.560
 touched the player he may have everything 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.730
 last moment but lose it of course 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.299
 that behind the stake is way too much 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:18.069
 strong gesture is spectacular even 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:19.510
 if he does not touch and the game is going 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:24.989
 added should never take 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.989
 like that except for the cost and the camera 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:31.269
 the other players who come 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:34.300
 separate figures is exposed 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:38.620
 furious after who absolutely wanted to 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:41.030
 beats as if they were on the street at 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:44.530
 two o'clock in the morning between thugs 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.530
 eurosport his teammates to return
