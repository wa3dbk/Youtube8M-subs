00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:24.980 
sure so I use a hot glue gun and

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.189 
sure so I use a hot glue gun and
basically<00:00:25.980> what<00:00:26.279> I<00:00:26.310> do<00:00:26.460> is<00:00:26.910> I<00:00:27.180> just<00:00:27.689> put<00:00:28.019> my

get<00:00:41.489> down<00:00:41.700> into<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.860> grooves<00:00:44.750> I've<00:00:45.750> never<00:00:46.170> had

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
get down into the grooves I've never had

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.680 
get down into the grooves I've never had
a<00:00:46.469> problem<00:00:46.860> with<00:00:47.010> any<00:00:47.460> of<00:00:47.640> my<00:00:47.670> mice<00:00:48.090> or<00:00:48.510> my

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
a problem with any of my mice or my

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.779 
a problem with any of my mice or my
writings<00:00:49.170> either<00:00:49.350> one<00:00:51.440> trying<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.770> mess<00:00:53.550> with

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
writings either one trying to mess with

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.610 
writings either one trying to mess with
the<00:00:53.969> glue

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.170 

now<00:00:58.620> it's<00:00:58.859> cording<00:00:59.160> on<00:00:59.190> one<00:00:59.399> side<00:00:59.579> of<00:00:59.760> glue<00:00:59.910> gun

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
now it's cording on one side of glue gun

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.110 
now it's cording on one side of glue gun
you<00:01:00.210> use<00:01:00.570> to<00:01:01.469> how<00:01:02.250> many<00:01:02.309> sticks<00:01:02.760> you're<00:01:02.940> going

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
you use to how many sticks you're going

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.420 
you use to how many sticks you're going
to<00:01:03.239> use<00:01:03.420> for<00:01:03.449> this<00:01:03.780> I<00:01:04.080> like<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:04.949> do<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.129> little

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
to use for this I like to do a little

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.219 
to use for this I like to do a little
extra<00:01:05.790> here<00:01:06.090> on<00:01:06.240> top<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.689> make<00:01:06.720> it<00:01:06.869> a<00:01:07.020> little

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
extra here on top to make it a little

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.260 
extra here on top to make it a little
sturdier<00:01:10.130> so<00:01:11.130> basically<00:01:11.580> I'm<00:01:11.850> just<00:01:11.880> going

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
sturdier so basically I'm just going

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.020 
sturdier so basically I'm just going
across<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:13.320> wire<00:01:13.530> here<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.700> it<00:01:14.880> will

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
across the wire here and it will

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:21.380 
across the wire here and it will
actually<00:01:15.090> glue<00:01:15.750> itself<00:01:16.380> to<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:17.009> bin<00:01:20.150> if<00:01:21.150> you

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
actually glue itself to the bin if you

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.200 
actually glue itself to the bin if you
want<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.689> smooth<00:01:21.930> it<00:01:22.080> out<00:01:22.229> you<00:01:22.500> can<00:01:22.710> take<00:01:22.860> a

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
want to smooth it out you can take a

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.460 
want to smooth it out you can take a
popsicle<00:01:24.210> stick<00:01:24.420> or<00:01:24.570> something<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.200> smooth

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
popsicle stick or something and smooth

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:32.030 
popsicle stick or something and smooth
it<00:01:28.189> that's<00:01:29.189> that<00:01:29.990> now<00:01:30.990> I'm<00:01:31.439> going<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:31.770> show<00:01:31.979> you

going to put it to put your water bottle

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.660 
going to put it to put your water bottle
in<00:01:50.570> just<00:01:51.570> tilt<00:01:51.960> it<00:01:52.200> just<00:01:52.590> a<00:01:52.860> little<00:01:53.040> bit<00:01:53.340> so

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
in just tilt it just a little bit so

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.880 
in just tilt it just a little bit so
that<00:01:53.700> your<00:01:54.030> edges<00:01:54.509> will<00:01:54.659> get<00:01:54.840> down<00:01:55.020> into<00:01:55.619> your

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
that your edges will get down into your

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.380 
that your edges will get down into your
work<00:01:56.130> you<00:01:56.850> can<00:01:57.030> position<00:01:57.420> it<00:01:57.750> in<00:01:58.939> over<00:01:59.939> on<00:02:00.090> this

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
work you can position it in over on this

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.870 
work you can position it in over on this
side<00:02:00.590> this<00:02:01.590> side<00:02:01.890> in<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.399> middle<00:02:02.579> it<00:02:02.850> doesn't

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
side this side in the middle it doesn't

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.749 
side this side in the middle it doesn't
matter<00:02:03.479> and<00:02:03.840> then<00:02:04.560> you<00:02:04.649> can<00:02:04.860> position<00:02:05.219> it<00:02:05.549> to

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
matter and then you can position it to

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.919 
matter and then you can position it to
the<00:02:05.909> hot<00:02:06.420> that<00:02:06.899> you<00:02:07.079> need<00:02:07.520> for<00:02:08.520> your<00:02:08.580> mice<00:02:09.569> or

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
your rattie's once you get that position

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.000 
your rattie's once you get that position
the<00:02:14.050> easiest<00:02:14.500> thing<00:02:14.800> to<00:02:14.830> do<00:02:15.160> is<00:02:16.620> just<00:02:17.620> like<00:02:17.800> I'm

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
the easiest thing to do is just like I'm

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.450 
the easiest thing to do is just like I'm
fixing<00:02:18.400> to<00:02:18.430> do<00:02:18.670> right<00:02:18.970> here<00:02:19.830> it<00:02:20.830> does<00:02:21.010> not<00:02:21.220> hurt
