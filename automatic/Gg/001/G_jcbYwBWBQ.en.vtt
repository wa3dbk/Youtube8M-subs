00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:17.850
 each and every one of us 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.050
 let's dedicate ourselves not to leave the cinema 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.050
 we have a movie to tell 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.720
 it was in facts 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.210
 today we are no longer moviegoers 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.850
 movie buffs 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.940
 is in our blood the need for 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.230
 to be able to see new worlds 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.820
 even know ourselves to 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:06.380
 through this of fiction and the 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:09.400
 documentary like I drink and I film nothing 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.900
 It fills up as much as making movies 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.899
 I really consider it my job 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.940
 even if he does not earn money with him I 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:20.509
 that with I consider myself is that I perform 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:22.520
 movies making movies for free is not 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:25.759
 good for nobody, we are dedicated 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.500
 to the cinema for the love of art but we have 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:30.410
 to live on something if I do not get 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.970
 produce or produce a movie 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:34.680
 at a level 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.720
 in quotes professional because I 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.090
 I consider that what I do is professional 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.400
 I have no choice but to do it 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:45.620
 I someone tells you how I do it for 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.620
 make friends 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.369
 xala 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.759
 you have to wait for it to be produced 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.990
 wait years will flourish in the low 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.420
 budget because people are going to look 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.030
 is going to self-produce the movies of 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.439
 look for crowdfunding to do for 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.090
 steal banks to let them know 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.270
 kidnappings will have everything to be able 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.920
 produce movies here there is a manager 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.140
 explosive to take everyone 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.450
 ahead of the other leaving a shot 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.120
 and so we avoid it 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:17.269
 but it is a judgment the mitigating would be the 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.269
 power 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.890
 do not 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.930
 crowdfunding is fundamentally a 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.170
 way of financing I like 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:39.780
 call it microfinance because 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.300
 end of accounts is how it works not with 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:45.900
 small contributions from many people who 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:48.180
 a priori of bad individual are not no 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:51.090
 they are interesting as quantity but 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.640
 all added together and they acquire a value 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.709
 important that you can make it supland 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.000
 a whole game what is very 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.350
 important in crowdfunding is that the 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.170
 people identify you that I put a 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.580
 face that I see that I'm going to explain the 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.200
 project and to praise the passion that 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.820
 you transmit not also that's very 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.070
 important in the end you are going to give 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:10.650
 money many times to a stranger who 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.300
 less than seeing first hand what is it 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.370
 that they will offer you if you have a 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.500
 trailer a secure floor of the project 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.450
 put it because people are going to see how 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.980
 you will do and it'll be cool all 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.140
 the materials if you have a dossier 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.760
 cool or teach everything and that is what 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:27.890
 best possible do not save anything for the 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.890
 final because people give you 10 seconds 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:31.840
 we should do cheap I brought two already 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.310
 it 's coming out again we show them 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.140
 the cheap video you cost me like 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.410
 example to see how you can 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.640
 synthesize in just two minutes and what 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.650
 is what you're going to do how are you going to 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.180
 do and what do you want to offer what 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.240
 he knows that the days when there is no money 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:49.030
 that you are going to shoot a little budget that 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:51.910
 contains media etc. and so on 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.350
 the issue is that I want you to get that 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.760
 get involved by the script and at the time 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:58.879
 to have the finished movie 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:01.239
 the big question is now what do we do 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:04.760
 with the obligation of the creator of 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:07.209
 small productions is to consider how 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.739
 make known what you are creating 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:12.319
 must have a five-year plan or a 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:14.690
 three years seen too many times 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:17.329
 people start to roll without having very 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.070
 clear where you're going to get almost in the 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:21.760
 failure is everyday and the expert 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:24.199
 exceptional is the reality of cinema today 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.940
 but still if we do not have the plan from 

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:27.669
 then we are going to fail the big advantage 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.690
 of this type of project is that 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:31.970
 costing very little money you can 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.260
 put internet and charge little people 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:35.419
 You can see it all over the world with 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:37.430
 Internet viewing for two euros 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:38.960
 it offers you at the bit level and they are the same 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.270
 just that you do not have the physical product in 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.070
 the hand is much more affordable for 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:44.419
 reach more public an application in 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:46.550
 three four or five rooms in Spain 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:49.039
 because it can be available to us 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:51.949
 rest of the territory simultaneously is 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:54.220
 the path of truth because if I live in 

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:57.040
 Huesca 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:05:00.250
 sevilla or in palma de mallorca and maybe 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.960
 I do not have an isolated cinema a renoir a 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.520
 powerful room like the greens that do not 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.930
 I can ask you that movie has been turned on 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.250
 a crisis in the country in the world the 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.660
 vanguard and then can not see the 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:09.160
 movie in a forgotten man of the 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:10.360
 movie that is a movie if you can 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:13.570
 have a movie theater and at the same time 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:16.600
 a dvd an online viewing and that each 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:19.390
 one can choose in at the time of seeing what 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.770
 what platform do you choose to give 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:23.110
 alternatives because in the end then the 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:26.320
 film problem when and where and how 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:28.180
 it looks not good there are people younger than 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.800
 he likes more to see the movies in the 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:31.990
 computer the screen is the TV of your 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.760
 house connecting the ipad for example already 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:35.080
 others we like more to go to the cinema I think that 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.520
 the cinema is still very much alive 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.930
 the traditional exhibition is still very alive 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.120
 for a long time and many types of 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.020
 different movies the world is ours 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.820
 works very well in movie theaters 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.050
 it has also worked untouchable and 

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:45.640
 it has also worked impossible are 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:47.380
 different types of public and different 

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:49.690
 kind of movies and each one had good 

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:52.620
 result in the countries where the 

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:54.139
 digitization is already absolute 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:58.139
 they keep combining perfectly 

00:05:54.139 --> 00:06:01.229
 very large movies with movies 

00:05:58.139 --> 00:06:03.389
 let's say stockings especially for 

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:05.850
 television and with very small movies 

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:07.949
 it is very important this does not comment as 

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:10.620
 yours in a way that gives voice and 

00:06:07.949 --> 00:06:13.080
 put focus and camera on those creators 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:15.030
 that are giving in the return to the model 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.620
 traditional that is how they know that the 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:18.870
 additional industry that they do not have there 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:21.419
 fit and yes they want to keep doing 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:23.220
 but instead of ceasing to exist 

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:25.289
 they are still struggling to create new 

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:26.729
 new titles products 

00:06:25.289 --> 00:06:30.589
 and those same products in new 

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:30.589
 titles now is the new audience 

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:54.030
 free 

00:06:56.009 --> 00:06:58.999
 yes
