00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.940 

so<00:00:06.360> here's<00:00:06.509> my<00:00:06.630> triple<00:00:06.960> o<00:00:07.020> we<00:00:07.440> talked<00:00:07.650> about<00:00:07.770> it

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
so here's my triple o we talked about it

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.670 
so here's my triple o we talked about it
downstairs<00:00:08.340> we<00:00:09.270> tap<00:00:09.540> the<00:00:09.840> top<00:00:10.170> that's<00:00:10.469> the

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:10.680 
downstairs we tap the top that's the

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.400 
downstairs we tap the top that's the
mate<00:00:10.920> to<00:00:10.950> this<00:00:11.340> it's<00:00:12.209> a<00:00:12.360> let's<00:00:12.570> top<00:00:12.840> and<00:00:13.200> it's

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
mate to this it's a let's top and it's

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.010 
mate to this it's a let's top and it's
relatively<00:00:13.949> soft<00:00:14.129> I'm<00:00:14.369> not<00:00:14.490> super<00:00:14.820> stove<00:00:15.059> the

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
relatively soft I'm not super stove the

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.689 
relatively soft I'm not super stove the
top<00:00:16.230> of<00:00:16.379> this<00:00:16.470> one<00:00:16.650> is<00:00:16.770> braced<00:00:17.039> with<00:00:17.340> that<00:00:17.460> on

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
top of this one is braced with that on

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.310 
top of this one is braced with that on
deck<00:00:17.910> which<00:00:18.210> as<00:00:18.360> I<00:00:18.510> mentioned<00:00:18.960> it's<00:00:19.110> quite

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
deck which as I mentioned it's quite

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.820 
deck which as I mentioned it's quite
soft<00:00:20.780> I'll<00:00:21.780> just<00:00:21.960> give<00:00:22.140> you<00:00:22.200> a<00:00:22.290> sense<00:00:22.530> of<00:00:22.710> the

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
soft I'll just give you a sense of the

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:47.310 
soft I'll just give you a sense of the
sound<00:00:23.280> of<00:00:23.520> the<00:00:23.580> different<00:00:23.910> registers

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:47.320 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.509 

unless<00:00:48.320> you<00:00:48.469> can<00:00:48.620> hear<00:00:48.769> it<00:00:48.859> has<00:00:48.920> decent<00:00:49.190> amount

00:00:49.509 --> 00:00:49.519 
unless you can hear it has decent amount

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:51.719 
unless you can hear it has decent amount
of<00:00:49.550> sustain<00:00:49.909> not<00:00:50.149> tremendous<00:00:50.719> amount<00:00:51.049> but

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:51.729 
of sustain not tremendous amount but

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:54.160 
of sustain not tremendous amount but
substantial<00:00:52.729> enough<00:00:52.969> but<00:00:53.329> the<00:00:53.420> solidity<00:00:53.869> that

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
substantial enough but the solidity that

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.229 
substantial enough but the solidity that
the<00:00:54.500> tone<00:00:54.769> quality<00:00:54.949> is<00:00:55.369> would<00:00:55.640> eNOS<00:00:55.879> I<00:00:56.059> talk

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
the tone quality is would eNOS I talk

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:01.810 
the tone quality is would eNOS I talk
about<00:00:59.140> it's<00:01:00.140> that<00:01:00.350> lack<00:01:00.680> of<00:01:00.949> extra<00:01:01.519> Christmas

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
about it's that lack of extra Christmas

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.359 
about it's that lack of extra Christmas
that<00:01:02.359> most<00:01:02.570> modern<00:01:02.750> guitars<00:01:03.260> you<00:01:03.409> know<00:01:03.530> it's

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
that most modern guitars you know it's

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:09.609 
that most modern guitars you know it's
missing<00:01:07.810> so<00:01:08.810> this<00:01:08.929> is<00:01:09.050> sort<00:01:09.259> of<00:01:09.289> a<00:01:09.380> cross

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 
missing so this is sort of a cross

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:11.710 
missing so this is sort of a cross
between<00:01:09.679> a<00:01:10.039> vintage<00:01:10.460> sound<00:01:10.700> which<00:01:10.970> also<00:01:11.330> play

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
between a vintage sound which also play

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.930 
between a vintage sound which also play
later<00:01:11.960> on<00:01:12.050> and<00:01:12.649> the<00:01:13.130> modern<00:01:13.399> guitar

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:13.940 
later on and the modern guitar

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:32.499 
later on and the modern guitar
it's<00:01:14.539> the<00:01:14.690> hybrid<00:01:29.350> by<00:01:30.350> contrast<00:01:31.000> this<00:01:32.000> is<00:01:32.270> an

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 
it's the hybrid by contrast this is an

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:35.620 
it's the hybrid by contrast this is an
identical<00:01:32.929> let<00:01:33.560> stop<00:01:33.880> but<00:01:34.880> it<00:01:34.970> has<00:01:35.090> the<00:01:35.240> center

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
identical let stop but it has the center

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.539 
identical let stop but it has the center
braces<00:01:36.020> and<00:01:36.259> these<00:01:36.380> city<00:01:36.590> braces<00:01:37.039> are<00:01:37.190> pretty

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:37.549 
braces and these city braces are pretty

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:39.580 
braces and these city braces are pretty
stiff<00:01:37.819> so<00:01:38.689> you<00:01:38.810> should<00:01:39.020> be<00:01:39.170> able<00:01:39.259> to<00:01:39.380> hear<00:01:39.560> a

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
stiff so you should be able to hear a

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.099 
stiff so you should be able to hear a
difference<00:01:39.649> in<00:01:40.100> the<00:01:40.189> tonality<00:01:40.430> here<00:01:41.109> again

00:01:42.099 --> 00:01:42.109 
difference in the tonality here again

00:01:42.109 --> 00:02:13.680 
difference in the tonality here again
the<00:01:42.409> low<00:01:42.530> mid<00:01:42.770> sized

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.600 

again<00:02:14.690> at<00:02:14.840> least<00:02:14.930> not<00:02:15.050> a<00:02:15.290> sustained<00:02:15.710> I<00:02:16.010> try<00:02:16.430> not

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
again at least not a sustained I try not

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.060 
again at least not a sustained I try not
to<00:02:16.670> get<00:02:17.060> too<00:02:17.120> much<00:02:17.420> of<00:02:17.600> my<00:02:17.720> guitars<00:02:18.200> it's<00:02:18.920> just

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
to get too much of my guitars it's just

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.550 
to get too much of my guitars it's just
a<00:02:19.160> choice<00:02:19.820> I<00:02:20.060> know<00:02:20.300> but<00:02:21.140> in<00:02:21.200> terms<00:02:21.410> of<00:02:21.470> the

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
a choice I know but in terms of the

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.320 
a choice I know but in terms of the
voicing<00:02:21.950> I<00:02:22.040> can<00:02:22.190> hear<00:02:22.340> them<00:02:22.490> I<00:02:22.820> think<00:02:22.880> they<00:02:23.150> can

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
voicing I can hear them I think they can

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.180 
voicing I can hear them I think they can
hear<00:02:23.480> the<00:02:23.600> extra<00:02:23.900> articulation<00:02:24.170> that<00:02:24.800> extra

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
hear the extra articulation that extra

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:31.830 
hear the extra articulation that extra
edge<00:02:25.670> the<00:02:25.940> greatness<00:02:26.210> the<00:02:26.600> time

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.270 

and<00:02:32.840> that's<00:02:33.080> the<00:02:33.200> difference<00:02:33.380> internally<00:02:34.160> the

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
and that's the difference internally the

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.940 
and that's the difference internally the
difference<00:02:34.640> of<00:02:35.030> the<00:02:35.180> bracing<00:02:35.600> same<00:02:36.350> tops<00:02:36.620> and

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
difference of the bracing same tops and

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.490 
difference of the bracing same tops and
the<00:02:37.670> back<00:02:38.120> and<00:02:38.300> sides<00:02:38.540> are<00:02:38.690> both<00:02:38.900> Brazilian

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
the back and sides are both Brazilian

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.470 
the back and sides are both Brazilian
and<00:02:39.710> they<00:02:40.310> came<00:02:40.490> out<00:02:40.640> literally<00:02:41.060> the<00:02:41.240> same

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
and they came out literally the same

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.080 
and they came out literally the same
tree<00:02:41.750> so<00:02:42.200> they're<00:02:43.100> more<00:02:43.250> similarities<00:02:43.910> and

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
tree so they're more similarities and

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:51.020 
tree so they're more similarities and
differences

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.940 

now<00:02:52.030> here's<00:02:52.270> the<00:02:52.390> difference<00:02:52.750> between<00:02:52.959> the

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
now here's the difference between the

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.640 
now here's the difference between the
Rosewood<00:02:54.370> sound<00:02:54.730> and<00:02:55.090> a<00:02:55.629> maple<00:02:55.900> back<00:02:56.260> inside

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
Rosewood sound and a maple back inside

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.759 
Rosewood sound and a maple back inside
again<00:02:57.160> same<00:02:58.000> top<00:02:58.269> same<00:02:58.959> set<00:02:59.230> for<00:02:59.379> bracing

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
again same top same set for bracing

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:01.800 
again same top same set for bracing
they're<00:03:00.700> both<00:03:00.879> exactly<00:03:01.180> the<00:03:01.450> same<00:03:01.629> model

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
they're both exactly the same model

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.559 
they're both exactly the same model
they're<00:03:02.080> both<00:03:02.200> double<00:03:02.560> O<00:03:02.650> 12<00:03:02.980> frets<00:03:03.420> let's<00:03:04.420> see

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
they're both double O 12 frets let's see

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:17.890 
they're both double O 12 frets let's see
we<00:03:04.750> hear<00:03:04.959> a<00:03:04.989> difference

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:31.179 

a<00:03:29.019> little<00:03:30.019> bit<00:03:30.110> less<00:03:30.290> sustained<00:03:30.709> what<00:03:31.069> you'd

00:03:31.179 --> 00:03:31.189 
a little bit less sustained what you'd

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:33.729 
a little bit less sustained what you'd
expect<00:03:31.480> and<00:03:32.480> I<00:03:32.599> hear<00:03:32.810> more<00:03:33.019> warmth<00:03:33.379> they<00:03:33.530> heard

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
expect and I hear more warmth they heard

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:36.550 
expect and I hear more warmth they heard
a<00:03:33.939> softness<00:03:34.939> to<00:03:35.120> the<00:03:35.390> notes<00:03:35.629> and<00:03:36.260> the<00:03:36.379> maple

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
a softness to the notes and the maple

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.640 
a softness to the notes and the maple
versus<00:03:37.129> the<00:03:37.310> Rose<00:03:37.489> was<00:03:38.349> especially<00:03:39.349> obvious

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
versus the Rose was especially obvious

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.500 
versus the Rose was especially obvious
and<00:03:42.650> that's<00:03:43.519> characteristic<00:03:43.970> of<00:03:44.269> a<00:03:44.359> maple

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
and that's characteristic of a maple

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:55.930 
and that's characteristic of a maple
Center<00:03:44.930> I<00:03:52.000> know<00:03:53.000> the<00:03:53.599> coup<00:03:53.780> de<00:03:53.870> Gras<00:03:54.760> this<00:03:55.760> is<00:03:55.909> a

Center I know the coup de Gras this is a

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:49.360 

pretty<00:04:47.539> good<00:04:47.720> sustainable<00:04:47.900> return<00:04:48.710> but<00:04:49.340> you

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
pretty good sustainable return but you

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:50.649

the voice they achieved and a lot of it
is<00:05:25.550> a<00:05:25.580> function<00:05:25.729> of<00:05:26.090> the<00:05:26.330> combination<00:05:26.780> of

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:26.810 
is a function of the combination of

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:28.960 
is a function of the combination of
materials<00:05:27.289> and<00:05:27.530> the<00:05:27.830> bracelet<00:05:28.220> there's

nothing really special about the guitar
it's<00:05:30.710> very<00:05:30.889> likely<00:05:31.100> bill<00:05:31.930> but<00:05:32.930> the<00:05:33.050> materials

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:33.500 
it's very likely bill but the materials

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.520 
it's very likely bill but the materials
impart<00:05:33.919> their<00:05:34.220> voice
