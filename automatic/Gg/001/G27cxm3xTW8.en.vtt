00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:03.199 
guitar for this it's not necessarily any

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:05.020

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.790 
this makes the the closest sound to a
ukulele<00:01:07.580> so<00:01:08.540> this<00:01:08.990> is<00:01:09.110> how<00:01:09.259> you<00:01:09.320> can<00:01:09.530> make<00:01:09.649> your

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
shapes or a G as you would for a

shapes or a G as you would for a
standard<00:01:40.670> ukulele<00:01:41.200> so<00:01:42.200> it's<00:01:42.319> a<00:01:42.380> really<00:01:42.590> nice

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
standard ukulele so it's a really nice

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.550 
standard ukulele so it's a really nice
tip<00:01:43.009> and<00:01:43.220> something<00:01:43.490> that<00:01:43.580> I<00:01:43.640> use<00:01:43.850> often<00:01:44.560> but

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
tip and something that I use often but

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.109 
tip and something that I use often but
the<00:01:45.860> only<00:01:45.979> difference<00:01:46.159> in<00:01:46.520> this<00:01:46.670> song<00:01:46.940> is

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
the only difference in this song is

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:49.660 
the only difference in this song is
because<00:01:47.319> Drake's<00:01:48.319> ukulele<00:01:49.039> was<00:01:49.220> tuned<00:01:49.550> a

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
because Drake's ukulele was tuned a

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.910 
because Drake's ukulele was tuned a
whole<00:01:49.850> step<00:01:50.210> up<00:01:50.479> that<00:01:51.229> means<00:01:51.440> that<00:01:51.560> you<00:01:51.649> don't

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
whole step up that means that you don't

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.169 
whole step up that means that you don't
want<00:01:52.069> the<00:01:52.159> capo<00:01:52.429> on<00:01:52.490> the<00:01:52.550> fifth<00:01:52.819> fret<00:01:52.940> you

00:01:53.169 --> 00:01:53.179 
want the capo on the fifth fret you

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:55.029 
want the capo on the fifth fret you
actually<00:01:53.509> want<00:01:53.659> it<00:01:53.810> on<00:01:53.899> the<00:01:53.990> seventh<00:01:54.319> fret<00:01:54.530> so

00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:55.039 
actually want it on the seventh fret so

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:56.649 
actually want it on the seventh fret so
that<00:01:55.130> was<00:01:55.250> just<00:01:55.340> a<00:01:55.549> nice<00:01:56.000> little<00:01:56.180> tip<00:01:56.390> for<00:01:56.600> you

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
you'll need to change the actual chords

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.979 
you'll need to change the actual chords
themselves<00:02:18.760> to<00:02:18.970> fit<00:02:19.180> in<00:02:19.270> the<00:02:19.360> right<00:02:19.510> key<00:02:19.750> so

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
need to play is an F a D minor g7 and

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.710 
need to play is an F a D minor g7 and
the<00:02:28.060> C<00:02:29.550> okay<00:02:30.580> so<00:02:31.000> I'll<00:02:31.060> show<00:02:31.270> you<00:02:31.330> all<00:02:31.600> the

the C okay so I'll show you all the

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.600 
the C okay so I'll show you all the
fingerings<00:02:31.989> for<00:02:32.290> those<00:02:32.410> codes<00:02:32.709> so<00:02:33.280> the<00:02:33.400> first

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
fingerings for those codes so the first

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.180 
fingerings for those codes so the first
one<00:02:33.790> which<00:02:33.910> is<00:02:33.940> F<00:02:34.350> all<00:02:35.350> the<00:02:35.560> doing<00:02:35.860> is<00:02:35.980> placing

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
one which is F all the doing is placing

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.250 
one which is F all the doing is placing
the<00:02:36.519> middle<00:02:36.760> finger<00:02:37.060> onto<00:02:37.420> the<00:02:37.540> second<00:02:38.019> fret

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
the middle finger onto the second fret

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.040 
the middle finger onto the second fret
fourth<00:02:38.739> string<00:02:38.860> and<00:02:39.280> the<00:02:39.760> index<00:02:40.030> finger<00:02:40.150> onto

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
fourth string and the index finger onto

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.530 
fourth string and the index finger onto
the<00:02:41.140> first<00:02:41.470> fret<00:02:41.890> second<00:02:42.459> string<00:02:42.489> so<00:02:43.330> it's<00:02:43.420> the

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
the first fret second string so it's the

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:44.910 
the first fret second string so it's the
only<00:02:43.690> those<00:02:43.900> two<00:02:44.110> fingers<00:02:44.350> and<00:02:44.560> you<00:02:44.620> play<00:02:44.860> in

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
only those two fingers and you play in

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.310 
only those two fingers and you play in
the<00:02:45.040> highest<00:02:45.370> four<00:02:45.550> strings<00:02:45.959> that's<00:02:46.959> an<00:02:47.110> F

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
the highest four strings that's an F

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.949 
the highest four strings that's an F
since<00:02:47.890> the<00:02:47.980> first<00:02:48.220> one<00:02:48.430> the<00:02:49.150> second<00:02:49.540> one<00:02:49.570> being

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
since the first one the second one being

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.949 
since the first one the second one being
a<00:02:50.230> D<00:02:50.500> minor<00:02:51.180> and<00:02:52.180> this<00:02:52.300> is<00:02:52.420> really<00:02:52.690> easy<00:02:52.840> to

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
a D minor and this is really easy to

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:54.930 
a D minor and this is really easy to
switch<00:02:53.200> to<00:02:53.530> because<00:02:53.800> you're<00:02:53.920> only<00:02:54.070> adding<00:02:54.370> the

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
switch to because you're only adding the

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.650 
switch to because you're only adding the
ring<00:02:55.150> finger<00:02:55.540> from<00:02:56.050> F<00:02:56.410> on<00:02:57.010> to<00:02:57.550> the<00:02:57.910> second<00:02:58.420> fret

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
ring finger from F on to the second fret

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.320 
ring finger from F on to the second fret
third<00:02:58.690> string<00:02:59.019> and<00:02:59.620> that's<00:03:00.190> it<00:03:00.370> so<00:03:00.760> that<00:03:00.910> is<00:03:01.060> a

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
third string and that's it so that is a

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.880 
third string and that's it so that is a
D<00:03:01.660> minor<00:03:03.090> the<00:03:04.090> next<00:03:04.450> chord<00:03:04.690> F<00:03:04.959> third<00:03:05.470> chord<00:03:05.739> is

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
D minor the next chord F third chord is

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.420 
D minor the next chord F third chord is
a<00:03:05.920> g7<00:03:06.750> and<00:03:07.750> this<00:03:08.170> is<00:03:08.320> also<00:03:08.709> fairly<00:03:09.010> easy<00:03:09.220> to

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
a g7 and this is also fairly easy to

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.490 
a g7 and this is also fairly easy to
switch<00:03:09.670> to<00:03:09.880> what<00:03:10.480> you<00:03:10.570> can<00:03:10.720> do<00:03:10.840> is<00:03:11.019> from<00:03:11.170> the<00:03:11.350> D

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
switch to what you can do is from the D

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.039 
switch to what you can do is from the D
minor<00:03:12.120> release<00:03:13.120> the<00:03:13.360> middle<00:03:13.630> finger<00:03:13.900> and<00:03:13.989> ring

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049 
minor release the middle finger and ring

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:16.550 
minor release the middle finger and ring
finger<00:03:14.220> keep<00:03:15.220> the<00:03:15.400> index<00:03:15.670> finger<00:03:16.060> where<00:03:16.239> it<00:03:16.360> is

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
finger keep the index finger where it is

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.080 
finger keep the index finger where it is
place<00:03:17.560> the<00:03:17.769> ring<00:03:17.920> finger<00:03:18.250> down<00:03:18.430> onto<00:03:18.970> the

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
place the ring finger down onto the

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.979 
place the ring finger down onto the
first<00:03:19.590> string<00:03:20.590> of<00:03:20.709> the<00:03:20.829> second<00:03:21.250> fret<00:03:21.489> and<00:03:21.989> the

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
first string of the second fret and the

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:25.229 
first string of the second fret and the
middle<00:03:23.290> finger<00:03:23.320> onto<00:03:23.829> the<00:03:24.340> third<00:03:24.610> string<00:03:25.030> of

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 
middle finger onto the third string of

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:30.120 
middle finger onto the third string of
the<00:03:25.360> second<00:03:25.750> fret<00:03:25.959> and<00:03:26.260> that<00:03:26.860> makes<00:03:27.160> a<00:03:27.459> g7<00:03:29.130> now

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
the second fret and that makes a g7 now

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.550 
the second fret and that makes a g7 now
if<00:03:30.280> the<00:03:30.400> final<00:03:30.730> and<00:03:31.090> fourth<00:03:31.329> chord<00:03:31.690> this<00:03:32.410> is

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
if the final and fourth chord this is

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.330 
if the final and fourth chord this is
the<00:03:32.709> easiest<00:03:33.100> of<00:03:33.310> them<00:03:33.489> all<00:03:33.640> this<00:03:34.120> is<00:03:34.180> a<00:03:34.329> C<00:03:34.660> and

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
the easiest of them all this is a C and

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.890 
the easiest of them all this is a C and
only<00:03:36.340> having<00:03:36.610> to<00:03:36.730> do<00:03:36.850> is<00:03:37.000> place<00:03:37.209> one<00:03:37.510> finger

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
only having to do is place one finger

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.949 
only having to do is place one finger
down<00:03:38.079> onto<00:03:38.890> the<00:03:39.010> third<00:03:39.820> fret<00:03:40.120> first<00:03:40.660> string

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
down onto the third fret first string

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.789 
down onto the third fret first string
and<00:03:41.910> as<00:03:42.910> I<00:03:42.940> see<00:03:43.239> those<00:03:43.900> are<00:03:44.079> all<00:03:44.200> the<00:03:44.320> chords<00:03:44.709> so

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799 
and as I see those are all the chords so

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:49.290 
and as I see those are all the chords so
again<00:03:45.100> its<00:03:45.370> F<00:03:46.560> D<00:03:47.560> minor

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:49.300 
again its F D minor

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:54.810 
again its F D minor
g7<00:03:50.790> and<00:03:51.790> C<00:03:52.560> so<00:03:53.560> it's<00:03:53.710> a<00:03:53.770> really<00:03:54.010> simple<00:03:54.190> song

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:54.820 
g7 and C so it's a really simple song

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.680 
g7 and C so it's a really simple song
now<00:03:55.810> what<00:03:56.320> I'll<00:03:56.410> do<00:03:56.560> is<00:03:56.710> I'll<00:03:56.920> edit<00:03:57.690> Drake's

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
now what I'll do is I'll edit Drake's

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.570 
now what I'll do is I'll edit Drake's
performance<00:03:59.260> and<00:03:59.440> I'll<00:03:59.530> add<00:03:59.680> the<00:04:00.100> fingerings

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:00.580 
performance and I'll add the fingerings

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:02.850 
performance and I'll add the fingerings
from<00:04:00.940> these<00:04:01.180> onto<00:04:01.990> theirs<00:04:02.170> he's<00:04:02.410> playing<00:04:02.680> it

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:02.860 
from these onto theirs he's playing it
