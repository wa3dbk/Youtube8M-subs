00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
you how I went from this physique to

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.290 
you how I went from this physique to
this<00:00:39.540> physique<00:00:39.930> in<00:00:40.200> less<00:00:41.129> than<00:00:41.579> five<00:00:42.030> hours

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
this physique in less than five hours

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.540 
this physique in less than five hours
now<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.260> first<00:00:43.530> step<00:00:43.680> in<00:00:43.950> this<00:00:44.040> video<00:00:44.309> is<00:00:44.520> to

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
now the first step in this video is to

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.729 
now the first step in this video is to
reverse<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.149> process<00:00:45.329> that's<00:00:46.079> right<00:00:46.350> we're

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
reverse the process that's right we're

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.319 
reverse the process that's right we're
going<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:46.950> do<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.219> after<00:00:47.670> picture<00:00:48.059> first

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
going to do the after picture first

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.810 
going to do the after picture first
ended<00:00:48.780> before<00:00:48.930> picture<00:00:49.469> after<00:00:50.010> so<00:00:50.460> here<00:00:50.670> we<00:00:50.789> go

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
ended before picture after so here we go

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.729 
ended before picture after so here we go
first<00:00:51.570> thing<00:00:51.660> that<00:00:51.870> we<00:00:51.960> have<00:00:52.079> to<00:00:52.199> do<00:00:52.350> is<00:00:52.530> go<00:00:52.680> to

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
first thing that we have to do is go to
