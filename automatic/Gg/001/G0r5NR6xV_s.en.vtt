00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.680 
make really high quality stuff this is a
good<00:00:58.379> alternative<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:59.610> the<00:00:59.910> backhoe

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
good alternative to the backhoe

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.790 
good alternative to the backhoe
Laplander<00:01:01.559> I<00:01:02.899> haven't<00:01:03.899> used<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.290> Laplander

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:04.800 
Laplander I haven't used a Laplander

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.200 
Laplander I haven't used a Laplander
myself<00:01:05.220> so<00:01:05.489> I<00:01:05.519> can't<00:01:06.000> compare<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.899> two

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
myself so I can't compare the two

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.180 
myself so I can't compare the two
against<00:01:09.210> each<00:01:09.299> other<00:01:09.479> but<00:01:09.960> from<00:01:10.140> what<00:01:10.350> I<00:01:10.830> have

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.190 
against each other but from what I have

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:16.149 
against each other but from what I have
heard<00:01:11.600> the<00:01:12.600> Fiskars<00:01:13.049> is<00:01:13.909> not<00:01:14.909> as<00:01:15.119> good<00:01:15.330> as<00:01:15.540> the

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 
heard the Fiskars is not as good as the

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:20.029 
heard the Fiskars is not as good as the
Laplander<00:01:17.159> but<00:01:17.460> it's<00:01:17.759> a<00:01:18.060> lot<00:01:18.180> cheaper<00:01:18.210> so<00:01:19.039> for

00:01:20.029 --> 00:01:20.039 
Laplander but it's a lot cheaper so for

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:25.040 
Laplander but it's a lot cheaper so for
those<00:01:20.610> of<00:01:20.670> you<00:01:20.850> who<00:01:21.179> don't<00:01:21.560> for<00:01:24.050> the

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:25.050 
those of you who don't for the

those of you who don't for the
left-hander<00:01:25.590> this<00:01:26.009> is<00:01:26.159> a<00:01:26.190> good<00:01:26.460> alternative

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:26.940 
left-hander this is a good alternative

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.350 
left-hander this is a good alternative
for<00:01:27.630> you<00:01:27.800> the<00:01:28.800> saw<00:01:29.009> is<00:01:29.220> really<00:01:29.580> compact<00:01:29.909> and

for you the saw is really compact and
it's<00:01:30.479> also<00:01:30.800> really<00:01:31.800> lightweight<00:01:33.860> so<00:01:34.860> it<00:01:34.979> fits

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
it's also really lightweight so it fits

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.620 
it's also really lightweight so it fits
in<00:01:35.610> your<00:01:35.940> pack

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:47.690 
lot of stuff with you one of the
features<00:01:45.330> I<00:01:45.869> really<00:01:46.200> like<00:01:46.380> about<00:01:46.409> this<00:01:46.920> is

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
features I really like about this is

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.389 
features I really like about this is
when<00:01:47.909> you<00:01:48.090> close<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.140> blade<00:01:49.350> there's<00:01:50.310> a

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
when you close the blade there's a

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.300 
when you close the blade there's a
carabiner<00:01:50.939> on<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.360> bottom<00:01:51.689> so<00:01:52.680> when<00:01:52.950> you<00:01:53.100> are

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
carabiner on the bottom so when you are

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.910 
carabiner on the bottom so when you are
when<00:01:53.790> you<00:01:54.060> are<00:01:54.090> out<00:01:54.360> in<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.990> woods<00:01:55.229> we<00:01:55.740> can

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
when you are out in the woods we can

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.550 
when you are out in the woods we can
simply<00:01:56.369> clip<00:01:57.240> it<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.540> you<00:01:57.630> but<00:01:58.079> through<00:01:58.380> your

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
simply clip it to you but through your

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.109 
simply clip it to you but through your
belt<00:01:58.829> loop<00:02:00.770> when<00:02:01.770> you<00:02:01.890> need<00:02:02.070> it<00:02:02.219> you<00:02:02.520> just

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
belt loop when you need it you just

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.760 
belt loop when you need it you just
unhook<00:02:03.299> it<00:02:03.950> open<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.039> blade<00:02:05.219> you<00:02:06.030> can<00:02:06.149> cut<00:02:06.770> so

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
unhook it open the blade you can cut so

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.740 
unhook it open the blade you can cut so
that's<00:02:07.979> a<00:02:08.100> really<00:02:08.280> nice<00:02:08.519> feature<00:02:08.579> but<00:02:09.269> I<00:02:09.299> don't

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
that's a really nice feature but I don't

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.870 
that's a really nice feature but I don't
think<00:02:10.110> that<00:02:10.440> Lapland<00:02:11.370> has<00:02:13.220> the<00:02:14.220> grip<00:02:14.459> on<00:02:14.760> the

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
think that Lapland has the grip on the

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.349 
think that Lapland has the grip on the
sole<00:02:15.090> is<00:02:15.690> rubberized<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:17.160> orange<00:02:17.850> part<00:02:18.120> you

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:18.359 
sole is rubberized the orange part you

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:21.650 
sole is rubberized the orange part you
can<00:02:18.510> see<00:02:18.690> is<00:02:18.930> a<00:02:19.370> rubberized<00:02:20.370> texture<00:02:20.880> which

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
can see is a rubberized texture which

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.740 
can see is a rubberized texture which
gives<00:02:22.019> it<00:02:22.260> a<00:02:22.530> really<00:02:23.070> good<00:02:23.340> grip<00:02:23.579> the<00:02:24.299> handle

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
gives it a really good grip the handle

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.430 
gives it a really good grip the handle
also<00:02:24.989> flares<00:02:25.650> out<00:02:25.890> on<00:02:26.130> the<00:02:26.250> bottom<00:02:26.579> like<00:02:27.440> seen

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
also flares out on the bottom like seen

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.340 
also flares out on the bottom like seen
on<00:02:28.620> a<00:02:28.650> hatchet<00:02:29.190> or<00:02:29.220> an<00:02:29.489> axe<00:02:29.780> this<00:02:30.780> makes<00:02:31.079> a

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
on a hatchet or an axe this makes a

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.449 
on a hatchet or an axe this makes a
really<00:02:31.709> good<00:02:31.950> grip<00:02:32.190> and<00:02:32.519> you<00:02:33.299> won't<00:02:33.510> slip<00:02:33.750> out

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
really good grip and you won't slip out

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.539 
really good grip and you won't slip out
you<00:02:35.459> can<00:02:35.640> also<00:02:35.810> show<00:02:36.810> Cup<00:02:37.049> on<00:02:37.260> the<00:02:37.470> so<00:02:38.220> if<00:02:38.400> you

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
like to get more precise cuts if you're

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.500 
like to get more precise cuts if you're
grooving<00:02:43.290> a<00:02:43.440> stick

00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:40.849 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:46.009 

so<00:03:41.849> as<00:03:42.450> you<00:03:42.629> can<00:03:42.780> see<00:03:43.609> the<00:03:44.609> store<00:03:45.150> did<00:03:45.450> really

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
so as you can see the store did really

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:55.729 
so as you can see the store did really
well<00:03:47.120> really<00:03:48.120> clean<00:03:48.720> cuts<00:03:54.079> it<00:03:55.079> didn't<00:03:55.470> take

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
well really clean cuts it didn't take

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:00.009 
well really clean cuts it didn't take
long<00:03:56.159> at<00:03:56.549> all<00:03:56.819> for<00:03:57.709> this<00:03:58.709> war<00:03:58.979> to<00:03:59.010> get<00:03:59.639> through

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:00.019 
long at all for this war to get through

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:04.339 
long at all for this war to get through
now<00:04:01.019> this<00:04:01.260> is<00:04:01.560> as<00:04:01.859> you<00:04:02.010> can<00:04:02.069> see<00:04:02.930> quite<00:04:03.930> thin

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:04.349 
now this is as you can see quite thin

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:09.199 
now this is as you can see quite thin
pieces<00:04:04.859> I<00:04:05.659> guess<00:04:06.659> you<00:04:06.870> can<00:04:07.139> cut<00:04:08.129> down<00:04:08.370> a<00:04:08.729> bit

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
pieces I guess you can cut down a bit

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:14.110 
pieces I guess you can cut down a bit
bigger<00:04:09.479> trees<00:04:09.840> if<00:04:10.349> you<00:04:10.799> would<00:04:10.949> like<00:04:11.299> but<00:04:12.299> for

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
bigger trees if you would like but for

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.930 
bigger trees if you would like but for
what<00:04:15.120> I'm<00:04:15.359> intended<00:04:16.109> to<00:04:16.199> do<00:04:16.349> with<00:04:16.530> the<00:04:16.650> sole

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
what I'm intended to do with the sole

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.960 
what I'm intended to do with the sole
just<00:04:17.940> for<00:04:18.180> firewood<00:04:19.010> this<00:04:20.010> is<00:04:20.070> perfect<00:04:20.669> for<00:04:20.820> me

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
just for firewood this is perfect for me

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.330 
just for firewood this is perfect for me
and<00:04:22.099> I<00:04:23.099> think<00:04:23.159> it<00:04:23.820> takes<00:04:24.060> a<00:04:24.360> lot<00:04:24.570> less<00:04:24.780> effort

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
and I think it takes a lot less effort

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:30.140 
and I think it takes a lot less effort
to<00:04:26.340> use<00:04:26.520> a<00:04:26.550> saw<00:04:26.849> like<00:04:27.090> this<00:04:27.360> than<00:04:27.800> to<00:04:28.800> use<00:04:29.150> an

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930
