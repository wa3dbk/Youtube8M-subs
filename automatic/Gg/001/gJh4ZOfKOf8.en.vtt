00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.359
 we are going to need these ingredients 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:10.350
 four cups of played where the 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:13.590
 Beet a cup of red wine an envelope 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:16.560
 of raspberry jelly three sachets of 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.080
 grenetine of 21 grams hydrated in 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.410
 half a cup of water and melted in a bath 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.610
 Maria 2 of cooked and striped cables 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.640
 finely 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:29.530
 this recipe is very easy to make sounds 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.480
 rare because we are talking about a 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:35.830
 vegetable as that is irrelevant and in 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:38.230
 reality is an extremely sweet vegetable 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:40.570
 maybe raw is not so sweet for the 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.880
 moment of cooking the beet leaves all 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.880
 that sugar that is a delight and in 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:48.160
 gelatin is about to suck your fingers is 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.680
 very easy to do let's use the 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.960
 beet juice where you saw to see the 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.930
 We are going to recover it and we are going 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.940
 to put 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.940
 here to boil and be pan 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.920
 here we are going to start mixing and 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:07.690
 grenetina so that it begins to take shape 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.690
 with a small spoon 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.800
 sometimes this needs a little bit of 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:17.450
 heat that's why I heated my pan here 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:20.700
 It is usually done in a water bath but 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:23.659
 It is to not waste water 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.950
 Now that is our hot week 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:28.380
 let's take advantage and nothing else is something of 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.710
 heat a little pan and that same 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.370
 heat will melt the grenetina and ready 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.760
 okay 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:40.710
 let's put the beet juice together 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.710
 let's put the red wine 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.450
 that does not scare does not have to be of 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.370
 great brand and really sell in some 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.270
 of tetra pak that for the kitchen are 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:53.280
 quite low we are also going to add 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.550
 well let's hope you take a first 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.920
 boil 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:00.430
 first of all the beet is a 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:03.340
 food as you can see its rich color 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:05.500
 rich in beta-carotene what it does 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.690
 the beetle is to eliminate these radicals 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.000
 free of such has already hurt them 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.910
 head and free radicals but is that 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.330
 basically yes to free radicals in the 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:19.060
 body has the body the freedom of 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.890
 get sick and as we 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.510
 let's eliminate these free radicals from 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.700
 body we have more chances of 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.200
 be healthy maybe that's very 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.080
 intense is not saying radicals 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.390
 free and toxins and think that but 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.780
 It is also important to know what is 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:37.870
 more excess eat well and look at your 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.580
 nutrients or finish on the table a 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.290
 operating room not seeing to see what wave with 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.870
 heart and who I believe to 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:47.110
 As we nourish healthy and 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:51.340
 nourishingly we are going to be able to achieve a 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:55.990
 life to give everything without problems in anything 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:58.950
 and now let's put the gelatin 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:58.950
 and incorporate 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:06.750
 and we're also going to add the grenetina 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.370
 To the mix 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.170
 this is so that now the 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.540
 Gelatin and gelatin 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.550
 Well, they already know very famous 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:19.930
 grow your nails and that to grow the 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:23.230
 hair really yes or definitely 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:26.170
 is a food that helps a lot 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:29.080
 strengthen all the hair the nails 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:31.450
 teeth the bones is wonderful is a 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.830
 excellent source of protein and then 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.660
 when we are in the hospital 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.940
 we are sick without a doubt our 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:39.010
 gelatine there is always water 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.870
 Manches where gelatin comes first 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.670
 that enters the body to nourish everything 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.150
 everything that institute has to spend a 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.590
 serum whatever 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:50.069
 Or until 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:52.560
 an anesthesia that recovers very quickly the 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:55.860
 Gelatin really is very good plus the 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:58.080
 beet the organism of being partying 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:00.030
 and then we give the tequila to you 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:03.330
 relax 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:07.010
 of the chelas we are going to put the beet 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:07.010
 well spread throughout the mold 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.159
 Y 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:18.120
 to this mixture we are going to add the 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.420
 gelatin and we're going to refrigerate it 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.520
 that set 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:24.710
 and it was me myself and I 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.330
 they were playing is with orange and they know 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:30.110
 how it can be incorporated is 10 days 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:32.930
 delicious they put the juice of the orange in 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:35.300
 a cazuelita how is it and they put it to 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.689
 reduce so that half of the 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:42.269
 juice 

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:45.960
 and you can put a little bit this one that will be 

00:04:42.269 --> 00:04:50.460
 this segment so titan 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:52.740
 my mint goal makes a few mint leaves 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.660
 to have an infusion and leave it 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.630
 reduce even more they put a little bit of 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:59.409
 sugar and wash it over the gelatin 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:01.989
 I beats 

00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:03.999
 it can be very rich and at best and 

00:05:01.989 --> 00:05:05.199
 they can make beets like this with 

00:05:03.999 --> 00:05:07.500
 the same procedure and instead of putting 

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:10.080
 Beets put carrot 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:12.230
 It can also be very rich 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:16.420
 well now we are going to 

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:16.420
 put here the gelatin 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:25.130
 delicious 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:30.780
 and I say 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:32.699
 for wine he says more and more he wants the one 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.160
 Latin for wine not for the beetle very 

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:37.540

 up the wine 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:50.409
 ready and now we're going to put it upside down

 impress those who do not know that 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:02.369
 go with the beets we go to the table 

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:02.369
 presentation accompanies me 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:11.540
 today's pepper the beet is rich in 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:13.640
 important iron its consumption during the 

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:15.200
 pregnancy menstrual period before the 

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:18.860
 presence of anemia due to a production 

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:20.540
 of hemoglobin is also rich in salt and 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:24.370
 this is important to keep in mind 

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:24.370
 especially if your diet is low in sodium
