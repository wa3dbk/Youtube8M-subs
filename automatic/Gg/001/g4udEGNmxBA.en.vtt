these spaces you've probably seen these

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.310 
these spaces you've probably seen these
pieces<00:00:51.379> this<00:00:52.379> one's<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.800> little<00:00:52.890> bit<00:00:53.100> rare<00:00:54.320> this

it's so it's really easy s1 is also easy
for<00:01:05.880> me<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.320> then<00:01:07.320> other<00:01:07.439> parts<00:01:07.950> these<00:01:08.220> are

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
for me and then other parts these are

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.840 
for me and then other parts these are
quite<00:01:08.820> easy<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.439> this<00:01:10.439> one<00:01:10.710> not<00:01:11.010> so<00:01:11.070> much<00:01:11.520> but

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
quite easy to this one not so much but

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.560 
quite easy to this one not so much but
it's<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.930> same<00:01:13.170> thing<00:01:13.200> as<00:01:13.710> this<00:01:14.490> but<00:01:15.330> instead

it's the same thing as this but instead
up<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:15.930> plus<00:01:16.920> it's<00:01:17.540> just<00:01:18.540> a<00:01:18.659> sec<00:01:18.869> just<00:01:18.900> a

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
up the plus it's just a sec just a

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.499 
up the plus it's just a sec just a
circle<00:01:19.799> for<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.100> technique<00:01:20.880> pieces<00:01:21.299> and

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
circle for the technique pieces and

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:27.039 
circle for the technique pieces and
stuff<00:01:22.400> um<00:01:23.400> you<00:01:24.330> need<00:01:24.540> some<00:01:24.810> any<00:01:25.680> length<00:01:26.130> rod

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:27.049 
stuff um you need some any length rod

to find and one of these these are kind
of<00:02:00.210> easy<00:02:00.329> two<00:02:00.680> on<00:02:01.680> one<00:02:01.979> side<00:02:02.159> has<00:02:02.250> a<00:02:02.310> plus<00:02:02.640> in

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
of easy two on one side has a plus in

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.150 
of easy two on one side has a plus in
the<00:02:03.000> other<00:02:03.090> side<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.630> Technic<00:02:04.729> so<00:02:06.890> the<00:02:07.890> first

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
the other side the Technic so the first

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.440 
the other side the Technic so the first
part<00:02:08.399> um

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
part um

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:15.259 
part um
I<00:02:12.230> you<00:02:13.230> need<00:02:13.500> to<00:02:13.560> make<00:02:13.739> this<00:02:13.920> basic<00:02:14.910> this<00:02:15.120> is

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269 
I you need to make this basic this is

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:19.190 
I you need to make this basic this is
the<00:02:15.390> body<00:02:16.010> body<00:02:17.010> part<00:02:17.720> this<00:02:18.720> is<00:02:18.810> part<00:02:19.050> of<00:02:19.080> it

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
the body body part this is part of it

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:25.850 
the body body part this is part of it
too<00:02:19.349> okay<00:02:20.569> so<00:02:21.680> you<00:02:22.680> get<00:02:22.920> this<00:02:23.640> piece<00:02:24.739> this<00:02:25.739> is

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
too okay so you get this piece this is

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:32.770 
too okay so you get this piece this is
going<00:02:25.980> to<00:02:26.040> be<00:02:26.160> the<00:02:26.280> handle<00:02:26.700> and<00:02:26.880> you<00:02:27.569> put<00:02:27.870> it<00:02:27.989> on

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.660 

all<00:02:33.780> the<00:02:33.840> way<00:02:34.080> and<00:02:35.269> then<00:02:37.130> you<00:02:38.130> end<00:02:38.310> up<00:02:38.430> you're

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
all the way and then you end up you're

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.589 
all the way and then you end up you're
going<00:02:38.790> to<00:02:38.849> put<00:02:39.440> this<00:02:40.440> piece<00:02:40.769> on<00:02:41.069> just<00:02:42.000> just<00:02:42.390> one

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
going to put this piece on just just one

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:45.470 
going to put this piece on just just one
of<00:02:42.720> them<00:02:43.340> remember<00:02:44.340> that<00:02:44.489> and<00:02:44.640> you<00:02:45.239> put<00:02:45.450> it

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
of them remember that and you put it

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:53.089 
of them remember that and you put it
going<00:02:45.930> the<00:02:46.530> opposite<00:02:46.890> direction<00:02:49.910> so<00:02:52.099> like

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
going the opposite direction so like

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:58.640 
going the opposite direction so like
that<00:02:53.690> and<00:02:55.250> then<00:02:56.250> you<00:02:56.459> get<00:02:56.670> this<00:02:57.209> piece<00:02:57.650> and

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
that and then you get this piece and

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.509 
that and then you get this piece and
it's<00:02:59.250> going<00:02:59.400> to<00:02:59.459> be<00:02:59.579> the<00:02:59.670> mag<00:03:00.170> then<00:03:01.170> on<00:03:01.440> it<00:03:02.310> can

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
it's going to be the mag then on it can

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:06.589 
it's going to be the mag then on it can
be<00:03:02.640> this<00:03:03.150> apiece<00:03:03.480> endler<00:03:04.280> you<00:03:05.280> probably<00:03:05.640> heard

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:06.599 
be this apiece endler you probably heard

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:10.069 
be this apiece endler you probably heard
of<00:03:06.750> it<00:03:06.870> but<00:03:07.049> and<00:03:07.489> you<00:03:08.489> can<00:03:08.640> use<00:03:08.760> that<00:03:08.880> too<00:03:09.090> and
