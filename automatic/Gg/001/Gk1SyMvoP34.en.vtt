00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.610
 the deliberate foundation version 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.650
 Brazilian eludes you 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.259
 we had just gotten off the ground 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.240
 destructive war on the face of the earth 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.090
 World War II and millions of 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.189
 and we had just been through 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.619
 This is suddenly according to the 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.779
 document serve us outside objects 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.970
 on the seat in American airspace 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.859
 the eyeglass researcher and speaker 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.869
 The work of kings has passed 22 years 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.540
 studying the interest of the United States 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.210
 and reactions to the reports on 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.620
 works concluded that the government did not 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.579
 is just fooling the public 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.579
 American 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.860
 he is deceiving himself I do not think 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.989
 coincidence that the phenomenon has 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.000
 increased its activity precisely 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.079
 at the moment of human history in which 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.390
 nuclear weapons and I 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:57.360
 I interviewed 21 former military personnel 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.270
 associated with squadrons of 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.210
 nuclear missiles in which they referred to 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.729
 incidents involving the presence is of 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.920
 UFOs 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.170
 this theory is based in part on the 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.710
 personal experiences and robotic 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.720
 Excellent Air Force in 1964 manager 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.759
 Jacobs claimed to be at the base of the 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.490
 of vandenberg have seen a UFO 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:23.909
 that haunts have today 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:26.100
 my hair, you're just thinking of it alone. 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.079
 remember that day I saw something that was 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:33.119
 So strange that it changed my life, my 

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:34.979
 way of seeing the universe I use our 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.710
 place in it 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.390
 in 1964 the way work lieutenant 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.429
 was serving at the Air Force Base 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.229
 from vandenberg may he 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:45.509
 in charge of registering in films 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.580
 tests performed by the current head of 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.470
 minuteman missiles both systems 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.570
 nuclear weapons launch 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.090
 when you throw a piece of 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.880
 equipment of US $ 45 million and 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.369
 this piece explodes at almost 300 meters 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.380
 I think it's a good idea for families to 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.720
 showing why it exploded 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.390
 my job was to take pictures with cameras 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:10.410
 in 40 different productions for each 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:12.090
 launch in November 1964 of fields 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.130
 was assigned to form a test of 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.170
 risen vandenberg using a new, 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.549
 sophisticated telescope developed in the 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.890
 university of boston 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:22.290
 were the most powerful lenses ever used 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.660
 by the largest air force since the 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.290
 We had in our room and 45 had four 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.630
 meters 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.940
 this telescope that not vocal range 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.670
 lots of genta members you can see the 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.769
 which was huge even so large that 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.019
 when it came from the gang wan 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:39.780
 telescope of boston university did 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:42.120
 a framework just three 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.459
 that we see an athlete and 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:48.209
 fill a frame this at a distance 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:49.709
 of about 130 nautical miles in one 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:51.989
 Super Secret Mission The Telescope 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:54.660
 high of boston aboard an airplane 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:56.489
 Hercules and whether the actual film made by 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.290
 unit of records and recently 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.090
 discovered in your file 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.760
 the telescope was so large that it needed 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.700
 be loaded onto a container truck 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.500
 the team of jacobs assisted the inventor 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.660
 the walter mooney telescope at 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:13.380
 installation of the camera lens has 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.690
 installed in the bit point of 210 meters 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.090
 launch site 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.750
 we have the three stages of ignition of 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.269
 flight 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.500
 through our new ones we saw what 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:24.440
 happened 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.909
 it was a test of a missile 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.680
 anti-missile super secret created for 

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:29.819
 confuse the enemy missiles 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.709
 reach your target 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:33.959
 the camera was programmed to follow the 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:36.030
 missile automatically and to rotate through 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:41.239
 six minutes from the point where the missile 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:44.970
 it was visible what we do not know is what 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:46.590
 we will record beyond it afterwards 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.629
 that the film was revealed the director of 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:51.510
 project major florence - mano called 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:53.010
 jacobs in his major office - no 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.040
 I was alone 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:59.010
 two guys use twitter wearing clothes 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.989
 civilians they were not from the air force were 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.000
 elsewhere than not 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:05.579
 identified convinced intelligence 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.530
 strategic service as the 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:11.159
 watched his film the presence of these 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:13.909
 mysterious officers the nose on Sundays in 

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:17.669
 April the warhead was almost invisible 

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:20.430
 something that the game curbs what I 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:24.300
 via a circular object is a flying saucer 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:25.919
 classic where he shot a lightning bolt 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:29.160
 with ours the hump 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:30.810
 you can imagine that thing flying 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.639
 thousands of miles per hour that she 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.800
 when I was flying and then some 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:36.720
 thing on the picture behind it and 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.300
 in this form and shoots and continues 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.970
 following this way and firing against this 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:44.250
 way and vote the way with the effect 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.090
 that exactly the major - did not want 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:49.030
 to know 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:52.480
 He said what was what I said 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:56.350
 but I think we took a UFO and he said 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:58.030
 never say this is new in what it says 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:01.270
 respect to lieutenant 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:04.470
 This never happened, refusing to reveal 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:07.060
 silent remind me how much security 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:11.170
 military breakdown of security 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:13.740
 I had to leave 18 years with 

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:16.480
 that image in my average 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:17.830
 after 18 years of kobe silence 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.810
 felt compelled to make everything 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:22.510
 when he made the answer 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:24.700
 Air Force officer was amazing. 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:26.590
 the air force denied that I have been 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:28.660
 the water there was a lieutenant a lobby 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:30.760
 other air force vehicles have screen 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:32.860
 there is no punishment at the base of the flu if he 

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:34.810
 had or was at the base of the force 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:36.700
 of vandenberg would never be 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:39.880
 in charge of the instrumentation section 

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:41.650
 the work of the photographic squadron in that 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:44.050
 base 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:46.090
 they denied that there was a 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:48.070
 sighting somewhere they arrived 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:50.590
 plane that discovers the call of 'the 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:54.820
 nor to catch the day v 1 of the turn 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:56.620
 humans well they denied all our 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:58.830
 However, it has obtained documents 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:01.180
 prove that he was in the air force in 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:02.410
 1964 and who was in charge of 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:05.440
 operation with the instrumentation 

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:07.660
 photographic in victory in a letter o 

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:09.490
 our flowers program even higher 

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:11.020
 straight from the lieutenant who cox the man 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:12.430
 present when the man of the film was 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:14.590
 displayed says 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:17.890
 I'm writing to confirm the doctor. 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:20.110
 jacob counted as he described in the 

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:22.000
 However, the greatest evidence 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:25.060
 film that proves the existence of a 

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:29.290
 event that the Air Force continues to 

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:31.960
 I like to train the air force. 

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:33.610
 like this thread but there is nothing 

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:35.590
 they can do because there is a 

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:38.139
 document the telescope to people who 

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:40.570
 they were there even saw it and if there 

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:45.040
 complication I think I do not care anymore 

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:47.200
 more with the recent opening of the archives 

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:48.790
 of the former Soviet Union indicates that 

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:51.040
 sighting of orders in military bases 

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:53.139
 nuclear installations will not 

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:55.300
 limited to the United States during the 

00:06:53.139 --> 00:06:56.740
 In the 1970s and 1980s several 

00:06:55.300 --> 00:07:01.200
 sighted in government facilities 

00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:01.200
 in russia and siberia
