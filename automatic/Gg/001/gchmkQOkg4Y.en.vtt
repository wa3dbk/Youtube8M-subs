your<00:00:11.499> racket<00:00:12.219> head<00:00:12.339> speeds<00:00:12.669> I<00:00:13.110> think<00:00:14.110> most<00:00:14.289> of

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:14.410 
your racket head speeds I think most of

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:16.859 
your racket head speeds I think most of
us<00:00:14.530> when<00:00:14.860> we<00:00:15.009> hit<00:00:15.190> the<00:00:15.339> ball<00:00:15.570> we<00:00:16.570> tend<00:00:16.810> to

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:16.869 
us when we hit the ball we tend to

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:21.390 
us when we hit the ball we tend to
decelerate<00:00:17.609> wants<00:00:18.609> to<00:00:18.789> contact<00:00:19.240> the<00:00:19.330> ball<00:00:20.400> the

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:21.400 
decelerate wants to contact the ball the

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.609 
decelerate wants to contact the ball the
key<00:00:21.609> is<00:00:21.929> don't<00:00:22.929> choke<00:00:23.230> oh<00:00:23.519> your<00:00:24.519> ribs<00:00:25.619> you

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:26.619 
key is don't choke oh your ribs you

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:28.829 
key is don't choke oh your ribs you
should<00:00:26.830> squeeze<00:00:27.279> your<00:00:27.640> group<00:00:28.179> or<00:00:28.419> tighten<00:00:28.720> it

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:28.839 
should squeeze your group or tighten it

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:32.220 
should squeeze your group or tighten it
up<00:00:28.869> at<00:00:29.859> the<00:00:30.009> point<00:00:30.250> of<00:00:30.310> contact<00:00:30.990> it's<00:00:31.990> kind<00:00:32.169> of

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:32.230 
up at the point of contact it's kind of

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:33.740 
up at the point of contact it's kind of
difficult<00:00:32.410> at<00:00:32.740> the<00:00:32.800> beginning<00:00:32.950> but

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
difficult at the beginning but

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.470 
difficult at the beginning but
eventually<00:00:34.750> you<00:00:35.110> will<00:00:35.340> you<00:00:36.340> will<00:00:36.460> get<00:00:36.610> it<00:00:36.760> so

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:37.480 
eventually you will you will get it so

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:43.110 
eventually you will you will get it so
on<00:00:38.820> example<00:00:39.820> we<00:00:40.030> a<00:00:40.390> boxer<00:00:41.289> or<00:00:42.120> baseball

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.120 
on example we a boxer or baseball

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.439 
on example we a boxer or baseball
pitcher<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:45.010> arms<00:00:45.460> the<00:00:45.610> body<00:00:45.850> I<00:00:46.000> totally

00:00:46.439 --> 00:00:46.449 
pitcher the arms the body I totally

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:50.490 
pitcher the arms the body I totally
relax<00:00:47.190> before<00:00:48.190> they<00:00:48.460> toss<00:00:48.670> the<00:00:48.910> ball<00:00:49.500> so

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:50.500 
relax before they toss the ball so

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.229 
relax before they toss the ball so
that's<00:00:50.680> why<00:00:51.239> people<00:00:52.239> in<00:00:52.719> the<00:00:53.050> slender<00:00:53.440> size

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
that's why people in the slender size

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.450 
that's why people in the slender size
doesn't<00:00:55.239> matter<00:00:55.269> of<00:00:55.899> the<00:00:56.829> are<00:00:56.980> big<00:00:57.160> they<00:00:57.190> are

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.460 
doesn't matter of the are big they are

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.389 
doesn't matter of the are big they are
but<00:00:58.120> it<00:00:58.269> tends<00:00:58.480> to<00:00:58.600> have<00:00:58.899> a<00:00:59.129> bigger<00:01:00.129> bottle

00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:00.399 
but it tends to have a bigger bottle

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:02.819 
but it tends to have a bigger bottle
rocket<00:01:00.879> hair<00:01:01.090> or<00:01:01.510> faster<00:01:02.109> rapid<00:01:02.410> head<00:01:02.559> speed

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:02.829 
rocket hair or faster rapid head speed

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:06.469 
rocket hair or faster rapid head speed
so<00:01:03.399> let<00:01:03.910> me<00:01:03.969> show<00:01:04.120> you<00:01:04.180> a<00:01:04.300> series<00:01:04.570> of<00:01:04.750> it

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
so let me show you a series of it

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.320 
so let me show you a series of it
increase<00:01:07.479> your<00:01:07.659> backswing<00:01:08.140> will<00:01:09.150> also<00:01:10.150> help

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 
increase your backswing will also help

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.630 
increase your backswing will also help
generate<00:01:10.720> rapid<00:01:11.140> recipe<00:01:11.590> but<00:01:12.220> the<00:01:12.340> bottom

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
generate rapid recipe but the bottom

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.420 
generate rapid recipe but the bottom
line<00:01:12.670> is<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:14.020> group's<00:01:14.290> no<00:01:14.680> chalk<00:01:14.950> it<00:01:15.100> up<00:01:15.159> right

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 
line is the group's no chalk it up right

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:16.950 
line is the group's no chalk it up right
from<00:01:15.580> the<00:01:15.670> beginning<00:01:15.729> when<00:01:16.450> you're<00:01:16.600> choking

let's<00:02:27.709> say<00:02:27.860> holding<00:02:28.190> it<00:02:28.310> tight<00:02:28.550> and<00:02:29.080> you<00:02:30.080> see

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
let's say holding it tight and you see

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.840 
let's say holding it tight and you see
how<00:02:30.380> fast<00:02:30.560> it<00:02:30.770> going<00:02:31.069> and<00:02:31.190> holding<00:02:31.550> it<00:02:31.640> loose

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
how fast it going and holding it loose

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.380 
how fast it going and holding it loose
lips<00:02:32.770> so<00:02:33.770> this<00:02:33.980> is<00:02:34.160> a<00:02:34.190> beginning<00:02:34.640> is<00:02:35.060> going<00:02:35.300> to

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
lips so this is a beginning is going to

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.800 
lips so this is a beginning is going to
be<00:02:35.590> called<00:02:36.590> holding<00:02:37.010> tight<00:02:37.220> choking<00:02:37.880> up<00:02:38.000> my<00:02:38.300> my

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
be called holding tight choking up my my

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:47.320 
be called holding tight choking up my my
groups<00:02:39.050> here<00:02:39.230> you<00:02:39.860> see<00:02:40.010> how<00:02:40.160> I<00:02:40.190> again<00:02:46.180> if<00:02:47.180> you

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
groups here you see how I again if you

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.250 
groups here you see how I again if you
notice<00:02:47.660> that<00:02:48.190> my<00:02:49.190> rocket<00:02:49.519> speed<00:02:49.790> is<00:02:49.970> ok<00:02:50.360> but<00:02:51.050> it

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
notice that my rocket speed is ok but it

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.809 
notice that my rocket speed is ok but it
seems<00:02:51.530> like<00:02:51.860> I'm<00:02:52.250> forcing<00:02:52.760> it<00:02:53.120> I'm<00:02:53.510> not<00:02:54.819> not

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:55.819 
seems like I'm forcing it I'm not not

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:59.259 
seems like I'm forcing it I'm not not
letting<00:02:56.150> it<00:02:56.239> flow<00:02:56.900> so<00:02:57.530> it's<00:02:58.220> really<00:02:58.640> taxing<00:02:58.970> on

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
letting it flow so it's really taxing on

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:02.050 
letting it flow so it's really taxing on
my<00:02:59.299> arm<00:02:59.600> my<00:02:59.840> shoulder<00:02:59.950> and<00:03:00.950> everywhere<00:03:01.430> so<00:03:01.880> now

my arm my shoulder and everywhere so now
let's<00:03:02.360> do<00:03:02.510> a<00:03:02.540> series<00:03:03.019> covering<00:03:03.440> luxation<00:03:05.260> when

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
let's do a series covering luxation when

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:16.410 
let's do a series covering luxation when
I<00:03:06.290> swing<00:03:08.080> notice<00:03:09.080> he<00:03:09.440> knows<00:03:09.739> the<00:03:09.980> difference

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.120 

I'm<00:03:17.420> gonna<00:03:17.570> turn<00:03:17.720> sideway<00:03:18.200> so<00:03:18.739> you<00:03:18.829> can<00:03:18.950> see

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
I'm gonna turn sideway so you can see

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:24.460 
I'm gonna turn sideway so you can see
what<00:03:19.280> I<00:03:19.310> mean<00:03:22.420> the<00:03:23.420> key<00:03:23.600> is<00:03:23.810> when<00:03:24.140> your<00:03:24.320> knees

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
what I mean the key is when your knees

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:33.280 
what I mean the key is when your knees
and<00:03:24.769> then<00:03:25.340> use<00:03:25.910> your<00:03:25.989> cohorts<00:03:26.989> on<00:03:27.109> hip<00:03:27.410> awesome

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:46.690 

Oh<00:03:44.079> anyway<00:03:45.079> you<00:03:45.680> should<00:03:45.859> try<00:03:46.040> yourself<00:03:46.250> an

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
Oh anyway you should try yourself an

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.130 
Oh anyway you should try yourself an
experiment

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:52.720 

you
