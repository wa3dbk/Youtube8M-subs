up<00:04:44.130> and<00:04:44.340> it<00:04:44.400> starts<00:04:44.610> to<00:04:44.700> push<00:04:44.910> out<00:04:45.090> so<00:04:45.450> much<00:04:45.630> as

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
up and it starts to push out so much as

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:47.390 
up and it starts to push out so much as
soon<00:04:45.900> as<00:04:46.020> this<00:04:46.080> conditioner<00:04:46.650> touches<00:04:47.070> it<00:04:47.220> that

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400
