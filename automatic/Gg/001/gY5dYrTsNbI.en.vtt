00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.330 
to look take a look at these blades the
camera<00:00:38.870> could<00:00:39.020> come<00:00:39.230> in<00:00:40.570> the<00:00:41.570> new<00:00:41.780> blade

doesn't<00:00:43.340> have<00:00:43.460> any<00:00:43.640> glues<00:00:44.559> in<00:00:45.559> it<00:00:46.309> at<00:00:46.430> all<00:00:46.579> you

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
doesn't have any glues in it at all you

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.299 
doesn't have any glues in it at all you
can<00:00:47.059> see<00:00:47.210> that<00:00:47.239> the<00:00:48.140> whole<00:00:48.320> blade<00:00:48.649> has<00:00:48.920> rules

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:49.309 
can see that the whole blade has rules

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:53.080 
can see that the whole blade has rules
and<00:00:50.800> in<00:00:51.800> it<00:00:51.980> so<00:00:52.219> I<00:00:52.309> don't<00:00:52.370> know<00:00:52.640> if<00:00:52.850> that's

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090 
and in it so I don't know if that's

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.959 
and in it so I don't know if that's
going<00:00:53.300> to<00:00:53.390> be<00:00:53.450> a<00:00:53.480> difference<00:00:54.079> in<00:00:54.379> the<00:00:54.530> cut<00:00:54.969> but

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:55.969 
going to be a difference in the cut but

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:59.590 
going to be a difference in the cut but
I<00:00:56.270> noticed<00:00:56.989> that<00:00:57.820> when<00:00:58.820> I<00:00:58.879> had<00:00:59.149> a<00:00:59.180> chance<00:00:59.480> to

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
I noticed that when I had a chance to

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.080 
I noticed that when I had a chance to
look<00:00:59.750> at<00:00:59.870> it<00:00:59.989> out<00:01:00.170> of<00:01:00.260> the<00:01:00.350> box<00:01:00.590> that<00:01:01.309> there<00:01:01.789> are

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.090 
look at it out of the box that there are

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:07.840 
look at it out of the box that there are
no<00:01:02.300> rules<00:01:02.629> at<00:01:03.110> the<00:01:03.230> top<00:01:03.440> of<00:01:03.590> this<00:01:05.770> blade<00:01:06.770> so<00:01:07.159> it

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
no rules at the top of this blade so it

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.399 
no rules at the top of this blade so it
might<00:01:08.029> cut<00:01:08.329> the<00:01:08.420> same<00:01:08.659> a<00:01:08.689> might<00:01:08.929> not<00:01:09.109> cut<00:01:09.289> the

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
might cut the same a might not cut the

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:10.539 
might cut the same a might not cut the
same<00:01:09.619> but<00:01:09.889> I'm<00:01:09.979> just<00:01:10.100> going<00:01:10.310> to<00:01:10.340> show<00:01:10.490> you

the outside blade okay this is this is
actually<00:02:33.709> called<00:02:34.159> your<00:02:34.819> moving<00:02:35.239> blade<00:02:35.480> so

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
actually called your moving blade so

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.319 
actually called your moving blade so
that<00:02:36.319> blends<00:02:36.709> might<00:02:36.980> be<00:02:37.189> lower<00:02:37.459> than<00:02:38.150> your

so this is alright it's almost there
that's<00:02:47.569> that's<00:02:48.079> that's<00:02:48.560> what<00:02:48.829> you<00:02:48.980> want<00:02:49.219> you

then the old one I had so that's that's
cool<00:04:57.740> like<00:04:57.980> that<00:04:58.220> though<00:04:58.780> that's<00:04:59.780> really

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900 
cool like that though that's really

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:04.080 
cool like that though that's really
strong<00:05:01.090> these<00:05:02.090> mighty<00:05:02.330> wanted<00:05:02.750> saw<00:05:03.560> because

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.090 
strong these mighty wanted saw because

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:07.300 
strong these mighty wanted saw because
when<00:05:05.090> you're<00:05:05.210> doing<00:05:05.419> the<00:05:05.480> design

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 
when you're doing the design

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:11.470 
when you're doing the design
that's<00:05:08.300> not<00:05:08.510> as<00:05:08.630> shocked<00:05:08.900> as<00:05:09.020> ever<00:05:10.270> this<00:05:11.270> new

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:11.480 
that's not as shocked as ever this new

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:13.090 
that's not as shocked as ever this new
ones<00:05:11.690> now<00:05:11.750> is<00:05:11.960> sharper<00:05:12.380> than<00:05:12.410> this<00:05:12.620> one<00:05:12.830> so<00:05:12.860> I

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:13.100 
ones now is sharper than this one so I

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.760 
ones now is sharper than this one so I
can<00:05:13.310> probably<00:05:13.520> just<00:05:13.730> it<00:05:14.060> what<00:05:14.500> you<00:05:15.500> want<00:05:15.710> to

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:15.770 
can probably just it what you want to

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:16.960 
can probably just it what you want to
shop<00:05:16.040> because<00:05:16.370> when<00:05:16.639> you're<00:05:16.730> doing<00:05:16.820> the

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:16.970 
shop because when you're doing the

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:19.270 
shop because when you're doing the
design<00:05:17.300> of<00:05:17.450> someone's<00:05:17.750> head<00:05:18.010> you<00:05:19.010> just<00:05:19.040> want

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 
design of someone's head you just want

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.790 
design of someone's head you just want
to<00:05:19.340> tap<00:05:19.550> you<00:05:19.820> don't<00:05:19.970> want<00:05:20.090> to<00:05:20.150> be<00:05:20.650> pushing<00:05:21.650> down

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 
to tap you don't want to be pushing down

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.430 
to tap you don't want to be pushing down
hard<00:05:22.280> and<00:05:22.700> trying<00:05:22.940> to<00:05:23.090> get<00:05:23.270> you<00:05:23.419> know<00:05:23.570> good

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:24.440 
hard and trying to get you know good

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.170 
hard and trying to get you know good
design<00:05:24.770> because<00:05:24.980> you<00:05:25.310> end<00:05:25.460> up<00:05:25.610> when<00:05:25.940> you<00:05:26.030> have
