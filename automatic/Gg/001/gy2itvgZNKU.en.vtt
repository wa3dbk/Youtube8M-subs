cables the you have the latches these

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.280 
cables the you have the latches these
are<00:01:35.280> quick<00:01:35.460> releases<00:01:35.820> for<00:01:36.390> your<00:01:36.600> speakers<00:01:37.110> so

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
are quick releases for your speakers so

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.469 
are quick releases for your speakers so
when<00:01:37.470> you<00:01:37.619> take<00:01:37.799> these<00:01:38.070> speakers<00:01:38.579> off

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:44.529 

the<00:01:42.049> speakers<00:01:42.439> look<00:01:42.619> like<00:01:42.799> this<00:01:43.539> these

00:01:44.529 --> 00:01:44.539 
the speakers look like this these

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:46.510 
the speakers look like this these
speaker<00:01:45.049> adapters<00:01:45.619> on<00:01:45.799> the<00:01:45.920> bottom<00:01:46.280> here

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
speaker adapters on the bottom here

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.270 
speaker adapters on the bottom here
these<00:01:47.360> are<00:01:47.600> going<00:01:47.630> to<00:01:47.810> be<00:01:47.960> inside<00:01:48.680> the<00:01:49.100> box

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
these are going to be inside the box

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.399 
these are going to be inside the box
inside<00:01:49.759> the<00:01:50.000> styrofoam<00:01:50.390> so<00:01:50.869> you<00:01:50.960> take<00:01:51.170> these

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
inside the styrofoam so you take these

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:54.190 
inside the styrofoam so you take these
out<00:01:51.619> and<00:01:51.799> you<00:01:52.399> basically<00:01:52.670> slide<00:01:53.570> them<00:01:53.869> in<00:01:54.049> it

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
out and you basically slide them in it

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.399 
out and you basically slide them in it
has<00:01:54.380> incrementals<00:01:55.250> where<00:01:56.030> it<00:01:56.689> stops<00:01:57.079> right

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
has incrementals where it stops right

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:58.779 
has incrementals where it stops right
here<00:01:57.710> you<00:01:57.920> have<00:01:58.039> to<00:01:58.159> apply<00:01:58.340> a<00:01:58.429> little<00:01:58.640> more

00:01:58.779 --> 00:01:58.789 
here you have to apply a little more

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:00.279 
here you have to apply a little more
pressure<00:01:58.909> to<00:01:59.390> get<00:01:59.479> it<00:01:59.539> to<00:01:59.750> the<00:01:59.869> middle<00:02:00.079> and

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:00.289 
pressure to get it to the middle and

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:02.529 
pressure to get it to the middle and
then<00:02:00.950> you<00:02:01.130> can<00:02:01.280> mount<00:02:01.460> your<00:02:01.670> speaker<00:02:02.149> the<00:02:02.329> back

00:02:02.529 --> 00:02:02.539 
then you can mount your speaker the back

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:04.899 
then you can mount your speaker the back
of<00:02:02.720> the<00:02:02.810> speaker<00:02:03.189> the<00:02:04.189> way<00:02:04.310> I<00:02:04.340> set<00:02:04.670> it<00:02:04.789> up<00:02:04.850> for

of the speaker the way I set it up for

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:07.389 
of the speaker the way I set it up for
him<00:02:05.090> is<00:02:05.299> a<00:02:05.329> little<00:02:05.569> bit<00:02:05.659> different<00:02:06.399> most

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399 
him is a little bit different most

this<00:02:10.130> but<00:02:10.610> I<00:02:10.700> had<00:02:10.910> an<00:02:11.030> extra<00:02:11.360> set<00:02:11.569> of<00:02:11.599> these<00:02:11.840> to

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
this but I had an extra set of these to

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.110 
this but I had an extra set of these to
make<00:02:12.379> it<00:02:12.530> easier<00:02:12.920> he<00:02:13.069> has<00:02:13.250> that<00:02:13.459> there<00:02:13.790> and<00:02:14.060> he

just plugs this straight in and then you

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:20.589 
just plugs this straight in and then you

cables these XLR cables are going out to

this set of wireless microphones the

this set of wireless microphones the

microphone<00:03:07.489> input<00:03:07.819> where<00:03:08.030> you<00:03:08.180> run<00:03:08.389> both<00:03:09.010> mics

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
microphone input where you run both mics

off<00:03:10.340> of<00:03:10.579> a<00:03:10.700> single<00:03:10.880> channel<00:03:11.359> and<00:03:11.480> the<00:03:11.540> reason

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
off of a single channel and the reason

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.710 
off of a single channel and the reason
why<00:03:11.900> they<00:03:12.079> build<00:03:12.350> that<00:03:12.590> the<00:03:13.430> way<00:03:13.549> they<00:03:13.730> do<00:03:13.790> is

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
why they build that the way they do is

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.140 
why they build that the way they do is
just<00:03:14.780> a<00:03:15.319> case<00:03:15.560> you<00:03:15.799> want<00:03:16.010> to<00:03:16.100> maximize<00:03:16.639> as<00:03:16.850> many

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
just a case you want to maximize as many

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.490 
just a case you want to maximize as many
mics<00:03:17.450> as<00:03:17.630> you<00:03:17.810> can<00:03:18.250> because<00:03:19.250> he's<00:03:19.639> only<00:03:19.850> using

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
mics as you can because he's only using

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.400 
mics as you can because he's only using
two<00:03:21.500> plus<00:03:22.010> two<00:03:22.310> corded<00:03:22.700> mics<00:03:22.910> his<00:03:23.090> backup<00:03:23.630> the

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
two plus two corded mics his backup the

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.319 
two plus two corded mics his backup the
way<00:03:24.590> I<00:03:24.620> set<00:03:24.920> this<00:03:25.040> up<00:03:25.250> was<00:03:25.489> to<00:03:25.819> put<00:03:26.000> special

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:26.329 
way I set this up was to put special

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:28.990 
way I set this up was to put special
patches<00:03:27.079> so<00:03:27.680> that<00:03:27.799> I<00:03:27.829> could<00:03:28.069> separate<00:03:28.579> both

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
patches so that I could separate both

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.620 
patches so that I could separate both
these<00:03:29.269> so<00:03:29.599> you<00:03:29.660> run<00:03:29.989> mic<00:03:30.620> one<00:03:30.920> here<00:03:31.370> mic<00:03:32.329> two

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
these so you run mic one here mic two

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:33.520 
these so you run mic one here mic two
there

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
there

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.980 
there
you<00:03:33.680> control<00:03:34.130> mic<00:03:34.400> 1<00:03:34.700> &amp;<00:03:34.880> 2<00:03:35.060> with<00:03:35.330> the<00:03:35.450> channel<00:03:35.690> 1

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:35.990 
you control mic 1 &amp; 2 with the channel 1

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:39.610 
you control mic 1 &amp; 2 with the channel 1
&amp;<00:03:36.170> 2<00:03:36.350> so<00:03:37.340> this<00:03:37.520> way<00:03:37.670> let's<00:03:37.940> say<00:03:38.090> he<00:03:38.270> has<00:03:38.300> a<00:03:38.620> male

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
&amp; 2 so this way let's say he has a male

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.290 
&amp; 2 so this way let's say he has a male
singer<00:03:40.160> on<00:03:40.340> channel<00:03:40.880> 1<00:03:41.200> male<00:03:42.280> vocals

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:43.300 
singer on channel 1 male vocals

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.420 
singer on channel 1 male vocals
typically<00:03:44.300> have<00:03:44.540> naturally<00:03:45.290> more<00:03:45.470> bass<00:03:45.740> so<00:03:46.280> he

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
typically have naturally more bass so he

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.760 
typically have naturally more bass so he
could<00:03:46.610> load<00:03:46.790> the<00:03:46.970> bass<00:03:47.150> then<00:03:48.140> let's<00:03:48.380> say<00:03:48.560> on

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:48.770 
could load the bass then let's say on

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:55.180 
could load the bass then let's say on
channel<00:03:49.610> 2<00:03:50.440> he<00:03:51.440> has<00:03:51.680> the<00:03:53.020> female<00:03:54.020> singer<00:03:54.440> he

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
channel 2 he has the female singer he

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.880 
channel 2 he has the female singer he
could<00:03:55.370> boost<00:03:55.640> the<00:03:55.940> lows<00:03:56.150> on<00:03:56.480> there<00:03:56.750> so<00:03:57.470> let's

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:57.890 
could boost the lows on there so let's

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:59.770 
could boost the lows on there so let's
go<00:03:58.069> over<00:03:58.340> the<00:03:58.459> the<00:03:58.700> channel<00:03:59.090> itself<00:03:59.420> you<00:03:59.630> have

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
go over the the channel itself you have

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.650 
go over the the channel itself you have
the<00:03:59.900> highs<00:04:00.140> mids<00:04:01.010> and<00:04:01.280> lows<00:04:01.370> that's<00:04:02.150> basically

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
the highs mids and lows that's basically

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.740 
the highs mids and lows that's basically
just<00:04:02.840> an<00:04:02.989> EQ<00:04:03.470> to<00:04:03.860> adjust<00:04:04.310> you<00:04:05.270> have<00:04:05.510> the

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
just an EQ to adjust you have the

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.920 
just an EQ to adjust you have the
effects<00:04:06.200> all<00:04:06.709> this<00:04:06.980> is<00:04:07.220> is<00:04:07.519> how<00:04:07.730> much<00:04:08.180> echo<00:04:08.780> do

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
effects all this is is how much echo do

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.280 
effects all this is is how much echo do
you<00:04:09.050> allow<00:04:09.260> to<00:04:09.320> get<00:04:09.680> into<00:04:09.980> that<00:04:10.209> individual

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
you allow to get into that individual

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.990 
you allow to get into that individual
channel<00:04:12.290> then<00:04:12.920> you<00:04:13.040> have<00:04:13.220> what's<00:04:13.459> called<00:04:13.550> a

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
channel then you have what's called a

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.420 
channel then you have what's called a
pan<00:04:14.300> or<00:04:14.660> on<00:04:15.110> some<00:04:15.470> mixers<00:04:15.830> are<00:04:16.010> called

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
pan or on some mixers are called

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.180 
pan or on some mixers are called
a<00:04:16.549> balance<00:04:17.390> and<00:04:17.690> basically<00:04:18.680> what<00:04:18.829> that<00:04:18.859> is<00:04:19.010> is

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
a balance and basically what that is is

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.520 
a balance and basically what that is is
it's<00:04:19.519> shifting<00:04:19.970> the<00:04:20.570> sound<00:04:20.840> from<00:04:21.140> left<00:04:21.410> to

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
it's shifting the sound from left to

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:23.440 
it's shifting the sound from left to
right<00:04:21.799> most<00:04:22.070> often<00:04:22.580> you'll<00:04:22.760> never<00:04:23.000> mess<00:04:23.270> with

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:23.450 
right most often you'll never mess with

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:24.790 
right most often you'll never mess with
this<00:04:23.600> the<00:04:23.810> only<00:04:23.900> time<00:04:23.990> I<00:04:24.320> could<00:04:24.470> see<00:04:24.500> someone

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
this the only time I could see someone

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.830 
this the only time I could see someone
messing<00:04:25.190> with<00:04:25.250> this<00:04:25.460> is<00:04:25.640> let's<00:04:26.330> say<00:04:26.479> you<00:04:26.540> put

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
messing with this is let's say you put

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.320 
messing with this is let's say you put
one<00:04:27.110> speaker<00:04:27.560> in<00:04:27.680> one<00:04:27.890> room<00:04:28.190> and<00:04:28.400> another

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
one speaker in one room and another

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.930 
one speaker in one room and another
speaker<00:04:29.810> in<00:04:29.930> another<00:04:30.229> room<00:04:30.669> because<00:04:31.669> you<00:04:31.790> have

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
speaker in another room because you have

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.300 
speaker in another room because you have
to<00:04:32.120> do<00:04:32.240> a<00:04:32.270> presentation<00:04:32.510> and<00:04:33.320> you<00:04:33.950> don't<00:04:34.160> need

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
to do a presentation and you don't need

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.430 
to do a presentation and you don't need
both<00:04:34.610> speakers<00:04:35.090> going<00:04:35.479> so<00:04:35.750> the<00:04:35.840> one<00:04:36.020> room<00:04:36.290> you

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
both speakers going so the one room you

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.680 
both speakers going so the one room you
could<00:04:36.530> switch<00:04:36.770> over<00:04:36.919> there<00:04:37.310> the<00:04:37.550> other<00:04:37.580> and<00:04:38.090> so

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
could switch over there the other and so

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:42.760 
could switch over there the other and so
forth<00:04:38.960> then<00:04:39.530> you<00:04:39.740> have<00:04:39.950> your<00:04:40.220> main<00:04:41.110> volume<00:04:42.110> for

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
forth then you have your main volume for

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
forth then you have your main volume for
this<00:04:43.130> individual<00:04:44.090> channel<00:04:45.190> you<00:04:46.190> have<00:04:46.370> below

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:46.790 
this individual channel you have below

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:50.469 
this individual channel you have below
here<00:04:47.150> the<00:04:47.180> EQ<00:04:48.490> EQ<00:04:49.490> you're<00:04:49.669> gonna<00:04:49.789> set<00:04:50.120> to<00:04:50.360> the

00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:50.479 
here the EQ EQ you're gonna set to the

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:53.200 
here the EQ EQ you're gonna set to the
rooms<00:04:50.720> acoustics<00:04:51.380> I<00:04:51.620> would<00:04:52.520> tell<00:04:52.729> you<00:04:52.760> to<00:04:53.000> set

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210 
rooms acoustics I would tell you to set

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.630 
rooms acoustics I would tell you to set
it<00:04:53.240> all<00:04:53.539> at<00:04:53.780> zero<00:04:54.229> and<00:04:54.470> then<00:04:54.860> start<00:04:55.160> going<00:04:55.370> up

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:55.640 
it all at zero and then start going up

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.640 
it all at zero and then start going up
on<00:04:55.850> each<00:04:56.030> channel<00:04:56.600> and<00:04:56.780> just<00:04:56.990> getting<00:04:57.350> a<00:04:57.440> feel

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:57.650 
on each channel and just getting a feel

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.010 
on each channel and just getting a feel
for<00:04:57.919> what<00:04:58.100> what<00:04:58.610> seems<00:04:58.970> to<00:04:59.210> peak<00:04:59.390> out<00:04:59.570> as<00:04:59.810> the

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
for what what seems to peak out as the

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.830 
for what what seems to peak out as the
as<00:05:00.229> the<00:05:00.289> best<00:05:00.830> sound<00:05:01.160> for<00:05:01.490> that<00:05:02.360> frequency

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 
as the best sound for that frequency

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:07.150 
as the best sound for that frequency
range<00:05:04.300> over<00:05:05.300> to<00:05:05.450> the<00:05:05.570> right<00:05:05.780> here<00:05:06.200> this<00:05:06.950> is

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 
range over to the right here this is

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.040 
range over to the right here this is
where<00:05:07.340> you're<00:05:07.490> gonna<00:05:07.580> have<00:05:07.850> your<00:05:08.150> echo<00:05:08.870> and

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 
where you're gonna have your echo and

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.890 
where you're gonna have your echo and
reverb<00:05:09.470> station<00:05:10.180> so<00:05:11.180> you<00:05:11.240> could<00:05:11.479> set<00:05:11.660> it<00:05:11.780> to

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:11.900 
reverb station so you could set it to

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:13.570 
reverb station so you could set it to
different<00:05:12.050> halls<00:05:12.440> and<00:05:12.740> so<00:05:12.950> forth

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:13.580 
different halls and so forth

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.210 
different halls and so forth
then<00:05:14.479> below<00:05:14.840> you<00:05:14.900> have<00:05:15.110> your<00:05:15.289> effects<00:05:15.890> this<00:05:16.160> is

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:16.220 
then below you have your effects this is

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.760 
then below you have your effects this is
your<00:05:16.520> main<00:05:16.789> effects<00:05:17.210> that<00:05:18.020> controls<00:05:18.530> the

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:18.770 
your main effects that controls the

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.550 
your main effects that controls the
amount<00:05:18.890> of<00:05:19.220> X<00:05:19.520> that<00:05:20.150> go<00:05:20.419> into<00:05:20.630> the<00:05:20.930> full<00:05:21.229> system

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:21.560 
amount of X that go into the full system

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.700 
amount of X that go into the full system
not<00:05:22.010> just<00:05:22.370> one<00:05:22.610> channel<00:05:23.120> then<00:05:23.990> you<00:05:24.020> have<00:05:24.380> right

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:24.710 
not just one channel then you have right

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:27.279 
not just one channel then you have right
here<00:05:25.100> below<00:05:25.490> this<00:05:25.760> there's<00:05:26.510> an<00:05:26.660> mp3<00:05:26.990> player

00:05:27.279 --> 00:05:27.289 
here below this there's an mp3 player

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:29.080 
here below this there's an mp3 player
section<00:05:28.160> so<00:05:28.310> let's<00:05:28.490> say<00:05:28.610> you<00:05:28.669> have<00:05:28.850> a<00:05:28.910> thumb

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.090 
section so let's say you have a thumb

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:31.230 
section so let's say you have a thumb
drive<00:05:29.300> with<00:05:29.539> a<00:05:29.630> bunch<00:05:29.810> of<00:05:29.930> DJ<00:05:30.260> music<00:05:30.620> on<00:05:30.740> it

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:31.240 
drive with a bunch of DJ music on it

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.600 
drive with a bunch of DJ music on it
you<00:05:31.330> pop<00:05:31.599> that<00:05:31.870> in<00:05:32.050> there<00:05:32.259> now<00:05:32.949> you<00:05:33.009> could<00:05:33.370> play

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:33.610 
you pop that in there now you could play

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:37.260 
you pop that in there now you could play
any<00:05:34.479> of<00:05:34.720> the<00:05:34.810> songs<00:05:35.080> off<00:05:35.380> there<00:05:36.090> you<00:05:37.090> have<00:05:37.240> a

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:37.270 
any of the songs off there you have a

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.689 
any of the songs off there you have a
tape<00:05:37.539> out<00:05:37.810> which<00:05:38.530> could<00:05:38.800> potentially<00:05:39.340> be<00:05:39.460> used

00:05:39.689 --> 00:05:39.699 
tape out which could potentially be used

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:41.939 
tape out which could potentially be used
as<00:05:39.940> a<00:05:39.970> recorder<00:05:40.630> so<00:05:41.199> let's<00:05:41.410> say<00:05:41.530> he<00:05:41.590> wants<00:05:41.860> to

00:05:41.939 --> 00:05:41.949 
as a recorder so let's say he wants to

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:44.249 
as a recorder so let's say he wants to
get<00:05:42.069> a<00:05:42.099> recorder<00:05:42.550> record<00:05:42.910> singers<00:05:43.360> he<00:05:44.080> could

00:05:44.249 --> 00:05:44.259 
get a recorder record singers he could

00:05:44.259 --> 00:05:48.390 
get a recorder record singers he could
do<00:05:44.440> that<00:05:45.270> then<00:05:46.270> you<00:05:46.479> have<00:05:46.830> these<00:05:47.830> are<00:05:48.099> your

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:48.400 
do that then you have these are your

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:49.770 
do that then you have these are your
effects<00:05:48.759> returned<00:05:49.180> that's<00:05:49.449> if<00:05:49.569> you<00:05:49.660> have

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:49.780 
effects returned that's if you have

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:52.999 
effects returned that's if you have
external<00:05:50.139> effects<00:05:50.860> processors<00:05:51.580> and<00:05:51.789> so<00:05:51.940> forth

00:05:52.999 --> 00:05:53.009 
external effects processors and so forth

00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:57.960 
external effects processors and so forth
and<00:05:54.300> what<00:05:55.300> we're<00:05:55.449> gonna<00:05:55.539> do<00:05:55.810> is<00:05:56.110> and<00:05:56.889> and<00:05:57.190> what

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:45.630 
things we tell people to do if you start

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:47.720

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:47.730 
doing more DJ work is to add a nice

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:50.490 
powered sub with this type of system I

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:53.300 
powered sub with this type of system I
would<00:06:50.970> recommend<00:06:51.600> a<00:06:51.660> powered<00:06:52.050> 12<00:06:52.470> inch<00:06:52.680> sub<00:06:52.980> to

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:53.310 
would recommend a powered 12 inch sub to

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:55.460 
would recommend a powered 12 inch sub to
a<00:06:53.340> 15<00:06:53.850> inch<00:06:53.880> sub<00:06:54.270> of<00:06:54.480> course<00:06:54.960> you<00:06:55.140> could<00:06:55.290> get<00:06:55.350> an

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:55.470 
a 15 inch sub of course you could get an

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:58.400 
a 15 inch sub of course you could get an
18<00:06:55.920> but<00:06:56.850> you<00:06:56.880> want<00:06:57.270> to<00:06:57.390> try<00:06:57.570> to<00:06:57.630> balance<00:06:57.930> it<00:06:58.260> out

00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:58.410 
18 but you want to try to balance it out

00:06:58.410 --> 00:06:59.810 
18 but you want to try to balance it out
better<00:06:58.740> if<00:06:58.920> this<00:06:59.100> was<00:06:59.310> a<00:06:59.340> more<00:06:59.610> powerful

00:06:59.810 --> 00:06:59.820 
better if this was a more powerful

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:03.340 
better if this was a more powerful
system<00:07:00.530> then<00:07:01.530> you<00:07:01.740> would<00:07:01.890> be<00:07:02.040> able<00:07:02.190> to<00:07:02.370> go<00:07:02.850> with

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:03.350 
system then you would be able to go with

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:07.280 
system then you would be able to go with
with<00:07:04.350> larger<00:07:04.980> sound<00:07:05.280> as<00:07:05.670> far<00:07:06.000> as<00:07:06.180> your<00:07:06.960> base

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:07.290 
with larger sound as far as your base

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:08.960 
with larger sound as far as your base
and<00:07:07.620> so<00:07:07.770> forth<00:07:08.130> and<00:07:08.250> then<00:07:08.400> you<00:07:08.520> can<00:07:08.700> also

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:08.970 
and so forth and then you can also

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:12.350 
and so forth and then you can also
expand<00:07:09.690> the<00:07:09.870> system<00:07:10.290> to<00:07:11.010> add<00:07:11.160> more<00:07:11.700> speakers

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:12.360 
expand the system to add more speakers

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:15.230 
expand the system to add more speakers
if<00:07:12.630> you<00:07:12.870> buy<00:07:13.080> powered<00:07:13.740> speakers<00:07:14.220> meaning<00:07:14.640> the

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:15.240 
if you buy powered speakers meaning the

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.050 
if you buy powered speakers meaning the
speakers<00:07:15.600> that<00:07:15.630> have<00:07:15.900> the<00:07:16.080> built-in

speakers that have the built-in
amplifiers<00:07:18.060> and<00:07:18.330> that's<00:07:18.480> how<00:07:18.630> you<00:07:18.690> can<00:07:18.990> expand

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:19.350 
amplifiers and that's how you can expand

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:22.490 
amplifiers and that's how you can expand
the<00:07:19.500> system<00:07:19.830> to<00:07:20.220> have<00:07:20.430> more<00:07:21.390> sound<00:07:21.810> and<00:07:22.170> going

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:22.500 
the system to have more sound and going

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:25.310 
the system to have more sound and going

say<00:07:25.530> he<00:07:25.710> wants<00:07:25.860> to<00:07:26.100> add<00:07:26.220> another<00:07:26.490> set<00:07:26.790> of<00:07:26.820> these

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:27.060 
say he wants to add another set of these

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:30.080 
say he wants to add another set of these
he<00:07:27.870> could<00:07:28.050> switch<00:07:28.350> out<00:07:28.560> those<00:07:28.860> XLR<00:07:29.400> cables<00:07:29.850> go

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:30.090 
he could switch out those XLR cables go

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:32.720 
he could switch out those XLR cables go
with<00:07:30.270> the<00:07:30.390> single<00:07:30.810> patch<00:07:30.990> cable<00:07:31.560> and<00:07:31.740> run<00:07:32.370> two

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:34.370 
with the single patch cable and run two
off<00:07:33.030> of<00:07:33.270> one<00:07:33.510> channel<00:07:33.960> so<00:07:34.080> he<00:07:34.200> could

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:34.380 
off of one channel so he could

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:37.210 
off of one channel so he could
potentially<00:07:34.920> run<00:07:36.080> two-four-six-eight

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:37.220

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:44.190 
on how he sets it up so that's pretty

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:47.990
