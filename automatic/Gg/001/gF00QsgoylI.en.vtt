00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
can twist the lens on in this case I'm

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.100 
can twist the lens on in this case I'm
going<00:01:59.430> to<00:01:59.549> be<00:01:59.670> twisting<00:02:00.149> it<00:02:00.329> twisting<00:02:00.930> the

camera on the lens onto the camera
clockwise<00:02:04.710> so<00:02:05.520> what<00:02:05.640> I'm<00:02:05.700> going<00:02:05.790> to<00:02:05.850> do<00:02:05.969> is

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
clockwise so what I'm going to do is

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.499 
clockwise so what I'm going to do is
line<00:02:06.540> up<00:02:06.750> those<00:02:06.930> two<00:02:07.200> red<00:02:07.409> dots

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
and you don't need to press hard it

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.979 
and you don't need to press hard it
should<00:02:18.500> slide<00:02:19.500> in<00:02:19.680> there<00:02:19.830> pretty<00:02:20.010> easily<00:02:20.989> once

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
should slide in there pretty easily once

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:23.930 
should slide in there pretty easily once
the<00:02:22.200> lens<00:02:22.409> stops<00:02:22.830> it's<00:02:23.159> locked<00:02:23.459> in<00:02:23.640> there<00:02:23.819> and

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
the lens stops it's locked in there and

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.259 
the lens stops it's locked in there and
you<00:02:24.000> can't<00:02:24.269> twist<00:02:24.510> it<00:02:24.750> anyway<00:02:25.670> it's<00:02:26.670> just<00:02:26.849> it's

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
you can't twist it anyway it's just it's
