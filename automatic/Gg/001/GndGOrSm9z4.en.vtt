00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.120 
control tower on the control room so I

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.910 
control tower on the control room so I
hope<00:00:35.270> you<00:00:35.480> enjoyed<00:00:35.900> this<00:00:36.140> week's<00:00:36.410> episode

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:38.710 
first hanger and if I sprint over to the

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:40.920 
first hanger and if I sprint over to the
other<00:02:38.890> one<00:02:39.160> you've<00:02:39.670> got<00:02:39.940> another<00:02:40.240> hanger<00:02:40.720> with

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
other one you've got another hanger with

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.810 
other one you've got another hanger with
a<00:02:40.960> space<00:02:41.470> ship<00:02:41.710> floating<00:02:42.160> inside<00:02:42.280> it<00:02:42.610> you<00:02:42.760> have

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820 
a space ship floating inside it you have

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.930 
a space ship floating inside it you have
this<00:02:43.060> rail<00:02:43.390> system<00:02:43.990> that<00:02:44.650> goes<00:02:44.890> all<00:02:45.310> the<00:02:45.370> way

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
this rail system that goes all the way

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.580 
this rail system that goes all the way
to<00:02:46.330> Dale<00:02:47.490> landing<00:02:48.490> strip<00:02:48.880> and<00:02:49.150> basically<00:02:49.930> here

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
to Dale landing strip and basically here

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.130 
to Dale landing strip and basically here
is<00:02:50.710> where<00:02:50.920> the<00:02:51.210> ships<00:02:52.210> would<00:02:52.420> be<00:02:52.570> transported

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
is where the ships would be transported

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.320 
is where the ships would be transported
either<00:02:53.260> to<00:02:53.590> take<00:02:53.770> off<00:02:54.010> or<00:02:54.370> if<00:02:54.640> they<00:02:54.760> landed<00:02:55.150> to

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
either to take off or if they landed to

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.440 
either to take off or if they landed to
be<00:02:55.690> transported<00:02:56.200> into<00:02:56.560> the<00:02:56.710> hangars<00:02:57.270> so<00:02:58.270> yeah

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
be transported into the hangars so yeah

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.330 
be transported into the hangars so yeah
this<00:02:59.050> is<00:02:59.170> pretty<00:02:59.290> much<00:02:59.410> it<00:02:59.530> for<00:02:59.740> the<00:02:59.980> hangars

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340
