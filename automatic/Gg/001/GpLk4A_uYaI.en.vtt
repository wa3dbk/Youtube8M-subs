the studs like so another thing I did

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:10.420 
the studs like so another thing I did
pretty<00:04:09.260> much<00:04:09.320> all<00:04:09.560> over<00:04:09.590> this<00:04:09.890> figure<00:04:10.220> was

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
pretty much all over this figure was

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.420 
pretty much all over this figure was
applied<00:04:11.030> a<00:04:11.270> washed<00:04:11.810> every<00:04:12.440> little<00:04:12.650> indent<00:04:13.190> so

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
applied a washed every little indent so

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.250 
applied a washed every little indent so
it<00:04:13.640> kind<00:04:13.850> of<00:04:13.940> shades<00:04:14.330> inside<00:04:14.720> that<00:04:14.930> so<00:04:15.050> you<00:04:15.110> can

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
it kind of shades inside that so you can

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.690 
it kind of shades inside that so you can
see<00:04:15.940> there<00:04:16.940> and<00:04:17.270> and<00:04:18.040> where<00:04:19.040> the<00:04:19.160> feet<00:04:19.400> turns

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700
