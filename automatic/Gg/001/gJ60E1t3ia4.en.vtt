00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:07.279
 in the jalapeno stadium while some 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.959
 athletes prepare subtract hug each other 

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:10.820
 others compete in the various 

00:00:08.959 --> 00:00:13.639
 track and field tests that some 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:16.190
 they think of the jalapeÃ±o climate environment that 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:20.510
 has welcomed us with a pretty climate 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:21.950
 different wind cold rain heat but 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.810
 of course the smile of the people 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.490
 Veracruz has always been in its 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.160
 faces and attention has been unequaled 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.960
 It's kind of weird because you change all the 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:34.070
 hot the next day 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.070
 well, rain 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:38.489
 and weather a bit bad because we are 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.790
 accustomed to the climate of Cuba that is 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:47.010
 pretty sun a lot of heat but good 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:48.269
 quite the weather I did not like much anymore 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.699
 that we come from a very climate 

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:52.739
 different has affected us a bit but 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:55.890
 Well, we've been two weeks 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.500
 we hope that they will not do us then 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.470
 damage already for the competitions but if the 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.420
 weather we are we are little and 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:06.810
 we like the heat we do not like the cold 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.830
 but the structure everything is excellent 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:13.380
 food in the hotel attention 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:18.060
 if it is spectacular of my country what 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:21.300
 strange foreign object of the country 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.850
 the heat we miss the heat there that 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.500
 Colombia in the area where we live makes 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:30.210
 a lot of heat 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:33.180
 we are from antioquia i am also a pitcher 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:36.300
 of javelin four years ago I went 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:39.510
 champion in the javelin of the games 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:44.040
 Central American MayagÃ¼ez 2010 and good 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:45.840
 I come here to sanitation and title the 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.890
 athletes and some delegations that 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.630
 compete in these games 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.760
 Central Americans thought of the 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.030
 organization of the fair and the public 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:56.010
 who attends the various scenarios 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.810
 everything is very well organized I think 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:00.030
 they have done their best to 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.240
 the games are a success and we 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:06.000
 enjoying the enough accompaniment already 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.860
 that athletics is not a sport 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.800
 is that it attracts a lot of attention but 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.720
 we have brought an accompaniment 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.560
 and the stage is also its 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.280
 spectacular 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:20.620
 with the support of the public so far 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.670
 has been very good despite the 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.400
 rivalry that has is going with me 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.450
 this has been to the public has been quite 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.690
 benevolent with us and has supported us 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.489
 very good the truth is that very pretty 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.569
 the city the organization everything has been 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:37.760
 very good and quite nice indeed 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:40.740
 of riding here in effective of 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:43.410
 effectiveness what happened 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:45.630
 families also talked about the 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.640
 food that was served to them and what 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.910
 have missed your country during your 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:54.170
 Stay in Mexico if the food but not 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.430
 he invited me to take tequila but good 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.610
 you have to try tequila de mexico for 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.610
 to know 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.110
 what you have eaten me is the ear 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.269
 I do not know what he gives me just that we have not 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:13.790
 could with the spicy but the food 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:16.459
 Mexican very rich when we arrived 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:19.519
 we had the doubt that if we are going to eat 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:21.319
 a lot of spicy food and they really have 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:24.230
 prepared with gastronomy for 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:26.390
 offer us various different dishes to 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.860
 like to the taste of all visitors 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:29.870
 we have not eaten so much 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.840
 Spicy food good of course not 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.940
 we peel the Mexican tacos the 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.709
 burritos of course at the hotel we 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.510
 they give a lot and they are very rich and very 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:40.670
 tasty really not the food 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.799
 spectacular at least we have a 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.110
 generic food that is for everyone 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:48.790
 sports people because at least 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.790
 I can not eat spicy 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:55.440
 the food well drink well 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.799
 we have not had problems that the only thing 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.209
 the changing weather what we miss most 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:04.049
 We eat venezuela food of course 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:05.700
 the arepa with diablito and others also 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:07.980
 They talked about the places they could 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.959
 visit in veracruz and did not waste 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.409
 the occasion to send a message to the 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:16.049
 young people to get closer to sports 

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:17.870
 we met the museum the aquarium we swim 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:20.669
 with sharks we swim with the dolphins 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.320
 We met all the part of the boardwalk and 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:24.419
 soon we will be going towards what 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.250
 which are the pyramids that are quite 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:27.780
 known here in mexico I think that 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.510
 we all come to compete and after the 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.949
 competition so there is still time we go out to 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:34.889
 know a little but I think that time 

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:36.570
 it's because we compete on the 28th and the 29th 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:40.720
 we go then we have not had the 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:43.120
 opportunity to know how strange everything 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.800
 We are very happy in Mexico but the 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.020
 truth is that we want to return to 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:50.170
 our country after having done very 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:52.750
 good role as the lakes some chair 

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:54.820
 of the center thus an education 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.890
 when you enter the sports field and 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:59.170
 you fix your life a lot and they take you out 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:02.260
 of all lived all habits 

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:04.180
 bad guys that could that can they can 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:06.529
 be happening now not only the 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:09.109
 Mexicans from all over the world 

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:10.810
 so that they come that they look and that they take out 

00:05:09.109 --> 00:05:13.660
 your test conclusions 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:17.139
 and I said such a August when a very greeting 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:19.690
 special to all young people who 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:21.280
 involve with sport no matter what 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:23.590
 be the athletics or any sport is 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:26.200
 good in such a way that you see them for it 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.820
 get out of many inconveniences of being 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:30.130
 away from a lot of violence many 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:31.330
 problematic type situations 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:33.620
 social that are in different 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:35.810
 countries 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:38.860
 reported for the political heat tv
