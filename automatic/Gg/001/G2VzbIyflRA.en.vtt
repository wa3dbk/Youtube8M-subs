00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:17.119 

first<00:03:13.739> thing<00:03:14.010> is<00:03:14.430> to<00:03:14.819> remove<00:03:15.830> the<00:03:16.830> shift

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:17.129

00:04:13.399 --> 00:04:13.409 
need to put a rod on the end of this to

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:20.800 
need to put a rod on the end of this to
braid<00:04:14.689> when<00:04:15.689> you<00:04:15.810> get<00:04:16.019> that<00:04:16.199> out

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.840 

you'll<00:04:21.810> never<00:04:22.019> will<00:04:23.010> be<00:04:23.190> able<00:04:23.340> to<00:04:23.430> move<00:04:23.550> from

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
you'll never will be able to move from

you'll never will be able to move from
side<00:04:24.150> to<00:04:24.180> side

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.650 

now<00:04:34.400> we've<00:04:34.550> got<00:04:34.729> the<00:04:34.880> tightening<00:04:35.270> bolt<00:04:35.449> out<00:04:35.630> of

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
now we've got the tightening bolt out of

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:36.100 
now we've got the tightening bolt out of
the<00:04:35.780> star

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
the star

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.600 
the star
we<00:04:36.919> want<00:04:37.159> to<00:04:37.220> see<00:04:37.340> just<00:04:37.580> how<00:04:37.639> loose<00:04:37.970> it<00:04:38.180> is<00:04:39.610> this

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
we want to see just how loose it is this

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:44.879 
we want to see just how loose it is this
one's<00:04:40.849> pretty<00:04:41.060> loose<00:04:41.360> is<00:04:41.539> pretty<00:04:41.810> strict

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:44.889 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:47.830 

let's<00:04:45.889> see<00:04:46.099> if<00:04:46.219> it<00:04:46.340> will<00:04:46.460> lay<00:04:46.610> down<00:04:46.840> horizontal

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 
let's see if it will lay down horizontal

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.490 
let's see if it will lay down horizontal
if<00:04:48.710> it<00:04:48.889> will<00:04:49.009> fall<00:04:49.219> no<00:04:49.430> more<00:04:49.669> horizontally

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
if it will fall no more horizontally

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.839 
if it will fall no more horizontally
then<00:04:51.500> we're<00:04:51.770> simply<00:04:51.979> going<00:04:52.280> to<00:04:52.340> cut<00:04:52.610> right

00:04:52.839 --> 00:04:52.849 
then we're simply going to cut right

00:04:52.849 --> 00:05:02.629 
then we're simply going to cut right
across<00:04:53.150> the<00:04:53.449> top<00:04:53.719> here<00:04:54.280> yeah<00:04:55.280> this<00:04:55.610> one<00:04:55.819> will

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:02.639 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:04.529 

all<00:05:03.639> right<00:05:03.789> now<00:05:03.939> we're<00:05:04.090> going<00:05:04.240> to<00:05:04.300> cut<00:05:04.419> the

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:04.539 
all right now we're going to cut the

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:07.050 
all right now we're going to cut the
lever<00:05:04.749> off<00:05:04.990> as<00:05:05.680> I<00:05:05.710> mentioned<00:05:06.310> to<00:05:06.430> use<00:05:06.550> a<00:05:06.580> rotary

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.060 
lever off as I mentioned to use a rotary

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:36.750 
lever off as I mentioned to use a rotary
tool<00:05:07.180> with<00:05:08.080> a<00:05:08.110> flex<00:05:08.499> shaft

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:36.760 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:52.200 

Oh

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:52.210 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:54.369 

now<00:05:53.210> you've<00:05:53.389> noticed<00:05:53.419> that<00:05:53.780> the<00:05:53.990> wheel<00:05:54.169> is

00:05:54.369 --> 00:05:54.379 
now you've noticed that the wheel is

00:05:54.379 --> 00:05:56.260 
now you've noticed that the wheel is
ground<00:05:54.680> down<00:05:54.800> in<00:05:55.069> size<00:05:55.340> when<00:05:55.639> it<00:05:55.789> gets<00:05:55.909> smaller

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:56.270 
ground down in size when it gets smaller

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:59.379 
ground down in size when it gets smaller
like<00:05:56.539> this<00:05:56.569> you<00:05:57.530> can<00:05:57.740> go<00:05:58.729> down<00:05:58.909> there<00:05:59.090> deeper

00:05:59.379 --> 00:05:59.389 
like this you can go down there deeper

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:01.179 
like this you can go down there deeper
with<00:05:59.539> more<00:05:59.719> confidence<00:06:00.020> if<00:06:00.469> you<00:06:00.590> touch<00:06:00.889> the

00:06:01.179 --> 00:06:01.189 
with more confidence if you touch the

00:06:01.189 --> 00:06:03.399 
with more confidence if you touch the
shaft<00:06:01.490> a<00:06:01.729> couple<00:06:02.029> of<00:06:02.090> times<00:06:02.360> don't<00:06:03.110> worry

00:06:03.399 --> 00:06:03.409 
shaft a couple of times don't worry

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:05.260 
shaft a couple of times don't worry
about<00:06:03.560> the<00:06:03.860> better<00:06:04.069> level<00:06:04.400> of<00:06:04.490> grip<00:06:04.669> of<00:06:04.999> course

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:05.270 
about the better level of grip of course

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:07.929 
about the better level of grip of course
you<00:06:05.389> want<00:06:05.599> to<00:06:05.659> avoid<00:06:05.960> that<00:06:06.310> at<00:06:07.310> this<00:06:07.490> point<00:06:07.819> I'm

00:06:07.929 --> 00:06:07.939 
you want to avoid that at this point I'm

00:06:07.939 --> 00:06:15.720 
you want to avoid that at this point I'm
going<00:06:08.029> to<00:06:08.090> put<00:06:08.270> this<00:06:08.389> wooden<00:06:08.689> wedge<00:06:08.990> in<00:06:09.229> here

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:15.730 

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:17.730 

now<00:06:16.570> what<00:06:16.750> this<00:06:16.930> is<00:06:16.990> going<00:06:17.200> to<00:06:17.350> do<00:06:17.530> when<00:06:17.710> you

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:17.740 
now what this is going to do when you

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:20.100 
now what this is going to do when you
have<00:06:17.920> your<00:06:18.100> differential<00:06:18.820> here<00:06:19.060> is<00:06:19.240> it<00:06:20.020> will

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:20.110 
have your differential here is it will

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:21.540 
have your differential here is it will
force<00:06:20.350> this<00:06:20.530> up<00:06:20.710> against<00:06:21.010> the<00:06:21.160> side<00:06:21.370> of<00:06:21.490> the

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:21.550 
force this up against the side of the

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:23.400 
force this up against the side of the
differential<00:06:22.000> it<00:06:22.660> will<00:06:22.780> make<00:06:22.930> it<00:06:23.050> easier<00:06:23.380> for

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:23.410 
differential it will make it easier for

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:43.080 
differential it will make it easier for
you<00:06:23.680> to<00:06:23.710> cut<00:06:23.980> the<00:06:24.280> rest<00:06:24.700> of<00:06:24.880> it<00:06:25.000> off

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:43.090 

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:51.110 

well<00:06:43.930> let's<00:06:44.200> see<00:06:44.380> if<00:06:44.500> it'll<00:06:44.680> pop<00:06:44.889> apart<00:06:45.310> you

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.120 

00:06:51.120 --> 00:07:10.999 

know<00:06:52.120> she<00:06:52.510> needs<00:06:52.690> some<00:06:52.900> more

00:07:10.999 --> 00:07:11.009 

00:07:11.009 --> 00:07:14.879 

now<00:07:12.009> that<00:07:12.250> we've<00:07:12.370> cut<00:07:13.229> put<00:07:14.229> a<00:07:14.259> deep<00:07:14.500> on<00:07:14.740> this

00:07:14.879 --> 00:07:14.889 
now that we've cut put a deep on this

00:07:14.889 --> 00:07:16.379 
now that we've cut put a deep on this
let's<00:07:15.130> see<00:07:15.280> if<00:07:15.340> we<00:07:15.460> could<00:07:15.610> pop<00:07:15.789> it<00:07:15.970> apart<00:07:16.210> with

00:07:16.379 --> 00:07:16.389 
let's see if we could pop it apart with

00:07:16.389 --> 00:07:18.719 
let's see if we could pop it apart with
