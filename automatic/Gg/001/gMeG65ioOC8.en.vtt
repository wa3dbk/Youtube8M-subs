00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:08.360
 in this last quarter of this program 

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:11.269
 the only basic analysis program 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:13.460
 puts in our country and I think there 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:18.380
 to touch a relevant topic that is going to be 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:21.020
 Well, something fundamental from here to August 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.880
 that kicks off the World Cup and it's about 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.220
 our national team now 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.809
 worried because gustavo ayon announces 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.640
 it's not going to be in the world cup because of its 

00:00:26.809 --> 00:00:30.469
 shoulder injury and on the other hand 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.719
 Gutierrez said he is breaking it with 

00:00:30.469 --> 00:00:34.640
 the team of the nets un jorge gutiérrez 

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:35.960
 that has had minutes that gives two points 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.550
 and that he is also seen with a lot 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.830
 character within the team of the mets and 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.140
 this is the great surprise of this year 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:44.150
 jorge gutiérrez who did good is 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.000
 doing everything but the first contract 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:49.940
 of 10 days waiting for another contract of 10 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.430
 days and in the nba they ask you then to 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.710
 third contract is no longer 10 days that 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.750
 give them a contract whether or not they give good 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.820
 a contract does not know under what terms 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.770
 still however good gutierrez is 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.540
 making a great season with the nets 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.790
 from brooklyn because he is doing 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.830
 assists you're in the rebounds is 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.630
 making points and doing minutes 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.390
 It does not matter 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:14.880
 so much for the nba in his team we 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:17.080
 as Mexicans and also what it is for 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.090
 be 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.450
 being the holder within the world 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:24.310
 back in Spain 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.410
 I worry first how the 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:29.200
 things televise it in a program 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:31.870
 morning radio the man says he's going to 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.700
 play announces it I do not know if they took him out 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.680
 the response that journalists wanted 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.150
 I said possibly gustavo have 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.400
 been speaking in the interview to 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.200
 so that this was made known in the 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.420
 official twitter account or in your 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.310
 official page nor the team of atlanta 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.940
 has observed no official cut 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.190
 declared is in spain 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:53.010
 there's a lot of controversy about it 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:55.290
 that yes it is clear is that it was operated has 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:58.170
 have to carry a qualification period and 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.060
 I hardly believe him to be him 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.980
 is the determining factor thanks to 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.780
 gustavo ayón went to the world we go to 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:06.210
 world for me is a player 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.710
 irreplaceable what he did within 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:12.880
 the court was to unite 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:14.410
 support Mexicans he was the emblem and 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.420
 when the thing got difficult to 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.250
 get me the ball that I solve it 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:22.240
 we have a player those characteristics 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.800
 Gutierrez has a lot of skill but the 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.460
 is doing in the nba because it's a 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.990
 latino player and mexicans in mexican 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:32.200
 son we overlap to all we are 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:35.260
 excellent dogs for defense if and 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.500
 if we can not we steal it from these 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.550
 robbery statistics and so on that's 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.250
 Indiosincracia that type of basketball 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:44.290
 of the Mexican if it adapts to the unit yes 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.600
 and has fought and is coming in the league 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:49.390
 development and from there they pulled it had a 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.490
 excellent premundial tournament but I do know 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.040
 that he is an indisputable title but not 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:55.480
 I have to conceal myself in the world that 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.460
 makes the properties of mexico to me 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.680
 way of seeing I say dominoes of merit 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:03.130
 gutierrez of many who are going to go and who 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:07.960
 they won their place but that that titan 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:09.340
 that gear that pivot that piston of 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.850
 the Mexican team is not going to 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.200
 to have 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.460
 but if you were in the coaching staff 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.360
 by sergio valdeomillos estar 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:17.470
 carefree 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:19.870
 the truth yes because as beto says 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.480
 ayón is the bastion of the selection 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.700
 Mexican and not only within the 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.680
 it hurt I was seeing it in the bank 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:30.070
 when they played in the state of mexico 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:32.170
 before going to the premundial and I had 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:34.180
 words for paul stoll in the sense 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:37.840
 of having quiet is a match 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:40.240
 have fun relax do not press ok 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.340
 this he understood the next time 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.170
 came in he did things right and in his 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.350
 moment is also put to you by you 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:49.270
 a big man goes to Mr. Lorenzo 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:51.640
 quiet and sit down but not calm and 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:54.400
 sit down and Lorenzo kills that picture with 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.260
 ayón sat down he calmed down and in the end 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.420
 nothing happened but there was a small 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.820
 art altercation between mata and paul stoll 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.560
 that there the only one who could be 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:06.070
 put to calm it was gustavo 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.600
 ayón and I tell them if I had been the 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:10.270
 I would have thought more than twice for 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:12.700
 to be able to do that with kill I think I do not know 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:13.460
 because I feel like he hit 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.389
 media 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:18.069
 what is a value? 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:20.100
 you will meet him in an interview 

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:23.070
 radio you do not do it officially 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:25.290
 you have time to recover from hours 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.750
 for nothing but it's falcao talking about 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:30.450
 football dying could world with 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:34.110
 colombia you think you like water 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:36.660
 york as it is not going to be killing 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.550
 in the staves of the Canary Islands for our 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.620
 country do not believe that it is a way of 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.480
 keep communication babies that 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.640
 talk about me I have not left I am the 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:47.220
 handsome here has got me look up 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:48.810
 It can be that but it can also be the 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.520
 another part is a lesson that has 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:52.740
 been giving the carving of time ago 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:55.500
 today but all are edges and brenda years 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.360
 If I exaggerate if you do not take care of yourself, you may not 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.010
 go do not even even participate 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.960
 in the next selective cycle of 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:05.220
 next world because of that injury that is not 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:08.000
 He took good care to do an investigation on 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:08.000
 the shoulder 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:13.110
 accounting for the six months he 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:17.300
 He said they were missing for rehabilitation 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:17.300
 it would end with September annals 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:22.600
 you put me in intrigues with that of the coup 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:24.070
 I like the idea of the media 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.870
 believe in it but also there 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:27.040
 we would have to see a specialist for 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.240
 that really tell us what the 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.670
 lesson of it 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:34.150
 whether really recoverable or not and also 

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:36.490
 if maybe that is that media role 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:40.180
 that you that you name is also for 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:42.190
 look for another way another beyond is not 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:49.330
 irreplaceable that we are all 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:51.700
 agreement with that is institute and bleu but 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:55.080
 if I would be interested to see the impact that 

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:58.120
 generates now with the group with the coach 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:00.250
 because hormones is a way of saying yes 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:03.040
 but he has a very sure that nba 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:04.990
 not everyone covers it that's also a 

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:07.240
 subject that our 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:09.600
 authorities now to gustavo ayón was 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.600
 going 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:14.490
 safe 

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:20.710
 Argentina to the two when with their 

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:22.300
 selection the only one who did not want to play and 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:25.180
 for political reasons to the papers 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:27.690
 messages was was about this subject of 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:30.010
 policy issue but it does not have 

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:33.940
 international policy and 

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:35.170
 nationalism in that role I think not 

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:37.950
 was from the soul as what 

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:37.950
 we saw in caracas 

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:47.770
 that can not be recovered within the 

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:50.380
 state staff valdeolmillos said so 

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:52.600
 after having won in caracas part 

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:55.000
 that Mexican players grabbed 

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:58.120
 the system wave that I brought was 

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:01.150
 gustavo already totally then it's going to 

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:02.890
 be there play or not play there and I 

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:05.490
 I bet if he plays I also think 

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:05.490
 that is a media hit 

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:22.600
 thanks to all of us who 

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:27.900
 please do we are we are now bàsquet 

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:30.900
 and I thank you for your attention. 

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:30.900
 make it 

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:45.169
 to 

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:49.880
 ah
