00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 Speak up today, let's talk about a 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:08.040
 of the thinnest smartphones on the market 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.469
 I'm talking about the xperia t3 he has 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:14.389
 only seven millimeters thick 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.389
 then release the sticker and 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.720
 Good guys, let's start with 

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.160
 xperia t3 design né 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.920
 is the great decoy to which the great 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.110
 differential it has only seven 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.480
 thickness and is one of the 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.489
 thinnest smartphones on the market today 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.640
 You're seeing some gadgets here. 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:45.300
 and its thickness t3 only loses to the 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:49.020
 iphone 6 that has 6.9 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.840
 he has and 148 grams his finish it 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.600
 brings edges here in stainless steel but 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.330
 It seems more plastic it right back 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.940
 and textured offers a better 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:02.339
 footprint without letting hands slip 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.320
 a missing detail on t3 is that it 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:06.000
 is not approved then and has not played in the 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.729
 swimming pool not talking a little bit about 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.760
 the connectors here on top of us 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.770
 we have the p2 to headphone side 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.130
 the appliance is 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:20.520
 here we have the cover that covers the micro 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.380
 sd and neither the micro sd batches and a slot 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.100
 for microsd sim 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:29.040
 here we have the power switch on control 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.320
 and the camera shutter release here 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.060
 below the bottom 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.410
 we have only one microphone here this is 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.500
 just for you to learn a little chain 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:39.570
 such on the left side we have a micro 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.920
 usb for both charging and 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.140
 make transfers 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.030
 here on your back we have to 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.930
 8 megapixel camera 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.800
 the led flash and here below the top 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.450
 speaker 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.480
 it is important to point out that it is not 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:02:02.040
 It is possible to remove the back cover. 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:05.640
 can access to hit it has 5.3 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:08.640
 inch hd resolution your panel ips 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.500
 or it offers a greater angle of vision 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.599
 You can see here does not lose as much 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.220
 quality of the color 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:17.519
 it also has mobile technology 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.560
 brava in two and three luminos that also 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:21.810
 offers an improvement in the quality of 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.030
 images of the colors what is really true 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.220
 we can see bright colors well 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.069
 here as you can check watch 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.319
 movies on a 5.3-inch screen is 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:33.359
 so cool, you will be able to watch the 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.990
 Serial your favorite movie on a good 

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:36.240
 works 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.640
 the screen is also nice even if 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.580
 You have very bright places you 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.080
 will be able to have a good view 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.750
 one thing we found a bit annoying 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.120
 does not inspire t3 is that it does not have 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.730
 protection against scratches and scratches 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.230
 be careful here with Chávez or even 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.560
 drop to the ground so as not to appear 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.930
 those unwanted risks over your 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:01.950
 keyboard it has a good size that both 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:03.870
 horizontally and vertically here and 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.270
 it also has white features 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.550
 also to facilitate typing and 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.590
 the android buttons they are part of the 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:13.260
 screen as you are seeing in some 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.480
 applications as games and even if they 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.940
 disappear so as not to disturb your 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.480
 experience during the game or even 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.480
 watch a movie 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:30.120
 the xperia t3 has a processor 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:33.330
 snapdragon 400 quad-core 1.4 ghz 1 gb of 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:36.900
 ram and adreno 305 gpu in the 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:40.230
 storage xperia t3 offers 8 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.970
 gigabytes but only 4.9 are 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:45.390
 available to the user what 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:47.280
 we consider it a bit low if you 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.030
 want to be more games or apps 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.580
 heavy 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:53.730
 you can even insert a 32 gb model 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:55.860
 the slot for MicroSD to but as I 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.530
 we speak and you already know only for 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:01.200
 music videos photos or documents in 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:06.030
 general anything your android apps 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:08.100
 is the kit kat 4.4.2 your interface you 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.720
 You see, it's quite custom here. 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:12.660
 né in the standard that the sony usually uses 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.460
 there are some quick shortcuts here where 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:17.100
 applications get that on the screen 

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:19.109
 running at the same time and can shut up 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.450
 You want but the performance is very good. 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:23.430
 if they can see here there are many 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:26.370
 applications open here cry no 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:28.170
 chokes fluidity here in the transition of 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:31.020
 screens is also very good so let's 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:34.140
 here some open a quick game 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:39.800
 he opened we closed let's rotate 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:39.800
 some games for example real racing 3 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:51.220
 You can see that the game is flowing. 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:52.390
 very well in the game also nice that we 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.870
 Let's turn here so you can see is the 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:54.870
 feedback 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:18.060
 and with clips here in high definition as 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.580
 for example that the shakira clip is 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:23.819
 playing is also flowing in a good without 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:26.190
 a choke and the sound also the sound is loud 

00:05:23.819 --> 00:05:28.289
 but as every smartphone is missing those 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:30.860
 serious as you are hearing in this 

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:30.860
 time 

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:46.849

00:07:11.959 --> 00:07:17.719
 the sony xperia t3 is a smartphone that 

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:21.289

00:07:17.719 --> 00:07:24.479
 5.3 inches by having connectivity

 accurate and for their excellent performance their 

00:07:24.479 --> 00:07:28.159
 negative points are due to your 

00:07:26.339 --> 00:07:31.529
 small internal storage space 

00:07:28.159 --> 00:07:32.399
 despite its small thickness of 7 

00:07:31.529 --> 00:07:34.770
 mm 

00:07:32.399 --> 00:07:37.770
