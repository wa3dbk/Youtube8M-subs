different varieties there's kind of the

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.759 
different varieties there's kind of the
good<00:00:43.149> which<00:00:43.930> is<00:00:44.050> kind<00:00:44.260> of<00:00:44.320> an<00:00:44.440> entry-level

00:00:44.759 --> 00:00:44.769 
good which is kind of an entry-level

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:46.920 
good which is kind of an entry-level
product<00:00:45.460> it<00:00:45.609> wears<00:00:45.850> into<00:00:46.329> the<00:00:46.449> existing

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:46.930 
product it wears into the existing

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.130 
product it wears into the existing
circuits<00:00:47.350> in<00:00:47.469> your<00:00:47.590> circuit<00:00:47.949> breaker<00:00:48.129> panel

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
circuits in your circuit breaker panel

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.990 
circuits in your circuit breaker panel
it's<00:00:50.140> limited<00:00:50.590> to<00:00:50.679> 15<00:00:51.039> and<00:00:51.190> 20<00:00:51.429> amp<00:00:51.579> circuits

it's limited to 15 and 20 amp circuits

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.650 
it's limited to 15 and 20 amp circuits
in<00:00:52.149> your<00:00:52.179> house<00:00:52.449> but<00:00:53.170> you<00:00:53.350> switch<00:00:54.539> from<00:00:55.539> the

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:55.660 
in your house but you switch from the

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.240 
in your house but you switch from the
utility<00:00:56.199> to<00:00:56.410> the<00:00:56.559> generator<00:00:57.010> and<00:00:57.160> you're

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.250 
utility to the generator and you're

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.549 
utility to the generator and you're
switching<00:00:57.519> individual<00:00:58.210> circuits<00:00:58.839> has<00:00:59.530> a

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
switching individual circuits has a

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:01.139 
switching individual circuits has a
power<00:00:59.800> Inlet<00:01:00.219> for<00:01:00.489> connecting<00:01:01.089> your

00:01:01.139 --> 00:01:01.149 
power Inlet for connecting your

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:03.270 
power Inlet for connecting your
generator<00:01:01.690> and<00:01:01.989> watt<00:01:02.199> meter<00:01:02.469> so<00:01:02.800> that<00:01:02.829> you<00:01:03.100> can

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280 
generator and watt meter so that you can

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.940 
generator and watt meter so that you can
look<00:01:03.460> at<00:01:04.019> balancing<00:01:05.019> your<00:01:05.260> load<00:01:05.500> on<00:01:05.800> your

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:05.950 
look at balancing your load on your

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.100 
look at balancing your load on your
generator<00:01:06.430> so<00:01:06.760> it's<00:01:07.270> kind<00:01:07.510> of<00:01:07.540> like<00:01:07.690> if<00:01:07.900> you

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
generator so it's kind of like if you

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.440 
generator so it's kind of like if you
are<00:01:08.710> walking<00:01:08.920> around<00:01:09.159> on<00:01:09.430> one<00:01:09.700> shoe<00:01:10.000> instead

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
are walking around on one shoe instead

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.360 
are walking around on one shoe instead
of<00:01:10.600> the<00:01:10.720> pair<00:01:10.990> you're<00:01:11.530> going<00:01:11.650> to<00:01:11.740> wear<00:01:11.920> out<00:01:11.950> one

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:12.370 
of the pair you're going to wear out one

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.210 
of the pair you're going to wear out one
before<00:01:13.030> the<00:01:13.180> other<00:01:13.210> so<00:01:13.660> looking<00:01:14.200> at<00:01:14.320> your<00:01:14.530> your

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220 
before the other so looking at your your

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.890 
before the other so looking at your your
watt<00:01:15.430> meters<00:01:15.850> to<00:01:16.060> make<00:01:16.210> sure<00:01:16.390> that<00:01:16.570> your<00:01:16.690> power

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:16.900 
watt meters to make sure that your power

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.840 
watt meters to make sure that your power
is<00:01:17.200> balanced<00:01:17.800> and<00:01:17.920> that<00:01:18.070> you're<00:01:18.250> using<00:01:18.490> the

manual transfer switch line same
principle<00:02:40.290> as<00:02:40.470> the<00:02:40.680> previous<00:02:41.100> one<00:02:41.400> but<00:02:41.430> in<00:02:41.880> the

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
principle as the previous one but in the

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.080 
principle as the previous one but in the
same<00:02:42.540> interlock<00:02:43.160> where<00:02:44.160> you<00:02:44.280> relocate<00:02:44.910> the

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
same interlock where you relocate the

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.759 
same interlock where you relocate the
circuits<00:02:45.480> from<00:02:45.690> your<00:02:45.840> main<00:02:45.989> panel<00:02:46.380> into<00:02:46.650> this

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
circuits from your main panel into this

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:49.069 
circuits from your main panel into this
as<00:02:47.010> a<00:02:47.040> sub<00:02:47.340> panel<00:02:47.730> and<00:02:47.910> then<00:02:48.420> you<00:02:48.450> switch<00:02:48.840> the

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:49.079 
as a sub panel and then you switch the

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:51.710 
as a sub panel and then you switch the
circuits<00:02:49.500> from<00:02:49.739> generator<00:02:50.519> from<00:02:51.030> utility<00:02:51.569> to

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
circuits from generator from utility to

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.620 
circuits from generator from utility to
the<00:02:51.840> generator<00:02:52.260> power<00:02:52.560> this<00:02:53.280> expands<00:02:53.880> to<00:02:54.030> 16

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
the generator power this expands to 16

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.839 
the generator power this expands to 16
circuits<00:02:55.220> so<00:02:56.220> it<00:02:56.280> gives<00:02:56.430> you<00:02:56.549> the<00:02:56.700> ultimate

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:56.849 
circuits so it gives you the ultimate

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:59.210 
circuits so it gives you the ultimate
and<00:02:57.329> flexibility<00:02:57.989> and<00:02:58.260> the<00:02:58.440> enclosure<00:02:58.859> is

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
and flexibility and the enclosure is

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.970 
and flexibility and the enclosure is
flush<00:03:00.180> or<00:03:00.420> surface<00:03:00.810> mountable<00:03:01.349> so<00:03:01.590> this<00:03:01.769> is

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
flush or surface mountable so this is

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.890 
flush or surface mountable so this is
wide<00:03:02.549> enough<00:03:02.700> to<00:03:02.970> fit<00:03:03.150> right<00:03:03.389> between<00:03:03.419> the

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
wide enough to fit right between the

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.390 
wide enough to fit right between the
studs<00:03:04.200> making<00:03:05.120> installation<00:03:06.120> a<00:03:06.329> snap

studs making installation a snap

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.630 
studs making installation a snap
so<00:03:08.400> we<00:03:08.700> hope<00:03:08.879> next<00:03:09.120> time<00:03:09.239> you<00:03:09.540> consider<00:03:10.640> buying

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
so we hope next time you consider buying

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.280 
so we hope next time you consider buying
a<00:03:11.939> transfer<00:03:12.480> switch<00:03:12.629> that<00:03:12.900> you'll<00:03:13.049> consider

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
a transfer switch that you'll consider

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.780 
a transfer switch that you'll consider
