 skin occurs at any age although 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.869
 is much more frequent during the 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.940
 adolescence up to 85% of the 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:36.879
 Patients in this stage of life have 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.320
 some acne lesion and in the 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:40.840
 treatments there are three types 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.600
 fundamentals of treatment and in putting 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:46.570
 one or the other depends on the type of acne and 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:49.329
 the severity the first type are the 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:52.270
 topical treatments that are very 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:55.090
 different and include antibiotics 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:57.700
 topical retinoids and peroxide 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:00.160
 benzoyl and there are also combinations of 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:02.590
 the above are used for an acne 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.730
 mild and the side effects that 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.790
 can produce are mostly 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:09.340
 skin irritation the second kind of 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.380
 treatment are oral antibiotics 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.540
 that you have to take them for several 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.390
 months and are used for an acne 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.950
 moderate or very inflammatory and the 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.860
 third type of treatment is the 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.960
 oral isotretinoin 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.180
 is the most effective acne treatment 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.330
 and they are some pills that you have to 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.950
 taking them for several months does not 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.240
 You can leave the treatment halfway 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.740
 because you have to take a total dose 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.560
 minimum that is calculated based on the 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.080
 patient weight during those months 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.510
 patient has to be analytical and 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.120
 usually feels quite dry 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:47.040
 striking on skin and mucous membranes, 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.229
 the case that there is any alteration 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.180
 hormone should be treated because if not 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.060
 the rest of the treatments are much less 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:57.300
 effective and finally it's important 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.970
 use non-fat cosmetics and perform 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.100
 a daily cleansing of the skin is 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.170
 important to treat acne because although 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.140
 it can disappear spontaneously 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:10.970
 over the years the scars that it leaves are 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.970
 the awful and difficult to treat
