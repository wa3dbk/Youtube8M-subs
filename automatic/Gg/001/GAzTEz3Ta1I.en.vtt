to<00:00:56.820> start<00:00:57.180> off<00:00:57.330> with<00:00:57.690> our<00:00:57.930> color<00:00:58.530> side<00:00:58.830> facing

00:00:59.210 --> 00:00:59.220 
to start off with our color side facing

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.009 
to start off with our color side facing
down<00:00:59.250> and<00:00:59.699> i<00:01:00.150> just<00:01:00.330> want<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.570> put<00:01:00.780> some

00:01:01.009 --> 00:01:01.019 
down and i just want to put some

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:02.689 
down and i just want to put some
preliminary<00:01:01.559> creases<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:01.949> everything<00:01:02.460> here

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
preliminary creases and everything here

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.969 
preliminary creases and everything here
by<00:01:03.210> folding<00:01:03.659> my<00:01:04.140> paper<00:01:04.350> in<00:01:04.530> half<00:01:04.710> diagonally

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
by folding my paper in half diagonally

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.460 
by folding my paper in half diagonally
both<00:01:05.549> ways<00:01:05.820> so<00:01:06.270> make<00:01:06.450> it<00:01:06.479> into<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:06.840> big<00:01:06.990> triangle

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
both ways so make it into a big triangle

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:14.860 
both ways so make it into a big triangle
here<00:01:09.290> fold<00:01:10.290> one<00:01:10.470> way<00:01:10.620> and<00:01:11.340> then<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.640> other

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:14.870 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.300 

once<00:01:15.870> i've<00:01:16.020> got<00:01:16.200> those<00:01:16.410> creases<00:01:16.710> marked<00:01:17.160> off

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
once i've got those creases marked off

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.830 
once i've got those creases marked off
then<00:01:17.580> I<00:01:17.640> could<00:01:17.820> take<00:01:18.000> each<00:01:18.180> of<00:01:18.330> these<00:01:18.450> four

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
then I could take each of these four

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:35.130 
then I could take each of these four
corners<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:19.830> fold<00:01:19.980> into<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.640> center

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.990 

let's<00:01:36.140> go<00:01:36.290> I've<00:01:36.440> got<00:01:36.470> all<00:01:36.979> four<00:01:37.280> sides<00:01:37.490> folded

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
let's go I've got all four sides folded

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.640 
let's go I've got all four sides folded
into<00:01:38.210> the<00:01:38.570> center<00:01:38.960> I'm<00:01:39.170> going<00:01:39.290> to<00:01:39.380> flip<00:01:39.560> it

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:39.650 
into the center I'm going to flip it

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.180 
into the center I'm going to flip it
over<00:01:39.799> and<00:01:40.130> I<00:01:41.060> want<00:01:41.270> to<00:01:41.420> take<00:01:41.690> the<00:01:42.380> bottom<00:01:43.100> edge

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.190 
over and I want to take the bottom edge

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:44.590 
over and I want to take the bottom edge
here<00:01:43.490> and<00:01:43.520> fold<00:01:43.880> it<00:01:44.030> to<00:01:44.150> the<00:01:44.180> center<00:01:44.299> crease

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
here and fold it to the center crease

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.719 
here and fold it to the center crease
that<00:01:44.840> I<00:01:45.080> have<00:01:45.290> when<00:01:45.890> I<00:01:45.920> do<00:01:46.040> want<00:01:46.340> to<00:01:46.399> let<00:01:46.520> that

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
that I have when I do want to let that

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:49.210 
that I have when I do want to let that
flat<00:01:47.119> from<00:01:47.690> behind<00:01:48.020> pop<00:01:48.440> out<00:01:48.680> so<00:01:48.979> that<00:01:49.130> it

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
flat from behind pop out so that it

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.300 
flat from behind pop out so that it
doesn't<00:01:49.399> get<00:01:49.670> folded<00:01:49.940> in<00:01:50.270> this<00:01:50.450> crease<00:01:50.780> here

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
doesn't get folded in this crease here

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.780 
doesn't get folded in this crease here
let's<00:01:52.310> go<00:01:52.430> ahead<00:01:52.549> and<00:01:53.560> Mark<00:01:54.560> it<00:01:54.680> off<00:01:54.799> here<00:01:55.190> just

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
let's go ahead and Mark it off here just

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.160 
let's go ahead and Mark it off here just
be<00:01:56.000> careful<00:01:56.180> when<00:01:56.570> you<00:01:56.659> do<00:01:56.780> this<00:01:56.960> because

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
be careful when you do this because

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.380 
be careful when you do this because
these<00:01:57.619> two<00:01:57.979> little<00:01:58.220> corner<00:01:58.670> areas<00:01:59.000> where<00:01:59.240> this

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
these two little corner areas where this

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.660 
these two little corner areas where this
part<00:01:59.899> is<00:02:00.110> is<00:02:00.500> it's<00:02:00.860> really<00:02:01.160> easy<00:02:01.399> to<00:02:01.520> get

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
part is is it's really easy to get

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.820 
part is is it's really easy to get
snagged<00:02:02.000> on<00:02:02.149> that<00:02:02.330> in<00:02:02.420> to<00:02:02.509> tear<00:02:02.750> it<00:02:02.869> so<00:02:03.140> take

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
snagged on that in to tear it so take

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:05.770 
snagged on that in to tear it so take
care<00:02:03.860> when<00:02:04.220> you're<00:02:04.369> folding<00:02:04.520> there<00:02:04.820> go<00:02:05.660> ahead

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
care when you're folding there go ahead

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:18.880 
care when you're folding there go ahead
and<00:02:05.869> get<00:02:05.929> this<00:02:06.080> one<00:02:06.289> folded<00:02:06.649> over<00:02:06.740> to

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.800 

once<00:02:19.730> you've<00:02:19.880> got<00:02:20.060> both<00:02:20.270> of<00:02:20.300> those<00:02:20.510> sides

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
once you've got both of those sides

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.230 
once you've got both of those sides
folded<00:02:21.260> into<00:02:21.530> the<00:02:21.860> center<00:02:22.280> I<00:02:22.490> want<00:02:23.000> to<00:02:23.090> take

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
folded into the center I want to take

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.030 
folded into the center I want to take
each<00:02:23.420> of<00:02:23.569> the<00:02:23.660> four<00:02:23.900> corners<00:02:24.350> and<00:02:24.530> fold<00:02:24.770> right

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
each of the four corners and fold right

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.190 
each of the four corners and fold right
over<00:02:25.370> along<00:02:25.670> that<00:02:26.090> edge<00:02:26.270> kind<00:02:26.780> of<00:02:26.840> bringing<00:02:27.080> it

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
over along that edge kind of bringing it

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.020 
over along that edge kind of bringing it
into<00:02:27.319> the<00:02:27.590> center<00:02:27.920> make<00:02:28.190> a<00:02:28.220> good<00:02:28.459> crease<00:02:28.700> and

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
into the center make a good crease and

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.520 
into the center make a good crease and
then<00:02:29.720> we're<00:02:29.870> going<00:02:29.959> to<00:02:30.050> do<00:02:30.140> with<00:02:30.260> that<00:02:30.380> is

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
then we're going to do with that is

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.780 
then we're going to do with that is
actually<00:02:30.860> tuck<00:02:31.100> it<00:02:31.310> behind<00:02:33.340> and<00:02:34.340> I'll<00:02:34.520> do<00:02:34.640> that

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
actually tuck it behind and I'll do that

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.580 
actually tuck it behind and I'll do that
for<00:02:34.850> all<00:02:35.240> four<00:02:35.570> of<00:02:35.600> these<00:02:35.840> sides<00:02:36.170> so<00:02:36.470> we're

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
for all four of these sides so we're

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.590 
for all four of these sides so we're
just<00:02:36.620> kind<00:02:36.890> of<00:02:36.920> folding<00:02:37.250> over<00:02:37.370> you<00:02:38.240> can<00:02:38.390> use

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
just kind of folding over you can use

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.210 
just kind of folding over you can use
the<00:02:38.810> center<00:02:39.110> as<00:02:39.290> a<00:02:39.350> guide<00:02:39.650> to<00:02:39.950> make<00:02:40.100> sure

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
the center as a guide to make sure

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.650 
the center as a guide to make sure
you're<00:02:40.340> getting<00:02:40.459> things<00:02:40.790> lined<00:02:41.030> up<00:02:41.180> right<00:02:41.390> and

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
you're getting things lined up right and

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.550 
you're getting things lined up right and
then<00:02:42.260> just<00:02:42.440> get<00:02:42.590> it<00:02:42.709> tucked<00:02:42.920> behind<00:02:44.410> i'll<00:02:45.410> do

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
then just get it tucked behind i'll do

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:58.449 
then just get it tucked behind i'll do
the<00:02:45.709> same<00:02:45.739> thing<00:02:46.190> over<00:02:46.400> here<00:02:46.820> too<00:02:57.070> so<00:02:58.070> you<00:02:58.280> wind

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
the same thing over here too so you wind

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:00.220 
the same thing over here too so you wind
up<00:02:58.550> with<00:02:58.610> this<00:02:58.880> kind<00:02:59.120> of<00:02:59.180> square<00:02:59.510> or<00:02:59.810> diamond

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
up with this kind of square or diamond

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:01.979 
up with this kind of square or diamond
shape<00:03:00.500> after<00:03:00.680> folding<00:03:01.010> all<00:03:01.250> those<00:03:01.430> parts<00:03:01.730> back

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
shape after folding all those parts back

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:03.940 
shape after folding all those parts back
now<00:03:02.989> the<00:03:03.050> next<00:03:03.140> thing<00:03:03.320> we're<00:03:03.500> going<00:03:03.530> to<00:03:03.650> do<00:03:03.830> is

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
now the next thing we're going to do is

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.380 
now the next thing we're going to do is
we're<00:03:04.040> going<00:03:04.130> to<00:03:04.190> just<00:03:04.370> open<00:03:04.760> up<00:03:04.820> this<00:03:05.030> lip

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
we're going to just open up this lip

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.520 
we're going to just open up this lip
area<00:03:05.600> here<00:03:06.140> and<00:03:07.570> what<00:03:08.570> you<00:03:08.660> wind<00:03:08.840> up<00:03:08.959> doing<00:03:09.170> is

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
area here and what you wind up doing is

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.430 
area here and what you wind up doing is
by<00:03:10.250> opening<00:03:10.700> up<00:03:10.850> inside<00:03:11.269> and<00:03:11.570> puffing<00:03:12.170> out<00:03:12.260> the

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
by opening up inside and puffing out the

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.949 
by opening up inside and puffing out the
edges<00:03:12.590> you<00:03:13.459> create<00:03:14.350> this<00:03:15.550> cool<00:03:16.550> little<00:03:16.959> well

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
edges you create this cool little well

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:19.509 
edges you create this cool little well
it<00:03:18.019> looks<00:03:18.170> like<00:03:18.230> a<00:03:18.350> dish<00:03:18.739> from<00:03:18.980> this<00:03:19.190> side<00:03:19.370> but

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 
it looks like a dish from this side but

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:20.680 
it looks like a dish from this side but
that's<00:03:19.670> actually<00:03:19.970> the<00:03:20.060> part<00:03:20.209> you're<00:03:20.360> putting

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
that's actually the part you're putting

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.420 
that's actually the part you're putting
on<00:03:20.780> the<00:03:20.989> head<00:03:21.170> and<00:03:21.380> you've<00:03:21.920> got<00:03:22.040> this<00:03:22.220> nice

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
on the head and you've got this nice

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.060 
on the head and you've got this nice
section<00:03:22.940> here<00:03:23.269> where<00:03:24.110> the<00:03:24.290> heat<00:03:24.500> is<00:03:24.530> stick<00:03:24.920> up

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.070 
section here where the heat is stick up

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.370 
section here where the heat is stick up
to<00:03:25.250> serve<00:03:25.430> as<00:03:25.579> a<00:03:25.610> crown<00:03:25.910> now<00:03:26.570> you<00:03:26.630> can<00:03:26.900> you<00:03:27.260> know

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
to serve as a crown now you can you know

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.229 
to serve as a crown now you can you know
choose<00:03:27.769> to<00:03:27.980> make<00:03:28.130> it<00:03:28.280> more<00:03:28.430> squared<00:03:28.820> off<00:03:28.970> by

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
choose to make it more squared off by

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:31.270 
choose to make it more squared off by
pinching<00:03:29.660> off<00:03:29.840> the<00:03:29.989> edges<00:03:30.140> here<00:03:30.739> and<00:03:30.920> creating

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
pinching off the edges here and creating

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.100 
pinching off the edges here and creating
a<00:03:31.370> crease<00:03:31.610> so<00:03:32.269> that<00:03:32.390> you<00:03:32.450> get<00:03:32.570> more<00:03:32.810> of<00:03:32.900> like<00:03:33.079> a

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
a crease so that you get more of like a

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.289 
a crease so that you get more of like a
square<00:03:33.650> kind<00:03:33.980> of<00:03:34.130> hat<00:03:34.370> that<00:03:34.670> can<00:03:34.850> rest<00:03:35.060> on<00:03:35.180> the

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
square kind of hat that can rest on the

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:37.150 
square kind of hat that can rest on the
head<00:03:35.510> or<00:03:35.720> you<00:03:36.350> can<00:03:36.500> kind<00:03:36.680> of<00:03:36.709> leave<00:03:36.890> it<00:03:36.920> more

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
head or you can kind of leave it more

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.100 
head or you can kind of leave it more
smooth<00:03:37.489> it<00:03:37.670> out<00:03:37.730> and<00:03:38.000> just<00:03:38.299> kind<00:03:38.630> of<00:03:38.660> pop<00:03:38.900> it<00:03:39.019> on

smooth it out and just kind of pop it on
to<00:03:39.290> a<00:03:39.320> head<00:03:39.470> it<00:03:39.590> looks<00:03:39.829> keeps<00:03:40.280> its<00:03:40.489> form<00:03:40.790> really

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
to a head it looks keeps its form really

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:42.130 
to a head it looks keeps its form really
good<00:03:41.150> when<00:03:41.269> you<00:03:41.360> put<00:03:41.510> it<00:03:41.600> on<00:03:41.690> to<00:03:41.810> something

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
good when you put it on to something

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.069 
good when you put it on to something
round<00:03:42.820> definitely<00:03:43.820> keeps<00:03:44.180> a<00:03:44.329> good<00:03:44.510> shape<00:03:44.840> for

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:45.079

a<00:03:45.440> for<00:03:46.040> a<00:03:46.070> crown<00:03:46.400> there<00:03:46.670> but<00:03:47.480> that<00:03:47.959> gives<00:03:48.079> you

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
a for a crown there but that gives you

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.170 
a for a crown there but that gives you
sort<00:03:48.470> of<00:03:48.590> the<00:03:48.650> finished<00:03:49.000> dimensions<00:03:50.000> there
