00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:07.740
 good morning today I would like to talk to you about 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:10.559
 just knit closure on knit 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.019
 reverse the closure just knit 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.320
 naturally as the word itself says 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.930
 can happen both on the right as 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.740
 we saw the other time both on 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:25.650
 reverse and here is the reverse side 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:27.539
 as before all the considerations on the 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.300
 yarn length will obviously be 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:33.920
 always the same will obviously change 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:39.770
 how we will close these two edges 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:45.379
 as well as before or culturally 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:45.379
 Fissero the pool the first point 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:01:04.199
 prefixes accord enter after that 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:12.170
 instead whole from in front of this part 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:12.170
 it surprises prix punto piccolo here it is 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:20.240
 we should always take two points 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:25.430
 together however in this case we should 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:28.460
 take them from below to above so 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:35.870
 here it is as always the first points are i 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:38.510
 more difficult and with irons also of m 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:42.490
 it is not clear why this is the 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.490
 first point that rewards here it is 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.570
 everything is below 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:02:02.570
 to above practically the reverse of that 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:04.700
 that we did before that is from above below 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:08.420
 we must do from below to above for 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:11.330
 rebuild the reverse shirt so 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:14.239
 again it's a bit more complicated 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:17.709
 let's say however the effect is obviously 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:17.709
 very nice 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:27.599
 sup 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.700
 pardon 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:54.010
 we see from below but above here is this 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.470
 In case we can't get two for 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.940
 time 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:02.980
 we have to take them one at a time but 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:05.380
 always two on one side and 2 on the other 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:16.530
 even on this side it is like a little more 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:16.530
 complicated to see we take it that way 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:20.489
 seen this way 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:31.299
 and then we will enter from the front here is how 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.690
 always now that the edges are 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:35.890
 slightly joined is easier to 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:45.510
 to see 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:45.510
 and then obviously so from inside shop 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:58.560
 again expo 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.569
 and inside 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:12.159
 and a lot of this I go out 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:25.510
 the trip whole disk 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:38.660
 and so obviously until the end of 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:41.620
 iron begins to see each other again 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:45.500
 better as it is moving 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:48.830
 this is interesting to know 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:50.510
 obviously as it is also done on the back 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:54.740
 not only on the right because 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:58.310
 we may need to merge two 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:01.070
 parts that are for example braided for 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:03.830
 which I am on an upside down basis are 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:07.460
 straight braids on an inverted base 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:10.250
 or there are various reasons not for 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:12.830
 which is always better to know that it exists 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:15.950
 naturally also the closure on 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:18.890
 reverse knit and you have to do it in a way 

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:22.940
 that the closure is really invisible 

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:25.340
 because if we close and with the 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:27.860
 straight sweater on the reverse knit 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:33.160
 in short, one would see he would give a job 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:38.240
 rather rough and so instead 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:41.720
 let's say the irons here is that the 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:45.410
 closure is absolutely perfect 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:48.110
 see well even in this case this 

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:50.530
 you know well 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:50.530
 to the next
