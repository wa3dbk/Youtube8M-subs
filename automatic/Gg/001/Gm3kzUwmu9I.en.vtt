can this bat keeps accumulating right

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:18.630 
can this bat keeps accumulating right
here<00:00:16.050> well<00:00:17.050> remember<00:00:17.740> in<00:00:17.830> our<00:00:17.950> last<00:00:18.100> video<00:00:18.340> we

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:18.640 
here well remember in our last video we

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.410 
here well remember in our last video we
discussed<00:00:19.090> that<00:00:19.210> fat<00:00:19.630> was<00:00:19.960> what<00:00:21.269> that<00:00:22.269> is

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:22.420 
discussed that fat was what that is

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:23.939 
discussed that fat was what that is
actually<00:00:22.750> energy<00:00:23.140> right<00:00:23.349> well<00:00:23.529> that's<00:00:23.679> right

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:23.949 
actually energy right well that's right

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:27.900 
actually energy right well that's right
it's<00:00:24.160> stored<00:00:24.609> energy<00:00:24.939> so<00:00:26.220> once<00:00:27.220> we<00:00:27.400> understand

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:27.910 
it's stored energy so once we understand

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.339 
it's stored energy so once we understand
that<00:00:28.060> you<00:00:28.210> have<00:00:28.330> stored<00:00:28.689> energy<00:00:28.839> in<00:00:29.080> the<00:00:29.199> body

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:29.349 
that you have stored energy in the body

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:32.040 
that you have stored energy in the body
we<00:00:29.949> also<00:00:30.550> know<00:00:30.820> better<00:00:31.119> than<00:00:31.330> that<00:00:31.390> we<00:00:31.839> can

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.050 
we also know better than that we can

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.040 
we also know better than that we can
burn<00:00:32.290> that<00:00:32.500> fat<00:00:32.770> off<00:00:33.010> or<00:00:33.400> use<00:00:34.000> that<00:00:34.330> energy<00:00:34.570> in

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.050 
burn that fat off or use that energy in

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.979 
burn that fat off or use that energy in
order<00:00:35.350> to<00:00:35.710> move<00:00:36.040> from<00:00:36.310> the<00:00:36.430> body<00:00:36.670> so<00:00:37.360> but

describing after what they like that is
but<00:01:34.000> just<00:01:34.960> I<00:01:35.020> understand<00:01:35.409> again<00:01:35.560> if<00:01:35.799> you<00:01:35.950> have

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 
but just I understand again if you have

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:38.069 
but just I understand again if you have
a<00:01:36.430> large<00:01:36.909> belly<00:01:37.299> sticking<00:01:37.630> out<00:01:37.869> it's

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:38.079 
a large belly sticking out it's

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:39.960 
a large belly sticking out it's
extremely<00:01:38.619> tight<00:01:38.860> that<00:01:39.130> means<00:01:39.340> deep<00:01:39.700> with

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:39.970 
extremely tight that means deep with

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.920 
extremely tight that means deep with
inside<00:01:40.509> of<00:01:40.750> that<00:01:40.930> happening<00:01:41.560> wall<00:01:41.829> you<00:01:42.280> have

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
inside of that happening wall you have

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.139 
inside of that happening wall you have
usually<00:01:43.930> probably<00:01:44.350> parents<00:01:45.040> of<00:01:45.189> fact<00:01:45.939> that

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:46.149 
usually probably parents of fact that

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:47.730 
usually probably parents of fact that
has<00:01:46.270> it<00:01:46.420> accumulated<00:01:46.930> around<00:01:47.020> two<00:01:47.320> organs

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
has it accumulated around two organs

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.440 
has it accumulated around two organs
which<00:01:47.920> obviously<00:01:48.250> we<00:01:49.000> know<00:01:49.119> right<00:01:49.270> now<00:01:49.329> is

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
which obviously we know right now is

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.130 
which obviously we know right now is
extremely<00:01:50.380> unhealthy<00:01:50.619> for<00:01:51.250> you<00:01:51.280> so<00:01:52.140> that's

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
extremely unhealthy for you so that's

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.139
