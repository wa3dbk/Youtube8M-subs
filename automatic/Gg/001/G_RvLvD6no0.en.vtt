hair color without the ammonia and the
toxins<00:00:30.029> I<00:00:30.150> would<00:00:30.300> do<00:00:30.449> it<00:00:30.570> in<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:30.750> sec<00:00:30.990> I've<00:00:31.260> used

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
toxins I would do it in a sec I've used

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.880

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.490 
colors and I would never in a million
years<00:00:39.120> think<00:00:39.629> about<00:00:39.780> doing<00:00:39.960> that<00:00:40.079> with<00:00:40.290> a

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
years think about doing that with a

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.000 
years think about doing that with a
salon<00:00:40.920> mix<00:00:41.280> or<00:00:41.610> drug<00:00:42.600> counter<00:00:42.870> mix<00:00:43.050> there<00:00:43.680> I

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
salon mix or drug counter mix there I

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.819 
salon mix or drug counter mix there I
did<00:00:44.730> use<00:00:44.940> ammonia<00:00:45.329> based<00:00:45.600> collar<00:00:45.989> before<00:00:46.230> and

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
did use ammonia based collar before and

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.310 
did use ammonia based collar before and
what<00:00:47.340> it<00:00:47.460> did<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.670> my<00:00:47.910> hair<00:00:48.149> was<00:00:48.390> made<00:00:48.899> it<00:00:49.050> very

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
what it did to my hair was made it very

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.760 
what it did to my hair was made it very
dry<00:00:49.530> very<00:00:50.239> brittle<00:00:51.239> and<00:00:51.449> my<00:00:52.320> hair<00:00:52.590> was

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
dry very brittle and my hair was

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.420 
dry very brittle and my hair was
breaking<00:00:53.190> off<00:00:53.840> but<00:00:54.840> with<00:00:55.020> this<00:00:55.140> collar<00:00:55.469> my

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
breaking off but with this collar my

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.209 
breaking off but with this collar my
hair<00:00:56.640> feel<00:00:56.910> silky<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.719> luxurious<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:58.890> I<00:00:59.010> love

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
hair feel silky and luxurious and I love

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.310 
hair feel silky and luxurious and I love
it<00:00:59.250> there<00:00:59.609> does<00:00:59.940> seem<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.270> be<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.570> very<00:01:00.660> obvious

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
it there does seem to be a very obvious

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.319 
it there does seem to be a very obvious
difference<00:01:01.770> in<00:01:01.920> terms<00:01:02.520> of<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.820> results

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
difference in terms of the results

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.539 
difference in terms of the results
achieved<00:01:03.539> by<00:01:04.049> Susan<00:01:04.500> Henry's<00:01:04.830> natural<00:01:05.369> color

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
achieved by Susan Henry's natural color

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.910 
achieved by Susan Henry's natural color
process<00:01:06.060> versus<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.960> results<00:01:07.409> achieved<00:01:07.530> by<00:01:07.890> a

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
process versus the results achieved by a

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.190 
process versus the results achieved by a
typical<00:01:08.430> ammonia-based<00:01:09.210> hair<00:01:09.689> color<00:01:09.930> product

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
typical ammonia-based hair color product

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.080 
typical ammonia-based hair color product
but<00:01:10.860> that's<00:01:11.100> only<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.460> difference<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.060> eye

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
but that's only the difference the eye

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.719 
but that's only the difference the eye
can<00:01:12.570> see<00:01:12.650> we<00:01:13.650> need<00:01:13.860> to<00:01:14.010> take<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.189> closer<00:01:14.520> look

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
can see we need to take a closer look

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.660 
can see we need to take a closer look
and<00:01:15.119> by<00:01:15.689> closer<00:01:15.990> I<00:01:16.140> mean<00:01:16.500> magnified<00:01:17.070> by<00:01:17.310> let's

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
and by closer I mean magnified by let's

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.590 
and by closer I mean magnified by let's
say<00:01:17.759> several<00:01:18.540> thousand<00:01:19.380> or<00:01:19.560> so<00:01:20.240> what<00:01:21.240> you<00:01:21.360> see

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600
