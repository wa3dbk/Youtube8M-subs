well but I do think that Mayweather's

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:41.030 
well but I do think that Mayweather's
defense<00:05:39.900> and<00:05:40.080> his<00:05:40.169> accuracy<00:05:40.620> with<00:05:41.010> the

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:41.040 
defense and his accuracy with the

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.040 
defense and his accuracy with the
punches<00:05:41.550> is<00:05:41.729> gonna<00:05:41.970> present<00:05:42.210> here<00:05:42.570> and<00:05:42.690> if

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050 
punches is gonna present here and if

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.140

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:45.150 
this does happen I do believe that

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:46.460 
this does happen I do believe that
Mayweather<00:05:45.510> is<00:05:45.600> gonna<00:05:45.810> win<00:05:46.020> by<00:05:46.169> decision

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:46.470 
Mayweather is gonna win by decision

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:47.719 
Mayweather is gonna win by decision
hopefully<00:05:46.950> I'm<00:05:47.040> wrong<00:05:47.070> hopefully<00:05:47.610> I'm<00:05:47.669> wrong

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:47.729 
hopefully I'm wrong hopefully I'm wrong

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:49.460 
hopefully I'm wrong hopefully I'm wrong
but<00:05:48.090> if<00:05:48.510> history<00:05:48.750> does<00:05:49.140> repeat<00:05:49.169> itself

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:49.470 
but if history does repeat itself
