00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.219
 new video are acu marin and today we are 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.230
 in a video tutorial 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.720
 today I will show you how you will already be 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.150
 read from the title how to put the fashions 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.460
 for minecraft pixel mon père minecraft 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.260
 1.7 point 10 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.300
 these second times you record this 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.119
 video the file I have already made it 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.759
 lost so I hope this time not 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.130
 you cancel nothing then they are registered 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.960
 with quicktime so i apologize if any 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.239
 piece of the screen maybe isn't 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:43.219
 present but I really disgust my friend i 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:49.410
 common I do not know does not want to register 

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:52.320
 then for you have to have forge for in 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.059
 version 11.7 point 10 and now I do 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.460
 see also how to install it therefore for 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.920
 download I already made video tutorial 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.750
 that you will find some corner of the video 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.019
 you can click if you have not installed 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.360
 forge and after you have installed forge 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.930
 I recommend you always have minecraft 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.390
 without something installed already before 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.869
 if you want to install the pixel mon now i 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.850
 for example, I mean I am in a new one 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.759
 profile so all new you must 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:25.979
 select your profile and then 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:29.670
 put release 1.7 point 10 bets for 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.590
 elisa 1.2.10 and save then play 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:36.240
 so that you download all the packages 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.079
 to play we say the 1.7 point 10 later 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.560
 what have you done 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:42.509
 double click on forge and I recommend you 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.540
 to have java the latest version because 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.190
 sometimes it doesn't work forge e 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:51.900
 wait for that 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:53.520
 install the packages in minecraft yes 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:57.060
 saw to some mistake forge you do n't 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.280
 you were at the king take a look if you have 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.900
 selected a tip 7.10 if you have 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.780
 installed made artist give i 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:06.030
 packages to make fun of us that 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:15.180
 we installed it because the mousse a 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:19.290
 minecraft and select forge branches in 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:25.220
 kraft with a point 7.10 will download you 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:25.220
 all things and now also opens minecraft 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:36.040
 perfect you see there is there are three 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:39.670
 ways of forge installed now writes 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:42.969
 so much so that on the second link anyway 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.709
 the mon equate pixel you see been 

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:46.060
 updated with respect to my last video 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.900
 because I have already done this 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.180
 video but 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.620
 I'm doing it to update, let's say it 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.370
 pixel mgr 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:57.379
 then if you want to be safe 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:01.459
 click here also the forge link like this 

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:03.230
 really directly instead for 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:05.720
 download the pixel that this is 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:08.379
 the latest version could therefore have 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.640
 some bugs if you want to be sure 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:14.840
 download the recommended one 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:17.420
 if instead we say you really want 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.849
 try it translated into thin left the 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:24.909
 my birthday anyway 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:24.909
 make the latest release version 

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:32.689
 wait five seconds for atfih imola 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:37.930
 click on next will appear this 

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:37.930
 screen then wait 8 seconds 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:48.959
 here it is 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:52.690
 on a media link does was do download 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:53.950
 preserve and try five minutes a 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.780

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:09.180
 ok guys miss two seconds later 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:12.610
 it was more than five minutes 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:14.560
 unfortunately for me then after you have 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:17.950
 installed after you downloaded the 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:21.750
 pixels don't go as usual on go to 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:27.190
 folder now that you write comma 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:35.380

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.850
 they weren't there before 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:52.110
 eva go to mods and put on 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:54.400

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:57.060

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:13.710
 we can do it by ok 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:17.210
 as you can see there are four bushels he had 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:22.080
 4 working worlds now I show 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:26.430
 then not so fast I do 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:28.200

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:29.280
 of minecraft is then the pixel but neither 

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.430
 that day 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:34.530
 this is the last version is not that 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:37.380
 it is not the recommended one 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:42.120
 we choose a pokémon at random we see not 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:44.790
 occasionally because I didn't have the 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.180
 types of grass anyway look at the first one 

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:49.380
 bugs 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:54.120
 if today what happened is productive 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:57.030
 well ok as you see then there are the laws 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:06:03.720

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:10.050
 Count adjustments usually see it 6 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:13.020
 click the cell button but the pixel 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:15.270
 a day this is both the tweets and 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:22.260
 you can simply fight for 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:24.420
 example this is a pin rank ok and is a 

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:27.690
 pokémon that was not there before indeed if 

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:28.500
 see the skin and very realistic yes 

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:30.990

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:32.460
 look, that's cool if you don't like that 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:36.210

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:37.650
