00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.950 
2011 but there was a two-year process
before<00:01:48.249> that<00:01:48.640> of<00:01:48.820> designing<00:01:49.420> the<00:01:49.509> watches<00:01:49.929> and

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
before that of designing the watches and

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.230 
before that of designing the watches and
finding<00:01:50.740> the<00:01:50.859> right<00:01:51.100> factory<00:01:51.729> to<00:01:51.820> make<00:01:51.999> them

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
finding the right factory to make them

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.660 
finding the right factory to make them
for<00:01:52.450> me<00:01:52.479> and<00:01:52.950> you<00:01:53.950> know<00:01:54.070> setting<00:01:54.460> up<00:01:54.549> the

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
for me and you know setting up the

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.380 
for me and you know setting up the
business<00:01:54.899> so<00:01:55.899> I<00:01:56.399> guess<00:01:57.399> 2008<00:01:58.149> was<00:01:58.359> the

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
business so I guess 2008 was the

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.779 
business so I guess 2008 was the
beginning<00:01:58.899> of<00:01:58.960> the<00:01:59.109> company<00:01:59.499> and<00:02:00.399> then<00:02:00.609> it

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:00.789 
beginning of the company and then it

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:03.660 
beginning of the company and then it
kind<00:02:01.060> of<00:02:01.170> launched<00:02:02.170> in<00:02:02.289> 2011<00:02:02.799> Paige<00:02:03.490> and

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
kind of launched in 2011 Paige and

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.389 
kind of launched in 2011 Paige and
Cooper<00:02:03.789> actually<00:02:04.289> approached<00:02:05.289> me<00:02:05.499> very<00:02:06.100> soon

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:06.399 
Cooper actually approached me very soon

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:08.430 
Cooper actually approached me very soon
after<00:02:06.789> the<00:02:06.909> launch<00:02:07.090> and<00:02:07.569> you<00:02:07.960> know<00:02:08.170> Jonathan

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
after the launch and you know Jonathan

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.010 
after the launch and you know Jonathan
really<00:02:09.210> understood<00:02:10.210> what<00:02:10.420> the<00:02:10.479> brand<00:02:10.840> was

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
really understood what the brand was

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.020 
really understood what the brand was
about<00:02:11.290> he<00:02:11.530> understood<00:02:11.950> what<00:02:12.280> what<00:02:12.790> I<00:02:12.820> was

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
about he understood what what I was

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.000 
about he understood what what I was
trying<00:02:13.300> to<00:02:13.360> do<00:02:13.600> from<00:02:14.080> the<00:02:14.200> very<00:02:14.380> beginning<00:02:14.530> and

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
trying to do from the very beginning and

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.800 
trying to do from the very beginning and
so<00:02:16.000> he<00:02:16.210> Jonathan

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
so he Jonathan

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.960 
so he Jonathan
and<00:02:17.080> Paige<00:02:17.319> Cooper<00:02:17.590> that<00:02:18.160> is<00:02:18.610> our<00:02:18.730> first

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
and Paige Cooper that is our first

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.540 
and Paige Cooper that is our first
retailer<00:02:19.540> and<00:02:19.860> we've<00:02:20.860> had<00:02:21.040> a<00:02:21.069> really<00:02:21.340> great

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
retailer and we've had a really great

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.309 
retailer and we've had a really great
relationship<00:02:21.790> ever<00:02:22.420> since<00:02:22.690> with<00:02:22.900> them<00:02:23.110> I

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
relationship ever since with them I

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:25.800 
relationship ever since with them I
think<00:02:24.040> that<00:02:24.400> Paige<00:02:24.670> and<00:02:24.850> Cooper<00:02:24.970> is<00:02:25.360> quite

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
think that Paige and Cooper is quite

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.870 
think that Paige and Cooper is quite
different<00:02:26.260> because<00:02:26.410> I<00:02:27.010> think<00:02:27.610> they

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
different because I think they

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.540 
different because I think they
understand<00:02:28.360> that<00:02:28.900> it's<00:02:29.890> not<00:02:30.100> just<00:02:30.160> about

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
understand that it's not just about

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.930 
understand that it's not just about
selling<00:02:31.330> a<00:02:31.720> watch<00:02:32.380> it's<00:02:33.160> about<00:02:33.430> selling<00:02:33.850> an

selling a watch it's about selling an
idea<00:02:34.270> and<00:02:34.569> a<00:02:35.080> kind<00:02:35.800> of<00:02:35.890> a<00:02:36.239> fantasy<00:02:37.239> if<00:02:37.330> you<00:02:37.480> will

holidays that we launched this watch

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.660 
holidays that we launched this watch
it's<00:03:14.860> based<00:03:15.630> very<00:03:16.630> much<00:03:16.750> on<00:03:17.110> early<00:03:17.739> 70s<00:03:18.250> racing

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
coronagraphs it's actually has elements

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.030 
coronagraphs it's actually has elements
that<00:03:22.329> are<00:03:22.510> derived<00:03:23.230> from<00:03:23.470> a<00:03:23.680> number<00:03:24.010> of

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
that are derived from a number of

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.380 
that are derived from a number of
different<00:03:24.190> watches<00:03:25.000> that<00:03:25.209> are<00:03:25.269> kind<00:03:25.570> of<00:03:25.690> again

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
different watches that are kind of again

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
recomposed and kind of interspersed

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:34.140 
recomposed and kind of interspersed
together<00:03:31.630> to<00:03:32.049> make<00:03:32.290> this<00:03:32.500> watch<00:03:32.739> as<00:03:33.160> well<00:03:33.640> as<00:03:33.790> a

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
together to make this watch as well as a

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.080 
together to make this watch as well as a
kind<00:03:34.480> of<00:03:34.600> modern<00:03:34.870> more<00:03:35.709> minimalist<00:03:36.310> execution

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
kind of modern more minimalist execution

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.479 
kind of modern more minimalist execution
so<00:03:37.720> from<00:03:38.230> the<00:03:38.320> very<00:03:38.530> front<00:03:38.769> of<00:03:38.950> the<00:03:39.010> watch<00:03:39.250> I

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
so from the very front of the watch I

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:41.850 
so from the very front of the watch I
wanted<00:03:39.850> to<00:03:39.970> look<00:03:40.180> almost<00:03:40.510> period<00:03:41.200> where<00:03:41.590> if

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
wanted to look almost period where if

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.920 
wanted to look almost period where if
you<00:03:41.980> put<00:03:42.190> it<00:03:42.250> on<00:03:42.340> the<00:03:42.400> table<00:03:42.610> with<00:03:42.970> four<00:03:43.810> or

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
you put it on the table with four or

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.479 
you put it on the table with four or
five<00:03:43.989> other<00:03:44.140> racing<00:03:44.829> coronagraphs<00:03:45.280> with

five other racing coronagraphs with

five other racing coronagraphs with
barrel<00:03:45.790> cases<00:03:46.239> from<00:03:46.750> like<00:03:47.470> 1972<00:03:48.280> you<00:03:49.120> would

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:49.299 
barrel cases from like 1972 you would

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:51.509 
barrel cases from like 1972 you would
assume<00:03:49.600> that<00:03:49.660> the<00:03:50.019> prototipo<00:03:50.620> was<00:03:50.920> one<00:03:51.400> of

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
assume that the prototipo was one of

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:52.979 
assume that the prototipo was one of
them<00:03:51.670> that<00:03:51.880> it<00:03:52.060> was<00:03:52.269> made<00:03:52.510> in<00:03:52.630> that<00:03:52.720> time

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
them that it was made in that time

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:55.289 
them that it was made in that time
period<00:03:53.230> but<00:03:53.920> then<00:03:54.130> when<00:03:54.430> you<00:03:54.519> pick<00:03:54.730> it<00:03:54.850> up<00:03:54.970> and

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:55.299 
period but then when you pick it up and

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:57.120 
period but then when you pick it up and
you<00:03:55.750> start<00:03:55.989> to<00:03:56.109> turn<00:03:56.260> it<00:03:56.440> over<00:03:56.560> and<00:03:56.739> you<00:03:56.980> look

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
you start to turn it over and you look

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.099 
you start to turn it over and you look
at<00:03:57.250> the<00:03:57.370> way<00:03:57.459> the<00:03:57.579> pushers<00:03:57.970> are<00:03:58.000> executed<00:03:58.959> you

00:03:59.099 --> 00:03:59.109 
at the way the pushers are executed you

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:02.180 
at the way the pushers are executed you
look<00:03:59.290> at<00:03:59.440> the<00:03:59.950> case<00:04:00.579> back<00:04:00.880> is<00:04:01.060> totally<00:04:01.510> flush

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
look at the case back is totally flush

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.830 
look at the case back is totally flush
