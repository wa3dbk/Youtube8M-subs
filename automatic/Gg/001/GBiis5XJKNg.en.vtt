00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
touchscreen 4.8 inch over here is an

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:38.690 
touchscreen 4.8 inch over here is an
hdmi<00:01:27.400> port<00:01:30.000> so<00:01:31.350> micro<00:01:32.350> HDMI<00:01:33.070> and<00:01:36.750> here<00:01:37.750> is<00:01:37.960> the

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.590 
hdmi port so micro HDMI and here is the
valerie<00:01:40.380> has<00:01:41.380> a<00:01:41.610> 1650<00:01:42.610> milliampere<00:01:43.420> our

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
valerie has a 1650 milliampere our

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.710
