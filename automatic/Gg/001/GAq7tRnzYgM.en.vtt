00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
so we tried it we tried it with just

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.170 
so we tried it we tried it with just
putting<00:01:13.140> some<00:01:13.260> of<00:01:13.530> gimli<00:01:13.890> voice<00:01:14.159> in<00:01:14.490> some<00:01:15.090> of

putting some of gimli voice in some of

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.359 
putting some of gimli voice in some of
these<00:01:15.270> cutscenes<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:16.049> so<00:01:16.590> he<00:01:16.710> set<00:01:16.860> his<00:01:17.070> winky

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
these cutscenes and so he set his winky

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.280 
these cutscenes and so he set his winky
we<00:01:17.520> was<00:01:17.640> talking<00:01:17.880> about<00:01:18.000> whoring<00:01:18.540> fires<00:01:18.900> and

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
we was talking about whoring fires and

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.499 
we was talking about whoring fires and
multiple<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.400> all<00:01:20.700> that<00:01:20.820> kind<00:01:21.030> of<00:01:21.060> stuff<00:01:21.150> went

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
multiple and all that kind of stuff went

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.289 
multiple and all that kind of stuff went
that's<00:01:22.020> brilliant<00:01:22.380> that<00:01:23.220> works<00:01:23.490> just<00:01:23.700> so<00:01:24.060> well

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
that's brilliant that works just so well

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.359 
that's brilliant that works just so well
so<00:01:24.570> it<00:01:24.990> doesn't<00:01:25.350> in<00:01:25.439> any<00:01:25.500> way<00:01:25.619> kind<00:01:25.950> of<00:01:25.979> detract

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
so it doesn't in any way kind of detract

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.670 
so it doesn't in any way kind of detract
we<00:01:26.549> feel<00:01:26.790> from<00:01:27.060> you<00:01:27.659> know<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.810> irreverent<00:01:28.530> and
