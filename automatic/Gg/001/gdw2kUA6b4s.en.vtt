00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
about this last night I think it'd be

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.570 
about this last night I think it'd be
awesome<00:01:18.689> in<00:01:18.990> doing<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.259> v8<00:01:19.590> in<00:01:19.710> bat<00:01:19.890> cave<00:01:20.159> but<00:01:20.520> I

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
awesome in doing a v8 in bat cave but I

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.649 
awesome in doing a v8 in bat cave but I
