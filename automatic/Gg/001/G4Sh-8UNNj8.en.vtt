00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.780
 and December 8 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:30.390
 I think it's being respectful 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.710
 being respectful is a lack of 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.200
 respect for people who are talking 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.430
 well and I think you do a lot of damage to your 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.320
 daughter all that attitude that you have 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.309
 really disrespectful people 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:44.180
 to have children or talk like that 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.180
 these are animals 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.810
 I keep it 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.600
 exists 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:10.940
 that is, it was not seen with the system 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:14.360
 ventura tina the theme and every day is 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:17.570
 with the same theme offer what did not happen 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.970
 by martina without even passing and that 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.799
 they assign it to Martinique 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.369
 I ask him is why he awarded to 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.369
 Martina 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:32.270
 Mariana thank you very much for your time 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:35.900
 you have a lovely son 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:39.890
 I hope you're still fine I do not like it 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:42.440
 mind the answer to a question or a 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.730
 appreciation of barcenas and good talk 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:54.790
 because what he said can not know why 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:54.790
 why did not you ask yourself marianas 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.930
 simply if parables people 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:08.630
 qualified for having or not having children 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:12.470
 The only thing that was saying was that it seems to me that 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:14.030
 It's worth clarifying, so it's not 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.400
 they have famous children but they go through what 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.470
 same all the boys unfortunately 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.400
 I do not agree and the older 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:24.650
 we suffer bullying and sometimes we suffer 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.330
 people in the wrong way saying 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.020
 that you can not talk because you do not have 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:31.210
 children thank you mariana until the same 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:34.090
 then sorry before 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:37.140
 to see Marian 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.140
 hello short 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:43.450
 ends the conversation 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.620
 you are a daughter who is very famous I want 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.620
 turn on all this 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.410
 in this talk because I think that 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.390
 I have the least found position with 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.470
 yours Mariana although I respect everyone 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.030
 colleagues and I think it was 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.010
 relevant the question red kingfisher 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.080
 because the published information and never 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.000
 he had denied himself from martina's mouth 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.100
 I explain myself and that testimony at first 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.680
 person was super valuable then 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.930
 let's say I understand the question I thought 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.150
 more than relevant but beyond that 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.670
 do not you think that they fight against 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.520
 windmills that is cruelty 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.550
 medium 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:41.930
 it is not privative of martina that is to say 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:44.810
 against her and it goes against all of us 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.520
 the cruelty of twitter neither talk and you 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.440
 I tell personal experience with 40 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:51.290
 years I can not have twitter I do not know 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:53.240
 I mean cut and good then 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:56.120
 games if they were not played I do not like that 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:58.340
 game I do not play in this I go with andrade 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.110
 with medal it does not seem to me to be 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.720
 same as the classroom topic because it does not 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:05.000
 we have the right to formal education 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.950
 nobody can cut us that right 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.790
 but on twitter let's say it's fixing the 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.550
 game 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:12.650
 I do not want the unknown measure any 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:14.240
 cruelty and he threw it over my head and I 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.790
 I do not know who it is or why 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:19.040
 He says it, I 'll explain, you'll be my friend 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:24.740
 excuse me, I do not think that also 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:30.270
 is where you will receive any embargo 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:31.860
 to nobody 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.210
 but martÃ­nez does not attack anyone and 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.760
 we do not attack anyone 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:38.030
 mariana is not about attacking 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:42.350
 to people for free 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:42.350
 neither do you have to be 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:50.190
 I understand you and I would love that the world 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:52.200
 was zero aggression but it does not happen nor 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:54.510
 even among politicians does not happen 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:58.730
 between governments before the press 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:58.730
 this mythical time in this
