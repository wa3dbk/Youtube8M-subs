I basically I'm in the computer room not
to<00:00:02.460> go<00:00:02.580> and<00:00:02.700> what<00:00:02.790> I've<00:00:02.879> got<00:00:02.909> here<00:00:03.179> is<00:00:03.360> a<00:00:03.899> iPad

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
to go and what I've got here is a iPad

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:10.009 
to go and what I've got here is a iPad
air<00:00:05.100> or<00:00:05.609> the<00:00:06.470> majority<00:00:07.470> of<00:00:07.859> an<00:00:08.340> iPad<00:00:08.730> app<00:00:09.019> what

air or the majority of an iPad app what
can<00:00:10.139> i<00:00:10.200> from<00:00:10.440> the<00:00:10.559> inside<00:00:10.889> the<00:00:11.010> screens<00:00:11.280> been

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
can i from the inside the screens been

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.339 
can i from the inside the screens been
taken<00:00:11.910> off<00:00:12.030> but<00:00:12.450> what's<00:00:12.690> happening<00:00:13.019> but<00:00:13.170> this

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
taken off but what's happening but this

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.410 
taken off but what's happening but this
is<00:00:13.559> it's<00:00:14.309> been<00:00:14.460> sent<00:00:14.670> to<00:00:14.730> us<00:00:14.910> for<00:00:15.089> a<00:00:15.150> power

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
is it's been sent to us for a power

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.099 
is it's been sent to us for a power
obviously<00:00:16.049> the<00:00:16.910> screen<00:00:17.930> originally<00:00:18.930> was

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
obviously the screen originally was

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.970 
obviously the screen originally was
damaged<00:00:19.500> so<00:00:20.300> that<00:00:21.300> was<00:00:21.960> going<00:00:22.380> to<00:00:22.500> be<00:00:22.590> replaced

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
damaged so that was going to be replaced

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.550 
damaged so that was going to be replaced
and<00:00:23.220> then<00:00:23.820> we<00:00:24.150> had<00:00:24.330> problems<00:00:24.930> where<00:00:25.350> the

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
and then we had problems where the

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.189 
and then we had problems where the
damage<00:00:26.010> to<00:00:26.789> a<00:00:26.820> connector<00:00:27.599> that<00:00:27.779> was<00:00:27.930> on<00:00:28.109> the

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
damage to a connector that was on the

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.290 
damage to a connector that was on the
mainboard<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:29.490> connector<00:00:29.849> that<00:00:29.880> was<00:00:30.029> there

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
mainboard the connector that was there

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.389 
mainboard the connector that was there
is<00:00:31.279> for<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.520> home<00:00:32.850> button<00:00:33.600> circuit<00:00:34.399> that's

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
is for the home button circuit that's

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.299 
is for the home button circuit that's
broken<00:00:35.610> off<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:36.590> we<00:00:37.590> need<00:00:37.860> to<00:00:37.950> replace<00:00:38.250> it

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
broken off and we need to replace it

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.569 
broken off and we need to replace it
because<00:00:38.750> when<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:40.469> sticker<00:00:41.010> was<00:00:41.129> taken<00:00:41.489> up

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
because when the sticker was taken up

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.740 
because when the sticker was taken up
that<00:00:41.730> covers<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.980> the<00:00:43.980> Flex<00:00:44.250> going<00:00:44.850> into<00:00:45.329> the

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
that covers the the Flex going into the

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.510 
that covers the the Flex going into the
connector<00:00:46.200> it<00:00:46.440> ripped<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.950> connector<00:00:47.399> off

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
connector it ripped the connector off

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.700 
connector it ripped the connector off
the<00:00:47.670> board<00:00:48.079> so<00:00:49.079> yeah<00:00:49.230> we're<00:00:49.350> going<00:00:49.469> to<00:00:49.530> clean

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
the board so yeah we're going to clean

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.869 
the board so yeah we're going to clean
this<00:00:49.860> up<00:00:50.039> we're<00:00:50.640> going<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:50.820> get<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:52.879> connector

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
this up we're going to get the connector

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.700 
this up we're going to get the connector
replaced<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.570> then<00:00:54.780> hopefully<00:00:55.020> we'll<00:00:55.469> see<00:00:55.620> it

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
replaced and then hopefully we'll see it

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.350 
replaced and then hopefully we'll see it
working<00:00:56.039> quite<00:00:56.219> so<00:00:56.460> alright<00:00:56.879> looking<00:00:57.120> at<00:00:57.270> the

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
working quite so alright looking at the

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.150 
working quite so alright looking at the
area<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.870> work<00:00:58.020> with<00:00:58.289> now<00:00:58.590> we've<00:00:58.890> got<00:00:59.070> it

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
area to work with now we've got it

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.459 
area to work with now we've got it
cleaned<00:00:59.430> up<00:00:59.750> so<00:01:00.750> what<00:01:00.899> I'm<00:01:00.960> going<00:01:01.079> to<00:01:01.109> do<00:01:01.260> next

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
cleaned up so what I'm going to do next

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.729 
cleaned up so what I'm going to do next
is<00:01:01.890> just<00:01:02.219> put<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:03.260> the<00:01:04.260> connector<00:01:04.589> in<00:01:04.710> place

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
is just put the the connector in place

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.910 
is just put the the connector in place
then<00:01:05.489> we're<00:01:05.729> going<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:05.970> sold<00:01:06.390> it<00:01:06.570> down<00:01:06.920> by

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
then we're going to sold it down by

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.539 
then we're going to sold it down by
these<00:01:08.369> two<00:01:08.700> front<00:01:09.180> points<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:09.900> then<00:01:10.290> just<00:01:10.740> the

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
these two front points and then just the

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.240 
these two front points and then just the
pins<00:01:12.090> on<00:01:12.510> each<00:01:12.720> end<00:01:13.080> just<00:01:13.500> for<00:01:13.650> now<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:13.860> get<00:01:14.159> it

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
pins on each end just for now to get it

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.490 
pins on each end just for now to get it
all<00:01:14.400> in<00:01:14.549> place<00:01:14.790> to<00:01:15.509> make<00:01:15.630> sure<00:01:15.750> it's<00:01:15.900> all<00:01:16.049> solid

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
all in place to make sure it's all solid

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.190 
all in place to make sure it's all solid
and<00:01:16.710> ready<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.490> go<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:18.600> then<00:01:18.780> solder<00:01:19.140> in

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
and ready to go and then solder in

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.140 
and ready to go and then solder in
everything<00:01:19.680> else<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:20.100> rebuild<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.670> iPad<00:01:21.000> all

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
everything else and rebuild the iPad all

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.600 
everything else and rebuild the iPad all
right<00:01:21.299> then<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.630> connector<00:01:22.259> is<00:01:22.380> in<00:01:22.610> place

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
right then the connector is in place

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.539 
right then the connector is in place
it's<00:01:24.000> got<00:01:24.119> four<00:01:24.450> solder<00:01:24.869> joints<00:01:25.340> holding<00:01:26.340> it

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
it's got four solder joints holding it

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:32.120 
it's got four solder joints holding it
up<00:01:26.700> you<00:01:26.880> can<00:01:27.060> see<00:01:28.970> primarily<00:01:29.970> at<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.630> back<00:01:31.130> but

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
up you can see primarily at the back but

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.840 
up you can see primarily at the back but
most<00:01:32.310> silvery<00:01:32.880> colored<00:01:33.329> pens<00:01:34.320> each<00:01:34.710> end<00:01:35.070> I<00:01:35.310> was

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
most silvery colored pens each end I was

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.420 
most silvery colored pens each end I was
holding<00:01:36.119> it<00:01:36.210> in<00:01:36.420> place<00:01:36.960> so<00:01:37.290> I<00:01:37.439> can<00:01:37.740> nudge<00:01:38.189> it

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
holding it in place so I can nudge it

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.960 
holding it in place so I can nudge it
over<00:01:38.939> and<00:01:39.750> around<00:01:40.170> by<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.590> connector<00:01:41.130> now<00:01:41.250> so

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
over and around by the connector now so

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.300 
over and around by the connector now so
that's<00:01:42.119> all<00:01:42.270> good<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:42.689> I'm<00:01:43.320> going<00:01:43.560> to<00:01:43.680> just

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
that's all good and I'm going to just

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.210 
that's all good and I'm going to just
use<00:01:44.930> the<00:01:45.930> rest<00:01:46.170> of<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.380> pins<00:01:46.590> to<00:01:46.770> solder<00:01:47.009> it

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
use the rest of the pins to solder it

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.310 
use the rest of the pins to solder it
down<00:01:47.430> where<00:01:47.790> I<00:01:47.820> want<00:01:48.360> it's<00:01:48.570> done<00:01:48.750> will<00:01:49.020> rebuild

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
down where I want it's done will rebuild

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.539 
down where I want it's done will rebuild
the<00:01:49.500> archive<00:01:49.770> right<00:01:49.950> then<00:01:50.100> we've<00:01:50.220> got<00:01:50.399> the

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
the archive right then we've got the

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.550 
the archive right then we've got the
connect<00:01:51.000> to<00:01:51.210> end<00:01:51.450> as<00:01:51.780> you<00:01:51.990> can<00:01:52.170> see<00:01:52.380> we've

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
connect to end as you can see we've

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.410 
connect to end as you can see we've
cleaned<00:01:52.829> all<00:01:53.009> around<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.430> area<00:01:53.549> we'll<00:01:54.240> finish

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
cleaned all around the area we'll finish

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.410 
cleaned all around the area we'll finish
the<00:01:54.659> solder<00:01:55.079> it<00:01:55.170> it's<00:01:55.770> all<00:01:55.920> ready<00:01:56.159> to<00:01:56.219> go<00:01:56.520> all
