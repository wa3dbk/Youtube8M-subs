00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
team out of it it was too short the

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.040 
team out of it it was too short the
customer<00:00:54.989> would<00:00:55.140> pick<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.559> hand<00:00:55.800> set<00:00:56.070> up<00:00:56.280> and

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.360 
the the cord was not long enough so this

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.819 
the the cord was not long enough so this
is<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:01.070> curly<00:01:02.070> hardwired<00:01:03.319> handset<00:01:04.319> cord<00:01:04.649> that

and basically we hardwired it in also so

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.980 
and basically we hardwired it in also so
that's<00:01:37.930> all<00:01:38.170> hardwired<00:01:38.770> in<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:40.090> you<00:01:40.690> can't

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
that's all hardwired in and you can't

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:46.290 
that's all hardwired in and you can't
see<00:01:41.410> on<00:01:41.800> the<00:01:42.340> inside<00:01:42.630> you<00:01:43.630> have<00:01:44.170> a<00:01:45.120> new<00:01:46.120> show

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:46.300 
see on the inside you have a new show
