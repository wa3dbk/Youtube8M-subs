science for social good fellowship is

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.349 
science for social good fellowship is
really<00:01:00.750> to<00:01:00.930> take<00:01:01.170> data<00:01:01.469> scientist<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.359> train

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
really to take data scientist and train

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:04.939 
really to take data scientist and train
them<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.600> work<00:01:03.899> on<00:01:04.049> problems<00:01:04.350> that<00:01:04.619> actually

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
them to work on problems that actually

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.640 
them to work on problems that actually
matter<00:01:05.400> so<00:01:06.240> we<00:01:06.360> wanted<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.689> do<00:01:06.869> was<00:01:07.110> build<00:01:07.380> this

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
matter so we wanted to do was build this

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.920 
matter so we wanted to do was build this
hybrid<00:01:08.130> person<00:01:08.520> who<00:01:08.790> has<00:01:09.060> all<00:01:09.570> these

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
hybrid person who has all these

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.480

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
how to take real problems communicate

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.920 
how to take real problems communicate
with<00:01:13.439> people<00:01:13.680> about<00:01:14.520> those<00:01:14.760> problems<00:01:15.240> solve

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
with people about those problems solve

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.530 
with people about those problems solve
them<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.409> then<00:01:16.950> help<00:01:17.430> figure<00:01:17.970> out<00:01:18.150> a<00:01:18.180> way<00:01:18.479> to

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
them and then help figure out a way to

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.690 
them and then help figure out a way to
transfer<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:19.530> transition<00:01:20.130> those<00:01:20.340> solutions

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
transfer and transition those solutions

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.789

into<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.270> real<00:01:21.450> world<00:01:21.720> so<00:01:22.320> they<00:01:22.439> went<00:01:22.619> from

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
into the real world so they went from

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.249 
into the real world so they went from
