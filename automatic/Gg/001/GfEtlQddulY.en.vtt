00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:36.310 
but um I don't see why adding another
guard<00:00:34.039> couldn't<00:00:34.399> help<00:00:34.550> the<00:00:34.670> team<00:00:34.910> and<00:00:35.320> it's

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
school but I was I believed in what they

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.790 
school but I was I believed in what they
believed<00:04:08.040> in<00:04:08.310> loyalty<00:04:09.060> I'm<00:04:09.900> hard<00:04:10.200> work<00:04:10.500> and

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:10.800

believed in loyalty I'm hard work and
you<00:04:10.950> know<00:04:11.100> I'd<00:04:11.610> character<00:04:12.120> program<00:04:12.600> so<00:04:12.810> I

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.159 
and all I can do is keep working I tried
not<00:04:49.370> to<00:04:49.400> say<00:04:50.060> I'm<00:04:50.180> gonna<00:04:50.330> do<00:04:50.480> this<00:04:50.600> or<00:04:50.810> that<00:04:50.840> I

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:51.169 
not to say I'm gonna do this or that I

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:52.360 
not to say I'm gonna do this or that I
just<00:04:51.410> want<00:04:51.590> to<00:04:51.680> keep<00:04:51.770> working<00:04:52.010> and<00:04:52.220> getting

just want to keep working and getting

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.490 
just want to keep working and getting
better<00:04:52.550> and<00:04:52.880> you<00:04:53.630> know<00:04:53.690> see<00:04:53.990> where<00:04:54.080> it<00:04:54.200> take<00:04:54.350> me

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
better and you know see where it take me

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.140 
better and you know see where it take me
but<00:04:54.620> I<00:04:54.680> definitely<00:04:55.100> believe<00:04:55.700> that<00:04:55.760> gonna<00:04:56.000> be<00:04:56.090> a

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
but I definitely believe that gonna be a

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:01.510 
but I definitely believe that gonna be a
starting<00:04:56.450> point<00:04:56.510> door<00:05:00.220> yeah<00:05:01.220> I<00:05:01.280> could<00:05:01.400> play

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 
starting point door yeah I could play

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.000 
starting point door yeah I could play
off<00:05:01.669> the<00:05:01.790> ball<00:05:01.970> I<00:05:02.210> think<00:05:02.570> my<00:05:02.960> my<00:05:03.470> position<00:05:03.890> is

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.010 
off the ball I think my my position is

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:05.620 
off the ball I think my my position is
point<00:05:04.250> guard<00:05:04.460> and<00:05:04.700> definitely<00:05:05.120> a<00:05:05.180> point<00:05:05.419> guard

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:05.630 
point guard and definitely a point guard

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:08.409 
point guard and definitely a point guard
but<00:05:05.690> I<00:05:06.620> think<00:05:07.490> I<00:05:07.610> can<00:05:07.790> play<00:05:07.970> off<00:05:08.150> of<00:05:08.300> another

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:08.419 
but I think I can play off of another

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:10.450 
but I think I can play off of another
guard<00:05:08.840> as<00:05:08.990> well<00:05:09.230> or<00:05:09.620> I<00:05:09.650> don't<00:05:09.890> have<00:05:10.040> to<00:05:10.160> always

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.460 
guard as well or I don't have to always

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:13.000 
guard as well or I don't have to always
have<00:05:10.610> the<00:05:10.790> ball<00:05:11.000> in<00:05:11.030> my<00:05:11.240> hands<00:05:11.680> so<00:05:12.680> I<00:05:12.710> think

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:13.010 
have the ball in my hands so I think

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:14.560 
have the ball in my hands so I think
that<00:05:13.190> it<00:05:13.400> helps<00:05:13.520> when<00:05:13.760> you<00:05:13.880> can<00:05:14.090> you<00:05:14.419> don't

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:14.570 
that it helps when you can you don't

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:26.440 
that it helps when you can you don't
have<00:05:14.660> to<00:05:14.750> always<00:05:14.870> be<00:05:14.990> the<00:05:15.110> point<00:05:15.380> guard<00:05:25.450> and

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:26.450 
have to always be the point guard and

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:27.550 
have to always be the point guard and
well<00:05:26.630> being<00:05:26.780> off<00:05:26.930> the<00:05:26.960> board<00:05:27.260> doesn't

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:27.560 
well being off the board doesn't

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.469 
well being off the board doesn't
necessarily<00:05:28.550> mean<00:05:28.700> that<00:05:28.729> you<00:05:29.000> have<00:05:29.180> to<00:05:29.210> catch

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:29.479 
necessarily mean that you have to catch

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:31.540 
necessarily mean that you have to catch
a<00:05:29.570> shoot<00:05:29.840> I<00:05:30.050> think<00:05:30.470> for<00:05:30.770> me<00:05:30.950> it<00:05:31.070> would<00:05:31.190> just<00:05:31.370> be

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:31.550 
a shoot I think for me it would just be

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:33.670 
a shoot I think for me it would just be
being<00:05:32.510> able<00:05:32.660> to<00:05:32.810> move<00:05:33.020> better<00:05:33.290> without<00:05:33.530> the

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:33.680 
being able to move better without the

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.230 
being able to move better without the
ball<00:05:33.890> you<00:05:34.280> know<00:05:34.400> cuz<00:05:34.580> I'm<00:05:34.700> so<00:05:34.850> used<00:05:35.000> to<00:05:35.090> having

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.240 
ball you know cuz I'm so used to having

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.480 
ball you know cuz I'm so used to having
the<00:05:35.450> ball<00:05:35.630> in<00:05:35.660> my<00:05:35.870> hands<00:05:36.110> that<00:05:36.350> I<00:05:36.410> would<00:05:36.680> have

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:37.490 
the ball in my hands that I would have

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:39.940 
the ball in my hands that I would have
to<00:05:37.610> give<00:05:37.760> more<00:05:37.910> used<00:05:38.120> to<00:05:38.500> running<00:05:39.500> guys<00:05:39.680> off

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:39.950 
to give more used to running guys off

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:41.860 
to give more used to running guys off
the<00:05:40.070> screens<00:05:40.460> and<00:05:40.729> just<00:05:41.270> trying<00:05:41.720> to<00:05:41.780> stay

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:41.870 
the screens and just trying to stay

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:53.010 
the screens and just trying to stay
active<00:05:42.289> and<00:05:42.380> not<00:05:42.560> standing<00:05:43.039> around<00:05:43.100> watching

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:53.020 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:55.510 

I<00:05:54.020> think<00:05:54.260> I<00:05:54.380> would<00:05:54.560> have<00:05:54.680> to<00:05:54.800> come<00:05:55.010> in<00:05:55.220> and

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:55.520 
I think I would have to come in and

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:56.860 
I think I would have to come in and
accept<00:05:55.970> the<00:05:56.060> fact<00:05:56.090> that<00:05:56.330> I'm<00:05:56.479> on<00:05:56.570> the<00:05:56.690> team

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:56.870 
accept the fact that I'm on the team

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:58.600 
accept the fact that I'm on the team
with<00:05:57.050> veterans<00:05:57.470> so<00:05:57.650> I<00:05:57.710> don't<00:05:58.070> think<00:05:58.250> I'd<00:05:58.400> be

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:58.610 
with veterans so I don't think I'd be

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:00.580 
with veterans so I don't think I'd be
able<00:05:58.669> to<00:05:58.880> come<00:05:59.720> in<00:05:59.930> and<00:06:00.110> try<00:06:00.260> to<00:06:00.320> just

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:00.590 
able to come in and try to just

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:03.159 
able to come in and try to just
automatically<00:06:01.130> take<00:06:01.370> control<00:06:01.669> I<00:06:02.060> think<00:06:03.050> I

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:03.169 
automatically take control I think I

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:06.100 
automatically take control I think I
just<00:06:03.200> have<00:06:03.560> to<00:06:03.680> do<00:06:04.430> my<00:06:04.460> job<00:06:04.610> you<00:06:05.300> know<00:06:05.330> I<00:06:05.750> gotta

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:06.110 
just have to do my job you know I gotta

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:08.050
