00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:09.800
 so here we started first 

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:12.889
 courses for euro mini champ's here 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:17.360
 so there will be three the first stage 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:19.699
 here went well he was pretty 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:22.100
 complicated at first because there were some 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:24.210
 some who is not 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.770
 three weeks more 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:30.310
 between first two days 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:32.710
 it's hard and there they caught up they have 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.770
 caught up with the wagg so have 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.900
 because they give 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.180
 what they can 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:39.190
 my encouragement for the rest so the 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.900
 internship here as it's the first internship 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.100
 summer 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.270
 a bit more physical 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.190
 more there 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:49.040
 haweij outside the table and 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:53.570
 regular work on the exercises 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:55.500
 at the table and gradually on the 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.750
 internship we will have 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.100
 we're going to live more 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:03.730
 game phase match situation 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.610
 and more counting yet 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.650
 after to play 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:10.130
 match this is level 2 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.130
 of training 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:17.230
 so at the level of goals 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.750
 so we have yes players 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:20.220
 French 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.670
 Merlot thank you 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:26.900
 with at the level of the objectives are there 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.390
 quite different depending on the players 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.560
 we hope 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:34.970
 with adrien race in front and 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.040
 the Dalits do something good 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:40.190
 to see that miley that exceeds the teeth 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:44.990
 in his category with his fourth and 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:46.260
 that nothing in younger was 16th here 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.690
 low 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.850
 we did not set goals really 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.290
 I think 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:55.970
 it will be good to mesh this folder 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.120
 despite this finding says if she did not 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.340
 much played more 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:02.610
 injury but that's a goal he 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.830
 have to try to hold and adria I think 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.240
 that it would be good 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.240
 the top 8 here 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:13.610
 the others the first goal it will be 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.980
 to try to be in the 32 to know 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.920
 that the system of competition is 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.200
 quite complicated with a lot match at 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.410
 surveyed 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.910
 2-4 with the first three passing and 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.220
 so on it starts again on 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.910
 big who three- sided like that he 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.349
 must happen to physically hold 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.890
 on the length to be able to return 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:34.890
 in the 32 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.460
 after when we're in the 32's it's a 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:42.590
 table with knockout so that's it 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:45.250
 depends if a little of the draw are a 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.250
 bad draw 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:51.360
 very strong and after the elimination in 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.990
 play all the places did 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.830
 in 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:57.880
 Round of 16 played 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.460
 so here you go 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.940
 first goal for all 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:02.760
 it will be possible 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.420
 and for adrien 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:08.600
 10th 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.600
 you think 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.950
 we're going for me
