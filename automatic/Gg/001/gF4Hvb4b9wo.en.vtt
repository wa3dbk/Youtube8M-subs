it so I am here today I show you that
this<00:00:39.510> is<00:00:39.780> what<00:00:39.930> it<00:00:40.020> looks<00:00:40.140> like

00:00:59.709 --> 00:00:59.719 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:03.590 

all<00:01:00.719> right<00:01:01.019> let's<00:01:01.350> start<00:01:02.300> the<00:01:03.300> first<00:01:03.449> thing

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
all right let's start the first thing

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.850 
all right let's start the first thing
you<00:01:03.780> want<00:01:03.960> to<00:01:04.110> have<00:01:04.290> is<00:01:04.500> a<00:01:04.650> good<00:01:05.430> firm<00:01:05.759> grasp<00:01:06.150> on

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
you want to have is a good firm grasp on

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.740 
you want to have is a good firm grasp on
neither<00:01:07.860> bang<00:01:08.220> that<00:01:09.119> you<00:01:09.270> don't<00:01:09.570> know

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
neither bang that you don't know

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.530 
neither bang that you don't know
anything<00:01:09.990> I'm<00:01:10.590> sure<00:01:11.100> you<00:01:11.190> can<00:01:11.340> definitely

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 
anything I'm sure you can definitely

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.910 
anything I'm sure you can definitely
work<00:01:12.540> on<00:01:12.720> this<00:01:12.900> but<00:01:14.930> but<00:01:15.930> I<00:01:15.960> think<00:01:16.049> me<00:01:16.500> hooping

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
work on this but but I think me hooping

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.340 
work on this but but I think me hooping
would<00:01:17.549> be<00:01:17.700> helpful<00:01:18.149> just<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.960> sort<00:01:19.229> of

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
would be helpful just to sort of

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.889 
would be helpful just to sort of
understand<00:01:21.560> the<00:01:22.560> mechanics<00:01:22.830> of<00:01:23.369> how<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:24.570> leg

00:01:24.889 --> 00:01:24.899 
understand the mechanics of how the leg

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:28.100 
understand the mechanics of how the leg
is<00:01:25.140> moving<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:26.009> hoop<00:01:26.780> now<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.869> main

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
is moving the hoop now the main

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.969 
is moving the hoop now the main
difference<00:01:28.649> between<00:01:29.039> moving<00:01:30.080> and<00:01:31.080> lower<00:01:31.740> leg

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
difference between moving and lower leg

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.399 
difference between moving and lower leg
hooping<00:01:32.340> is<00:01:32.729> that<00:01:33.539> indeed<00:01:33.899> hoping<00:01:34.259> we're

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
hooping is that indeed hoping we're

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.309 
hooping is that indeed hoping we're
working<00:01:34.740> with<00:01:34.979> a<00:01:35.420> backward<00:01:36.420> forward<00:01:36.720> motion

00:01:37.309 --> 00:01:37.319 
working with a backward forward motion

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:39.469 
working with a backward forward motion
we're<00:01:38.069> pushing<00:01:38.280> forward<00:01:38.759> to<00:01:38.850> back<00:01:39.060> with<00:01:39.330> your

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
we're pushing forward to back with your

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:46.070 
we're pushing forward to back with your
leg<00:01:41.899> whereas<00:01:42.899> when<00:01:43.530> you<00:01:44.630> move<00:01:45.630> down<00:01:45.869> to

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080 
leg whereas when you move down to

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.680 
leg whereas when you move down to
hooping<00:01:46.380> on<00:01:46.500> your<00:01:46.649> lower<00:01:46.830> legs<00:01:47.690> you're

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:48.690 
hooping on your lower legs you're

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:56.529 
hooping on your lower legs you're
actually<00:01:49.080> working<00:01:49.640> in<00:01:50.640> circles<00:01:54.020> leg<00:01:55.020> circles

00:01:56.529 --> 00:01:56.539 
actually working in circles leg circles

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:01.070 
actually working in circles leg circles
all<00:01:57.539> right<00:01:57.720> so<00:01:58.319> what<00:01:59.009> you<00:01:59.130> want<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.429> do<00:01:59.640> is<00:02:00.119> you

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
all right so what you want to do is you

all right so what you want to do is you
can<00:02:01.259> start<00:02:01.500> cleaning<00:02:01.770> moving<00:02:02.780> that<00:02:03.780> might<00:02:03.929> be

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
can start cleaning moving that might be

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.139 
can start cleaning moving that might be
the<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.530> easiest<00:02:04.830> way<00:02:05.009> to<00:02:05.039> get<00:02:05.190> started<00:02:05.700> you

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
the the easiest way to get started you

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.139 
the the easiest way to get started you
can<00:02:06.450> bend<00:02:07.289> down<00:02:07.530> and<00:02:07.920> give<00:02:08.099> it<00:02:08.190> a<00:02:08.280> push<00:02:08.580> around

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
can bend down and give it a push around

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.550 
can bend down and give it a push around
your<00:02:09.300> calves<00:02:09.539> and<00:02:09.950> start<00:02:10.950> that<00:02:11.129> way<00:02:12.470> but<00:02:13.470> if

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
your calves and start that way but if

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.559 
your calves and start that way but if
you<00:02:13.709> know<00:02:13.830> anything<00:02:14.099> it<00:02:14.520> might<00:02:14.610> be<00:02:14.819> might<00:02:15.450> be

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
you know anything it might be might be

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.490 
you know anything it might be might be
easiest<00:02:15.870> to<00:02:15.989> start<00:02:16.050> cleaning<00:02:16.440> using<00:02:17.660> and<00:02:18.660> what

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
easiest to start cleaning using and what

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.110 
easiest to start cleaning using and what
you're<00:02:19.590> going<00:02:19.739> to<00:02:19.890> do<00:02:20.010> is<00:02:20.819> you're<00:02:21.030> gonna

you're going to do is you're gonna
you're<00:02:21.569> gonna<00:02:21.629> slow<00:02:22.379> down<00:02:22.560> your<00:02:22.709> new<00:02:22.830> hooping

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
you're gonna slow down your new hooping

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.920 
you're gonna slow down your new hooping
to<00:02:23.760> the<00:02:23.849> point<00:02:24.060> where<00:02:24.180> your<00:02:24.300> hoop<00:02:24.510> can<00:02:24.660> fall

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
to the point where your hoop can fall

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.800 
to the point where your hoop can fall
down<00:02:24.959> below<00:02:25.440> your<00:02:25.590> knees<00:02:26.360> once<00:02:27.360> it's<00:02:27.540> below

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
down below your knees once it's below

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.410 
down below your knees once it's below
your<00:02:27.840> knees<00:02:28.280> you're<00:02:29.280> going<00:02:29.519> to<00:02:29.670> plant<00:02:30.180> one

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
your knees you're going to plant one

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.420 
your knees you're going to plant one
foot<00:02:30.660> on<00:02:30.690> the<00:02:30.810> ground<00:02:31.010> pick<00:02:32.010> up<00:02:32.160> your<00:02:32.310> other

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
foot on the ground pick up your other

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.850 
foot on the ground pick up your other
foot<00:02:32.580> with<00:02:33.540> that<00:02:33.690> other<00:02:33.810> foot<00:02:34.230> you're<00:02:34.739> gonna

foot with that other foot you're gonna

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.619 
foot with that other foot you're gonna
start<00:02:35.220> making<00:02:35.430> little<00:02:35.819> circles<00:02:36.360> with<00:02:36.420> your

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:36.629 
start making little circles with your

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:41.990 
start making little circles with your
leg<00:02:36.810> I'm<00:02:37.470> exaggerating<00:02:40.190> so<00:02:41.190> what<00:02:41.879> you're

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
leg I'm exaggerating so what you're

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.210 
leg I'm exaggerating so what you're
gonna<00:02:42.060> do<00:02:42.300> is<00:02:42.450> I<00:02:42.599> who<00:02:42.800> counterclockwise<00:02:43.800> I

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
gonna do is I who counterclockwise I

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.240 
gonna do is I who counterclockwise I
move<00:02:44.400> to<00:02:44.519> the<00:02:44.610> left<00:02:44.819> so<00:02:45.690> when<00:02:45.959> I<00:02:45.989> pick<00:02:46.290> up<00:02:46.319> a<00:02:46.709> leg

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
move to the left so when I pick up a leg

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.030 
move to the left so when I pick up a leg
to<00:02:47.519> push<00:02:47.730> the<00:02:47.940> hoop<00:02:48.120> that<00:02:48.480> leg<00:02:49.319> is<00:02:49.620> going<00:02:49.830> to<00:02:49.890> go

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
to push the hoop that leg is going to go

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.790

the same direction you can turn around

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:06.500 
the same direction you can turn around
while<00:03:04.739> doing<00:03:04.980> this<00:03:05.069> just<00:03:06.030> like<00:03:06.180> a<00:03:06.210> lot<00:03:06.390> of

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
while doing this just like a lot of

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.480 
while doing this just like a lot of
other<00:03:06.630> moves<00:03:06.930> something<00:03:07.319> you<00:03:07.470> can<00:03:07.650> do<00:03:07.800> while

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
and and you can basically go from foot

and and you can basically go from foot
to<00:03:14.739> foot<00:03:15.180> so<00:03:16.180> rather<00:03:16.390> than<00:03:16.629> a<00:03:16.959> back-and-forth

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
to foot so rather than a back-and-forth

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.610 
you can do couple pushes on one leg

00:03:42.610 --> 00:04:02.100 
you can do couple pushes on one leg
loose<00:03:43.209> on<00:03:43.390> the<00:03:43.480> other<00:03:43.799> team<00:04:00.840> now<00:04:01.840> as<00:04:01.989> I

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.110 
loose on the other team now as I

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.259 
loose on the other team now as I
said<00:04:02.170> they're<00:04:02.670> one<00:04:03.670> way<00:04:03.819> of<00:04:03.940> getting<00:04:04.060> into

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:04.269 
said they're one way of getting into

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:06.089 
said they're one way of getting into
this<00:04:04.480> it<00:04:04.629> is<00:04:04.750> letting<00:04:05.349> it<00:04:05.500> drop<00:04:05.680> down<00:04:05.920> from

00:04:06.089 --> 00:04:06.099 
this it is letting it drop down from

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
slowing down to where it drops and then

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.409 
slowing down to where it drops and then
starting<00:04:14.290> your<00:04:14.380> push<00:04:14.530> it<00:04:14.970> the<00:04:15.970> other<00:04:16.000> way<00:04:16.359> to

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:16.419 
starting your push it the other way to

booty<00:04:25.240> pop<00:04:25.300> up<00:04:25.630> rather<00:04:26.500> than<00:04:26.800> taking<00:04:27.039> hard

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
booty pop up rather than taking hard
