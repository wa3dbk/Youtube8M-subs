00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
 Do you want to know more about bonsai? 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.009
 I can not only experience that 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.870
 cordially invite on a canal 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.410
 youtube over look because it gives it 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.910
 meanwhile a lot to see 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:14.089
 Hello and welcome today 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.580
 I'll get out of my sight 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:22.590
 say or tell what is there 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:24.810
 actually bonsai many really very 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.000
 many people experience that every day 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.650
 again, even if we are in the 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.179
 general was in particular the 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.219
 now probably also see each other 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.100
 bonsai already have one 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.260
 reached certain levels before I say 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.550
 the company leader employs what once a 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.649
 but dent is I say that now you 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.600
 the generality does not know what 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.480
 the thinking is everything 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.070
 plants that were bred in japan 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.170
 or china and then shipped 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:53.420
 to germany under those hardware stores 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:56.399
 are offered as so-called bonsai 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.410
 it is also bonn saw yes but it is 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.120
 not so now just plant these 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.329
 be offered there and in japan or 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.970
 China was also in Korea's other region 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.890
 were bred that its bonsai 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.220
 so and now we come to the topic bonn 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:15.270
 its what area of bonsai really is 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:18.450
 everything Mr. wood counts 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:21.600
 all especially suitable for us 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:26.009
 native trees like oak trees 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:28.080
 birch spruce pines and what else 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.079
 everything is there and that counts too 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.930
 shrubs such as forsythia or media 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.460
 or philadelphia or whatever else 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.710
 On shrubs you can go on so 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.420
 All really bonsai do what 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.170
 lignified and that goes for example too 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:46.799
 with lavender or with rosemary 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.780
 with other herbs also for wood 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.659
 So since this is also possible and there 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.100
 of course there are the trees that special 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.470
 are suitable or shrubs the 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.119
 especially suitable are the small ones 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.759
 Patrick are like ground cover to the 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.990
 example uniqa or cotoneaster or 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.789
 like, and these, of course, 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.159
 are especially for smaller want 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:08.280
 very suitable for small leaves 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:11.450
 have the times to the theme of what is now 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:15.959
 because actually is is symbolic 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:17.430
 translates tree in a pot or tree 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:21.230
 in a bowl 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:24.810
 where you have the root growth 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:27.989
 Shirt and the tree is not that strong 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:30.480
 can grow and also through regular 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:33.360
 cutting back and repotting these plants 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.670
 This bale is kept small 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.950
 And therefore, as I said growth already 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.069
 times inhibited and then through 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.370
 cutting measures on the tree itself 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:45.840
 this bonsai then kept small and 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.690
 accordingly brought into shape depending on 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.340
 which shape others specifically 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.400
 would like or what Baumann bought himself 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.769
 has and wants to get the form it gives 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.650
 countless forms and shapes of 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:59.940
 bonsai so from drooping like 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.100
 for example, on the cliffs or 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.260
 the same thing as an example 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.750
 can take or wind whipped like 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.970
 On the coast where the wind from the sea only ever 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.750
 one direction blows and the first one all 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:16.170
 are pressed to the side and 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:18.150
 Emerging trees the natural 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.280
 are designed again in the single 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.360
 So they do not grow as they do in the world 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.280
 Forest stand but like you 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.040
 for example, free somewhere on the 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.230
 field and stand there from habitus 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.930
 Of course you can also develop that way 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.160
 to recreate a tree and that 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:36.030
 everything as I said through cutting measures 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:38.819
 and by reducing the root-rich 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.390
 and thus you can always be so small 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:41.849
 hold 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:44.850
 That was such a short explanation now 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:46.560
 the theme of bonsai with people too 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.239
 Understand the bonsai never seen 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.510
 have what bonn its for ever 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:53.400
 everything else the theme is huge 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.350
 I can not do everything here now 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.140
 tell because then we sit here with 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:01.140
 safety ten hours together and that 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:03.209
 I do not want to do anything to anyone 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.160
 At some point I would do something special 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:08.459
 pick up what is now the style direction 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:10.560
 or the sizes of bonsai like 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:12.799
 which are called and such things and 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.810
 yes especially on the topic 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:19.440
 design and so much said that 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:21.329
 here was just a little scratched 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.310
 what bonsai is always on as I said 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:25.830
 bonsai is not coming from the hardware store and 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.660
 from japan and china but bonsai is 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.880
 now represented throughout europe 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.530
 and also the story of the bonsai of 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.479
 china japan to europe is one 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.680
 Giant story and I can do that too 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:36.590
 Now do not tell how that said 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.550
 would be completely out of the frame 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:41.070
 that was just short 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.760
 are scratched in the bonsai what is because 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:45.410
 bonn 3 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.410
 this year's crimmitschau 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.190
 Here I am what you are still 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.950
 I would like to recommend to you 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:55.380
 times in a bonsai tree school and 

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:57.870
 look at bonsai and there it is 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.580
 There has been a huge variety in Bonn since then 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:00.930
 so far is outdoor or indoor so 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:03.510
 room bonsai or bonsai the for 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.500
 are suitable outside and as I said the 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:07.200
 FIFA is huge 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:09.510
 Only in a nursery can you there 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.980
 really really look and look 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:13.530
 get inspired there 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:16.320
 I think that is definitely 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:18.090
 Worth even if you are the first time 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.650
 not just informs in books 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:27.410
 scroll but gives times a bonsai 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:27.410
 tree school is going to enjoy it all right 

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:31.480
 so 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:34.480
 really now 

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:34.480
 Hmmm 

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:44.199
 okay okay
