tight end got hurt and that's a mother
good<00:01:46.070> got<00:01:46.910> some<00:01:47.090> decent<00:01:47.240> drives<00:01:47.630> I<00:01:47.750> think<00:01:47.780> we

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
good got some decent drives I think we

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.540 
good got some decent drives I think we
ran<00:01:48.140> the<00:01:48.289> ball<00:01:48.440> for<00:01:48.619> 200<00:01:48.770> some<00:01:49.100> yards<00:01:49.429> were

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:49.550 
ran the ball for 200 some yards were

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.790 
ran the ball for 200 some yards were
just<00:01:49.759> really<00:01:50.479> ineffective<00:01:50.960> in<00:01:51.289> certain<00:01:51.590> area

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:51.800 
just really ineffective in certain area

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.830 
just really ineffective in certain area
it's<00:01:51.920> really<00:01:52.220> really<00:01:52.550> ineffective<00:01:52.940> so<00:01:53.420> that's

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
it's really really ineffective so that's

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.389 
it's really really ineffective so that's
because<00:01:54.200> of<00:01:54.320> three<00:01:54.530> quarterbacks<00:01:55.039> will<00:01:55.190> blow

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880

we're certainly not at Ground Zero by
