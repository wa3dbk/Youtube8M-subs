00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:08.120
 calculate the generating fraction of 

00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:12.610
 number 0.25 period as we know this is 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.610
 a periodic number and what it means 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.240
 the period it means that what 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.920
 appears in the period repeats 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:24.329
 indefinitely we will already have 0.25 and 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:26.570
 now 25 repeats indefinitely never 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:26.570
 we finish 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:33.830
 as we know a periodic decimal number 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:37.160
 is a rational number, that is, it can be 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:40.550
 express as a fraction and we will look 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:43.640
 the fraction generating the fraction 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.720
 irreducible that represents this number 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.800
 decimal 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.220
 our case to be a periodic number 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.650
 pure 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:54.670
 what it means is that the period 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:57.770
 start exactly next to the comma 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:01.470
 then it is a periodic decimal number 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:05.990
 pure the procedure is as follows 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.990
 we call this number xa 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.010
 and then we want to get x equal to 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.000
 a fraction 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:20.600
 and now we multiply in the two parts 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.060
 of equality by 1 followed by so many 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:28.520
 figures as has period we observe that 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:31.490
 the period has single and double digit percentage points 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:34.760
 so multiply by 12 figures 20 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:38.510
 In both parts 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:42.860
 same now we multiply 0.25 period 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:44.660
 by 100 as two zeros appear 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.980
 we go down where I have the expression 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:50.250
 of the number 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:53.730
 without the period then the coma until 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:56.070
 here it would happen as two zeros are two 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:59.180
 figures to the right or the comma 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.180
 would appear here 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:05.470
 and that as we see we can remove this 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:09.720
 zero as it is ahead of the number 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:16.330
 those 25 that is in front of the coma coma 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:18.340
 25 25 25 25 will be twenty-five period 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.830
 that would be the result of multiplying 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.220
 100 for 0.25 period that we put here 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.220
 above 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:29.140
 we multiply by one followed by so many 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.760
 zero numbers of as many zero as 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.360
 figures has period and this we copy 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.530
 down 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:38.780
 ok so we copied x same as it was 025 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:43.190
 period we put the comma in it 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:46.120
 position that is up 025 period 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.120
 and now we subtract 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:52.030
 100 xx 99 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:58.340
 and now 25 25 period minus 025 period 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:01.250
 period and period goes away because it's the 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.490
 same in decimals evans and 25 - of 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:06.490
 euro every 25 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:08.440
 yesterday simply 99 is multiplying 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:11.160
 the X passes to the other part dividing 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:15.040
 and we get that x would be equal to 25 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:18.220
 match 99 if we try to simplify 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:21.100
 this fraction 25 parties 99 up 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:27.790
 we will have 25 5 by 5 or 5 squared 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:30.100
 and 99 is 9 times 11 would be 3 times 3 which is 9 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.330
 by 11 as we see here you can not 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.540
 We have already obtained the 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:36.820
 decomposition into numbers products 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.680
 cousins of the denominating numerators 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.990
 we can not cross any then this 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:44.050
 irreducible fractions would be the fraction 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:50.010
 Generator of the initial number 0.25 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:50.010
 periods 25 match of 99
