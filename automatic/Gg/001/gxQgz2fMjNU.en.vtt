00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:11.929
 he liked it's nice to do a 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.710
 new video 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:16.049
 today we find ourselves for the 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.650
 cooperation of religion to control and 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:22.050
 of the fihg control have you so have the 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.609
 hate and install the boxes so the 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.609
 aerf box the boot of instinct 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:31.890
 firstly very very big difference 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:35.160
 size still must say so 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.040
 this is the r so the r I put a hand 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.059
 nothing on control buttons 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.280
 the moment I put a hand almost on 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:46.789
 all the platinum 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:50.309
 so here's next level connectivity 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:54.480
 on the r connectivity level that headphone 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:56.219
 we have a jack connection 6 35 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.780
 so for those who do not know it's 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.710
 like on the wings and on the amp of 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.210
 electric guitar whose very good voice 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.090
 because if you have a case that 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.840
 is not very recent or even a headset 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:12.030
 recent but at a jack output 6 35 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.650
 you can plug it in without 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.420
 buy adapters and if you have 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.360
 a modern platinum helmet is sold 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:24.110
 with an adapter so then on 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.110
 their instincts we have a jack input 3 5 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:30.540
 then connectivity level that pregnant 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:37.020
 on the r just on a connector 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:40.140
 jack 3.5 while on instinct 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.390
 we have a jack connectivity 3.5 but 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:51.119
 as connective enough to what is a 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:56.729
 very good point so not then and finally 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:58.290
 in short the features found 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.460
 pretty much the same features it 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.460
 there is not much that changes 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.890
 except that at the moment we can 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.570
 listen in listening what can we 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.840
 listen to the deck and the deck but 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.940
 at the same time where cases where guides 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.010
 and separately while I follow the r 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.150
 can only listen to the dk or the baby 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.190
 is not both at the same time so that's 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.220
 it's a point here it's not very 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.220
 serious 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:26.560
 then on the r for the pitch we have 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.510
 little little buttons like that I know 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.710
 not what is called the dials 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.600
 no I did not do a brief 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:34.209
 so that's pretty practical to fix 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:37.090
 pitch not while on instinct 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.080
 it's a little strong button like that one 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.690
 will call it like that but a lot 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:46.120
 stronger is not appreciated at all 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:49.240
 So then that's what's changed 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.310
 ben milot level level with valves the 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:54.220
 job of the aer is really bigger 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.000
 than that of instinct the buttons of 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.900
 facts 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:02.770
 it's on the r's are tam buttons 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:06.750
 in ger felt 1-4 while I'm in 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:17.890
 for a moment they are push buttons 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:25.120
 So then this is what is it that 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:27.070
 yes then the on the r change 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.570
 the modes is either less luz where the 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:31.330
 word of facts are simple 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:35.290
 while on the instinct which is 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:37.870
 Well, that's the way luz mode chooses 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.730
 simple and a fourth mode that does not 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.519
 will not show up here it's cloud mode 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.260
 to have four hot tubs while on 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:45.340
 This mode will not be displayed because 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.959
 we will choose the modes 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.670
 here there is no fourth mode so 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:49.840
 it's a symbol a little bit 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:57.130
 annoying anyway because it's 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:04:00.700
 quite practical then are there if you 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:03.040
 put your turntable on virtual dj there 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.560
 here you can choose the facts with 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.280
 his two little touches there so that's 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.579
 quite practical 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.350
 while on the instinct you can 

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:12.240
 not do that 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.940
 so that's a point a little bit 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:18.390
 annoying finally brief 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:20.430
 then at the disposal level of the 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:21.720
 platinum there are some little tricks that 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.250
 change so for example tower 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.380
 synchronized and search it's at 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.990
 above while there is below the 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.850
 beach there it's above the pitch so 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.910
 the breaks blow all that there is nothing 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.920
 who changes the layout of the name that 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.930
 exchange 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:39.660
 the buttons after that there is nothing that 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.490
 changes but also I forgot about 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.740
 hercules dj against the eire there is what we 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.620
 call a time control so more 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.450
 you will approach your hand more 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:50.910
 the effect will activate 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:52.170
 so I think too much of what it was used for 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:54.600
 you know well due in my opinion in the 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:58.760
 comments I believe it's for 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.760
 adjust the intensity of the effects finally brief 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:05.880
 this is gentlemen the moment it's a very 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:09.030
 good platinum to start except 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:12.390
 consume a little bit the fingers when 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:14.070
 we start to really mix because 

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:15.930
 the buttons are a little too close 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:17.670
 I find as for the end effects 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.490
 here in the dark that she does not know 

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:22.920
 always practical 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:25.770
 about that on the r has a setting 

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:27.090
 of the brightness of the backlight so 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.800
 it does not work out you can it works 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:35.490
 still a little bit that's it 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:36.510
 well here is so yes platinum instinct 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:36.960
 that I recommend to those who want 

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:38.940
 start 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:41.970
 me when I bought this platinum and 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:45.240
 it was 4 3 420 I believe in 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:46.650
 three four months finally short I started 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.570
 I really had never me 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:51.600
 proud I had always chained the 

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:55.050
 songs on computer so that's it 

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:56.840
 allowed me to acquire the basics and that's 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:58.020
 frankly good we for those who 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:00.200
 start 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:03.450
 I really recommend this platinum 

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:05.100
 month for now I'm training a 

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:07.950
 little more so I took this platinum to 

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:11.640
 the r which is that there is a bigger 

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:13.790
 work surface so that is more 

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:13.790
 convenient
