00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.910 
think this is like for the dota 2
community<00:00:57.660> I<00:00:57.870> think<00:00:58.410> it's<00:00:58.530> pretty<00:00:58.649> big

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
community I think it's pretty big

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.650 
community I think it's pretty big
because<00:00:59.160> I<00:00:59.309> started<00:00:59.760> when<00:01:00.059> is<00:01:00.329> one<00:01:00.480> of<00:01:00.570> the

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
because I started when is one of the

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:01.760 
because I started when is one of the
biggest<00:01:00.870> tournaments<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:01.590> 10th

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
biggest tournaments and 10th

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.349 
biggest tournaments and 10th
international<00:01:01.980> tournaments<00:01:02.730> in<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.180> world

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
international tournaments in the world

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.479

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
right now for a daughter so I think it's

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.210 
right now for a daughter so I think it's
really<00:01:05.640> big<00:01:05.850> that<00:01:06.030> a<00:01:06.710> stolid<00:01:07.710> expense<00:01:08.070> to

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
really big that a stolid expense to

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.160 
really big that a stolid expense to
Korea<00:01:08.460> is<00:01:08.670> going<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:08.939> push<00:01:09.240> crews<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.720> practice

Korea is going to push crews to practice

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.560 
Korea is going to push crews to practice
more<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.409> like<00:01:10.710> it's<00:01:11.400> gonna<00:01:11.520> give<00:01:12.390> them<00:01:12.510> a

more and like it's gonna give them a

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.060 
more and like it's gonna give them a
reason<00:01:12.689> to<00:01:12.900> practice<00:01:13.290> harder<00:01:13.590> you<00:01:13.710> know<00:01:13.740> and

chance

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
chance

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.780 
chance
we're<00:01:32.450> doing<00:01:32.630> pretty<00:01:32.659> well<00:01:33.369> revealing<00:01:34.369> top

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
we're doing pretty well revealing top

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.429 
we're doing pretty well revealing top
teams<00:01:35.030> we<00:01:35.420> play<00:01:35.600> evenly<00:01:35.930> with<00:01:36.049> them<00:01:36.200> so

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:36.439 
teams we play evenly with them so

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:38.830 
teams we play evenly with them so
pressure<00:01:37.189> as<00:01:37.790> long<00:01:37.970> as<00:01:38.060> we<00:01:38.180> play<00:01:38.299> well<00:01:38.540> we

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
pressure as long as we play well we

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.920 
pressure as long as we play well we
won't<00:01:38.960> choke<00:01:39.580> we<00:01:40.580> should<00:01:40.759> be<00:01:40.850> able<00:01:40.940> to<00:01:41.180> get<00:01:41.810> to

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
won't choke we should be able to get to

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:43.330 
won't choke we should be able to get to
the<00:01:42.020> finals<00:01:42.350> eventually<00:01:42.770> written<00:01:43.070> I<00:01:43.159> think

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
the finals eventually written I think

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:44.859 
the finals eventually written I think
today<00:01:43.580> is<00:01:43.729> very<00:01:43.909> important<00:01:44.270> so<00:01:44.420> I<00:01:44.479> think<00:01:44.810> if

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
today is very important so I think if

Phoenix and for you guys who have been
following<00:02:02.500> this<00:02:03.500> is<00:02:03.649> a<00:02:03.680> new<00:02:03.920> team<00:02:04.220> for<00:02:04.490> him

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
following this is a new team for him

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.149 
following this is a new team for him
first<00:02:05.810> off<00:02:05.990> what's<00:02:06.259> it<00:02:06.380> like<00:02:06.440> to<00:02:06.679> be<00:02:06.860> playing

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
first off what's it like to be playing

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:09.669 
first off what's it like to be playing
for<00:02:07.399> a<00:02:07.460> team<00:02:07.640> other<00:02:08.090> than<00:02:08.300> five<00:02:08.630> in<00:02:08.810> cubes<00:02:09.080> um<00:02:09.289> I

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
for a team other than five in cubes um I

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.770 
for a team other than five in cubes um I
think<00:02:09.709> MVP<00:02:10.519> Phoenix<00:02:10.910> has<00:02:11.360> much<00:02:11.750> more

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
think MVP Phoenix has much more

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.380 
think MVP Phoenix has much more
comfortable<00:02:12.440> with<00:02:12.620> it<00:02:12.800> so<00:02:13.130> I<00:02:13.160> feel<00:02:13.910> much<00:02:14.180> more

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
comfortable with it so I feel much more

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.920 
comfortable with it so I feel much more
safe<00:02:14.720> and<00:02:15.050> much<00:02:15.590> more<00:02:15.830> enjoy<00:02:16.220> so<00:02:17.120> I<00:02:17.510> think

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
safe and much more enjoy so I think

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.800 
safe and much more enjoy so I think
every<00:02:18.680> p<00:02:18.800> Phoenix<00:02:19.190> is<00:02:19.340> more<00:02:19.760> better<00:02:20.690> than

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
every p Phoenix is more better than

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.920 
every p Phoenix is more better than
