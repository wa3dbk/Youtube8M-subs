tame<00:01:37.140> this<00:01:37.409> thing<00:01:37.710> so<00:01:38.130> now<00:01:38.340> it's<00:01:38.549> about<00:01:38.640> that

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
tame this thing so now it's about that

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.789 
tame this thing so now it's about that

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
unlocks in the DMR category now you can

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.420 
unlocks in the DMR category now you can
see<00:01:49.020> that<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.320> scar-h<00:01:49.590> is<00:01:49.950> almost<00:01:50.220> identical

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
see that the scar-h is almost identical

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.389 
see that the scar-h is almost identical

too big of a difference but the big deal

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.920 
too big of a difference but the big deal
is<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:04.439> 26<00:02:04.979> rounds<00:02:05.520> in<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.790> ace<00:02:05.939> 53<00:02:06.750> that

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
/ mag that means a lot in this game and

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.360 
/ mag that means a lot in this game and
should<00:02:17.640> not<00:02:17.910> be<00:02:18.150> looked<00:02:18.510> upon<00:02:18.830> lightly<00:02:19.830> on<00:02:20.099> top

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
should not be looked upon lightly on top

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.160 
should not be looked upon lightly on top
of<00:02:20.520> that<00:02:20.610> you<00:02:20.760> can<00:02:20.880> see<00:02:20.970> the<00:02:21.090> SKS<00:02:21.599> has<00:02:21.810> a<00:02:21.840> much

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
of that you can see the SKS has a much

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.260 
of that you can see the SKS has a much
better<00:02:22.349> fire<00:02:22.770> rate<00:02:23.130> but<00:02:23.160> again<00:02:23.640> even<00:02:24.000> then

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
better fire rate but again even then

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:25.880 
better fire rate but again even then
it's<00:02:24.510> not<00:02:24.720> gonna<00:02:24.900> stand<00:02:25.200> up<00:02:25.380> to<00:02:25.500> most<00:02:25.709> of<00:02:25.830> the

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
it's not gonna stand up to most of the

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.410 
it's not gonna stand up to most of the
other<00:02:26.010> carbines<00:02:26.489> and<00:02:26.640> assault<00:02:26.730> rifles<00:02:27.000> in<00:02:27.360> the

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
other carbines and assault rifles in the

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.270 
other carbines and assault rifles in the
game<00:02:27.630> so<00:02:27.810> I<00:02:27.840> think<00:02:27.959> with<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:28.709> slightly<00:02:28.980> less

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
game so I think with the slightly less

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.880 
game so I think with the slightly less
damage<00:02:29.849> the<00:02:30.030> SKS<00:02:30.480> has<00:02:30.750> the<00:02:31.200> rate<00:02:31.530> of<00:02:31.680> fire<00:02:31.860> I

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
damage the SKS has the rate of fire I

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.590 
damage the SKS has the rate of fire I
don't<00:02:32.190> really<00:02:32.370> think<00:02:32.459> compensates<00:02:33.300> for<00:02:33.390> that

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
don't really think compensates for that

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:34.729 
don't really think compensates for that
because<00:02:33.810> you're<00:02:33.900> gonna<00:02:33.959> run<00:02:34.230> into<00:02:34.260> a<00:02:34.470> lot<00:02:34.709> more

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
because you're gonna run into a lot more

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:37.160 
because you're gonna run into a lot more
for<00:02:35.459> time<00:02:35.760> to<00:02:36.000> kill<00:02:36.239> for<00:02:36.600> shot<00:02:36.870> to<00:02:37.020> kill

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
for time to kill for shot to kill

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.170 
for time to kill for shot to kill
situations<00:02:37.830> in<00:02:37.920> you<00:02:38.040> would<00:02:38.160> with<00:02:38.310> the<00:02:38.370> ACE<00:02:38.520> 53

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
situations in you would with the ACE 53

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.559

that<00:02:42.720> basically<00:02:43.080> performs<00:02:43.560> only

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
that basically performs only

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.040 
that basically performs only
consistently<00:02:44.880> in<00:02:45.060> medium<00:02:45.480> range<00:02:45.720> you're

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
consistently in medium range you're

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.600 
consistently in medium range you're
gonna<00:02:46.140> find<00:02:46.440> yourself<00:02:46.590> not<00:02:47.100> wanting<00:02:47.430> to<00:02:47.519> use

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
gonna find yourself not wanting to use

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
the SKS over this weapon so now you've

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.009 
the SKS over this weapon so now you've
seen<00:02:49.980> how<00:02:50.430> it<00:02:50.459> stacks<00:02:50.880> up<00:02:51.150> statistically<00:02:51.930> to

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
seen how it stacks up statistically to

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:53.240 
seen how it stacks up statistically to
the<00:02:52.140> other<00:02:52.260> ones<00:02:52.470> in<00:02:52.620> there<00:02:52.709> now<00:02:52.920> let's<00:02:53.130> talk

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
the other ones in there now let's talk

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.190 
the other ones in there now let's talk
about<00:02:53.310> the<00:02:53.760> fields<00:02:54.360> how<00:02:54.510> we<00:02:54.569> feel<00:02:54.900> let's<00:02:55.080> open

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
about the fields how we feel let's open

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.740 
about the fields how we feel let's open

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
up the song about our feelings this gum

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.710 
up the song about our feelings this gum
is<00:02:57.900> the<00:02:58.440> only<00:02:58.739> let<00:02:59.280> me<00:02:59.370> repeat<00:02:59.640> the<00:02:59.700> only<00:03:00.299> DMR

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
is the only let me repeat the only DMR

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.360 
is the only let me repeat the only DMR
that<00:03:00.930> I<00:03:00.959> use<00:03:01.290> the<00:03:01.470> only<00:03:01.709> one<00:03:01.860> that<00:03:01.980> is<00:03:02.100> worth

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
that I use the only one that is worth

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.580 
that I use the only one that is worth
using<00:03:02.640> in<00:03:02.910> my<00:03:03.060> opinion<00:03:03.480> the<00:03:03.569> scar-h<00:03:03.840> sv<00:03:04.350> is<00:03:04.500> a

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
using in my opinion the scar-h sv is a

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.090 
using in my opinion the scar-h sv is a
close<00:03:05.280> second<00:03:05.760> and<00:03:05.790> I<00:03:05.940> mean<00:03:05.970> a<00:03:06.209> close<00:03:07.069> second

distance just makes me moist in so many

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:07.460 
distance just makes me moist in so many
ways<00:04:05.760> it's<00:04:06.030> absolutely<00:04:06.600> beautiful<00:04:06.810> on<00:04:07.140> top<00:04:07.350> of

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
ways it's absolutely beautiful on top of

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.190 
ways it's absolutely beautiful on top of
that<00:04:07.560> is<00:04:07.739> its<00:04:07.920> ammo<00:04:08.250> capacity<00:04:08.600> sitting<00:04:09.600> at<00:04:09.690> 26

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
that is its ammo capacity sitting at 26

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.080 
that is its ammo capacity sitting at 26
shots<00:04:10.380> is<00:04:10.620> very<00:04:10.829> very<00:04:11.100> impressive<00:04:11.819> in<00:04:11.970> the

shots is very very impressive in the

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.270

category<00:04:12.569> to<00:04:12.750> match<00:04:12.959> and<00:04:13.290> compensate<00:04:13.950> for<00:04:14.160> the

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
category to match and compensate for the

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.430 
category to match and compensate for the
slow<00:04:14.430> rate<00:04:14.609> of<00:04:14.639> fire<00:04:14.760> but<00:04:15.540> also<00:04:15.720> to<00:04:16.289> go

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
slow rate of fire but also to go

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.759 
slow rate of fire but also to go
alongside<00:04:16.769> with<00:04:17.430> the<00:04:17.700> crazy<00:04:18.060> crazy<00:04:18.810> amount<00:04:19.650> of

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
alongside with the crazy crazy amount of

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:21.440 
alongside with the crazy crazy amount of
damage<00:04:20.039> that<00:04:20.160> this<00:04:20.310> gun<00:04:20.489> holds<00:04:20.820> on<00:04:20.940> to<00:04:21.120> over

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
damage that this gun holds on to over

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.529 
damage that this gun holds on to over
range<00:04:21.690> now<00:04:22.380> the<00:04:22.440> one<00:04:22.710> big<00:04:23.130> drawback<00:04:23.490> and<00:04:24.000> it's

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:24.539 
range now the one big drawback and it's

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:26.960 
range now the one big drawback and it's
the<00:04:24.690> same<00:04:24.900> one<00:04:25.110> that<00:04:25.169> every<00:04:25.740> one<00:04:26.039> of<00:04:26.280> the<00:04:26.550> DMR's

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
the same one that every one of the DMR's

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:27.470 
the same one that every one of the DMR's
really

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
really

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.480 
really
is<00:04:27.780> this<00:04:27.960> just<00:04:28.200> not<00:04:28.350> good<00:04:28.680> at<00:04:28.800> close<00:04:28.980> quarters

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
is this just not good at close quarters

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.700 
is this just not good at close quarters
so<00:04:29.970> my<00:04:30.180> high<00:04:30.480> recommendation<00:04:31.290> for<00:04:31.440> you<00:04:31.530> guys

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
so my high recommendation for you guys

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.340 
so my high recommendation for you guys
is<00:04:31.980> to<00:04:32.010> find<00:04:32.460> a<00:04:32.670> a<00:04:33.060> corner<00:04:33.600> cutting<00:04:33.810> weapon<00:04:34.230> and

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
is to find a a corner cutting weapon and

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:35.600 
is to find a a corner cutting weapon and
what<00:04:34.440> I<00:04:34.470> mean<00:04:34.680> by<00:04:34.740> that<00:04:34.890> is<00:04:35.190> something<00:04:35.460> that

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
what I mean by that is something that

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.790 
what I mean by that is something that
you<00:04:35.700> can<00:04:35.850> be<00:04:35.970> confident<00:04:36.450> in<00:04:36.600> as<00:04:36.750> a<00:04:36.800> secondary

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
you can be confident in as a secondary

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.100 
you can be confident in as a secondary
or<00:04:38.100> an<00:04:38.250> equipment<00:04:38.640> weapon<00:04:39.210> that<00:04:39.780> you<00:04:39.930> can

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
or an equipment weapon that you can

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.470 
or an equipment weapon that you can
dominate<00:04:40.350> people<00:04:40.800> with<00:04:41.070> my<00:04:41.340> example<00:04:41.760> being<00:04:42.120> is

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:42.480 
dominate people with my example being is

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.000 
dominate people with my example being is
something<00:04:42.930> like<00:04:43.020> the<00:04:43.200> shorty<00:04:43.560> being<00:04:43.770> a<00:04:43.830> great

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
something like the shorty being a great

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:45.950 
something like the shorty being a great
secondary<00:04:44.550> if<00:04:44.730> you<00:04:44.820> have<00:04:45.000> something<00:04:45.300> like<00:04:45.510> the

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
secondary if you have something like the

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.060 
secondary if you have something like the
medical<00:04:46.380> ash<00:04:46.440> you<00:04:46.560> don't<00:04:46.710> want<00:04:46.830> to<00:04:46.890> use<00:04:46.980> the

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
medical ash you don't want to use the

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.100 
medical ash you don't want to use the
dart<00:04:47.340> or<00:04:47.520> something<00:04:47.790> like<00:04:47.940> that<00:04:48.150> go<00:04:48.660> ahead<00:04:48.690> and

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
dart or something like that go ahead and

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:50.900 
dart or something like that go ahead and
use<00:04:49.290> that<00:04:49.320> now<00:04:49.740> if<00:04:49.830> you're<00:04:49.950> using<00:04:49.980> support<00:04:50.550> the

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910 
use that now if you're using support the

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:53.120 
use that now if you're using support the
xm25<00:04:51.210> dart<00:04:51.780> is<00:04:51.930> pretty<00:04:52.140> good<00:04:52.350> stuff<00:04:52.620> like<00:04:52.920> that

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
xm25 dart is pretty good stuff like that

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:54.290 
xm25 dart is pretty good stuff like that
you<00:04:53.280> want<00:04:53.490> to<00:04:53.580> have<00:04:53.700> something<00:04:53.940> you<00:04:54.060> could<00:04:54.210> do

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
you want to have something you could do

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.180 
you want to have something you could do
that<00:04:54.420> with<00:04:54.570> so<00:04:54.990> what<00:04:55.110> I'm<00:04:55.230> actually<00:04:55.560> having<00:04:55.980> to

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
that with so what I'm actually having to

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:57.830 
that with so what I'm actually having to
push<00:04:56.430> myself<00:04:56.670> into<00:04:57.090> close<00:04:57.270> quarters<00:04:57.630> I<00:04:57.780> know

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
push myself into close quarters I know

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.660 
push myself into close quarters I know
I'm<00:04:58.170> gonna<00:04:58.290> lose<00:04:58.500> a<00:04:58.560> gunfight<00:04:59.040> every<00:04:59.430> time

00:04:59.660 --> 00:04:59.670 
I'm gonna lose a gunfight every time

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:01.070 
I'm gonna lose a gunfight every time
they<00:04:59.880> get<00:05:00.030> all<00:05:00.150> three<00:05:00.420> bullets<00:05:00.750> for<00:05:00.870> every

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
they get all three bullets for every

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.840 
they get all three bullets for every
bullet<00:05:01.230> I<00:05:01.440> get<00:05:01.680> off<00:05:01.800> and<00:05:02.010> that<00:05:02.400> basically

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:02.850 
bullet I get off and that basically

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:04.730 
bullet I get off and that basically
scales<00:05:03.270> double<00:05:03.750> the<00:05:03.870> damage<00:05:04.230> they<00:05:04.410> can<00:05:04.470> put

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
scales double the damage they can put

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.080 
scales double the damage they can put
into<00:05:04.860> me<00:05:05.070> before<00:05:05.400> I<00:05:05.430> could<00:05:05.640> put<00:05:05.760> into<00:05:05.910> them

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
into me before I could put into them

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.120 
into me before I could put into them
therefore<00:05:06.660> I'm<00:05:07.110> gonna<00:05:07.350> lose<00:05:07.590> every<00:05:07.920> close

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
therefore I'm gonna lose every close

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:09.050 
therefore I'm gonna lose every close
quarter<00:05:08.460> gunfight

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 
quarter gunfight

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.660 
quarter gunfight
against<00:05:09.930> any<00:05:10.170> competent<00:05:10.830> person<00:05:11.400> with<00:05:11.550> you

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:11.670 
against any competent person with you

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:13.790 
against any competent person with you
know<00:05:11.790> hands<00:05:12.000> eyes<00:05:12.210> and<00:05:12.480> is<00:05:12.630> living<00:05:12.960> it's<00:05:13.650> just

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 
know hands eyes and is living it's just

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.130 
know hands eyes and is living it's just
not<00:05:13.950> gonna<00:05:14.100> happen<00:05:14.340> so<00:05:14.730> my<00:05:15.300> recommendation<00:05:15.990> is

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:16.140 
not gonna happen so my recommendation is

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:18.110 
not gonna happen so my recommendation is
find<00:05:16.380> a<00:05:16.530> nice<00:05:16.710> complementary<00:05:17.340> secondary<00:05:17.910> like

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
find a nice complementary secondary like

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.030 
find a nice complementary secondary like
the<00:05:18.330> g18<00:05:18.840> if<00:05:19.170> you're<00:05:19.290> good<00:05:19.410> with<00:05:19.560> it<00:05:19.590> something

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:20.040 
the g18 if you're good with it something

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.590 
the g18 if you're good with it something
like<00:05:20.070> that<00:05:20.190> they<00:05:20.460> can<00:05:20.490> actually<00:05:20.910> kill<00:05:21.570> people

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:21.600 
like that they can actually kill people

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.320 
like that they can actually kill people
as<00:05:22.110> if<00:05:22.560> it<00:05:22.650> was<00:05:22.770> a<00:05:22.800> close<00:05:23.010> quarters<00:05:23.280> primary<00:05:23.850> so

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:24.330 
as if it was a close quarters primary so

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.630 
as if it was a close quarters primary so
that's<00:05:24.540> one<00:05:24.720> big<00:05:24.750> advantage<00:05:25.620> one<00:05:26.130> big<00:05:26.400> piece

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:26.640 
that's one big advantage one big piece

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:27.980 
that's one big advantage one big piece
of<00:05:26.700> advice<00:05:26.880> I<00:05:27.270> can<00:05:27.330> give<00:05:27.540> you<00:05:27.660> guys<00:05:27.810> while

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:27.990 
of advice I can give you guys while

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:29.540 
of advice I can give you guys while
using<00:05:28.200> this<00:05:28.410> because<00:05:28.740> again<00:05:29.010> it<00:05:29.370> just

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:29.550 
using this because again it just

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:30.890 
using this because again it just
dominates<00:05:29.970> everything<00:05:30.300> in<00:05:30.390> mid-range<00:05:30.750> I

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 
dominates everything in mid-range I

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.360 
dominates everything in mid-range I
would<00:05:31.050> take<00:05:31.230> this<00:05:31.350> gun<00:05:31.590> over<00:05:31.800> any<00:05:31.980> other<00:05:32.070> gun

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:32.370 
would take this gun over any other gun

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:34.190 
would take this gun over any other gun
in<00:05:32.520> mid-range<00:05:32.850> any<00:05:33.270> other<00:05:33.480> gun<00:05:33.660> in<00:05:33.810> the<00:05:33.930> game

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:34.200 
in mid-range any other gun in the game

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.950 
in mid-range any other gun in the game
mid-range<00:05:35.100> and<00:05:35.640> I<00:05:36.210> I<00:05:36.240> definitely<00:05:36.720> think<00:05:36.840> that

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 
mid-range and I I definitely think that

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.210 
mid-range and I I definitely think that
in<00:05:37.170> the<00:05:37.260> hands<00:05:37.410> of<00:05:37.530> a<00:05:37.590> veteran<00:05:37.890> player<00:05:38.070> this

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:38.220 
in the hands of a veteran player this

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:39.410 
in the hands of a veteran player this
could<00:05:38.370> even<00:05:38.460> be<00:05:38.580> a<00:05:38.670> gun<00:05:38.850> that<00:05:39.000> I<00:05:39.030> can<00:05:39.180> start

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:39.420 
could even be a gun that I can start

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:41.930 
could even be a gun that I can start
seeing<00:05:39.510> in<00:05:39.930> competitive<00:05:40.590> play<00:05:40.620> too<00:05:41.400> for<00:05:41.910> a

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:41.940 
seeing in competitive play too for a

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:43.760 
seeing in competitive play too for a
defensive<00:05:42.450> or<00:05:42.630> you<00:05:43.080> know<00:05:43.170> conservative

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:43.770 
defensive or you know conservative

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.680 
defensive or you know conservative
player<00:05:44.070> head<00:05:44.700> glitching<00:05:44.970> this<00:05:45.330> thing<00:05:45.510> just

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:45.690 
player head glitching this thing just

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:47.990 
player head glitching this thing just
has<00:05:45.960> so<00:05:46.170> much<00:05:46.290> potential<00:05:46.680> the<00:05:47.490> recoil<00:05:47.850> is

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 
has so much potential the recoil is

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.760 
has so much potential the recoil is
pretty<00:05:48.300> high<00:05:48.480> but<00:05:48.690> again<00:05:48.960> such<00:05:49.290> slow<00:05:49.530> rate<00:05:49.740> of

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:49.770 
pretty high but again such slow rate of

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:51.140 
pretty high but again such slow rate of
fire<00:05:49.860> you<00:05:50.310> can<00:05:50.460> manage<00:05:50.610> the<00:05:50.790> hell<00:05:50.910> out<00:05:51.000> of<00:05:51.060> the

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:51.150 
fire you can manage the hell out of the

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:53.030 
fire you can manage the hell out of the
recoil<00:05:51.510> and<00:05:51.660> this<00:05:52.110> is<00:05:52.260> about<00:05:52.440> the<00:05:52.620> time<00:05:52.830> where

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:53.040 
recoil and this is about the time where

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.410 
recoil and this is about the time where
I'd<00:05:53.130> say<00:05:53.310> hey<00:05:53.490> this<00:05:53.700> is<00:05:53.820> my<00:05:53.940> recommended

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:54.420 
I'd say hey this is my recommended

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:56.060 
I'd say hey this is my recommended
loadout<00:05:54.780> for<00:05:55.050> it<00:05:55.110> I<00:05:55.230> don't<00:05:55.410> have<00:05:55.620> one<00:05:55.800> for<00:05:55.950> this

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:56.070 
loadout for it I don't have one for this

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:57.560 
loadout for it I don't have one for this
gun<00:05:56.250> and<00:05:56.400> the<00:05:56.460> reason<00:05:56.700> for<00:05:56.850> being<00:05:57.060> is<00:05:57.240> because

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:57.570 
gun and the reason for being is because

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:59.780 
gun and the reason for being is because
this<00:05:57.720> is<00:05:57.870> completely<00:05:58.110> customizable<00:05:58.830> you<00:05:59.550> just

00:05:59.780 --> 00:05:59.790 
this is completely customizable you just

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:01.220 
this is completely customizable you just
run<00:05:59.970> through<00:06:00.120> the<00:06:00.240> damn<00:06:00.450> line<00:06:00.690> and<00:06:00.960> tell<00:06:01.110> me

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:01.230 
run through the damn line and tell me

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:02.780 
run through the damn line and tell me
what<00:06:01.380> you<00:06:01.500> want<00:06:01.680> on<00:06:01.800> top<00:06:01.830> of<00:06:02.220> it<00:06:02.340> and<00:06:02.520> it<00:06:02.610> works

out for you guys I like the coyote sight
but<00:06:04.770> I<00:06:04.860> like<00:06:05.040> a<00:06:05.070> handful<00:06:05.550> of<00:06:05.580> the<00:06:05.760> medium<00:06:06.090> range

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:06.270 
but I like a handful of the medium range

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:08.870 
but I like a handful of the medium range
scopes<00:06:06.660> too<00:06:07.140> it<00:06:07.830> holds<00:06:08.070> on<00:06:08.160> to<00:06:08.280> damage<00:06:08.640> so<00:06:08.850> a

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:08.880 
scopes too it holds on to damage so a

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.670 
scopes too it holds on to damage so a
little<00:06:09.060> bit<00:06:09.240> of<00:06:09.300> a<00:06:09.390> magnification<00:06:09.960> can't<00:06:10.500> go

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:10.680 
little bit of a magnification can't go

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.530 
little bit of a magnification can't go
wrong<00:06:10.950> again<00:06:11.430> the<00:06:11.790> other<00:06:11.880> attachments<00:06:12.450> work

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:12.540 
wrong again the other attachments work

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:14.390 
wrong again the other attachments work
too<00:06:12.690> I<00:06:12.720> handle<00:06:13.260> them<00:06:13.410> the<00:06:13.680> recoil<00:06:13.950> just<00:06:14.250> fine

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:14.400 
too I handle them the recoil just fine

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:15.620 
too I handle them the recoil just fine
you<00:06:14.550> may<00:06:14.700> want<00:06:14.910> to<00:06:14.940> put<00:06:15.090> something<00:06:15.390> else<00:06:15.510> on

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:15.630 
you may want to put something else on

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:17.540 
you may want to put something else on
there<00:06:15.810> for<00:06:16.020> you<00:06:16.230> guys<00:06:16.440> and<00:06:16.620> the<00:06:16.950> suppressor<00:06:17.430> is

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:17.550 
there for you guys and the suppressor is

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:18.740 
there for you guys and the suppressor is
definitely<00:06:17.880> something<00:06:18.000> I<00:06:18.150> would<00:06:18.210> recommend<00:06:18.660> I

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:18.750 
definitely something I would recommend I

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:20.030 
definitely something I would recommend I
think<00:06:18.930> I<00:06:18.990> use<00:06:19.110> the<00:06:19.230> suppressor<00:06:19.590> on<00:06:19.650> this<00:06:19.800> every

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:20.040 
think I use the suppressor on this every

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.350 
think I use the suppressor on this every
once<00:06:20.250> in<00:06:20.340> a<00:06:20.400> while<00:06:20.520> because<00:06:20.820> I'd<00:06:20.910> imagine

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:21.360 
once in a while because I'd imagine

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.420 
once in a while because I'd imagine
having<00:06:22.050> that<00:06:22.320> damage<00:06:22.710> but<00:06:22.920> also<00:06:22.980> being<00:06:23.310> able

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:23.430 
having that damage but also being able

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:24.890 
having that damage but also being able
to<00:06:23.550> flank<00:06:23.790> means<00:06:24.060> you<00:06:24.180> could<00:06:24.300> drop<00:06:24.510> people

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:24.900 
to flank means you could drop people

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.140 
to flank means you could drop people
down<00:06:25.110> a<00:06:25.140> little<00:06:25.530> bit<00:06:25.680> more<00:06:25.950> so<00:06:26.190> again<00:06:26.580> that's

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:27.150 
down a little bit more so again that's

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:28.700 
down a little bit more so again that's
why<00:06:27.390> I<00:06:27.420> didn't<00:06:27.810> put<00:06:27.840> a<00:06:27.960> recommended<00:06:28.410> loadout

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:28.710 
why I didn't put a recommended loadout

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:30.650 
why I didn't put a recommended loadout
on<00:06:28.830> this<00:06:29.010> episode<00:06:29.280> but<00:06:29.550> what<00:06:29.670> I<00:06:29.700> can<00:06:30.000> do<00:06:30.240> is<00:06:30.420> do

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:30.660 
on this episode but what I can do is do

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:35.300 
on this episode but what I can do is do
the<00:06:30.900> rating<00:06:31.470> game<00:06:31.500> I<00:06:32.100> grant<00:06:32.970> this<00:06:33.210> gun<00:06:33.540> a<00:06:34.250> on<00:06:35.250> a

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:35.310

gun<00:06:38.640> f4<00:06:39.360> and<00:06:39.570> it<00:06:39.960> is<00:06:40.110> very<00:06:40.410> very<00:06:40.620> close

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:41.280 
gun f4 and it is very very close

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:42.860 
gun f4 and it is very very close
to<00:06:41.460> being<00:06:41.670> a<00:06:41.760> five<00:06:42.000> the<00:06:42.270> only<00:06:42.480> thing<00:06:42.690> holding

to being a five the only thing holding

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:44.750 
to being a five the only thing holding
that<00:06:43.170> back<00:06:43.440> is<00:06:43.650> in<00:06:43.800> fact<00:06:44.070> the<00:06:44.220> fact<00:06:44.430> that<00:06:44.550> it's

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:44.760 
that back is in fact the fact that it's

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.090 
that back is in fact the fact that it's
just<00:06:45.150> not<00:06:45.389> good<00:06:45.660> at<00:06:45.690> close<00:06:45.960> range<00:06:46.260> and<00:06:46.590> they're

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:47.100 
just not good at close range and they're

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:48.860 
just not good at close range and they're
