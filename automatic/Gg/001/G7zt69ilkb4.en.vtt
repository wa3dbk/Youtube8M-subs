00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
that but um quick background information

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.280 
that but um quick background information
on<00:01:03.870> this<00:01:04.019> map<00:01:04.400> the<00:01:05.400> zombies<00:01:05.850> which<00:01:06.240> is<00:01:06.420> only<00:01:06.570> 26

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
on this map the zombies which is only 26

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.500 
on this map the zombies which is only 26
of<00:01:07.470> them<00:01:07.560> versus<00:01:08.010> me<00:01:08.130> 24<00:01:08.580> of<00:01:08.700> them<00:01:08.820> every

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
of them versus me 24 of them every

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.420 
of them versus me 24 of them every
single<00:01:09.659> round<00:01:09.990> which<00:01:10.710> is<00:01:10.830> why<00:01:10.950> you<00:01:11.010> can<00:01:11.189> get<00:01:11.310> to

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
single round which is why you can get to

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.820 
single round which is why you can get to
really<00:01:11.580> high<00:01:11.760> rounds<00:01:12.619> relatively<00:01:13.619> quickly

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
really high rounds relatively quickly

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.730 
really high rounds relatively quickly
now<00:01:14.130> it's<00:01:14.369> hardly<00:01:15.150> quick<00:01:15.570> it's<00:01:16.200> about<00:01:16.259> it's

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
now it's hardly quick it's about it's

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.080 
now it's hardly quick it's about it's
about<00:01:16.770> two<00:01:17.130> minutes<00:01:17.310> per<00:01:17.580> round<00:01:17.700> I<00:01:17.939> guess

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
about two minutes per round I guess

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.899 
about two minutes per round I guess
something<00:01:18.450> like<00:01:18.479> that<00:01:18.630> and<00:01:19.640> you<00:01:20.640> know<00:01:20.729> once

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
something like that and you know once

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.249 
something like that and you know once
you<00:01:21.000> try<00:01:21.299> to<00:01:21.360> jump<00:01:21.570> at<00:01:21.720> it<00:01:21.750> goes<00:01:21.960> a<00:01:21.990> little<00:01:22.110> bit

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
you try to jump at it goes a little bit

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.590 
you try to jump at it goes a little bit
quicker<00:01:22.439> but<00:01:23.369> it<00:01:23.520> still<00:01:23.790> takes<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.270> lot<00:01:24.450> longer

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
quicker but it still takes a lot longer

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.480 
quicker but it still takes a lot longer
than<00:01:24.900> I<00:01:24.990> wish<00:01:25.350> it<00:01:25.500> would<00:01:25.650> end<00:01:25.950> them<00:01:26.189> but<00:01:26.400> then

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
than I wish it would end them but then

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:27.590 
than I wish it would end them but then
again<00:01:26.580> you're<00:01:26.759> going<00:01:26.850> around<00:01:26.939> I'm<00:01:27.360> going

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
again you're going around I'm going

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.690 
again you're going around I'm going
around<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.840> thousand<00:01:28.380> so<00:01:28.619> I<00:01:29.070> don't<00:01:29.549> know<00:01:29.610> what

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
around the thousand so I don't know what

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.660 
around the thousand so I don't know what
I<00:01:29.759> really<00:01:29.939> expect<00:01:30.329> um<00:01:30.689> you'll<00:01:31.530> also<00:01:31.710> notice<00:01:32.040> I

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
I really expect um you'll also notice I

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.190 
I really expect um you'll also notice I
don't<00:01:33.180> know<00:01:33.270> whether<00:01:33.450> it's<00:01:33.659> around<00:01:33.960> or<00:01:34.140> if

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
don't know whether it's around or if

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.440 
don't know whether it's around or if
it's<00:01:34.350> basically<00:01:34.650> every<00:01:34.890> other<00:01:34.979> round<00:01:35.450> the

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
it's basically every other round the

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.649 
it's basically every other round the
zombies<00:01:36.869> have<00:01:37.170> level<00:01:37.829> one<00:01:38.070> health<00:01:38.430> na<00:01:39.390> it's

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
zombies have level one health na it's

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.460

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
reach a billion health urged me to point

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.719 
reach a billion health urged me to point
1<00:01:45.960> billion<00:01:46.229> health<00:01:46.560> which<00:01:46.979> makes<00:01:47.250> them<00:01:47.490> um

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
1 billion health which makes them um

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.899 
1 billion health which makes them um
have<00:01:48.540> so<00:01:48.840> much<00:01:48.990> health<00:01:49.259> but<00:01:49.500> then<00:01:49.740> that<00:01:49.979> it's

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
have so much health but then that it's

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.969 
have so much health but then that it's
hard<00:01:51.119> to<00:01:51.210> explain<00:01:51.390> it<00:01:51.600> basically<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.649> numbers

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
hard to explain it basically the numbers

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.149 
hard to explain it basically the numbers
like<00:01:53.390> regenerate<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:54.600> it<00:01:55.350> goes<00:01:55.560> back<00:01:55.590> down<00:01:55.979> to

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
like regenerate and it goes back down to

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.249 
like regenerate and it goes back down to
zero<00:01:56.189> every<00:01:56.850> other<00:01:56.939> round<00:01:57.210> it<00:01:57.899> doesn't<00:01:58.170> make

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
zero every other round it doesn't make

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.069 
zero every other round it doesn't make
much<00:01:58.500> sense<00:01:58.560> to<00:01:58.860> me<00:01:59.070> but<00:01:59.670> um<00:01:59.880> in<00:02:00.180> there<00:02:00.659> I<00:02:00.689> saved

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
much sense to me but um in there I saved

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.060 
much sense to me but um in there I saved
insta-kill<00:02:01.530> because<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.799> next<00:02:01.979> round

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
insta-kill because the next round

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.010 
insta-kill because the next round
probably<00:02:02.579> is<00:02:02.640> not<00:02:02.729> going<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:02.969> be<00:02:03.119> um<00:02:03.299> probably

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
probably is not going to be um probably

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.450 
probably is not going to be um probably
not<00:02:04.140> going<00:02:04.320> to<00:02:04.380> be<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.649> intense<00:02:05.130> to<00:02:05.310> kill

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
not going to be the intense to kill

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.499 
not going to be the intense to kill
zombies<00:02:05.700> i'm<00:02:05.820> going<00:02:05.939> to<00:02:06.000> say<00:02:06.090> things<00:02:06.210> to<00:02:06.360> kill

for it um but I got saying it's like
every<00:02:10.050> other<00:02:10.170> round<00:02:10.440> you'll<00:02:10.739> get<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:11.099> the

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
every other round you'll get the the

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.100 
every other round you'll get the the
glitch<00:02:11.819> where<00:02:12.090> they'll

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
glitch where they'll

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.810 
glitch where they'll
they're<00:02:13.710> helpful<00:02:13.920> glitch<00:02:14.280> out<00:02:14.490> and<00:02:14.700> they'll

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
they're helpful glitch out and they'll

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.250 
they're helpful glitch out and they'll
have<00:02:14.970> almost<00:02:15.240> no<00:02:15.420> health<00:02:15.630> off<00:02:15.810> basically

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
have almost no health off basically

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.770 
have almost no health off basically
level<00:02:16.830> one<00:02:17.010> amount<00:02:17.370> of<00:02:17.460> hell<00:02:17.610> and<00:02:17.820> then<00:02:18.630> it's

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
level one amount of hell and then it's

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.030 
level one amount of hell and then it's
like<00:02:18.810> every<00:02:19.110> other<00:02:19.200> round<00:02:19.410> will<00:02:19.650> switch<00:02:19.860> back

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
like every other round will switch back

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.010 
like every other round will switch back
between<00:02:20.250> having<00:02:20.700> in<00:02:20.880> st.<00:02:21.270> health<00:02:21.480> and<00:02:21.750> having

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
between having in st. health and having

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.500 
between having in st. health and having
no<00:02:22.140> health<00:02:22.320> and<00:02:22.530> there<00:02:23.520> I<00:02:23.550> grab<00:02:23.910> the<00:02:24.120> insta

and here it's around I think 204 I'm
going<00:03:38.970> to<00:03:39.030> do<00:03:39.090> this<00:03:39.180> for<00:03:39.330> like<00:03:39.390> five<00:03:39.750> rounds<00:03:40.260> as

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
going to do this for like five rounds as

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.050 
going to do this for like five rounds as
you<00:03:40.709> can<00:03:40.830> see<00:03:40.980> really<00:03:41.280> how<00:03:41.400> quick<00:03:41.730> they<00:03:41.910> go

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
you can see really how quick they go

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.460 
you can see really how quick they go
it's<00:03:42.269> it's<00:03:42.510> honest<00:03:42.810> and<00:03:42.900> only<00:03:43.049> about<00:03:43.140> a<00:03:43.230> minute

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
it's it's honest and only about a minute

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.009 
it's it's honest and only about a minute
and<00:03:43.680> a<00:03:43.739> half<00:03:43.769> per<00:03:44.280> round<00:03:44.430> at<00:03:44.640> this<00:03:44.760> level<00:03:45.019> it

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
and a half per round at this level it

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:48.530 
and a half per round at this level it
just<00:03:46.500> gets<00:03:46.620> faster<00:03:47.070> as<00:03:47.160> you<00:03:47.190> go<00:03:47.400> along<00:03:47.489> a<00:03:47.910> few

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
just gets faster as you go along a few

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.170 
just gets faster as you go along a few
monumental<00:03:49.260> points<00:03:49.709> is<00:03:49.830> a<00:03:49.860> round<00:03:50.700> for<00:03:51.000> tea

monumental points is a round for tea
it's<00:03:51.510> got<00:03:51.920> the<00:03:52.920> spawn<00:03:53.310> switch<00:03:53.730> on<00:03:53.910> around<00:03:54.060> 40

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
it's got the spawn switch on around 40

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.240 
it's got the spawn switch on around 40
which<00:03:54.570> is<00:03:54.690> really<00:03:54.840> weird<00:03:54.989> but<00:03:55.200> I<00:03:55.260> love<00:03:55.410> it<00:03:55.470> um

which is really weird but I love it um
pretty<00:03:56.640> much<00:03:56.790> around<00:03:57.060> 40<00:03:57.570> they'll<00:03:57.750> no<00:03:57.930> longer

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
pretty much around 40 they'll no longer

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.350 
pretty much around 40 they'll no longer
spawn<00:03:58.530> outside<00:03:58.890> if<00:03:59.160> you<00:03:59.340> stand<00:03:59.730> inside<00:04:00.150> when

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
spawn outside if you stand inside when

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.390 
spawn outside if you stand inside when
the<00:04:00.450> round<00:04:00.600> starts<00:04:00.989> which<00:04:01.680> is<00:04:01.830> why<00:04:01.980> I<00:04:02.010> stand

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
the round starts which is why I stand

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.789 
the round starts which is why I stand
inside<00:04:02.640> though<00:04:02.850> I've<00:04:02.970> buddies<00:04:03.209> down<00:04:03.330> there

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:03.799 
inside though I've buddies down there

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:06.050 
inside though I've buddies down there
and<00:04:04.799> here<00:04:04.980> I<00:04:05.010> get<00:04:05.160> a<00:04:05.190> Nuke<00:04:05.400> wishes<00:04:05.700> ends<00:04:05.940> the

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
and here I get a Nuke wishes ends the

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.440 
and here I get a Nuke wishes ends the
entire<00:04:06.090> round<00:04:06.540> it's<00:04:07.410> awesome<00:04:07.500> uh<00:04:08.090> but<00:04:09.090> anyways

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
entire round it's awesome uh but anyways

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.479 
entire round it's awesome uh but anyways
see<00:04:10.230> ya<00:04:10.320> like<00:04:10.530> I<00:04:10.650> was<00:04:10.709> saying<00:04:10.769> when<00:04:11.100> if<00:04:11.340> you

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
see ya like I was saying when if you

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:13.340 
see ya like I was saying when if you
stand<00:04:11.760> inside<00:04:12.150> when<00:04:12.420> the<00:04:12.510> round<00:04:12.720> starts<00:04:13.079> then

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
stand inside when the round starts then

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.710 
stand inside when the round starts then
um<00:04:13.500> then<00:04:14.340> all<00:04:14.579> Islam<00:04:14.910> bees<00:04:15.060> will<00:04:15.180> spawn<00:04:15.420> inside

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
um then all Islam bees will spawn inside

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.659 
um then all Islam bees will spawn inside
which<00:04:15.930> it<00:04:16.380> doesn't<00:04:16.799> didn't<00:04:17.310> happen

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
which it doesn't didn't happen

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:20.120 
which it doesn't didn't happen
originally<00:04:18.530> cuz<00:04:19.530> i<00:04:19.590> was<00:04:19.709> running<00:04:19.799> circle

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
originally cuz i was running circle

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.670 
originally cuz i was running circle
everson<00:04:20.400> to<00:04:20.459> look<00:04:20.579> around<00:04:20.700> 20<00:04:21.090> and<00:04:21.680> originally

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
everson to look around 20 and originally

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.529 
everson to look around 20 and originally
they<00:04:22.890> would<00:04:23.280> all<00:04:23.430> spawn<00:04:23.789> out<00:04:24.150> in<00:04:24.330> the<00:04:24.450> swamp

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:24.539 
they would all spawn out in the swamp

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:25.890 
they would all spawn out in the swamp
whatever<00:04:24.990> he<00:04:25.080> moved<00:04:25.289> out<00:04:25.410> this<00:04:25.560> wall

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
whatever he moved out this wall

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.499 
whatever he moved out this wall
but<00:04:26.650> um<00:04:26.830> I<00:04:27.009> guess<00:04:27.310> I<00:04:27.520> think<00:04:27.790> the<00:04:27.910> spawn<00:04:28.210> just

00:04:28.499 --> 00:04:28.509 
but um I guess I think the spawn just

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:31.050 
but um I guess I think the spawn just
speed<00:04:28.810> up<00:04:28.840> when<00:04:29.470> it<00:04:29.620> wins<00:04:30.400> gets<00:04:30.699> passed<00:04:30.940> around

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
speed up when it wins gets passed around

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.870 
speed up when it wins gets passed around
40<00:04:31.479> and<00:04:31.660> that's<00:04:32.590> why<00:04:32.770> they<00:04:33.070> um<00:04:33.250> that's<00:04:33.699> why

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
40 and that's why they um that's why

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.070 
40 and that's why they um that's why
they<00:04:34.000> all<00:04:34.090> spawned<00:04:34.389> inside<00:04:34.630> because<00:04:34.810> when<00:04:34.990> I'm

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
they all spawned inside because when I'm

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.900 
they all spawned inside because when I'm
standing<00:04:35.320> inside<00:04:35.560> i<00:04:35.620> think<00:04:35.889> all<00:04:36.009> 24<00:04:36.520> spawning

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
standing inside i think all 24 spawning

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.969 
standing inside i think all 24 spawning
at<00:04:37.090> once<00:04:37.270> which<00:04:38.080> is<00:04:38.229> why<00:04:38.350> they<00:04:38.530> all<00:04:38.710> spawn

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:38.979 
at once which is why they all spawn

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:40.140 
at once which is why they all spawn
inside<00:04:39.280> and<00:04:39.400> then<00:04:39.490> when<00:04:39.580> i<00:04:39.610> get<00:04:39.699> outside<00:04:40.030> my

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
inside and then when i get outside my

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:41.310 
inside and then when i get outside my
kinda<00:04:40.330> get<00:04:40.419> outside<00:04:40.660> there's<00:04:40.900> there's<00:04:41.199> no

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 
kinda get outside there's there's no

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.170 
kinda get outside there's there's no
more<00:04:41.500> left<00:04:41.620> to<00:04:41.740> spawn<00:04:42.009> and<00:04:42.310> it<00:04:42.910> makes<00:04:43.060> it

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
more left to spawn and it makes it

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:44.520 
more left to spawn and it makes it
really<00:04:43.570> really<00:04:43.690> easy<00:04:43.990> when<00:04:44.320> they<00:04:44.350> were

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530 
really really easy when they were

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:45.840 
really really easy when they were
spawning<00:04:44.800> in<00:04:44.949> the<00:04:44.979> swamp<00:04:45.310> you<00:04:45.430> had<00:04:45.520> to<00:04:45.610> dodge<00:04:45.820> a

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:45.850 
spawning in the swamp you had to dodge a

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.540 
spawning in the swamp you had to dodge a
few<00:04:46.180> dodged<00:04:47.080> a<00:04:47.199> few<00:04:47.229> of<00:04:47.470> them<00:04:47.590> and<00:04:47.800> also<00:04:48.430> i

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
few dodged a few of them and also i

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.189 
few dodged a few of them and also i
couldn't<00:04:48.850> really<00:04:48.940> jump<00:04:49.240> into<00:04:49.389> swamp<00:04:49.690> like<00:04:50.080> i'm

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:50.199 
couldn't really jump into swamp like i'm

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:52.890
