00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
this even they yeah lose muscle when

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:43.339 
this even they yeah lose muscle when
they<00:02:41.970> cut<00:02:42.209> they're<00:02:42.510> gonna<00:02:42.750> lose<00:02:42.930> strength

they cut they're gonna lose strength
muscle<00:02:43.799> yeah<00:02:44.489> you<00:02:44.819> can<00:02:44.939> make<00:02:45.060> a<00:02:45.090> weakness<00:02:45.540> when

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
muscle yeah you can make a weakness when

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.479 
muscle yeah you can make a weakness when
it<00:02:45.840> comes<00:02:46.019> that<00:02:46.170> comfort<00:02:46.500> is<00:02:46.620> so<00:02:46.889> the<00:02:47.250> way<00:02:47.430> you

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
it comes that comfort is so the way you

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.089 
back a little bit more no thrill you
following<00:03:23.790> the<00:03:23.849> counters<00:03:24.209> yeah<00:03:24.479> but<00:03:25.109> as<00:03:25.440> far

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:26.099 
following the counters yeah but as far

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:28.099 
following the counters yeah but as far
as<00:03:26.159> maintaining<00:03:27.090> mass<00:03:27.359> because<00:03:27.690> your<00:03:27.900> HGH

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:28.109 
as maintaining mass because your HGH

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:31.670 
as maintaining mass because your HGH
production<00:03:28.919> is<00:03:29.239> braised<00:03:30.239> when<00:03:30.690> you<00:03:30.780> fast<00:03:31.049> yeah

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
production is braised when you fast yeah

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.920 
production is braised when you fast yeah
I<00:03:32.040> don't<00:03:32.250> think<00:03:32.459> that's<00:03:32.790> going<00:03:33.000> to<00:03:33.090> have<00:03:33.239> any

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
I don't think that's going to have any

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.559 
I don't think that's going to have any
effect<00:03:34.169> that<00:03:34.500> uh<00:03:34.620> when<00:03:35.250> it<00:03:35.370> comes<00:03:35.609> to<00:03:35.849> how<00:03:36.389> much

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 
effect that uh when it comes to how much

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:38.240 
effect that uh when it comes to how much
muscle<00:03:36.870> you<00:03:36.989> lose<00:03:37.199> I<00:03:37.379> think<00:03:37.409> that<00:03:37.709> all<00:03:37.919> comes

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
muscle you lose I think that all comes

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.580 
muscle you lose I think that all comes
down<00:03:38.340> to<00:03:38.489> calories<00:03:38.909> in<00:03:39.299> mm-hmm<00:03:40.019> versus

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
down to calories in mm-hmm versus

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.710 
down to calories in mm-hmm versus
calories<00:03:40.859> out<00:03:41.250> oh<00:03:41.519> man<00:03:41.940> just<00:03:42.120> gave<00:03:42.269> that<00:03:42.329> dudes

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
calories out oh man just gave that dudes

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.089 
calories out oh man just gave that dudes
can<00:03:42.930> good<00:03:43.079> advice<00:03:43.319> you<00:03:43.470> know<00:03:43.590> I'm<00:03:43.680> saying<00:03:43.889> I

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:44.099 
can good advice you know I'm saying I

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:45.500 
can good advice you know I'm saying I
think<00:03:44.129> when<00:03:44.519> you<00:03:44.609> do<00:03:44.819> fast

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
think when you do fast

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.129 
think when you do fast
it<00:03:45.870> helps<00:03:46.260> us<00:03:46.379> when<00:03:46.709> we<00:03:46.889> to<00:03:47.849> get<00:03:48.209> lean<00:03:48.510> yeah

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:49.139 
it helps us when we to get lean yeah

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:52.069 
it helps us when we to get lean yeah
because<00:03:49.349> you're<00:03:49.709> not<00:03:49.799> feeding<00:03:50.159> your<00:03:50.400> body<00:03:51.079> you
