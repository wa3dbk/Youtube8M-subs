00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:08.359
 wrong meadow that by the way 

00:00:08.359 --> 00:00:10.709
 semino explain how it is done 

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:14.319
 and once we have a good base of vegetables sofrito I do not know if the 

00:00:14.319 --> 00:00:15.829
 Lord caught 

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:17.089
 rao 

00:00:17.089 --> 00:00:20.889
 we place it together with the sofrito and we add it in this case 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:24.829
 0 1 percent effective a little bit of water 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.460
 if we put water 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.239
 eva as we say in a zodiac is going to be a soup that we can not take 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:33.749
 after 

00:00:33.749 --> 00:00:35.780
 we simply place him laura ed 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.019
 that fossil my children and my children and executive for a long time 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:41.449
 until it's okay to perform 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:44.560
 that's why I cooked watching live 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:45.610
 he deserved 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.960
 happens to this subject you put tomato that moment anses to salsa 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.100
 it would be some 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.790
 getxo conrado 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.720
 this for the final preparation has to be fine very well but well the 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:58.450
 cold 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.320
 zp that I had one done 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.550
 finally here we are going to add a little broth of good beef broth that 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.980
 have for example because it can be even police that has chickens 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.009
 simply 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:12.439
 so it's more liquid and time to cook the tomato one the big ones 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:15.460
 román secrets raúl gil has left quite some time 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.320
 there is tomato to cook to make important data by luck 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.590
 the kitchen tomato or the great idol and prostate cancer that is known this 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.210
 recontra tasted this yes that talked about the world cooking of tail 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.230
 we go in two hours and stretch the dough for our year 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:34.470
 As I tell you, it is very important to let it rest much longer than time 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.920
 that I have let him rest at this moment 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.790
 Thus 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.230
 he told them I have here one that I had previously done and that they already have 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:44.380
 resting time 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:45.700
 they matter 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.190
 we have here our trump card 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.200
 for walking perfectly 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.659
 what we are going to do is throw it away a bit and then throw it away with the entity machine 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:54.680
 until 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.640
 until you have simply the additionally very fine that you have 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.610
 the anecdotes in the classic lasagna 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.910
 as that does not leave roses and flowers with a little ball of these is more than enough 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:09.189
 will not be left for later 

00:02:09.189 --> 00:02:11.609
 and we stretch we throw 

00:02:11.609 --> 00:02:14.569
 precious in that container to help the 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:18.129
 to the peace machine love but simple to say abusive simply 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:22.150
 the rebel tepco was a politician of the inem he stopped gave me serpe well 

00:02:22.669 --> 00:02:25.439
 to why 

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:26.989
 keep going so 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:31.159
 and once we have stretched it in the 100 that lives in the middle of the young man it weighs 

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:33.339
 only titanic roller 

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:35.089
 we do it with the classic marathon 

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:36.959
 front may of turning pac 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:38.099
 modifying 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:42.389
 remember always because here the Jews are completely separated 

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:43.599
 the most you can 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:47.950
 it is folded in half according to the bea passing and that what is called sugar la 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.379
 mass that way 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:52.879
 if you get it started very well I've been one again in half 

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:56.280
 doubled its size its use 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.649
 and come back 

00:02:57.649 --> 00:02:58.939
 By himself 

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:02.430
 Willful once she has managed to do that 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:06.489
 cela watering arias is a little bit a fast the 101 the blume to the xente 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:09.299
 clarito because the dough is very cold 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:12.689
 we start now yes ap to approach the rollers 

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:16.809
 what's mine for that is the machine was given away and that candor today we started the 

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:19.809
 process of stretching that mass we will see here 

00:03:22.029 --> 00:03:25.099
 miret moved the roller even closer 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:26.379
 I'll throw again 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:30.519
 We wanted the idea is to arrive at 13-17 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:35.249
 to be able to make just a lasagna and the benchmark interest rate without 

00:03:35.249 --> 00:03:35.979
 remove 

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:37.289
 well good hundred 

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:38.999
 as new 

00:03:38.999 --> 00:03:40.549
 wonderful 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:44.379
 we stretch even more a first tiraje have to lower interest rates and 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:45.119
 Edit 

00:03:45.119 --> 00:03:46.779
 that mass 

00:03:46.779 --> 00:03:47.999
 we always throw 

00:03:47.999 --> 00:03:52.019
 lower a little the average speed that they are expiring because the more 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:55.019
 Wears more neat and breaking 

00:03:55.679 --> 00:03:57.530
 last tour because I'm going to do it 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:58.669
 folding it 

00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:02.549
 barack is a bit wider because I need it a little wider 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:05.039
 got too narrow 

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:07.639
 wonderful 

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:09.939
 We also have thin 

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:10.889
 we have her 

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:13.999
 enough 

00:04:13.999 --> 00:04:15.959
 what are we going to do with him now 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:17.489
 we have is more here 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.009
 I just 

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:22.040
 today shorten a rectangle that has 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.559
 the size 

00:04:23.559 --> 00:04:27.389
 delta year of cooking with puppets vallanca cooking I already explained to you 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:28.590
 what does that mean 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.400
 up as a team 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.039
 if this is the cloth 

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:33.699
 I'm going to cook it here 

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:36.979
 the size has to be up to here we cut to go 

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:41.419
 he thinks another and another would come out 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:44.650
 the fly every strip this would be a ration 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.610
 do not place this 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:51.439
 for future cases and I show them how we are going to work is a beauty of 

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:52.210
 recipes 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.030
 we simply have our most here 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.530
 or maybe it's my son Roberto but in Chinese 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.289
 we place our raoux 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:01.270
 closed beef is true 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.970
 technically in two stages of fact I will pay one does not want to be 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:06.059
 looking for that 

00:05:06.059 --> 00:05:07.900
 but I do not lose perfect 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:12.680
 we have the nail cooking here we have the one that I already have cold here 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:14.930
 I put it in 12 thousand 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:16.789
 in the entire middle yes 

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:21.159
 well let's hope to make a gypsy arm very good slow rhythm especially gypsy case 

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:22.289
 in fact cowen 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:24.009
 oxtail 

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:25.300
 we're here 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.300
 fill well 

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:30.779
 to them 

00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:35.680
 since always a little of what I use as it says to the sides thing that can be 

00:05:35.679 --> 00:05:37.249
 paste well after 

00:05:37.249 --> 00:05:39.919
 we are 

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:41.389
 Chile 

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:43.879
 on roll as if it were a bullet and also here 

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:45.879
 mutual and take a sudden 

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:48.189
 as rolling 

00:05:48.189 --> 00:05:50.969
 as the multilevel offered today an Italian classic fears that you can 

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:53.969
 tomatoes and that the classic multimedia 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:58.249
 finally the best way to cook this as I said was 

00:05:58.249 --> 00:06:02.520
 With a washcloth say grab a kitchen towel and clean a cloth 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.839
 that was nineteenth his land rover 

00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:06.110
 we put it here 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:09.430
 to the pardon put zentrum him politics it took him seems lie but it 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:12.040
 stick the cloth to him many times 

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:13.789
 to prevent that from happening 

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:16.770
 it gets a little olive oil 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:19.210
 we place here 

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:20.599
 we close 

00:06:20.599 --> 00:06:22.610
 boyacá 

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:25.849
 flame bouquets the sides 

00:06:25.849 --> 00:06:28.849
 omar ramos un ladito 

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:33.729
 because also this can freeze fire from the kitchen and it went 

00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:35.379
 with him to the club percent 

00:06:35.379 --> 00:06:37.139
 benton a flight on paper end 

00:06:37.139 --> 00:06:39.659
 we tie the other side 

00:06:39.659 --> 00:06:40.860
 they 

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:44.249
 we do not have to make sure that we are reaching the point of 

00:06:44.249 --> 00:06:48.319
 we closed well and then josé bonus that they increase to flee watching doing very 

00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:52.129
 well living however I have in mind a footprint someone in cooking 

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:54.659
 I put it like this 

00:06:54.659 --> 00:06:56.599
 and that it was arrived without an 

00:06:56.599 --> 00:06:58.039
 on that web 

00:06:58.039 --> 00:07:02.589
 meanwhile what else are we going to 0 in other elements this recipe is what 

00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:07.139
 I said with some frequency because it is very easy these a silicone mesh 

00:07:07.139 --> 00:07:11.710
 is placed in shape in the mine that his Mexican pair grated 

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:15.140
 and that parmesan cheese as it is and put on a hat of this temperature 

00:07:15.139 --> 00:07:15.629
 half
