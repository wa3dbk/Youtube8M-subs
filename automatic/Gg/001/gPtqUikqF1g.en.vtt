00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:05.590
 Choose again 

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:07.770
 Enter and think in the ball area 

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:10.040
 First you 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.850
 Get rid of this 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.240
 2 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:17.100
 I As I said even before the article 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.470
 100 Toka This body 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.980
 It's dark 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:29.640
 Lowest point who became the Garn 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:33.450
 Because it is stable, it is better than not hand- shifting too much 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:39.360
 in the weight distribution of the web first left and right equally 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:42.880
 Position the ball so that the shaft will be perpendicular to the ground against BIC 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.310
 Because it is more than the center of the body 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:49.840
 Little left eye 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:54.260
 I think it is the correct ball position to be worried 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:59.840
 From there, it's a little bit right 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:05.720
 Of the person who is slightly above the center of the body or who puts the ball a little to the left than that left foot 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:07.520
 Well I think there are individual differences and it is the feature of the putter 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:11.659
 Thus this shaft 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:16.939
 The position of the shaft and face of the face from this person wharf 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:18.120
 Please check the positional relationship like this a little more than the shaft ship 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:24.770
 Face is 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:28.659
 Or such person this say putter that is in the back says a little high roll 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:30.580
 Our this easy to move the face 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:32.960
 The patterns of 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:38.900
 If you say either a 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:42.909
 As it is easy to turn after Heisei, the person who puts the ball on the left is a little too good to hold a little 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.909
 It is easy to hit if you put it in the middle 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:55.370
 Conversely, such as such a center shaft 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:57.920
 The car club has a face also at this shaft axis, so the stroke is relatively 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:03.380
 Straight 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:07.240
 I think it is suitable for people who move, so put the ball position to the left eye 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.240
 I think it's easy to hit 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.090
 To Tsu Flea Market 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:17.610
 People who are in the Meiji area have shafts etc. 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.770
 If the face of the face is as close as possible 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.170
 A little above 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.690
 Cormorants are people like hitting in the circular orbit 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.980
 With the shaft of this shaft 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:30.270
 If the face is slightly off 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.230
 It says that you can choose 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.230
 Doting cheap your Kana
