00:01:33.389 --> 00:01:33.399 
before you pour it in just because it

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:35.039

okay<00:01:36.040> so<00:01:36.820> now<00:01:36.969> that<00:01:37.000> these<00:01:37.329> are<00:01:37.450> mixed<00:01:37.659> we're

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:38.049 
okay so now that these are mixed we're

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:39.300 
okay so now that these are mixed we're
going<00:01:38.229> to<00:01:38.350> add<00:01:38.469> all<00:01:38.740> of<00:01:38.920> our<00:01:39.040> wet<00:01:39.280> ingredients

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
going to add all of our wet ingredients

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.359 
going to add all of our wet ingredients
just<00:01:40.000> right<00:01:40.689> into<00:01:40.990> the<00:01:41.140> bowl<00:01:41.350> as<00:01:41.500> well<00:01:41.530> so

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:42.369 
just right into the bowl as well so

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:44.160 
just right into the bowl as well so
because<00:01:42.670> we're<00:01:42.939> using<00:01:43.090> coconut<00:01:43.360> flour<00:01:43.719> it's<00:01:44.020> a

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
because we're using coconut flour it's a

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.590 
because we're using coconut flour it's a
really<00:01:44.560> dry<00:01:44.979> flour<00:01:45.340> so<00:01:45.700> it<00:01:45.820> does<00:01:46.060> require<00:01:46.329> a

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
really dry flour so it does require a

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.499 
really dry flour so it does require a
bit<00:01:46.630> more<00:01:46.869> liquid<00:01:47.200> so<00:01:48.159> we're<00:01:48.700> going<00:01:48.850> to<00:01:48.939> add<00:01:49.119> in
