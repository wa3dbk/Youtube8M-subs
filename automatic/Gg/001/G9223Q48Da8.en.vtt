00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:09.260
 until the all good night I send you 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:12.260
 a greeting 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:15.290
 to the people of youtube to the whiskeys to 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:17.880
 subscribers and the community of 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:19.980
 xperia m 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.800
 this time I am with you to 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:26.550
 share this widget that out there 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.300
 I got from a room that is for some 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.300
 experience 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:37.650
 and then I tried it and if it works it works 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:41.410
 I'm perfectly in the version of 4.3 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:44.310
 compilation 1.9 the latest version for 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.660
 the month of android xperia 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.240
 to me 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.610
 well, good 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:53.610
 the video I do because many do not know 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.680
 how to install it and to understand in some 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.970
 Explorer that executes rudd permissions 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.280
 in this case I'm going to do it with root 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:02.010
 explorer and the file will come like this 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.110
 named as it is here what they are going to 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:08.420
 make it rename 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.420
 up to where it says music widget 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.640
 next to freckles 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.170
 without space they leave it 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.600
 and here in the lacquer you add one here 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.720
 another bed to make a file 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.990
 strange 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:43.720
 this file is moved or copied 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.720
 to the systems app route 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.869
 here they exist 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.690
 app 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.780
 and they look for the height where the music is 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:59.659
 widget and they put you 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:02.560
 riding permits 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:02.560
 writing 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:09.610
 copy it in the strange file 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.610
 it's the pkk 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:17.330
 and then making a backup of your 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:19.880
 facebook widget to original sin 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.550
 they copy it to x direction I'm going to 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.940
 copy here in case in case you do not 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.940
 like 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:31.140
 and then they go back to the 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:34.480
 system app folder and delete it the 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:37.500
 widget has sinned original 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.500
 they eliminate it 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:45.630
 and I miss with 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:49.580
 termination to pkk re name 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.580
 removing the face that they added 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:57.909
 accept 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.950
 and it's going to be the process of renaming what 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:09.730
 that here gets you a little bit slower 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:11.980
 terminal and there is this I do it to not 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.720
 do a bounce of the device and not 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.330
 have to be turning on turning off the 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.300
 eye terminal will not do it with a 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:21.160
 assist Jewish with the framework 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:23.710
 it is simply done with freckles that 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.330
 Quickly recognizes the terminal more than the 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:28.750
 framework in this case is worth the 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:31.060
 redundancy and in this in the step to 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:34.770
 to be forgiven is to give him permission to 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.770
 inverted as many say out there 

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:46.230
 they beat it by doing it and in permissions 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.580
 to be like this and eliminate our two 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:52.350
 they accept it 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:55.470
 and there again makes another exchange 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:58.490
 now if you look for your widget in the in the 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:02.480
 Drawer applications should analyze 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:04.930
 in the area of ​​widgets and support 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:08.260
 and it's this one below 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:11.400
 has four options and I loved this 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:13.989
 What I did to him was give him a 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.969
 medium in glass or little transparent 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:19.359
 because the version comes very dark 

00:04:15.969 --> 00:04:23.949
 original and the music with the original 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:26.199
 that yes divulge the and also elevate 

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:29.569
 the particles a little more towards towards 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:32.179
 the center because they looked very tiny 

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:32.719
 and then the other two the truth is not me 

00:04:32.179 --> 00:04:34.909
 they liked 

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:36.559
 one is the big smart hover and the other 

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:38.070
 is the expandable already there what you 

00:04:36.559 --> 00:04:40.380
 they taste 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:43.150
 I'm going to leave the link of the file 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:46.300
 in mega in the description of the video 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:48.550
 I hope you like them 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:51.659
 I send you a greeting from Mexico that 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.659
 be fine until the next
