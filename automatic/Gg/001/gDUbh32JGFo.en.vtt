00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.779
 apples under a layer of deliciously sweet 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:25.669
 shortcrust dough directly from the oven 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:28.750
 this until you are a true classic and 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:28.750
 also very easy to make 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.390
 first preheat the oven 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.870
 meanwhile we are going to the raisins 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:47.440
 Wellen in some hot water to make them tasty 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.610
 become juicy and that one of those 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.010
 raisins 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:53.260
 you can also do in some warm apple juice or 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.500
 a little cinnamon that gives extra much 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.890
 taste 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:59.200
 on the crumble if you don't like it 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.670
 raisins are dried apricots 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.260
 also very tasty 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:06.150
 cut it into small pieces and add 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.150
 add some coarsely chopped hazelnuts 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.020
 first peel the apple 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:23.680
 remove the bell houses and then we go 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:26.290
 cut pieces and came how can you too 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.430
 make very well with other types of fruit 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.259
 for example, consider a crumble 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.590
 with cherries or with some leftovers 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:31.590
 stewed pears 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:39.479
 then take 2 tablespoons of sugar with the 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.479
 cinnamon through the apples 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:56.240
 make sure that all apples 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:59.110
 good cinnamon and sugar we are 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.110
 then the flower 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:06.460
 the rest of the sugar the vanilla sugar 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:16.150
 and the butter in the batter bowl and knead it 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.150
 to a crumbly dough 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.700
 we use a mixer with this 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.500
 dough hooks 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.610
 but you can of course also do with you 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.610
 hands or in a food processor 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.390
 make sure you don't stay too long 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.490
 that it is not compact 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:49.100
 dough ball, the structure must be real 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:52.150
 we are going to be the coarse and crumbly first 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.150
 drain the raisins 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.400
 they are nice violence and then we do them 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.400
 through the apple 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.520
 pass it through well 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:10.240
 then divide the mixture between the four 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.240
 ovenproof dishes 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.120
 and then sprinkle the dough crumbs 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.120
 across 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.980
 you can of course also choose to 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.470
 to make a large-scale crumble in 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.670
 place of four small containers 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.670
 quantities then remain exactly the same 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.489
 well then they can go for half an hour now 

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:39.489
 oven 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.400
 I just got the apple crumbles out of the oven 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.860
 we see a beautiful golden brown 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:57.990
 and it smells incredibly tasty 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:04:00.030
 so we are going to serve the crumbles now 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:02.400
 are best when you call them or 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.260
 lukewarm and serve as an extra 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.400
 a scoop of vanilla ice cream 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.260
 and sprinkle a little more 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.740
 cinnamon sugar over it 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.740
 not tasty
