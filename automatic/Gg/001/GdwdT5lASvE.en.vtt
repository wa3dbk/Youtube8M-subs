00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 Hello everyone, Andrey Andreyev 

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:07.940
 Andreevich my site all-all point ru 1440 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:17.960
 9 task 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:23.910
 Alyosha traveled by train 160 2.5 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:28.830
 kilometers for 2 point six hours 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:33.120
 what is the speed of the show train and so to us 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.290
 known distance known time to find 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.730
 need speed 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:43.290
 to find the speed you need the distance 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:45.090
 divide by time only 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.700
 we still can not get why because 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.039
 here we have a decimal like 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.219
 get rid of the decimal let's 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.980
 we are here a comma on 1 sign to the right 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:57.270
 transfer to 26 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.879
 if we are here a comma on 1 sign to the right 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:03.059
 transfer the comma here too 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.729
 one character to the right and we are now taking will pay 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.920
 wow and divider the comma is transferred to 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.150
 the same number of digits for the same 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.900
 number of characters for the same 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.119
 number of digits 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:16.080
 that is, if here by one digit that is 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.920
 one digit now we have a divider became 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.369
 integer 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.680
 already it will turn out to divide that is 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:26.420
 it turns out like this divided into twenty 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.420
 six o'clock 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:38.880
 now we can divide in column 1625 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:42.150
 divide by 26 see here two numbers 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:49.340
 here we take two numbers 16 less than 26 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:57.860
 add another digit 162 divide by 26 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:02:00.720
 so maybe take 6 or 5 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:05.880
 let's try to take on 6 maybe 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:15.180
 fail six now six 36 6 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:17.360
 write 3 in mind 3 you 6 to 2 12 to 3 in 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.360
 mind 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:29.940
 15 borrow from 12 subtract 6 will be 6 from 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:38.790
 Sixes took 5 5 minus 50 left 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:43.410
 1 out of 10 is the top five at all and take 2 2 per 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:53.010
 6 12 2 we write 1 in your mind 2 by 2 4 to 1 by you 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:56.970
 5 5 minus 2 is 36 minus 5 this is 113 by 26 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:03:04.200
 don't share write here comma here 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:05.720
 add zero take 5 5 to 6 30 0 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:11.090
 write 3 in mind 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:11.090
 5 to 210 to 3 in mind 13 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:20.720
 it turns out 62.5 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.620
 62 wholes, 5 tenths of what we were looking for we 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.770
 searched speed 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:30.319
 kilometers per hour kilometers per hour 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:36.130
 train speed is 62.5 kilometers an hour 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:36.130
 such a problem on this all bye
