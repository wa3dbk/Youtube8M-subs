00:00:00.919 --> 00:00:04.049
 and therefore radiation is of course the indicator for us 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.240
 whether in a gas cloud the otherwise rather boring spectrum has in the 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.689
 Anything inside 

00:00:09.689 --> 00:00:11.509
 at the star formation happens because 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:14.549
 Of course, these processes are not in the visible light 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.230
 The gas in these clouds is so dense that the visual light is what we are 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.170
 know from the sun 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:21.339
 that's all 

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:23.789
 it is absorbed by say it is swallowed 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.210
 and only in a very specific wavelength range here we are in 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.930
 the situation 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:29.669
 To recognize things that happen in the gas clouds 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:32.550
 So then if such a small 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.620
 So how should you say Super Team has formed a sub cloud in the 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.740
 then the collapse continues again 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.530
 then we can only watch that 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.230
 with radio telescopes or with infrared 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.040
 these are the only possibilities for such processes in such clouds 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.770
 observe 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.280
 that is, we see in quotes processes in such 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.019
 gas clouds 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:52.999
 not really 

00:00:52.999 --> 00:00:56.019
 we should only be able to track them indirectly and in the way and 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:00:58.420
 Find out how stars are created 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.440
 there are not stars everywhere 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.290
 because of that they do not arise everywhere because of the conditions for a collapse 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.010
 Of course, gravity depends on dimensions 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.850
 the medium between the stars is pretty quiet there are only a few 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.510
 Particles per cubic centimeter 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:12.380
 Furthermore 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.480
 the absolute vacuum, so to speak 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.350
 how much better than they can make the vacuum in the lab 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.119
 and this in the the storeroom 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:22.920
 So it does not have the ability to easily create local gas clouds 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.140
 Immers must come together large crowds 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.219
 then really at one point my gas cloud forms 

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:31.829
 the gas cloud can collapse and within that gas cloud 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.170
 then still under structures from Minden which then earth Vollmar star 

00:01:35.169 --> 00:01:35.830
 will arise 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.060
 a highly complex complex process 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.390
 very well observed nowadays with the help of infrared and radio Danisco Bent 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.900
 can be under the meanwhile know 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.760
 moreover about know here works 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.300
 the gas clouds 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.250
 So, as shown here in the cup, these are conglomerates of gas in those 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.220
 all sorts of stars arise at once 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.720
 So the huge stars are created 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.299
 Life is very short and that will be awarded in a gigantic explosion 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.930
 Now what happens when he actually collapse into a gas cloud 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:09.929
 would put on at some 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.839
 every other spot a star explodes 

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:15.930
 this explosion these so-called supernova explosions 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.389
 a tremendous shock wave is released 

00:02:18.389 --> 00:02:21.289
 Well, of course, if here is a real shock wave like a bomb blast 

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:25.149
 You have to get over an oversized atomic bomb blast yourself 

00:02:25.149 --> 00:02:25.700
 presents 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.700
 if such a shock wave of their extermination in the kitchen pressure again 

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:33.729
 an explosion at this point keeps the cloud from collapsing further 

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:38.109
 so can a supernova explosion in a star formation area 

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:41.409
 that nothing new happens anymore so the star that Siebert 

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:42.429
 fly apart 

00:02:42.429 --> 00:02:45.649
 or at least that does not look like it can block 

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:48.809
 Of course there are a lot of smaller ones next to this giant big star 

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:50.810
 Stars have these giant stars 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.730
 since normal since five suns water so very big stars 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:54.940
 they will pass away like that 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.150
 "So a star we our sun with a solar mass 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.610
 will die much more unspectacularly, that is, influence on the 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.439
 immediate environments Solarworld is also the small but also lives a lot 

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:03.840
 trouble 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.969
 and because he lives much longer this star 

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:08.479
 Of course you can also go much further from your place of origin 

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:09.719
 have removed 

00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:13.150
 I already told the big stars to live the Soko who stay in the 

00:03:13.149 --> 00:03:14.389
 Near her birth 

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:18.019
 their birthplace while the one star that lives much longer 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:20.669
 of course, how much further away from their birthplace 

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:23.099
 so that one finds no connection at all between the 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:24.169
 little star 

00:03:24.169 --> 00:03:26.669
 like our sun and the big star 

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:28.769
 and Ilona birthplaces of the city 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:32.220
 in the way, we actually only know something about it today like this 

00:03:32.219 --> 00:03:33.719
 big stars 

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:39.020
 arise because they change their environment just as incredibly through their lives 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.589
 are called the signs of life through their signs of life 

00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:45.069
 very much radiation they make the gas glow 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:47.499
 This makes the star formation area wonderful 

00:03:47.499 --> 00:03:49.309
 Colors visible 

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:53.129
 si destroy these gas clouds again through the supernova explosions 

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:56.199
 and all the little stars that arise in the clouds 

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:57.470
 are very very much 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.070
 UN apparently but they do in large part 

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:04.339
 solid masses that we can still see 

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:06.549
 Gas clouds in such 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:09.430
 in such in manner as the Orion is supposed to 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.989
 There is a great deal in our Milky Way 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:15.309
 Overall, you have to say our Milky Way as a divorce Galaxy year 

00:04:15.309 --> 00:04:18.909
 his discs a large disc in the middle of the galaxy's GEX 

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:22.639
 Central area in the federation the gas clouds are only in the disk 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:24.580
 total of the total mass 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:25.640
 the Milky Way 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.390
 is only a tiny part of it still in such gas clouds the Milky Way has 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:32.910
 develops around ten or eleven billion years ago under the 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.840
 Meanwhile, she has implemented 80 percent of her gas mass in Stern 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.309
 and today are only 

00:04:38.309 --> 00:04:41.689
 between 10 and 20 percent of their total luminous mass 

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:43.259
 to follow in the gas 

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:44.900
 and these are gas clouds 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.830
 In fact, they possess the largest mass proportion of the interstellar medium 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:48.180
 are 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.510
 squeezed into areas the agreement of duty year great 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:55.550
 and between these gas clouds, the hot interest is Lara Medium 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:58.800
 Temperatures between 10 thousand degrees and a million degrees 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.819
 and that is way too hot and collapsing 

00:05:00.819 --> 00:05:04.509
 These gas were from the evening speech I lie in the evening 

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:07.819
 Range of minus 100 degrees Celsius and lower 

00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:11.539
 in order for the star to exist with a star must ever arise 

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:15.589
 the gas cloud from which it has formed is much colder yet it has to be 

00:05:15.589 --> 00:05:18.610
 between - one hundred and fifty in minus 200 degrees Celsius 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.089
 with it the gas 

00:05:20.089 --> 00:05:23.849
 Senner Gina has this gravity of the crew at all 

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:26.069
 can oppose 

00:05:26.069 --> 00:05:27.740
 and there's something going on in Zug 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:30.699
 These stars should make the gas clouds not just a giant big pile 

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:34.009
 but they almost always arise in multiple systems 

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:35.560
 multiple system means 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.680
 the stars almost never arise alone 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.610
 but it always creates several stars at the same time in a very narrow 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:41.419
 Surroundings 

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:44.449
 and so you know today that most stars are double stars 

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:45.410
 that is it is 

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:48.530
 There are multiple systems, that is, two or three star circles 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:49.330
 each other 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:50.960
 and you can imagine 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.610
 that of course in such systems there is hardly any possibility that percent 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:55.759
 Planets can emerge 

00:05:55.759 --> 00:05:59.370
 because all of them are remnants of a fog somewhere 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:00.319
 it can arise 

00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:02.740
 would fall on one of the two stars 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:05.930
 and there is no solar system at all that we imagine 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:08.110
 so you have to say that for most 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:09.830
 Stars in the Milky Way 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:13.310
 There is hardly a way to make such systems as the solar system 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:15.039
 and that is something we have today 

00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:16.389
 really learned 

00:06:16.389 --> 00:06:20.190
 to discontinue such as our sun are a peculiarity and 

00:06:20.189 --> 00:06:22.230
 possibly a special something you 

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:23.230
 their planets
