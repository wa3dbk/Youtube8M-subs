00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 Vladimir but you first of all accept 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.690
 congratulations on a good game against 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.450
 wings tips and here's the first question 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.130
 probably on this match principle like 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.000
 do you think it's a logical 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:19.020
 result thank you very much i think so 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.560
 that showed a very good game is not that 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.430
 that he is at home with a dynamo 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.840
 better already played compact played 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:30.020
 moments created a lot 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:33.640
 I do not think you could even win this 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:36.739
 the game at night is not lucky we must rejoice 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:40.640
 making money alone for a novel 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:41.660
 and in concentrating on the next game 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:46.550
 we need glasses 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:49.070
 recite please tell me you came here 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.350
 in the Urals and immediately spent two full 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.379
 games for this team can you say 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:57.440
 what do you feel teammates 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:58.760
 you feel like you know who will run 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.400
 already feel confident in 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:04.250
 tactical scheme or in principle there is 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.180
 still some problems with adaptation with 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.909
 by adaptation 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:14.060
 I think there is no problem, maybe the first game 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:16.240
 I almost knew what I was capable of 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.159
 well i think 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.430
 we have a very good team 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:24.060
 the team is good then the game will also be 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:27.040
 good just have to wait 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:30.520
 In general, what are the first impressions of 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:33.340
 teams from the club from the city city to me 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:36.180
 really liked and never been 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.180
 here and 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.799
 the team really liked the condition here 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.579
 normal all go football so 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.950
 now created just have to play say 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:49.280
 please here after the match with the dynamo 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:52.259
 the team was probably not at best 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:57.860
 psychological condition that's how you 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.860
 tried to fight it well yes 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:05.110
 firstly before the game dynamo very much 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:08.250
 people were injured and the trainer 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:12.569
 it became difficult to do 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:17.579
 I think even a little and 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:20.450
 mistaken too much in the game and tactics 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:24.900
 a little misunderstood 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:29.909
 so in religion right away 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:34.319
 punishes and then get up and with that 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:36.659
 when you are generally below it morally this 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:39.209
 This is a very difficult moment for us I am then 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:42.150
 my we got Alexey forces fall 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:45.260
 told me that the team was serious 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.739
 talking to each other is really true 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:51.269
 dorada 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:54.199
 Bill this talk more than once because 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:58.469
 that only three days came therefore 

00:02:54.199 --> 00:03:03.389
 Serious conversation I think is useful 

00:02:58.469 --> 00:03:05.879
 really waiting for the results as you think the Urals 

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:08.909
 this season what can 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:11.699
 wipe not fly clear yes so 

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:14.129
 challenge but is the team more capable 

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:16.759
 Here are your first feelings first 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:22.280
 must think not to believe 

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:25.019
 collect points and then when you already have 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.090
 number of cat points with which you are him 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:29.750
 you can not see there other goals 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.750
 can be set
