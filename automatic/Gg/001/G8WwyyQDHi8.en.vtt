00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:26.680
 of that armor brought in the previous video 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.450
 The video that came out earlier today was 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.570
 in that beautiful court we are already arriving 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:33.220

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:36.490
 we have to bust the guys here in the 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:38.800
 airport hangar then I gave that 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:41.500
 beautiful accelerated because it gets easier 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:44.820
 a lot faster so people are seeing 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:46.870

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:48.700
 strategically pay attention to 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:51.040
 not die for care 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:53.410
 The less you die the more money you go 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:56.080
 win and obviously I am a pilot myself 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:58.510
 I'm going to take the plane and deliver the fleece there. 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.700
 on the right floor so let's get out that 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:03.490
 with that beautiful fleece celebrated as I am 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:07.240
 I said let's go there by the airport near the 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:10.810
 pier galley is too much flip flop 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:13.180
 these assaults here sites are for 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:16.210

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:18.340
 including the rockstar server crashed 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:21.220
 Anyway, I think for sure because I had 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:23.620
 lots of people over people playing 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:25.810
 So I had that problem, but I already 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:28.270
 I got to play normally so let's go 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:30.220
 there was the landing gear normally 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:32.770

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:38.050
