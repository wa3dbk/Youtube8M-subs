about<00:02:27.860> layering<00:02:28.460> so<00:02:28.670> here<00:02:28.850> I'm<00:02:28.940> taking<00:02:29.120> the

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
about layering so here I'm taking the

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.720 
about layering so here I'm taking the
darker<00:02:30.230> brown<00:02:30.440> shadow<00:02:30.800> of<00:02:31.100> the<00:02:31.310> two<00:02:31.490> that<00:02:31.700> I
