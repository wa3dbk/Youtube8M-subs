00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:42.380 
some really some good tennis but I don't

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.380 
some really some good tennis but I don't
think<00:00:42.560> it's<00:00:42.770> been<00:00:43.220> Federer<00:00:43.700> at<00:00:43.940> his<00:00:44.090> very<00:00:44.270> best

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
think it's been Federer at his very best

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.360 
think it's been Federer at his very best
and<00:00:44.900> if<00:00:44.989> he's<00:00:45.110> going<00:00:45.320> to<00:00:45.440> be<00:00:45.620> the<00:00:45.680> Sangha<00:00:46.160> he

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
and if he's going to be the Sangha he

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:52.270 
and if he's going to be the Sangha he
needs<00:00:46.610> to<00:00:46.790> be<00:00:46.940> at<00:00:47.150> his<00:00:47.300> best

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.850 

look<00:00:52.820> song<00:00:53.030> I'd<00:00:53.149> like<00:00:53.180> to<00:00:53.329> try<00:00:53.719> to<00:00:53.809> dictate<00:00:54.140> to

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860

Roger<00:00:55.190> and<00:00:55.370> I<00:00:55.550> think<00:00:55.850> that<00:00:56.149> Roger<00:00:56.420> coming<00:00:57.350> into

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
Roger and I think that Roger coming into

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:58.779 
Roger and I think that Roger coming into
this<00:00:57.620> match<00:00:57.890> is<00:00:58.070> going<00:00:58.250> to<00:00:58.340> have<00:00:58.519> to<00:00:58.640> be<00:00:58.760> a

00:00:58.779 --> 00:00:58.789 
this match is going to have to be a

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:01.180 
this match is going to have to be a
little<00:00:58.969> bit<00:00:59.180> more<00:00:59.329> proactive<00:00:59.960> but<00:00:59.989> also<00:01:00.350> be<00:01:01.160> a

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
little bit more proactive but also be a

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.610 
little bit more proactive but also be a
little<00:01:01.399> patient<00:01:01.760> and<00:01:02.269> build<00:01:02.780> and<00:01:03.050> structure

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:03.620 
little patient and build and structure

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.340 
little patient and build and structure
is<00:01:03.769> points<00:01:04.280> so<00:01:04.519> we've<00:01:05.449> talked<00:01:05.750> about<00:01:05.930> the

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
is points so we've talked about the

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.140 
is points so we've talked about the
other<00:01:06.470> day<00:01:06.619> I<00:01:06.799> talked<00:01:07.400> about<00:01:07.490> with<00:01:07.790> air<00:01:07.909> berg

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.150 
other day I talked about with air berg

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.480 
other day I talked about with air berg
being<00:01:08.390> in<00:01:08.509> the<00:01:08.600> coach's<00:01:09.080> box<00:01:09.290> i<00:01:09.590> think<00:01:10.130> this<00:01:10.280> is

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
being in the coach's box i think this is

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.430 
being in the coach's box i think this is
a<00:01:10.520> match<00:01:10.790> where<00:01:11.060> we've<00:01:11.180> got<00:01:11.360> to<00:01:11.479> see<00:01:11.690> Federer

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:12.440 
a match where we've got to see Federer

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.070 
a match where we've got to see Federer
played<00:01:12.770> tactically<00:01:13.399> smart<00:01:13.880> and<00:01:14.180> not<00:01:14.690> try<00:01:15.049> to

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
have to create points where he can

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.620

structure a way to get to the net take

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.109 
structure a way to get to the net take
volleys<00:01:21.049> on<00:01:21.259> serve<00:01:21.860> and<00:01:22.100> volley<00:01:22.130> occasionally

and make song a Miss by some are being a

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.910 
and make song a Miss by some are being a
little<00:01:26.000> bit<00:01:26.179> more<00:01:26.360> impatient<00:01:26.720> and<00:01:27.229> playing

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
little bit more impatient and playing

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:34.180 
little bit more impatient and playing
low-risk<00:01:28.460> shots<00:01:32.500> well<00:01:33.500> I<00:01:33.530> think<00:01:33.740> summer<00:01:33.950> goes

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:34.190 
low-risk shots well I think summer goes

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.790 
low-risk shots well I think summer goes
into<00:01:34.460> this<00:01:34.550> match<00:01:34.990> pretty<00:01:35.990> confident<00:01:36.500> that<00:01:36.560> he

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:36.800 
into this match pretty confident that he

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.859 
into this match pretty confident that he
can<00:01:36.950> be<00:01:37.130> trudging<00:01:37.399> I<00:01:37.850> guess<00:01:38.300> when<00:01:38.479> you<00:01:38.569> look<00:01:38.750> at

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
can be trudging I guess when you look at

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:40.990 
can be trudging I guess when you look at
the<00:01:38.960> history<00:01:39.110> you<00:01:39.530> will<00:01:40.190> be<00:01:40.369> surprised<00:01:40.789> at

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
the history you will be surprised at

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.850 
the history you will be surprised at
that<00:01:41.030> but<00:01:41.330> they<00:01:41.420> last<00:01:41.899> the<00:01:42.080> last<00:01:42.350> time<00:01:42.679> they

summer one that on clay I know Roger was
potentially<00:01:49.159> had<00:01:49.340> a<00:01:49.369> few<00:01:49.640> little<00:01:49.729> back<00:01:50.060> issues

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509

just<00:02:08.259> a<00:02:08.380> week<00:02:08.619> ago<00:02:08.830> a<00:02:09.250> little<00:02:09.489> over<00:02:09.700> a<00:02:09.970> week<00:02:10.119> ago

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
just a week ago a little over a week ago

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.449 
just a week ago a little over a week ago
here<00:02:10.780> at<00:02:10.810> melbourne<00:02:11.260> park<00:02:11.290> on<00:02:11.709> the<00:02:11.770> same<00:02:12.040> court

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
here at melbourne park on the same court

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:15.660 
here at melbourne park on the same court
and<00:02:12.760> i<00:02:13.300> don't<00:02:13.780> think<00:02:13.870> that<00:02:14.170> as<00:02:14.500> anything<00:02:15.220> to<00:02:15.489> do

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
and i don't think that as anything to do

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.460 
and i don't think that as anything to do
what<00:02:16.000> this<00:02:16.180> match<00:02:16.450> is<00:02:16.660> going<00:02:16.690> to<00:02:16.989> be<00:02:17.080> like<00:02:17.230> I

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
what this match is going to be like I

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.120 
what this match is going to be like I
think<00:02:17.769> that<00:02:17.920> was<00:02:18.099> a<00:02:18.130> real<00:02:18.900> it<00:02:19.900> was<00:02:20.140> nice<00:02:20.349> it<00:02:20.950> was

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
think that was a real it was nice it was

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.729 
think that was a real it was nice it was
an<00:02:21.250> exhibition<00:02:21.910> and<00:02:22.090> Roger<00:02:22.660> is<00:02:23.019> supposed<00:02:23.530> to

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
an exhibition and Roger is supposed to

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:25.320 
an exhibition and Roger is supposed to
win<00:02:23.920> that<00:02:24.130> match<00:02:24.370> because<00:02:24.640> it<00:02:24.819> was<00:02:24.910> his<00:02:25.090> night

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
win that match because it was his night

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.390 
win that match because it was his night
so<00:02:25.870> I<00:02:25.900> think<00:02:26.110> this<00:02:26.410> will<00:02:26.560> be<00:02:26.620> a<00:02:26.739> completely

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
so I think this will be a completely

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.100 
so I think this will be a completely
different<00:02:27.970> occasion<00:02:28.450> when<00:02:28.599> they<00:02:28.690> walk<00:02:28.900> out

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
different occasion when they walk out

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.430 
different occasion when they walk out
here<00:02:29.530> and<00:02:29.940> if<00:02:30.940> I<00:02:31.090> was<00:02:31.239> to<00:02:31.420> pick<00:02:31.690> a<00:02:31.720> winner<00:02:32.080> I

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
here and if I was to pick a winner I

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.070 
here and if I was to pick a winner I
would<00:02:33.280> be<00:02:33.430> slightly<00:02:33.849> leaning<00:02:34.300> towards<00:02:34.780> sauna

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
would be slightly leaning towards sauna

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.739 
would be slightly leaning towards sauna
at<00:02:35.290> this<00:02:35.440> stage
