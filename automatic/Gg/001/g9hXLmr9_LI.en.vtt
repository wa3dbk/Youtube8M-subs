00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:41.530 
get this bolt on down loosen this one up

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.400 
get this bolt on down loosen this one up
undo<00:00:42.530> this<00:00:42.679> bolt<00:00:42.920> this<00:00:43.879> you<00:00:44.570> can<00:00:44.870> pull<00:00:45.199> out<00:00:45.379> a

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
undo this bolt this you can pull out a

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.150 
undo this bolt this you can pull out a
little<00:00:45.710> bit<00:00:45.949> then<00:00:46.989> when<00:00:47.989> you<00:00:48.079> drive<00:00:48.350> axle<00:00:48.890> will

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.160 
little bit then when you drive axle will

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.630 
little bit then when you drive axle will
slide<00:00:49.609> over<00:00:49.910> there<00:00:50.269> it<00:00:50.539> is<00:00:50.750> a<00:00:50.809> fit<00:00:51.350> a<00:00:51.769> little

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
slide over there it is a fit a little

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:59.369 
slide over there it is a fit a little
bit<00:00:52.789> of<00:00:53.920> tight<00:00:54.920> fit<00:00:55.280> but<00:00:57.219> all<00:00:58.219> right<00:00:58.339> it<00:00:58.850> works

00:00:59.369 --> 00:00:59.379 
bit of tight fit but all right it works

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:04.390 
bit of tight fit but all right it works
and<00:01:00.379> that's<00:01:00.530> all<00:01:00.949> gone<00:01:01.570> that's<00:01:02.570> new<00:01:02.960> one<00:01:03.400> so

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
and that's all gone that's new one so

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:31.010 
and that's all gone that's new one so
I'll<00:01:05.210> show<00:01:05.540> you<00:01:05.600> where<00:01:05.870> to<00:01:05.990> PI

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.630 

this<00:01:32.020> is<00:01:32.230> pretty<00:01:32.500> much<00:01:32.620> the<00:01:33.930> new<00:01:34.930> end<00:01:35.640> this

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
this is pretty much the new end this

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.050 
this is pretty much the new end this
where<00:01:36.880> it<00:01:36.970> slides<00:01:37.240> into<00:01:37.600> you<00:01:37.900> just<00:01:38.110> have<00:01:38.320> to

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
where it slides into you just have to

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.820 
where it slides into you just have to
pry<00:01:40.060> this<00:01:40.120> out<00:01:40.540> right<00:01:40.750> here<00:01:41.110> and<00:01:41.410> then<00:01:41.530> the<00:01:41.650> old

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:41.830 
pry this out right here and then the old

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.390 
pry this out right here and then the old
one<00:01:42.070> will<00:01:42.340> slide<00:01:42.820> out<00:01:43.140> so<00:01:44.140> connect<00:01:45.070> to<00:01:45.250> the

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:45.400 
one will slide out so connect to the

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:57.719 
one will slide out so connect to the
shaft<00:01:45.670> that<00:01:46.000> goes<00:01:46.530> all<00:01:47.530> the<00:01:47.590> way<00:01:47.740> across<00:01:56.729> like

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
shaft that goes all the way across like

00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:59.810 
shaft that goes all the way across like
I<00:01:57.850> said<00:01:58.090> that's<00:01:58.210> pretty<00:01:58.450> much<00:01:58.660> it<00:01:58.990> you<00:01:59.170> know

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
I said that's pretty much it you know

I said that's pretty much it you know
don't<00:02:00.820> have<00:02:00.910> to<00:02:01.060> do<00:02:01.180> a<00:02:01.210> lot<00:02:01.479> just<00:02:02.080> it's<00:02:02.290> not

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:02.760 
don't have to do a lot just it's not

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:10.160 
don't have to do a lot just it's not
this<00:02:03.760> bolt<00:02:04.860> and<00:02:06.030> she'll<00:02:07.030> tightly<00:02:07.750> come<00:02:08.709> out<00:02:08.860> so

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
this bolt and she'll tightly come out so

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.530
