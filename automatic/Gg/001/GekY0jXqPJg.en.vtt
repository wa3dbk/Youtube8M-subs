00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
of turds as you can see I've actually

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.130 
of turds as you can see I've actually
yet<00:00:36.450> to<00:00:36.660> go<00:00:36.840> to<00:00:36.899> a<00:00:37.649> pet<00:00:38.370> shop<00:00:38.399> to<00:00:39.030> buy<00:00:39.300> crickets

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
yet to go to a pet shop to buy crickets

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.389 
yet to go to a pet shop to buy crickets
I<00:00:40.170> haven't<00:00:40.620> had<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:41.129> order<00:00:42.030> any<00:00:42.329> crickets

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:43.399 
I haven't had to order any crickets

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:46.970 
I haven't had to order any crickets
they're<00:00:44.399> basically<00:00:44.910> just<00:00:45.210> breeding<00:00:45.870> away<00:00:46.110> but

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
they're basically just breeding away but

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.680 
they're basically just breeding away but
um<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.399> main<00:00:47.579> reason<00:00:47.969> why<00:00:48.120> I'm<00:00:48.210> making<00:00:48.270> this

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
um the main reason why I'm making this

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.790 
um the main reason why I'm making this
one<00:00:48.750> is<00:00:49.230> I<00:00:49.980> put<00:00:50.910> these<00:00:51.510> pregnant<00:00:52.020> females<00:00:52.500> in

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
one is I put these pregnant females in

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.910 
one is I put these pregnant females in
this<00:00:53.430> I<00:00:53.930> think<00:00:54.930> about<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.969> week<00:00:56.969> ago

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
this I think about a week ago

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.920 
this I think about a week ago
these<00:00:58.920> hatched<00:00:59.219> out<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.969> fastest<00:01:00.719> I've<00:01:00.899> ever

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
these hatched out the fastest I've ever

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.139 
these hatched out the fastest I've ever
had<00:01:01.530> any<00:01:01.829> Hatcher's<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:02.670> I<00:01:02.730> don't<00:01:02.789> know<00:01:03.000> if

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
had any Hatcher's and I don't know if

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.260 
had any Hatcher's and I don't know if
it's<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.780> medium<00:01:04.260> that<00:01:04.439> I<00:01:04.470> used<00:01:04.909> for<00:01:05.909> the

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
it's the medium that I used for the

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.469 
it's the medium that I used for the
egg-laying<00:01:06.869> and<00:01:07.549> keep<00:01:08.549> my<00:01:08.729> temperatures<00:01:09.270> at

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
egg-laying and keep my temperatures at

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.170 
egg-laying and keep my temperatures at
about<00:01:09.830> 90<00:01:10.830> degrees<00:01:10.860> on<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.610> bottom<00:01:11.939> of<00:01:12.060> the

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
about 90 degrees on the bottom of the

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.620 
about 90 degrees on the bottom of the
cup<00:01:12.390> maybe<00:01:12.869> 85<00:01:13.470> or<00:01:13.650> so<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:14.130> I'm<00:01:14.939> using<00:01:15.180> place

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
cup maybe 85 or so and I'm using place

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.920 
cup maybe 85 or so and I'm using place
and<00:01:15.960> with<00:01:16.350> a<00:01:16.380> mix<00:01:16.830> of<00:01:17.009> rope<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:18.030> she's<00:01:18.299> super

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
and with a mix of rope a she's super

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.160 
and with a mix of rope a she's super
hatch<00:01:19.170> it<00:01:19.770> keeps<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.189> sand<00:01:20.490> more<00:01:21.030> moist<00:01:21.330> so<00:01:22.110> I

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
hatch it keeps the sand more moist so I

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.620 
hatch it keeps the sand more moist so I
don't<00:01:22.350> have<00:01:22.470> to<00:01:22.590> keep<00:01:22.770> wetting<00:01:23.070> it<00:01:23.340> off

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
don't have to keep wetting it off

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.120 
don't have to keep wetting it off
they've<00:01:24.630> only<00:01:24.810> been<00:01:25.020> in<00:01:25.080> here<00:01:25.409> for<00:01:25.710> about<00:01:25.920> a

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
they've only been in here for about a

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.080 
they've only been in here for about a
week<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.970> all<00:01:27.270> those<00:01:27.689> dots<00:01:28.110> are<00:01:28.590> all<00:01:29.400> crickets

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
week and all those dots are all crickets

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.450 
week and all those dots are all crickets
it's<00:01:30.689> crazy<00:01:33.740> it's<00:01:34.740> hard<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:35.040> see<00:01:35.220> how<00:01:35.400> many

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
it's crazy it's hard to see how many

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.700 
it's crazy it's hard to see how many
there<00:01:35.909> really<00:01:36.119> is<00:01:36.360> but<00:01:36.659> they're<00:01:36.869> all<00:01:36.990> popping

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
out in there all over the place and I

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.719 
out in there all over the place and I
don't<00:01:43.439> know<00:01:43.590> it<00:01:43.740> seems<00:01:43.950> to<00:01:44.070> work<00:01:44.130> really<00:01:44.280> good

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
don't know it seems to work really good

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.819 
don't know it seems to work really good
with<00:01:44.909> that<00:01:45.090> mix<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:45.630> I<00:01:45.720> keep<00:01:45.960> it<00:01:46.110> moist<00:01:46.439> I

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
with that mix and I keep it moist I

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.600 
with that mix and I keep it moist I
spray<00:01:47.640> these<00:01:48.140> spray<00:01:49.140> it<00:01:49.229> down<00:01:49.380> mist<00:01:49.950> it<00:01:50.130> once<00:01:50.490> a

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610

day and if you can see there's a little
bit<00:01:52.290> of<00:01:52.530> moisture<00:01:53.130> on<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.700> walls<00:01:54.360> but<00:01:55.229> I<00:01:55.290> put

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
bit of moisture on the walls but I put

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.830 
bit of moisture on the walls but I put
down<00:01:55.799> a<00:01:55.860> paper<00:01:56.579> towel<00:01:56.939> so<00:01:56.969> that<00:01:57.299> you<00:01:57.509> don't<00:01:57.689> get

down a paper towel so that you don't get

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.569 
down a paper towel so that you don't get
any<00:01:57.990> pooling<00:01:58.500> of<00:01:58.590> water<00:01:58.829> because<00:01:59.340> you<00:01:59.430> don't

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
any pooling of water because you don't

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.319
