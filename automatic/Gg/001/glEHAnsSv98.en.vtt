00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
and I guess we just try to manage

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.799 
and I guess we just try to manage
ourselves<00:00:08.429> as<00:00:08.790> close<00:00:09.000> to<00:00:09.150> a<00:00:09.179> bus<00:00:09.420> the<00:00:09.630> type

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
ourselves as close to a bus the type

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.470 
ourselves as close to a bus the type

program as we can because the local of

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.829 
program as we can because the local of
players<00:00:12.780> amount<00:00:13.620> of<00:00:13.679> practices<00:00:14.070> we<00:00:14.219> are

conditioning<00:00:15.839> elbows<00:00:17.150> rugby's<00:00:18.150> a<00:00:18.270> little<00:00:18.449> bit

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
conditioning elbows rugby's a little bit

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:19.910 
conditioning elbows rugby's a little bit
different<00:00:18.810> than<00:00:18.930> a<00:00:18.960> lot<00:00:19.080> of<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.199> other<00:00:19.350> clubs

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
different than a lot of the other clubs

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.620 
different than a lot of the other clubs
and<00:00:20.100> this<00:00:20.550> is<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:20.850> highest<00:00:21.000> level<00:00:21.390> you<00:00:21.480> can

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
and this is the highest level you can

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.019 
and this is the highest level you can
play<00:00:21.840> is<00:00:22.260> building<00:00:22.619> a<00:00:22.650> collegiate<00:00:23.070> levels<00:00:23.970> to

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
play is building a collegiate levels to

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.210 
play is building a collegiate levels to
their<00:00:24.150> own<00:00:24.240> in<00:00:24.420> gusty<00:00:24.779> perhaps<00:00:25.170> was<00:00:25.500> mostly

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
their own in gusty perhaps was mostly

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.470 
their own in gusty perhaps was mostly
other<00:00:26.340> clubs<00:00:26.580> sports<00:00:26.820> those<00:00:27.029> of<00:00:27.150> us<00:00:27.300> the

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
other clubs sports those of us the

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.330 
other clubs sports those of us the
option<00:00:27.660> for<00:00:28.320> those<00:00:28.470> so<00:00:28.920> it's<00:00:29.039> a<00:00:29.099> little<00:00:29.220> bit

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
option for those so it's a little bit

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.529 
option for those so it's a little bit
different<00:00:29.670> something<00:00:29.939> yeah<00:00:30.390> I<00:00:30.420> think

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
different something yeah I think

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.810 
different something yeah I think
probably<00:00:30.840> one<00:00:31.080> of<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.230> most<00:00:31.320> of<00:00:31.529> us<00:00:31.679> clubs<00:00:32.460> on

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
probably one of the most of us clubs on

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.850 
probably one of the most of us clubs on

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
plane for the first time when they're

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.639

they<00:00:55.739> get<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:55.949> go<00:00:56.039> see<00:00:56.280> pretty<00:00:57.059> good<00:00:57.800> this<00:00:58.800> team

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
they get to go see pretty good this team

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.290 
they get to go see pretty good this team
we<00:00:59.460> actually<00:00:59.760> probably<00:01:00.090> have<00:01:01.940> more<00:01:02.940> than<00:01:03.120> half

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
we actually probably have more than half

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.640 
we actually probably have more than half
the<00:01:03.510> new<00:01:03.629> players<00:01:03.899> that<00:01:04.049> come<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.379> team<00:01:04.530> of

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
the new players that come to the team of

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.660 
the new players that come to the team of
actually<00:01:04.860> played<00:01:05.070> quite<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.309> bit<00:01:05.460> in<00:01:05.489> high

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
actually played quite a bit in high

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.200 
actually played quite a bit in high
school<00:01:05.909> so<00:01:07.400> experience<00:01:08.400> in<00:01:08.760> to<00:01:08.909> obtain

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.020 

results<00:01:12.229> on<00:01:13.229> a<00:01:13.260> field<00:01:13.670> there's<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.729> couple<00:01:14.850> of

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
results on a field there's a couple of

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.550 
results on a field there's a couple of
sort<00:01:15.180> of<00:01:15.240> unofficial<00:01:15.390> ranking<00:01:15.930> Sciences<00:01:16.380> on

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
sort of unofficial ranking Sciences on

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.130 
sort of unofficial ranking Sciences on
one<00:01:16.740> or<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.159> soda<00:01:17.430> in<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.820> top<00:01:18.030> 10<00:01:18.270> around<00:01:18.780> 10<00:01:18.990> or

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
one or a soda in the top 10 around 10 or

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.230 
one or a soda in the top 10 around 10 or
so<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:19.439> then<00:01:19.500> one<00:01:19.710> for<00:01:20.280> around<00:01:20.430> 20<00:01:20.820> or<00:01:20.909> so<00:01:21.060> like

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
so and then one for around 20 or so like

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.300 
so and then one for around 20 or so like
that<00:01:21.420> so<00:01:21.840> I<00:01:22.110> think<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.619> team<00:01:22.799> is<00:01:22.830> somewhere<00:01:23.189> in

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
that so I think the team is somewhere in

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.480 
that so I think the team is somewhere in
between<00:01:23.340> those<00:01:23.759> from<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.119> realistic<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:25.490> give

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
between those from a realistic and give

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.039 
between those from a realistic and give
ourselves<00:01:26.580> a<00:01:26.820> chance<00:01:26.850> we<00:01:27.299> want<00:01:27.509> whales<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:27.930> get

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
ourselves a chance we want whales to get

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.899 
ourselves a chance we want whales to get
all<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.259> photos<00:01:28.560> ok<00:01:28.950> so<00:01:29.009> today<00:01:29.490> we<00:01:29.549> played<00:01:29.700> sam

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
all the photos ok so today we played sam

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.330 
all the photos ok so today we played sam
houston<00:01:30.210> state<00:01:30.240> so<00:01:30.689> it's<00:01:30.840> one<00:01:30.960> of<00:01:31.049> our<00:01:31.340> texas

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
houston state so it's one of our texas

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.010 
houston state so it's one of our texas
league<00:01:32.520> matches<00:01:32.729> so<00:01:33.210> we<00:01:33.390> don't<00:01:33.570> play<00:01:33.720> in<00:01:33.869> like

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
league matches so we don't play in like

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.179 
league matches so we don't play in like
the<00:01:34.140> big<00:01:34.290> 12<00:01:34.560> conference<00:01:34.619> or<00:01:34.979> anything<00:01:35.159> like

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
the big 12 conference or anything like

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.010 
the big 12 conference or anything like
that<00:01:35.280> so<00:01:35.520> can<00:01:35.670> be<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:35.759> little<00:01:35.850> bit<00:01:36.000> confusing<00:01:36.360> so

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
that so can be a little bit confusing so

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.760 
that so can be a little bit confusing so
they're<00:01:37.140> one<00:01:37.259> of<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.380> Division<00:01:37.740> one

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
they're one of the Division one

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.580 
they're one of the Division one
collision<00:01:38.430> teams<00:01:38.610> that<00:01:38.759> we<00:01:38.850> play<00:01:39.229> so<00:01:40.229> we're<00:01:40.380> 3

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
collision teams that we play so we're 3

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.249 
collision teams that we play so we're 3
