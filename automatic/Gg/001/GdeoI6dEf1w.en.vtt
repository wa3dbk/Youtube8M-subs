sense<00:00:30.800> to<00:00:31.460> do<00:00:31.580> this<00:00:31.730> so<00:00:32.630> what<00:00:32.900> we<00:00:33.020> tried<00:00:33.350> to<00:00:33.590> do

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:33.770 
sense to do this so what we tried to do

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.780 
sense to do this so what we tried to do
was<00:00:34.720> use<00:00:35.720> the<00:00:35.990> cold<00:00:36.260> temperatures<00:00:36.800> outside<00:00:37.010> to

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:37.790 
was use the cold temperatures outside to

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:39.490 
was use the cold temperatures outside to
keep<00:00:38.270> the<00:00:38.510> refrigerator<00:00:39.050> and<00:00:39.320> the<00:00:39.470> freezer

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
we just put into the refrigerator and

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.550 
we just put into the refrigerator and
the<00:01:10.100> gas<00:01:10.610> rises<00:01:11.510> to<00:01:11.720> the<00:01:11.750> top<00:01:11.870> of<00:01:12.230> the<00:01:12.290> thermal

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
and when it hits the cold outside air

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.570 
and when it hits the cold outside air
the<00:01:20.030> refrigerant<00:01:20.480> condenses<00:01:21.050> and<00:01:21.350> flows<00:01:22.220> back

people consider a problem or a detriment
up<00:01:48.370> here<00:01:48.580> we<00:01:49.240> can<00:01:49.330> use<00:01:49.390> to<00:01:49.630> our<00:01:49.690> advantage

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
up here we can use to our advantage

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.080 
up here we can use to our advantage
sub-zero<00:01:52.270> temperatures<00:01:53.550> not<00:01:54.550> everyone<00:01:54.880> likes

sub-zero temperatures not everyone likes
that<00:01:55.330> but<00:01:55.570> you<00:01:55.810> can<00:01:55.960> take<00:01:56.110> advantage<00:01:56.500> of<00:01:56.590> that

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
that but you can take advantage of that

problem with cold air in Fairbanks is

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.300 
problem with cold air in Fairbanks is
it's<00:02:22.060> too<00:02:22.240> dry<00:02:22.800> everything<00:02:23.800> in<00:02:23.920> your<00:02:24.070> freezer

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
it's too dry everything in your freezer

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.420 
it's too dry everything in your freezer
will<00:02:24.700> get<00:02:25.150> really<00:02:25.480> desiccated<00:02:26.170> in<00:02:26.350> the<00:02:27.190> dry

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430

air the problem with a refrigerator and

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.010 
air the problem with a refrigerator and
the<00:02:30.790> dry<00:02:31.000> cold<00:02:31.240> air<00:02:31.480> is<00:02:31.630> it's<00:02:31.870> not

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
the dry cold air is it's not

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.330 
the dry cold air is it's not
controllable<00:02:32.740> and<00:02:32.830> everything<00:02:33.190> in<00:02:33.280> the

this may not really be appetizing in
lower<00:03:57.600> 48<00:03:58.020> because<00:03:58.290> their<00:03:58.440> energy<00:03:58.770> costs<00:03:59.040> are

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
lower 48 because their energy costs are

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.460 
lower 48 because their energy costs are
so<00:03:59.310> low<00:03:59.570> it's<00:04:00.570> more<00:04:00.840> a<00:04:01.140> little<00:04:01.410> more

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
so low it's more a little more

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.690 
so low it's more a little more
appetizing<00:04:01.710> up<00:04:02.280> here<00:04:02.550> we<00:04:03.270> saw<00:04:04.220> the<00:04:05.220> mechanical

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
appetizing up here we saw the mechanical

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.490 
appetizing up here we saw the mechanical

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
three months in the dead of winter yeah

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.000 
three months in the dead of winter yeah
there<00:04:09.810> were<00:04:09.870> some<00:04:09.900> savings<00:04:10.500> doing<00:04:10.800> it<00:04:10.920> in

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
there were some savings doing it in

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.950 
there were some savings doing it in

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
but our cost per kilowatt hour is

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.880 
but our cost per kilowatt hour is
actually<00:04:15.810> very<00:04:16.380> low<00:04:17.120> versus<00:04:18.120> the<00:04:18.239> villages

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:18.890 
actually very low versus the villages

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:21.500 
actually very low versus the villages
there's<00:04:19.890> to<00:04:20.070> be<00:04:20.220> three<00:04:20.610> to<00:04:21.000> four<00:04:21.180> times<00:04:21.390> higher

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
there's to be three to four times higher

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.020 
there's to be three to four times higher
than<00:04:21.870> ours<00:04:22.049> and<00:04:22.320> it<00:04:23.280> could<00:04:23.460> very<00:04:23.490> well<00:04:23.730> make

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
which is a EPA regulated substance so we

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.459 
which is a EPA regulated substance so we
had<00:04:40.229> to<00:04:40.319> have<00:04:40.529> a<00:04:40.969> refrigerant<00:04:42.469> technician

00:04:43.459 --> 00:04:43.469 
had to have a refrigerant technician

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:45.679 
had to have a refrigerant technician
come<00:04:43.860> and<00:04:44.189> help<00:04:44.789> us<00:04:44.969> build<00:04:45.149> the<00:04:45.389> thermal

00:04:49.489 --> 00:04:49.499 
siphon it might seem simple but you

00:04:49.499 --> 00:04:52.459 
siphon it might seem simple but you

00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:52.469 
could get hurt and it's really about the

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:54.829 
could get hurt and it's really about the
