00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.240 
really thick and creamy but I've found
that<00:02:45.030> it<00:02:45.209> works<00:02:45.420> best<00:02:45.720> if<00:02:45.930> you<00:02:46.200> don't<00:02:46.680> wet<00:02:47.100> your

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
that it works best if you don't wet your

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.160 
that it works best if you don't wet your
eyes<00:02:47.430> before<00:02:47.910> so<00:02:48.120> I<00:02:48.150> do<00:02:48.300> this<00:02:48.570> before<00:02:48.750> I<00:02:48.959> get<00:02:49.110> in

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
eyes before so I do this before I get in

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.980 
eyes before so I do this before I get in

dime<00:02:52.260> sized<00:02:52.530> amount<00:02:52.800> to<00:02:53.010> my<00:02:53.100> eye<00:02:53.130> says<00:02:53.910> you

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
dime sized amount to my eye says you

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.820

let<00:03:00.300> your<00:03:00.450> eye<00:03:00.480> first<00:03:00.810> and<00:03:01.260> then<00:03:01.800> you<00:03:01.980> just

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
let your eye first and then you just

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.680 
let your eye first and then you just
wipe<00:03:02.340> it<00:03:02.490> off<00:03:02.610> with<00:03:02.670> a<00:03:02.910> cloth<00:03:03.090> and<00:03:03.450> then<00:03:03.540> it's

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
wipe it off with a cloth and then it's

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.229 
wipe it off with a cloth and then it's
all<00:03:03.810> gone<00:03:03.989> so<00:03:04.489> it<00:03:05.489> works<00:03:05.700> it<00:03:05.880> just<00:03:06.030> takes<00:03:06.180> a

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
all gone so it works it just takes a

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:07.729 
all gone so it works it just takes a
little<00:03:06.360> more<00:03:06.510> work<00:03:06.570> and<00:03:06.840> then<00:03:06.989> I'll<00:03:07.110> just<00:03:07.560> do

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
little more work and then I'll just do

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:11.150 
little more work and then I'll just do
this<00:03:07.950> for<00:03:08.130> my<00:03:08.220> face<00:03:08.459> in<00:03:08.640> the<00:03:08.760> shower<00:03:08.970> and<00:03:10.160> next

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
all the way out to this crease here just

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.060 
all the way out to this crease here just
kind<00:03:21.000> of<00:03:21.030> sort<00:03:21.720> of<00:03:21.810> to<00:03:21.959> prevent<00:03:22.380> wrinkles<00:03:22.530> also
