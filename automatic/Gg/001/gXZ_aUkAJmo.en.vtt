really<00:01:07.790> absolutely<00:01:08.720> no<00:01:08.870> difference<00:01:09.080> so

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
really absolutely no difference so

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.969 
really absolutely no difference so
putting<00:01:10.460> them<00:01:10.610> next<00:01:10.760> to<00:01:11.030> each<00:01:11.090> other<00:01:11.979> you'll

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
putting them next to each other you'll

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:15.430 
putting them next to each other you'll
see<00:01:13.159> you've<00:01:13.340> got<00:01:13.490> the<00:01:13.640> same<00:01:13.820> tail<00:01:14.120> length<00:01:14.450> same

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:15.440 
see you've got the same tail length same

little<00:02:50.230> hook<00:02:50.439> up<00:02:50.620> coming<00:02:51.549> off<00:02:51.700> the<00:02:52.299> old

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
little hook up coming off the old

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:00.219

00:03:00.219 --> 00:03:04.409 
just comes tucked in there the one thing
that<00:03:00.480> I've<00:03:01.480> noticed<00:03:01.840> during<00:03:02.469> flight<00:03:03.419> there's

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:04.419 
that I've noticed during flight there's

00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:05.909 
that I've noticed during flight there's
a<00:03:04.480> little<00:03:04.599> problem<00:03:04.750> still<00:03:05.200> dealing<00:03:05.500> with<00:03:05.530> on

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:05.919 
a little problem still dealing with on

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:09.330 
a little problem still dealing with on
the<00:03:06.909> brushless<00:03:07.629> is<00:03:08.109> a<00:03:08.319> little<00:03:08.590> more<00:03:08.739> weight<00:03:08.980> up

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
the brushless is a little more weight up

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.270 
the brushless is a little more weight up
front<00:03:09.540> the<00:03:10.540> CG<00:03:11.200> seems<00:03:11.590> to<00:03:11.739> be<00:03:11.859> a<00:03:11.889> little<00:03:12.189> bit

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.710 
front the CG seems to be a little bit
off<00:03:12.519> whereas<00:03:13.120> the<00:03:13.389> 43<00:03:14.400> brushed<00:03:15.400> is<00:03:15.790> perfectly

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:27.609 
not as easy as a coax but given its size

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:31.800 
not as easy as a coax but given its size
it's<00:03:28.209> really<00:03:28.989> stable<00:03:29.819> the<00:03:30.819> brushless<00:03:31.120> isn't

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
it's really stable the brushless isn't

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:35.969 
as stable illness taking off it's
definitely<00:03:34.540> heavier<00:03:35.049> you<00:03:35.349> feel<00:03:35.590> the<00:03:35.769> extra

00:03:35.969 --> 00:03:35.979 
definitely heavier you feel the extra

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:39.569 
definitely heavier you feel the extra
weight<00:03:36.599> it's<00:03:37.599> really<00:03:38.049> noticeable<00:03:38.650> as<00:03:38.919> you

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:39.579 
weight it's really noticeable as you

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:41.759 
weight it's really noticeable as you
lift<00:03:39.790> off<00:03:40.000> it's<00:03:40.239> very<00:03:40.449> very<00:03:41.139> difficult<00:03:41.199> to

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769 
lift off it's very very difficult to

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:44.099 
lift off it's very very difficult to
keep<00:03:41.889> it<00:03:42.069> steady<00:03:42.430> without<00:03:43.389> sliding<00:03:43.689> a<00:03:43.900> little

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:44.109 
keep it steady without sliding a little

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:46.110 
keep it steady without sliding a little
bit<00:03:44.229> to<00:03:44.349> the<00:03:44.470> side<00:03:44.620> on<00:03:44.889> takeoff<00:03:45.340> in<00:03:45.579> comparison

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
bit to the side on takeoff in comparison

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.809 
bit to the side on takeoff in comparison
to<00:03:46.329> the<00:03:46.359> brushed<00:03:47.259> version<00:03:47.709> but<00:03:48.280> it's<00:03:48.549> also<00:03:48.699> a

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:48.819 
to the brushed version but it's also a

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:51.719 
to the brushed version but it's also a
little<00:03:49.000> bit<00:03:49.199> top-heavy<00:03:50.430> so<00:03:51.430> if<00:03:51.579> you're

00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:51.729 
little bit top-heavy so if you're

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:53.999 
little bit top-heavy so if you're
hanging<00:03:51.909> it's<00:03:52.449> probably<00:03:53.349> not<00:03:53.530> real<00:03:53.739> easy

00:03:53.999 --> 00:03:54.009 
hanging it's probably not real easy

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:55.979 
hanging it's probably not real easy
telling<00:03:54.340> the<00:03:54.430> video<00:03:54.699> but<00:03:54.970> it<00:03:55.090> does<00:03:55.299> actually

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989 
telling the video but it does actually

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:59.610 
telling the video but it does actually
hang<00:03:56.500> just<00:03:56.769> a<00:03:56.919> little<00:03:57.189> bit<00:03:57.509> forward<00:03:58.509> by<00:03:59.199> the

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
hang just a little bit forward by the

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.649 
hang just a little bit forward by the
fly<00:04:00.400> bar<00:04:00.639> and<00:04:00.909> especially<00:04:01.150> if<00:04:01.299> you<00:04:01.359> put<00:04:01.509> it<00:04:01.569> on

00:04:01.649 --> 00:04:01.659 
fly bar and especially if you put it on

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:05.999 
fly bar and especially if you put it on
something<00:04:01.840> level<00:04:03.419> so<00:04:04.419> that's<00:04:04.959> what<00:04:05.859> I've<00:04:05.979> done

00:04:05.999 --> 00:04:06.009 
something level so that's what I've done

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:09.509 
something level so that's what I've done
is<00:04:06.519> fully<00:04:07.060> trimmed<00:04:07.569> it<00:04:07.930> is<00:04:08.530> far<00:04:09.069> back<00:04:09.310> in<00:04:09.489> the

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:09.519 
is fully trimmed it is far back in the

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:12.360 
is fully trimmed it is far back in the
squashes<00:04:09.970> I<00:04:10.060> can<00:04:10.239> go<00:04:10.419> and<00:04:10.829> even<00:04:11.829> with<00:04:12.009> that

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
squashes I can go and even with that

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.229 
squashes I can go and even with that
still<00:04:13.359> not<00:04:13.540> level<00:04:13.870> so<00:04:14.549> look<00:04:15.549> at<00:04:15.669> maybe<00:04:15.849> adding

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
still not level so look at maybe adding

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:17.640 
still not level so look at maybe adding
some<00:04:16.389> weight<00:04:16.570> to<00:04:16.810> the<00:04:16.930> tail<00:04:17.169> or<00:04:17.470> perhaps

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
some weight to the tail or perhaps

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.710 
some weight to the tail or perhaps
extending<00:04:18.459> the<00:04:18.579> tail<00:04:18.759> boom<00:04:18.970> a<00:04:19.030> little<00:04:19.269> bit<00:04:19.509> to

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
extending the tail boom a little bit to

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.769 
extending the tail boom a little bit to
compensate<00:04:20.529> for<00:04:20.859> that<00:04:21.419> overall<00:04:22.419> flight

00:04:22.769 --> 00:04:22.779 
compensate for that overall flight

00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:25.140 
compensate for that overall flight
characteristics<00:04:23.909> reasonably<00:04:24.909> similar

the<00:04:26.110> brushed<00:04:26.710> version<00:04:27.100> is<00:04:27.250> a<00:04:27.460> little<00:04:27.610> bit

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
the brushed version is a little bit

the brushed version is a little bit

a little bit of extra weight you feel

a little bit of extra weight you feel
