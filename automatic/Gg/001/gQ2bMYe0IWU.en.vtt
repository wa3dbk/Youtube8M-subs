just excited to bring like the best and

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:11.870 
just excited to bring like the best and
women's<00:02:09.569> football<00:02:10.380> to<00:02:10.739> Canada<00:02:11.069> I<00:02:11.280> think<00:02:11.489> it's

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
women's football to Canada I think it's

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.000 
women's football to Canada I think it's
it's<00:02:12.120> also<00:02:12.299> very<00:02:12.510> important<00:02:12.840> for<00:02:12.870> NWSL<00:02:13.560> it's<00:02:13.920> a

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
it's also very important for NWSL it's a

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.490 
it's also very important for NWSL it's a
league<00:02:14.190> that<00:02:14.459> we<00:02:14.610> all<00:02:14.730> want<00:02:14.970> to<00:02:15.120> work<00:02:15.239> and<00:02:15.569> this

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
league that we all want to work and this

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.170 
league that we all want to work and this
league<00:02:16.799> I<00:02:16.950> think<00:02:17.160> is<00:02:17.250> important<00:02:17.640> not<00:02:17.760> just<00:02:17.819> for

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
league I think is important not just for

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.300 
league I think is important not just for
the<00:02:18.299> u.s.<00:02:18.510> but<00:02:18.810> for<00:02:19.709> the<00:02:19.799> future<00:02:19.980> of<00:02:20.190> football

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
the u.s. but for the future of football

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.539 
the u.s. but for the future of football
in<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:21.030> world<00:02:21.209> for<00:02:21.569> for<00:02:21.900> women<00:02:22.170> so<00:02:22.440> I<00:02:23.220> think

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:23.549 
in the world for for women so I think

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:25.580 
in the world for for women so I think
the<00:02:24.000> more<00:02:24.209> that<00:02:24.239> we<00:02:24.450> can<00:02:24.480> showcase<00:02:24.780> the<00:02:25.260> talent

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
the more that we can showcase the talent

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.020 
the more that we can showcase the talent
that<00:02:25.709> we<00:02:25.829> have<00:02:25.860> not<00:02:26.190> just<00:02:26.340> on<00:02:26.519> the<00:02:26.640> national

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
that we have not just on the national

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.250 
that we have not just on the national
teams<00:02:27.239> there's<00:02:27.480> a<00:02:27.510> lot<00:02:27.630> of<00:02:27.720> players<00:02:27.900> here<00:02:28.110> that

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
teams there's a lot of players here that

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
teams there's a lot of players here that
are<00:02:28.380> on<00:02:28.470> the<00:02:28.530> national<00:02:28.829> team<00:02:28.980> and<00:02:29.160> our

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
are on the national team and our

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.580 
are on the national team and our
phenomenal<00:02:29.609> players<00:02:30.060> so<00:02:30.389> the<00:02:31.170> more<00:02:31.350> we<00:02:31.440> can

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
phenomenal players so the more we can

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.470

get<00:02:31.680> out<00:02:31.859> and<00:02:32.069> rally<00:02:32.549> behind<00:02:32.760> these<00:02:33.060> teams<00:02:33.329> I

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
get out and rally behind these teams I

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.270
