I'll bet you could probably hunt and
peck<00:01:23.850> it<00:01:24.000> if<00:01:24.090> you<00:01:24.210> knew<00:01:24.329> the<00:01:24.450> tune<00:01:24.600> well<00:01:24.840> not

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
peck it if you knew the tune well not

just<00:01:24.990> by<00:01:25.350> singing<00:01:25.799> so<00:01:26.159> don't<00:01:26.369> ever<00:01:26.490> be<00:01:26.670> afraid

00:01:26.779 --> 00:01:26.789 
just by singing so don't ever be afraid

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:29.359 
just by singing so don't ever be afraid
to<00:01:27.329> to<00:01:27.720> let<00:01:28.020> your<00:01:28.170> ears<00:01:28.409> guide<00:01:28.770> you<00:01:29.039> I<00:01:29.069> think

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
to to let your ears guide you I think

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:30.950 
to to let your ears guide you I think
that's<00:01:29.549> sometimes<00:01:30.030> I<00:01:30.270> think<00:01:30.329> we<00:01:30.509> get<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.659> cart

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
that's sometimes I think we get the cart

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.149 
that's sometimes I think we get the cart
before<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.259> horse<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:31.740> think<00:01:31.950> that<00:01:32.039> the

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
before the horse and think that the

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.499 
before the horse and think that the
reading<00:01:32.429> is<00:01:32.520> more<00:01:32.670> important<00:01:33.060> than<00:01:33.119> applying

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
reading is more important than applying

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.179 
reading is more important than applying
and<00:01:33.780> boy<00:01:33.869> that's<00:01:34.049> that's<00:01:34.500> just<00:01:34.710> not<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:35.009> case

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
and boy that's that's just not the case

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.069 
and boy that's that's just not the case
so<00:01:35.460> use<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.090> reading<00:01:36.420> as<00:01:36.509> a<00:01:36.539> guide<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:36.840> help

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
so use the reading as a guide to help

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:43.429 
so use the reading as a guide to help
you<00:01:37.409> get<00:01:37.560> something<00:01:37.890> underhand<00:01:41.179> Sisco<00:01:42.439> now

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
you get something underhand Sisco now

a little caveat and tell you I really
think<00:02:12.130> it's<00:02:12.280> best<00:02:12.850> when<00:02:13.180> you're<00:02:13.300> learning

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
think it's best when you're learning

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:15.840 
think it's best when you're learning
chords<00:02:13.870> to<00:02:14.260> get<00:02:14.470> chord<00:02:14.890> diagrams<00:02:15.370> in<00:02:15.550> front<00:02:15.760> of

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
chords to get chord diagrams in front of

chords to get chord diagrams in front of
you<00:02:15.940> whether<00:02:16.090> that's<00:02:16.330> in<00:02:16.420> a<00:02:16.510> book<00:02:16.750> or<00:02:16.960> an

you whether that's in a book or an
electronic<00:02:17.410> chord<00:02:17.740> finder<00:02:18.010> or<00:02:18.400> on<00:02:18.520> the<00:02:18.940> line

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
somewhere however you can find it do it

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.740 
somewhere however you can find it do it
like<00:02:21.370> guitar<00:02:21.700> players<00:02:22.000> do<00:02:22.270> you<00:02:22.420> know<00:02:22.540> how<00:02:22.630> they

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
like guitar players do you know how they

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.000 
like guitar players do you know how they
always<00:02:22.840> read<00:02:23.110> those<00:02:23.230> little<00:02:23.440> fret<00:02:23.650> charts

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
always read those little fret charts

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.380 
always read those little fret charts
when<00:02:24.160> they're<00:02:24.280> playing<00:02:24.490> chords<00:02:24.850> well<00:02:25.270> in

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
when they're playing chords well in

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.150 
when they're playing chords well in
piano<00:02:25.750> I<00:02:25.780> suggest<00:02:26.320> doing<00:02:26.530> the<00:02:26.620> exact<00:02:26.950> same

need to knuckle donar and get some of
those<00:02:31.000> things<00:02:31.270> learned<00:02:31.480> if<00:02:31.660> you<00:02:31.750> haven't

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
single tune you really can come into

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.640

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
there's a b-minor actually I added a
seventh<00:03:25.670> you<00:03:25.790> could<00:03:25.940> just<00:03:26.090> play<00:03:26.209> to<00:03:26.269> be<00:03:26.420> minor

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.330
