like<00:02:14.750> well<00:02:15.650> the<00:02:15.980> setup<00:02:16.370> is<00:02:16.490> very<00:02:16.520> similar<00:02:17.000> to

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
like well the setup is very similar to

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.390 
like well the setup is very similar to
Tetris<00:02:17.690> in<00:02:17.930> that<00:02:18.230> you<00:02:18.350> have<00:02:18.470> a<00:02:18.709> rectangular

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.720 
game board
but<00:02:20.750> unlike<00:02:21.170> Tetris<00:02:21.740> you<00:02:22.280> don't<00:02:22.459> have<00:02:22.610> to

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
but unlike Tetris you don't have to

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.150 
but unlike Tetris you don't have to
clear<00:02:23.030> all<00:02:23.209> the<00:02:23.420> pills<00:02:23.660> just<00:02:23.959> the<00:02:24.650> bugs<00:02:24.830> that

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
clear all the pills just the bugs that

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.550 
clear all the pills just the bugs that

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
are in it and how you do that is by

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.290 
are in it and how you do that is by
moving<00:02:27.740> the<00:02:27.980> pills<00:02:28.220> and<00:02:28.550> placing<00:02:29.030> them<00:02:29.150> on

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
moving the pills and placing them on

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.720 
moving the pills and placing them on
bugs<00:02:29.720> to<00:02:29.990> other<00:02:30.320> pills<00:02:30.740> and<00:02:31.040> as<00:02:31.310> soon<00:02:31.520> as<00:02:31.640> you
