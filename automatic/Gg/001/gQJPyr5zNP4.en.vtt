what I'm trying to figure out but other
than<00:00:53.070> that<00:00:53.899> my<00:00:54.899> issue<00:00:55.110> at<00:00:55.379> first<00:00:55.649> when<00:00:55.829> I<00:00:55.860> first

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
than that my issue at first when I first

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.340 
than that my issue at first when I first
put<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.370> video<00:00:56.520> up<00:00:56.670> was<00:00:57.239> it<00:00:58.050> wouldn't<00:00:58.260> start<00:01:00.350> now

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
put a video up was it wouldn't start now

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:13.810 
put a video up was it wouldn't start now
we<00:01:01.410> come<00:01:01.620> in<00:01:01.770> here<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.010> start<00:01:02.340> it<00:01:02.489> up

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:19.360 

it<00:01:14.820> starts<00:01:15.120> up<00:01:16.220> perfect<00:01:18.050> everything's<00:01:19.050> good

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:19.370 
it starts up perfect everything's good

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:26.660

right

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.550 

my<00:01:27.240> only<00:01:27.450> thing<00:01:27.600> is<00:01:27.660> when<00:01:28.020> I<00:01:28.110> let<00:01:28.260> it<00:01:28.350> go<00:01:28.440> down

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
my only thing is when I let it go down

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.480 
my only thing is when I let it go down
to<00:01:28.740> here<00:01:29.010> and<00:01:29.190> I<00:01:29.880> slam<00:01:30.270> on<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.510> throttle<00:01:31.490> it

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
to here and I slam on the throttle it

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.630 
to here and I slam on the throttle it
has<00:01:32.640> that<00:01:32.820> hesitation<00:01:33.440> if<00:01:34.440> I<00:01:34.530> just<00:01:34.710> nice<00:01:35.130> even

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
has that hesitation if I just nice even

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.910 
has that hesitation if I just nice even
it<00:01:35.760> go

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.670 

but<00:01:39.430> check<00:01:39.700> this<00:01:39.790> out<00:01:39.939> again<00:01:40.320> it's<00:01:41.320> gonna<00:01:41.409> hit

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 
but check this out again it's gonna hit

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.030 
but check this out again it's gonna hit
the<00:01:41.710> throttle<00:01:42.009> and<00:01:42.400> it's<00:01:42.729> gonna<00:01:42.820> hesitate<00:01:43.060> you

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
the throttle and it's gonna hesitate you

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.510 
the throttle and it's gonna hesitate you
see<00:01:45.040> that<00:01:46.350> that's<00:01:47.350> a<00:01:47.530> slight<00:01:47.830> hesitation<00:01:48.009> and

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
see that that's a slight hesitation and

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.280 
see that that's a slight hesitation and
when<00:01:48.610> I'm<00:01:48.729> driving<00:01:49.030> it<00:01:49.720> does<00:01:49.930> the<00:01:50.020> same<00:01:50.229> thing

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290 
when I'm driving it does the same thing

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:55.170 
when I'm driving it does the same thing
it<00:01:50.770> will<00:01:52.530> for<00:01:53.530> for<00:01:53.979> the<00:01:54.070> first<00:01:54.280> maybe<00:01:54.520> second

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
it will for for the first maybe second

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.029 
it will for for the first maybe second
and<00:01:55.270> a<00:01:55.299> half<00:01:55.330> it's<00:01:55.869> sluggish<00:01:56.560> it's<00:01:56.890> going

00:01:57.029 --> 00:01:57.039 
and a half it's sluggish it's going

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:59.310 
and a half it's sluggish it's going
cuckoo<00:01:57.369> but<00:01:58.180> then<00:01:58.299> it<00:01:58.420> kicks<00:01:58.750> in<00:01:58.960> and<00:01:59.229> then

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
cuckoo but then it kicks in and then

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.930 
cuckoo but then it kicks in and then
it's<00:01:59.500> fine<00:01:59.860> and<00:02:00.039> then<00:02:00.130> it<00:02:00.220> takes<00:02:00.399> off<00:02:00.610> and<00:02:00.850> it's

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:00.940 
it's fine and then it takes off and it's

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.210 
it's fine and then it takes off and it's
powerful<00:02:01.509> so<00:02:02.200> I'm<00:02:02.289> trying<00:02:02.560> to<00:02:02.590> figure<00:02:02.799> out<00:02:03.009> I

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
powerful so I'm trying to figure out I

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.999 
powerful so I'm trying to figure out I
was<00:02:03.520> thinking<00:02:04.000> vacuum<00:02:04.479> leak<00:02:04.689> but<00:02:05.170> I've<00:02:05.649> been

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:06.009 
was thinking vacuum leak but I've been

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:08.790 
was thinking vacuum leak but I've been
over<00:02:06.280> everything<00:02:06.789> and<00:02:07.240> then<00:02:07.450> it<00:02:07.720> it<00:02:08.649> could

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
over everything and then it it could

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.740 
over everything and then it it could
possibly<00:02:08.979> vacuum<00:02:09.729> link<00:02:09.880> i'm<00:02:10.000> not<00:02:10.149> i'm<00:02:10.479> not

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
possibly vacuum link i'm not i'm not

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.350 
possibly vacuum link i'm not i'm not
totally<00:02:11.260> ruling<00:02:11.680> that<00:02:11.800> out<00:02:11.860> and<00:02:12.580> but<00:02:13.209> that's

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
totally ruling that out and but that's

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.120 
totally ruling that out and but that's
why<00:02:13.480> i'm<00:02:13.600> gonna<00:02:14.230> be<00:02:14.350> checking<00:02:14.500> for<00:02:14.860> it<00:02:14.980> using

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
why i'm gonna be checking for it using

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.680 
why i'm gonna be checking for it using
the<00:02:15.310> car<00:02:15.489> cleaner<00:02:15.819> or<00:02:16.150> whatever<00:02:16.860> and<00:02:17.860> i<00:02:18.760> also

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
the car cleaner or whatever and i also

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.110 
the car cleaner or whatever and i also
need<00:02:19.930> to<00:02:20.019> check<00:02:20.170> my<00:02:20.350> timing<00:02:20.890> if<00:02:21.580> anybody<00:02:21.970> knows

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
need to check my timing if anybody knows

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.759 
need to check my timing if anybody knows
a<00:02:22.180> good<00:02:22.450> DIY<00:02:22.780> for<00:02:23.200> the<00:02:23.290> time<00:02:23.470> and<00:02:23.680> I've<00:02:23.739> never

a good DIY for the time and I've never
done<00:02:24.069> timing<00:02:24.430> on<00:02:24.489> this<00:02:24.640> bad<00:02:24.790> boy<00:02:24.819> I<00:02:25.000> don't<00:02:25.120> have

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:25.299 
done timing on this bad boy I don't have
