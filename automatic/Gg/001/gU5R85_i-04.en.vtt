in<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.670> middle<00:00:44.820> of<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:44.940> map<00:00:45.180> I<00:00:45.480> don't<00:00:46.110> know

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
in the middle of the map I don't know

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.299 
in the middle of the map I don't know
how<00:00:46.260> we<00:00:46.320> didn't<00:00:46.559> see<00:00:46.649> that<00:00:46.680> guy<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.219> he's

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
how we didn't see that guy and he's

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.010

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
using lightweight harden and tactical

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.100 
using lightweight harden and tactical
mask<00:00:49.200> on<00:00:49.410> an<00:00:49.500> m60<00:00:50.039> with<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.280> grip<00:00:50.989> sometimes<00:00:51.989> you

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
mask on an m60 with a grip sometimes you

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.240 
mask on an m60 with a grip sometimes you
just<00:00:52.140> have<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:52.379> shake<00:00:52.559> your<00:00:52.710> head<00:00:52.860> when<00:00:53.160> you

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
just have to shake your head when you

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.830 
just have to shake your head when you
see<00:00:53.370> classes<00:00:53.730> like<00:00:53.820> this<00:00:54.000> why<00:00:54.210> light<00:00:54.600> weight

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
see classes like this why light weight

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.619 
see classes like this why light weight
on<00:00:55.110> an<00:00:55.230> lmg<00:00:55.800> um<00:00:56.610> I<00:00:56.820> know<00:00:56.879> it<00:00:57.030> does<00:00:57.180> that's<00:00:57.390> fine

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
on an lmg um I know it does that's fine

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.080 
on an lmg um I know it does that's fine
what<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.289> hell<00:00:58.530> is<00:00:58.680> he<00:00:58.770> doing<00:00:59.070> here<00:00:59.100> he's

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
what the hell is he doing here he's

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.970 
what the hell is he doing here he's
level<00:01:00.359> 27<00:01:00.989> so<00:01:01.199> I<00:01:01.260> presume<00:01:01.530> he's<00:01:01.649> played<00:01:01.859> this

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
level 27 so I presume he's played this

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.000 
level 27 so I presume he's played this
map<00:01:02.160> before<00:01:02.370> but<00:01:03.359> obviously<00:01:04.290> has<00:01:04.530> no<00:01:04.559> idea

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
map before but obviously has no idea

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.560 
map before but obviously has no idea
what<00:01:05.159> he's<00:01:05.189> doing<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:05.640> again<00:01:05.880> just<00:01:06.030> one<00:01:06.240> is<00:01:06.450> he

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
what he's doing and again just one is he

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.429 
what he's doing and again just one is he
blind<00:01:07.020> roughly<00:01:07.799> 130<00:01:08.250> okay<00:01:08.670> um<00:01:09.020> so<00:01:10.020> anyway<00:01:10.110> yeah

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
blind roughly 130 okay um so anyway yeah

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.080 
blind roughly 130 okay um so anyway yeah
I<00:01:10.680> started<00:01:11.070> what<00:01:11.939> is<00:01:12.000> he<00:01:12.090> doing<00:01:12.380> what<00:01:13.380> is<00:01:13.650> he

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
I started what is he doing what is he

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.859 
I started what is he doing what is he
what<00:01:15.090> is<00:01:15.299> he<00:01:15.420> oh<00:01:15.689> my<00:01:15.990> god<00:01:16.200> oh<00:01:16.549> my<00:01:17.549> god<00:01:17.820> fuck<00:01:18.060> I

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
what is he oh my god oh my god fuck I

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.370 
what is he oh my god oh my god fuck I
can't<00:01:19.500> even<00:01:19.619> ok<00:01:20.720> survive<00:01:21.720> then<00:01:22.080> so<00:01:22.290> it

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
can't even ok survive then so it

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.539 
can't even ok survive then so it
couldn't<00:01:22.590> have<00:01:22.680> been<00:01:22.710> that<00:01:22.799> bad<00:01:23.040> but<00:01:23.250> you

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
couldn't have been that bad but you

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:24.620 
couldn't have been that bad but you
probably<00:01:23.759> should<00:01:23.970> have<00:01:24.030> looked<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.360> way<00:01:24.390> the

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
probably should have looked the way the

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.270 
probably should have looked the way the
bullets<00:01:24.900> are<00:01:24.960> coming<00:01:25.200> from<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.619> then<00:01:26.100> just

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
bullets are coming from and then just

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.550 
bullets are coming from and then just
walk<00:01:26.520> straight<00:01:27.180> into<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.900> direction<00:01:28.259> he<00:01:28.380> was

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
walk straight into the direction he was

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.819 
walk straight into the direction he was
getting<00:01:28.860> shot<00:01:29.159> at<00:01:29.369> not<00:01:30.329> aim<00:01:30.600> down<00:01:30.840> sight<00:01:31.200> not

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
getting shot at not aim down sight not

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.700 
getting shot at not aim down sight not
even<00:01:32.159> taking<00:01:32.640> into<00:01:32.939> like<00:01:33.659> checking<00:01:34.170> corners

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
even taking into like checking corners
