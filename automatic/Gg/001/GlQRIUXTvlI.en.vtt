and you'll have a huge advantage from

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.300 
and you'll have a huge advantage from
just<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:12.750> limiting<00:01:13.049> eliminating<00:01:13.770> at<00:01:13.890> least<00:01:14.100> one

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
just a limiting eliminating at least one

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.219 
just a limiting eliminating at least one
guy<00:01:14.490> so<00:01:15.090> using<00:01:15.390> these<00:01:15.450> flanking<00:01:15.869> rush<00:01:16.020> routes

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
guy so using these flanking rush routes

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.960 
guy so using these flanking rush routes
you'll<00:01:16.380> often<00:01:16.560> be<00:01:16.710> able<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:17.159> take<00:01:17.430> out<00:01:17.610> two<00:01:17.820> or

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
you'll often be able to take out two or

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.249 
you'll often be able to take out two or
three<00:01:18.150> guys<00:01:18.299> before<00:01:18.600> they<00:01:18.900> realize<00:01:19.229> that

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
three guys before they realize that

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.679 
three guys before they realize that
someone<00:01:19.619> is<00:01:19.710> behind<00:01:19.799> them<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.330> the<00:01:21.330> cut<00:01:21.570> off

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
someone is behind them and the cut off

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.120 
someone is behind them and the cut off
fresh<00:01:21.930> fruits<00:01:22.140> are<00:01:22.259> equally<00:01:22.560> important<00:01:23.009> if

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
fresh fruits are equally important if

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.429 
fresh fruits are equally important if
not<00:01:23.189> more<00:01:23.490> important<00:01:24.060> because<00:01:24.659> a<00:01:24.930> cut<00:01:25.320> off

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
not more important because a cut off

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.770 
not more important because a cut off
first<00:01:25.650> route<00:01:25.830> is<00:01:26.009> a<00:01:26.240> route<00:01:27.240> from<00:01:27.330> your<00:01:27.540> spawn

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
first route is a route from your spawn

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.420 
first route is a route from your spawn
to<00:01:28.020> a<00:01:28.049> certain<00:01:28.439> point<00:01:28.680> in<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:28.979> map<00:01:29.130> that<00:01:29.310> is

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
to a certain point in the map that is

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.280 
to a certain point in the map that is
extremely<00:01:29.850> important<00:01:30.299> it<00:01:30.630> could<00:01:30.869> be<00:01:30.990> a<00:01:31.020> cut

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
extremely important it could be a cut

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.020 
extremely important it could be a cut
off<00:01:31.380> route<00:01:31.619> it<00:01:31.770> could<00:01:31.979> be<00:01:32.100> a<00:01:32.130> bomb<00:01:32.369> site<00:01:32.640> it

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
off route it could be a bomb site it

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.580 
off route it could be a bomb site it
could<00:01:33.270> be<00:01:33.420> just<00:01:33.570> a<00:01:33.750> choke<00:01:33.990> point<00:01:34.020> on<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.560> map

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
could be just a choke point on the map

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.950 
could be just a choke point on the map
where<00:01:35.549> if<00:01:35.880> you<00:01:36.000> take<00:01:36.240> control<00:01:36.390> of<00:01:36.630> it<00:01:36.780> the

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
where if you take control of it the

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.780 
where if you take control of it the
enemy<00:01:37.229> team<00:01:37.380> won't<00:01:37.740> be<00:01:38.159> able<00:01:38.340> to<00:01:38.549> use<00:01:38.759> that

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
enemy team won't be able to use that

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.340 
enemy team won't be able to use that
point<00:01:39.360> anymore<00:01:39.570> they<00:01:39.810> won't<00:01:39.960> be<00:01:40.020> able<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.259> go

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
point anymore they won't be able to go

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.859 
point anymore they won't be able to go
through<00:01:40.530> it<00:01:40.680> anymore<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:42.150> cut-off<00:01:42.630> rush

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
through it anymore and a cut-off rush

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.539 
through it anymore and a cut-off rush
route<00:01:43.079> is<00:01:43.200> really<00:01:43.590> important<00:01:44.009> in<00:01:44.100> getting<00:01:44.250> map

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
route is really important in getting map

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.609 
route is really important in getting map
control<00:01:44.939> now<00:01:45.689> when<00:01:45.810> I<00:01:45.840> say<00:01:46.049> map<00:01:46.229> control<00:01:46.560> i

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
control now when I say map control i

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.590 
control now when I say map control i
don't<00:01:46.799> know<00:01:46.920> if<00:01:47.159> it's<00:01:47.460> a<00:01:47.700> commonly<00:01:48.390> known

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
don't know if it's a commonly known

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.840 
don't know if it's a commonly known
thing<00:01:48.990> in<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:49.590> respawn<00:01:50.280> game<00:01:50.490> modes<00:01:50.700> because

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
thing in and respawn game modes because

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.380 
thing in and respawn game modes because
i<00:01:51.030> think<00:01:51.180> it's<00:01:51.770> well<00:01:52.770> map<00:01:53.640> control<00:01:54.030> in<00:01:54.149> Search

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
i think it's well map control in Search

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.200 
i think it's well map control in Search
and<00:01:54.540> Destroy<00:01:54.570> is<00:01:55.340> pretty<00:01:56.340> much<00:01:56.520> as<00:01:56.759> important

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
and Destroy is pretty much as important

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.859 
and Destroy is pretty much as important
as<00:01:57.360> having<00:01:57.540> spawn<00:01:57.990> control<00:01:58.409> and<00:01:58.619> respawn<00:01:59.869> once

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
as having spawn control and respawn once

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:01.999 
as having spawn control and respawn once
you<00:02:00.960> have<00:02:00.990> spawn<00:02:01.290> control<00:02:01.619> and<00:02:01.740> respawn

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
you have spawn control and respawn

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.440 
you have spawn control and respawn
you're<00:02:02.189> able<00:02:02.430> to<00:02:02.549> take<00:02:02.729> control<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.210> enemy

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
you're able to take control the enemy

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.270 
you're able to take control the enemy
team<00:02:03.630> and<00:02:03.869> kind<00:02:04.020> of<00:02:04.079> dictate<00:02:04.530> how<00:02:04.770> they<00:02:05.009> play

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
and where they're going to be it's the

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.300 
and where they're going to be it's the
exact<00:02:07.170> same<00:02:07.200> thing<00:02:07.590> with<00:02:07.710> map<00:02:07.890> control<00:02:08.190> and

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
exact same thing with map control and

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.859 
exact same thing with map control and
search<00:02:08.459> engine<00:02:08.700> story<00:02:08.940> you<00:02:09.060> can<00:02:09.179> dictate<00:02:09.509> the

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
search engine story you can dictate the

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.479 
search engine story you can dictate the
play<00:02:10.140> once<00:02:10.590> you<00:02:10.739> have<00:02:10.890> control<00:02:11.220> of<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.310> map

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
play once you have control of the map

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.910 
play once you have control of the map
because<00:02:12.150> if<00:02:12.330> you<00:02:12.480> if<00:02:12.900> you<00:02:13.110> have<00:02:13.410> the<00:02:13.620> bomb

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
because if you if you have the bomb

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.290 
because if you if you have the bomb
site<00:02:14.069> if<00:02:14.250> you're<00:02:14.370> able<00:02:14.520> to<00:02:14.700> control<00:02:15.000> a<00:02:15.060> bomb

site if you're able to control a bomb

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.120 
site if you're able to control a bomb
site<00:02:15.540> then<00:02:16.080> they<00:02:16.110> can't<00:02:16.560> get<00:02:16.740> to<00:02:16.860> that<00:02:16.890> bomb

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
site then they can't get to that bomb

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:18.620 
site then they can't get to that bomb
site<00:02:17.340> without<00:02:17.459> killing<00:02:17.970> you<00:02:18.090> and<00:02:18.239> you'll<00:02:18.540> have

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
site without killing you and you'll have

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:19.970 
site without killing you and you'll have
a<00:02:18.690> huge<00:02:18.900> advantage<00:02:19.020> because<00:02:19.500> you're<00:02:19.770> already

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
a huge advantage because you're already

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.680 
a huge advantage because you're already
posted<00:02:20.370> up<00:02:20.489> you've<00:02:20.640> taken<00:02:20.819> control<00:02:21.120> the<00:02:21.390> area

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
posted up you've taken control the area

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.170 
posted up you've taken control the area
and<00:02:21.890> it's<00:02:22.890> just<00:02:23.040> a<00:02:23.130> huge<00:02:23.250> advantage<00:02:23.489> to<00:02:23.849> take

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
and it's just a huge advantage to take

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.120 
and it's just a huge advantage to take
map<00:02:24.390> control<00:02:24.750> and<00:02:24.959> rush<00:02:25.380> roots<00:02:25.620> is<00:02:25.739> really

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
map control and rush roots is really

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.300 
map control and rush roots is really
helpful<00:02:26.340> in<00:02:26.520> that<00:02:27.230> getting<00:02:28.230> from<00:02:28.440> your<00:02:29.010> spawn

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
helpful in that getting from your spawn

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.550 
helpful in that getting from your spawn
to<00:02:29.640> a<00:02:29.910> certain<00:02:30.300> control<00:02:30.630> point<00:02:30.840> as<00:02:30.959> quickly<00:02:31.380> as

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
to a certain control point as quickly as

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.199 
to a certain control point as quickly as
possible<00:02:31.920> before<00:02:32.430> the<00:02:32.520> enemy<00:02:32.670> team<00:02:32.880> can<00:02:33.090> get

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
possible before the enemy team can get

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.090

is<00:04:26.729> also<00:04:27.210> really<00:04:27.450> helpful

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
is also really helpful

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.180 
is also really helpful
because<00:04:28.050> when<00:04:28.590> you're<00:04:28.710> using<00:04:28.830> lightweight

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
because when you're using lightweight

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.160 
because when you're using lightweight
and<00:04:29.490> extreme<00:04:30.480> conditioning<00:04:30.840> you're<00:04:30.990> going<00:04:31.110> to

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:31.170 
and extreme conditioning you're going to

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:32.600 
and extreme conditioning you're going to
be<00:04:31.230> sprinting<00:04:31.530> a<00:04:31.650> lot<00:04:31.770> of<00:04:31.889> the<00:04:31.980> time<00:04:32.190> and<00:04:32.430> using

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
be sprinting a lot of the time and using

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.970 
be sprinting a lot of the time and using
dexterity<00:04:33.180> will<00:04:33.420> bring<00:04:33.630> that<00:04:33.780> gun<00:04:33.960> up<00:04:34.139> to<00:04:34.170> two

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:34.980 
dexterity will bring that gun up to two

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.940 
dexterity will bring that gun up to two
firing<00:04:35.720> position<00:04:36.720> a<00:04:36.840> lot<00:04:37.290> faster<00:04:37.470> than<00:04:37.800> it

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:37.950 
firing position a lot faster than it

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:41.030 
firing position a lot faster than it
would<00:04:38.250> without<00:04:38.910> dexterity<00:04:39.620> also<00:04:40.620> dexterity

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040 
would without dexterity also dexterity

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.379 
would without dexterity also dexterity
increases<00:04:41.460> your<00:04:41.550> mobility<00:04:41.850> a<00:04:42.060> little<00:04:42.300> bit

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:42.389 
increases your mobility a little bit

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:44.870 
increases your mobility a little bit
because<00:04:42.660> you'll<00:04:43.020> be<00:04:43.080> able<00:04:43.290> to<00:04:43.490> climb<00:04:44.490> and<00:04:44.760> use

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
because you'll be able to climb and use

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.190 
because you'll be able to climb and use
different<00:04:45.180> rush<00:04:45.330> routes<00:04:45.540> we're<00:04:45.690> climbing<00:04:46.110> is

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:46.200 
different rush routes we're climbing is

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.590 
different rush routes we're climbing is
involved<00:04:46.590> a<00:04:46.650> lot<00:04:46.830> quicker<00:04:47.010> and<00:04:47.419> that<00:04:48.419> that's

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:48.600 
involved a lot quicker and that that's

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.930 
involved a lot quicker and that that's
actually<00:04:48.930> why<00:04:49.260> i<00:04:49.290> use<00:04:49.650> dexterity<00:04:50.130> i<00:04:50.220> like<00:04:50.790> to

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
actually why i use dexterity i like to

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:52.670 
actually why i use dexterity i like to
be<00:04:51.270> able<00:04:51.360> to<00:04:51.510> mantle<00:04:51.870> certain<00:04:52.139> things<00:04:52.320> a<00:04:52.500> lot

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
be able to mantle certain things a lot

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.010 
be able to mantle certain things a lot
quicker<00:04:52.830> than<00:04:53.070> i<00:04:53.190> would<00:04:53.340> without<00:04:54.020> dexterity

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
quicker than i would without dexterity

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.350 
quicker than i would without dexterity
and<00:04:55.110> that<00:04:55.710> really<00:04:56.040> increases<00:04:56.430> my<00:04:56.940> options

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
and that really increases my options

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.730 
and that really increases my options
when<00:04:57.540> i'm<00:04:57.630> trying<00:04:57.810> to<00:04:57.930> do<00:04:58.050> a<00:04:58.080> rush<00:04:58.320> route<00:04:58.500> i<00:04:58.590> can

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
when i'm trying to do a rush route i can

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.680 
when i'm trying to do a rush route i can
go<00:04:58.860> a<00:04:58.889> certain<00:04:59.490> way<00:04:59.639> that<00:04:59.730> would<00:05:00.330> take<00:05:00.510> too

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
go a certain way that would take too

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.090 
go a certain way that would take too
long<00:05:00.720> if<00:05:01.050> i<00:05:01.140> had<00:05:01.290> didn't<00:05:01.530> have<00:05:01.650> dexterity<00:05:01.919> on

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:02.100 
long if i had didn't have dexterity on

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.400 
long if i had didn't have dexterity on
and<00:05:02.510> speaking<00:05:03.510> of<00:05:03.600> stuns<00:05:03.870> back<00:05:04.169> when<00:05:04.320> i<00:05:04.380> was

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.410 
and speaking of stuns back when i was

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.890 
and speaking of stuns back when i was
talking<00:05:04.740> about<00:05:04.860> tag<00:05:05.130> mask<00:05:05.400> stuns<00:05:06.180> are<00:05:06.390> a<00:05:06.419> great

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 
talking about tag mask stuns are a great

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.330 
talking about tag mask stuns are a great
idea<00:05:07.200> when<00:05:07.440> you're<00:05:07.560> trying<00:05:07.770> to<00:05:07.919> use<00:05:07.950> a<00:05:08.070> rush

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 
idea when you're trying to use a rush

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.400 
idea when you're trying to use a rush
route<00:05:08.520> because<00:05:08.880> there's<00:05:09.510> often<00:05:09.930> a<00:05:09.990> time<00:05:10.230> when

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.410 
route because there's often a time when

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:11.900 
route because there's often a time when
you've<00:05:10.530> gotta<00:05:10.680> cross<00:05:11.040> through<00:05:11.460> a<00:05:11.490> line<00:05:11.760> of

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:11.910 
you've gotta cross through a line of

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:13.790 
you've gotta cross through a line of
sight<00:05:12.150> to<00:05:12.360> get<00:05:12.600> through<00:05:12.990> to<00:05:13.169> a<00:05:13.200> different<00:05:13.680> rush

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 
sight to get through to a different rush

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.380 
sight to get through to a different rush
route<00:05:13.980> that<00:05:14.100> you<00:05:14.160> want<00:05:14.310> to<00:05:14.400> take<00:05:14.550> so<00:05:15.240> what<00:05:15.360> I

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:15.390 
route that you want to take so what I

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:16.940 
route that you want to take so what I
recommend<00:05:15.450> doing<00:05:15.930> is<00:05:16.169> running<00:05:16.380> at<00:05:16.560> least<00:05:16.740> one

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:16.950 
recommend doing is running at least one

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:19.159 
recommend doing is running at least one
stun<00:05:17.220> throwing<00:05:17.790> that<00:05:17.940> stun<00:05:18.240> over<00:05:18.720> to<00:05:18.900> a<00:05:18.930> head

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:19.169 
stun throwing that stun over to a head

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:20.300 
stun throwing that stun over to a head
glitch<00:05:19.350> or<00:05:19.440> something<00:05:19.500> like<00:05:19.860> that<00:05:19.919> where<00:05:20.160> they

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:20.310 
glitch or something like that where they

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.670 
glitch or something like that where they
expect<00:05:20.760> where<00:05:21.540> people<00:05:21.840> always<00:05:22.169> are<00:05:22.200> and

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 
expect where people always are and

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.200 
expect where people always are and
they're<00:05:22.919> trying<00:05:23.520> to<00:05:23.580> catch<00:05:23.760> you<00:05:23.970> running

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.010 
across and if you throw a stun they'll

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:27.800 
across and if you throw a stun they'll
get<00:05:26.160> disoriented<00:05:26.970> for<00:05:27.150> a<00:05:27.180> second<00:05:27.510> and<00:05:27.600> you<00:05:27.690> can

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810 
get disoriented for a second and you can

get disoriented for a second and you can
just<00:05:27.930> continue<00:05:28.200> rushing<00:05:28.710> and<00:05:28.919> it<00:05:29.220> will<00:05:29.310> be

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.180 
will be aimed outside and you can just

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:49.640 
will be aimed outside and you can just
aim<00:05:48.360> on<00:05:48.510> top<00:05:48.690> of<00:05:48.840> a<00:05:48.900> high<00:05:49.020> glitch<00:05:49.200> whenever<00:05:49.530> you

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:49.650 
aim on top of a high glitch whenever you

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:51.350 
aim on top of a high glitch whenever you
do<00:05:49.830> have<00:05:50.039> to<00:05:50.190> kind<00:05:50.520> of<00:05:50.550> approach<00:05:50.880> the<00:05:51.060> glitch

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:51.360 
do have to kind of approach the glitch

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.880 
do have to kind of approach the glitch
because<00:05:52.050> if<00:05:52.289> you're<00:05:52.410> if<00:05:52.620> you're<00:05:52.710> just

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:54.600 
sprinting at the head glitch full force

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.510 
sprinting at the head glitch full force
and<00:05:54.840> someone<00:05:55.530> pops<00:05:55.740> up<00:05:55.890> behind<00:05:56.010> it<00:05:56.250> you're

00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:58.500 
going to have to aim and shoot at the

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.230 
going to have to aim and shoot at the
exact<00:05:58.800> same<00:05:58.979> time<00:05:59.220> at<00:05:59.490> the<00:05:59.610> higley<00:05:59.850> and<00:05:59.970> a<00:06:00.120> lot

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 
exact same time at the higley and a lot

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.460 
exact same time at the higley and a lot
of<00:06:00.330> people<00:06:00.450> have<00:06:00.690> trouble<00:06:00.870> with<00:06:01.020> that<00:06:01.110> I<00:06:01.200> have

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:01.470 
of people have trouble with that I have

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:03.260 
of people have trouble with that I have
trouble<00:06:01.650> with<00:06:01.800> that<00:06:01.860> while<00:06:02.789> the<00:06:02.910> person<00:06:03.060> is

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:03.270 
trouble with that while the person is

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:04.730 
trouble with that while the person is
just<00:06:03.479> already<00:06:03.660> going<00:06:03.870> to<00:06:03.930> be<00:06:04.020> aiming<00:06:04.350> over<00:06:04.440> top

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:04.740 
just already going to be aiming over top

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:05.870 
just already going to be aiming over top
of<00:06:04.770> the<00:06:04.979> head<00:06:05.100> glitch<00:06:05.280> and<00:06:05.370> shooting<00:06:05.640> at<00:06:05.729> you

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:05.880 
of the head glitch and shooting at you

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:07.610 
of the head glitch and shooting at you
so<00:06:06.570> one<00:06:06.720> thing<00:06:06.840> I<00:06:06.930> recommend<00:06:07.050> doing<00:06:07.380> is

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:07.620 
so one thing I recommend doing is

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:09.170 
so one thing I recommend doing is
running<00:06:07.800> adjustable<00:06:08.280> stock<00:06:08.490> and<00:06:08.760> aiming<00:06:09.090> at

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:09.180 
running adjustable stock and aiming at

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:10.340 
running adjustable stock and aiming at
the<00:06:09.210> head<00:06:09.300> glitch<00:06:09.539> and<00:06:09.690> just<00:06:09.870> strafing

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:10.350 
the head glitch and just strafing

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:11.870 
the head glitch and just strafing
towards<00:06:10.830> it<00:06:10.950> if<00:06:11.100> you<00:06:11.190> do<00:06:11.310> have<00:06:11.490> to<00:06:11.610> go<00:06:11.640> that

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:11.880 
towards it if you do have to go that

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.450 
towards it if you do have to go that
direction<00:06:12.500> so<00:06:13.500> hopefully<00:06:14.070> you<00:06:14.160> guys<00:06:14.250> learned

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:14.460 
direction so hopefully you guys learned

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:16.010 
direction so hopefully you guys learned
a<00:06:14.640> little<00:06:14.760> bit<00:06:14.880> about<00:06:15.120> rush<00:06:15.390> routes<00:06:15.600> it's<00:06:15.900> a

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:16.020 
a little bit about rush routes it's a

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:18.800 
a little bit about rush routes it's a
tactic<00:06:16.350> and<00:06:16.470> search<00:06:16.650> and<00:06:16.830> destroy<00:06:16.950> where<00:06:17.810> you

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:18.810 
tactic and search and destroy where you

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:20.120 
tactic and search and destroy where you
try<00:06:19.229> and<00:06:19.350> take<00:06:19.440> control<00:06:19.560> of<00:06:19.800> the<00:06:19.950> map

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:20.130 
try and take control of the map

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:21.860 
try and take control of the map
essentially<00:06:20.850> which<00:06:20.970> is<00:06:21.090> extremely<00:06:21.510> important

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:21.870 
essentially which is extremely important

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:24.380 
essentially which is extremely important
and<00:06:21.979> search<00:06:22.979> and<00:06:23.130> destroy<00:06:23.250> in<00:06:23.669> my<00:06:23.970> books<00:06:24.210> is

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:24.390 
and search and destroy in my books is

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:27.110 
and search and destroy in my books is
50%<00:06:25.200> tactics<00:06:25.770> and<00:06:25.979> fifty<00:06:26.400> percent<00:06:26.669> gun<00:06:26.880> skills

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:27.120 
50% tactics and fifty percent gun skills

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.270

so hopefully you guys learned a little

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.100

bit<00:06:29.400> about<00:06:29.760> a<00:06:29.820> certain<00:06:30.240> tactic<00:06:30.720> that<00:06:30.840> is

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:31.110 
bit about a certain tactic that is

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:32.719 
bit about a certain tactic that is
pretty<00:06:31.410> successful<00:06:31.890> in<00:06:31.950> searching<00:06:32.250> story<00:06:32.520> and

00:06:32.719 --> 00:06:32.729 
pretty successful in searching story and

00:06:32.729 --> 00:06:35.090 
pretty successful in searching story and
that<00:06:32.760> fifty<00:06:33.360> percent<00:06:33.630> will<00:06:33.870> succeed<00:06:34.710> a<00:06:34.770> little

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:35.100
