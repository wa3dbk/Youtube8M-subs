 the prodigal son in our case the prodigal 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.219
 to my daughter this knife was with me 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.870
 most times i have this 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.930
 the knife was fold 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:23.100
 I was purchased was given to me 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:27.480
 used on 1 6 probably every time 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:30.269
 I sold it because something to me here 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.059
 it seemed to him something is missing but 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.829
 extremely time I got the perfect husband in 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.960
 General, let's not speak up 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.710
 will go about spider to enduro specifically 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:43.230
 go on version got up zippy 189 my 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:47.309
 a look is one of our best 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:50.190
 spider to and fornicator spoke 1 6 he already 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.289
 me actually last time under 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.920
 last time before this knife i got 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:59.430
 perfect what i wanted it was enduro 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.949
 With overlays from carbon she was gone 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.170
 He remained the same light that's disappeared 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.150
 that's about mine is not and linings that I 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.040
 so did not like for this particular 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:12.420
 thank you alexander ponomarenko he 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:14.130
 fulfilled my order exactly but were 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.009
 certain circumstances yes man 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.680
 I asked to sell this knife and bench 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.420
 the drug in carbon well and man is very 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.759
 good i just couldn't refuse him 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.900
 the question is not even the amount of money but just 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:30.299
 pure relation to man and not so 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.970
 long time ago tried again huge 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:36.000
 the number of knives I realized that I miss 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.220
 they dope and decided to take myself again but 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.070
 I thought how could I get out 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.020
 sold to order new lining 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.850
 alexander but it is still about half a year 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.040
 because he has a lot of orders and 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:52.409
 here on and I would have gotten wonderful 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:58.409
 the kit was written that new 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:02:01.439
 hippie culture 189 as it turned out 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.840
 subsequently the knife is not new I have already contacted 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:08.149
 with the seller said what I think about this 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:12.330
 There are traces on the clip 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:15.540
 use see worn coating and 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:18.000
 if you pay attention to 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:21.060
 before the points on how many degrees is also not 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.920
 I know before, it seems to be quite good, but how 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:28.140
 would still I wanted a new knife come 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:32.129
 already used principle like 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:36.300
 enjoyed neatly there under very 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:41.940
 also like not bad but oh well not in this 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:44.760
 what is more interesting for me 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:48.890
 It was that in the kit to this knife went 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:51.030
 Here are the aluminum lining 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.550
 aluminum lining with this 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:57.239
 polished spencer also understand 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:59.640
 from aluminum and what's most interesting is that 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:02.760
 complete right down to the relatives 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:06.840
 liners all cogs everything else 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:09.989
 all at the place of attachment under the clip and all 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:14.250
 the rest I think it will give at all 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:18.989
 small gain in weight but will give on 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:21.510
 really me that strength and lack 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:25.170
 that curse i would like 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:27.720
 get on here this endore and plus color 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:30.390
 so merry so orange not 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:33.720
 orange here I think what will happen 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:41.360
 it is more correct to do like this now 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:45.330
 weigh the culture so now 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:47.360
 weighing endure ninety two s 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:50.310
 half gram 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:53.340
 now I literally turn off for a while 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:56.880
 camera dressing knife here in these pads 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:04:00.990
 and weigh it in clips 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:05.390
 we know what the difference is 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:10.830
 the difference how much was added by weight 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:13.260
 this knife let's see this what we 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.480
 in the end you got got here 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.430
 such enduro is still polished 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.310
 Spencer understands everything you need 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:23.460
 polish the clip that i will do well 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:25.919
 there are such specific fitting moments 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:28.080
 because for example i'm used to that indra 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:31.080
 I can easily fold the blade 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:33.750
 here unfortunately there is no such need 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:37.590
 washers may be a little tinker 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:39.110
 release the axial knife otherwise 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:42.840
 like 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:46.110
 it turned out so quite interesting but for now 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.520
 still not if the order is not familiar to the very 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:50.430
 I had emily trim 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:52.680
 and enduro carrot but it is somewhat 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.710
 another well, that he is somewhat thicker than that 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.240
 was required 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:59.880
 uhvatisty pleasant interesting color 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:03.270
 aluminum just disappeared here 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:07.430
 the promises were gone which I wanted 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:10.500
 let's see what we have there with weight 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:15.270
 I think that much added but not 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:19.100
 less than 120 1 gram more than 20 grams 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:23.010
 added but in principle with carbon there 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:25.500
 emgrand 15 adding here 25 grams i 

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:27.510
 I think not fundamentally but for my money 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:30.090
 and for having the opportunity 

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:32.990
 immediately get the finished product very 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:34.610
 good option actually now 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:38.810
 need this whole thing be slightly 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:41.230
 fit well, in principle, probably all 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:47.990
 I really like it so much 

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:49.460
 This series of knives that I still with 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:55.190
 This knife bought here is so wonderful 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:59.060
 the knife is a spider to matriarch 2 by the people 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:06:01.120
 known as the egg cutter is very lucky 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:04.670
 I like the knife very much 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:06.560
 you will join my collection maniac 

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:08.530
 Something lately I have such 

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:11.300
 some extraordinary 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:13.880
 instances on my wands appear well 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:16.100
 I already had this knife too 

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:19.190
 once sold it now i'm here 

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:22.010
 returned back so here is such 

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:25.700
 interesting project i think that is all 

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:26.660
 it comes to mind yes polished where you need 

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:29.330
 all the rest 

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:30.770
 Well, actually we will see later 

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:34.540
 final option 

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:34.540
 so thank you all bye
