00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
dubbed the IC exploit and I actually had

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.799 
dubbed the IC exploit and I actually had
it<00:00:40.469> on<00:00:40.559> my<00:00:40.710> computer<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:41.340> I<00:00:42.059> didn't<00:00:42.570> release

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
person about it and I was actually just

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.680 
person about it and I was actually just
digging<00:00:47.309> through<00:00:47.550> it<00:00:47.700> it<00:00:48.000> actually<00:00:48.180> worked

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
digging through it it actually worked

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.889 
digging through it it actually worked
back<00:00:49.050> in<00:00:49.320> four<00:00:49.829> point<00:00:50.129> two<00:00:50.280> point<00:00:50.489> one<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:51.059> now

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
back in four point two point one and now

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.930 
back in four point two point one and now
I<00:00:51.930> actually<00:00:52.379> tried<00:00:52.800> it<00:00:52.829> on<00:00:53.070> four<00:00:53.579> point<00:00:53.850> three

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
I actually tried it on four point three

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.299 
I actually tried it on four point three
point<00:00:54.149> one<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.750> it<00:00:55.260> works<00:00:55.469> one<00:00:56.039> hundred

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
point one and it works one hundred

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.810 
point one and it works one hundred
percent<00:00:56.340> so<00:00:56.969> here<00:00:57.629> is<00:00:57.809> my<00:00:58.199> iphone<00:00:58.829> 4<00:00:59.280> as<00:00:59.520> you

on<00:02:49.910> four<00:02:50.210> point<00:02:50.450> three<00:02:50.510> point<00:02:50.660> one<00:02:50.930> and<00:02:51.050> it<00:02:51.260> is

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
on four point three point one and it is

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.040

is<00:02:57.200> ICU<00:02:57.620> ID<00:02:57.830> instead<00:02:58.280> of<00:02:58.370> AT&amp;T<00:02:58.730> so<00:02:59.690> I<00:03:00.050> am<00:03:00.710> indeed

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920
