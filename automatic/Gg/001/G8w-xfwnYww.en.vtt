well what does that employ imagine you

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:05.229 
well what does that employ imagine you
an<00:03:03.140> instruction<00:03:03.500> manual<00:03:03.769> and<00:03:04.580> you<00:03:05.030> want<00:03:05.180> to

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
an instruction manual and you want to

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:06.910 
an instruction manual and you want to
use<00:03:05.360> just<00:03:05.420> some<00:03:05.750> instructions<00:03:06.440> at<00:03:06.799> a

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
use just some instructions at a

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.000 
use just some instructions at a
particular<00:03:07.190> time<00:03:07.580> in<00:03:07.880> the<00:03:08.209> particular<00:03:08.480> place

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
particular time in the particular place

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.110 
particular time in the particular place
without<00:03:10.010> logging<00:03:10.280> with<00:03:10.549> the<00:03:10.610> whole<00:03:10.760> manual

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
without logging with the whole manual

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.900 
without logging with the whole manual
around<00:03:11.419> now<00:03:12.049> how<00:03:12.200> could<00:03:12.350> you<00:03:12.440> do<00:03:12.590> that<00:03:12.910> well

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
around now how could you do that well

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:15.400 
around now how could you do that well
one<00:03:14.060> way<00:03:14.209> is<00:03:14.359> to<00:03:14.389> choose<00:03:14.690> the<00:03:14.720> instruction<00:03:15.320> you

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
one way is to choose the instruction you

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.190 
one way is to choose the instruction you
need

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
need

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.360 
need
tear<00:03:18.200> it<00:03:18.290> out<00:03:18.379> use<00:03:18.890> them<00:03:19.099> discard<00:03:19.819> them<00:03:21.310> but<00:03:22.310> if

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
tear it out use them discard them but if

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.270 
tear it out use them discard them but if
this<00:03:22.489> is<00:03:22.670> DNA<00:03:23.170> the<00:03:24.170> so<00:03:24.379> can't<00:03:24.709> do<00:03:24.860> things<00:03:25.069> that

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
this is DNA the so can't do things that

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.530 
this is DNA the so can't do things that
way<00:03:26.050> because<00:03:27.050> the<00:03:27.230> DNA<00:03:27.500> will<00:03:27.620> be<00:03:27.709> damaged<00:03:28.099> and

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
way because the DNA will be damaged and

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.080 
way because the DNA will be damaged and
sooner<00:03:29.540> or<00:03:29.599> later<00:03:29.739> all<00:03:30.739> of<00:03:31.069> the<00:03:31.160> DNA<00:03:31.519> has<00:03:31.849> to<00:03:31.879> be

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
sooner or later all of the DNA has to be

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:33.910 
sooner or later all of the DNA has to be
copied<00:03:32.510> and<00:03:32.660> the<00:03:32.989> copies<00:03:33.290> passed<00:03:33.530> on<00:03:33.769> to

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
copied and the copies passed on to

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.699 
copied and the copies passed on to
future<00:03:33.950> generations<00:03:34.310> of<00:03:34.970> cells<00:03:35.590> so<00:03:36.590> that

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
future generations of cells so that

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:39.520 
future generations of cells so that
can't<00:03:36.920> be<00:03:37.010> the<00:03:37.160> way<00:03:37.280> things<00:03:37.549> happen<00:03:38.230> okay<00:03:39.260> back

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
can't be the way things happen okay back

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.130 
can't be the way things happen okay back
to<00:03:39.680> a<00:03:39.709> manual<00:03:40.480> and<00:03:41.480> now<00:03:41.720> the<00:03:41.780> way<00:03:41.930> of<00:03:42.019> doing

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
to a manual and now the way of doing

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.320 
to a manual and now the way of doing
things<00:03:42.440> is<00:03:42.650> not<00:03:42.799> to<00:03:42.980> tear<00:03:43.250> things<00:03:43.430> out<00:03:43.700> just<00:03:44.000> to

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.330 
things is not to tear things out just to

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.240 
things is not to tear things out just to
make<00:03:44.450> a<00:03:44.480> photocopy<00:03:45.019> of<00:03:45.500> just<00:03:46.129> the

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
make a photocopy of just the

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:47.500 
make a photocopy of just the
instructions<00:03:46.760> you<00:03:46.849> need<00:03:47.030> at<00:03:47.209> the<00:03:47.269> particular

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
instructions you need at the particular

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.309 
instructions you need at the particular
time<00:03:48.970> and<00:03:49.970> in<00:03:50.090> a<00:03:50.180> sense<00:03:50.480> that's<00:03:50.840> what<00:03:50.989> happens

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:51.319 
time and in a sense that's what happens

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:54.400 
time and in a sense that's what happens
in<00:03:51.470> living<00:03:51.739> cells<00:03:52.959> the<00:03:53.959> genes<00:03:54.200> that<00:03:54.290> are

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
in living cells the genes that are

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.530 
in living cells the genes that are
switched<00:03:54.680> on<00:03:55.030> those<00:03:56.030> that<00:03:56.209> are<00:03:56.269> going<00:03:56.390> to<00:03:56.450> be

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
switched on those that are going to be

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.319 
switched on those that are going to be
used<00:03:56.810> or<00:03:57.769> copied<00:03:58.430> that<00:03:58.700> is<00:03:58.849> the<00:03:59.030> information

00:03:59.319 --> 00:03:59.329 
used or copied that is the information
