00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
have our I guess a a band so you could

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.380

attach<00:01:00.629> it<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:02.270> we<00:01:03.270> also<00:01:03.420> have<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:03.660> nice<00:01:03.870> little

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
attach it to we also have a nice little

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:11.620 
attach it to we also have a nice little
hook<00:01:07.549> and<00:01:08.720> there's<00:01:09.720> actually<00:01:10.110> another<00:01:10.530> band
