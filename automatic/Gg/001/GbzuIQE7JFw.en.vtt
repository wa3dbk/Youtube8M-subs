00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.920
 other demands 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.129
 my ladies and gentlemen, there you go 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:03.210
 you will soon see a performance here 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.210
 its accountant 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.140
 the 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.119
 in progress 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.560
 everything on it 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.530
 tasted what we saw 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.530
 want to show them now 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.170
 That's the situation as you know it 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.220
 just imagine this is a ur 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.110
 crossing program 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.120
 that's what you saw on the plan 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.470
 should they expose because bohr 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.080
 something has to be done 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.310
 so far this works just like them 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.160
 see it now 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:32.400
 the driver can only in the longitudinal direction of the 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.930
 work poor and have to go back then 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.810
 dig out the crosshead 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.760
 Start here but in and of itself 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.760
 so that's fast with that efficient 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.860
 he would have to move the excavator to 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.050
 if you know the excavator 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.510
 to do it according to the rules then the priest 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:51.360
 again safely if necessary 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.260
 the construction site still against passers et 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.870
 Secure cetera 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.380
 Of course, all this costs a lot 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.380
 at the time
