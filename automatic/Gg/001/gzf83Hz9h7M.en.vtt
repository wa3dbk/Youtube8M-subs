so<00:00:03.719> what<00:00:03.870> we<00:00:04.020> have<00:00:04.230> is<00:00:04.470> the<00:00:04.650> H<00:00:04.830> Chi<00:00:05.100> or<00:00:05.520> nine

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
so what we have is the H Chi or nine

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.299 
so what we have is the H Chi or nine
robot<00:00:06.150> exhibition<00:00:06.420> in<00:00:06.840> the<00:00:06.870> workshop<00:00:07.410> we<00:00:07.710> had

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
robot exhibition in the workshop we had

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.520 
robot exhibition in the workshop we had
a<00:00:08.339> number<00:00:08.820> of<00:00:08.849> focus<00:00:09.209> areas<00:00:09.360> this<00:00:09.749> year<00:00:09.990> about

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
a number of focus areas this year about

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.320 
a number of focus areas this year about
pertaining<00:00:10.980> to<00:00:11.070> the<00:00:11.580> intersection<00:00:12.150> of

pertaining to the intersection of
robotics<00:00:12.780> and<00:00:12.900> artificial<00:00:13.230> intelligence<00:00:14.389> we

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
robotics and artificial intelligence we

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:16.790 
robotics and artificial intelligence we
tried<00:00:15.629> to<00:00:15.869> figure<00:00:16.170> out<00:00:16.290> what<00:00:16.560> are<00:00:16.680> the<00:00:16.740> things

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
tried to figure out what are the things

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.470 
tried to figure out what are the things
that<00:00:16.980> we<00:00:17.130> need<00:00:17.280> to<00:00:17.310> do<00:00:17.460> next<00:00:17.640> towards<00:00:18.150> making

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
that we need to do next towards making

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.810 
that we need to do next towards making
robots<00:00:18.990> become<00:00:19.410> effective<00:00:20.310> collaborators

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
robots become effective collaborators

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.370 
robots become effective collaborators
for<00:00:21.000> humans<00:00:21.360> pursuing<00:00:21.870> their<00:00:21.990> endeavors

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
for humans pursuing their endeavors

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.980 
for humans pursuing their endeavors
robots<00:00:23.310> have<00:00:23.520> to<00:00:23.670> be<00:00:23.790> able<00:00:23.850> to<00:00:24.300> affect<00:00:24.840> their

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
robots have to be able to affect their

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.210 
robots have to be able to affect their
environment<00:00:25.470> so<00:00:25.560> we<00:00:25.680> need<00:00:25.800> to<00:00:25.920> be<00:00:26.040> able<00:00:26.100> to
