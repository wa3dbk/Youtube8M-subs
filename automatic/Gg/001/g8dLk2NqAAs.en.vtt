these light up when I have more
resources<00:03:07.840> and<00:03:08.349> I<00:03:08.530> can<00:03:08.650> go<00:03:08.829> and<00:03:09.269> integrate

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
resources and I can go and integrate

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:29.250 
resources and I can go and integrate

pretty much going to lose almost all of
my<00:04:59.010> life<00:04:59.280> so<00:04:59.960> hopefully<00:05:00.960> I<00:05:01.290> won't<00:05:01.770> have

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:01.920 
my life so hopefully I won't have

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:03.740 
my life so hopefully I won't have
another<00:05:02.250> wave<00:05:02.520> like<00:05:02.820> that<00:05:02.880> so<00:05:03.480> that<00:05:03.630> I<00:05:03.660> can

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
another wave like that so that I can

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.570 
another wave like that so that I can
have<00:05:03.900> the<00:05:04.170> right<00:05:04.710> kind<00:05:04.920> of<00:05:05.040> protection<00:05:05.400> for

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 
have the right kind of protection for

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.600 
have the right kind of protection for
the<00:05:05.850> rest<00:05:06.060> of<00:05:06.180> the<00:05:06.330> game<00:05:07.310> so<00:05:08.310> i<00:05:08.340> think<00:05:08.430> i'm

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
the rest of the game so i think i'm

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.040 
the rest of the game so i think i'm
going<00:05:08.700> to<00:05:08.790> wait<00:05:08.970> to<00:05:09.000> throw<00:05:09.360> some<00:05:09.540> guns<00:05:09.810> out

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.050 
going to wait to throw some guns out

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:12.410 
going to wait to throw some guns out
there<00:05:10.080> because<00:05:10.500> obviously<00:05:10.800> i<00:05:11.250> need<00:05:11.670> one<00:05:12.270> of

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:12.420 
there because obviously i need one of

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:15.860 
there because obviously i need one of
the<00:05:12.600> guns<00:05:13.200> that<00:05:13.410> i<00:05:13.620> do<00:05:13.770> not<00:05:14.010> have<00:05:14.540> in<00:05:15.540> order<00:05:15.720> to

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:15.870 
the guns that i do not have in order to

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:18.950 
the guns that i do not have in order to
protect<00:05:16.020> myself<00:05:16.700> so<00:05:17.700> very<00:05:18.270> challenging<00:05:18.810> as

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 
protect myself so very challenging as

resources because I'm saving up for one

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.410 
resources because I'm saving up for one
of<00:05:45.690> those<00:05:45.840> guns<00:05:46.680> that<00:05:46.920> can<00:05:47.040> handle<00:05:47.280> items<00:05:48.180> that

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:48.420 
of those guns that can handle items that

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:52.850 
of those guns that can handle items that
fly

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:52.860 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:57.980 

go<00:05:53.860> ahead<00:05:54.009> and<00:05:54.129> throw<00:05:54.310> one<00:05:54.460> of<00:05:54.610> those<00:05:54.729> in

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:57.990 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:00.360 

hopefully<00:05:58.990> I'll<00:05:59.349> get<00:05:59.500> some<00:05:59.680> more<00:05:59.710> resources

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:00.370 
hopefully I'll get some more resources

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:01.649 
hopefully I'll get some more resources
because<00:06:00.699> I'm<00:06:00.819> probably<00:06:01.000> gonna<00:06:01.210> need<00:06:01.330> more

00:06:01.649 --> 00:06:01.659 
because I'm probably gonna need more

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:06.689 
because I'm probably gonna need more
than<00:06:01.720> one<00:06:02.050> of<00:06:02.169> those<00:06:04.860> so<00:06:05.860> at<00:06:06.009> any<00:06:06.129> time<00:06:06.430> I<00:06:06.460> can

00:06:06.689 --> 00:06:06.699 
than one of those so at any time I can

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:09.180 
than one of those so at any time I can
pause<00:06:07.060> the<00:06:07.389> game<00:06:07.419> I<00:06:07.930> can<00:06:08.319> always<00:06:08.470> resume<00:06:09.009> the

pause the game I can always resume the
game<00:06:09.220> as<00:06:09.580> you<00:06:09.789> saw<00:06:10.030> when<00:06:10.240> I<00:06:10.300> I<00:06:10.599> had<00:06:11.169> the<00:06:11.319> option

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:11.470 
game as you saw when I I had the option

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:14.790 
game as you saw when I I had the option
to<00:06:11.740> resume<00:06:12.250> this<00:06:12.849> last<00:06:13.120> time<00:06:13.389> around<00:06:13.569> and<00:06:14.080> I

could<00:06:15.129> have<00:06:15.220> started<00:06:15.460> right<00:06:15.759> back<00:06:15.970> up<00:06:16.180> where<00:06:16.210> I

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:16.360 
could have started right back up where I

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.270 
could have started right back up where I
was<00:06:16.690> even<00:06:17.050> though<00:06:17.259> i<00:06:17.289> closed<00:06:17.740> my<00:06:17.919> phone

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:18.280 
was even though i closed my phone

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:21.029 
was even though i closed my phone
without<00:06:18.460> saving<00:06:18.940> so<00:06:19.629> very<00:06:20.229> nice<00:06:20.500> that<00:06:20.860> there's

00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:21.039 
without saving so very nice that there's

00:06:21.039 --> 00:06:22.439 
without saving so very nice that there's
that<00:06:21.250> option<00:06:21.460> while<00:06:21.849> these<00:06:21.970> guys<00:06:22.180> are<00:06:22.240> moving

00:06:22.439 --> 00:06:22.449 
that option while these guys are moving

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:28.909 
that option while these guys are moving
pretty<00:06:22.750> quickly<00:06:23.190> luckily<00:06:24.190> they<00:06:24.430> die<00:06:24.610> quickly

00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:28.919 

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:31.830 

so<00:06:29.919> obviously<00:06:30.909> it's<00:06:31.120> a<00:06:31.180> game<00:06:31.360> that<00:06:31.389> takes<00:06:31.659> a

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:31.840 
so obviously it's a game that takes a

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.779 
so obviously it's a game that takes a
little<00:06:31.990> bit<00:06:32.139> of<00:06:32.199> time<00:06:32.409> to<00:06:32.590> play<00:06:32.800> so<00:06:33.219> a<00:06:33.580> little

00:06:33.779 --> 00:06:33.789 
little bit of time to play so a little

00:06:33.789 --> 00:06:35.610 
little bit of time to play so a little
bit<00:06:33.969> of<00:06:34.030> patience<00:06:34.479> but<00:06:34.629> it's<00:06:35.080> definitely<00:06:35.319> a

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:35.620 
bit of patience but it's definitely a

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:38.459 
bit of patience but it's definitely a
fun<00:06:35.889> game<00:06:36.190> and<00:06:36.490> the<00:06:37.180> storyline<00:06:37.750> changes<00:06:38.259> it<00:06:38.379> up

00:06:38.459 --> 00:06:38.469 
fun game and the storyline changes it up
