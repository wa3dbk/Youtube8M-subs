00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.190 

so<00:00:00.659> you<00:00:00.719> asked<00:00:01.260> about<00:00:01.790> how<00:00:02.790> did<00:00:03.060> I<00:00:03.240> treat<00:00:03.600> Tonya

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
so you asked about how did I treat Tonya

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.490 
so you asked about how did I treat Tonya
and<00:00:04.700> it's<00:00:05.700> hard<00:00:05.970> to<00:00:06.150> show<00:00:06.359> a<00:00:06.390> lot<00:00:06.629> on<00:00:06.839> video<00:00:07.170> but

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
and it's hard to show a lot on video but

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.799 
and it's hard to show a lot on video but
one<00:00:07.740> thing<00:00:08.069> that's<00:00:08.280> valuable<00:00:08.940> in<00:00:09.360> the

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
one thing that's valuable in the

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.959 
one thing that's valuable in the
treatment<00:00:10.080> of<00:00:10.290> anything<00:00:10.830> in<00:00:11.130> the<00:00:11.370> upper<00:00:11.730> body

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
treatment of anything in the upper body

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.860 
treatment of anything in the upper body
is<00:00:12.900> to<00:00:13.230> find<00:00:13.650> points<00:00:14.309> in<00:00:14.549> the<00:00:14.700> neck<00:00:14.940> that<00:00:15.599> need

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
is to find points in the neck that need

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.689 
is to find points in the neck that need
to<00:00:16.170> relax<00:00:16.529> without<00:00:17.400> even<00:00:18.270> a<00:00:18.710> strong<00:00:19.710> focus<00:00:20.160> on

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
to relax without even a strong focus on

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.120 
to relax without even a strong focus on
where<00:00:21.210> they<00:00:21.449> are<00:00:21.769> although<00:00:22.769> there<00:00:23.039> are

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
where they are although there are

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.070 
where they are although there are
certainly<00:00:23.430> spots<00:00:23.760> where<00:00:24.000> I<00:00:24.029> look<00:00:24.390> right<00:00:24.840> so

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
certainly spots where I look right so

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.679 
certainly spots where I look right so
this<00:00:25.920> interestingly<00:00:26.340> enough<00:00:26.789> is<00:00:27.000> called<00:00:27.300> na

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
this interestingly enough is called na

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.769 
this interestingly enough is called na
so<00:00:28.019> in<00:00:28.320> Japan<00:00:29.279> which<00:00:29.970> is<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.300> word<00:00:30.480> for

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
so in Japan which is the word for

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.049 
so in Japan which is the word for
Braille<00:00:31.140> so<00:00:31.859> it<00:00:32.009> indicates<00:00:32.460> how<00:00:32.700> much<00:00:32.880> it

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
Braille so it indicates how much it

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.110 
Braille so it indicates how much it
depends<00:00:33.420> on<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.780> sense<00:00:34.020> of<00:00:34.260> touch<00:00:34.469> and<00:00:35.120> it's

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
depends on the sense of touch and it's

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.470 
depends on the sense of touch and it's
easily<00:00:36.770> demonstrated<00:00:37.879> initially<00:00:38.879> what<00:00:39.450> I

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
easily demonstrated initially what I

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.180 
easily demonstrated initially what I
want<00:00:39.809> to<00:00:40.020> do<00:00:40.290> is<00:00:41.570> simply<00:00:42.860> induce<00:00:43.860> some

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
want to do is simply induce some

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.850 
want to do is simply induce some
relaxation<00:00:44.579> at<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.480> surface<00:00:45.989> so<00:00:46.260> I<00:00:46.289> simply

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
relaxation at the surface so I simply

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.130 
relaxation at the surface so I simply
touched<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.550> end<00:00:47.700> of<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.000> needle<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:49.110> the

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
touched the end of the needle to the

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.279 
touched the end of the needle to the
surface<00:00:49.710> of<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.070> skin<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:50.730> that<00:00:51.230> changes<00:00:52.230> the

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
surface of the skin and that changes the

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:58.400 
surface of the skin and that changes the
circulatory<00:00:53.160> pattern<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:54.320> then<00:00:56.690> once<00:00:57.690> I've

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
circulatory pattern and then once I've

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:06.350 
circulatory pattern and then once I've
done<00:00:58.739> that<00:00:58.800> I<00:00:59.340> will<00:01:00.180> look<00:01:02.180> for<00:01:04.549> in<00:01:05.549> durations

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
done that I will look for in durations

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.630 
done that I will look for in durations
will<00:01:07.110> look<00:01:07.290> first<00:01:07.560> along<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.220> collarbone

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
will look first along the collarbone

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.590 
will look first along the collarbone
near<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.790> attachment<00:01:12.420> of<00:01:12.450> the

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
near the attachment of the

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.820 
near the attachment of the
sternocleidomastoid<00:01:13.340> muscle<00:01:14.340> mm-hmm<00:01:15.030> and

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
sternocleidomastoid muscle mm-hmm and

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.830 
sternocleidomastoid muscle mm-hmm and
this<00:01:16.830> needle<00:01:17.280> is<00:01:17.430> blunt<00:01:17.820> this<00:01:18.150> is<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.390> blunt

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
this needle is blunt this is a blunt

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.140 
this needle is blunt this is a blunt
silver<00:01:19.409> needle<00:01:19.770> it<00:01:19.890> doesn't<00:01:20.310> even<00:01:20.549> go<00:01:20.880> into

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
silver needle it doesn't even go into

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.859 
silver needle it doesn't even go into
the<00:01:21.450> skin<00:01:21.840> so<00:01:22.100> I<00:01:23.100> lay<00:01:23.490> it<00:01:23.670> in<00:01:23.880> there<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.799> I

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 
the skin so I lay it in there and I

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:31.039 
the skin so I lay it in there and I
advance<00:01:27.869> it<00:01:28.490> so<00:01:29.490> that<00:01:29.700> I<00:01:29.820> can<00:01:30.090> feel<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.750> hard

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
advance it so that I can feel the hard

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.440 
advance it so that I can feel the hard
spot<00:01:33.110> feel<00:01:34.110> some<00:01:34.470> resistance<00:01:34.970> mm-hmm<00:01:35.970> I<00:01:36.060> may

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
spot feel some resistance mm-hmm I may

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.539 
spot feel some resistance mm-hmm I may
insert<00:01:36.930> with<00:01:37.229> this<00:01:37.439> technique<00:01:37.920> but<00:01:38.189> we're<00:01:38.369> not

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
insert with this technique but we're not

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.350 
insert with this technique but we're not
inserting<00:01:39.390> for<00:01:39.659> demonstration<00:01:40.500> purposes<00:01:41.360> but

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
inserting for demonstration purposes but

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.179 
inserting for demonstration purposes but
even<00:01:42.990> so<00:01:43.549> if<00:01:44.549> I<00:01:45.090> press<00:01:45.600> against<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.470> skin<00:01:46.890> at

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
even so if I press against the skin at

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.039 
even so if I press against the skin at
that<00:01:47.430> hard<00:01:47.790> spot<00:01:48.259> silver<00:01:49.259> is<00:01:49.380> very<00:01:49.549> conductive

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 
that hard spot silver is very conductive

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:54.770 
that hard spot silver is very conductive
one<00:01:52.049> can<00:01:52.320> begin<00:01:52.649> to<00:01:52.829> feel<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.159> change<00:01:53.700> one<00:01:54.600> can

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
one can begin to feel a change one can

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.690 
one can begin to feel a change one can
feel<00:01:54.990> a<00:01:55.049> stickiness<00:01:55.770> at<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.280> end<00:01:56.430> of<00:01:56.579> the

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
feel a stickiness at the end of the

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.600 
feel a stickiness at the end of the
needle<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.950> this<00:01:58.950> indicates<00:01:59.820> that<00:02:00.560> the

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
needle and this indicates that the

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.410 
needle and this indicates that the
circulation<00:02:02.610> is<00:02:02.909> changing<00:02:03.840> at<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.740> point

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
circulation is changing at the point

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.639 
circulation is changing at the point
it's<00:02:06.420> easier<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:06.930> do<00:02:07.110> with<00:02:07.290> a<00:02:07.320> little

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
it's easier to do with a little

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.080 
it's easier to do with a little
insertion<00:02:08.520> in

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
insertion in

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.170 
insertion in
with<00:02:09.810> this<00:02:10.050> pressing<00:02:10.590> needle<00:02:10.920> technique<00:02:11.180> but

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
with this pressing needle technique but

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.500 
with this pressing needle technique but
even<00:02:12.510> with<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:12.870> pressing<00:02:13.440> technique<00:02:14.870> we<00:02:15.870> can

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
even with the pressing technique we can

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:23.000 
even with the pressing technique we can
there<00:02:18.510> there<00:02:19.470> it<00:02:19.950> changes<00:02:20.840> okay<00:02:21.840> unless<00:02:22.770> you

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
there there it changes okay unless you

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.530 
there there it changes okay unless you
don't<00:02:23.190> even<00:02:23.340> look<00:02:23.550> at<00:02:23.730> all<00:02:23.910> because<00:02:24.090> you're

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
don't even look at all because you're

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.870 
don't even look at all because you're
relying<00:02:24.870> on<00:02:25.140> your<00:02:25.230> sense<00:02:25.440> of<00:02:25.560> touch<00:02:25.800> oh<00:02:26.040> yeah

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
relying on your sense of touch oh yeah

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.140 
relying on your sense of touch oh yeah
sight<00:02:27.720> is<00:02:27.989> unimportant<00:02:28.560> mm-hmm<00:02:29.220> at<00:02:29.819> this

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
sight is unimportant mm-hmm at this

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.170 
sight is unimportant mm-hmm at this
point<00:02:30.690> so<00:02:31.470> we'll<00:02:31.770> look<00:02:31.950> along<00:02:32.370> the<00:02:32.610> margin<00:02:33.090> of

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
point so we'll look along the margin of

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.270 
point so we'll look along the margin of
the<00:02:33.360> sternocleidomastoid<00:02:34.100> muscle<00:02:35.100> a<00:02:35.130> little

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
the sternocleidomastoid muscle a little

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:43.720 
the sternocleidomastoid muscle a little
further<00:02:35.670> up<00:02:38.750> just<00:02:39.750> looking<00:02:40.590> for<00:02:40.950> a<00:02:40.980> good<00:02:41.930> spot

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
further up just looking for a good spot

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.960 
further up just looking for a good spot
to<00:02:44.730> release<00:02:45.320> some<00:02:46.320> tension<00:02:46.550> so<00:02:47.550> release

I do treatment to simple supplement to

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.440 
I do treatment to simple supplement to
build<00:03:27.180> the<00:03:27.360> body<00:03:27.570> deeply<00:03:28.700> the<00:03:29.700> deep<00:03:29.970> level

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
build the body deeply the deep level

build the body deeply the deep level
what<00:03:30.660> do<00:03:31.350> I<00:03:31.410> mean<00:03:32.000> it's<00:03:33.000> I<00:03:33.390> treat<00:03:34.250> meridians

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
what do I mean it's I treat meridians

what do I mean it's I treat meridians
mm-hmm<00:03:36.090> in<00:03:36.750> Tanya's<00:03:37.350> case<00:03:37.590> I'd<00:03:37.920> treat

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
mm-hmm in Tanya's case I'd treat

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:43.569 
mm-hmm in Tanya's case I'd treat
primarily<00:03:39.560> the<00:03:40.560> kidney<00:03:41.010> Meridian

secondarily the lung meridian mm-hmm
there<00:03:47.130> we<00:03:47.250> go<00:03:47.459> see<00:03:48.359> there's<00:03:48.870> a<00:03:48.959> change<00:03:49.290> at<00:03:49.500> the

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
there we go see there's a change at the

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.920 
there we go see there's a change at the

this to just changing the circulation on
the<00:04:59.419> upper<00:04:59.780> back<00:04:59.960> it's<00:05:00.320> called<00:05:00.530> scatter

with this blunt silver needle it does

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.860 
with this blunt silver needle it does
quite<00:05:06.979> a<00:05:07.010> lot<00:05:07.130> to<00:05:07.550> change<00:05:07.880> the<00:05:08.120> circulatory

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:08.870 
quite a lot to change the circulatory

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.990 
quite a lot to change the circulatory
pattern<00:05:09.440> it's<00:05:09.650> very<00:05:10.100> effective

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000 
pattern it's very effective

little a little cold right now so

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.659 
little a little cold right now so
stimulating<00:05:24.080> the<00:05:24.200> circulation<00:05:25.039> in<00:05:25.220> this<00:05:25.370> part
