that<00:00:35.100> I<00:00:35.160> was<00:00:35.370> using<00:00:36.920> I've<00:00:37.920> seen<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.100> few<00:00:38.309> videos

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
that I was using I've seen a few videos

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.450 
that I was using I've seen a few videos
on<00:00:38.969> YouTube<00:00:39.629> and<00:00:39.840> at<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.379> end<00:00:40.500> of<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.680> day<00:00:40.890> you

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
on YouTube and at the end of the day you

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.459 
on YouTube and at the end of the day you
know<00:00:41.550> they<00:00:41.700> have<00:00:41.879> tied<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.870> wagon<00:00:43.170> as<00:00:43.290> hitch

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
know they have tied the wagon as hitch

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.670 
know they have tied the wagon as hitch
but<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.100> way<00:00:44.280> they<00:00:44.520> they've<00:00:45.149> done<00:00:45.420> it<00:00:45.629> is<00:00:46.320> very

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
but the way they they've done it is very

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.029 
but the way they they've done it is very
slow<00:00:47.039> and<00:00:47.280> it's<00:00:47.430> a<00:00:47.460> bit<00:00:47.579> fiddly<00:00:47.850> my<00:00:48.629> way<00:00:49.039> is

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
slow and it's a bit fiddly my way is

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.689 
slow and it's a bit fiddly my way is
very<00:00:50.700> quick<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.059> very<00:00:51.270> easy<00:00:52.340> and<00:00:53.340> I<00:00:53.430> suppose

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
very quick and very easy and I suppose

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.069 
very quick and very easy and I suppose
at<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:53.969> end<00:00:54.000> of<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.270> day<00:00:54.480> there's<00:00:54.750> no<00:00:54.870> right

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
at the end of the day there's no right

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.380 
at the end of the day there's no right
and<00:00:55.230> wrong<00:00:55.289> way<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:55.829> tie<00:00:56.280> one<00:00:56.610> it's<00:00:56.820> just<00:00:57.000> what

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
and wrong way to tie one it's just what

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.510 
and wrong way to tie one it's just what
you<00:00:57.510> get<00:00:57.629> used<00:00:57.840> to<00:00:58.079> doing<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:58.980> know<00:00:59.039> entertain

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
you get used to doing you know entertain

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.760 
you get used to doing you know entertain
it<00:00:59.699> yourself<00:01:00.030> anyway<00:01:00.989> I'll<00:01:01.320> just<00:01:01.440> show<00:01:01.710> you

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
to do is make a bite or a loop in the

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.260 
to do is make a bite or a loop in the
rope<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:17.100> reach<00:01:17.670> up<00:01:18.259> further<00:01:19.259> up<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.770> rope

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
rope and reach up further up the rope

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.520 
rope and reach up further up the rope
and<00:01:21.270> place<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:22.229> Bight<00:01:22.640> top<00:01:23.640> of<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.850> rope<00:01:24.530> wrap

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
and place the Bight top of the rope wrap

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.960 
and place the Bight top of the rope wrap
the<00:01:25.740> rope<00:01:25.950> around<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.759> bite<00:01:27.049> to<00:01:28.049> form<00:01:28.409> a<00:01:28.560> loop

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
the rope around the bite to form a loop

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.780 
the rope around the bite to form a loop
make<00:01:29.970> one<00:01:30.180> twist<00:01:30.540> in<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.930> loop<00:01:31.490> pull<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.520> rope

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
make one twist in the loop pull the rope

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.950 
make one twist in the loop pull the rope
through<00:01:33.229> and<00:01:34.229> that's<00:01:34.409> it<00:01:34.619> just<00:01:35.240> made<00:01:36.240> or

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
through and that's it just made or

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.929 
through and that's it just made or
wiping<00:01:37.140> this<00:01:37.320> hitch<00:01:37.560> just<00:01:37.860> go<00:01:38.670> through<00:01:38.880> it

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
wiping this hitch just go through it

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.109 
wiping this hitch just go through it
again<00:01:39.350> try<00:01:40.350> and<00:01:40.380> get<00:01:40.530> in<00:01:40.710> frame<00:01:41.490> this<00:01:41.729> time<00:01:41.970> so

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
again try and get in frame this time so

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.230 
again try and get in frame this time so
you<00:01:42.210> can<00:01:42.299> see<00:01:42.689> exactly<00:01:43.200> what's<00:01:43.560> going<00:01:43.860> on

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
you can see exactly what's going on

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:52.609 
you can see exactly what's going on
right<00:01:45.240> make<00:01:45.780> a<00:01:45.920> loop<00:01:48.079> up<00:01:49.189> the<00:01:50.189> rope<00:01:51.140> place<00:01:52.140> the

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
right make a loop up the rope place the

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.539 
right make a loop up the rope place the
loop<00:01:52.829> top<00:01:53.820> of<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.060> rope<00:01:54.860> wrap<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:56.369> rope

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
loop top of the rope wrap the rope

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.480 
loop top of the rope wrap the rope
around<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:57.509> loop<00:01:57.829> till<00:01:58.829> you<00:01:58.920> make<00:01:59.070> another

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
around the loop till you make another

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.480 
around the loop till you make another
loop<00:02:00.079> make<00:02:01.079> one<00:02:01.320> twist

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
loop make one twist

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.280 
loop make one twist
and<00:02:03.270> then<00:02:03.360> pull<00:02:04.070> the<00:02:05.070> rope<00:02:05.220> through<00:02:05.990> you<00:02:06.990> can

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
and then pull the rope through you can

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.160 
and then pull the rope through you can
see<00:02:07.470> that<00:02:07.650> they're<00:02:07.890> just<00:02:08.179> bit<00:02:09.179> here<00:02:09.420> you<00:02:09.899> feed

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
see that they're just bit here you feed

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.330 
see that they're just bit here you feed
through<00:02:10.590> and<00:02:11.630> you<00:02:12.630> put<00:02:13.620> onto<00:02:13.770> your<00:02:13.920> Hawk<00:02:14.160> of

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
through and you put onto your Hawk of

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.920 
through and you put onto your Hawk of
your<00:02:14.520> trailer<00:02:15.030> or<00:02:15.180> you<00:02:15.270> pick<00:02:15.420> up<00:02:15.600> or<00:02:15.750> whatever

pull to tighten the rope onto you load
just<00:02:22.920> show<00:02:23.069> you<00:02:23.130> that<00:02:23.220> again

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
just show you that again

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
make a loop reach up to the rope place

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:36.770 
make a loop reach up to the rope place
the<00:02:33.810> loop<00:02:34.110> on<00:02:34.530> top<00:02:34.560> of<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.010> rope<00:02:35.630> wrap<00:02:36.630> the

the loop on top of the rope wrap the

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.400 
the loop on top of the rope wrap the

pull<00:02:42.750> the<00:02:42.840> rope<00:02:42.989> through<00:02:44.540> and<00:02:45.540> that's<00:02:45.690> it<00:02:48.140> show

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
pull the rope through and that's it show

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:54.250 
pull the rope through and that's it show
you<00:02:49.880> again<00:02:50.880> in<00:02:51.230> normal<00:02:52.230> speed<00:02:52.530> take<00:02:53.220> your<00:02:53.400> loop

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
you again in normal speed take your loop

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.240 
you again in normal speed take your loop
wrap<00:02:55.260> it<00:02:55.290> around<00:02:55.500> the<00:02:55.739> loop<00:02:56.239> pull<00:02:57.239> through

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
wrap it around the loop pull through

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.130 
wrap it around the loop pull through
that's<00:02:59.250> it<00:02:59.430> this<00:02:59.850> way<00:03:00.060> I<00:03:00.090> tie<00:03:00.420> a<00:03:00.720> Wagoner's

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
that's it this way I tie a Wagoner's

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.319 
that's it this way I tie a Wagoner's
hitch
