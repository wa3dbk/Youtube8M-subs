 hello i am lennart and today review 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.260
 I a real entry model among the 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.790
 sigma bicycle computers it is one 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:17.340
 with basic functions that are easy to use 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.340
 operate it is the sigma bc 5 point 12 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:22.480
 the bc 5 point 12 is supplied with this 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.329
 manual you see here the 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.189
 bike computer and this is the sensor you 

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:29.460
 also sees the sensor magnet for this 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:29.460
 your speech 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.730
 the bc and 5 point 12 is a wired 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.329
 bike computer that means no must 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.660
 to install 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:39.580
 although toolless and the 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.500
 functions that are on it is measuring 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:44.440
 of your current speed in kilometers per 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:48.190
 hour time functions are and ride time and 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:51.220
 a clock in terms of distance and you can already 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:53.020
 traveled the distance per ride back 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.610
 and you have an old meter that is you 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.780
 the total distance traveled 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.030
 so everything you do with the device 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:01.270
 so it's an automatic start 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.770
 stop function on you can pay 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.750
 set that there are seven that 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:07.439
 the netherlands is between them and the device 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.439
 is also water resistant 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.380
 the sigma is also nice 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.090
 at the top of their manual here one 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.039
 has set dualcode 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.649
 If you scan this, you will be referred 

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:19.780
 to a website with a video 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:21.130
 state about how to get the sensor and 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.179
 bike computer must install on you 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.810
 bike 

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:27.039
 we are here on the site itself 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:32.409
 bc 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:33.909
 5 point 12 installation 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:36.249
 and here he goes so show how 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:38.380
 you in super slow motion 

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:40.959
 the installation of the device on you 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.709
 does your bike if you don't have a smartphone with the 

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:43.630
 have a hand 

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:45.340
 then you can also look it up on youtube 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.369
 and then you also see the installation 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.810
 instructions if you take the device off 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:51.039
 packaging by hand by millions of first 5 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.469
 hold for seconds to turn it off 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:54.429
 We get deep sleep mode for you 

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:56.319
 first enter your language 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:59.439
 wheel sizes you can get the right dimensions 

00:01:56.319 --> 00:02:01.869
 read on a table that is included on 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:03.939
 the manual you enter the units of measurement 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:05.740
 total distance total in week 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:06.219
 time and whether you switch the scan mode to or 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.590
 turn of 

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:10.750
 he the scan mode that ensures that 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:14.770
 the display in you every three seconds 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:16.300
 display preferred so that you change 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.010
 I get some sort of overview from 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.470
 different values ​​you can also for it 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.760
 choose to hide total values 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.460
 as soon as you start cycling so that you 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.780
 only you see your current speed 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.210
 can also be one for the device 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.070
 Order a docking station so you are with you 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:32.560
 PC interface accesses itself 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:33.670
 but data center gives more analysis 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.100
 for that you have to check out our 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.810
 accessories page and last function 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.190
 which you can set is also start 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.530
 service interval 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.480
 and that is a pre-filled distance 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.980
 and if you have achieved it then 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.520
 a message appears to display your bike 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.520
 have it inspected 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.240
 it does not measure average speed and 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:53.470
 therefore no cadence or heartbeat 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.210
 in addition, it is a wired 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.380
 bike computer so then it goes really bad 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:58.860
 what you do for a while 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.860
 must get rid of it 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.870
 the device is installed 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.760
 fortunately very easy you have there 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.710
 no tools needed and one 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.240
 advantage of a wired fish computer 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:09.550
 that you are not bothered by jammers 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:13.240
 the device is also adjustable in 7 languages 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:15.640
 including of course Dutch 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.260
 the bc is 5 and 12 is really an entry model 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.850
 so if you are looking for one 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.500
 simple bike computer 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:23.140
 which provides basic information about 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.550
 distance speed and time then this is the 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.380
 bicycle computer that you can now use 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:29.650
 pad must win and order then go 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.910
 to fietscomputerstore.nl or bj and thanks 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.360
 you do for watching and gladly to the
