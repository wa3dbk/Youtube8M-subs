chapter number nine okay which is going
to<00:00:04.560> deal<00:00:04.799> with<00:00:05.040> organisms<00:00:06.000> and<00:00:06.330> their

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
to deal with organisms and their

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.020 
to deal with organisms and their
environment<00:00:07.500> all<00:00:07.830> right<00:00:08.010> and<00:00:08.309> this<00:00:08.429> is<00:00:08.550> part<00:00:08.790> 1

so here what we are going to deal with
now<00:00:13.170> is<00:00:13.469> it<00:00:14.160> is<00:00:14.370> going<00:00:14.549> to<00:00:14.639> be<00:00:14.700> the<00:00:14.880> study<00:00:15.210> of

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
now is it is going to be the study of

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.450 
now is it is going to be the study of
organisms<00:00:16.230> in<00:00:16.529> relation<00:00:17.100> to<00:00:17.130> their

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
organisms in relation to their

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.090 
organisms in relation to their
environment<00:00:18.270> ok<00:00:18.750> so<00:00:19.289> when<00:00:19.410> you<00:00:19.500> look<00:00:19.710> around

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100
