00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:13.340
 November 16, 2014 Italy and Croatia 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:14.990
 you see the faces in a match of the 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.119
 qualification phase of the Euro Cup 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.550
 luka modric led the national team 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:21.410
 Balkan but in the 26th minute I would have 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.210
 to leave the field 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.010
 luca touches his left leg has 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.580
 suffered a puncture and it has to be 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:27.580
 replaced 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.540
 after the tests carried out at 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.310
 white midfielder was appreciated the 

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.810
 tearing of the proximal tendon 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.330
 right femoral left 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:39.489
 a road began there whose destiny was 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:42.030
 step on the lawn of santiago again 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:42.030
 bernabéu 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.210
 the first checkup was done in 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.140
 valdebebas it was important to know the 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.140
 Modric sensations 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.809
 without wasting time luka modric would start 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.589
 to walk on a treadmill steps 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.589
 slow but safe 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.560
 the rides on the tape were combined 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.910
 with the rides in the pool the 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.340
 flotation helped him perform 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:19.580
 movements with greater freedom and less 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.580
 effort 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.799
 each exercise was supervised by 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.799
 the recuperators 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.439
 that leads to running 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.850
 the Croatian walked slowly ran slowly 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.970
 and there was no need to lose detail of his 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.970
 evolution 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.580
 a wave movement of spam 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:59.249
 little by little they set the pace to 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.249
 follow last 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.550
 with that 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.890
 the sand track of valdebebas also 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.190
 would be part of this first phase of 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.190
 the recuperation 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.040
 modric and is progressing in its recovery 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.080
 and thus came to the second phase in the 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.000
 that he was going to start working with weight and 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.600
 in which we were going to discover a 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.600
 new virtue 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:30.739
 leaning alone on his left leg 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.329
 loading on it all the weight and 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:34.459
 leaving him the responsibility of 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:36.379
 Modric balance with your back to the 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.930
 basket and will give a whole demonstration 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:41.079
 and a high percentage of success in the 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.079
 threw 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:51.040
 basketball would go to boxing in front of 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.490
 a sack with quick jumps and changing 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.490
 the support foot 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.540
 the gym would be part of this stretch 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.130
 of the recovery in which madrid already 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.500
 I started doing push-ups with the 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.450
 left leg on a step or with 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.970
 a machine in which at the same time 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:10.010
 Bernardo Requena and Carlos Heredia him 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.500
 they showed their movement on a tablet 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.920
 it was important that modric and it was his 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.920
 evolution 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:25.660
 increased the load of exercises 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:29.070
 increased the difficulty of work 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.070
 modric started flying 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.989
 the exercises with weight and the gym 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:04.269
 they were still part of the day to day 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:06.659
 luka modric the Croatian was required to 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:06.659
 maximum 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:17.340
 the medicine ball 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.190
 the background exercises in the gym 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.710
 and the jumps with weights were his day to day 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.380
 but the fourth phase of recovery 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:34.900
 he took to the lawn what he likes most 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.520
 any footballer and there models started 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:39.900
 to perform races without the ball and 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.900
 rhythm change exercises 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.570
 a faster movement that I've seen in 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.570
 the field so far 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.090
 as advanced said and his best friend the 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:53.660
 ball appeared to accompany him in the 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.660
 Recovery 

00:04:56.529 --> 00:05:03.239
 it was important that his feelings to 

00:04:59.019 --> 00:05:03.239
 these heights were good hard 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.340
 the simulation of the ball 

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:09.289
 caught on ropes and racing 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.810
 pulling anchor to reach your goal 

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:14.240
 we put to the penultimate phase of the 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:17.139
 recovery the last one would take to 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.139
 out on the lawn 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:30.289
 It was February 19, 2015 and luka 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:31.669
 modric jumped for the first time to the field 

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:33.650
 of training with the rest of his 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:35.360
 colleagues with it would perform the 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:38.060
 part of the session the part 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:40.030
 physical later the Croatian would perform 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:42.310
 race apart 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:44.560
 with the passing of the days I was doing 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:46.540
 more exercises together with his classmates 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.370
 end of the road was close and 

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:51.420
 ancelotti in the preview against the schalke 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:51.420
 I made it official 

00:05:53.249 --> 00:05:58.979
 since starting the bench I think that 

00:05:55.979 --> 00:06:01.319
 will give 30 minutes the second part in 

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:03.569
 the 57th minute of the match came 

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:06.149
 moment after a long recovery 

00:06:03.569 --> 00:06:09.439
 luka modric stepped on the grass again 

00:06:06.149 --> 00:06:09.439
 of santiago bernabéu 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:19.230
 114 days he was injured on November 16 and 

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:21.840
 returns to santiago bernabéu the magic 

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:22.830
 the depth the verticality the 

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:27.689
 quality 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:30.590
 luka modric was very hard for me but 

00:06:27.689 --> 00:06:34.600
 thank god i am 

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:37.690
 back and I'm very happy 

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:40.470
 he felt very excited as first 

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:40.470
 time when he arrived here 

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:02.169
