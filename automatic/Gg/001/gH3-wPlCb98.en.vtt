00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
watch so what I drew first where my

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.590 
watch so what I drew first where my
guidelines<00:01:02.280> which<00:01:02.550> I<00:01:02.670> always<00:01:02.969> use<00:01:03.180> to<00:01:03.210> get<00:01:03.510> the

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
guidelines which I always use to get the

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.620 
guidelines which I always use to get the
proportions<00:01:03.750> right<00:01:04.880> then<00:01:05.880> inside<00:01:06.479> the

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
proportions right then inside the

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.000 
proportions right then inside the
guidelines<00:01:07.020> you're<00:01:07.170> gonna<00:01:07.260> want<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:07.590> draw<00:01:07.799> a

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
guidelines you're gonna want to draw a

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.250 
guidelines you're gonna want to draw a
kind<00:01:08.610> of<00:01:08.760> rounded<00:01:09.210> shape<00:01:09.479> up<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:09.990> top

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
kind of rounded shape up to the top

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.800 
kind of rounded shape up to the top
guideline<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:10.979> draw<00:01:11.610> an<00:01:11.790> inside<00:01:12.240> dent<00:01:12.540> and

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
guideline and draw an inside dent and

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.240 
guideline and draw an inside dent and
then<00:01:13.229> it's<00:01:13.380> symmetrical<00:01:13.799> line<00:01:13.950> on<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.159> other

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
then it's symmetrical line on the other

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.039 
then it's symmetrical line on the other
side<00:01:16.520> for<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.670> inside<00:01:17.970> rounded<00:01:18.509> line<00:01:18.720> with

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
side for the inside rounded line with

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:31.260 
side for the inside rounded line with
loads<00:01:19.380> of<00:01:19.500> creases<00:01:19.799> inside<00:01:20.310> like<00:01:21.150> this

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.130 

for<00:01:32.270> the<00:01:32.359> bottom<00:01:32.570> lip<00:01:32.719> you're<00:01:32.840> going<00:01:32.960> to<00:01:33.020> want

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
for the bottom lip you're going to want

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.230 
for the bottom lip you're going to want
to<00:01:33.200> draw<00:01:33.380> a<00:01:33.409> similar<00:01:33.890> shape<00:01:34.159> to<00:01:34.189> the<00:01:34.520> upper<00:01:35.030> lip

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
to draw a similar shape to the upper lip

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:42.310 
to draw a similar shape to the upper lip
but<00:01:35.960> a<00:01:36.020> little<00:01:36.350> flatter<00:01:40.719> you<00:01:41.719> can<00:01:41.869> change<00:01:42.140> the

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
but a little flatter you can change the

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.499 
but a little flatter you can change the
shape<00:01:42.350> and<00:01:42.860> size<00:01:42.920> of<00:01:43.490> your<00:01:43.549> lips<00:01:43.909> by<00:01:44.179> making

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
shape and size of your lips by making

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:46.029 
shape and size of your lips by making
the<00:01:44.600> distance<00:01:44.990> between<00:01:45.200> them<00:01:45.649> a<00:01:45.679> little

00:01:46.029 --> 00:01:46.039 
the distance between them a little

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:48.639 
the distance between them a little
smaller<00:01:46.369> so<00:01:46.640> you<00:01:47.030> can<00:01:47.270> kind<00:01:47.539> of<00:01:47.630> manage<00:01:47.899> what

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
smaller so you can kind of manage what

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:51.819 
smaller so you can kind of manage what
kind<00:01:48.920> of<00:01:49.039> lips<00:01:49.250> you'd<00:01:49.460> like<00:01:49.610> to<00:01:49.729> draw<00:01:50.740> for<00:01:51.740> the

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:51.829 
kind of lips you'd like to draw for the

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:54.609 
kind of lips you'd like to draw for the
bottom<00:01:52.159> draw<00:01:52.429> a<00:01:52.459> curved<00:01:52.789> line<00:01:53.110> which<00:01:54.110> kind<00:01:54.500> of

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
bottom draw a curved line which kind of

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:59.889 
bottom draw a curved line which kind of
flattens<00:01:55.069> out<00:01:55.250> at<00:01:55.399> the<00:01:55.520> bottom<00:01:55.819> like<00:01:56.000> this<00:01:58.899> for

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
flattens out at the bottom like this for

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:01.179 
flattens out at the bottom like this for
the<00:01:59.990> light<00:02:00.170> reflections<00:02:00.740> draw<00:02:01.009> a<00:02:01.039> random

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:01.189 
the light reflections draw a random

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:02.979 
the light reflections draw a random
little<00:02:01.729> shapes<00:02:02.060> on<00:02:02.360> the<00:02:02.479> middle<00:02:02.780> of<00:02:02.869> the

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:02.989

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.770 

for<00:02:18.980> the<00:02:19.160> base<00:02:19.370> color<00:02:19.730> I<00:02:19.970> chose<00:02:20.209> a<00:02:20.270> pinkish

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
for the base color I chose a pinkish

skin<00:02:21.170> tone<00:02:21.440> and<00:02:21.709> I<00:02:22.160> just<00:02:22.400> went<00:02:22.640> ahead<00:02:22.760> and<00:02:23.150> I

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269 
skin tone and I just went ahead and I

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:36.900

during<00:02:37.910> coloring<00:02:38.420> in<00:02:38.600> it's<00:02:38.870> easier<00:02:39.230> if<00:02:39.350> you

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
during coloring in it's easier if you

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.700 
during coloring in it's easier if you
make<00:02:39.770> vertical<00:02:40.220> slightly<00:02:41.210> curved<00:02:41.510> lines<00:02:41.930> to

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:42.710 
make vertical slightly curved lines to

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:44.740 
make vertical slightly curved lines to
already<00:02:43.250> draw<00:02:43.700> in<00:02:43.910> the<00:02:44.060> creases<00:02:44.330> that<00:02:44.510> you're
