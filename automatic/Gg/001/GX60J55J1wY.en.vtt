particular<00:00:13.080> this<00:00:13.650> time<00:00:14.009> we'll<00:00:14.219> be<00:00:14.400> looking<00:00:14.429> at

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
particular this time we'll be looking at

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.820 
particular this time we'll be looking at
the<00:00:14.849> sony<00:00:15.089> 877<00:00:16.049> but<00:00:16.170> it<00:00:16.260> should<00:00:16.440> be<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:16.619> same

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
the sony 877 but it should be the same

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.310 
the sony 877 but it should be the same
across<00:00:17.039> all<00:00:17.460> of<00:00:17.670> them<00:00:17.850> it's<00:00:18.359> pretty<00:00:18.750> easy<00:00:19.020> to

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
across all of them it's pretty easy to

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.260 
across all of them it's pretty easy to
do<00:00:19.650> you<00:00:20.039> just<00:00:20.070> need<00:00:20.369> to<00:00:20.460> get<00:00:20.550> a<00:00:20.609> file<00:00:20.939> and<00:00:21.119> put

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
do you just need to get a file and put

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.060 
do you just need to get a file and put
it<00:00:21.330> in<00:00:21.449> a<00:00:21.510> specific<00:00:21.720> folder<00:00:22.230> on<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.619> memory

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
it in a specific folder on the memory

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.730 
it in a specific folder on the memory
card<00:00:23.430> and<00:00:23.609> what<00:00:24.119> this<00:00:24.240> GPS<00:00:24.750> assist<00:00:25.140> file<00:00:25.439> does

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
card and what this GPS assist file does

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.250 
card and what this GPS assist file does
is<00:00:26.010> it<00:00:26.220> allows<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:27.060> camera<00:00:27.269> to<00:00:27.420> predict<00:00:28.019> where

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
is it allows the camera to predict where

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.779 
is it allows the camera to predict where
the<00:00:28.380> satellites<00:00:28.859> will<00:00:29.099> be<00:00:29.220> at<00:00:29.369> any<00:00:29.460> given

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
the satellites will be at any given

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.299 
the satellites will be at any given
point<00:00:30.000> in<00:00:30.210> time<00:00:30.420> in<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:30.900> next<00:00:31.170> thirty<00:00:31.439> days<00:00:31.529> it

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
point in time in the next thirty days it

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.549 
point in time in the next thirty days it
allows<00:00:32.550> it<00:00:32.730> to<00:00:32.759> get<00:00:32.969> a<00:00:33.030> quicker<00:00:33.660> lock<00:00:34.050> onto<00:00:34.350> the

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
allows it to get a quicker lock onto the

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:35.690 
allows it to get a quicker lock onto the
satellite<00:00:35.040> so<00:00:35.160> you<00:00:35.250> have<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.460> sit<00:00:35.610> around

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
satellite so you have to sit around

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.030 
satellite so you have to sit around
waiting<00:00:35.940> for<00:00:36.300> it<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:36.480> acquire<00:00:36.840> its<00:00:37.500> lock<00:00:37.800> for

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
waiting for it to acquire its lock for

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.400 
waiting for it to acquire its lock for
as<00:00:38.190> long<00:00:38.430> so<00:00:39.270> let's<00:00:39.480> look<00:00:39.629> in<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.840> scenes<00:00:40.110> and

let's go to the computer and see what

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.190 
let's go to the computer and see what
the<00:01:29.250> next<00:01:29.460> step<00:01:29.640> is<00:01:29.850> so<00:01:30.689> now<00:01:30.869> we're<00:01:31.049> on<00:01:31.170> our

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
the next step is so now we're on our

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.690 
the next step is so now we're on our
camera<00:01:31.680> and<00:01:31.829> we<00:01:31.890> know<00:01:32.040> we<00:01:32.130> need<00:01:32.159> to<00:01:32.340> update<00:01:32.520> our
