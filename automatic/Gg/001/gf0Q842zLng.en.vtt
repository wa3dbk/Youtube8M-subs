indents<00:01:53.790> there<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.299> then<00:01:54.600> you're<00:01:54.720> ready<00:01:54.840> to

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
indents there and then you're ready to

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.990 
indents there and then you're ready to
go<00:01:54.990> so<00:01:58.280> where<00:01:59.280> does<00:01:59.340> that<00:01:59.490> piece<00:01:59.640> of<00:01:59.759> wood<00:01:59.909> in

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
go so where does that piece of wood in

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.330 
go so where does that piece of wood in
there

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.350 

eventually<00:02:05.340> you'll<00:02:05.640> get<00:02:05.760> to<00:02:05.820> a<00:02:05.940> point<00:02:06.000> where

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
eventually you'll get to a point where

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.210 
eventually you'll get to a point where
you<00:02:06.450> won't<00:02:06.600> need<00:02:06.720> the<00:02:06.840> wood<00:02:07.050> and<00:02:07.290> you<00:02:08.070> can

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
you won't need the wood and you can

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:14.960 
you won't need the wood and you can
probably<00:02:08.399> hold<00:02:08.700> it<00:02:08.790> back<00:02:08.940> by<00:02:09.810> hand<00:02:10.080> then<00:02:13.970> take

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
probably hold it back by hand then take

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.020 
probably hold it back by hand then take
it<00:02:15.120> the<00:02:15.210> rest<00:02:15.390> of<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:15.540> way<00:02:15.630> off<00:02:16.460> this<00:02:17.460> nut<00:02:17.730> is<00:02:17.970> a

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
it the rest of the way off this nut is a

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.510 
it the rest of the way off this nut is a
locking<00:02:18.540> nut<00:02:18.930> which<00:02:19.710> means<00:02:19.920> it<00:02:20.040> has<00:02:20.160> a<00:02:20.190> plastic

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
locking nut which means it has a plastic

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.910 
locking nut which means it has a plastic
insert<00:02:21.030> in<00:02:21.210> it<00:02:21.330> so<00:02:21.930> the<00:02:22.110> nut<00:02:22.260> itself<00:02:22.590> should

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
insert in it so the nut itself should

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:23.900 
insert in it so the nut itself should
never<00:02:23.130> back<00:02:23.370> off

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
never back off

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.590 
never back off
but<00:02:24.510> again<00:02:24.750> the<00:02:24.950> locking<00:02:25.950> rings<00:02:26.160> are<00:02:26.370> an<00:02:27.300> extra

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
but again the locking rings are an extra

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:44.309 
but again the locking rings are an extra
precaution

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:47.920 

okay<00:02:45.319> so<00:02:45.530> you<00:02:45.590> got<00:02:45.740> the<00:02:45.830> nut<00:02:46.569> now<00:02:47.569> here's<00:02:47.780> where

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
okay so you got the nut now here's where

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.660 
okay so you got the nut now here's where
you<00:02:48.050> want<00:02:48.200> to<00:02:48.260> pay<00:02:48.350> attention<00:02:48.550> whatever<00:02:49.550> you

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
you want to pay attention whatever you

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.210 
you want to pay attention whatever you
take<00:02:49.850> off<00:02:50.170> take<00:02:51.170> note<00:02:51.410> to<00:02:51.590> the<00:02:51.680> order<00:02:52.010> make

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
take off take note to the order make

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.350 
take off take note to the order make
sure<00:02:52.340> you<00:02:52.430> put<00:02:52.550> it<00:02:52.640> back<00:02:52.730> on<00:02:52.940> in<00:02:53.150> the<00:02:53.180> same

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
sure you put it back on in the same

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.980 
sure you put it back on in the same
order<00:02:54.310> this<00:02:55.310> will<00:02:55.520> come<00:02:55.670> right<00:02:55.819> off<00:02:55.990> and

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:56.990 
order this will come right off and

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:00.670 
order this will come right off and
you're<00:02:57.260> going<00:02:57.380> to<00:02:57.410> pull<00:02:57.980> the<00:02:58.069> proper<00:02:58.370> off<00:02:59.680> now

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
you're going to pull the proper off now

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.470 
you're going to pull the proper off now
there's<00:03:01.370> a<00:03:01.459> piece<00:03:01.640> inside<00:03:01.970> here<00:03:02.239> and

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
there's a piece inside here and

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.550 
there's a piece inside here and
sometimes<00:03:05.480> this<00:03:05.780> comes<00:03:05.959> out<00:03:06.080> easier<00:03:06.410> than

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
sometimes this comes out easier than

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:13.720 
sometimes this comes out easier than
others<00:03:09.670> as<00:03:10.670> a<00:03:10.970> prop<00:03:11.420> gets<00:03:11.660> used<00:03:11.989> it'll<00:03:12.260> come<00:03:12.730> in

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
others as a prop gets used it'll come in

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.940 
others as a prop gets used it'll come in
and<00:03:13.910> out<00:03:13.970> a<00:03:14.000> lot<00:03:14.180> a<00:03:14.390> lot<00:03:14.540> easier<00:03:14.870> and<00:03:15.620> this<00:03:15.769> is

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
and out a lot a lot easier and this is

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.060 
and out a lot a lot easier and this is
the<00:03:16.130> piece<00:03:16.280> that<00:03:16.430> actually<00:03:16.580> mates<00:03:17.590> to<00:03:18.590> the<00:03:18.620> to

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
the piece that actually mates to the to

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.780 
the piece that actually mates to the to
the<00:03:19.190> shaft<00:03:19.430> so<00:03:20.239> inside<00:03:20.720> this<00:03:20.870> prop<00:03:21.230> is<00:03:21.610> the<00:03:22.610> hub

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
the shaft so inside this prop is the hub

and sort of plastic black rubber type

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.280 
and sort of plastic black rubber type
material<00:03:26.209> I'm<00:03:26.300> going<00:03:26.420> to<00:03:26.800> pop<00:03:27.800> it<00:03:27.920> out

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
sometimes this piece right here will

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.030 
sometimes this piece right here will
come<00:03:32.030> out<00:03:32.120> by<00:03:32.300> itself<00:03:32.540> as<00:03:32.780> well<00:03:32.930> in<00:03:33.500> case<00:03:33.560> it

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
come out by itself as well in case it

seat down below this rim here and as you
tighten<00:03:46.400> the<00:03:46.550> prop<00:03:46.819> it'll<00:03:47.540> pull<00:03:47.720> it<00:03:47.810> down<00:03:47.959> a

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
tighten the prop it'll pull it down a

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:49.210 
tighten the prop it'll pull it down a
little<00:03:48.470> tighter<00:03:48.680> as<00:03:48.829> well

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
little tighter as well

little tighter as well
the<00:03:49.820> next<00:03:50.120> thing<00:03:50.269> here<00:03:50.480> is<00:03:50.660> this<00:03:51.620> thrust

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
the next thing here is this thrust

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.009 
the next thing here is this thrust
spacer<00:03:53.810> the<00:03:54.140> stress<00:03:54.380> washer<00:03:54.769> and<00:03:55.000> this<00:03:56.019> can

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:57.019 
spacer the stress washer and this can

00:03:57.019 --> 00:03:58.750 
spacer the stress washer and this can
only<00:03:57.170> go<00:03:57.260> on<00:03:57.380> one<00:03:57.739> way<00:03:57.769> or<00:03:58.100> should<00:03:58.370> only<00:03:58.549> go<00:03:58.730> on

on the right way make sure everything
gets<00:04:26.450> greased<00:04:26.810> up<00:04:26.990> and<00:04:27.640> then<00:04:28.640> just<00:04:28.789> do<00:04:29.090> the

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
gets greased up and then just do the

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:30.330 
gets greased up and then just do the
reverse<00:04:29.450> of<00:04:29.600> what<00:04:29.660> you<00:04:29.870> did

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
reverse of what you did

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:35.320 
reverse of what you did
to<00:04:31.340> take<00:04:31.520> it<00:04:31.610> off<00:04:33.010> you<00:04:34.010> can<00:04:34.039> do<00:04:34.400> the<00:04:34.850> prop<00:04:35.060> first

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
to take it off you can do the prop first

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.350 
to take it off you can do the prop first
and<00:04:35.510> then<00:04:35.600> line<00:04:35.810> this<00:04:35.960> up<00:04:37.000> it's<00:04:38.000> going<00:04:38.120> to<00:04:38.180> line

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
and then line this up it's going to line

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.560 
and then line this up it's going to line
up<00:04:38.510> with<00:04:38.660> these<00:04:38.750> little<00:04:39.050> notches<00:04:40.039> in<00:04:40.490> there<00:04:41.210> or

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
up with these little notches in there or

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:45.070 
up with these little notches in there or
you<00:04:41.960> can<00:04:42.080> put<00:04:42.289> this<00:04:42.440> in<00:04:42.650> ahead<00:04:43.039> of<00:04:43.100> time<00:04:44.080> again
