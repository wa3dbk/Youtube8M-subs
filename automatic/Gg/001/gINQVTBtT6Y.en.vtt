back<00:02:40.830> of<00:02:40.980> the<00:02:41.040> bowl<00:02:41.220> so<00:02:41.490> we<00:02:41.970> can<00:02:42.120> get<00:02:42.270> good

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
back of the bowl so we can get good

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.180 
back of the bowl so we can get good
position<00:02:43.050> and<00:02:43.350> we<00:02:43.440> know<00:02:43.560> exactly<00:02:43.860> where<00:02:44.130> to

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
position and we know exactly where to

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:57.100 
position and we know exactly where to
place<00:02:45.320> the<00:02:46.320> assembled<00:02:46.740> unit

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:58.870 

it's<00:02:57.230> all<00:02:57.350> away<00:02:57.560> on<00:02:57.590> one<00:02:58.400> wonderful<00:02:58.850> thing

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
it's all away on one wonderful thing

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.790 
it's all away on one wonderful thing
about<00:02:59.150> a<00:02:59.270> flexible<00:02:59.780> joint<00:02:59.990> between<00:03:00.200> the<00:03:00.590> bowl

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 
about a flexible joint between the bowl

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.590 
about a flexible joint between the bowl
and<00:03:01.100> the<00:03:01.160> macerator<00:03:01.640> is<00:03:01.820> that<00:03:02.270> if<00:03:02.330> you<00:03:02.420> change

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
and the macerator is that if you change

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.510 
and the macerator is that if you change
the<00:03:02.690> floor<00:03:02.960> covering<00:03:03.290> like<00:03:03.440> adding<00:03:03.740> tiles<00:03:04.100> you

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:04.520 
the floor covering like adding tiles you

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:05.950 
the floor covering like adding tiles you
can<00:03:04.550> lift<00:03:04.910> up<00:03:05.090> half<00:03:05.300> an<00:03:05.450> inch<00:03:05.570> or<00:03:05.720> even<00:03:05.780> a

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:05.960 
can lift up half an inch or even a

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.300 
can lift up half an inch or even a
little<00:03:06.140> bit<00:03:06.230> more<00:03:06.410> and<00:03:06.590> it<00:03:06.710> makes<00:03:06.890> no

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
little bit more and it makes no

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.750 
little bit more and it makes no
difference<00:03:07.340> in<00:03:07.820> the<00:03:07.910> plumbing<00:03:09.580> well<00:03:10.580> if

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
difference in the plumbing well if

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.580 
difference in the plumbing well if
you're<00:03:10.910> really<00:03:11.210> nervous<00:03:11.360> about<00:03:11.660> plumbing<00:03:12.170> the

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
you're really nervous about plumbing the

you're really nervous about plumbing the
rest<00:03:12.800> of<00:03:12.980> that<00:03:13.070> was<00:03:13.190> pretty<00:03:13.400> easy<00:03:13.580> to<00:03:13.760> do

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
rest of that was pretty easy to do

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.250 
rest of that was pretty easy to do
yourself<00:03:14.240> the<00:03:14.270> carpentry<00:03:14.870> the<00:03:14.960> plumbing

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
yourself the carpentry the plumbing

tying<00:03:16.730> into<00:03:16.970> the<00:03:17.060> house<00:03:17.150> you<00:03:17.180> may<00:03:17.570> want<00:03:17.930> to<00:03:17.990> get

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 
tying into the house you may want to get

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.320 
tying into the house you may want to get
a<00:03:18.140> professional<00:03:18.680> like<00:03:18.830> Mike<00:03:19.100> involve<00:03:19.520> Mike

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
a professional like Mike involve Mike

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.060 
a professional like Mike involve Mike
what<00:03:20.600> is<00:03:20.780> critical<00:03:20.990> about<00:03:21.350> the<00:03:21.500> tie<00:03:21.680> in<00:03:21.860> to<00:03:22.040> the

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.070 
what is critical about the tie in to the

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:24.550 
what is critical about the tie in to the
sewage<00:03:22.430> line<00:03:22.959> really<00:03:23.959> there's<00:03:24.140> three<00:03:24.380> things

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
sewage line really there's three things

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.680 
sewage line really there's three things
that<00:03:24.770> are<00:03:24.890> important<00:03:25.459> first<00:03:26.030> making<00:03:26.330> sure<00:03:26.600> you

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
that are important first making sure you

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.600 
that are important first making sure you
use<00:03:26.840> a<00:03:26.870> why<00:03:27.170> instead<00:03:27.740> of<00:03:27.830> a<00:03:27.920> t-connector

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
use a why instead of a t-connector

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:30.580 
use a why instead of a t-connector
because<00:03:29.090> at<00:03:29.240> T<00:03:29.450> the<00:03:29.930> the<00:03:30.200> pressure<00:03:30.410> would

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
because at T the the pressure would

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.440 
because at T the the pressure would
bounce<00:03:30.950> right<00:03:31.250> into<00:03:31.670> the<00:03:31.790> joint<00:03:32.000> and<00:03:32.120> a<00:03:32.240> wife

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
bounce right into the joint and a wife

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.100 
bounce right into the joint and a wife
flows<00:03:32.930> along<00:03:33.230> the<00:03:33.290> line<00:03:33.500> exactly<00:03:33.920> okay<00:03:35.110> the

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110 
flows along the line exactly okay the

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:37.660 
flows along the line exactly okay the
other<00:03:36.140> thing<00:03:36.320> is<00:03:36.709> making<00:03:36.950> sure<00:03:37.100> that<00:03:37.250> you<00:03:37.520> do

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
other thing is making sure that you do

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:39.490 
other thing is making sure that you do
your<00:03:37.700> tie<00:03:38.000> in<00:03:38.060> as<00:03:38.330> close<00:03:38.600> as<00:03:38.780> possible<00:03:38.810> to<00:03:39.290> the

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
your tie in as close as possible to the

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.530 
your tie in as close as possible to the
main<00:03:39.739> source<00:03:40.070> tank<00:03:40.340> that's<00:03:40.820> coming<00:03:41.150> all<00:03:41.360> the

main source tank that's coming all the

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.660 
main source tank that's coming all the

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
way from the pump unit right over here

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.130 
way from the pump unit right over here
alright<00:03:44.060> that's<00:03:44.239> easy<00:03:44.420> right<00:03:44.540> across<00:03:44.900> the

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
alright that's easy right across the

going on to the event system right
exactly<00:03:49.880> that's<00:03:50.150> the<00:03:50.480> sewer<00:03:50.980> exhaust<00:03:51.980> or<00:03:52.190> the

exactly that's the sewer exhaust or the
venting<00:03:52.730> which<00:03:53.239> will<00:03:53.480> be<00:03:53.600> tied<00:03:53.840> into<00:03:54.050> the<00:03:54.410> main
