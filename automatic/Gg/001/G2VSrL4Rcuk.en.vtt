almost empty term that you really I mean

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:20.390 
I know that it's real and some people

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.099 
I know that it's real and some people
are<00:00:20.509> better<00:00:20.930> leaders<00:00:21.410> than<00:00:21.680> others<00:00:22.160> but

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:23.109 
are better leaders than others but

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:31.390 
are better leaders than others but
leadership<00:00:24.109> is<00:00:24.880> about<00:00:29.410> doing<00:00:30.410> what<00:00:30.800> can<00:00:31.130> be

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:31.400 
leadership is about doing what can be

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.360 
leadership is about doing what can be
done<00:00:31.670> in<00:00:32.290> local<00:00:33.290> situations

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:34.370 
done in local situations

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.049 
done in local situations
I<00:00:34.550> don't<00:00:35.410> ascribe<00:00:36.410> to<00:00:36.559> the<00:00:36.980> born<00:00:37.250> leader<00:00:37.550> myth

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:38.059

I don't ascribe to the born leader myth
at<00:00:38.360> all<00:00:39.040> I<00:00:40.040> think<00:00:40.820> it's<00:00:41.000> what<00:00:41.300> people<00:00:42.230> tell

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:42.860 
at all I think it's what people tell

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.530 
at all I think it's what people tell
themselves<00:00:44.559> to<00:00:45.559> make<00:00:45.710> them<00:00:45.860> feel<00:00:46.210> cells<00:00:47.210> feel

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:47.540 
themselves to make them feel cells feel

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.569 
themselves to make them feel cells feel
better<00:00:47.989> by<00:00:48.260> the<00:00:48.320> challenges<00:00:48.980> or<00:00:49.129> risk<00:00:49.370> that

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579 
better by the challenges or risk that

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:52.299 
better by the challenges or risk that
didn't<00:00:49.879> take<00:00:50.059> maybe<00:00:50.390> I<00:00:50.510> don't<00:00:50.870> know<00:00:50.960> I<00:00:50.989> I<00:00:51.440> think

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
didn't take maybe I don't know I I think

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:57.040 
didn't take maybe I don't know I I think
that<00:00:53.649> you<00:00:54.649> can<00:00:54.890> be<00:00:55.010> a<00:00:55.039> leader<00:00:55.309> with<00:00:55.850> a<00:00:56.390> whole

range of personality styles

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:06.180 
range of personality styles
I<00:00:59.180> do<00:01:00.140> think<00:01:01.360> knowledge<00:01:03.729> curiosity<00:01:04.930> openness

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:06.190 
I do think knowledge curiosity openness

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:11.170 
I do think knowledge curiosity openness
and<00:01:07.899> the<00:01:08.899> ability<00:01:09.350> to<00:01:09.380> see<00:01:10.180> situated

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
and the ability to see situated

for<00:01:19.030> becoming<00:01:20.030> a<00:01:20.270> leader<00:01:20.510> I<00:01:20.900> don't<00:01:21.320> think<00:01:21.500> it

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
for becoming a leader I don't think it

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.760 
for becoming a leader I don't think it
it<00:01:21.920> is<00:01:22.159> located<00:01:22.670> in<00:01:23.030> just<00:01:24.020> personality<00:01:24.740> I

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
it is located in just personality I

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.249 
it is located in just personality I
think<00:01:24.950> it's<00:01:25.430> that<00:01:26.360> you<00:01:26.420> have<00:01:26.720> to<00:01:26.750> have<00:01:26.990> real

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
think it's that you have to have real

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:29.560 
think it's that you have to have real
substance<00:01:27.560> and<00:01:28.189> you<00:01:28.520> have<00:01:28.670> to<00:01:28.790> really<00:01:29.150> deeply

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
substance and you have to really deeply

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.410 
substance and you have to really deeply
understand<00:01:30.200> the<00:01:30.290> field<00:01:30.710> and<00:01:31.009> you<00:01:32.000> have<00:01:32.240> to

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
understand the field and you have to

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.160 
understand the field and you have to
have<00:01:32.659> a<00:01:32.960> vision<00:01:33.380> for<00:01:33.590> what<00:01:33.860> is<00:01:34.340> possible<00:01:35.210> you

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
have a vision for what is possible you

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.230 
have a vision for what is possible you
develop<00:01:36.680> a<00:01:36.770> kind<00:01:36.950> of<00:01:37.159> wisdom<00:01:37.670> from<00:01:40.240> working

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
develop a kind of wisdom from working

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.590 
develop a kind of wisdom from working
within<00:01:41.900> a<00:01:42.110> field<00:01:42.409> from<00:01:43.400> learning<00:01:43.970> a<00:01:44.060> practice

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
within a field from learning a practice

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.850 
within a field from learning a practice
deeply<00:01:45.140> and<00:01:45.409> I<00:01:46.400> think<00:01:47.060> that<00:01:47.420> can<00:01:48.170> make<00:01:48.650> you<00:01:48.829> a

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
deeply and I think that can make you a

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.310 
deeply and I think that can make you a
leader<00:01:49.100> and<00:01:49.369> I<00:01:49.579> think<00:01:49.820> there<00:01:49.970> are<00:01:50.000> many

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
leader and I think there are many

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.719 
leader and I think there are many
sometimes<00:01:51.320> we<00:01:51.500> think<00:01:51.740> of<00:01:51.890> leaders<00:01:52.280> is<00:01:52.490> only

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
sometimes we think of leaders is only

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:57.569 
sometimes we think of leaders is only
positional<00:01:53.509> leaders<00:01:54.549> I<00:01:55.810> don't<00:01:56.810> think<00:01:57.020> I'm<00:01:57.259> a

00:01:57.569 --> 00:01:57.579 
positional leaders I don't think I'm a

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:00.310 
positional leaders I don't think I'm a
positional<00:01:58.579> leader<00:01:59.149> I<00:01:59.270> think<00:01:59.420> I'm<00:01:59.780> an

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
positional leader I think I'm an

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.850 
positional leader I think I'm an
influence<00:02:01.009> leader<00:02:01.689> I<00:02:02.689> think<00:02:03.200> my<00:02:03.380> leadership

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
influence leader I think my leadership

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.870 
influence leader I think my leadership
has<00:02:04.040> primarily<00:02:04.549> been<00:02:04.960> around<00:02:05.960> the<00:02:06.920> around

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
has primarily been around the around

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:13.420 
has primarily been around the around
ideas<00:02:08.780> and<00:02:09.290> possibilities<00:02:09.709> and<00:02:12.250> bringing<00:02:13.250> in

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
ideas and possibilities and bringing in

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.780 
ideas and possibilities and bringing in
knowledge<00:02:13.970> from<00:02:14.329> from

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
knowledge from from

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.589 
knowledge from from
the<00:02:15.939> practice<00:02:16.900> that's<00:02:17.140> been<00:02:17.260> marginalized<00:02:18.599> so

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
the practice that's been marginalized so

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:21.210 
the practice that's been marginalized so
I<00:02:19.629> think<00:02:19.720> there's<00:02:19.989> many<00:02:20.260> different<00:02:20.439> kinds<00:02:20.709> of

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
I think there's many different kinds of

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.740 
I think there's many different kinds of
leader<00:02:21.579> roles<00:02:22.150> and<00:02:23.069> certainly<00:02:24.069> not<00:02:24.310> just

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
leader roles and certainly not just

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.630 
leader roles and certainly not just
positional<00:02:25.750> it's<00:02:26.349> a<00:02:26.500> privilege<00:02:27.010> to<00:02:27.040> be<00:02:27.310> able

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
positional it's a privilege to be able

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.860 
positional it's a privilege to be able
to<00:02:27.819> lead<00:02:28.150> from<00:02:29.019> a<00:02:29.200> position<00:02:29.680> of<00:02:29.860> power<00:02:30.870> it's

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
to lead from a position of power it's

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.800 
to lead from a position of power it's
equally<00:02:33.000> creative<00:02:34.000> to<00:02:34.780> lead<00:02:35.310> and<00:02:36.420> make<00:02:37.420> change

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
equally creative to lead and make change

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:43.920 
equally creative to lead and make change
happen<00:02:37.900> at<00:02:38.590> a<00:02:38.650> very<00:02:39.220> local<00:02:39.610> level<00:02:40.950> I<00:02:41.950> think<00:02:42.930> the

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
happen at a very local level I think the

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.479 
happen at a very local level I think the
really<00:02:44.200> great<00:02:44.379> leaders<00:02:44.590> have<00:02:44.920> learned<00:02:45.189> to<00:02:45.340> do

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
really great leaders have learned to do

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:52.900 
really great leaders have learned to do
both

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.970
