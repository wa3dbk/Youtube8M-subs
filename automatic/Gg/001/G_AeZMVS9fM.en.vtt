village which is hard under the flesh of
the<00:00:05.549> I<00:00:05.759> was<00:00:06.390> feeling<00:00:06.660> very<00:00:06.779> confident<00:00:07.290> at<00:00:07.440> that

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
the I was feeling very confident at that

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.520 
the I was feeling very confident at that
point<00:00:07.830> so<00:00:08.000> my<00:00:09.000> final<00:00:09.179> fancy<00:00:09.660> not<00:00:09.990> necessarily

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
point so my final fancy not necessarily

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.129 
point so my final fancy not necessarily
instrument<00:00:11.190> like<00:00:11.280> the<00:00:11.519> black<00:00:11.730> and<00:00:11.969> my<00:00:12.809> to<00:00:12.870> do

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
instrument like the black and my to do

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.189 
instrument like the black and my to do
it<00:00:13.230> quite<00:00:13.440> real<00:00:13.620> but<00:00:13.860> thing<00:00:14.130> a<00:00:14.250> point<00:00:14.490> yeah<00:00:14.790> I

00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:15.199 
it quite real but thing a point yeah I

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:17.510 
it quite real but thing a point yeah I
suppose<00:00:16.199> it<00:00:16.470> would<00:00:16.680> be<00:00:16.800> definite<00:00:17.190> if<00:00:17.250> it<00:00:17.369> was

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
suppose it would be definite if it was

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.640 
suppose it would be definite if it was
maybe<00:00:17.910> halfway<00:00:18.210> through<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:19.020> match<00:00:19.199> and<00:00:19.470> I

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
maybe halfway through the match and I

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.560 
maybe halfway through the match and I
was<00:00:19.800> on<00:00:19.920> one<00:00:20.310> for<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.550> one<00:00:20.670> for<00:00:20.880> 70<00:00:21.300> if<00:00:21.449> you

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
was on one for the one for 70 if you

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.570 
was on one for the one for 70 if you
want<00:00:21.689> a<00:00:21.720> lot<00:00:21.840> more<00:00:21.869> confident<00:00:22.529> but<00:00:22.680> they<00:00:23.340> both

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
want a lot more confident but they both

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.140 
want a lot more confident but they both
have<00:00:23.760> been<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.449> fostering<00:00:24.949> they<00:00:25.970> stole<00:00:26.970> not

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
have been the fostering they stole not

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.300 
have been the fostering they stole not
used<00:00:27.359> to<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.539> cushions<00:00:27.960> that<00:00:28.140> stole<00:00:28.949> not<00:00:29.130> used

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
used to the cushions that stole not used

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.339 
used to the cushions that stole not used
to<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:30.000> bed<00:00:30.179> of<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.390> table<00:00:30.750> and<00:00:30.900> there

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
to the the bed of the table and there

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.700 
to the the bed of the table and there
was<00:00:32.070> a<00:00:32.130> coupler<00:00:32.809> any<00:00:33.809> Trekkie<00:00:34.170> shorts<00:00:34.590> I

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
was a coupler any Trekkie shorts I

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.490 
was a coupler any Trekkie shorts I
thought<00:00:34.920> on<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.700> bitchiest<00:00:36.030> because<00:00:36.899> it<00:00:37.020> is<00:00:37.469> a

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
thought on the bitchiest because it is a

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.840 
thought on the bitchiest because it is a
different<00:00:37.920> table<00:00:38.100> it's<00:00:38.370> that<00:00:38.489> your<00:00:38.610> first

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
different table it's that your first

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.030 
different table it's that your first
time<00:00:39.000> on<00:00:39.360> it<00:00:39.809> in<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:39.960> competitive<00:00:40.440> situation

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
time on it in the competitive situation

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.619 
time on it in the competitive situation
yeah<00:00:41.489> I<00:00:41.670> don't<00:00:41.910> think<00:00:42.120> we<00:00:42.180> should<00:00:42.210> overlook

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
yeah I don't think we should overlook

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.569 
yeah I don't think we should overlook
that<00:00:42.809> that<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.469> whole<00:00:43.829> business<00:00:44.250> of<00:00:44.340> doing

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
that that the whole business of doing

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.729 
that that the whole business of doing
this<00:00:44.820> in<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.480> first<00:00:45.570> frame<00:00:45.989> of<00:00:46.110> your<00:00:46.440> first

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
this in the first frame of your first

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.310 
this in the first frame of your first
match<00:00:46.980> is<00:00:47.520> it<00:00:47.910> puts<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.450> whole<00:00:48.600> thing<00:00:48.809> onto<00:00:49.200> a

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
match is it puts the whole thing onto a

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.900 
match is it puts the whole thing onto a
totally<00:00:49.620> different<00:00:49.890> level<00:00:49.980> oh<00:00:50.219> yeah<00:00:50.670> I<00:00:50.700> mean

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910

totally different level oh yeah I mean
it<00:00:51.020> was<00:00:52.020> some<00:00:52.559> believable<00:00:52.949> break<00:00:53.219> today

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
it was some believable break today
