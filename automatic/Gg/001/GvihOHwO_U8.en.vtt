00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
think McLean is trying to do is he's

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.130 
think McLean is trying to do is he's
trying<00:02:52.849> to<00:02:52.940> learn<00:02:53.090> him<00:02:53.300> into<00:02:53.540> the<00:02:53.629> ground<00:02:53.840> game

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
trying to learn him into the ground game

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.210 
trying to learn him into the ground game
and<00:02:54.319> trying<00:02:54.470> to<00:02:54.560> see<00:02:54.709> if<00:02:54.769> he<00:02:54.860> can<00:02:54.920> get<00:02:55.040> him<00:02:55.160> to

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
and trying to see if he can get him to

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.100 
and trying to see if he can get him to
exchange<00:02:55.610> with<00:02:55.760> him<00:02:55.849> but<00:02:56.420> Smith<00:02:56.660> won't<00:02:56.870> fall

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
exchange with him but Smith won't fall

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:58.720 
exchange with him but Smith won't fall
for<00:02:57.140> it<00:02:57.410> he's<00:02:57.500> just<00:02:57.680> basically<00:02:57.980> defending<00:02:58.580> it

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
for it he's just basically defending it

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.040 
for it he's just basically defending it
and<00:02:58.910> hitting<00:02:59.150> them<00:02:59.239> with<00:02:59.300> some<00:02:59.450> little<00:02:59.540> little

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
and hitting them with some little little

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:01.930 
and hitting them with some little little
shots<00:03:00.260> here<00:03:00.440> and<00:03:00.470> they're<00:03:00.590> not<00:03:01.580> really<00:03:01.730> doing

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
shots here and they're not really doing

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.160 
shots here and they're not really doing
much<00:03:02.000> damage<00:03:02.120> but<00:03:02.780> nonetheless<00:03:02.989> very

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
much damage but nonetheless very

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.430 
much damage but nonetheless very
effective<00:03:03.920> with<00:03:04.040> his<00:03:04.160> put<00:03:04.400> his<00:03:04.430> game<00:03:04.670> plan<00:03:04.700> I

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.630 

think<00:03:09.440> Smith<00:03:09.620> has<00:03:09.769> to<00:03:09.799> be<00:03:09.950> pretty<00:03:10.340> pleased

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
think Smith has to be pretty pleased

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.059 
think Smith has to be pretty pleased
