00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
think I'm about to die like

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.930 
think I'm about to die like
right<00:04:27.600> here<00:04:27.870> but<00:04:28.169> that<00:04:28.590> was<00:04:28.710> a<00:04:28.740> 26<00:04:29.340> killstreak

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
right here but that was a 26 killstreak

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.689 
right here but that was a 26 killstreak
and<00:04:30.180> i<00:04:30.900> think<00:04:31.620> i<00:04:31.740> don't<00:04:32.160> know<00:04:32.220> how<00:04:32.340> many<00:04:32.400> i<00:04:32.550> got

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:32.699 
and i think i don't know how many i got

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:34.580 
and i think i don't know how many i got
with<00:04:32.819> the<00:04:32.970> attack<00:04:33.270> helicopter<00:04:33.900> but<00:04:34.139> i<00:04:34.350> don't

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
with the attack helicopter but i don't

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.650

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
think it matters that much but anyways
