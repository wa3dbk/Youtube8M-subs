and<00:00:22.769> as<00:00:23.430> you<00:00:23.820> can<00:00:23.970> see<00:00:24.000> here<00:00:24.570> one<00:00:25.109> of<00:00:25.260> the

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
and as you can see here one of the

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.120 
and as you can see here one of the
coolest<00:00:25.740> features<00:00:26.310> in<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:27.330> game<00:00:27.570> is

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.130 
coolest features in the game is

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.640 
coolest features in the game is
headlights<00:00:29.130> now<00:00:29.820> these<00:00:30.029> don't<00:00:30.960> actually<00:00:31.410> do

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
headlights now these don't actually do

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.500 
headlights now these don't actually do
anything<00:00:31.679> and<00:00:32.279> they<00:00:32.669> don't<00:00:33.210> actually

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
anything and they don't actually

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.310 
anything and they don't actually
decrease<00:00:34.380> your<00:00:35.239> camouflage<00:00:36.239> at<00:00:36.690> all<00:00:36.809> so<00:00:37.110> it's

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
decrease your camouflage at all so it's

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.910 
decrease your camouflage at all so it's
a<00:00:37.820> completely<00:00:38.820> pointless<00:00:39.379> feature<00:00:40.379> but<00:00:40.770> it's

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
a completely pointless feature but it's

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.420 
a completely pointless feature but it's
kind<00:00:41.160> of<00:00:41.250> cool<00:00:41.489> nonetheless<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:43.040> we<00:00:44.040> are<00:00:44.219> in

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
kind of cool nonetheless and we are in

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.990 
kind of cool nonetheless and we are in

be mp3 or the been p3 as i like to call

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.810 
be mp3 or the been p3 as i like to call
it<00:00:48.410> it's<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:49.590> pretty<00:00:49.739> fast<00:00:50.070> little<00:00:50.430> armored

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
it it's a pretty fast little armored

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.060 
it it's a pretty fast little armored
fighting<00:00:51.120> vehicle<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:51.750> as<00:00:52.110> you<00:00:52.559> can<00:00:52.710> see<00:00:52.739> here

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
fighting vehicle and as you can see here

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.049 
fighting vehicle and as you can see here
it's<00:00:53.250> got<00:00:53.460> guided<00:00:54.000> missiles<00:00:54.360> although<00:00:55.170> i

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
it's got guided missiles although i

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:58.849 
it's got guided missiles although i
typically<00:00:57.059> don't<00:00:57.750> really<00:00:58.199> like<00:00:58.410> missiles

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
typically don't really like missiles

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.959 
typically don't really like missiles
that<00:00:58.980> much<00:00:59.629> or<00:01:00.629> obvious<00:01:01.320> reasons<00:01:01.739> so<00:01:02.579> I<00:01:02.609> like

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
that much or obvious reasons so I like

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.729 
that much or obvious reasons so I like
to<00:01:03.000> start<00:01:03.329> usually<00:01:03.809> with<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:03.989> missile<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:04.530> then

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
to start usually with a missile and then

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.300 
to start usually with a missile and then
if<00:01:04.979> I'm<00:01:05.880> ever<00:01:06.479> in<00:01:06.810> danger<00:01:07.110> of<00:01:07.350> being<00:01:07.650> shot<00:01:08.040> or

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
if I'm ever in danger of being shot or

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.270 
if I'm ever in danger of being shot or
need<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.299> maximize<00:01:09.900> my<00:01:10.140> DPM<00:01:10.650> I<00:01:10.890> will

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
need to maximize my DPM I will

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.380 
need to maximize my DPM I will
immediately<00:01:11.700> switch<00:01:12.299> to<00:01:13.460> like<00:01:14.460> likely

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
immediately switch to like likely

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.320 
immediately switch to like likely
high-explosive<00:01:15.930> if<00:01:16.619> I'm<00:01:17.040> facing<00:01:17.340> a<00:01:17.729> heavily

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
high-explosive if I'm facing a heavily

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.920 
high-explosive if I'm facing a heavily
armored<00:01:18.659> tank<00:01:18.900> or<00:01:19.970> AP<00:01:20.970> if<00:01:21.119> I'm<00:01:21.330> facing<00:01:21.720> a

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
armored tank or AP if I'm facing a

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.530 
armored tank or AP if I'm facing a
lightly<00:01:22.259> armored<00:01:22.530> tank<00:01:22.740> or<00:01:22.979> at<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.939> side<00:01:24.180> rear

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
lightly armored tank or at the side rear

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.109 
lightly armored tank or at the side rear
of<00:01:24.750> another<00:01:24.990> tank<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.640> that<00:01:26.640> guy<00:01:26.850> hit<00:01:27.090> a

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
of another tank and that guy hit a

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.160 
of another tank and that guy hit a
rather<00:01:28.020> tough<00:01:28.470> shot<00:01:29.360> missiles<00:01:30.360> are<00:01:30.509> extremely

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
rather tough shot missiles are extremely

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.280 
rather tough shot missiles are extremely
hard<00:01:31.380> to<00:01:31.560> hit<00:01:31.710> from<00:01:32.040> close<00:01:32.310> range<00:01:33.290> although

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
hard to hit from close range although

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.219 
hard to hit from close range although
they<00:01:34.590> are<00:01:34.770> easier<00:01:35.189> on<00:01:35.490> these<00:01:36.180> tanks<00:01:36.450> then<00:01:36.869> save

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
they are easier on these tanks then save

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.610 
they are easier on these tanks then save
the<00:01:37.409> swing<00:01:37.680> fire

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:39.620 
the swing fire

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.690 
the swing fire
so<00:01:40.190> as<00:01:40.370> you<00:01:40.520> can<00:01:40.640> see<00:01:41.410> these<00:01:42.410> are<00:01:42.700> autocannons

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
so as you can see these are autocannons

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.330 
so as you can see these are autocannons
with<00:01:43.910> massive<00:01:44.660> amounts<00:01:45.140> of<00:01:45.140> shells<00:01:45.860> in<00:01:46.160> them

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
with massive amounts of shells in them

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:53.500 
with massive amounts of shells in them
can<00:01:47.180> do<00:01:47.360> some<00:01:47.600> serious<00:01:47.810> damage<00:01:50.890> and<00:01:52.420> from<00:01:53.420> a

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:53.510 
can do some serious damage and from a

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.140 
can do some serious damage and from a
distance<00:01:53.630> you'll<00:01:54.140> want<00:01:54.380> to<00:01:54.530> ignore<00:01:55.220> AP<00:01:56.120> and

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:56.150 
distance you'll want to ignore AP and

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.450 
distance you'll want to ignore AP and
pretty<00:01:56.570> much<00:01:56.630> you<00:01:56.960> mostly<00:01:57.410> high<00:01:57.890> explosive

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
pretty much you mostly high explosive

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.280 
pretty much you mostly high explosive
even<00:01:58.760> though<00:01:58.880> they<00:01:59.150> only<00:01:59.180> do<00:01:59.630> a<00:01:59.660> fraction<00:02:00.230> of

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
even though they only do a fraction of

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.360 
even though they only do a fraction of
the<00:02:00.440> damage<00:02:01.210> most<00:02:02.210> ap<00:02:02.900> rounds<00:02:03.280> bounts<00:02:04.280> are

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:04.370 
the damage most ap rounds bounts are

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.540 
the damage most ap rounds bounts are
almost<00:02:04.640> all<00:02:04.880> though<00:02:05.120> bounce<00:02:05.360> and<00:02:06.310> as<00:02:07.310> you<00:02:07.400> can

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
almost all though bounce and as you can

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.700 
almost all though bounce and as you can
see<00:02:07.580> there<00:02:07.850> I<00:02:07.930> they<00:02:08.930> just<00:02:09.170> missed<00:02:09.350> me<00:02:09.530> with

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:09.710 
see there I they just missed me with

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:15.220 
see there I they just missed me with
another<00:02:09.920> missile<00:02:13.540> so<00:02:14.540> I'm<00:02:14.750> going<00:02:14.960> to<00:02:14.990> try<00:02:15.200> and

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
another missile so I'm going to try and

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.360 
another missile so I'm going to try and
spot<00:02:15.470> that<00:02:15.710> guy<00:02:15.980> but<00:02:16.310> we<00:02:16.700> aren't<00:02:17.590> so<00:02:18.590> if<00:02:18.920> you

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
spot that guy but we aren't so if you

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.540 
spot that guy but we aren't so if you
saw<00:02:19.550> his<00:02:19.790> tracer<00:02:20.390> is<00:02:21.160> giving<00:02:22.160> away<00:02:22.400> his

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
saw his tracer is giving away his

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.910 
saw his tracer is giving away his
position<00:02:22.820> so<00:02:23.270> I'm<00:02:23.390> gonna<00:02:23.540> look<00:02:23.840> here<00:02:24.230> for<00:02:24.500> any

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
position so I'm gonna look here for any

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.660 
position so I'm gonna look here for any
signs<00:02:25.700> of<00:02:26.170> tracers<00:02:27.170> and<00:02:27.470> then<00:02:28.040> shoot<00:02:28.400> at<00:02:28.550> that

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
signs of tracers and then shoot at that

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.980 
signs of tracers and then shoot at that
position<00:02:28.970> and<00:02:30.430> I'm<00:02:31.430> spotted<00:02:32.090> so<00:02:32.330> I<00:02:32.360> will<00:02:32.780> pull

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990 
position and I'm spotted so I will pull

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.290 
position and I'm spotted so I will pull
back<00:02:33.230> and<00:02:33.530> that<00:02:34.490> sounded<00:02:34.910> like<00:02:35.030> another

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
back and that sounded like another

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.700 
back and that sounded like another
missile<00:02:35.690> coming<00:02:35.900> my<00:02:36.110> way<00:02:36.140> so<00:02:36.290> there's<00:02:36.650> a

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:36.710 
missile coming my way so there's a

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:38.410 
missile coming my way so there's a
couple<00:02:36.980> tanks<00:02:37.310> on<00:02:37.670> the<00:02:37.820> other<00:02:37.970> team<00:02:38.210> with

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
couple tanks on the other team with

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:44.590 
couple tanks on the other team with
missiles<00:02:40.750> and<00:02:42.610> a<00:02:43.610> good<00:02:43.790> trick<00:02:44.060> if<00:02:44.270> you're

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
missiles and a good trick if you're

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.340 
missiles and a good trick if you're
using<00:02:45.050> missiles<00:02:45.620> odd<00:02:46.720> the<00:02:47.720> player<00:02:47.959> you're

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
using missiles odd the player you're

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.380 
using missiles odd the player you're
targeting<00:02:48.680> gets<00:02:49.220> a<00:02:49.370> warning<00:02:49.640> telling<00:02:50.030> him

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
targeting gets a warning telling him

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.070 
targeting gets a warning telling him
that<00:02:50.660> a<00:02:50.959> guided<00:02:51.800> missile<00:02:52.010> is<00:02:52.540> being<00:02:53.540> aimed<00:02:53.780> at

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
that a guided missile is being aimed at

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:59.170 
that a guided missile is being aimed at
him<00:02:54.290> so<00:02:55.690> it's<00:02:56.690> a<00:02:56.810> good<00:02:56.989> idea<00:02:57.140> to<00:02:57.700> not<00:02:58.700> even

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
him so it's a good idea to not even

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.530 
him so it's a good idea to not even
touch<00:02:59.540> the<00:02:59.900> enemy<00:03:00.230> tank<00:03:00.500> with<00:03:00.709> lloret<00:03:01.070> achill

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
touch the enemy tank with lloret achill

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.410 
touch the enemy tank with lloret achill
until<00:03:02.739> long<00:03:03.739> after<00:03:03.770> you<00:03:04.459> fired<00:03:04.820> the<00:03:05.090> missile

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
until long after you fired the missile

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.460 
until long after you fired the missile
so<00:03:06.290> if<00:03:06.410> you<00:03:06.560> do<00:03:06.739> it<00:03:06.860> right<00:03:07.100> you<00:03:07.400> can<00:03:08.260> swing<00:03:09.260> your

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
so if you do it right you can swing your

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.740 
so if you do it right you can swing your
reticle<00:03:09.890> on<00:03:10.100> to<00:03:10.400> him<00:03:10.640> about<00:03:10.850> a<00:03:11.030> second<00:03:11.600> before

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
reticle on to him about a second before

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.740 
reticle on to him about a second before
the<00:03:12.050> missile<00:03:12.230> hits<00:03:12.560> and<00:03:12.770> then<00:03:13.100> his<00:03:13.750> warning

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
the missile hits and then his warning

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.830 
the missile hits and then his warning
will<00:03:15.709> be<00:03:16.100> obviously<00:03:16.730> less<00:03:17.000> than<00:03:17.209> a<00:03:17.270> second<00:03:17.690> now

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
will be obviously less than a second now

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.479 
will be obviously less than a second now
and<00:03:18.080> he<00:03:18.440> won't<00:03:18.560> have<00:03:18.800> time<00:03:18.980> to<00:03:19.160> do<00:03:19.280> anything

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
and he won't have time to do anything

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:21.280 
and he won't have time to do anything
whereas<00:03:20.120> if<00:03:20.150> you<00:03:20.330> keep<00:03:20.540> your<00:03:20.690> reticle<00:03:21.020> on<00:03:21.140> him

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
whereas if you keep your reticle on him

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:22.960 
whereas if you keep your reticle on him
the<00:03:21.410> whole<00:03:21.440> time<00:03:21.739> he'll<00:03:22.010> have<00:03:22.160> a<00:03:22.190> warning<00:03:22.670> long

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
the whole time he'll have a warning long

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.270 
the whole time he'll have a warning long
before<00:03:23.450> the<00:03:23.570> missile<00:03:23.750> like<00:03:24.680> you<00:03:24.890> see<00:03:25.070> there<00:03:25.250> I

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
before the missile like you see there I

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.040 
before the missile like you see there I
i<00:03:25.670> got<00:03:26.030> the<00:03:26.150> warning<00:03:26.450> that<00:03:26.600> the<00:03:26.720> missile<00:03:27.019> was

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
i got the warning that the missile was

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:29.590 
i got the warning that the missile was
pointed<00:03:27.769> at<00:03:27.890> me<00:03:28.070> so<00:03:28.340> I<00:03:28.580> could<00:03:29.150> just<00:03:29.330> pull<00:03:29.570> back

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
pointed at me so I could just pull back

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.880 
pointed at me so I could just pull back
away<00:03:30.080> from<00:03:30.140> it

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:40.230 

and<00:03:33.010> this<00:03:33.760> guy<00:03:33.940> learns<00:03:34.180> why<00:03:34.420> missiles<00:03:34.840> suck<00:03:39.240> so

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:40.240 
and this guy learns why missiles suck so

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.510 
and this guy learns why missiles suck so
of<00:03:40.390> course<00:03:40.420> my<00:03:40.750> team<00:03:41.020> is<00:03:41.290> always<00:03:41.560> way<00:03:42.130> behind

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:42.520 
of course my team is always way behind

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:47.490 
of course my team is always way behind
me<00:03:44.340> so<00:03:45.340> I'm<00:03:45.550> gonna<00:03:45.700> think<00:03:46.030> about<00:03:46.150> moving<00:03:47.080> soon

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
me so I'm gonna think about moving soon

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.110 
me so I'm gonna think about moving soon
hopefully<00:03:47.680> they<00:03:48.100> can<00:03:48.160> get<00:03:48.459> rid<00:03:48.610> of<00:03:48.670> these<00:03:48.880> guys

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
hopefully they can get rid of these guys

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.230 
there and now we got shots on the back

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:29.490 
there and now we got shots on the back
of<00:04:26.380> the<00:04:26.470> Bradley<00:04:27.690> and<00:04:28.690> the<00:04:29.050> Brad<00:04:29.200> leaves<00:04:29.410> a

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
of the Bradley and the Brad leaves a

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:42.070 
of the Bradley and the Brad leaves a
good<00:04:29.620> little<00:04:29.800> tank<00:04:30.100> and<00:04:30.570> it<00:04:31.570> has<00:04:31.810> missiles<00:04:32.290> to

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.740 

so<00:04:42.650> as<00:04:42.710> you<00:04:42.830> can<00:04:42.919> see<00:04:43.099> these<00:04:43.280> autoloaders<00:04:44.090> just

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
so as you can see these autoloaders just

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:50.249 
so as you can see these autoloaders just
have<00:04:45.289> rates<00:04:45.710> of<00:04:45.919> fire<00:04:45.949> that<00:04:46.490> are<00:04:46.669> insane<00:04:47.599> and

00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:50.259 
have rates of fire that are insane and

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:51.909 
have rates of fire that are insane and
obstacles<00:04:51.259> it's<00:04:51.409> good<00:04:51.560> thing<00:04:51.710> to<00:04:51.800> remember

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:51.919 
obstacles it's good thing to remember

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:54.730 
obstacles it's good thing to remember
obstacles<00:04:52.639> are<00:04:52.759> a<00:04:52.819> lot<00:04:53.120> more<00:04:53.409> solid<00:04:54.409> than<00:04:54.439> they

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
obstacles are a lot more solid than they

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.950 
obstacles are a lot more solid than they
are<00:04:54.889> in<00:04:54.919> World<00:04:55.610> of<00:04:55.759> Tanks<00:04:55.939> so<00:04:56.449> you<00:04:56.539> can<00:04:56.840> get

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 
are in World of Tanks so you can get

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.110 
are in World of Tanks so you can get
hung<00:04:57.169> up<00:04:57.289> on<00:04:57.500> things<00:04:57.800> like<00:04:58.069> that<00:04:58.129> and<00:04:58.520> even

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
hung up on things like that and even

hitting poles or trees will often slow
you<00:05:01.550> down<00:05:01.879> dramatically<00:05:02.569> so<00:05:03.199> should<00:05:04.189> be

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:04.340 
you down dramatically so should be
