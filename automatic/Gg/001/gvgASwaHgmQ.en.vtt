00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:06.150
 There are a lot of problem confirmation problems of salt water 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.730
 Simmer 600 grams of 4% saline 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:12.429
 Evaporate the water 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:17.389
 Should I provoke Seongnam Gram to 6% saline? 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.140
 Let's organize it in Matsuoka 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.140
 Bad 4% saline solution 

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:29.499
 It is a medical school 

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:30.560
 And 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.470
 Staring at this means evaporating the water instrument This is 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.309
 Think of the water as a quarantine mechanism made water 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.590
 And 6% saline solution 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:47.700
 It means that 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:54.370
 Mizuno water xamler that how many grams of water should be evaporated 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.370
 Evaporate 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.580
 I will 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.580
 So it's great xbla 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:13.100
 Now only water x grams from 600 grams of saline solution 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.550
 Please consider 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.550
 So you can have 6% saline 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.550
 Yaku Blanc-xbla 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.580
 It means that the first fire in the country was cut off 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.510
 I was looking for the amount of salt contained next 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.060
 The amount of salt contained in 600 grams of 4% saline is 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.130
 It cost about 5 steps * 2100 minutes 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.230
 further 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:51.730
 The amount of salt contained in 6 grams of water is a performance 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:52.810
 Let me go 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.410
 Here is strong 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.250
 It was against 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.600
 And there was the amount of salt contained in 600-x grams of 6% saline 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.600
 Conversely-x * 4 100 minutes 

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:13.209
 The amount of this salt minus the amount of this salt is the whole 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:14.709
 Amount of food 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.349
 It will be the Kobe port format 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:18.749
 Organize it 

00:02:18.749 --> 00:02:21.839
 600 * 1100 or more 

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:24.509
 -10 will be omitted 

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:31.309
 ie six hundredths of a hundred lines later 

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:35.049
 The rate is multiplied by 100 and it has been 100 minutes 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:37.389
 I will calculate 

00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:42.199
 We will see past pans with 5 sets of 400 recalls 

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:45.559
 3600 minus 6x 

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:48.089
 Calculate in a row 

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:49.919
 It is docetax 

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:53.459
 3600-West Japan Project 

00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:58.249
 Physical strength xe plant 1200 

00:02:58.249 --> 00:03:02.129
 x equals 6 and comes out with 10200 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:07.839
 Water large 200 grams of evaporated 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:11.069
 This is also a problem 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:14.069
 This will be more than 600 grams 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:15.069
 Yeah 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:17.469
 It means that 

00:03:17.469 --> 00:03:18.069
 is this good
