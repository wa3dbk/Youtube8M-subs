first thing to do you need CD boxes like
this<00:01:09.720> for<00:01:10.409> example<00:01:10.830> we<00:01:10.979> have<00:01:11.159> this<00:01:11.369> one<00:01:11.640> so<00:01:12.000> we

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
this for example we have this one so we

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.270 
this for example we have this one so we
are<00:01:12.180> going<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.630> open<00:01:12.810> it<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.619> remove<00:01:13.979> what's

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
put one as a base this way this is my

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.059 
put one as a base this way this is my
base<00:02:19.660> for<00:02:20.080> example<00:02:20.170> and<00:02:20.890> I'm<00:02:21.819> gonna<00:02:22.090> put<00:02:23.069> the

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
base for example and I'm gonna put the

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:27.540 
base for example and I'm gonna put the
other<00:02:24.280> ones<00:02:24.610> this<00:02:25.300> way<00:02:25.630> so<00:02:26.230> before<00:02:26.890> I<00:02:26.920> put<00:02:27.100> this

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
other ones this way so before I put this

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:33.870 
other ones this way so before I put this
one<00:02:27.850> make<00:02:28.480> sure<00:02:28.510> to<00:02:29.410> scratch<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:33.250> area<00:02:33.640> right

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
one make sure to scratch the area right

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.160 
one make sure to scratch the area right
here<00:02:33.940> with<00:02:34.750> something<00:02:35.470> any<00:02:35.800> tool<00:02:36.160> like<00:02:36.850> this

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
here with something any tool like this

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.990 
here with something any tool like this
that<00:02:38.170> allows<00:02:38.500> you<00:02:38.709> to<00:02:38.950> scratch<00:02:39.580> it<00:02:39.730> a<00:02:39.819> little

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
that allows you to scratch it a little

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.740 
that allows you to scratch it a little
bit<00:02:40.180> to<00:02:40.660> make<00:02:40.810> sure<00:02:40.950> that<00:02:41.950> the<00:02:42.790> glue<00:02:43.060> will<00:02:43.720> work

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
bit to make sure that the glue will work

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.410 
bit to make sure that the glue will work
so<00:02:46.750> I'm<00:02:46.989> just<00:02:47.290> going<00:02:48.100> to<00:02:48.310> scratch<00:02:48.970> it<00:02:49.239> like

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
so I'm just going to scratch it like

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.150 
so I'm just going to scratch it like
this<00:02:51.450> just<00:02:52.450> this<00:02:52.660> way<00:02:52.930> I<00:02:53.260> don't<00:02:53.830> know<00:02:53.890> if<00:02:54.010> you

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
this just this way I don't know if you

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.789 
this just this way I don't know if you
can<00:02:54.340> see<00:02:54.670> this<00:02:55.590> can<00:02:56.590> you<00:02:56.680> see<00:02:56.910> so<00:02:57.910> just<00:02:58.799> scratch

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
can see this can you see so just scratch

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:06.840 
can see this can you see so just scratch
it<00:02:59.830> like<00:03:00.400> this<00:03:04.380> make<00:03:05.380> sure<00:03:05.410> that<00:03:06.160> the<00:03:06.370> glue<00:03:06.549> we

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
it like this make sure that the glue we

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:27.790 
it like this make sure that the glue we
go<00:03:07.030> inside

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:27.800 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:33.490 

this<00:03:28.800> way<00:03:29.360> the<00:03:30.360> glue<00:03:30.660> just<00:03:31.379> on<00:03:31.860> one<00:03:32.250> side<00:03:32.519> and

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
this way the glue just on one side and

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:49.819 
this way the glue just on one side and
to<00:03:34.500> make<00:03:34.709> to<00:03:35.160> put<00:03:35.370> enough<00:03:35.879> glue<00:03:36.269> right<00:03:36.599> here<00:03:48.829> as

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
to make to put enough glue right here as

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:54.229 
to make to put enough glue right here as
you<00:03:49.950> can<00:03:50.010> see<00:03:51.560> you<00:03:52.560> can<00:03:52.709> see<00:03:52.950> very<00:03:53.340> well<00:03:53.640> where

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
you can see you can see very well where

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:59.569 
you can see you can see very well where
I<00:03:54.269> did<00:03:54.630> put<00:03:54.870> the<00:03:54.900> glue<00:03:55.230> and<00:03:56.069> then<00:03:58.280> I'm<00:03:59.280> just

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
I did put the glue and then I'm just

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:17.259 
I did put the glue and then I'm just
going<00:03:59.970> to<00:04:00.090> put<00:04:01.819> our<00:04:02.819> first<00:04:03.480> piece<00:04:04.340> this<00:04:05.340> way

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:17.269
