00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.350
 Hello you and welcome 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.920
 to another video in the meantime 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:44.700
 already part 3 our beautiful carrera 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.020
 patrol offered the last video you have 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.450
 Seen as I am after swimming 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.289
 I had to have the boat then 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.550
 it was a bit of a change 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:55.920
 rather lengthy procedure 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.670
 We had a lot to do with the staff 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.770
 argue because career probably the 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.870
 should have issued something 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.460
 it does not matter if it is a rc 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.670
 whether that is a autorennbahn or 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.260
 otherwise something has to be done 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.420
 carrera 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.040
 Carera repairs that and you get it 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.590
 not immediately replacement how to do that 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.570
 maybe from other manufacturers 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.610
 As I said, I'm used to it for a long time 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.820
 then discussed this replacement 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.080
 bot got what with my now 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.439
 actual bread happened to me 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.659
 relatively no matter i would say that now 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.220
 First off together with us 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:36.840
 hopefully we have the boat 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.920
 if it's a bit more lucky so up 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.380
 the first look seems at least 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.579
 have to be all there first again 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.460
 we have the new walt blog for the 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:48.630
 remote control of the battery still one 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:50.850
 grab the microphone so what you get here 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.220
 still the quick charger a bit 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.960
 accessory attachments and of course ours 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.060
 A little getting used to remote control 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.430
 so i build everything now has the 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.170
 Battery charge and then we'll see 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.170
 if it works this time 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:10.410
 okay so you love the batteries 

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:11.750
 let's see if that's it now 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:17.420
 everything works like it from the 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:23.720
 should train remote control illuminated 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:25.310
 he offered to make is nothing at first oh 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.450
 so he has an automatic 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.450
 functions we'll see 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:36.980
 so there are two contacts it will now 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:43.970
 a bit complicated now 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:46.340
 look aha there so we have the 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.750
 Automatik that it really only in the water 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:52.610
 So we have two works 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:53.660
 contacts at the bottom and in the 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.810
 circuit is closed then 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:03:00.140
 So work is apparently only 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:02.810
 riesa test must be short out of hello and 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:07.690
 Welcome to love your test 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:11.110
 number felt 95 with our new 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:13.340
 carrera bread that's what it looks like 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.489
 I hope it lasts longer than today 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.780
 one and a half minutes on the water 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:20.420
 where today is currently one 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:23.290
 a bit warmer so that's it 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.290
 Do not swim that bad 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:40.190
 Of course, today there are no ends 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.190
 getting closer 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.900
 well will 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:09.110
 the turning circle has a bit of something 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:10.910
 a 40 tonner on the highway notices 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:13.660
 one also clearly the achievement course with the 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.660
 trunk 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:26.920
 You can not even half power or 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:29.820
 so follow so it's just full throttle or 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.820
 beforehand 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.940
 the platform works completely 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:51.410
 obviously quite normal except for that 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.410
 tail is already completely under water 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:00.070
 For the dust then all the more 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.070
 more spectacular 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:49.270
 but that was just jannis must 

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.910
 out a point area out 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:54.030
 and attach the boat again and again 

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:56.770
 automatically expectant so getting bigger 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:06:00.180
 become larger to drive the circles to 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:00.180
 it's back in the radio area inside 

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:07.199
 So nothing with swans and annoy ducks 

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:11.820
 how uncool 

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:53.030
 that's even when you 're driving backwards 

00:06:51.950 --> 00:07:07.490
 it was done so a bit thin whistling 

00:06:53.030 --> 00:07:09.790
 in the pool and had so far the 

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:09.790
 expires
