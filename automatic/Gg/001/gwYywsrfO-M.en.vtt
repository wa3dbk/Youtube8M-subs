00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.809
 It's a video where I'm going to show you 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.109
 my school supplies that actually 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.970
 It's college materials I've already recorded. 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.960

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.890
 had enough views 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.930
 so I decided to record it now in 2015 to 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.300
 You again then if you want to know 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.740

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.789
 just keep watching this video and 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.210
 let's go 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.790
 good the first new item from the middle of 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.590
 College studies is my glasses that 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.520
 You are seeing that you could see 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.899
 in games is also I changed glasses 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.969
 and I opted for a sunglasses in which I 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.070
 It felt good that we only felt 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.559
 an obligation to have to wear the glasses 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.110
 that I feel the way I look more beautiful 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:56.670
 of glasses then understood my first 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:58.020
 item is my glasses I liked it a lot and 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.870
 I do not feel an obligation today. 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.809
 how I felt I felt before I had to 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.850
 wear glasses but rather as an accessory 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.119
 I'll take it because even though it's anti 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.770
 reflection and sound with reflection 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.960

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.760

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:42.960
 but as it comes in the kit on the ruler is the here 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.560

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:14.970
 I like to be able to do the title to be able to 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.620
 Annotate an observation is no different. 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:20.790
 to make it stand out 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:23.790
 I also have no yellow text mark and 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:26.550
 in my case is this and for notes 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:31.290
 reminders to something so I bought this 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:32.670
 ariel's notebook of the little mermaid is 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:37.290
 a little notebook 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:40.680
 only with annotations even just for annotations 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:43.560
 nothing is too much for those who do not know I love and 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.340
 elton agents is my favorite princess 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.380
 from disney 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.380
 so that's why I chose this notebook 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:55.560
 and my great notebook even for 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:59.280
 writing college things is this 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:01.590
 very cute mini here too I found it 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.640
 cute cute cute little 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.640
 behind him is like this 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:14.040
 his leaf over here 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:16.320

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.510
 Little heart has mini and here where 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.520
 put the born has this other detail 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:22.350
 Then you must be wondering how 

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:24.390
 is that she has a notebook of a subject 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.640
 saying that she goes to college then 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:30.350
 every year is complicated by 10 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:33.150
 and always threw away leaves and 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.830
 it was not worth it so this year I chose 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.850
 for buying posts that I do not know 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.970
 for you 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:43.620
 this device few subjects tite 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:45.240
 Do you know that it has acronyms of pdp that only 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.320
 a name of the disciplines I put 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.050
 Sponsored links 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:53.340
 administrative all in acronym and then the pacu 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:54.840
 I open here in the discipline and you do not 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:57.690
 I need to buy a notebook of 10 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:01.110
 matters and throw everything away as 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:04.350
 happening and finally has the most 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:06.990
 important that is my vade mecum 2015 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:09.660
 compact I opted for compact because 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:12.570
 it's compact as the name already says it 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:14.190
 is not as big as the other and with another 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:15.930
 too big I was too lazy to 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:19.380
 carry and walk through all that 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:21.990
 college with that immense code to 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:26.250
 Who does not know I'm right and goes from 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:28.500
 maicon where it has the civil codes 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:30.690
 criminal code has all the codes here 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.290
 then every law student has to 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:32.700
