she's going to be demonstrating a great
leg<00:00:12.389> interval<00:00:13.080> so<00:00:13.559> basically<00:00:14.009> this<00:00:14.219> is

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
leg interval so basically this is

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.410 
leg interval so basically this is
something<00:00:14.580> that's<00:00:14.639> going<00:00:14.790> to<00:00:14.880> get<00:00:14.940> your<00:00:15.089> heart

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
straight down so this is not coming over

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:44.810 
straight down so this is not coming over
the<00:00:43.800> toe<00:00:43.920> is<00:00:44.040> really<00:00:44.250> important<00:00:44.550> gonna<00:00:44.700> go

the toe is really important gonna go

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.729

straight<00:00:45.210> down<00:00:45.239> good<00:00:45.930> I<00:00:46.110> think<00:00:46.440> I'm<00:00:46.530> right

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739

back<00:00:46.890> up<00:00:47.160> alright<00:00:47.640> let's<00:00:47.820> show<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.030> advanced

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
back up alright let's show the advanced

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.299 
back up alright let's show the advanced
version<00:00:48.360> overhead<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.170> ball<00:00:49.350> all<00:00:50.129> right

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
version overhead to the ball all right

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.639 
version overhead to the ball all right
good<00:00:50.430> so<00:00:50.789> why<00:00:51.329> is<00:00:51.390> this<00:00:51.480> more<00:00:51.750> advanced<00:00:52.170> well

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
good so why is this more advanced well

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.520 
good so why is this more advanced well
one<00:00:53.250> because<00:00:53.640> it<00:00:53.910> makes<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.270> really<00:00:54.300> long<00:00:55.020> lever

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
one because it makes a really long lever

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.229 
one because it makes a really long lever
and<00:00:55.860> that's<00:00:56.160> always<00:00:56.399> going<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:56.789> raise<00:00:57.030> your

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
and that's always going to raise your

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.790 
and that's always going to raise your
son<00:00:57.360> of<00:00:57.510> gravity<00:00:57.809> up<00:00:57.899> which<00:00:58.079> makes<00:00:58.320> it<00:00:58.410> harder

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
son of gravity up which makes it harder

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.160 
son of gravity up which makes it harder
to<00:00:58.829> balance<00:00:59.100> okay<00:00:59.670> but<00:01:00.270> great<00:01:00.690> way<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:00.899> do<00:01:01.050> it

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
to balance okay but great way to do it

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.380 
to balance okay but great way to do it
to<00:01:01.289> stabilize<00:01:02.010> your<00:01:02.190> foot<00:01:02.460> stabilizer<00:01:02.910> ankles

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
to stabilize your foot stabilizer ankles

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.090 
to stabilize your foot stabilizer ankles
so<00:01:03.480> it<00:01:03.539> doesn't<00:01:03.780> start<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:04.049> roll<00:01:04.260> if<00:01:04.739> it<00:01:04.949> does

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
so it doesn't start to roll if it does

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.410 
so it doesn't start to roll if it does
roll<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.580> you<00:01:05.670> keep<00:01:05.820> it<00:01:05.970> flat<00:01:06.180> that<00:01:06.360> means

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
roll and you keep it flat that means

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.609 
roll and you keep it flat that means
you're<00:01:06.659> strengthen<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.140> foot<00:01:07.350> which<00:01:07.500> is

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
you're strengthen the foot which is

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.219 
you're strengthen the foot which is
great<00:01:08.000> risen<00:01:09.000> i<00:01:09.119> love<00:01:09.390> this<00:01:09.570> split<00:01:09.869> lunge<00:01:10.080> as

great risen i love this split lunge as

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.679 
great risen i love this split lunge as
well<00:01:10.439> is<00:01:10.830> that<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.760> back<00:01:11.970> leg<00:01:12.240> is<00:01:12.270> stretching

well is that the back leg is stretching
okay<00:01:13.290> that<00:01:13.799> means<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.189> hip<00:01:14.400> flexors<00:01:14.850> are

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
okay that means the hip flexors are

the<00:01:38.970> reason<00:01:39.240> why<00:01:39.360> I<00:01:39.390> don't<00:01:39.600> want<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:39.780> short

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
the reason why I don't want a short

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.569 
the reason why I don't want a short
stance<00:01:40.290> is<00:01:40.500> because<00:01:40.950> your<00:01:41.100> knees<00:01:41.250> can<00:01:41.430> have

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
stance is because your knees can have

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.010 
stance is because your knees can have
more<00:01:41.729> of<00:01:41.820> a<00:01:41.850> tendency<00:01:41.880> to<00:01:42.270> go<00:01:42.360> over<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.780> totes

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
more of a tendency to go over the totes

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.870 
more of a tendency to go over the totes
and<00:01:43.259> I<00:01:43.590> want<00:01:43.799> you<00:01:43.860> to<00:01:43.979> actually<00:01:44.070> sit<00:01:44.430> back<00:01:44.640> into

and I want you to actually sit back into

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.670 
and I want you to actually sit back into

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.090 
rates going to get going but again it's

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:14.430 
rates going to get going but again it's
just<00:05:13.330> taking<00:05:13.600> a<00:05:13.660> little<00:05:13.690> bit<00:05:13.990> of<00:05:14.020> a<00:05:14.139> balance
