00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
inverted triangle I'm going to use a

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.049 
inverted triangle I'm going to use a
medium<00:00:53.870> size<00:00:54.290> brush<00:00:54.589> to<00:00:55.250> help<00:00:55.460> to<00:00:55.580> blend<00:00:55.850> and

motion to help with control and

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:03.130 
motion to help with control and
precision<00:01:00.879> and<00:01:01.879> again<00:01:02.150> I'm<00:01:02.360> blending<00:01:02.600> in<00:01:03.019> a

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140

precision and again I'm blending in a
downward<00:01:03.620> motion<00:01:05.530> because<00:01:06.530> my<00:01:06.710> face<00:01:06.950> is<00:01:06.980> a<00:01:07.220> bit

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.150 
and starting up a hairline we're going

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.640 
and starting up a hairline we're going
to<00:02:03.210> create<00:02:03.540> short<00:02:03.900> strokes<00:02:04.260> working<00:02:05.250> towards

a shimmer contour because shimmer

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.920 
a shimmer contour because shimmer
