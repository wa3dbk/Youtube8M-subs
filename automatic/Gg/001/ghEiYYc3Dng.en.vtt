00:00:10.231 --> 00:00:12.131
- Hello, I'm Margaret Iacono,

00:00:12.131 --> 00:00:14.391
Assistant Currator at
The Frick Collection.

00:00:14.391 --> 00:00:17.171
Today we're in the oval
room of The Frick Collection

00:00:17.171 --> 00:00:18.891
where we'll be visiting some paintings

00:00:18.891 --> 00:00:20.231
that are on loan to us from the

00:00:20.231 --> 00:00:24.531
Norton Simon Museum of Art
in Pasadena in California.

00:00:24.531 --> 00:00:27.291
We'll begin here with a beautiful painting

00:00:27.291 --> 00:00:31.311
by Spanish artist
BartolomÃ© Esteban Murillo.

00:00:31.311 --> 00:00:34.271
Specifically he's a 17th
century Spanish artist

00:00:34.271 --> 00:00:37.711
and he painted this wonderful,
beautiful painting of

00:00:37.711 --> 00:00:41.451
the birth of St. John the
Baptist in about 1660.

00:00:41.451 --> 00:00:44.471
And just to give you the basic story here,

00:00:44.471 --> 00:00:46.511
according to the Gospel of Luke,

00:00:46.511 --> 00:00:49.051
Zachariah, who we see standing here,

00:00:49.051 --> 00:00:52.551
and his wife Elizabeth
were old and childless.

00:00:52.551 --> 00:00:57.031
Zachariah while dutifully
lighting incense in the temple,

00:00:57.031 --> 00:00:59.291
is visited by the Archangel Gabriel,

00:00:59.291 --> 00:01:02.371
who tells him that he and his elderly wife

00:01:02.371 --> 00:01:05.251
will have a son, will name him John

00:01:05.251 --> 00:01:08.031
and he'll be filled with
the holy spirit from birth.

00:01:08.031 --> 00:01:11.791
Now Zachariah, being elderly,
is somewhat incredulous

00:01:11.791 --> 00:01:16.411
and asks the angel for a sign,
whereupon he is struck mute.

00:01:16.411 --> 00:01:18.531
And he loses his ability to speak

00:01:18.531 --> 00:01:22.111
throughout the entire conception

00:01:22.111 --> 00:01:24.231
and through the birth of his child.

00:01:24.231 --> 00:01:25.331
Now on the eighth day,

00:01:25.331 --> 00:01:27.651
after Elizabeth has
given birth to the son,

00:01:27.651 --> 00:01:31.391
the townsfolk gather around
and decide to name the child.

00:01:31.391 --> 00:01:34.451
And they choose to name him
Zachariah after his father

00:01:34.451 --> 00:01:37.751
despite Elizabeth's protests
that he be named John.

00:01:37.751 --> 00:01:40.971
Zachariah signals for a
tablet, a writing tablet,

00:01:40.971 --> 00:01:43.991
and writes down, "His name
is John," on the tablet

00:01:43.991 --> 00:01:46.553
and suddenly regains the ability to speak.

00:01:46.553 --> 00:01:49.453
And the child of course is called John

00:01:49.453 --> 00:01:52.633
and fulfills the prophecy and
it is clear to all the people

00:01:52.633 --> 00:01:55.913
that this child is a very special child.

00:01:55.913 --> 00:01:57.153
Now what we're looking at here

00:01:57.153 --> 00:01:59.753
is not actually the birth
of St. John the Baptist

00:01:59.753 --> 00:02:01.313
but the first bath.

00:02:01.313 --> 00:02:02.653
And none of the canonical stories

00:02:02.653 --> 00:02:04.293
actually describe the bath.

00:02:04.293 --> 00:02:07.093
Most likely this is meant to be symbolic

00:02:07.093 --> 00:02:09.793
of John the Baptist's future vocation.

00:02:09.793 --> 00:02:12.333
And we see this wonderful copper basin

00:02:12.333 --> 00:02:14.933
from which the child has just emerged.

00:02:14.933 --> 00:02:18.993
And he is seated on the lap
of one of his nursemaids

00:02:18.993 --> 00:02:21.393
and surrounded by three other nursemaids.

00:02:21.393 --> 00:02:24.773
His father Zachariah looks
on while his mother Elizabeth

00:02:24.773 --> 00:02:27.505
lies in bed recovering from her labors

00:02:27.505 --> 00:02:30.525
and is attended by a nurse as well.

00:02:30.525 --> 00:02:32.405
Now there are two
interesting sources of light

00:02:32.405 --> 00:02:33.565
in this painting.

00:02:33.565 --> 00:02:36.585
The child himself, who
emits this wonderful glow

00:02:36.585 --> 00:02:39.105
and this golden cluster of angels

00:02:39.105 --> 00:02:40.885
who peer down from the heavens

00:02:40.885 --> 00:02:43.345
upon the holy scene here.

00:02:43.345 --> 00:02:46.525
Now it's interesting that
Murillo decides to use the child

00:02:46.525 --> 00:02:49.245
as a source of light because the name John

00:02:49.245 --> 00:02:51.545
means morning star, Lucifer,

00:02:51.545 --> 00:02:54.845
and Christ calls John The
Lantern several times.

00:02:54.845 --> 00:02:56.285
in the book of John.

00:02:56.285 --> 00:02:59.005
So of course this is
probably symbolic as well.

00:02:59.005 --> 00:03:01.465
Also symbolic I think are these wonderful

00:03:01.465 --> 00:03:03.985
white glowing towels
that the nurses are using

00:03:03.985 --> 00:03:06.065
to dry and swaddle the child.

00:03:06.065 --> 00:03:09.185
The fourth century St. John Chrysostom

00:03:09.185 --> 00:03:11.045
describes St. John the Baptist

00:03:11.045 --> 00:03:13.785
as being whiter than
the whitest of garments.

00:03:13.785 --> 00:03:16.725
He tells us that if you
took a white garment

00:03:16.725 --> 00:03:18.225
and compared it to snow,

00:03:18.225 --> 00:03:19.605
suddenly the garment wouldn't look

00:03:19.605 --> 00:03:21.245
very white any longer.

00:03:21.245 --> 00:03:26.245
Likewise, St. John the Baptist
compared to another holy man

00:03:26.385 --> 00:03:29.017
outshines that other holy man by far.

00:03:29.017 --> 00:03:30.897
So I think it's possible that these

00:03:30.897 --> 00:03:34.157
wonderful glowing towels
have some symbolic qualities.

00:03:34.157 --> 00:03:36.937
Also important are the
words of St. Augustine

00:03:36.937 --> 00:03:38.737
who tells us how important

00:03:38.737 --> 00:03:40.797
the birth of St. John the Baptist was

00:03:40.797 --> 00:03:42.577
on the church's calendar.

00:03:42.577 --> 00:03:47.097
St. John's birthday is still
celebrated today on June 24th

00:03:47.097 --> 00:03:50.877
and we are told that
only three individulas

00:03:50.877 --> 00:03:53.937
in the canonical literature
have their birthday celebrated

00:03:53.937 --> 00:03:55.457
on the church's calendar,

00:03:55.457 --> 00:03:59.097
and that's Christ, the Virgin
Mary and St. John the Baptist.

00:03:59.097 --> 00:04:00.917
While the church celebrates the death

00:04:00.917 --> 00:04:02.378
of many saints and martyrs,

00:04:02.378 --> 00:04:04.638
they generally do not celebrate the birth.

00:04:04.638 --> 00:04:07.339
But because John the
Baptist like Christ and Mary

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:08.978
were believed to have been conceived

00:04:08.978 --> 00:04:10.658
free of original sin,

00:04:10.658 --> 00:04:12.778
his birth is actually
given a higher dignity

00:04:12.778 --> 00:04:14.858
than his death date.

00:04:14.858 --> 00:04:17.638
Interesting too is that Murillo creates

00:04:17.638 --> 00:04:20.899
these wonderful genre,
religious genre scenes.

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:23.838
As you see here, we have
these holy characters

00:04:23.838 --> 00:04:25.878
but they're set in everyday setting.

00:04:25.878 --> 00:04:28.798
We see this wonderful little
puppy on a child's chair

00:04:28.798 --> 00:04:30.478
who looks on at the action.

00:04:30.478 --> 00:04:31.978
And even the figures themselves

00:04:31.978 --> 00:04:34.618
resemble figures that
Murillo may have seen

00:04:34.618 --> 00:04:37.178
on the streets of Seville.

00:04:37.178 --> 00:04:38.658
The nursemaid that's holding him,

00:04:38.658 --> 00:04:40.418
instead of being a royal, regal figure

00:04:40.418 --> 00:04:43.318
is actually almost peasant like

00:04:43.318 --> 00:04:44.698
in the rip of her garment.

00:04:44.698 --> 00:04:46.738
She's a working class person.

00:04:46.738 --> 00:04:49.678
So Murillo takes these
people, these holy figures

00:04:49.678 --> 00:04:51.318
and puts them into
settings that would've been

00:04:51.318 --> 00:04:55.238
very recognizable to the
people looking at them.

00:04:55.238 --> 00:04:57.318
Interesting too, Seville at this time

00:04:57.318 --> 00:05:00.238
was a city in great despair.

00:05:00.238 --> 00:05:03.998
In 1660, we think this
painting was painted

00:05:03.998 --> 00:05:06.798
and just slightly earlier in 1649,

00:05:06.798 --> 00:05:08.178
the Bubonic Plague comes through

00:05:08.178 --> 00:05:10.818
and devastates half of the population.

00:05:10.818 --> 00:05:14.798
Two years later, in 1651,
a famine hits Seville

00:05:14.798 --> 00:05:17.638
and riots break out in response to this.

00:05:17.638 --> 00:05:20.418
Similarly, the local
river begins to silt up

00:05:20.418 --> 00:05:22.758
and enormous taxes are waged on the people

00:05:22.758 --> 00:05:24.478
to support foreign wars.

00:05:24.478 --> 00:05:26.039
So you can imagine that this is a people

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:27.639
in great need of some hope

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:30.260
and to some extent I think
Murillo does provide this

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:31.879
in his wonderful canvas.

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:33.599
Most likely this painting was in

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:36.330
one of the local churches or monasteries

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:37.350
that was in Seville.

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:39.910
And at this time there
were nearly 70 monasteries

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:42.810
and about 28 churches so
there are plenty of options

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:44.662
of where this may have hung.

00:05:44.662 --> 00:05:47.902
We don't know specifically
where the painting was installed

00:05:47.902 --> 00:05:50.703
but we do know that by the early 1800's

00:05:50.703 --> 00:05:52.802
Henry Gallingnight in England,

00:05:52.802 --> 00:05:54.202
a member of Parliament

00:05:54.202 --> 00:05:57.942
and an architect, a poet and an author

00:05:57.942 --> 00:06:00.042
had actually owned the painting.

00:06:00.042 --> 00:06:02.823
Probably acquiring it
during his travels in Spain

00:06:02.823 --> 00:06:04.822
earlier in the 1800's.

00:06:04.822 --> 00:06:06.915
In 1973 though,

00:06:06.915 --> 00:06:08.815
we know though that the
painting finds it's way

00:06:08.815 --> 00:06:10.475
to Wildenstien and Company

00:06:10.475 --> 00:06:13.195
and that is who Norton
Simon purchases it from.

00:06:13.195 --> 00:06:15.895
And this is in addition
to another painting

00:06:15.895 --> 00:06:18.715
by Murillo that Norton Simon already owns.

00:06:18.715 --> 00:06:21.195
So obviously the great
collector was quite a fan

00:06:21.195 --> 00:06:23.135
of this wonderful artist.

00:06:23.135 --> 00:06:25.535

more about this painting,
