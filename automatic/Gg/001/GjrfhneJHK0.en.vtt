they're a little bit heavier and you
know<00:00:31.560> it's<00:00:31.710> probably<00:00:32.040> just<00:00:32.130> my<00:00:32.340> mind<00:00:32.579> playing

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730

games<00:00:33.180> but<00:00:33.390> it<00:00:33.540> does<00:00:33.690> feel<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:33.960> tad<00:00:34.350> bit<00:00:34.530> heavier

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
games but it does feel a tad bit heavier

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.040 
games but it does feel a tad bit heavier
than<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.700> one<00:00:35.880> that<00:00:35.910> was<00:00:36.210> also<00:00:36.390> at<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.780> store

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.260 
than the one that was also at the store
this<00:00:37.770> is<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:37.950> one<00:00:38.129> I<00:00:38.160> have<00:00:38.370> at<00:00:38.520> home<00:00:38.550> already

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
this is the one I have at home already

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.690 
this is the one I have at home already
and<00:00:40.110> I<00:00:40.200> only<00:00:40.500> paid<00:00:40.739> two<00:00:40.860> dollars<00:00:40.890> for<00:00:41.309> this<00:00:41.489> eye

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
and I only paid two dollars for this eye

and I only paid two dollars for this eye
the<00:00:42.450> tags<00:00:42.690> torn<00:00:42.989> off<00:00:43.079> but<00:00:43.200> it<00:00:43.290> was<00:00:43.350> only<00:00:43.500> two

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.190 
the tags torn off but it was only two

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
dollars so I'll take the risk but I'm

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.360 
dollars so I'll take the risk but I'm
gonna<00:00:46.320> go<00:00:46.469> ahead<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:46.800> measure<00:00:46.950> them<00:00:47.190> right

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
gonna go ahead and measure them right

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.970

here<00:00:47.520> live<00:00:47.730> this<00:00:47.940> is<00:00:48.090> like<00:00:48.210> a<00:00:48.239> meat<00:00:48.809> scale<00:00:49.170> so

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
here live this is like a meat scale so

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.310 
here live this is like a meat scale so
it<00:00:50.579> is<00:00:50.700> pretty<00:00:50.879> accurate<00:00:51.149> so<00:00:51.449> just<00:00:52.020> turn<00:00:52.199> it

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
it is pretty accurate so just turn it

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.569 
it is pretty accurate so just turn it
down<00:00:53.449> let<00:00:54.449> it<00:00:54.570> get<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.780> zero<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.320> then<00:00:55.469> put<00:00:56.460> the

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
down let it get to zero and then put the

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.010 
down let it get to zero and then put the
original<00:00:56.910> Atlantis<00:00:57.539> on<00:00:58.250> that<00:00:59.250> I<00:00:59.280> know<00:00:59.430> it's

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
it's on the verge so it is a little bit

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.330 
it's on the verge so it is a little bit
heavier<00:01:37.200> I<00:01:37.320> wonder<00:01:37.590> I<00:01:37.680> don't<00:01:37.799> know<00:01:38.070> if<00:01:38.130> has<00:01:38.250> to

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
heavier I wonder I don't know if has to

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.880 
heavier I wonder I don't know if has to
do<00:01:38.400> with<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.579> stick<00:01:38.850> or<00:01:39.030> anything<00:01:39.350> but<00:01:40.350> that's

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
do with the stick or anything but that's

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.590 
do with the stick or anything but that's
interesting

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
interesting

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.819 
interesting
