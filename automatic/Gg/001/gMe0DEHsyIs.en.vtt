00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:08.320 
I've been having some some difficulties

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
I've been having some some difficulties
with<00:00:08.830> the<00:00:09.460> bow<00:00:10.150> drill<00:00:10.410> so<00:00:11.410> it's<00:00:11.559> I'm<00:00:11.920> having

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:12.340 
with the bow drill so it's I'm having

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.980 
with the bow drill so it's I'm having
the<00:00:12.460> Sun<00:00:12.670> right<00:00:12.880> in<00:00:13.000> my<00:00:13.150> face<00:00:15.209> the<00:00:16.209> the<00:00:16.599> the

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:16.990 
the Sun right in my face the the the

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.779 
the Sun right in my face the the the
classic<00:00:17.429> bow<00:00:18.429> drill<00:00:18.699> is<00:00:19.000> is<00:00:19.329> quite<00:00:19.689> tiresome

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
classic bow drill is is quite tiresome

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.630 
classic bow drill is is quite tiresome
you<00:00:21.789> have<00:00:21.999> to<00:00:22.179> do<00:00:22.710> non-natural<00:00:23.710> movement<00:00:24.279> and

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:24.640 
you have to do non-natural movement and

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.779 
you have to do non-natural movement and
and<00:00:24.939> it<00:00:25.779> puts<00:00:26.079> lot<00:00:26.319> of<00:00:26.499> strain<00:00:26.890> in<00:00:27.279> your<00:00:27.339> arms

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:27.789 
and it puts lot of strain in your arms

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:29.819 
and it puts lot of strain in your arms
and<00:00:27.999> I've<00:00:28.300> been<00:00:28.539> thinking<00:00:28.839> of<00:00:29.199> ways<00:00:29.499> to

00:00:29.819 --> 00:00:29.829 
and I've been thinking of ways to

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:33.690 
and I've been thinking of ways to
improve<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:31.810> the<00:00:32.410> the<00:00:32.800> movement<00:00:33.370> that<00:00:33.520> is

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:33.700 
improve the the the movement that is

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:39.180 
improve the the the movement that is
needed<00:00:35.970> in<00:00:36.970> a<00:00:37.330> way<00:00:37.510> that<00:00:37.720> that<00:00:37.990> you<00:00:38.070> could<00:00:39.070> do

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.190 
needed in a way that that you could do

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.290 
needed in a way that that you could do
it<00:00:39.340> with<00:00:39.670> the<00:00:40.390> less<00:00:40.600> effort<00:00:41.290> possible<00:00:41.620> and<00:00:42.300> so

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:43.300 
it with the less effort possible and so

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:49.820 
it with the less effort possible and so
I've<00:00:43.990> been<00:00:44.670> watching<00:00:45.670> other<00:00:47.490> ways<00:00:48.490> of<00:00:48.730> making

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:49.830 
I've been watching other ways of making

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:54.180 
I've been watching other ways of making
friction<00:00:50.830> fire<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.870> I've<00:00:53.230> got<00:00:53.620> some<00:00:53.890> ideas

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
friction fire and I've got some ideas

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.510 
friction fire and I've got some ideas
from<00:00:54.900> some<00:00:55.900> different<00:00:56.320> techniques<00:00:56.530> that<00:00:57.490> I

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:57.520 
from some different techniques that I

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.930 
from some different techniques that I
think<00:00:58.090> could<00:00:58.510> be<00:00:58.690> applied<00:00:59.020> to<00:00:59.460> the<00:01:00.460> the

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
think could be applied to the the

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.819 
think could be applied to the the
classic<00:01:01.420> bow-drill<00:01:02.320> method<00:01:03.960> so<00:01:04.960> in<00:01:05.350> this<00:01:05.530> case

00:01:05.819 --> 00:01:05.829 
classic bow-drill method so in this case

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:10.620 
classic bow-drill method so in this case
I've<00:01:06.220> got<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:08.770> the<00:01:08.969> normal<00:01:09.969> pieces<00:01:10.329> you<00:01:10.479> would

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
I've got the the normal pieces you would

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:17.399 
I've got the the normal pieces you would
use<00:01:10.840> the<00:01:11.710> the<00:01:12.569> notches<00:01:13.569> the<00:01:14.850> piece<00:01:15.929> of<00:01:16.929> woods

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:17.409 
use the the notches the piece of woods

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:25.910 
use the the notches the piece of woods
the<00:01:17.950> the<00:01:19.079> hand<00:01:20.079> bit<00:01:20.439> and<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:23.200> regular<00:01:23.889> drill

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
the the hand bit and the regular drill

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.499 
the the hand bit and the regular drill
I'm<00:01:26.920> using<00:01:27.389> and<00:01:28.389> leaf<00:01:28.829> I'm<00:01:29.829> using<00:01:30.130> a<00:01:30.850> normal

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:31.509 
I'm using and leaf I'm using a normal

I'm using and leaf I'm using a normal
tent<00:01:32.639> structure<00:01:34.079> garbage<00:01:35.079> not<00:01:35.350> not<00:01:35.969> parachute

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:36.969 
tent structure garbage not not parachute

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:41.690 
tent structure garbage not not parachute
parachute<00:01:37.719> his<00:01:39.209> college<00:01:40.209> is<00:01:40.389> very<00:01:40.600> expensive

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
parachute his college is very expensive

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.519 
parachute his college is very expensive
shoelaces<00:01:43.079> rip<00:01:44.079> off<00:01:44.319> very<00:01:44.649> easily<00:01:44.889> this<00:01:45.280> is

00:01:46.519 --> 00:01:46.529 
shoelaces rip off very easily this is

00:01:46.529 --> 00:01:52.440 
shoelaces rip off very easily this is
relatively<00:01:47.529> sturdy<00:01:48.299> so<00:01:49.299> I'll<00:01:51.240> proceed<00:01:52.240> to

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
relatively sturdy so I'll proceed to

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.550 
relatively sturdy so I'll proceed to
explain<00:01:52.719> how<00:01:53.289> I<00:01:54.270> devised<00:01:55.270> a<00:01:55.659> way<00:01:55.990> to<00:01:56.049> do<00:01:56.380> it

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
explain how I devised a way to do it

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:03.109 
explain how I devised a way to do it
with<00:01:56.889> less<00:01:57.189> effort<00:01:57.819> possible<00:02:00.929> the<00:02:01.929> process<00:02:02.709> is

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
with less effort possible the process is

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:08.699 
with less effort possible the process is
the<00:02:04.119> idea<00:02:04.359> is<00:02:04.479> really<00:02:04.509> simple<00:02:06.990> you<00:02:07.990> get<00:02:08.200> your

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
the idea is really simple you get your

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.240 
the idea is really simple you get your
pieces

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:18.600 

and<00:02:14.250> instead<00:02:15.250> of<00:02:15.520> drilling<00:02:16.260> vertically<00:02:17.610> we're

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
and instead of drilling vertically we're

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
and instead of drilling vertically we're
gonna<00:02:18.850> drill<00:02:19.120> horizontally<00:02:19.480> and<00:02:21.420> use<00:02:22.420> the

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
gonna drill horizontally and use the

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:32.130 
gonna drill horizontally and use the
rope<00:02:23.370> standing<00:02:24.370> up<00:02:26.250> and<00:02:29.100> this<00:02:30.420> not<00:02:31.420> only<00:02:31.870> takes

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
rope standing up and this not only takes

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.510 
rope standing up and this not only takes
the<00:02:32.290> strain<00:02:32.770> off<00:02:33.760> your<00:02:34.270> back<00:02:34.660> and<00:02:34.900> your<00:02:35.020> legs

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
the strain off your back and your legs

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.360 
the strain off your back and your legs
you<00:02:36.520> just<00:02:36.850> have<00:02:37.030> to<00:02:37.240> push<00:02:37.480> the<00:02:37.690> whole<00:02:37.870> thing

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
you just have to push the whole thing

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.890 
you just have to push the whole thing
inside<00:02:39.370> with<00:02:39.730> your<00:02:39.880> feet<00:02:40.210> to<00:02:40.450> keep<00:02:40.630> it<00:02:40.750> in

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
inside with your feet to keep it in

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.000 
inside with your feet to keep it in
place<00:02:41.140> and<00:02:41.580> then<00:02:42.580> use<00:02:43.530> up-and-down<00:02:44.530> movement

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
place and then use up-and-down movement

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.300 
place and then use up-and-down movement
with<00:02:45.190> both<00:02:45.400> hands<00:02:45.940> to<00:02:46.690> drill<00:02:47.290> and<00:02:47.590> this<00:02:47.890> has

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
with both hands to drill and this has

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.300 
with both hands to drill and this has
proven<00:02:48.700> to<00:02:49.090> be<00:02:49.120> a<00:02:49.570> lot<00:02:50.200> faster<00:02:50.230> than<00:02:51.010> the

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
proven to be a lot faster than the

00:02:51.310 --> 00:03:31.490 
proven to be a lot faster than the
regular<00:02:51.570> bow<00:02:52.570> drill

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.610 

take<00:03:32.130> your<00:03:32.280> fitting<00:03:32.660> adjust<00:03:33.660> the<00:03:33.900> pressure<00:03:34.140> in

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
take your fitting adjust the pressure in

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:40.580 
take your fitting adjust the pressure in
inwards<00:03:35.220> pressure<00:03:35.780> and<00:03:36.780> just<00:03:37.670> I<00:03:39.590> recommend

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
inwards pressure and just I recommend

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.630 
inwards pressure and just I recommend
using<00:03:41.190> some<00:03:41.610> larger<00:03:42.860> pieces<00:03:43.860> of<00:03:44.220> wood<00:03:44.400> for

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
using some larger pieces of wood for

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:50.920 
using some larger pieces of wood for
this<00:03:44.790> so<00:03:45.780> you<00:03:45.840> don't<00:03:46.170> burn<00:03:46.860> your<00:03:47.690> your<00:03:48.690> shoes

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
this so you don't burn your your shoes

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.410 
this so you don't burn your your shoes
then<00:03:51.930> this<00:03:52.560> is<00:03:52.800> the<00:03:53.040> idea<00:03:53.340> this<00:03:53.520> is<00:03:53.700> not<00:03:53.880> the

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
then this is the idea this is not the

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.020 
then this is the idea this is not the
right<00:03:55.200> wood<00:03:55.470> this<00:03:55.560> is<00:03:55.620> John<00:03:55.950> just<00:03:56.580> some<00:03:56.820> pieces

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
right wood this is John just some pieces

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.140 
right wood this is John just some pieces
of<00:03:57.240> wood<00:03:57.300> ahead<00:03:57.870> here<00:03:58.170> and<00:03:58.550> I'll<00:03:59.550> try<00:03:59.790> to

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
of wood ahead here and I'll try to

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:23.570 
of wood ahead here and I'll try to
produce<00:04:00.600> some<00:04:01.020> smoke<00:04:02.240> but<00:04:20.330> and<00:04:22.040> I'll<00:04:23.040> try<00:04:23.340> and

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
produce some smoke but and I'll try and

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.920 
produce some smoke but and I'll try and
make<00:04:23.880> this<00:04:24.060> with<00:04:24.390> the<00:04:24.419> right<00:04:24.690> pieces<00:04:25.500> of<00:04:25.800> wood

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
make this with the right pieces of wood
