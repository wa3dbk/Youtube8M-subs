00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:15.320
 hello friends welcome to another chapter 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.420
 reading with lenses as you know my 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.430
 name yesterday they give and today I come to you with a 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.850
 new review today I'm not going to 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:24.200
 talk about patches the connection of dan 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.240
 eggs 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.250
 this book they see in a contest that 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:32.630
 he made magic leaves that I'm going to leave his 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:34.190
 link here abajito this is last year 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:39.410
 2013 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:41.400
 strange but here it is but I read as in 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.830
 three days 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.990
 I'll tell you what I think we're going to 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.650
 go through in the design of the book is like 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:52.100
 a cap lasts me 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:56.210
 it's like a very bros room 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:59.270
 and where do you say patches have about 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.520
 relief the deputation this is a 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:04.130
 illustration is like a photograph already 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.780
 is here a part of the part of 

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:09.630
 behind 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:11.759
 alone goes in the biography of the book is well 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.689
 Now let 's get to what you're trying 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:18.420
 book that is marches the connection I do not know 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:21.689
 why it has the name in English but 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:25.530
 it should be facials so partial the 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:29.159
 connection of this book is set 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:32.429
 in the year 2065 is a dystopia is very 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:35.030
 famous the historical books but as 

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:36.770
 the game of hunger 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:41.740
 together 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.740
 parkes this room is well known but 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:51.759
 also 65 where people from a company 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:57.079
 that was called for people or by whom 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:59.280
 he invented the partials that are human 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:01.680
 which they are created ago 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:05.170
 we humans who are not human 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:08.080
 or as human clones 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:11.020
 who created it to fight the 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.510
 only partial war 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:16.990
 and they can not be played but 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.910
 personally they are spatial and a 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.040
 moment and that the partials left in 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.350
 against humans and a great battle 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.530
 and the passionaries created the virus 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:28.840
 rm and this virus is lethal for 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:33.270
 women who are pregnant give birth to 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.270
 your son and your son 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.970
 It is sad and shocking just like the 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:41.340
 bed of this book as well as the point 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:45.239
 main that has this link and there 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:49.230
 like the government that has the law of the 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:50.640
 hope that girls who are 16 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.549
 years you have to be en masse for 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.409
 obligation for their children to be born and 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:57.930
 wash experiment to the son to see 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:59.129
 how to discover how to combat this 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.670
 virus 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:01.670
 the partial 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:14.750
 work on that road where they give birth to 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.750
 these babies and they already say oh 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.960
 I have to discover some of these and 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:22.420
 begins reading this book which is 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.400
 quite interesting very entertaining and 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.030
 has several medical concerts this 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.050
 book 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.810
 they are not difficult to understand 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.460
 because you breathe everything but I loved it 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:34.180
 this book I thought it was not going to be so 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:37.049
 good but I found the best 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.049
 and in the end it's like 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:44.310
 and here it says the only hope for the 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:46.410
 humanity is not a 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:49.440
 I found the book of the saga for made 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:51.599
 in kind this only locates this in 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.420
 the second part is called fragments that 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:57.989
 it's outside 1.014 and I'm very anxious 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:00.420
 for reading it because in the end it is how it is 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:04.830
 like before reading the game's flames 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:07.210
 of hunger as well as an opportunity 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:09.310
 It's a pretty good book 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:11.020
 and as we said perspectives but I 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:14.590
 loved it because this is already too 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:16.810
 good and final of very good and there are many 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.930
 interesting things to cover and those 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.930
 things 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:28.810
 I had never read it and with this book 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:32.170
 I loved it and see the book this gentleman 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:34.720
 so that teaches today's patches 

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:36.850
 connection is pretty good and I hope 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.940
 that you read it also did 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:43.090
 majority and to buy it is also 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:45.300
 accessible and dispatch in the connection 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.300
 such 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:52.770
 I liked a kiss to all work 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.510
 in social networks to follow me and 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:59.480
