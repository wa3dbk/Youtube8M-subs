00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:16.750
 We see it directly here at the barracks today. 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:19.210
 General of the game would still microsoft 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.980
 talk to him famous guilherme camargo 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:25.029
 drummer of the street bulldogs who 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:28.290
 spare time is xbox Brazil manager 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:28.290
 every hobby 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.970
 speaking of king or four years there as 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.690
 you are dealing with all the feedback and 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:44.430
 now gave about that location 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.110
 we had very positive jets 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.809
 we kept the same pattern of the kingdom 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.040
 3 netter many consumers who 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.980
 obviously prefer audio in English 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:55.850
 but as River 3 was released in Portuguese 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.620
 we maintain the same quality then 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.530
 positive and constructive criticism 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.050
 are always understood by microsoft but 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.519
 I think that in a general way it was 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.950
 make a positive note 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.750
 a doubt that everyone will love you because 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.729
 audio in English is not optional only 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.890
 Portuguese the size of the media 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.880
 she and her family here in Brazil the 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:20.430
 behaved the Portuguese version 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.440
 so this is a limiting we people 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.450
 has seen the players all there is a 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.190
 point in common regarding dubbing of 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.250
 games they have no access to any type 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:32.340
 of you the material of this type and what 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:36.149
 end up causing errors of interpretation 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:38.850
 of feeling the scenes using a 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:40.799
 because this is possible 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.600
 occurs worldwide when the 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.580
 same time as the 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.659
 finalizing the charts then too 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:50.729
 are several and several processes 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.979
 occurring at the same time in some 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.020
 all this comes together in the case of 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.930
 microsoft has some advantages, right? 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:01.259
 ours also have access to the 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.700
 then depending on the game 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.280
 each has a different process in the 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.650
 example the case of the kingdom to us 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.590
 also have access to the images in the 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:12.090
 case of the blog then 15 and up because 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.430
 maybe I think it's even a little 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.920
 above the local market average 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.110
 good now a more personal project who 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.420
 will be the last mind when I played a 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.610
 little game but the people are playing 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.370
 we are dedicating ourselves to the force of courage 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.200
 I have profile problems a little more 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.510
 racing games 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.760
 in this simulation and I believe then 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.840
 that the force for reason for me is being the 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.079
 game of the moment 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.540
 You're a guy and go and play. 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:41.819
 loves to meet with the online galera are 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.140
 A little selfish because playing online 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:45.209
 the teacher program had a little 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.129
 difficult because there is always someone 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:50.519
 wanting a chance to access 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:53.099
 extra game questions then end up playing 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:55.889
 much more offline and the 101 obviously have 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:59.250

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:08.430

 marketing of the end consumer tam 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.079
 today we are absolute leaders in the 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:15.329
 strengthening of the official market will 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:18.810
 be a black market under the right 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:21.719
 low price is due to manufacturing 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.340
