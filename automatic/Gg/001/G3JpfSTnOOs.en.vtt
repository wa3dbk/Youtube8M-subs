00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:04.199
 Perfect 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.980
 Perfect 

00:00:08.779 --> 00:00:11.779
 each 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.599
 Perfect 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.880
 I'll see how you feel being the forerunner of this movement so it's 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.880
 important the procedural movement 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.589
 Wish one imagines it's summer 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:34.450
 of today until she aia the situation of Brazil in relation to it until changed 

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:38.940
 so much after a year that I decided to buy this fight do not miss 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.220
 believe things can get a little enriching 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.490
 gradually we are crawling to change the things that I am 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.060
 super happy 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.660
 I had the courage to do this. 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.950
 and that is one thing of a game and you that reference to thousands of 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.120
 women after you start appearing in the media 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.489
 thousands of women will suddenly become Ã©rika who could become a model 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.399
 This is what I ask for you, this reference is so positive and 

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:14.220
 expectation with the high in the price the women I stay without knowing if I have to have 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.990
 to reach this point where she was going in this area, women are 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.950
 to value yourself if you like and respect 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.140
 the acidity is better 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.790
 s to extend the paranoia and ilan a little 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.670
 mainly this side of the former minister 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.350
 want to have opportunities that this client management model why 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.600
 fortunately of ours and still wonderful witch has right said 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.950
 I can make a lot of money and I'm very happy. 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.160
 we have almost grown the 'brainwashing' of qi 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.460
 we do not know what the 20 is a negative thing 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:02.220
 ugly 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.380
 we do not have no recognition in the world here knows 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.060
 of land fashion the possibility of buying the same house said the friend 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.059
 who made 34 76 contract 

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:19.229
 so it can not be denied because it is a factor of interest, 

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:20.949
 fight really is 

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:23.199
 we can demonstrate 

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:28.799
 I do not see a photograph of a campaign other than a television commercial 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:31.799
 a positive thing for what gradually we 

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:36.740
 to teach women who wears large size and from Brazil said 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:42.030
 It's not like that. It does not have it. We do not have to have that goal if there is a 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.689
 negativity a woman 

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:47.620
 this morning among others also because we even learned here 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.220
 what we look like is not positive what you buy clothes doing this 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.509
 contract 

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:58.509
 nine science departments do not know said that was drawing and account 

00:02:58.509 --> 00:03:03.270
 everything then I came back I have no prejudice against anything I think give 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.210
 the department store also no longer uses you always find something that the 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:09.589
 people work based on the wardrobe 

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:13.829
 I just won personal were Joan of Arc the victim even more popular 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:23.029
 There's a lot of brand in England that I'm a fan of. I love it when I go to work. 

00:03:23.029 --> 00:03:27.769
 in london that comes back three suitcases and to return home they have this team 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:31.239
 has such a vastness of choices so there is not a thing 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:36.049
 very low should have something older than I think it's natural to combine 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:40.459
 Been a more modern piece I think the most important everyone knows 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:44.919
 is that biotype we commit the physical structure we have I have 

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:48.629
 more hip have women who are six more on the scene so you have to 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:53.089
 know your silver body can develop a good piece then 

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:56.879
 that white is better for your biotype I really wanted to have that opportunity 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:05.079
 It is wise to old show women who made my size women sat 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:08.639
 who buy what we need from that street of that bit of inspiration 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:13.439
 and know how to protect yourself is something that people in Brazil have not yet 

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:15.709
 wise 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:20.989
 diddy create this kind of activity and atmosphere because the woman then savi 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:23.710
 work for me here in Brazil the series a 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.810
 works inside Brazil for you one of the things that at the moment is what 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:33.220
 I like to do it, I would not want to have to know if he 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.849
 opportunity came with my own country and in comparing it speaks out and 

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:39.320
 show what was done in my country 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.440
 has quality is beautiful or the women of my country who wear my size 

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:48.110
 Do you know if they wear stylish intent? 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.460
