view out that way and I thought I'd do a
video<00:00:08.730> on<00:00:09.179> my<00:00:09.750> cooking<00:00:10.080> kit<00:00:11.210> you<00:00:12.210> guys<00:00:12.330> have

stove<00:00:44.340> I<00:00:44.670> just<00:00:45.239> prefer<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.629> use<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.079> Trangia

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
stove I just prefer to use the Trangia

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.740 
stove I just prefer to use the Trangia
which<00:00:46.829> is<00:00:46.950> a<00:00:46.980> little<00:00:47.280> bit<00:00:47.370> heavier<00:00:47.730> than<00:00:47.820> some

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
which is a little bit heavier than some

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.439 
which is a little bit heavier than some
of<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:48.989> homemade<00:00:49.379> alcohol<00:00:49.620> stoves<00:00:50.449> which

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
of the homemade alcohol stoves which

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:52.850 
of the homemade alcohol stoves which
adds<00:00:51.660> a<00:00:51.750> little<00:00:51.960> bit<00:00:52.079> more<00:00:52.260> weight<00:00:52.500> but<00:00:52.829> I

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
adds a little bit more weight but I

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.080 
adds a little bit more weight but I
don't<00:00:53.070> mind<00:00:53.340> it<00:00:53.489> it's<00:00:53.610> a<00:00:53.670> little<00:00:53.730> bit<00:00:53.879> more

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
don't mind it it's a little bit more

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.810 
don't mind it it's a little bit more
durable<00:00:54.600> than<00:00:54.809> most<00:00:55.440> of<00:00:55.680> them<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:56.039> I<00:00:56.309> just<00:00:56.610> I

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
durable than most of them and I just I

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.939 
durable than most of them and I just I
just<00:00:57.030> like<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.449> Trangia<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.710> way<00:00:58.800> it's

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
just like the Trangia and the way it's

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.069 
just like the Trangia and the way it's
set<00:00:59.010> up<00:00:59.160> but<00:01:00.149> as<00:01:00.239> you<00:01:00.359> can<00:01:00.480> see<00:01:00.629> I<00:01:00.660> got<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:00.899> all

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.679 
keep the pot warm and insulated a little
bit<00:01:33.930> better<00:01:34.110> it<00:01:34.770> is<00:01:34.890> a<00:01:34.920> little<00:01:35.189> heavy<00:01:35.460> it's<00:01:35.909> a<00:01:36.119> I

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
bit better it is a little heavy it's a I

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.450 
bit better it is a little heavy it's a I
believe<00:01:37.170> it's<00:01:37.380> between<00:01:38.060> 8<00:01:39.060> ounces<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:40.460> it

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
believe it's between 8 ounces and it

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.010 
believe it's between 8 ounces and it
might<00:01:41.610> even<00:01:41.640> be<00:01:41.939> what<00:01:42.240> this<00:01:42.509> might<00:01:42.720> even<00:01:42.750> be

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
might even be what this might even be

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.850 
might even be what this might even be
I'm<00:01:43.590> sorry<00:01:44.159> not<00:01:44.340> 8<00:01:44.909> ounces<00:01:45.299> but<00:01:45.649> like<00:01:46.649> half

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
I'm sorry not 8 ounces but like half

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.499 
I'm sorry not 8 ounces but like half
between<00:01:47.070> 1/2<00:01:47.430> an<00:01:47.549> ounce<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:47.909> an<00:01:47.970> out<00:01:48.119> so<00:01:48.390> it

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
between 1/2 an ounce and an out so it

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.550 
between 1/2 an ounce and an out so it
does<00:01:48.659> add<00:01:48.869> some<00:01:49.200> weight<00:01:49.439> but<00:01:50.659> I<00:01:51.659> don't<00:01:52.200> mind<00:01:52.380> it

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
does add some weight but I don't mind it

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.289 
does add some weight but I don't mind it
I<00:01:52.740> could<00:01:53.009> make<00:01:53.159> a<00:01:53.189> homemade<00:01:53.579> one<00:01:53.759> but<00:01:53.970> I<00:01:54.030> prefer

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
I could make a homemade one but I prefer

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:55.460 
I could make a homemade one but I prefer
to<00:01:54.329> just<00:01:54.540> use<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.840> one<00:01:54.990> that<00:01:55.020> came<00:01:55.229> with<00:01:55.259> the

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
to just use the one that came with the

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.359 
to just use the one that came with the
pot<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:56.990> as<00:01:57.990> I<00:01:58.170> said<00:01:58.229> this<00:01:58.500> is<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.680> GSI<00:01:59.130> pot

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
pot and as I said this is the GSI pot

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.510 
pot and as I said this is the GSI pot
that<00:01:59.549> I<00:01:59.610> use<00:01:59.850> it<00:02:00.600> has<00:02:00.810> a<00:02:00.860> nice<00:02:01.860> handle<00:02:02.310> on<00:02:02.369> the

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
that I use it has a nice handle on the

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.090 
that I use it has a nice handle on the
side<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:02.939> handle<00:02:03.240> is<00:02:03.360> removable<00:02:03.960> you<00:02:04.860> just

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
side the handle is removable you just

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.010 
side the handle is removable you just
squeeze<00:02:05.430> it<00:02:05.700> and<00:02:06.149> it<00:02:07.129> comes<00:02:08.129> out<00:02:08.750> like<00:02:09.750> that

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
squeeze it and it comes out like that

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.160 
squeeze it and it comes out like that
this<00:02:10.979> is<00:02:11.220> this<00:02:12.000> is<00:02:12.060> actually<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.629> bulk<00:02:12.840> of<00:02:13.020> the

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
this is this is actually the bulk of the

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.990 
this is this is actually the bulk of the
weight<00:02:13.290> of<00:02:13.440> the<00:02:13.530> pan

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
weight of the pan

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.640 
weight of the pan
I<00:02:14.030> believe<00:02:14.270> this<00:02:14.450> is<00:02:14.630> a<00:02:14.660> steel<00:02:15.410> with<00:02:15.620> the

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
I believe this is a steel with the

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.240 
I believe this is a steel with the
insulated<00:02:16.280> wrap<00:02:16.490> on<00:02:16.700> it<00:02:17.020> the<00:02:18.020> pots<00:02:18.770> actually<00:02:19.220> a

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
insulated wrap on it the pots actually a

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.760 
insulated wrap on it the pots actually a
lot<00:02:19.430> lighter<00:02:19.730> or<00:02:20.120> it<00:02:20.900> would<00:02:21.170> be<00:02:21.320> a<00:02:21.350> lot<00:02:21.530> lighter

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
lot lighter or it would be a lot lighter

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.600

like<00:03:50.870> it<00:03:51.079> and<00:03:51.739> doesn't<00:03:52.400> weigh<00:03:52.579> too<00:03:52.640> much

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:52.820 
like it and doesn't weigh too much

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.960 
like it and doesn't weigh too much
around<00:03:53.480> four<00:03:53.720> ounces<00:03:54.110> I<00:03:54.260> believe<00:03:54.670> but<00:03:55.670> what

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
around four ounces I believe but what

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:57.100 
around four ounces I believe but what
I'll<00:03:56.060> do<00:03:56.209> is<00:03:56.360> I'll<00:03:56.480> put<00:03:56.630> all<00:03:56.690> the<00:03:56.780> weights

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110 
I'll do is I'll put all the weights

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.770 
I'll do is I'll put all the weights
inside<00:03:57.650> of<00:03:57.950> the<00:03:58.340> video<00:03:58.489> because<00:03:59.390> I<00:03:59.420> don't<00:03:59.660> have

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
inside of the video because I don't have

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.479 
inside of the video because I don't have
them<00:03:59.930> all<00:04:00.110> calculated<00:04:00.739> in<00:04:00.980> my<00:04:01.100> head<00:04:01.310> I<00:04:01.340> just

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:01.489 
them all calculated in my head I just

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:03.340 
them all calculated in my head I just
know<00:04:01.760> the<00:04:01.910> overall<00:04:02.390> weight<00:04:02.600> of<00:04:02.750> this<00:04:02.900> system

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:03.350 
know the overall weight of this system

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:07.479 
know the overall weight of this system
but<00:04:04.340> the<00:04:04.459> Trangia<00:04:04.700> comes<00:04:05.239> with<00:04:05.450> a<00:04:05.950> an<00:04:06.950> o-ring

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:07.489 
but the Trangia comes with a an o-ring

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:10.449 
but the Trangia comes with a an o-ring
sealed<00:04:08.000> cat<00:04:08.360> lid<00:04:08.690> or<00:04:08.989> cap<00:04:09.290> that<00:04:09.890> you<00:04:09.980> can<00:04:10.130> screw

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
sealed cat lid or cap that you can screw

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:12.819 
sealed cat lid or cap that you can screw
on<00:04:10.489> it<00:04:11.180> will<00:04:11.510> hold<00:04:11.810> some<00:04:12.049> fuel<00:04:12.320> but<00:04:12.530> in<00:04:12.680> my

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:12.829 
on it will hold some fuel but in my

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:15.640 
on it will hold some fuel but in my
experience<00:04:13.280> that<00:04:13.340> almost<00:04:13.640> always<00:04:13.940> leaks<00:04:14.650> and

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
experience that almost always leaks and

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.909 
experience that almost always leaks and
it<00:04:15.769> comes<00:04:15.980> with<00:04:16.070> a<00:04:16.519> simmer<00:04:17.359> ring<00:04:17.870> and<00:04:18.350> also

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:18.919 
it comes with a simmer ring and also

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:20.440 
it comes with a simmer ring and also
this<00:04:19.370> works<00:04:19.609> good<00:04:19.850> if<00:04:19.970> you<00:04:20.030> want<00:04:20.180> to<00:04:20.239> put<00:04:20.359> out

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.450 
this works good if you want to put out

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:22.210 
this works good if you want to put out
the<00:04:20.570> flame<00:04:20.870> if<00:04:21.320> you<00:04:21.410> have<00:04:21.500> some<00:04:21.650> alcohol<00:04:21.829> left

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
the flame if you have some alcohol left

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:23.710 
the flame if you have some alcohol left
you<00:04:22.310> just<00:04:22.340> put<00:04:22.610> it<00:04:22.700> over<00:04:22.760> the<00:04:22.970> top<00:04:23.180> and<00:04:23.330> the

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
you just put it over the top and the

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.390 
you just put it over the top and the
flame<00:04:23.960> goes<00:04:24.200> out<00:04:24.410> I<00:04:24.620> just<00:04:24.919> keep<00:04:25.070> that<00:04:25.220> in<00:04:25.340> a

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
flame goes out I just keep that in a

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:26.850 
flame goes out I just keep that in a
ziploc<00:04:25.760> bag

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
ziploc bag

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.680 
ziploc bag
just<00:04:27.860> in<00:04:27.980> case<00:04:28.160> I<00:04:28.280> had<00:04:28.430> any<00:04:28.580> fuel<00:04:28.880> or<00:04:29.180> fumes<00:04:29.510> in

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
just in case I had any fuel or fumes in

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.600 
just in case I had any fuel or fumes in
it<00:04:29.840> it<00:04:30.050> doesn't<00:04:30.350> leak<00:04:30.470> out<00:04:30.590> into<00:04:30.620> my<00:04:31.010> cup<00:04:31.340> then

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
it it doesn't leak out into my cup then

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.050 
it it doesn't leak out into my cup then
I<00:04:31.700> put<00:04:31.910> it<00:04:32.000> in<00:04:32.950> so<00:04:33.950> once<00:04:34.310> again<00:04:34.430> this<00:04:34.700> goes<00:04:34.880> in

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
I put it in so once again this goes in

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.640 
I put it in so once again this goes in
the<00:04:35.150> cup<00:04:36.550> with<00:04:37.550> my<00:04:37.870> collapsible<00:04:38.870> spoon<00:04:39.350> or

hardware<00:04:49.070> cloth<00:04:49.370> pot<00:04:49.880> stand<00:04:50.210> weighs<00:04:51.170> almost

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 
hardware cloth pot stand weighs almost

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.740 
hardware cloth pot stand weighs almost
nothing<00:04:51.650> this<00:04:52.250> is<00:04:52.310> I<00:04:52.550> believe<00:04:52.580> the<00:04:53.030> eighth

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:04.750 
it inside of my pot know if you can see
inside<00:05:03.440> of<00:05:03.590> there<00:05:03.710> but<00:05:04.190> it<00:05:04.250> sits<00:05:04.400> inside<00:05:04.550> of

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:04.760 
inside of there but it sits inside of

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.790 
inside of there but it sits inside of
the<00:05:04.910> pot<00:05:05.120> with<00:05:05.630> the<00:05:05.750> Trangia<00:05:06.020> stove<00:05:06.500> you<00:05:06.680> do

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 
the pot with the Trangia stove you do

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.760 
the pot with the Trangia stove you do
need<00:05:06.980> a<00:05:07.010> pot<00:05:07.280> stand<00:05:07.640> and<00:05:07.970> so<00:05:08.900> this<00:05:09.230> is<00:05:09.410> my<00:05:09.560> pot

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:09.770 
need a pot stand and so this is my pot

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.700 
need a pot stand and so this is my pot
stand<00:05:10.070> weighs<00:05:10.310> almost<00:05:10.520> nothing<00:05:11.590> inside<00:05:12.590> of

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:12.710 
stand weighs almost nothing inside of

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:14.530 
stand weighs almost nothing inside of
here<00:05:12.860> I<00:05:12.890> have<00:05:12.950> some<00:05:13.280> aluminum<00:05:13.790> flashing<00:05:14.150> as<00:05:14.510> a

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:14.540 
here I have some aluminum flashing as a

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:17.500 
here I have some aluminum flashing as a
windscreen<00:05:15.220> this<00:05:16.220> again<00:05:16.610> is<00:05:16.760> extremely

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:17.510 
windscreen this again is extremely

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:19.900 
windscreen this again is extremely
lightweight<00:05:17.810> and<00:05:18.260> this<00:05:19.070> is<00:05:19.130> useful<00:05:19.400> it<00:05:19.730> goes

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:19.910 
lightweight and this is useful it goes

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:23.020 
lightweight and this is useful it goes
around<00:05:20.240> the<00:05:20.570> hardware<00:05:21.260> cloth<00:05:21.620> pot<00:05:21.950> stand<00:05:22.310> to

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:23.030 
around the hardware cloth pot stand to

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.630 
around the hardware cloth pot stand to
act<00:05:23.330> as<00:05:23.540> a<00:05:23.570> windscreen<00:05:24.080> I<00:05:24.530> have<00:05:25.160> some<00:05:25.400> holes

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:25.640 
act as a windscreen I have some holes

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.980 
act as a windscreen I have some holes
that<00:05:25.880> I<00:05:25.910> punched<00:05:26.720> out<00:05:26.870> on<00:05:27.200> the<00:05:27.410> bottom<00:05:27.740> as<00:05:27.890> as

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:28.990 
that I punched out on the bottom as as

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:31.480 
that I punched out on the bottom as as
just<00:05:29.990> wind<00:05:30.170> holds<00:05:30.560> some<00:05:30.770> breather<00:05:31.220> holes

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:31.490 
just wind holds some breather holes

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:33.010 
just wind holds some breather holes
basically<00:05:32.000> so<00:05:32.180> your<00:05:32.300> stove<00:05:32.540> will<00:05:32.690> still<00:05:32.870> get

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:33.020 
basically so your stove will still get

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:35.800 
basically so your stove will still get
air<00:05:33.410> flow<00:05:34.070> but<00:05:34.310> not<00:05:35.030> enough<00:05:35.270> to<00:05:35.390> where<00:05:35.420> to<00:05:35.630> put

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:35.810 
air flow but not enough to where to put

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:37.750 
air flow but not enough to where to put
it<00:05:35.840> out<00:05:36.080> so<00:05:36.350> again<00:05:37.160> that's<00:05:37.460> really

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:37.760 
it out so again that's really

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.790 
it out so again that's really
lightweight<00:05:37.970> that<00:05:38.330> just<00:05:38.570> goes<00:05:38.780> inside<00:05:39.560> of<00:05:39.680> my

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:39.800 
lightweight that just goes inside of my

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:43.390 
lightweight that just goes inside of my
pot<00:05:40.070> and<00:05:41.030> then<00:05:41.780> I<00:05:41.870> just<00:05:42.050> have<00:05:42.200> kind<00:05:42.470> of<00:05:42.560> a<00:05:42.680> vapor

barrier that's use not vapor barrier but

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:47.890 
barrier that's use not vapor barrier but
a<00:05:46.280> barrier<00:05:46.790> between<00:05:46.940> the<00:05:47.120> maybe<00:05:47.540> the<00:05:47.690> cold

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:47.900 
a barrier between the maybe the cold

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.530 
a barrier between the maybe the cold

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:56.060 
can you can kind of prime it although

think it's between sixteen and seventeen
ounces<00:06:27.380> which<00:06:28.000> again<00:06:29.000> it's<00:06:29.210> not<00:06:29.390> light<00:06:29.660> it's

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:29.900 
ounces which again it's not light it's

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:31.180 
ounces which again it's not light it's
not<00:06:30.020> ultra<00:06:30.380> light<00:06:30.560> or<00:06:30.710> anything<00:06:30.920> like<00:06:31.130> that

not ultra light or anything like that
but<00:06:31.490> it's<00:06:31.610> still<00:06:31.760> considered<00:06:32.300> lightweight<00:06:32.690> I

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:32.900 
but it's still considered lightweight I

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:34.659
