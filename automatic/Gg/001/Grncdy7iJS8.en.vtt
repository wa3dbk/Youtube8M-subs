00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.429
 photoshop can be beautifully styled 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.440
 portrait so let's get started 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:14.880

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:16.949

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.140
 evict eye color if on your 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.590
 portrait and so too light eyes 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.410
 then I recommend skipping this step and 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:32.790
 So we make another copy of the control layer. 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:36.660

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:42.620

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:54.469
 brush opacity approx 14 15 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:01:03.079

00:00:54.469 --> 00:01:03.079
 go through a little eyes 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:23.950

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:42.320
 by half 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.549
 if you have a picture with lower 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.320
 resolution than me 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:50.390
