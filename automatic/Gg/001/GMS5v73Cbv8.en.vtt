00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
on screen in this regard I hope that

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.729 
on screen in this regard I hope that
borderlands<00:00:47.399> 2<00:00:47.760> is<00:00:48.059> further<00:00:48.450> refined<00:00:49.050> before

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
borderlands 2 is further refined before

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.740 
borderlands 2 is further refined before
it's<00:00:49.890> released<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.059> general<00:00:51.090> public

it's released to the general public

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.990 
it's released to the general public
because<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.530> performance<00:00:53.370> issues<00:00:53.789> are

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
because the performance issues are

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.689 
because the performance issues are
noticeable<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:54.899> I<00:00:55.440> suspect<00:00:55.710> performance

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
noticeable and I suspect performance

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.689 
noticeable and I suspect performance
will<00:00:56.969> only<00:00:57.270> degrade<00:00:57.989> further<00:00:58.620> when<00:00:59.520> there's

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
will only degrade further when there's

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.080 
will only degrade further when there's
heated<00:01:00.120> action<00:01:00.539> going<00:01:01.260> on<00:01:01.410> all<00:01:02.010> around<00:01:02.460> you

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
heated action going on all around you
