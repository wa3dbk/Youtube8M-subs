00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:04.920
 Well I came to fish and as you see 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.019
 first does not bring me the memory 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.530
 lake but so with the mobile and it is 

00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:11.870
 forming the perfect storm 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:14.599
 it gives me that in the end more than fishing 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:17.689
 I'm going to do scuba diving but good 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:21.180
 we will see how the afternoon is given if a pity 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:24.780
 what about the camcorder but good 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.880
 good guys now see you 

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.650
 well, nothing, this is also nice 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.090
 not only to teach fishing that neither 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.340
 I know if fishing is already I tell you that it is going to fall 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.200
 a 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.960
 but well at least you see a little the 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.700
 landscape I like to fish already in the 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.280
 soil made by fishing 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.470
 Well, well you already know enough 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.000
 also what I like is to be in 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.650
 contact with nature since everything 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.080
 I enjoy this almost more than fishing 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.699
 because probably then maybe not 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.489
 I caught absolutely nothing I offer a 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:54.620
 small but good to be a day between 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.239
 daily on a Wednesday then be in the 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.520
 sierra de madrid enjoy this 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:01.190
 landscape although I know that I'm going to finish 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.870
 to the bone and I hope it does not fall 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.790
 no storm because if lightning strikes 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.860
 well that being with a fiber cane 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.710
 carbon, it's like having a lightning rod 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.869
 in your hand it can be pretty funny 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.790
 come on is not recommended when you should 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:16.780
 be fishing if there are storms and 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:20.060
 storm because more or less you would not care 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.500
 so nothing will already reaching the site 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.700
 pity is going to be that I do not know then how am I going to 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.890
 record the captures 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.930
 I imagine that I will record once 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.390
 have in hand because I can not be 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.130
 with the mobile and picking up in fact 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.530
 I can barely be driving almost 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.119
 I leave the road will harvest is a 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.160
 little the landscape that maybe some 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:38.600
 it sounds to them because he came here 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.369
 ever 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.310
 that's what I tell you why that's why 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:45.350
 setting the perfect storm already 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.619
 we will see then what happens then nothing 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:51.140
 we keep on walking good guys on the 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:52.909
 miracle I found here a memory of 4 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.070
 gb I will not have to record much but 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:56.740
 good 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:59.020
 If I'm careful, I can record a lot 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:02.190
 so well let's be able to record the 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.870
 fishing day so great news 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.540
 Well, I have to cross to the other side 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.920
 from the river 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:10.869
 you to improve and scare us 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.640
 because you see it with light this does not have 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.770
 light is everything 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.720
 the week the cane is all a cojones 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.620
 tremendous and then apart the water is 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.620
 cold I go barefoot 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.290
 Well, we're not going to cross it 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.950
 you have to be very careful because you 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:31.520
 stones slip but let's go one 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:34.780
 outrageous and then apart 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:37.350
 the semen hook up 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.350
 now 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.700
 I see some bar there 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.290
 the good thing about vargas fast polarized me 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.830
 remove the brightness and I can see what 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.000
 underwater 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:50.070
 Well, I'm going to cross 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.130
 now I record good I 'm going to record it 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:55.460
 Imagine that while I fall about 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.460
 days 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.780
 by god if with the repelÃºs to me that I 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:04.050
 give the spiders this can be full of 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.050
 spiders 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.709
 is that there seems to be no that does not cover 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:11.030
 but that covers covers an egg stop 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:13.110
 record with the mobile and I will record with 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:16.050
 what's in the head 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:18.840
 look around there is a stick so 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.960
 I prefer to get wet with my head now 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.960
 we see 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.410
 pretty serious 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:34.500
 oh my god holy holy God we become 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.500
 we do it look at what 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:40.040
 my mother , we are going to do it with flip flops 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.910
 but as we are good 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.420
 improves life 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.950
 my mother 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.950
 well, nothing, I'm going to keep going 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.440
 Well, as you can see the landscape in 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:05.360
 another shore because it's pretty cool 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.860
 it is better to cross because here is not usually 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:11.270
 fish a lot of people 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.270
 ostias a corso 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:17.700
 you see it 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.710
 and in the background 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:23.490
 there's going to be a short here that has been 

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:25.319
 hustler in the bad of coming walking 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:28.009
 real writing the writing we're going to 

00:04:25.319 --> 00:04:28.009
 try zooming 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.180
 it goes 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.520
 fuck what rage 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.919
 what rage 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.900
 I'm going to cut live in silence 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:43.300
 we better catch him nobody is in this 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.520
 hillside and I do not see him anymore 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.870
 what a pity if someone wants to see you 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:51.449
 people have to give it back and 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:51.449
 palante to the video and you will be able to see it 

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:57.489
 there's a little corner of the video hop but 

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:59.840
 let's see him work are eating the 

00:04:57.489 --> 00:05:01.580
 mosquitoes and flies 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:07.220
 well from here I started to 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:09.240
 record with the head to god I'm 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.580
 nailing everything 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:14.479
 What a pity we can not see it good 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.479
 because nothing we continue 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.900
 but 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:15.800
 to me 

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:23.210
 i 

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:23.210
 d
