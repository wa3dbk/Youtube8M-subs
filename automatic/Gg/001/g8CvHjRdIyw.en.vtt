00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:04.940
 yes 

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:08.470
 hello everyone how are today in 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:10.330
 today we are going to bring you the 

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:12.370
 makeup tutorial that may be 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.440
 watching is a makeup tutorial 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:16.600
 inspired by the night inspired by how 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.430
 transform a rope day into a rope 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.619
 night something of what I speak to you in the 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.840
 club event so I wanted them 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:24.040
 bring a little bit more in depth to 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.020
 all those who did not have the 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.790
 possibility of going other ones that are 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.369
 They were left with the doubt because they saw me 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:32.169
 bit nervous here I bring you the clip 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:33.100
 of the full video as they may be 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:34.840
 seeing what I'm doing is 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.399
 darken the lash line 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.260
 upper with shadow a black shadow 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:40.390
 kill any one in particular the one 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.390
 I'm using myself in the newt palette of 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.430
 maybelline 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.910
 and I'm just applying with a 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.980
 straight cut brush and super flat 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.660
 super great for these cases to 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.280
 apply these shadows and I'm 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.770
 trying to blur as much as possible 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.870
 here is the key in the imperfection if 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.730
 you are not perfectionists in the 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.530
 makeup will understand me no need 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.720
 that they have studied, much less is 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.090
 super super easy to achieve this effect 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.100
 as vanished, also playing with a 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.690
 little bit of the imperfection and here what 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.720
 I have been doing with a brush 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:15.509
 blur and a super matte brown shade 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.130
 super clarita is almost imperceptible but 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.660
 that the difference is what I swear 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.030
 I'm doing is to mark the basin of my 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.560
 eye to give it a touch more than 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.830
 depth and that you do not see only the 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.850
 black color so it does not look so 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.039
 striking that area you could say 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.320
 because I need the areas 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:32.580
 not the super-tiny eyes and the 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.500
 I recommend to all those who have 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.420
 tiny eyes if you call the 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.979
 attention only with the outline is going 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.200
 to join the eye instead if you 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.330
 they balance the look a little to see that 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.740
 they find it much better here 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.090
 while it was being talked about they will have 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.340
 I could see that I was retouching the 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.200
 black umbrella I'm blurring the 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.060
 came to the line of lower lashes 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.680
 you know, I love to harmonize 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.170
 looks of both superiors and 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.450
 lower so that you see something like that 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.030
 definitely a little more harmonized 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.649
 a little more together I'm using the 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.750
 same shadow is blurring then with 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.100
 a cat tongue brochure 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.820
 you could calmly be 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.410
 using any other 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.600
 I'm not coming back with the brush 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.730
 Apply the brown shadow to justly 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.740
 this go harmonizing this what has 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.910
 add more brown umbrella I'll 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.670
 go through the line of my eyelashes 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.830
 lower to flush a little bit more 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.600
 The black line mascara 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.430
 girls unmissable at night if they want 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.740
 transform a look of good a look of 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.990
 night mascara on the key 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.640
 more when we wear our eyes so dark 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.310
 our lashes especially the girls 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.380
 light blondes like me get lost in all 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.070
 this darkness then is very good 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.070
 highlight the 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.250
 all the small superiors like in 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.959
 the lower this makes 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.959
 walks there will be even more 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.760
 Now what I'm doing is 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.500
 pronounce my face as you already know 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.060
 they can calmly outline it in 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.830
 the night they can do whatever they want 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.480
 but I particularly like them more 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.640
 pronounce it because I feel it gives you a 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.820
 more beautiful touch to the face one more color 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.820
 uniform 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:12.070
 and I'm doing it with this brochita 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.440
 good chubby to blend justly 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.780
 better the color I'm going to apply in my 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.660
 front on my cheekbones where you think it is 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.920
 necessary but with a brush a little bit 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.510
 more girls 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.640
 I'm going to outline my nose to 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.590
 concentrate the color better here if it would be 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.020
 more a kind of telling us that 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.030
 pronounces in the face because I want 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:33.250
 the the area of â€‹â€‹the analysis looks like 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.410
 little bit more refined now what 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.210
 I'm doing is apply enlightenment 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.630
 for the night the illuminator spending for 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:39.630
 Super good 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.150
 Now what I'm doing is applying 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:48.860
 me rigor and ready this would be the last 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.360
 step that we are going to perform for this 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.220
 makeup as you may have seen it is 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.959
 super super easy what they thought 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.580
 I liked it, we would see each other in the 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:57.670
 next video 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:57.670
 bye
