that's going to be fast it's gonna be

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.830 
that's going to be fast it's gonna be
light<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:50.940> it's<00:00:51.210> going<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:51.420> be<00:00:51.539> one<00:00:51.690> of<00:00:51.780> the

the market it uses the new SL 311 are

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.680 
the market it uses the new SL 311 are
carbon<00:00:58.559> from<00:00:58.710> specialized<00:00:59.309> so<00:01:00.090> this<00:01:00.329> frame

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
carbon from specialized so this frame

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.950 
carbon from specialized so this frame
alone<00:01:01.199> is<00:01:01.579> running<00:01:02.579> under<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:03.239> thousand<00:01:03.870> grams

alone is running under a thousand grams

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.170 
alone is running under a thousand grams
so<00:01:04.260> it's<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.470> very<00:01:04.739> lightweight<00:01:05.040> frame<00:01:05.580> you're

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
so it's a very lightweight frame you're

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.350 
so it's a very lightweight frame you're
combining<00:01:06.720> it<00:01:06.840> with<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.799> new<00:01:07.830> s-works<00:01:08.790> carbon

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360
