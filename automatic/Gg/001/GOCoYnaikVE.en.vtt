00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.189
 to like 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:29.699
 is a template that is called bmw bmw car 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:32.669
 x5 that is added in your game is very 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:35.370
 nice graphic was too much time 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.680
 really much of the time 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.989
 Well, you guys will download it there. 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.899
 link is in the description that will be the 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.059
 download template but download foje 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.489
 which is required to run the mod 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:51.210
 after that you will come in your menu 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:56.750
 start and put percentage abp data 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:01:01.730
 percentage of enter point minecraft bin 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:04.799
 imagine craft you open with the rare 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:08.040
 in this part you have located the meta folder 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.659
 Anyway, they conclude it if you do not 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.909
 have to 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.400
 You've probably deleted it but I 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:18.000
 I recommend you give a strong lpi date and 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.810
 delete again the mod on the rod if 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:28.369

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:32.009

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:35.490
 you take everything you have in it but 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:39.060
 control it for whoever wants to control and 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:47.460
 already selects everything controlled whoever 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:50.369
 And you throw everything over here, they're already okay. Okay. 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.040
 everything has passed now they can close the 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.920
 ford and can close minecraft when 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.070
 this is where I had applied in 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.829
 You minecraft will re - engage 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.560
 a folder called good mode if you do not 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.799
 you have this template folder you can create 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.929
 only you create a new folder that even 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:13.040
 death is just like that and you are going 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:17.359

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:19.280

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.359
 You minecraft when you enter will 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.700
 see that it is written molds 

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:33.109
 This is dangerous ford you click 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:36.650
 find it here the modcom and 

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:41.359
 stay and give it a go now let's create a 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:43.099
 any world here creative even then 

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:48.129

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:57.889
 miscellaneous below everything and it's here 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:03:01.370
 credicard you pick up and put it looks 

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:03.950
 what of the time people compare with by 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.629
 example the block on the side you see our 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:09.200
 You can not compare it. 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:12.019
 It is very clear the time can be half 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.060
 the graphic is very good but it is 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:15.980
 because of my computer is the 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.680
 computer is not good, the graph is not 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:24.169
 maximum and tals 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:26.209
 Okay, now you talk about our order. 

00:03:24.169 --> 00:03:30.940
 see if you come here in the 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:37.220
 control options will be here 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:39.049
 business about cars can put to 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:42.579
 accelerate anyone had to top 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:47.239
 from breka down 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:49.459
 I'll put there to turn left 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:54.919
 right and such 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:59.389
 one ok and can see the whole car first 

00:03:54.919 --> 00:04:03.109
 right from the top of the hour there is the sunroof over there 

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:04.519
 this is only closed to the lighthouse is also the 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:06.709
 hour right 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:09.530
 the wheel of the very nice man 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:13.310
 Nice right click on it. 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:15.889
 can get those red scratches 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.199
 white is the same computer but only 

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:20.150
 here in the corner has an accelerator but 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:25.130
 also the cattle is a symbol of bmw 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:27.199
 cute little radio has the deal for 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:31.229
 put on the belt 

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:34.949
 davies and I'm going to go by unintentionally I wanted 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:36.479
 do it then when you're here 

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:39.120
 inside the car right? 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:43.289
 you can for example come left 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:45.629
 Right here at the time complicates the line 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:48.479
 camera will change here is that I am a 

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:49.889
 Very bad place to split has no 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:51.449
 space for nothing 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:53.789
 You can see that this time I go to a 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:55.979
 place more flat ready beauty put 

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:58.409
 here in a flat place, right? 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:01.919
 Let's see what we're going to see again. 

00:04:58.409 --> 00:05:09.659
 Change camera here for example to 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:12.720
 Here the commendation here is white but the 

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:15.360
 accelerator type because of the graphics 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:20.159
 literally then gives accelerated process 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:22.409
 of turning each rectal nÃ© 

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:25.259
 So, guys, I was kind of confused. 

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:28.289
 because here I left in the raid that is the 

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:31.800
 the highest quality is not 

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:35.940
 and here in the settings the graph 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:38.250
 beautiful and animations all connected then I 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:42.150
 I do not know if the computer actually 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:45.180
 your way is in tacumbu be the 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:48.380
 Alstom but I sent it very interesting 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.380
 to stay too line 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:53.789
 well I found it very cool 

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:56.940
 so I hope you have enjoyed it 

00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:58.469
 until next time, and it's been years since I 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.860
 I really liked it, right. 

00:05:58.469 --> 00:06:00.860
 thanks
