episode 1 at least very briefly and I

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.740 
episode 1 at least very briefly and I
said<00:00:14.460> in<00:00:14.580> the<00:00:14.639> video<00:00:14.759> that<00:00:15.210> it<00:00:15.480> would<00:00:15.630> actually

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
said in the video that it would actually

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.349 
said in the video that it would actually
most<00:00:16.590> likely<00:00:16.920> be<00:00:17.070> after<00:00:17.490> battle<00:00:17.940> of<00:00:18.029> gods<00:00:18.180> and

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
most likely be after battle of gods and

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.090 
most likely be after battle of gods and
resurrection<00:00:18.720> F<00:00:19.020> only<00:00:19.350> because<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.770> article

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
resurrection F only because the article

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.769 
resurrection F only because the article
actually<00:00:20.220> said<00:00:20.699> that<00:00:20.730> this<00:00:21.060> will<00:00:21.390> contain

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
actually said that this will contain

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.840 
actually said that this will contain
plot<00:00:22.109> elements<00:00:22.560> from<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:23.160> movies<00:00:23.519> battle<00:00:23.760> of

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
plot elements from the movies battle of

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.580 
plot elements from the movies battle of
gods<00:00:24.000> and<00:00:24.300> resurrection<00:00:24.660> F<00:00:24.869> so<00:00:25.080> kind<00:00:25.380> of<00:00:25.470> made

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
gods and resurrection F so kind of made

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.410 
gods and resurrection F so kind of made
it<00:00:25.680> seem<00:00:25.920> like<00:00:25.949> Super<00:00:26.609> Saiyan<00:00:26.820> God<00:00:27.029> would<00:00:27.300> be

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
it seem like Super Saiyan God would be

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.939 
it seem like Super Saiyan God would be
something<00:00:27.630> that<00:00:27.779> would<00:00:27.900> matter<00:00:28.170> or<00:00:28.529> anything

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
something that would matter or anything

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.370 
something that would matter or anything
along<00:00:29.010> those<00:00:29.250> lines<00:00:29.550> but<00:00:29.760> as<00:00:30.449> far<00:00:30.810> as<00:00:30.869> we<00:00:31.140> see

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
along those lines but as far as we see

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.290 
along those lines but as far as we see
now<00:00:31.560> it<00:00:31.769> seems<00:00:32.009> like<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.399> actual<00:00:32.700> series<00:00:33.059> will

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
now it seems like the actual series will

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.959 
now it seems like the actual series will
be<00:00:33.570> before<00:00:34.020> battle<00:00:34.829> of<00:00:34.950> God<00:00:35.130> which<00:00:35.460> means<00:00:35.700> that

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
be before battle of God which means that

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.639 
be before battle of God which means that
this<00:00:36.120> is<00:00:36.300> going<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:36.480> kind<00:00:36.719> of<00:00:36.809> ignore<00:00:37.110> what

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
this is going to kind of ignore what

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.260 
this is going to kind of ignore what
battle<00:00:37.980> of<00:00:38.070> gods<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:38.460> resurrection<00:00:38.820> have<00:00:39.059> had

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
battle of gods and resurrection have had

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.330 
battle of gods and resurrection have had
now<00:00:39.719> obviously<00:00:40.200> as<00:00:40.320> you<00:00:40.530> see<00:00:40.770> on<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:41.100> cover

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
now obviously as you see on the cover

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.190 
now obviously as you see on the cover
art<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:41.640> everything<00:00:42.030> like<00:00:42.149> that<00:00:42.210> Bierce<00:00:42.899> is

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
art and everything like that Bierce is

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.540 
art and everything like that Bierce is
involved<00:00:43.680> in<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.829> show<00:00:44.010> very<00:00:44.040> heavily

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
involved in the show very heavily

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.310 
involved in the show very heavily
actually<00:00:44.940> was<00:00:45.090> also<00:00:45.300> in<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.420> preview<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:45.989> he

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
actually was also in the preview and he

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.440 
actually was also in the preview and he
will<00:00:46.559> be<00:00:46.739> him<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:47.489> we<00:00:47.670> shall<00:00:47.850> both<00:00:48.000> heavily<00:00:48.300> be

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
will be him and we shall both heavily be

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.720 
will be him and we shall both heavily be
involved<00:00:48.750> in<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.899> show<00:00:49.079> although<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:50.160> events

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
involved in the show although the events

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.069 
involved in the show although the events
from<00:00:50.850> battle<00:00:51.120> of<00:00:51.210> gods<00:00:51.329> apparently<00:00:51.780> have<00:00:51.899> not

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
from battle of gods apparently have not

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.049 
from battle of gods apparently have not
happened<00:00:52.260> yet<00:00:52.500> so<00:00:52.860> earlier<00:00:53.399> this<00:00:53.550> morning<00:00:53.969> it

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
happened yet so earlier this morning it

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.790 
happened yet so earlier this morning it
seems<00:00:54.300> like<00:00:54.510> somebody<00:00:54.870> actually<00:00:55.079> leaked<00:00:55.590> the

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
seems like somebody actually leaked the

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.560 
seems like somebody actually leaked the
chapter<00:00:56.219> one<00:00:56.370> summary<00:00:56.850> completely<00:00:57.420> for

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
chapter one summary completely for

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.029 
chapter one summary completely for
Dragon<00:00:57.870> Ball<00:00:58.020> super<00:00:58.050> that's<00:00:58.800> gonna<00:00:58.890> be

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
Dragon Ball super that's gonna be

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.340 
Dragon Ball super that's gonna be
releasing<00:00:59.460> about<00:00:59.550> a<00:00:59.699> day<00:01:00.059> or<00:01:00.090> two<00:01:00.390> in<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:01.020> nuvi

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
releasing about a day or two in the nuvi

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.950 
releasing about a day or two in the nuvi
jump<00:01:01.649> so<00:01:02.160> it<00:01:02.520> seems<00:01:02.910> like<00:01:03.210> beerus<00:01:03.510> in<00:01:03.750> this

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
jump so it seems like beerus in this

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.350 
jump so it seems like beerus in this
episode<00:01:04.350> did<00:01:04.710> not<00:01:04.890> know<00:01:05.100> who<00:01:05.280> goku<00:01:05.670> was<00:01:05.909> which

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
episode did not know who goku was which

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.300 
episode did not know who goku was which
would<00:01:06.570> mean<00:01:06.780> that<00:01:06.840> this<00:01:07.290> is<00:01:07.470> actually<00:01:07.650> before

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
would mean that this is actually before

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.039 
would mean that this is actually before
battle<00:01:08.640> of<00:01:08.760> gods<00:01:08.970> it<00:01:09.420> would<00:01:09.510> also<00:01:09.630> explain<00:01:09.750> why

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
battle of gods it would also explain why

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.510 
battle of gods it would also explain why
everybody<00:01:10.650> here<00:01:10.920> actually<00:01:11.070> has<00:01:11.340> their

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
everybody here actually has their

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.850 
everybody here actually has their
outfits<00:01:11.909> that<00:01:11.970> they<00:01:12.150> had<00:01:12.360> ripe<00:01:12.990> in<00:01:13.260> battle<00:01:13.740> of

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
outfits that they had ripe in battle of

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.350 
outfits that they had ripe in battle of
gods<00:01:14.040> so<00:01:14.310> that<00:01:14.430> means<00:01:14.610> everybody<00:01:14.880> here<00:01:15.330> I

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
gods so that means everybody here I

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.390 
gods so that means everybody here I
guess<00:01:15.570> has<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:16.020> same<00:01:16.380> clothing<00:01:16.770> because<00:01:17.220> of

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
guess has the same clothing because of

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.030 
guess has the same clothing because of
that<00:01:17.549> reason<00:01:17.580> so<00:01:18.150> this<00:01:18.780> means<00:01:19.049> that<00:01:19.229> a<00:01:19.560> lot<00:01:19.920> of

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
that reason so this means that a lot of

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.350 
that reason so this means that a lot of
things<00:01:20.159> are<00:01:20.310> going<00:01:20.430> to<00:01:20.490> be<00:01:20.520> probably<00:01:20.970> withheld

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
things are going to be probably withheld

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.120 
things are going to be probably withheld
away<00:01:21.630> from<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.930> show<00:01:22.140> so<00:01:22.530> obviously<00:01:22.950> this

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
away from the show so obviously this

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.920 
away from the show so obviously this
means<00:01:23.280> that<00:01:23.400> pan<00:01:23.729> is<00:01:23.909> not<00:01:24.030> gonna<00:01:24.240> be<00:01:24.479> conceived

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
means that pan is not gonna be conceived

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.899 
means that pan is not gonna be conceived
yet<00:01:25.110> so<00:01:25.320> she's<00:01:25.350> in<00:01:25.619> Modell's<00:01:26.460> gonna<00:01:26.670> still<00:01:26.880> be

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
yet so she's in Modell's gonna still be

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.490 
yet so she's in Modell's gonna still be
pregnant<00:01:27.180> she's<00:01:27.540> not<00:01:27.689> actually<00:01:27.930> had<00:01:28.259> pan

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
Bulma chichi Crillon all of them are the

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.160 
Bulma chichi Crillon all of them are the
same<00:01:41.119> design<00:01:42.119> that<00:01:42.299> they<00:01:42.420> were<00:01:42.479> in<00:01:42.750> battle<00:01:43.049> of

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
same design that they were in battle of

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.469 
same design that they were in battle of
gods<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:43.740> somehow<00:01:44.340> this<00:01:44.880> plot<00:01:45.240> doesn't

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
gods and somehow this plot doesn't

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:46.760 
gods and somehow this plot doesn't
really<00:01:45.689> seem<00:01:45.930> like<00:01:45.990> it<00:01:46.200> could<00:01:46.229> work<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.649> me

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
really seem like it could work to me

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.710 
really seem like it could work to me
only<00:01:47.009> because<00:01:47.250> it<00:01:47.640> seems<00:01:47.909> like<00:01:48.030> there's<00:01:48.570> gonna

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
only because it seems like there's gonna

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.690 
only because it seems like there's gonna
be<00:01:48.930> a<00:01:48.960> problem<00:01:49.259> if<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.860> producer<00:01:50.369> of<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.670> show

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
be a problem if the producer of the show

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.850 
be a problem if the producer of the show
actually<00:01:51.119> said<00:01:51.570> in<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:52.290> press<00:01:52.470> release<00:01:52.829> that

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
actually said in the press release that

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.950 
actually said in the press release that
there's<00:01:53.579> going<00:01:53.790> to<00:01:53.909> be<00:01:53.939> a<00:01:54.030> character<00:01:54.420> who<00:01:54.810> is<00:01:54.840> a

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
there's going to be a character who is a

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.600 
there's going to be a character who is a
villain<00:01:55.380> who's<00:01:55.560> stronger<00:01:55.979> than<00:01:56.280> golden

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
villain who's stronger than golden

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.069 
villain who's stronger than golden
Frieza<00:01:56.850> now<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.360> only<00:01:57.509> reason<00:01:57.840> that<00:01:57.869> this

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
Frieza now the only reason that this

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.840 
Frieza now the only reason that this
actually<00:01:58.530> makes<00:01:58.680> me<00:01:58.799> scratch<00:01:59.280> my<00:01:59.490> head<00:01:59.520> is

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
actually makes me scratch my head is

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.389 
actually makes me scratch my head is
only<00:02:00.090> because<00:02:00.560> golden<00:02:01.560> Frieza<00:02:01.770> is<00:02:02.009> actually

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
only because golden Frieza is actually

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.190 
only because golden Frieza is actually
stronger<00:02:02.700> than<00:02:03.000> both<00:02:03.360> Super<00:02:03.840> Saiyan<00:02:04.110> God

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
stronger than both Super Saiyan God

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.649 
stronger than both Super Saiyan God
Super<00:02:04.259> Saiyan<00:02:04.770> Goku<00:02:05.250> and<00:02:05.460> Vegeta<00:02:05.729> separately

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
Super Saiyan Goku and Vegeta separately

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.630 
Super Saiyan Goku and Vegeta separately
so<00:02:06.899> obviously<00:02:07.409> the<00:02:07.619> two<00:02:07.770> together<00:02:07.920> were<00:02:08.580> able

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
so obviously the two together were able

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.700 
so obviously the two together were able
to<00:02:09.090> defeat<00:02:09.239> golden<00:02:09.840> Frieza<00:02:10.050> but

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
to defeat golden Frieza but

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.080 
to defeat golden Frieza but
up<00:02:11.740> early<00:02:11.890> golden<00:02:12.370> freezes<00:02:12.760> actually

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
up early golden freezes actually

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.820 
up early golden freezes actually
stronger<00:02:13.300> than<00:02:13.480> both<00:02:13.720> of<00:02:13.780> them<00:02:13.960> which<00:02:14.500> means

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
stronger than both of them which means

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.500 
stronger than both of them which means
that<00:02:15.100> how<00:02:15.610> are<00:02:15.850> they<00:02:15.970> going<00:02:16.120> to<00:02:16.210> actually<00:02:16.330> be

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
that how are they going to actually be

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.060 
that how are they going to actually be
able<00:02:16.540> to<00:02:16.690> stand<00:02:16.870> up<00:02:17.050> to<00:02:17.080> them<00:02:17.230> I<00:02:17.440> mean<00:02:17.770> let's<00:02:17.980> be

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
able to stand up to them I mean let's be

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:19.460 
able to stand up to them I mean let's be
honest<00:02:18.460> here<00:02:18.610> Super<00:02:18.970> Saiyan<00:02:19.180> God<00:02:19.390> Super

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.690 
honest here Super Saiyan God Super
Saiyan<00:02:20.470> is<00:02:20.710> something<00:02:21.250> that<00:02:21.370> is<00:02:21.580> extremely

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
Saiyan is something that is extremely

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.060 
Saiyan is something that is extremely
powerful<00:02:22.240> and<00:02:22.750> at<00:02:23.110> least<00:02:23.260> it<00:02:23.530> made<00:02:23.740> it<00:02:23.860> seem

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
powerful and at least it made it seem

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.160 
powerful and at least it made it seem
like<00:02:24.310> it's<00:02:24.580> an<00:02:24.730> extreme<00:02:25.150> power<00:02:25.420> boost<00:02:25.720> and<00:02:25.900> it

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
like it's an extreme power boost and it

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.900 
like it's an extreme power boost and it
took<00:02:26.320> him<00:02:26.410> entire<00:02:26.710> what<00:02:27.010> was<00:02:27.190> the<00:02:27.340> whole<00:02:27.520> year

of<00:02:28.120> training<00:02:28.510> with<00:02:28.780> weeks<00:02:29.020> before<00:02:29.590> they<00:02:29.710> could

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
of training with weeks before they could

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.740 
of training with weeks before they could
actually<00:02:30.010> gain<00:02:30.400> this<00:02:30.550> form<00:02:30.880> which<00:02:31.270> means<00:02:31.630> that

next time that could be after
resurrection<00:02:54.400> have<00:02:54.550> but<00:02:54.910> at<00:02:55.000> the<00:02:55.060> current

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
resurrection have but at the current

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.090 
resurrection have but at the current
moment<00:02:55.390> it<00:02:55.900> seems<00:02:56.110> like<00:02:56.290> the<00:02:56.440> entire<00:02:56.740> series

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
moment it seems like the entire series

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.130 
moment it seems like the entire series
or<00:02:57.340> at<00:02:57.430> least<00:02:57.610> the<00:02:57.970> first<00:02:58.210> saga<00:02:58.510> will<00:02:58.900> be

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
or at least the first saga will be

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.110 
or at least the first saga will be
before<00:02:59.350> battle<00:03:00.010> of<00:03:00.100> gods<00:03:00.280> so<00:03:00.790> that's<00:03:00.940> going<00:03:01.060> to

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
before battle of gods so that's going to

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.970 
before battle of gods so that's going to
bring<00:03:01.540> up<00:03:01.630> a<00:03:01.780> lot<00:03:02.050> of<00:03:02.200> plot<00:03:02.350> holes<00:03:02.410> in<00:03:02.710> a<00:03:02.800> lot<00:03:02.950> of

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
bring up a lot of plot holes in a lot of

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.190 
bring up a lot of plot holes in a lot of
inconsistencies<00:03:03.390> with<00:03:04.390> the<00:03:04.540> characters<00:03:04.990> and

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
inconsistencies with the characters and

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.260 
inconsistencies with the characters and
that's<00:03:05.350> gonna<00:03:05.530> really<00:03:06.040> annoy<00:03:06.730> a<00:03:06.760> lot<00:03:07.150> of

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270 
that's gonna really annoy a lot of

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:08.610 
that's gonna really annoy a lot of
people<00:03:07.600> I<00:03:07.780> personally<00:03:08.050> don't<00:03:08.230> know<00:03:08.380> why<00:03:08.590> I

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
people I personally don't know why I

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.170 
people I personally don't know why I
carry<00:03:08.950> Toriyama<00:03:09.250> decided<00:03:09.640> to<00:03:09.730> do<00:03:09.880> this<00:03:10.030> i

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
carry Toriyama decided to do this i

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.370 
carry Toriyama decided to do this i
don't<00:03:10.330> know<00:03:10.390> this<00:03:10.450> is<00:03:10.690> just<00:03:10.810> one<00:03:11.170> of<00:03:11.200> these

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
don't know this is just one of these

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.110 
don't know this is just one of these
things<00:03:11.620> where<00:03:11.770> he's<00:03:11.980> trying<00:03:12.160> to<00:03:12.250> do<00:03:12.370> the<00:03:12.820> exact

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
things where he's trying to do the exact

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.340 
things where he's trying to do the exact
opposite<00:03:13.420> of<00:03:13.480> what<00:03:13.570> people<00:03:13.900> are<00:03:14.020> trying<00:03:14.230> to

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
opposite of what people are trying to

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:15.690 
opposite of what people are trying to
think<00:03:14.620> he's<00:03:14.740> gonna<00:03:14.860> do<00:03:15.100> like<00:03:15.340> because

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
think he's gonna do like because

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:16.710 
think he's gonna do like because
everybody<00:03:16.060> thought<00:03:16.210> he<00:03:16.330> was<00:03:16.420> going<00:03:16.510> to<00:03:16.570> do

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
everybody thought he was going to do

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.270 
everybody thought he was going to do
something<00:03:16.750> at<00:03:17.050> the<00:03:17.080> resurrection<00:03:17.350> F<00:03:17.680> mainly

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
something at the resurrection F mainly

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.760 
something at the resurrection F mainly
because<00:03:18.340> you<00:03:18.640> know<00:03:18.790> it's<00:03:19.510> actually<00:03:19.750> like<00:03:20.170> one

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:20.770 
because you know it's actually like one

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:22.140 
because you know it's actually like one
of<00:03:20.860> the<00:03:20.950> biggest<00:03:21.280> movies<00:03:21.730> that's<00:03:21.880> going<00:03:22.000> to<00:03:22.060> be

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
of the biggest movies that's going to be

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.700 
of the biggest movies that's going to be
out<00:03:22.270> right<00:03:22.480> now<00:03:22.660> because<00:03:22.960> you<00:03:23.050> know<00:03:23.140> Japan<00:03:23.350> it

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:23.710 
out right now because you know Japan it

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:25.650 
out right now because you know Japan it
really<00:03:24.280> succeeded<00:03:24.790> and<00:03:24.940> all<00:03:25.300> that<00:03:25.390> stuff<00:03:25.480> in

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
really succeeded and all that stuff in

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.420 
really succeeded and all that stuff in
battle<00:03:25.870> of<00:03:25.930> gods<00:03:26.110> also<00:03:26.500> succeeded<00:03:26.980> very<00:03:27.100> well

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
battle of gods also succeeded very well

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.180 
battle of gods also succeeded very well
in<00:03:27.670> Japan<00:03:27.970> and<00:03:28.180> in<00:03:28.480> the<00:03:28.570> US<00:03:28.870> and<00:03:29.050> I<00:03:29.560> guess<00:03:29.950> that

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
in Japan and in the US and I guess that

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:31.380 
in Japan and in the US and I guess that
he<00:03:30.280> just<00:03:30.520> decided<00:03:30.820> that<00:03:30.940> he's<00:03:31.090> going<00:03:31.270> to

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
he just decided that he's going to

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.420 
he just decided that he's going to
hopefully<00:03:31.990> not<00:03:32.380> erase<00:03:32.710> them<00:03:32.920> from<00:03:32.950> Canon

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
hopefully not erase them from Canon

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:34.590 
hopefully not erase them from Canon
because<00:03:33.640> you<00:03:33.730> know<00:03:33.850> they<00:03:34.060> are<00:03:34.210> supposed<00:03:34.450> to<00:03:34.480> be

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
because you know they are supposed to be

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.690 
because you know they are supposed to be
cannon<00:03:34.930> movies<00:03:35.290> I<00:03:35.440> guess<00:03:36.220> that<00:03:36.400> he's<00:03:36.490> just

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
cannon movies I guess that he's just

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.040 
cannon movies I guess that he's just
gonna<00:03:36.850> like<00:03:37.090> ignore<00:03:37.480> them<00:03:37.630> for<00:03:37.780> the<00:03:37.840> current

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.050 
gonna like ignore them for the current

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:39.780 
gonna like ignore them for the current
time<00:03:38.320> being<00:03:38.620> for<00:03:39.070> all<00:03:39.130> we<00:03:39.160> know<00:03:39.310> as<00:03:39.640> I<00:03:39.760> said

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
time being for all we know as I said

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.000 
time being for all we know as I said
before<00:03:39.940> he<00:03:40.330> could<00:03:40.540> just<00:03:40.900> switch<00:03:41.140> to<00:03:41.380> where<00:03:41.770> the

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
before he could just switch to where the

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.890 
before he could just switch to where the
next<00:03:42.280> saga<00:03:42.460> is<00:03:42.760> after<00:03:43.180> battle<00:03:43.450> of<00:03:43.540> gods<00:03:43.690> and

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
next saga is after battle of gods and

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.060 
next saga is after battle of gods and
the<00:03:43.990> next<00:03:44.290> time<00:03:44.410> after<00:03:44.620> that<00:03:44.740> is<00:03:44.920> after

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:45.070 
the next time after that is after

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:46.500 
the next time after that is after
resurrection<00:03:45.550> F<00:03:45.670> but<00:03:46.000> at<00:03:46.090> the<00:03:46.150> current<00:03:46.270> moment

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
resurrection F but at the current moment

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.000 
resurrection F but at the current moment
we<00:03:46.840> all<00:03:47.020> we<00:03:47.170> know<00:03:47.320> is<00:03:47.470> that<00:03:47.590> this<00:03:47.710> is<00:03:47.770> actually

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
we all we know is that this is actually

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.310 
we all we know is that this is actually
before<00:03:48.850> battle<00:03:49.150> of<00:03:49.240> gods<00:03:49.420> so<00:03:49.990> what<00:03:50.140> does<00:03:50.200> this

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:50.320 
before battle of gods so what does this

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:51.990 
before battle of gods so what does this
mean<00:03:50.500> for<00:03:50.740> Dragon<00:03:51.040> Ball<00:03:51.190> super<00:03:51.220> in<00:03:51.640> general

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
mean for Dragon Ball super in general

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.130 
mean for Dragon Ball super in general
well<00:03:52.150> this<00:03:52.330> means<00:03:52.570> that<00:03:52.630> there's<00:03:52.810> gonna<00:03:52.900> be<00:03:53.110> a

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.140 
well this means that there's gonna be a

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:54.720 
well this means that there's gonna be a
lot<00:03:53.320> more<00:03:53.380> different<00:03:53.920> things<00:03:54.070> happening<00:03:54.490> Goku

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
lot more different things happening Goku

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:55.920 
lot more different things happening Goku
is<00:03:54.760> probably<00:03:55.000> still<00:03:55.150> gonna<00:03:55.270> be<00:03:55.390> using<00:03:55.690> super

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
is probably still gonna be using super

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.840 
is probably still gonna be using super
saiyan<00:03:56.110> 3<00:03:56.200> or<00:03:56.740> at<00:03:56.830> least<00:03:56.860> he<00:03:57.040> may<00:03:57.370> be<00:03:57.430> well<00:03:57.730> I'm

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.850 
saiyan 3 or at least he may be well I'm

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:59.460 
saiyan 3 or at least he may be well I'm
not<00:03:57.970> really<00:03:58.120> sure<00:03:58.210> actually<00:03:58.600> since<00:03:59.230> akira

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
not really sure actually since akira

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.290 
not really sure actually since akira
toriyama<00:03:59.710> did<00:04:00.010> say<00:04:00.220> after<00:04:00.760> battle<00:04:01.030> of<00:04:01.120> gods

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:01.300 
toriyama did say after battle of gods

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.390 
toriyama did say after battle of gods
came<00:04:01.510> out<00:04:01.660> that<00:04:01.840> he<00:04:01.870> did<00:04:02.230> not<00:04:02.260> want<00:04:02.590> to<00:04:02.710> use<00:04:02.980> so

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
came out that he did not want to use so

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.650 
came out that he did not want to use so
we're<00:04:03.550> saying<00:04:03.700> three<00:04:04.000> or<00:04:04.150> two<00:04:04.300> because<00:04:04.480> he

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
we're saying three or two because he

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.180 
we're saying three or two because he
thought<00:04:04.840> it<00:04:04.900> would<00:04:05.140> be<00:04:05.320> irrelevant<00:04:05.800> in

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
thought it would be irrelevant in

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.340 
thought it would be irrelevant in
comparison<00:04:06.940> super<00:04:07.240> saiyan<00:04:07.480> god<00:04:07.660> but<00:04:08.170> at<00:04:08.260> this

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:08.350 
comparison super saiyan god but at this

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:09.930 
comparison super saiyan god but at this
point<00:04:08.560> since<00:04:08.800> Super<00:04:09.070> Saiyan<00:04:09.250> God<00:04:09.400> seems<00:04:09.760> like

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
point since Super Saiyan God seems like

it<00:04:10.090> may<00:04:10.300> not<00:04:10.450> be<00:04:10.510> used<00:04:10.810> incredibly<00:04:11.650> I<00:04:11.920> guess

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
it may not be used incredibly I guess

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.640 
it may not be used incredibly I guess
that<00:04:12.790> now<00:04:13.150> he<00:04:13.210> may<00:04:13.480> use<00:04:13.690> it<00:04:13.810> again<00:04:14.020> either<00:04:14.290> that

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
that now he may use it again either that

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:15.839 
that now he may use it again either that

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:15.849 
oreck airtran was going to try and

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:17.819 
oreck airtran was going to try and

introduce super saiyan got another way

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:19.259 
introduce super saiyan got another way
which<00:04:18.100> would<00:04:18.430> not<00:04:18.669> really<00:04:18.820> make<00:04:19.030> sense

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:19.269 
which would not really make sense

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:21.599 
which would not really make sense
because<00:04:19.660> if<00:04:19.870> give<00:04:20.440> battle<00:04:20.979> of<00:04:21.130> gods<00:04:21.250> still

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
because if give battle of gods still

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:24.090 
because if give battle of gods still

after resurrection F I kind of was

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:39.900 
after resurrection F I kind of was

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.430 
so I really kind of clash with what I
was<00:05:00.340> trying<00:05:00.550> to<00:05:00.580> say<00:05:00.820> and<00:05:01.050> everybody<00:05:02.050> realized

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:02.440 
was trying to say and everybody realized

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:03.810 
was trying to say and everybody realized
that<00:05:02.560> it<00:05:02.650> was<00:05:02.740> actually<00:05:02.889> before<00:05:03.400> battle<00:05:03.699> of

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
that it was actually before battle of

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.640
