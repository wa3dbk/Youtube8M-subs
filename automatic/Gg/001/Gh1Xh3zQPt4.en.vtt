00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:36.540 
believe there's aletta then there's one

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:37.760 
believe there's aletta then there's one
better<00:05:36.780> than<00:05:36.930> that<00:05:37.110> there's<00:05:37.380> one<00:05:37.500> worse<00:05:37.740> than

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:37.770 
better than that there's one worse than

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:39.800 
better than that there's one worse than
that<00:05:38.100> I'm<00:05:38.250> pretty<00:05:38.310> sure<00:05:38.730> which<00:05:39.390> is<00:05:39.510> really

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:39.810 
that I'm pretty sure which is really

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:41.420 
that I'm pretty sure which is really
really<00:05:39.990> cool<00:05:40.320> I<00:05:40.560> like<00:05:40.770> the<00:05:40.890> fact<00:05:41.040> that<00:05:41.220> you're
