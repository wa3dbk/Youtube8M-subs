a non functional phaser cast off an
original<00:00:20.810> now<00:00:21.859> you<00:00:22.859> can<00:00:23.010> see<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.279> size<00:00:23.490> a

what you're buying now all I received
when<00:00:29.250> I<00:00:29.279> bought<00:00:29.550> it<00:00:29.720> was<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:31.529> plastic<00:00:32.189> parts

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
when I bought it was the plastic parts

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.020 
when I bought it was the plastic parts
none<00:00:33.030> of<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.210> metal<00:00:33.360> was<00:00:33.600> there<00:00:33.840> none<00:00:34.469> of<00:00:34.590> it

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.030 
none of the metal was there none of it

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.110 
none of the metal was there none of it
we<00:00:36.030> took<00:00:36.270> this<00:00:36.510> went<00:00:37.350> ahead<00:00:37.579> and<00:00:38.579> put<00:00:38.820> it<00:00:38.910> back

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
we took this went ahead and put it back

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.549 
we took this went ahead and put it back
the<00:00:39.300> way<00:00:39.329> it<00:00:39.540> should<00:00:39.600> look<00:00:39.899> as<00:00:40.140> if<00:00:40.290> it<00:00:40.379> was<00:00:40.469> an

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
the way it should look as if it was an

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.959 
the way it should look as if it was an
actual<00:00:40.940> working<00:00:41.940> phaser<00:00:43.460> it<00:00:44.460> has<00:00:44.640> a<00:00:44.670> certain

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
actual working phaser it has a certain

actual working phaser it has a certain
look<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.270> it<00:00:45.570> was<00:00:46.260> called<00:00:46.530> a<00:00:46.620> pop<00:00:46.890> bottle<00:00:47.129> or

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
look to it was called a pop bottle or

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
up on the original phaser okay

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:02.709 
up on the original phaser okay
we<00:00:56.309> took<00:00:56.520> this<00:00:57.109> made<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.140> function<00:00:58.649> in<00:00:58.770> here

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:02.719

this<00:01:08.500> piece<00:01:08.799> right<00:01:09.039> here<00:01:09.100> we<00:01:09.939> got<00:01:10.149> the

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
this piece right here we got the

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.419 
this piece right here we got the
original<00:01:10.359> phaser<00:01:10.810> was<00:01:11.140> actually<00:01:11.530> engraved

00:01:12.419 --> 00:01:12.429 
original phaser was actually engraved

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:14.520 
original phaser was actually engraved
into<00:01:12.759> the<00:01:12.939> body<00:01:13.179> we<00:01:13.810> replaced<00:01:14.140> it<00:01:14.289> with<00:01:14.320> their

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
into the body we replaced it with their

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.370 
into the body we replaced it with their
own<00:01:14.679> little<00:01:15.090> heat<00:01:16.090> sink<00:01:16.509> or<00:01:16.780> whatever<00:01:17.289> you

own little heat sink or whatever you

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.679 
own little heat sink or whatever you
call<00:01:17.590> a<00:01:17.619> spur<00:01:18.009> oh<00:01:18.450> okay

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:19.689 
call a spur oh okay

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:26.370 
call a spur oh okay
push<00:01:19.990> it<00:01:20.109> forward<00:01:20.939> pops<00:01:21.939> up<00:01:24.990> this<00:01:25.990> was<00:01:26.229> the

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
push it forward pops up this was the

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.059 
push it forward pops up this was the
trigger<00:01:26.679> on<00:01:26.950> the<00:01:27.399> phasers<00:01:28.229> in<00:01:29.229> Dennis<00:01:29.890> right

00:01:30.059 --> 00:01:30.069

here cut in here it's clear through here
like<00:01:37.090> I<00:01:37.179> said<00:01:37.359> this<00:01:37.509> was<00:01:37.689> this<00:01:37.990> was<00:01:38.170> not<00:01:38.229> here

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
like I said this was this was not here

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.279 
like I said this was this was not here
all<00:01:38.859> this<00:01:39.069> stuff<00:01:39.340> here<00:01:39.700> was<00:01:40.479> added<00:01:40.689> on<00:01:40.989> later

00:01:41.279 --> 00:01:41.289 
all this stuff here was added on later

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:44.609 
all this stuff here was added on later
on<00:01:41.709> and<00:01:42.429> a<00:01:42.549> locking<00:01:43.000> pin<00:01:43.030> mechanism<00:01:43.619> this

on and a locking pin mechanism this

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:47.609 
on and a locking pin mechanism this
doesn't<00:01:44.920> do<00:01:45.009> anything<00:01:45.689> phaser<00:01:46.689> handle<00:01:47.079> can

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:47.619 
doesn't do anything phaser handle can

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:51.380 
doesn't do anything phaser handle can
come<00:01:47.860> off<00:01:48.069> but<00:01:48.310> I<00:01:48.579> leave<00:01:49.270> it<00:01:49.390> off<00:01:49.590> phaser<00:01:50.590> one

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
come off but I leave it off phaser one

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.309 
come off but I leave it off phaser one
was<00:01:52.390> replicated<00:01:53.969> using<00:01:54.969> the<00:01:55.659> actual<00:01:56.020> phaser

00:01:56.309 --> 00:01:56.319 
was replicated using the actual phaser

00:01:56.319 --> 00:02:00.149 
was replicated using the actual phaser
one<00:01:56.649> from<00:01:56.950> this<00:01:57.069> series<00:01:58.170> you<00:01:59.170> can<00:01:59.319> see<00:01:59.500> I<00:01:59.709> turn

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:00.159 
one from this series you can see I turn

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:02.550 
one from this series you can see I turn
it<00:02:00.280> forward<00:02:00.549> this<00:02:01.179> will<00:02:01.360> raise<00:02:01.479> up<00:02:01.780> and<00:02:02.349> watch

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
it forward this will raise up and watch

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.209 
it forward this will raise up and watch
the<00:02:02.739> front

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.649 

now<00:02:06.219> the<00:02:06.280> original<00:02:06.700> ones<00:02:06.879> there<00:02:07.119> was<00:02:07.209> a<00:02:07.299> tiny

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
now the original ones there was a tiny

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:15.780 
now the original ones there was a tiny
light<00:02:08.049> bulb<00:02:08.319> in<00:02:08.500> here<00:02:09.119> we<00:02:10.119> didn't<00:02:10.299> do<00:02:10.390> this

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:23.170 

okay<00:02:17.230> then<00:02:18.230> surely<00:02:18.800> inside<00:02:19.130> of<00:02:19.250> it<00:02:21.880> we<00:02:22.880> get<00:02:23.030> the

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
okay then surely inside of it we get the

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.650 
okay then surely inside of it we get the
really<00:02:23.360> simple<00:02:24.640> this<00:02:25.640> is<00:02:25.700> the<00:02:25.849> prototype<00:02:26.209> you

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
really simple this is the prototype you

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.530 
really simple this is the prototype you
can<00:02:26.900> see<00:02:27.200> rod<00:02:28.239> aluminum<00:02:29.239> rails<00:02:29.480> bloom<00:02:30.470> dial

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
can see rod aluminum rails bloom dial

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.259 
can see rod aluminum rails bloom dial
epoxy<00:02:33.130> and<00:02:34.130> if<00:02:34.310> you<00:02:34.400> turn<00:02:34.670> it<00:02:34.819> there's<00:02:35.180> a

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269 
epoxy and if you turn it there's a

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:38.020 
epoxy and if you turn it there's a
couple<00:02:35.480> different<00:02:35.630> settings<00:02:36.260> in<00:02:36.380> here<00:02:36.550> for<00:02:37.550> to

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
couple different settings in here for to

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:39.790 
couple different settings in here for to
make<00:02:38.209> the<00:02:38.360> asperger<00:02:38.780> pal<00:02:38.959> though<00:02:39.440> as<00:02:39.590> high<00:02:39.739> as

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
make the asperger pal though as high as
