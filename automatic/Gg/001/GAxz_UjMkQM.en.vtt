 a good meal out of it came a house 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.769
 ugly old woman with a broom 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.270

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:08.020
 the witch asked 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:09.070

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.990

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.980

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:48.620
 Gretel was ordered to clean 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.100
 once a witch ordered her to put on 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.810
 the fire 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:04:02.230
 a huge cauldron of water is time to cook 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:04:05.780

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:07.280
 the witch turned away for a moment gonzalez 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.580
 gretel slipped out 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:15.070
 they ran across the field and rushed into the depths 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:15.070
 the woods as quickly as their feet carried 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.900
 soon Hansel and Gretel understood that 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:24.080
 there is nothing to fear 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:29.930
 the chocolate house was left behind and the witch 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:32.950
 left without dinner in her cauldron for nothing 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:36.470
 empty water was boiling 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:40.340
 but little Hansel and Gretel again 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:46.330
 lost in the thicket to the case and asked 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:46.330
 the fence where do we go said gandhi 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:58.770
 and suddenly thought that they never 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:05:04.970
 there are children heard the distant voice of gun 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:09.740
 sorry they do not believe their ears 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:12.539
 voice in the distance was the voice of their father 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:13.460

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:17.940

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:20.849
 I promise you we will not abandon ganzel and 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:28.320
 Gretel returned home with his father 

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:32.250
 they lived happily ever after 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:35.370

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:38.330

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:41.330
