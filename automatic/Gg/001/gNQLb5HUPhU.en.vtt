00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:57.249 
go to sleep I like it I think we have

00:00:57.249 --> 00:00:59.790 
go to sleep I like it I think we have
some<00:00:57.429> video<00:00:57.550> we<00:00:58.210> are<00:00:58.239> showing<00:00:58.539> some<00:00:58.780> video<00:00:59.019> do

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800 
some video we are showing some video do

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.470 
some video we are showing some video do
you<00:00:59.859> see<00:01:00.039> that<00:01:00.159> see<00:01:00.429> ya<00:01:00.909> is<00:01:01.120> that<00:01:01.300> like<00:01:01.449> a

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:01.480 
you see that see ya is that like a

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.630 
you see that see ya is that like a
procedure<00:01:01.929> happening<00:01:02.440> it<00:01:02.559> is<00:01:02.739> uh-huh<00:01:03.429> and

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
procedure happening it is uh-huh and

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.250 
procedure happening it is uh-huh and
then<00:01:03.760> so<00:01:03.879> the<00:01:03.969> patient<00:01:04.150> is<00:01:04.449> awake<00:01:04.629> a<00:01:04.900> shin<00:01:05.080> is

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:05.260 
then so the patient is awake a shin is

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.140 
then so the patient is awake a shin is
awake<00:01:05.590> and<00:01:05.770> that's<00:01:06.250> very<00:01:06.460> different<00:01:06.729> than<00:01:06.940> the

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.150 
awake and that's very different than the

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.670 
awake and that's very different than the
way<00:01:07.270> we<00:01:07.300> traditionally<00:01:07.630> do<00:01:08.380> liposuction<00:01:08.800> um

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
way we traditionally do liposuction um

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.020 
way we traditionally do liposuction um

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
medicines to make them feel loopy so

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:14.550 
medicines to make them feel loopy so
they<00:01:13.150> don't<00:01:13.360> I<00:01:13.540> like<00:01:13.690> feeling<00:01:13.990> comfortable

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
they don't I like feeling comfortable

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
risks that that come into play that

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.180 
risks that that come into play that
don't<00:01:53.110> come<00:01:53.290> into<00:01:53.470> play<00:01:53.680> when<00:01:53.890> you're<00:01:53.980> moving

during the procedure a little bit and

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.330 
during the procedure a little bit and

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
you're gonna show it to you yeah so you

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.810 
you're gonna show it to you yeah so you
can<00:02:15.670> see<00:02:16.000> okay<00:02:17.010> so<00:02:18.010> you're<00:02:18.190> pushing<00:02:18.490> that<00:02:18.610> up

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
can see okay so you're pushing that up

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.420 
can see okay so you're pushing that up
but<00:02:19.420> it<00:02:19.690> vibrates<00:02:20.260> in<00:02:20.440> such<00:02:20.650> a<00:02:20.680> way<00:02:20.980> that<00:02:21.010> it

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
but it vibrates in such a way that it

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.480 
but it vibrates in such a way that it
tricks<00:02:21.730> that<00:02:22.030> the<00:02:22.200> the<00:02:23.200> pain<00:02:23.530> nerves<00:02:23.890> from

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
tricks that the the pain nerves from

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.010 
tricks that the the pain nerves from
being<00:02:24.730> able<00:02:24.940> to<00:02:25.000> tell<00:02:25.180> you<00:02:25.330> that<00:02:25.480> it<00:02:25.600> hurts<00:02:25.840> and

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
being able to tell you that it hurts and

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.650 
being able to tell you that it hurts and
so<00:02:26.170> you<00:02:26.230> sense<00:02:26.650> this<00:02:26.830> vibration<00:02:27.580> and<00:02:28.540> you

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
so you sense this vibration and you

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.150 
so you sense this vibration and you
don't<00:02:28.900> sense<00:02:29.170> the<00:02:29.380> pain<00:02:29.560> you<00:02:29.890> know<00:02:29.980> what<00:02:30.130> I

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
don't sense the pain you know what I

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.770 
don't sense the pain you know what I
think<00:02:30.460> that<00:02:30.580> reminds<00:02:30.970> me<00:02:31.060> of<00:02:31.180> maybe<00:02:31.360> tell<00:02:31.660> me

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
think that reminds me of maybe tell me

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.660 
think that reminds me of maybe tell me
if<00:02:31.840> I'm<00:02:31.930> wrong<00:02:32.140> if<00:02:32.470> I'm<00:02:32.980> not<00:02:33.010> correct<00:02:33.490> in<00:02:33.580> my

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
if I'm wrong if I'm not correct in my

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:34.590 
if I'm wrong if I'm not correct in my
description<00:02:33.940> but<00:02:34.240> you<00:02:34.330> know<00:02:34.450> those

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
description but you know those

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.810 
description but you know those
toothbrushes<00:02:35.320> that<00:02:35.500> you<00:02:35.740> did<00:02:35.950> the<00:02:36.340> sonicare

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
toothbrushes that you did the sonicare

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.700 
toothbrushes that you did the sonicare
yeah<00:02:37.030> it<00:02:37.450> just<00:02:37.480> vibrates<00:02:37.750> so<00:02:38.230> that's<00:02:38.410> the<00:02:38.530> kind

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:38.710 
yeah it just vibrates so that's the kind

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:42.660 
yeah it just vibrates so that's the kind
of<00:02:38.770> sensation<00:02:39.130> which<00:02:39.550> you're<00:02:39.790> okay<00:02:41.459> so<00:02:42.459> it's

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
of sensation which you're okay so it's

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.760 
of sensation which you're okay so it's
not<00:02:42.790> painful<00:02:43.060> does<00:02:43.450> it<00:02:43.570> brews<00:02:43.780> a<00:02:43.810> lot<00:02:44.110> less

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
not painful does it brews a lot less

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:46.140 
not painful does it brews a lot less
bruising<00:02:45.310> than<00:02:45.430> traditional<00:02:45.970> liposuction

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
bruising than traditional liposuction

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.290 
bruising than traditional liposuction
because<00:02:47.020> of<00:02:47.200> the<00:02:47.290> way<00:02:47.440> this<00:02:47.680> juan<00:02:47.980> moves<00:02:48.370> it<00:02:49.090> is

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
because of the way this juan moves it is

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.110 
because of the way this juan moves it is
selective<00:02:49.750> for<00:02:49.870> the<00:02:49.990> fat<00:02:50.230> and<00:02:50.500> it<00:02:51.070> spares<00:02:51.820> the

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
selective for the fat and it spares the

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.760 
selective for the fat and it spares the
other<00:02:52.270> structures<00:02:52.780> like<00:02:52.930> blood<00:02:53.170> vessels<00:02:53.560> so

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
other structures like blood vessels so

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.699 
other structures like blood vessels so
less<00:02:54.310> bruising<00:02:54.850> less<00:02:55.360> swelling<00:02:55.709> quicker

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
less bruising less swelling quicker

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:58.350 
less bruising less swelling quicker

Oh fascinating okay now i dint ask the
magic<00:04:27.250> question<00:04:27.550> because<00:04:27.699> i<00:04:27.760> know<00:04:27.820> people<00:04:28.180> at

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 
magic question because i know people at

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.879 
magic question because i know people at
home<00:04:28.449> are<00:04:28.600> wondering<00:04:28.960> how<00:04:29.050> i<00:04:29.080> was<00:04:29.590> a<00:04:29.680> pricing

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:29.889 
home are wondering how i was a pricing

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:32.280 
home are wondering how i was a pricing
compared<00:04:30.340> to<00:04:30.460> regular<00:04:30.639> likely<00:04:31.630> it's<00:04:31.840> gonna<00:04:32.020> be

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:32.290 
compared to regular likely it's gonna be

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:33.960 
compared to regular likely it's gonna be
cheaper<00:04:32.560> because<00:04:32.919> you<00:04:33.160> don't<00:04:33.370> have<00:04:33.460> the<00:04:33.580> cost

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
cheaper because you don't have the cost

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.950 
cheaper because you don't have the cost
of<00:04:34.300> anesthesia<00:04:35.199> so<00:04:36.810> pricing<00:04:37.810> is

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
of anesthesia so pricing is

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.930 
of anesthesia so pricing is
traditionally<00:04:38.620> about<00:04:38.889> two<00:04:39.160> thousand<00:04:39.610> dollars

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
traditionally about two thousand dollars

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.580

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
for the first area and then it goes down

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.580 
for the first area and then it goes down
as<00:04:41.860> you<00:04:41.979> do<00:04:42.100> more<00:04:42.280> than<00:04:42.340> one<00:04:43.090> area<00:04:43.300> and<00:04:43.660> i'm<00:04:44.410> the
