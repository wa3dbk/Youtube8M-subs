 8 something was output smaller than the volume and it was written 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:25.540
 What with this is I was just not read 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:28.790
 Many of fact, I'm a guy of carp latest 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:30.160
 I bought recently I do not know latest book 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:33.210
 It is year but 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:36.560
 In the it's a natural that'd end was deaf to this 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.560
 So I wonder if you try at what you 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:39.639

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:57.190
 Nde no undue importance 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:05:02.170

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:23.450
 Authorities who think that they are probably somebody heard 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:39.460
 This is not the mainland anymore but this 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:43.660
 I think it is worthwhile to buy a little 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:48.009
 A little of the many such Datte love even if you want out the sound of the now iron Kannon place charger after softening 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:51.190
 I don't bring it inside, I think I'm absolutely crap but it's this 

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:52.610
 You should buy after all because it is absolutely better if you start feeling good 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:56.539
 One hundred yen 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:58.910
 I can buy it for 105 yen, I think this is absolutely Kawabe 

00:05:56.539 --> 00:06:01.750
 Why 

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:03.750

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:03.750
 Hmm
