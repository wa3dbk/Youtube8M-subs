00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:21.340 
to your home garage door and so we'll

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.820 
to your home garage door and so we'll
show<00:00:21.550> you<00:00:21.580> how<00:00:21.700> to<00:00:21.850> use<00:00:22.030> that<00:00:22.240> today<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:23.590> first

show you how to use that today the first
thing<00:00:24.010> we<00:00:24.130> do<00:00:24.280> before<00:00:24.310> we<00:00:24.610> program<00:00:25.150> your

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:25.330 
thing we do before we program your

actually two different brands that get
used<00:00:51.249> in<00:00:51.399> GM<00:00:51.670> vehicles<00:00:52.149> the<00:00:53.079> first<00:00:53.379> one<00:00:53.620> is<00:00:53.859> the

00:00:54.029 --> 00:00:54.039 
used in GM vehicles the first one is the

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:55.590 
used in GM vehicles the first one is the
leer<00:00:54.280> and<00:00:54.550> the<00:00:54.640> other<00:00:54.789> one<00:00:54.999> is<00:00:55.179> homeland

leer and the other one is homeland

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.000 
leer and the other one is homeland
you'll<00:00:55.809> be<00:00:55.929> able<00:00:56.050> to<00:00:56.230> identify<00:00:56.649> the<00:00:56.710> leer

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010 
you'll be able to identify the leer

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.590 
you'll be able to identify the leer
transmitter<00:00:57.519> by<00:00:57.760> the<00:00:57.819> fact<00:00:58.120> that<00:00:58.269> there<00:00:58.479> are

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
transmitter by the fact that there are
