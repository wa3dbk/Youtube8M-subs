we promise aside from this the controls
are<00:02:34.710> absolutely<00:02:35.280> simplistic<00:02:35.700> and<00:02:36.000> take<00:02:36.120> only

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
mere seconds to learn in fact we kind of

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.640 
mere seconds to learn in fact we kind of
think<00:02:39.120> that<00:02:39.330> almost<00:02:39.690> anybody<00:02:40.170> can<00:02:40.350> learn<00:02:40.500> to

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
think that almost anybody can learn to

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.110 
think that almost anybody can learn to
play<00:02:40.800> this<00:02:40.980> game<00:02:41.220> which<00:02:41.430> is<00:02:41.580> actually<00:02:41.760> quite<00:02:42.000> a

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
play this game which is actually quite a

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.690 
play this game which is actually quite a
strength<00:02:42.630> that<00:02:43.260> is<00:02:43.500> because<00:02:44.040> the<00:02:44.070> app<00:02:44.430> takes

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
strength that is because the app takes

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.790 
strength that is because the app takes
only<00:02:44.940> a<00:02:45.090> mere<00:02:45.270> seconds<00:02:45.690> to<00:02:45.840> learn<00:02:46.050> but<00:02:46.530> quite<00:02:46.770> a

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
only a mere seconds to learn but quite a

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.710 
only a mere seconds to learn but quite a
long<00:02:47.160> time<00:02:47.190> to<00:02:47.610> master<00:02:48.030> in<00:02:48.210> fact<00:02:48.420> we<00:02:48.600> don't

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
long time to master in fact we don't

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.140 
long time to master in fact we don't
think<00:02:48.960> we've<00:02:49.110> begun<00:02:50.070> to<00:02:50.250> scratch<00:02:50.370> our<00:02:50.760> mastery

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
think we've begun to scratch our mastery

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.760

getting them to splat exactly as you
like<00:02:54.450> them<00:02:54.660> to<00:02:54.840> is<00:02:54.990> really<00:02:55.230> quite<00:02:55.410> a<00:02:55.440> fine

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:55.710 
like them to is really quite a fine

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:57.470 
like them to is really quite a fine
science<00:02:56.100> which<00:02:56.280> adds<00:02:56.490> a<00:02:56.610> lot<00:02:56.760> of<00:02:56.940> fun<00:02:57.240> and

three<00:03:09.840> stars<00:03:10.020> not<00:03:10.320> for<00:03:10.560> either<00:03:11.070> way<00:03:11.340> you'll<00:03:11.430> be

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:11.460 
three stars not for either way you'll be

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.220 
three stars not for either way you'll be
getting<00:03:11.730> points<00:03:12.030> which<00:03:12.180> added<00:03:12.510> to<00:03:12.630> the<00:03:12.750> global

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
getting points which added to the global

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:14.990 
getting points which added to the global
leader<00:03:13.350> board<00:03:13.710> and<00:03:14.040> your<00:03:14.220> achievements<00:03:14.820> and

all<00:03:15.570> is<00:03:15.810> well<00:03:15.840> within<00:03:16.380> the<00:03:16.590> neighborhood<00:03:17.040> I'm

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
all is well within the neighborhood I'm

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:18.830 
all is well within the neighborhood I'm
going<00:03:17.820> to<00:03:17.880> go<00:03:17.940> ahead<00:03:18.000> and<00:03:18.120> skip<00:03:18.360> this<00:03:18.570> although

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
going to go ahead and skip this although

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.030 
going to go ahead and skip this although
I<00:03:18.960> will<00:03:19.200> mention<00:03:19.320> that<00:03:19.560> the<00:03:19.710> level<00:03:19.950> design

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
I will mention that the level design

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.130 
I will mention that the level design
itself<00:03:20.490> is<00:03:20.700> quite<00:03:20.880> good<00:03:21.240> especially<00:03:21.570> later

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
itself is quite good especially later

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.600 
itself is quite good especially later
levels<00:03:22.380> you'll<00:03:22.680> be<00:03:22.830> experiencing<00:03:23.310> shapes

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
levels you'll be experiencing shapes

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.510 
levels you'll be experiencing shapes
that<00:03:23.730> are<00:03:23.850> in<00:03:24.090> fact<00:03:24.270> hard<00:03:24.600> to<00:03:24.810> beat<00:03:25.370> but<00:03:26.370> for

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 
that are in fact hard to beat but for

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:27.470 
that are in fact hard to beat but for
now<00:03:26.550> let's<00:03:26.760> go<00:03:26.820> check<00:03:27.000> out<00:03:27.120> the<00:03:27.150> color

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
now let's go check out the color

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:28.820 
now let's go check out the color
matching<00:03:27.930> this<00:03:28.080> is<00:03:28.230> where<00:03:28.380> you<00:03:28.440> first<00:03:28.650> see

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
matching this is where you first see

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:30.500 
matching this is where you first see
this<00:03:29.040> so<00:03:29.670> you<00:03:29.760> can<00:03:29.910> see<00:03:30.030> if<00:03:30.090> we<00:03:30.120> got<00:03:30.210> a<00:03:30.270> blue

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
this so you can see if we got a blue

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.830 
this so you can see if we got a blue
section<00:03:30.930> right<00:03:31.050> here<00:03:31.110> that<00:03:31.380> I<00:03:31.440> must<00:03:31.680> match<00:03:31.920> up

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
section right here that I must match up

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.740 
section right here that I must match up
to<00:03:33.840> do<00:03:33.960> so<00:03:34.140> we<00:03:34.230> simply<00:03:34.500> do<00:03:34.590> that<00:03:34.650> and<00:03:35.240> then<00:03:36.240> land

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
to do so we simply do that and then land

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.530 
to do so we simply do that and then land
of<00:03:36.900> blue<00:03:37.110> within<00:03:37.800> the<00:03:38.010> actual<00:03:38.190> surface<00:03:39.060> area

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
of blue within the actual surface area

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.410 
of blue within the actual surface area
of<00:03:39.720> the<00:03:40.470> blue<00:03:40.710> portion<00:03:41.160> of<00:03:41.250> the<00:03:41.370> shape<00:03:41.610> this

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
of the blue portion of the shape this

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:43.880 
of the blue portion of the shape this
adds<00:03:42.660> quite<00:03:42.900> a<00:03:43.020> lot<00:03:43.320> to<00:03:43.560> the<00:03:43.680> gameplay

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
adds quite a lot to the gameplay

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.910 
adds quite a lot to the gameplay
especially<00:03:44.550> in<00:03:44.640> later<00:03:44.790> levels<00:03:45.740> aside<00:03:46.740> from

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
especially in later levels aside from

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.920 
especially in later levels aside from
this<00:03:47.190> further<00:03:47.940> elements<00:03:48.360> to<00:03:48.480> enrich<00:03:48.750> the

gameplay itself you've got the super

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:51.440 
gameplay itself you've got the super
splatters<00:03:50.850> that<00:03:51.030> we<00:03:51.090> mentioned<00:03:51.390> earlier

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450
