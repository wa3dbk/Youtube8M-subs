00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
little darker it's a little more compact

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:32.390 
little darker it's a little more compact
and<00:01:26.369> it's<00:01:27.090> got<00:01:28.520> 486<00:01:29.990> processor<00:01:30.990> power<00:01:31.619> while

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
and it's got 486 processor power while

interesting<00:02:20.850> thing<00:02:21.030> about<00:02:21.090> this<00:02:21.360> system<00:02:21.780> is

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
interesting thing about this system is

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.760 
interesting thing about this system is
the<00:02:22.020> controls<00:02:23.360> or<00:02:24.360> itself<00:02:24.840> is<00:02:25.110> pretty<00:02:25.440> hard<00:02:25.709> to

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
the controls or itself is pretty hard to

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.280 
the controls or itself is pretty hard to
come<00:02:25.950> by<00:02:26.100> I<00:02:26.340> in<00:02:26.940> fact<00:02:27.120> don't<00:02:27.300> have<00:02:27.510> it<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:28.140> good

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
come by I in fact don't have it the good

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.320 
come by I in fact don't have it the good
