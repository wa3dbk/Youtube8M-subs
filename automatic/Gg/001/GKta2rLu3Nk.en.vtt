00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:49.429 
do a comparison of this fake and the

00:05:49.429 --> 00:06:11.609 
do a comparison of this fake and the
rope<00:05:49.669> is<00:05:49.999> Vida<00:06:07.389> somewhat<00:06:08.469> unresponsive

00:06:11.609 --> 00:06:11.619 

00:06:11.619 --> 00:06:15.279 

little<00:06:12.619> slow<00:06:12.889> to<00:06:12.949> the<00:06:13.159> app<00:06:13.309> I<00:06:14.229> shouldn't<00:06:15.229> be

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:15.289 
little slow to the app I shouldn't be

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:16.809 
little slow to the app I shouldn't be
going<00:06:15.439> to<00:06:15.529> beat<00:06:15.679> up<00:06:15.800> this<00:06:15.949> bad<00:06:16.219> in<00:06:16.489> this<00:06:16.579> game

00:06:16.809 --> 00:06:16.819 
going to beat up this bad in this game

00:06:16.819 --> 00:06:24.219 
going to beat up this bad in this game
like<00:06:17.029> really<00:06:22.209> okay<00:06:23.209> you<00:06:23.659> can<00:06:23.839> hear<00:06:24.079> that

00:06:24.219 --> 00:06:24.229
