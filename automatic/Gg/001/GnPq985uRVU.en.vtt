00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
head and in it in place these are called

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.660 
head and in it in place these are called
pin<00:00:58.559> curls<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:59.039> this<00:00:59.129> is<00:00:59.250> actually<00:00:59.609> how

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
pin curls and this is actually how

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.310 
pin curls and this is actually how
people<00:01:00.000> used<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.300> curl<00:01:00.539> their<00:01:00.719> hair<00:01:00.750> or

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
people used to curl their hair or

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.170 
people used to curl their hair or
curling<00:01:01.770> irons<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:02.460> it<00:01:02.609> is<00:01:02.730> really<00:01:03.059> really

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
curling irons and it is really really

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.210 
curling irons and it is really really
effective<00:01:03.870> what<00:01:04.530> I<00:01:04.559> like<00:01:04.739> about<00:01:04.860> it<00:01:05.100> is<00:01:05.189> that

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
effective what I like about it is that

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.070 
effective what I like about it is that
you<00:01:05.400> can<00:01:05.549> make<00:01:05.670> it<00:01:05.820> as<00:01:05.970> big<00:01:06.240> or<00:01:06.420> as<00:01:06.510> small<00:01:07.020> as

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
you can make it as big or as small as

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.480 
you can make it as big or as small as
you<00:01:07.229> want<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:07.619> you<00:01:07.680> can<00:01:07.830> make<00:01:07.950> them<00:01:08.070> going<00:01:08.340> in

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
you want and you can make them going in

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.060 
you want and you can make them going in
any<00:01:08.640> direction<00:01:08.880> that<00:01:09.240> you<00:01:09.390> want<00:01:09.860> so<00:01:10.860> you<00:01:10.920> can

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
any direction that you want so you can

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.070 
any direction that you want so you can
basically<00:01:11.210> recreate<00:01:12.210> any<00:01:12.390> of<00:01:12.570> my<00:01:12.750> curl

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
basically recreate any of my curl

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.410 
basically recreate any of my curl
patterns<00:01:13.500> with<00:01:13.799> this<00:01:14.070> technique<00:01:14.490> if<00:01:15.240> you

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
patterns with this technique if you

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.460 
patterns with this technique if you
don't<00:01:15.570> want<00:01:15.689> to<00:01:15.750> have<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:15.930> roll<00:01:16.080> it<00:01:16.110> up<00:01:16.259> at<00:01:16.380> the

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
don't want to have to roll it up at the

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.230 
don't want to have to roll it up at the
end<00:01:16.650> you<00:01:16.860> can<00:01:17.009> also<00:01:17.159> wrap<00:01:17.670> it<00:01:17.820> around<00:01:17.939> two

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
end you can also wrap it around two

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.760 
end you can also wrap it around two
fingers<00:01:18.570> right<00:01:18.810> next<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.320> that<00:01:19.350> square

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
fingers right next to that square

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.520 
fingers right next to that square
section<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.520> then<00:01:21.450> just<00:01:21.689> rotate<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.229> circle

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
section and then just rotate the circle

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:23.840 
section and then just rotate the circle
until<00:01:22.650> it's<00:01:22.920> sitting<00:01:23.159> on<00:01:23.220> top<00:01:23.280> of<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.670> square

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
until it's sitting on top of the square

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.149 
until it's sitting on top of the square
and<00:01:24.210> pin<00:01:24.420> it<00:01:24.509> in<00:01:24.600> place<00:01:24.659> that<00:01:25.650> might<00:01:25.770> be<00:01:25.920> a<00:01:25.950> lot

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
and pin it in place that might be a lot

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.499 
and pin it in place that might be a lot
easier<00:01:26.520> especially<00:01:26.549> if<00:01:27.000> you<00:01:27.119> have<00:01:27.270> longer

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
easier especially if you have longer

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.090 
easier especially if you have longer
hair<00:01:27.659> so<00:01:28.080> if<00:01:28.259> you<00:01:28.350> have<00:01:28.470> a<00:01:28.500> little<00:01:28.829> bit<00:01:28.950> of<00:01:29.040> a

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
hair so if you have a little bit of a

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.830 
hair so if you have a little bit of a
hard<00:01:29.310> time<00:01:29.340> with<00:01:29.520> that<00:01:29.670> go<00:01:30.360> ahead<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:30.659> do<00:01:30.750> it

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
hard time with that go ahead and do it

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.719 
hard time with that go ahead and do it
this<00:01:30.869> way<00:01:31.170> now<00:01:31.439> this<00:01:32.040> takes<00:01:32.250> me<00:01:32.400> about<00:01:32.549> 15

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
this way now this takes me about 15

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.730 
this way now this takes me about 15
minutes<00:01:32.970> it's<00:01:33.420> not<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.750> fastest<00:01:34.229> method<00:01:34.409> but

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
minutes it's not the fastest method but

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.020 
minutes it's not the fastest method but
I<00:01:34.770> like<00:01:35.009> it<00:01:35.159> because<00:01:35.430> you<00:01:35.549> have<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.880> most

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
I like it because you have the most

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.660 
I like it because you have the most
control<00:01:36.329> over<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:37.110> end<00:01:37.290> result<00:01:37.799> so<00:01:38.430> like<00:01:38.549> I

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
control over the end result so like I

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.429 
control over the end result so like I
said<00:01:38.729> you<00:01:38.880> can<00:01:39.090> make<00:01:39.119> any<00:01:39.479> look<00:01:39.900> you<00:01:39.930> want<00:01:40.290> with

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
said you can make any look you want with

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.170 
said you can make any look you want with
this<00:01:40.590> it's<00:01:40.770> not<00:01:40.860> just<00:01:40.950> limited<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:41.579> having

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
this it's not just limited to having

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.609 
this it's not just limited to having
curls<00:01:42.659> that<00:01:42.750> start<00:01:43.049> at<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.290> nape<00:01:43.409> of<00:01:43.470> your

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619

voluminous<00:01:45.720> to<00:01:46.110> deal<00:01:46.259> with<00:01:46.470> so<00:01:47.100> once<00:01:47.250> you're

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
voluminous to deal with so once you're
