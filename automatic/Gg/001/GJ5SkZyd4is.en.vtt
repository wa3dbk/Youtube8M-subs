little bit different and you get a

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.330 
little bit different and you get a
little<00:00:16.320> bit<00:00:16.440> smoother<00:00:16.800> of<00:00:16.859> a<00:00:16.920> blender<00:00:17.250> the

going<00:00:59.640> now<00:01:00.059> a<00:01:00.090> lot<00:01:00.329> of<00:01:00.359> people<00:01:00.539> like<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:00.809> start

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
going now a lot of people like to start

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.479 
going now a lot of people like to start
with<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.410> medium<00:01:01.559> color<00:01:01.890> or<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.219> lightest

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
with the medium color or the lightest

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.789 
with the medium color or the lightest
color<00:01:02.730> when<00:01:03.090> they<00:01:03.180> color<00:01:03.390> but<00:01:04.290> I<00:01:04.320> find<00:01:04.589> when

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
color when they color but I find when

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:05.780 
color when they color but I find when
you<00:01:04.860> do<00:01:04.979> that<00:01:05.129> you<00:01:05.250> need<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.460> have<00:01:05.549> more

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
you do that you need to have more

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.330 
you do that you need to have more
markers<00:01:06.180> so<00:01:06.900> what<00:01:07.710> I<00:01:07.740> found<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.250> be<00:01:08.280> the

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
markers so what I found to be the

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.700 
markers so what I found to be the
easiest<00:01:08.790> way<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.119> blend<00:01:09.479> is<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:10.290> start<00:01:10.530> with<00:01:10.619> my

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
easiest way to blend is to start with my

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.280 
easiest way to blend is to start with my
darkest<00:01:11.159> color<00:01:11.189> so<00:01:12.090> I'm<00:01:12.510> going<00:01:12.689> to<00:01:12.750> go<00:01:12.840> in<00:01:13.020> with

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
orange red to this picture here then I'm

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.630

which is why ro7 and I like to use a

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.280 
which is why ro7 and I like to use a
chisel<00:01:31.290> edge<00:01:31.530> alot<00:01:31.799> because<00:01:32.000> that<00:01:33.229> can<00:01:34.229> help

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
chisel edge alot because that can help

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.840 
chisel edge alot because that can help
loosen<00:01:34.710> up<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:34.920> pigment<00:01:35.310> because<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.640> nib<00:01:35.820> is

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
loosen up the pigment because the nib is

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.210 
loosen up the pigment because the nib is
stiffer<00:01:36.560> and<00:01:37.560> I'm<00:01:37.680> just<00:01:37.829> going<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:37.979> go<00:01:38.189> over

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
stiffer and I'm just going to go over

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.219 
stiffer and I'm just going to go over
what<00:01:38.700> I've<00:01:38.820> already<00:01:39.000> colored<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.720> dried<00:01:40.049> the

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
what I've already colored and dried the

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.679 
what I've already colored and dried the
color<00:01:40.439> up<00:01:40.790> by<00:01:41.790> doing<00:01:42.060> it<00:01:42.150> this<00:01:42.270> way<00:01:42.329> you<00:01:42.450> can

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
color up by doing it this way you can

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.719 
color up by doing it this way you can
actually<00:01:42.960> jump<00:01:43.229> a<00:01:43.530> few<00:01:44.189> levels<00:01:44.460> between

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
actually jump a few levels between

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.389 
actually jump a few levels between
colors<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:45.659> it<00:01:45.780> still<00:01:45.990> blends<00:01:46.229> nice<00:01:46.530> instead

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
colors and it still blends nice instead

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.190 
colors and it still blends nice instead
of<00:01:47.490> having<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.790> use<00:01:47.820> 8<00:01:48.090> markers<00:01:48.570> on<00:01:48.899> one<00:01:49.020> thing

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
of having to use 8 markers on one thing

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.630 
of having to use 8 markers on one thing
you<00:01:49.350> can<00:01:49.500> use<00:01:49.649> 3<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.159> get<00:01:50.250> a<00:01:50.280> really<00:01:50.520> nice

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
you can use 3 and get a really nice

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.889 
you can use 3 and get a really nice
blend<00:01:50.970> so<00:01:51.869> I<00:01:51.899> work<00:01:52.500> darkest<00:01:52.829> to<00:01:52.979> lightest<00:01:53.899> it's

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
blend so I work darkest to lightest it's

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.260 
blend so I work darkest to lightest it's
not<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.229> way<00:01:55.320> everybody<00:01:55.740> does<00:01:55.799> it<00:01:56.130> but<00:01:56.399> it's

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
not the way everybody does it but it's

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.300 
not the way everybody does it but it's
the<00:01:57.360> way<00:01:57.420> I<00:01:57.450> do<00:01:57.600> it<00:01:57.719> it<00:01:58.469> seems<00:01:58.710> to<00:01:58.770> save<00:01:59.040> a<00:01:59.070> lot

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
the way I do it it seems to save a lot

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.740 
the way I do it it seems to save a lot
of<00:01:59.340> time<00:01:59.579> you<00:01:59.820> don't<00:01:59.969> need<00:02:00.090> as<00:02:00.180> many<00:02:00.299> markers

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
of time you don't need as many markers

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.469 
of time you don't need as many markers
and<00:02:01.250> as<00:02:02.250> you<00:02:02.369> can<00:02:02.490> see<00:02:02.549> you<00:02:02.790> get<00:02:02.909> a<00:02:02.969> really<00:02:03.329> nice

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
and as you can see you get a really nice

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.210 
and as you can see you get a really nice
blend<00:02:04.969> and<00:02:05.969> I<00:02:06.090> would<00:02:06.240> just<00:02:06.360> repeat<00:02:06.780> that<00:02:07.220> for

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
blend and I would just repeat that for

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.180 
blend and I would just repeat that for
every<00:02:08.729> single<00:02:09.000> petal

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190

what all the fuss was about I didn't
find<00:02:56.460> them<00:02:56.640> to<00:02:56.730> be<00:02:56.790> that<00:02:56.940> much<00:02:57.090> different<00:02:57.420> than

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
find them to be that much different than

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.000 
find them to be that much different than
other<00:02:57.720> watercolor<00:02:58.290> markers<00:02:58.470> that<00:02:58.740> I<00:02:58.860> already

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
other watercolor markers that I already

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.270 
other watercolor markers that I already
had<00:02:59.430> um<00:03:00.320> but<00:03:01.320> you<00:03:01.530> know<00:03:01.560> they<00:03:01.770> do<00:03:01.830> blend<00:03:02.160> really

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
had um but you know they do blend really

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.560 
had um but you know they do blend really
well<00:03:02.400> and<00:03:02.640> I've<00:03:02.760> got<00:03:02.940> some<00:03:03.120> eye<00:03:03.210> here<00:03:03.390> so<00:03:03.510> I'm

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
well and I've got some eye here so I'm

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.090 
well and I've got some eye here so I'm
going<00:03:03.690> to<00:03:03.720> go<00:03:03.810> ahead<00:03:04.020> and<00:03:04.110> use<00:03:04.230> them<00:03:04.380> so<00:03:04.830> if

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
going to go ahead and use them so if

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.430 
going to go ahead and use them so if
you're<00:03:05.280> using<00:03:05.520> watercolor<00:03:06.180> markers<00:03:06.480> my<00:03:07.050> first

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
you're using watercolor markers my first

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.080 
you're using watercolor markers my first
tip<00:03:07.620> would<00:03:07.650> be<00:03:07.770> to<00:03:07.860> use<00:03:08.130> watercolor<00:03:08.700> paper

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
tip would be to use watercolor paper

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.390 
tip would be to use watercolor paper
it'll<00:03:09.930> be<00:03:10.050> a<00:03:10.080> huge<00:03:10.530> difference<00:03:10.980> in<00:03:11.070> trying<00:03:11.250> to

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
it'll be a huge difference in trying to

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.060 
it'll be a huge difference in trying to
use<00:03:11.730> the<00:03:12.420> paper<00:03:13.080> that<00:03:13.350> you<00:03:13.470> would<00:03:13.620> normally

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
use the paper that you would normally

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:18.020 
use the paper that you would normally
use<00:03:14.310> with<00:03:15.300> your<00:03:16.190> your<00:03:17.190> alcohol<00:03:17.520> markers<00:03:17.880> this

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
use with your your alcohol markers this

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.020 
use with your your alcohol markers this
is<00:03:18.270> like<00:03:18.720> Nina<00:03:19.020> really<00:03:19.560> smooth<00:03:19.890> paper<00:03:20.490> I<00:03:20.820> love

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
is like Nina really smooth paper I love

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.990 
is like Nina really smooth paper I love
it<00:03:21.120> a<00:03:21.180> lot<00:03:21.330> for<00:03:21.600> the<00:03:22.370> alcohol<00:03:23.370> markers<00:03:23.700> but<00:03:23.880> if

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
it a lot for the alcohol markers but if

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.860 
it a lot for the alcohol markers but if
I<00:03:24.120> try<00:03:24.330> to<00:03:24.360> color<00:03:24.660> with<00:03:25.500> this<00:03:25.790> and<00:03:26.790> then<00:03:27.630> I<00:03:27.660> try

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
I try to color with this and then I try

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.510 
I try to color with this and then I try
to<00:03:27.900> blend<00:03:28.230> it's<00:03:28.680> not<00:03:28.830> going<00:03:29.010> to<00:03:29.070> blend<00:03:29.310> it's

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:29.520 
to blend it's not going to blend it's

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.010 
to blend it's not going to blend it's
going<00:03:29.670> to<00:03:29.760> kind<00:03:29.910> of<00:03:30.000> sink<00:03:30.300> into<00:03:30.540> that<00:03:30.660> paper

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.020 
going to kind of sink into that paper

going to kind of sink into that paper
and<00:03:31.260> look<00:03:31.350> at<00:03:31.440> that<00:03:31.620> I<00:03:31.650> can<00:03:31.770> barely<00:03:32.280> get<00:03:32.370> the

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:32.490 
and look at that I can barely get the

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:35.630 
and look at that I can barely get the
color<00:03:32.670> to<00:03:32.820> move<00:03:33.320> but<00:03:34.320> if<00:03:34.410> I<00:03:34.500> do<00:03:34.560> that<00:03:34.890> here<00:03:35.460> on

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
color to move but if I do that here on

this watercolor paper look at that it
just<00:03:38.010> lifts<00:03:38.400> right<00:03:38.490> up<00:03:38.550> and<00:03:38.760> moves<00:03:38.940> around

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
just lifts right up and moves around

kind of lets the ink sit on the top of
the<00:03:44.700> paper<00:03:44.880> and<00:03:45.240> then<00:03:45.810> you're<00:03:45.930> able<00:03:46.080> to<00:03:46.260> slide

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
the paper and then you're able to slide

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.040 
the paper and then you're able to slide
it<00:03:47.160> around<00:03:47.370> with<00:03:47.670> a<00:03:47.700> damp<00:03:47.970> brush<00:03:48.150> you<00:03:48.900> could

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:50.150

I've had this water brush for years I'm
made<00:03:52.770> by<00:03:52.920> the<00:03:52.980> company<00:03:53.160> Nietzsche<00:03:53.840> I<00:03:54.840> think

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
made by the company Nietzsche I think

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.580 
made by the company Nietzsche I think
Tim<00:03:55.650> Holtz<00:03:55.950> probably<00:03:56.280> has<00:03:56.430> one<00:03:56.459> and<00:03:57.350> so<00:03:58.350> if<00:03:58.470> you

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
Tim Holtz probably has one and so if you

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:59.930 
Tim Holtz probably has one and so if you
don't<00:03:58.709> have<00:03:58.920> one<00:03:59.100> you<00:03:59.280> can<00:03:59.310> they're<00:03:59.610> not<00:03:59.760> that

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
don't have one you can they're not that

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.550 
don't have one you can they're not that
expensive<00:04:00.270> but<00:04:00.630> you<00:04:00.930> can<00:04:01.050> see<00:04:01.200> how<00:04:01.350> that

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
expensive but you can see how that

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:02.810 
expensive but you can see how that
blends<00:04:01.920> out<00:04:02.070> really<00:04:02.130> well

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820

will all show you if I go over this it's

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
will all show you if I go over this it's
going<00:04:12.900> to<00:04:12.959> be<00:04:13.020> harder<00:04:13.230> to<00:04:13.260> blend<00:04:13.620> that<00:04:13.680> color

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:13.800 
going to be harder to blend that color

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.390 
going to be harder to blend that color
that<00:04:14.700> I<00:04:14.760> just<00:04:15.030> put<00:04:15.240> on<00:04:15.270> top<00:04:15.570> of<00:04:15.750> the<00:04:15.810> wet<00:04:15.959> paper

that I just put on top of the wet paper

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.770 
that I just put on top of the wet paper
but<00:04:17.400> I<00:04:17.430> could<00:04:17.609> leave<00:04:17.760> it<00:04:17.790> like<00:04:17.910> that<00:04:18.209> but<00:04:18.540> if<00:04:18.660> I

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
but I could leave it like that but if I

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:19.849 
but I could leave it like that but if I
go<00:04:18.900> in<00:04:19.020> to<00:04:19.109> blend<00:04:19.320> it<00:04:19.440> it's<00:04:19.560> not<00:04:19.680> going<00:04:19.799> to

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
go in to blend it it's not going to

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.440 
go in to blend it it's not going to
blend<00:04:19.979> quite<00:04:20.250> as<00:04:20.370> easily<00:04:20.609> as<00:04:20.940> if<00:04:21.120> it<00:04:21.210> was<00:04:21.330> on

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
blend quite as easily as if it was on

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.450 
blend quite as easily as if it was on
the<00:04:21.479> dry<00:04:22.010> they'll<00:04:23.010> blend<00:04:23.250> a<00:04:23.340> little<00:04:23.550> bit<00:04:23.700> but

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
the dry they'll blend a little bit but

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.700 
the dry they'll blend a little bit but
you<00:04:24.910> run<00:04:25.060> the<00:04:25.120> risk<00:04:25.180> of<00:04:25.360> killing<00:04:25.600> the<00:04:25.810> paper<00:04:26.020> so

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
you run the risk of killing the paper so

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:27.900 
you run the risk of killing the paper so
I<00:04:26.740> like<00:04:26.949> to<00:04:26.979> go<00:04:27.130> dry<00:04:27.310> get<00:04:27.520> all<00:04:27.610> my<00:04:27.759> stuff

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
colored in and then go out and blend it

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.570 
colored in and then go out and blend it
and<00:04:30.280> that's<00:04:31.180> how<00:04:31.300> you<00:04:31.419> work<00:04:31.810> with<00:04:32.110> the

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
and that's how you work with the

would<00:05:01.889> so<00:05:02.889> it's<00:05:03.099> very<00:05:03.370> easy<00:05:03.580> to<00:05:04.770> to<00:05:05.770> play<00:05:06.009> with

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.220 
would so it's very easy to to play with

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.400 
would so it's very easy to to play with
so<00:05:07.030> there<00:05:07.210> you<00:05:07.330> go<00:05:07.479> two<00:05:07.539> different<00:05:07.900> styles<00:05:08.380> of

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:08.410 
so there you go two different styles of

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:10.320 
so there you go two different styles of
coloring<00:05:08.800> with<00:05:08.949> markers<00:05:09.340> neither<00:05:09.759> of<00:05:09.970> them<00:05:10.120> is

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.330 
coloring with markers neither of them is

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.719 
coloring with markers neither of them is
difficult<00:05:10.710> use<00:05:11.710> what<00:05:11.889> you<00:05:12.009> have<00:05:12.160> see<00:05:12.520> if<00:05:12.580> that

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:12.729 
difficult use what you have see if that

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:14.310 
difficult use what you have see if that
works<00:05:12.940> before<00:05:13.240> you<00:05:13.300> go<00:05:13.449> with<00:05:13.539> my<00:05:13.750> new<00:05:13.990> stuff

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:14.320 
works before you go with my new stuff
