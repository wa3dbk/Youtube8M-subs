00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:15.049 
Chris hunt as gone today I'm going to

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:16.839 
Chris hunt as gone today I'm going to
show<00:00:15.290> you<00:00:15.320> the<00:00:15.920> different<00:00:16.250> motors<00:00:16.520> we<00:00:16.640> have

00:00:16.839 --> 00:00:16.849 
show you the different motors we have

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:19.570 
show you the different motors we have
we'll<00:00:17.090> start<00:00:17.330> with<00:00:17.450> a<00:00:17.500> smallest<00:00:18.500> one<00:00:18.680> this<00:00:19.400> is

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:19.580 
we'll start with a smallest one this is

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.570 
we'll start with a smallest one this is
our<00:00:20.080> 1,000<00:00:21.080> watt<00:00:21.230> 250<00:00:21.770> an<00:00:21.830> hour<00:00:21.920> watt<00:00:22.130> motor<00:00:22.340> we

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:22.580 
our 1,000 watt 250 an hour watt motor we

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.929 
our 1,000 watt 250 an hour watt motor we
use<00:00:22.789> it's<00:00:23.119> a<00:00:23.449> 24<00:00:24.260> millimeter<00:00:24.410> magnets<00:00:25.100> you<00:00:25.910> can

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:25.939 
use it's a 24 millimeter magnets you can

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:28.509 
use it's a 24 millimeter magnets you can
see<00:00:26.330> it's<00:00:26.480> much<00:00:26.840> thinner<00:00:27.230> than<00:00:27.529> say<00:00:28.099> our<00:00:28.220> 35

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:28.519 
see it's much thinner than say our 35

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:30.669 
see it's much thinner than say our 35
millimeter<00:00:28.910> one<00:00:29.060> and<00:00:29.660> what<00:00:30.019> what<00:00:30.199> this<00:00:30.410> is

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:30.679 
millimeter one and what what this is

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:33.310 
millimeter one and what what this is
good<00:00:31.189> for<00:00:31.220> it's<00:00:31.760> a<00:00:32.029> 12<00:00:32.480> pounds<00:00:32.870> so<00:00:33.019> you<00:00:33.080> save<00:00:33.290> a

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320 
good for it's a 12 pounds so you save a

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.509 
good for it's a 12 pounds so you save a
couple<00:00:33.559> pounds<00:00:34.309> in<00:00:34.519> weight<00:00:34.670> and<00:00:36.220> for<00:00:37.220> what<00:00:37.400> it

00:00:37.509 --> 00:00:37.519 
couple pounds in weight and for what it

00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:39.520 
couple pounds in weight and for what it
is<00:00:37.549> for<00:00:38.089> a<00:00:38.150> low<00:00:38.449> power<00:00:38.690> system<00:00:39.080> it's<00:00:39.229> a<00:00:39.350> very

minute dropouts we use this motor on our
2000<00:00:59.360> to<00:00:59.780> 3000<00:01:00.199> watt<00:01:00.530> kits<00:01:00.799> and<00:01:01.040> these<00:01:01.729> motors

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
2000 to 3000 watt kits and these motors

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:03.939 
2000 to 3000 watt kits and these motors
are<00:01:02.089> actually<00:01:02.449> wound<00:01:02.689> for<00:01:03.140> the<00:01:03.320> actual

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:03.949 
are actually wound for the actual

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:05.950 
are actually wound for the actual
voltage<00:01:04.159> you'll<00:01:04.729> be<00:01:04.850> using<00:01:05.059> you<00:01:05.210> that<00:01:05.390> so<00:01:05.689> that

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
voltage you'll be using you that so that

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.630 
voltage you'll be using you that so that
that<00:01:06.140> makes<00:01:06.830> sure<00:01:06.920> you<00:01:07.159> have<00:01:07.189> the<00:01:07.460> peak

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
that makes sure you have the peak

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.030 
that makes sure you have the peak
efficiency<00:01:07.760> in<00:01:08.420> the<00:01:08.570> system<00:01:08.600> and<00:01:09.200> you<00:01:09.710> can<00:01:09.830> see

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
efficiency in the system and you can see

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.920 
efficiency in the system and you can see
that<00:01:10.220> we<00:01:10.310> have<00:01:10.400> our<00:01:10.430> new<00:01:10.970> custom<00:01:11.420> axles<00:01:11.840> that

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
that we have our new custom axles that

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.110 
that we have our new custom axles that
are<00:01:12.050> actually<00:01:12.380> 20%<00:01:12.680> stronger<00:01:13.190> and<00:01:13.550> thicker

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:14.120 
are actually 20% stronger and thicker

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.380 
are actually 20% stronger and thicker
than<00:01:14.930> before<00:01:15.470> for<00:01:15.680> our<00:01:15.740> new<00:01:15.980> our<00:01:16.550> new<00:01:16.940> versions

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
than before for our new our new versions

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.830 
than before for our new our new versions
so<00:01:18.110> this<00:01:18.380> is<00:01:18.560> actually<00:01:18.890> 14<00:01:19.280> millimeters<00:01:19.760> by<00:01:20.480> 10

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
so this is actually 14 millimeters by 10

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.830 
so this is actually 14 millimeters by 10
for<00:01:21.140> this<00:01:21.290> side<00:01:21.850> let's<00:01:22.850> just<00:01:23.060> make<00:01:23.300> sure<00:01:23.330> that

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
for this side let's just make sure that

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.090 
for this side let's just make sure that
you're<00:01:24.110> not<00:01:24.200> going<00:01:24.320> to<00:01:24.410> have<00:01:24.530> any<00:01:24.650> axle

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
you're not going to have any axle

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.490 
you're not going to have any axle
problems<00:01:25.400> are<00:01:25.460> going<00:01:25.550> to<00:01:25.610> break<00:01:25.730> axles<00:01:26.500> it's

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
problems are going to break axles it's

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:33.190 
problems are going to break axles it's
just<00:01:27.740> much<00:01:28.040> stronger<00:01:28.610> than<00:01:29.060> before<00:01:31.810> and<00:01:32.810> you

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
just much stronger than before and you

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.110 
just much stronger than before and you
can<00:01:33.320> also<00:01:33.440> see<00:01:33.740> actually<00:01:34.159> these<00:01:34.400> are<00:01:34.790> new<00:01:34.970> we

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:35.120 
can also see actually these are new we

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.360 
can also see actually these are new we
have<00:01:35.330> a<00:01:35.360> new<00:01:35.510> temp<00:01:35.930> sensors<00:01:36.350> and<00:01:36.650> new<00:01:37.070> high

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:37.370 
have a new temp sensors and new high

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.970 
have a new temp sensors and new high

they actually produce a little more
power<00:04:12.380> than<00:04:13.130> the<00:04:13.250> guild<00:04:13.459> of<00:04:13.549> stuff<00:04:13.790> just

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
power than the guild of stuff just

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:15.309 
power than the guild of stuff just
because<00:04:14.359> they<00:04:14.480> have<00:04:14.569> a<00:04:14.630> 5<00:04:14.870> to<00:04:15.019> 1<00:04:15.049> gear

00:04:15.309 --> 00:04:15.319 
because they have a 5 to 1 gear

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:17.289 
because they have a 5 to 1 gear
reduction<00:04:15.739> so<00:04:16.340> the<00:04:16.430> motor<00:04:16.609> is<00:04:16.760> always<00:04:17.060> in<00:04:17.209> the

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
reduction so the motor is always in the

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:19.210 
reduction so the motor is always in the
efficient<00:04:17.660> range<00:04:17.840> especially<00:04:18.380> for<00:04:19.130> the

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
efficient range especially for the

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:20.800 
efficient range especially for the
mid-range<00:04:19.549> so<00:04:20.090> they<00:04:20.209> have<00:04:20.299> really<00:04:20.510> good<00:04:20.599> power

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
mid-range so they have really good power

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.560 
mid-range so they have really good power
for<00:04:21.139> lower<00:04:21.530> wattage<00:04:22.430> for<00:04:22.760> the<00:04:22.880> system

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
for lower wattage for the system

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.030 
for lower wattage for the system
