00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.889 
650,000 students so the major problem
there<00:00:44.399> is<00:00:44.610> governance<00:00:45.480> and<00:00:46.100> that's<00:00:47.100> where

there is governance and that's where

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:50.450 
there is governance and that's where
there<00:00:48.899> are<00:00:48.989> many<00:00:49.020> problems<00:00:49.350> but<00:00:49.800> governing

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
there are many problems but governing

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.790 
there are many problems but governing

them<00:00:58.890> is<00:00:59.699> a<00:00:59.760> real<00:01:00.030> challenge<00:01:00.120> area<00:01:00.750> so

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
them is a real challenge area so

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.290 
them is a real challenge area so
governance<00:01:02.129> I<00:01:02.280> would<00:01:02.430> say<00:01:02.550> would<00:01:02.699> be<00:01:02.760> a<00:01:03.000> number

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
governance I would say would be a number

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.500 
governance I would say would be a number
one<00:01:03.480> problem<00:01:03.739> there<00:01:04.739> are<00:01:04.860> many<00:01:04.920> more<00:01:05.220> but<00:01:05.549> want

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.100 
campus with all the 525 colleges and 273
they<00:01:26.070> recognized<00:01:26.460> Institute's<00:01:27.000> when<00:01:27.600> we<00:01:27.810> have

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
they recognized Institute's when we have

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.499 
they recognized Institute's when we have
this<00:01:28.290> established<00:01:28.979> we<00:01:29.759> will<00:01:29.939> establish<00:01:30.090> that

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
this established we will establish that

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.660 
this established we will establish that
for<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.930> next<00:01:30.960> twelve<00:01:31.470> month<00:01:31.680> period<00:01:31.740> that

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
for the next twelve month period that

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.120 
for the next twelve month period that
would<00:01:32.939> change<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:34.140> level<00:01:34.409> of<00:01:34.470> governance<00:01:34.770> by

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
would change the level of governance by

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.420 
would change the level of governance by
a<00:01:35.159> factor<00:01:35.490> of<00:01:35.670> four<00:01:35.970> so<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:36.960> complete<00:01:37.619> change<00:01:38.130> is

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
a factor of four so a complete change is

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.819 
a factor of four so a complete change is
very<00:01:39.060> possible<00:01:39.329> and<00:01:39.960> that<00:01:40.259> is<00:01:40.500> going<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:40.770> be

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
very possible and that is going to be

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.160 
very possible and that is going to be
possible<00:01:41.280> only<00:01:41.490> with<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.210> use<00:01:42.390> of<00:01:42.420> advanced
