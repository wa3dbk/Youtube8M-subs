00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.370
 the story today is called the man 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:18.590
 of rain 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.590
 I know the little man from the rain 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.759
 he is a light lightweight man who lives 

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:25.759
 in the clouds 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:35.120
 lack of one cloud to another I want to join the 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.120
 soft and vaporous soil 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:43.010
 the clouds have many taps when 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:47.380
 the little man opens the taps 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.380
 clouds let the water fall on the earth 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:54.470
 when the little man closes the taps 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:56.420
 the rain stops has a lot of work on 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.760
 man if all the rains always 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:02.470
 opening and closing the taps and 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.470
 sometimes he gets tired 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:09.750
 When it is exhausted, it is pulled over a 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.860
 cloud falls asleep sleeps sleeps sleeps 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.590
 while having left all the 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.920
 open taps still raining without 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.920
 stop 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.390
 it's lucky that stronger thunder 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:25.880
 the others to wake up to 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:29.539
 little man gets up in a jump and 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:32.079
 exclaims me poor how long I've been 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:32.079
 asleep 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:39.130
 look down and see the towns the 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:42.870
 mountains and the gray and sad fields 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.870
 underwater that keeps falling 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:53.800
 then it starts to jump from a cloud to 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.800
 another quickly closing all the taps 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:03.310
 so the rain stops the wind pushes the 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:06.520
 clouds that move gently cradling 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:09.479
 the little man from the rain and this one 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.479

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:23.989

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.989
 cracked without a drop of water 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:33.000

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:35.210
