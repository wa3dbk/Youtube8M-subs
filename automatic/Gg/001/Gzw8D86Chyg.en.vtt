balances<00:01:31.380> on<00:01:31.770> them<00:01:32.280> so<00:01:32.579> it's<00:01:32.759> balanced<00:01:33.210> so

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
balances on them so it's balanced so

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.179 
balances on them so it's balanced so
almost<00:01:33.780> like<00:01:33.869> your<00:01:34.140> tires<00:01:34.439> so<00:01:34.799> that<00:01:34.950> when<00:01:35.070> it

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
almost like your tires so that when it

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.950 
almost like your tires so that when it
spins<00:01:35.490> really<00:01:35.880> fast<00:01:36.030> inside<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.810> food

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
spins really fast inside the food

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.469 
spins really fast inside the food
processor<00:01:37.500> it<00:01:37.770> stays<00:01:38.220> very<00:01:38.340> level<00:01:38.939> so<00:01:39.360> that

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
processor it stays very level so that

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.749 
processor it stays very level so that
you<00:01:39.570> always<00:01:39.810> get<00:01:40.079> consistent<00:01:40.740> shreds<00:01:41.369> and

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
you always get consistent shreds and

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.719 
you always get consistent shreds and
slices<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.560> way<00:01:43.710> to<00:01:43.770> use<00:01:44.280> this<00:01:44.490> is<00:01:44.700> you

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
slices and the way to use this is you

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.080 
slices and the way to use this is you
put<00:01:44.880> your<00:01:45.180> stem<00:01:45.780> adapter<00:01:46.350> onto<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:47.100> disc<00:01:47.369> push

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
put your stem adapter onto the disc push

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.149 
put your stem adapter onto the disc push
it<00:01:48.270> down<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:48.810> turn<00:01:49.320> it<00:01:49.350> to<00:01:49.530> lock<00:01:49.860> it<00:01:49.890> into

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159
