00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
getting everyone together for recording

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:13.159 
getting everyone together for recording
and<00:04:10.859> if<00:04:11.009> we<00:04:11.129> can<00:04:11.340> do<00:04:11.639> that<00:04:11.669> then<00:04:11.909> then<00:04:12.540> this

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:13.169 
and if we can do that then then this

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:15.439 
and if we can do that then then this
should<00:04:13.349> be<00:04:13.439> new<00:04:13.889> episodes<00:04:14.310> very<00:04:14.519> soon<00:04:14.729> and<00:04:14.939> I'm
