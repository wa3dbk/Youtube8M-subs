so I forgot to mention they made two

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.170 
so I forgot to mention they made two
versions<00:02:53.299> of<00:02:53.569> these<00:02:53.719> this<00:02:54.200> version<00:02:54.439> and<00:02:55.180> then

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
versions of these this version and then

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.250 
versions of these this version and then
they<00:02:56.269> came<00:02:56.359> over<00:02:56.599> with<00:02:56.750> a<00:02:56.810> later<00:02:56.989> version

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
they came over with a later version

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.059 
they came over with a later version
where<00:02:57.670> they<00:02:58.670> call<00:02:58.939> it<00:02:59.090> this<00:02:59.329> part<00:02:59.900> in<00:03:00.049> and<00:03:00.260> they

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:01.069 
where they call it this part in and they

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:02.649 
where they call it this part in and they
left<00:03:01.250> these<00:03:01.430> no<00:03:01.819> well<00:03:02.090> they<00:03:02.209> didn't<00:03:02.420> make<00:03:02.510> them

00:03:02.649 --> 00:03:02.659 
left these no well they didn't make them

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:15.069 
left these no well they didn't make them
white<00:03:03.700> they<00:03:04.840> came<00:03:05.840> out<00:03:05.959> it<00:03:06.260> look<00:03:06.409> like<00:03:06.590> this<00:03:14.079> so

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:15.079
