00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 all the good time of the day and how are you 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.049
 understood by the name of this video is not 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:11.010
 new vso and by clash of club 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:13.410
 and the thing is that after 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.100
 There was a new update if I'm not mistaken 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.170
 it happened 3 or 4 days ago 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:22.500
 that is, now I will show what I mean 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:26.300
 that is why there are no yearsplays for this 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.980
 the game, that is, look, I launch the game 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:32.759
 All things are loading in general, like 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.710
 all that is available update writes 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:39.030
 I got good news coming 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:42.420
 version of the game I click on the update then 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.719
 have me give out to the main page and 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:49.289
 come to my applications 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:51.809
 here it is a game I left on the autobahn 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.070
 scale line cleaned up fast update 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.270
 it doesn't matter that is here 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:01:00.500
 click update 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:03.449
 and the fact that jumped out so we press to update 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:07.020
 so think about it all such a thing u 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:13.560
 candles and become accept so and that we 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:17.400
 see went loading loading goes all 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:22.290
 it seems good yes everything is as it should be 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:24.270
 the download goes well as soon as the download 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:28.759
 comes to 60 percent 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:31.909
 she stops and then again 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:35.850
 spontaneously ie renews 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:36.420
 comes to 97 percent that is here 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.840
 look 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.880
 60 percent all she stopped then 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.960
 there is after some time about 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.829
 in seconds, probably 20 she 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.140
 automatically say 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.939
 restart ie without any 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:55.950
 my restart interventions 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:58.890
 restart itself and diana is downloading 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.649
 comes up to 97 percent and again 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:05.250
 hardens then she again 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:09.819
 restart and reach 99 percent 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:13.359
 that is, you see, it is restarted 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:16.030
 well and after 9 99 percent she again 

00:02:13.359 --> 00:02:19.480
 will restart sometimes reaches 100 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:22.900
 percent and will give error 960 I don't know 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:25.840
 what's the matter then there is what race you see 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.530
 she arbitrarily restarted asya nothing 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.819
 did not press 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:34.450
 it happened by itself itself 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:37.530
 great not the point in general I don't know what the 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:40.659
 error 960 what does it affect 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.730
 because of what she could be now 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:44.109
 many will tell you not enough space 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:48.340
 just let's go setup 

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:52.510
 a look that is not here there's memory 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:57.969
 i.e. the entire application is available inside 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:03:01.389
 throwing here application Ryazan is 529 

00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:04.199
 free 770 and a half divs so 

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:07.599
 memory is absolutely nothing to do with me 

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:10.510
 I just don't know why this is happening 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:12.329
 that is, here it is download deny 90 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:17.500
 percent and she became 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:23.349
 now it will restart itself again 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:26.829
 and it comes to 99 percent 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:30.549
 there is why this happens I don't know 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:34.030
 i.e. maybe i guess it may 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:37.180
 be due to emulator incompatibility 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:40.509
 android that is boys takes a player 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.530
 incompatible with my eset antivirus 

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:44.229
 nod32 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:46.509
 I don't know, maybe because of this 

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:49.419
 so I put this antivirus in me 

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:51.009
 somehow everything began to work badly i didn't 

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:52.780
 I know maybe I'll even have windows 

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:54.729
 reset because I don't know 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.459
 I like this thing I don't want it all 

00:03:54.729 --> 00:04:01.389
 supply that is see again 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:04.659
 Itself on the feast launched now on will 

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:08.049
 go up to 99 percent that is what 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:11.799
 case i just didn't know that what could 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:14.570
 influence i mean i emulator myself 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:17.790
 reinstalled several times that is 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:19.829
 tried to download other sites that's all 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:24.720
 honestly did not help all that 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:27.470
 the same thing is highlighted that is what it is 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:30.480
 I am not aware of a problem 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:33.150
 if you know please write in 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:36.440
 comments under this video i have this video 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:38.880
 I will send to all public contact 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:41.130
 maybe someone knows maybe someone came across 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:44.460
 with this problem what do i do not 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:47.520
 I know so here is 99 percent that is by the way 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:50.910
 with other games, too, nonsense you see 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:52.650
 let's not know from the center for example to 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:54.860
 vich for example let's try 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:05:00.450
 to establish 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:05:07.460
 so it is necessary and the clash began with a flash 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:11.540
 will understand the game so that is 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:14.370
 99 percent and everything is frozen that is 

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:18.150
 Now it will be restarted again. 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:20.190
 will reach 100 and give an error, that is, from 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:22.050
 what it can be for and how it can be 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:24.270
 be that is see not even 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:28.560
 restarted immediately unknown 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:30.630
 error when installing code 960 and if 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:33.360
 click refresh then all that storm is the same 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:35.460
 that is, I do not know it most likely 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.930
 problems with the emulator or with what I just 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:39.570
 did not put to give for example the same 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:42.440
 boevich we'll see that is so shifted 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:46.470
 it was 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:51.300
 I do not know before the update everything was fine 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:52.979
 nothing cute gala if there were not even 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.540
 I know in general by the way write in 

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:58.560
 comments if the game is removed and 

00:05:54.540 --> 00:06:00.780
 reinstall the whole progress of the game 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:03.060
 there is that is my village which she is 

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:05.490
 was not saved or all 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:08.100
 disappear, that is, you see as a boom scourge 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:11.520
 there are other games they reach 96 

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:15.120
 percent that is i don't know what it's like 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:18.650
 This and for some reason there is such a nonsense 

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:21.960
 the whole thing is happening in the emulator 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:25.800
 or in my antivirus I have no idea in 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:27.540
 What is it if someone someone 

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:30.420
 wondering the window seats 

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:34.440
 it's 8 and what's the problem I don't know that is 

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:35.160
 I did not delete anything and before upgrading to and 

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:37.310
 after the tour 

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:40.890
 basically the main really touched that is 

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:44.370
 because of what it is connected that is, I 

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:48.480
 I absolutely do not understand that so you see 

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:51.080
 girls percent and everything is so well 

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:53.460
 okay on this i think finish because 

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:57.020
 no sense to continue i think you 

00:06:53.460 --> 00:07:01.020
 You know what the problem is 

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:02.760
 update all downloads they just don't or 

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:04.920
 begin exactly does not begin here 

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:07.980
 see again she resumed then 

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:10.680
 I don't understand what the problem is 

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:12.990
 I don't know what to do if someone had 

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:15.030
 similar situation do you know how 

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:18.090
 help please write to 

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:21.290
 I think I'll try everything in the comments 

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:24.210
 options Viktorovna write because 

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:27.870
 if you think that he has surfaced 

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:31.770
 It is my fault that it is not so well 

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:32.520
 I think that 's all thanks to all for 

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:34.770

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:37.140
