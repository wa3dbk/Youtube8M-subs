00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.469
 and that's a challenge that buzze de phew 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.880
 right now his facebook usually I 

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:49.710
 do not calculate the challenge yourself because 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.359
 I find them useless and uninteresting 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.729
 but this one it is not dangerous there 

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:55.560
 bring a message to the community 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.229
 so this famous challenge called 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.820
 the challenge account in good French 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.920

 shit my accent in english you can 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.670
 to bask on it but not too much 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.679
 so you're seeing what this is 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.020
 famous challenge for people who do not 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.220
 would not know eh ben it's very 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.660
 simple I stand up to smell the very thing 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.150
 very quickly even 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.310
 you 're going to make up to look like a 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.080
 bogdanov you will film yourself and you will 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.760
 make a video montage where you go from 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.110
 bogdanov at prades pic here I have 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.940
 really took two extreme cases for 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.410
 to understand the thing well so 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.490
 how to get in like a puck 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.080
 Hanover so it's not necessarily 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.670
 how is bogdanov an example one 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.380
 agrees therefore bah you gonna buy you 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.880
 a felt at carrefour auchan and 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.710
 it was really a dunk dude you go 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.600
 go get for Pakistani who are going 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:41.640
 even below counter do you have to 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.440
 Achaetes you felt you remain silent seen as 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.850
 monosourcil you make yourself pimples 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.320
 of acne you dirty your teeth with 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.840
 nutella you make yourself a punk hairstyle 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:51.720
 you do what you want the goal is to 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:55.050
 ugly once you're well 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.010
 ugly you film yourself with your camera then 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.060
 once everything is filmed in short 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.790
 moment you sell clean face 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.530
 to make you a little beautiful and then you 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.450
 you movie when you're handsome and make a 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.740
 video editing to move from moosch to 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.510
 beautiful though a transaction 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.830
 I think I have been clearly now 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.600
 as I said it's a challenge that everything 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.310
 can realize because it is not dangerous 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.690
 just be a little handsome now 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.490
 if you're ugly but here's the message he 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.770
 not pass it's a pity and what's this 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:18.120
 famous message that must pass is 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:20.760
 do not judge a person on his 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.920
 physical because the physical changes 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.120
 it's true people imagine this big 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.440
 for example there are basically some temptations 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.570
 college that has crusts under the arms 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.180
 who sweated everything makes fun of him ben 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:32.130
 this is because he is at the ps and day 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.840
 he's tired of being insulted and 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.860
 said it's good I take it in hand I 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.840
 will pay attention to what I eat 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.190
 I 'm going to do sport I'm going to muscle 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.150
 and I will become a nice kid as 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.230
 after that I could tell people 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.450
 newedge 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.820
 you saw the little reference that passes 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.590
 cream like that you enjoyed it so here it is 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.060
 takes control of his hands he becomes super handsome 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.520
 kid and that's proven to them all 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.810
 world that we can change and that's 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.890
 true people are not doing too fast 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.420
 to make fun of someone that's already 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.190
 happened to make fun of a girl is 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.380
 today I regret pascal become 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.660
 super nice is made because I'm sure that 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.910
 will happen to you one day surely that you 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.110
 has already happened I do not know so 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.430
 that's what I like about this challenge 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.320
 is not dangerous he brings when 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.870
 even a message and I would like to go even 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:11.130
 a little further in this message because 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.420
 that it is true that it is easy to 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.010
 to make fun of someone with teeth 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.060
 through saying well here I play my 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.400
 bottle of beer to refresh me 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.519
 with your teeth it's easy to get 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.810
 mock a person 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.729
 and sometimes there are people who 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.500
 suffer because that's how I say 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:24.699
 we will take the example of this 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.590
 big fat person there is 

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:28.780
 genetics even if they play sports she 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:30.580
 can not seem to write to me 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.050
 time genetics she does not want your 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.819
 body it changes it's a shame there is 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:37.090
 people who suffer from it so 

00:04:33.819 --> 00:04:38.409
 learn how to say javan and and 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:38.830
 mock so learn to do the 

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:41.530
 difference 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.990
 I'm counting on you people but that's it 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:45.970
 learn frankly not too much 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:47.319
 make fun of that certain person because 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:50.110
 that there are some he can not bear 

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:52.000
 the cost is certainly not even 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.169
 suicide and would be unfortunate that you have 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.919
 a dead on the conscience because if 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:55.569
 she commits suicide 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:57.430
 it's as if you had killed him one is 

00:04:55.569 --> 00:04:58.900
 okay so I'm counting on you 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.789
 here I can even a little lesson of 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:03.729
 life on the ring lioret joe cada seen 

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:05.409
 like arrogant so that's what 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:06.880
 I like with this famous challenge and 

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:08.819
 I would also advise people 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.750
 who certainly live the mockery 

00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:12.460
 teach me her you 're trying to change 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.199
 the human body it can change 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.300
 usually it is rare that a person 

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:18.490
 is going to his genetic cause that can not 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:20.740
 change his body so take on yourself 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:22.330
 change your body shown that if you 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:25.810
 want to change 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:27.280
 and that's just closed the big 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:29.319
 mouth of all those people who got 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.940
 laughed at you so I do not know if there is 

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:32.469
 some people from the community of 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:34.509
 this ring community match who 

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:36.009
 fixa on a daily basis but at macge des 

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:37.449
 teenagers that often happens to 

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:39.009
 make fun of the physical is 

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:40.449
 so easy to criticize people 

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:41.889
 but that's me when I make fun of a 

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:43.300
 I do not care about myself 

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:44.650
 sometimes because criticize a 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.509
 nobody is easy 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:48.940
 but you must know before everything 

00:05:46.509 --> 00:05:50.380
 criticize oneself because nobody is 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:51.940
 perfect it is not possible we are not 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:53.620
 not all of them that's not possible 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.880
 to be perfect you can have a beautiful 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.259
 face cut to something else that bell 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.449
 to by anything and then as 

00:05:56.259 --> 00:06:00.070

 do not wish but here it is easy to 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.970
 make fun of a person so now 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:08.530
