Dan<00:01:27.530> really<00:01:27.800> stresses<00:01:28.280> because<00:01:28.580> we're<00:01:28.729> doing

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
Dan really stresses because we're doing

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.399 
Dan really stresses because we're doing
such<00:01:29.090> higher<00:01:29.299> frequency<00:01:29.810> and<00:01:29.930> higher<00:01:30.049> volume

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
such higher frequency and higher volume

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:32.590 
such higher frequency and higher volume
with<00:01:30.560> squats<00:01:30.920> the<00:01:31.549> goal<00:01:31.820> here<00:01:32.090> is<00:01:32.210> to<00:01:32.240> still

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
with squats the goal here is to still

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.240 
with squats the goal here is to still
work<00:01:32.750> heavy<00:01:33.050> but<00:01:33.320> not<00:01:33.350> to<00:01:33.649> the<00:01:33.770> point<00:01:33.979> where

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250

work heavy but not to the point where
you're<00:01:34.369> going<00:01:34.610> to<00:01:34.729> really<00:01:34.880> be<00:01:35.000> a<00:01:35.270> key<00:01:35.450> in<00:01:35.600> your

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
you're going to really be a key in your

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.540 
you're going to really be a key in your
knees<00:01:35.929> and<00:01:36.229> your<00:01:36.350> hips<00:01:36.530> so<00:01:37.130> this<00:01:37.310> is<00:01:37.399> gonna

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:37.550 
knees and your hips so this is gonna

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.010 
knees and your hips so this is gonna
take<00:01:37.789> a<00:01:37.820> little<00:01:37.970> bit<00:01:38.179> of<00:01:38.270> playing<00:01:38.479> around<00:01:38.780> with

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
take a little bit of playing around with

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.560 
take a little bit of playing around with
on<00:01:39.259> my<00:01:39.470> part<00:01:39.830> you<00:01:40.310> then<00:01:40.490> see<00:01:40.670> my<00:01:40.820> next<00:01:41.149> set<00:01:41.300> here

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
on my part you then see my next set here

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.450 
on my part you then see my next set here
this<00:01:41.720> is<00:01:41.869> a<00:01:41.899> 320<00:01:42.649> I<00:01:42.679> decided<00:01:43.039> to<00:01:43.130> go<00:01:43.220> ahead<00:01:43.280> and

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
this is a 320 I decided to go ahead and

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:44.529 
this is a 320 I decided to go ahead and
throw<00:01:43.610> in<00:01:43.700> the<00:01:43.729> belt<00:01:44.000> as<00:01:44.119> well

00:01:44.529 --> 00:01:44.539 
throw in the belt as well

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:46.570 
throw in the belt as well
these<00:01:44.960> felt<00:01:45.350> pretty<00:01:45.619> good<00:01:45.830> for<00:01:46.070> the<00:01:46.130> most<00:01:46.310> part

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:46.580 
these felt pretty good for the most part

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:47.649 
these felt pretty good for the most part
considering<00:01:46.970> we're<00:01:47.060> having<00:01:47.270> done<00:01:47.390> front

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
considering we're having done front

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:49.149 
considering we're having done front
squats<00:01:47.929> in<00:01:48.050> a<00:01:48.110> while<00:01:48.320> now<00:01:48.830> if<00:01:48.920> you<00:01:49.009> remember

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
squats in a while now if you remember

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:52.059 
squats in a while now if you remember
back<00:01:49.399> from<00:01:49.580> the<00:01:49.940> previous<00:01:50.420> cycle<00:01:50.840> of<00:01:50.960> PBS<00:01:51.350> M<00:01:51.590> we

00:01:52.059 --> 00:01:52.069 
back from the previous cycle of PBS M we

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:53.410 
back from the previous cycle of PBS M we
did<00:01:52.190> a<00:01:52.250> lot<00:01:52.399> of<00:01:52.429> front<00:01:52.670> squats<00:01:52.940> every

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
did a lot of front squats every

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.779 
did a lot of front squats every
Wednesday<00:01:54.050> however<00:01:54.740> when<00:01:55.159> I<00:01:55.190> got<00:01:55.429> to<00:01:55.580> about

00:01:55.779 --> 00:01:55.789 
Wednesday however when I got to about

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:57.940 
Wednesday however when I got to about
week<00:01:56.090> seven<00:01:56.600> or<00:01:56.750> eight<00:01:56.899> or<00:01:57.110> so<00:01:57.319> we<00:01:57.590> did<00:01:57.830> away

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
week seven or eight or so we did away

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.649 
week seven or eight or so we did away
with<00:01:58.100> those<00:01:58.399> and<00:01:58.670> just<00:01:58.700> did<00:01:59.000> more<00:01:59.149> back<00:01:59.330> squats

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
with those and just did more back squats

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:00.969 
with those and just did more back squats
so<00:01:59.899> it's<00:02:00.020> probably<00:02:00.319> been<00:02:00.470> about<00:02:00.649> a<00:02:00.710> month

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
so it's probably been about a month

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:02.320 
so it's probably been about a month
since<00:02:01.190> front<00:02:01.759> squats

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 
since front squats

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:03.999 
since front squats
I<00:02:02.360> then<00:02:02.840> decided<00:02:03.080> to<00:02:03.200> go<00:02:03.319> one<00:02:03.500> more<00:02:03.679> set<00:02:03.979> here

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:04.009 
I then decided to go one more set here

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:06.999 
I then decided to go one more set here
did<00:02:04.429> 340<00:02:05.119> again<00:02:05.360> for<00:02:05.569> three<00:02:05.750> reps<00:02:05.959> this<00:02:06.590> felt

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
did 340 again for three reps this felt

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:08.830 
did 340 again for three reps this felt
really<00:02:07.280> heavy<00:02:07.520> to<00:02:07.729> me<00:02:07.880> although<00:02:08.360> looking<00:02:08.690> at

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
really heavy to me although looking at

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.630 
really heavy to me although looking at
it<00:02:09.020> on<00:02:09.259> film<00:02:09.649> right<00:02:09.860> here<00:02:10.099> it<00:02:10.250> looks<00:02:10.399> like<00:02:10.459> it

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
it on film right here it looks like it

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.430 
it on film right here it looks like it
goes<00:02:10.759> pretty<00:02:11.000> well<00:02:11.150> so<00:02:11.840> I<00:02:11.870> probably<00:02:12.140> could

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
goes pretty well so I probably could

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.660 
goes pretty well so I probably could
have<00:02:12.470> upped<00:02:12.800> the<00:02:12.950> weight<00:02:12.980> a<00:02:13.160> little<00:02:13.550> bit

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
have upped the weight a little bit

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.339 
have upped the weight a little bit
better<00:02:13.849> I<00:02:14.180> also<00:02:14.660> need<00:02:14.900> to<00:02:14.930> do<00:02:15.020> a<00:02:15.050> little<00:02:15.170> bit

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:15.349 
better I also need to do a little bit

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:17.260 
better I also need to do a little bit
better<00:02:15.620> job<00:02:15.890> my<00:02:16.340> elbows<00:02:16.670> up<00:02:16.849> but<00:02:17.030> that's<00:02:17.180> a

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
better job my elbows up but that's a

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:18.400 
better job my elbows up but that's a
right<00:02:17.450> just<00:02:17.690> something<00:02:17.900> that<00:02:17.930> will<00:02:18.080> come<00:02:18.230> with

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
right just something that will come with

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.280 
right just something that will come with
it<00:02:18.590> as<00:02:18.709> more<00:02:19.010> time<00:02:19.250> goes<00:02:19.489> by<00:02:20.110> alright<00:02:21.110> so<00:02:21.200> that

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
it as more time goes by alright so that

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:22.630

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
set of seven to 10 reps so I worked up

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.190 
set of seven to 10 reps so I worked up
to<00:02:30.950> a<00:02:30.980> set<00:02:31.280> of<00:02:31.310> 84<00:02:31.879> 10<00:02:32.090> towards<00:02:32.450> that<00:02:32.660> 10th<00:02:32.930> rep

we<00:02:33.650> got<00:02:33.770> a<00:02:33.800> little<00:02:33.980> bit<00:02:34.160> tough<00:02:34.340> so<00:02:34.489> I<00:02:34.550> decided

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849 
we got a little bit tough so I decided

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:36.640 
we got a little bit tough so I decided
to<00:02:34.940> call<00:02:35.120> it<00:02:35.270> there<00:02:35.480> I<00:02:35.690> think<00:02:36.140> my<00:02:36.290> progression

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
to call it there I think my progression

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.339 
to call it there I think my progression
was<00:02:36.890> 40<00:02:37.340> 60<00:02:37.580> 80<00:02:38.000> however<00:02:38.870> if<00:02:39.020> you<00:02:39.110> want<00:02:39.319> to

the 15-pound and do 3 sets of 10 to 12

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:56.290 
the 15-pound and do 3 sets of 10 to 12
reps<00:02:53.900> so<00:02:54.470> I<00:02:54.500> dropped<00:02:54.800> it<00:02:54.920> down<00:02:55.010> to<00:02:55.069> 65<00:02:55.760> and<00:02:56.120> did

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
reps so I dropped it down to 65 and did

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.420 
reps so I dropped it down to 65 and did
three<00:02:56.599> sets<00:02:56.840> of<00:02:57.050> twelve<00:02:57.379> you're<00:02:57.920> only<00:02:58.129> seeing

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
three sets of twelve you're only seeing

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.300 
three sets of twelve you're only seeing
the<00:02:58.580> first<00:02:59.000> actual<00:02:59.629> set<00:02:59.930> here<00:03:00.290> only

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
the first actual set here only

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:02.830 
the first actual set here only
honestly<00:03:01.910> it<00:03:01.970> would<00:03:02.060> be<00:03:02.150> the<00:03:02.270> same<00:03:02.450> thing<00:03:02.630> over

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
honestly it would be the same thing over

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:09.010 
honestly it would be the same thing over
and<00:03:03.050> over<00:03:03.170> again<00:03:07.239> okay<00:03:08.239> so<00:03:08.300> from<00:03:08.660> here<00:03:08.840> we

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.020 
and over again okay so from here we

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.630 
and over again okay so from here we
moved<00:03:09.200> on<00:03:09.349> to<00:03:09.380> standing<00:03:09.950> dumbbell<00:03:10.190> lateral

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
moved on to standing dumbbell lateral

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.940 
moved on to standing dumbbell lateral
raises<00:03:11.030> and<00:03:11.330> for<00:03:11.569> these<00:03:11.720> I<00:03:12.080> like<00:03:12.620> to<00:03:12.680> use

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
raises and for these I like to use

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:14.440 
raises and for these I like to use
little<00:03:13.280> girl<00:03:13.459> weights<00:03:13.700> now<00:03:13.880> blame<00:03:14.120> it<00:03:14.239> on<00:03:14.300> my

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
little girl weights now blame it on my

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.540 
little girl weights now blame it on my
CrossFit<00:03:14.720> label<00:03:15.230> shoes<00:03:15.500> if<00:03:15.680> you<00:03:15.770> will<00:03:15.980> but

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:16.550 
CrossFit label shoes if you will but

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:17.979 
CrossFit label shoes if you will but
these<00:03:16.730> are<00:03:16.849> just<00:03:16.970> 20-pound<00:03:17.510> weights<00:03:17.810> you're

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
these are just 20-pound weights you're

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:20.020 
these are just 20-pound weights you're
seeing<00:03:18.230> here<00:03:18.500> I<00:03:18.650> find<00:03:19.190> these<00:03:19.370> go<00:03:19.550> a<00:03:19.580> lot<00:03:19.819> better

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
seeing here I find these go a lot better

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.640 
seeing here I find these go a lot better
so<00:03:20.239> I<00:03:20.269> get<00:03:20.480> a<00:03:20.510> better<00:03:20.569> feel<00:03:21.019> in<00:03:21.200> the<00:03:21.260> shoulders

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
so I get a better feel in the shoulders

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.830 
so I get a better feel in the shoulders
again<00:03:22.099> I'm<00:03:22.250> all<00:03:22.340> about<00:03:22.489> them<00:03:22.700> feels<00:03:23.060> because

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
again I'm all about them feels because

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.839 
again I'm all about them feels because
if<00:03:23.959> I<00:03:24.050> go<00:03:24.200> really<00:03:24.410> heavy<00:03:24.680> on<00:03:24.830> these<00:03:25.190> I<00:03:25.430> tend<00:03:25.790> to

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:25.849 
if I go really heavy on these I tend to

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:27.880 
if I go really heavy on these I tend to
use<00:03:25.910> a<00:03:26.060> lot<00:03:26.360> more<00:03:26.569> body<00:03:26.900> English<00:03:27.170> so<00:03:27.560> to<00:03:27.620> say

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
use a lot more body English so to say

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:29.410 
use a lot more body English so to say
and<00:03:28.370> it<00:03:28.459> becomes<00:03:28.700> almost<00:03:29.000> somewhat<00:03:29.239> of<00:03:29.360> a

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
and it becomes almost somewhat of a

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:30.280 
and it becomes almost somewhat of a
compound<00:03:29.810> lift

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
compound lift

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.410 
compound lift
now<00:03:30.650> for<00:03:30.890> this<00:03:31.069> he<00:03:31.190> called<00:03:31.400> for<00:03:31.610> three<00:03:31.940> sets<00:03:32.209> of

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
now for this he called for three sets of

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.080 
now for this he called for three sets of
15<00:03:32.660> to<00:03:33.170> 20<00:03:33.500> reps<00:03:33.739> so<00:03:34.370> toward<00:03:34.640> the<00:03:34.730> twentieth

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
15 to 20 reps so toward the twentieth

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:36.430 
15 to 20 reps so toward the twentieth
rep<00:03:35.269> here<00:03:35.480> I<00:03:35.510> wasn't<00:03:35.780> really<00:03:35.900> getting<00:03:36.080> burned

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
rep here I wasn't really getting burned

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:37.930 
rep here I wasn't really getting burned
out<00:03:36.590> got<00:03:36.890> a<00:03:36.920> really<00:03:37.160> good<00:03:37.310> burn<00:03:37.549> in<00:03:37.850> my

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
out got a really good burn in my

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.820 
out got a really good burn in my
shoulders<00:03:38.299> but<00:03:38.930> it<00:03:39.019> was<00:03:39.140> good<00:03:39.290> overall<00:03:39.380> I<00:03:39.650> just

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:39.830 
shoulders but it was good overall I just

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:41.830 
shoulders but it was good overall I just
kept<00:03:40.190> it<00:03:40.340> static<00:03:40.760> with<00:03:40.880> 20<00:03:41.180> pounds<00:03:41.330> this<00:03:41.630> time

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
kept it static with 20 pounds this time

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.140 
kept it static with 20 pounds this time
I'll<00:03:42.110> likely<00:03:42.350> bump<00:03:42.739> it<00:03:42.830> up<00:03:42.890> a<00:03:43.069> little<00:03:43.310> bit<00:03:43.580> for

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
I'll likely bump it up a little bit for

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.789 
I'll likely bump it up a little bit for
the<00:03:44.269> next<00:03:44.510> time<00:03:44.600> I<00:03:44.690> do<00:03:44.840> this<00:03:45.110> the<00:03:45.319> following

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:45.799 
the next time I do this the following

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:49.330 
the next time I do this the following
week<00:03:47.319> alright<00:03:48.319> and<00:03:48.500> that's<00:03:48.739> gonna<00:03:48.950> wrap<00:03:49.190> up

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
week alright and that's gonna wrap up

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.280 
week alright and that's gonna wrap up
the<00:03:49.489> shoulder<00:03:49.849> work<00:03:50.000> so<00:03:50.209> all-in-all<00:03:50.450> I<00:03:50.989> did

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
the shoulder work so all-in-all I did

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.259 
the shoulder work so all-in-all I did
roughly<00:03:51.739> around<00:03:51.860> 9<00:03:52.280> sets<00:03:52.670> if<00:03:52.910> you<00:03:53.000> count

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:53.269 
roughly around 9 sets if you count

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:55.059 
roughly around 9 sets if you count
working<00:03:53.660> up<00:03:53.810> to<00:03:53.930> that<00:03:53.959> heavy<00:03:54.230> set<00:03:54.530> the<00:03:54.769> first

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:55.069 
working up to that heavy set the first

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:57.250 
working up to that heavy set the first
exercise<00:03:55.580> and<00:03:56.030> that<00:03:56.450> brought<00:03:56.690> us<00:03:56.840> on<00:03:57.019> to

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
exercise and that brought us on to

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.229 
exercise and that brought us on to
standing<00:03:57.799> alternating<00:03:58.459> dumbbell<00:03:58.640> curls

00:03:59.229 --> 00:03:59.239 
standing alternating dumbbell curls

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:00.640 
standing alternating dumbbell curls
which<00:03:59.420> again<00:03:59.690> is<00:03:59.989> something<00:04:00.290> I<00:04:00.380> haven't<00:04:00.500> done

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
which again is something I haven't done

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.490 
which again is something I haven't done
in<00:04:00.920> months<00:04:01.370> so<00:04:01.580> the<00:04:02.120> program<00:04:02.480> called<00:04:02.780> for<00:04:03.049> 3

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
in months so the program called for 3

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.130 
in months so the program called for 3
sets<00:04:03.769> of<00:04:04.010> 10<00:04:04.220> to<00:04:04.370> 12<00:04:04.580> reps<00:04:04.849> per<00:04:05.180> arm<00:04:05.450> so<00:04:06.079> I

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:06.140 
sets of 10 to 12 reps per arm so I

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:07.270 
sets of 10 to 12 reps per arm so I
decided<00:04:06.440> to<00:04:06.500> start<00:04:06.709> a<00:04:06.769> little<00:04:06.799> bit<00:04:07.040> light

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
decided to start a little bit light

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.650 
decided to start a little bit light
again<00:04:07.579> and<00:04:07.609> equally<00:04:08.090> know<00:04:08.209> where<00:04:08.420> to<00:04:08.510> go<00:04:08.630> on

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
again and equally know where to go on

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.530 
again and equally know where to go on
this<00:04:08.989> so<00:04:09.350> started<00:04:09.709> with<00:04:09.859> 35<00:04:10.310> here<00:04:10.700> however<00:04:11.239> in

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
this so started with 35 here however in

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.420 
this so started with 35 here however in
this<00:04:11.660> case<00:04:11.900> I<00:04:12.049> did<00:04:12.230> bump<00:04:12.470> the<00:04:12.620> weight<00:04:12.769> up<00:04:12.920> by<00:04:13.130> 5

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
this case I did bump the weight up by 5

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.610 
this case I did bump the weight up by 5
pounds<00:04:13.910> for<00:04:14.030> each<00:04:14.209> separately<00:04:14.570> set<00:04:15.109> so<00:04:15.380> I<00:04:15.440> did

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
pounds for each separately set so I did

chin-ups price she's working on a range
of<00:04:53.099> motion<00:04:53.369> here<00:04:53.400> but<00:04:53.699> to<00:04:53.789> be<00:04:53.879> honest<00:04:54.210> I<00:04:54.330> was

00:04:54.499 --> 00:04:54.509 
of motion here but to be honest I was

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:56.510 
of motion here but to be honest I was
really<00:04:54.779> burnt<00:04:55.050> out<00:04:55.199> by<00:04:55.409> this<00:04:55.469> time<00:04:55.770> and<00:04:56.069> I

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
really burnt out by this time and I

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.489 
really burnt out by this time and I
wanted<00:04:56.819> to<00:04:56.909> just<00:04:57.059> get<00:04:57.210> out<00:04:57.389> so<00:04:57.719> that<00:04:58.229> probably

00:04:58.489 --> 00:04:58.499 
wanted to just get out so that probably

00:04:58.499 --> 00:04:59.959 
wanted to just get out so that probably
led<00:04:58.649> to<00:04:58.800> be<00:04:58.949> shorting<00:04:59.369> some<00:04:59.520> of<00:04:59.610> the<00:04:59.699> range<00:04:59.849> of

00:04:59.959 --> 00:04:59.969 
led to be shorting some of the range of

00:04:59.969 --> 00:05:01.309 
led to be shorting some of the range of
motion<00:05:00.119> on<00:05:00.419> this<00:05:00.569> I<00:05:00.719> think<00:05:00.779> I<00:05:00.990> ended<00:05:01.199> up

00:05:01.309 --> 00:05:01.319 
motion on this I think I ended up

00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:03.170 
motion on this I think I ended up
getting<00:05:01.469> 20<00:05:01.919> reps<00:05:02.159> when<00:05:02.669> it's<00:05:02.819> all<00:05:02.909> said<00:05:03.149> and
