00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.990
 if you dream of studying your degree or 

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:07.660
 your post degree in one of the big ones 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:10.209
 universities of the world is likely to 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:12.339
 you have heard more than one rumor about 

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:15.099
 difficult how complicated you can achieve 

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:17.170
 what can it be to achieve study in 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:20.199
 these universities one of the rumors 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:23.730
 that is surely heard is the one 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:26.169
 you need to have a lot of money to be able to 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.710
 finance your studies in these 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:32.140
 great universities programs 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:35.290
 they have their own resources for scholarships 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.630
 or fund the studies of many of 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.820
 his students also exist 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:42.060
 institutions and organisms 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.560
 international national organizations 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:46.750
 foundations that can help you 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.760
 finance your studies the truth is that 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.980
 the most difficult thing is getting admission 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.530
 and once you have your letter of 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.600
 admission is from a large university going to 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.090
 have mechanisms that help you not to 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:01.360
 you stay without going to study to that place 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:03.850
 for a money issue for example in my 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.140
 case I studied a master's degree in 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.750
 Harvard University 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.610
 and receive grant from the 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.680
 harvard university and also by 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.409
 part of the harvard foundation of mexico 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:17.140
 to another rumor that you might have 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:19.119
 heard before is believing 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.920
 that in order to achieve admission to 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:23.830
 these programs you need to be a genius 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.800
 the truth is that you do not need to have 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:29.530
 good academic credentials do you need 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:32.680
 also have talent but above all is 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:35.560
 a hard work perseverance issue 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.750
 and focus that you maintain that you have 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.520
 Of course you want to be clear about what 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.070
 is what you want to achieve with your 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.710
 studies and that you can also try it at 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.570
 admissions committee and that you know that 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.910
 Well, you also have to try 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.520
 how are you going to have an impact with the 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:53.080
 studies that you're going to get another rumor 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.810
 it may also be that you have 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.759
 heard that you need to have a letter 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.369
 of recommendation from someone very well known 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:02.619
 or important or levers to achieve 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.869
 enter these programs and neither is 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:06.729
 true what you do need are good 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.459
 letters of recommendation from people who 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:10.990
 know that excite the committee of 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:13.480
 admissions on your group 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:16.840
 action and to help you show why 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.240
 you must be someone worthwhile 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.950
 admit to these programs you do not need 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.770
 levers many times it turns up 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.510
 counterproductive that you go and say good 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.000
 maybe my dad knows such a person 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.460
 or I know the governor of such place 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.620
 and I will go and ask for a letter and 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.600
 it turns out that the governor or the 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.060
 your dad's friend who does not really 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.700
 you know you can not really say something 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:42.790
 that distinguishes you from other candidates 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:46.120
 and in the end he is doing a favor and that 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:49.090
 it shows in the application another rumor that 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.410
 it also exists out there is that believing 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.660
 if you want to study a graduate 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.040
 especially if it's a graduate degree in a 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.010
 professional school 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:59.020
 you need several years of experience there 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.270
 many many programs if they are going to 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:03.550
 ask as a requirement a certain number of 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:05.710
 years of experience but most do not 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.300
 even those who ask you there is a 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:09.940
 big difference between experience 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.740
 work or years of experience and 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.630
 relevant experience you what 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.340
 you need is to have relevant experience 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.730
 that has to do with what you want 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.550
 make me show you like a 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:23.310
 and talented to show and support your 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.540
 narrative and this and this you can 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.060
 get in various ways not 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:30.540
 it necessarily has to be accumulating 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:33.110
 time is in a job that's not what 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:37.769
 which means relevant experience 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:39.420
 there are many other rumors and what 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:42.019
 important is that you know that at the end of 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:45.540
 accounts what matters is that you have 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:47.579
 that you have the energy the faith in yourself 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.980
 to say I want this this is a 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:53.160
 I have a dream and it's something I can 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:55.530
 I get the process is difficult is 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.959
 very competitive obviously the big 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.269
 universities attract the best to the 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:03.239
 best students from around the world and 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:05.459
 therefore the competition is not nothing 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:07.290
 more is from other very good students 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:09.150
 but many of them are very 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:12.269
 sophisticated in their way of applying 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:14.400
 then that is difficult but that the 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:16.650
 rumors that exist that do not stop you 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.760
 to get what you want 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.199
 you have to have you have to have 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.600
 perseverance you have to have 

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:23.850
 discipline you have to 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.860
 very clear what do you want and the 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.440
 goals and you have to also be very 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:30.150
 smart in the way that
