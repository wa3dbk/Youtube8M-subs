00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
don't know if it's necessarily a growing

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.710 
don't know if it's necessarily a growing
game<00:04:36.900> and<00:04:37.080> it's<00:04:37.200> certainly<00:04:37.410> a<00:04:37.500> small<00:04:37.830> game<00:04:38.100> and

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
game and it's certainly a small game and

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.210 
game and it's certainly a small game and
one<00:04:39.720> idea<00:04:40.110> that's<00:04:40.320> been<00:04:40.380> floating<00:04:40.650> around<00:04:40.860> in

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
one idea that's been floating around in

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.670 
one idea that's been floating around in
my<00:04:41.250> head<00:04:41.400> for<00:04:41.639> a<00:04:42.599> while<00:04:42.690> is<00:04:43.110> that<00:04:43.410> I<00:04:43.440> would

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
my head for a while is that I would

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.219 
my head for a while is that I would
personally<00:04:44.130> like<00:04:44.639> to<00:04:45.360> see<00:04:45.660> don't<00:04:45.930> owe<00:04:46.050> more<00:04:46.169> to

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:46.229 
personally like to see don't owe more to

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:49.040 
personally like to see don't owe more to
retribution<00:04:46.740> become<00:04:47.310> free<00:04:47.580> to<00:04:47.700> play<00:04:47.930> this<00:04:48.930> is

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
retribution become free to play this is

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.140 
retribution become free to play this is
a<00:04:49.080> bit<00:04:49.260> of<00:04:49.349> a<00:04:49.440> radical<00:04:49.620> idea

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
a bit of a radical idea

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.290 
a bit of a radical idea
right<00:04:52.020> now<00:04:52.170> it's<00:04:52.320> at<00:04:52.440> a<00:04:52.610> 2999<00:04:53.610> price<00:04:54.030> point

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
right now it's at a 2999 price point

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:55.550 
right now it's at a 2999 price point
which<00:04:54.480> I<00:04:54.600> think<00:04:54.780> it's<00:04:54.900> I<00:04:55.050> believe<00:04:55.140> that<00:04:55.470> was

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
which I think it's I believe that was

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.620 
which I think it's I believe that was
the<00:04:55.590> original<00:04:55.890> price<00:04:56.550> when<00:04:57.060> it<00:04:57.180> came<00:04:57.360> out<00:04:57.480> on

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
the original price when it came out on

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.170 
the original price when it came out on
day<00:04:57.780> one<00:04:58.020> and<00:04:58.820> although<00:04:59.820> I<00:05:00.120> personally

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
day one and although I personally

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.450 
day one and although I personally
believe<00:05:00.600> the<00:05:01.080> game<00:05:01.260> is<00:05:01.470> worth<00:05:01.680> much<00:05:02.130> more<00:05:02.160> than

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
believe the game is worth much more than

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.330 
believe the game is worth much more than
thirty<00:05:03.090> dollars<00:05:03.510> it's<00:05:04.230> a<00:05:04.710> lot<00:05:04.860> more<00:05:04.890> difficult

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 
thirty dollars it's a lot more difficult

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.470 
thirty dollars it's a lot more difficult
to<00:05:05.430> convince<00:05:06.030> the<00:05:06.710> the<00:05:07.710> general<00:05:08.220> public<00:05:09.090> that

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:09.480 
to convince the the general public that

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.930 
to convince the the general public that
it<00:05:09.660> is<00:05:10.010> so<00:05:11.010> I<00:05:11.040> think<00:05:11.160> one<00:05:11.580> thing<00:05:11.610> that<00:05:11.760> would

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 
it is so I think one thing that would

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.170 
it is so I think one thing that would
just<00:05:12.120> really<00:05:12.540> help<00:05:12.810> to<00:05:12.870> kind<00:05:13.440> of<00:05:13.730> bring<00:05:14.730> in<00:05:14.940> an

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180 
just really help to kind of bring in an

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.090 
just really help to kind of bring in an
influx<00:05:15.510> of<00:05:15.690> new<00:05:15.750> blood<00:05:16.080> as<00:05:16.350> if<00:05:16.500> the<00:05:16.860> game

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:17.100 
influx of new blood as if the game

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.940 
influx of new blood as if the game
actually<00:05:17.400> went<00:05:18.120> free-to-play<00:05:18.510> I<00:05:19.110> don't

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:19.950 
actually went free-to-play I don't

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:21.500 
actually went free-to-play I don't
imagine<00:05:20.220> that<00:05:20.550> the<00:05:20.670> game<00:05:20.850> is<00:05:21.030> actually<00:05:21.180> making

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:21.510 
imagine that the game is actually making

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:24.110 
imagine that the game is actually making
that<00:05:21.720> much<00:05:21.900> money<00:05:21.930> from<00:05:22.530> these<00:05:23.070> sales<00:05:23.610> of<00:05:23.940> the

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 
that much money from these sales of the

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.840 
that much money from these sales of the
game<00:05:24.270> itself<00:05:24.540> at<00:05:24.720> 2999<00:05:25.530> and<00:05:25.980> I<00:05:26.430> think<00:05:26.670> if<00:05:26.760> the

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:26.850 
game itself at 2999 and I think if the

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:28.460 
game itself at 2999 and I think if the
game<00:05:27.000> was<00:05:27.120> actually<00:05:27.450> featured<00:05:27.810> on<00:05:28.050> steam's

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:28.470 
game was actually featured on steam's

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:31.790 
game was actually featured on steam's
free-to-play<00:05:29.130> section<00:05:30.290> and<00:05:31.290> if<00:05:31.440> they<00:05:31.590> just

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 
free-to-play section and if they just

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.430 
free-to-play section and if they just
decided<00:05:32.550> to<00:05:32.790> make<00:05:33.060> money<00:05:33.270> through<00:05:33.510> the<00:05:33.900> any

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:34.440 
decided to make money through the any

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:39.710 
decided to make money through the any
DLC<00:05:35.370> sales<00:05:35.610> that<00:05:35.790> would<00:05:35.910> come<00:05:36.590> following<00:05:38.720> the

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:39.720 
DLC sales that would come following the

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:40.880 
DLC sales that would come following the
release<00:05:39.750> of<00:05:40.080> the<00:05:40.230> game<00:05:40.260> for<00:05:40.560> you<00:05:40.620> to<00:05:40.650> play<00:05:40.710> I

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:40.890 
release of the game for you to play I

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:42.170 
release of the game for you to play I
think<00:05:41.040> they<00:05:41.280> can<00:05:41.430> actually<00:05:41.700> make<00:05:41.850> more<00:05:42.030> money

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:42.180 
think they can actually make more money

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:44.060 
think they can actually make more money
that<00:05:42.300> way<00:05:42.480> that<00:05:43.350> and<00:05:43.620> I<00:05:43.650> think<00:05:43.680> it<00:05:43.980> would

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:44.070 
that way that and I think it would

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:47.330 
that way that and I think it would
probably<00:05:44.610> be<00:05:44.880> basically<00:05:45.810> the<00:05:46.020> best<00:05:46.200> thing<00:05:46.500> for

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:47.340 
probably be basically the best thing for

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:49.610 
probably be basically the best thing for
the<00:05:47.550> elite<00:05:47.970> four<00:05:48.180> well<00:05:48.780> don't<00:05:48.990> of<00:05:49.170> war<00:05:49.290> two<00:05:49.470> in

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:49.620 
the elite four well don't of war two in

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:53.000 
the elite four well don't of war two in
general<00:05:50.040> as<00:05:50.220> far<00:05:50.790> as<00:05:50.910> the<00:05:51.090> any<00:05:51.870> future<00:05:52.410> growth

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:53.010 
general as far as the any future growth

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:56.480 
general as far as the any future growth
that<00:05:53.850> the<00:05:54.000> community<00:05:54.360> might<00:05:54.630> have<00:05:55.370> and<00:05:56.370> then

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:56.490 
that the community might have and then

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:58.670 
that the community might have and then
the<00:05:56.640> last<00:05:56.820> thing<00:05:57.030> that<00:05:57.390> I<00:05:58.020> would<00:05:58.140> like<00:05:58.260> to<00:05:58.380> say

00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:58.680
