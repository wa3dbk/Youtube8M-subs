this<00:00:27.330> particular<00:00:27.779> shot<00:00:28.019> and<00:00:28.199> how<00:00:28.260> he

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
this particular shot and how he

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.349 
this particular shot and how he
approaches<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:29.189> Oscar<00:00:29.640> pond<00:00:29.880> his<00:00:30.090> lighter

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
and their bullet holes in the window so

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.420 
and their bullet holes in the window so
he<00:00:33.449> probably<00:00:33.660> shot<00:00:34.019> them<00:00:34.230> now<00:00:34.650> I<00:00:34.680> think<00:00:34.860> that

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
he probably shot them now I think that

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.820 
he probably shot them now I think that
you<00:00:35.610> guys<00:00:35.820> might<00:00:36.030> need<00:00:36.330> a<00:00:36.390> better<00:00:36.840> explanation

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:37.830 
you guys might need a better explanation

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:39.740 
you guys might need a better explanation
and<00:00:37.920> I've<00:00:38.430> actually<00:00:38.549> came<00:00:39.000> up<00:00:39.030> with<00:00:39.210> a<00:00:39.420> theory

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
and I've actually came up with a theory

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.039 
and I've actually came up with a theory
of<00:00:39.900> my<00:00:40.409> theory<00:00:40.769> which<00:00:40.949> is<00:00:41.210> why<00:00:42.210> exactly<00:00:42.750> Harry

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:43.049 
of my theory which is why exactly Harry

00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:45.170 
of my theory which is why exactly Harry
ambushes<00:00:43.830> or<00:00:44.040> scorp<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:44.549> will<00:00:44.820> he<00:00:45.030> actually

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
ambushes or scorp and will he actually

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.840 
ambushes or scorp and will he actually
end<00:00:45.540> up<00:00:45.750> in<00:00:46.019> the<00:00:46.199> Ravencroft<00:00:46.620> now<00:00:47.040> well<00:00:47.460> the

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
end up in the Ravencroft now well the

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.430 
end up in the Ravencroft now well the
second<00:00:48.210> question<00:00:48.540> is<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.720> lot<00:00:49.049> of<00:00:49.170> people

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
second question is a lot of people

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.750 
second question is a lot of people
actually<00:00:49.530> think<00:00:49.979> that<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.430> amazing

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
actually think that the amazing

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.549 
actually think that the amazing
experiment<00:00:51.269> 2<00:00:51.360> is<00:00:51.479> going<00:00:51.690> to<00:00:51.780> end<00:00:52.049> with<00:00:52.290> Harry

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
experiment 2 is going to end with Harry

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.740 
experiment 2 is going to end with Harry

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:00.330 
clawed belongs to Oscorp and it's a sort

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.570 
clawed belongs to Oscorp and it's a sort
of<00:01:00.390> an<00:01:00.540> experimental<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.470> prison<00:01:01.949> where<00:01:02.190> all

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:02.580 
of an experimental a prison where all

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.759 
of an experimental a prison where all
skorpa<00:01:03.150> experiment<00:01:04.049> on<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.320> prisoners

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
skorpa experiment on the prisoners

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.310 
skorpa experiment on the prisoners
actually<00:01:05.489> all<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.880> buildings<00:01:06.270> they<00:01:06.930> do<00:01:06.990> some

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
actually all the buildings they do some

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.740 
actually all the buildings they do some
nasty<00:01:07.619> experiments<00:01:08.460> with<00:01:08.580> them<00:01:08.790> so<00:01:09.299> at<00:01:09.420> first

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
nasty experiments with them so at first

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.510 
nasty experiments with them so at first
I<00:01:10.050> thought<00:01:10.410> that<00:01:10.470> it<00:01:10.830> doesn't<00:01:11.190> really<00:01:11.340> make

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
I thought that it doesn't really make

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.700 
I thought that it doesn't really make
sense<00:01:11.580> why<00:01:12.330> Harry<00:01:12.660> should<00:01:12.990> end<00:01:13.230> up<00:01:13.470> at

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
sense why Harry should end up at

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.910 
sense why Harry should end up at
Ravencroft<00:01:14.420> after<00:01:15.420> Spidey<00:01:15.750> defeats<00:01:16.200> him<00:01:16.410> and

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
Ravencroft after Spidey defeats him and

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.620 
Ravencroft after Spidey defeats him and
during<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.370> clock<00:01:17.580> tower<00:01:17.730> scene<00:01:18.090> I<00:01:18.180> mean<00:01:18.330> if

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
during the clock tower scene I mean if

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.440 
during the clock tower scene I mean if
Raven<00:01:19.020> crafts<00:01:19.350> is<00:01:19.470> part<00:01:19.800> of<00:01:19.950> Oscorp<00:01:20.460> why<00:01:21.240> would

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
Raven crafts is part of Oscorp why would

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.920 
Raven crafts is part of Oscorp why would
the<00:01:21.630> company<00:01:21.780> placed<00:01:22.380> him<00:01:23.420> actually<00:01:24.420> or

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
the company placed him actually or

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.960 
the company placed him actually or
Osbourne's<00:01:25.680> Norman<00:01:26.040> Osborn's<00:01:26.430> son<00:01:26.700> in

Osbourne's Norman Osborn's son in
Ravencroft<00:01:27.540> right<00:01:27.930> but<00:01:28.740> then<00:01:28.890> I<00:01:28.920> thought

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:29.160 
Ravencroft right but then I thought

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.950 
Ravencroft right but then I thought
about<00:01:29.220> another<00:01:29.850> possible<00:01:30.360> thing<00:01:30.630> why

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
about another possible thing why

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.440 
about another possible thing why
actually<00:01:31.260> why<00:01:32.250> Harry<00:01:32.520> might<00:01:32.760> end<00:01:33.000> up<00:01:33.180> and

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
actually why Harry might end up and

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.800 
actually why Harry might end up and
Ravencroft<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:34.140> why<00:01:34.380> he<00:01:34.620> actually<00:01:35.070> ambushes

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
Ravencroft and why he actually ambushes

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.040

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
very carefully and this is just one

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.340 
very carefully and this is just one
scene<00:02:10.830> which<00:02:11.250> indicates<00:02:11.849> that

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350

man<00:02:17.460> so<00:02:17.940> my<00:02:18.660> theory<00:02:19.110> is<00:02:19.170> that<00:02:19.200> and<00:02:19.530> you<00:02:19.770> know

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
man so my theory is that and you know

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.190 
man so my theory is that and you know
normal<00:02:20.730> husband<00:02:21.030> will<00:02:21.240> fake<00:02:21.480> his<00:02:21.720> death<00:02:21.750> at

normal husband will fake his death at
some<00:02:22.500> point<00:02:22.800> I<00:02:22.950> think<00:02:22.980> we<00:02:23.250> all<00:02:23.430> can<00:02:23.610> agree<00:02:23.670> that

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
some point I think we all can agree that

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.210 
some point I think we all can agree that
Norman<00:02:24.900> Osborn<00:02:25.200> is<00:02:25.320> the<00:02:25.410> master<00:02:25.740> of<00:02:25.770> faking

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
his death and he doesn't really die for

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.660 
his death and he doesn't really die for
real<00:02:28.230> and<00:02:29.900> at<00:02:30.900> one<00:02:31.140> point<00:02:31.380> Norman<00:02:32.160> will<00:02:32.340> die<00:02:32.610> in

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
real and at one point Norman will die in

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.240 
real and at one point Norman will die in
a<00:02:32.880> movie<00:02:33.120> well<00:02:33.360> die<00:02:33.960> you<00:02:34.380> know<00:02:34.500> not<00:02:34.800> really<00:02:34.980> die

punch for Harry Osborn and at this point

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.380 
punch for Harry Osborn and at this point
he<00:04:01.230> might<00:04:01.440> think<00:04:01.770> that<00:04:02.010> you<00:04:02.370> know<00:04:02.490> whatever<00:04:02.910> I

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390

and<00:04:06.990> here<00:04:07.320> he<00:04:07.860> goes<00:04:08.040> down<00:04:08.340> to<00:04:08.520> the<00:04:08.610> chamber<00:04:08.700> and

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:09.300 
and here he goes down to the chamber and

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.750 
and here he goes down to the chamber and
he<00:04:09.450> takes<00:04:09.690> his<00:04:09.810> goblins<00:04:10.260> armor<00:04:10.650> and<00:04:10.920> from<00:04:11.610> this

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
he takes his goblins armor and from this

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.910 
he takes his goblins armor and from this
point<00:04:12.060> Harry<00:04:12.480> Osborn<00:04:12.930> things<00:04:13.170> that<00:04:13.410> he<00:04:13.710> will

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
rule the Oscorp actually on himself he

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.490 
rule the Oscorp actually on himself he
doesn't<00:04:17.520> need<00:04:17.820> Menken<00:04:18.510> he<00:04:18.720> doesn't<00:04:19.140> anyone

doesn't need Menken he doesn't anyone
else<00:04:19.799> I<00:04:20.130> think<00:04:21.060> he<00:04:21.210> takes<00:04:21.390> the<00:04:21.630> goblets<00:04:22.470> armor

else I think he takes the goblets armor

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.400 
else I think he takes the goblets armor
and

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.410 
and

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.310

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.850 
taking this serum and the story was
actually<00:05:53.210> revealed<00:05:53.810> that<00:05:53.930> Menken<00:05:54.440> is<00:05:54.800> a

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:54.860 
actually revealed that Menken is a

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:57.280 
actually revealed that Menken is a
witness<00:05:55.370> of<00:05:55.760> this<00:05:56.030> whole<00:05:56.360> transformation<00:05:56.780> he

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:57.290 
witness of this whole transformation he

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:59.650 
witness of this whole transformation he
runs<00:05:57.500> to<00:05:57.740> the<00:05:57.860> security<00:05:58.400> pattern<00:05:58.820> but<00:05:59.390> it's

00:05:59.650 --> 00:05:59.660 
runs to the security pattern but it's

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:02.500 
runs to the security pattern but it's
too<00:05:59.900> late<00:06:00.110> when<00:06:00.530> Harry<00:06:00.770> takes<00:06:01.040> the<00:06:01.250> serum<00:06:01.610> so

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:02.510 
too late when Harry takes the serum so

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:04.720 
too late when Harry takes the serum so
these<00:06:03.020> two<00:06:03.290> events<00:06:03.770> will<00:06:03.980> actually<00:06:04.400> lead<00:06:04.580> to

these two events will actually lead to

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:07.480 
these two events will actually lead to
