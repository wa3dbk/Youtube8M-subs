Witten super 3x3 I think we'll get to
that<00:01:53.730> in<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:53.970> minute

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710

I'm cute for you and another one you got
anything<00:02:30.390> else<00:02:31.100> nope<00:02:32.130> that<00:02:32.400> box<00:02:32.640> is<00:02:32.820> empty

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
anything else nope that box is empty

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.930 
anything else nope that box is empty
alright<00:02:34.800> let's<00:02:34.980> go<00:02:35.130> through<00:02:35.310> these<00:02:35.400> one<00:02:35.580> one

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
alright let's go through these one one

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:45.080 
alright let's go through these one one
by<00:02:36.090> one<00:02:42.830> okay<00:02:43.830> now<00:02:43.950> these<00:02:44.190> of<00:02:44.400> course<00:02:44.580> are<00:02:44.850> the

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
by one okay now these of course are the

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.270 
by one okay now these of course are the
cube<00:02:45.690> for<00:02:45.810> your<00:02:45.930> three<00:02:46.200> by<00:02:46.320> three<00:02:46.560> by<00:02:46.680> four<00:02:46.739> and

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
cube for your three by three by four and

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.479 
cube for your three by three by four and
I<00:02:47.760> have<00:02:48.150> found<00:02:48.750> a<00:02:49.140> way<00:02:49.170> to<00:02:49.380> make<00:02:49.800> a<00:02:50.100> three<00:02:50.370> by

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
I have found a way to make a three by

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.250 
I have found a way to make a three by
three<00:02:50.670> by<00:02:50.700> five<00:02:51.150> out<00:02:51.540> of<00:02:51.600> two<00:02:51.989> of<00:02:52.140> these

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
three by five out of two of these

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.350 
three by five out of two of these
actually<00:02:52.920> technically<00:02:53.489> you<00:02:53.610> only<00:02:53.700> need<00:02:54.000> one

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
actually technically you only need one

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.050 
actually technically you only need one
but<00:02:55.200> you<00:02:55.680> need<00:02:55.860> two<00:02:56.220> more<00:02:56.250> extensions<00:02:56.880> in<00:02:56.970> the

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
but you need two more extensions in the

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.940 
but you need two more extensions in the
center<00:02:57.330> capsule<00:02:57.780> I<00:02:57.959> actually<00:02:58.230> had<00:02:58.500> to<00:02:58.620> buy<00:02:58.739> two

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
center capsule I actually had to buy two

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.290 
center capsule I actually had to buy two
if<00:02:59.220> I<00:02:59.340> want<00:02:59.550> to<00:02:59.610> make<00:02:59.730> it<00:02:59.880> look<00:03:00.000> really

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
if I want to make it look really

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:05.740 
if I want to make it look really
professional<00:03:00.420> so<00:03:00.989> basically<00:03:01.830> I<00:03:02.160> just<00:03:02.610> need

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.640 

two<00:03:07.220> squares<00:03:08.220> so<00:03:08.519> I<00:03:08.550> cut<00:03:08.910> this<00:03:09.090> off<00:03:09.360> and<00:03:09.630> I<00:03:10.590> need

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
two squares so I cut this off and I need

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.449 
two squares so I cut this off and I need
two<00:03:11.070> extra<00:03:11.340> squares<00:03:12.980> see<00:03:13.980> what<00:03:14.100> this<00:03:14.220> is

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
two extra squares see what this is

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.680 
two extra squares see what this is
DeWitt<00:03:14.820> Eden<00:03:15.180> super<00:03:15.800> 3x3<00:03:17.300> now<00:03:18.300> I<00:03:18.330> guess<00:03:18.480> this

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
DeWitt Eden super 3x3 now I guess this

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.199 
DeWitt Eden super 3x3 now I guess this
is<00:03:18.780> sort<00:03:18.930> of<00:03:19.080> like<00:03:19.170> a<00:03:19.200> crazy<00:03:19.620> 3x3<00:03:20.400> except<00:03:21.090> it's

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
is sort of like a crazy 3x3 except it's

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.420 
is sort of like a crazy 3x3 except it's
only<00:03:21.330> got<00:03:21.510> the<00:03:21.600> circle<00:03:22.019> on<00:03:22.230> one<00:03:22.950> end<00:03:23.190> of<00:03:23.250> each

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
only got the circle on one end of each

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.360 
only got the circle on one end of each
and<00:03:23.610> as<00:03:23.700> you<00:03:23.850> can<00:03:23.970> see<00:03:24.030> that<00:03:25.070> when<00:03:26.070> you<00:03:26.160> turn

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
and as you can see that when you turn

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.490 
and as you can see that when you turn
this<00:03:26.550> face<00:03:26.880> that<00:03:27.780> one<00:03:27.959> does<00:03:28.140> not<00:03:28.170> actually

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
this face that one does not actually

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.500 
this face that one does not actually
move<00:03:28.890> so<00:03:29.670> if<00:03:29.850> I<00:03:29.940> was<00:03:30.060> to<00:03:30.090> turn<00:03:30.239> it<00:03:30.390> like<00:03:30.450> this

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
move so if I was to turn it like this

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.720 
move so if I was to turn it like this
now<00:03:31.350> this<00:03:31.500> is<00:03:31.560> locked<00:03:31.950> because<00:03:32.190> you<00:03:32.489> need<00:03:32.640> to

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
now this is locked because you need to

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:38.270 
now this is locked because you need to
complete<00:03:33.540> circle<00:03:33.989> like<00:03:34.860> that<00:03:36.140> so<00:03:37.140> I<00:03:37.560> might<00:03:38.130> try

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
complete circle like that so I might try

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.060 
complete circle like that so I might try
to<00:03:38.370> solve<00:03:38.670> this<00:03:38.790> a<00:03:38.850> little<00:03:39.120> bit<00:03:39.330> before<00:03:40.110> I<00:03:40.140> make

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
to solve this a little bit before I make

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:42.920 
to solve this a little bit before I make
turret<00:03:41.940> apart<00:03:42.180> make<00:03:42.330> it<00:03:42.480> through<00:03:42.600> by<00:03:42.720> 3

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
turret apart make it through by 3

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.069 
turret apart make it through by 3
because<00:03:43.079> 3<00:03:43.889> by<00:03:44.040> 3<00:03:44.160> by<00:03:44.310> 5<00:03:44.489> because<00:03:45.480> technically

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:46.079 
because 3 by 3 by 5 because technically

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:47.900 
because 3 by 3 by 5 because technically
if<00:03:46.410> you<00:03:46.620> think<00:03:46.859> about<00:03:46.950> it

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
if you think about it

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.340 
if you think about it
let's<00:03:48.030> see<00:03:48.180> if<00:03:48.270> the<00:03:48.390> can<00:03:48.570> now<00:03:48.780> we<00:03:48.840> can't<00:03:49.140> pull

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
let's see if the can now we can't pull

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.830 
let's see if the can now we can't pull
edges<00:03:49.980> apart<00:03:50.420> anyways<00:03:51.420> I<00:03:51.480> don't<00:03:51.540> know<00:03:51.690> how<00:03:51.750> to

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
edges apart anyways I don't know how to

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.710 
edges apart anyways I don't know how to
take<00:03:51.990> it<00:03:52.080> apart<00:03:52.290> yet<00:03:52.500> but<00:03:52.910> these<00:03:53.910> pieces<00:03:54.390> these

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
take it apart yet but these pieces these

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.900 
take it apart yet but these pieces these
inside<00:03:55.200> pieces<00:03:55.680> is<00:03:55.890> basically<00:03:56.370> a<00:03:56.490> three<00:03:56.790> by

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
inside pieces is basically a three by

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.610 
inside pieces is basically a three by
three<00:03:56.970> by<00:03:57.180> five<00:03:57.630> already<00:03:58.050> because<00:03:58.410> if<00:03:58.530> you

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
three by five already because if you

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.190 
three by five already because if you
glued<00:03:58.830> extensions<00:03:59.550> on<00:03:59.730> top<00:03:59.970> of<00:04:00.150> these<00:04:00.240> these

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
glued extensions on top of these these

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.180 
glued extensions on top of these these
ones<00:04:01.380> right<00:04:01.620> here<00:04:01.650> to<00:04:02.460> come<00:04:02.610> up<00:04:02.640> tall<00:04:04.040> and<00:04:05.040> you

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
ones right here to come up tall and you

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.750 
ones right here to come up tall and you
unlocked<00:04:05.700> the<00:04:06.120> middle<00:04:06.390> part<00:04:07.160> then<00:04:08.160> that<00:04:08.580> would

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
unlocked the middle part then that would

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.190 
unlocked the middle part then that would
make<00:04:08.910> a<00:04:08.940> three<00:04:09.120> by<00:04:09.240> three<00:04:09.390> by<00:04:09.450> five<00:04:09.690> because

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
make a three by three by five because

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.020 
make a three by three by five because
there's<00:04:10.410> one<00:04:10.530> on<00:04:10.650> each<00:04:10.800> side<00:04:10.830> that'll<00:04:11.820> work

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
there's one on each side that'll work

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.660 
there's one on each side that'll work
and<00:04:12.270> the<00:04:12.900> pieces<00:04:13.260> are<00:04:13.920> gonna<00:04:13.980> come<00:04:14.250> from<00:04:14.370> here

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
and the pieces are gonna come from here

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.300 
and the pieces are gonna come from here
I'll<00:04:15.510> have<00:04:16.110> a<00:04:16.140> video<00:04:16.290> of<00:04:16.530> me<00:04:16.650> making<00:04:16.890> that<00:04:17.040> as

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
I'll have a video of me making that as

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.370 
I'll have a video of me making that as
well

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.000 

here<00:04:22.380> we<00:04:22.500> have<00:04:22.680> the<00:04:22.950> three<00:04:23.670> by<00:04:23.820> three<00:04:24.150> by<00:04:24.180> nine

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
here we have the three by three by nine

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.560 
here we have the three by three by nine
I've<00:04:26.010> been<00:04:26.400> pretty<00:04:26.610> curious<00:04:26.940> about<00:04:27.240> how<00:04:27.420> this

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
I've been pretty curious about how this

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.910 
I've been pretty curious about how this
thing<00:04:27.780> turns<00:04:28.010> as<00:04:29.010> you<00:04:29.970> can<00:04:30.090> see<00:04:30.330> it<00:04:30.600> is<00:04:30.720> not<00:04:31.350> you

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:31.920 
thing turns as you can see it is not you

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.400 
thing turns as you can see it is not you
know<00:04:32.420> they're<00:04:33.420> not<00:04:33.570> cuboid<00:04:34.020> it's<00:04:34.170> sort<00:04:34.350> of

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
know they're not cuboid it's sort of

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.290 
know they're not cuboid it's sort of
like<00:04:34.530> the<00:04:34.650> top<00:04:34.830> part<00:04:34.890> of<00:04:35.220> a<00:04:35.280> three<00:04:35.820> by<00:04:35.940> three<00:04:35.970> by

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
like the top part of a three by three by

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.110 
like the top part of a three by three by
seven<00:04:36.470> except<00:04:37.470> it's<00:04:37.620> all<00:04:37.890> the<00:04:38.250> layers<00:04:38.490> and

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
seven except it's all the layers and

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.160 
seven except it's all the layers and
that<00:04:39.630> turns<00:04:39.960> very<00:04:40.290> very<00:04:40.620> well<00:04:40.940> and<00:04:41.940> of<00:04:42.930> course

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:43.170 
that turns very very well and of course

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:45.590 
that turns very very well and of course
you<00:04:43.320> can<00:04:43.500> scramble<00:04:44.010> it<00:04:44.220> like<00:04:44.370> a<00:04:44.580> 3x3<00:04:45.270> so<00:04:45.390> once

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 
you can scramble it like a 3x3 so once

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:46.850 
you can scramble it like a 3x3 so once
you're<00:04:45.720> done<00:04:45.750> scrambling<00:04:46.440> all<00:04:46.560> the<00:04:46.650> pieces

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
you're done scrambling all the pieces

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.430 
you're done scrambling all the pieces
together<00:04:47.420> it'll<00:04:48.420> become<00:04:48.540> just<00:04:49.170> that<00:04:49.320> much

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
together it'll become just that much

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.410 
together it'll become just that much
harder<00:04:49.500> because<00:04:49.920> now<00:04:50.280> you<00:04:50.340> have<00:04:50.550> to<00:04:50.670> get<00:04:51.330> it

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:51.420 
harder because now you have to get it

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:53.120 
harder because now you have to get it
back<00:04:51.570> into<00:04:51.810> its<00:04:51.930> proper<00:04:52.080> sleep<00:04:52.530> shape<00:04:52.890> and

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
back into its proper sleep shape and

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.910 
back into its proper sleep shape and
unlike<00:04:53.940> a<00:04:53.970> three<00:04:54.180> by<00:04:54.300> three<00:04:54.330> by<00:04:54.600> seven<00:04:54.920> the

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:55.920 
unlike a three by three by seven the

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:00.680 
unlike a three by three by seven the
center<00:04:57.710> it<00:04:58.710> has<00:04:59.220> an<00:04:59.400> orientation<00:04:59.850> to<00:05:00.150> it<00:05:00.270> so

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
center it has an orientation to it so

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:01.940 
center it has an orientation to it so
you<00:05:00.750> have<00:05:01.020> to<00:05:01.140> make<00:05:01.290> sure<00:05:01.440> that<00:05:01.470> that<00:05:01.770> is<00:05:01.920> in

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:01.950 
you have to make sure that that is in

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:04.280 
you have to make sure that that is in
proper<00:05:02.310> orientation<00:05:02.690> when<00:05:03.690> you're<00:05:03.900> solving

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:04.290 
proper orientation when you're solving

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:05.480 
proper orientation when you're solving
it<00:05:04.530> which<00:05:04.710> makes<00:05:04.919> it<00:05:05.040> a<00:05:05.100> little<00:05:05.190> bit<00:05:05.340> more

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
it which makes it a little bit more

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:09.980 
it which makes it a little bit more
difficult<00:05:05.940> as<00:05:06.060> well<00:05:08.360> let's<00:05:09.360> take<00:05:09.510> a<00:05:09.540> look<00:05:09.810> at

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
difficult as well let's take a look at

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:14.240 
difficult as well let's take a look at
the<00:05:11.300> what<00:05:12.300> even<00:05:12.660> three<00:05:12.960> by<00:05:13.080> three<00:05:13.380> by<00:05:13.410> six<00:05:14.040> I

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
the what even three by three by six I

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:18.740 
the what even three by three by six I
believe<00:05:15.350> as<00:05:16.760> you<00:05:17.760> can<00:05:17.910> tell<00:05:18.120> I<00:05:18.150> am<00:05:18.390> a<00:05:18.419> fan<00:05:18.720> of

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.750 
believe as you can tell I am a fan of

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:22.550 
believe as you can tell I am a fan of
cuboid<00:05:19.380> puzzles<00:05:19.830> that<00:05:20.780> is<00:05:21.780> the<00:05:21.960> Witten<00:05:22.380> three

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 
cuboid puzzles that is the Witten three

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.310 
cuboid puzzles that is the Witten three
by<00:05:22.710> three<00:05:22.890> by<00:05:23.010> six<00:05:23.600> I've<00:05:24.600> wanted<00:05:24.930> one<00:05:25.080> of<00:05:25.110> these

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:25.320 
by three by six I've wanted one of these

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.370 
by three by six I've wanted one of these
for<00:05:25.620> a<00:05:25.650> while<00:05:25.919> I've<00:05:26.669> got<00:05:26.760> a<00:05:27.300> couple<00:05:27.750> of<00:05:27.960> Q<00:05:28.230> boys

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380 
for a while I've got a couple of Q boys

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.580 
for a while I've got a couple of Q boys
as<00:05:28.740> well<00:05:29.000> already<00:05:30.000> so<00:05:30.660> I'll<00:05:30.870> just<00:05:31.020> add<00:05:31.200> nicely

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:31.590 
as well already so I'll just add nicely

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:34.970 
as well already so I'll just add nicely
to<00:05:31.740> my<00:05:31.830> collection<00:05:33.020> now<00:05:34.020> I<00:05:34.050> do<00:05:34.290> want<00:05:34.710> a<00:05:34.800> three

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:34.980 
to my collection now I do want a three

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.100 
to my collection now I do want a three
by<00:05:35.100> three<00:05:35.160> by<00:05:35.490> four<00:05:35.550> for<00:05:36.030> my<00:05:36.120> collection<00:05:36.450> but

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
by three by four for my collection but

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:41.930 
by three by four for my collection but
all<00:05:37.380> of<00:05:37.650> my<00:05:37.880> cuboids<00:05:38.880> are<00:05:39.180> black<00:05:39.600> and<00:05:40.400> I<00:05:41.400> guess

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:41.940 
all of my cuboids are black and I guess

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.150 
all of my cuboids are black and I guess
that<00:05:42.570> fifty<00:05:43.080> one<00:05:43.200> more<00:05:43.350> fun<00:05:43.560> has<00:05:43.740> sent<00:05:44.010> me<00:05:44.130> a

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:44.160 
that fifty one more fun has sent me a

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.640 
that fifty one more fun has sent me a
white<00:05:44.640> one<00:05:44.820> instead<00:05:45.180> of<00:05:45.240> a<00:05:45.360> black<00:05:45.600> one<00:05:45.650> because

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:46.650 
white one instead of a black one because

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:48.590 
white one instead of a black one because
they<00:05:46.770> didn't<00:05:47.010> have<00:05:47.160> a<00:05:47.190> black<00:05:47.460> one<00:05:47.760> but<00:05:48.000> he<00:05:48.450> also

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:48.600 
they didn't have a black one but he also

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.540 
they didn't have a black one but he also
refunded<00:05:49.530> my<00:05:49.590> money<00:05:49.800> and<00:05:49.919> gave<00:05:50.040> me<00:05:50.130> a<00:05:50.190> cube<00:05:50.400> for

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:50.550 
refunded my money and gave me a cube for

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:51.860 
refunded my money and gave me a cube for
free<00:05:50.760> so<00:05:50.910> I<00:05:50.940> can't<00:05:51.210> really<00:05:51.419> complain<00:05:51.660> about

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:51.870 
free so I can't really complain about

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.080 
free so I can't really complain about
that<00:05:52.280> anyway<00:05:53.280> to<00:05:53.340> turn<00:05:53.550> him<00:05:53.640> on<00:05:53.730> this<00:05:53.880> is

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:54.090 
that anyway to turn him on this is

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:56.510 
that anyway to turn him on this is
extremely<00:05:54.480> nice<00:05:54.810> I<00:05:55.350> can't<00:05:55.830> wait<00:05:55.950> to<00:05:56.070> solve<00:05:56.370> it

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:56.520 
extremely nice I can't wait to solve it

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:00.409 
extremely nice I can't wait to solve it
I<00:05:57.479> will<00:05:58.289> be<00:05:58.410> probably<00:05:58.830> doing<00:05:59.070> reviews<00:05:59.520> on<00:05:59.970> most

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:00.419 
I will be probably doing reviews on most

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:01.790 
I will be probably doing reviews on most
of<00:06:00.570> these<00:06:00.720> cubes

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:01.800 
of these cubes

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.619 
of these cubes
so<00:06:02.160> next<00:06:02.460> comes<00:06:02.699> the<00:06:02.879> one<00:06:02.970> that<00:06:03.090> I<00:06:03.120> have<00:06:03.300> been

00:06:03.619 --> 00:06:03.629 
so next comes the one that I have been

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:09.230 
so next comes the one that I have been
most<00:06:03.840> excited<00:06:04.349> about<00:06:04.410> being<00:06:04.949> ciao<00:06:05.690> 6x6<00:06:08.240> this

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:09.240 
most excited about being ciao 6x6 this

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.230 
most excited about being ciao 6x6 this
is<00:06:09.419> the<00:06:09.569> Blackland<00:06:10.110> now<00:06:11.009> I<00:06:11.310> have<00:06:11.759> a<00:06:11.819> fully

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:12.240 
is the Blackland now I have a fully

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:15.800 
is the Blackland now I have a fully
modded<00:06:12.780> V<00:06:13.530> Cube<00:06:13.830> 6<00:06:14.159> in<00:06:14.819> white<00:06:15.180> my<00:06:15.539> black<00:06:15.780> one

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:15.810 
modded V Cube 6 in white my black one

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:18.760 
modded V Cube 6 in white my black one
didn't<00:06:16.259> turn<00:06:16.440> out<00:06:16.620> and<00:06:17.009> I<00:06:17.370> threw<00:06:17.669> it<00:06:17.789> away

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:18.770 
didn't turn out and I threw it away

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:22.399 
didn't turn out and I threw it away
so<00:06:19.770> I<00:06:20.150> heard<00:06:21.150> that<00:06:21.300> this<00:06:21.449> is<00:06:21.509> extremely<00:06:22.080> good

00:06:22.399 --> 00:06:22.409 
so I heard that this is extremely good

00:06:22.409 --> 00:06:26.899 
so I heard that this is extremely good
and<00:06:22.729> it's<00:06:23.729> sort<00:06:24.270> of<00:06:24.300> like<00:06:24.479> a<00:06:25.099> x-cubed<00:06:26.099> meets<00:06:26.520> V

00:06:26.899 --> 00:06:26.909 
and it's sort of like a x-cubed meets V

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:29.119 
and it's sort of like a x-cubed meets V
Cube<00:06:27.300> design<00:06:27.780> and<00:06:28.530> it<00:06:28.650> doesn't<00:06:28.889> come<00:06:29.009> out<00:06:29.069> of

00:06:29.119 --> 00:06:29.129 
Cube design and it doesn't come out of

00:06:29.129 --> 00:06:31.580 
Cube design and it doesn't come out of
alignment<00:06:29.430> at<00:06:29.759> all<00:06:29.990> it's<00:06:30.990> pretty<00:06:31.229> heavy<00:06:31.440> I

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:31.590 
alignment at all it's pretty heavy I

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:33.230 
alignment at all it's pretty heavy I
would<00:06:31.830> say<00:06:32.009> it's<00:06:32.129> about<00:06:32.220> the<00:06:32.340> same<00:06:32.550> size<00:06:32.610> and

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:33.240 
would say it's about the same size and

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:36.350 
would say it's about the same size and
weight<00:06:33.300> as<00:06:33.960> AV<00:06:34.740> cube<00:06:35.009> 6<00:06:35.310> now<00:06:35.819> I<00:06:35.880> have<00:06:36.030> a<00:06:36.090> really

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:36.360 
weight as AV cube 6 now I have a really

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:39.080 
weight as AV cube 6 now I have a really
good<00:06:36.630> mod<00:06:36.870> of<00:06:36.900> B<00:06:37.169> cube<00:06:37.440> 6<00:06:37.740> so<00:06:38.190> I'm<00:06:38.310> waiting<00:06:38.940> to

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:39.090 
good mod of B cube 6 so I'm waiting to

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:41.420 
good mod of B cube 6 so I'm waiting to
see<00:06:39.120> like<00:06:39.479> how<00:06:39.630> how<00:06:40.590> this<00:06:40.740> one<00:06:40.919> will<00:06:41.009> stack<00:06:41.250> up

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:41.430 
see like how how this one will stack up

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:43.640 
see like how how this one will stack up
to<00:06:41.460> it<00:06:41.699> and<00:06:42.300> so<00:06:42.479> far<00:06:42.720> as<00:06:42.900> you<00:06:43.080> can<00:06:43.199> see<00:06:43.440> when<00:06:43.620> I

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:43.650 
to it and so far as you can see when I

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:46.249 
to it and so far as you can see when I
do<00:06:43.740> a<00:06:43.830> full<00:06:44.130> term<00:06:44.430> it<00:06:45.210> doesn't<00:06:45.569> quite<00:06:45.780> line<00:06:46.229> up

00:06:46.249 --> 00:06:46.259 
do a full term it doesn't quite line up

00:06:46.259 --> 00:06:47.960 
do a full term it doesn't quite line up
with<00:06:46.590> the<00:06:46.680> rest<00:06:46.860> of<00:06:46.949> the<00:06:47.069> cubic<00:06:47.430> goes<00:06:47.639> a<00:06:47.669> little

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:47.970 
with the rest of the cubic goes a little

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:52.249 
with the rest of the cubic goes a little
bit<00:06:48.090> off<00:06:49.009> as<00:06:50.009> you<00:06:50.250> can<00:06:50.400> see<00:06:50.900> lines<00:06:51.900> up<00:06:52.050> if<00:06:52.139> I

00:06:52.249 --> 00:06:52.259 
bit off as you can see lines up if I

00:06:52.259 --> 00:06:58.610 
bit off as you can see lines up if I
push<00:06:52.470> it<00:06:52.560> really<00:06:52.710> hard<00:06:53.300> but<00:06:56.990> it<00:06:57.990> seems<00:06:58.319> to<00:06:58.469> turn

00:06:58.610 --> 00:06:58.620 
push it really hard but it seems to turn

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:01.670 
push it really hard but it seems to turn
pretty<00:06:58.949> well<00:06:59.190> I<00:06:59.460> think<00:07:00.449> I<00:07:00.599> should<00:07:00.930> tension<00:07:01.560> it

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:01.680 
pretty well I think I should tension it

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:06.920 
pretty well I think I should tension it
it's<00:07:02.219> lubricated<00:07:02.550> very<00:07:03.240> nicely<00:07:05.719> doesn't<00:07:06.719> it

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:06.930 
it's lubricated very nicely doesn't it

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:11.390 
it's lubricated very nicely doesn't it
cuts<00:07:07.740> corners<00:07:08.009> very<00:07:08.370> well<00:07:09.919> but<00:07:10.919> that<00:07:11.099> is<00:07:11.130> my

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:11.400 
cuts corners very well but that is my

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:13.640 
cuts corners very well but that is my
unboxing<00:07:11.580> and<00:07:12.240> I<00:07:12.659> will<00:07:12.840> be<00:07:12.960> doing<00:07:13.080> a<00:07:13.380> full

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:13.650 
unboxing and I will be doing a full

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:16.670 
unboxing and I will be doing a full
review<00:07:13.680> and<00:07:14.569> that'll<00:07:15.569> include<00:07:15.990> taking<00:07:16.590> this

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:16.680 
review and that'll include taking this

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:17.930 
review and that'll include taking this
thing<00:07:16.830> apart<00:07:16.949> and<00:07:17.430> checking<00:07:17.789> out<00:07:17.880> the

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:17.940 
thing apart and checking out the

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:20.209 
thing apart and checking out the
mechanism<00:07:18.569> so<00:07:19.050> if<00:07:19.349> you<00:07:19.560> want<00:07:19.800> to<00:07:19.860> see<00:07:20.069> that

00:07:20.209 --> 00:07:20.219 
mechanism so if you want to see that

00:07:20.219 --> 00:07:22.189

out is the Shang shelf 6x6 full review
thoughts<00:07:29.370> and<00:07:29.759> the<00:07:30.630> mechanism<00:07:31.370> have<00:07:32.370> a<00:07:32.430> good

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:32.580 
thoughts and the mechanism have a good

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:41.559 
thoughts and the mechanism have a good
day<00:07:32.699> and<00:07:32.819> I'll<00:07:32.940> see<00:07:33.120> you<00:07:33.180> on<00:07:33.300> my<00:07:33.419> next<00:07:33.449> video
