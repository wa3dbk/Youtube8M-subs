00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:09.599
 all good my name is yes damn it's a glitch 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.639
 gaming channel and today we talk about 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.190
 the game batman arkham knight on which 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.350
 I personally pinned very much we just very 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.970
 big just like an asshole but hope 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.250
 hold sake we note that people with 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.199
 little pisyus, too, were waiting for her 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.730
 dedicate the first part to the arkham series 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.199
 a real breakthrough in the genre 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.090
 she completely turned the show 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.470
 gamers about superhero games 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.210
 topics and raised credibility 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.779
 developers from the hands of the herd to the unprecedented 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.430
 heights 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.200
 the second part was her perfect 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.120
 sequel with big open world and 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.500
 deeper immersion i 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.989
 I'm not talking about a dozen juicy 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.690
 characters our favorite interrogations where 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:49.649
 detonator 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:55.469
 matter is where is optimization diana where is she 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:57.210
 gays ATMs and where he is and here he is 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.920
 developed the third part 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.449
 which in spite of a third-party firm 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.520
 all your attempts nothing new 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.070
 technical gameplay introduce not 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.960
 I could so much more was the enthusiasm of the fans 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.090
 when they learned what to design arkham 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.280
 knight igrodels were again drawn from 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.470
 Rocksteady companies are happy to be important who 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.330
 did not wait and in addition, and the standards promised 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.189
 the working version of the Batmobile on which 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.229
 it will be possible to cut through the streets of Gotham and 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.820
 still a bunch of any type nishtyakov more 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.180
 thoroughly researched ass Harley 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.180
 quinn 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:31.030
 so even deeper neckline and 

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:32.320
 cat women who are in this part 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.570
 for some reason looks much younger 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.520
 than the previous ones despite the fact that it is 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:44.560
 no prequel but batman and 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:46.299
 can stop such a small thing to you about the well 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.890
 okay as we know peer Dicks 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:49.479
 Poverty does not accept for so 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.759
 let's get this in order 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:54.039
 but for this we need to try both 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:56.350
 eyes on disgusting lag from ass 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:58.149
 before the crown is buried in the bull version of the game 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.470
 to stay one hundred percent 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:01.659
 objective and will be considered 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.369
 console option or immediately start with 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:05.319
 innovations because otherwise it is 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:06.789
 all the same batman from the arkham series 

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:10.350
 what's up with the right grafon and new 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:10.350
 a set of sexy costumes 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.510
 oh my gosh same bat nipple now you 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.430
 exactly saw everything and so the developers 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.960
 really displayed the real one 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.390
 batmobile that appears with 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.370
 superhuman pathos and looks just 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.110
 amazing and technologically you only 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.760
 take a look at all these newfangled effects 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.209
 realistic smoke and other nice 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.209
 tinsel 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:43.950
 in the Batmobile has not one but two 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.170
 speed mode and can arrange 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.060
 real drag racing participate 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.620
 chasing and doing the other three things in 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.660
 difference from someone 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.210
 and the battle mode turns the Batmobile into 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.950
 fucking b tank that is capable of abundantly 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:57.870
 water the enemy equipment with rockets and 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.040
 shoot pedestrians out of trauma like 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.560
 if Batman were invited to 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.880
 Dagestan wedding looks played 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:07.770
 everything is pretty good but first 5 10 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.660
 15 times and then a little bored 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.670
 and now i'm serious 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.440
 50 percent consists of pokatushek on 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.600
 the streets of gotham smith great shooting 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.330
 enemy drone tanks and this 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.650
 damn tiresome yes I agree with 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.420
 majority opinion and Batmobile 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.490
 Gray really needed and 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.380
 somewhere in the second part but trust me 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:27.450
 not in such quantities therefore the introduction 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.730
 transport can be considered a chip useful 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.020
 but not very well implemented what 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.450
 for other smaller ones 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:35.040
 innovations then it is worth noting 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.780
 what collective fear opportunities 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.700
 joint finishes that look 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.080
 spectacular and provide an opportunity for a short 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.360
 time to take control of robin 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.920
 Nightwing and Catwoman in well 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.050
 depending on who you will be in 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.940
 couple mutuzit poor thugs but such 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.470
 moments in the game are too few and everything 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.630
 because batman behaves like 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:55.520
 uniform asshole faithful friends and comrades 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:04:08.070
 constantly invites him to help he weighs 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:09.660
 control but the more this asshole 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:11.370
 refuses to help all the more 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.770
 it becomes obvious that without help 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.630
 not get along and as a result we care 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:16.980
 we get several joint tasks 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:19.020
 which unlike pokatushek on 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:20.609
 Batmobile could do a bit 

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:22.830
 bigger because they really 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:25.500
 interesting and diverse 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:27.180
 boevka since the time of the first parts almost 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.190
 mercy authors added some new 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.330
 receptions and a couple of enemies that 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.220
 need a special approach 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.050
 but otherwise everything comes down as before 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.730
 to swotting on two buttons that 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:39.080
 no wonder for game oriented 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:39.080
 first thing on the console 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:57.840
 about the same situation with stealth 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:59.700
 so that the game does not come down tedious 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.230
 pokatushkam and blunt lost two 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.360
 unfortunate buttons us periodically 

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:04.740
 being showered in locations for inevitably 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.810
 covert passage 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.820
 and by this moment I personally have almost 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.419
 no complaints because stealth 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:11.280
 surprisingly 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:13.470
 fits well with the overall concept 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:15.450
 the game plot will not spoil but 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:16.200
 I warn the main intrigue any 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:17.850
 by revelation 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.920
 is because taken as a basis 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:21.990
 the story of batman under the red cap 

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:23.730
 those who watched a cartoon or read a comic 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:25.650
 immediately understand who the carrots are underground 

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:27.300
 paint the rest see the intrigue 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:29.430
 a little later but also much earlier 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.410
 than I would like too much fat 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:33.390
 hints are done but again for the sake of 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:35.190
 justice I will note that statement and 

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:37.410
 directing the narrative part here 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:39.150
 at the highest level so what is not 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:41.250
 you can get pleasure 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:43.200
 separate praise deserve the appearance 

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:45.030
 joker who plays far from here 

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:47.190
 last role, yes, you probably say 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:49.140
 a bunch of fucking arkham city joker 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:51.030
 merged once and for all but 

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:52.530
 here it is necessary to pay tribute to fiction 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:53.970
 developers who brought 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:55.920
 your favorite character for 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:58.080
 the final chord is very interesting 

00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:00.090
 in a way and it was doubly pleasant to hear 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:02.070
 voice acting from mark hemilla and he 

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:04.500
 swore that more joker dub not 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:06.300
 there will be an old rascal but this to 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:07.800
 Unfortunately it was not enough to 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:09.690
 display the whole game 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:12.120
 everything seemed to be as promised here and 

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:15.090
 batmobile rich grafon a bunch of newfangled 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:17.130
 even the joker chips were delivered but we all 

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:19.260
 should have seen back in arkham city a 

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:21.480
 then possible in arkham origins 

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.500
 they are now when we say so 

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:26.340
 got sick 

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:28.760
 from linden to the version of the game looks like this 

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:28.760
 not 

00:06:28.849 --> 00:06:37.550
 then the console is only slightly better in 

00:06:35.839 --> 00:06:39.319
 As a result, the new Batman does not justify 

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:41.149
 your expectations let him requirements 

00:06:39.319 --> 00:06:43.039
 were initially a bit overpriced 

00:06:41.149 --> 00:06:45.020
 developers from Rocksteed just don’t 

00:06:43.039 --> 00:06:46.789
 it turned out to complete the arkham series also 

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:48.559
 triumphantly how did the poles from 

00:06:46.789 --> 00:06:50.629
 sitting project with his witch 

00:06:48.559 --> 00:06:52.189
 Yes, my God, memchiki with the witcher and roach 

00:06:50.629 --> 00:06:54.349
 still boil up in all social 

00:06:52.189 --> 00:06:55.969
 networks and how do you think why yes because 

00:06:54.349 --> 00:06:58.129
 what did they really do 

00:06:55.969 --> 00:07:03.349
 make one of the best games in the genre and here 

00:06:58.129 --> 00:07:05.990
 batman batman could not put in a series 

00:07:03.349 --> 00:07:07.639
 arkham same fat point but i'm all 

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:09.589
 Equally recommend to read for 

00:07:07.639 --> 00:07:11.749
 fans of the series and just curious 

00:07:09.589 --> 00:07:13.669
 gamers only know you should not expect 

00:07:11.749 --> 00:07:17.050
 something special or triumphant 

00:07:13.669 --> 00:07:17.050
 all good 

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:39.470
 the topic of steak where he where he where here 

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:44.450
 toilet where the second sock where lick sonic 

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:44.450
 where is he where is he
