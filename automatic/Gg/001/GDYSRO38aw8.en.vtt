00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:04.900
 already 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:37.390
 all right 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.390
 also have 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.760
 since society is what it is 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.680
 there has always been a phenomenon that 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:53.110
 our days marks our life 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.110
 collective the fight against the domain 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.790
 of three scenarios have been developed 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.280
 innumerable audiovisual institutions 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.990
 miranda talman milestones that have generated 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.620
 great part of the artistic tendencies 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:04.620
 current 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.310
 with respect to such currents the 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:11.020
 Video games are have been the exception 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.720
 they could name many but we 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:17.830
 we will focus on a particular the case r 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:19.840
 when this game was developed by 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.560
 a group of subsidiary companies in attempt 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.670
 standing out among them to the laboratories 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.170
 responsible for the well-known sagas 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:31.150
 Super Smash Bros 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:33.400
 kirby this playful production has not only 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.979
 been the object of great hits but also 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.530
 of great controversies between them is a 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:41.740
 s berg rating which in its minute 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:44.020
 was cataloged from it's tools or from 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.240
 children to adults in Spanish being 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.830
 that this game is considered one of the 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.530
 more macabre of the super console 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.420
 nintendo in addition to its large amount of 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.180
 copyright disputes regarding so 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.310
 they are independent of all the 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.350
 problematic that I may have forgiveness that 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.509
 at this point everything happens to 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.550
 background since this game was 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:05.590
 able to tell a macabre story of 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:08.080
 a way unthinkable for the time 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.090
 making it a cult piece 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.709
 these days 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.349
 narrates the most macabre side of the rise 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:17.629
 the domain of terror but to form 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:20.420
 caricature to be able to unify different 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:22.340
 restoration scenarios using the 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.480
 imagination of the world of children as 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.550
 global context 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.440
 this is rather an excuse for 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.750
 represent different characteristics 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.980
 human beings and how are they working 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.709
 over an amazing story 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.290
 visually but of deep desolation 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:38.810
 in the future 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.849
 a desolation personified by the 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.650
 classic story of the paladin where a 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:44.290
 group of children are owners of the destination 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.750
 of the planet 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:49.810
 but what does it finally do 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.549
 interesting is crusade what importance 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.430
 have this adventure in this universe 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:55.530
 made up 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.269
 in a certain way the result of this 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.489
 crossing over the completely 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:01.260
 relevant and even if it still exists 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:04.170
 some planet to defend at the end of 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:07.409
 everything but rather the process aimed 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.569
 it's the puteen and this epic process 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:11.459
 lived by a community and like this 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:12.900
 faces each of internal good for 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.959
 achieve escape from your own 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:18.150
 vulnerability as a comparison with 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.500
 the reality we can make a parallel to 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.659
 movements both historical and 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.239
 and how they face their 

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:26.129
 fears and philosophical disputes throughout 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:28.169
 from a process of social camps through 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:29.700
 of the shock without going any further 

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:31.310
 representation of the characters of 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.389
 ayrton tries to be everything 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.220
 individualize very easily 

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:36.870
 different characteristics of a 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.629
 society the breakdown process and 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:42.060
 resurgence characteristics such as 

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:44.159
 mass force idealism and definition 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.260
 of collectivities are reflected in a 

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:49.350
 group of children prepared at the tip of 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.390
 street to save the planet 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:53.520
 In this same way, the 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.560
 empire oppression concepts and 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:58.560
 bondage through the alien 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.750
 you fall and your devouring army already with 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.090
 all these analogies on the table because 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:05.460
 a group of people would fight before such 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:08.460
 authority knowing that you may not see the 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:09.960
 result at the end of the dispute because 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:12.960
 we have nothing left but to give everything 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:15.840
 for the whole because we do not lose anything anymore 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:18.180
 that in the end we have not had that is the 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:22.310
 reflection of arzÃ³n a light of hope 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.310
 in the middle of a world of desolation 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:44.229
 in a mcluhan number there 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:50.939
 more development at your fingertips
