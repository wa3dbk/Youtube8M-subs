00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.970
 it's a shoulder exercise that's called 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.460
 prefrontal by rotation of the wrist 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.590
 first we need a broad environment 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.380
 to raise your hands comfortably 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:18.140
 while in a type of lamp or 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:24.130
 some kind of lighting on the ceiling 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:24.130
 very close curtain completely empty 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:28.180
 after darts 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:37.770
 and always an appropriate weight to his shoulders 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:41.550
 so as not to injure ourselves, let's do 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:44.390
 the following we are going to the hands 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:48.329
 and we go for one is a position of 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:50.699
 overcoming recombination is when 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.670
 two bones of the forearm left for 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:54.180
 books 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.210
 well in this way 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.750
 there are two ways to do it 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:02.780
 this initial position we are noticing the 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:05.840
 doll that's talking about the arm 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:09.259
 leaving is the land overvaluation 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.570
 as you will see when under the arm is in 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:14.200
 promotion 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:17.010
 we upload it in its location and in the end 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.550
 of the movement is in pronation 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:22.600
 the exercise would be like this 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:27.620
 we raise the arm of the wrist 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:30.350
 we keep very little we go back to the 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.940
 initial position and we allow with the 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.980
 another arm 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.860
 always trying on the back inter 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:40.500
 straight 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:42.430
 and in that kind of swing of 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.150
 of our body 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.150
 we go 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:51.140
 always the shoulders backwards stopped 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.150
 with benefits 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.610
 we are going to raise the guards in their 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.760
 Location 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:00.260
 let's take it by rotating the doll 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:04.030
 wintering 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.030
 we rotate find consciousness 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:13.100
 and once we have put another arm 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:15.430
 then there are other ways that we had in 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.430
 your operation 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.290
 yes 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:29.170
 the more next 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:33.910
 as more open 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.860
 they are practically in the middle and they go up and 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:40.470
 come down 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:44.490
 this exercise is to work 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:47.550
 man or forward in the movie the 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:50.670
 trapezoids is much bigger and in smaller 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.410
 measured in 13 trapial this grew very 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.480
 Well, you can include it in your routine 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.360
 good shoulder I hope you can 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.600
 subscribe but they missed the video and 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.600
