00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:11.120
 Hello and welcome 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:13.730
 today I present you an old trick here 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.440
 in the rise and well now I will explain 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.660
 how it is done 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.810
 and the first thing we need is a 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:23.990
 zombie that runs so normalillo that runs 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:26.570
 enough and nothing we leave to one another 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:29.140
 we kill them and the first door that 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:32.580
 we need to open 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.580
 is going to be this one here 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.239
 second 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:42.309
 and now there will be a third one that is the 

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:42.309
 following 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.920
 it is very important not to open any other 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:47.920
 door 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.080
 and well you also need to give the 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.180
 current that I had stayed here 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:57.950
 to entertain the zombie but there was 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.950
 failed killed him 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.450
 it would have been nice for a partner 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.060
 I would have been prepared to give the 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:09.380
 current but could not be 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.380
 so they kill me 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.200
 Well, what we need is what 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.540
 who just decided to open all that 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.670
 give it the current 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.450
 and well there would be no other door is 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.450
 very important 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:31.280
 neither this nor the next nor good 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.210
 and it is also important to take us to 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.210
 last zombie 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.470
 Well I'm going to entertain a little 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.079
 and this trick really what this is 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.490
 that we stayed in a window and the 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:49.130
 zombies come to us just for that 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:52.119
 window by no new other site is 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.119
 pretty good the truth 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.909
 here 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.100
 and what we are going to need is also 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:05.340
 that all the players are justly 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:08.039
 here all all once we are all 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.630
 here as we had left a 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.730
 zombie 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.410
 it was quite important to leave it 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.960
 run to arrive as soon as possible 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.470
 possible and catch and kill him here 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.470
 justly 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.080
 for almost the zombies do not come for us 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.560
 no other part of that was the 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:29.890
 trick now we will stay here and one will 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:33.280
 responsible for closing the window and the rest 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:35.500
 to kill and a pretty important thing 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.090
 is that you do not leave this room because it 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.430
 I leave the two floors come by 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.290
 other windows 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.969
 and the doors next door is 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.969
 quite important not to open 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:51.140
 that I enjoyed it a lot and nothing until 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.140
 soon 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:09.090
 to heal 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:09.090
 I'm going here
