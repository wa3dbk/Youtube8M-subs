that's a beautiful thing about this part

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.940 
that's a beautiful thing about this part
the<00:01:12.630> right<00:01:12.810> hand<00:01:13.020> stays<00:01:13.259> the<00:01:13.380> same<00:01:13.409> for<00:01:13.770> all<00:01:13.920> of

the right hand stays the same for all of

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.399 
the right hand stays the same for all of
the<00:01:14.159> verse<00:01:14.369> parts<00:01:15.020> doesn't<00:01:16.020> make<00:01:16.110> it<00:01:16.229> easy

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
the verse parts doesn't make it easy

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.999 
the verse parts doesn't make it easy
makes<00:01:17.040> it<00:01:17.159> easier<00:01:17.460> though<00:01:17.700> okay<00:01:18.830> the<00:01:19.830> hard

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
makes it easier though okay the hard

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.109 
makes it easier though okay the hard
part<00:01:20.220> is<00:01:20.280> that<00:01:20.460> we're<00:01:20.580> playing<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.970> right

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
part is that we're playing the right

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.389 
part is that we're playing the right
hand<00:01:21.330> on<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.630> offbeat's

00:01:22.389 --> 00:01:22.399 
hand on the offbeat's

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:25.910 
hand on the offbeat's
so<00:01:23.399> we're<00:01:23.549> playing<00:01:23.789> two<00:01:24.570> three<00:01:25.320> four<00:01:25.740> if<00:01:25.830> you

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
so we're playing two three four if you

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.090 
so we're playing two three four if you
think<00:01:26.130> about<00:01:26.310> that<00:01:26.490> rhythm<00:01:27.320> one<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.619> two<00:01:28.830> and

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
think about that rhythm one and two and

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.399 
think about that rhythm one and two and
three<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.670> four<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.180> one<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:30.690> two<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:30.990> two

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
three and four and one and two and two

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:39.510 
three and four and one and two and two
and<00:01:31.530> four

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.219 

and<00:01:39.700> in<00:01:40.150> this<00:01:40.210> case<00:01:40.420> we're<00:01:40.630> actually<00:01:40.750> thinking

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
and in this case we're actually thinking

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:44.429 
and in this case we're actually thinking
one<00:01:41.500> two<00:01:41.890> three<00:01:42.460> one<00:01:42.820> two<00:01:42.850> three<00:01:43.299> one<00:01:43.810> two

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:44.439 
one two three one two three one two

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:46.800 
one two three one two three one two
three<00:01:44.619> one<00:01:45.100> and<00:01:45.700> two<00:01:45.880> and<00:01:46.119> three<00:01:46.240> and<00:01:46.390> one<00:01:46.630> and

more<00:03:49.060> complicated<00:03:49.650> complicated<00:03:50.650> than<00:03:50.770> it<00:03:50.890> is

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
more complicated complicated than it is

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.040 
more complicated complicated than it is
the<00:03:51.550> hard<00:03:51.760> part<00:03:51.970> is<00:03:52.090> in<00:03:52.240> the<00:03:52.270> rhythm<00:03:52.570> right<00:03:52.780> so

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.050 
the hard part is in the rhythm right so

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:54.990 
the hard part is in the rhythm right so
this<00:03:53.500> kind<00:03:53.710> of<00:03:53.770> drumming<00:03:54.130> aspect<00:03:54.730> that<00:03:54.850> we're

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
this kind of drumming aspect that we're

this kind of drumming aspect that we're
doing<00:03:55.090> between<00:03:55.750> our<00:03:56.050> hands<00:03:56.290> is<00:03:56.500> what<00:03:56.890> makes

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.070 
doing between our hands is what makes

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.610 
doing between our hands is what makes
