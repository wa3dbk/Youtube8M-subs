00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.960 

ok<00:00:01.230> so<00:00:01.290> it's<00:00:01.530> a<00:00:01.740> it's<00:00:02.310> a<00:00:02.399> simple<00:00:02.669> that<00:00:02.790> doesn't

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
ok so it's a it's a simple that doesn't

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.570 
ok so it's a it's a simple that doesn't
actually<00:00:03.030> get<00:00:03.270> used<00:00:03.449> that<00:00:03.600> much<00:00:03.780> which<00:00:04.740> is<00:00:04.770> an

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
actually get used that much which is an

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.540 
actually get used that much which is an
R<00:00:05.879> with<00:00:06.420> a<00:00:06.480> little<00:00:07.319> cross<00:00:07.799> with<00:00:08.160> a<00:00:08.189> circle

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
R with a little cross with a circle

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.129 
R with a little cross with a circle
around<00:00:08.639> it<00:00:08.880> after<00:00:09.210> it<00:00:09.269> as<00:00:09.420> a<00:00:09.480> suffix<00:00:09.929> at<00:00:10.050> the

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
around it after it as a suffix at the

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.530 
around it after it as a suffix at the
bottom<00:00:10.320> of<00:00:10.440> the<00:00:10.559> the<00:00:10.769> symbol<00:00:11.190> and<00:00:12.120> the<00:00:12.240> R<00:00:12.360> is

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
bottom of the the symbol and the R is

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.270 
bottom of the the symbol and the R is
for<00:00:12.660> radius<00:00:12.990> and<00:00:13.259> the<00:00:13.469> cross<00:00:13.650> with<00:00:13.920> the<00:00:13.980> circle

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
for radius and the cross with the circle

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.310 
for radius and the cross with the circle
around<00:00:14.400> it<00:00:14.730> is<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:15.179> astrological<00:00:15.660> symbol<00:00:16.230> for

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
around it is the astrological symbol for

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.710 
around it is the astrological symbol for
the<00:00:16.440> earth<00:00:16.529> and<00:00:16.910> so<00:00:17.910> it's<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.150> radius<00:00:18.480> of<00:00:18.630> the

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
the earth and so it's the radius of the

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.510 
the earth and so it's the radius of the
earth<00:00:18.779> is<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.050> symbol<00:00:19.439> yeah<00:00:20.039> it's<00:00:20.189> kind<00:00:20.369> of<00:00:20.430> in

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
earth is the symbol yeah it's kind of in

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.920 
earth is the symbol yeah it's kind of in
the<00:00:20.580> news<00:00:20.760> again<00:00:20.910> now<00:00:21.210> I<00:00:21.240> mean<00:00:21.480> you<00:00:21.750> know<00:00:21.840> the

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
the news again now I mean you know the

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.240 
the news again now I mean you know the
radius<00:00:22.199> of<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.410> earth<00:00:22.470> it's<00:00:22.769> sort<00:00:23.039> of<00:00:23.100> fairly

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
radius of the earth it's sort of fairly

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.429 
radius of the earth it's sort of fairly
mundane<00:00:23.460> well-known<00:00:24.330> quantity<00:00:24.779> but<00:00:25.260> it's

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
mundane well-known quantity but it's

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.859 
mundane well-known quantity but it's
become<00:00:25.680> a<00:00:25.710> big<00:00:26.310> issue<00:00:26.340> again<00:00:26.849> because<00:00:27.599> people

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
become a big issue again because people

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.120 
become a big issue again because people
have<00:00:27.990> started<00:00:28.140> discovering<00:00:28.710> all<00:00:28.980> these

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
have started discovering all these

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.980 
have started discovering all these
planets<00:00:29.369> outside<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.880> solar<00:00:30.029> system<00:00:30.240> and

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
planets outside the solar system and

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.359 
planets outside the solar system and
obviously<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.529> big<00:00:31.800> question<00:00:32.189> that<00:00:32.219> everyone

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
obviously the big question that everyone

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.280 
obviously the big question that everyone
wants<00:00:32.790> answered<00:00:32.969> is<00:00:33.390> are<00:00:33.719> they<00:00:33.960> like<00:00:34.140> the

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
wants answered is are they like the

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.530 
wants answered is are they like the
earth<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:35.190> so<00:00:35.700> one<00:00:35.910> of<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.149> simplest

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
earth and so one of the simplest

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:37.970 
earth and so one of the simplest
measurements<00:00:37.079> that<00:00:37.170> you<00:00:37.200> can<00:00:37.410> make<00:00:37.559> is<00:00:37.800> to

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
measurements that you can make is to

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.560 
measurements that you can make is to
measure<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.430> radius<00:00:38.820> of<00:00:38.969> them<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.239> say<00:00:39.360> well

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
measure the radius of them and say well

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.030 
measure the radius of them and say well
if<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.840> radius<00:00:40.110> is<00:00:40.290> kind<00:00:40.590> of<00:00:40.649> you<00:00:40.710> know<00:00:40.829> maybe

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
if the radius is kind of you know maybe

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.560 
if the radius is kind of you know maybe
one<00:00:41.340> or<00:00:41.489> two<00:00:41.520> times<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:42.090> radius<00:00:42.120> of<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.540> earth

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
one or two times the radius of the earth

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.110 
one or two times the radius of the earth
then<00:00:42.870> that's<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.140> planet<00:00:43.440> that's<00:00:43.590> earth-like

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.120 
then that's a planet that's earth-like

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.549 
then that's a planet that's earth-like
whereas<00:00:45.120> if<00:00:45.270> it's<00:00:45.390> say<00:00:45.539> ten<00:00:45.809> times<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.230> radius

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
whereas if it's say ten times the radius

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.350 
whereas if it's say ten times the radius
of<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.770> earth<00:00:46.890> that's<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.969> radius<00:00:48.210> of

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
of the earth that's the radius of

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.549 
of the earth that's the radius of
Jupiter<00:00:48.719> for<00:00:48.870> example<00:00:49.230> so<00:00:49.350> that's<00:00:49.440> a

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
Jupiter for example so that's a

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.139 
Jupiter for example so that's a
jupiter-like<00:00:49.950> planet<00:00:50.399> so<00:00:50.550> it's<00:00:50.700> not<00:00:50.789> like<00:00:51.030> the

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
jupiter-like planet so it's not like the

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.430 
jupiter-like planet so it's not like the
earth<00:00:51.239> so<00:00:51.510> it's<00:00:51.629> really<00:00:51.780> a<00:00:51.930> way<00:00:52.110> of<00:00:52.140> measuring

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
earth so it's really a way of measuring

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.110 
earth so it's really a way of measuring
whether<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:52.860> planets<00:00:53.219> like<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.489> earth<00:00:53.670> or<00:00:53.940> not

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
whether a planets like the earth or not

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.270 
whether a planets like the earth or not
by<00:00:54.300> measuring<00:00:54.629> its<00:00:54.809> radius<00:00:55.199> in<00:00:55.350> Earth<00:00:55.559> radii<00:00:55.860> I

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
by measuring its radius in Earth radii I

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.040 
by measuring its radius in Earth radii I
mean<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.670> whole<00:00:56.820> field<00:00:57.090> of<00:00:57.329> looking<00:00:57.960> at

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
mean the whole field of looking at

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.389 
mean the whole field of looking at
planets<00:00:58.350> outside<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.710> solar<00:00:58.829> system<00:00:59.070> we've

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
planets outside the solar system we've

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:00.680 
planets outside the solar system we've
exploded<00:00:59.910> you<00:00:59.969> know<00:01:00.059> it's<00:01:00.180> really<00:01:00.300> I<00:01:00.420> mean<00:01:00.480> in

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
exploded you know it's really I mean in

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.869 
exploded you know it's really I mean in
the<00:01:00.780> last<00:01:00.989> 15<00:01:01.649> years<00:01:01.680> that<00:01:02.280> we've<00:01:02.489> found<00:01:02.579> any

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
the last 15 years that we've found any

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.369 
the last 15 years that we've found any
planets<00:01:03.270> outside<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.629> solar<00:01:03.780> system<00:01:03.989> at<00:01:04.320> all

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
planets outside the solar system at all

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.929 
planets outside the solar system at all
and<00:01:04.680> now<00:01:04.949> we're<00:01:05.129> up<00:01:05.189> around<00:01:05.489> four<00:01:05.700> or<00:01:05.729> five

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
and now we're up around four or five

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.490 
and now we're up around four or five
hundred<00:01:06.150> planets<00:01:06.540> known<00:01:06.810> outside<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.350> solar

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
hundred planets known outside the solar

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.350 
hundred planets known outside the solar
system<00:01:07.590> but<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.610> reason<00:01:08.880> why<00:01:09.000> it's<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.210> big

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
system but the reason why it's a big

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.390 
system but the reason why it's a big
story<00:01:09.600> at<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.780> moment<00:01:10.080> is<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.320> new<00:01:10.979> satellite

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
story at the moment is a new satellite

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.030 
story at the moment is a new satellite
has<00:01:11.760> gone<00:01:11.939> up<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.630> telescope<00:01:13.290> called<00:01:13.680> Kepler

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
has gone up a telescope called Kepler

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.910 
has gone up a telescope called Kepler
and<00:01:14.220> Kepler's<00:01:15.060> whole<00:01:15.330> job<00:01:15.720> is<00:01:16.080> to<00:01:16.439> try<00:01:16.860> and

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
and Kepler's whole job is to try and

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.429 
and Kepler's whole job is to try and
find<00:01:17.250> more<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:17.729> more<00:01:17.790> these<00:01:18.060> exoplanets<00:01:18.600> and

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
find more and more these exoplanets and

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:20.270 
find more and more these exoplanets and
they've<00:01:19.590> just<00:01:19.740> released<00:01:19.920> their<00:01:20.130> first

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
they've just released their first

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.950 
they've just released their first
results<00:01:20.700> that<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.000> telescope's<00:01:21.720> been<00:01:21.869> up

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
results that the telescope's been up

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.120 
results that the telescope's been up
there<00:01:22.049> for<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.259> more<00:01:22.439> than<00:01:22.530> a<00:01:22.619> year<00:01:22.830> now<00:01:22.860> but

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
there for a more than a year now but

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.080 
there for a more than a year now but
they've<00:01:23.250> actually<00:01:23.400> just<00:01:23.700> released<00:01:23.939> their

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
they've actually just released their

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.700 
they've actually just released their
first<00:01:24.240> results<00:01:24.689> and<00:01:24.810> they<00:01:24.869> found<00:01:25.020> about<00:01:25.380> about

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
first results and they found about about

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.100 
first results and they found about about
five<00:01:26.070> planets<00:01:26.610> just<00:01:27.240> from<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.479> it<00:01:27.720> was<00:01:27.810> sort

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
five planets just from the it was sort

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.300 
five planets just from the it was sort
of<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.229> first<00:01:28.380> six<00:01:28.619> weeks<00:01:28.740> of<00:01:28.920> data<00:01:29.130> they

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
of the first six weeks of data they

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.340 
of the first six weeks of data they
looked<00:01:29.520> at<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:30.659> they're<00:01:30.840> already<00:01:30.960> rumors

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
looked at and they're already rumors

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.780 
looked at and they're already rumors
that<00:01:31.680> there<00:01:31.799> are<00:01:31.890> many<00:01:32.040> more<00:01:32.220> planets<00:01:32.610> in

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
that there are many more planets in

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.770 
that there are many more planets in
there<00:01:32.970> as<00:01:33.060> well<00:01:33.240> it<00:01:33.659> uses<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.049> technique<00:01:34.680> called

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
there as well it uses a technique called

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.440 
there as well it uses a technique called
occupations<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.520> basic<00:01:38.520> idea<00:01:38.610> is<00:01:39.060> that

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
occupations and the basic idea is that

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.179 
occupations and the basic idea is that
if<00:01:39.570> you<00:01:39.600> happen<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:39.960> have<00:01:40.049> a<00:01:40.110> system<00:01:41.040> where

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
if you happen to have a system where

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.710 
if you happen to have a system where
you've<00:01:41.310> got<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.490> star<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.150> a<00:01:42.180> planet<00:01:42.210> orbiting

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
you've got a star and a planet orbiting

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.120 
you've got a star and a planet orbiting
around<00:01:42.840> it<00:01:43.079> and<00:01:43.200> it<00:01:43.290> happens<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:43.560> be<00:01:43.619> exactly<00:01:44.070> a

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
around it and it happens to be exactly a

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.280 
around it and it happens to be exactly a
John<00:01:44.460> then<00:01:45.149> every<00:01:45.420> time<00:01:45.600> that<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:45.990> planet

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
John then every time that the planet

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.319 
John then every time that the planet
goes<00:01:46.470> around<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:47.399> planet<00:01:47.700> comes<00:01:47.850> between<00:01:48.210> you

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
goes around the planet comes between you

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.550 
goes around the planet comes between you
and<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.540> stars<00:01:48.780> now<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.049> planets<00:01:49.380> a<00:01:49.439> lot

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
and the stars now the planets a lot

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.840 
and the stars now the planets a lot
smaller<00:01:49.829> than<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.159> star<00:01:50.369> so<00:01:50.579> it<00:01:50.640> doesn't

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
smaller than the star so it doesn't

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.429 
smaller than the star so it doesn't
block<00:01:51.030> out<00:01:51.240> all<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.750> light<00:01:51.869> of<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.110> star<00:01:52.290> but

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
block out all the light of the star but

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:53.630 
block out all the light of the star but
it<00:01:52.530> blocks<00:01:52.770> out<00:01:52.920> a<00:01:52.950> little<00:01:53.310> bit<00:01:53.399> of<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.549> light

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
it blocks out a little bit of the light

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.940 
it blocks out a little bit of the light
of<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:53.909> star<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.329> so<00:01:54.810> some<00:01:55.049> tiny<00:01:55.350> fraction<00:01:55.860> of

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
of the star and so some tiny fraction of

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.310 
of the star and so some tiny fraction of
a<00:01:56.040> percentage<00:01:56.460> of<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:56.670> light<00:01:56.820> point<00:01:57.180> 1.0<00:01:57.719> 1%

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
a percentage of the light point 1.0 1%

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.840 
a percentage of the light point 1.0 1%
of<00:01:58.439> the<00:01:58.530> light<00:01:58.680> of<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.070> star<00:01:59.369> gets<00:01:59.549> blocked

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
of the light of the star gets blocked

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.819 
of the light of the star gets blocked
out<00:02:00.060> by<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.299> passage<00:02:00.659> of<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:01.079> planet<00:02:01.740> in

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
out by the passage of the planet in

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.550 
out by the passage of the planet in
front<00:02:02.009> of<00:02:02.100> it<00:02:02.189> and<00:02:02.310> this<00:02:03.229> telescope<00:02:04.229> is<00:02:04.380> so

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
front of it and this telescope is so

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.840 
front of it and this telescope is so
sensitive<00:02:05.040> that<00:02:05.070> you<00:02:05.250> can<00:02:05.430> actually<00:02:05.549> measure

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
sensitive that you can actually measure

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.479 
sensitive that you can actually measure
those<00:02:06.090> tiny<00:02:06.360> little<00:02:06.540> dips<00:02:06.930> now<00:02:07.890> it's<00:02:08.250> a<00:02:08.310> little

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
those tiny little dips now it's a little

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:09.949 
those tiny little dips now it's a little
more<00:02:08.610> complicated<00:02:08.910> than<00:02:09.239> that<00:02:09.330> because<00:02:09.750> there

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
more complicated than that because there

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.150 
more complicated than that because there
are<00:02:10.050> lots<00:02:10.170> of<00:02:10.259> things<00:02:10.440> that<00:02:10.560> can<00:02:10.739> make<00:02:10.830> stars

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
are lots of things that can make stars

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.800 
are lots of things that can make stars
vary<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.520> sun's<00:02:11.730> output<00:02:12.150> varies<00:02:12.450> a<00:02:12.480> bit<00:02:12.629> when

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
vary the sun's output varies a bit when

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.490 
vary the sun's output varies a bit when
there's<00:02:12.959> a<00:02:13.020> solar

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
there's a solar

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.380 
there's a solar
gets<00:02:13.740> a<00:02:13.800> bit<00:02:13.920> brighter<00:02:14.160> and<00:02:14.310> so<00:02:14.520> on<00:02:14.670> so<00:02:15.240> there's

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
gets a bit brighter and so on so there's

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:16.610 
gets a bit brighter and so on so there's
lots<00:02:15.510> of<00:02:15.600> ways<00:02:15.750> that<00:02:15.780> stars<00:02:16.080> can<00:02:16.320> get<00:02:16.440> brighter

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
lots of ways that stars can get brighter

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:17.990 
lots of ways that stars can get brighter
and<00:02:16.830> dimmer<00:02:16.920> but<00:02:17.430> if<00:02:17.580> you<00:02:17.670> see<00:02:17.850> this

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
and dimmer but if you see this

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.610 
and dimmer but if you see this
characteristic<00:02:18.630> signature<00:02:18.810> of<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:19.320> signal

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
characteristic signature of the signal

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.560 
characteristic signature of the signal
dipping<00:02:19.950> in<00:02:20.460> a<00:02:20.670> periodic<00:02:21.150> fashion<00:02:21.270> so

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
dipping in a periodic fashion so

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.110 
dipping in a periodic fashion so
regularly<00:02:22.020> every<00:02:23.010> time<00:02:23.220> that<00:02:23.400> the<00:02:23.700> something

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
regularly every time that the something

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.490 
regularly every time that the something
orbits<00:02:24.390> around<00:02:24.480> it<00:02:24.780> then<00:02:24.930> you<00:02:25.050> really<00:02:25.350> got<00:02:25.440> a

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
orbits around it then you really got a

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.900 
orbits around it then you really got a
pretty<00:02:25.770> strong<00:02:25.860> indication<00:02:26.490> there<00:02:26.820> is

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
pretty strong indication there is

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.760 
pretty strong indication there is
actually<00:02:27.150> a<00:02:27.210> planet<00:02:27.450> in<00:02:27.660> orbit<00:02:27.750> around<00:02:28.140> so<00:02:28.620> the

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
actually a planet in orbit around so the

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.410 
actually a planet in orbit around so the
neat<00:02:28.920> thing<00:02:29.130> about<00:02:29.190> this<00:02:29.550> technique<00:02:29.910> is<00:02:30.150> it's

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
neat thing about this technique is it's

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.670 
neat thing about this technique is it's
actually<00:02:30.540> one<00:02:30.900> of<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:31.050> few<00:02:31.200> techniques<00:02:31.530> you

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
actually one of the few techniques you

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.020 
actually one of the few techniques you
can<00:02:31.770> actually<00:02:31.920> use<00:02:32.190> to<00:02:32.220> measure<00:02:32.520> the<00:02:32.700> radius

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
can actually use to measure the radius

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.520 
can actually use to measure the radius
of<00:02:33.120> a<00:02:33.180> planet<00:02:33.450> because<00:02:33.660> of<00:02:33.750> course<00:02:33.930> the<00:02:34.230> amount

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
of a planet because of course the amount

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.620 
of a planet because of course the amount
of<00:02:34.710> light<00:02:34.950> that<00:02:34.980> gets<00:02:35.250> blocked<00:02:35.550> out<00:02:35.820> depends

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
of light that gets blocked out depends

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.270 
of light that gets blocked out depends
on<00:02:36.720> how<00:02:36.840> big<00:02:37.080> the<00:02:37.230> planet<00:02:37.350> actually<00:02:37.620> is<00:02:37.890> big

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
on how big the planet actually is big

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.530 
on how big the planet actually is big
planets<00:02:38.580> block<00:02:38.760> out<00:02:38.880> more<00:02:39.030> the<00:02:39.150> light<00:02:39.270> little

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
planets block out more the light little

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.300 
planets block out more the light little
planets<00:02:39.780> block<00:02:39.930> out<00:02:40.050> less<00:02:40.230> of<00:02:40.350> the<00:02:40.410> light<00:02:40.530> and

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
planets block out less of the light and

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.170 
planets block out less of the light and
so<00:02:41.430> you<00:02:41.520> can<00:02:41.640> actually<00:02:41.760> get<00:02:41.940> a<00:02:42.000> pretty

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
so you can actually get a pretty

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.090 
so you can actually get a pretty
reliable<00:02:42.750> measurement<00:02:43.170> as<00:02:43.260> to<00:02:43.410> how<00:02:43.530> big<00:02:43.830> these

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
reliable measurement as to how big these

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.250 
reliable measurement as to how big these
planets<00:02:44.490> actually<00:02:44.640> are<00:02:44.930> and<00:02:45.930> they're<00:02:46.080> now

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
planets actually are and they're now

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260 
planets actually are and they're now
finally<00:02:46.830> getting<00:02:47.100> down<00:02:47.280> to<00:02:47.610> the<00:02:47.730> sizes<00:02:48.240> of

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
finally getting down to the sizes of

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:49.910 
finally getting down to the sizes of
planets<00:02:48.720> that<00:02:48.840> we<00:02:48.990> are<00:02:49.200> kind<00:02:49.410> of<00:02:49.560> comparable

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
planets that we are kind of comparable

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.260 
planets that we are kind of comparable
to<00:02:50.040> the<00:02:50.100> earth<00:02:50.190> so<00:02:50.430> the<00:02:50.640> smaller<00:02:50.880> that<00:02:51.150> they

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
to the earth so the smaller that they

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.350 
to the earth so the smaller that they
found<00:02:51.590> is<00:02:52.590> about<00:02:52.650> four<00:02:53.280> times<00:02:53.610> the<00:02:53.880> radius<00:02:54.209> of

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
found is about four times the radius of

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.490 
found is about four times the radius of
the<00:02:54.420> earth<00:02:54.510> so<00:02:54.690> you<00:02:54.720> really<00:02:55.020> are<00:02:55.140> getting<00:02:55.230> down

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
the earth so you really are getting down

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.650 
the earth so you really are getting down
to<00:02:55.709> now<00:02:55.860> fairly<00:02:56.490> earth-like<00:02:57.060> planets<00:02:57.480> still<00:02:57.630> a

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
to now fairly earth-like planets still a

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:58.820 
to now fairly earth-like planets still a
bit<00:02:57.810> bigger<00:02:58.020> than<00:02:58.110> the<00:02:58.290> earth<00:02:58.410> but<00:02:58.470> really

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
bit bigger than the earth but really

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.290 
bit bigger than the earth but really
getting<00:02:58.980> to<00:02:59.130> that<00:02:59.250> sort<00:02:59.520> of<00:02:59.550> size

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.330 

I<00:03:02.470> mean<00:03:03.470> it's<00:03:03.590> not<00:03:03.680> a<00:03:03.740> particularly<00:03:04.040> well

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
I mean it's not a particularly well

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.220 
I mean it's not a particularly well
defined<00:03:04.640> quantity<00:03:05.390> for<00:03:05.570> example<00:03:05.600> do<00:03:06.110> you

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
defined quantity for example do you

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.290 
defined quantity for example do you
measure<00:03:06.470> to<00:03:07.040> the<00:03:07.490> lowest<00:03:07.850> point<00:03:08.060> on<00:03:08.150> earth

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 
measure to the lowest point on earth

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:09.790 
measure to the lowest point on earth
which<00:03:08.600> is<00:03:08.630> the<00:03:08.750> bottom<00:03:09.170> of<00:03:09.350> the<00:03:09.410> Pacific<00:03:09.530> Ocean

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
which is the bottom of the Pacific Ocean

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.380 
which is the bottom of the Pacific Ocean
somewhere<00:03:10.160> do<00:03:10.490> you<00:03:10.580> measure<00:03:10.820> to<00:03:11.090> the<00:03:11.180> highest

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
somewhere do you measure to the highest

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:12.730 
somewhere do you measure to the highest
point<00:03:11.690> on<00:03:11.870> earth<00:03:11.930> which<00:03:12.290> is<00:03:12.410> top<00:03:12.530> of<00:03:12.650> a

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:12.740 
point on earth which is top of a

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:14.860 
point on earth which is top of a
mountain<00:03:13.100> somewhere<00:03:13.280> do<00:03:14.270> you<00:03:14.360> measure<00:03:14.510> to<00:03:14.690> sea

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
mountain somewhere do you measure to sea

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.890 
mountain somewhere do you measure to sea
level<00:03:15.340> and<00:03:16.340> of<00:03:16.610> course<00:03:16.760> the<00:03:16.970> the<00:03:17.420> earth<00:03:17.510> easily

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
level and of course the the earth easily

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.810 
level and of course the the earth easily
exactly<00:03:18.350> round<00:03:18.590> because<00:03:19.010> it's<00:03:19.190> rotating<00:03:19.700> it

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
exactly round because it's rotating it

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.610 
exactly round because it's rotating it
actually<00:03:20.090> ends<00:03:20.480> up<00:03:20.540> bulging<00:03:21.050> out<00:03:21.170> a<00:03:21.230> bit<00:03:21.470> in

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
actually ends up bulging out a bit in

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.100 
actually ends up bulging out a bit in
the<00:03:21.890> equator<00:03:22.310> so<00:03:22.610> it's<00:03:23.450> about<00:03:23.630> 30<00:03:23.930> or<00:03:24.080> 40

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 
the equator so it's about 30 or 40

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:25.900 
the equator so it's about 30 or 40
kilometers<00:03:24.770> bigger<00:03:25.070> at<00:03:25.250> the<00:03:25.280> equator<00:03:25.580> than<00:03:25.730> it

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
kilometers bigger at the equator than it

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.270 
kilometers bigger at the equator than it
is<00:03:26.000> at<00:03:26.120> the<00:03:26.180> poles<00:03:26.390> it's<00:03:26.630> a<00:03:26.720> bit<00:03:26.900> squashed<00:03:27.280> and

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
is at the poles it's a bit squashed and

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.200 
is at the poles it's a bit squashed and
so<00:03:28.490> there's<00:03:28.700> lots<00:03:28.760> of<00:03:28.910> different

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:29.210 
so there's lots of different

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:30.670 
so there's lots of different
measurements<00:03:29.720> you<00:03:29.930> can<00:03:29.960> make<00:03:30.200> you<00:03:30.500> can<00:03:30.530> make

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
measurements you can make you can make

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.470 
measurements you can make you can make
but<00:03:31.430> in<00:03:31.580> terms<00:03:31.790> of<00:03:31.940> actually<00:03:32.210> you<00:03:32.270> know

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
but in terms of actually you know

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:33.730 
but in terms of actually you know
comparing<00:03:32.960> the<00:03:33.050> size<00:03:33.230> of<00:03:33.350> the<00:03:33.410> earth<00:03:33.500> to<00:03:33.620> other

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:33.740 
comparing the size of the earth to other

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:34.690 
comparing the size of the earth to other
things<00:03:33.920> it<00:03:34.040> really<00:03:34.130> doesn't<00:03:34.490> matter<00:03:34.550> that

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
things it really doesn't matter that

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.250 
things it really doesn't matter that
much<00:03:34.910> all<00:03:35.150> you<00:03:35.300> really<00:03:35.450> need<00:03:35.690> to<00:03:35.720> know<00:03:35.840> is<00:03:36.110> the

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
much all you really need to know is the

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:37.690 
much all you really need to know is the
radius<00:03:36.590> of<00:03:36.680> the<00:03:36.830> earth<00:03:36.860> is<00:03:37.160> a<00:03:37.310> little<00:03:37.580> less

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
radius of the earth is a little less

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.180 
radius of the earth is a little less
than<00:03:37.880> 6,400<00:03:38.510> kilometers<00:03:38.840> does<00:03:39.800> that<00:03:39.950> mean

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
than 6,400 kilometers does that mean

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.730 
than 6,400 kilometers does that mean
that<00:03:40.610> earth<00:03:41.210> radius<00:03:41.810> is<00:03:42.050> a<00:03:42.080> bit<00:03:42.320> like<00:03:42.470> the<00:03:42.620> wave

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:42.740 
that earth radius is a bit like the wave

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:44.440 
that earth radius is a bit like the wave
journalists<00:03:43.340> use<00:03:43.580> Olympic<00:03:44.180> sized<00:03:44.420> swimming

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
journalists use Olympic sized swimming

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.360 
journalists use Olympic sized swimming
pools<00:03:45.140> or<00:03:45.380> double-decker<00:03:45.890> buses<00:03:46.250> and

football<00:03:46.760> fields<00:03:47.120> it's<00:03:47.240> just<00:03:47.420> to<00:03:47.510> help<00:03:47.660> give

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
football fields it's just to help give

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.840 
football fields it's just to help give
an<00:03:47.960> idea<00:03:48.380> of<00:03:48.500> scale<00:03:48.590> exactly<00:03:49.160> it's<00:03:49.460> a<00:03:49.580> way<00:03:49.820> of

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850 
an idea of scale exactly it's a way of

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:51.250 
an idea of scale exactly it's a way of
just<00:03:49.970> measuring<00:03:50.630> the<00:03:50.690> size<00:03:50.810> of<00:03:50.990> things<00:03:51.110> and

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
just measuring the size of things and

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.620 
just measuring the size of things and
it's<00:03:51.380> you<00:03:51.890> know<00:03:52.010> it's<00:03:52.160> a<00:03:52.220> useful<00:03:52.430> thing<00:03:52.630> partly

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
it's you know it's a useful thing partly

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:54.520 
it's you know it's a useful thing partly
because<00:03:53.720> it's<00:03:53.900> something<00:03:54.050> that<00:03:54.260> sort<00:03:54.410> of

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
because it's something that sort of

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.410 
because it's something that sort of
people<00:03:54.800> can<00:03:54.950> slightly<00:03:55.220> relate<00:03:55.550> to<00:03:55.760> but<00:03:56.270> also

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
people can slightly relate to but also

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.210 
people can slightly relate to but also
because<00:03:56.780> line<00:03:57.200> behind<00:03:57.620> it<00:03:57.890> there<00:03:58.010> is<00:03:58.100> this

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
because line behind it there is this

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:59.800 
because line behind it there is this
question<00:03:58.460> is<00:03:58.820> this<00:03:59.030> a<00:03:59.090> planet<00:03:59.450> like<00:03:59.480> the<00:03:59.750> earth

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
question is this a planet like the earth

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.210 
question is this a planet like the earth
and<00:04:00.110> so<00:04:00.290> measuring<00:04:00.680> something<00:04:01.040> in<00:04:01.130> Earth

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
and so measuring something in Earth

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.340 
and so measuring something in Earth
radii<00:04:01.520> gives<00:04:01.910> you<00:04:01.970> an<00:04:02.090> immediate<00:04:02.570> feeling<00:04:02.750> you

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:03.350 
radii gives you an immediate feeling you

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:04.930 
radii gives you an immediate feeling you
know<00:04:03.440> it's<00:04:03.650> four<00:04:04.070> times<00:04:04.280> the<00:04:04.490> radius<00:04:04.760> of<00:04:04.880> the

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:04.940 
know it's four times the radius of the

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:06.160 
know it's four times the radius of the
earth<00:04:05.000> so<00:04:05.240> it's<00:04:05.390> not<00:04:05.480> quite<00:04:05.750> like<00:04:05.960> the<00:04:06.080> earth

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
earth so it's not quite like the earth

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:07.300 
earth so it's not quite like the earth
but<00:04:06.350> it's<00:04:06.470> not<00:04:06.500> that<00:04:06.709> different<00:04:06.920> from<00:04:07.190> the

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
but it's not that different from the

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:08.650 
but it's not that different from the
earth<00:04:07.400> or<00:04:07.550> its<00:04:07.640> twenty<00:04:07.970> times<00:04:08.150> the<00:04:08.270> radius<00:04:08.540> of

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
earth or its twenty times the radius of

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
earth or its twenty times the radius of
the<00:04:08.750> earth<00:04:08.780> then<00:04:09.110> it's<00:04:09.260> really<00:04:09.500> not<00:04:09.620> very

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
the earth then it's really not very

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.800 
the earth then it's really not very
likely<00:04:10.010> other<00:04:10.310> tool<00:04:10.520> does<00:04:11.180> something<00:04:11.600> have<00:04:11.780> to

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
likely other tool does something have to

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.260 
likely other tool does something have to
be<00:04:11.930> similar<00:04:12.440> to<00:04:12.470> the<00:04:12.709> size<00:04:12.860> of<00:04:13.160> the<00:04:13.340> earth<00:04:13.400> to

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:14.270 
be similar to the size of the earth to

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:16.750 
be similar to the size of the earth to
have<00:04:14.540> earth-like<00:04:14.989> conditions<00:04:15.520> that's<00:04:16.520> not

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
have earth-like conditions that's not

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.180 
have earth-like conditions that's not
really<00:04:17.090> clear<00:04:17.330> I<00:04:17.600> mean<00:04:17.810> the<00:04:17.959> what<00:04:18.350> the<00:04:18.859> problem

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
really clear I mean the what the problem

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:20.650 
really clear I mean the what the problem
is<00:04:19.340> there<00:04:19.760> are<00:04:19.850> lots<00:04:19.970> of<00:04:20.060> things<00:04:20.239> that<00:04:20.299> go<00:04:20.390> into

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
is there are lots of things that go into

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.420 
is there are lots of things that go into
you<00:04:21.109> know<00:04:21.230> whether<00:04:21.380> a<00:04:21.500> planet<00:04:21.919> ends<00:04:22.160> up<00:04:22.250> like

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
you know whether a planet ends up like

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:23.830 
you know whether a planet ends up like
the<00:04:22.550> earth<00:04:22.669> like<00:04:22.940> you<00:04:23.000> know<00:04:23.180> how<00:04:23.300> close<00:04:23.540> it<00:04:23.750> is

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
the earth like you know how close it is

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.720 
the earth like you know how close it is
to<00:04:23.960> its<00:04:24.110> stars<00:04:24.440> or<00:04:24.740> whether<00:04:24.890> water<00:04:25.340> is<00:04:25.520> liquid

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:25.730 
to its stars or whether water is liquid

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:27.430 
to its stars or whether water is liquid
those<00:04:26.120> kinds<00:04:26.419> of<00:04:26.450> things<00:04:26.630> one<00:04:27.290> of<00:04:27.320> the

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
those kinds of things one of the

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.140 
those kinds of things one of the
important<00:04:27.830> things<00:04:28.010> is<00:04:28.250> what<00:04:28.550> the<00:04:28.640> gravity<00:04:28.820> is

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
important things is what the gravity is

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:30.190 
important things is what the gravity is
because<00:04:29.360> obviously<00:04:29.450> if<00:04:29.720> the<00:04:29.840> pull<00:04:30.050> of<00:04:30.169> gravity

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.200 
because obviously if the pull of gravity

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.440 
because obviously if the pull of gravity
was<00:04:30.740> ten<00:04:31.340> times<00:04:31.550> what<00:04:31.850> it<00:04:31.910> is<00:04:32.090> on<00:04:32.210> the<00:04:32.330> earth

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:32.450 
was ten times what it is on the earth

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:34.000 
was ten times what it is on the earth
then<00:04:32.750> things<00:04:33.140> would<00:04:33.260> be<00:04:33.350> a<00:04:33.380> lot<00:04:33.530> more<00:04:33.560> squashed

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.010 
then things would be a lot more squashed

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:35.230 
then things would be a lot more squashed
if<00:04:34.190> the<00:04:34.280> pull<00:04:34.430> of<00:04:34.490> gravity<00:04:34.520> is<00:04:34.820> a<00:04:34.880> lot<00:04:35.000> less

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
if the pull of gravity is a lot less

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.670 
if the pull of gravity is a lot less
then<00:04:35.510> there's<00:04:35.780> you<00:04:35.930> know<00:04:35.960> the<00:04:36.169> less<00:04:36.350> to<00:04:36.530> hold

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
then there's you know the less to hold

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.260 
then there's you know the less to hold
things<00:04:36.860> onto<00:04:37.010> the<00:04:37.160> surface<00:04:37.490> so<00:04:38.060> for<00:04:38.210> an

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
things onto the surface so for an

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:39.670 
things onto the surface so for an
earth-like<00:04:38.480> planet<00:04:38.600> you<00:04:39.050> probably<00:04:39.380> want<00:04:39.620> the

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 
earth-like planet you probably want the

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.140 
earth-like planet you probably want the
pull<00:04:39.830> of<00:04:39.919> gravity<00:04:39.950> to<00:04:40.430> be<00:04:40.520> comparable<00:04:40.880> to<00:04:41.000> the

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
pull of gravity to be comparable to the

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.390 
pull of gravity to be comparable to the
earth<00:04:41.240> and<00:04:41.450> so<00:04:41.620> one<00:04:42.620> way<00:04:42.770> of<00:04:42.890> doing<00:04:43.010> that<00:04:43.160> if

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
earth and so one way of doing that if

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.040 
earth and so one way of doing that if
something<00:04:43.730> is<00:04:43.850> the<00:04:43.970> same<00:04:44.180> density<00:04:44.540> is<00:04:44.900> the

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
something is the same density is the

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:46.810 
something is the same density is the
earth<00:04:45.140> if<00:04:45.470> you<00:04:46.010> want<00:04:46.160> the<00:04:46.220> pull<00:04:46.370> of<00:04:46.460> gravity<00:04:46.490> to

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:46.820 
earth if you want the pull of gravity to

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:47.770 
earth if you want the pull of gravity to
be<00:04:46.910> the<00:04:47.030> same<00:04:47.150> then<00:04:47.270> it<00:04:47.390> really<00:04:47.510> has<00:04:47.630> to<00:04:47.720> be

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780 
be the same then it really has to be

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:49.659 
be the same then it really has to be
more<00:04:48.050> less<00:04:48.169> the<00:04:48.290> same<00:04:48.410> size<00:04:48.470> now<00:04:49.340> one<00:04:49.520> of<00:04:49.550> the

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:49.669 
more less the same size now one of the

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:51.010 
more less the same size now one of the
interesting<00:04:49.850> things<00:04:50.360> about<00:04:50.450> these<00:04:50.720> planets

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.020 
interesting things about these planets

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:52.360 
interesting things about these planets
that<00:04:51.230> are<00:04:51.320> just<00:04:51.440> being<00:04:51.620> discovered<00:04:52.160> with<00:04:52.280> the

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
that are just being discovered with the

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.100 
that are just being discovered with the
Kepler<00:04:52.700> satellite<00:04:52.820> is<00:04:53.270> they're<00:04:53.660> not<00:04:53.900> all

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 
Kepler satellite is they're not all

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:55.600 
Kepler satellite is they're not all
comparable<00:04:54.620> in<00:04:54.860> density<00:04:55.250> to<00:04:55.370> the<00:04:55.400> earth

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:55.610 
comparable in density to the earth

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:57.610 
comparable in density to the earth
there's<00:04:56.390> this<00:04:56.510> ridiculous<00:04:57.080> planet<00:04:57.410> out<00:04:57.590> there

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620 
there's this ridiculous planet out there

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.200 
there's this ridiculous planet out there
which<00:04:57.980> actually<00:04:58.250> has<00:04:58.400> a<00:04:58.430> density<00:04:58.790> that's<00:04:59.060> sort

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210 
which actually has a density that's sort

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:00.940 
which actually has a density that's sort
of<00:04:59.240> comparable<00:04:59.630> to<00:04:59.720> styrofoam<00:05:00.230> incredibly

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:00.950 
of comparable to styrofoam incredibly

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:03.790 
of comparable to styrofoam incredibly
low<00:05:01.130> density<00:05:01.580> planet<00:05:01.990> so<00:05:02.990> actually<00:05:03.020> you<00:05:03.560> could

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:03.800 
low density planet so actually you could

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.500 
low density planet so actually you could
end<00:05:03.950> up<00:05:04.070> with<00:05:04.130> earth-like<00:05:04.760> gravity<00:05:04.820> on<00:05:05.450> a

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:05.510 
end up with earth-like gravity on a

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:06.790 
end up with earth-like gravity on a
planet<00:05:06.140> which<00:05:06.260> is<00:05:06.290> a<00:05:06.380> completely<00:05:06.710> different

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 
planet which is a completely different

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.350 
planet which is a completely different
size<00:05:07.220> from<00:05:07.400> the<00:05:07.460> earth<00:05:07.640> so<00:05:07.820> in<00:05:08.000> the<00:05:08.090> light<00:05:08.180> of

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.360 
size from the earth so in the light of

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:09.550 
size from the earth so in the light of
these<00:05:08.450> new<00:05:08.510> discoveries<00:05:09.140> we<00:05:09.320> may<00:05:09.410> actually

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560 
these new discoveries we may actually

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.170 
these new discoveries we may actually
have<00:05:09.800> to<00:05:09.830> kind<00:05:10.250> of<00:05:10.280> change<00:05:10.550> our<00:05:10.729> views<00:05:10.910> a<00:05:10.970> bit

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.180 
have to kind of change our views a bit

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:15.570 
have to kind of change our views a bit
about<00:05:11.360> what<00:05:11.780> planets<00:05:12.140> really<00:05:12.380> are<00:05:12.650> worth<00:05:12.860> like

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:15.580 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.770 

is<00:05:16.580> not<00:05:16.729> a<00:05:16.759> new<00:05:16.910> question<00:05:17.060> at<00:05:17.360> all<00:05:17.449> people<00:05:17.630> have

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:17.780 
is not a new question at all people have

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:18.700 
is not a new question at all people have
worried<00:05:18.080> about<00:05:18.139> it<00:05:18.350> I<00:05:18.380> mean<00:05:18.530> ever<00:05:18.650> since

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710 
worried about it I mean ever since

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:19.900 
worried about it I mean ever since
basically<00:05:19.250> ever<00:05:19.430> since<00:05:19.490> you<00:05:19.729> started

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:19.910 
basically ever since you started

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:21.430 
basically ever since you started
thinking<00:05:20.120> the<00:05:20.389> earth<00:05:20.600> might<00:05:20.750> be<00:05:20.900> round<00:05:21.110> and

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 
thinking the earth might be round and

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:22.870 
thinking the earth might be round and
the<00:05:21.650> obvious<00:05:21.919> question<00:05:21.949> to<00:05:22.280> ask<00:05:22.460> is<00:05:22.669> well<00:05:22.789> if

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880 
the obvious question to ask is well if

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.420 
the obvious question to ask is well if
it's<00:05:23.000> round<00:05:23.150> was<00:05:23.389> his<00:05:23.539> radius<00:05:23.949> and<00:05:24.949> so<00:05:25.250> the

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:25.430 
it's round was his radius and so the

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:26.980 
it's round was his radius and so the
first<00:05:25.639> sort<00:05:25.910> of<00:05:25.940> scientific<00:05:26.599> attempt<00:05:26.870> to

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:26.990 
first sort of scientific attempt to

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:28.600 
first sort of scientific attempt to
measure<00:05:27.139> the<00:05:27.710> radius<00:05:28.009> of<00:05:28.099> the<00:05:28.160> earth<00:05:28.220> was<00:05:28.460> made

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:28.610 
measure the radius of the earth was made

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:31.719 
measure the radius of the earth was made
by<00:05:28.849> a<00:05:28.880> Greek<00:05:29.150> guy<00:05:29.389> Eratosthenes<00:05:30.020> about<00:05:30.590> 200<00:05:31.400> BC

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:31.729 
by a Greek guy Eratosthenes about 200 BC

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:34.659 
by a Greek guy Eratosthenes about 200 BC
and<00:05:32.710> he<00:05:33.710> came<00:05:33.860> up<00:05:33.949> with<00:05:33.979> his<00:05:34.130> very<00:05:34.310> clever<00:05:34.520> he's

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:34.669 
and he came up with his very clever he's

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:36.580 
and he came up with his very clever he's
amazing<00:05:35.030> guy<00:05:35.150> he<00:05:35.360> was<00:05:35.479> an<00:05:35.599> athlete<00:05:36.229> he<00:05:36.470> was

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:36.590 
amazing guy he was an athlete he was

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:37.629 
amazing guy he was an athlete he was
interested<00:05:36.889> in<00:05:36.979> geography<00:05:37.190> he<00:05:37.550> was

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:37.639 
interested in geography he was

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:39.879 
interested in geography he was
interested<00:05:38.000> in<00:05:38.060> astronomy<00:05:38.590> mathematics<00:05:39.590> so

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:39.889 
interested in astronomy mathematics so

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:41.800 
interested in astronomy mathematics so
cause<00:05:40.130> sort<00:05:40.340> of<00:05:40.430> amazing<00:05:41.030> wide<00:05:41.419> range<00:05:41.720> of

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:41.810 
cause sort of amazing wide range of

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:43.240 
cause sort of amazing wide range of
things<00:05:41.990> he<00:05:42.080> did<00:05:42.259> but<00:05:42.680> one<00:05:42.830> of<00:05:42.889> the<00:05:43.009> things<00:05:43.160> he

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:43.250 
things he did but one of the things he

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:44.650 
things he did but one of the things he
did<00:05:43.370> just<00:05:43.550> along<00:05:43.789> the<00:05:43.880> way<00:05:44.000> was<00:05:44.210> measured<00:05:44.539> the

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:44.660 
did just along the way was measured the

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:47.020 
did just along the way was measured the
size<00:05:45.259> of<00:05:45.410> the<00:05:45.470> earth<00:05:45.530> and<00:05:45.830> the<00:05:46.610> way<00:05:46.699> he<00:05:46.849> did<00:05:47.000> it

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:47.030 
size of the earth and the way he did it

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:49.390 
size of the earth and the way he did it
was<00:05:47.120> very<00:05:47.360> clever<00:05:47.949> essentially<00:05:48.949> he<00:05:49.070> looked<00:05:49.250> at

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:49.400 
was very clever essentially he looked at

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.279 
was very clever essentially he looked at
how<00:05:49.580> high<00:05:49.880> the<00:05:49.940> Sun<00:05:50.270> was<00:05:50.479> in<00:05:50.509> the<00:05:50.690> sky<00:05:50.780> where<00:05:51.199> he

00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:51.289 
how high the Sun was in the sky where he

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:53.379 
how high the Sun was in the sky where he
lived<00:05:51.500> and<00:05:51.800> then<00:05:52.550> went<00:05:52.759> a<00:05:52.849> few<00:05:52.970> hundred<00:05:53.240> miles

00:05:53.379 --> 00:05:53.389 
lived and then went a few hundred miles

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:55.540 
lived and then went a few hundred miles
north<00:05:53.570> and<00:05:53.990> measured<00:05:54.740> on<00:05:55.039> the<00:05:55.280> set<00:05:55.400> of<00:05:55.460> the

00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:58.400 
got a friend to do it because you can

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:03.560 
same day and of course as you go around

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:04.749 
same day and of course as you go around
the<00:06:03.889> surface<00:06:04.190> of<00:06:04.280> the<00:06:04.370> earth

00:06:04.749 --> 00:06:04.759 
the surface of the earth

00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:06.010 
the surface of the earth
you<00:06:04.940> know<00:06:05.060> if<00:06:05.120> the<00:06:05.210> sun's<00:06:05.389> overhead<00:06:05.750> in<00:06:05.900> one

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:06.020 
you know if the sun's overhead in one

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:07.390 
you know if the sun's overhead in one
place<00:06:06.229> if<00:06:06.380> you<00:06:06.440> go<00:06:06.470> north<00:06:06.830> the<00:06:07.070> sun's<00:06:07.250> no

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:07.400 
place if you go north the sun's no

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:08.680 
place if you go north the sun's no
longer<00:06:07.639> overhead<00:06:07.970> it's<00:06:08.090> a<00:06:08.150> bit<00:06:08.270> sort<00:06:08.419> of<00:06:08.479> lower

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:08.690 
longer overhead it's a bit sort of lower

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:10.719 
longer overhead it's a bit sort of lower
in<00:06:08.870> the<00:06:08.960> sky<00:06:09.050> and<00:06:09.409> so<00:06:10.220> you<00:06:10.280> can<00:06:10.520> actually

00:06:10.719 --> 00:06:10.729 
in the sky and so you can actually

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:12.790 
in the sky and so you can actually
figure<00:06:10.880> out<00:06:11.090> in<00:06:11.990> going<00:06:12.199> these<00:06:12.289> few<00:06:12.530> hundred

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:12.800 
figure out in going these few hundred

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.439 
figure out in going these few hundred
miles<00:06:12.949> what<00:06:13.340> fraction<00:06:13.880> of<00:06:13.970> the<00:06:14.090> circumference

00:06:14.439 --> 00:06:14.449 
miles what fraction of the circumference

00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:15.610 
miles what fraction of the circumference
of<00:06:14.630> the<00:06:14.750> earth<00:06:14.810> he'd<00:06:15.080> actually<00:06:15.319> gone<00:06:15.470> round

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:15.620 
of the earth he'd actually gone round

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:17.680 
of the earth he'd actually gone round
and<00:06:15.860> since<00:06:16.370> he<00:06:16.430> knew<00:06:16.580> the<00:06:16.729> circumference<00:06:17.389> was

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:17.690 
and since he knew the circumference was

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:19.570 
and since he knew the circumference was
you<00:06:17.810> know<00:06:17.930> two<00:06:18.229> pi<00:06:18.409> times<00:06:18.650> the<00:06:18.800> radius<00:06:18.830> once

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:19.580 
you know two pi times the radius once

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:20.740 
you know two pi times the radius once
he'd<00:06:19.699> figured<00:06:19.940> out<00:06:20.060> what<00:06:20.240> fraction<00:06:20.389> looks

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:20.750 
he'd figured out what fraction looks

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:21.939 
he'd figured out what fraction looks
cumference<00:06:21.259> he'd<00:06:21.409> gone<00:06:21.500> round<00:06:21.680> he<00:06:21.830> could

00:06:21.939 --> 00:06:21.949 
cumference he'd gone round he could

00:06:21.949 --> 00:06:22.990 
cumference he'd gone round he could
figure<00:06:22.070> out<00:06:22.159> what<00:06:22.340> the<00:06:22.460> whole<00:06:22.610> circumference

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:23.000 
figure out what the whole circumference

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.240 
figure out what the whole circumference
was<00:06:23.300> and<00:06:24.169> hence<00:06:24.380> figure<00:06:24.650> out<00:06:24.770> what<00:06:24.919> the<00:06:25.009> radius

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:25.250 
was and hence figure out what the radius

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:26.320 
was and hence figure out what the radius
of<00:06:25.400> the<00:06:25.460> earth<00:06:25.490> was<00:06:25.729> and<00:06:25.849> he<00:06:25.909> actually<00:06:26.150> got<00:06:26.210> an

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:26.330 
of the earth was and he actually got an

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:27.850 
of the earth was and he actually got an
answer<00:06:26.630> that<00:06:26.659> was<00:06:26.840> right<00:06:26.990> within<00:06:27.650> a<00:06:27.710> few

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:27.860 
answer that was right within a few

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:29.649 
answer that was right within a few
percent<00:06:28.039> by<00:06:28.729> making<00:06:29.060> that<00:06:29.180> measurement<00:06:29.449> and

00:06:29.649 --> 00:06:29.659 
percent by making that measurement and

00:06:29.659 --> 00:06:31.719 
percent by making that measurement and
that<00:06:30.380> was<00:06:30.590> the<00:06:30.710> kind<00:06:30.979> of<00:06:31.009> the<00:06:31.130> classic

00:06:31.719 --> 00:06:31.729 
that was the kind of the classic

00:06:31.729 --> 00:06:33.219 
that was the kind of the classic
measurement<00:06:32.300> of<00:06:32.389> the<00:06:32.509> the<00:06:32.750> radius<00:06:33.020> of<00:06:33.139> the

00:06:33.219 --> 00:06:33.229 
measurement of the the radius of the

00:06:33.229 --> 00:06:36.580 
measurement of the the radius of the
earth<00:06:33.289> for<00:06:33.860> centuries<00:06:33.889> afterwards
