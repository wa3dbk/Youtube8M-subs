 because I didn't know this author 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.890
 when you pay for this novel and I have it 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.720
 bought in this edition 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:24.299
 when I read this book I have 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.470
 in love with the madness of the author of 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.600
 novel itself and so I read not 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.820
 may have in this edition why 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.220
 the cover is so cool

 inside there was but little every place is 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.180
 inhabited the recent I have to reread 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.439
 this book is precisely this novel 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.180
 instead all the elements I have there 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.799
 quoted before 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.290
 therefore it unites the element gothic element 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.230
 Victorian a fabulous plot one 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.000
 pressing writing 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:49.440
 studied careful prose that fabulous 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.490
 we are given the careful prose shooting 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:56.070
 this novel commends you this 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.200
 novel combines these Gothic elements with 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.320
 of people the only characters that 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.390
 they are something fabulous that is there is a 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.940
 character as aism and peace of the heart 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.920
 divine love network is hopelessly a 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.500
 mysterious character is a character 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.480
 who writes about black fairy tales that later 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.980
 find the novel tents you can 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.900
 read firsthand and are 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.060
 wonderful flames of very black fairy tales 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.020
 beautiful and very well done that some way 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.820
 they are consistent with what is history 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.380
 you will not fail to love this is the 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.270
 most beautiful is that the authors of 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.280
 novel sows of mysteries that are 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.840
 entered into a family of 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.459
 three generations have made us jumps 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.350
 storms that manage them divinely 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.730
 make the start when I started to react 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.220
 from the public of which it is already spoken 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:43.290
 as prose it reminded me of many rais 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:45.300
 in the peace he died even though she has one 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:49.500
 bouton literature technique many neighbors 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:51.000
 to the Victorian one when you reading 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.530
 this novel or the priest always 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.150
 feeling of having understood where the author 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.620
 wants to give devices that have understood what 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.570
 are the mysteries to be solved and every time 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.660
 you will realize what you have 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:03.000
 understood it is only the gigantic bets 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:06.510
 iceberg and will be able to surprise me 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.040
 leave them open-mouthed every time yes 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.330
 anchor I was able to convince you 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.610
 in being this the possibility remains 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.890
 home seriously the failed attempt 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.690
 this book is absolutely fabulous e 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.180
 of the most beautiful living numbers I have ever had 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.530
 read both as plot and as prose is 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.810
 as a narrative technique there is a right 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.580
 what I look for in one more book a 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.180
 narrative technique and a style that 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:29.100
 precisely it recalls Gothic literature 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.540
 hello guys you have to read it is something 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.450
 of extraordinary 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.730
 I say I read also returns ripert 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.709
 human I had even made a video is a 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.510
 book the air is a book prior to 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:41.100
 this is seen asking to keep active 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.870
 a moment more raw than those 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.760
 of the bleak secrets or rather know one 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.140
 literature approaching that 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.940
 on the literature that is cooked that 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.860
 Victorian, however, lacks the Gothic element 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.200
 that characterizes sit secrets 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.720
 which makes it perfect but I 'm obviously 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:57.330
 you both liked them very much however keep 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.550
