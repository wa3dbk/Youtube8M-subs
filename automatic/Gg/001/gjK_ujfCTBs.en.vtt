00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
because you see they can never borrow

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.380 
because you see they can never borrow
enough<00:01:49.350> from<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.009> private<00:01:50.369> sector<00:01:50.820> there's

all

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
all

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.890 
all
as<00:02:14.099> you<00:02:14.220> can<00:02:14.340> see<00:02:14.549> but<00:02:14.760> they<00:02:14.879> they<00:02:15.269> use<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:15.750> old

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
as you can see but they they use the old

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.990 
as you can see but they they use the old
traditional<00:02:16.439> words<00:02:16.680> of<00:02:17.159> lending<00:02:17.640> it<00:02:17.790> to<00:02:17.909> the

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
traditional words of lending it to the

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.580 
traditional words of lending it to the
government<00:02:18.269> when<00:02:18.780> in<00:02:18.900> fact<00:02:19.079> all<00:02:19.409> they're

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
government when in fact all they're

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.949 
government when in fact all they're
doing<00:02:19.890> is<00:02:20.069> just<00:02:20.280> printing<00:02:21.209> it<00:02:21.390> for<00:02:21.840> the

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
doing is just printing it for the

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:23.720 
doing is just printing it for the
government<00:02:22.079> they're<00:02:22.530> creating<00:02:23.010> it<00:02:23.189> for<00:02:23.640> the

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
government they're creating it for the

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.850 
government they're creating it for the
government<00:02:24.150> and<00:02:24.269> then<00:02:24.780> they<00:02:24.930> call<00:02:25.230> it<00:02:25.379> a<00:02:25.530> loan

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
government and then they call it a loan

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.830 
government and then they call it a loan
of<00:02:26.250> course<00:02:27.060> they<00:02:27.180> don't<00:02:27.299> print<00:02:27.599> it<00:02:27.659> all

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
of course they don't print it all

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.960 
of course they don't print it all
because<00:02:28.200> most<00:02:28.409> of<00:02:28.530> its<00:02:28.680> checkbook<00:02:29.129> money<00:02:29.280> but

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
because most of its checkbook money but

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.789 
because most of its checkbook money but
nevertheless<00:02:30.209> the<00:02:30.569> process<00:02:30.989> is<00:02:31.140> the<00:02:31.319> same<00:02:31.560> as

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:31.799 
nevertheless the process is the same as

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:33.589 
nevertheless the process is the same as
if<00:02:32.190> they<00:02:32.310> had<00:02:32.519> just<00:02:32.790> turned<00:02:32.970> on<00:02:33.180> the<00:02:33.329> printing

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 
if they had just turned on the printing

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:35.710 
if they had just turned on the printing
presses<00:02:33.810> and<00:02:34.140> printed<00:02:34.829> all<00:02:34.950> this<00:02:35.129> money<00:02:35.400> and

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
presses and printed all this money and

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.569 
presses and printed all this money and
gave<00:02:36.720> it<00:02:36.900> to<00:02:36.930> the<00:02:37.200> federal<00:02:37.560> government<00:02:37.920> so<00:02:38.430> now

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:38.579 
gave it to the federal government so now

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:41.030 
gave it to the federal government so now
once<00:02:39.120> the<00:02:39.329> federal<00:02:39.540> reserve<00:02:39.930> system<00:02:40.040> creates

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
once the federal reserve system creates

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.020 
once the federal reserve system creates
this<00:02:41.370> money<00:02:41.700> out<00:02:41.970> of<00:02:42.500> nothing<00:02:43.500> literally<00:02:44.310> it's

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
this money out of nothing literally it's

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.750 
this money out of nothing literally it's
fresh<00:02:45.420> money<00:02:45.659> into<00:02:46.349> the<00:02:46.440> society<00:02:47.010> into<00:02:47.640> the

fresh money into the society into the
economy<00:02:48.030> and<00:02:48.329> that's<00:02:48.810> how<00:02:49.019> the<00:02:49.620> money<00:02:49.769> supply

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
economy and that's how the money supply

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.000 
economy and that's how the money supply
keeps<00:02:50.489> growing<00:02:50.940> and<00:02:51.120> growing<00:02:51.180> and<00:02:51.659> growing

now<00:03:15.540> that's<00:03:15.659> fine<00:03:16.019> so<00:03:16.709> far<00:03:17.010> because<00:03:17.819> I<00:03:18.000> know

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
now that's fine so far because I know

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.059 
now that's fine so far because I know
that<00:03:18.540> gold<00:03:18.840> is<00:03:19.049> in<00:03:19.169> there<00:03:19.379> it's<00:03:19.620> being<00:03:19.799> loaned

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
that gold is in there it's being loaned

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:22.250 
that gold is in there it's being loaned
out<00:03:20.280> and<00:03:20.549> someday<00:03:21.480> down<00:03:21.810> I'm<00:03:21.989> getting<00:03:22.169> through

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
out and someday down I'm getting through

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:23.509 
out and someday down I'm getting through
percent<00:03:22.530> interest<00:03:22.829> and<00:03:22.889> someday<00:03:23.190> I<00:03:23.220> can<00:03:23.400> ask

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
percent interest and someday I can ask

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:24.800 
percent interest and someday I can ask
for<00:03:23.579> that<00:03:23.730> principle<00:03:23.940> back<00:03:24.269> it<00:03:24.419> might<00:03:24.480> be<00:03:24.629> six

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
for that principle back it might be six

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.089 
for that principle back it might be six
months<00:03:25.079> it<00:03:25.169> might<00:03:25.290> be<00:03:25.379> a<00:03:25.410> year<00:03:25.680> or<00:03:25.709> whatever<00:03:25.980> it

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:26.099 
months it might be a year or whatever it

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:28.849 
months it might be a year or whatever it
is<00:03:26.810> where<00:03:27.810> the<00:03:27.930> trick<00:03:28.139> comes<00:03:28.169> into<00:03:28.560> this<00:03:28.680> is

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:28.859 
is where the trick comes into this is

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:30.470 
is where the trick comes into this is
the<00:03:28.889> bank<00:03:29.160> says<00:03:29.430> not<00:03:29.819> only<00:03:29.849> are<00:03:30.090> we<00:03:30.180> going<00:03:30.389> to

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
the bank says not only are we going to

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.420 
the bank says not only are we going to
lend<00:03:30.660> that<00:03:30.690> money<00:03:30.810> out<00:03:31.129> but<00:03:32.129> we're<00:03:32.280> going<00:03:32.370> to

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
that they can't possibly be saying that

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.349 
that they can't possibly be saying that
I<00:03:41.099> can<00:03:41.310> draw<00:03:41.519> one<00:03:41.549> hundred<00:03:41.970> percent<00:03:42.060> of<00:03:42.269> that

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:42.359 
I can draw one hundred percent of that

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:44.599 
I can draw one hundred percent of that
deposit<00:03:42.690> when<00:03:43.199> they've<00:03:43.319> also<00:03:43.500> loaned<00:03:43.919> out<00:03:44.160> 100

percent<00:03:44.639> of<00:03:44.940> that<00:03:44.970> deposit<00:03:45.540> now<00:03:45.599> maybe<00:03:45.810> they

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
percent of that deposit now maybe they

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.000 
percent of that deposit now maybe they
don't<00:03:45.989> loan<00:03:46.199> out<00:03:46.349> others<00:03:46.590> have<00:03:46.680> any<00:03:46.799> their<00:03:46.919> on

the loan out 90% or even um whatever it
is<00:03:48.840> and<00:03:49.199> that's<00:03:49.500> the<00:03:49.680> fractional<00:03:50.280> reserve

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
is and that's the fractional reserve

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.140 
is and that's the fractional reserve
concept<00:03:51.480> they<00:03:52.169> don't<00:03:52.590> have<00:03:52.949> enough<00:03:53.340> reserves

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
concept they don't have enough reserves

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.170 
concept they don't have enough reserves
to<00:03:55.019> pay<00:03:55.290> out<00:03:55.470> all<00:03:55.859> of<00:03:55.889> these<00:03:56.220> obligations<00:03:56.489> that

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
to pay out all of these obligations that

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:58.909 
to pay out all of these obligations that
they've<00:03:57.359> made<00:03:57.540> especially<00:03:57.780> with<00:03:58.440> respect<00:03:58.590> to

00:03:58.909 --> 00:03:58.919 
they've made especially with respect to

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:00.680 
they've made especially with respect to
paper<00:03:59.459> currency<00:04:00.120> because<00:04:00.329> usually<00:04:00.449> that's

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
paper currency because usually that's

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.659 
paper currency because usually that's
the<00:04:00.780> way<00:04:00.870> it<00:04:00.989> worked<00:04:01.199> now<00:04:02.010> why<00:04:02.370> do<00:04:02.430> they<00:04:02.609> do

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:02.669 
the way it worked now why do they do

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:04.280 
the way it worked now why do they do
this<00:04:02.940> well<00:04:03.150> they<00:04:03.329> do<00:04:03.389> this<00:04:03.659> because<00:04:03.840> they<00:04:04.019> make

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
this well they do this because they make

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.619 
this well they do this because they make
money<00:04:04.549> right<00:04:05.549> if<00:04:05.730> I<00:04:05.819> can<00:04:05.879> loan<00:04:06.329> out

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:06.629 
money right if I can loan out

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:08.539 
money right if I can loan out
essentially<00:04:07.409> more<00:04:07.680> than<00:04:07.859> I<00:04:07.980> have<00:04:08.250> in<00:04:08.430> my

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:08.549 
essentially more than I have in my

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:10.550 
essentially more than I have in my
reserves<00:04:09.000> by<00:04:09.810> that<00:04:10.019> difference<00:04:10.440> I'm

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
reserves by that difference I'm

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.580 
reserves by that difference I'm
increasing<00:04:11.129> interest<00:04:11.940> payments<00:04:12.440> so<00:04:13.440> the

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
increasing interest payments so the

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.099 
increasing interest payments so the
bankers<00:04:14.099> are<00:04:14.489> beneficiaries<00:04:15.000> of<00:04:15.510> this<00:04:15.690> and

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
bankers are beneficiaries of this and

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:18.949 
bankers are beneficiaries of this and
obviously<00:04:16.739> the<00:04:17.310> early<00:04:17.669> the<00:04:18.180> first<00:04:18.359> lender<00:04:18.840> the

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
obviously the early the first lender the

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.300 
obviously the early the first lender the
person<00:04:19.169> that<00:04:19.289> receives<00:04:19.620> that<00:04:19.889> money<00:04:20.099> is<00:04:20.280> a

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
person that receives that money is a

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:21.560 
person that receives that money is a
beneficiary<00:04:20.909> because<00:04:20.970> he's<00:04:21.150> getting<00:04:21.419> money

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
beneficiary because he's getting money

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:22.069 
beneficiary because he's getting money
they<00:04:21.720> wouldn't

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:22.079 
they wouldn't

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:23.179 
they wouldn't
otherwise<00:04:22.349> even<00:04:22.770> though<00:04:22.830> he<00:04:22.919> has<00:04:23.039> to<00:04:23.129> pay

00:04:23.179 --> 00:04:23.189 
otherwise even though he has to pay

otherwise even though he has to pay
increase<00:04:23.460> on<00:04:23.610> it<00:04:23.699> but<00:04:24.659> then<00:04:24.780> what<00:04:24.930> happens

00:04:25.249 --> 00:04:25.259 
increase on it but then what happens

increase on it but then what happens
down<00:04:25.409> the<00:04:25.620> line<00:04:25.800> this<00:04:26.430> is<00:04:26.580> the<00:04:26.639> fascinating

00:04:26.809 --> 00:04:26.819 
down the line this is the fascinating

wages on the basis of what it believes

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:35.809 
wages on the basis of what it believes
is<00:04:34.379> the<00:04:34.500> total<00:04:34.770> amount<00:04:35.009> of<00:04:35.069> money<00:04:35.189> that's<00:04:35.490> in

they start generating new money that the
