 the easiest 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.440
 basketball red jordan

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:21.330
 or rather 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.010

 it weighs 400 1 grams 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.110
 if we take the standard tenth 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.000
 which we usually consider it to be 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 accordingly more 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.860
 with his ship spokes h 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.210
 at least two models 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.270
 which is even lighter than the ninth bedroom 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:48.200
 size 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.720
 this is jordan afraid of tr 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.850
 about which we recently 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.860
 told 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:55.890
 they weigh 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.890
 397 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.360
 and jordan 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.940
 alpha 1 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.740
 modernized version of the classics 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.469
 394 grams 

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:12.469
 these are not the easiest sneakers sold 

00:02:13.499 --> 00:02:17.259
 Now and you bitch as they could already see 

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:20.259
 this material is solid cast 

00:02:21.169 --> 00:02:23.799
 no background position but 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:26.709
 looks like something 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:28.449
 together 

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:31.449
 it merges with the body 

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:34.379
 synthetic material 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:36.429
 pretty tough than it reminds fi usb but 

00:02:36.429 --> 00:02:38.169
 he has more provisions 

00:02:38.169 --> 00:02:40.060
 that is, you can feel it under your arm 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.629
 on the back side 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:44.449
 the upper material is leather 

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:46.369
 and for this year 

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:48.839
 for comparison we need 

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:50.289
 white 

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:52.329
 on whites 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:54.669
 laptop black 

00:02:54.669 --> 00:02:57.089
 and the trend itself 

00:02:57.089 --> 00:02:58.859
 then we will call them 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:01.479
 synthetic leather 

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:04.099
 she, too, a little different texture 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:07.099
 that is, they are not my small differences 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:10.489
 put in place 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:12.279
 come back here 

00:03:12.279 --> 00:03:13.979
 as you can see sneakers 

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:15.769
 asymmetric 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:18.769
 it resembles magazine 20 10 

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:20.889
 to your liking 

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:22.470
 they resemble jordan 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.299
 21 stocks 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:27.299
 the pattern looks like a transparent 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:30.429
 see here 

00:03:30.429 --> 00:03:31.309
 plastic 

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:32.549
 that is, it 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:35.449
 Usually there may be some plastic 

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:36.749
 modified 

00:03:36.749 --> 00:03:38.859
 but it does not render 

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:41.639
 heel cushion 

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:43.729
 ermak with visible 

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:45.489
 a bit unusual 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:47.319
 representation of him 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:50.319
 front end there is a zoom 

00:03:53.929 --> 00:03:56.929
 about dressing very comfortable loop 

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:59.209
 in one language 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:02.429
 big room 

00:04:02.429 --> 00:04:04.239
 exhale 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:05.759
 treshka target 

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:08.209
 inside sneakers 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:09.799
 fully composed 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:11.249
 rolling sock 

00:04:11.249 --> 00:04:12.719
 it consists of a grid 

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:15.159
 merges with the body inside so it appeared 

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:16.829
 no word 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:18.409
 no feeling 

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:20.219
 superfluous 

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:23.219
 on your heels here you see looking countries 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.439

00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:27.979
 it flows smoothly 

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:29.539
 throughout the body 

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:31.300
 and like headphones 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.680
 envelop 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.770
 our heel is the goal of strength 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:40.099
 it makes them 

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:43.099
 very comfortable in area 5 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:47.629
