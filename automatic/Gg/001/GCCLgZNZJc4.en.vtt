00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
last year I'm a senior so I was hoping

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.789 
last year I'm a senior so I was hoping
that<00:01:23.060> day<00:01:23.330> we<00:01:23.509> have<00:01:23.689> like<00:01:23.899> a<00:01:24.140> big<00:01:24.500> name<00:01:24.680> that

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 
that day we have like a big name that

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:26.859 
that day we have like a big name that
maybe<00:01:24.950> everybody<00:01:25.460> knew<00:01:25.700> and<00:01:26.000> that<00:01:26.600> didn't

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 
maybe everybody knew and that didn't

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:29.889 
maybe everybody knew and that didn't
really<00:01:26.899> happen<00:01:27.170> I<00:01:27.890> feel<00:01:27.950> like<00:01:28.750> it's<00:01:29.750> really

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:29.899 
really happen I feel like it's really

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:31.960 
really happen I feel like it's really
difficult<00:01:30.140> to<00:01:30.470> way<00:01:30.710> everybody's<00:01:31.399> preferences

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
difficult to way everybody's preferences

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.170 
difficult to way everybody's preferences
but<00:01:32.330> I<00:01:32.600> thought<00:01:33.439> the<00:01:33.740> MGMT<00:01:34.280> was<00:01:34.460> a<00:01:34.490> good<00:01:35.000> choice

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
but I thought the MGMT was a good choice

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:36.969 
but I thought the MGMT was a good choice
I<00:01:35.689> feel<00:01:36.080> like<00:01:36.200> there<00:01:36.409> would<00:01:36.530> have<00:01:36.619> been<00:01:36.680> people

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
I feel like there would have been people

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:39.070 
I feel like there would have been people
who<00:01:37.399> wouldn't<00:01:37.939> have<00:01:38.060> been<00:01:38.240> happy<00:01:38.450> even<00:01:38.899> if<00:01:38.990> we

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
who wouldn't have been happy even if we

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.999 
who wouldn't have been happy even if we
