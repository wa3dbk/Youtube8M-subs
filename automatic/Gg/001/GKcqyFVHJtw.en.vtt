00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 in the first part of the video you saw that 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.589
 I suffered and had a bad time during the selective 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.929
 of corinthians steamrollers on Monday 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.000
 part to prevent you from seeing the 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.009
 first part then clicks the button that 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.710
 is appearing on your screen or goes there 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.820
 our fan page on facebook and watch 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.250
 you've watched 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.720
 You now know if I went 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.720
 approved or not 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:34.840
 and it's not easy at all 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.010
 today I'm going to go wrong now I need Brazil 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.440
 everything normal 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:42.730
 the mpb channel can do some 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:45.239
 discussions in line to improve 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.239
 ae 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:59.650
 in my third attempt to launch the 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:02.310
 ball the technical defensive kiko small 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:06.070
 decided to show me what a situation is 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:12.060
 game was not very enjoyable for 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:12.060
 the project that marvel is happy 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:19.560
 look at my part zezÃ© dispatch of the url 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.410
 so you have an idea who the gui is. 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.810
 in the game against the North quarterback 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:29.180
 American who has already played in the nfl 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.180
 he simply did this 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.510
 My luck was that he was from 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.780
 sneakers and slipped on the lawn 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:47.910
 if it were not for this you would probably go 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.910
 see this scene again 21 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:56.670
 past the fear time to change some balls 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.899
 and try to receive passes 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:28.860
 and more strength for nothing is the end of me 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.750
 selective 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.740
 It's really not easy for us to go. 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:36.840
 wait for everyone to stop and ask 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:39.230
 if I could or would not get through 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.700
 Selective Corinthians await 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.100
 finished the selective and now the moment 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.320
 that I want to know 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:48.300
 I spent I do not do the johnny shih play and 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.400
 paulinho who are part of the team are the 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.200
 team players and also played a part 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.950
 the committee that evaluated these four 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.750
 Selective days for us is not is not nothing 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.430
 easy, I had a hard time 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.530
 It's too bad I was not prepared 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.020
 physically and in much of the 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.480
 people who came also were not 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:10.560
 so prepared or thought it was more 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:12.300
 easier and is not based on what 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.330
 You saw what I got to do. 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:17.460
 because unfortunately I did not do everything 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.170
 to do something time 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.610
 I believe that yes it has to work one 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.110
 little more the physical part because the 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.600
 american football demands this 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:27.270
 today you can not have the physical part 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.770
 I do not know because there is a current but it is 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.460
 important to get you to do the 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:31.800
 test 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:33.750
 so it 's a necessity but something that 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.340
 will work after he has been taught 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.560
 No way to charge you or any 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.920
 another athlete who is not a sport that 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:44.310
 already dug brian huntley of his 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:46.110
 basis of willpower 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:49.140
 in american football here in brazil 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.490
 because it's an amateur sport that counts a lot 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.260
 you were there were the fallen 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:54.720
 institutions that have long been 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.240
 This is cool, I had a face I passed. 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.520
 bad and was the duel was very 10 ended 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.650
 with this willpower and want to be 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.540
 Do you want to do a lot for me? 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.840
 to have this good 2 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:08.190
 Only one pass is left, let's see your 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.170
 party with no 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:12.120
 You know that I really like you more. 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.190
 You tea the whole story just to not 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:17.010
 stay as nani has to give a 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:19.760
 worked on the physical and come back this was the 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.620
 great detail anyway I think 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.990
 in the period to warm up to work 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:26.300
 Do not worry about the 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.430
 practice to be worth a positive point is that 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.620
 you launched new class was a little was 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:33.230
 good consistency so you can 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:35.990
 play too wait there I wait on 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:39.140
 selective approach to the garden so we 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:41.180
 depends on the j3 approvals 11 approved no 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:42.620
 give to pass but for you who 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.780
 were at home who watched that 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:47.510
 could see a little of what it is to face 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:49.790
 football in Brazil today and in a 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:51.650
 of the best clubs in Brazil I to 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:53.570
 to realize is not easy 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.790
 three have any message to pass to 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:58.240
 kids to get older people 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:00.890
 what happened and will going to be part of the team 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.660
 American football we do not decide 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:03.350
 What are you going to play, will you play football? 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.550
 American 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:07.100
 from the moment that I will 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:10.460
 to start living football that 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:12.290
 the rope starts talking, I'll eat 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.720
 right will have a longer life. 

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:16.130
 orderly lives always seeking your profile 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:18.470
 his field performance 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:20.570
 Do you eat better, rest? 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:22.880
 You better know what it takes to understand 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:24.639
 what to play has to know what each in the 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.120
 your position 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:28.590
 ab you have to understand the game 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:32.460
 the environment is a great aspect of 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:35.790
 football that I won from my 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:37.919
 paulinho pm he can tell me it's study 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:38.910
 The American is studying today. I think 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:42.300
 was always 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:44.820
 the difference is that out there but jury takes 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.919
 Seriously here already no longer going on 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:48.780
 crisis in our Brazilian noise, right? 

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:50.400
 kind of let's see what happens does not have 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:52.380
 that quote has to be well that it has to 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:55.650
 rule has to see you how to behave in 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:06:00.600
 Camp went from there, man, there you go. 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:02.070
 play will be the same thing they 

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:04.289
 they really did have to live the 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:06.060
 American football is a sport that demands 

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:08.100
 both physical and mental 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:10.020
 the knowledge to understand everything 

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:13.169
 It happens for the sport extremely 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:14.819
 collective as a player Sleep 

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:16.680
 just a galley that thinks it's 

00:06:14.819 --> 00:06:20.039
 Joking, you can not play this. 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:21.539
 hence the body actually requires that you 

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:24.210
 be trained that you are prepared 

00:06:21.539 --> 00:06:26.310
 only requires that you also be trained 

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:30.169
 by those who knew the sport to the public 

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:36.360
 So I feel happy about your willingness to 

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:38.580
 leaving were 14 days and more than 500 

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:41.279
 subscribed and now Corinthians opens a 

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:43.050
 new stage comes to a new challenge and 

00:06:41.279 --> 00:06:44.490
 tries to be a better team I will 

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:46.139
 to train a little more and who knows 

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:48.620
 The next time I can be approved 

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:48.620
 thanks
