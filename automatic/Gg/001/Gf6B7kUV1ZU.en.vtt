on Devin Aromashodu I'm a big fan of his
you<00:04:44.919> know<00:04:45.009> I<00:04:45.039> liked<00:04:45.340> him<00:04:45.580> coming<00:04:45.969> into<00:04:46.210> last

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:46.419 
you know I liked him coming into last

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:48.209 
you know I liked him coming into last
year<00:04:46.659> as<00:04:46.719> a<00:04:46.750> sleeper<00:04:47.229> obviously<00:04:47.740> that<00:04:47.919> didn't

00:04:48.209 --> 00:04:48.219 
year as a sleeper obviously that didn't

00:04:48.219 --> 00:04:49.950 
year as a sleeper obviously that didn't
work<00:04:48.250> out<00:04:48.580> but<00:04:49.000> out<00:04:49.150> there<00:04:49.270> Minnesota<00:04:49.810> they

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 
work out but out there Minnesota they

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.270 
work out but out there Minnesota they
got<00:04:50.110> Percy<00:04:50.530> Harvin<00:04:50.860> but<00:04:50.979> they<00:04:51.039> don't<00:04:51.189> really

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
got Percy Harvin but they don't really

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.159 
got Percy Harvin but they don't really
have<00:04:51.580> a<00:04:51.610> lot<00:04:51.879> else<00:04:52.120> in<00:04:52.300> the<00:04:52.389> receipt<00:04:52.750> and<00:04:52.870> as

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:53.169 
have a lot else in the receipt and as

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:55.830 
have a lot else in the receipt and as
far<00:04:53.500> as<00:04:53.620> the<00:04:53.740> receivers<00:04:54.250> go<00:04:54.460> he's<00:04:55.150> very<00:04:55.569> much<00:04:55.810> a

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
far as the receivers go he's very much a

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.779 
far as the receivers go he's very much a
guy<00:04:56.110> to<00:04:56.169> keep<00:04:56.439> an<00:04:56.560> eye<00:04:56.710> on<00:04:56.740> a<00:04:56.949> guy<00:04:57.279> to<00:04:57.340> add<00:04:57.580> in

00:04:57.779 --> 00:04:57.789 
guy to keep an eye on a guy to add in

00:04:57.789 --> 00:04:59.820 
guy to keep an eye on a guy to add in
really<00:04:58.150> deep<00:04:58.300> leagues<00:04:58.599> but<00:04:59.080> I<00:04:59.139> think<00:04:59.439> he<00:04:59.620> will

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
really deep leagues but I think he will

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:02.459 
really deep leagues but I think he will
emerge<00:05:00.219> as<00:05:00.520> a<00:05:01.270> nice<00:05:01.509> complement<00:05:02.110> to<00:05:02.139> Percy

00:05:02.459 --> 00:05:02.469 
emerge as a nice complement to Percy

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:04.320 
emerge as a nice complement to Percy
Harvin<00:05:02.800> and<00:05:02.919> maybe<00:05:03.279> even<00:05:03.580> the<00:05:03.879> best<00:05:04.090> wide

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330 
Harvin and maybe even the best wide

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.240 
Harvin and maybe even the best wide
receiver<00:05:04.360> out<00:05:04.930> there<00:05:05.139> for<00:05:05.319> the<00:05:05.409> Vikings<00:05:05.830> might

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250 
receiver out there for the Vikings might

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:08.010 
receiver out there for the Vikings might
be<00:05:06.400> a<00:05:06.430> better<00:05:06.550> stretch<00:05:06.879> but<00:05:07.360> I<00:05:07.479> like<00:05:07.719> a<00:05:07.750> Roma

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 
be a better stretch but I like a Roma

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:09.510 
be a better stretch but I like a Roma
should<00:05:08.229> do<00:05:08.319> at<00:05:08.469> the<00:05:08.560> very<00:05:08.800> least<00:05:08.979> keep<00:05:09.250> a<00:05:09.340> very

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 
should do at the very least keep a very

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.969 
should do at the very least keep a very
close<00:05:09.819> eye<00:05:10.060> on<00:05:10.120> like<00:05:10.990> I<00:05:11.169> always<00:05:11.199> say<00:05:11.680> this<00:05:11.830> is

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:11.979 
close eye on like I always say this is

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:13.709
