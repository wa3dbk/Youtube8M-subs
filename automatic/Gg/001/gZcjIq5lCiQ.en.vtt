explain all this in another tutorial I'm
going<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.140> turn<00:01:22.200> it<00:01:22.350> on<00:01:22.470> now<00:01:23.070> this<00:01:23.250> could<00:01:23.490> slow

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
going to turn it on now this could slow

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.609 
going to turn it on now this could slow
down<00:01:24.030> your<00:01:24.630> compression<00:01:25.110> but<00:01:25.229> it<00:01:25.350> will<00:01:25.470> make

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
down your compression but it will make

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.170 
down your compression but it will make
your<00:01:25.799> quality<00:01:26.280> a<00:01:26.369> lot<00:01:26.909> lot<00:01:27.750> better<00:01:29.060> so<00:01:30.060> I'm

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
your quality a lot lot better so I'm

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.160 
your quality a lot lot better so I'm
going<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.390> go<00:01:30.479> through<00:01:30.630> here<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:30.900> turn<00:01:31.020> my

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
going to go through here and turn my

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:37.660 
going to go through here and turn my
frame<00:01:31.380> controls<00:01:31.770> on<00:01:32.540> each<00:01:33.540> one<00:01:33.750> of<00:01:33.780> my<00:01:33.869> codex

we're going to submit this batch and
start<00:01:46.310> encoding<00:01:48.020> it<00:01:49.020> will<00:01:49.170> probably<00:01:49.380> start

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
start encoding it will probably start

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.069 
start encoding it will probably start
with<00:01:49.799> Apple<00:01:50.070> ProRes<00:01:50.250> first<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:51.119> go<00:01:51.240> down<00:01:51.420> so

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
with Apple ProRes first and go down so

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.910 
with Apple ProRes first and go down so
I'm<00:01:52.170> going<00:01:52.290> to<00:01:52.320> click<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.619> submit<00:01:52.829> button<00:01:53.509> now

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
14 gigs around you got to remember ram

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.960 
14 gigs around you got to remember ram
makes<00:02:59.140> a<00:02:59.380> big<00:02:59.590> deal<00:02:59.770> and<00:02:59.980> I<00:03:00.040> have<00:03:00.160> a<00:03:00.190> 10,000<00:03:00.670> RPM

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
makes a big deal and I have a 10,000 RPM

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.450 
makes a big deal and I have a 10,000 RPM
hard<00:03:01.150> drive<00:03:01.270> too<00:03:01.660> so<00:03:02.410> it<00:03:03.070> makes<00:03:03.250> a<00:03:03.370> big

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:03.460 
hard drive too so it makes a big

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:05.310 
hard drive too so it makes a big
difference<00:03:03.520> so<00:03:03.880> anyways<00:03:04.300> there<00:03:04.900> you<00:03:05.080> go<00:03:05.260> you

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
difference so anyways there you go you

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:06.990 
difference so anyways there you go you
seem<00:03:05.680> that<00:03:05.830> was<00:03:06.010> using<00:03:06.280> the<00:03:06.370> virtual<00:03:06.520> cluster

seem that was using the virtual cluster

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.170 
seem that was using the virtual cluster
how<00:03:07.090> all<00:03:07.300> four<00:03:07.600> cores<00:03:07.870> were<00:03:08.050> lit<00:03:08.380> up<00:03:09.000> so<00:03:10.000> now

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
how all four cores were lit up so now

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.810 
how all four cores were lit up so now
let<00:03:10.570> me<00:03:10.600> close<00:03:10.810> my<00:03:10.870> batch<00:03:11.140> monitor<00:03:11.820> let's

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
let me close my batch monitor let's

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:17.190 
let me close my batch monitor let's
submit<00:03:13.030> the<00:03:13.330> same<00:03:13.570> batch<00:03:13.810> and<00:03:16.200> uncheck

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
submit the same batch and uncheck

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.470 
submit the same batch and uncheck
include<00:03:17.890> unmanaged<00:03:18.459> services<00:03:18.940> and<00:03:19.150> this<00:03:19.300> will

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
include unmanaged services and this will

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.340 
include unmanaged services and this will
not<00:03:19.810> fire<00:03:20.110> up<00:03:20.320> our<00:03:20.440> virtual<00:03:20.830> cluster<00:03:22.350> but

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
not fire up our virtual cluster but

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.320 
not fire up our virtual cluster but
before<00:03:23.500> I<00:03:23.709> can<00:03:23.830> do<00:03:24.100> that<00:03:24.130> I<00:03:24.550> have<00:03:24.910> to<00:03:25.060> change

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.330 
before I can do that I have to change

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.390 
before I can do that I have to change
the<00:03:25.540> name<00:03:25.570> of<00:03:25.810> my<00:03:26.080> media<00:03:26.560> as<00:03:26.800> you<00:03:26.950> see<00:03:27.100> as<00:03:27.280> you

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
the name of my media as you see as you

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.070 
the name of my media as you see as you
can<00:03:27.550> see<00:03:27.700> right<00:03:27.730> here<00:03:28.060> it's<00:03:28.209> red<00:03:28.480> which<00:03:28.840> means

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080

not going nearly as fast all the

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.120 
not going nearly as fast all the
instances<00:04:23.530> are<00:04:23.800> still<00:04:24.010> there

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
instances are still there

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.780 
instances are still there
but<00:04:26.000> the<00:04:26.150> cores<00:04:26.450> are<00:04:26.840> just<00:04:27.020> barely<00:04:27.260> lit<00:04:27.740> I<00:04:28.040> mean

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:28.790 
but the cores are just barely lit I mean

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:31.210 
but the cores are just barely lit I mean
that's<00:04:28.970> just<00:04:29.440> the<00:04:30.440> last<00:04:30.680> time<00:04:30.920> with<00:04:31.100> the

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
that's just the last time with the

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:32.830 
that's just the last time with the
virtual<00:04:31.520> cluster<00:04:31.820> they<00:04:32.000> was<00:04:32.150> really<00:04:32.480> lit<00:04:32.660> up

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
virtual cluster they was really lit up

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.440 
virtual cluster they was really lit up
so<00:04:33.620> this<00:04:34.250> is<00:04:34.430> how<00:04:34.610> you<00:04:34.640> set<00:04:35.030> up<00:04:35.060> a<00:04:35.270> virtual

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.450 
so this is how you set up a virtual

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:38.680 
so this is how you set up a virtual
cluster<00:04:36.080> in<00:04:36.760> compressor<00:04:37.760> with<00:04:38.030> your<00:04:38.240> mac<00:04:38.420> pro

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
cluster in compressor with your mac pro

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.480 
cluster in compressor with your mac pro

a<00:05:06.020> screeching<00:05:06.500> halt<00:05:07.180> so<00:05:08.180> this<00:05:09.080> is<00:05:09.110> how<00:05:09.350> you<00:05:09.380> set

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 
a screeching halt so this is how you set

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.790 
a screeching halt so this is how you set
up<00:05:09.770> a<00:05:09.860> quick<00:05:10.040> cluster<00:05:10.460> and<00:05:10.640> you<00:05:10.850> can

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800 
up a quick cluster and you can

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.640 
up a quick cluster and you can
definitely<00:05:12.800> see<00:05:13.070> a<00:05:13.250> major<00:05:13.640> difference<00:05:13.880> in<00:05:14.660> the

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:15.650 
definitely see a major difference in the

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:17.650 
definitely see a major difference in the

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:17.660 
speed of encoding as you can see I was
