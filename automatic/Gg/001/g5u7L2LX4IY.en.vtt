00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
hey guys so today what I decided to do

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.599 
hey guys so today what I decided to do
is<00:00:03.240> got<00:00:04.200> one<00:00:04.290> of<00:00:04.380> these<00:00:04.500> old<00:00:05.100> Mega<00:00:05.339> Drive

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
is got one of these old Mega Drive

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:08.419 
is got one of these old Mega Drive
systems<00:00:06.120> and<00:00:06.680> I've<00:00:07.680> spent<00:00:07.919> some<00:00:08.099> time<00:00:08.250> with

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
systems and I've spent some time with

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.250 
systems and I've spent some time with
this<00:00:08.519> and<00:00:08.760> I've<00:00:08.820> already<00:00:09.000> modded<00:00:09.900> it<00:00:10.019> with<00:00:10.139> the

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
this and I've already modded it with the

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.860 
this and I've already modded it with the
switches<00:00:10.679> on<00:00:11.130> the<00:00:11.190> side<00:00:11.670> of<00:00:11.730> 50<00:00:12.090> 60<00:00:12.389> Hertz<00:00:12.599> and

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
switches on the side of 50 60 Hertz and

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.670 
switches on the side of 50 60 Hertz and
the<00:00:13.309> Japan<00:00:14.309> English<00:00:14.790> one<00:00:15.230> and<00:00:16.230> I'm<00:00:16.350> just<00:00:16.379> going

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
the Japan English one and I'm just going

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.240 
the Japan English one and I'm just going
to<00:00:16.770> show<00:00:16.949> you<00:00:17.010> what<00:00:17.460> I'm<00:00:17.550> gonna<00:00:17.640> do<00:00:17.880> today<00:00:18.060> and

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:19.250 
to show you what I'm gonna do today and

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.519 
to show you what I'm gonna do today and
it's<00:00:20.250> it<00:00:20.760> should<00:00:21.060> be<00:00:21.180> interesting<00:00:21.779> I<00:00:21.900> do<00:00:22.289> also

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
it's it should be interesting I do also

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.080 
it's it should be interesting I do also
need<00:00:22.740> to<00:00:22.890> sort<00:00:23.100> out<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.279> light<00:00:23.490> I've<00:00:23.670> changed

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
need to sort out the light I've changed

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.410 
need to sort out the light I've changed
the<00:00:24.150> LED<00:00:24.960> on<00:00:24.990> this<00:00:25.260> and<00:00:25.439> as<00:00:25.619> you'll<00:00:25.769> see<00:00:25.830> it's

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:26.420 
the LED on this and as you'll see it's

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.370 
the LED on this and as you'll see it's
ridiculously<00:00:27.420> bright<00:00:27.630> so<00:00:27.990> I<00:00:28.019> would<00:00:28.140> have<00:00:28.230> put

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
ridiculously bright so I would have put

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.299 
ridiculously bright so I would have put
a<00:00:28.410> little<00:00:28.470> bit<00:00:28.769> of<00:00:28.859> a<00:00:29.119> lamp<00:00:30.119> on<00:00:31.219> resistor<00:00:32.219> on

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
a little bit of a lamp on resistor on

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.700 
a little bit of a lamp on resistor on
that<00:00:32.460> one<00:00:32.579> to<00:00:32.820> give<00:00:32.969> that<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.329> better<00:00:33.989> anyway

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
that one to give that to better anyway

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.180 
that one to give that to better anyway
so<00:00:34.770> I<00:00:34.860> switch<00:00:35.070> it<00:00:35.219> on<00:00:35.340> and<00:00:36.320> it's<00:00:37.320> a<00:00:37.410> moment<00:00:37.800> it's

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
so I switch it on and it's a moment it's

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.400 
so I switch it on and it's a moment it's
just<00:00:38.760> using<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.120> really<00:00:40.020> really<00:00:40.410> simple

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410 
just using the really really simple

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:48.200 
just using the really really simple
yellow<00:00:43.410> AV<00:00:45.500> cable<00:00:46.500> composite<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.850> of<00:00:48.000> course

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
yellow AV cable composite and of course

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.270 
yellow AV cable composite and of course
when<00:00:48.930> use<00:00:49.079> composite<00:00:49.469> with<00:00:49.800> these<00:00:49.950> switch

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
when use composite with these switch

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.819 
when use composite with these switch
things<00:00:50.610> an<00:00:51.449> interesting<00:00:52.050> thing<00:00:52.260> happens<00:00:52.649> so

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
things an interesting thing happens so

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.799 
things an interesting thing happens so
at<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:52.949> moment<00:00:53.070> I've<00:00:53.280> got<00:00:53.309> it<00:00:53.489> set<00:00:53.670> for<00:00:53.879> 50

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
at the moment I've got it set for 50

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.170 
at the moment I've got it set for 50
Hertz<00:00:55.020> and<00:00:55.199> we<00:00:55.260> just<00:00:55.469> I've<00:00:56.280> got<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.489> 16-1

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
Hertz and we just I've got a 16-1

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.720 
Hertz and we just I've got a 16-1
cartridge<00:00:57.899> you<00:00:58.020> know<00:00:58.460> there's<00:00:59.460> some<00:00:59.609> good

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
cartridge you know there's some good

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.920 
cartridge you know there's some good
games<00:00:59.940> I

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:01.930 
games I

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:03.960 
games I
we<00:01:02.350> start<00:01:02.620> the<00:01:02.740> usual<00:01:03.070> test<00:01:03.340> which<00:01:03.580> everybody

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:03.970 
we start the usual test which everybody

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.870 
we start the usual test which everybody
knows<00:01:04.150> and<00:01:04.330> loves<00:01:04.770> just<00:01:05.770> Streets<00:01:06.040> of<00:01:06.190> Rage<00:01:06.250> and

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
knows and loves just Streets of Rage and

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.360 
knows and loves just Streets of Rage and
of<00:01:07.300> course<00:01:07.510> obviously<00:01:07.870> at<00:01:08.680> the<00:01:08.770> moment<00:01:08.920> it's

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:09.370 
of course obviously at the moment it's

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:11.790 
of course obviously at the moment it's
set<00:01:09.580> for<00:01:09.820> pal

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:11.800 
set for pal

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.850 
set for pal
50<00:01:12.400> Hertz<00:01:12.610> as<00:01:13.600> far<00:01:14.140> as<00:01:14.230> its<00:01:14.380> concerned<00:01:14.410> it's<00:01:14.800> a

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
50 Hertz as far as its concerned it's a

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.460 
50 Hertz as far as its concerned it's a
European<00:01:15.540> it's<00:01:16.540> just<00:01:16.660> obviously<00:01:17.170> about<00:01:17.410> the

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:17.470 
European it's just obviously about the

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.260 
European it's just obviously about the
language<00:01:17.920> switch<00:01:18.160> for<00:01:18.340> the<00:01:18.430> the<00:01:18.790> one<00:01:18.940> I<00:01:18.970> want

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
language switch for the the one I want

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.030 
language switch for the the one I want
to<00:01:19.360> test<00:01:19.600> is<00:01:19.780> the<00:01:19.900> 60<00:01:20.230> Hertz<00:01:20.410> which<00:01:20.650> now<00:01:20.860> with<00:01:21.010> a

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040 
to test is the 60 Hertz which now with a

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.060 
to test is the 60 Hertz which now with a
composite<00:01:21.730> input<00:01:22.150> without<00:01:23.020> the<00:01:23.230> are<00:01:23.350> a<00:01:23.380> RGB

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
composite input without the are a RGB

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.660 
composite input without the are a RGB
when<00:01:24.580> you<00:01:24.730> switch<00:01:25.090> it<00:01:25.270> on<00:01:25.330> to<00:01:25.570> 60<00:01:26.170> Hertz<00:01:26.670> there

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
when you switch it on to 60 Hertz there

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:28.050 
when you switch it on to 60 Hertz there
you<00:01:27.730> go

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
you go

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.870 
you go
it's<00:01:28.780> trying<00:01:29.110> to<00:01:29.200> find<00:01:29.440> an<00:01:29.560> NTSC<00:01:30.190> signal<00:01:30.430> and

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
it's trying to find an NTSC signal and

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.040 
it's trying to find an NTSC signal and
if<00:01:31.030> you<00:01:31.150> notice<00:01:31.480> here<00:01:31.720> it's<00:01:31.840> got<00:01:31.960> this

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.050 
if you notice here it's got this

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:39.510 
if you notice here it's got this
dreadful<00:01:34.440> banding<00:01:36.090> colors<00:01:38.130> but<00:01:39.130> it's<00:01:39.340> a<00:01:39.400> lot

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
dreadful banding colors but it's a lot

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:48.810 
dreadful banding colors but it's a lot
faster<00:01:40.060> so<00:01:42.180> compared<00:01:43.180> to<00:01:43.240> the<00:01:46.200> 50<00:01:47.200> Hertz<00:01:47.820> which

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
faster so compared to the 50 Hertz which

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.580 
faster so compared to the 50 Hertz which
is<00:01:48.970> the<00:01:49.150> standard<00:01:49.750> Powell<00:01:50.170> and<00:01:50.470> it's

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
is the standard Powell and it's

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.320 
is the standard Powell and it's
obviously<00:01:50.830> found<00:01:51.010> Powell<00:01:51.400> there<00:01:51.610> now<00:01:52.270> the

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.330 
obviously found Powell there now the

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
obviously found Powell there now the
reason<00:01:52.630> why<00:01:52.720> it<00:01:52.780> does<00:01:52.960> this<00:01:52.990> is<00:01:53.440> because<00:01:55.350> the

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
reason why it does this is because the

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.140 
reason why it does this is because the
reason<00:01:56.470> why<00:01:56.619> it<00:01:56.680> does<00:01:56.830> this<00:01:56.860> is<00:01:57.190> because<00:01:57.520> the

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:58.150 
reason why it does this is because the

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.030 
reason why it does this is because the
50<00:01:58.450> CCS<00:01:58.840> isn't<00:01:59.200> quite<00:01:59.950> correct<00:02:00.640> because<00:02:01.540> they

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
50 CCS isn't quite correct because they

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.560 
50 CCS isn't quite correct because they
say<00:02:03.040> go<00:02:03.250> to<00:02:03.430> keep<00:02:03.820> the<00:02:03.880> cost<00:02:04.060> down<00:02:04.180> obviously

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
say go to keep the cost down obviously

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:05.970 
say go to keep the cost down obviously
they<00:02:04.690> put<00:02:04.840> the<00:02:04.960> switches<00:02:05.320> in<00:02:05.470> and<00:02:05.650> just<00:02:05.770> bridge

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:05.980 
they put the switches in and just bridge

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:10.520 
they put the switches in and just bridge
things<00:02:06.490> and<00:02:07.150> also<00:02:07.630> had<00:02:08.050> over<00:02:08.080> main<00:02:08.790> chip

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
things and also had over main chip

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.710 
things and also had over main chip
oscillator<00:02:11.530> was<00:02:12.070> set<00:02:12.670> so<00:02:13.030> that<00:02:13.060> it's<00:02:13.360> divided

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
oscillator was set so that it's divided

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.729 
oscillator was set so that it's divided
by<00:02:13.989> 15<00:02:14.440> 12<00:02:14.709> anyway<00:02:15.070> it's<00:02:15.160> very<00:02:15.310> complicated

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
by 15 12 anyway it's very complicated

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.020 
by 15 12 anyway it's very complicated
and<00:02:17.739> all<00:02:17.920> what<00:02:18.010> I'm<00:02:18.100> gonna<00:02:18.220> do<00:02:18.430> is<00:02:18.670> I'm<00:02:18.850> going

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
and all what I'm gonna do is I'm going

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.800 
and all what I'm gonna do is I'm going
to<00:02:19.150> because<00:02:19.959> this<00:02:20.110> is<00:02:20.260> the<00:02:20.440> Mega<00:02:20.800> Drive<00:02:20.980> one

pal-60 signal to be sent out so I'm

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.530 
pal-60 signal to be sent out so I'm
gonna<00:02:34.120> do<00:02:34.330> that<00:02:35.430> okay<00:02:36.430> so<00:02:36.489> this<00:02:37.060> is<00:02:37.239> the<00:02:37.330> chip

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
gonna do that okay so this is the chip

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.850 
gonna do that okay so this is the chip

very interested in the Sony CX a11 for
5p<00:02:42.489> chip<00:02:42.760> and<00:02:43.209> what<00:02:43.660> we're<00:02:43.780> gonna<00:02:43.870> do<00:02:44.080> is<00:02:44.320> I'm

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
5p chip and what we're gonna do is I'm

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.830 
5p chip and what we're gonna do is I'm
gonna<00:02:44.860> use<00:02:45.160> my<00:02:45.370> fancy<00:02:46.030> new<00:02:46.060> D<00:02:46.299> soldering<00:02:46.660> gun

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
gonna use my fancy new D soldering gun

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.470 
gonna use my fancy new D soldering gun
and<00:02:47.019> just<00:02:47.080> D<00:02:47.380> solder<00:02:47.709> this<00:02:47.830> chip<00:02:48.130> and<00:02:48.480> solder

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
and just D solder this chip and solder

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.990 
and just D solder this chip and solder
on<00:02:49.630> a<00:02:49.900> separate<00:02:50.799> timing<00:02:51.160> crystal<00:02:51.580> so<00:02:51.790> that<00:02:51.910> it

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
on a separate timing crystal so that it

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000 
on a separate timing crystal so that it
only<00:02:52.150> takes<00:02:52.480> the<00:02:52.690> timing<00:02:53.110> for<00:02:53.680> the<00:02:53.799> color

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
only takes the timing for the color

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.880 
only takes the timing for the color
encoding<00:02:54.850> directly<00:02:55.660> from<00:02:56.260> this<00:02:56.500> crystal

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
encoding directly from this crystal

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.979 
encoding directly from this crystal
rather<00:02:57.130> than<00:02:57.400> from<00:02:57.580> the<00:02:57.790> system<00:02:58.180> and<00:02:58.360> that

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
rather than from the system and that

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:02.130 
rather than from the system and that
should<00:02:59.260> eliminate<00:02:59.790> 50<00:03:00.790> 60<00:03:01.090> Hertz<00:03:01.299> problem<00:03:01.750> and

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
should eliminate 50 60 Hertz problem and

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.490 
should eliminate 50 60 Hertz problem and
we<00:03:02.260> should<00:03:02.470> get<00:03:02.590> a<00:03:02.650> really<00:03:02.890> nice<00:03:03.100> clean<00:03:03.400> pal

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
we should get a really nice clean pal

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.810 
we should get a really nice clean pal
signal<00:03:06.690> okay<00:03:07.690> so<00:03:07.750> that's<00:03:08.080> the<00:03:08.370> chip<00:03:09.370> all<00:03:09.580> set

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
signal okay so that's the chip all set

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.170 
signal okay so that's the chip all set
up<00:03:10.000> and<00:03:11.130> crystal<00:03:12.130> is<00:03:12.160> now<00:03:12.340> in<00:03:12.549> there's<00:03:13.150> a

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
up and crystal is now in there's a

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.620 
up and crystal is now in there's a
resistor<00:03:13.780> a<00:03:13.810> capacitor<00:03:13.870> and<00:03:14.650> then<00:03:14.769> here<00:03:15.040> is<00:03:15.160> a

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
resistor a capacitor and then here is a

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.690 
resistor a capacitor and then here is a
a<00:03:15.690> variable<00:03:16.500> capacitor<00:03:16.680> just<00:03:17.220> for

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
a variable capacitor just for

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.870 
a variable capacitor just for
fine-tuning<00:03:17.970> when<00:03:18.510> we<00:03:18.660> put<00:03:19.260> this<00:03:19.380> I<00:03:19.880> think

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
fine-tuning when we put this I think

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.130 
fine-tuning when we put this I think
that's<00:03:21.210> all<00:03:21.360> I<00:03:21.390> need<00:03:21.600> to<00:03:21.720> do<00:03:21.840> now<00:03:21.990> is<00:03:22.050> just

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
that's all I need to do now is just

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.670 
that's all I need to do now is just
literally<00:03:22.830> drop<00:03:23.070> this<00:03:23.220> back<00:03:23.520> into<00:03:23.730> the

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
literally drop this back into the

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.850 
literally drop this back into the
motherboard<00:03:25.680> and<00:03:26.480> ground<00:03:27.480> pin<00:03:27.990> one<00:03:28.230> to<00:03:28.500> pin

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
motherboard and ground pin one to pin

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.580 
motherboard and ground pin one to pin
seven<00:03:29.250> on<00:03:29.970> the<00:03:30.450> on<00:03:30.750> the<00:03:30.840> other<00:03:30.990> side<00:03:31.260> and

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
seven on the on the other side and

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.660 
seven on the on the other side and
that's<00:03:31.800> that<00:03:32.900> okay<00:03:33.900> so<00:03:34.500> the<00:03:34.800> chips<00:03:35.280> back<00:03:35.490> in

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
that's that okay so the chips back in

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.060 
that's that okay so the chips back in
place<00:03:35.910> being<00:03:36.210> soldered<00:03:36.630> in<00:03:36.810> and<00:03:37.230> I've<00:03:37.830> wired

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
place being soldered in and I've wired

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.430 
place being soldered in and I've wired
underneath<00:03:38.630> one<00:03:39.630> two<00:03:39.810> seven<00:03:39.960> to<00:03:40.200> make<00:03:40.320> it

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
underneath one two seven to make it

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.920 
underneath one two seven to make it
permanent<00:03:40.590> aground<00:03:40.920> and<00:03:41.510> now<00:03:42.510> we<00:03:42.570> should<00:03:42.720> have

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
permanent aground and now we should have

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.640 
permanent aground and now we should have
power<00:03:43.800> 60<00:03:44.250> and<00:03:44.570> 50<00:03:45.570> Hertz<00:03:45.930> coming<00:03:46.320> from<00:03:46.470> this

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
power 60 and 50 Hertz coming from this

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.610 
power 60 and 50 Hertz coming from this
from<00:03:47.160> this<00:03:47.310> crystal<00:03:48.270> here<00:03:48.450> while<00:03:49.320> I<00:03:49.350> was<00:03:49.500> in

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
from this crystal here while I was in

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.310 
from this crystal here while I was in
now<00:03:49.770> I<00:03:49.800> took<00:03:49.950> out<00:03:50.250> the<00:03:50.430> RF<00:03:51.420> block<00:03:51.720> as<00:03:51.900> well<00:03:52.080> so

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
now I took out the RF block as well so

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.420 
now I took out the RF block as well so
some<00:03:52.500> thought<00:03:53.130> I<00:03:53.610> might<00:03:54.420> I'll<00:03:54.720> give<00:03:54.900> it<00:03:54.990> a<00:03:55.050> go

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
some thought I might I'll give it a go

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.060 
some thought I might I'll give it a go
now<00:03:56.430> let's<00:03:57.240> switch<00:03:57.930> on<00:03:58.200> and<00:03:58.500> just<00:03:58.650> test

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
now let's switch on and just test

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:10.250 
now let's switch on and just test
I<00:03:59.190> think<00:04:00.890> it's<00:04:01.890> on<00:04:02.190> and<00:04:04.550> TV<00:04:05.550> says<00:04:07.460> pal-60<00:04:09.260> nice

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
I think it's on and TV says pal-60 nice

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:15.380 
I think it's on and TV says pal-60 nice
color<00:04:10.650> sixty<00:04:11.310> Hertz<00:04:13.580> just<00:04:14.580> choose<00:04:14.940> to<00:04:15.180> use

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
color sixty Hertz just choose to use

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:24.300 
color sixty Hertz just choose to use
your<00:04:15.570> game

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:32.540 

so<00:04:25.310> I<00:04:25.340> see<00:04:25.940> where<00:04:26.120> we<00:04:26.210> are

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.029 

you<00:04:33.550> know<00:04:33.699> over<00:04:34.150> in<00:04:34.210> Japanese<00:04:34.630> motels<00:04:35.289> fine

00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:36.039 
you know over in Japanese motels fine

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:42.390 
you know over in Japanese motels fine
so<00:04:36.850> we<00:04:37.030> set<00:04:37.840> to<00:04:37.960> English<00:04:40.110> it's<00:04:41.110> in<00:04:41.380> English<00:04:42.250> in

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 
so we set to English it's in English in

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.309 
so we set to English it's in English in
a<00:04:42.460> second<00:04:42.729> with<00:04:42.849> the<00:04:42.940> next<00:04:43.240> paragraph<00:04:43.630> there

00:04:44.309 --> 00:04:44.319 
a second with the next paragraph there

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:50.339 
a second with the next paragraph there
we<00:04:44.380> go<00:04:44.530> and<00:04:44.860> then<00:04:46.830> nice<00:04:47.830> and<00:04:47.860> slow<00:04:48.130> and<00:04:49.349> pal

00:04:50.339 --> 00:04:50.349 
we go and then nice and slow and pal

00:04:50.349 --> 00:05:02.969 
we go and then nice and slow and pal
fifty<00:04:50.979> Hertz<00:04:59.370> sixty<00:05:00.370> years<00:05:01.020> now<00:05:02.020> there's<00:05:02.919> a

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:02.979 
fifty Hertz sixty years now there's a

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:06.140 
fifty Hertz sixty years now there's a
little<00:05:03.160> bit<00:05:03.280> of<00:05:03.430> fine<00:05:03.639> tuning<00:05:03.669> to<00:05:04.090> be<00:05:04.270> done

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
little bit of fine tuning to be done

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:12.900 
little bit of fine tuning to be done
which<00:05:07.150> should<00:05:07.330> be<00:05:07.509> in<00:05:09.509> this<00:05:10.509> little<00:05:10.900> pot<00:05:11.910> right

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:12.910 
which should be in this little pot right

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:15.420 
which should be in this little pot right
here<00:05:13.300> so<00:05:14.139> just<00:05:14.410> go<00:05:14.500> to<00:05:14.560> adjust<00:05:14.889> it<00:05:15.039> like<00:05:15.190> that

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.430 
here so just go to adjust it like that

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.390 
here so just go to adjust it like that
but<00:05:16.180> it's<00:05:16.690> best<00:05:16.840> not<00:05:16.990> to<00:05:17.050> do<00:05:17.259> on<00:05:17.410> this<00:05:17.560> LCD<00:05:18.039> TV

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 
but it's best not to do on this LCD TV

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:23.070 
but it's best not to do on this LCD TV
because<00:05:19.440> this<00:05:20.440> TV<00:05:20.830> is<00:05:20.979> going<00:05:21.190> to<00:05:21.900> it's<00:05:22.900> pretty

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.080 
because this TV is going to it's pretty

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.689 
because this TV is going to it's pretty
good<00:05:23.289> at<00:05:23.440> guessing<00:05:23.680> what<00:05:23.919> it's<00:05:24.190> trying<00:05:24.400> to<00:05:24.520> do

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:24.699 
good at guessing what it's trying to do

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:27.659 
good at guessing what it's trying to do
it's<00:05:24.849> actually<00:05:24.970> quite<00:05:25.300> a<00:05:25.330> good<00:05:25.419> TV<00:05:25.750> for<00:05:26.669> doing

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:27.669 
it's actually quite a good TV for doing

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:29.760 
it's actually quite a good TV for doing
things<00:05:27.880> so<00:05:28.060> I'm<00:05:28.120> gonna<00:05:28.240> take<00:05:28.389> this<00:05:28.509> to<00:05:29.289> one<00:05:29.740> of

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:29.770 
things so I'm gonna take this to one of

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:32.730 
things so I'm gonna take this to one of
my<00:05:29.949> other<00:05:30.039> TVs<00:05:30.750> probably<00:05:31.750> a<00:05:31.780> CRT<00:05:32.080> and<00:05:32.500> just

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:32.740 
my other TVs probably a CRT and just

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.350 
my other TVs probably a CRT and just
make<00:05:32.860> sure<00:05:33.009> that<00:05:33.069> the<00:05:33.370> colors<00:05:33.789> are<00:05:33.819> nice<00:05:34.030> and

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.360 
make sure that the colors are nice and

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:39.060 
make sure that the colors are nice and
bright<00:05:35.319> on<00:05:35.440> that<00:05:35.470> so<00:05:35.800> now<00:05:35.949> we<00:05:36.009> have<00:05:36.250> a<00:05:36.570> power<00:05:38.070> 60

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:39.070 
bright on that so now we have a power 60

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:40.770 
bright on that so now we have a power 60
signal<00:05:39.430> coming<00:05:39.759> just<00:05:39.970> from<00:05:40.090> the<00:05:40.270> composite

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:40.780 
signal coming just from the composite

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:46.499 
signal coming just from the composite
output<00:05:41.370> so<00:05:42.370> this<00:05:42.610> is<00:05:42.759> truly<00:05:43.680> Universal<00:05:45.210> as<00:05:46.210> we

00:05:46.499 --> 00:05:46.509 
output so this is truly Universal as we

00:05:46.509 --> 00:05:51.810 
output so this is truly Universal as we
flip<00:05:46.690> the<00:05:46.810> switches<00:05:47.020> it's<00:05:47.409> a<00:05:47.560> little<00:05:47.770> bit<00:05:50.520> yeah

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:51.820 
flip the switches it's a little bit yeah

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:56.810 
flip the switches it's a little bit yeah
oh<00:05:51.849> good<00:05:53.460> so<00:05:54.460> there<00:05:54.639> we<00:05:54.729> have<00:05:54.759> it<00:05:54.969> one<00:05:55.349> finished

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:56.820 
oh good so there we have it one finished

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:01.529 
oh good so there we have it one finished
Mega<00:05:57.820> Drive<00:05:58.060> with<00:05:58.419> reason<00:05:59.380> switches<00:06:00.330> on<00:06:01.330> and

00:06:01.529 --> 00:06:01.539 
Mega Drive with reason switches on and

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:03.839 
Mega Drive with reason switches on and
that<00:06:01.719> blue<00:06:02.320> light<00:06:02.500> is<00:06:02.710> a<00:06:02.740> lot<00:06:03.159> less<00:06:03.370> now<00:06:03.580> but<00:06:03.789> a

00:06:03.839 --> 00:06:03.849 
that blue light is a lot less now but a

00:06:03.849 --> 00:06:06.270 
that blue light is a lot less now but a
10k<00:06:04.270> resistor<00:06:04.719> in<00:06:04.840> there<00:06:05.050> through<00:06:05.259> there<00:06:05.440> just

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:06.280 
10k resistor in there through there just

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:06.689 
10k resistor in there through there just
to<00:06:06.370> be<00:06:06.490> sure

00:06:06.689 --> 00:06:06.699 
to be sure

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:23.590 
to be sure
and

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:23.600 

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:29.510 

so<00:06:24.600> now<00:06:25.320> we<00:06:25.380> have<00:06:25.590> this<00:06:25.740> now<00:06:25.950> on<00:06:27.470> 60<00:06:28.470> Hertz<00:06:28.860> if

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:29.520 
so now we have this now on 60 Hertz if

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:33.440 
so now we have this now on 60 Hertz if
we<00:06:29.700> flick<00:06:29.940> the<00:06:30.090> switch<00:06:31.580> you<00:06:32.580> go<00:06:32.730> and<00:06:33.120> now<00:06:33.330> it

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:33.450 
we flick the switch you go and now it

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:39.170 
we flick the switch you go and now it
says<00:06:33.660> it<00:06:34.080> should<00:06:34.350> say<00:06:34.590> it's<00:06:34.770> pal<00:06:37.730> and<00:06:38.730> Japanese

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:39.180 
says it should say it's pal and Japanese

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:43.460 
says it should say it's pal and Japanese
which<00:06:39.600> is<00:06:39.810> doesn't<00:06:40.680> exist<00:06:41.070> in<00:06:41.490> the<00:06:41.700> world<00:06:42.470> over

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:43.470 
which is doesn't exist in the world over

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:46.820 
which is doesn't exist in the world over
to<00:06:43.590> English<00:06:44.900> so<00:06:45.900> that's<00:06:45.990> a<00:06:46.170> pal<00:06:46.410> English

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:46.830 
to English so that's a pal English

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:50.690 
to English so that's a pal English
machine<00:06:47.190> now<00:06:47.400> European<00:06:48.060> machine<00:06:49.490> nice<00:06:50.490> and

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:50.700 
machine now European machine nice and

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:51.830 
machine now European machine nice and
slow<00:06:50.970> lovely

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:51.840 
slow lovely

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:55.940 
slow lovely
and<00:06:51.930> then<00:06:53.300> now<00:06:54.300> an<00:06:54.480> American<00:06:54.690> machine<00:06:55.320> so<00:06:55.920> I

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:55.950 
and then now an American machine so I

00:06:55.950 --> 00:07:01.550 
and then now an American machine so I
should<00:06:56.190> say<00:06:56.340> pal-60<00:06:57.000> up<00:06:57.180> there<00:07:00.380> and<00:07:01.380> then

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:01.560 
should say pal-60 up there and then

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:02.870 
should say pal-60 up there and then
we'll<00:07:01.680> make<00:07:01.860> you<00:07:01.980> Japanese<00:07:02.340> again<00:07:02.550> so<00:07:02.760> now

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:02.880 
we'll make you Japanese again so now

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:09.640 
we'll make you Japanese again so now
it's<00:07:03.000> Japanese<00:07:03.150> machine<00:07:04.370> there<00:07:05.370> we<00:07:05.430> go

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:09.650 

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:11.870 

I'll<00:07:10.650> probably<00:07:10.860> show<00:07:11.130> the<00:07:11.280> picture<00:07:11.640> and<00:07:11.730> be

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:11.880 
I'll probably show the picture and be

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:18.200 
I'll probably show the picture and be
very<00:07:12.120> very<00:07:16.490> garbled<00:07:17.490> cuz<00:07:17.910> we've<00:07:18.060> been

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:18.210 
very very garbled cuz we've been

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:20.930 
very very garbled cuz we've been
flicking<00:07:18.450> with<00:07:18.480> switches
