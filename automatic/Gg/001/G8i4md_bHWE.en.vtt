00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
have his rhythm if they really did in

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.040 
have his rhythm if they really did in
the<00:00:38.340> early<00:00:38.610> going<00:00:38.879> and<00:00:39.000> absolutely<00:00:39.390> but

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
the early going and absolutely but

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.200 
the early going and absolutely but
LeBron<00:00:40.559> James<00:00:41.160> did<00:00:41.399> a<00:00:41.460> great<00:00:41.760> job<00:00:41.790> of

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
LeBron James did a great job of

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.660 
LeBron James did a great job of
attacking<00:00:42.600> his<00:00:43.230> single<00:00:43.710> defensive<00:00:44.460> coverage

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
attacking his single defensive coverage

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.580 
attacking his single defensive coverage
whether<00:00:45.239> it<00:00:45.360> be<00:00:45.450> Michael<00:00:45.629> Petrus<00:00:46.140> of<00:00:46.289> Brandon

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
whether it be Michael Petrus of Brandon

whether it be Michael Petrus of Brandon
Bass<00:00:46.770> he<00:00:47.250> was<00:00:47.460> dominant<00:00:47.969> I<00:00:48.239> look<00:00:48.750> for<00:00:48.930> more<00:00:49.110> of

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
Bass he was dominant I look for more of

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.630 
Bass he was dominant I look for more of
that<00:00:49.620> but<00:00:49.860> I<00:00:49.890> think<00:00:50.010> it's<00:00:50.190> gonna<00:00:50.280> be<00:00:50.430> really

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
that but I think it's gonna be really

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.700 
that but I think it's gonna be really
key<00:00:51.090> for<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:51.870> Miami<00:00:52.110> Heat<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.230> recognize
