00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 or the youtube peÃ±a here manuel bad in 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:08.450
 word in two today we are going to examine the 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:10.670
 seraphim weapons of captain's tlc 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.440
 scarlett 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.530
 if we are going to see the one in the market 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:20.450
 for now here we have the blood of 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:24.380
 the seraphim gives you 36% more health 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:28.940
 and there is also regeneration per second of 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:32.000
 0.9 percent its power flows through 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:34.280
 your whole body that is the description if 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.070
 we could match it something would be the 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.739
 blood of the amorphous terra but this one has 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.860
 a little bit more advantage 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:46.940
 they're worth here we're going to see another seraph weapon 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:48.739
 which is called seraphim that easy 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.589
 a good damage the truth a rifle 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:54.470
 assault good cadence pretty charger 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:56.120
 great attention burns by 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.850
 second and the probability of contracting 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:01.960
 it's not big but its good 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:05.000
 holy sacred description taken 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.020
 update let's see it update the 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.880
 update 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.399
 if the truth is that it is one of the 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.619
 best weapons of this dlc that we can 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:15.570
 find in the market a good damage 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.299
 good precision to make a suv 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.950
 matching load speed good 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.929
 also and the size of the charger also 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.679
 it's acceptable we have to talk about your 

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:28.590
 200 dps precision report by 

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:30.450
 hundred more of the year of the year not of the weapon 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.170
 forgiveness increases stability and 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:37.649
 shoot it increases the clear precision 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.640
 that happens because it 's hyperion we're going to 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:43.619
 see right now update in action 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.929
 how is the update in action here 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.360
 they are seeing the truth is that yes it is a 

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:50.369
 enjoyed the first shots like all 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.470
 Expression weapons are lost but 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:56.190
 after that it is when it has stabilized 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:58.710
 by the effect of the weapons in question 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:01.350
 nothing the shots are very very very 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.260
 precise and the truth that we have to 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:07.380
 do when it is already in egg 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:09.930
 and with its maximum boiling with its good 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.000
 maximum effect as he says then nothing 

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:15.540
 look for the head of the enemy in question 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.270
 and so do many many more damages 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.070
 here as they are seeing me also the 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.380
 truth is that with all the weapons of 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:25.350
 hyperion I advise to do what I have 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.720
 done with this first start by pointing 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:30.180
 with the peephole meter look and then 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.610
 when the effect is already achieved if 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.910
 it is wanted then the minilla separates and 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:38.100
 it ended up worth nothing more than saying this weapon 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.360
 the truth is that it is very good and the 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.090
 time to get a second 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.280
 opportunity as we're going to see here by 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.910
 example the truth that if it can come to us 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:50.490
 great because that description what 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.890
 effects have this weapon is in all 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:56.819
 the effects are valid in all the effects 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:59.010
 less in the explosive 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:01.129
 and they are asking him because he has 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:07.530
 that description of we have to talk about 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:10.319
 ps tps is lady to see is com 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:13.049
 say damage per second as I would say a 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:16.410
 english player that abbreviation tell me 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:18.870
 that long phrase gets on ps 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:21.810
 of bs is widely used in games of 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:24.270
 role or style also world of warcraft and 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.820
 means the damage that you can do in 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:29.910
 a second compared to your opponent if 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:32.340
 you do more damage than your opponent during 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.350
 a second or the same amount of 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.240
 time that the rival to beat then 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:39.670
 simply if yours is greater 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:41.650
 You have won if you are younger because you are lost 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.690
 that's how easy it is for this 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:47.170
 description that maybe after a 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.940
 you be so weird if so 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.920
 they see it in the market and they can 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:54.099
 buy the I advise you to 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:56.590
 make this dlc that I buy it indeed 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:58.780
 igneous is to say game because because here 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:01.330
 all the pirates and almost all the fauna 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:04.600
 is of flesh and bone are worth not go to 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:06.880
 buy in effect was born or electric 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:09.670
 it does not not deserve at least for me the 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:12.459
 sorry buy the in effect and genius and now 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:15.130
 let's see the seraphic in question the 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:16.660
 seraphim the seraphim because she has that 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.820
 description 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:22.990
 the end sidewalk has that description of 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:25.960
 Sacred sacred sacred because it means 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:28.930
 that this weapon only comes out in igneous 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.640
 if you are alone it comes out in effect worthy and 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.280
 let's do what we do, let's look for it 

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:35.770
 as we look for it, it only has that fire and 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.660
 fire why that description the fire 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.700
 as in ancient times it was considered 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.860
 something sacred and the truth is that if the 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:44.289
 fire must be something sacred but with 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:47.289
 what we have to be careful 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:50.409
 how to use it how are you seeing if there is a 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:52.419
 rival as I am now for example 

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:54.789
 at medium distance to lengthen using 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:56.830
 shoot in gusts and go calmly 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:58.779
 to make a dalt gun allows us 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:00.610
 that now as for example in nothing the 

00:04:58.779 --> 00:05:04.020
 dwarf that is approaching you can 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:06.160
 shoot like this continuously 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:09.100
 and the truth is that 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:11.800
 seraphim this weapon can save us from 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:14.080
 more of a mess and it is also recommended 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:16.900
 as it can only be purchased in effect 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:19.540
 igneous because alone 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.490
 you can then just have it in effect and 

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:23.190
 genius 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:25.740
 it is ideal to get this dlc if it is 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:28.169
 ideal so nothing if you can buy it 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:29.669
 remember buy the anp because the 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:32.160
 true to be made this dlc so 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:34.259
 unless they're going to be worth it here they see me 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:38.600
 time to look for a second chance 

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:41.420
 if the opponent is close to a distance 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:44.000
 medium close but preferably close 

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:46.520
 the truth is that if this weapon what you 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.740
 failure is the accuracy the truth is that 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:51.560
 to make an assault rifle has a 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:54.380
 fairly regular precision regular vale 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:58.490
 here you are seeing me at the time of 

00:05:54.380 --> 00:06:00.920
 example attack as I was saying nothing 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:04.460
 I'm peeking if the average is up 

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:06.470
 or long distance and use the way 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:08.600
 normal is to say shooting from the 

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:10.670
 hip in case the opponent gets 

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:12.410
 approach you and you have seen me this 

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:15.710
 pirates and the truth is that the pirates 

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:18.140
 damn are the hardest enemies of 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:20.150
 this dlc but good here this one has 

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:22.820
 I was looking for and flying, I say who 

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:26.550
 will die who will not die and I endorses and 

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:28.740
 you stay in damn the truth 

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:30.630
 here we are seeing another example but what 

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:32.790
 that was commenting the truth is that a 

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:35.460
 the time to eliminate the fauna that there is 

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:38.130
 in this lp you already know the toxic worms 

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:40.650
 there is also one out there 

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:43.740
 stalker and it 's here that there is also but 

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:46.320
 very little the truth is that this weapon 

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:48.830
 It serves quite well so nothing the only 

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:51.680
 hit that they have is 

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:53.160
 its recoil that maybe it 's very 

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:55.530
 random 

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:59.100
 it's not something important but the bad bad 

00:06:55.530 --> 00:07:01.770
 it really is its scarce almost scarce 

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:03.780
 marksmanship is worth so nothing else 

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:05.820
 Little more must be said as always 

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:09.170
 I have been saying thank you for having seen me 

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:09.170
 and a hug to all
