00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:08.010
 Hello everyone, let's talk about 

00:00:05.729 --> 00:00:10.380
 headphones from the company magnifier many say 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.380
 Chinese can not produce high-end 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:17.039
 headphone technique to things like that 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:19.470
 I already told these headphones a stage m1 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.369
 first model magnetic planar 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.820
 headphones 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.230
 I use it all the time. 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.930
 a cable 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.260
 I drive a headphone sound they just 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:35.250
 went crazy in its class it is very very 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:38.040
 good ears out model for m2 which 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:42.140
 different but here like this 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:45.300
 plastic opening mechanism not metal 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:49.410
 leatherette but they sound exactly the same 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.350
 because the emitter is exactly the same this 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:56.149
 magnetic planar technology 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:58.920
 in general, these are very, very good ears, but 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:00.690
 it's time to talk because when 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.739
 I was in Beijing in one of the last 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.540
 trips just did watching the launch 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:09.450
 phones are the same experience announced headphones 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.900
 who passed a little past me they 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:16.229
 are called o p p m 3 p m 3 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:19.770
 This model is inexpensive outwardly it looks 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:22.500
 like these headphones like a kind 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.229
 small copy but actually 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.090
 differs greatly because if 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.570
 here ambushures can be removed here 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:33.900
 you can shoot very neat feeling 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:37.430
 that tried not to save 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:42.720
 but make the most similar model 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:44.430
 300 here this is how I understand 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.650
 plastic after all this pad 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:52.409
 metal here is this part 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:56.070
 metal complete with n m 3 comes 2 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.810
 cable to adjust the volume answer then 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:02.220
 have as headset can use 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:04.110
 one cable for iphone and the other 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.720
 cable for android 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:10.259
 and here by the way I want to say 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.359
 I tried to sleep 4 iphone ovsky cable 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.750
 one ear just does not work need 

00:02:12.359 --> 00:02:14.970
 Andrew 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.430
 Russian cable take they are produced in 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:23.070
 five different colors I have two 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:27.470
 colors are white and black white looks here 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:31.140
 so bright enough I like well 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.160
 you can never say that 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.560
 it is leatherette 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.080
 because it looks like leather but it is leather 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.800
 skin substitute with good quality 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.990
 although maybe skin can be me here with 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:46.410
 I am so prejudiced that 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:48.810
 in pn2 saved leatherette set tvp m3 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.600
 also had to save on the very 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:55.100
 in fact, maybe not in white 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:58.110
 color headphones are also white Kobelyaki 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:01.459
 I did not see the delivery set as 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:04.650
 our pm looks like one such lacquered 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:07.380
 mahogany box is very cool these 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:10.260
 headphones are cheaper so they probably 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:12.959
 easier on the characteristics at all when we 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:18.030
 talking about the headphones about the sound they are very 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:21.330
 tightly cover the ears here less less 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:23.070
 here these ear cushions they tightly close 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.500
 your ear is suitable for almost everyone 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:27.870
 Well, that is, I do not see those who complain and 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:31.590
 say these headphones are impossible to listen to 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:34.769
 they are noticeably lighter with any 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.600
 head to wear these headphones need 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:39.830
 from afar if you don't understand this 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:43.260
 most likely you think it's 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:45.570
 the model is well that's what's so expensive 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.000
 because if you only saw on 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:51.390
 The pictures are actually headphones 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.030
 relatively budgetary what is 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:56.730
 budget remind pm one worth 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:04:01.350
 Today, about 90 thousand rubles in new 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:07.019
 price characteristics n m 2 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:09.840
 here is n1 n2 costs 60,000 rubles and these 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:13.140
 headphones are 30 m3 35 thousand rubles 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:17.549
 that is, it is possible for the cost of 1 model and 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:21.120
 buy 3 pairs of earphone in different colors 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:24.240
 for example, as an option with these 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:26.250
 headphones it all depends on why 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.350
 you will use them to 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:33.600
 all listen because unlike n1 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:37.560
 n2 sound here is noticeably simpler when i 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:40.050
 I say easier, it is easier in all senses and 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.650
 Of course, here's the effect of the older ones. 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.950
 models 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:46.020
 when you wear ears and understand what 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:48.780
 all you are lost you need to look for money on 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:51.780
 these headphones are not here 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:54.530
 perceived at the model level well 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:57.270
 relatively speaking of the same class 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:05:01.140
 any widely touted 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:04.620
 monster inspiration or something like that 

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:07.919
 that is, those that cost about 400 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:10.380
 dollars provides good decent 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:15.660
 but usually the sound of these headphones 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:17.330
 o-pa and than n m 3 more precisely they provide 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.919
 good habit 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.750
 sound but in no case can not 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:24.210
 provide 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:25.110
 a sound that seemed to hit there 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:28.200
 imagination 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:30.840
 I do nâ€™t want to say this again 

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:32.820
 it somehow look perverted when i 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:35.220
 talking about headphones and can not give 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:37.410
 you listen to them if you and not 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:41.190
 interested I recommend just go 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:44.400
 and listen but basically my heart is like 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:46.860
 not strange but life is given by m1 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:49.860
 this is one of the best magnetically planar 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:53.040
 Headphones that are on the market today 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:53.900
 and I really like them in all 

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:58.350
 meanings 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:06:00.390
 really cool sounding in the ears 

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:03.060
 including portable equipment and if more 

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:04.850
 take an amplifier which company 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:10.020
 releases 

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:13.110
 also 2 pro who also have this video 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:17.250
 thing in general is very, very freaky 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:19.440
 it turns out that's probably writing these 

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:21.630
 headphones somehow separately tell in 

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:24.810
 I do nâ€™t know any traps 

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:26.850
 review but tell you about them all 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:29.330
 good luck good mood stay with 

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:29.330
 bye us
