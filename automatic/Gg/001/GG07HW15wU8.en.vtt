in my opinion this trap to a solid

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:37.740 
in my opinion this trap to a solid
because<00:03:34.450> there<00:03:35.230> was<00:03:35.320> a<00:03:35.380> lot<00:03:35.410> of<00:03:35.530> this<00:03:36.750> it

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
actually go into QB mode but instead we

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.550 
actually go into QB mode but instead we

my<00:03:59.260> opinion<00:03:59.590> the<00:04:00.040> QB<00:04:00.640> should<00:04:00.820> have<00:04:00.910> been<00:04:01.030> a<00:04:01.060> lot

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.330 
my opinion the QB should have been a lot

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:05.729 
my opinion the QB should have been a lot
more<00:04:03.090> I'm<00:04:04.090> not<00:04:04.240> think<00:04:04.480> I<00:04:04.900> guess<00:04:05.380> what<00:04:05.530> I<00:04:05.560> want

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
more I'm not think I guess what I want

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:07.170 
more I'm not think I guess what I want
to<00:04:05.800> say<00:04:05.920> is<00:04:05.950> that<00:04:06.070> it<00:04:06.340> should<00:04:06.520> have<00:04:06.610> been<00:04:06.730> so

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
to say is that it should have been so

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.260 
to say is that it should have been so
easy<00:04:07.209> to<00:04:07.750> sway<00:04:08.140> the<00:04:08.380> QB<00:04:08.770> you<00:04:08.980> know<00:04:09.459> because<00:04:10.150> it

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:10.270
