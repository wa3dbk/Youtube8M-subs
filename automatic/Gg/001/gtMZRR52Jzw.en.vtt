battery it goes in a RC car and as you

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.490 
battery it goes in a RC car and as you
can<00:01:05.610> see<00:01:05.790> this<00:01:05.970> one<00:01:06.180> has<00:01:06.330> connector<00:01:09.170> this<00:01:10.170> is<00:01:10.229> a

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
can see this one has connector this is a

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.609 
can see this one has connector this is a

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
as you can see this one does match the

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.710 
as you can see this one does match the
connector<00:01:16.140> it<00:01:16.890> also<00:01:17.009> goes<00:01:17.280> into<00:01:17.490> a<00:01:17.580> RC<00:01:18.060> car<00:01:18.330> but

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
connector it also goes into a RC car but

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.350

it<00:01:18.810> just<00:01:18.990> slides<00:01:19.229> in<00:01:19.729> you<00:01:20.729> got<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.030> positive

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
it just slides in you got the positive

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.690 
it just slides in you got the positive
side<00:01:21.810> here<00:01:22.229> and<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.189> negative<00:01:23.549> side<00:01:23.729> here

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
side here and the negative side here

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.690 
side here and the negative side here
also<00:01:26.700> have<00:01:26.909> a<00:01:27.229> 7.2<00:01:28.229> volt<00:01:29.180> NiCd<00:01:30.180> battery<00:01:30.570> and

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
also have a 7.2 volt NiCd battery and

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.200

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
another 4.8 volt NiCd battery but this

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.390 
another 4.8 volt NiCd battery but this
one<00:01:36.390> has<00:01:36.570> two<00:01:36.750> cable<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.320> this<00:01:37.619> one<00:01:37.890> goes<00:01:38.070> in<00:01:38.310> a

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
one has two cable and this one goes in a

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.140 
one has two cable and this one goes in a
RC<00:01:38.970> plane<00:01:39.920> this<00:01:40.920> one<00:01:41.130> goes<00:01:41.310> in<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.700> airsoft

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
RC plane this one goes in the airsoft

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.749 
RC plane this one goes in the airsoft
gun<00:01:43.610> on<00:01:45.560> let's<00:01:46.560> see<00:01:46.770> what<00:01:46.979> else<00:01:47.159> is<00:01:47.369> there<00:01:47.579> oh

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
gun on let's see what else is there oh

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.899 
gun on let's see what else is there oh
yeah<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:49.159> disadvantages<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:50.340> advantages<00:01:50.460> of

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
yeah the disadvantages and advantages of

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.260 
yeah the disadvantages and advantages of
using<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:51.540> NiCd<00:01:52.530> battery<00:01:52.860> are<00:01:53.270> the

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
using a NiCd battery are the

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.530 
using a NiCd battery are the
disadvantages<00:01:54.600> are<00:01:55.170> is<00:01:55.439> that<00:01:55.649> a<00:01:55.909> over<00:01:56.909> time

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
disadvantages are is that a over time

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.010 
disadvantages are is that a over time
that<00:01:58.140> if<00:01:58.409> you<00:01:58.680> do<00:01:58.860> not<00:01:59.040> discharge<00:01:59.640> your<00:02:00.210> NiCd

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
that if you do not discharge your NiCd

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.590 
that if you do not discharge your NiCd
battery<00:02:01.380> before<00:02:02.040> recharging<00:02:02.460> it<00:02:02.820> it<00:02:03.420> can

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
battery before recharging it it can

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.200 
battery before recharging it it can
build<00:02:03.780> up<00:02:03.930> a<00:02:04.020> memory<00:02:04.350> and<00:02:04.729> that<00:02:05.729> will<00:02:05.880> make<00:02:06.000> the

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
build up a memory and that will make the

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.980 
build up a memory and that will make the
battery<00:02:06.780> hold<00:02:07.350> less<00:02:07.619> and<00:02:09.050> one<00:02:10.050> advantage<00:02:10.530> of

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
battery hold less and one advantage of

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.400 
battery hold less and one advantage of
using<00:02:11.260> a<00:02:11.380> NiCd<00:02:12.280> battery<00:02:12.640> is<00:02:13.170> that<00:02:14.170> it<00:02:14.260> has<00:02:14.380> a

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
using a NiCd battery is that it has a

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.920 
using a NiCd battery is that it has a
lower<00:02:14.680> discharge<00:02:15.310> rate<00:02:15.670> than<00:02:15.940> they<00:02:16.090> and<00:02:16.330> IMH

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
lower discharge rate than they and IMH

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:23.250 
lower discharge rate than they and IMH
battery<00:02:17.350> or<00:02:17.500> a<00:02:17.530> little<00:02:18.100> battery<00:02:18.460> and<00:02:22.260> sorry

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
battery or a little battery and sorry

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.820 
battery or a little battery and sorry
and<00:02:24.420> if<00:02:25.420> you<00:02:25.690> leave<00:02:25.900> one<00:02:26.140> of<00:02:26.170> these<00:02:26.410> things

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
and if you leave one of these things

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.190 
and if you leave one of these things
fully<00:02:27.160> charged<00:02:27.730> on<00:02:27.940> a<00:02:27.970> shelf<00:02:28.300> for<00:02:28.540> a<00:02:28.570> month<00:02:28.810> you

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
fully charged on a shelf for a month you

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.110 
fully charged on a shelf for a month you
only<00:02:29.380> lose<00:02:29.680> about<00:02:30.010> 20<00:02:30.370> percent<00:02:30.700> of<00:02:30.760> the<00:02:30.820> actual

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
only lose about 20 percent of the actual

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:37.430 
only lose about 20 percent of the actual
charge<00:02:31.420> and<00:02:31.720> you'd<00:02:31.840> still<00:02:32.080> be<00:02:32.110> good<00:02:32.320> to<00:02:32.440> go<00:02:32.620> I
