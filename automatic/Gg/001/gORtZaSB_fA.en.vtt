 extra flow and we are in a new video 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.180
 of gta 5 online this time as you see is a 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.890
 glitch to be able to drive and to be able 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.540
 bring the character in first person 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.160
 without any type of mods without any type 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.049
 of hack and without anything weird is worth a 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.240
 glitch very easy but teach very 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.560
 quick the truth that is cool and good 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.600
 all we have to do is go 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.039
 here at the bottom as I show on the map 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.869
 the two attractions that we see here is what 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.699
 from the beach the pier is worth where it is 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.779
 this of the jet skis and everything and good 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.490
 what we have to do is we have to 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.900
 come here to the Ferris wheel and as you see 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.830
 here arme will go wrong but good what 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.689
 I wanted to teach so you can see 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.800
 that nothing happens what you better 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.780
 we have to do is just we have to 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.340
 say kill ourselves when we say that the 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.630
 basket of the ferris wheel stop but good as 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.610
 you see here I did not have time to kill myself 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.899
 then I had to leave, I'm going to give 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.340
 advice and that is that we have to leave 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.930
 pass the basket when we are for a 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.640
 basket in front of what we see to do the 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.170
 we let pass and just when it happens already 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.280
 let's call the next one and when we 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.870
 we leave ready already in the menu 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.489
 select what dirt is worth as I go 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.649
 to teach now is a click that the truth 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.239
 It's very, very cool, but it's very cool 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.129
 taught robbie and it's okay that you will overcome 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.539
 I work the description so many 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.239
 thanks for teaching us english so that 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.379
 we can share it and good as 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.930
 I already say here what we have to 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.280
 to do is to stop to a basket of these 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.960
 of the Ferris wheel that as you see I leave here 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.810
 pass this and like no half d 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.680
 next I also let it go to 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.330
 committing suicide as we all know 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.310
 they are in select so good 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.630
 when he let this basket pass he called the 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.790
 next and as he called the 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.770
 next I give the select I open the menu 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.180
 of interaction and I give myself to commit suicide 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.920
 and I'm waiting for the basket to 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.150
 stop it is also possible to do it without 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.740
 that looks like this but it has not 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.390
 come out so just when you stop him 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.700
 We commit suicide and well now 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.470
 when we ficyt when we commit suicide 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.119
 we appear on the beach and we will be 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.830
 we will have half glitch done vouchers very 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.970
 very very simple as I say the only thing 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.399
 what we have to do now is we have 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.810
 to go back to the foot and well then we're going 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:41.280
 al pierre we are going to find this 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.710
 what we have to do is enter here 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.210
 to the roller coaster vale is one the other 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.649
 attraction that we have open only 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.060
 the roller coaster is the roller coaster so no 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.350
 nothing complicated and good what we have 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.640
 What to do now is to climb the mountain 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.080
 Russian and wait for him to load the 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.640
 kinematics and once it loads 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.679
 cinematic and all this because the character 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.179
 go up and the whole roll is worth as you are 

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:58.979
 seeing here that you feel sits 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:01.500
 military just when that will appear a 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.670
 bug and we will appear on the wheel as 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.320
 You see we press the wheel what we can 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.520
 to do is that we can change the view and 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.770
 put the view in first person that 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.880
 we have on the roller coaster so what 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.319
 we have now what we have done has 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.180
 been clicking so that we have the 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.920
 first person right on the roller coaster 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.319
 when I pass the whole round 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.520
 the roller coaster then I'm going to make a 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.840
 court is worth it because you are not going to comment on 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.980
 roller coaster for never a quick one is a 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.660
 little useless so I'm going to make a cut 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.980
 and you just take care to see when just 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.170
 when the turn of the mountain ends 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.940
 Russian what happens is how you see it is already 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.530
 finishing the round and we just appear 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.910
 inside the roller coaster like that we 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.170
 we have turned around that what will take 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.520
 I imagine in going around the roller coaster 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.569
 and we will be judged 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.250
 we will appear with the camera in first 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:37.080
 already we can move around the 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.300
 map at the beginning in the camera tides a 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.620
 little the truth is a little messy but and 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.420
 I recommend that when you have this 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.739
 camera set go to spring vale 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.690
 many times in the X's so that if 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:47.370
 you go to spring does as a kind of 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.230
 zoom the camera and we can handle it 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.730
 everything much better the character as 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.410
 I say way a little but a brad that's cool 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.030
 It's really cool as you can see it's very, very 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.560
 cool to be able to handle the character from the 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.000
 let's say, well, there 's also the 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.769
 gray that if we walk around there 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.450
 we give to change the view we will see the 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.640
 picture of the Ferris wheel so it's a bit 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.750
 weird but good as I say this is the 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.340
 leeds I hope you liked it and that 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.630
 be useful we can create people well 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.370
 in fact I'm going I'm going to hit the 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.900
 people so you can see that you can 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.110
 As you can see in mola mola, we can already 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.150
 go as throughout the map we can go 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.310
 seeing everything is very cool we can 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.630
 take out the weapons we can see as I say 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.640
 for we told people to steal the 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.370
 money and as you see here at the end of the 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.540
 from the street uruguay here is my car 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.620
 parked that is what teaches to the 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.940
 beginning of the video we can drive 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.580
 also the car there are times when 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.319
 you climb in the car deviates and osaka the 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.790
 car but then after a while you can go back to 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:34.410
 let's say it's skip the 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.850
 animation and another one of those puts in first 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.709
 person can already against the car as 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.270
 you see well in sprint it controls pretty 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:41.370
 rather better the character and as 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:42.959
 I mean cool, it's cool but that's a lot but 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.130
 that much much good as you see here 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.390
 start hitting people you can 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.440
 hit and everything is done is very cool 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.270
 As you can see here, he starts hitting the kick 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.920
 but you can not see and well, guys 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:51.420
 nothing that 's if it's been from leeds like 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.040

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.570
