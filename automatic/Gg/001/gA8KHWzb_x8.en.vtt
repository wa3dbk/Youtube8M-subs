00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:13.510
 I'm going to show how the command is uncovered 

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:15.650
 of sony model mbt de 011 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:18.110
 all right 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.090
 the remarkable reason because it can do 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.699
 that a button does not work as it has 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.600
 happened to me the volume button 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:26.040
 no does not work varies 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.930
 - We do not have to do is give you the 

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:33.180
 back is the cover 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.180
 take out the batteries 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:47.480
 and remove 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.480
 three screws one is down here 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.020
 and then we have up here 2 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:16.630
 loosened this turn 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.439
 let's see each other a bit so you can walk 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.439
 our screws 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.960
 and now we are here in the drawing of the 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.350
 stack is the printed circuit that goes 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:33.050
 inside of armando what is it that has to be 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.600
 clean then to get it out what 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:38.970
 what we do is 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.970
 support us and stick our finger 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.530
 to force 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:49.470
 and we see how we have uncovered 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.369
 how 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.549
 we already have here in sight of the circuit 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.549
 printed 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:04.030
 and the command of work 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:06.220
 Normally when it does not work 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:09.130
 button is because this printed circuit 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:12.340
 Wet wet for any reason 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:14.950
 a water liquid has condensed I do not know 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.890
 anything to do is clean it 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:21.010
 well with stick well clean both this 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.280
 like the buttons if they have stain 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.280
 as well 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.920
 and we're back to assemble it 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:38.840
 d 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.840
 it is rotating 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.330
 and we have it 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:59.330
 on your site agree to support it 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.820
 a table you have your finger and squeeze 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.200
 the circuit the drawing of the pile tighten 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:07.599
 hard 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.599
 on one side pines until it comes out 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.390
 exposed because 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.260
 it's a matter of placing the three 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:18.370
 screws 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.370
 of private operation
