in<00:00:22.439> my<00:00:23.100> ability<00:00:23.519> to<00:00:24.740> play<00:00:25.740> well<00:00:26.010> and<00:00:26.279> i<00:00:26.510> guess

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
in my ability to play well and i guess

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:37.400 
in my ability to play well and i guess
it's<00:00:27.689> okay<00:00:30.980> okay<00:00:31.980> but<00:00:32.040> not<00:00:32.250> great<00:00:36.380> anyway<00:00:37.380> I

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
it's okay okay but not great anyway I

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.700 
it's okay okay but not great anyway I
flat<00:00:37.890> they're<00:00:38.129> worth<00:00:38.840> six<00:00:39.840> is<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:40.410> I<00:00:42.230> think<00:00:43.230> oh

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
flat they're worth six is and I think oh

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.979 
flat they're worth six is and I think oh
I<00:00:44.129> check<00:00:44.489> back<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.760> fall<00:00:44.969> okay<00:00:45.350> um<00:00:47.989> this

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
I check back the fall okay um this

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.270 
I check back the fall okay um this
actually<00:00:49.320> got<00:00:49.620> interesting<00:00:50.070> because<00:00:50.160> I

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
actually got interesting because I

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.369 
actually got interesting because I
turned<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.520> nine<00:00:50.700> and<00:00:51.000> his<00:00:51.329> bets<00:00:51.570> are<00:00:51.719> probably

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
turned a nine and his bets are probably

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.380 
turned a nine and his bets are probably
really<00:00:52.590> weak<00:00:52.820> I<00:00:53.820> think<00:00:54.149> a<00:00:54.180> lot<00:00:54.270> of<00:00:54.329> people

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
really weak I think a lot of people

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.799 
really weak I think a lot of people
default<00:00:55.230> to<00:00:56.090> raising<00:00:57.090> here<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:57.600> I<00:00:57.629> think

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
default to raising here and I think

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.869 
default to raising here and I think
raising<00:00:58.260> is<00:00:58.350> fine<00:00:58.590> we<00:00:58.800> get<00:00:58.949> value<00:00:59.250> across<00:00:59.579> all

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
raising is fine we get value across all

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.720 
raising is fine we get value across all
the<00:01:00.030> time<00:01:00.410> we<00:01:01.410> rep<00:01:01.590> a<00:01:01.620> really<00:01:01.949> narrow<00:01:02.129> range<00:01:02.520> of

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
the time we rep a really narrow range of

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.560 
the time we rep a really narrow range of
value<00:01:03.629> hands<00:01:04.260> like<00:01:04.470> this<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:05.420> we're<00:01:06.420> going<00:01:06.540> to

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
value hands like this and we're going to

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.109 
value hands like this and we're going to
curiosity<00:01:06.990> positive<00:01:07.680> waters<00:01:08.010> range<00:01:08.250> if<00:01:08.909> he

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
curiosity positive waters range if he

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.270 
curiosity positive waters range if he
bits<00:01:09.299> larger<00:01:09.780> though<00:01:10.020> it's<00:01:10.619> a<00:01:10.710> spot<00:01:10.950> where<00:01:11.100> we

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
bits larger though it's a spot where we

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.539 
bits larger though it's a spot where we
rep<00:01:11.490> a<00:01:11.670> very<00:01:11.909> narrow<00:01:12.150> range<00:01:12.240> of<00:01:13.100> value<00:01:14.100> hands

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
rep a very narrow range of value hands

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.179 
rep a very narrow range of value hands
and<00:01:14.700> I<00:01:15.119> talked<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:15.960> little<00:01:16.110> bit<00:01:16.290> about<00:01:16.680> sort<00:01:17.070> of

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
and I talked a little bit about sort of

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.249 
and I talked a little bit about sort of
game<00:01:17.490> theory<00:01:17.790> optimal<00:01:18.330> well<00:01:18.900> balanced

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
game theory optimal well balanced

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.590 
game theory optimal well balanced
Rangers<00:01:19.710> earlier<00:01:20.100> wow<00:01:20.759> this<00:01:20.939> is<00:01:21.000> far<00:01:21.330> if<00:01:21.509> you

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
Rangers earlier wow this is far if you

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.200 
Rangers earlier wow this is far if you
bet<00:01:21.750> 200<00:01:22.200> I<00:01:22.259> probably<00:01:22.530> just<00:01:22.979> call<00:01:26.210> actually

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
bet 200 I probably just call actually

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.550 
bet 200 I probably just call actually
probably<00:01:27.540> not<00:01:27.750> i<00:01:27.780> gets<00:01:27.960> around<00:01:28.170> against

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
probably not i gets around against

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.340 
probably not i gets around against
around<00:01:28.829> my<00:01:28.950> poly<00:01:29.159> raise<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:30.170> expect<00:01:31.170> him<00:01:31.200> to

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
around my poly raise and expect him to

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.289 
around my poly raise and expect him to
not<00:01:31.530> fold<00:01:32.340> or<00:01:32.520> whatever<00:01:32.729> but<00:01:32.880> it's<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.060> spot

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
not fold or whatever but it's a spot

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.649 
not fold or whatever but it's a spot
where<00:01:34.729> i'm<00:01:35.729> not<00:01:35.970> going<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.150> have<00:01:36.270> much<00:01:36.450> of<00:01:36.509> a

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
where i'm not going to have much of a

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:37.910 
where i'm not going to have much of a
bluff<00:01:36.869> raising<00:01:37.290> range<00:01:37.439> when<00:01:37.590> he<00:01:37.650> bets<00:01:37.829> a

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
bluff raising range when he bets a

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.219 
bluff raising range when he bets a

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
normal size and against regular players

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.649 
normal size and against regular players
i<00:01:40.740> therefore<00:01:41.490> won't<00:01:41.880> have<00:01:42.180> not<00:01:42.390> much<00:01:42.509> of

i therefore won't have not much of

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:48.830 
i therefore won't have not much of
evaluation<00:01:43.350> range<00:01:43.500> either<00:01:47.329> but<00:01:48.329> when<00:01:48.600> he<00:01:48.659> bets

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
evaluation range either but when he bets

that i can probably reach the range so

that i can probably reach the range so
