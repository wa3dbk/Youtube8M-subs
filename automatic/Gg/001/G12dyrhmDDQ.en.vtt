of<00:01:01.909> the<00:01:02.059> gate<00:01:02.239> I<00:01:02.600> probably<00:01:03.260> should<00:01:03.469> have<00:01:03.559> been

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:03.769 
of the gate I probably should have been

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:08.020 
of the gate I probably should have been
a<00:01:03.920> little<00:01:04.100> more<00:01:04.759> gentle<00:01:05.750> with<00:01:05.810> it<00:01:05.960> and<00:01:07.030> when

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
a little more gentle with it and when

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.670 
a little more gentle with it and when

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:17.030 
that turbo kicked in it really just took
off<00:01:09.890> on<00:01:10.159> me

00:06:59.850 --> 00:06:59.860 
disaster I had a great time I'm going

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:01.740 
disaster I had a great time I'm going
home<00:06:59.979> I<00:07:00.160> thought<00:07:00.370> that<00:07:00.430> was<00:07:00.580> really<00:07:00.760> cool<00:07:00.880> we

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:01.750 
home I thought that was really cool we

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:09.300 
home I thought that was really cool we
should<00:07:01.900> probably<00:07:01.990> do<00:07:02.260> it<00:07:02.290> again<00:07:08.070> so<00:07:09.070> what<00:07:09.220> have

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:09.310 
should probably do it again so what have

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:12.629 
should probably do it again so what have
we<00:07:09.340> prove<00:07:09.729> it<00:07:09.940> well<00:07:10.720> not<00:07:11.110> much<00:07:11.350> really

00:07:12.629 --> 00:07:12.639 
we prove it well not much really

00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:14.790 
we prove it well not much really
four<00:07:13.240> wheel<00:07:13.449> drive<00:07:13.719> is<00:07:13.749> definitely<00:07:14.560> good<00:07:14.770> for

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:14.800 
four wheel drive is definitely good for

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.040 
four wheel drive is definitely good for
the<00:07:15.129> snow<00:07:15.400> but<00:07:16.300> the<00:07:16.389> type<00:07:16.569> of<00:07:16.599> players<00:07:16.930> that

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:17.050 
the snow but the type of players that

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:19.140 
the snow but the type of players that
you<00:07:17.349> have<00:07:17.530> it<00:07:18.129> just<00:07:18.280> as<00:07:18.460> important<00:07:18.969> if<00:07:19.120> not

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:19.150 
you have it just as important if not

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:24.209 
you have it just as important if not
more<00:07:19.360> so<00:07:20.849> one<00:07:21.849> wheel<00:07:22.090> drive<00:07:22.419> is<00:07:23.219> definitely

00:07:24.209 --> 00:07:24.219 
more so one wheel drive is definitely

00:07:24.219 --> 00:07:29.339 
more so one wheel drive is definitely
not<00:07:24.430> the<00:07:24.490> answer<00:07:25.919> and<00:07:27.029> of<00:07:28.029> course<00:07:28.139> if<00:07:29.139> you

00:07:29.339 --> 00:07:29.349 
not the answer and of course if you

00:07:29.349 --> 00:07:31.230 
not the answer and of course if you
really<00:07:29.620> want<00:07:29.860> to<00:07:29.919> do<00:07:30.129> well<00:07:30.159> you<00:07:30.849> get<00:07:30.999> four

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:31.240 
really want to do well you get four

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:33.390 
really want to do well you get four
wheel<00:07:31.449> drive<00:07:31.689> and<00:07:31.930> snow<00:07:32.349> tires<00:07:32.650> which<00:07:33.159> means

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:33.400 
wheel drive and snow tires which means

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:35.429 
wheel drive and snow tires which means
that<00:07:33.490> once<00:07:33.789> again<00:07:34.150> the<00:07:34.599> best<00:07:34.870> part<00:07:35.169> that<00:07:35.319> we

00:07:35.429 --> 00:07:35.439 
that once again the best part that we

00:07:35.439 --> 00:08:02.470 
that once again the best part that we
brought<00:07:35.680> was<00:07:36.340> the<00:07:36.490> camera

00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:02.480 

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:04.540 

you
