entirety<00:01:30.630> of<00:01:30.869> two<00:01:31.170> minutes<00:01:31.560> because<00:01:31.880> it<00:01:32.880> will

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
entirety of two minutes because it will

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.300 
entirety of two minutes because it will
go<00:01:33.479> choke<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.840> spire<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:34.380> hopefully<00:01:35.220> it

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
go choke the spire and hopefully it

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.980 
go choke the spire and hopefully it
forms<00:01:35.670> you'll<00:01:36.240> hear<00:01:36.540> a<00:01:36.570> very<00:01:36.840> particular

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
forms you'll hear a very particular

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.539 
forms you'll hear a very particular
noise<00:01:37.560> if<00:01:38.360> it<00:01:39.360> does<00:01:39.570> go<00:01:39.780> off<00:01:39.810> it<00:01:40.439> will<00:01:40.829> be<00:01:41.009> that

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
noise if it does go off it will be that

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.490 
noise if it does go off it will be that
and<00:01:41.790> then<00:01:41.880> you'll<00:01:42.030> like<00:01:43.020> you're<00:01:43.259> like<00:01:43.380> the

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
and then you'll like you're like the

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.960 
and then you'll like you're like the
spire<00:01:43.770> activating<00:01:44.340> nose<00:01:44.490> like<00:01:44.670> a<00:01:44.700> little

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
spire activating nose like a little

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.690 
spire activating nose like a little
pulse<00:01:45.240> of<00:01:45.450> like<00:01:45.689> wind<00:01:46.680> will<00:01:46.920> come<00:01:47.100> flying<00:01:47.340> at

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
pulse of like wind will come flying at

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.260 
pulse of like wind will come flying at
you<00:01:48.079> so<00:01:49.079> it<00:01:49.229> is<00:01:49.380> a<00:01:49.590> pretty<00:01:49.890> unique<00:01:50.009> glitch<00:01:50.610> it

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
you so it is a pretty unique glitch it

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.749 
you so it is a pretty unique glitch it
is<00:01:51.540> pretty<00:01:51.780> nice<00:01:52.049> to<00:01:52.380> know<00:01:52.500> they<00:01:53.310> can't<00:01:53.610> really

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
is pretty nice to know they can't really

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.300 
is pretty nice to know they can't really
patch<00:01:54.060> it<00:01:54.299> though<00:01:54.479> because<00:01:54.829> well<00:01:55.829> you<00:01:55.950> know<00:01:55.979> it

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
patch it though because well you know it

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.789 
patch it though because well you know it
sub<00:01:57.030> glitch<00:01:57.689> it's<00:01:57.960> a<00:01:58.110> glitch<00:01:58.409> that's<00:01:58.619> linked

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
sub glitch it's a glitch that's linked

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.550 
sub glitch it's a glitch that's linked
to<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.009> server<00:01:59.659> that's<00:02:00.659> how<00:02:00.750> destiny<00:02:00.990> runs<00:02:01.409> is

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
to the server that's how destiny runs is

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.550 
to the server that's how destiny runs is
that<00:02:01.860> each<00:02:02.009> area<00:02:02.250> has<00:02:02.369> a<00:02:02.579> server<00:02:03.409> when<00:02:04.409> you're

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
that each area has a server when you're

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.859 
that each area has a server when you're
say<00:02:05.040> playing<00:02:05.549> patrol<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:06.090> entire<00:02:06.360> map<00:02:06.630> is

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
say playing patrol the entire map is

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.169 
say playing patrol the entire map is
your<00:02:07.020> server<00:02:07.229> that's<00:02:07.619> your<00:02:07.890> entire<00:02:08.160> server

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
your server that's your entire server

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.339 
your server that's your entire server
boom<00:02:09.299> when<00:02:10.289> you're<00:02:10.409> doing<00:02:10.679> a<00:02:10.769> strike<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:11.879> game

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:12.349 
boom when you're doing a strike the game

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:14.869 
boom when you're doing a strike the game
makes<00:02:13.349> the<00:02:13.500> server<00:02:13.739> even<00:02:14.099> smaller<00:02:14.400> so<00:02:14.849> that

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:14.879 
makes the server even smaller so that

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:17.420 
makes the server even smaller so that
way<00:02:15.120> you<00:02:15.689> guys<00:02:15.840> get<00:02:16.170> a<00:02:16.290> less<00:02:16.530> laggy<00:02:16.799> experience

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
way you guys get a less laggy experience

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.190 
way you guys get a less laggy experience
so<00:02:17.640> you're<00:02:17.849> not<00:02:18.000> the<00:02:18.359> game's<00:02:18.629> not<00:02:18.810> trying<00:02:19.079> to

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
so you're not the game's not trying to

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.380 
so you're not the game's not trying to
render<00:02:19.439> the<00:02:19.680> entire<00:02:19.709> world<00:02:20.219> around<00:02:20.489> you<00:02:20.730> so

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
render the entire world around you so

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.610 
render the entire world around you so
when<00:02:21.540> you're<00:02:21.659> playing<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:22.319> vault<00:02:22.469> of<00:02:22.590> glass

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
when you're playing the vault of glass

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.949 
when you're playing the vault of glass
it's<00:02:22.980> rendering<00:02:23.340> the<00:02:23.879> area<00:02:24.420> for<00:02:24.659> the<00:02:24.780> raid

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
it's rendering the area for the raid

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.110 
it's rendering the area for the raid
that's<00:02:25.739> your<00:02:25.950> server<00:02:26.310> but<00:02:26.819> as<00:02:26.879> soon<00:02:26.969> as<00:02:27.060> you

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
that's your server but as soon as you

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.640 
that's your server but as soon as you
come<00:02:27.269> to<00:02:27.389> this<00:02:27.510> area<00:02:27.659> you're<00:02:28.049> breaking<00:02:28.439> out<00:02:28.620> of

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
come to this area you're breaking out of

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.259 
come to this area you're breaking out of
the<00:02:28.920> server<00:02:29.159> you're<00:02:29.489> pretty<00:02:29.730> much<00:02:29.760> forcing

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
the server you're pretty much forcing

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:32.660 
the server you're pretty much forcing
your<00:02:30.359> way<00:02:30.420> out<00:02:30.689> and<00:02:31.099> it's<00:02:32.099> causing<00:02:32.370> the<00:02:32.459> server

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
your way out and it's causing the server

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.720 
your way out and it's causing the server
to<00:02:32.939> pretty<00:02:33.420> much<00:02:33.540> make<00:02:34.099> the<00:02:35.099> spy<00:02:35.310> reform

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
to pretty much make the spy reform

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.069 
to pretty much make the spy reform
thinking<00:02:36.389> that<00:02:36.480> there's<00:02:36.629> three<00:02:36.810> people

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:37.079 
thinking that there's three people

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:38.720 
thinking that there's three people
standing<00:02:37.260> on<00:02:37.409> the<00:02:37.530> sink<00:02:37.709> plates<00:02:37.920> with<00:02:38.129> nobody

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
standing on the sink plates with nobody

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.690 
standing on the sink plates with nobody
there<00:02:39.200> so<00:02:40.200> that's<00:02:40.379> pretty<00:02:40.709> much<00:02:40.950> how<00:02:41.280> you<00:02:41.310> push

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
there so that's pretty much how you push

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.490 
there so that's pretty much how you push
through<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:42.120> door<00:02:42.419> and<00:02:42.689> then<00:02:43.319> there's<00:02:43.439> a

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
through the door and then there's a

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.599 
through the door and then there's a
particular<00:02:43.620> but<00:02:44.010> you<00:02:44.099> have<00:02:44.220> to<00:02:44.280> do<00:02:44.370> to<00:02:44.519> get

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:44.609 
particular but you have to do to get

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:46.789 
particular but you have to do to get
through<00:02:44.879> the<00:02:45.060> door<00:02:45.209> which<00:02:46.139> they<00:02:46.379> can't<00:02:46.590> pass

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
through the door which they can't pass

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:48.319 
through the door which they can't pass
without<00:02:47.040> retooling<00:02:47.519> the<00:02:47.700> entire<00:02:48.000> engine

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:48.329 
without retooling the entire engine

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:50.300 
without retooling the entire engine
because<00:02:49.019> destiny<00:02:49.230> is<00:02:49.500> weird<00:02:49.739> it's<00:02:49.980> linked<00:02:50.250> to
