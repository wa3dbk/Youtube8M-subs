the motor went through it and then got

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.379 
the motor went through it and then got
tired<00:04:30.470> of<00:04:30.710> that<00:04:30.830> the<00:04:31.460> reason<00:04:31.820> I<00:04:31.940> did<00:04:32.180> it<00:04:32.300> is

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:32.389 
tired of that the reason I did it is

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:34.450 
tired of that the reason I did it is
because<00:04:32.450> I<00:04:32.780> had<00:04:32.990> a<00:04:33.020> vision<00:04:33.260> I<00:04:33.650> guess<00:04:33.860> I've

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 
because I had a vision I guess I've

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.580 
because I had a vision I guess I've
always<00:04:34.790> have<00:04:35.180> enough<00:04:35.419> a<00:04:35.660> car<00:04:36.080> was<00:04:36.260> a<00:04:36.290> blown

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
always have enough a car was a blown

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.920 
always have enough a car was a blown
motor<00:04:36.620> with<00:04:37.130> it<00:04:37.250> and<00:04:37.370> I<00:04:37.430> figured<00:04:37.490> well<00:04:37.900> why<00:04:38.900> not

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
motor with it and I figured well why not

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.409 
motor with it and I figured well why not
a<00:04:39.110> Cadillac<00:04:39.370> because<00:04:40.370> you<00:04:40.639> don't<00:04:40.880> see<00:04:41.150> a<00:04:41.180> lot

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:41.419 
a Cadillac because you don't see a lot

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:44.320 
a Cadillac because you don't see a lot
of<00:04:41.450> them<00:04:41.630> and<00:04:42.220> the<00:04:43.220> horsepower<00:04:43.460> was<00:04:43.910> great<00:04:44.150> for

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
of them and the horsepower was great for

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.870 
of them and the horsepower was great for
the<00:04:44.389> car<00:04:44.600> and<00:04:44.930> it<00:04:45.290> looks<00:04:45.470> good<00:04:45.680> and<00:04:46.040> I<00:04:46.790> don't

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 
the car and it looks good and I don't

00:04:46.880 --> 00:05:07.119 
the car and it looks good and I don't
think<00:04:47.150> I<00:04:47.210> could<00:04:47.389> have<00:04:47.479> been<00:04:47.540> a<00:04:47.600> better<00:04:47.780> choice
