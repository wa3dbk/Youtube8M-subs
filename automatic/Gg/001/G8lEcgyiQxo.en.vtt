 come on 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.800
 Brands at the end of the year and come 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.720
 bringing a more mature interface something 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.340
 which was a natural evolution 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.180
 this was the first community of 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:12.190
 Minecraft of Brazil and for this reason 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.770
 she was the gateway to much 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:17.650
 people known today on youtube by 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.790
 example monark government extreme between 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.710
 others 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.380
 this whole group started betting on the 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.210
 your videos on minecraft br also that 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.590
 became the meeting point for you 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.590
 advertise your videos 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:32.320
 thinking about it, we have created an option in 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.930
 esteem call send videos in which 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.720
 you can put the link of your video from 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.610
 youtube and thus spread to the whole 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.100
 the Brazilian community in a way that 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.229
 easy and you can interact with others 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.310
 users as you are in the 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:49.090
 videos and everything else 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.310
 all users who are already 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.710
 will have this option crushed 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:59.860
 So do not wait, so go and send it. 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:02:03.460
 Your video from the videocast I'll try to bring 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:08.850
 a map made by the community and this is the 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.850
 video in question very interesting 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:15.989
 the map that I want to bring to you 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.629
 now is the user map the pike 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:20.400
 he made a very well-designed map for 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:22.680
 they want to lose parkour 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.900
 I'm such a disaster that you 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.760
 need to skip to complete goals 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.409
 so if you are also this map was 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.230
 Made for you, why not? 

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:33.569
 this map is composed of several rooms and 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.329
 for you to move to the next room without 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:38.939
 achieve some goals and each 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:41.250
 The goal is to put a book to the 

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:44.639
 explain which technique you need 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.920
 to pass this particular step 

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:48.989
 this is the normal leap you have 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.730
 that skipping only one interesting block is 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:52.799
 When are you going to next? 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.920
 in the next phase the next part he already 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:03:00.750
 puts a major new point will have 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:05.189
 a chest with new tips explaining what is 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:10.260
 the second challenge of the first knots 

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:12.599
 we jumped 11 and in the second we ran as before 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.480
 but do not always run where a tip where 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:17.400
 until the opening date to the door 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.949
 then in this second step of the 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:23.930
 challenge we will not run yet we 

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:23.930
 Let's jump from edge to edge. 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:30.389
 without much mystery 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:31.650
 Until then, it's okay here. 

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:35.430
 complicate a little 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.880
 the museum that says the book of the third 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.640
 challenge 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.530
 the kingdom to survive now for 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.770
 get very good you will have to run 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:46.270
 plus you hold and jumping jumping 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:48.430
 by exactly 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:50.710
 then the purpose of this room to explain 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.690
 how to circle and as soon as you fall in 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:57.310
 block c and jump or lose time 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:04:00.310
 so you maintain a very good pace 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:02.220
 of course there are several rooms 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.930
 map each a different challenge 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.000
 explaining you have your methods and with 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.100
 sure will help you pass potatoes 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.260
 for healing and more complex 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.780
 so congratulations to the user on the picnic 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.940
 for this map 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.370
 We'll soon make another one. 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.709
 video showing other maps and death 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.510
