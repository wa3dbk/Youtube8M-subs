00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
but maybe in 50 bucks they price it at

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.080 
but maybe in 50 bucks they price it at
that<00:04:29.919> range<00:04:30.220> it's<00:04:30.460> going<00:04:30.580> to<00:04:30.639> be<00:04:30.729> pretty<00:04:30.880> much

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
that range it's going to be pretty much

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.210

a<00:04:31.120> steal<00:04:31.510> at<00:04:31.750> that<00:04:32.080> level<00:04:32.289> but<00:04:32.500> right<00:04:32.800> now<00:04:32.979> it's

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
a steal at that level but right now it's

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:34.980 
a steal at that level but right now it's

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990
