00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.429
 very good evening welcome to this 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.799
 new video new video that is a one 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:18.590
 boxing although unboxing has little 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:20.490
 because unfortunately the 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:24.240
 content 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.220
 I tell you a package has arrived that is 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.039
 they have also imported us I have the look 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.430
 down here has fallen to the ground 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:35.640
 because it would get the package 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.900
 problems as always my camera 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.910
 it's a tocahuevos and it does not let me 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.560
 live quiet so nothing I have 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:46.079
 to lower the resolution a little bit already 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:49.350
 see how it looks I hope it does not get caught 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.519
 of elevation that also looks at me I'm 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.399
 watching on the screen have 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:58.469
 I'm scratching a little bit to see 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:01:04.019
 well the common huila up here serious or 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:06.840
 be serious I bought Monday yesterday for the 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:10.770
 Tomorrow he tells me with the assassin's 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:14.670
 believe 4 and you have enrolled 3 both in 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.380
 game for 38 with 90 I have here I am 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.550
 prepared 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.070
 to see if it looks 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:24.340
 38 with 90 a highly recommended purchase if 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:26.410
 you do not have it and if you like it is that if you 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.660
 like the series as such we are great 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:29.500
 fans I guess you'll have it for 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.750
 other platforms 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:35.290
 but good for this platform I 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:37.800
 I wanted to because paraguay did not want me 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.870
 do with him on playstation 3 because 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:43.780
 playstation3 right now I have it 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:45.970
 dead good dead in what I do is 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.860
 I'm playing little by little very little 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.960
 a little bit of the games that come in 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.880
 precision plus something more than recommended 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.050
 also although it is a channel to understand or 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.750
 well, I also recommend that if 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:02:00.340
 you have a playstation plus you have it 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:03.100
 with a playstation 34 orbit you have it 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.870
 with playstation plus so good 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.240
 more than a boxing to show you what 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:08.980
 it came in each of the two and little thing 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.119
 better let's start with the 

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:12.119
 assassin's creed 3 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.860
 good as you see 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:21.340
 this is the first impression that what 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:24.580
 first you find yourself place it such 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:27.080
 which came the valuable placed came with 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:31.600
 the nintendo points 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.600
 as always he came with 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.120
 the play 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:40.120
 or play the platform the application of 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.740
 ubisoft that I think is also started 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.890
 but good that we have her in 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:49.730
 hui and good train has rewards and 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:53.210
 you can give you the option to block 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:55.910
 certain costumes or weapons like for example 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:58.550
 in the ankle in this I do not know I do not know that 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:01.070
 I lend you I do not know what you can download 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:03.190
 here I do not know I do not know what he's going to give you but 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:06.760
 good 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:10.420
 that comes from a torch atocha guide 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.440
 you're saying they hold fat that 's 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.780
 normal 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.950
 the goal is so fat that we're going or 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.770
 be 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.740
 this is that it is not a folio or it is 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:22.800
 a slop 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:24.630
 good what matters is the game 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.100
 does not have 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:29.370
 I think this does not come with any 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.660
 type of additional content gives equally 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.910
 I have been told that the game has 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.880
 the odd book 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:38.490
 but good to throw a ratillo and 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:40.170
 pass it to me are nine euros ten euros and 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:44.980
 one more purchase that is recommended 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:46.989
 second is assassin's creed 4 black flag 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:50.799
 well the cover surprised me 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:53.440
 very much because it has some oslo tones 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:55.569
 to teach a little like that so you see 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.709
 I do not know if you see it but the sword 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:58.709
 example that is a silvery tone 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.970
 it's like bright is not the edition 

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:05.650
 special here you see it to see if it looks 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.319
 special edition as an edition 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.739
 special contains 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:14.680
 a mission for the individual mode 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:17.709
 secrets of sacrifice and the legacy of 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:20.130
 captain keane way suit and weapon or whatever 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.130
 good for 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:28.060
 to be will have a content 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:29.830
 additional sometimes does not have anything then 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.800
 well at least here in the game 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:35.219
 they already put it with something that is appreciated 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.219
 this is the 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:42.020
 there is the cd sorry, I'm going to 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:43.400
 teach the back because it is that 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:49.280
 the back of both games for 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:51.530
 that I take it are almost identical 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.270
 almost identical by not saying in one put 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:57.130
 rebellion and in another challenge the early 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:57.130
 that is a copy-paste and lying 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:02.800
 the game that already taught points 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:02.800
 Nintendo 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:06.940
 this guide that already becomes a little 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:10.180
 more than one folio 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:12.700
 long but that is not a guide the guide 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.900
 it's around here that comes to me has 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:15.550
 done a lot of grace when I saw it 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:18.820
 before in the video that you recorded before and 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:20.200
 that unfortunately in my theater camera I 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:23.250
 has given what you will not see in a 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:26.430
 boxing as such but teaching 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:26.430
 well look 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:34.640
 I read what's docs hack is our 

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:37.940
 precious weapon the next generation of 

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:40.510
 open world games will arrive on 21 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:42.770
 November of 2013 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:45.600
 Carlos or 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:47.070
 touch earthy 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:50.430
 so you can see what I'm saying 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:53.490
 it makes some sense 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:57.170
 because I have Parkinson's because of what I see 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:59.430
 that I climb there you see November 21 

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:02.040
 I do not know when to package this game 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:03.870
 the truth let's say you have to carry 

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:05.100
 time this is already expired me the 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:08.130
