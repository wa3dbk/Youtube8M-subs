there<00:01:52.590> you<00:01:52.619> go<00:01:53.240> so<00:01:54.259> my<00:01:55.340> the<00:01:56.340> other<00:01:56.490> one<00:01:56.670> I<00:01:56.700> have

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
there you go so my the other one I have

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.100 
there you go so my the other one I have
is<00:01:58.070> unfortunately<00:01:59.070> packed<00:01:59.960> because<00:02:00.960> I'm

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
is unfortunately packed because I'm

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.190 
is unfortunately packed because I'm
moving<00:02:01.560> I<00:02:01.710> just<00:02:01.740> bought<00:02:02.040> a<00:02:02.070> house<00:02:02.250> yay

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:06.439 
so I can't really compare them but

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:08.479 
so I can't really compare them but
essentially<00:02:07.439> the<00:02:07.619> only<00:02:07.649> difference<00:02:08.310> between

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
essentially the only difference between

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.690 
essentially the only difference between
the<00:02:08.879> standard<00:02:09.450> version<00:02:09.840> and<00:02:10.110> this<00:02:10.860> version<00:02:11.160> I

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
the standard version and this version I

the standard version and this version I
believe

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
believe

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.200
