00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
going to see step by step how we take

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.050 
going to see step by step how we take
real<00:02:11.390> hinge<00:02:11.989> right<00:02:12.890> out<00:02:13.160> of<00:02:13.190> the<00:02:13.430> hymnal<00:02:13.880> and

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
complicated music theory seen be so if

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.650 
complicated music theory seen be so if
you're<00:02:25.220> simply<00:02:25.549> just<00:02:25.730> looking<00:02:26.000> for<00:02:26.209> a<00:02:26.239> show

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
keyboard then you're in the wrong place

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.680 
keyboard then you're in the wrong place
but<00:02:31.160> if<00:02:31.280> you<00:02:31.370> want<00:02:31.549> to<00:02:31.580> take<00:02:31.760> your<00:02:31.880> music<00:02:32.299> the

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
theory and how it's done and we've got

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.949 
theory and how it's done and we've got
the<00:02:37.340> court<00:02:37.610> to<00:02:37.730> do<00:02:37.880> it<00:02:38.000> with<00:02:38.150> then<00:02:38.630> you're<00:02:38.870> in
