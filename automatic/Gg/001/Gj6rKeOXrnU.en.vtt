00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.359 
again that that footwork is the same
that's<00:01:06.780> very<00:01:07.049> key<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.619> very<00:01:07.710> crucial<00:01:08.189> for<00:01:08.310> you

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
that's very key and very crucial for you

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:09.920 
that's very key and very crucial for you
being<00:01:08.520> effective<00:01:09.060> so<00:01:09.240> here's<00:01:09.420> a<00:01:09.510> couple<00:01:09.630> quick

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
being effective so here's a couple quick

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.390 
being effective so here's a couple quick
clips<00:01:10.200> of<00:01:10.350> me<00:01:10.439> doing<00:01:10.590> it<00:01:10.770> full<00:01:10.979> speed<00:01:11.159> so<00:01:11.369> you

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
clips of me doing it full speed so you

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.590 
clips of me doing it full speed so you
can<00:01:11.580> see<00:01:11.760> what<00:01:11.880> it<00:01:11.970> should<00:01:12.119> look<00:01:12.240> like<00:01:12.299> with

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
can see what it should look like with

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.750 
can see what it should look like with
the<00:01:12.720> footwork<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.619> speed<00:01:13.979> all<00:01:14.220> that<00:01:14.549> and

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
the footwork the speed all that and

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.370 
the footwork the speed all that and
attacking<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.210> rim<00:01:15.299> hard<00:01:15.600> getting<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.229> the

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
attacking the rim hard getting to the

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.840 
attacking the rim hard getting to the
rim<00:01:16.560> as<00:01:16.710> quickly<00:01:16.950> as<00:01:17.130> possible<00:01:17.159> from<00:01:17.640> that

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
rim as quickly as possible from that

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.609 
rim as quickly as possible from that
crossover<00:01:18.210> dribble<00:01:18.630> and<00:01:18.780> then<00:01:18.960> finally<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.470> do

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
crossover dribble and then finally to do

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.140 
crossover dribble and then finally to do
it<00:01:19.740> on<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.040> move<00:01:20.280> it's<00:01:20.490> again<00:01:20.850> going<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.090> be

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
it on the move it's again going to be

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.520 
it on the move it's again going to be
almost<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.570> same<00:01:21.630> footwork<00:01:22.170> you're<00:01:22.409> just

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
almost the same footwork you're just

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.320 
almost the same footwork you're just
going<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:22.680> do<00:01:22.860> it<00:01:22.979> from<00:01:23.100> a<00:01:23.280> run<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:23.759> instead<00:01:24.270> of

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
going to do it from a run and instead of

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.670 
going to do it from a run and instead of
starting<00:01:24.540> from<00:01:24.659> a<00:01:24.840> standstill<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.380> doing<00:01:25.619> a

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
starting from a standstill and doing a

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.170 
starting from a standstill and doing a
jab<00:01:25.920> you<00:01:26.100> want<00:01:26.250> to<00:01:26.310> make<00:01:26.430> sure<00:01:26.580> from<00:01:26.729> that<00:01:26.909> run

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
jab you want to make sure from that run

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.999 
jab you want to make sure from that run
that<00:01:27.600> you're<00:01:27.750> making<00:01:28.110> that<00:01:28.229> jab<00:01:28.560> step<00:01:28.860> with

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
that you're making that jab step with

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.679 
that you're making that jab step with
that<00:01:29.159> outside<00:01:29.640> foot<00:01:29.670> whichever<00:01:30.270> hand<00:01:30.570> is

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
that outside foot whichever hand is

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.960 
that outside foot whichever hand is
dribbling<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.079> basketball<00:01:31.259> and<00:01:31.920> then<00:01:32.520> taking

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
dribbling the basketball and then taking

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.340 
dribbling the basketball and then taking
that<00:01:33.000> first<00:01:33.299> step<00:01:33.420> with<00:01:33.689> that<00:01:33.720> foot<00:01:34.049> as<00:01:34.140> well

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
that first step with that foot as well

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.350 
that first step with that foot as well
so<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.770> fork<00:01:35.009> is<00:01:35.220> pretty<00:01:35.460> much<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.820> same<00:01:36.060> but

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
so the fork is pretty much the same but

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.219 
so the fork is pretty much the same but
once<00:01:36.479> again<00:01:36.600> you<00:01:36.750> want<00:01:36.869> to<00:01:36.930> make<00:01:37.020> sure<00:01:37.049> that

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
once again you want to make sure that

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.690 
once again you want to make sure that
last<00:01:37.500> step<00:01:37.799> before<00:01:37.920> you<00:01:38.189> make<00:01:38.340> that<00:01:38.520> change

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
last step before you make that change

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.760 
last step before you make that change
direction<00:01:39.119> is<00:01:39.390> with<00:01:39.659> that<00:01:39.810> outside<00:01:40.259> foot<00:01:40.619> the

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
direction is with that outside foot the

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.200 
direction is with that outside foot the
hand<00:01:40.979> that's<00:01:41.100> dribbling<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.490> basketball<00:01:41.670> so

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
hand that's dribbling the basketball so

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.940 
hand that's dribbling the basketball so
you're<00:01:42.329> really<00:01:42.540> selling<00:01:42.990> that<00:01:43.110> fake<00:01:43.470> so<00:01:43.860> if

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
you're really selling that fake so if

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.080 
you're really selling that fake so if
