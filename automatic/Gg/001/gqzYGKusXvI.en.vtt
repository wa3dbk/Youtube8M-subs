having its chicks this bird embarks on a
courageous<00:00:22.259> and<00:00:22.700> Herculean<00:00:23.700> migration<00:00:24.980> how

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
courageous and Herculean migration how

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.940 
courageous and Herculean migration how
does<00:00:26.130> evolution<00:00:26.279> explain<00:00:27.090> how<00:00:27.599> a<00:00:28.079> migratory

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:28.950 
does evolution explain how a migratory

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:31.790 
does evolution explain how a migratory
animal<00:00:29.669> gets<00:00:30.210> from<00:00:30.570> where<00:00:31.320> he<00:00:31.410> is<00:00:31.439> in<00:00:31.680> this

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
animal gets from where he is in this

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.520 
animal gets from where he is in this
summer<00:00:32.099> to<00:00:32.430> where<00:00:32.579> he<00:00:32.700> is<00:00:32.820> in<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.239> winter

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
summer to where he is in the winter

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.830 
summer to where he is in the winter
usually<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.920> explanation<00:00:35.550> is<00:00:35.820> you<00:00:36.360> have<00:00:36.660> this

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
usually the explanation is you have this

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.080 
usually the explanation is you have this
certain<00:00:37.050> kind<00:00:37.170> of<00:00:37.350> bird<00:00:37.590> and<00:00:37.860> he<00:00:38.489> grows<00:00:38.820> in

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
certain kind of bird and he grows in

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.689 
certain kind of bird and he grows in
Texas<00:00:39.539> and<00:00:39.840> then<00:00:40.379> one<00:00:40.710> winter<00:00:41.070> Texas<00:00:41.519> is<00:00:41.670> a

00:00:41.689 --> 00:00:41.699 
Texas and then one winter Texas is a

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:43.310 
Texas and then one winter Texas is a
cold<00:00:41.969> winter<00:00:42.300> so<00:00:42.600> he<00:00:42.750> decides<00:00:43.079> you<00:00:43.289> know

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
cold winter so he decides you know

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.740 
cold winter so he decides you know
something<00:00:43.800> I'm<00:00:44.070> heading<00:00:44.370> for<00:00:44.399> Mexico<00:00:44.609> so<00:00:45.600> he

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
something I'm heading for Mexico so he

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.959 
something I'm heading for Mexico so he
flies<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.019> few<00:00:46.949> hundred<00:00:47.190> miles<00:00:47.339> south<00:00:47.550> and

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
flies a few hundred miles south and

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.090 
flies a few hundred miles south and
that's<00:00:48.059> a<00:00:48.359> little<00:00:48.570> nicer<00:00:48.839> down<00:00:48.989> here<00:00:49.289> and<00:00:49.469> then

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
that's a little nicer down here and then

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.220 
that's a little nicer down here and then
it<00:00:50.219> comes<00:00:50.370> back<00:00:50.460> to<00:00:50.640> Texas<00:00:51.390> in<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.690> summer<00:00:51.719> but

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
it comes back to Texas in the summer but

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.689 
it comes back to Texas in the summer but
it's<00:00:52.379> an<00:00:52.499> especially<00:00:53.010> hot<00:00:53.160> summer

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
it's an especially hot summer

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.160 
it's an especially hot summer
so<00:00:53.910> he's<00:00:54.120> decides<00:00:54.480> you<00:00:54.600> know<00:00:54.690> I<00:00:54.719> think<00:00:54.899> I'm

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
so he's decides you know I think I'm

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.259 
so he's decides you know I think I'm
gonna<00:00:55.320> go<00:00:55.499> to<00:00:55.589> Kansas<00:00:55.980> so<00:00:56.640> he<00:00:56.760> flies<00:00:56.940> north

00:00:57.259 --> 00:00:57.269 
gonna go to Kansas so he flies north

00:00:57.269 --> 00:00:58.610 
gonna go to Kansas so he flies north
looking<00:00:57.449> for<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:57.719> little<00:00:57.899> cooler<00:00:58.079> weather<00:00:58.320> and

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
looking for a little cooler weather and

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.259 
looking for a little cooler weather and
then<00:00:59.159> each<00:00:59.399> year<00:00:59.699> he<00:00:59.850> might<00:01:00.030> go<00:01:00.179> a<00:01:00.210> little

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:00.269 
then each year he might go a little

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:01.520 
then each year he might go a little
further<00:01:00.600> south<00:01:00.870> a<00:01:01.050> little<00:01:01.260> further<00:01:01.409> north

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
further south a little further north

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.290 
further south a little further north
until<00:01:02.249> they<00:01:02.519> get<00:01:02.609> all<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.909> way<00:01:02.940> up<00:01:03.089> to<00:01:03.210> the

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
until they get all the way up to the

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.670 
until they get all the way up to the
Arctic<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:03.719> all<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.110> way<00:01:04.199> down<00:01:04.350> in<00:01:04.500> South

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
Arctic and all the way down in South

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.610 
Arctic and all the way down in South
America<00:01:05.030> well<00:01:06.030> this<00:01:06.600> little<00:01:06.720> bird<00:01:07.020> breaks

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:07.620 
America well this little bird breaks

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.649 
America well this little bird breaks
that<00:01:07.830> rule<00:01:08.040> first<00:01:08.700> of<00:01:08.850> all<00:01:08.940> it's<00:01:09.120> a<00:01:09.210> very<00:01:09.390> small

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
that rule first of all it's a very small

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.679 
that rule first of all it's a very small
bird<00:01:09.900> about<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.470> size<00:01:10.710> of<00:01:11.009> a<00:01:11.070> dove<00:01:11.579> and<00:01:11.939> it's

not a swimmer and it lives up in the
Arctic<00:01:15.210> in<00:01:15.750> Alaska<00:01:16.290> actually<00:01:16.680> they<00:01:17.340> leave

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
Arctic in Alaska actually they leave

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.840 
Arctic in Alaska actually they leave
their<00:01:17.850> young<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.329> then<00:01:18.750> fly<00:01:19.200> to<00:01:19.799> Hawaii<00:01:19.920> for

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850

their young and then fly to Hawaii for
the<00:01:20.970> winter<00:01:21.560> now<00:01:22.560> when<00:01:23.399> it<00:01:23.610> leaves<00:01:24.170> Alaska<00:01:25.170> it

00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:25.469 
the winter now when it leaves Alaska it

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:28.310 
the winter now when it leaves Alaska it
has<00:01:25.740> an<00:01:25.890> 88<00:01:26.369> hour<00:01:26.579> flight<00:01:26.969> non-stop<00:01:27.780> because

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
has an 88 hour flight non-stop because

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.039 
has an 88 hour flight non-stop because
there's<00:01:28.500> no<00:01:28.649> land<00:01:28.860> in<00:01:29.070> between<00:01:29.460> 3<00:01:30.270> days<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:30.750> 4

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
there's no land in between 3 days and 4

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.550 
there's no land in between 3 days and 4
nights<00:01:31.640> non-stop<00:01:32.640> how<00:01:33.570> does<00:01:33.750> it<00:01:33.840> do<00:01:34.049> that<00:01:34.079> well

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
nights non-stop how does it do that well

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.490 
nights non-stop how does it do that well
these<00:01:35.520> little<00:01:35.789> birds<00:01:35.969> begin<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:37.049> eat<00:01:37.229> a<00:01:37.259> lot

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
these little birds begin to eat a lot

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.260 
these little birds begin to eat a lot
and<00:01:37.740> they<00:01:38.490> gain<00:01:38.759> about<00:01:39.180> 70<00:01:39.930> grams<00:01:40.259> of<00:01:41.270> burnable

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
and they gain about 70 grams of burnable

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.289 
and they gain about 70 grams of burnable
energy<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:43.530> here's<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:43.890> problem<00:01:44.280> we<00:01:45.000> got<00:01:45.119> an

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
energy and here's the problem we got an

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.620 
energy and here's the problem we got an
88<00:01:45.750> hour<00:01:45.990> flight<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:46.530> they<00:01:47.430> burn<00:01:47.640> right<00:01:48.119> at<00:01:48.360> 1

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
88 hour flight and they burn right at 1

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.230 
88 hour flight and they burn right at 1
gram<00:01:48.930> per<00:01:49.259> hour<00:01:49.549> well<00:01:50.549> that<00:01:50.700> only<00:01:50.820> gives<00:01:51.119> them

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
gram per hour well that only gives them

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.779 
gram per hour well that only gives them
70<00:01:51.750> hours<00:01:52.109> worth<00:01:52.320> of<00:01:52.619> fuel<00:01:52.979> so<00:01:53.520> they're<00:01:53.670> gonna

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:53.789 
70 hours worth of fuel so they're gonna

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:55.999 
70 hours worth of fuel so they're gonna
drop<00:01:54.060> into<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.420> ocean<00:01:54.780> as<00:01:54.930> non-swimmers<00:01:55.859> a

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
drop into the ocean as non-swimmers a

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.359 
drop into the ocean as non-swimmers a
few<00:01:56.549> hours<00:01:56.700> short<00:01:57.180> of<00:01:57.390> Hawaii<00:01:58.100> well<00:01:59.100> then<00:01:59.219> how

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
few hours short of Hawaii well then how

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.670 
few hours short of Hawaii well then how
do<00:01:59.430> they<00:01:59.609> get<00:01:59.729> there<00:01:59.939> well<00:02:00.479> because<00:02:00.899> God<00:02:00.990> made

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
do they get there well because God made

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.340 
do they get there well because God made
them<00:02:01.920> so<00:02:02.130> they<00:02:02.280> fly<00:02:02.520> in<00:02:02.789> formation<00:02:03.119> and<00:02:03.600> they

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
them so they fly in formation and they

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.800 
them so they fly in formation and they
alternate<00:02:05.159> leaders<00:02:05.729> and<00:02:05.969> so<00:02:06.179> they<00:02:06.299> break<00:02:06.539> the

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
alternate leaders and so they break the

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.540 
alternate leaders and so they break the
airwaves<00:02:07.289> there<00:02:07.560> so<00:02:07.799> it<00:02:07.890> makes<00:02:08.100> it<00:02:08.190> easy<00:02:08.340> like

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
airwaves there so it makes it easy like

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.780 
airwaves there so it makes it easy like
geese<00:02:08.789> fly<00:02:09.119> information<00:02:09.780> and<00:02:10.140> that<00:02:11.039> cuts<00:02:11.700> the

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
geese fly information and that cuts the

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.790 
geese fly information and that cuts the
energy<00:02:12.210> that<00:02:12.510> it<00:02:12.630> takes<00:02:12.660> to<00:02:12.930> fly<00:02:13.170> it's<00:02:13.560> not

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
energy that it takes to fly it's not

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.800 
energy that it takes to fly it's not
uncommon<00:02:14.220> for<00:02:14.400> Birds<00:02:14.910> of<00:02:15.120> that<00:02:15.300> size

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
uncommon for Birds of that size

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.440 
uncommon for Birds of that size
to<00:02:15.870> lose<00:02:16.080> 50%<00:02:16.620> of<00:02:17.250> their<00:02:17.400> total<00:02:17.730> body<00:02:18.060> weight

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
to lose 50% of their total body weight

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.020 
to lose 50% of their total body weight
and<00:02:18.690> that's<00:02:19.440> fat<00:02:19.890> being<00:02:20.220> burned<00:02:20.520> up<00:02:20.760> along

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
and that's fat being burned up along

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.850 
and that's fat being burned up along
their<00:02:21.209> migration<00:02:21.750> routes<00:02:21.900> it's<00:02:22.680> an

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
their migration routes it's an

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.550 
their migration routes it's an
incredible<00:02:23.520> feat<00:02:23.880> if<00:02:24.540> you<00:02:24.750> can<00:02:24.900> imagine<00:02:25.140> a

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
incredible feat if you can imagine a

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.790 
incredible feat if you can imagine a
hundred<00:02:26.130> pound<00:02:26.370> human<00:02:26.849> losing<00:02:27.690> 50<00:02:28.140> pounds<00:02:28.170> in

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
hundred pound human losing 50 pounds in

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.490 
hundred pound human losing 50 pounds in
a<00:02:29.310> five-day<00:02:29.790> period<00:02:29.819> as<00:02:30.510> they<00:02:31.050> traveled

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
a five-day period as they traveled

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.770 
a five-day period as they traveled
across<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:32.459> world<00:02:32.790> and<00:02:33.060> this<00:02:33.239> is<00:02:33.540> just

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
across the world and this is just

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.470 
across the world and this is just
something<00:02:33.959> that<00:02:34.140> mammals<00:02:35.069> can't<00:02:35.340> do<00:02:35.550> and<00:02:35.880> so

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
something that mammals can't do and so

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.320 
something that mammals can't do and so
only<00:02:37.170> God<00:02:37.530> could<00:02:37.830> do<00:02:38.010> that<00:02:38.220> because<00:02:38.970> the

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
only God could do that because the

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.390 
only God could do that because the
evolutionary<00:02:39.959> explanation<00:02:40.590> doesn't<00:02:41.160> fit

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
evolutionary explanation doesn't fit

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.440 
evolutionary explanation doesn't fit
because<00:02:41.519> there's<00:02:41.790> no<00:02:41.910> way<00:02:42.030> that<00:02:42.150> could<00:02:42.300> go<00:02:42.420> a

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
because there's no way that could go a

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:43.759 
because there's no way that could go a
little<00:02:42.660> bit<00:02:42.870> each<00:02:43.110> year<00:02:43.410> a<00:02:43.500> little<00:02:43.620> bit

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
little bit each year a little bit

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:46.490 
little bit each year a little bit
further<00:02:44.069> south<00:02:44.340> plop<00:02:44.730> their<00:02:45.030> fish<00:02:45.420> bait<00:02:45.810> okay

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
further south plop their fish bait okay

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.410 
further south plop their fish bait okay
so<00:02:46.560> they<00:02:46.769> can't<00:02:46.950> do<00:02:47.069> it<00:02:47.220> so<00:02:47.790> the<00:02:47.940> evolutionary

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
so they can't do it so the evolutionary

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.699 
so they can't do it so the evolutionary
explanation<00:02:49.019> doesn't<00:02:49.230> work<00:02:49.440> on<00:02:49.650> them<00:02:51.709> there

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
explanation doesn't work on them there

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.229 
explanation doesn't work on them there
is<00:02:52.830> another<00:02:53.069> interesting<00:02:53.310> thing<00:02:53.670> and<00:02:53.940> that<00:02:54.030> is

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
is another interesting thing and that is

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.930 
is another interesting thing and that is
that<00:02:54.900> the<00:02:55.110> parents<00:02:55.530> have<00:02:55.680> their<00:02:56.100> eggs<00:02:56.340> and<00:02:56.640> the

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
that the parents have their eggs and the

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.059 
that the parents have their eggs and the
babies<00:02:57.299> hatch<00:02:57.510> but<00:02:57.989> then<00:02:58.200> the<00:02:58.319> parents<00:02:58.709> fly<00:02:59.010> to

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
babies hatch but then the parents fly to

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:03.080 
babies hatch but then the parents fly to
Hawaii<00:02:59.810> now<00:03:00.810> the<00:03:00.870> younger<00:03:01.319> here<00:03:01.590> and<00:03:02.090> they're

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
Hawaii now the younger here and they're

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.660 
Hawaii now the younger here and they're
gonna<00:03:03.239> keep<00:03:03.900> eating<00:03:04.110> and<00:03:04.560> growing<00:03:04.980> and<00:03:05.430> great

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
gonna keep eating and growing and great

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.030 
gonna keep eating and growing and great
gaining<00:03:06.180> strength<00:03:06.390> to<00:03:06.750> get<00:03:06.900> their<00:03:07.110> 70<00:03:07.830> grams

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
gaining strength to get their 70 grams

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.670 
gaining strength to get their 70 grams
of<00:03:08.250> fat<00:03:08.430> built<00:03:08.730> up<00:03:08.940> and<00:03:09.209> then<00:03:10.200> they<00:03:10.349> take<00:03:10.530> off

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
of fat built up and then they take off

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.440 
of fat built up and then they take off
for<00:03:11.310> Hawaii<00:03:11.610> but<00:03:11.790> they've<00:03:11.910> never<00:03:12.060> been<00:03:12.299> there

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
for Hawaii but they've never been there

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:12.770 
for Hawaii but they've never been there
before

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
before

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.770 
before
so<00:03:13.290> how<00:03:13.680> do<00:03:13.739> they<00:03:14.220> navigate<00:03:14.610> how<00:03:15.150> do<00:03:15.209> they<00:03:15.420> know

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
so how do they navigate how do they know

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.339 
so how do they navigate how do they know
where<00:03:16.260> to<00:03:16.290> go<00:03:16.519> nobody<00:03:17.519> knows<00:03:17.880> for<00:03:17.910> sure<00:03:18.180> and<00:03:18.660> if

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:19.349 
where to go nobody knows for sure and if

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:22.880 
where to go nobody knows for sure and if
if<00:03:19.620> they<00:03:20.070> miss<00:03:20.579> it<00:03:20.790> even<00:03:21.180> if<00:03:21.510> some<00:03:21.780> side<00:03:22.560> wind

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
if they miss it even if some side wind

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.710 
if they miss it even if some side wind
would<00:03:23.100> catch<00:03:23.310> them<00:03:23.549> and<00:03:23.820> start<00:03:24.239> blowing<00:03:24.600> them

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
would catch them and start blowing them

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.140 
would catch them and start blowing them
off<00:03:24.810> course<00:03:25.109> they<00:03:25.500> still<00:03:25.769> get<00:03:25.890> there<00:03:26.160> and<00:03:26.370> they

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
off course they still get there and they

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.470 
off course they still get there and they
can<00:03:27.390> arrive<00:03:27.959> at<00:03:28.739> the<00:03:28.950> exact<00:03:29.370> same<00:03:29.790> location

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
can arrive at the exact same location

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.500 
can arrive at the exact same location
every<00:03:30.690> year<00:03:31.130> within<00:03:32.130> an<00:03:32.549> area<00:03:32.819> the<00:03:33.090> size<00:03:33.269> of

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
every year within an area the size of

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.380 
every year within an area the size of
this<00:03:33.660> room<00:03:34.019> and<00:03:34.319> they<00:03:34.680> do<00:03:34.739> this<00:03:35.010> over

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
this room and they do this over

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.569 
this room and they do this over
thousands<00:03:36.390> of<00:03:36.540> miles<00:03:36.750> how<00:03:37.739> do<00:03:37.799> these<00:03:38.130> animals

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:38.579 
thousands of miles how do these animals

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:41.180 
thousands of miles how do these animals
get<00:03:38.850> from<00:03:39.150> here<00:03:39.480> to<00:03:39.510> there<00:03:39.900> the<00:03:40.769> scientists

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
get from here to there the scientists

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:42.440 
get from here to there the scientists
are<00:03:41.250> still<00:03:41.400> trying<00:03:41.609> to<00:03:41.700> figure<00:03:41.880> that<00:03:42.090> out<00:03:42.150> say

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
are still trying to figure that out say

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:43.940 
are still trying to figure that out say
the<00:03:42.660> same<00:03:42.840> thing<00:03:42.989> with<00:03:43.109> the<00:03:43.230> homing<00:03:43.440> pigeons

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
the same thing with the homing pigeons

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.150 
the same thing with the homing pigeons
these<00:03:44.910> little<00:03:45.299> birds<00:03:45.510> can<00:03:46.319> find<00:03:46.680> their<00:03:46.980> way

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
these little birds can find their way

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.180 
these little birds can find their way
back<00:03:47.819> home<00:03:48.060> to<00:03:48.120> their<00:03:48.420> very<00:03:48.870> spot<00:03:49.590> where<00:03:49.859> they

back home to their very spot where they
