00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.439 
fabric and made a soda strap on the one
side<00:04:46.870> before<00:04:47.080> I<00:04:47.320> saw<00:04:47.590> the<00:04:47.650> sides<00:04:48.370> together<00:04:48.669> so

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:49.449 
side before I saw the sides together so

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:52.500 
side before I saw the sides together so
this<00:04:49.870> one<00:04:50.199> is<00:04:50.620> actually<00:04:51.310> the<00:04:51.550> same<00:04:51.880> material

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
this one is actually the same material

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:55.770 
this one is actually the same material
but<00:04:52.919> the<00:04:53.919> lining<00:04:54.190> is<00:04:54.460> facing<00:04:54.880> out<00:04:55.030> because<00:04:55.389> I

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
but the lining is facing out because I

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.180 
but the lining is facing out because I
wasn't<00:04:55.990> paying<00:04:56.229> attention<00:04:56.770> when<00:04:56.919> I<00:04:56.979> was

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
wasn't paying attention when I was

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:58.950 
wasn't paying attention when I was
sewing<00:04:57.460> them<00:04:57.580> together<00:04:57.669> but<00:04:58.479> it's<00:04:58.720> fine

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
sewing them together but it's fine

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.629 
sewing them together but it's fine
because<00:04:59.169> it<00:04:59.470> actually<00:04:59.620> gives<00:05:00.040> it<00:05:00.160> a<00:05:00.280> different

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:00.639 
because it actually gives it a different

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:02.370 
because it actually gives it a different
texture<00:05:00.940> on<00:05:01.120> the<00:05:01.210> outside<00:05:01.240> and<00:05:01.780> it<00:05:01.840> looks<00:05:01.870> it

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:02.380 
texture on the outside and it looks it

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.140 
texture on the outside and it looks it
looks<00:05:02.620> just<00:05:03.190> fine<00:05:03.400> you<00:05:03.580> would<00:05:03.729> never<00:05:03.880> know<00:05:04.090> it

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150 
looks just fine you would never know it

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.040 
looks just fine you would never know it
wasn't<00:05:04.450> supposed<00:05:04.540> to<00:05:04.720> be<00:05:04.840> a<00:05:04.870> part<00:05:05.139> of<00:05:05.320> the

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050 
wasn't supposed to be a part of the

wasn't supposed to be a part of the
project<00:05:08.050> if<00:05:08.410> I<00:05:08.500> didn't<00:05:08.770> tell<00:05:08.919> you<00:05:08.979> and<00:05:09.070> that's

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:09.220 
project if I didn't tell you and that's

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:10.740 
project if I didn't tell you and that's
the<00:05:09.340> good<00:05:09.460> thing<00:05:09.639> about<00:05:09.669> sewing<00:05:10.330> you<00:05:10.540> can

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750 
the good thing about sewing you can

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:12.659 
the good thing about sewing you can
actually<00:05:10.990> make<00:05:11.440> things<00:05:11.710> whatever<00:05:12.040> you<00:05:12.460> want

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:12.669

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:14.909 
actually make things whatever you want
them<00:05:12.850> to<00:05:13.000> be<00:05:13.240> now<00:05:13.900> this<00:05:14.200> one<00:05:14.440> does<00:05:14.680> have<00:05:14.710> a

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:14.919 
them to be now this one does have a

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:16.920 
them to be now this one does have a
zipper<00:05:15.220> on<00:05:15.460> it<00:05:15.520> it<00:05:16.060> does<00:05:16.330> not<00:05:16.479> have<00:05:16.750> any

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930 
zipper on it it does not have any

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:21.060 
zipper on it it does not have any
pockets<00:05:17.530> on<00:05:18.190> the<00:05:18.580> inside<00:05:19.150> of<00:05:19.180> the<00:05:19.510> purse<00:05:20.070> okay

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:21.070 
pockets on the inside of the purse okay

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:24.060 
pockets on the inside of the purse okay
but<00:05:21.910> you<00:05:22.030> can<00:05:22.180> fit<00:05:22.449> a<00:05:22.479> lot<00:05:22.870> of<00:05:22.900> things<00:05:23.080> in<00:05:23.620> here

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:24.070 
but you can fit a lot of things in here

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:25.950 
but you can fit a lot of things in here
that's<00:05:24.520> a<00:05:24.669> good<00:05:24.820> thing<00:05:25.000> about<00:05:25.120> it<00:05:25.510> this<00:05:25.780> is

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:25.960 
that's a good thing about it this is

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.620 
that's a good thing about it this is
probably<00:05:26.260> the<00:05:26.410> smallest<00:05:26.710> I<00:05:27.039> can<00:05:27.220> go<00:05:27.430> for<00:05:28.360> a

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:28.630 
probably the smallest I can go for a

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:31.610 
probably the smallest I can go for a
purse<00:05:28.990> and<00:05:29.380> the<00:05:29.919> purpose<00:05:30.280> of<00:05:30.490> the<00:05:30.700> strap<00:05:31.120> is

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:31.620 
purse and the purpose of the strap is

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:36.090 
purse and the purpose of the strap is
actually<00:05:32.620> so<00:05:32.889> I<00:05:32.950> can<00:05:33.190> carry<00:05:33.460> it<00:05:33.669> like<00:05:34.060> that<00:05:35.100> you

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:36.100 
actually so I can carry it like that you

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:38.810 
actually so I can carry it like that you
know<00:05:36.220> with<00:05:36.400> clutches<00:05:36.789> you<00:05:36.940> want<00:05:37.150> to<00:05:37.240> just<00:05:37.419> have

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:38.820 
know with clutches you want to just have

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:41.700 
know with clutches you want to just have
the<00:05:39.820> convenience<00:05:40.510> of<00:05:40.750> being<00:05:40.840> able<00:05:41.289> to<00:05:41.440> just

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:41.710 
the convenience of being able to just

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:45.330 
the convenience of being able to just
toss<00:05:42.460> things<00:05:42.820> in<00:05:43.090> there<00:05:43.330> but<00:05:44.020> to<00:05:44.590> just<00:05:44.979> also

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:45.340 
toss things in there but to just also

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:47.339 
toss things in there but to just also
have<00:05:45.729> a<00:05:45.760> strap<00:05:46.120> on<00:05:46.360> it<00:05:46.389> I've<00:05:46.690> noticed<00:05:47.200> is<00:05:47.320> a

00:05:47.339 --> 00:05:47.349 
have a strap on it I've noticed is a

00:05:47.349 --> 00:05:49.290 
have a strap on it I've noticed is a
little<00:05:47.650> more<00:05:47.800> convenient<00:05:48.280> and<00:05:48.610> instead<00:05:49.240> of

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:49.300 
little more convenient and instead of

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:50.730 
little more convenient and instead of
doing<00:05:49.630> the<00:05:49.720> traditional<00:05:49.900> straps

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:50.740 
doing the traditional straps

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.610 
doing the traditional straps
I<00:05:50.830> actually<00:05:51.099> just<00:05:51.460> decided<00:05:52.060> to<00:05:52.090> put<00:05:53.050> mine<00:05:53.320> in

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:53.620 
I actually just decided to put mine in

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.129 
I actually just decided to put mine in
the<00:05:53.860> design<00:05:54.250> so<00:05:54.789> I<00:05:54.820> really<00:05:55.389> like<00:05:55.599> how<00:05:55.810> it<00:05:55.960> came

00:05:56.129 --> 00:05:56.139 
the design so I really like how it came

00:05:56.139 --> 00:05:58.260 
the design so I really like how it came
out<00:05:56.320> it<00:05:56.470> actually<00:05:56.560> came<00:05:56.889> out<00:05:57.070> exactly<00:05:57.250> the<00:05:57.940> way

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:58.270 
out it actually came out exactly the way

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:18.700 
out it actually came out exactly the way
that<00:05:58.720> I<00:05:58.990> wanted<00:05:59.530> it<00:05:59.650> to

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:18.710 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:20.770 

you
