00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
basically it's one of those ones that

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.820 
basically it's one of those ones that
you<00:03:12.239> twist<00:03:12.569> and<00:03:12.750> the<00:03:12.810> foundation<00:03:13.140> comes<00:03:13.500> up<00:03:13.680> I

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
wish the brush was a little bit bigger

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.420 
wish the brush was a little bit bigger

definitely<00:03:21.150> a<00:03:21.180> glow<00:03:21.630> natural<00:03:22.320> because<00:03:22.560> the

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
definitely a glow natural because the

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:25.069 
definitely a glow natural because the
way<00:03:23.730> that<00:03:23.910> it<00:03:24.030> goes<00:03:24.180> on<00:03:24.329> it<00:03:24.480> goes<00:03:24.630> on<00:03:24.750> very

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
way that it goes on it goes on very

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:27.440 
way that it goes on it goes on very
sheer<00:03:25.620> and<00:03:25.920> it<00:03:26.130> does<00:03:26.400> give<00:03:26.790> you<00:03:26.940> a<00:03:27.060> very

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
sheer and it does give you a very

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.960 
sheer and it does give you a very
healthy<00:03:28.549> moist<00:03:30.019> kind<00:03:31.019> of<00:03:31.170> glow<00:03:31.519> and<00:03:32.519> again

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
with someone like me I wouldn't need to

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.220 
with someone like me I wouldn't need to
probably<00:03:35.459> put<00:03:35.970> quite<00:03:36.209> a<00:03:36.269> bit<00:03:36.450> of<00:03:36.570> concealer<00:03:37.019> on

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
probably put quite a bit of concealer on

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.550 
probably put quite a bit of concealer on
underneath<00:03:37.709> because<00:03:38.040> I<00:03:38.250> do<00:03:38.310> have<00:03:38.489> quite<00:03:38.970> a<00:03:39.030> few

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
underneath because I do have quite a few

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.800 
underneath because I do have quite a few
age<00:03:40.560> spots<00:03:41.100> and<00:03:41.310> stuff<00:03:41.579> but<00:03:42.090> this<00:03:42.359> is<00:03:42.570> actually

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
age spots and stuff but this is actually

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.410 
age spots and stuff but this is actually
a<00:03:43.049> very<00:03:43.380> good<00:03:43.950> I<00:03:44.310> think<00:03:44.340> will<00:03:44.850> be<00:03:45.000> a<00:03:45.030> very<00:03:45.269> good

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
a very good I think will be a very good

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.650 
a very good I think will be a very good
foundation<00:03:46.200> for<00:03:46.230> summer<00:03:46.680> because<00:03:47.660> that's

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
what I love about something i love that

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.250 
what I love about something i love that
your<00:03:50.220> skin<00:03:50.519> get<00:03:50.700> stand<00:03:51.060> and<00:03:51.390> you<00:03:51.630> don't<00:03:51.989> have

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
your skin get stand and you don't have

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.170 
your skin get stand and you don't have
to<00:03:52.650> wear<00:03:53.010> as<00:03:53.160> much<00:03:53.190> makeup<00:03:53.400> I<00:03:53.850> don't<00:03:54.060> like

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
to wear as much makeup I don't like

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.780 
to wear as much makeup I don't like
wearing<00:03:54.450> as<00:03:54.630> much<00:03:54.810> makeup<00:03:55.019> in<00:03:55.290> the<00:03:55.380> summertime

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
wearing as much makeup in the summertime

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:00.199 
wearing as much makeup in the summertime
so<00:03:56.790> I<00:03:56.820> think<00:03:57.000> this<00:03:57.299> is<00:03:57.450> a<00:03:57.480> really<00:03:57.780> good<00:03:59.120> kind<00:04:00.120> of

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
so I think this is a really good kind of

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:05.210 
so I think this is a really good kind of
summer<00:04:01.820> foundation<00:04:03.680> definitely<00:04:04.680> more<00:04:04.890> sheer
