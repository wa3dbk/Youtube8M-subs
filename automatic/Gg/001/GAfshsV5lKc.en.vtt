I<00:02:44.750> guess<00:02:45.680> I<00:02:45.769> was<00:02:45.890> a<00:02:45.920> little<00:02:45.980> selfish<00:02:46.370> when<00:02:46.550> I

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
I guess I was a little selfish when I

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:47.800 
I guess I was a little selfish when I
played<00:02:46.790> in<00:02:46.880> the<00:02:46.940> copper<00:02:47.120> crack<00:02:47.390> because<00:02:47.660> I

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
played in the copper crack because I

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.110 
played in the copper crack because I
really<00:02:48.110> wanted<00:02:48.290> to<00:02:48.350> be<00:02:48.440> some<00:02:48.590> water<00:02:48.850> we<00:02:49.850> put<00:02:50.030> it

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
really wanted to be some water we put it

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.580 
really wanted to be some water we put it
in<00:02:50.269> then<00:02:50.480> actually<00:02:50.870> had<00:02:50.959> a<00:02:50.989> really<00:02:51.200> good<00:02:51.410> first

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
in then actually had a really good first

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.100 
in then actually had a really good first
season<00:02:52.010> but<00:02:52.730> the<00:02:53.450> biggest<00:02:53.630> problem<00:02:53.840> is

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
season but the biggest problem is

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.290 
season but the biggest problem is
compromising<00:02:54.980> very<00:02:55.160> chemical<00:02:55.670> a<00:02:55.850> little

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
compromising very chemical a little

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.440 
compromising very chemical a little
expensive<00:02:56.780> and<00:02:57.140> a<00:02:57.739> lot<00:02:58.070> of<00:02:58.130> local<00:02:58.400> guys<00:02:58.670> tried

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
expensive and a lot of local guys tried

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:00.790 
expensive and a lot of local guys tried
it<00:02:59.570> out<00:02:59.660> for<00:02:59.870> a<00:02:59.900> little<00:03:00.080> while<00:03:00.200> and<00:03:00.380> it<00:03:00.530> really

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 
it out for a little while and it really

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.590 
it out for a little while and it really
didn't<00:03:01.040> like<00:03:01.130> it<00:03:01.190> and<00:03:01.550> I<00:03:01.760> think<00:03:01.910> part<00:03:02.390> of<00:03:02.450> it<00:03:02.569> is

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
didn't like it and I think part of it is

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.240 
didn't like it and I think part of it is
because<00:03:02.810> of<00:03:02.930> the<00:03:03.080> technicality<00:03:03.709> of<00:03:03.739> going

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
because of the technicality of going

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.890 
because of the technicality of going
fast<00:03:04.489> and<00:03:04.700> confident<00:03:05.150> and<00:03:05.300> if<00:03:05.390> your<00:03:05.569> stuff<00:03:05.780> is

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
fast and confident and if your stuff is

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.390 
fast and confident and if your stuff is
upright<00:03:06.230> it's<00:03:06.530> actually<00:03:06.800> a<00:03:06.830> little<00:03:06.950> difficult

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
upright it's actually a little difficult

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.729 
upright it's actually a little difficult
to<00:03:07.430> get<00:03:07.550> around<00:03:07.670> the<00:03:07.819> track<00:03:07.940> so<00:03:08.930> we<00:03:09.290> decided<00:03:09.620> to

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739 
to get around the track so we decided to

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:11.560 
to get around the track so we decided to
