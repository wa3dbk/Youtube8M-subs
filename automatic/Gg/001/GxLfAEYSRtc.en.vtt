 further aggressiveness on the remittance of 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.780

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:55.469
 sixth in othello hunter rome still is 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.350

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.750
 who wants to go to nelson 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.250
 with the ant and yes but also a factor on the 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.200
 implementation plan especially in the 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.939
 last matches and here the closure is good 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:27.619
 of ashley and bacchus and in fact yes 

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:30.920
 hinder allowing the rebound to the

 on closing the layout of othello 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:38.659
 hunter of the block to the left of hunter 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:42.470
 janning starts again from enza il 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:47.800
 duel with the goal the hansen exhaust and the 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:50.149
 crush of hunter block of nelson 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.909
 but it is not yet delivered to the 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:56.600
 number 17 the closing of boarding e 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:02:01.030
 very free in the area othello hunter and here 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.030
 you can see the whole lab against hercules

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:12.630
 balloon has in itself goes left then for 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.300
 othello hunter nobody closes because 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.950
 Cordon had gone to the Sienese play 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.870
 we have said world accounts first 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.400
 moves from there firm attack must 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.290
 building a shot alone is wrong 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.150
 this time according to good iron more than 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.040
 all viggiano who finds the rebound 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:30.720
 you need no inter that supports the 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:33.050
 scoreboard also suffers a foul in place 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.050
