00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
doom I've decided to run a negative in

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.560 
doom I've decided to run a negative in
case<00:02:01.500> he<00:02:01.770> wants<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.250> run<00:02:02.430> door<00:02:02.729> switches<00:02:03.240> later

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
case he wants to run door switches later

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.749 
case he wants to run door switches later
on<00:02:03.840> at<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.649> moment<00:02:04.799> is<00:02:05.159> gonna<00:02:05.340> be<00:02:05.460> switched

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
on at the moment is gonna be switched

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.570 
on at the moment is gonna be switched
from<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.060> dashboard<00:02:06.860> but<00:02:07.860> if<00:02:08.250> you<00:02:08.399> wanna

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
from the dashboard but if you wanna

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.430 
from the dashboard but if you wanna
store<00:02:08.759> switches<00:02:09.269> over<00:02:09.450> your<00:02:09.810> negative<00:02:10.200> here

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
store switches over your negative here

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.430 
store switches over your negative here
so<00:02:10.619> it's<00:02:10.950> going<00:02:11.069> to<00:02:11.130> do<00:02:11.280> is<00:02:11.450> not<00:02:12.450> insulate<00:02:13.230> the

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
so it's going to do is not insulate the

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.580 
so it's going to do is not insulate the
light<00:02:13.650> itself<00:02:14.280> from<00:02:14.700> the<00:02:15.180> earth<00:02:15.420> and<00:02:15.690> then

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
light itself from the earth and then

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:23.150 
light itself from the earth and then
door<00:02:17.250> switches<00:02:17.580> all<00:02:17.849> where<00:02:18.620> kill<00:02:21.680> so<00:02:22.680> this

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
door switches all where kill so this

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.120 
door switches all where kill so this

a long time no I'm done and that made a

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.440 
a long time no I'm done and that made a
hell<00:05:04.830> of<00:05:04.860> a<00:05:05.160> difference<00:05:05.310> those<00:05:05.880> headlights

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:06.450 
hell of a difference those headlights

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:08.780 
hell of a difference those headlights
like<00:05:07.290> seriously<00:05:08.010> before<00:05:08.160> you<00:05:08.490> could<00:05:08.670> look

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:08.790 
like seriously before you could look

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:11.570 
like seriously before you could look
straight<00:05:09.240> in<00:05:09.450> it<00:05:09.630> at<00:05:09.990> the<00:05:10.260> filament<00:05:10.800> and<00:05:10.980> it

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 
straight in it at the filament and it

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.150 
straight in it at the filament and it
wouldn't<00:05:11.820> hurt<00:05:11.940> but<00:05:12.360> now<00:05:12.920> it's<00:05:13.920> way<00:05:14.100> too

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 
wouldn't hurt but now it's way too

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.300 
wouldn't hurt but now it's way too
bright<00:05:14.580> I<00:05:14.970> used<00:05:15.840> to<00:05:15.990> actually<00:05:16.140> look<00:05:16.530> like<00:05:16.800> that

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.310 
bright I used to actually look like that

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.900 
bright I used to actually look like that
that<00:05:18.060> bright<00:05:18.270> by<00:05:18.480> way<00:05:19.190> as<00:05:20.190> soon<00:05:20.430> as<00:05:20.550> like<00:05:20.700> it

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:20.910 
that bright by way as soon as like it

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:27.910

dull<00:05:21.300> candle<00:05:22.260> power<00:05:25.610> and<00:05:26.610> it<00:05:26.970> takes<00:05:27.300> better

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:27.920 
dull candle power and it takes better

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:31.370 
dull candle power and it takes better
not<00:05:28.920> bad<00:05:29.130> for<00:05:29.160> steel<00:05:29.610> beams<00:05:30.320> probably<00:05:31.320> the

not bad for steel beams probably the

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.730 
not bad for steel beams probably the
brightest<00:05:31.770> field<00:05:31.950> veins<00:05:32.190> of<00:05:32.370> everything<00:05:33.740> now

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 
brightest field veins of everything now

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:39.650 
brightest field veins of everything now
I'll<00:05:34.830> show<00:05:35.040> you<00:05:35.070> the<00:05:35.190> wine<00:05:38.300> that's<00:05:39.300> bad<00:05:39.540> with

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:39.660 
I'll show you the wine that's bad with

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:41.270 
I'll show you the wine that's bad with
the<00:05:39.750> battery<00:05:40.170> I've<00:05:40.500> redone<00:05:40.800> the<00:05:40.920> battery

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280 
the battery I've redone the battery

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.170 
the battery I've redone the battery
clamps<00:05:41.870> terminals<00:05:42.870> on<00:05:43.050> them<00:05:43.460> and<00:05:44.460> try<00:05:44.850> to<00:05:44.970> fix

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:46.650 
up the standard wiring as much as

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:48.980 
up the standard wiring as much as

again nicely touching this life itself

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:06.880 
again nicely touching this life itself
very<00:07:02.190> much<00:07:02.970> better<00:07:03.300> and<00:07:03.690> works<00:07:04.400> times<00:07:05.400> better

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:06.890 
very much better and works times better

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:11.100 
no that's that of the way cut out more

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:14.810 
no that's that of the way cut out more
why<00:07:11.340> than<00:07:11.640> some<00:07:11.820> safety<00:07:12.030> potato<00:07:12.510> it
