rate okay and we're using a gun with a

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.020 
rate okay and we're using a gun with a
Teflon<00:00:59.540> liner<00:00:59.809> and<00:01:00.140> this<00:01:00.440> gun<00:01:00.739> is<00:01:01.550> only<00:01:01.700> about

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
Teflon liner and this gun is only about

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.180 
Teflon liner and this gun is only about
six<00:01:02.330> foot<00:01:02.540> long<00:01:02.600> uh-huh<00:01:03.410> it's<00:01:03.739> like<00:01:03.950> the

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:04.190 
six foot long uh-huh it's like the

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.520 
six foot long uh-huh it's like the
perfect<00:01:04.790> setup<00:01:05.059> for<00:01:05.210> aluminum<00:01:05.930> the<00:01:06.110> shorter

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
perfect setup for aluminum the shorter

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.020 
perfect setup for aluminum the shorter
the<00:01:06.650> gun<00:01:06.800> the<00:01:06.979> better<00:01:07.160> it<00:01:07.340> is<00:01:07.430> or<00:01:07.790> you<00:01:07.910> need<00:01:08.000> a

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
the gun the better it is or you need a

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.960 
the gun the better it is or you need a
push<00:01:08.270> system<00:01:08.830> even<00:01:09.830> with<00:01:09.920> a<00:01:09.979> 10<00:01:10.250> foot<00:01:10.280> gun<00:01:10.670> we

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
push system even with a 10 foot gun we

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.820 
push system even with a 10 foot gun we
did<00:01:11.180> some<00:01:11.390> experimenting<00:01:11.900> before<00:01:12.440> with<00:01:12.590> a<00:01:12.619> 10

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
did some experimenting before with a 10

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:14.740 
did some experimenting before with a 10
foot<00:01:12.860> gun<00:01:13.280> we<00:01:13.490> weren't<00:01:13.790> quite<00:01:13.940> happy<00:01:14.510> all

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
foot gun we weren't quite happy all

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.390 
foot gun we weren't quite happy all
right<00:01:14.990> well<00:01:15.200> the<00:01:15.320> 6<00:01:15.560> foot<00:01:15.740> gun<00:01:15.979> this<00:01:16.160> works

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400 
right well the 6 foot gun this works

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.160 
right well the 6 foot gun this works
pretty<00:01:16.610> well<00:01:16.790> so<00:01:17.240> you're<00:01:17.660> saying<00:01:18.020> that

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
pretty well so you're saying that

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.590 
pretty well so you're saying that
because<00:01:18.650> aluminum<00:01:19.250> wire<00:01:19.640> is<00:01:19.940> soft<00:01:20.270> the

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
because aluminum wire is soft the

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.749 
because aluminum wire is soft the
shorter<00:01:21.229> the<00:01:21.350> gun<00:01:21.560> the<00:01:21.740> less<00:01:21.950> distance<00:01:22.340> you

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:22.759 
shorter the gun the less distance you

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:24.340 
shorter the gun the less distance you
have<00:01:22.880> to<00:01:23.090> push<00:01:23.300> it<00:01:23.330> if<00:01:23.630> you<00:01:23.720> want<00:01:23.930> to<00:01:23.990> push<00:01:24.200> your

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
have to push it if you want to push your

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:25.330 
have to push it if you want to push your
rope<00:01:24.590> uphill

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
rope uphill

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.219 
rope uphill
how<00:01:25.520> far<00:01:25.970> do<00:01:26.090> you<00:01:26.119> want<00:01:26.360> to<00:01:26.450> push<00:01:26.630> the<00:01:26.840> robot

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
how far do you want to push the robot

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:30.490 
how far do you want to push the robot
pill<00:01:27.470> as<00:01:28.100> little<00:01:28.700> as<00:01:28.850> possible<00:01:29.149> so<00:01:30.020> this<00:01:30.290> is

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
pill as little as possible so this is

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.760 
pill as little as possible so this is
kind<00:01:30.740> of<00:01:30.860> like<00:01:31.040> all<00:01:31.250> aluminum<00:01:31.700> wire<00:01:31.880> mode<00:01:32.149> or

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
kind of like all aluminum wire mode or

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.560 
kind of like all aluminum wire mode or
ideally<00:01:33.770> aluminum<00:01:34.340> as<00:01:34.550> well<00:01:34.820> it<00:01:34.970> in<00:01:35.090> a<00:01:35.210> spray

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
ideally aluminum as well it in a spray

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.200 
ideally aluminum as well it in a spray
transfer<00:01:35.750> these<00:01:36.710> little<00:01:37.070> machines<00:01:37.460> they<00:01:38.180> have

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
transfer these little machines they have

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.600 
transfer these little machines they have
a<00:01:38.420> hard<00:01:38.690> time<00:01:38.930> coming<00:01:39.140> up<00:01:39.350> with<00:01:39.410> a<00:01:39.530> power<00:01:39.800> so<00:01:40.280> it

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
a hard time coming up with a power so it

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.969 
a hard time coming up with a power so it
might<00:01:41.119> not<00:01:41.330> really<00:01:41.509> be<00:01:41.600> a<00:01:41.750> spray<00:01:42.080> transfer<00:01:42.140> but

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
might not really be a spray transfer but

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:45.999 
might not really be a spray transfer but
we're<00:01:43.310> using<00:01:43.520> some<00:01:44.470> alien<00:01:45.470> or<00:01:45.740> a<00:01:45.770> hundred

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
we're using some alien or a hundred

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:48.490 
we're using some alien or a hundred
thousands<00:01:46.700> even<00:01:47.030> with<00:01:47.390> less<00:01:47.569> material<00:01:47.810> yeah

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
thousands even with less material yeah

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.520 
thousands even with less material yeah
and<00:01:48.920> well<00:01:49.369> we<00:01:49.819> will<00:01:49.970> try<00:01:50.209> to<00:01:50.319> aluminum<00:01:51.319> weld

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
and well we will try to aluminum weld

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.160 
and well we will try to aluminum weld

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.750 

hell<00:03:06.840> yeah<00:03:07.200> let's<00:03:07.470> see<00:03:07.590> well<00:03:07.830> yeah<00:03:08.070> we<00:03:08.520> having

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
hell yeah let's see well yeah we having

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.430 
hell yeah let's see well yeah we having
a<00:03:08.820> little<00:03:08.880> bit<00:03:09.150> globular<00:03:09.660> transfer<00:03:09.690> here

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
a little bit globular transfer here

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.050 
a little bit globular transfer here
where<00:03:10.650> you<00:03:10.740> either<00:03:10.830> popping<00:03:11.430> and<00:03:11.640> then<00:03:11.760> as<00:03:11.910> the

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
where you either popping and then as the

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.360 
where you either popping and then as the
material<00:03:12.390> heated<00:03:12.630> up<00:03:12.780> it<00:03:13.320> changed<00:03:13.830> more<00:03:14.040> into

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
material heated up it changed more into

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.970 
material heated up it changed more into
like<00:03:14.580> the<00:03:14.730> slide<00:03:15.000> spray<00:03:15.420> here<00:03:15.960> okay<00:03:16.740> and<00:03:16.860> it

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
like the slide spray here okay and it

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.920 
like the slide spray here okay and it
looks<00:03:17.010> pretty<00:03:17.370> clean<00:03:17.700> and<00:03:18.000> let's<00:03:18.360> see<00:03:18.600> what<00:03:18.810> we

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
looks pretty clean and let's see what we

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.020 
looks pretty clean and let's see what we
have<00:03:18.960> for<00:03:19.200> penetration<00:03:19.860> we<00:03:20.670> have<00:03:20.880> this

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
have for penetration we have this

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.880 
have for penetration we have this
typical<00:03:21.300> like<00:03:21.750> one<00:03:22.050> inch<00:03:22.290> inch<00:03:22.620> and<00:03:22.740> a<00:03:22.830> half

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
typical like one inch inch and a half

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.490 
typical like one inch inch and a half
cold<00:03:23.400> start<00:03:23.790> on<00:03:24.030> the<00:03:24.209> wire<00:03:24.390> the<00:03:24.990> same<00:03:25.200> thing<00:03:25.380> is

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
cold start on the wire the same thing is

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.490 
cold start on the wire the same thing is
going<00:03:25.740> to<00:03:25.830> spool<00:03:26.040> gun<00:03:26.250> as<00:03:26.760> far<00:03:27.090> as<00:03:27.180> penetration

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
going to spool gun as far as penetration

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.960 
going to spool gun as far as penetration
here<00:03:28.500> you<00:03:28.770> can<00:03:28.950> see<00:03:29.190> there's<00:03:29.400> a<00:03:29.490> little<00:03:29.820> bit

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
here you can see there's a little bit

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.430 
here you can see there's a little bit
coming<00:03:30.180> through<00:03:30.510> that's<00:03:30.840> probably<00:03:31.290> good

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
coming through that's probably good

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.840 
coming through that's probably good
enough<00:03:31.470> if<00:03:32.070> you<00:03:32.250> have<00:03:32.550> really<00:03:32.730> good

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
enough if you have really good

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.699 
enough if you have really good
penetration<00:03:33.330> once<00:03:33.810> the<00:03:33.959> material<00:03:34.320> heated<00:03:34.560> up

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
penetration once the material heated up

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.130 
penetration once the material heated up
all<00:03:34.980> right<00:03:35.220> and<00:03:35.400> so<00:03:36.390> this<00:03:36.510> machine<00:03:36.720> is<00:03:36.900> well

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
all right and so this machine is well

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:38.810 
all right and so this machine is well
capable<00:03:37.680> of<00:03:37.800> welding<00:03:38.190> like<00:03:38.340> eighth<00:03:38.550> inch

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
capable of welding like eighth inch

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.530 
capable of welding like eighth inch
material<00:03:39.060> and<00:03:40.430> so<00:03:41.430> very<00:03:41.880> little<00:03:42.150> or<00:03:42.360> no

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
material and so very little or no

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.770 
material and so very little or no

happens<00:04:05.610> they'll<00:04:05.820> stand<00:04:06.150> behind<00:04:06.360> it<00:04:06.780> so<00:04:07.500> all

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
happens they'll stand behind it so all

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.740 
happens they'll stand behind it so all
right<00:04:07.890> now<00:04:08.160> about<00:04:08.880> this<00:04:09.090> well<00:04:09.299> you<00:04:09.480> know<00:04:09.600> we've

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
right now about this well you know we've

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.960 
right now about this well you know we've
got<00:04:09.900> this<00:04:10.110> little<00:04:10.320> bit<00:04:10.500> of<00:04:10.620> cold<00:04:10.860> pull<00:04:11.850> all

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
got this little bit of cold pull all

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.610 
got this little bit of cold pull all
that<00:04:12.180> so<00:04:12.299> I'm<00:04:12.360> good<00:04:12.510> back<00:04:12.660> or<00:04:12.780> side<00:04:12.930> wall<00:04:13.170> still

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
that so I'm good back or side wall still

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.020 
that so I'm good back or side wall still
hot<00:04:13.860> so<00:04:14.250> you're<00:04:14.400> saying<00:04:14.640> a<00:04:14.700> little<00:04:14.880> bit<00:04:14.970> of

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
hot so you're saying a little bit of

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.759 
hot so you're saying a little bit of
preheat<00:04:15.420> oh<00:04:15.450> hell<00:04:15.690> free<00:04:15.989> heat<00:04:16.200> will<00:04:16.380> always

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
preheat oh hell free heat will always

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:26.600 
preheat oh hell free heat will always
help<00:04:22.880> yeah

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.409 

that's<00:04:27.509> too<00:04:27.750> hot<00:04:27.930> right<00:04:28.169> there<00:04:28.590> she's<00:04:29.419> busy

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:30.419 
that's too hot right there she's busy

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:31.999 
that's too hot right there she's busy
that's<00:04:30.720> where<00:04:30.960> we<00:04:31.050> had<00:04:31.199> the<00:04:31.319> big<00:04:31.500> heat<00:04:31.710> from

00:04:31.999 --> 00:04:32.009 
that's where we had the big heat from

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:34.100 
that's where we had the big heat from
the<00:04:32.159> first<00:04:32.370> pass<00:04:32.669> and<00:04:33.240> it<00:04:33.360> just<00:04:33.690> got<00:04:33.900> a<00:04:33.960> little

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
the first pass and it just got a little

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.950 
the first pass and it just got a little
bit<00:04:34.289> too<00:04:34.470> hot<00:04:34.650> whoo<00:04:35.069> so<00:04:35.580> you<00:04:35.639> it's<00:04:36.449> aluminum

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
bit too hot whoo so you it's aluminum

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.990 
bit too hot whoo so you it's aluminum
aluminum<00:04:37.590> is<00:04:37.919> a<00:04:38.009> lot<00:04:38.159> of<00:04:38.280> learning<00:04:38.610> curve<00:04:38.759> it's

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
aluminum is a lot of learning curve it's

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.939 
aluminum is a lot of learning curve it's
not<00:04:39.150> like<00:04:39.389> steel<00:04:39.659> you<00:04:40.229> don't<00:04:40.440> see<00:04:40.710> like<00:04:40.919> a

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:40.949 
not like steel you don't see like a

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:43.520 
not like steel you don't see like a
molten<00:04:41.520> puddle<00:04:41.699> per<00:04:42.060> se<00:04:42.300> aluminum<00:04:43.139> changes

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
molten puddle per se aluminum changes

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.890 
molten puddle per se aluminum changes
colors<00:04:43.979> it<00:04:44.159> doesn't<00:04:44.460> glow<00:04:44.669> yeah<00:04:45.060> and<00:04:45.539> in<00:04:45.690> order

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
colors it doesn't glow yeah and in order

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.809 
colors it doesn't glow yeah and in order
to<00:04:46.050> get<00:04:46.349> really<00:04:46.650> good<00:04:46.830> at<00:04:46.889> it<00:04:47.099> it<00:04:47.310> takes<00:04:47.520> a<00:04:47.699> lot

00:04:47.809 --> 00:04:47.819 
to get really good at it it takes a lot

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:50.089 
to get really good at it it takes a lot
of<00:04:47.849> practice<00:04:48.479> you<00:04:48.990> find<00:04:49.319> out<00:04:49.470> how<00:04:49.770> much<00:04:49.949> you

00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:50.099 
of practice you find out how much you

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:53.029 
of practice you find out how much you
have<00:04:50.190> to<00:04:50.250> preheat<00:04:50.759> when<00:04:51.569> not<00:04:52.110> to<00:04:52.379> weld<00:04:52.560> anymore

00:04:53.029 --> 00:04:53.039 
have to preheat when not to weld anymore

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:54.950 
have to preheat when not to weld anymore
especially<00:04:53.310> if<00:04:53.879> you<00:04:54.000> do<00:04:54.120> like<00:04:54.330> a<00:04:54.360> build<00:04:54.690> up

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
especially if you do like a build up

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.529 
especially if you do like a build up
unlike<00:04:55.620> an<00:04:55.830> aluminum<00:04:56.340> windshield<00:04:56.970> wiper

00:04:57.529 --> 00:04:57.539 
unlike an aluminum windshield wiper

00:04:57.539 --> 00:04:59.749 
unlike an aluminum windshield wiper
mount<00:04:58.080> and<00:04:58.470> if<00:04:58.800> you<00:04:58.889> try<00:04:59.099> to<00:04:59.159> fill<00:04:59.460> the<00:04:59.580> hole

00:04:59.749 --> 00:04:59.759 
mount and if you try to fill the hole

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:01.670 
mount and if you try to fill the hole
and<00:05:00.090> you<00:05:00.479> get<00:05:00.659> crazy<00:05:00.900> and<00:05:01.139> you<00:05:01.229> fill<00:05:01.409> fill<00:05:01.650> fill

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
and you get crazy and you fill fill fill

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.290 
and you get crazy and you fill fill fill
fill<00:05:01.919> before<00:05:02.520> you<00:05:02.580> know<00:05:02.699> it's<00:05:02.909> half<00:05:03.060> of<00:05:03.210> the

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 
fill before you know it's half of the

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.029 
fill before you know it's half of the
thing<00:05:03.449> is<00:05:03.539> just<00:05:03.659> like<00:05:03.750> falling<00:05:04.169> off<00:05:04.469> and<00:05:04.800> a<00:05:04.860> big

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:05.039 
thing is just like falling off and a big

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:07.010 
thing is just like falling off and a big
blob<00:05:05.340> of<00:05:05.370> aluminum<00:05:05.909> the<00:05:06.000> floor<00:05:06.270> so<00:05:06.840> you're

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
blob of aluminum the floor so you're

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:08.809 
blob of aluminum the floor so you're
saying<00:05:07.379> it<00:05:07.500> takes<00:05:07.710> a<00:05:07.919> little<00:05:08.069> while<00:05:08.310> it<00:05:08.639> takes

00:05:08.809 --> 00:05:08.819 
saying it takes a little while it takes

00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:10.279 
saying it takes a little while it takes
it<00:05:09.000> takes<00:05:09.210> a<00:05:09.389> little<00:05:09.539> bit<00:05:09.629> getting<00:05:09.719> used<00:05:10.169> to

00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:10.289 
it takes a little bit getting used to

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:12.260 
it takes a little bit getting used to
get<00:05:10.860> yourself<00:05:11.310> a<00:05:11.430> piece<00:05:11.610> of<00:05:11.819> scrap<00:05:12.090> aluminum

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 
get yourself a piece of scrap aluminum

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.050 
get yourself a piece of scrap aluminum
cut<00:05:12.870> it<00:05:12.990> up<00:05:13.110> with<00:05:13.349> a<00:05:13.379> saw<00:05:13.650> and<00:05:13.949> and<00:05:14.849> run<00:05:15.030> a

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060 
cut it up with a saw and and run a

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.180 
cut it up with a saw and and run a
couple<00:05:15.389> beats<00:05:15.539> and<00:05:15.870> see<00:05:16.080> where<00:05:16.560> you're<00:05:16.740> at<00:05:16.770> and

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:17.190 
couple beats and see where you're at and

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:18.499 
couple beats and see where you're at and
where<00:05:17.280> you<00:05:17.400> need<00:05:17.550> to<00:05:17.669> be<00:05:17.819> and<00:05:18.060> if<00:05:18.150> you<00:05:18.240> need<00:05:18.389> to

00:05:18.499 --> 00:05:18.509 
where you need to be and if you need to

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:19.939 
where you need to be and if you need to
stop<00:05:18.750> when<00:05:18.990> you<00:05:19.080> see<00:05:19.289> it's<00:05:19.409> getting<00:05:19.530> too<00:05:19.770> hot

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:19.949 
stop when you see it's getting too hot

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:22.490 
stop when you see it's getting too hot
just<00:05:20.219> stop<00:05:20.819> you<00:05:21.599> know<00:05:21.719> take<00:05:22.020> a<00:05:22.050> little<00:05:22.229> break<00:05:22.440> a

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 
just stop you know take a little break a

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.020 
just stop you know take a little break a
minute<00:05:22.740> or<00:05:22.949> two<00:05:23.069> let<00:05:23.340> it<00:05:23.460> cool<00:05:23.639> a<00:05:23.699> little<00:05:23.819> bit

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:24.030 
minute or two let it cool a little bit

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:26.629 
minute or two let it cool a little bit
don't<00:05:24.690> dunk<00:05:24.930> it<00:05:25.080> in<00:05:25.169> water<00:05:25.199> now<00:05:25.949> the<00:05:26.009> fan<00:05:26.490> and

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:26.639 
don't dunk it in water now the fan and

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:29.089 
don't dunk it in water now the fan and
then<00:05:26.849> and<00:05:27.150> then<00:05:27.690> keep<00:05:28.020> welding<00:05:28.409> again<00:05:28.710> when

00:05:29.089 --> 00:05:29.099 
then and then keep welding again when

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:31.399 
then and then keep welding again when
the<00:05:29.699> temperature<00:05:30.120> is<00:05:30.210> right<00:05:30.389> we've<00:05:31.050> seen<00:05:31.380> a

00:05:31.399 --> 00:05:31.409 
the temperature is right we've seen a

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:33.709 
the temperature is right we've seen a
pretty<00:05:31.830> extreme<00:05:32.340> change<00:05:32.759> from<00:05:33.060> way<00:05:33.240> too<00:05:33.300> cold

00:05:33.709 --> 00:05:33.719 
pretty extreme change from way too cold

00:05:33.719 --> 00:05:35.300 
pretty extreme change from way too cold
the<00:05:33.930> way<00:05:34.050> too<00:05:34.110> hot<00:05:34.469> I<00:05:34.680> guess<00:05:34.949> with<00:05:35.159> this

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:35.310 
the way too hot I guess with this

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:37.490 
the way too hot I guess with this
aluminum<00:05:35.940> you<00:05:36.479> know<00:05:36.659> it<00:05:36.930> takes<00:05:37.199> a<00:05:37.349> little

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:37.500 
aluminum you know it takes a little

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.350 
aluminum you know it takes a little
while<00:05:37.710> to<00:05:37.770> heat<00:05:38.130> up<00:05:38.159> a<00:05:38.430> when<00:05:38.580> it<00:05:38.729> heats<00:05:38.909> up<00:05:39.120> it

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 
while to heat up a when it heats up it

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.360 
while to heat up a when it heats up it
really<00:05:39.960> heats<00:05:40.229> aluminum<00:05:40.830> is<00:05:40.919> a<00:05:41.009> good<00:05:41.190> heat

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:41.370 
really heats aluminum is a good heat

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:44.719 
really heats aluminum is a good heat
conductor<00:05:41.400> this<00:05:42.270> aluminum<00:05:43.169> it<00:05:43.860> first<00:05:44.400> its

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:44.729 
conductor this aluminum it first its

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.080 
good heat conductor it sucks the heat

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.080 
good heat conductor it sucks the heat
out<00:05:49.289> of<00:05:49.319> the<00:05:49.500> weld<00:05:49.770> which<00:05:50.069> makes<00:05:50.340> a<00:05:50.490> crown<00:05:50.789> than

00:05:53.209 --> 00:05:53.219 
cold a little bit into the part but once

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:54.890 
cold a little bit into the part but once
the<00:05:53.430> whole<00:05:53.639> part<00:05:53.940> is<00:05:54.090> hot<00:05:54.300> then<00:05:54.599> there's<00:05:54.750> no

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:54.900 
the whole part is hot then there's no

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:56.990 
the whole part is hot then there's no
way<00:05:55.080> to<00:05:55.139> go<00:05:55.379> then<00:05:55.919> you<00:05:56.190> see<00:05:56.400> this<00:05:56.550> where<00:05:56.849> it's

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.000 
way to go then you see this where it's

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.969 
way to go then you see this where it's
like<00:05:57.180> falling<00:05:57.900> through<00:05:58.259> almost<00:05:58.710> with<00:05:58.919> the

00:05:58.969 --> 00:05:58.979 
like falling through almost with the

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:01.040 
like falling through almost with the
whole<00:05:59.129> part<00:05:59.460> is<00:05:59.580> like<00:05:59.759> heating<00:06:00.120> up<00:06:00.240> yeah<00:06:00.569> all

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:01.050 
whole part is like heating up yeah all

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:03.159 
whole part is like heating up yeah all
right<00:06:01.349> okay<00:06:02.279> cool

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:03.169 
right okay cool

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:06.499 
right okay cool
so<00:06:04.169> you<00:06:04.620> know<00:06:04.770> definitely<00:06:05.069> I<00:06:05.520> guess<00:06:06.029> this

00:06:06.499 --> 00:06:06.509 
so you know definitely I guess this

00:06:06.509 --> 00:06:08.240 
so you know definitely I guess this
probably<00:06:06.930> isn't<00:06:07.080> quite<00:06:07.379> as<00:06:07.500> ideal<00:06:07.830> it's<00:06:08.009> using

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:08.250 
probably isn't quite as ideal it's using

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:10.760 
probably isn't quite as ideal it's using
a<00:06:08.310> spool<00:06:08.580> gun<00:06:08.849> but<00:06:09.150> if<00:06:09.360> you<00:06:09.569> have<00:06:09.779> and<00:06:10.560> that's

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:10.770 
a spool gun but if you have and that's

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:12.950 
a spool gun but if you have and that's
going<00:06:11.069> to<00:06:11.279> make<00:06:11.580> that<00:06:11.879> up<00:06:12.060> for<00:06:12.330> hobbyists<00:06:12.900> or

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:12.960 
going to make that up for hobbyists or

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.350 
going to make that up for hobbyists or
homeowner<00:06:13.409> this<00:06:14.099> is<00:06:14.340> this<00:06:14.699> is<00:06:14.879> really<00:06:15.180> well

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:15.360 
homeowner this is this is really well

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.480 
homeowner this is this is really well
instead<00:06:15.870> of<00:06:15.990> spending<00:06:16.440> thousands<00:06:17.370> of<00:06:17.430> dollars

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:17.490 
instead of spending thousands of dollars

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:20.360 
instead of spending thousands of dollars
on<00:06:17.849> a<00:06:17.940> spool<00:06:18.210> gun<00:06:18.419> or<00:06:18.810> even<00:06:19.620> more<00:06:19.800> thousands<00:06:20.310> of

dollars on an ac/dc take welder this

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:25.959 
dollars on an ac/dc take welder this
will<00:06:23.550> be<00:06:23.759> this<00:06:24.210> will<00:06:24.419> be<00:06:24.479> a<00:06:24.599> good<00:06:24.779> set<00:06:25.050> up<00:06:25.199> to

00:06:25.959 --> 00:06:25.969 
will be this will be a good set up to

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:28.830 
will be this will be a good set up to
four<00:06:26.969> little<00:06:27.180> projects

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:28.840 
four little projects

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.930 
four little projects
so<00:06:29.380> another<00:06:29.800> another<00:06:30.250> thing<00:06:30.370> you<00:06:30.639> might<00:06:30.760> want

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:30.940 
so another another thing you might want

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:32.700 
so another another thing you might want
to<00:06:30.970> keep<00:06:31.120> in<00:06:31.300> mind<00:06:31.330> is<00:06:31.720> you<00:06:31.870> know<00:06:31.990> with<00:06:32.139> AC<00:06:32.350> TIG

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:32.710 
to keep in mind is you know with AC TIG

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:34.470 
to keep in mind is you know with AC TIG
as<00:06:32.980> you<00:06:33.160> know<00:06:33.280> that<00:06:33.520> the<00:06:33.639> balance<00:06:34.090> you<00:06:34.240> get

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:34.480 
as you know that the balance you get

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:36.960 
as you know that the balance you get
sort<00:06:34.720> of<00:06:34.750> a<00:06:34.840> cleaning<00:06:35.260> action<00:06:35.440> with<00:06:35.800> it<00:06:36.010> but<00:06:36.700> a

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:36.970 
sort of a cleaning action with it but a

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:38.760 
sort of a cleaning action with it but a
straight<00:06:37.300> DC<00:06:37.720> arc<00:06:37.900> like<00:06:38.139> this<00:06:38.320> you<00:06:38.440> probably

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:38.770 
straight DC arc like this you probably

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:40.950 
straight DC arc like this you probably
don't<00:06:39.340> have<00:06:39.550> this<00:06:39.790> do<00:06:40.030> you<00:06:40.240> don't<00:06:40.480> have<00:06:40.720> much

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:40.960 
don't have this do you don't have much

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:43.129 
don't have this do you don't have much
cleaning<00:06:41.260> action<00:06:41.800> of<00:06:42.040> what<00:06:42.280> you<00:06:42.430> have<00:06:42.639> is

00:06:43.129 --> 00:06:43.139 
cleaning action of what you have is

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:45.450 
cleaning action of what you have is
occasionally<00:06:44.139> if<00:06:44.350> the<00:06:44.500> wire<00:06:44.710> switches<00:06:45.220> it<00:06:45.340> to

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:45.460 
occasionally if the wire switches it to

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:47.550 
occasionally if the wire switches it to
short-circuit<00:06:45.760> transfer<00:06:46.570> the<00:06:47.020> wire<00:06:47.260> actually

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:51.940 
a straight spray arc it doesn't do it

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:54.150 
a straight spray arc it doesn't do it
but<00:06:52.360> the<00:06:52.480> straight<00:06:52.720> spray<00:06:53.050> arc<00:06:53.290> is<00:06:53.470> so<00:06:53.680> hot<00:06:53.889> and

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:54.160 
but the straight spray arc is so hot and

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.580 
but the straight spray arc is so hot and
washes<00:06:54.580> out<00:06:54.760> a<00:06:54.790> lot<00:06:55.240> of<00:06:55.450> that<00:06:55.660> a<00:06:55.870> lot<00:06:56.320> of<00:06:56.440> those
