00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:12.889

 salt 1 tablespoon granulated sugar 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.180
 if you make porridge with a deferred 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.570
 Start must increase the number 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.369
 liquid for 1 multi glass to start 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.600
 grease pan multicooker creamy 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:40.469
 oil and rinse the groats well

 wash the washed cereals send in 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.450
 pan multicooker 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:48.270
 if you cook cook deferred 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.440
 start better to increase the amount 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:57.360
 liquids for 20 cups of cereal 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:01:02.370
 take 5 multi glasses of fluid because 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:10.979
 that so pour 2 nails of a glass of milk 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:14.010
 and half a glass of water remains creamy 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:18.830
 oils and immediately put in porridge now 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.830
 add a tablespoon of pure sugar 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.299
 a teaspoon of salt 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:42.149
 without a slide, we mix everything well 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:45.500
 put cooked and so close the lid and 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:48.030
 choose the menu mode milk porridge 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.770
 features worked and porridge is then 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.229
 that she must stand for a very long time 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.409
 warmed let cook for a long time I did not 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:02:04.799
 necessarily so little less time 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:06.689
 cooking up to 30 minutes but take with the expectation 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:11.250
 the fact that about an hour we will have 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:14.220
 stand on the heating push start like 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:18.030
 we see it's been 30 minutes now just 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:21.480
 we leave porridge on heating for 1 hour 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:29.810
 an hour on the heating went see what 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:32.069
 we got enough thick enough 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:36.239
 not even thick viscous it is with us 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:38.430
 turned out the consistency if you 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:40.380
 want to get porridge thinner can 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.299
 increase the amount of fluid 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.389
 but in principle such a consistency 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:46.650
 normal for milk porridge therefore 

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:49.109
 enjoy your meal 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:53.180
 if you like the recipe do not forget 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:53.180
 Like and to new meetings
