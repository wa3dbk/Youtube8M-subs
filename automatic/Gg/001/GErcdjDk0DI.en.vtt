it<00:03:06.040> and<00:03:07.829> so<00:03:08.829> here<00:03:09.129> is<00:03:09.340> the<00:03:09.609> actual<00:03:10.109> Baxter

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:11.109 
it and so here is the actual Baxter

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:15.059 
it and so here is the actual Baxter
robot<00:03:12.810> you<00:03:13.810> can<00:03:13.870> see<00:03:14.079> this<00:03:14.230> is<00:03:14.379> the<00:03:14.560> the<00:03:14.799> legs

and such but move the camera up you can
see<00:03:28.599> the<00:03:29.199> rest<00:03:29.379> of<00:03:29.530> the<00:03:29.590> robot<00:03:30.629> you<00:03:31.629> can<00:03:31.659> see

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
see the rest of the robot you can see

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.680 
see the rest of the robot you can see
this<00:03:31.989> is<00:03:32.169> basically<00:03:32.560> the<00:03:32.829> torso<00:03:33.609> here<00:03:33.879> and<00:03:34.120> you

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
this is basically the torso here and you

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:39.629 
this is basically the torso here and you
can<00:03:34.900> turn<00:03:35.230> this<00:03:35.440> around<00:03:35.620> and<00:03:36.569> you<00:03:38.370> can<00:03:39.370> see

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:39.639 
can turn this around and you can see

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:42.210 
can turn this around and you can see
inside<00:03:40.150> here<00:03:40.690> you<00:03:41.049> can<00:03:41.290> put<00:03:41.530> a<00:03:41.560> minifigure<00:03:41.979> in

piece right here lips up and you can put
your<00:03:48.669> Baxter<00:03:49.599> minifigure<00:03:50.109> inside<00:03:50.319> there<00:03:51.030> so

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
your Baxter minifigure inside there so

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:58.530 
your Baxter minifigure inside there so
he<00:03:52.180> can<00:03:52.359> control<00:03:52.690> it<00:03:54.750> and<00:03:56.729> both<00:03:57.729> of<00:03:57.760> the<00:03:58.120> hands

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540

have shooting pieces on there and I'm

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.420 
have shooting pieces on there and I'm
gonna<00:04:02.769> try<00:04:03.040> and<00:04:03.099> shoot<00:04:03.400> this<00:04:03.639> hand<00:04:04.650> I've<00:04:05.650> done

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
gonna try and shoot this hand I've done

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.199 
gonna try and shoot this hand I've done
this<00:04:06.579> a<00:04:06.639> few<00:04:06.760> times<00:04:06.970> before<00:04:07.720> this<00:04:08.079> video<00:04:08.379> and

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
this a few times before this video and

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:13.110 
this a few times before this video and
it's<00:04:10.260> broken<00:04:11.310> almost<00:04:12.310> every<00:04:12.579> time<00:04:12.790> I've<00:04:12.940> tried

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
it's broken almost every time I've tried

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.810 
it's broken almost every time I've tried
it<00:04:13.680> so<00:04:14.909> it<00:04:15.909> may<00:04:16.120> end<00:04:16.449> up<00:04:16.570> breaking<00:04:16.780> again<00:04:17.289> and

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
it so it may end up breaking again and

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.250 
it so it may end up breaking again and
so<00:04:18.820> before<00:04:19.299> I<00:04:19.329> do<00:04:19.479> this<00:04:19.690> I'll<00:04:19.870> tell<00:04:20.019> you<00:04:20.139> what

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
it's supposed to do you're supposed to

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.940

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
section just falls off so I'm not real

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.010 
section just falls off so I'm not real
pleased<00:04:34.800> with<00:04:35.040> the<00:04:35.160> design<00:04:35.370> hummus<00:04:36.060> but

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
pleased with the design hummus but

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.990 
pleased with the design hummus but
you're<00:04:37.350> supposed<00:04:37.500> to<00:04:37.860> be<00:04:37.950> able<00:04:38.130> to<00:04:38.220> do<00:04:38.760> that

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
you're supposed to be able to do that

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.330 
you're supposed to be able to do that
and<00:04:39.510> just<00:04:40.140> the<00:04:40.230> hand<00:04:40.410> falls<00:04:40.650> off<00:04:40.860> but<00:04:41.100> as<00:04:41.220> you

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
and just the hand falls off but as you

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.650 
and just the hand falls off but as you
can<00:04:41.460> see<00:04:41.750> very<00:04:42.750> very<00:04:43.020> poor<00:04:43.740> design<00:04:44.040> there

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
can see very very poor design there

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.850 
can see very very poor design there
because<00:04:45.660> that<00:04:45.840> just<00:04:46.080> does<00:04:46.410> not<00:04:46.620> work<00:04:46.830> very

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
because that just does not work very

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.110 
because that just does not work very
well<00:04:47.130> at<00:04:47.400> all<00:04:47.520> and<00:04:48.380> then<00:04:49.670> kind<00:04:50.670> of<00:04:50.730> hard<00:04:50.880> to<00:04:50.940> put

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
well at all and then kind of hard to put

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.410 
well at all and then kind of hard to put
back<00:04:51.150> like<00:04:51.480> that<00:04:51.690> but<00:04:53.030> this<00:04:54.030> is<00:04:54.090> what's

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:54.420 
back like that but this is what's

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:58.460 
back like that but this is what's
supposed<00:04:54.600> to<00:04:54.990> happen<00:04:55.050> well<00:04:55.620> even<00:04:56.280> that<00:04:57.350> like<00:04:58.350> I

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
supposed to happen well even that like I

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.310 
supposed to happen well even that like I
said<00:04:58.680> just<00:04:58.860> not<00:04:59.400> a<00:04:59.430> good<00:04:59.790> design<00:04:59.970> on<00:05:00.600> that<00:05:00.660> part

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 
said just not a good design on that part

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.190 
said just not a good design on that part
but<00:05:01.790> supposed<00:05:02.790> to<00:05:03.090> it's<00:05:03.600> supposed<00:05:03.840> to<00:05:03.900> be<00:05:04.050> like

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:04.200 
but supposed to it's supposed to be like

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.390 
but supposed to it's supposed to be like
that<00:05:04.320> just<00:05:04.590> shoots<00:05:04.800> out<00:05:05.570> and<00:05:06.570> you've<00:05:06.720> got<00:05:06.840> the

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.400 
that just shoots out and you've got the

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.220 
that just shoots out and you've got the
little<00:05:08.400> string<00:05:09.030> there<00:05:09.240> it's<00:05:09.480> attached<00:05:09.780> to<00:05:09.930> so

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:10.230 
little string there it's attached to so

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:12.710 
little string there it's attached to so
it<00:05:10.350> doesn't<00:05:10.680> just<00:05:10.710> you<00:05:11.430> don't<00:05:11.520> lose<00:05:11.850> it<00:05:12.060> which

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 
it doesn't just you don't lose it which

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.720 
it doesn't just you don't lose it which
that's<00:05:12.930> kind<00:05:13.260> of<00:05:13.290> nice<00:05:13.410> if<00:05:13.740> you<00:05:14.520> know<00:05:14.610> it

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:14.730 
that's kind of nice if you know it

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:18.440 
that's kind of nice if you know it
actually<00:05:14.880> shot<00:05:15.780> right<00:05:16.820> and<00:05:17.820> then<00:05:18.060> on<00:05:18.240> this

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:18.450 
actually shot right and then on this

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:20.180 
actually shot right and then on this
hand<00:05:18.750> I<00:05:18.990> think<00:05:19.050> it<00:05:19.350> tends<00:05:19.590> to<00:05:19.770> work<00:05:19.920> better

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190 
hand I think it tends to work better

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:23.150 
hand I think it tends to work better
than<00:05:20.520> the<00:05:20.790> other<00:05:21.030> one<00:05:21.240> it's<00:05:22.170> got<00:05:22.410> the<00:05:22.620> it's

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 
than the other one it's got the it's

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:28.580 
than the other one it's got the it's
basically<00:05:23.340> a<00:05:23.670> flick<00:05:24.000> fire<00:05:26.750> well<00:05:27.750> I<00:05:27.990> was<00:05:28.410> afraid

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.590 
basically a flick fire well I was afraid

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:33.880 
basically a flick fire well I was afraid
to<00:05:28.800> push<00:05:29.640> it<00:05:29.760> too<00:05:29.880> hard<00:05:29.910> but<00:05:31.070> well<00:05:32.120> there<00:05:33.120> we<00:05:33.210> go

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:33.890 
to push it too hard but well there we go

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:36.920 
to push it too hard but well there we go
so<00:05:34.890> it<00:05:35.130> works<00:05:35.400> better<00:05:35.670> than<00:05:35.970> the<00:05:36.180> other<00:05:36.510> hand

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:36.930 
so it works better than the other hand

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:41.540 
so it works better than the other hand
they're<00:05:37.820> kind<00:05:38.820> of<00:05:38.850> neat<00:05:39.530> and<00:05:40.530> you<00:05:41.280> do<00:05:41.400> also

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:41.550 
they're kind of neat and you do also

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:44.330 
they're kind of neat and you do also
have<00:05:41.700> to<00:05:42.150> flick<00:05:42.420> fire<00:05:42.630> on<00:05:42.930> the<00:05:43.530> very<00:05:43.800> top<00:05:44.040> of

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:44.340 
have to flick fire on the very top of

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:49.190 
have to flick fire on the very top of
the<00:05:44.460> robot<00:05:44.790> up<00:05:44.970> here<00:05:47.630> and<00:05:48.630> see<00:05:48.810> right<00:05:48.990> here

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:49.200 
the robot up here and see right here

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:56.960 
the robot up here and see right here
here<00:05:49.860> and<00:05:50.130> also<00:05:50.460> here<00:05:50.610> so<00:05:55.670> that's<00:05:56.670> pretty<00:05:56.880> much

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:56.970 
here and also here so that's pretty much

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:00.250 
here and also here so that's pretty much
all<00:05:57.180> there<00:05:57.360> is<00:05:57.390> to<00:05:57.660> the<00:05:57.780> set<00:05:58.020> like<00:05:58.830> I<00:05:58.920> said<00:05:59.160> um

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:00.260 
all there is to the set like I said um

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.260 
all there is to the set like I said um
kind<00:06:01.260> of<00:06:01.350> got<00:06:01.620> aggravated<00:06:02.310> at<00:06:02.490> the<00:06:02.760> one<00:06:02.940> hand

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:03.270 
kind of got aggravated at the one hand

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:09.310 
kind of got aggravated at the one hand
because<00:06:03.720> it<00:06:04.530> just<00:06:04.710> did<00:06:04.980> not<00:06:05.010> work<00:06:05.160> very<00:06:05.640> well

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:09.320 

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:13.070 

but<00:06:10.320> other<00:06:10.650> than<00:06:10.980> that<00:06:11.040> I<00:06:11.370> like<00:06:11.670> the<00:06:11.940> set<00:06:12.210> but

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:13.080 
but other than that I like the set but

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:17.510 
but other than that I like the set but
like<00:06:13.110> I<00:06:13.350> said<00:06:13.410> I'd<00:06:13.710> just<00:06:15.080> that<00:06:16.080> one<00:06:16.380> this<00:06:17.130> part

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:17.520 
like I said I'd just that one this part

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.640 
like I said I'd just that one this part
right<00:06:17.700> here<00:06:17.760> just<00:06:18.270> wasn't<00:06:18.690> a<00:06:18.840> great<00:06:18.990> design<00:06:19.470> in

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:19.650 
right here just wasn't a great design in

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:22.670 
right here just wasn't a great design in
my<00:06:19.800> opinion<00:06:19.880> other<00:06:20.880> than<00:06:21.150> that<00:06:21.270> it's<00:06:21.480> nice<00:06:21.680> I

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:22.680 
my opinion other than that it's nice I

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.620 
my opinion other than that it's nice I
would<00:06:23.070> get<00:06:23.400> this<00:06:23.580> set<00:06:23.790> for<00:06:23.940> the<00:06:24.060> minifigures

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:24.630 
would get this set for the minifigures

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:27.140 
would get this set for the minifigures
alone<00:06:24.960> so<00:06:25.800> I<00:06:25.830> still<00:06:26.190> recommend<00:06:26.460> it<00:06:26.700> just<00:06:27.000> on

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:27.150 
alone so I still recommend it just on

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:31.340 
alone so I still recommend it just on
that<00:06:27.420> part<00:06:28.260> but<00:06:29.070> uh<00:06:29.630> anyway<00:06:30.630> I<00:06:30.660> hope<00:06:30.990> you<00:06:31.050> guys
