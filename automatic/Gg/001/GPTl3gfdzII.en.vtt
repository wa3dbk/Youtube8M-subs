00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 well let's go quickly we're in 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.940
 press conferences from the campsite is 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.859
 the teacher another emelec we decided to take 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.139
 those three games and try to alternate 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:13.290
 the ones in the best way today did not give us 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.509
 result to keep working and to think 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.600
 in the next match on Sunday 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.330
 I think that concretely we did not have a 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.490
 good circulation we did not have sequences 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.460
 long passes we never control 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:30.150
 we dominate the game we control it but 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.800
 We never imposed our conditions and 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.590
 that happens in football then when 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.450
 one does not have a good game the rival 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.879
 can have one or two options the 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.829
 second goal I think the team is already 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.149
 is totally played francisco all 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.430
 the defenders above and any 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.030
 thing can happen but the 10 it seems to me 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.730
 that was already 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:54.770
 a result 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:57.160
 hard to turn what we did to him 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:00.290
 impossible all the changes we had 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:03.080
 willing we lost they beat us well and 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:05.000
 to try to improve achieving that is 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.580
 eduardo ahumada news snail 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.520
 profe has some objection with his defense 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.100
 some special comment no no I think 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.799
 what 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.080
 we had in the first goal superiority 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:20.619
 numerical by three players we do not affect 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:23.759
 the ball is a defensive behavior 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:25.810
 Wrong wrong and it's everyone's fault 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.670
 profe very good night and vilagarcía 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.770
 we are live and live for wii 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.049
 news at this time is surely already 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.180
 planned I plan today's match 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:36.250
 what was coming on Sunday and next 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.049
 Thursday against málek who national 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.570
 we can see with the team in front of 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:41.890
 lunario to the team of ricardo lunari and 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.869
 also to find a high 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.250
 performance and of course to begin with 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:47.710
 to take advantage for the 9 cup 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.640
 liberators on Thursday good for the 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:54.700
 Sunday will surely be some 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:58.119
 that we decided to rest today we came from 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:00.220
 play two matches in a row 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.040
 very difficult and that's why we gave him rest 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.280
 to several 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.780
 we have had a virus that has affected 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.149
 at least half the staff and 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.250
 I think we are leaving we are 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.130
 recovering and for the next next 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:17.160
 sorry game we are going to present a team 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.000
 I think competitive and try to win 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.460
 the next game 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.820
 professor osorio and mauricio maya the 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:27.700
 titular team of the world and radio 10 40 m 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.020
 like greetings the performance of alejandro 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.150
 war believes that with that player hugo 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:34.060
 greater possession of the ball in relation to 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.410
 what has been demonstrated by harrison otálvaro 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.290
 Well, it seems to me that Alejandro has 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.500
 been an important player for us 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:45.770
 and as long as we have it healthy 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:47.840
 I think it's going to be the influential place 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:50.210
 as he has unfortunately shown 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.800
 Alejandro came or we have been 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:53.390
 caring because it is recovering from 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.240
 an injury and I think there's little in 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:59.560
 against that level that has led him to be 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.560
 venezuela selection 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.030
 one night he asked her about the plan 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.400
 route thinking about the flight of millionaires 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:10.340
 will change what the team is going to bring 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.620
 players that remains in what remains 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.470
 before again front liber before good 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:21.319
 I just finished answering his colleague 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:24.500
 we're going to attract in those that those 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:27.590
 we rest today and we are going to present a 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:32.120
 team that I think will be competitive 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:34.549
 and and play those three points profe 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:37.010
 based on snail vargas radio of the 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:39.079
 next match after 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.489
 League millionaires do santa fe 

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:43.790
 opinion you have is what I am going to 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:45.140
 I'm going to raise Santa you play 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.970
 Thursday in ecuador 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.829
 santa faith plays the round of the cup 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.980
 liberators before students on Tuesday 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:53.180
 for you the party to be Saturday 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:56.629
 48 hours after you play 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:58.190
 in ecuador on holy Sunday fe to 48 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:00.170
 hours of playing against students take off 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.150
 Bogota that you have been informed and that 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.549
 think 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:08.360
 I think what I think about thinking 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:11.360
 it's irrelevant here there are people to 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:13.190
 are the managers of the calendar what 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.770
 only that I believe is that they are fair to 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:19.239
 national that's all and the day that we 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:19.239
 corresponds to play what are we going to do 

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:27.580
 but well we could not say teacher that 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.630
 it was a time for each one and he was 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.750
 something was left to the team in the second 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:33.510
 weather 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:36.050
 I honestly believe that we had not 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:39.660
 we play well today it seems to me that but not 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:41.850
 I prefer credit and merit to the 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.530
 equity to santiago and its players is 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:45.510
 unfair to say that we had a bad game 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:48.570
 and that's why we lost they played a good 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:51.770
 party and it did not reach us 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.770
 thank you very much pesos
