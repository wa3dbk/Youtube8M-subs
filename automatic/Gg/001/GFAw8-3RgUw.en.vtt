today's video we're going to try to find
the<00:00:13.270> problem<00:00:13.570> with<00:00:14.260> the<00:00:14.350> lien<00:00:14.559> codes<00:00:14.889> on<00:00:15.160> my

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:15.190 
the problem with the lien codes on my

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:25.080 
the problem with the lien codes on my
BMW<00:00:15.820> e46<00:00:16.270> sedan<00:00:23.190> what<00:00:24.190> had<00:00:24.310> happened<00:00:24.820> is<00:00:24.970> I

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:25.090 
BMW e46 sedan what had happened is I

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:27.269 
BMW e46 sedan what had happened is I
didn't<00:00:25.300> have<00:00:25.359> any<00:00:25.570> codes<00:00:25.840> before<00:00:26.080> and<00:00:26.650> we

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:27.279 
didn't have any codes before and we

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:29.970 
didn't have any codes before and we
replaced<00:00:27.670> the<00:00:27.880> CC<00:00:28.300> V<00:00:28.480> valve<00:00:28.779> and<00:00:29.170> we<00:00:29.590> replaced

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:29.980 
replaced the CC V valve and we replaced

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.400 
replaced the CC V valve and we replaced
the<00:00:30.130> valve<00:00:30.160> cover<00:00:30.580> gasket<00:00:31.180> and<00:00:31.390> spark<00:00:32.110> plugs

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:32.410 
the valve cover gasket and spark plugs

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.009 
the valve cover gasket and spark plugs
so<00:00:32.769> somewhere<00:00:33.610> along<00:00:33.699> the<00:00:34.030> line<00:00:34.239> we<00:00:34.570> have<00:00:34.870> a

00:00:35.009 --> 00:00:35.019 
so somewhere along the line we have a

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:36.960 
so somewhere along the line we have a
leak<00:00:35.290> somewhere<00:00:35.590> and<00:00:36.370> we're<00:00:36.519> going<00:00:36.670> to<00:00:36.699> try<00:00:36.910> to

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:36.970 
leak somewhere and we're going to try to

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.180 
leak somewhere and we're going to try to
find<00:00:37.239> it<00:00:37.420> with<00:00:37.510> a<00:00:37.540> propane<00:00:38.019> torch<00:00:38.410> and<00:00:39.070> we're

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.190 
find it with a propane torch and we're

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:40.350 
find it with a propane torch and we're
not<00:00:39.280> going<00:00:39.400> to<00:00:39.489> light<00:00:39.610> the<00:00:39.760> torch<00:00:39.940> we're<00:00:40.180> just

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:40.360 
not going to light the torch we're just

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.790 
not going to light the torch we're just
going<00:00:40.480> to<00:00:40.510> use<00:00:40.630> the<00:00:40.780> gas<00:00:40.960> when<00:00:41.320> the<00:00:41.350> propane

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:41.800 
going to use the gas when the propane

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.190 
going to use the gas when the propane
when<00:00:42.370> the<00:00:42.460> engine<00:00:42.820> is<00:00:42.850> running<00:00:42.910> and<00:00:43.480> if

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:44.200 
when the engine is running and if

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.740 
when the engine is running and if
there's<00:00:44.410> a<00:00:44.469> leak<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.969> engine<00:00:46.300> idle<00:00:46.629> will

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:46.750 
there's a leak the engine idle will

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.709 
there's a leak the engine idle will
change<00:00:47.079> most<00:00:47.410> likely<00:00:47.800> you<00:00:47.890> rev<00:00:48.129> up<00:00:48.340> so<00:00:48.719> I'm

00:00:49.709 --> 00:00:49.719 
change most likely you rev up so I'm

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:51.090 
change most likely you rev up so I'm
going<00:00:49.870> to<00:00:49.930> get<00:00:50.050> set<00:00:50.260> up<00:00:50.320> point<00:00:50.649> the<00:00:50.710> camera<00:00:50.950> at

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.100 
going to get set up point the camera at

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.250 
going to get set up point the camera at
the<00:00:51.219> engine<00:00:51.670> we're<00:00:52.420> going<00:00:52.570> to<00:00:52.629> start<00:00:52.870> the<00:00:52.989> car

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260 
the engine we're going to start the car

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.229 
the engine we're going to start the car
and<00:00:53.530> see<00:00:53.829> if<00:00:53.890> we<00:00:54.010> can<00:00:54.160> find<00:00:54.309> a<00:00:54.489> leak<00:00:54.730> that's

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:55.239 
and see if we can find a leak that's

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:58.200 
and see if we can find a leak that's
related<00:00:55.719> to<00:00:55.840> this<00:00:55.960> code<00:00:56.610> well<00:00:57.610> that<00:00:57.940> did<00:00:58.120> not

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
related to this code well that did not

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:59.939 
related to this code well that did not
give<00:00:58.420> me<00:00:58.510> the<00:00:58.629> results<00:00:59.079> I<00:00:59.199> was<00:00:59.289> after<00:00:59.770> I<00:00:59.800> was

00:00:59.939 --> 00:00:59.949 
give me the results I was after I was

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:03.209 
give me the results I was after I was
hoping<00:01:00.280> fogging<00:01:00.850> it<00:01:01.090> with<00:01:01.270> propane<00:01:02.230> run<00:01:03.100> the

00:01:03.209 --> 00:01:03.219 
hoping fogging it with propane run the

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:07.050 
hoping fogging it with propane run the
decent<00:01:03.670> valve<00:01:03.989> throttle<00:01:04.989> body<00:01:05.729> intake<00:01:06.729> boots

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
decent valve throttle body intake boots

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.870 
decent valve throttle body intake boots
on<00:01:07.869> the<00:01:08.050> MAF<00:01:08.259> sensor<00:01:08.289> around<00:01:09.160> where<00:01:09.460> the<00:01:09.550> hoses

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
on the MAF sensor around where the hoses

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.109 
on the MAF sensor around where the hoses
are<00:01:10.000> for<00:01:10.180> the<00:01:10.240> CC<00:01:10.660> V<00:01:10.869> I<00:01:11.280> think<00:01:12.280> we<00:01:12.400> would<00:01:12.610> suck

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:13.119 
are for the CC V I think we would suck

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:16.620 
are for the CC V I think we would suck
in<00:01:13.299> some<00:01:13.450> propane<00:01:14.100> at<00:01:15.100> this<00:01:15.280> point<00:01:15.580> here<00:01:16.119> my

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
in some propane at this point here my

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.210 
in some propane at this point here my
next<00:01:16.900> step<00:01:17.110> is<00:01:17.260> I'm<00:01:17.380> going<00:01:17.439> to<00:01:17.680> remove<00:01:17.890> the<00:01:18.070> air

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 
next step is I'm going to remove the air

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.520 
next step is I'm going to remove the air
box<00:01:18.490> and<00:01:18.939> the<00:01:19.450> MAF<00:01:19.659> sensor<00:01:19.689> we're<00:01:20.320> going<00:01:20.470> to

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
box and the MAF sensor we're going to

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.830 
box and the MAF sensor we're going to
spray<00:01:20.770> that<00:01:20.979> down<00:01:21.060> all<00:01:22.060> right<00:01:22.210> here's<00:01:22.479> the<00:01:22.570> MAF

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
spray that down all right here's the MAF

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.590 
spray that down all right here's the MAF
sensor<00:01:22.869> here<00:01:23.680> I<00:01:23.860> just<00:01:24.820> used<00:01:25.030> an<00:01:25.150> electrical

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
sensor here I just used an electrical

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.710 
sensor here I just used an electrical
cleaner<00:01:25.900> and<00:01:26.880> gently<00:01:27.880> cleaned<00:01:28.240> it<00:01:28.420> so<00:01:28.570> now

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 
cleaner and gently cleaned it so now

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.920 
cleaner and gently cleaned it so now
we're<00:01:28.900> going<00:01:29.080> to<00:01:29.549> install<00:01:30.549> this<00:01:30.790> back<00:01:31.060> in<00:01:31.390> fire

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
we're going to install this back in fire

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.649 
we're going to install this back in fire
back<00:01:32.229> up<00:01:32.939> clear<00:01:33.939> the<00:01:34.090> code<00:01:34.299> and<00:01:34.450> see<00:01:34.630> what

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:34.659 
back up clear the code and see what

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:39.500 
back up clear the code and see what
happens

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:39.510 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.100 

what<00:01:40.170> I<00:01:40.200> did<00:01:40.410> remove<00:01:40.740> it<00:01:40.980> check<00:01:41.300> out<00:01:42.300> that<00:01:42.600> the

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
what I did remove it check out that the

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.280 
what I did remove it check out that the
o-ring<00:01:43.650> that<00:01:43.920> I<00:01:44.460> had<00:01:44.760> installed<00:01:45.180> I<00:01:45.480> put<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.870> CC

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
o-ring that I had installed I put the CC

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.070 
o-ring that I had installed I put the CC
V<00:01:46.470> valve<00:01:46.770> i<00:01:47.100> damaged<00:01:47.940> it<00:01:48.090> when<00:01:48.360> sticking<00:01:48.750> it<00:01:48.900> in

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 
V valve i damaged it when sticking it in

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.770 
V valve i damaged it when sticking it in
and<00:01:49.470> ripped<00:01:49.740> it<00:01:49.950> so<00:01:50.370> that's<00:01:51.180> a<00:01:51.330> very<00:01:51.510> good

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
and ripped it so that's a very good

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.170 
and ripped it so that's a very good
possibility<00:01:52.050> of<00:01:52.830> another<00:01:53.100> vacuum<00:01:53.400> leak<00:01:53.850> in

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
possibility of another vacuum leak in

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.030 
possibility of another vacuum leak in
the<00:01:54.360> engine<00:01:54.690> itself<00:01:55.080> Falcon<00:01:55.650> could<00:01:55.770> escape

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
the engine itself Falcon could escape

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.090 
the engine itself Falcon could escape
through<00:01:56.520> there<00:01:56.790> so<00:01:57.720> between<00:01:58.080> that<00:01:58.350> and<00:01:58.380> DISA

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
through there so between that and DISA

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.380 
through there so between that and DISA

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.660 
valve intake boot I am hoping that this
will<00:02:03.570> cure<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.930> problem<00:02:04.410> fingers<00:02:04.980> crossed

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
will cure the problem fingers crossed

use red silicone RTV gasket on there
instead<00:02:12.930> of<00:02:12.990> using<00:02:13.470> the<00:02:13.560> proper<00:02:14.040> ol<00:02:14.220> ring<00:02:14.520> so

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
instead of using the proper ol ring so

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.000 
instead of using the proper ol ring so
it<00:02:15.150> is<00:02:15.300> very<00:02:15.570> possible<00:02:15.870> that<00:02:16.260> my<00:02:16.590> frickin

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
it is very possible that my frickin

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.000 
it is very possible that my frickin
vacuum<00:02:17.430> leak<00:02:17.640> could<00:02:17.820> be<00:02:17.970> coming<00:02:18.300> from<00:02:18.450> here

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
vacuum leak could be coming from here

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.470 
vacuum leak could be coming from here
who<00:02:20.010> knows<00:02:20.250> but<00:02:20.670> we're<00:02:20.850> going<00:02:21.000> to<00:02:21.090> replace<00:02:21.360> it

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
who knows but we're going to replace it

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.320 
who knows but we're going to replace it
anyways<00:02:22.040> this<00:02:23.040> is<00:02:23.250> how<00:02:23.430> it's<00:02:23.700> supposed<00:02:23.790> to<00:02:24.240> be

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
anyways this is how it's supposed to be

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.220 
anyways this is how it's supposed to be
an<00:02:24.540> o-ring<00:02:25.730> this<00:02:26.730> is<00:02:26.910> an<00:02:27.060> unserviceable<00:02:27.570> part

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
an o-ring this is an unserviceable part

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.280 
an o-ring this is an unserviceable part
so<00:02:28.500> you'll<00:02:28.650> have<00:02:28.890> to<00:02:29.130> google<00:02:29.670> DISA<00:02:30.570> valve<00:02:30.810> or

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
so you'll have to google DISA valve or

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.230 
so you'll have to google DISA valve or
ring<00:02:31.650> replacement<00:02:32.370> to<00:02:32.520> find<00:02:32.730> out<00:02:32.910> where<00:02:33.090> you

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
ring replacement to find out where you

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.699 
ring replacement to find out where you
can<00:02:33.360> get<00:02:33.450> one<00:02:33.510> because<00:02:33.959> a<00:02:33.990> BMW<00:02:34.590> dealership

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
can get one because a BMW dealership

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.040 
can get one because a BMW dealership
does<00:02:35.640> not<00:02:35.820> sell<00:02:36.180> them<00:02:36.390> so<00:02:36.510> that's<00:02:36.570> probably

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
does not sell them so that's probably

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.690 
does not sell them so that's probably
why<00:02:37.230> it<00:02:37.650> had<00:02:38.280> silicone<00:02:38.870> instead<00:02:39.870> of<00:02:39.990> a<00:02:40.080> gasket

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
why it had silicone instead of a gasket

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.220 
why it had silicone instead of a gasket
silicone<00:02:41.700> is<00:02:41.880> a<00:02:41.910> cheap<00:02:42.180> repair<00:02:42.600> an<00:02:42.900> o-ring

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
silicone is a cheap repair an o-ring

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.430 
silicone is a cheap repair an o-ring
proper<00:02:44.040> gasket<00:02:44.580> is<00:02:44.880> the<00:02:45.180> proper<00:02:45.750> way<00:02:45.870> to<00:02:45.900> do<00:02:46.260> it

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
proper gasket is the proper way to do it

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.740 
proper gasket is the proper way to do it
alright<00:02:47.370> so<00:02:47.700> this<00:02:47.790> point<00:02:48.120> here<00:02:48.360> we<00:02:48.510> got<00:02:48.630> the

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
alright so this point here we got the

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.960 
alright so this point here we got the
intake<00:02:49.050> boot<00:02:49.290> put<00:02:49.560> back<00:02:49.770> on<00:02:50.040> and<00:02:50.400> there's<00:02:50.880> a

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
intake boot put back on and there's a

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.150 
intake boot put back on and there's a
tab<00:02:51.330> on<00:02:51.660> the<00:02:51.780> intake<00:02:52.110> boot<00:02:52.380> that<00:02:52.560> corresponds

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
tab on the intake boot that corresponds

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.400 
tab on the intake boot that corresponds
with<00:02:53.370> the<00:02:53.520> hole<00:02:53.670> in<00:02:53.760> the<00:02:53.850> bottom<00:02:54.200> I'm<00:02:55.200> not

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
with the hole in the bottom I'm not

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:56.750 
with the hole in the bottom I'm not
going<00:02:55.590> to<00:02:55.650> show<00:02:55.860> you<00:02:55.920> that<00:02:56.190> I<00:02:56.220> explained<00:02:56.730> that

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
going to show you that I explained that

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.460 
going to show you that I explained that
in<00:02:56.940> the<00:02:57.060> previous<00:02:57.450> video<00:02:57.720> and<00:02:57.989> I<00:02:58.050> showed<00:02:58.320> it

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
in the previous video and I showed it

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.290 
in the previous video and I showed it
really<00:02:58.769> nice<00:02:58.950> and<00:02:58.980> clear<00:02:59.430> after<00:02:59.940> replacing

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
this code until I figure out what the

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
think it might possibly be and I'll

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.539 
think it might possibly be and I'll
check<00:04:03.510> it<00:04:03.750> and<00:04:03.930> we'll<00:04:04.860> go<00:04:05.040> from<00:04:05.189> there<00:04:05.280> we'll

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:05.549 
check it and we'll go from there we'll

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:08.630 
check it and we'll go from there we'll
see<00:04:05.579> what<00:04:05.819> happens<00:04:06.209> so<00:04:06.450> I<00:04:07.220> hope<00:04:08.220> you<00:04:08.370> enjoyed
