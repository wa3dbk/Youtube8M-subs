on<00:02:33.270> how<00:02:33.450> to<00:02:33.510> deal<00:02:33.840> with<00:02:34.050> the<00:02:34.170> immediate<00:02:34.380> threat

about improving then you should watch

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
do that on the fly so for two ranges you

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:27.780 
do that on the fly so for two ranges you

wood but what is the benefit to this

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.490 
wood but what is the benefit to this
well<00:04:36.670> it<00:04:36.940> broadens<00:04:37.450> your<00:04:37.510> thinking<00:04:38.110> of<00:04:38.260> the

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
well it broadens your thinking of the

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.130 
well it broadens your thinking of the
game<00:04:38.710> you<00:04:39.430> decide<00:04:39.850> that<00:04:39.880> you<00:04:40.210> want<00:04:40.240> to<00:04:40.600> run<00:04:40.810> two

game you decide that you want to run two
archery<00:04:41.560> ranges<00:04:42.010> and<00:04:42.220> then<00:04:42.550> you<00:04:42.670> know<00:04:42.820> exactly

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
archery ranges and then you know exactly

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.270 
archery ranges and then you know exactly
what<00:04:43.480> you<00:04:43.630> need<00:04:43.660> to<00:04:43.960> do<00:04:44.200> and<00:04:44.470> you<00:04:44.590> can<00:04:44.770> prepare

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
what you need to do and you can prepare

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.640 
what you need to do and you can prepare
your<00:04:45.490> economy<00:04:46.000> in<00:04:46.150> advance<00:04:46.600> so<00:04:47.140> that<00:04:47.170> when<00:04:47.500> you

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650 
your economy in advance so that when you

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:49.710 
your economy in advance so that when you
get<00:04:47.890> those<00:04:48.070> two<00:04:48.310> ranges<00:04:48.790> you<00:04:49.120> can<00:04:49.300> run<00:04:49.540> them

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
get those two ranges you can run them

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.380 
get those two ranges you can run them
easily<00:04:49.990> you<00:04:50.440> can<00:04:50.980> also<00:04:51.130> very<00:04:51.610> easily<00:04:52.000> and

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:52.390 
easily you can also very easily and

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:54.810 
easily you can also very easily and
quickly<00:04:52.570> see<00:04:53.080> what<00:04:53.470> surplus<00:04:54.070> resources<00:04:54.280> you

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820 
quickly see what surplus resources you

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.970 
quickly see what surplus resources you
have<00:04:55.030> and<00:04:55.270> then<00:04:55.600> you<00:04:55.630> can<00:04:55.750> direct<00:04:56.350> them<00:04:56.560> into

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:56.980 
have and then you can direct them into

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:59.670 
have and then you can direct them into
another<00:04:57.190> production<00:04:57.970> line<00:04:58.470> let's<00:04:59.470> have<00:04:59.650> a

about macro management but for me macro

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:40.050 
about macro management but for me macro
is<00:06:37.960> much<00:06:38.260> more<00:06:38.500> than<00:06:38.860> tasking<00:06:39.400> all<00:06:39.580> of<00:06:39.940> your

is much more than tasking all of your

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:41.100 
is much more than tasking all of your

00:06:43.439 --> 00:06:43.449 
since piling units it's about the way we

think about the game and the decisions
that<00:06:45.550> we<00:06:45.849> make<00:06:45.900> so<00:06:46.900> hopefully<00:06:47.259> this<00:06:47.470> has<00:06:47.560> been

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:47.740 
that we make so hopefully this has been

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:49.379 
that we make so hopefully this has been
useful<00:06:47.949> to<00:06:48.310> you<00:06:48.430> and<00:06:48.610> you<00:06:48.939> can<00:06:49.090> take<00:06:49.240> a<00:06:49.270> little

00:06:49.379 --> 00:06:49.389 
useful to you and you can take a little

00:06:49.389 --> 00:06:51.600 
useful to you and you can take a little

there's not so much a direct tutorial
here<00:06:54.580> but<00:06:54.849> hopefully<00:06:55.270> you<00:06:55.750> kind<00:06:56.110> of<00:06:56.229> think<00:06:56.530> a

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:56.560 
here but hopefully you kind of think a

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.080 
here but hopefully you kind of think a
little<00:06:56.740> bit<00:06:56.830> more<00:06:56.979> about<00:06:57.250> the<00:06:57.430> way<00:06:57.580> that<00:06:57.759> you

00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:58.090 
little bit more about the way that you

00:06:58.090 --> 00:06:59.700 
little bit more about the way that you
think<00:06:58.659> about<00:06:58.780> the<00:06:58.900> game<00:06:59.139> and<00:06:59.379> the<00:06:59.469> way<00:06:59.500> that

00:06:59.700 --> 00:06:59.710 
think about the game and the way that

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:01.890 
think about the game and the way that
you<00:06:59.949> played<00:07:00.460> the<00:07:00.639> game<00:07:00.819> so<00:07:01.000> thanks<00:07:01.599> a<00:07:01.659> lot<00:07:01.780> for
