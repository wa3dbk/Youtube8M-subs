00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 hello to all today we get 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.120
 found for the first video on a 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.400
 pokemon of versions 1 x and y is you 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.490
 have voted for his excruciating feet the 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:17.070
 pokemon overthrow so I decided to 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:18.800
 do all the video upside down no 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.270
 it's a joke 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.519
 the big news about cit 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.310
 pokemon is that to make it evolve 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:29.820
 since sap revolution sepia top it takes 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:32.399
 return his 3ds during a passage of 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.860
 level from a strategic point of view 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.899
 this is the first pokemon to have the 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.809
 double psychic type and darkness 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.700
 which gives him a big weakness at 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.149
 insects type and a lesser weakness 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.559
 important to tiff and that's it 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:48.539
 but what will really make it 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.899
 interesting pokemon is its ability 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:54.239
 special challenge challenge his 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.699
 reverse the boosts of your pokemon 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.370
 I basically explain to you when your 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.320
 pokemon will have a boost it will do exactly 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.090
 inverted 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.840
 one of the best-known examples is 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.310
 majestic who also has the ability 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.260
 challenge why because when 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.900
 they use green storm which is a 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.939
 very powerful attack hyper normally 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.430
 - two in special attack 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.130
 gold with contestation it is not less 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:23.340
 of media + 2 making it into pokemon 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.680
 formidable the big advantage is that 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.200
 our atrocious website learns too 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.140
 a capacity perfectly adapted to 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.570
 challenge overpower overpower 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.689
 it's a combat type attack it does 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.869
 120 damage normally after having 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:42.240
 used your pokemon father - in attack 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.950
 and less in defense except with 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.640
 constation it does not work like that 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.110
 and the least 1 turns into more a 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.510
 yes that means that in addition 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.490
 having 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:53.350
 an attack already powerful enough you 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.540
 do not have these disadvantages and that 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.240
 will even turn into an advantage for 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.250
 you the only downside is that the 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.910
 statistics of these poor bones are only 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.640
 not terrible 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:05.290
 he is very slow and although he has rather 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.010
 good pv a good attack and a 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.110
 good defense 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.780
 it will remain quite fragile on the plane 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.580
 special but luckily he learns 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.160
 really a lot and we can 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.140
 create a little kid very very good let's see 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.150
 so a little 7 and the attacks that 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.880
 we will choose I advise you to 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.800
 increase d raise in pv in attack a 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.350
 little bit in defense eventually and 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.900
 in speed why because we 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.310
 let's play it with handkerchiefs choose the 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.470
 handkerchief choice you have to start at 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.960
 knowing is an object that increases the 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.240
 speed of our pokÃ©mon 50% 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.020
 him that allows him to use only one 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.150
 single attack 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.890
 why choose this item is good 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.900
 because there is a pretty combo 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.540
 interesting with another attack that 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.850
 the takes the pass pass attak that allows 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.250
 to exchange his object with the opponent 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.350
 the utility of this object is twofold and 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.540
 will depend on anticipation and what 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.370
 you have in front of a certain side that 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.080
 increase your speed and it allows you 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.780
 especially to take advantage of overkill 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:04.239
 who will walk with contestation but of a 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.340
 other side going on it can also 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:08.140
 allow you to pass the handkerchief 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.300
 choice to a pokemon who does not need it 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.190
 and that's going to cripple me you 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.110
 then advise to play with cup 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.150
 psycho and slice but who are two 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.519
 stab attacks and and which in my opinion are 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.500
 the best on him it is possible if of 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:22.360
 play it with fullness that will increase 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.730
 his attack and his special attack and 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.870
 in this case, do not use 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.850
 challenge it's best to play with 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.290
 sucker to accompany him I you 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.870
 advise to take pokemon type 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.820
 fire as flamingo of sart is a small 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.950
 guy of type does like coco tine or 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.780
 even better an infamy I think that 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.440
 it's a small original world that has 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.660
 potential 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.670
 unfortunately in my opinion it will only be 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.800
 not very played because he's a little 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.200
 slow and that for his strategy with 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.150
 protest is still a little 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.250
 embarrassing i think besides that sassou 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.739
 of evolution sepia top will be it too 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.690
 very interesting because he already has 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:57.459
 big defenses and that with a 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.829
 level him rock it can be really 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:01.600
 Well here I hope this little comment 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:04.570
 play will have made you want to discover 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:06.280
 a new pokemon of x and y versions 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.900
 I tell you in every case to very 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:11.190
 soon for more videos on the 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.190
 pokemon strategy and game
