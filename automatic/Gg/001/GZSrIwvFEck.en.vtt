 guitar here we will begin to see 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.920
 the chords and then we'll see both 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:29.180
 different types of rhythmics and ben 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.180
 we start with the agreements 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:33.310

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.750

 chords we'll go quickly on it so 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:47.980
 the swimmers the minor their 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.840
 editor and the floor but I 'm here so 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.730

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.309
 chords click this button everything is 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:57.600
 explained here and well we all saw them 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:57.600
 now let's go to the rhythmic 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.680
 the rhythmic will be the next then 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.180
 on the tablature that appears for 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.680
 those who can read tablatures so 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.930
 the result of agreements is pity hours the 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.270
 minor D minor and G major 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.030
 the whole piece 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.290
 we will play like a pump 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.810
 say we will start by doing the 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.390
 low the e3 is that with a shareholder 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.759
 major then we will take the ring finger 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.100
 in the left hand and we will place it at this 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:27.170
 moment there on the rope 2 me to do 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.170
 a soil that we will play what to do 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.540
 we 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:35.360
 I'm doing them so that's for us the 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.000
 bacon will do it like that so first 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.950
 the agreement of the support the corderie 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.220
 then we stay on the rope body 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:46.510
 of the and the half rope and the rope from there 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.510
 so that will give 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.090
 so you must have seen that during 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.070
 my back when I move I raise the 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.150
 major but we do not play it so it's 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.290
 not very bad but you can 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.090
 also leave because we will see a 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.450
 second technique after lightning at the 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.630
 let 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:15.209
 we also have the opportunity to instead of 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.590
 pull three strings of scratching so that's 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.010
 where it is better to leave the majors 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.010
 for the back 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.600
 this is then reindeer speed 

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:44.459
 for those who have trouble with the 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:47.959
 variation of bassk ba you stay on 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.959
 the fundamental so you stay on 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:00.510
 and afterwards you can little by little 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:02.130
 added the bass variation to make 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.810
 their fees a little more dynamic 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.810
 we will see a rhythm for this chorus 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.170
 for the rhythmic of the chorus we will be 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.180
 starting on the same basis as we will do 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.290
 vary a little bit the piece and 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.209
 unconventional small ternary 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.280
 ternary rise and more so if I 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:19.390
 want card with the exact same 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.580
 thing and with a small ascent 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:24.240
 ternary just before the last shot 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.240
 down so 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.120
 so the same thing 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.680
 before the shot 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.680
 we'll do a lift 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:40.240
 the same thing on the the 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:48.689
 but then you do not have to 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.689
 do the second phase 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.100
 Oh 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:54.579
 we can do it from time to time 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:05.780
 here we can vary a little bit 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:07.850
 all that so it makes it possible to make a 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.200
 chorus much more dynamic here is eh 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.060
 well we had everything we needed for this 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.660
 piece especially you have to play it with the 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.550
 potato 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.440
 and here is nothing to say about 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:16.940
 more about touba secular and video 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.750
 commented share it's up to you 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.750
 work well ciao
