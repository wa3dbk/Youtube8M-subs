years old so when I was nine years old

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.830 
years old so when I was nine years old
is<00:00:58.289> when<00:00:58.469> I<00:00:58.500> got<00:00:58.800> my<00:00:58.949> first<00:00:58.980> relaxer<00:00:59.850> cut<00:01:00.690> my

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
is when I got my first relaxer cut my

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.450 
is when I got my first relaxer cut my

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:25.350 
it anyway just in case just to be sure
because<00:02:23.470> I<00:02:23.860> don't<00:02:24.070> want<00:02:24.340> to<00:02:24.670> be<00:02:24.760> adding<00:02:25.120> heat

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
because I don't want to be adding heat

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
because I don't want to be adding heat
plus<00:02:25.690> ripping<00:02:26.530> a<00:02:26.590> comb<00:02:26.799> through<00:02:27.070> my<00:02:27.130> hair

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
plus ripping a comb through my hair

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.960 
plus ripping a comb through my hair
so<00:02:29.460> the<00:02:30.460> blow-dryer<00:02:30.940> uses<00:02:31.510> this<00:02:31.810> gold<00:02:32.230> and<00:02:32.470> hot

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
so the blow-dryer uses this gold and hot

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.490 
so the blow-dryer uses this gold and hot
