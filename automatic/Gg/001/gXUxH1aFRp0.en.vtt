hi<00:00:04.830> it's<00:00:04.980> mr.<00:00:05.250> Andersen<00:00:05.640> and<00:00:05.730> in<00:00:05.850> this<00:00:05.910> video

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
hi it's mr. Andersen and in this video

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.490 
hi it's mr. Andersen and in this video
I'm<00:00:06.420> gonna<00:00:06.509> walk<00:00:06.750> you<00:00:06.779> through<00:00:07.109> the<00:00:07.230> sword

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
I'm gonna walk you through the sword

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.070 
I'm gonna walk you through the sword
Aria<00:00:07.919> cross<00:00:08.309> sword<00:00:08.760> Aria<00:00:09.150> Femi<00:00:09.510> Cola<00:00:09.809> is<00:00:10.050> a

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
Aria cross sword Aria Femi Cola is a

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.780 
Aria cross sword Aria Femi Cola is a
fungi<00:00:10.559> that<00:00:10.860> you're<00:00:10.980> gonna<00:00:11.099> find<00:00:11.429> in<00:00:11.670> the

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
fungi that you're gonna find in the

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.549 
fungi that you're gonna find in the
feces<00:00:12.210> of<00:00:12.389> herbivores<00:00:12.929> but<00:00:13.320> you're<00:00:13.410> also

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
feces of herbivores but you're also

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.680 
feces of herbivores but you're also
gonna<00:00:13.769> find<00:00:14.130> in<00:00:14.280> an<00:00:14.400> AP<00:00:14.730> Biology<00:00:15.240> classroom

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
gonna find in an AP Biology classroom

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.170 
gonna find in an AP Biology classroom
because<00:00:16.410> it's<00:00:16.560> easy<00:00:16.890> to<00:00:17.100> grow<00:00:17.400> and<00:00:17.699> it's<00:00:17.910> easy

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
because it's easy to grow and it's easy

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.670 
because it's easy to grow and it's easy
to<00:00:18.300> look<00:00:18.539> at<00:00:18.660> a<00:00:18.690> mutant<00:00:19.020> strain<00:00:19.140> and<00:00:19.590> how

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
to look at a mutant strain and how

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.320 
to look at a mutant strain and how
meiosis<00:00:20.250> occurs<00:00:20.609> and<00:00:20.939> so<00:00:21.029> what<00:00:21.180> you're<00:00:21.270> gonna

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
meiosis occurs and so what you're gonna

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.380 
meiosis occurs and so what you're gonna
do<00:00:21.630> is<00:00:21.869> a<00:00:21.900> cross<00:00:22.380> between<00:00:23.250> a<00:00:23.550> dark<00:00:24.060> or<00:00:24.330> a

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
do is a cross between a dark or a

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.450 
do is a cross between a dark or a
wild-type<00:00:24.990> wild-type<00:00:25.680> remember<00:00:26.220> is<00:00:26.310> what

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
wild-type wild-type remember is what

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.429 
wild-type wild-type remember is what
they<00:00:26.609> normally<00:00:27.210> look<00:00:27.359> like<00:00:27.420> and<00:00:27.840> then<00:00:27.990> a<00:00:28.019> tan

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
they normally look like and then a tan

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.160 
they normally look like and then a tan
type<00:00:28.920> of<00:00:29.130> fungi<00:00:29.550> and<00:00:29.849> as<00:00:30.390> these<00:00:30.570> grow<00:00:30.960> together

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
type of fungi and as these grow together

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.229 
type of fungi and as these grow together
the<00:00:31.859> spores<00:00:32.189> are<00:00:32.369> going<00:00:32.489> to<00:00:32.579> fuse<00:00:32.880> and<00:00:33.120> we're

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
the spores are going to fuse and we're

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.000 
the spores are going to fuse and we're
going<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.450> be<00:00:33.540> able<00:00:33.660> to<00:00:33.809> see<00:00:34.050> meiosis<00:00:34.590> occurs

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
going to be able to see meiosis occurs

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.000 
going to be able to see meiosis occurs
and<00:00:35.399> so<00:00:35.430> let's<00:00:36.239> look<00:00:36.600> at<00:00:36.719> meiosis<00:00:37.200> again<00:00:37.500> to

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
and so let's look at meiosis again to

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.590 
and so let's look at meiosis again to
remember<00:00:38.370> what<00:00:38.550> that<00:00:38.700> is<00:00:38.910> what<00:00:39.180> are<00:00:39.239> we<00:00:39.329> doing

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
remember what that is what are we doing

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.299 
remember what that is what are we doing
in<00:00:39.719> meiosis<00:00:39.960> remember<00:00:40.559> we're<00:00:40.739> starting<00:00:41.129> with

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
in meiosis remember we're starting with

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.389 
in meiosis remember we're starting with
a<00:00:41.340> diploid<00:00:41.910> nuclei<00:00:42.690> so<00:00:43.110> we're<00:00:43.260> gonna<00:00:43.350> have<00:00:43.649> two

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
a diploid nuclei so we're gonna have two

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.940 
a diploid nuclei so we're gonna have two
chromosomes<00:00:45.059> in<00:00:45.270> this<00:00:45.480> case<00:00:45.690> it'll<00:00:46.350> undergo

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
chromosomes in this case it'll undergo

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.160 
chromosomes in this case it'll undergo
DNA<00:00:47.820> replication<00:00:48.360> so<00:00:48.719> this<00:00:48.840> would<00:00:48.989> be<00:00:49.079> the

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
DNA replication so this would be the

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.660 
DNA replication so this would be the
centromere<00:00:49.739> and<00:00:49.770> here<00:00:50.100> going<00:00:50.219> to<00:00:50.309> be<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.520> two

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
centromere and here going to be the two

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.200 
centromere and here going to be the two
sister<00:00:51.090> chromatids<00:00:51.120> were<00:00:51.989> then<00:00:52.230> undergoing

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
sister chromatids were then undergoing

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.240 
sister chromatids were then undergoing
meiosis<00:00:54.210> 1<00:00:54.539> and<00:00:54.809> then<00:00:54.989> meiosis<00:00:55.530> 2<00:00:55.739> at<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.219> end

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
meiosis 1 and then meiosis 2 at the end

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.849 
meiosis 1 and then meiosis 2 at the end
of<00:00:56.699> meiosis<00:00:56.910> what<00:00:57.420> do<00:00:57.480> we<00:00:57.570> have<00:00:57.750> we<00:00:58.469> have<00:00:58.559> four

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
of meiosis what do we have we have four

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.290 
of meiosis what do we have we have four
cells<00:00:59.250> and<00:00:59.579> those<00:00:59.670> cells<00:00:59.730> are<00:01:00.090> going<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:00.239> be

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
cells and those cells are going to be

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.939 
cells and those cells are going to be
haploid<00:01:00.629> remember<00:01:01.350> they're<00:01:01.500> going<00:01:01.680> to<00:01:01.800> have

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
haploid remember they're going to have

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.520 
haploid remember they're going to have
1/2<00:01:02.879> of<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.300> genetic<00:01:03.750> information<00:01:03.930> that's

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
1/2 of the genetic information that's

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.350 
1/2 of the genetic information that's
going<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:04.710> be<00:01:04.860> found<00:01:05.100> in<00:01:05.309> that<00:01:05.400> diploid<00:01:06.299> parent

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
going to be found in that diploid parent

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.899 
going to be found in that diploid parent
cell<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:07.290> so<00:01:07.799> in<00:01:08.010> us<00:01:08.159> these<00:01:08.430> would<00:01:08.610> become

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
cell and so in us these would become

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.060 
cell and so in us these would become
sperm<00:01:09.330> and<00:01:09.750> egg<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.110> eventually<00:01:10.860> we<00:01:10.979> have

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
sperm and egg and eventually we have

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.500 
sperm and egg and eventually we have
fertilization<00:01:11.820> but<00:01:12.090> it's<00:01:12.240> going<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.420> be<00:01:12.479> a

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
fertilization but it's going to be a

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.300 
fertilization but it's going to be a
little<00:01:12.810> bit<00:01:12.930> different<00:01:13.170> in<00:01:13.590> these<00:01:13.830> fungi

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
little bit different in these fungi

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.460 
little bit different in these fungi
they're<00:01:14.939> going<00:01:15.150> to<00:01:15.210> be<00:01:15.330> haploid<00:01:15.600> in<00:01:16.080> general

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
they're going to be haploid in general

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.899 
they're going to be haploid in general
their<00:01:16.650> cells<00:01:16.890> are<00:01:17.070> all<00:01:17.280> going<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:17.580> be<00:01:17.700> haploid

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
their cells are all going to be haploid

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.200 
their cells are all going to be haploid
and<00:01:18.390> what<00:01:18.930> happens<00:01:19.320> is<00:01:19.560> one<00:01:20.070> haploid<00:01:20.610> cell<00:01:20.909> is

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
and what happens is one haploid cell is

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.210 
and what happens is one haploid cell is
going<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.420> fuse<00:01:21.750> with<00:01:21.780> another<00:01:22.350> haploid<00:01:22.920> cell

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
going to fuse with another haploid cell

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.710 
going to fuse with another haploid cell
and<00:01:23.549> then<00:01:23.790> we're<00:01:23.909> going<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.060> create<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.540> next

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
and then we're going to create the next

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.630 
and then we're going to create the next
generation<00:01:25.009> we're<00:01:26.009> still<00:01:26.250> going<00:01:26.430> to<00:01:26.520> have

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
generation we're still going to have

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.819 
generation we're still going to have
meiosis<00:01:27.270> and<00:01:27.570> fertilization<00:01:27.990> it's<00:01:28.590> it's

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
meiosis and fertilization it's it's

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.039 
meiosis and fertilization it's it's
going<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.100> give<00:01:29.280> us<00:01:29.400> recombination<00:01:30.270> again<00:01:30.540> but

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
going to give us recombination again but

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.859 
going to give us recombination again but
it<00:01:31.170> occurs<00:01:31.500> kind<00:01:31.799> of<00:01:31.860> in<00:01:31.950> a<00:01:32.040> different<00:01:32.869> the

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
it occurs kind of in a different the

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.480 
it occurs kind of in a different the
life<00:01:34.079> cycle<00:01:34.470> occurs<00:01:34.740> a<00:01:34.770> little<00:01:35.040> bit<00:01:35.159> different

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
life cycle occurs a little bit different

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.880 
life cycle occurs a little bit different
than<00:01:35.610> then<00:01:36.180> in<00:01:36.329> us<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:37.020> so<00:01:37.439> how<00:01:37.590> does<00:01:37.650> this

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
than then in us and so how does this

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.890 
than then in us and so how does this
occur<00:01:38.310> well<00:01:38.640> we're<00:01:38.820> gonna<00:01:38.909> have<00:01:39.210> one<00:01:39.540> cell

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
occur well we're gonna have one cell

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.230 
occur well we're gonna have one cell
that's<00:01:40.259> formed<00:01:40.710> by<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:40.890> fusion<00:01:41.189> of<00:01:41.700> a<00:01:41.820> spore

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
that's formed by the fusion of a spore

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.050 
that's formed by the fusion of a spore
from<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.259> wild<00:01:43.649> dark<00:01:44.009> type<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:44.549> one<00:01:44.790> from<00:01:45.000> the

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
from the wild dark type and one from the

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.910 
from the wild dark type and one from the
tan<00:01:45.390> type<00:01:45.689> and<00:01:45.930> so<00:01:46.049> what<00:01:46.200> they're<00:01:46.290> going<00:01:46.829> to

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
tan type and so what they're going to

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.340 
tan type and so what they're going to
deliver<00:01:47.130> is<00:01:47.640> a<00:01:47.909> chromosome<00:01:48.540> from<00:01:48.720> each<00:01:48.899> we<00:01:49.200> now

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
deliver is a chromosome from each we now

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.200 
deliver is a chromosome from each we now
have<00:01:49.590> two<00:01:49.860> chromosomes<00:01:50.430> you<00:01:50.579> have<00:01:50.700> a<00:01:50.759> diploid

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
have two chromosomes you have a diploid

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.330 
have two chromosomes you have a diploid
cell<00:01:51.240> that's<00:01:52.170> going<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.470> undergo<00:01:52.770> DNA

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
cell that's going to undergo DNA

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.249 
cell that's going to undergo DNA
replication<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.450> so<00:01:54.630> now<00:01:54.810> this<00:01:54.990> would<00:01:55.140> be<00:01:55.170> our

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
replication and so now this would be our

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.990 
replication and so now this would be our
centromere<00:01:55.890> here<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.430> this<00:01:56.549> is<00:01:56.670> going<00:01:56.790> to<00:01:56.880> be

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
centromere here and this is going to be

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.600 
centromere here and this is going to be
our<00:01:57.090> two<00:01:57.329> sister<00:01:57.869> chromatids<00:01:58.280> now<00:01:59.280> let's<00:01:59.490> say

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
our two sister chromatids now let's say

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.910 
our two sister chromatids now let's say
no<00:01:59.969> crossing<00:02:00.659> over<00:02:00.840> occurs<00:02:01.350> and<00:02:01.680> now<00:02:01.740> we're

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
no crossing over occurs and now we're

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.100 
no crossing over occurs and now we're
gonna<00:02:02.070> go<00:02:02.280> just<00:02:02.610> through<00:02:02.790> regular<00:02:03.420> meiosis

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
gonna go just through regular meiosis

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.109 
gonna go just through regular meiosis
those<00:02:04.500> are<00:02:04.680> gonna<00:02:04.799> split<00:02:05.219> in<00:02:05.340> half<00:02:05.579> this<00:02:05.969> is

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
those are gonna split in half this is

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.210 
those are gonna split in half this is
being<00:02:06.270> meiosis<00:02:06.899> one<00:02:07.140> and<00:02:07.920> then<00:02:08.039> we're<00:02:08.129> gonna

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
being meiosis one and then we're gonna

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.820 
being meiosis one and then we're gonna
have<00:02:08.429> meiosis<00:02:08.970> two<00:02:09.270> and<00:02:09.750> now<00:02:10.110> we<00:02:10.170> end<00:02:10.440> up<00:02:10.590> with

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
have meiosis two and now we end up with

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.020 
have meiosis two and now we end up with
these<00:02:11.069> four<00:02:11.430> cells<00:02:11.790> that<00:02:12.150> each<00:02:12.420> are

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
these four cells that each are

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.690 
these four cells that each are
loyd<00:02:13.300> in<00:02:13.630> relation<00:02:14.170> to<00:02:14.200> that<00:02:14.320> fuse<00:02:14.770> cell<00:02:15.100> but

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
loyd in relation to that fuse cell but

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.370 
loyd in relation to that fuse cell but
something<00:02:16.030> weird<00:02:16.240> happens<00:02:16.750> here<00:02:17.020> in<00:02:17.110> sword

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
something weird happens here in sword

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.200 
something weird happens here in sword
Aria<00:02:17.770> what's<00:02:18.340> gonna<00:02:18.460> happen<00:02:18.880> is<00:02:19.000> we're<00:02:19.150> gonna

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.210 
Aria what's gonna happen is we're gonna

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.390 
Aria what's gonna happen is we're gonna
have<00:02:19.330> another<00:02:19.720> mitotic<00:02:20.410> division<00:02:20.890> so<00:02:21.070> each<00:02:21.250> of

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
have another mitotic division so each of

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.560 
have another mitotic division so each of
these<00:02:21.490> chromosomes<00:02:21.940> are<00:02:22.270> going<00:02:22.300> to<00:02:22.420> be

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
these chromosomes are going to be

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:25.230 
these chromosomes are going to be
replicated<00:02:23.380> and<00:02:23.500> so<00:02:24.130> we're<00:02:24.250> gonna<00:02:24.340> have<00:02:24.670> four

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240 
replicated and so we're gonna have four

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.620 
replicated and so we're gonna have four
cells<00:02:25.810> and<00:02:26.230> therefore<00:02:26.890> four<00:02:27.520> spores<00:02:28.090> that<00:02:28.390> are

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
cells and therefore four spores that are

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.960 
cells and therefore four spores that are
going<00:02:28.780> to<00:02:28.870> be<00:02:28.990> of<00:02:29.170> the<00:02:29.350> tan<00:02:29.680> type<00:02:30.100> and<00:02:30.370> then

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
going to be of the tan type and then

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.820 
going to be of the tan type and then
four<00:02:31.360> that<00:02:31.540> are<00:02:31.600> gonna<00:02:31.780> be<00:02:31.990> of<00:02:32.110> this<00:02:32.260> dark<00:02:32.560> and

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
four that are gonna be of this dark and

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.710 
four that are gonna be of this dark and
mutant<00:02:33.220> type<00:02:33.459> and<00:02:33.790> so<00:02:34.120> if<00:02:34.209> you<00:02:34.330> ever<00:02:34.450> get<00:02:34.660> a

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
mutant type and so if you ever get a

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.710 
mutant type and so if you ever get a
four<00:02:35.110> to<00:02:35.410> four<00:02:35.680> ratio<00:02:35.920> of<00:02:36.250> spores<00:02:36.610> no<00:02:37.209> crossing

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
four to four ratio of spores no crossing

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.780 
four to four ratio of spores no crossing
over<00:02:37.870> occurred<00:02:38.380> but<00:02:39.040> it<00:02:39.100> could<00:02:39.370> have<00:02:39.490> occurred

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
over occurred but it could have occurred

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:40.949 
over occurred but it could have occurred
in<00:02:39.910> a<00:02:40.030> different<00:02:40.360> way<00:02:40.450> it<00:02:40.630> could<00:02:40.840> have

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
in a different way it could have

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.020 
in a different way it could have
occurred<00:02:41.290> with<00:02:41.500> the<00:02:41.650> dark<00:02:42.010> on<00:02:42.250> the<00:02:42.490> top<00:02:42.520> and

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
occurred with the dark on the top and

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.820 
occurred with the dark on the top and
the<00:02:43.209> tan<00:02:43.450> on<00:02:43.480> the<00:02:43.750> bottom<00:02:44.080> and<00:02:44.320> what<00:02:44.530> would<00:02:44.709> we

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
the tan on the bottom and what would we

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.180 
the tan on the bottom and what would we
get<00:02:45.010> we'd<00:02:45.400> still<00:02:45.700> get<00:02:45.910> a<00:02:45.940> four<00:02:46.330> to<00:02:46.570> four<00:02:47.190> spore

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
get we'd still get a four to four spore

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.510 
get we'd still get a four to four spore
ratio<00:02:48.640> of<00:02:48.850> the<00:02:49.300> dark<00:02:49.630> to<00:02:49.989> the<00:02:50.020> tan<00:02:50.410> and<00:02:50.650> so<00:02:51.250> kind

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
ratio of the dark to the tan and so kind

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.250 
ratio of the dark to the tan and so kind
of<00:02:51.610> remember<00:02:52.060> these<00:02:52.180> if<00:02:52.480> you<00:02:52.630> ever<00:02:52.780> have<00:02:52.959> four

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
of remember these if you ever have four

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.160 
of remember these if you ever have four
to<00:02:53.380> four<00:02:53.620> no<00:02:54.190> crossing<00:02:54.790> over<00:02:54.910> occurred<00:02:55.390> now

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
to four no crossing over occurred now

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:57.720 
to four no crossing over occurred now
let's<00:02:56.380> look<00:02:56.500> at<00:02:56.650> how<00:02:56.739> crossing<00:02:57.190> over<00:02:57.310> could

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
let's look at how crossing over could

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.420 
let's look at how crossing over could
occur<00:02:58.090> so<00:02:58.390> we<00:02:58.420> began<00:02:59.050> with<00:02:59.440> those<00:02:59.709> those<00:03:00.160> that

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
occur so we began with those those that

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.670 
occur so we began with those those that
are<00:03:00.580> copied<00:03:01.060> but<00:03:01.239> we<00:03:01.390> have<00:03:01.600> remember<00:03:02.050> crossing

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
are copied but we have remember crossing

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.890 
are copied but we have remember crossing
over<00:03:02.890> occurring<00:03:03.430> right<00:03:03.640> here<00:03:04.030> and<00:03:04.180> so<00:03:04.750> when

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
over occurring right here and so when

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.330 
over occurring right here and so when
you're<00:03:04.989> crossing<00:03:05.290> over<00:03:05.590> we're<00:03:05.950> going<00:03:06.070> to<00:03:06.130> take

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
you're crossing over we're going to take

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.130 
you're crossing over we're going to take
parts<00:03:06.700> of<00:03:06.820> one<00:03:07.060> and<00:03:07.330> switch<00:03:07.660> that<00:03:07.690> with

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
parts of one and switch that with

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.250 
parts of one and switch that with
another<00:03:08.500> and<00:03:08.860> so<00:03:09.400> as<00:03:09.550> we<00:03:09.730> do<00:03:09.970> that<00:03:10.000> we<00:03:10.690> now<00:03:10.900> have

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
another and so as we do that we now have

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.550 
another and so as we do that we now have
a<00:03:12.270> recombinant<00:03:13.270> chromosome<00:03:13.870> and<00:03:14.110> so<00:03:14.200> it's<00:03:14.440> a

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
a recombinant chromosome and so it's a

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.610 
a recombinant chromosome and so it's a
mix<00:03:14.830> between<00:03:15.040> the<00:03:15.280> the<00:03:15.850> tan<00:03:16.120> and<00:03:16.480> the<00:03:16.660> dark<00:03:16.870> how

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
mix between the the tan and the dark how

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.199 
mix between the the tan and the dark how
does<00:03:17.769> this<00:03:17.950> play<00:03:18.250> out<00:03:18.280> as<00:03:18.670> we<00:03:18.820> go<00:03:18.940> through

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
does this play out as we go through

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:21.420 
does this play out as we go through
meiosis<00:03:19.390> one<00:03:19.989> and<00:03:20.260> meiosis<00:03:20.560> 2<00:03:20.980> and<00:03:21.190> finally

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
meiosis one and meiosis 2 and finally

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.539 
meiosis one and meiosis 2 and finally
mitosis<00:03:22.299> what<00:03:22.570> you<00:03:22.690> get<00:03:22.959> are<00:03:23.650> two<00:03:24.040> spores<00:03:24.430> that

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549 
mitosis what you get are two spores that

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:27.150 
mitosis what you get are two spores that
are<00:03:24.700> going<00:03:24.880> to<00:03:24.940> be<00:03:25.030> tan<00:03:25.299> to<00:03:25.810> dark<00:03:26.049> to<00:03:26.260> tan<00:03:26.739> to

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
are going to be tan to dark to tan to

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.340 
are going to be tan to dark to tan to
dark<00:03:27.400> now<00:03:28.269> it<00:03:28.480> doesn't<00:03:28.810> have<00:03:28.930> to<00:03:29.049> occur

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
dark now it doesn't have to occur

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.320 
dark now it doesn't have to occur
specifically<00:03:30.070> in<00:03:30.220> that<00:03:30.250> way<00:03:30.610> we<00:03:30.910> could<00:03:31.090> have

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 
specifically in that way we could have

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.750 
specifically in that way we could have
the<00:03:31.660> recombined<00:03:32.290> chromosomes<00:03:32.980> end<00:03:33.280> up<00:03:33.459> on<00:03:33.640> the

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
the recombined chromosomes end up on the

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.910 
the recombined chromosomes end up on the
end<00:03:33.970> so<00:03:34.360> up<00:03:34.540> here<00:03:34.840> and<00:03:35.019> down<00:03:35.140> here<00:03:35.200> what's<00:03:35.830> that

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
end so up here and down here what's that

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.600 
end so up here and down here what's that
going<00:03:36.190> to<00:03:36.250> create<00:03:36.430> still<00:03:37.239> a<00:03:37.269> 2<00:03:37.690> 2<00:03:37.840> 2<00:03:37.989> 2<00:03:38.019> 2<00:03:38.230> 2<00:03:38.380> 2<00:03:38.610> or

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:39.610 
going to create still a 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 or

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.190 
going to create still a 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 or
it<00:03:39.760> could<00:03:39.940> occur<00:03:40.209> like<00:03:40.420> this<00:03:40.690> where<00:03:41.019> we<00:03:41.170> have

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
it could occur like this where we have

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.990 
it could occur like this where we have
one<00:03:41.620> of<00:03:41.709> the<00:03:41.769> recombinants<00:03:42.430> on<00:03:42.519> the<00:03:42.640> inside

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
one of the recombinants on the inside

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.970 
one of the recombinants on the inside
and<00:03:43.480> on<00:03:43.660> the<00:03:43.690> outside<00:03:43.930> of<00:03:44.290> this<00:03:44.410> other<00:03:44.620> one<00:03:44.799> and

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
and on the outside of this other one and

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.490 
and on the outside of this other one and
we<00:03:45.190> get<00:03:45.310> a<00:03:45.340> 2<00:03:45.579> 2<00:03:45.730> 4<00:03:45.940> 2<00:03:46.060> 2<00:03:46.269> or<00:03:46.930> it<00:03:47.110> could<00:03:47.260> occur

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
we get a 2 2 4 2 2 or it could occur

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:48.990 
we get a 2 2 4 2 2 or it could occur
like<00:03:47.680> this<00:03:47.950> and<00:03:48.310> so<00:03:48.430> these<00:03:48.549> are<00:03:48.700> going<00:03:48.790> to<00:03:48.880> be

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
like this and so these are going to be

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.110 
like this and so these are going to be
four<00:03:49.450> ways<00:03:49.810> that<00:03:50.310> recombination<00:03:51.310> or<00:03:51.549> crossing

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
four ways that recombination or crossing

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.569 
four ways that recombination or crossing
over<00:03:52.269> can<00:03:52.720> create<00:03:53.079> these<00:03:53.320> new<00:03:53.620> and<00:03:54.040> remember

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:54.579 
over can create these new and remember

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:56.880 
over can create these new and remember
these<00:03:54.670> are<00:03:54.730> called<00:03:55.030> a<00:03:55.269> sky<00:03:55.660> which<00:03:56.650> are<00:03:56.769> going

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:56.890 
these are called a sky which are going

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:58.740 
these are called a sky which are going
to<00:03:56.950> be<00:03:57.070> these<00:03:57.280> eight<00:03:57.610> spores<00:03:58.180> found<00:03:58.540> within

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
to be these eight spores found within

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.539 
to be these eight spores found within
the<00:03:58.959> para<00:03:59.170> the--some<00:03:59.590> of<00:03:59.769> the<00:03:59.860> sword<00:04:00.070> Daria

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:00.549 
the para the--some of the sword Daria

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:03.060 
the para the--some of the sword Daria
okay<00:04:01.329> and<00:04:01.510> so<00:04:01.630> how<00:04:01.810> does<00:04:01.870> this<00:04:02.110> lab<00:04:02.410> layout

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:03.070 
okay and so how does this lab layout

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:06.030 
okay and so how does this lab layout
well<00:04:04.000> let<00:04:04.329> me<00:04:04.360> show<00:04:04.630> you<00:04:04.690> but<00:04:04.959> before<00:04:05.110> that<00:04:05.500> let

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
well let me show you but before that let

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.530 
well let me show you but before that let
me<00:04:06.070> talk<00:04:06.250> about<00:04:06.489> the<00:04:06.579> importance<00:04:07.000> of<00:04:07.120> crossing

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
me talk about the importance of crossing

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.170 
me talk about the importance of crossing
over<00:04:07.690> remember<00:04:08.320> Thomas<00:04:08.590> Hunt<00:04:08.860> Morgan<00:04:08.920> and<00:04:09.459> his

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
over remember Thomas Hunt Morgan and his

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:11.550 
over remember Thomas Hunt Morgan and his
student<00:04:10.510> Alfred<00:04:10.810> Sturtevant<00:04:11.049> were<00:04:11.410> the

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
student Alfred Sturtevant were the

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.259 
student Alfred Sturtevant were the
people<00:04:11.860> who<00:04:11.890> figured<00:04:12.370> out<00:04:12.489> the<00:04:12.549> importance<00:04:13.150> of

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:13.269 
people who figured out the importance of

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:15.569 
people who figured out the importance of
this<00:04:13.450> so<00:04:13.690> as<00:04:13.840> those<00:04:14.200> chromosomes<00:04:14.769> cross<00:04:15.070> over

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:15.579 
this so as those chromosomes cross over

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:17.550 
this so as those chromosomes cross over
they<00:04:16.269> literally<00:04:16.660> are<00:04:16.780> creating<00:04:17.320> new

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
they literally are creating new

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.050 
they literally are creating new
chromosomes<00:04:18.220> that<00:04:18.400> haven't<00:04:18.609> been<00:04:18.700> built

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
chromosomes that haven't been built

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.390 
chromosomes that haven't been built
before<00:04:19.269> and<00:04:19.720> that<00:04:19.900> gives<00:04:20.109> us<00:04:20.400> recombination

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
before and that gives us recombination

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.790 
before and that gives us recombination
if<00:04:22.270> two<00:04:22.570> genes<00:04:22.599> happen<00:04:23.260> to<00:04:23.349> be<00:04:23.440> on<00:04:23.530> the<00:04:23.650> same

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
if two genes happen to be on the same

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.840 
if two genes happen to be on the same
chromosome<00:04:24.250> then<00:04:25.150> they<00:04:25.570> would

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
chromosome then they would

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:27.610 
chromosome then they would
tend<00:04:26.330> to<00:04:26.510> travel<00:04:26.900> through<00:04:27.080> time<00:04:27.110> together

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
tend to travel through time together

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.320 
tend to travel through time together
they<00:04:27.890> would<00:04:27.980> be<00:04:28.130> linked<00:04:28.460> genes<00:04:28.550> but<00:04:29.060> crossing

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
they would be linked genes but crossing

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.180 
they would be linked genes but crossing
over<00:04:29.720> is<00:04:29.960> a<00:04:29.990> way<00:04:30.200> for<00:04:30.470> us<00:04:30.530> to<00:04:30.770> get<00:04:30.860> variation

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
over is a way for us to get variation

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.610 
over is a way for us to get variation
between<00:04:31.790> that<00:04:32.030> and<00:04:32.270> so<00:04:32.810> what<00:04:32.900> we<00:04:33.020> can<00:04:33.140> look<00:04:33.380> at

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620 
between that and so what we can look at

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.800 
between that and so what we can look at
is<00:04:33.830> the<00:04:33.860> frequency<00:04:34.580> of<00:04:34.700> crossover<00:04:35.480> and<00:04:35.510> that

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
is the frequency of crossover and that

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:37.630 
is the frequency of crossover and that
tells<00:04:36.050> us<00:04:36.200> how<00:04:36.410> far<00:04:36.740> those<00:04:37.040> genes<00:04:37.370> are<00:04:37.520> going

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:37.640 
tells us how far those genes are going

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.820 
tells us how far those genes are going
to<00:04:37.700> be<00:04:37.820> a<00:04:37.850> part<00:04:38.150> on<00:04:38.330> the<00:04:38.420> same<00:04:38.600> chromosome<00:04:39.020> now

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
to be a part on the same chromosome now

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.160 
to be a part on the same chromosome now
in<00:04:39.950> this<00:04:40.100> case<00:04:40.340> we're<00:04:40.580> not<00:04:40.610> looking<00:04:41.120> at<00:04:41.170> insert

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:42.170 
in this case we're not looking at insert

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:44.650 
in this case we're not looking at insert
Darya<00:04:42.590> we're<00:04:42.800> not<00:04:43.250> looking<00:04:43.610> at<00:04:43.760> two<00:04:44.300> genes

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
Darya we're not looking at two genes

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.270 
Darya we're not looking at two genes
we're<00:04:44.990> looking<00:04:45.260> at<00:04:45.380> one<00:04:45.590> gene<00:04:45.860> but<00:04:45.920> we're

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:46.280 
we're looking at one gene but we're

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:47.920 
we're looking at one gene but we're
looking<00:04:46.550> at<00:04:46.670> the<00:04:46.760> crossover<00:04:47.420> and<00:04:47.660> so<00:04:47.780> we're

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 
looking at the crossover and so we're

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:49.330 
looking at the crossover and so we're
looking<00:04:48.050> to<00:04:48.380> measure<00:04:48.560> the<00:04:48.800> distance<00:04:49.250> between

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 
looking to measure the distance between

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.300 
looking to measure the distance between
the<00:04:49.790> gene<00:04:50.090> and<00:04:50.450> the<00:04:51.040> centromere<00:04:52.040> which<00:04:52.190> is

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.310 
the gene and the centromere which is

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:54.160 
the gene and the centromere which is
going<00:04:52.400> to<00:04:52.460> be<00:04:52.610> that<00:04:52.940> connection<00:04:53.540> between<00:04:53.900> the

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:54.170 
going to be that connection between the

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:56.170 
going to be that connection between the
two<00:04:54.320> chromosomes<00:04:54.740> and<00:04:55.100> so<00:04:55.610> this<00:04:55.820> is<00:04:55.970> how<00:04:56.120> the

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:56.180 
two chromosomes and so this is how the

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:57.910 
two chromosomes and so this is how the
data<00:04:56.390> is<00:04:56.600> presented<00:04:56.720> what<00:04:57.260> you<00:04:57.380> would<00:04:57.530> do<00:04:57.680> is

00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:57.920 
data is presented what you would do is

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.680 
data is presented what you would do is
say<00:04:57.950> these<00:04:58.370> pair<00:04:58.640> the--some<00:04:59.090> you<00:04:59.360> put<00:04:59.570> them

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
say these pair the--some you put them

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:02.890 
say these pair the--some you put them
underneath<00:04:59.990> a<00:05:00.500> glass<00:05:01.270> slide<00:05:02.270> and<00:05:02.300> you<00:05:02.630> push

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:02.900 
underneath a glass slide and you push

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:04.660 
underneath a glass slide and you push
down<00:05:02.930> with<00:05:03.470> it<00:05:03.620> and<00:05:03.980> you<00:05:04.220> kind<00:05:04.340> of<00:05:04.460> get<00:05:04.580> this

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:04.670 
down with it and you kind of get this

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:06.700 
down with it and you kind of get this
explosion<00:05:05.540> of<00:05:05.690> these<00:05:05.780> a<00:05:05.840> sky<00:05:06.320> and<00:05:06.500> you<00:05:06.590> can

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710 
explosion of these a sky and you can

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:08.950 
explosion of these a sky and you can
start<00:05:06.920> to<00:05:07.040> count<00:05:07.220> them<00:05:07.490> and<00:05:07.670> so<00:05:08.240> you<00:05:08.540> you<00:05:08.810> may

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
start to count them and so you you may

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.930 
start to count them and so you you may
want<00:05:08.990> to<00:05:09.230> pause<00:05:09.380> the<00:05:09.620> video<00:05:09.740> here<00:05:09.920> how<00:05:10.550> many<00:05:10.610> of

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:10.940 
want to pause the video here how many of

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:15.010 
want to pause the video here how many of
these<00:05:11.090> a<00:05:11.150> sky<00:05:11.720> are<00:05:12.260> gonna<00:05:12.530> be<00:05:12.940> parental<00:05:13.940> or<00:05:14.390> no

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.020 
these a sky are gonna be parental or no

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:16.660 
these a sky are gonna be parental or no
crossing<00:05:15.500> over<00:05:15.680> and<00:05:15.950> how<00:05:16.100> many<00:05:16.340> of<00:05:16.460> them<00:05:16.580> are

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:16.670 
crossing over and how many of them are

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:18.670 
crossing over and how many of them are
going<00:05:16.760> to<00:05:16.820> be<00:05:16.940> crossing<00:05:17.210> over<00:05:17.570> so<00:05:18.470> you<00:05:18.530> may

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:18.680 
going to be crossing over so you may

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.050 
going to be crossing over so you may
want<00:05:18.860> to<00:05:18.920> count<00:05:19.160> those<00:05:19.310> out<00:05:19.520> because<00:05:19.730> that's<00:05:19.880> a

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.060 
want to count those out because that's a

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:21.750 
want to count those out because that's a
skill<00:05:20.390> that<00:05:20.420> you<00:05:20.630> should<00:05:20.780> be<00:05:20.870> able<00:05:20.990> to<00:05:21.110> pick<00:05:21.320> up

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:21.760 
skill that you should be able to pick up

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.910 
skill that you should be able to pick up
so<00:05:22.760> I'll<00:05:22.910> pause<00:05:23.150> for<00:05:23.180> a<00:05:23.510> little<00:05:23.750> bit<00:05:23.900> and<00:05:24.140> so

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:24.920 
so I'll pause for a little bit and so

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:26.800 
so I'll pause for a little bit and so
what<00:05:25.190> you<00:05:25.310> should<00:05:25.580> have<00:05:25.700> found<00:05:26.000> is<00:05:26.390> that<00:05:26.450> there

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:26.810 
what you should have found is that there

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.130 
what you should have found is that there
are<00:05:26.990> eight<00:05:27.910> ascus<00:05:28.910> that<00:05:29.090> show<00:05:29.270> no<00:05:29.570> crossing

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:30.140 
are eight ascus that show no crossing

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:32.440 
are eight ascus that show no crossing
over<00:05:30.290> and<00:05:30.620> they're<00:05:31.130> gonna<00:05:31.280> be<00:05:31.490> ten<00:05:31.910> that<00:05:32.270> show

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:32.450 
over and they're gonna be ten that show

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:34.750 
over and they're gonna be ten that show
crossing<00:05:33.110> over<00:05:33.290> and<00:05:33.560> so<00:05:34.040> how<00:05:34.370> do<00:05:34.430> we<00:05:34.580> know

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:34.760 
crossing over and so how do we know

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.730 
crossing over and so how do we know
again<00:05:35.090> the<00:05:35.360> no<00:05:35.510> crossing<00:05:35.930> over<00:05:36.080> it's<00:05:36.290> at<00:05:36.410> four

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:36.740 
again the no crossing over it's at four

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:39.550 
again the no crossing over it's at four
to<00:05:36.920> four<00:05:37.220> and<00:05:37.550> then<00:05:38.240> the<00:05:38.600> yes<00:05:38.990> crossing<00:05:39.410> over

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:39.560 
to four and then the yes crossing over

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.110 
to four and then the yes crossing over
we're<00:05:39.740> going<00:05:39.830> to<00:05:39.890> have<00:05:40.120> different

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.120 
we're going to have different

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.760 
we're going to have different
combinations<00:05:41.720> sometimes<00:05:42.200> two<00:05:42.440> two<00:05:42.590> two<00:05:42.740> two

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:42.770 
combinations sometimes two two two two

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:44.710 
combinations sometimes two two two two
two<00:05:42.890> two<00:05:43.040> two<00:05:43.190> and<00:05:43.640> sometimes<00:05:43.850> two<00:05:44.270> to<00:05:44.300> four<00:05:44.600> to

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:44.720 
two two two and sometimes two to four to

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:47.290 
two two two and sometimes two to four to
two<00:05:44.980> why<00:05:45.980> is<00:05:46.040> that<00:05:46.190> important<00:05:46.910> well<00:05:46.940> now<00:05:47.240> we

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:47.300 
two why is that important well now we

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.630 
two why is that important well now we
can<00:05:47.600> start<00:05:47.810> to<00:05:47.930> plug<00:05:48.140> in<00:05:48.320> our<00:05:48.440> data<00:05:48.770> and<00:05:49.100> so<00:05:49.580> if

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:49.640 
can start to plug in our data and so if

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.190 
can start to plug in our data and so if
we<00:05:49.790> look<00:05:50.030> at<00:05:50.120> this<00:05:50.270> chart<00:05:50.600> this<00:05:50.810> is<00:05:50.870> from<00:05:51.110> the

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:51.200 
we look at this chart this is from the

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.230 
we look at this chart this is from the
AP<00:05:51.440> Biology<00:05:51.920> slab<00:05:52.280> book<00:05:52.550> we<00:05:52.790> start<00:05:53.090> with<00:05:53.210> a

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:53.240 
AP Biology slab book we start with a

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.120 
AP Biology slab book we start with a
number<00:05:53.630> of<00:05:53.720> a<00:05:53.870> sky<00:05:54.200> that<00:05:54.230> are<00:05:54.560> showing<00:05:54.770> no

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:55.130 
number of a sky that are showing no

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:57.430 
number of a sky that are showing no
crossing<00:05:55.760> over<00:05:55.940> and<00:05:56.270> how<00:05:56.840> many<00:05:57.020> was<00:05:57.200> that

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:57.440 
crossing over and how many was that

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.920 
crossing over and how many was that
remember<00:05:58.010> we<00:05:58.160> said<00:05:58.370> eight<00:05:58.880> how<00:05:59.630> many<00:05:59.810> are

00:05:59.920 --> 00:05:59.930 
remember we said eight how many are

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:02.860 
remember we said eight how many are
showing<00:06:00.350> crossing<00:06:00.830> over<00:06:01.010> ten<00:06:01.940> and<00:06:02.210> so<00:06:02.750> how

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:02.870 
showing crossing over ten and so how

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:05.680 
showing crossing over ten and so how
many<00:06:02.930> total<00:06:03.350> a<00:06:03.650> sky<00:06:03.890> did<00:06:04.100> we<00:06:04.220> count<00:06:04.460> 18<00:06:05.360> now

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:05.690 
many total a sky did we count 18 now

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:07.510 
many total a sky did we count 18 now
this<00:06:05.840> is<00:06:05.990> not<00:06:06.170> a<00:06:06.440> big<00:06:06.710> enough<00:06:06.950> number<00:06:07.160> you

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:07.520 
this is not a big enough number you

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.730 
this is not a big enough number you
should<00:06:07.730> count<00:06:07.970> at<00:06:08.240> least<00:06:08.270> 50<00:06:09.140> of<00:06:09.230> these<00:06:09.320> to<00:06:09.590> get

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:09.740 
should count at least 50 of these to get

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.220 
should count at least 50 of these to get
good<00:06:09.980> data<00:06:10.240> but<00:06:11.240> let's<00:06:11.420> just<00:06:11.660> use<00:06:11.840> the<00:06:12.020> data

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:12.230 
good data but let's just use the data

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:13.780 
good data but let's just use the data
right<00:06:12.500> here<00:06:12.560> next<00:06:13.100> thing<00:06:13.280> we're<00:06:13.430> gonna<00:06:13.490> figure

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:13.790 
right here next thing we're gonna figure

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:16.750 
right here next thing we're gonna figure
out<00:06:13.910> is<00:06:14.150> the<00:06:14.300> percent<00:06:14.720> of<00:06:14.930> cross<00:06:15.200> over<00:06:15.760> now

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:16.760 
out is the percent of cross over now

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.700 
out is the percent of cross over now
what's<00:06:16.940> interesting<00:06:17.150> is<00:06:17.600> since<00:06:17.930> we<00:06:18.170> undergo

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:18.710 
what's interesting is since we undergo

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:21.850 
what's interesting is since we undergo
that<00:06:18.890> mitosis<00:06:19.850> in<00:06:20.180> sword<00:06:20.900> Aria<00:06:21.260> we<00:06:21.470> have<00:06:21.680> to

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:21.860 
that mitosis in sword Aria we have to

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:23.410 
that mitosis in sword Aria we have to
take<00:06:22.010> that<00:06:22.190> crossing<00:06:22.580> over<00:06:22.730> number<00:06:23.150> and<00:06:23.330> we

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:23.420 
take that crossing over number and we

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:25.720 
take that crossing over number and we
have<00:06:23.570> to<00:06:23.750> divide<00:06:24.020> it<00:06:24.050> by<00:06:24.230> two<00:06:24.290> and<00:06:24.800> so<00:06:25.520> how<00:06:25.670> do

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:25.730 
have to divide it by two and so how do

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:27.570 
have to divide it by two and so how do
we<00:06:25.850> figure<00:06:26.030> out<00:06:26.150> a<00:06:26.270> percent<00:06:26.690> of<00:06:26.840> cross<00:06:27.050> over

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:27.580 
we figure out a percent of cross over

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:29.740 
we figure out a percent of cross over
what<00:06:28.580> we're<00:06:28.700> gonna<00:06:28.790> do<00:06:29.000> is<00:06:29.120> take<00:06:29.270> the<00:06:29.450> total

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:29.750 
what we're gonna do is take the total

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:32.350 
what we're gonna do is take the total
showing<00:06:30.200> cross<00:06:30.410> over<00:06:30.800> which<00:06:30.980> is<00:06:31.130> 10<00:06:31.430> divided

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:32.360 
showing cross over which is 10 divided

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.840 
showing cross over which is 10 divided
by<00:06:32.390> that<00:06:32.780> by<00:06:33.140> the<00:06:33.200> total<00:06:33.590> number<00:06:33.800> so<00:06:34.400> that's<00:06:34.490> 10

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:34.850 
by that by the total number so that's 10

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:38.820 
by that by the total number so that's 10
over<00:06:35.090> 18<00:06:35.540> and<00:06:35.840> I<00:06:35.960> get<00:06:36.200> around<00:06:37.479> 57

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:38.830 
over 18 and I get around 57

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:41.580 
over 18 and I get around 57
and<00:06:39.540> after<00:06:40.540> I've<00:06:40.630> done<00:06:40.750> that<00:06:40.810> I<00:06:40.990> divide<00:06:41.410> that

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:41.590 
and after I've done that I divide that

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:44.790 
and after I've done that I divide that
in<00:06:41.800> two<00:06:42.070> and<00:06:42.400> I<00:06:42.490> get<00:06:42.640> around<00:06:42.940> 28%<00:06:43.720> and<00:06:44.470> so

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:44.800 
in two and I get around 28% and so

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.430 
in two and I get around 28% and so
that's<00:06:45.010> going<00:06:45.190> to<00:06:45.340> be<00:06:45.520> not<00:06:45.820> only<00:06:46.240> our<00:06:46.570> percent

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:47.440 
that's going to be not only our percent

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:49.320 
that's going to be not only our percent
crossover<00:06:47.950> divided<00:06:48.310> by<00:06:48.400> 2<00:06:48.460> but<00:06:49.000> that's<00:06:49.120> going

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:49.330 
crossover divided by 2 but that's going

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.210 
crossover divided by 2 but that's going
to<00:06:49.390> be<00:06:49.480> our<00:06:49.660> gene<00:06:49.960> distance<00:06:50.680> or<00:06:50.860> that's<00:06:51.010> going

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:51.220 
to be our gene distance or that's going

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:54.440 
to be our gene distance or that's going
to<00:06:51.280> be<00:06:51.400> the<00:06:51.550> map<00:06:51.850> units<00:06:52.360> from<00:06:52.630> the<00:06:52.840> gene<00:06:53.220> to<00:06:54.220> the

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:54.450 
to be the map units from the gene to the

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:57.990 
to be the map units from the gene to the
centromere<00:06:55.450> and<00:06:55.690> so<00:06:56.530> again<00:06:56.800> we<00:06:56.980> that<00:06:57.490> crossing

00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:58.000 
centromere and so again we that crossing

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.180 
centromere and so again we that crossing
over<00:06:58.150> is<00:06:58.360> a<00:06:58.390> random<00:06:59.050> event<00:06:59.200> and<00:06:59.710> so<00:06:59.860> if<00:06:59.920> we<00:07:00.040> can

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:00.190 
over is a random event and so if we can

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:02.250 
over is a random event and so if we can
look<00:07:00.430> at<00:07:00.610> how<00:07:00.820> how<00:07:01.270> often<00:07:01.510> this<00:07:01.750> is<00:07:01.900> occurring

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:02.260 
look at how how often this is occurring

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.140 
look at how how often this is occurring
we<00:07:02.620> can<00:07:02.770> figure<00:07:02.950> out<00:07:03.070> how<00:07:03.310> far<00:07:03.550> that<00:07:03.670> gene<00:07:03.940> is

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:04.150 
we can figure out how far that gene is

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:06.210 
we can figure out how far that gene is
away<00:07:04.480> from<00:07:04.720> the<00:07:04.840> center<00:07:05.230> of<00:07:05.260> the<00:07:05.500> chromosome

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:06.220 
away from the center of the chromosome

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:08.580 
away from the center of the chromosome
what's<00:07:06.700> the<00:07:06.790> accepted<00:07:07.330> value<00:07:07.450> in<00:07:08.290> the<00:07:08.440> lab

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:08.590 
what's the accepted value in the lab

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:10.530 
what's the accepted value in the lab
book<00:07:08.770> it<00:07:08.890> says<00:07:09.070> it's<00:07:09.250> around<00:07:09.490> 26<00:07:10.060> and<00:07:10.270> so<00:07:10.360> this

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:10.540 
book it says it's around 26 and so this

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:13.800 
book it says it's around 26 and so this
is<00:07:10.690> not<00:07:10.840> correct<00:07:11.580> and<00:07:12.580> that's<00:07:12.850> because<00:07:13.390> not

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:13.810 
is not correct and that's because not

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:15.450 
is not correct and that's because not
only<00:07:13.840> did<00:07:14.260> we<00:07:14.320> have<00:07:14.500> a<00:07:14.530> small<00:07:14.860> sample<00:07:15.070> size<00:07:15.430> but

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:15.460 
only did we have a small sample size but

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:18.330 
only did we have a small sample size but
it's<00:07:16.240> data<00:07:16.480> that<00:07:16.660> I<00:07:16.900> just<00:07:17.140> made<00:07:17.470> up<00:07:17.530> so<00:07:18.250> we

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:18.340 
it's data that I just made up so we

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:20.130 
it's data that I just made up so we
could<00:07:18.490> do<00:07:18.580> an<00:07:18.700> animation<00:07:19.060> of<00:07:19.360> it<00:07:19.450> and<00:07:19.780> so

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:20.140 
could do an animation of it and so

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:21.930 
could do an animation of it and so
that's<00:07:20.320> the<00:07:20.410> Sirdar<00:07:20.800> you<00:07:20.950> across<00:07:21.190> you<00:07:21.790> may

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:21.940 
that's the Sirdar you across you may

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:23.880 
that's the Sirdar you across you may
want<00:07:22.120> out<00:07:22.240> that<00:07:22.450> go<00:07:22.720> out<00:07:22.870> there<00:07:23.080> Google<00:07:23.560> soared

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:23.890 
want out that go out there Google soared

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:25.440 
want out that go out there Google soared
re<00:07:24.100> across<00:07:24.520> and<00:07:24.790> you'll<00:07:24.880> find<00:07:25.090> all<00:07:25.240> these

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:25.450 
re across and you'll find all these

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:27.780 
re across and you'll find all these
images<00:07:26.050> and<00:07:26.290> you<00:07:26.710> can<00:07:26.860> try<00:07:27.040> to<00:07:27.100> figure<00:07:27.400> out<00:07:27.550> the

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:27.790 
images and you can try to figure out the

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:29.460 
images and you can try to figure out the

frequency of crossover by yourself

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:31.140 
frequency of crossover by yourself
remember<00:07:29.890> divided<00:07:30.160> by<00:07:30.310> two<00:07:30.370> and<00:07:30.790> that's<00:07:30.940> going

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:31.150 
remember divided by two and that's going

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:33.120 
remember divided by two and that's going
