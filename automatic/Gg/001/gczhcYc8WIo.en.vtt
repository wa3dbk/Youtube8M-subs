 main series has already collected more than a 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:35.640

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.769

 and here look we got a wheel with 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:03.550
 the platform has already been repeated 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:06.839

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.839

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:23.860
 here ken valley tennis players expected 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.340
 for me it is not uncommon you know if 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.340
 look 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:46.690
 another tennis player how are they each for 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.690
 friend came stones 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:06.200
 here we see stickers 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.200
 I see for the first time 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:20.190
 many will say that it is not so good but 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:22.790
 at least something new for me that is on 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:27.860
 one side such animals kangaroo 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:33.540
 here is a possum or something like an ostrich and 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:39.270
 swan on the other side crocodile goose 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:41.990
 elephant and leopard 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:45.770
 all these stickers stick on becoming 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:45.770
 Let these loans 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:57.910
 so 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:03:01.460
 we get this album with stickers 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:03.800
 and I want to note that is this 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:06.340
 stickers for example made some 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:09.470
 flocking that imitates wool 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:12.830
 Here it is and embossed that mimic 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:15.680
 Crocodile's hard elephant skin is the same 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.720
 most thing that is here on the video I do not know 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:21.650
 visible or not and if not visible then output 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:24.500
 on the word then when holding a finger 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:26.020
 texture is felt that is texture 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.540
 crocodile skin 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:33.680
 can find any thing from 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:36.680
 crocodile skin and touch get 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:39.470
 the same sensation is also on a swan 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:43.390
 also flocking to buy clearance 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:47.739
 you can see that the plot is covered with some nap 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:51.290
 actually pretty good thing 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:53.660
 the child can still stick these stickers 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:56.989
 not only the liner but for example there on 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:59.690
 diary on the notebook that is, well, I do not know 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:03.290
 I think it is quite normal to 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:05.630
 if there were just stickers without here 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:11.030
 such an effect three then yes then it was 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:14.630
 would be bad and so quite nothing so let's 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:17.680
 set and our two kendo waited 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.680
 already remaining 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:42.430
 and look here tops from a series of sports 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:46.690
 already been a few times too let's 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:49.920
 let's raise ours to mrs then open 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.920
 the last for today kinder 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:11.830
 here look exactly the same 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:14.910
 stickers 2 will not glue and so on 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:17.880
 that not a single episode has gathered to the end 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:20.290
 until there are repetitions 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:22.890
 new the only thing we saw with you 

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:25.930
 This stickers and in duplicate 

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:28.780
 but if the village has not gathered now this is what 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:31.240
 means that the more series I need 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:34.360
 collect in the future and it is good 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:36.400
