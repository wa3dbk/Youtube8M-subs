00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.260
 First of all, I want to deflate my house

 Tires since 700 -20 No. c 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:18.480
 There is quite a volume 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.800
 Raptor 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.800
 I will paint 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:31.630

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:39.240
 I will put in the air 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:44.699
 At first it is easy to go with one hand 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.780
 When the coming growing a little air pressure 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.900
 With both hands 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.250
 Firmly 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.250
 Push to come directly below 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:14.899
 I think it is about 5 km already 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.899

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.900
 While applying body odor 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.900
 The trick is to have a good 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:44.810
 It's almost time to push in with your relatives 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.810
 Because it is about kilos

 It measures the air pressure 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.560
 Though it is zero now 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:17.740
 And 736 kpa are included 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:20.550
 You can use enough air pressure for road racer tires 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.550
 that's all
