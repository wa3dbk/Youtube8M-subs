00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.480
 this engine is rated at one and a dozen 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.719
 kilowatt 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.900
 it is just iron power 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:15.990
 electric 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.630
 at 220 he develops speed 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.359
 seventy four seventy six 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.850
 kilometers per hour well, we removed one 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.789
 rechargeable battery because but 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.660
 bike is very dangerous to experience such 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:34.369
 speed here i am now to you and and 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.369
 demonstrate work 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:19.369
 this design has a rear wheel 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:23.340
 is a generator 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:25.409
 generator that constantly gives 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.070
 energy to feed these batteries 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.920
 without lithium ion batteries 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:34.680
 only 24 volts 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:41.009
 Here is a major in front of the motor-wheel 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:42.990
 it's somewhere around 450 maybe 500 watts here 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.750
 to demonstrate this kind of generation we 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:50.660
 started turning on the bulbs in series 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.660
 United conventional paws from the car 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.830
 how easy 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:02:02.759
 here with ease so to speak yo 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:05.600
 passes light visible yes now 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.600
 we turn off 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:21.739
 now we are the rear motor-wheel then 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:25.290
 generator we turn on the battery 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:31.260
 the difference between the consumption of this motor 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:34.519
 and the actual generation of this generator 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:37.590
 Only 34 devices are available. 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:38.310
 the cyclist will ride at 30 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.489
 kilometers 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:44.519
 at a speed of 30 kilometers just 3 well 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:46.620
 maximum 4 amps range 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:49.049
 naturally increases significantly 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:53.030
 here on these batteries 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:53.030
 you can drive about 100 kilometers
