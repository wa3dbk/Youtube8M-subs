there<00:05:20.350> a<00:05:20.380> better<00:05:20.740> level<00:05:21.130> but<00:05:21.490> they<00:05:21.670> get<00:05:22.420> quite

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:22.630 
there a better level but they get quite

there a better level but they get quite
good<00:05:22.960> XP<00:05:23.260> and<00:05:25.110> see<00:05:26.110> I<00:05:26.560> don't<00:05:26.830> really<00:05:27.280> think

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430 
good XP and see I don't really think

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:31.830 
good XP and see I don't really think
there's<00:05:28.000> a<00:05:28.330> lot<00:05:28.450> more<00:05:28.980> good<00:05:29.980> alternatives<00:05:30.840> not
