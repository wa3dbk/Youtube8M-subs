00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:14.160
 Go for the night 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.410
 I wanted you to evaluate whether the team 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.500
 do são paulo today and we noticed that 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.300
 You at certain times 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.580
 I think most will put this 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.910
 So you got pretty agitated in the 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.880
 today's benchmarking benchmark 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.720
 the team and talked a lot with the 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.149
 goose 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:38.480
 São Paulo today won but you did not 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:41.610
 Said satisfied today here I think 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:44.700
 winning is always important because it gives 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.879
 confidence even more at the beginning we 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.320
 It's important for you to get a 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.670
 competitive team that we are 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.239
 Finding the team, we still have to 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.829
 start from now on and start 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.190
 repeat the team more because we have 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:02.309
 What to think about liberating vacations 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.979
 so we are waiting for everyone 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:08.010
 to be able to play 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.360
 to decide to repeat more if 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.280
 I had to 18 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.070
 So far so good, we've started the 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.009
 with you we have changed several times 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:20.340
 You have to start having a face 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:22.290
 normal game season be afraid 15 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.110
 very strong physically we feel a 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.119
 little more inside the normal in the 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.070
 municipality and will now have three 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.710
 on the fourth Saturday after the other 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.990
 Ash Wednesday against the 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.100
 Corinthians and Caldas in the Liberators 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.979
 otherwise I'll have pretty much time 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.500
 to do a tactical workout anyway 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.189
 be more game game you will hit the 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.140
 team 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.420
 maybe just the same so the games 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.560
 last missing details as it is 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.869
 do you think São Paulo will arrive? 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.360
 the 18th that until then is the competition 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.280
 most important 100% already announced that the 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.329
 band and unfortunately have some players 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:59.729
 although we have some doubts right? 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:02.130
 the saint andré or the souza in the 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.140
 question player Charlie has many 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.590
 players at the tip 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.759
 We're going to have to wait a little. 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.619
 more 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:14.640
 tactical training is the easiest you 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:17.370
 does every day but it's important to play right? 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:20.370
 but what it seems these players only 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:24.690
 souza gives a little trouble yet 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:26.340
 Wait a little longer, we'll 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.890
 will have to define a little more of this 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:33.110
 team loses the game against Corinthians 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:36.810
 because that is where our purpose is 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:38.430
 said a European classic on Wednesday 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.200
 and spoke in the sequence of games that have 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.180
 ahead but with only a week's worth of 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.239
 são paulo season has already played three times 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:48.239
 on Wednesday already have a classic is 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:53.130
 game to really measure the paulo to 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:54.840
 liberators the context is different will 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.980
 measure the day you have the squad to 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.769
 disposition 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.610
 what we think the team will measure by 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:03.630
 while we're looking for 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:06.060
 players are changing a little right 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:09.680
 so we'll have to wait 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:13.769
 why can not we talk about Wednesday? 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:16.489
 and it 's the game that will measure our moment 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:19.290
 because we do not have in the starting lineup 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:23.790
 have three players have possibility in the 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:26.760
 case or four players of affection dori 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.620
 the story on 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.320
 so players want to have to 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.030
 wait a little more souza either 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.110
 Do not worry, you can not talk. 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:38.360
 Wednesday we have to be 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.360
 on the day of the liberators game 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:43.290
 Luis Fabiano today running marking 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.390
 pulling the counter attack on the exit of the 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.700
 field he said the first season 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:51.360
 who starts thin skinny without 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:53.340
 problems with injuries believe that even 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:56.010
 account of the goals of this season's good 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:59.670
 he reached his ideal state in the 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:02.480
 paulo depends a lot on the physical part he 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.480
 knows this 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:08.670
 today attacker can not 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:13.950
 just make it happen to participate more or less 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:20.040
 a face all that boring yet 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:26.970
 climber a little there and can handle a 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:30.090
 playground there put it outside and then 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:32.460
 He is the players and I kept getting 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.770
 much to him sometimes with the pope who 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.600
 Do not give attackers today. Only I do. 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.120
 Goal I only mass does not exist in football. 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:41.520
 today is without the ball too you have to 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.840
 pressure the opponent and today he made 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.389
 a lot of it 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:48.840
 so is he in a good mood 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:53.340
 because every time the luis is well 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:55.020
 physically prepared and it yields this 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:58.740
 goal that he says he did today does 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:01.919
 always girl this diagonal of immortal 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:03.570
 It always does, so it's now and also 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:05.699
 I think you prepared yourself before on vacation. 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:08.490
 also when he arrived in the preseason already 

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:11.280
 I was training so he's in good shape. 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:15.690
 moment and is most important 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:23.460
 goals is not his business function but I 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:25.880
 I think they liked the video in our 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.880
 channel on youtube
