00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:06.209
 you have your rusty tool I 'm going to 

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:08.340
 tell how to clean or remove what rusted and 

00:00:06.209 --> 00:00:12.860
 also some tips to prevent 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.860
 you get rusted again so you want 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:29.780
 Well first there are several things 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:32.930
 can use to remove it 

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:35.030
 the rusty of the tools this is 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:40.120
 what for me has used me for the 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:40.120
 tool is simply a fiber 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:45.740
 What I do is just start it 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.270
 in them 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:58.350
 and it is removing the oxidation is something 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:03.469
 totally simple 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.469
 do not scratch the tool so much 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.320
 and if it goes cleaning it was removing the 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:11.610
 oxidation there are several types of chemicals 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:16.010
 that can be used 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.010
 to also remove the oxidation 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:24.219
 it's a lot like that so I want the 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.219
 better way a little 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.980
 simply with this type of fibers and 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.830
 the tools parts 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:36.440
 here is the science 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.440
 that you can see a little the difference 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:44.060
 another other clamp we will be this age 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.060
 functional 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:01.840
 and there are several types of sandpapers that one 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.840
 may be using 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.110
 if it is a little further 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.950
 so take this class 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:33.760
 so this is what I almost 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:35.940
 use to clean my tool of 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.730
 rusty 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:42.390
 I know there are more ways but for me this 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.860
 it is the most as fast and the most 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.310
 easy 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:49.220
 it radiates the tool is grated and serra 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.700
 and it was scratched a little 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:56.849
 It also depends on the 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.849
 of the type of choose that you buy 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:09.750
 and this helps you clean up to clean the 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.750
 tool 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.030
 good now what we are going to occupy for 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:19.730
 prevent that they oxidize very 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.319
 quickly the tools is you 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.790
 I recommend that you buy a bottle of 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:27.900
 lubricant lubricant 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:29.849
 These are sachets of secant 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.420
 these are substances that are used to 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:36.170
 eliminate moisture in the air and this 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:39.150
 protects your tools from moisture 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:42.720
 I also recommend that you buy a 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:45.830
 this is a blanket with cushion 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:50.190
 and this also absorbs moisture 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:54.380
 then what easy you put with this 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:57.200
 cushion mantecon you put 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:00.320
 you put lubricant any kind of 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:03.080
 oil and here we can see the difference 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:05.560
 of the carving and what he has carved us with 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.560
 this tool 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:13.720
 and afterwards you put the 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.720
 desiccant sachets 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:21.729
 and that's all this is going to prevent you 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:24.130
 that accident of two tools the 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:25.810
 process will be slower than if not 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:28.930
 you had all this the process is going to be 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:31.120
 totally fast 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.710
 the products I'll leave you a link 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.259
 down this video so you can 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:37.630
 get if you're interested in these 

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:40.449
 products you can buy them in any 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:42.610
 hardware store or in any store 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:47.469
 products 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:49.360
 and this I think that this process is a 

00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:52.849
 good advice for your 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:56.809
 tools do not rust easily 

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:59.089
 and you can take care of your investment so it's 

00:04:56.809 --> 00:05:01.659
 thank you very much for watching this video and 

00:04:59.089 --> 00:05:01.659
 take care
