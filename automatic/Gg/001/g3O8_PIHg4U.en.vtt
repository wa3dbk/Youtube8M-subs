00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:12.160
 hello welcome are like in this video 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:15.339
 I'm going to show you how you can see the use 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.560
 of your ipad with the applications 

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:18.849
 is worth the memory that you have that you are 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.279
 using and the memory that you have 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:23.980
 available for this what you have 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:26.050
 what to do is access settings and then 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.820
 up here and give generate is up 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.099
 on the left we do general and here 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.359
 we see here the update of the 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:33.220
 information software and here by 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:35.199
 example a very fast mara and without power 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.390
 to do nothing is to see the capacity that has 

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:39.129
 our our ipad and good what 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.400
 we are using here we have 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:44.949
 we will create a capacity of 57 gigas and the 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.570
 we are available to a 53 like this 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:48.400
 that we are basically using very little 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.949
 we still do not have songs or videos and 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.839
 a lot of memory are the applications and 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:53.979
 photographs that we are using to 

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:56.170
 to be able to see what we are using 

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:58.199
 we have to go to use we click on 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:01.870
 use and here we see the main 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:04.510
 applications that we are using 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:07.000
 with the memory that you really are 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:11.680
 occupy here we can come and eliminate them 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.970
 or look at what they are using and what 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.650
 that is all the applications that we have 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.909
 downloaded come here and look at the 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.220
 application and we will eliminate this 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:19.720
 application here worth these are the 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.250
 main applications that more consumption 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.890
 they have and to see all the applications 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:27.149
 that we have here we see all the listing 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.149
 of applications that we have 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.930
 apart from this we see up here as 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.210
 tells us as we said before the 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.310
 memory that we are using in this case 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.880
 36 and the memory we have available 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.410
 that that they are still 53 6 and that 9 very 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.260
 quick to see if we can download the 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.760
 important application or not worth here 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.040
 below we also see storage 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.200
 that we have is about nothing cloud and some 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.840
 that we have available is worth total in 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:56.170
 the cloud is five gigs and in this case 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.430
 we have only used in two and we can 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.780
 even come and manage the 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.940
 storage we click here 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.980
 We take to the device that we 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.520
 we are doing good value this every 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:07.380
 one that uses it as it needs 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.090
 and well then we also have the use of 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.340
 battery charge and time from the 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.410
 last load is worth the use with we have 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.290
 available are 20 hours and at rest 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.890
 We had 21 hours worth just in the part 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.890
 from here 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.960
 Well I hope you have been useful 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.040
 the truth is that this is very simple 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.780
 but if you do not know if you have to 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.100
 download an application or make a 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.110
 update that sometimes asks you to have 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.570
 a certain memory because it is a mere 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.220
 Quick to know that you can to the best 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:35.860
 erase applications that in a 6 much 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.570
 come here and eliminate it worth it can be 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.370
 quite simple and as I said 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:41.560
 you come here you make delete the application 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.090
 and eliminate the application that really 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.670
 you do not want to use to get a 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.930
 little more space 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.030
 Okay, I hope you have 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.280
 liked and if you want to see other videos
