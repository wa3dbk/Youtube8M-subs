00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
planes ducted fan jets but today we have

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.130 
planes ducted fan jets but today we have
some<00:00:26.820> of<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:26.970> different<00:00:27.330> warbirds<00:00:27.840> that<00:00:28.019> they

have so we're going to go ahead and take
a<00:00:30.300> look<00:00:30.420> at<00:00:30.630> them<00:00:30.779> first<00:00:31.619> thing<00:00:31.890> is<00:00:32.130> that

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
a look at them first thing is that

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.220 
a look at them first thing is that
there's<00:00:32.820> basically<00:00:33.300> two<00:00:33.540> Sciences<00:00:33.960> that<00:00:34.110> they

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
there's basically two Sciences that they

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.959 
there's basically two Sciences that they
have<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.620> first<00:00:34.800> ones<00:00:34.980> are<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.160> minis<00:00:35.430> Lexi's

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
have the first ones are the minis Lexi's

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.389 
have the first ones are the minis Lexi's
got<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.300> mini<00:00:36.480> that's<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.620> sky<00:00:37.890> Raider<00:00:38.160> which

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
got the mini that's the sky Raider which

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.130 
got the mini that's the sky Raider which
is<00:00:38.520> kind<00:00:38.700> of<00:00:38.730> an<00:00:38.850> unusual<00:00:38.969> plane<00:00:39.719> to<00:00:39.870> find

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
is kind of an unusual plane to find

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.479 
is kind of an unusual plane to find
that's<00:00:40.680> made<00:00:40.980> in<00:00:41.570> an<00:00:42.649> electric-type<00:00:43.649> plane

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
that's made in an electric-type plane

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.240 
that's made in an electric-type plane
and<00:00:44.760> then<00:00:45.030> we<00:00:45.059> also<00:00:45.300> have<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:46.079> war<00:00:46.680> Hawk<00:00:46.920> here

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
and then we also have the war Hawk here

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.470 
and then we also have the war Hawk here
so<00:00:47.730> you<00:00:47.820> can<00:00:48.030> see<00:00:48.120> we<00:00:48.210> have<00:00:48.300> two<00:00:48.450> different

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
so you can see we have two different

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.740 
so you can see we have two different
ones<00:00:48.899> here<00:00:49.020> they're<00:00:49.289> both<00:00:50.090> $95<00:00:51.090> plug<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:51.539> play

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
ones here they're both $95 plug and play

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.779 
ones here they're both $95 plug and play
so<00:00:52.320> plug<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:52.680> play<00:00:52.829> means<00:00:53.070> that<00:00:53.370> they<00:00:53.489> have

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
so plug and play means that they have

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.330 
so plug and play means that they have
the<00:00:54.120> motors<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.899> speed<00:00:55.199> controls<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.829> servos

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
the motors the speed controls the servos

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.270 
the motors the speed controls the servos
are<00:00:56.850> all<00:00:57.030> installed<00:00:57.590> landing<00:00:58.590> gear<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:58.949> comes

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
are all installed landing gear and comes

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.430 
are all installed landing gear and comes
with<00:00:59.460> them<00:00:59.699> some<00:01:00.480> of<00:01:00.510> them<00:01:00.660> have<00:01:00.840> navigation

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
with them some of them have navigation

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.369 
with them some of them have navigation
lights<00:01:01.680> built<00:01:01.949> into<00:01:02.309> them<00:01:02.460> so<00:01:02.699> at<00:01:03.110> $95<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.290> all

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
lights built into them so at $95 and all

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.140 
lights built into them so at $95 and all
you<00:01:04.530> need<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:04.799> do<00:01:04.949> is<00:01:05.100> you<00:01:05.189> have<00:01:05.250> your<00:01:05.460> micro

you need to do is you have your micro

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.140 
you need to do is you have your micro
battery<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.869> you<00:01:07.200> need<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.530> add<00:01:07.710> your

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.150 
battery and you need to add your

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.060 
battery and you need to add your
receiver<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.420> it<00:01:09.600> it's<00:01:10.049> a<00:01:10.110> great<00:01:10.409> value<00:01:10.619> there

receiver to it it's a great value there
are<00:01:11.189> nice<00:01:11.340> sized<00:01:11.610> planes<00:01:11.970> so<00:01:12.479> we're<00:01:12.600> gonna

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
are nice sized planes so we're gonna

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:13.730 
are nice sized planes so we're gonna
we're<00:01:13.049> going<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.229> kind<00:01:13.439> of<00:01:13.470> just<00:01:13.619> show<00:01:13.650> you

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.520 
included in a front and a plane like
this<00:02:23.790> no<00:02:24.790> so<00:02:25.090> the<00:02:25.450> retracts<00:02:25.840> are<00:02:25.959> using<00:02:26.230> an<00:02:26.290> 80

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
this no so the retracts are using an 80

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.470 
this no so the retracts are using an 80
to<00:02:26.620> $100<00:02:27.280> option<00:02:27.790> and<00:02:28.150> these<00:02:28.330> are

see the graphics on this are really
beautiful<00:02:50.500> from<00:02:50.920> far<00:02:51.190> it's<00:02:51.310> very<00:02:51.400> difficult

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
beautiful from far it's very difficult

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.089 
beautiful from far it's very difficult
to<00:02:52.150> tell<00:02:52.330> the<00:02:52.450> display<00:02:52.810> is<00:02:53.019> even<00:02:53.470> styrofoam

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:54.099 
to tell the display is even styrofoam

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:55.970 
to tell the display is even styrofoam
you<00:02:54.220> have<00:02:54.310> to<00:02:54.370> look<00:02:54.489> really<00:02:55.120> close<00:02:55.390> to<00:02:55.660> see

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
you have to look really close to see

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.259 
you have to look really close to see
that<00:02:56.980> it's<00:02:57.099> a<00:02:57.190> styrofoam<00:02:57.549> plane<00:02:57.760> from<00:02:57.970> Fargo

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
that it's a styrofoam plane from Fargo

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:00.000 
that it's a styrofoam plane from Fargo
it<00:02:58.330> would<00:02:58.420> be<00:02:58.480> difficult<00:02:58.690> to<00:02:59.019> tell<00:02:59.290> that<00:02:59.829> it's

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
it would be difficult to tell that it's

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.830 
it would be difficult to tell that it's
even<00:03:00.220> a<00:03:00.250> styrofoam<00:03:00.700> plane<00:03:00.910> well<00:03:01.450> go<00:03:01.570> ahead<00:03:01.600> and

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
even a styrofoam plane well go ahead and

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.300 
even a styrofoam plane well go ahead and
we'll<00:03:01.959> pop<00:03:02.140> the<00:03:02.290> canopy<00:03:02.709> off<00:03:02.890> and<00:03:03.100> show<00:03:03.220> you

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
we'll pop the canopy off and show you

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:08.130 
we'll pop the canopy off and show you
inside<00:03:05.040> very<00:03:06.040> nice<00:03:06.310> with<00:03:06.579> this<00:03:06.730> ceremony<00:03:07.329> kind

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
inside very nice with this ceremony kind

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.289 
inside very nice with this ceremony kind
of<00:03:08.200> goes<00:03:08.320> down<00:03:08.560> inside<00:03:09.010> there's<00:03:09.700> also<00:03:09.880> a<00:03:10.000> pilot

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.299 
of goes down inside there's also a pilot

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:14.099 
of goes down inside there's also a pilot
that's<00:03:10.630> actually<00:03:11.019> included<00:03:12.390> so<00:03:13.390> you<00:03:13.810> don't

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:14.109 
that's actually included so you don't

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:15.840 
that's actually included so you don't
see<00:03:14.260> pilots<00:03:14.709> in<00:03:14.890> planes<00:03:15.280> in<00:03:15.489> this<00:03:15.609> price<00:03:15.819> point

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
see pilots in planes in this price point

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:17.490 
see pilots in planes in this price point
and<00:03:16.450> then<00:03:16.840> you<00:03:16.900> can<00:03:16.959> see<00:03:17.170> down<00:03:17.290> inside

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
and then you can see down inside

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.979 
and then you can see down inside
standard<00:03:18.489> things<00:03:18.700> like<00:03:18.970> Dean's<00:03:19.329> plugs<00:03:19.690> for

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
standard things like Dean's plugs for

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:21.569 
standard things like Dean's plugs for
your<00:03:20.109> batteries<00:03:20.560> inside<00:03:20.980> so<00:03:21.160> that's<00:03:21.310> a<00:03:21.400> very

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:21.579 
your batteries inside so that's a very

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:23.309 
your batteries inside so that's a very
common<00:03:21.880> plug<00:03:22.239> so<00:03:22.510> that's<00:03:22.660> good<00:03:22.840> to<00:03:22.930> see<00:03:23.109> that

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:23.319 
common plug so that's good to see that

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:25.500 
common plug so that's good to see that
the<00:03:24.130> servos<00:03:24.489> and<00:03:24.519> can<00:03:24.790> see<00:03:24.940> inside<00:03:25.269> are<00:03:25.480> all

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
the servos and can see inside are all

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.920 
the servos and can see inside are all
pre<00:03:26.170> mounted<00:03:26.880> they<00:03:27.880> have<00:03:27.970> great<00:03:28.209> adjustment

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
pre mounted they have great adjustment

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.330 
pre mounted they have great adjustment
system<00:03:29.049> so<00:03:29.290> you<00:03:29.380> have<00:03:29.410> really<00:03:29.620> good<00:03:29.829> hardware

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
system so you have really good hardware

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.509 
system so you have really good hardware
to<00:03:30.940> make<00:03:31.030> the<00:03:31.150> servos<00:03:31.480> very<00:03:31.660> easy<00:03:31.870> to<00:03:32.109> adjust

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
to make the servos very easy to adjust

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:35.009 
to make the servos very easy to adjust
you<00:03:33.519> can<00:03:33.670> see<00:03:33.819> your<00:03:33.970> light<00:03:34.090> book<00:03:34.269> that<00:03:34.810> your

you can see your light book that your

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:37.860 
you can see your light book that your

already<00:03:40.660> in<00:03:40.780> there<00:03:40.989> so<00:03:41.970> and<00:03:42.970> then<00:03:43.060> there's<00:03:43.239> a

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:43.329 
already in there so and then there's a

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:44.940 
already in there so and then there's a
spot<00:03:43.569> in<00:03:43.690> the<00:03:43.780> front<00:03:44.019> to<00:03:44.230> slide<00:03:44.350> your<00:03:44.650> battery

together<00:03:49.200> we<00:03:50.200> think<00:03:50.380> this<00:03:50.590> would<00:03:50.769> take<00:03:50.889> about

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
together we think this would take about

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.759 
together we think this would take about
20<00:03:51.730> minutes<00:03:51.760> half<00:03:52.150> hour<00:03:52.329> in<00:03:52.600> order<00:03:52.840> to<00:03:53.049> put

20 minutes half hour in order to put
this<00:03:53.859> together

we both know a lot about these planes

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:18.600 
we both know a lot about these planes
and<00:05:17.560> we'd<00:05:17.740> be<00:05:17.860> happy<00:05:18.130> to<00:05:18.160> answer<00:05:18.370> any

there<00:05:20.530> we<00:05:20.890> source<00:05:21.160> them<00:05:21.340> locally<00:05:21.760> in<00:05:21.880> the

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:21.970 
there we source them locally in the

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:23.820 
there we source them locally in the
United<00:05:22.210> States<00:05:22.480> so<00:05:22.720> delivery<00:05:23.080> time<00:05:23.260> on<00:05:23.530> planes

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:23.830 
United States so delivery time on planes

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:28.020 
United States so delivery time on planes
is<00:05:24.070> typically<00:05:24.930> maybe<00:05:26.160> three<00:05:27.160> days<00:05:27.370> to<00:05:27.760> get<00:05:27.910> it

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:28.030 
is typically maybe three days to get it

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:29.580 
is typically maybe three days to get it
so<00:05:28.240> something<00:05:28.720> that<00:05:28.750> you<00:05:28.930> see<00:05:29.110> that<00:05:29.260> they<00:05:29.410> have
