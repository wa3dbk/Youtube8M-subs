00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:13.250
 hey guys here your new juanes 01 in a 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:15.769
 gta video online this time with the 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.450
 police uniform set works 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:19.160
 for all consoles and in any case 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.630
 that will stop working for one of 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.259
 you can let me know in the 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.480
 comments 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:26.990
 all this is thanks to the user of almost 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:29.330
 40 43 7 from the forums of shirin sense el 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.699
 creator of this method there are three 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.650
 requirements before performing this trick 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:36.140
 so I 'm going to tell you what the 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.210
 first is the help of a friend if not the 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.400
 they have then they will not be able to do it 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.440
 second would be enough level to 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.149
 call a transport helicopter 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.670
 elmer and webber and finally the most 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:49.190
 important a luxury department with 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.620
 space of 10 cars if they have a garage 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.840
 of 10 cars without a department is likely 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.850
 let this one come out so get rid of him 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.430
 and change it for one that has 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.949
 department and space of 10 garages not 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.809
 well let's start we're going to 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:04.699
 start an invitation session 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:07.759
 then we are going to go to gta online 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.470
 activities play activity created by 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:12.140
 rockstar and let's choose the mission 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.540
 versus corrupt cop we confirm yes 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.470
 and then we start it once we are 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.690
 on the menu 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.450
 duration of the mission we will choose in 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.640
 the part that says clothes versus we're going to 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.740
 change to classic this is the most 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.600
 important to perform the trick 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.390
 after that the accessibility we're going 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.460
 to create closed and now we are going to 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.190
 invite our friend once what 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.260
 let's invite it to start and it's going to 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.570
 seem like a type of menu in which 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.550
 we can choose the clothes and 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.470
 our friend can not choose the 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.910
 obviously you have to be the 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.100
 hosts to be able to do the trick 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:49.160
 once we are here choosing the 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.990
 clothes let's choose the one of justice that 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.450
 in this case it would be the uniform of 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:56.330
 police we give ready and now yes to 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.040
 start with the trick once we are 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.470
 here in the mission we are going to call 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:03.290
 quickly as soon as we go out to the 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:05.750
 street to Mary Weather and we're going to ask for a 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.970
 helicopter extraction I suggest 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.320
 that you choose here in the planito for 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.040
 that the helicopter can reach 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:14.450
 just and landing this is going to cost 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.160
 approximately one thousand dollars is not very 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.870
 expensive but as I say they have to have 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.030
 the sufficient level when the 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.740
 helicopter are going to kill the driver and 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.130
 they will take it with everything 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:26.720
 but to the police station once 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.850
 that we get to the police station 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.890
 we are going to tell our friend that we 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.630
 take care of the helicopter so that it does not 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.630
 disappear and we do not have to go back to 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.520
 call another and we will choose a car 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.350
 from the street it can be any one of them 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.390
 I say it's high enough 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.880
 to enter the walt bridge that already 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.410
 many are used to using what 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.270
 let's do in stealth mode to 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.700
 those who do not know how to enter or who 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:51.950
 it is difficult for them now if we climb 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.530
 we cross the world bridge and we go to 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.390
 put this point on the map and how they see 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.340
 this is also the location of what 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.190
 would be the police station as soon as 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.470
 we throw ourselves open the parachute and 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.780
 we try to get to that point 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.600
 sorry point the way I am 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:11.090
 falling down once we get to that 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:13.190
 mini dot it could be said that we are going to 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.620
 crush the buttons to go braking and 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:18.500
 let's go around the sil 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:21.890
 of the circle until we enter what 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:24.230
 would be our 10-seater garage if 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.860
 they manage to enter successfully is going to see 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.410
 in this way 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.150
 here I come closer I start to spin 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.310
 around the fernando circle and how 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.860
 come here and done that I get up and in 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:38.220
 case of nexgen was already in pc 4 xbox 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:40.050
 one and pc if they appear they already know that they do not know 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.330
 see third person simply because 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:45.000
 they change the first person if they are 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:47.820
 seeing that their cars are successfully 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.250
 they achieved this your forgiveness trick they are going to 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:52.320
 climb the elevator and once you 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.660
 grabs are going to enter your apartment and 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:57.900
 they are going to go directly to what would be 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:00.230
 your sets in your closet in any case 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.520
 that they will not reach the garage 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.170
 they just go to the bottom of what 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.180
 that would be the map reappear in 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.709
 the surface and try again this 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.870
 trick you know they get on a helicopter 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:12.209
 they put the point and go back to making the 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.820
 same process but from the part of the 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:16.739
 helicopter now how do you see nothing else 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:18.180
 I keep it in an empty space in this 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:22.200
 case I'm going to replace some of my 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:23.370
 sets and I'll put him police for 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.440
 make sure it worked 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:28.350
 correctly, we will save it 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.479
 twice in case not so so if I 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:32.490
 let's save twice as I say 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:35.340
 all this is a matter of practice 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:37.919
 and fall at the exact point of the garage and 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:41.220
 also eye the most important thing is that 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:43.590
 have a luxury garage only or 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:46.620
 whether they have three garages as is my 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:48.810
 case all three should be luxurious since 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.550
 must have a garage and department 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:52.560
 ten places and nothing else they want to 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.389
 displaced because either way once 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.630
 they finished are going to come out of what 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:59.190
 would be the game with the cell phone and how 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:01.380
 come on we go to the interaction menu 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:04.319
 sets and there we will have the 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:07.319
 good police guys I hope you have them 

00:05:04.319 --> 00:05:09.810
 liked the trick is pretty can you 

00:05:07.319 --> 00:05:13.110
 say easy but a little laborious 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:14.520
 if you do not know the first one will fall there is 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:17.099
 question of practice as I say 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:19.319
 I also want to thank my friend 

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:21.389
 now yes pro to help me perform 

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:22.650
 this trick and now if the part of the 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:24.960
