they're gonna be socketed with the ABEC
7<00:01:00.180> bearings<00:01:00.570> you're<00:01:00.719> getting<00:01:00.899> a<00:01:00.930> nice<00:01:01.050> smooth

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
7 bearings you're getting a nice smooth

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.349 
7 bearings you're getting a nice smooth
roll<00:01:01.710> out<00:01:01.890> of<00:01:01.920> that<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.340> as<00:01:02.730> you<00:01:02.879> can<00:01:02.969> see<00:01:03.030> they

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
roll out of that and as you can see they

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.370 
roll out of that and as you can see they
are<00:01:03.390> mounted<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.670> S<00:01:05.670> frame<00:01:06.330> from<00:01:06.780> bot<00:01:07.020> this

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
are mounted to the S frame from bot this

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.750 
are mounted to the S frame from bot this
is<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:07.530> great<00:01:07.740> frame<00:01:08.040> because<00:01:08.340> it<00:01:08.369> actually

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
is a great frame because it actually

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.700 
is a great frame because it actually
offers<00:01:08.850> a<00:01:09.030> lot<00:01:09.180> of<00:01:09.210> stiffness<00:01:09.600> without<00:01:10.470> being

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
offers a lot of stiffness without being

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.380 
offers a lot of stiffness without being
too<00:01:11.040> stiff<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.580> still<00:01:11.820> offers<00:01:12.119> some<00:01:12.240> good

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
too stiff and still offers some good

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.010 
too stiff and still offers some good
flex<00:01:12.720> as<00:01:12.900> well<00:01:13.080> that's<00:01:13.530> because<00:01:13.740> it's<00:01:13.979> a<00:01:14.070> 6061

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
flex as well that's because it's a 6061

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.749 
flex as well that's because it's a 6061
aluminum<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.229> of<00:01:16.650> course<00:01:16.860> it<00:01:16.979> is<00:01:17.100> mounted<00:01:17.580> to

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
aluminum and of course it is mounted to

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.429 
aluminum and of course it is mounted to
the<00:01:18.119> boot<00:01:18.299> using<00:01:18.570> a<00:01:18.810> three-point<00:01:19.259> mount

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
the boot using a three-point mount

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.820 
the boot using a three-point mount
system<00:01:19.860> so<00:01:20.820> for<00:01:21.030> 2014<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.170> biggest<00:01:22.409> change<00:01:22.650> is

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
system so for 2014 the biggest change is

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.890 
system so for 2014 the biggest change is
on<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.009> semi<00:01:23.220> race<00:01:23.430> are<00:01:23.640> on<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:23.970> boot<00:01:24.180> first

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
on the semi race are on the boot first

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:25.969 
on the semi race are on the boot first
thing<00:01:25.049> I<00:01:25.080> want<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.290> point<00:01:25.439> out<00:01:25.590> is<00:01:25.770> the

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
thing I want to point out is the

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.560 
thing I want to point out is the
mounting<00:01:26.430> they<00:01:26.670> did<00:01:26.850> away<00:01:27.030> with<00:01:27.060> just<00:01:27.450> the

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
mounting they did away with just the

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.480 
mounting they did away with just the
two-point<00:01:28.020> mounting<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.159> they<00:01:29.220> are<00:01:29.340> going

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
two-point mounting and they are going

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.460 
two-point mounting and they are going
with<00:01:29.729> only<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.360> three-point<00:01:30.810> this<00:01:31.320> is<00:01:31.439> a

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
with only the three-point this is a

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.410 
with only the three-point this is a
great<00:01:31.740> option<00:01:31.979> for<00:01:32.159> outdoor<00:01:32.700> skaters<00:01:33.090> as<00:01:33.299> it

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
great option for outdoor skaters as it

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.270 
great option for outdoor skaters as it
will<00:01:33.570> provide<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:34.079> best<00:01:34.470> power<00:01:34.740> transfer

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
will provide the best power transfer

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.120 
will provide the best power transfer
possible<00:01:35.790> gives<00:01:36.240> you<00:01:36.329> a<00:01:36.360> lot<00:01:36.570> of<00:01:36.600> stiffness

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
possible gives you a lot of stiffness

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.319 
possible gives you a lot of stiffness
and<00:01:38.130> of<00:01:38.340> course<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.759> difference<00:01:39.060> with<00:01:39.210> the

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
and of course the difference with the

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:40.880 
and of course the difference with the
three-point<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.810> two<00:01:39.960> point<00:01:40.200> being<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.740> two

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
three-point the two point being the two

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.710 
three-point the two point being the two
point<00:01:41.100> does<00:01:41.310> give<00:01:41.490> you<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:41.670> little<00:01:42.360> less

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
point does give you a little less

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.690 
point does give you a little less
stiffness<00:01:43.229> a<00:01:43.290> little<00:01:43.470> more<00:01:43.590> flex<00:01:43.950> so<00:01:44.579> it's

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
stiffness a little more flex so it's

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.580 
stiffness a little more flex so it's
better<00:01:44.820> for<00:01:45.000> turning<00:01:45.360> but<00:01:45.960> this<00:01:46.140> guy<00:01:46.290> is<00:01:46.350> gonna

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
better for turning but this guy is gonna

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.789 
better for turning but this guy is gonna
be<00:01:46.680> great<00:01:46.979> for<00:01:47.009> outdoor<00:01:47.520> uses<00:01:48.259> the<00:01:49.259> carbon

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
be great for outdoor uses the carbon

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.380 
be great for outdoor uses the carbon
fiber<00:01:50.070> that's<00:01:50.340> in<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.549> boot<00:01:50.700> does<00:01:50.909> continue

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
fiber that's in the boot does continue

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.700 
fiber that's in the boot does continue
throughout<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.810> whole<00:01:52.020> boot<00:01:52.229> all<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.500> way<00:01:52.590> up

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
throughout the whole boot all the way up

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.219 
throughout the whole boot all the way up
to<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:52.920> cuff<00:01:53.189> so<00:01:53.430> it<00:01:54.060> is<00:01:54.149> using<00:01:54.450> bond<00:01:54.659> super

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
to the cuff so it is using bond super

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.649 
to the cuff so it is using bond super
mould<00:01:55.640> technology<00:01:56.640> so<00:01:56.759> you<00:01:56.820> can<00:01:57.060> remould<00:01:57.509> it

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
mould technology so you can remould it

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.530 
mould technology so you can remould it
as<00:01:57.780> you<00:01:57.899> want<00:01:58.159> the<00:01:59.159> upgrades<00:01:59.670> to<00:01:59.820> it<00:02:00.090> are<00:02:00.270> in

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
as you want the upgrades to it are in

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.810 
as you want the upgrades to it are in
the<00:02:00.719> upper<00:02:01.079> boot<00:02:01.259> section<00:02:01.710> here<00:02:02.100> they<00:02:02.460> did<00:02:02.610> put

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
the upper boot section here they did put

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.580 
the upper boot section here they did put
a<00:02:02.850> little<00:02:03.119> bit<00:02:03.240> better<00:02:03.450> material<00:02:04.049> on<00:02:04.229> the

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
a little bit better material on the

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.200 
a little bit better material on the
actual<00:02:04.920> outer<00:02:05.130> outside<00:02:05.729> of<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:05.909> boot<00:02:06.060> to

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
actual outer outside of the boot to

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.969 
actual outer outside of the boot to
increase<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:06.630> durability<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:07.380> of<00:02:07.770> course

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
increase the durability and of course

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.490 
increase the durability and of course
you<00:02:08.129> get<00:02:08.250> a<00:02:08.459> TPU<00:02:09.209> bumper<00:02:09.780> on<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:09.929> front<00:02:10.020> here

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
you get a TPU bumper on the front here

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.559 
you get a TPU bumper on the front here
to<00:02:10.679> again<00:02:11.370> increase<00:02:11.670> durability<00:02:11.940> so<00:02:12.510> you

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
to again increase durability so you

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.700 
to again increase durability so you
don't<00:02:12.810> get<00:02:12.900> it<00:02:13.020> all<00:02:13.080> scuffed<00:02:13.410> in<00:02:13.560> the

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
don't get it all scuffed in the

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.860 
don't get it all scuffed in the
front<00:02:13.950> obviously<00:02:14.910> coming<00:02:15.390> up<00:02:15.480> on<00:02:15.600> the<00:02:15.690> boof

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
front obviously coming up on the boof

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.050 
front obviously coming up on the boof
boot<00:02:16.500> here<00:02:16.830> I<00:02:16.980> do<00:02:17.250> want<00:02:17.490> to<00:02:17.520> point<00:02:17.700> out<00:02:17.850> it<00:02:18.030> is

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
boot here I do want to point out it is

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.940 
boot here I do want to point out it is
an<00:02:18.300> extended<00:02:18.870> cuff<00:02:19.110> this<00:02:19.560> is<00:02:19.680> one<00:02:19.800> of<00:02:19.830> the

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
an extended cuff this is one of the

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.130 
an extended cuff this is one of the
benefits<00:02:20.310> going<00:02:20.550> with<00:02:20.790> this<00:02:20.940> skate<00:02:21.300> for

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
benefits going with this skate for

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.660 
benefits going with this skate for
people<00:02:22.500> that<00:02:22.620> really<00:02:22.740> want<00:02:22.950> to<00:02:22.980> get<00:02:23.130> into<00:02:23.370> this

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
people that really want to get into this

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.040 
people that really want to get into this
style<00:02:23.880> of<00:02:24.000> skating<00:02:24.360> because<00:02:24.480> it<00:02:24.750> will<00:02:24.870> give

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
style of skating because it will give

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.750 
style of skating because it will give
you<00:02:25.170> enough<00:02:25.410> support<00:02:25.860> so<00:02:26.340> if<00:02:26.400> you're<00:02:26.520> coming

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
you enough support so if you're coming

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.550 
you enough support so if you're coming
over<00:02:26.970> from<00:02:27.210> a<00:02:27.330> recreational<00:02:28.080> or<00:02:28.200> standard

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
over from a recreational or standard

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.590 
over from a recreational or standard
fitness<00:02:28.950> it's<00:02:29.370> a<00:02:29.490> good<00:02:29.640> transition<00:02:29.820> for<00:02:30.450> you

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
fitness it's a good transition for you

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.450 
fitness it's a good transition for you
but<00:02:31.140> it<00:02:31.230> still<00:02:31.470> doesn't<00:02:31.710> reduce<00:02:32.160> a<00:02:32.280> lot<00:02:32.400> of

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
but it still doesn't reduce a lot of

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:33.560 
but it still doesn't reduce a lot of
your<00:02:32.610> range<00:02:32.760> of<00:02:32.880> motion<00:02:32.940> so<00:02:33.360> you're<00:02:33.480> gonna

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
your range of motion so you're gonna

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.840 
your range of motion so you're gonna
have<00:02:33.690> a<00:02:33.720> nice<00:02:33.870> comfortable<00:02:34.430> cuff<00:02:35.430> here<00:02:35.700> it's

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
have a nice comfortable cuff here it's

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.370

support one of the things I do like

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.540 
support one of the things I do like
about<00:02:39.390> it<00:02:39.810> though<00:02:39.990> is<00:02:40.170> it<00:02:40.530> does<00:02:40.680> have<00:02:40.920> a<00:02:41.190> cover

foot for that really custom feel to it

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.670 
foot for that really custom feel to it
what's<00:02:54.540> nice<00:02:54.690> about<00:02:54.720> that<00:02:55.080> as<00:02:55.230> well<00:02:55.440> as<00:02:55.590> it

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
what's nice about that as well as it

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.530 
what's nice about that as well as it
extends<00:02:56.010> through<00:02:56.310> the<00:02:56.430> tongue<00:02:56.700> which<00:02:57.210> is<00:02:57.360> kind

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
extends through the tongue which is kind

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.450 
extends through the tongue which is kind
of<00:02:57.630> hidden<00:02:57.780> right<00:02:58.050> now<00:02:58.230> but<00:02:58.890> the<00:02:59.010> tongue<00:02:59.220> is

00:02:59.450 --> 00:02:59.460 
of hidden right now but the tongue is

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.880
