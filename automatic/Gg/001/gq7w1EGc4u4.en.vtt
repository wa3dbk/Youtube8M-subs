hole<00:01:48.840> in<00:01:48.990> order<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.350> try<00:01:49.560> to<00:01:49.590> stop<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:49.979> bacteria

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
hole in order to try to stop a bacteria

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.359 
hole in order to try to stop a bacteria
for<00:01:51.090> making<00:01:51.329> a<00:01:51.390> hole<00:01:51.600> in<00:01:51.750> your<00:01:51.840> tooth<00:01:52.049> so<00:01:52.860> it's

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
for making a hole in your tooth so it's

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:54.950 
for making a hole in your tooth so it's
only<00:01:53.549> addressing<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.119> symptoms<00:01:54.329> it's<00:01:54.750> not

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
only addressing the symptoms it's not

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.810 
only addressing the symptoms it's not
addressing<00:01:55.320> what's<00:01:55.979> making<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.399> hole<00:01:56.579> in

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
addressing what's making the hole in

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.550 
addressing what's making the hole in
your<00:01:56.939> tooth<00:01:57.119> so<00:01:57.899> is<00:01:58.110> that<00:01:58.320> bacteria<00:01:58.700> visible

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
your tooth so is that bacteria visible

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.980 
your tooth so is that bacteria visible
when<00:02:01.560> we<00:02:01.740> look<00:02:01.979> in<00:02:02.189> our<00:02:02.340> in<00:02:02.670> our<00:02:02.790> mouth<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.420> at

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
when we look in our in our mouth and at

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.260 
when we look in our in our mouth and at
our<00:02:04.020> teeth<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:04.740> that's<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.729> bacteria<00:02:06.180> right

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
our teeth and that's the bacteria right

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.109 
our teeth and that's the bacteria right
there<00:02:06.450> can<00:02:06.630> we<00:02:06.840> tell<00:02:07.580> whether<00:02:08.580> or<00:02:08.759> not<00:02:08.849> we<00:02:09.000> have

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
there can we tell whether or not we have

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.150 
there can we tell whether or not we have
bacteria<00:02:09.660> on<00:02:09.720> our<00:02:09.929> yeah<00:02:10.379> you<00:02:10.440> can<00:02:10.739> do<00:02:10.860> a<00:02:10.890> test

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
bacteria on our yeah you can do a test

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.990 
bacteria on our yeah you can do a test
that<00:02:11.520> says<00:02:11.760> that<00:02:12.390> you<00:02:12.690> have

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
that says that you have

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.150 
that says that you have
here<00:02:13.330> or<00:02:13.480> not<00:02:13.660> but<00:02:13.930> it<00:02:14.320> turns<00:02:14.560> out<00:02:14.710> that<00:02:14.770> the

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
here or not but it turns out that the

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.680 
here or not but it turns out that the
bacteria<00:02:15.340> is<00:02:15.700> not<00:02:15.760> what<00:02:16.030> causes<00:02:16.180> tooth<00:02:16.630> decay

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
bacteria is not what causes tooth decay

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.110 
bacteria is not what causes tooth decay
the<00:02:17.590> tooth<00:02:17.800> decay<00:02:17.950> is<00:02:18.130> caused<00:02:18.400> by<00:02:18.700> deficiency

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
the tooth decay is caused by deficiency

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.710 
the tooth decay is caused by deficiency
of<00:02:19.570> vitamins<00:02:19.990> and<00:02:20.260> minerals<00:02:20.800> in<00:02:21.190> our<00:02:21.310> diets

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
of vitamins and minerals in our diets

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.820 
of vitamins and minerals in our diets
well<00:02:22.720> this<00:02:22.870> is<00:02:22.990> really<00:02:23.140> going<00:02:23.410> against<00:02:23.680> the

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
well this is really going against the

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.470 
well this is really going against the
grain<00:02:23.860> ban<00:02:24.250> Romney<00:02:24.610> huh<00:02:24.730> why<00:02:25.150> do<00:02:25.210> you<00:02:25.360> believe

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
grain ban Romney huh why do you believe

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.060 
grain ban Romney huh why do you believe
that<00:02:25.660> the<00:02:25.900> current<00:02:26.020> tooth<00:02:26.290> decay<00:02:26.440> theory<00:02:26.830> is

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
that the current tooth decay theory is

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:30.420 
that the current tooth decay theory is
illogical<00:02:27.640> well<00:02:28.540> the<00:02:29.080> the<00:02:29.530> reason<00:02:29.830> is<00:02:30.100> is

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
illogical well the the reason is is

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.000 
illogical well the the reason is is
because<00:02:30.840> they<00:02:31.840> say<00:02:32.080> these<00:02:32.260> bacterias<00:02:32.980> that

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
because they say these bacterias that

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.910 
because they say these bacterias that
they<00:02:33.490> eat<00:02:34.020> sugar<00:02:35.020> in<00:02:35.230> our<00:02:35.350> mouths<00:02:35.560> and<00:02:35.830> that

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
they eat sugar in our mouths and that

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.740 
they eat sugar in our mouths and that
they<00:02:36.010> eat<00:02:36.190> flour<00:02:36.459> we<00:02:36.670> all<00:02:36.820> know<00:02:37.030> that<00:02:37.240> candy

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
they eat flour we all know that candy

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.480 
they eat flour we all know that candy
tastes<00:02:38.110> reason<00:02:38.530> all<00:02:38.740> those<00:02:38.920> foods<00:02:39.220> cause

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 
tastes reason all those foods cause

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.030 
tastes reason all those foods cause
tooth<00:02:39.880> decay<00:02:39.930> the<00:02:40.930> problem<00:02:41.230> is<00:02:41.380> that<00:02:41.650> those

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
tooth decay the problem is that those

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.170 
tooth decay the problem is that those
foods<00:02:42.340> have<00:02:42.490> been<00:02:42.520> decided

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
foods have been decided

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.300 
foods have been decided
designed<00:02:43.570> by<00:02:43.660> industry<00:02:44.230> so<00:02:44.650> that<00:02:44.680> bacterias

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
designed by industry so that bacterias

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:46.770 
designed by industry so that bacterias
don't<00:02:45.489> eat<00:02:45.610> it<00:02:45.940> so<00:02:46.150> it<00:02:46.360> doesn't<00:02:46.510> make<00:02:46.720> sense

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
don't eat it so it doesn't make sense

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.350 
don't eat it so it doesn't make sense
that<00:02:47.290> our<00:02:47.410> bacteria<00:02:47.920> can't<00:02:48.640> eat<00:02:48.760> a<00:02:48.790> food<00:02:49.060> but

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
that our bacteria can't eat a food but

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.460 
that our bacteria can't eat a food but
then<00:02:49.480> when<00:02:49.600> you<00:02:49.660> put<00:02:49.840> in<00:02:49.930> your<00:02:50.050> mouth<00:02:50.170> the

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
then when you put in your mouth the

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:51.810 
then when you put in your mouth the
bacteria<00:02:50.590> somehow<00:02:51.190> eats<00:02:51.459> it

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
bacteria somehow eats it

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.229 
bacteria somehow eats it
so<00:02:52.140> also<00:02:53.140> I<00:02:53.709> knew<00:02:54.040> the<00:02:54.220> theory<00:02:54.790> was<00:02:55.030> wrong

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
so also I knew the theory was wrong

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:57.840 
so also I knew the theory was wrong
because<00:02:55.630> I<00:02:56.110> never<00:02:57.040> gave<00:02:57.280> my<00:02:57.400> daughter<00:02:57.580> any

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
because I never gave my daughter any

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.180 
because I never gave my daughter any
sugar<00:02:58.120> she<00:02:58.510> never<00:02:58.690> drink<00:02:58.959> from<00:02:59.110> a<00:02:59.230> bottle<00:02:59.380> so

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
sugar she never drink from a bottle so

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.100 
sugar she never drink from a bottle so
there<00:03:00.400> was<00:03:00.520> no<00:03:00.670> explanation<00:03:01.150> for<00:03:01.720> her<00:03:01.870> tooth

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
there was no explanation for her tooth

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.100 
there was no explanation for her tooth
decay<00:03:02.610> Wow<00:03:03.640> don't<00:03:04.060> you<00:03:04.239> say<00:03:04.570> that<00:03:04.750> there<00:03:04.930> are

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
decay Wow don't you say that there are

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.250 
decay Wow don't you say that there are
foods<00:03:05.530> that<00:03:06.310> you<00:03:06.520> can<00:03:06.550> eat<00:03:06.970> to<00:03:07.570> prevent<00:03:07.600> tooth

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
foods that you can eat to prevent tooth

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.979 
foods that you can eat to prevent tooth
decay<00:03:08.520> yeah<00:03:09.550> well<00:03:11.430> just<00:03:12.430> briefly<00:03:13.150> the<00:03:13.840> way<00:03:13.959> I

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
decay yeah well just briefly the way I

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:16.229 
decay yeah well just briefly the way I
got<00:03:14.290> to<00:03:14.440> that<00:03:14.620> is<00:03:14.860> there's<00:03:15.610> people<00:03:15.820> all<00:03:16.180> over

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
got to that is there's people all over

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:18.630 
got to that is there's people all over
the<00:03:16.840> planet<00:03:17.080> who<00:03:17.769> don't<00:03:17.950> have<00:03:18.220> tooth<00:03:18.459> decay

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
the planet who don't have tooth decay

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.840 
the planet who don't have tooth decay
and<00:03:20.070> researchers<00:03:21.070> study<00:03:21.310> this<00:03:21.519> and<00:03:21.760> they

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
and researchers study this and they

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.160 
and researchers study this and they
found<00:03:22.120> that<00:03:22.450> the<00:03:22.660> reason<00:03:22.750> why<00:03:22.959> they<00:03:23.080> don't

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
found that the reason why they don't

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:24.930 
found that the reason why they don't
have<00:03:23.380> cute<00:03:23.650> decay<00:03:23.950> is<00:03:24.010> because<00:03:24.340> they<00:03:24.459> have<00:03:24.640> a

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
have cute decay is because they have a

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.120 
have cute decay is because they have a
lot<00:03:25.330> of<00:03:25.450> minerals<00:03:25.660> and<00:03:26.200> vitamins<00:03:26.440> in<00:03:26.890> their

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
lot of minerals and vitamins in their

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:28.320 
lot of minerals and vitamins in their
diet<00:03:27.400> what<00:03:27.730> kind<00:03:27.910> of<00:03:27.940> people<00:03:28.090> are<00:03:28.239> we<00:03:28.269> talking

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.330 
diet what kind of people are we talking

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.070 
diet what kind of people are we talking
about<00:03:28.980> people<00:03:29.980> all<00:03:30.130> over<00:03:30.370> the<00:03:30.459> world<00:03:31.080> there's

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 
about people all over the world there's

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.430 
about people all over the world there's
