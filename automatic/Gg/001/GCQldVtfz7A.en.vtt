00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
into the middle of the chip now like I

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.149 
into the middle of the chip now like I
said<00:01:17.009> you'll<00:01:18.000> notice<00:01:18.270> that<00:01:18.420> this<00:01:18.570> chip<00:01:18.900> is

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159 
said you'll notice that this chip is

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:21.770 
said you'll notice that this chip is
sort<00:01:20.159> of<00:01:20.310> still<00:01:20.610> alive<00:01:21.000> here<00:01:21.450> it's<00:01:21.600> like

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
sort of still alive here it's like

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.219 
sort of still alive here it's like
connected<00:01:22.320> by<00:01:22.470> some<00:01:22.740> of<00:01:22.950> this<00:01:23.960> grip<00:01:24.960> tape

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
connected by some of this grip tape

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.520 
connected by some of this grip tape
that's<00:01:25.500> still<00:01:25.740> there<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.450> so<00:01:27.450> I<00:01:27.750> can<00:01:28.020> sort<00:01:28.380> of

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
that's still there and so I can sort of

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.069 
that's still there and so I can sort of
keep<00:01:29.189> it<00:01:29.369> in<00:01:29.549> there<00:01:29.820> so<00:01:30.360> I<00:01:30.390> put<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.840> glue<00:01:31.049> in

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
keep it in there so I put the glue in

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.510 
keep it in there so I put the glue in
there<00:01:31.350> now<00:01:31.500> I'm<00:01:31.590> gonna<00:01:31.680> squeeze<00:01:32.189> out<00:01:32.490> the

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
there now I'm gonna squeeze out the

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.179 
there now I'm gonna squeeze out the
access<00:01:33.409> and<00:01:34.409> it<00:01:34.500> looks<00:01:34.710> like<00:01:34.740> it's<00:01:34.950> sort<00:01:35.130> of

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
access and it looks like it's sort of

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.530 
access and it looks like it's sort of
staying<00:01:35.430> in<00:01:35.640> there<00:01:35.759> which<00:01:35.909> is<00:01:36.030> perfect

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
staying in there which is perfect

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.950 
staying in there which is perfect

when<00:01:46.200> it<00:01:46.320> hardens<00:01:46.740> it<00:01:46.920> hard<00:01:47.130> it<00:01:47.700> hardens

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
when it hardens it hard it hardens

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.999 
when it hardens it hard it hardens
really<00:01:48.649> really<00:01:49.649> hard

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
really really hard

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:55.219 
really really hard
I<00:01:50.130> grabbed<00:01:50.700> my<00:01:50.899> vise<00:01:51.899> here<00:01:52.610> open<00:01:53.610> it<00:01:53.670> up<00:01:54.229> mm-hmm

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
I grabbed my vise here open it up mm-hmm

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.319 
I grabbed my vise here open it up mm-hmm
I'm<00:01:55.890> gonna<00:01:56.070> join<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.430> two<00:01:56.790> pieces<00:01:57.180> together

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
I'm gonna join the two pieces together

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.429 
I'm gonna join the two pieces together
now<00:01:58.290> this<00:01:58.380> is<00:01:58.530> gonna<00:01:58.710> make<00:01:58.890> sure<00:01:59.270> since<00:02:00.439> wood

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
now this is gonna make sure since wood

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.859 
now this is gonna make sure since wood
glue<00:02:01.619> takes<00:02:01.890> a<00:02:01.950> little<00:02:02.100> longer<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.579> dry<00:02:02.869> then

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
glue takes a little longer to dry then

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.899 
glue takes a little longer to dry then
say<00:02:04.200> super<00:02:04.530> glue<00:02:04.710> which<00:02:04.979> dries<00:02:05.250> like<00:02:05.610> almost

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
say super glue which dries like almost

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.449 
say super glue which dries like almost
instantly<00:02:06.469> so<00:02:07.469> I'm<00:02:07.530> gonna<00:02:07.619> squeeze<00:02:08.069> out<00:02:08.280> this

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
instantly so I'm gonna squeeze out this

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.130 
instantly so I'm gonna squeeze out this
access<00:02:08.910> and<00:02:08.940> as<00:02:09.209> I'm<00:02:09.390> doing<00:02:09.599> it<00:02:09.780> I'll<00:02:09.899> take<00:02:10.110> a

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
access and as I'm doing it I'll take a

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.770 
access and as I'm doing it I'll take a
piece<00:02:10.410> of<00:02:10.530> paper

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
piece of paper

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.240 
piece of paper

piece of towel here clean it up squeeze
a<00:02:17.280> little<00:02:17.460> more<00:02:17.580> out<00:02:18.110> now<00:02:19.110> I<00:02:19.140> know<00:02:19.290> that<00:02:19.560> thing

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
a little more out now I know that thing

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:20.780 
a little more out now I know that thing
is<00:02:19.860> in<00:02:20.100> there<00:02:20.250> good

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
is in there good

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.060 
is in there good

we're not moving too much and be careful
it<00:02:23.190> looks<00:02:23.310> like<00:02:23.430> I<00:02:23.520> got<00:02:23.670> a<00:02:23.700> little<00:02:23.850> bit<00:02:24.060> on<00:02:24.090> my

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
it looks like I got a little bit on my

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:25.550 
it looks like I got a little bit on my
advice<00:02:24.540> so<00:02:24.750> you<00:02:24.810> don't<00:02:24.990> want<00:02:25.140> to<00:02:25.230> glue<00:02:25.410> the

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
advice so you don't want to glue the

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.610 
advice so you don't want to glue the
Vice<00:02:25.740> to<00:02:25.980> your<00:02:26.100> board<00:02:27.500> not<00:02:28.500> too<00:02:28.770> hard<00:02:29.010> to<00:02:29.070> avoid

Vice to your board not too hard to avoid

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.250 
Vice to your board not too hard to avoid
and<00:02:31.620> then<00:02:32.340> just<00:02:32.580> kind<00:02:32.820> of<00:02:32.970> tighten<00:02:33.930> this<00:02:34.020> whole

and then just kind of tighten this whole
thing<00:02:34.560> up<00:02:38.540> then<00:02:39.540> you're<00:02:39.690> going<00:02:39.780> to<00:02:39.870> want<00:02:40.020> to

back and check on it tomorrow and then

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.110 
back and check on it tomorrow and then
one<00:02:45.930> added<00:02:46.380> feature<00:02:46.620> like<00:02:47.010> the<00:02:47.550> next<00:02:47.820> day<00:02:47.970> if

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
one added feature like the next day if

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.060 
one added feature like the next day if
you<00:02:48.270> want<00:02:48.510> you<00:02:48.630> could<00:02:48.750> take<00:02:48.959> some<00:02:49.200> sandpaper

that might come out a little bit so the

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.800 
that might come out a little bit so the
next<00:02:59.670> way<00:02:59.820> that<00:02:59.850> you<00:03:00.150> can<00:03:00.270> repair<00:03:00.600> your

next way that you can repair your
skateboard<00:03:01.320> chip<00:03:01.890> is<00:03:02.780> using<00:03:03.950> shoe<00:03:04.950> goo<00:03:05.130> now

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
skateboard chip is using shoe goo now

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.240 
skateboard chip is using shoe goo now
shoe<00:03:06.270> goo<00:03:06.450> is<00:03:06.600> an<00:03:06.690> awesome<00:03:07.170> thing<00:03:07.800> that<00:03:07.860> was<00:03:08.130> in

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
shoe goo is an awesome thing that was in

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.220 
shoe goo is an awesome thing that was in
I<00:03:08.430> don't<00:03:08.489> know<00:03:08.670> how<00:03:09.090> old<00:03:09.270> this<00:03:09.480> stuff<00:03:09.720> is<00:03:09.900> but<00:03:10.140> I

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
I don't know how old this stuff is but I

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.440 
I don't know how old this stuff is but I
remember<00:03:10.590> seeing<00:03:10.860> it<00:03:10.980> as<00:03:11.100> a<00:03:11.130> kid<00:03:11.430> and<00:03:11.640> it<00:03:12.330> was

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
remember seeing it as a kid and it was

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:13.790 
remember seeing it as a kid and it was
pretty<00:03:12.600> amazing

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
pretty amazing

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.590 
pretty amazing
we<00:03:14.130> used<00:03:14.280> to<00:03:14.340> fix<00:03:14.489> our<00:03:14.610> skateboard<00:03:15.090> shoes<00:03:15.330> with

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
we used to fix our skateboard shoes with

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.390 
we used to fix our skateboard shoes with
it<00:03:15.750> and<00:03:15.930> what<00:03:16.260> it<00:03:16.350> does<00:03:16.500> is<00:03:16.680> it<00:03:16.799> dries<00:03:17.070> to<00:03:17.370> a

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
it and what it does is it dries to a

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.699 
it and what it does is it dries to a
really<00:03:17.670> soft<00:03:17.970> rubber<00:03:18.360> so<00:03:18.630> it's<00:03:19.170> supposed<00:03:19.590> to

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
really soft rubber so it's supposed to

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.130 
really soft rubber so it's supposed to
sort<00:03:20.400> of<00:03:20.489> emulate<00:03:20.790> like<00:03:21.180> the<00:03:21.390> bottom<00:03:21.900> rubber

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
sort of emulate like the bottom rubber

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.250 
sort of emulate like the bottom rubber
of<00:03:22.410> a<00:03:22.530> shoe<00:03:22.860> and<00:03:23.420> you<00:03:24.420> want<00:03:24.630> it<00:03:24.720> to<00:03:24.810> be<00:03:24.930> sort<00:03:25.200> of

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
of a shoe and you want it to be sort of

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.699 
of a shoe and you want it to be sort of
grippy<00:03:25.650> not<00:03:26.250> too<00:03:26.459> hard<00:03:26.700> now<00:03:27.450> let's<00:03:27.630> say<00:03:27.930> just

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
grippy not too hard now let's say just

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.220 
grippy not too hard now let's say just
for<00:03:28.890> the<00:03:29.160> sake<00:03:29.850> of<00:03:29.910> this<00:03:30.180> experiment<00:03:30.870> here<00:03:31.049> or

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
for the sake of this experiment here or

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:36.470 
for the sake of this experiment here or
example<00:03:31.980> that<00:03:32.430> this<00:03:32.760> chip<00:03:33.540> has<00:03:33.959> been<00:03:34.170> lost<00:03:35.480> the

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
example that this chip has been lost the

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.630 
example that this chip has been lost the
chip<00:03:36.720> is<00:03:36.870> gone<00:03:37.080> and<00:03:38.010> we<00:03:38.100> just<00:03:38.310> have<00:03:38.459> this

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
chip is gone and we just have this

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.479 
chip is gone and we just have this
missing<00:03:39.630> space<00:03:39.989> in<00:03:40.230> your<00:03:40.320> skateboard<00:03:40.860> now

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
missing space in your skateboard now

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:44.330 
missing space in your skateboard now
what<00:03:41.640> you<00:03:41.760> could<00:03:41.880> do<00:03:42.090> is<00:03:42.769> take<00:03:43.769> your<00:03:43.890> shoe<00:03:44.130> goo

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
what you could do is take your shoe goo

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.850 
what you could do is take your shoe goo
and<00:03:44.579> you'll<00:03:45.420> want<00:03:45.630> a<00:03:45.720> well-ventilated<00:03:46.170> area

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
and you'll want a well-ventilated area

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.319 
and you'll want a well-ventilated area
this<00:03:47.040> stuff<00:03:47.340> smells<00:03:47.519> like<00:03:48.200> very<00:03:49.200> toxic<00:03:50.329> very

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:51.329 
this stuff smells like very toxic very

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:55.370 
this stuff smells like very toxic very
strong<00:03:51.750> and<00:03:52.250> just<00:03:53.250> apply<00:03:53.750> just<00:03:54.750> look<00:03:54.930> really

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
strong and just apply just look really

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.800 
strong and just apply just look really
not<00:03:55.560> too<00:03:55.829> much<00:03:55.860> you<00:03:56.070> go<00:03:56.459> into<00:03:56.790> this<00:03:56.880> thing

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.310 

there<00:04:00.810> we<00:04:00.930> go

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320 
there we go

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:05.360 
there we go
and<00:04:01.410> then<00:04:02.239> I'll<00:04:03.239> use<00:04:03.299> the<00:04:03.540> chip<00:04:03.959> to<00:04:04.709> help<00:04:04.920> put

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
and then I'll use the chip to help put

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.060 
and then I'll use the chip to help put
this<00:04:05.630> smooth<00:04:06.630> this<00:04:06.840> out<00:04:07.079> now<00:04:07.530> shoo<00:04:07.739> goo<00:04:07.890> is<00:04:08.040> a

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
this smooth this out now shoo goo is a

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:09.710 
this smooth this out now shoo goo is a
lot<00:04:08.310> harder<00:04:08.519> to<00:04:08.700> work<00:04:08.820> with<00:04:08.880> than<00:04:09.060> the<00:04:09.239> than

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
lot harder to work with than the than

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.100 
lot harder to work with than the than
the<00:04:09.840> glue<00:04:10.100> because<00:04:11.100> it<00:04:11.130> sticks<00:04:11.610> to<00:04:11.820> everything

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:12.110 
the glue because it sticks to everything

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:14.390 
the glue because it sticks to everything
so<00:04:13.110> if<00:04:13.230> you<00:04:13.350> have<00:04:13.530> trouble<00:04:13.769> with<00:04:13.950> it<00:04:14.070> getting

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
so if you have trouble with it getting

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.520 
so if you have trouble with it getting
on<00:04:14.489> everything<00:04:15.019> one<00:04:16.019> way<00:04:16.169> that<00:04:16.290> you<00:04:16.410> can

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
on everything one way that you can

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.069 
on everything one way that you can
smooth<00:04:16.859> this<00:04:17.070> out<00:04:17.310> is<00:04:17.519> by<00:04:18.239> using<00:04:18.419> an<00:04:18.630> ice<00:04:18.750> cube

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
smooth this out is by using an ice cube

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.650 
smooth this out is by using an ice cube
and<00:04:19.320> what<00:04:20.250> it<00:04:20.340> does<00:04:20.489> is<00:04:20.609> it<00:04:20.760> kind<00:04:21.060> of<00:04:21.209> kills<00:04:21.450> it

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
and what it does is it kind of kills it

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.430 
and what it does is it kind of kills it
while<00:04:21.810> it<00:04:21.959> slides<00:04:22.229> over<00:04:22.410> it<00:04:22.680> but<00:04:23.690> for<00:04:24.690> this<00:04:24.780> for

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
while it slides over it but for this for

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.300 
while it slides over it but for this for
this<00:04:25.560> amount<00:04:25.890> of

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
this amount of

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.830 
this amount of
of<00:04:26.520> a<00:04:26.580> chip<00:04:26.850> you<00:04:26.880> don't<00:04:27.150> really<00:04:27.300> need<00:04:27.480> too<00:04:27.660> big

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
of a chip you don't really need too big

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.350 
of a chip you don't really need too big
one<00:04:28.050> so<00:04:28.740> now<00:04:28.860> I<00:04:28.889> fold<00:04:29.370> the<00:04:29.610> grip<00:04:29.820> tape<00:04:30.030> back

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
one so now I fold the grip tape back

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:38.000 
one so now I fold the grip tape back
over<00:04:30.660> the<00:04:31.350> space<00:04:35.030> and<00:04:36.440> with<00:04:37.440> this<00:04:37.560> one<00:04:37.740> too<00:04:37.889> you

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
over the space and with this one too you

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:40.970 
over the space and with this one too you
want<00:04:38.190> to<00:04:38.250> do<00:04:38.370> this<00:04:38.490> with<00:04:39.360> about<00:04:39.630> ten<00:04:40.320> hours<00:04:40.350> to

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:40.980 
want to do this with about ten hours to

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.040 
want to do this with about ten hours to
wait<00:04:41.130> because<00:04:42.030> you<00:04:42.060> want<00:04:42.330> this<00:04:42.630> one's<00:04:42.870> going

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
wait because you want this one's going

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.340 
wait because you want this one's going
to<00:04:43.080> take<00:04:43.290> a<00:04:43.350> little<00:04:43.650> bit<00:04:43.860> longer<00:04:44.660> than<00:04:45.660> glue

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.350 
to take a little bit longer than glue

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:51.530 
to take a little bit longer than glue
even<00:04:46.919> so<00:04:47.280> maybe<00:04:49.310> maybe<00:04:50.310> twelve<00:04:50.820> fourteen

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:51.540 
even so maybe maybe twelve fourteen

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:54.680 
even so maybe maybe twelve fourteen
hours<00:04:52.020> and<00:04:52.580> this<00:04:53.580> is<00:04:53.820> how<00:04:54.000> you<00:04:54.060> repair

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690 
hours and this is how you repair

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.409 
hours and this is how you repair
