00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.960
 greet them thank you for tuning in and 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.300
 Friday weekend and good already the 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.000
 change is important in temperature and 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.559
 in the rain the instability is already 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.299
 presented here in Monterrey I hope that 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.699
 are taking precautions that have 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.410
 patience right now there's a lot of traffic on 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.240
 pavement becomes very slippery 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.920
 seat belt use and 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.570
 handle at very low speed that the most 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.820
 important that you get with good to 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.800
 our homes we are going to start with the 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.080
 information the temperature between 18 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.149
 and 17 degrees is oscillating very 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.670
 fresh we have high humidity in a 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.739
 74 percent because of this well then 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.570
 the pavement and the rain that becomes 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.760
 slippery due to rain the wind 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.739
 up to 19 kilometers that is 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.649
 blowing right now from the east 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.899
 southeast and the pressure in 2015 millibars 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.329
 let's see tomorrow Saturday, well, a 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.879
 panorama that is not favorable but then to 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.350
 take good care of extreme precautions 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.420
 as I keep saying and we never 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.280
 we will tire of course to remind you 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.739
 to be careful, we have the maximum in 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.320
 18 degrees Celsius the minimum in the 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.270
 13 with the sky very cloudy 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.460
 the sun rises tomorrow if there is no 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.440
 problem only to enjoy it we have 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.300
 on Sunday it seems that a 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.880
 little bit more like with rain the 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:17.130
 maximum at 20 degrees centigrade already to 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.900
 starting next Monday is when 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.640
 again the temperature rises more 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.500
 reaching up to 26 degrees 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.750
 centigrade the sky very cloudy the 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.580
 maximum as I comment them already ascends 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.940
 until the 26th and not for the 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.710
 next tuesday until 28 wednesday 32 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.690
 again the abrupt change in 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.790
 temperatures after today 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.979

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.869

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.070

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.710
 there is no rain otherwise Friday 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.600

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.360
 minimum on Friday and Saturday next 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.550

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.680
 they have maximum as minimum forgiveness 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.410
 maximum on Friday at 25 on Saturday until 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.050

 cool and then after the other heat and 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.890
