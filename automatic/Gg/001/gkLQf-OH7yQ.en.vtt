00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.950
 version 1.0 three data packages 3.0 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.389
 good friends here is the last 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.639
 update of konami packet data 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.680
 3.0 where he brings us so many 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.050
 news many, many corrections apart 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.420
 to cause the signings of the past 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:25.109
 updated signings bring arrangements 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:31.410
 and various things and the truth of errors and 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:35.010
 I had not seen anything free calls 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.469
 things that I did not know and then we have 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.390
 brought small improvements in the 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.530
 quite significant representatives 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.969
 that we are going to see next but 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.770
 before let's also look at what we 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.570
 they have put a representative direction but 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.850
 so players buys but had more the 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.129
 manga or study the fight to not be clear 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.719
 is that you have several of the attributes 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.570
 good here we have the new 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.010
 remaining or rather the new form 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.270
 to teach us the percentages of each 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.920
 ball that can give us the 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.989
 representatives that we select by 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.609
 example this is from here and it 's a 16 by 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.379
 hundred of options say if the balls 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.630
 black and the least and you go to the 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.229
 always the typical 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.670
 a 14.67 depending on the representative 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.159
 that you select, I think it is 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.299
 quite good because I have an idea 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:16.369
 much more clear than you are 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:18.500
 doing but friends this is not limited 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:19.460
 only the star representatives 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.869
 no way 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.720
 it's something that I liked a lot 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:25.909
 because we give an amplitude a way of 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.399
 do things or funds more 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:30.079
 interesting have also put this in 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:31.700
 representatives of agents to the 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:33.259
 we can select a normal 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.750
 point of three similar to see by the 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:37.520
 see if we were born three representatives 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.830
 three by three we have a 1.2 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.500
 hundred of getting a ball player 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.539
 of fat fix the percentage what low 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.939
 what is this tendency is the one who does not 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:48.560
 you imagine 21% pocket you imagine what 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:50.270
 you can see now you can see it clearly that 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.030
 you imagine it is that that's the beauty 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.189
 is the funny thing about this now we see a 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.649
 little bit so if we do certain 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:02:00.590
 combinations and what options do we have of 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:02.479
 draw certain players or a certain type 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.789
 of travel player not because neither 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:08.770
 you can hit to get a power in 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:11.770
 concrete but to a type of player 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.060
 a specific cut of player is the most 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.680
 interesting now well what I most 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.100
 like not life for a player who has 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.780
 more power or speed as well in a 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.480
 specific position you have to lose a 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.550
 player with those characteristics 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.050
 that I can try to use with 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.540
 neither do I need to be 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.890
 all but rolling - at least friends 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.810
 good you are seeing what I am doing 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.510
 different combinations so to see 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:37.120
 the percentages the greatest is the 36 with 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.760
 3 stars with 1.2 percent for 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:43.060
 get the black ball the rest then it goes 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:46.270
 varying from 0.4 I think it would be three 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.970
 balls three stars of a few jumps the 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.440
 rescue of a star and there not what 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.570
 I can check because I do not have the 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.760
 third of a co2 star just like that 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:58.830
 that I put 12 stars stay 0.5 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.830
 so I assume it will be between 0.3 and 0.5 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:05.730
 we will make a ball opening but that 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:10.020
 is going to be the next gameplay I from 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:11.430
 moment I wanted to teach all this I think 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:13.800
 continuations I wanted to put something that 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.330
 really if you do not want to see it it's nothing 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.710
 is what you can remove that here the video does not 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.320
 it's worth it has nothing that shines 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:21.300
 with the transactions and what you have to 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:25.770
 see more is with the team spirit and 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:27.980
 I finally got the 99 spirit 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:27.980
 of team 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.850
 well here you have me recovering 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.160
 players and physically and watching that my 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:46.680
 spirit of 99 and I did not skip the achievement 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.370
 but what happens let's see this can not 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.230
 be 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:52.080
 it does not make sense I have 99 it's not up to 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:54.810
 achievement at the end and from the menu this and I 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:58.080
 it came out the accomplishment accomplished finally I 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:00.510
 gave of 50 varieties of minecraft as well 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.660
 who finally answered happy I went 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.420
 to 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:06.610
 the achievements to see us there are 15 of 15 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.200
 fix as many compliments as perfect 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:11.550
 the last one that I had left was that 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:14.550
 excellent team spirit so 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:18.290
 I feel like mission accomplished mission 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:18.290
 fulfilled guys until then
