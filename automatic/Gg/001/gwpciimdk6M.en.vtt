 in the day I was in a little hurry 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.759
 so I'll end up spending a little more 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.860
 but it will be a bit more relaxed 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:56.790

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:28.020

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:30.030
 how I did the kindergarten in the city I had 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:35.160

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.949
 and then I went back again if you buy 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:46.440
 an item from some other city has no 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:48.150
 problem you can speak the name of the 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.340
 city but that is always the name of the 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.650
 City and that's what he'll talk to 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:56.069
 thing in the end, you say, I passed then 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:58.800

00:04:56.069 --> 00:05:01.560

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.870
