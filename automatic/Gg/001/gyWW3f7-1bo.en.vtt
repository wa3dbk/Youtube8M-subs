 moved into the city center 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.740

 who is welcomed if by the house 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.179
 bejart and we are do you figure in 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.610
 a piece a bit mythical because 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.559
 it is here that maurice Béjart created these 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.660
 balls and the most known as the 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.460
 bolero or the firebird jacques 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.480
 next to me michel robert his true friends 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.469
 at home you are president 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.899
 Bejart it's true we're in a 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.090
 mythical place here is enough 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.200
 unbelievable bejart has always said that these 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.710
 whales and the most important he had 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.899
 created between 1960 and 1970 to the legend that 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.039
 no that's what had told me and it's this 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.320
 which is quite confirmed by 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.660
 others so the important thing is that we have 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.879
 wanted to revive this place and 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.129
 to offer it to a conservatory a non-profit organization 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.570
 independent called the studio 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.939
 mauritius house Béjart and which has for 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.250
 vocation to defend and promote the 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.200
 classical dance that directed by media 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.930

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.250
 artistic you hear and who was 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.900
 a big star 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.850

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.370
 also danced with the great noureev 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.540

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.800
 because in this house to the pros to 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.990
 upper level 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.580
 there is what is called the loft or 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.870
 Bejart lived a photo exhibition 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.729

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:32.100

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.479
 different activities of which 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.860
 now this great exhibition but 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.930
 I have a free course which has for 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.190
 vocation to show a few things 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.080
 that we do not really know of a 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.300
 minivan maurice bejart ie already 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.790
 his younger years before brussels 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.619
 before his arrival in 1959 with ballet 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.300
 stars and there really is already a 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.280
 important heritage symphony for a 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.810
 single man for example in a very word 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.610
 briefly how come Béjart 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.930
 is also known today 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.930
 but bigeard is one of the biggest 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.940
 choreographers from around the world the jara 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:12.850
 popularize dance in general and he has 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:15.970
 really given a new impetus at once 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:18.400
 uniting the spiritual and the imaginary 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:21.490
 and at the same time giving a movement 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:24.520
 young and creative to dance thank you 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.660
 a lot it's true that Béjart and 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.550
 everywhere in this house you can 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.230

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.200
