hey<00:00:06.629> guys<00:00:06.839> I'm<00:00:07.109> Isaiah<00:00:07.529> and<00:00:07.799> welcome<00:00:08.460> today's

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
hey guys I'm Isaiah and welcome today's

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.120 
hey guys I'm Isaiah and welcome today's
episode<00:00:09.090> we're<00:00:09.240> going<00:00:09.330> to<00:00:09.389> have<00:00:09.570> a<00:00:09.599> start<00:00:09.929> at

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:10.130 
episode we're going to have a start at

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.180 
episode we're going to have a start at
factorization<00:00:11.130> today<00:00:11.370> we're<00:00:12.090> going<00:00:12.480> to<00:00:13.190> start

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
factorization today we're going to start

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.039 
factorization today we're going to start
by<00:00:14.370> generating<00:00:14.730> some<00:00:15.179> steam<00:00:15.450> power<00:00:15.719> through

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
by generating some steam power through

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.070 
by generating some steam power through
factorization<00:00:16.859> and<00:00:17.039> we're<00:00:17.520> going<00:00:17.670> to

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:18.080 
factorization and we're going to

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.599 
factorization and we're going to
basically<00:00:19.080> create<00:00:19.289> a<00:00:19.680> battery<00:00:20.010> to<00:00:20.310> store<00:00:20.550> the

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
basically create a battery to store the

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.810 
basically create a battery to store the
power<00:00:20.760> and<00:00:21.060> we're<00:00:21.990> also<00:00:22.109> going<00:00:22.470> to<00:00:22.670> use<00:00:23.670> that

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
power and we're also going to use that

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.349 
power and we're also going to use that
power<00:00:24.000> in<00:00:24.390> a<00:00:25.130> Ana<00:00:26.130> heater<00:00:26.340> so<00:00:27.000> we<00:00:27.150> can

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
power in a Ana heater so we can

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.130 
power in a Ana heater so we can
essentially<00:00:27.960> smelt<00:00:28.320> stuff<00:00:28.590> with<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.310> power

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.140 
essentially smelt stuff with the power

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.229 
essentially smelt stuff with the power
and<00:00:31.140> let's<00:00:31.560> get<00:00:31.890> cracking<00:00:32.279> okay<00:00:32.790> it's<00:00:33.149> the

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
and let's get cracking okay it's the

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.970 
and let's get cracking okay it's the
first<00:00:33.270> thing<00:00:33.690> you're<00:00:34.380> gonna<00:00:34.469> need<00:00:34.620> a<00:00:34.680> steam

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
first thing you're gonna need a steam

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.560 
first thing you're gonna need a steam
boiler<00:00:35.190> so<00:00:35.790> it's<00:00:35.940> pretty<00:00:36.030> much<00:00:36.149> just<00:00:36.239> a<00:00:36.420> couple

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
boiler so it's pretty much just a couple

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.740 
boiler so it's pretty much just a couple
of<00:00:36.660> iron<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:37.290> iron<00:00:37.680> bars<00:00:37.739> pretty<00:00:38.250> simple<00:00:38.750> and

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
of iron and iron bars pretty simple and

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.410 
of iron and iron bars pretty simple and
what<00:00:40.590> you<00:00:40.649> want<00:00:40.770> to<00:00:40.829> do<00:00:40.920> is<00:00:41.129> is<00:00:41.610> you<00:00:41.969> want<00:00:42.390> to

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
what you want to do is is you want to

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.979 
what you want to do is is you want to
place<00:00:42.510> it<00:00:42.719> above<00:00:42.899> water<00:00:43.250> preferably<00:00:44.250> a

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 
place it above water preferably a

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:46.729 
place it above water preferably a
infinite<00:00:45.989> source<00:00:46.200> of<00:00:46.289> water<00:00:46.469> because<00:00:46.620> it

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
infinite source of water because it

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.799 
infinite source of water because it
draws<00:00:47.129> water<00:00:47.460> up<00:00:47.700> in<00:00:47.910> into<00:00:48.510> it<00:00:49.820> okay<00:00:50.820> spread

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
draws water up in into it okay spread

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.450 
draws water up in into it okay spread
that<00:00:52.020> story<00:00:52.410> I<00:00:52.620> mean<00:00:52.770> coals<00:00:52.980> down<00:00:55.460> certain

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
that story I mean coals down certain

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.450 
that story I mean coals down certain
mods<00:00:56.789> are<00:00:57.180> able<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:57.780> extract<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:59.100> water<00:00:59.190> out

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
mods are able to extract the water out

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.569 
mods are able to extract the water out
of<00:00:59.489> it<00:00:59.670> so<00:00:59.820> they<00:00:59.969> do<00:01:00.030> actually<00:01:00.539> work<00:01:01.079> like

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:01.579 
of it so they do actually work like

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:04.189 
of it so they do actually work like
activists<00:01:02.579> accumulators<00:01:03.149> if<00:01:03.329> you<00:01:03.840> can<00:01:03.989> find

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
activists accumulators if you can find

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.260 
activists accumulators if you can find
the<00:01:04.350> right<00:01:04.500> pipe<00:01:04.830> that'll<00:01:05.129> poured<00:01:05.400> out<00:01:05.549> now<00:01:06.150> if

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
the right pipe that'll poured out now if

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.850 
the right pipe that'll poured out now if
you<00:01:06.360> got<00:01:06.510> rotorcraft<00:01:06.979> the<00:01:09.320> forward<00:01:10.320> pipes<00:01:10.530> i

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
you got rotorcraft the forward pipes i

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.890 
you got rotorcraft the forward pipes i
believe<00:01:11.369> all<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.270> liquid<00:01:12.510> pops<00:01:12.689> what<00:01:12.869> i

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
believe all the liquid pops what i

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:13.910 
believe all the liquid pops what i
camera<00:01:13.080> with<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.290> cold<00:01:13.470> right<00:01:13.619> now

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
camera with the cold right now

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.890 
camera with the cold right now
but<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.430> rotorcraft<00:01:14.700> pipes<00:01:15.150> are<00:01:15.360> capable<00:01:15.840> of

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
but the rotorcraft pipes are capable of

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.649 
but the rotorcraft pipes are capable of
pulling<00:01:16.170> water<00:01:16.439> out<00:01:16.590> of<00:01:16.710> them<00:01:17.119> so<00:01:18.119> you<00:01:18.180> can<00:01:18.479> use

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
pulling water out of them so you can use

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.660 
pulling water out of them so you can use
them<00:01:18.780> as<00:01:18.930> a<00:01:18.960> like<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.409> water<00:01:20.040> source<00:01:20.280> of<00:01:20.430> really

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
them as a like a water source of really

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.120 
them as a like a water source of really
cheap<00:01:20.880> water<00:01:21.150> source<00:01:21.680> okay<00:01:22.680> so<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:23.009> next

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
cheap water source okay so the next

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.740 
cheap water source okay so the next
thing<00:01:23.250> you<00:01:23.430> need<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.640> do<00:01:24.000> is<00:01:24.240> make<00:01:24.570> some

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
thing you need to do is make some

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.960 
thing you need to do is make some
mirrors<00:01:25.170> roots<00:01:26.070> appear<00:01:26.280> on<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:26.430> glass<00:01:26.700> pane

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
mirrors roots appear on a glass pane

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.999 
mirrors roots appear on a glass pane
with<00:01:27.240> quite<00:01:27.479> a<00:01:27.509> bit<00:01:27.630> of<00:01:27.750> silver<00:01:28.170> now<00:01:28.470> this<00:01:28.650> mod

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
with quite a bit of silver now this mod

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.270 
with quite a bit of silver now this mod
uses<00:01:29.460> a<00:01:29.490> bit<00:01:29.700> quite<00:01:30.119> a<00:01:30.150> bit<00:01:30.420> of<00:01:30.540> silver<00:01:30.720> and

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
uses a bit quite a bit of silver and

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.760 
uses a bit quite a bit of silver and
quite<00:01:32.280> a<00:01:32.310> bit<00:01:32.460> of<00:01:32.549> wet<00:01:33.439> that's<00:01:34.439> alright

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
quite a bit of wet that's alright

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.980 
quite a bit of wet that's alright
because<00:01:34.890> I<00:01:35.040> later<00:01:35.460> on<00:01:35.549> when<00:01:35.909> you<00:01:36.000> get<00:01:36.150> into<00:01:36.659> the

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
because I later on when you get into the

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.420 
because I later on when you get into the
or<00:01:37.290> proxy<00:01:37.920> or<00:01:38.250> processing<00:01:38.970> side<00:01:40.189> when<00:01:41.189> you<00:01:41.280> are

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
or proxy or processing side when you are

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.429 
or proxy or processing side when you are
processing<00:01:41.759> silver<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:42.600> let<00:01:42.810> you<00:01:43.020> do<00:01:43.170> get

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
processing silver and let you do get

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.670 
processing silver and let you do get
extra<00:01:43.860> amount<00:01:44.070> of<00:01:44.220> vice<00:01:45.119> versa<00:01:45.149> each<00:01:45.659> one<00:01:45.899> so

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
extra amount of vice versa each one so

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.130 
extra amount of vice versa each one so
yeah<00:01:47.040> I'm<00:01:47.430> supposed<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:47.759> make<00:01:47.909> that<00:01:49.729> okay<00:01:51.140> you

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
yeah I'm supposed to make that okay you

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.410 
yeah I'm supposed to make that okay you
know<00:01:52.200> soft<00:01:52.470> eight<00:01:52.649> mirrors<00:01:53.009> and<00:01:53.220> such<00:01:54.210> what

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
know soft eight mirrors and such what

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.690 
know soft eight mirrors and such what
these<00:01:54.720> mirrors<00:01:55.110> do<00:01:55.320> is<00:01:55.560> you<00:01:56.189> place<00:01:56.430> them<00:01:56.579> down

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
these mirrors do is you place them down

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.819 
these mirrors do is you place them down
on<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:56.880> ground<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:57.380> if<00:01:58.380> they're<00:01:58.680> within

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
on the ground and if they're within

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.330 
on the ground and if they're within
range<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:59.399> they've<00:01:59.700> got<00:01:59.909> a<00:02:00.060> line<00:02:00.600> of<00:02:00.659> sight<00:02:00.960> to

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
range and they've got a line of sight to

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.700 
range and they've got a line of sight to
the<00:02:02.340> steam<00:02:02.579> boil<00:02:02.880> they<00:02:03.689> will<00:02:04.020> direct

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
the steam boil they will direct

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:10.900 
the steam boil they will direct
themselves<00:02:05.899> towards<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:07.829> steam<00:02:08.099> boiler

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.060 

one<00:02:11.910> more<00:02:12.090> like<00:02:12.270> that<00:02:12.300> and<00:02:12.810> now<00:02:13.620> the<00:02:13.680> stink

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
one more like that and now the stink

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:15.470 
one more like that and now the stink
ball<00:02:14.190> essentially<00:02:14.580> takes<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:14.820> water<00:02:15.000> in<00:02:15.240> it

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
ball essentially takes the water in it

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.740 
ball essentially takes the water in it
gets<00:02:15.660> heated<00:02:15.840> up<00:02:16.050> by<00:02:16.350> the<00:02:17.340> daytime<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:18.450> Sun

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
gets heated up by the daytime the Sun

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.310 
gets heated up by the daytime the Sun
the<00:02:19.530> Sun<00:02:19.740> doesn't<00:02:19.950> lock<00:02:20.220> the<00:02:20.340> daytime<00:02:20.670> and<00:02:21.320> at

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
the Sun doesn't lock the daytime and at

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.800 
the Sun doesn't lock the daytime and at
the<00:02:22.740> top<00:02:23.010> you<00:02:23.460> can<00:02:23.490> see<00:02:23.640> there's<00:02:24.390> an<00:02:24.510> opening

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
the top you can see there's an opening

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.610 
the top you can see there's an opening
you<00:02:25.010> can<00:02:26.010> pipe<00:02:26.460> the<00:02:26.930> steam<00:02:27.930> produced<00:02:28.200> at<00:02:28.470> the

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
you can pipe the steam produced at the

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.340 
you can pipe the steam produced at the
top<00:02:28.800> now<00:02:29.520> you<00:02:29.580> can't<00:02:30.150> actually<00:02:30.390> put<00:02:30.690> two<00:02:31.290> of

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
top now you can't actually put two of

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.020 
top now you can't actually put two of
these<00:02:31.470> boilers<00:02:31.920> on<00:02:32.130> top<00:02:32.280> one<00:02:32.430> love<00:02:32.580> it<00:02:32.700> in<00:02:32.850> fact

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
these boilers on top one love it in fact

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.490 
these boilers on top one love it in fact
you<00:02:33.150> can<00:02:33.270> put<00:02:33.390> as<00:02:33.600> many<00:02:33.720> as<00:02:33.840> you<00:02:33.990> want<00:02:34.020> on<00:02:34.320> top

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
you can put as many as you want on top

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.710 
you can put as many as you want on top
of<00:02:34.620> each<00:02:34.740> other<00:02:34.950> and<00:02:35.280> so<00:02:35.360> you<00:02:36.360> can<00:02:36.570> get

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
of each other and so you can get

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.830 
of each other and so you can get
multiple<00:02:37.290> layers<00:02:37.770> of<00:02:37.800> mirrors<00:02:38.220> and<00:02:38.840> create

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
multiple layers of mirrors and create

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.290 
multiple layers of mirrors and create
more<00:02:40.080> steam<00:02:40.350> if<00:02:40.560> you<00:02:40.740> feel<00:02:41.010> like<00:02:41.160> it<00:02:41.310> okay<00:02:42.270> so

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
more steam if you feel like it okay so

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.680 
more steam if you feel like it okay so
on<00:02:43.260> to<00:02:43.320> the<00:02:43.590> next<00:02:43.680> bit<00:02:44.090> the<00:02:45.090> next<00:02:45.300> part<00:02:45.510> is

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
on to the next bit the next part is

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.320 
on to the next bit the next part is
actually<00:02:46.020> making<00:02:46.350> the<00:02:46.500> battery<00:02:46.890> so<00:02:47.459> it's<00:02:48.180> as

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
actually making the battery so it's as

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.690 
actually making the battery so it's as
forward<00:02:48.720> for<00:02:48.930> iron<00:02:49.200> and<00:02:49.530> sulfuric<00:02:50.130> acid<00:02:50.459> and

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
forward for iron and sulfuric acid and

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.050 
forward for iron and sulfuric acid and
it's<00:02:51.209> pretty<00:02:51.390> easy<00:02:51.480> to<00:02:51.660> make<00:02:51.810> sulfuric<00:02:52.260> acid

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
it's pretty easy to make sulfuric acid

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.430 
it's pretty easy to make sulfuric acid
generally<00:02:54.060> it's<00:02:54.150> just<00:02:54.180> true<00:02:54.450> gunpowder<00:02:54.959> one

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
generally it's just true gunpowder one

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.960 
generally it's just true gunpowder one
piece<00:02:55.620> of<00:02:55.770> coal<00:02:55.980> and<00:02:57.410> I<00:02:58.580> forgot<00:02:59.580> what<00:02:59.760> is<00:02:59.880> it

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
piece of coal and I forgot what is it

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.030 
piece of coal and I forgot what is it
and<00:03:00.090> water<00:03:00.570> of<00:03:00.660> course<00:03:00.840> this<00:03:01.140> it's<00:03:01.800> just<00:03:01.980> a

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
and water of course this it's just a

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.280 
and water of course this it's just a
bottle<00:03:02.340> voila<00:03:02.610> and<00:03:03.270> just<00:03:04.020> gonna<00:03:04.110> make<00:03:04.200> a

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
bottle voila and just gonna make a

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.430 
bottle voila and just gonna make a
battery<00:03:04.680> now<00:03:05.640> I've<00:03:06.060> actually<00:03:06.180> made<00:03:06.450> three

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
battery now I've actually made three

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.010 
battery now I've actually made three
batteries<00:03:07.739> to<00:03:07.890> this<00:03:07.980> because<00:03:08.780> this<00:03:09.780> recipe

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
batteries to this because this recipe

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.900 
batteries to this because this recipe
here<00:03:10.350> for<00:03:10.500> the<00:03:10.560> next<00:03:10.770> part<00:03:10.950> a<00:03:11.100> motor<00:03:11.370> which<00:03:11.670> you

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
here for the next part a motor which you

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.600 
here for the next part a motor which you
generally<00:03:12.300> will<00:03:12.840> make<00:03:13.110> quite<00:03:13.709> a<00:03:13.769> few<00:03:13.860> even

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
generally will make quite a few even

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.789 
generally will make quite a few even
factorization<00:03:15.390> does<00:03:15.870> require<00:03:16.110> battery<00:03:16.590> and

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
factorization does require battery and

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:18.920 
factorization does require battery and
when<00:03:17.730> you<00:03:17.790> first<00:03:17.970> make<00:03:18.150> them<00:03:18.330> they're<00:03:18.630> 100

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
when you first make them they're 100

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.410 
when you first make them they're 100
cent<00:03:19.080> charged<00:03:19.380> and<00:03:19.880> so<00:03:20.880> when<00:03:21.090> you<00:03:21.150> put<00:03:21.330> this

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
cent charged and so when you put this

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.539 
cent charged and so when you put this
into<00:03:21.600> a<00:03:21.720> recipe<00:03:21.959> and<00:03:22.650> you<00:03:23.040> pull<00:03:23.220> the<00:03:23.310> motor<00:03:23.430> out

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
into a recipe and you pull the motor out

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:26.240 
into a recipe and you pull the motor out
you<00:03:23.850> still<00:03:24.269> get<00:03:24.420> your<00:03:24.540> battery<00:03:24.840> but<00:03:25.410> 40<00:03:26.070> cent

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
you still get your battery but 40 cent

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.380 
you still get your battery but 40 cent
charge<00:03:26.310> has<00:03:26.670> been<00:03:26.820> used<00:03:27.030> so<00:03:27.799> yeah<00:03:29.150> we'll<00:03:30.150> use<00:03:30.180> a

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
charge has been used so yeah we'll use a

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.110 
charge has been used so yeah we'll use a
battery<00:03:30.690> later<00:03:30.989> on<00:03:31.140> and<00:03:31.470> then<00:03:32.220> the<00:03:32.790> next<00:03:33.000> one

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
battery later on and then the next one

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.470 
battery later on and then the next one
is<00:03:33.360> a<00:03:33.870> I<00:03:34.170> forgot<00:03:34.470> scored<00:03:34.709> arm<00:03:35.239> we'll<00:03:36.239> see<00:03:36.390> in

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
is a I forgot scored arm we'll see in

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.360 
is a I forgot scored arm we'll see in
just<00:03:36.540> a<00:03:36.690> moment<00:03:36.989> you<00:03:37.709> can<00:03:37.830> basically<00:03:37.980> get<00:03:38.220> the

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
just a moment you can basically get the

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.340 
just a moment you can basically get the
battery<00:03:38.640> that<00:03:38.790> you've<00:03:38.970> not<00:03:39.690> the<00:03:39.810> battery<00:03:40.049> the

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
battery that you've not the battery the

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.070 
battery that you've not the battery the
motor<00:03:40.530> you've<00:03:40.680> just<00:03:40.860> created<00:03:41.150> put<00:03:42.150> in<00:03:42.239> it<00:03:42.420> put

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 
motor you've just created put in it put

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.810 
motor you've just created put in it put
it<00:03:43.140> in<00:03:43.200> with<00:03:43.320> a<00:03:43.380> pressurizer<00:03:43.860> to<00:03:44.280> cross<00:03:44.519> panes

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
it in with a pressurizer to cross panes

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.180 
it in with a pressurizer to cross panes
iron<00:03:45.180> bars<00:03:45.540> it's<00:03:45.989> wet<00:03:46.290> and<00:03:46.320> you<00:03:46.769> get<00:03:46.920> a<00:03:46.950> steam

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
iron bars it's wet and you get a steam

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.030 
iron bars it's wet and you get a steam
turbine<00:03:47.549> so<00:03:48.420> this<00:03:48.510> is<00:03:48.600> what<00:03:48.690> turns<00:03:48.959> the<00:03:49.350> steam

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
turbine so this is what turns the steam

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.320 
turbine so this is what turns the steam
into<00:03:51.200> basically<00:03:52.200> the<00:03:52.470> what<00:03:53.370> they<00:03:53.549> refer<00:03:54.120> to<00:03:54.150> as

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
into basically the what they refer to as

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.729 
into basically the what they refer to as
charge<00:03:54.690> or<00:03:55.200> power<00:03:55.650> and<00:03:56.900> yeah<00:03:57.900> so<00:03:58.320> next<00:03:58.590> thing

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
charge or power and yeah so next thing

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:02.870 
charge or power and yeah so next thing
actually<00:03:59.340> first<00:03:59.880> of<00:04:00.000> all<00:04:00.090> what<00:04:00.299> some<00:04:00.540> Oh<00:04:01.880> yep

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
actually first of all what some Oh yep

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.020 
actually first of all what some Oh yep
let's<00:04:03.420> just<00:04:03.600> set<00:04:04.380> these<00:04:04.500> things<00:04:04.650> up<00:04:04.880> so<00:04:05.880> I'm

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
let's just set these things up so I'm

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.410 
let's just set these things up so I'm
gonna<00:04:06.180> set<00:04:06.450> it<00:04:06.480> up<00:04:06.660> right<00:04:07.440> there<00:04:07.769> and<00:04:08.420> I'm

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
gonna set it up right there and I'm

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.170 
gonna set it up right there and I'm
going<00:04:09.540> to<00:04:09.570> use<00:04:09.720> a<00:04:10.489> forward<00:04:11.489> pipe<00:04:11.760> so<00:04:12.000> you<00:04:12.060> can

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
going to use a forward pipe so you can

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.140 
going to use a forward pipe so you can
use<00:04:12.329> any<00:04:12.450> kind<00:04:12.630> of<00:04:12.720> fluid<00:04:12.930> pop<00:04:13.110> really<00:04:13.700> if<00:04:14.700> I'm

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
use any kind of fluid pop really if I'm

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.670 
use any kind of fluid pop really if I'm
just<00:04:15.360> using<00:04:15.480> Bill<00:04:15.690> craft<00:04:15.930> because<00:04:16.079> it<00:04:16.290> will

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
just using Bill craft because it will

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.370 
just using Bill craft because it will
automatically<00:04:17.340> out<00:04:17.970> put<00:04:18.180> the<00:04:18.270> steam<00:04:18.299> which<00:04:19.260> is

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
automatically out put the steam which is

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.710 
automatically out put the steam which is
quite<00:04:19.590> fine<00:04:19.770> just<00:04:20.549> input<00:04:21.090> it<00:04:21.180> into<00:04:21.359> the

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
quite fine just input it into the

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:22.910 
quite fine just input it into the
turbine<00:04:22.260> and<00:04:22.440> as<00:04:22.650> you

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:22.920 
turbine and as you

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:27.050 
turbine and as you
start<00:04:23.310> spitting<00:04:23.550> up<00:04:24.200> and<00:04:25.640> it's<00:04:26.640> generating

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
start spitting up and it's generating

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.870 
start spitting up and it's generating
power<00:04:27.240> and<00:04:27.870> so<00:04:28.680> now<00:04:28.800> we<00:04:28.860> need<00:04:29.040> to<00:04:29.220> strike<00:04:29.760> the

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
power and so now we need to strike the

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.670 
power and so now we need to strike the
power<00:04:30.030> out<00:04:30.150> of<00:04:30.210> it<00:04:30.330> so<00:04:31.050> use<00:04:31.200> these<00:04:31.350> the<00:04:31.530> lead

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
power out of it so use these the lead

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.200 
power out of it so use these the lead
wasps<00:04:31.860> it's<00:04:32.160> pretty<00:04:32.400> simple<00:04:32.670> straight<00:04:33.030> lead

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
wasps it's pretty simple straight lead

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.920 
wasps it's pretty simple straight lead
it's<00:04:34.080> got<00:04:34.200> a<00:04:34.230> couple<00:04:34.410> of<00:04:34.560> those<00:04:34.680> and<00:04:35.580> just

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
it's got a couple of those and just

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:37.930 
it's got a couple of those and just
place<00:04:36.930> it<00:04:36.960> on

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
place it on

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.570 
place it on
I'll<00:04:38.940> set<00:04:39.180> it<00:04:39.210> on<00:04:39.420> there<00:04:39.510> look<00:04:39.870> at<00:04:39.930> that<00:04:40.020> later

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
I'll set it on there look at that later

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.740 
I'll set it on there look at that later
bring<00:04:41.580> it<00:04:41.700> all<00:04:41.790> the<00:04:41.880> way<00:04:41.940> over<00:04:42.150> here<00:04:42.270> and<00:04:42.630> as

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
bring it all the way over here and as

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.560 
bring it all the way over here and as
you<00:04:42.840> can<00:04:42.870> see<00:04:43.080> they<00:04:43.230> can<00:04:43.290> go<00:04:44.160> up<00:04:44.400> walls<00:04:44.790> and<00:04:45.270> so

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
you can see they can go up walls and so

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.150 
you can see they can go up walls and so
forth<00:04:45.810> just<00:04:46.940> do<00:04:47.940> that<00:04:48.060> for<00:04:48.240> the<00:04:48.270> time<00:04:48.450> being

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.160 
forth just do that for the time being

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.180 
forth just do that for the time being
okay<00:04:50.160> and<00:04:50.520> now<00:04:51.450> on<00:04:51.750> to<00:04:52.200> our<00:04:52.230> furnace<00:04:52.830> heater

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
okay and now on to our furnace heater

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.480 
okay and now on to our furnace heater
which<00:04:53.460> is<00:04:53.490> pretty<00:04:54.240> simple<00:04:54.620> it's<00:04:55.620> an<00:04:55.980> insulated

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
which is pretty simple it's an insulated

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:57.590 
which is pretty simple it's an insulated
coil<00:04:56.640> so<00:04:56.850> they're<00:04:56.970> pretty<00:04:57.090> easy<00:04:57.330> to<00:04:57.510> make

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 
coil so they're pretty easy to make

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.900 
coil so they're pretty easy to make
they're<00:04:57.840> actually<00:04:58.110> eight<00:04:58.320> pieces<00:04:58.530> of<00:04:58.680> what

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:58.910 
they're actually eight pieces of what

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:02.930 
they're actually eight pieces of what
surrounding<00:04:59.910> one<00:05:00.360> piece<00:05:00.780> of<00:05:00.990> clay<00:05:01.920> or<00:05:01.950> a<00:05:02.310> block

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 
surrounding one piece of clay or a block

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.380 
surrounding one piece of clay or a block
of<00:05:03.090> clay<00:05:03.270> I<00:05:03.360> should<00:05:03.570> say<00:05:04.610> let's<00:05:05.610> grab<00:05:05.790> that<00:05:05.820> and

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:06.390 
of clay I should say let's grab that and

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:08.150 
of clay I should say let's grab that and
before<00:05:06.900> we<00:05:07.140> go<00:05:07.320> do<00:05:07.590> anything<00:05:07.860> with<00:05:07.950> that<00:05:07.980> we're

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 
before we go do anything with that we're

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.440 
before we go do anything with that we're
gonna<00:05:08.280> make<00:05:08.430> a<00:05:08.460> charge<00:05:08.790> meter<00:05:09.000> so<00:05:09.330> it's

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:09.450 
gonna make a charge meter so it's

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:11.600 
gonna make a charge meter so it's
essentially<00:05:09.810> like<00:05:09.990> a<00:05:10.020> multimeter<00:05:10.560> tells<00:05:11.490> you

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
essentially like a multimeter tells you

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:13.310 
essentially like a multimeter tells you
how<00:05:11.670> its<00:05:11.790> charge<00:05:12.060> or<00:05:12.330> power<00:05:12.510> you've<00:05:12.690> got<00:05:12.720> and

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320 
how its charge or power you've got and

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:17.240 
how its charge or power you've got and
you<00:05:14.100> know<00:05:14.190> sine<00:05:14.550> stick<00:05:15.120> on<00:05:15.840> to<00:05:16.350> it<00:05:16.530> pretty

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:17.250 
you know sine stick on to it pretty

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.690 
you know sine stick on to it pretty
simple<00:05:17.580> as<00:05:17.670> well<00:05:18.230> check<00:05:19.230> that<00:05:19.410> in<00:05:19.470> the<00:05:19.530> bottom

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:19.700 
simple as well check that in the bottom

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:23.450 
simple as well check that in the bottom
furnace<00:05:20.700> heater<00:05:20.910> and<00:05:21.840> we're<00:05:22.740> gonna<00:05:22.890> do<00:05:23.100> is

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 
furnace heater and we're gonna do is

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.240 
furnace heater and we're gonna do is
check<00:05:23.970> the<00:05:24.180> furnace<00:05:24.540> heater<00:05:24.840> if<00:05:25.320> we<00:05:25.920> check<00:05:26.130> it

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.250 
check the furnace heater if we check it

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:27.920 
check the furnace heater if we check it
there<00:05:26.780> yep

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
there yep

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:29.390 
there yep
and<00:05:28.050> as<00:05:28.110> you<00:05:28.170> can<00:05:28.230> see<00:05:28.350> it<00:05:28.620> lights<00:05:28.860> up<00:05:29.070> so<00:05:29.280> it's

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400 
and as you can see it lights up so it's

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.580 
and as you can see it lights up so it's
such<00:05:29.520> a<00:05:29.550> getting<00:05:29.790> charge<00:05:30.200> we<00:05:31.200> can<00:05:31.380> right<00:05:31.560> click

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:31.590 
such a getting charge we can right click

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:34.690 
such a getting charge we can right click
with<00:05:31.890> the<00:05:31.950> charge<00:05:32.160> meter<00:05:32.370> this<00:05:32.640> chart<00:05:33.090> 261<00:05:33.720> and

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:34.700 
with the charge meter this chart 261 and

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.670 
with the charge meter this chart 261 and
you<00:05:35.700> can<00:05:35.850> see<00:05:36.030> over<00:05:36.330> here<00:05:36.450> is<00:05:36.630> a<00:05:36.660> charge<00:05:37.020> of<00:05:37.170> 64

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 
you can see over here is a charge of 64

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.410 
you can see over here is a charge of 64
as<00:05:37.980> well<00:05:38.160> so<00:05:38.430> that<00:05:38.580> basically<00:05:38.820> the<00:05:39.060> charge<00:05:39.300> was

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:39.420 
as well so that basically the charge was

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:40.400 
as well so that basically the charge was
kept<00:05:39.630> alone<00:05:39.810> in<00:05:39.900> the<00:05:39.960> system

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:40.410 
kept alone in the system

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:44.540 
kept alone in the system
the<00:05:41.040> wires<00:05:41.280> have<00:05:41.490> a<00:05:41.550> charge<00:05:41.790> as<00:05:41.940> well<00:05:42.380> and<00:05:43.550> as

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:44.550 
the wires have a charge as well and as

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:46.700 
the wires have a charge as well and as
you<00:05:44.670> can<00:05:44.730> see<00:05:44.930> this<00:05:45.930> thing<00:05:46.080> does<00:05:46.230> produce<00:05:46.440> a

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:46.710 
you can see this thing does produce a

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:48.920 
you can see this thing does produce a
little<00:05:46.860> bit<00:05:46.950> of<00:05:47.100> steam<00:05:47.540> more<00:05:48.540> mirrors<00:05:48.840> you

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:48.930 
little bit of steam more mirrors you

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:51.550 
little bit of steam more mirrors you
have<00:05:48.960> the<00:05:49.230> more<00:05:49.350> steam<00:05:49.560> producers<00:05:50.130> there<00:05:50.580> is<00:05:50.730> a

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:51.560 
have the more steam producers there is a

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:55.220 
have the more steam producers there is a
cal-o-metric<00:05:52.560> burner<00:05:53.340> you<00:05:53.580> can<00:05:53.730> use<00:05:54.110> and<00:05:55.110> if

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:55.230 
cal-o-metric burner you can use and if

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:57.020 
cal-o-metric burner you can use and if
we're<00:05:55.350> next<00:05:55.470> to<00:05:55.620> the<00:05:55.680> boiler<00:05:55.860> will<00:05:56.550> make<00:05:56.880> that

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:57.030 
we're next to the boiler will make that

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:59.030 
we're next to the boiler will make that
in<00:05:57.180> a<00:05:57.240> way<00:05:57.990> to<00:05:58.050> episode<00:05:58.410> we<00:05:58.740> can<00:05:58.920> actually

00:05:59.030 --> 00:05:59.040 
in a way to episode we can actually

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.420 
in a way to episode we can actually
convert<00:05:59.490> basically<00:06:00.180> food<00:06:00.420> into<00:06:00.690> energy<00:06:00.810> but

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:01.430 
convert basically food into energy but

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:03.500 
convert basically food into energy but
anyway<00:06:02.430> so<00:06:02.490> now<00:06:02.790> we've<00:06:02.940> got<00:06:03.060> this<00:06:03.150> furnace

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:03.510 
anyway so now we've got this furnace

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:06.710 
anyway so now we've got this furnace
heater<00:06:04.040> fantasy<00:06:05.040> is<00:06:05.130> pretty<00:06:05.340> simple<00:06:05.690> place<00:06:06.690> a

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:06.720 
heater fantasy is pretty simple place a

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:11.480 
heater fantasy is pretty simple place a
furnace<00:06:07.440> next<00:06:07.710> to<00:06:07.770> it<00:06:07.860> and<00:06:09.710> basically<00:06:10.710> put

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:11.490 
furnace next to it and basically put

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:13.670 
furnace next to it and basically put
what<00:06:11.610> he<00:06:11.670> wanted<00:06:11.940> in<00:06:12.030> the<00:06:12.090> cook<00:06:12.270> and<00:06:12.500> it<00:06:13.500> cooks

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:13.680 
what he wanted in the cook and it cooks

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.260 
what he wanted in the cook and it cooks
it<00:06:13.860> and<00:06:14.040> this<00:06:14.400> can<00:06:14.550> see<00:06:14.700> it<00:06:14.760> does<00:06:14.910> use<00:06:15.120> up

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:15.270 
it and this can see it does use up

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:18.410 
it and this can see it does use up
charge<00:06:16.610> which<00:06:17.610> we<00:06:17.730> haven't<00:06:17.850> got<00:06:18.000> much<00:06:18.150> of<00:06:18.180> at

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:18.420 
charge which we haven't got much of at

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:22.310 
charge which we haven't got much of at
the<00:06:18.510> moment<00:06:19.610> but<00:06:20.610> it<00:06:20.730> is<00:06:20.900> cooking<00:06:21.900> away<00:06:21.960> and

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:22.320 
the moment but it is cooking away and

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.970 
the moment but it is cooking away and
now<00:06:22.650> charcoal<00:06:23.190> so<00:06:24.060> it's<00:06:24.180> the<00:06:24.270> furnace<00:06:24.570> eater

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:24.980 
now charcoal so it's the furnace eater

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:28.430 
now charcoal so it's the furnace eater
the<00:06:25.980> fella<00:06:26.190> seen<00:06:26.400> it<00:06:26.550> is<00:06:26.700> also<00:06:26.880> used<00:06:27.320> later<00:06:28.320> on

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:28.440 
the fella seen it is also used later on

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.140 
the fella seen it is also used later on
which<00:06:28.950> will<00:06:29.160> show<00:06:29.400> wouldn't<00:06:29.850> make<00:06:30.000> the

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:30.150 
which will show wouldn't make the

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:33.290 
which will show wouldn't make the
crystallizer<00:06:30.960> and<00:06:31.400> the<00:06:32.400> slag<00:06:32.670> furnace<00:06:33.090> in<00:06:33.240> the

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:33.300 
crystallizer and the slag furnace in the

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:36.760 
crystallizer and the slag furnace in the
next<00:06:33.510> episodes<00:06:34.610> for<00:06:35.610> the<00:06:36.210> next<00:06:36.450> steps

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:36.770 
next episodes for the next steps

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:39.219 
next episodes for the next steps
we're<00:06:36.979> going<00:06:37.130> to<00:06:37.190> be<00:06:37.250> delving<00:06:38.240> into<00:06:38.509> the<00:06:38.990> or

00:06:39.219 --> 00:06:39.229 
we're going to be delving into the or

00:06:39.229 --> 00:06:41.800 
we're going to be delving into the or
processing<00:06:39.919> of<00:06:39.949> factorization<00:06:40.940> which

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:41.810 
processing of factorization which

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:45.249 
processing of factorization which
includes<00:06:42.259> some<00:06:42.590> pretty<00:06:43.550> simple<00:06:43.819> all<00:06:44.300> doubling

00:06:45.249 --> 00:06:45.259 
includes some pretty simple all doubling

00:06:45.259 --> 00:06:49.629 
includes some pretty simple all doubling
and<00:06:46.630> what's<00:06:47.630> us<00:06:48.139> not<00:06:48.800> not<00:06:49.099> exactly

00:06:49.629 --> 00:06:49.639 
and what's us not not exactly

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:53.430 
and what's us not not exactly
tripling<00:06:50.300> but<00:06:50.960> close<00:06:51.169> to<00:06:51.410> it<00:06:52.310> it's<00:06:52.729> basically

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:53.440 
tripling but close to it it's basically

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.809 
tripling but close to it it's basically
50%<00:06:54.440> chance<00:06:54.800> of<00:06:54.919> getting<00:06:54.979> extra<00:06:55.430> stuff<00:06:55.639> so

00:06:55.809 --> 00:06:55.819 
50% chance of getting extra stuff so

00:06:55.819 --> 00:06:58.180 
50% chance of getting extra stuff so
basically<00:06:56.030> I'd<00:06:56.720> say<00:06:56.930> two<00:06:57.590> and<00:06:57.770> a<00:06:57.800> half<00:06:57.949> times

00:06:58.180 --> 00:06:58.190 
basically I'd say two and a half times

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:00.189 
basically I'd say two and a half times
all<00:06:58.490> processing<00:06:59.150> we'll<00:06:59.660> do<00:06:59.840> that<00:06:59.960> next

00:07:00.189 --> 00:07:00.199 
all processing we'll do that next

00:07:00.199 --> 00:07:02.080 
all processing we'll do that next
episode<00:07:00.650> so<00:07:00.919> I'm<00:07:01.160> actually<00:07:01.460> sure<00:07:02.060> you
