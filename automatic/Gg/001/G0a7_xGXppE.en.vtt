 the dog by certain d of certain quality can have a very high cost 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.380

 dog can get to serve a bitch almost all day 

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:35.790
 every three days the truth 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.170
 is that quality 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.260
 the permer there has added to all Latin America for example Colombia and 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:43.979
 Ecuador that were present 

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:47.499
 in our ideals and tells us how is the panorama of what we thought 

00:00:47.499 --> 00:00:50.499
 in those countries 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.190
 Colombia 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.290
 German shepherd gets one of the breeds sopor lares 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:06.930
 in fact if he 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:07.950
 we have a club 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.000
 besides they have 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.370
 that it was specified that it is called Colombian association for pastors

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.710
 wheel per year 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.920
 also player like in the whole world in the most popular reason 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.520
 well that the race that more services odom joined 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.800
 many lives of German shepherds have been 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:42.600
 sitting for human welfare or catastrophes in rescue 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.140
 also in acts 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.010
 when there have been war types of rice both the basic monónica raquel ovejero 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.549
 German 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:49.370
 in Ecuador 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.370
 télam - 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.900
 also the producer 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.950
 faced in a lot of event both in Germany and in other countries and not 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.190
 I have no doubt that he is 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:05.650
 honestly no 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:10.130
 dena is the second most important worldwide after the mother country the 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.070
 German shepherd 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.990
 in that violent way we want to compete and plant leader more 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.769
 important that there is in South America and that's why the trip 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:19.670
 it's a six hour flight 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.140
 the palé worth it to send it to the largest exhibition of terrorism 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.200
 in South America always look that one comes to a position one comes to 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.890
 show what you have done during one or all and obese three years of parenting 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.200
 in fact expectation can always be in the batch 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.289
 of the cars that are on edge 

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:42.289
 it is obvious tied a way how to measure ourselves as a reference as it is 

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:46.890
 argentina we create in small countries like ecuador colombia and peru 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.610
 and if we do not do it to measure ourselves with the greats we do not really have a 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.150
 opportunity to measure our progress this is an art event by falling into the 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.929
 immense showcase that likes strong emotions 

00:02:57.929 --> 00:03:02.539
 iii and when you're there in the middle of the track that's why people scream and 

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:04.909
 excited and they were submerged winning the World Cup 

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:08.749
 after he has more in this type of attacks by the faces 

00:03:08.749 --> 00:03:12.549
 of anguish for the contribution that they are screaming they call juntitos 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:15.549
 this is a very important thing 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:25.249
 on the day of the race closest to the end is he the most 

00:03:25.249 --> 00:03:29.259
 complete without being the perfect in all areas of the best in peace of 

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:33.169
 ixtla while improving the protection part is good for the search 

00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:34.919
 it's good for the rescue 

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:38.969
 he did not accept in any of the things but he is the one that has the highest scores that 

00:03:38.969 --> 00:03:41.069
 in all areas both the averages 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:44.679
 of all areas of Trujillo because they prepare discursive defense 

00:03:44.679 --> 00:03:46.679
 alayes for a lot 

00:03:46.679 --> 00:03:51.399
