00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:36.379 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:38.560 

so<00:00:36.949> basically<00:00:37.250> all<00:00:37.370> you<00:00:37.489> need<00:00:37.579> is<00:00:37.879> eggs<00:00:38.239> and

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570 
so basically all you need is eggs and

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.180 
so basically all you need is eggs and
butter<00:00:40.359> some<00:00:41.359> people<00:00:41.629> like<00:00:41.750> to<00:00:41.780> add<00:00:41.949> milk<00:00:42.949> or

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
butter some people like to add milk or

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.549 
butter some people like to add milk or
water<00:00:43.339> to<00:00:43.609> their<00:00:43.760> eggs<00:00:44.019> personally<00:00:45.019> I<00:00:45.289> don't

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:45.559 
water to their eggs personally I don't

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:47.020 
water to their eggs personally I don't
really<00:00:45.710> notice<00:00:46.070> a<00:00:46.250> difference<00:00:46.610> when<00:00:46.820> I<00:00:46.940> do

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
really notice a difference when I do

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.250 
really notice a difference when I do
that<00:00:47.269> so<00:00:47.539> you<00:00:48.320> can<00:00:48.469> do<00:00:48.589> it<00:00:49.180> I<00:00:50.180> don't<00:00:51.109> know<00:00:51.230> I

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
that so you can do it I don't know I

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.530 
that so you can do it I don't know I
think<00:00:51.409> maybe<00:00:51.680> the<00:00:51.920> extra<00:00:52.339> liquid<00:00:52.640> just<00:00:52.820> helps

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:53.540 
think maybe the extra liquid just helps

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.100 
think maybe the extra liquid just helps
you<00:00:53.629> break<00:00:53.809> up<00:00:54.019> the<00:00:54.579> the<00:00:55.579> egg<00:00:55.729> more<00:00:56.059> better

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.110 
you break up the the egg more better

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:58.750 
you break up the the egg more better
I<00:00:57.140> don't<00:00:57.680> really<00:00:57.769> know<00:00:57.949> I've<00:00:58.489> heard

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
I don't really know I've heard

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.100 
I don't really know I've heard
explanations<00:00:59.269> but<00:00:59.570> I<00:00:59.750> don't<00:00:59.989> necessarily

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:00.110 
explanations but I don't necessarily

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.160 
explanations but I don't necessarily
believe<00:01:00.649> it<00:01:00.799> anyway<00:01:01.670> it<00:01:02.269> is<00:01:02.420> important<00:01:02.839> to<00:01:02.930> get

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
believe it anyway it is important to get

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.980 
believe it anyway it is important to get
some<00:01:03.769> air<00:01:04.039> mixed<00:01:04.820> into<00:01:05.089> your<00:01:05.180> eggs<00:01:05.360> so<00:01:05.690> when
