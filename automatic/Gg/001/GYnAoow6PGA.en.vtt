00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:10.769
 after years of development this 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.450
 it's the right time 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.519
 we are in london to discover the 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.590
 final version of the first bmw 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.590
 electric history i3 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.770
 aesthetically it's a compact of 4 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.030
 meters that has a small dia 2 profile 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.290
 it's a compliment for me there is 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.090
 some aesthetic details that are 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.220
 quite interesting like the 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.020
 side window treatment this hood 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.690
 black her rims in 19 inches with some 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.760
 255 wide tires and also its doors 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.160
 back antagonists that are a good 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.900
 compromise between a 3-door and 5-door 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.640
 7 allows easy access to places 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.130
 back without having a car too 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.680
 lengthened then one of the specificities of 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.510
 this bmw 3 g this cell entirely 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.479
 fiber reinforced plastic 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:11.150
 carbon is associated with the rest of the chassis 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:13.580
 mostly in aluminum it gives a weight 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.200
 of only 1200 kg batteries included 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.800
 it's a real performance for a 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.590
 electric car 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.340
 we find at the back under the floor 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.220
 of the chest 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.020
 the electric motor makes 1.5 ron who 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.800
 develops without 25 kilowatts 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.030
 that is to say 170 horses and 258 m and this 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.610
 from the start 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.660
 so yes 200 kg for 170 horses that 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.660
 gives quite a performance 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:38.210
 flattering ie 1 0 to 60 in three 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:41.090
 seconds 7 1 0 to 100 in this second 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:43.460
 from covers of 80 to 120 in 5 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.130
 seconds nine and well of max speed which 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.080
 is electronically limited to 150 km / h 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.060
 and that's mainly for 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.740
 preserve autonomy by speaking 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.539
 of autonomy the batteries when she gets 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.000
 find in the floor so that's 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:57.830
 yes euros for the distribution of 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.830
 masses 50 50 it's absolutely perfect 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.600
 but also for the height of the center of 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.869
 gravity so they are lithium-ion 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:08.330
 it develops a capacity of 22 kg 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:09.259
 waters that offers a range of 190 km 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.990
 on European standards 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:15.560
 so well wanted by rather 130 to 160 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:17.900
 km under normal conditions and up to 200 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.160
 km with the economic mode 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.959
 and if you want to go on a weekend 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.459
 with this bmw i3 you also have a 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:24.290
 option of a range extender 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.120
 it's a six-cent double-cylinder 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.770
 fifty cubic centimeters 34 show that 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.780
 just stand next to engine 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.790
 electric it has a small tank of 9 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.569
 liters that stands up front and who 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:37.629
 carry autonomy at 300 km 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:40.090
 this bmw i3 is very interesting for 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:41.319
 three points first from a point of view 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.359
 technique the choice of materials made 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:45.430
 part of us getting up gives a weight of 

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:47.079
 only 1200 kg is exceptional 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.010
 for an electric car anything 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:50.319
 from a point of view a little bit more 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.359
 philosophical bmw guarantee that there will be 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:54.069
 a real pleasure driving to his 

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:54.370
 flying that is part of the DNA of the 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:56.260
 Mark 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.939
 third point and not least the 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.329
 price the forecasts of the cici who spoke 

00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:04.599
 from 50000 euros to the end is to 34 1990 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:07.060
 euros and even 27 1990 euros once the 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:08.260
 ecological bonus of 7000 euros deducted 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.669
 so that makes it a proposition 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.870
 extremely interesting we remember 

00:03:09.669 --> 00:03:12.699
 that it was not so long ago that it was 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.680
 the price of citroÃ«n c zero 

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:16.209
 what is the result not bmw i3 we will have 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.919
 the press tests that will arrive in 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:21.629
 October followed by commercialization 

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:21.629
 which will take place in November
