remote<00:00:21.359> shells<00:00:21.660> with<00:00:22.199> netcat<00:00:22.710> in<00:00:22.949> Linux

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
remote shells with netcat in Linux

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.790 
remote shells with netcat in Linux
now<00:00:24.240> remote<00:00:24.539> shells<00:00:24.810> on<00:00:24.960> Linux<00:00:25.320> are<00:00:25.500> pretty

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
now remote shells on Linux are pretty

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.429 
now remote shells on Linux are pretty
similar<00:00:26.369> to<00:00:26.400> Windows<00:00:26.849> when<00:00:27.720> you<00:00:27.810> begin<00:00:28.140> you'll

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
similar to Windows when you begin you'll

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.859 
similar to Windows when you begin you'll
notice<00:00:28.740> no<00:00:29.010> user<00:00:29.340> prompt<00:00:29.820> appears<00:00:30.179> for<00:00:30.510> you<00:00:30.539> so

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
notice no user prompt appears for you so

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.179 
notice no user prompt appears for you so
that<00:00:31.019> is<00:00:31.140> a<00:00:31.170> little<00:00:31.470> bit<00:00:31.650> different<00:00:32.009> you<00:00:32.070> need

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
that is a little bit different you need

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.830 
that is a little bit different you need
to<00:00:32.309> pay<00:00:32.430> attention<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:32.880> that<00:00:33.059> you'll<00:00:33.630> also

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
to pay attention to that you'll also

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.350 
to pay attention to that you'll also
need<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.590> run<00:00:34.829> netcat<00:00:35.250> through<00:00:35.489> sudo<00:00:35.969> to<00:00:36.030> do

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
need to run netcat through sudo to do

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.990 
need to run netcat through sudo to do
remote<00:00:36.719> shells<00:00:37.079> ok<00:00:37.829> super<00:00:38.250> user<00:00:38.430> we<00:00:38.969> have

remote shells ok super user we have

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.389 
remote shells ok super user we have
discussed<00:00:39.690> that<00:00:39.780> on<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.170> previous<00:00:40.500> hack<00:00:40.950> tip<00:00:41.190> as

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
discussed that on a previous hack tip as

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.970 
discussed that on a previous hack tip as
well<00:00:41.430> now<00:00:42.270> this<00:00:42.540> time<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:43.050> listener<00:00:43.530> is<00:00:43.710> going

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
well now this time the listener is going

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.279 
well now this time the listener is going
to<00:00:44.070> be<00:00:44.160> my<00:00:44.370> Linux<00:00:44.820> machine<00:00:45.270> so<00:00:45.870> we'll<00:00:46.110> go<00:00:46.260> ahead

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
to be my Linux machine so we'll go ahead

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.500 
to be my Linux machine so we'll go ahead
and<00:00:46.440> start<00:00:46.800> there<00:00:47.160> on<00:00:47.430> my<00:00:47.640> Linux<00:00:47.910> machine<00:00:48.300> with

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
and start there on my Linux machine with

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.779 
and start there on my Linux machine with
this<00:00:48.840> following<00:00:49.260> command<00:00:49.829> so<00:00:50.309> it's<00:00:50.489> spelled

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
this following command so it's spelled

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:57.590 
this following command so it's spelled
out<00:00:50.940> as<00:00:51.210> such<00:00:51.719> go<00:00:52.680> sudo<00:00:54.079> NC<00:00:55.079> Tech<00:00:55.890> LP<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:57.449> then

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
out as such go sudo NC Tech LP and then

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.020 
out as such go sudo NC Tech LP and then
you<00:00:57.690> type<00:00:57.870> in<00:00:58.020> your<00:00:58.079> port<00:00:58.350> 3<00:00:58.680> 1<00:00:58.859> 3<00:00:58.890> 3<00:00:59.160> 7<00:00:59.820> and

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
you type in your port 3 1 3 3 7 and

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.270 
you type in your port 3 1 3 3 7 and
you'll<00:01:00.629> notice<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.050> LP<00:01:01.379> this<00:01:01.559> time<00:01:01.800> is<00:01:01.949> not

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
you'll notice the LP this time is not

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.899 
you'll notice the LP this time is not
capitalized<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:03.180> then<00:01:03.809> we<00:01:03.899> put<00:01:04.080> tack<00:01:04.350> e<00:01:04.909> slash

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
capitalized and then we put tack e slash

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.550 
capitalized and then we put tack e slash
bin<00:01:06.299> slash<00:01:07.070> bash<00:01:08.360> so<00:01:09.360> what<00:01:09.780> this<00:01:10.049> is<00:01:10.229> going<00:01:10.290> to

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
bin slash bash so what this is going to

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.460 
bin slash bash so what this is going to
do<00:01:10.890> is<00:01:11.250> start<00:01:11.820> netcat<00:01:12.390> under<00:01:12.840> super<00:01:13.290> user

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
do is start netcat under super user

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.980 
do is start netcat under super user
control<00:01:14.100> or<00:01:14.400> root<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:15.000> then<00:01:15.570> it's<00:01:15.689> going<00:01:15.869> to

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
control or root and then it's going to

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.859 
control or root and then it's going to
open<00:01:16.290> up<00:01:16.439> a<00:01:16.860> persistent<00:01:17.610> listening<00:01:18.119> port<00:01:18.360> on<00:01:18.540> 3

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
open up a persistent listening port on 3

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.980 
open up a persistent listening port on 3
1<00:01:19.110> 3<00:01:19.140> 3<00:01:19.439> 7<00:01:19.890> while<00:01:20.520> pulling<00:01:20.880> up<00:01:21.030> bin<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.570> bash

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
1 3 3 7 while pulling up bin and bash

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.260 
1 3 3 7 while pulling up bin and bash
which<00:01:22.619> is<00:01:22.770> basically<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.549> equivalent<00:01:24.150> of

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
which is basically the equivalent of

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.840 
which is basically the equivalent of
windows<00:01:24.720> of<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.320> windows<00:01:25.619> command<00:01:25.799> prompt<00:01:26.280> so

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
windows of the windows command prompt so

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.240 
windows of the windows command prompt so
now<00:01:27.060> on<00:01:27.270> your<00:01:27.479> windows<00:01:28.020> box<00:01:28.320> we're<00:01:28.770> also<00:01:28.920> going

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
now on your windows box we're also going

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.609 
now on your windows box we're also going
to<00:01:29.369> connect<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.119> host<00:01:30.390> pc<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.140> that

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
to connect to the host pc and that

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.340 
to connect to the host pc and that
opened<00:01:32.040> port<00:01:32.369> so<00:01:33.000> this<00:01:33.240> time<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.689> listener<00:01:34.110> my

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
opened port so this time the listener my

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.380 
opened port so this time the listener my
Linux<00:01:34.710> machine<00:01:35.100> will<00:01:35.369> give<00:01:35.579> bash<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:36.270> my

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
Linux machine will give bash to my

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.050 
Linux machine will give bash to my
Windows<00:01:36.750> PC<00:01:37.290> if<00:01:37.500> that<00:01:37.710> makes<00:01:37.890> sense<00:01:38.130> so<00:01:38.909> the

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
Windows PC if that makes sense so the

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.630 
Windows PC if that makes sense so the
command<00:01:39.390> for<00:01:39.689> this<00:01:39.930> over<00:01:40.470> on<00:01:40.590> my<00:01:40.740> Windows<00:01:41.189> PC

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
command for this over on my Windows PC

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.300 
command for this over on my Windows PC
is<00:01:41.759> going<00:01:42.030> to<00:01:42.090> be<00:01:42.210> as<00:01:42.390> following<00:01:42.930> I<00:01:43.140> type<00:01:43.560> in<00:01:43.740> NC

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
is going to be as following I type in NC

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.740 
is going to be as following I type in NC
and<00:01:44.610> then<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.810> IP<00:01:46.680> address<00:01:47.310> of<00:01:47.520> my<00:01:47.579> Linux<00:01:48.509> box

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
and then the IP address of my Linux box

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:54.590 
and then the IP address of my Linux box
which<00:01:49.049> is<00:01:49.200> going<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.470> be<00:01:49.770> 10<00:01:50.369> dot<00:01:50.670> 70<00:01:52.280> 3.31<00:01:53.600> dot

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
which is going to be 10 dot 70 3.31 dot

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.410 
which is going to be 10 dot 70 3.31 dot
1<00:01:55.049> 4<00:01:55.350> 5<00:01:55.649> and<00:01:56.009> you<00:01:56.549> can<00:01:56.579> look<00:01:56.820> that<00:01:56.939> up<00:01:57.000> by<00:01:57.210> using

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
1 4 5 and you can look that up by using

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.990 
1 4 5 and you can look that up by using

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:54.709 
the Linux box now in Windows I can also

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:57.250 
the Linux box now in Windows I can also
do<00:03:55.070> some<00:03:55.310> fun<00:03:55.489> stuff<00:03:55.760> so<00:03:56.360> I<00:03:56.390> can<00:03:56.660> use<00:03:56.840> this<00:03:57.019> to

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
do some fun stuff so I can use this to

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.530 
do some fun stuff so I can use this to
make<00:03:57.410> a<00:03:57.470> new<00:03:57.739> directory<00:03:58.370> if<00:03:58.640> I<00:03:58.760> wanted<00:03:59.030> to<00:03:59.209> and

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
make a new directory if I wanted to and

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.270 
make a new directory if I wanted to and
I'm<00:03:59.750> just<00:03:59.780> gonna<00:04:00.019> use<00:04:00.290> the<00:04:00.470> regular<00:04:00.650> Linux

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
I'm just gonna use the regular Linux

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.370 
I'm just gonna use the regular Linux
commands<00:04:01.640> for<00:04:01.910> this<00:04:02.060> so<00:04:02.720> that's<00:04:02.959> going<00:04:03.200> to

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.380 
commands for this so that's going to

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.759 
commands for this so that's going to
include<00:04:04.090> make<00:04:05.090> directory<00:04:05.630> which<00:04:05.870> is<00:04:05.900> mkdir

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:06.769 
include make directory which is mkdir

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:09.190 
include make directory which is mkdir
and<00:04:07.459> then<00:04:07.880> I'll<00:04:07.970> make<00:04:08.150> a<00:04:08.180> new<00:04:08.360> one<00:04:08.510> called<00:04:08.690> noob

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
and then I'll make a new one called noob

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.910 
and then I'll make a new one called noob
and<00:04:10.269> press<00:04:11.269> Enter

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 
and press Enter

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.160 
and press Enter
so<00:04:12.920> now<00:04:13.250> I<00:04:13.670> can<00:04:14.120> also<00:04:14.239> use<00:04:14.569> the<00:04:14.720> LS<00:04:14.989> command

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 
so now I can also use the LS command

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.680 
so now I can also use the LS command
again<00:04:15.830> to<00:04:16.070> see<00:04:16.340> if<00:04:16.430> the<00:04:16.580> directory<00:04:17.000> was<00:04:17.239> indeed

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
again to see if the directory was indeed

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:18.110 
again to see if the directory was indeed

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:22.889 
it so I'll type that in LS and now I see

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:27.020 
it so I'll type that in LS and now I see
