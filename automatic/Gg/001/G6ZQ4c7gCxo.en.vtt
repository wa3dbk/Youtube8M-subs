why is the economy here going counter

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.120 
why is the economy here going counter
cyclical<00:02:48.190> to<00:02:48.580> the<00:02:49.060> rest<00:02:49.239> of<00:02:49.360> the<00:02:49.420> country<00:02:49.870> I

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
cyclical to the rest of the country I

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.130 
cyclical to the rest of the country I
think<00:02:51.130> there's<00:02:51.310> the<00:02:51.640> dynamic<00:02:52.080> there's<00:02:53.080> a

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
think there's the dynamic there's a

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.229 
think there's the dynamic there's a
dynamic<00:02:53.349> growth<00:02:54.130> growth<00:02:54.489> fixed<00:02:54.760> yeah<00:02:55.030> exactly

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
dynamic growth growth fixed yeah exactly

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:57.600 
dynamic growth growth fixed yeah exactly
like<00:02:55.569> there's<00:02:55.840> just<00:02:56.049> a<00:02:56.140> certain<00:02:56.319> aspect<00:02:57.310> about

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
like there's just a certain aspect about

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.670 
like there's just a certain aspect about
it<00:02:57.790> I<00:02:57.819> think<00:02:58.390> has<00:02:58.569> a<00:02:58.630> lot<00:02:58.810> to<00:02:58.840> do<00:02:59.049> with<00:02:59.170> like<00:02:59.410> I

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
it I think has a lot to do with like I

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.530
