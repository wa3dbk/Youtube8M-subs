00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
here it's a pretty beastly pipe you know

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.819 
here it's a pretty beastly pipe you know
pretty<00:02:01.299> much<00:02:01.420> takes<00:02:02.020> over<00:02:02.350> the<00:02:02.469> front<00:02:02.680> of<00:02:02.740> the

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:02.829 
pretty much takes over the front of the

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:04.260 
pretty much takes over the front of the
snowmobile<00:02:03.369> just<00:02:03.640> in<00:02:03.759> case<00:02:03.969> something

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
snowmobile just in case something

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.749 
snowmobile just in case something
happens<00:02:04.750> actually<00:02:04.930> that's<00:02:05.320> why<00:02:05.500> spark<00:02:06.460> plugs

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:06.759 
happens actually that's why spark plugs

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:10.170 
happens actually that's why spark plugs
here<00:02:07.500> and<00:02:08.500> then<00:02:08.800> maybe<00:02:09.310> leave<00:02:09.670> I<00:02:09.820> can<00:02:10.000> take

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:10.180 
here and then maybe leave I can take

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:12.840 
here and then maybe leave I can take
over<00:02:10.330> on<00:02:10.539> the<00:02:10.660> left<00:02:10.899> side<00:02:11.110> you<00:02:12.100> want<00:02:12.280> what's

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
over on the left side you want what's

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:13.490 
over on the left side you want what's
over<00:02:13.120> here

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
over here

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.430 
over here
that's<00:02:14.500> a<00:02:14.650> belt<00:02:14.950> right<00:02:15.130> there<00:02:15.930> Bilby<00:02:16.930> that's

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
that's a belt right there Bilby that's

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.500 
that's a belt right there Bilby that's
nastier<00:02:18.300> really<00:02:19.500> yeah

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.110 
really good I don't know about other
small<00:02:25.739> deals<00:02:25.980> but<00:02:26.159> I<00:02:26.220> have<00:02:26.340> a<00:02:26.370> players<00:02:26.670> myself

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
small deals but I have a players myself

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.030 
small deals but I have a players myself
you<00:02:27.629> always<00:02:27.900> come<00:02:28.049> with<00:02:28.140> the<00:02:28.230> backup<00:02:28.680> most<00:02:28.860> of

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
you always come with the backup most of

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.250 
you always come with the backup most of
the<00:02:29.099> time<00:02:29.280> this<00:02:29.970> one<00:02:30.150> even<00:02:30.299> comes<00:02:30.599> with<00:02:30.780> a<00:02:30.870> few

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
the time this one even comes with a few

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.500 
the time this one even comes with a few
backup<00:02:31.709> spark<00:02:32.040> plugs<00:02:32.370> that's<00:02:32.909> pretty<00:02:33.269> awesome

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
backup spark plugs that's pretty awesome

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.930 
backup spark plugs that's pretty awesome
if<00:02:33.900> you<00:02:33.930> ask<00:02:34.049> me<00:02:34.470> four<00:02:35.190> of<00:02:35.310> them<00:02:35.430> kill<00:02:35.640> and

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
if you ask me four of them kill and

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.940 
if you ask me four of them kill and
there<00:02:36.180> only<00:02:36.299> needs<00:02:36.569> three<00:02:36.690> right<00:02:37.110> yep

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
there only needs three right yep

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.670 
there only needs three right yep
so<00:02:38.549> I<00:02:38.610> mean<00:02:38.790> well<00:02:39.299> most<00:02:39.750> most<00:02:40.110> newer<00:02:40.440> ones

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
so I mean well most most newer ones

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.250 
so I mean well most most newer ones
actually

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.380 

yeah<00:02:46.260> they<00:02:46.890> don't<00:02:47.069> you<00:02:47.879> know<00:02:47.910> most<00:02:48.209> new

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
yeah they don't you know most new

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:49.940 
yeah they don't you know most new
snowmobiles<00:02:48.989> they<00:02:49.140> run<00:02:49.290> on<00:02:49.319> two<00:02:49.560> spark<00:02:49.890> plugs

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
snowmobiles they run on two spark plugs

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.399 
snowmobiles they run on two spark plugs
that's<00:02:50.430> just<00:02:50.640> because<00:02:50.940> they're<00:02:51.120> a<00:02:51.150> little

00:02:51.399 --> 00:02:51.409 
that's just because they're a little

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:54.140 
that's just because they're a little
built<00:02:52.409> you<00:02:52.799> know<00:02:52.950> for<00:02:53.280> toughness<00:02:53.549> you<00:02:54.030> know

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
built you know for toughness you know

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.569 
built you know for toughness you know
pretty<00:02:54.720> pretty<00:02:55.049> beastly<00:02:55.650> motors<00:02:56.160> if<00:02:56.310> you<00:02:56.430> ask

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:56.579 
pretty pretty beastly motors if you ask

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:00.110 
pretty pretty beastly motors if you ask
me<00:02:56.819> why<00:02:57.629> don't<00:02:57.780> you<00:02:57.840> shut<00:02:58.110> it<00:02:58.140> and<00:02:59.120> everything

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
me why don't you shut it and everything

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.569 
me why don't you shut it and everything
go<00:03:00.269> over<00:03:00.420> a<00:03:00.450> couple<00:03:00.599> things<00:03:00.989> yeah<00:03:01.459> you<00:03:02.459> guys

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:02.579 
go over a couple things yeah you guys

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:03.920 
go over a couple things yeah you guys
are<00:03:02.760> probably<00:03:02.910> asking<00:03:03.209> what's<00:03:03.629> wrong<00:03:03.840> with

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
are probably asking what's wrong with

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.210 
are probably asking what's wrong with
the<00:03:04.079> snowmobile<00:03:04.470> we'll<00:03:04.620> go<00:03:04.769> over<00:03:04.829> that<00:03:04.950> in<00:03:05.069> a

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
the snowmobile we'll go over that in a

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.729 
the snowmobile we'll go over that in a
little<00:03:05.370> bit<00:03:05.640> you<00:03:06.329> know<00:03:06.390> no<00:03:06.900> windshield<00:03:07.230> but

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
little bit you know no windshield but

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:18.610 
little bit you know no windshield but
yeah<00:03:07.829> okay<00:03:08.819> what's<00:03:09.480> this<00:03:09.629> right<00:03:09.870> here

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.240 
600 bucks in there if you don't have
spark<00:03:36.660> plugs<00:03:36.930> actually<00:03:37.410> screw<00:03:37.919> it<00:03:38.040> then<00:03:38.069> you

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
spark plugs actually screw it then you

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.409 
spark plugs actually screw it then you
might<00:03:38.400> as<00:03:38.459> well<00:03:38.489> not<00:03:38.700> bring<00:03:38.940> one<00:03:39.120> but<00:03:39.269> if<00:03:39.329> you
