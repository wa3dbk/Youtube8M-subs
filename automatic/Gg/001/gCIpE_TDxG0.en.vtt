00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.200 

the<00:00:45.090> process<00:00:45.570> can<00:00:45.780> be<00:00:45.840> interrupted<00:00:46.290> and

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
the process can be interrupted and

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.620 
the process can be interrupted and
recovered<00:00:48.210> at<00:00:48.360> any<00:00:48.540> time<00:00:48.900> in<00:00:49.200> between<00:00:50.630> like

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:51.630 
recovered at any time in between like

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:57.800

now<00:00:52.760> so<00:00:53.760> if<00:00:54.720> the<00:00:55.140> user<00:00:55.820> wants<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:57.090> change

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:57.810 
now so if the user wants to change

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.470 
now so if the user wants to change
something<00:00:58.310> that's<00:00:59.310> very<00:00:59.580> easily<00:00:59.790> possible

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
something that's very easily possible

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.090 
something that's very easily possible

the result of the of the work can be

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.080 
the result of the of the work can be
adjusted<00:01:07.560> in<00:01:07.710> one<00:01:07.950> millimeter<00:01:08.400> steps<00:01:10.940> we<00:01:11.940> now

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
adjusted in one millimeter steps we now

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.600 
adjusted in one millimeter steps we now
have<00:01:12.270> restarted<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.020> process<00:01:13.500> runs<00:01:14.310> very

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
have restarted the process runs very

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:47.250 
have restarted the process runs very
