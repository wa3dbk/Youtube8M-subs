00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.709
 Wednesday and as you know every Wednesday I 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.930
 I'm uploading videos and most cortitos 

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:15.180
 possible clear and how you 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:17.430
 imagine we continue with the theme of 14 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:19.350
 February and want to win and those things or 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.210
 of not being nor of adding more in and super 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.039
 cool and females behind very fast 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.680
 do if I have myself as the invited to 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.289
 give your friends are very philosophical 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.210
 share care want worship mine 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.619
 all friends really do to me yes 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.469
 makes it super complicated and difficult 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.940
 find a friend like that in truth without 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.670
 be then I do not know if you have it 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.399
 be careful because they do not found it that way 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.199
 good already occupy two types of paper or 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.600
 made by writing and another with 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:47.399
 figurines we also need I want to 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.109
 colored cotton that this 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.120
 we get where they sell cloth 

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:53.190
 we need the molds to make a 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.319
 circle one smaller than the other me 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.870
 I put in this to occupy it for both 

00:00:55.319 --> 00:01:00.240
 a specialty also permanent the 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.730
 color that you like to write 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:07.530
 and finally uneasy glue 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:09.540
 have we are going to start marking already 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.260
 cut the big circles already 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.260
 cut them 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:19.360
 [Music] 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:24.700
 we have to do exactly the same 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:27.070
 with the smallest circles and now 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.270
 we put them glue and we stick to 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.729
 the biggest 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:35.640
 and you do not get paper with figures 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:37.979
 you can buy colored cards 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.710
 and since they are all seen we can 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:44.080
 write cheesy things in the center 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.900
 I think that if you want to grab 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.659
 they're going to create you cooler than now 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.880
 we will occupy ministers and cut us have 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:54.729
 the same size and secure the part of 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.560
 up and strip it with tape separated them into 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:58.659
 three parts 15 as if we were 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.430
 doing the press procedure 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:02.530
 know if there are some threads left 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.149
 in so that it does not stay like 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.890
 it also exists and then already arrive with 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:07.840
 normal braid spaces this is 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.970
 obviously optional in the bottom 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.850
 he knotted it so that it does not fall apart and 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:15.280
 because what was left with a drill 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:18.340
 I made two holes on the sides has 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:21.850
 that our bracelet is really ready 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:24.400
 very easy and it was super nice 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.739
 as more skinny and not so exaggerated if 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.780
 we do not occupy so many of them but we do the 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:30.820
 same procedure just that everything 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.310
 we do as more crushing has 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:37.350
 projected I do not know how to explain it and it puts 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.350
 names be bracelet in the same place 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:44.940

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.440
