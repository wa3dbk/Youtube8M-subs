00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:10.520
 at the core and motors stand 

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.349
 we found a surprise because the 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:15.349
 new video has a new design so it's 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:18.130
 that it really is for this 2015 the f 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:21.279
 0 makes a line change 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:23.470
 and certain characteristics that before then 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:25.750
 not that it was a disadvantage but if 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:29.140
 maybe they did not like it that much then 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:31.689
 obviously we improve that part and now 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:34.870
 is if before everything was now everything is more 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:36.579
 its just that and what are those changes 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.079
 because I was detailing some very 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:39.970
 important always especially in the 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:42.220
 interior I think the most important thing that 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:44.079
 we have in these moments and that people 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.850
 he resented at some point a lot was 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:48.040
 that the rear windows of f 0 do not 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.140
 came down and come down they are completely 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:54.189
 electric additionally their seats 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.659
 backs are already 100% folding and another 

00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:57.759
 feature that seems super 

00:00:55.659 --> 00:00:59.769
 chivas is that the screen is bigger 

00:00:57.759 --> 00:01:01.479
 of what was already is super chivas 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:04.119
 well then we have a vehicle 

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:05.740
 pretty functional and very low price 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:08.530
 if we save ourselves everywhere in the 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:11.619
 price in vehicle consumption 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.729
 in premiums are super low I think 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:14.890
 which is the ideal time to take advantage 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:17.440
 and buy the f 0 without a doubt 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:21.090
 We are handling premiums since 2000 750 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:23.380
 dollars with a low monthly payment 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.270
 relatively low of $ 200 already 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.550
 as a sure included truth then 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.990
 I think it's an excellent option I think 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.570
 that they should turn around to come to 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.130
 learn a new f 0 2015 to do 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.070
 the guys that are good apart 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.780
 we talk about the offer that has core and 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.240
 motorcycles because it also has sedan pickup 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:43.539
 it's good we manage a pretty range 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.460
 wide true everything what all kinds of 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:46.960
 vehicles that need from the f 0 that 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.140
 it's a hatchback vehicle 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.000
 efe 3 which is a sedan vehicle the s6 that 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.979
 a vehicle is fully loaded 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.710
 5 star family security 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:59.770
 we have therefore the work vehicles 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:02.649
 the alternating cargo bigs 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.440
 is the viu that is a minibus of 16 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:06.880
 passengers 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:10.649
 I think our range is pretty 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.649
 wide for all tastes actually
