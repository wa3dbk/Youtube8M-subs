 so guys our first game is called 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.059
 pac-man 256 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.350
 for the good old pakman but in another 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.390
 shell because here it is 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.059

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.550
 will fit 5 pixels below if we are in them 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.050
 prove that we are swallowed up and we 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.510
 lose tears and have to start 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.129
 again the rest is all the same pacman 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.840
 only now can we constantly 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.969
 move on top of us chasing all 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.699
 the same monsters that we have to run out 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.350
 at all the same as here these bonuses 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.629
 yellow dots that we must 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.329
 collect the whole is very interesting and 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.859
 capturing what you know it all shows 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.870
 without boundaries that is, we can move 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.240
 the most important thing is not to die 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.030
 from monsters from here these pixels which 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.900

 solid which are very many different 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.009
 missions and assignments for example here we are 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.259

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.299
 photo editor 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.040
 in this game we hang money 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.320
 items the faster you are with this 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.880
 the better it is interesting 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.619
 besides a lot of different tasks 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.329
 for example here on accelerometers we 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.640
 have to pour coffee of a certain color 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.890
 in a cup and not to miss because 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.049

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.909

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.840

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.290
 A fun time killer 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.840
 soundtracks in general this joke to throw 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.730
 cutlets in general houses cool to play 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.889
 game besides free general guys 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:37.049

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:37.049
 play it myself this game is called burger 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:42.080
 and last for today is playing aha ryzen 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:43.940
 Chase game that broke into the appstore and 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.770
 for some reason is in the tops in my opinion it is 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.870
 the most common race that stands in the same place 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:49.160
 something like about 5 dollars and in 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.050
 which is not correspondingly gaming 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.510
 shopping you are still the same cool plus and 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:55.670
 Accordingly, well, this race is something like 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.580
 those that we used to see more on 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:00.470
 old rates and with a huge garage then 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:02.870

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.880
 and solis on buying new cars 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.770
 improve our old cars chasing 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.200
 against our rivals on various 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:11.210
 tracks that you are here to the word thin 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.860

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.430
 really a lot of drive of course not 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:19.489
 real racing 3 but respectively here 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:21.470
 will play a very long time in his 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:23.450
 the house is dynamic which only delays 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:27.530
 it's interesting to even play 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:29.060
