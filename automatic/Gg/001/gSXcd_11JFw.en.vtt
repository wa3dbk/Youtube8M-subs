00:04:54.689 --> 00:04:54.699 
obliterate themselves so both of these

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:57.330 
obliterate themselves so both of these
locos<00:04:55.240> are<00:04:55.449> stuck<00:04:55.750> on<00:04:55.930> address<00:04:56.500> zero<00:04:56.919> zero

speed<00:05:00.550> and<00:05:00.819> direction<00:05:00.940> does<00:05:01.690> so<00:05:02.259> they<00:05:02.590> just

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
speed and direction does so they just

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.770 
speed and direction does so they just
sort<00:05:03.069> of<00:05:03.190> get<00:05:03.400> concepts<00:05:04.120> together<00:05:04.240> all<00:05:04.630> the

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
sort of get concepts together all the

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.969 
sort of get concepts together all the
time<00:05:06.780> because<00:05:07.780> they<00:05:08.289> think<00:05:08.349> they're<00:05:08.710> the<00:05:08.830> same

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:08.979

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
engine so that's how that goes
