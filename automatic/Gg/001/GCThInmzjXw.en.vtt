gameplay<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.110> gun<00:00:46.350> itself<00:00:46.680> which<00:00:47.280> adds

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
gameplay to the gun itself which adds

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.430 
gameplay to the gun itself which adds
some<00:00:47.579> interesting<00:00:48.149> context<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.930> external

some interesting context to external
challenges<00:00:50.180> the<00:00:51.180> second<00:00:51.600> key<00:00:51.809> idea<00:00:51.960> is

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
challenges the second key idea is

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.619 
challenges the second key idea is
permanent<00:00:53.039> death<00:00:53.219> there<00:00:53.789> are<00:00:53.850> no<00:00:53.969> checkpoints

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
permanent death there are no checkpoints

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.250 
permanent death there are no checkpoints
and<00:00:54.750> no<00:00:54.870> saves<00:00:55.199> so<00:00:55.800> if<00:00:55.860> you<00:00:55.949> die<00:00:56.160> that's<00:00:56.610> it<00:00:57.260> we

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
and no saves so if you die that's it we

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.569 
and no saves so if you die that's it we
thought<00:00:58.410> this<00:00:58.590> was<00:00:58.770> vital<00:00:59.100> for<00:00:59.280> creating

thought this was vital for creating
suspense<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.539> for<00:01:00.750> giving<00:01:00.989> credibility<00:01:01.289> to

all the dangers in the world this

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.210 
all the dangers in the world this
doesn't<00:01:04.409> mean<00:01:04.500> that<00:01:04.559> you<00:01:04.739> have<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:04.979> do<00:01:05.100> the

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
doesn't mean that you have to do the

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.890 
doesn't mean that you have to do the
same<00:01:05.400> thing<00:01:05.670> over<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.060> over<00:01:06.180> if<00:01:06.540> you<00:01:06.750> get

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
same thing over and over if you get

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:07.310 
same thing over and over if you get
killed

are<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.330> two<00:01:18.479> major<00:01:18.689> ideas<00:01:19.170> we<00:01:19.320> wanted<00:01:19.560> to

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
are the two major ideas we wanted to

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.380 
are the two major ideas we wanted to
explore<00:01:19.950> in<00:01:20.130> this<00:01:20.220> game<00:01:20.460> but<00:01:20.880> we<00:01:21.000> also<00:01:21.150> touched

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
explore in this game but we also touched

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.560 
explore in this game but we also touched
on<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.659> few<00:01:21.780> smaller<00:01:22.170> ones<00:01:22.759> for<00:01:23.759> example<00:01:24.150> to

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
on a few smaller ones for example to

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.850 
on a few smaller ones for example to
make<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.869> new<00:01:24.990> gun<00:01:25.200> controls<00:01:25.590> more

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
make the new gun controls more

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.280 
make the new gun controls more
