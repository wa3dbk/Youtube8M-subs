you a quick update on my latest project

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.730 
you a quick update on my latest project
as<00:00:08.189> you<00:00:08.880> can<00:00:09.000> see<00:00:09.179> here<00:00:09.450> I've<00:00:09.750> completely

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
as you can see here I've completely

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.730 
as you can see here I've completely
rebuilt<00:00:11.670> the<00:00:11.849> main<00:00:12.120> instrument<00:00:12.660> panel<00:00:12.929> this

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
rebuilt the main instrument panel this

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.220 
rebuilt the main instrument panel this
is<00:00:13.799> the<00:00:13.950> third<00:00:14.429> time<00:00:14.460> I'm<00:00:14.969> rebuilding<00:00:15.839> this

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
is the third time I'm rebuilding this

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.490 
is the third time I'm rebuilding this
simulator<00:00:16.740> and<00:00:17.010> I<00:00:17.580> hope<00:00:18.000> it's<00:00:18.539> last<00:00:19.080> time<00:00:19.260> also

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
simulator and I hope it's last time also

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.290 
simulator and I hope it's last time also
because<00:00:20.490> I've<00:00:20.789> been<00:00:21.060> more<00:00:21.630> around<00:00:22.410> this

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:23.300 
because I've been more around this

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.640 
because I've been more around this
cockpit<00:00:24.300> than<00:00:24.750> in<00:00:25.289> it

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
cockpit than in it

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.189 
cockpit than in it
and<00:00:27.859> go<00:00:28.859> inside<00:00:29.359> so<00:00:30.359> as<00:00:30.480> you<00:00:30.570> can<00:00:30.660> see<00:00:30.869> here<00:00:31.170> I

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
and go inside so as you can see here I

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.720 
and go inside so as you can see here I
made<00:00:31.500> in<00:00:31.650> even<00:00:32.219> an<00:00:32.369> APU<00:00:33.469> fire<00:00:34.469> panel<00:00:34.950> this<00:00:35.579> is

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
made in even an APU fire panel this is

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.180 
made in even an APU fire panel this is
the<00:00:35.880> neutral<00:00:36.210> quadrant<00:00:36.809> I'm<00:00:37.020> gonna<00:00:37.230> make<00:00:37.410> a

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
the neutral quadrant I'm gonna make a

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:44.270 
the neutral quadrant I'm gonna make a
vid<00:00:38.879> about<00:00:39.329> it<00:00:39.750> later<00:00:40.469> on<00:00:40.800> this<00:00:41.730> week<00:00:43.280> there

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
vid about it later on this week there

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.619 
vid about it later on this week there
are<00:00:44.340> many<00:00:44.640> changes<00:00:45.020> and<00:00:46.969> I've<00:00:47.969> got<00:00:48.210> my<00:00:48.329> hands

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
are many changes and I've got my hands

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.939 
are many changes and I've got my hands
on<00:00:48.719> a<00:00:49.550> very<00:00:50.550> cheap<00:00:50.789> smart<00:00:51.570> pad<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:51.989> running

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
on a very cheap smart pad and running

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.319 
on a very cheap smart pad and running
the<00:00:53.539> butyl<00:00:54.539> CDU<00:00:55.500> it's<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:56.610> pretty<00:00:57.180> cheap

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
the butyl CDU it's a pretty cheap

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.819 
the butyl CDU it's a pretty cheap
solution<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.960> have<00:00:58.230> for<00:00:58.980> an<00:00:59.359> MC<00:01:00.359> and<00:01:00.680> this<00:01:01.680> is

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
solution to have for an MC and this is

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.529 
solution to have for an MC and this is
right<00:01:02.399> now<00:01:02.550> this<00:01:02.730> is<00:01:02.910> probably<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.510> only

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
right now this is probably the only

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:09.500 
right now this is probably the only
thing<00:01:03.840> working<00:01:04.260> in<00:01:04.650> here<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:06.320> I'm<00:01:07.320> gonna<00:01:08.510> exit

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
thing working in here and I'm gonna exit

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.870 
thing working in here and I'm gonna exit
right<00:01:09.840> now<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.799> okay<00:01:11.510> and<00:01:13.189> my<00:01:14.189> old<00:01:14.400> site<00:01:14.670> egg

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
right now and okay and my old site egg

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.200 
right now and okay and my old site egg
yolk<00:01:15.150> would<00:01:16.049> not<00:01:16.290> fit<00:01:16.530> any<00:01:16.710> more<00:01:16.799> in<00:01:17.100> here<00:01:17.400> so

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
yolk would not fit any more in here so

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.249 
yolk would not fit any more in here so
right<00:01:18.750> now<00:01:18.930> I<00:01:18.960> mean<00:01:20.270> I'll<00:01:21.270> try<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:21.630> to<00:01:22.080> build

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
right now I mean I'll try to to build

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.870 
right now I mean I'll try to to build
the<00:01:22.850> 737<00:01:23.850> yolk<00:01:24.150> right<00:01:25.049> now<00:01:25.369> and<00:01:26.369> it<00:01:26.610> looks<00:01:26.759> like

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
the 737 yolk right now and it looks like

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.200 
the 737 yolk right now and it looks like
nothing<00:01:27.590> it's<00:01:28.590> it's<00:01:29.280> been<00:01:29.430> like<00:01:29.579> this<00:01:29.729> for<00:01:29.790> the

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
nothing it's it's been like this for the

last few weeks so this is the main

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:40.219 
last few weeks so this is the main
instrument<00:01:34.320> panel<00:01:34.619> I<00:01:37.100> still<00:01:38.100> have<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.700> buy<00:01:39.229> an

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
instrument panel I still have to buy an

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.590 
instrument panel I still have to buy an
LCD<00:01:40.530> screen<00:01:40.680> this<00:01:41.100> is<00:01:41.159> only<00:01:41.400> a<00:01:41.549> plastic<00:01:42.170> cover

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
in my left simulator the overhead panel

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:01.310 
in my left simulator the overhead panel
it's<00:01:55.650> it's<00:01:56.220> the<00:01:56.400> same<00:01:58.880> right<00:01:59.880> now<00:02:00.090> and<00:02:00.750> I<00:02:00.900> even

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
this is both main panel these modules

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.640 
this is both main panel these modules
have<00:02:45.510> this<00:02:45.900> small<00:02:46.580> error<00:02:47.750> but<00:02:48.750> anyway<00:02:49.230> if<00:02:49.410> you
