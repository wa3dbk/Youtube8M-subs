it yeah so this is the garmin dash cam
and<00:02:27.450> it<00:02:27.630> continuously<00:02:28.620> records<00:02:29.280> a<00:02:29.370> wide-angle

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
and it continuously records a wide-angle

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.420 
and it continuously records a wide-angle
view<00:02:29.970> of<00:02:30.330> the<00:02:30.450> road<00:02:30.830> so<00:02:31.830> it<00:02:31.980> gives<00:02:32.069> you<00:02:32.250> peace

view of the road so it gives you peace

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.220 
view of the road so it gives you peace
of<00:02:32.459> mind<00:02:32.580> that<00:02:33.030> if<00:02:33.209> anything<00:02:33.540> happens<00:02:34.019> on<00:02:34.110> the

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
of mind that if anything happens on the

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.559 
of mind that if anything happens on the
road<00:02:34.410> it<00:02:34.590> will<00:02:34.680> be<00:02:34.830> captured<00:02:35.300> it's<00:02:36.300> fully

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
road it will be captured it's fully

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:38.570 
road it will be captured it's fully
automated<00:02:37.050> so<00:02:37.290> once<00:02:37.470> you<00:02:37.590> start<00:02:37.860> the<00:02:37.980> car<00:02:38.220> it

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
automated so once you start the car it

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.100 
automated so once you start the car it
will<00:02:38.730> automatically<00:02:39.209> start<00:02:39.510> recording<00:02:39.569> when

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
will automatically start recording when

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.110 
will automatically start recording when
you<00:02:40.170> stop<00:02:40.410> the<00:02:40.560> car<00:02:40.739> it<00:02:40.920> stops<00:02:41.280> recording<00:02:41.730> it

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
you stop the car it stops recording it

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.720 
you stop the car it stops recording it
also<00:02:42.450> has<00:02:42.569> a<00:02:42.599> built-in<00:02:42.739> geforce<00:02:43.739> sensor<00:02:44.160> so<00:02:44.700> it

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
also has a built-in geforce sensor so it

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.670 
also has a built-in geforce sensor so it
will<00:02:44.880> automatically<00:02:45.390> detect<00:02:45.660> any<00:02:46.110> incidents

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
will automatically detect any incidents

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.229 
will automatically detect any incidents
so<00:02:46.739> if<00:02:46.860> you<00:02:46.920> get<00:02:47.040> into<00:02:47.220> an<00:02:47.400> accident<00:02:47.519> or<00:02:48.030> if<00:02:48.150> you

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
so if you get into an accident or if you

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.059 
so if you get into an accident or if you
hit<00:02:48.420> the<00:02:48.540> brakes<00:02:48.810> very<00:02:49.049> hard<00:02:49.319> it<00:02:49.680> will<00:02:49.860> detect

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
hit the brakes very hard it will detect

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:52.330 
hit the brakes very hard it will detect
that<00:02:50.430> and<00:02:50.489> automatically<00:02:51.180> save<00:02:51.510> the<00:02:51.690> files

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
that and automatically save the files

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.380 
that and automatically save the files
otherwise<00:02:53.340> it<00:02:53.580> will<00:02:53.670> just<00:02:53.730> overwrite<00:02:54.269> the

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
otherwise it will just overwrite the

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:55.699 
otherwise it will just overwrite the
file<00:02:54.600> so<00:02:54.810> you<00:02:54.840> don't<00:02:55.110> have<00:02:55.230> to<00:02:55.350> worry<00:02:55.560> about

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
file so you don't have to worry about

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:57.890 
file so you don't have to worry about
deleting<00:02:56.160> it<00:02:56.459> or<00:02:56.790> you<00:02:57.209> know<00:02:57.299> a<00:02:57.330> full<00:02:57.660> memory

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
deleting it or you know a full memory

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.170 
deleting it or you know a full memory
card<00:02:58.319> so<00:02:58.620> that's<00:02:59.190> very<00:02:59.400> convenient<00:02:59.790> so

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
card so that's very convenient so

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.759 
card so that's very convenient so
basically<00:03:00.900> don't<00:03:01.080> have<00:03:01.170> to<00:03:01.260> worry<00:03:01.440> it<00:03:01.620> you

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
basically don't have to worry it you

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:03.080 
basically don't have to worry it you
just<00:03:01.950> attach<00:03:02.220> it<00:03:02.400> to<00:03:02.430> the<00:03:02.580> windshield<00:03:02.940> and

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
just attach it to the windshield and

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.380 
just attach it to the windshield and
leave<00:03:03.269> it<00:03:03.420> and<00:03:03.739> you<00:03:04.739> always<00:03:04.950> know<00:03:05.220> that<00:03:05.519> if<00:03:05.760> you

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
leave it and you always know that if you

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:07.339

people<00:03:18.480> don't<00:03:18.600> well<00:03:19.410> so<00:03:19.530> this<00:03:19.650> is<00:03:19.739> an<00:03:19.829> exciting

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
people don't well so this is an exciting

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.680 
people don't well so this is an exciting
space<00:03:20.370> right<00:03:20.640> there's<00:03:20.820> lots<00:03:21.060> of<00:03:21.269> these<00:03:21.420> new

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
space right there's lots of these new

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.240 
space right there's lots of these new
devices<00:03:21.959> most<00:03:22.530> of<00:03:22.680> them<00:03:22.799> are<00:03:22.920> designed<00:03:23.190> to

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
devices most of them are designed to

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.640 
devices most of them are designed to
track<00:03:23.519> steps<00:03:23.910> they<00:03:24.120> measure<00:03:24.269> motion<00:03:24.780> so<00:03:25.440> we<00:03:25.530> do

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
track steps they measure motion so we do

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.590 
track steps they measure motion so we do
that<00:03:25.799> too<00:03:26.010> but<00:03:26.280> inside<00:03:26.730> the<00:03:26.880> basis<00:03:27.209> band<00:03:27.390> there

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
that too but inside the basis band there

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:28.880 
that too but inside the basis band there
are<00:03:27.690> five<00:03:27.959> sensors<00:03:28.350> running<00:03:28.650> all<00:03:28.769> the<00:03:28.859> time

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
are five sensors running all the time

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:30.920 
are five sensors running all the time
and<00:03:29.280> they're<00:03:29.459> really<00:03:29.609> trying<00:03:29.850> to<00:03:30.030> get<00:03:30.630> at<00:03:30.780> your

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
and they're really trying to get at your

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.599 
and they're really trying to get at your
real<00:03:31.109> physiology<00:03:31.769> so<00:03:31.950> we<00:03:32.040> measure<00:03:32.190> heart<00:03:32.519> rate

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:32.609 
real physiology so we measure heart rate

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:34.610 
real physiology so we measure heart rate
and<00:03:32.940> perspiration<00:03:33.569> and<00:03:34.049> skin<00:03:34.350> temperature

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
and perspiration and skin temperature

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.849 
and perspiration and skin temperature
we're<00:03:35.609> now<00:03:35.730> doing<00:03:35.790> the<00:03:36.319> tracking<00:03:37.319> of<00:03:37.500> your

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859 
we're now doing the tracking of your

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:40.610 
we're now doing the tracking of your
sleep<00:03:38.190> stages<00:03:38.730> so<00:03:39.209> light<00:03:39.480> sleep<00:03:39.780> deep<00:03:40.590> sleep

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
sleep stages so light sleep deep sleep

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.440 
sleep stages so light sleep deep sleep
where<00:03:41.100> your<00:03:41.220> body<00:03:41.370> is<00:03:41.519> physically<00:03:42.030> recovering

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
where your body is physically recovering

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.210 
where your body is physically recovering
from<00:03:42.540> the<00:03:42.690> day's<00:03:42.810> activities<00:03:42.840> and<00:03:43.319> even<00:03:43.980> REM

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
from the day's activities and even REM

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.890 
from the day's activities and even REM
sleep<00:03:44.400> where<00:03:44.730> your<00:03:44.850> mind<00:03:45.000> is<00:03:45.209> recovering<00:03:45.660> and

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
sleep where your mind is recovering and

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.809 
sleep where your mind is recovering and
which<00:03:46.260> is<00:03:46.410> productive<00:03:47.069> for<00:03:47.280> learning<00:03:47.730> and

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:47.819 
which is productive for learning and

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:49.849 
which is productive for learning and
memory<00:03:48.000> performance<00:03:48.410> so<00:03:49.410> because<00:03:49.680> we're

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:49.859 
memory performance so because we're

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:51.289 
memory performance so because we're
getting<00:03:50.040> a<00:03:50.100> physiology<00:03:50.700> we<00:03:50.819> can<00:03:50.970> use<00:03:51.090> that<00:03:51.239> to

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
getting a physiology we can use that to

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:52.879 
getting a physiology we can use that to
actually<00:03:51.569> really<00:03:52.170> understand<00:03:52.590> your<00:03:52.680> sleep

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:52.889 
actually really understand your sleep

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:53.990 
actually really understand your sleep
stages<00:03:53.250> which<00:03:53.370> has<00:03:53.489> never<00:03:53.639> been<00:03:53.760> done<00:03:53.880> before

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
stages which has never been done before

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.879 
stages which has never been done before
so<00:03:54.900> you<00:03:55.019> really<00:03:55.109> have<00:03:55.230> no<00:03:55.470> reason<00:03:55.739> to<00:03:55.799> ever

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:55.889 
so you really have no reason to ever

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:58.009 
so you really have no reason to ever
take<00:03:56.100> this<00:03:56.250> off<00:03:56.430> that's<00:03:56.880> right<00:03:57.090> we're<00:03:57.269> 24-7

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
take this off that's right we're 24-7

00:03:58.019 --> 00:03:59.750 
take this off that's right we're 24-7
all<00:03:58.709> right<00:03:58.859> well<00:03:58.980> those<00:03:59.130> are<00:03:59.250> just<00:03:59.370> a<00:03:59.519> few<00:03:59.549> of
