no<00:03:16.610> reason<00:03:16.970> so<00:03:17.390> clearly<00:03:17.720> i<00:03:18.110> lost<00:03:18.620> all<00:03:18.769> hope

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
no reason so clearly i lost all hope

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.710 
no reason so clearly i lost all hope
when<00:03:19.370> I<00:03:19.400> learned<00:03:19.640> that<00:03:19.820> story<00:03:20.180> I<00:03:20.269> lost<00:03:20.570> all

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
when I learned that story I lost all

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.420 
when I learned that story I lost all
hope<00:03:20.900> for<00:03:21.050> everything<00:03:21.500> and<00:03:21.709> I<00:03:22.130> believe<00:03:22.400> that

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
hope for everything and I believe that

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.190 
hope for everything and I believe that
the<00:03:22.700> only<00:03:22.850> way<00:03:23.120> to<00:03:23.180> really<00:03:23.450> fix<00:03:23.720> everything<00:03:23.930> to

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
the only way to really fix everything to

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.690 
the only way to really fix everything to
depend<00:03:24.440> on<00:03:24.530> the<00:03:24.620> God<00:03:24.769> tree<00:03:25.010> again<00:03:25.220> we<00:03:25.489> need<00:03:25.640> to

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
depend on the God tree again we need to

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.250 
depend on the God tree again we need to
take<00:03:25.790> it<00:03:25.940> all<00:03:26.060> the<00:03:26.090> way<00:03:26.180> back<00:03:26.360> to<00:03:26.510> her<00:03:26.660> the

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
take it all the way back to her the

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.479 
take it all the way back to her the
Gayatri<00:03:27.680> because<00:03:28.070> that's<00:03:28.220> where<00:03:28.370> all

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
Gayatri because that's where all

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:32.050 
Gayatri because that's where all
originated<00:03:29.060> from<00:03:29.090> and<00:03:29.709> when<00:03:30.709> the<00:03:31.459> bud<00:03:31.640> sprouts

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
originated from and when the bud sprouts

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.229 
originated from and when the bud sprouts
it<00:03:32.510> will<00:03:32.870> reflect<00:03:33.130> whatever<00:03:34.130> onto<00:03:34.970> the<00:03:35.060> moon

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
it will reflect whatever onto the moon

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:36.940 
it will reflect whatever onto the moon
whatever<00:03:35.570> I<00:03:35.630> you<00:03:35.780> put<00:03:36.110> in<00:03:36.200> it<00:03:36.350> and<00:03:36.530> that's

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950
