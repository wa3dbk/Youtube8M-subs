a C now I'm gonna play this a little

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.080 
a C now I'm gonna play this a little
slower<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.620> every<00:00:50.430> single<00:00:50.579> time<00:00:50.789> there's<00:00:51.030> a

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
slower and every single time there's a

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.729 
slower and every single time there's a
syncopation<00:00:51.570> my<00:00:51.840> left<00:00:52.050> hand<00:00:52.260> kind<00:00:52.500> of<00:00:52.559> plays<00:00:52.710> a

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
syncopation my left hand kind of plays a

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.229 
syncopation my left hand kind of plays a
beat<00:00:53.010> so<00:00:53.280> just<00:00:53.489> pay<00:00:53.640> attention<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:54.030> how<00:00:54.120> the

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
beat so just pay attention to how the

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:09.850 
beat so just pay attention to how the
left<00:00:54.539> hand<00:00:54.750> goes<00:00:54.930> along<00:00:55.170> with<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.410> right<00:00:55.559> here

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860
