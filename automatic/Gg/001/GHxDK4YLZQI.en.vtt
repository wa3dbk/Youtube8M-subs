00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
minutes on this okay once you make it

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:29.950 

a<00:02:11.579> second

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:29.960 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.620 

okay<00:02:30.680> then<00:02:30.860> you<00:02:30.950> move<00:02:31.070> down<00:02:31.250> to<00:02:31.400> playing<00:02:32.390> the<00:02:32.480> F

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
okay then you move down to playing the F

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.280 
okay then you move down to playing the F
natural<00:02:32.870> still<00:02:33.590> following<00:02:33.830> that<00:02:33.890> long<00:02:34.190> C

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
natural still following that long C

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:41.260 
natural still following that long C
 with<00:02:36.440> the<00:02:36.560> other<00:02:36.680> fingers

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.900 

get<00:02:42.200> the<00:02:42.320> idea<00:02:42.710> right<00:02:43.070> go<00:02:43.310> all<00:02:43.490> the<00:02:43.580> way<00:02:43.610> to<00:02:43.730> the

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
get the idea right go all the way to the

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.610 
get the idea right go all the way to the
first<00:02:44.060> finger<00:02:44.360> and<00:02:44.660> do<00:02:44.750> the<00:02:44.870> same<00:02:45.080> thing

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.190 

okay<00:02:49.550> that's<00:02:49.730> the<00:02:49.910> basic<00:02:50.300> warm-up<00:02:50.690> now<00:02:51.019> there

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
okay that's the basic warm-up now there

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.360 
okay that's the basic warm-up now there
a<00:02:51.230> couple<00:02:51.379> of<00:02:51.530> ways<00:02:51.650> to<00:02:51.709> make<00:02:51.920> this<00:02:52.160> more

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
a couple of ways to make this more

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.550 
a couple of ways to make this more
difficult<00:02:52.840> you<00:02:53.840> can<00:02:53.959> go<00:02:54.080> a<00:02:54.110> little<00:02:54.200> faster

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
difficult you can go a little faster

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.170 
difficult you can go a little faster
with<00:02:54.980> your<00:02:55.099> tempo<00:02:55.489> but<00:02:55.730> I<00:02:55.760> don't<00:02:55.970> recommend

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
with your tempo but I don't recommend

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.610 
with your tempo but I don't recommend
that<00:02:56.390> in<00:02:56.569> the<00:02:56.629> beginning<00:02:56.900> the<00:02:57.260> other<00:02:57.410> way<00:02:57.560> is

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
that in the beginning the other way is

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.040 
that in the beginning the other way is
to<00:02:57.709> add<00:02:57.920> some<00:02:58.250> rhythms<00:02:58.610> to<00:02:59.209> your<00:02:59.390> bones<00:02:59.750> so

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
to add some rhythms to your bones so

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:01.360 
to add some rhythms to your bones so
you're<00:03:00.200> really<00:03:00.590> stressing<00:03:00.950> your

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
you're really stressing your

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.240 
you're really stressing your
coordination<00:03:01.849> between<00:03:02.120> the<00:03:02.300> two<00:03:02.390> hands<00:03:02.900> so

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
coordination between the two hands so

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:10.570 
coordination between the two hands so
you<00:03:04.250> get<00:03:04.400> your<00:03:04.900> eighth<00:03:05.900> notes<00:03:06.230> going

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.370 

see<00:03:10.760> how<00:03:10.850> I'm<00:03:10.910> doing<00:03:11.150> rhythms<00:03:11.600> with<00:03:11.960> my<00:03:12.140> right

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
see how I'm doing rhythms with my right

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:30.630 
see how I'm doing rhythms with my right
hand

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.850 

your<00:03:31.510> rhythms<00:03:31.870> with<00:03:32.020> the<00:03:32.110> Boeing<00:03:32.500> and<00:03:32.680> it

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
your rhythms with the Boeing and it

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:33.990 
your rhythms with the Boeing and it
creates<00:03:33.160> this<00:03:33.280> difficulty<00:03:33.880> with

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
creates this difficulty with

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.340 
creates this difficulty with
coordination<00:03:34.569> which<00:03:34.690> is<00:03:34.810> a<00:03:34.840> great<00:03:35.140> way<00:03:35.319> to

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
coordination which is a great way to

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.290 
coordination which is a great way to
warm<00:03:35.620> up<00:03:35.830> because<00:03:36.310> it<00:03:36.459> actually<00:03:36.940> warms<00:03:37.209> up

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:37.300 
warm up because it actually warms up

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.660 
warm up because it actually warms up
your<00:03:37.480> brain<00:03:37.750> instead<00:03:38.620> of<00:03:38.709> just<00:03:39.100> your<00:03:39.250> fingers

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
your brain instead of just your fingers

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.500 
your brain instead of just your fingers
