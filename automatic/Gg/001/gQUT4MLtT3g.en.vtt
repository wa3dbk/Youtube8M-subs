 tet 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:20.290
 it's not against the skin of four 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:23.139
 players who will have to face

 What's new like new 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.300
 graphic aspects that will affect what 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.360
 which is the tarot of the game even in the 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.800
 modeling characters besides this 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.750
 also enters the presentation of 10 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.580
 dragons in which we have been shown a 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.470
 gameplay that you have not yet been able to 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:52.819
 see in and in it 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.349
 we have also been able to test for 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:57.080
 outsource line that many of you 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:59.510
 you will already be testing it thanks to the beta 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:01.580
 open that it was possible to do through 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.080
 of playstationnetwork and then to 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:05.480
 end in electronic shelf we have 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:07.190
 displaced to ubisoft there we have played 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.930
 we have been able to see the four games 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.849
 principal that the gala company has 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:13.670
 brought here to the angels and among them 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:16.040
 and the main one of these is critical 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.870
 that we have both the part of the 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.790
 single player like the cooperative and 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.970
 The truth is that we loved it because 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:24.979
 the binding mix of history 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.720
 killer and being able to play with different 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:28.130
 purchases through the internet is the 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.900
 bet more strongly that the 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:32.139
 gala company in this strip in this 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.040
 franchise we have also been able to 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:35.750
 in 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.120
 in a game mode where we 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.620
 we face another another driver and 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.050
 we had to destroy his car the 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.870
 approach was along a beach 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:47.600
 very very extensive and here after several 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:50.630
 kilometers we have been able to crush the 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:52.700
 rival and be able to finally knock him down 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:54.080
 we have closed the day with two 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:56.630
 games with far cry 4 in which we have 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.130
 could see in the cooperative part of the 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.660
 part where a partner joined us 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:01.700
 and also that we have also seen
