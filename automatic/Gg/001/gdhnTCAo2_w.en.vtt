00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
and playing in real time I can decide if

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:50.200

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
speed that I want it to but if you come

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.490 
speed that I want it to but if you come
over<00:01:53.060> here<00:01:53.270> and<00:01:53.390> look<00:01:53.570> at<00:01:53.689> the<00:01:53.810> globe<00:01:54.109> you<00:01:54.350> can

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
over here and look at the globe you can

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.990 
over here and look at the globe you can
