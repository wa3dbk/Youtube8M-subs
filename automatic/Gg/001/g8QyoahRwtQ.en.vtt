00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
when I ordered it I expected it to be of

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.759 
when I ordered it I expected it to be of
more<00:00:29.369> solid<00:00:30.210> material<00:00:30.689> I<00:00:30.720> guess<00:00:30.900> like<00:00:31.140> plastic

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
more solid material I guess like plastic

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.040 
more solid material I guess like plastic
obviously<00:00:32.130> not<00:00:32.250> metal<00:00:32.520> or<00:00:32.610> anything<00:00:32.790> but<00:00:33.180> it

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
obviously not metal or anything but it

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.020 
obviously not metal or anything but it
is<00:00:34.079> kind<00:00:34.380> of<00:00:34.500> flimsy<00:00:35.190> you<00:00:35.489> can<00:00:35.640> see<00:00:35.760> that<00:00:35.910> it

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
is kind of flimsy you can see that it

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.229 
is kind of flimsy you can see that it
like<00:00:36.180> bends<00:00:36.480> like<00:00:37.260> a<00:00:37.290> giant<00:00:37.790> frisbee<00:00:38.790> type

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
like bends like a giant frisbee type

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.889 
like bends like a giant frisbee type
thing<00:00:39.510> you<00:00:39.860> know<00:00:40.860> obviously<00:00:41.309> if<00:00:41.550> you<00:00:41.780> got<00:00:42.780> it

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
thing you know obviously if you got it

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.360 
thing you know obviously if you got it
caught<00:00:43.200> in<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.410> situation--<00:00:43.920> or<00:00:44.040> something

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
caught in a situation-- or something

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.340 
caught in a situation-- or something
could<00:00:44.940> probably<00:00:45.180> snap<00:00:45.510> in<00:00:45.660> half<00:00:48.020> but<00:00:49.020> it<00:00:49.140> does

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
could probably snap in half but it does

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.670 
could probably snap in half but it does
look<00:00:49.559> good<00:00:49.770> in<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.399> costume<00:00:51.289> it<00:00:52.289> doesn't<00:00:52.559> look

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
look good in the costume it doesn't look

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.650 
look good in the costume it doesn't look
like<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:53.070> shield<00:00:53.640> that<00:00:53.760> they<00:00:54.120> have<00:00:54.329> on<00:00:54.510> the

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
simple unfortunately so like if anyone

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.640

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
you could paint it or you could always

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.660 
you could paint it or you could always
like<00:01:12.720> draw<00:01:13.560> a<00:01:13.590> little<00:01:13.770> battle<00:01:14.159> damage<00:01:14.460> things

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.140 
pretty flimsy for the for putting it on
they<00:01:22.920> just<00:01:22.950> have<00:01:23.220> two<00:01:23.369> black<00:01:23.640> straps<00:01:24.000> right

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.660 
here and there's kind of like two black
straps<00:01:28.040> don't<00:01:29.040> know<00:01:29.100> if<00:01:29.189> you<00:01:29.250> can<00:01:29.400> see<00:01:29.520> that

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
straps don't know if you can see that

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.440 
straps don't know if you can see that
and<00:01:30.090> this<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.229> top<00:01:31.439> part<00:01:31.680> velcro's<00:01:32.240> but<00:01:33.240> I'm

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
and this the top part velcro's but I'm

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.910 
and this the top part velcro's but I'm
not<00:01:33.600> sure<00:01:33.780> exactly<00:01:33.990> what<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.409> top<00:01:34.590> part<00:01:34.799> is

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
not sure exactly what the top part is

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.880 
not sure exactly what the top part is
for<00:01:35.130> unless<00:01:35.549> I<00:01:35.850> guess<00:01:36.450> there<00:01:36.740> you<00:01:37.740> have<00:01:37.860> a

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
for unless I guess there you have a

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.640 
for unless I guess there you have a
smaller<00:01:38.280> arm<00:01:38.549> or<00:01:38.790> something<00:01:39.229> because<00:01:40.229> you<00:01:40.500> can

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
smaller arm or something because you can

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.190 
smaller arm or something because you can
basically<00:01:40.799> slip<00:01:41.310> in<00:01:41.520> your<00:01:41.729> whole<00:01:42.689> arm<00:01:42.899> through

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
basically slip in your whole arm through

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.889 
basically slip in your whole arm through
the<00:01:43.259> bottom<00:01:43.590> straps<00:01:44.070> right<00:01:44.310> here<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:45.270> you<00:01:45.750> can

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
the bottom straps right here and you can

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.600 
the bottom straps right here and you can
just<00:01:45.930> strap<00:01:46.619> this<00:01:46.799> on<00:01:46.979> for<00:01:47.189> better<00:01:47.399> support

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
just strap this on for better support

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.550 
just strap this on for better support
before<00:01:48.060> you<00:01:48.270> complete<00:01:48.540> your<00:01:48.630> arm<00:01:48.930> between

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
before you complete your arm between

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.590 
before you complete your arm between
them<00:01:49.740> I<00:01:49.920> guess<00:01:50.149> maybe<00:01:51.149> that's<00:01:51.329> how<00:01:51.479> it's

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
them I guess maybe that's how it's

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.660 
them I guess maybe that's how it's
supposed<00:01:51.869> to<00:01:51.899> go<00:01:52.159> so<00:01:53.159> you<00:01:53.250> have<00:01:53.340> something<00:01:53.549> to

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
supposed to go so you have something to

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.399 
supposed to go so you have something to
grip<00:01:53.880> on<00:01:54.060> so<00:01:54.689> when<00:01:54.780> you<00:01:54.869> grip<00:01:55.020> it<00:01:55.049> you<00:01:55.320> know
