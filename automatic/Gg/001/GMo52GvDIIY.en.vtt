00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.080
 we have a new position of the week 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.550
 In this guy he expresses Nintendo as follows 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.469
 and in particular the view 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.150
 is going to make another comeback and I have 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.309
 frankly quite a hard one there 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.929
 head in it will lead it in 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.779
 well or if you if you are live through the 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.039
 microphone watch the video 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.840
 that just doesn't go well for me 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.060
 Nintendo Wii even said more 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.380
 this is true and maybe not a species 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.090
 of the now not in so many words but 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.189
 good to have their preference they are huge 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.650
 adjusted and taste for the third time 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.829
 in a row a quarterly loss that is 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.270
 just not the nintendo that we know 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:38.040
 of the past years that is with the who 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.100
 the original who is also really extreme 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.899
 gone but the wheel is now 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.520
 lands on the gamecube and niveautje 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.780
 all know how that ended 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.280
 so i guess it's just the comeback 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.469
 it might be a last thing 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.579
 convulsions and, on the assumption, I dance 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.079
 those not on the grave of your toes 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.879
 I did not, I think I also 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.710
 I don't think so with the bath water 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.309
 but xs and ys to the year old 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.500
 become 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.480
 yes in t i think so too i say i 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.129
 think let me let me have a reunion 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.960
 have the most recent sales figures 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.549
 and that is indeed the who how 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:13.250
 has sold only 30% of the forecast 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:16.979
 but the 3ds was the best-selling 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.030
 console in the west in 2013 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.890
 and he also has no goals 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.750
 so the only thing I see is one 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.700
 theory cannot count 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.259
 yes well then about the video we can 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.000
 anyway it might be that 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.650
 we own statement that that's you 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.290
 maybe it should be gone and that in that 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.759
 that they are not stiff and direct 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.049
 presentations i time for what 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.909
 rejuvenation and renewal 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.530
 parents must always have hearts allowed 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.000
 you must hand me may not that 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.979
 research taught manners 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.380
 way yes look we were whatever it was 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.600
 pity with the video is that it is one 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.070
 confusing name anyway consumers who 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.259
 but he said to see that coming 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.820
 that she it who harry niehof that it 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.500
 that was heated and confusing 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.299
 marketing is just not good and 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.770
 so on the belly winter values as soon as 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.079
 these people who don't understand this 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.729
 not live view is that this is the gamepad 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.500
 some wild beating heart is about one 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.530
 cpu the stentor rare 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.450
 the weird odor thingy 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.430
 anyway this is not the video this kind of 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.340
 game pet included with the we use it for the 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.480
 people force we see group that is so 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.980
 confusing so not good about it 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.230
 thought okay that's the so i have 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.569
 something like that 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.640
 position yourself again make new ones 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:21.620
 marketing she wanted to be hardcore like me 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.250
 and all schedules device is in you 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.170
 Keys 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.989
 that failed they would years 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.150
 maybe know the casual 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:31.160
 unreliable followers yes unreliable 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.319
 would be what very often in the past 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.030
 it turned out that she is actually about how 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:36.769
 the hardcore nintendo group and yes that 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.040
 probably i would gamecube nintendo 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:41.450
 wii 6 sales figures 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.250
 but at the same time they are 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.330
 the console with the best data 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.220
 came true 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.810
 when Nintendo is driven into the corner 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.860
 they are often interesting than 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.360
 they really dare 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.250
 take risks what those people 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.140
 risks than that how do you see that it could 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.250
 experience tell me this master 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.720
 strategies 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.430
 the games that are now in the arrival 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:02.750
 little to use with aspects are super 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:04.160
 smash bros mario kart still a number of 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.720
 titles of that kind new airport for sure 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.400
 selling new self absolutely had 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.930
 definitely sell those hardcore nintendo 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.030
 games that all go screaming to the 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.940
 shop run look i think one 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.709
 only review the comeback he creates 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.630
 to come into substantial price reduction 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:19.100
 combination to the bundle photo with mario 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.140
 kart 8 or super smash brittle that's one 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.090
 completely new ep 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.470
 seems a stand so well that 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.140
 so i say i think miyamoto 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.760
 just very, very, very late 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.790
 know when it comes to new epic the 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.470
 man has proven something brilliant 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.540
 given us a wonderful franchise with the 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.290
 last new franchise and last 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.700
 new ep 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.790
 Wii was fit for their know platform 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.470
 for the Wii or Wii music or may they 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.880
 we forget not to mention a teacher anymore 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:46.400
 actually own you now very much the 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.690
 that scandal now really want the Wii fit 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.030
 you know in addition there are anyway 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.670
 all iterations from famous friend 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.380
 would you like it 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.120
 where i nintendo right me now who so 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.580
 he wants to innovate whether you want that cash 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.260
 pulled or not I miss that just report 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.569
 with the video i think they are here for more 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.340
 engine is now working in the deepest secrecy 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:05.739
 my totally new ep or a total 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.810
 new game idea but still good 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:08.380
 they play for the reasonable group 7 anyway 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.780
 what i mean 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.700
 mario kart 8 super smash brittle the numbers 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.940
 are there and they just publicly known 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:18.190
 made where i think satoru iwata 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:21.310
 from the summer already knew the who young 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:23.560
 was smooth but who knows she really 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:26.320
 come up with new ideas and that's good 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.930
 seems to me in case the the 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:31.360
 spin for Nintendo what do you think 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.950
 the wiu can comment on the position of the week 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.360
 I still come but can not dam the 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:36.160
 video one more I'll make him we have to 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.229
 do that with the proven classics or 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.030
 exactly what we would like 

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:41.800
 want to see that new hype is that which 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:45.970
 surprise the world again in conquering and 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:47.919
 and make people shake up enough 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.900
 yes it puts me in the comments and yes 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:52.410
 let us know and who knows 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:55.410
 will still look good with'm now 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:55.410
 for Business
