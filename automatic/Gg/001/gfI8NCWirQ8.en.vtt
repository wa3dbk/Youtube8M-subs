to bend this little part right over here

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.530 
to bend this little part right over here
where<00:02:14.470> my<00:02:14.590> thumb<00:02:14.620> is<00:02:15.090> and<00:02:16.090> just<00:02:16.239> take<00:02:16.510> a

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
where my thumb is and just take a

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.270 
where my thumb is and just take a
screwdriver<00:02:16.840> a<00:02:17.200> hammer<00:02:17.290> I<00:02:17.560> just<00:02:17.770> bang<00:02:17.980> it<00:02:18.010> down

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
screwdriver a hammer I just bang it down

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.640 
screwdriver a hammer I just bang it down
all<00:02:18.550> the<00:02:18.670> way<00:02:18.790> so<00:02:18.819> you<00:02:19.180> get<00:02:19.420> this<00:02:19.660> nut<00:02:20.470> off

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
all the way so you get this nut off

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.320 
all the way so you get this nut off
should<00:02:21.430> be<00:02:21.610> relatively<00:02:22.330> easy<00:02:22.930> but<00:02:24.000> no<00:02:25.000> old

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
should be relatively easy but no old

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.740 
should be relatively easy but no old
cars<00:02:25.420> and<00:02:26.140> BMW<00:02:26.950> might<00:02:27.849> be<00:02:28.030> more<00:02:28.360> of<00:02:28.480> a<00:02:28.569> bigger

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
cars and BMW might be more of a bigger

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:35.230 
cars and BMW might be more of a bigger
problem<00:02:29.050> but<00:02:29.440> we'll<00:02:29.800> see<00:02:29.980> how<00:02:30.069> this<00:02:30.220> goes

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.180 

and<00:02:35.660> again<00:02:36.140> that's<00:02:36.290> going<00:02:36.440> to<00:02:36.560> tie<00:02:36.740> right<00:02:36.950> out

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
and again that's going to tie right out

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.980 
and again that's going to tie right out
and<00:02:39.160> to<00:02:40.160> do<00:02:40.280> this<00:02:40.460> you<00:02:40.730> need<00:02:40.850> a<00:02:40.910> special<00:02:41.450> tool<00:02:41.480> I

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990 
and to do this you need a special tool I

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.050 
and to do this you need a special tool I
don't<00:02:42.770> have<00:02:42.920> this<00:02:43.070> special<00:02:43.490> tool<00:02:43.610> so<00:02:43.820> I<00:02:43.850> used

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
don't have this special tool so I used

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.870 
don't have this special tool so I used
to<00:02:44.180> write<00:02:44.600> scripts<00:02:44.990> the<00:02:45.860> pipe<00:02:46.100> to<00:02:46.370> connect<00:02:46.760> the

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
to write scripts the pipe to connect the

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:47.530 
to write scripts the pipe to connect the
end<00:02:47.030> of<00:02:47.180> it

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
end of it

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.260 
end of it
that<00:02:47.960> was<00:02:48.080> my<00:02:48.200> leverage<00:02:48.650> get<00:02:49.640> it<00:02:49.730> down

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
that was my leverage get it down

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:53.380 
that was my leverage get it down
connected<00:02:51.430> save<00:02:52.430> it<00:02:52.550> so<00:02:52.700> you<00:02:53.030> can<00:02:53.180> see<00:02:53.330> the

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
connected save it so you can see the

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.500 
connected save it so you can see the
scratch<00:02:53.930> marks<00:02:53.960> it<00:02:54.530> but<00:02:55.070> this<00:02:55.940> is<00:02:56.120> garbage

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
scratch marks it but this is garbage

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.540 
scratch marks it but this is garbage
anyway<00:02:56.870> so<00:02:57.520> but<00:02:58.720> this<00:02:59.720> is<00:02:59.870> 32<00:03:00.140> millimeters<00:03:00.770> to

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
anyway so but this is 32 millimeters to

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:08.830 
anyway so but this is 32 millimeters to
5<00:03:01.820> to<00:03:02.800> work<00:03:03.800> with<00:03:03.980> that<00:03:04.270> so<00:03:07.480> but<00:03:08.480> once<00:03:08.720> you

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
5 to work with that so but once you

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:15.630 
5 to work with that so but once you
break<00:03:08.960> it<00:03:09.170> free<00:03:09.460> really<00:03:10.460> easy<00:03:11.060> to<00:03:11.420> unscrew<00:03:11.950> and

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:21.190 

that's<00:03:16.640> about<00:03:16.880> it<00:03:17.060> for<00:03:17.210> that<00:03:17.270> part<00:03:19.660> so<00:03:20.660> I<00:03:20.960> got

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
that's about it for that part so I got

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.550 
that's about it for that part so I got
both<00:03:21.410> of<00:03:21.440> them<00:03:21.680> off<00:03:22.780> you<00:03:23.780> can<00:03:23.840> tell<00:03:24.110> this<00:03:24.320> one

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
both of them off you can tell this one

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.820 
both of them off you can tell this one
let's<00:03:24.770> replace<00:03:25.130> before<00:03:25.700> as<00:03:26.030> less<00:03:27.020> resistant<00:03:27.680> I

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:27.830 
let's replace before as less resistant I

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:32.530 
let's replace before as less resistant I
actually<00:03:28.070> have<00:03:28.370> to<00:03:28.930> foster<00:03:29.930> but<00:03:30.620> still<00:03:31.330> not<00:03:32.330> as

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
actually have to foster but still not as

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:38.400 
actually have to foster but still not as
it<00:03:32.810> should<00:03:32.840> be<00:03:33.230> more<00:03:33.560> stiffer<00:03:35.080> same<00:03:36.080> with<00:03:36.260> this

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
it should be more stiffer same with this

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.580 
it should be more stiffer same with this
but<00:03:39.410> this<00:03:39.860> one<00:03:40.040> has<00:03:40.250> totally<00:03:40.730> let<00:03:40.940> go<00:03:41.150> I<00:03:41.590> mean

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
but this one has totally let go I mean

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.080 
but this one has totally let go I mean
really<00:03:42.770> have<00:03:42.980> to<00:03:43.100> use<00:03:43.250> much<00:03:43.490> force<00:03:43.760> I<00:03:43.940> could

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
really have to use much force I could

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.160 
really have to use much force I could
just<00:03:44.240> use<00:03:44.390> my<00:03:44.420> thumb<00:03:45.340> so<00:03:46.340> on<00:03:46.430> you<00:03:46.550> have<00:03:46.580> to<00:03:46.790> use

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
just use my thumb so on you have to use

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.800 
just use my thumb so on you have to use
much<00:03:48.170> more<00:03:48.410> force<00:03:49.300> I'm<00:03:50.300> gonna<00:03:50.540> replace

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
much more force I'm gonna replace

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:56.980 
much more force I'm gonna replace
anyways<00:03:51.260> and<00:03:51.500> some<00:03:51.740> tack<00:03:51.950> on<00:03:52.160> this<00:03:52.280> job<00:03:52.780> but<00:03:55.990> do

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:56.990 
anyways and some tack on this job but do

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:05.490 
anyways and some tack on this job but do
that<00:03:57.170> that's<00:03:58.130> no<00:03:58.340> good

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.559 

so<00:04:06.500> could<00:04:07.189> use<00:04:07.370> replacing<00:04:07.970> because<00:04:08.180> the<00:04:08.420> wheel

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:08.569 
so could use replacing because the wheel

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:10.360 
so could use replacing because the wheel
was<00:04:08.780> wobbling<00:04:09.230> back<00:04:09.560> and<00:04:09.590> forth<00:04:09.980> left<00:04:10.159> to

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
was wobbling back and forth left to

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.670 
was wobbling back and forth left to
right<00:04:10.579> so<00:04:11.650> -<00:04:12.650> well<00:04:12.950> replace<00:04:13.280> it<00:04:13.340> said<00:04:13.849> since

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
right so - well replace it said since

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:23.980 
right so - well replace it said since
I'm<00:04:15.680> already<00:04:15.920> doing<00:04:16.130> this<00:04:16.370> job<00:04:22.690> the<00:04:23.690> parts

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
I'm already doing this job the parts

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.820 
I'm already doing this job the parts
came<00:04:24.199> in<00:04:24.500> and<00:04:25.810> what<00:04:26.810> you<00:04:26.900> want<00:04:27.110> to<00:04:27.169> do<00:04:27.380> before

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
aligned once you get stoking up the

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.800 
aligned once you get stoking up the
alignment<00:04:33.889> when<00:04:34.160> you<00:04:34.220> put<00:04:34.430> the<00:04:34.850> tie<00:04:35.240> rod<00:04:35.510> and

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:44.439 
but just make sure they're the same size
same<00:04:38.960> part<00:04:40.690> at<00:04:41.690> least<00:04:41.840> same<00:04:42.500> quality<00:04:43.180> close<00:04:44.180> to

same part at least same quality close to
it

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:54.790 
it
these<00:04:46.490> are<00:04:46.729> not<00:04:46.850> BMW<00:04:49.090> genuine<00:04:50.090> BMW<00:04:50.270> but<00:04:53.800> still

these are not BMW genuine BMW but still

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.040 
these are not BMW genuine BMW but still
good

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:01.269 

now<00:04:58.050> let's<00:04:58.319> turn<00:04:59.039> this<00:04:59.189> back<00:04:59.430> on<00:04:59.759> to<00:04:59.969> the<00:05:00.089> rack

00:05:01.269 --> 00:05:01.279 
now let's turn this back on to the rack

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:07.249 
now let's turn this back on to the rack
of<00:05:02.279> the<00:05:02.400> washoe<00:05:05.330> after<00:05:06.330> you<00:05:06.449> get<00:05:06.599> this<00:05:06.749> back<00:05:07.020> on

00:05:07.249 --> 00:05:07.259 
of the washoe after you get this back on

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:10.579 
of the washoe after you get this back on
with<00:05:07.529> the<00:05:07.650> lock<00:05:07.830> not<00:05:08.099> secure<00:05:09.229> you<00:05:10.229> want<00:05:10.439> to

00:05:10.579 --> 00:05:10.589 
with the lock not secure you want to

00:05:10.589 --> 00:05:13.719 
with the lock not secure you want to
count<00:05:11.099> your<00:05:11.189> thread<00:05:11.550> to<00:05:11.580> make<00:05:11.939> sure<00:05:12.150> it's<00:05:12.539> as

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:13.729 
count your thread to make sure it's as

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:17.420 
count your thread to make sure it's as
the<00:05:14.729> old<00:05:14.879> ones<00:05:15.150> used<00:05:15.479> to<00:05:15.629> be<00:05:15.830> my<00:05:16.830> case<00:05:17.129> the

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:17.430 
the old ones used to be my case the

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:18.649 
the old ones used to be my case the
eight<00:05:17.639> so<00:05:17.969> I'm<00:05:18.029> going<00:05:18.180> to<00:05:18.210> count<00:05:18.360> eight

00:05:18.649 --> 00:05:18.659 
eight so I'm going to count eight

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:22.670 
eight so I'm going to count eight
threads<00:05:19.520> and<00:05:20.520> lock<00:05:20.999> the<00:05:21.180> knot<00:05:21.360> until<00:05:21.749> it's

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 
threads and lock the knot until it's

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.149 
threads and lock the knot until it's
eight<00:05:23.509> tighten<00:05:24.509> it<00:05:24.539> up<00:05:24.779> make<00:05:25.680> sure<00:05:25.830> it's<00:05:25.979> good

00:05:26.149 --> 00:05:26.159 
eight tighten it up make sure it's good

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:34.510 
eight tighten it up make sure it's good
and<00:05:26.189> secure<00:05:27.110> and<00:05:28.110> then<00:05:29.749> go<00:05:30.749> on<00:05:30.870> from<00:05:31.050> there

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:34.520 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.730 

after<00:05:35.520> you<00:05:35.639> secure<00:05:36.029> the<00:05:36.149> lock<00:05:36.300> nut<00:05:36.620> and<00:05:37.620> get

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:37.740 
after you secure the lock nut and get

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.639 
after you secure the lock nut and get
this<00:05:37.949> into<00:05:38.279> place<00:05:38.520> and<00:05:38.789> you<00:05:38.849> put<00:05:38.999> the<00:05:39.089> knob

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:39.649 
this into place and you put the knob
