to come on screen that you're gonna see
in<00:01:53.119> just<00:01:53.300> a<00:01:53.420> second<00:01:53.840> here<00:01:54.020> we<00:01:54.229> are<00:01:54.380> five<00:01:54.679> four

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:55.160 
in just a second here we are five four

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.600 
in just a second here we are five four
three<00:01:55.190> two<00:01:55.819> one<00:01:56.750> and<00:01:57.080> then<00:01:57.979> the<00:01:58.099> Rockets<00:01:58.489> going

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
three two one and then the Rockets going

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.479 
three two one and then the Rockets going
to<00:01:58.700> launch<00:01:58.910> and<00:01:59.420> it<00:02:00.380> is<00:02:00.530> honestly<00:02:00.979> one<00:02:01.280> of<00:02:01.399> the

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:01.489 
to launch and it is honestly one of the

00:02:01.489 --> 00:02:03.730 
to launch and it is honestly one of the
best<00:02:01.610> things<00:02:02.000> we've<00:02:02.660> had<00:02:02.869> to<00:02:03.140> eat<00:02:03.410> your

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
best things we've had to eat your

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.800 
best things we've had to eat your
at<00:02:04.130> least<00:02:04.340> this<00:02:04.880> is<00:02:05.119> great<00:02:05.420> follow-up

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
at least this is great follow-up

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.139 
at least this is great follow-up
compared<00:02:06.200> to<00:02:06.259> the<00:02:06.350> last<00:02:06.500> one<00:02:06.920> the<00:02:07.790> rocket

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
compared to the last one the rocket

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.630 
compared to the last one the rocket
shoots<00:02:08.360> off<00:02:08.569> into<00:02:08.810> space<00:02:08.959> and<00:02:09.470> then<00:02:09.920> you're

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
shoots off into space and then you're

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.400 
shoots off into space and then you're
almost<00:02:10.910> done<00:02:11.390> at<00:02:11.540> this<00:02:11.720> point<00:02:12.020> there's<00:02:12.200> one

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
almost done at this point there's one

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:13.839 
almost done at this point there's one
last<00:02:12.560> step<00:02:12.860> you<00:02:12.920> have<00:02:13.069> to<00:02:13.220> do<00:02:13.340> if<00:02:13.459> go<00:02:13.670> and

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:13.849 
last step you have to do if go and

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:16.540 
last step you have to do if go and
retrieve<00:02:14.209> that<00:02:14.989> pad<00:02:15.470> so<00:02:15.860> you<00:02:15.920> have<00:02:16.160> the<00:02:16.310> date

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
retrieve that pad so you have the date

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.960 
retrieve that pad so you have the date
up<00:02:16.760> you're<00:02:17.450> going<00:02:17.569> to<00:02:17.630> go<00:02:17.780> put<00:02:17.989> it<00:02:18.050> inside

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
up you're going to go put it inside

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.050 
up you're going to go put it inside
