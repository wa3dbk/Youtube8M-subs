00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
miss but he's another one of these

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.790 
miss but he's another one of these
bosses<00:00:47.489> where<00:00:47.850> you<00:00:47.969> can<00:00:48.120> block<00:00:48.770> basically<00:00:49.770> a

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
hundred percent of his attacks so as

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.619 
hundred percent of his attacks so as
soon<00:00:52.350> as<00:00:52.440> you<00:00:52.559> take<00:00:52.770> out<00:00:52.980> those<00:00:53.520> dogs<00:00:53.910> it's<00:00:54.360> not

that<00:00:54.899> hard<00:00:55.140> of<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.289> boss<00:00:55.440> fight<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:55.710> like<00:00:56.039> you

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
that hard of a boss fight and like you

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.770 
that hard of a boss fight and like you
do<00:00:56.309> a<00:00:56.340> ton<00:00:56.640> of<00:00:56.699> damage<00:00:56.940> to<00:00:57.239> him<00:00:57.329> -<00:00:57.480> like<00:00:57.600> that

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
do a ton of damage to him - like that

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.950 
do a ton of damage to him - like that
one<00:00:57.989> swipe<00:00:58.350> I<00:00:58.649> mean<00:00:59.280> it<00:00:59.910> granted<00:01:00.390> that<00:01:00.750> one

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
one swipe I mean it granted that one

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.750 
one swipe I mean it granted that one
swipe<00:01:01.230> didn't<00:01:01.620> do<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.739> ton<00:01:02.039> of<00:01:02.070> damage<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.640> him

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
swipe didn't do a ton of damage to him

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.490 
swipe didn't do a ton of damage to him
overall<00:01:03.239> but<00:01:03.690> compared<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.080> some<00:01:04.379> of<00:01:04.470> the

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
overall but compared to some of the

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.509 
overall but compared to some of the
bosses<00:01:04.920> that<00:01:04.949> I've<00:01:05.159> been<00:01:05.339> fighting

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
bosses that I've been fighting

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.130 
bosses that I've been fighting
throughout<00:01:05.909> this<00:01:06.030> game<00:01:06.270> it's<00:01:06.630> a<00:01:06.750> lot<00:01:07.080> of

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
throughout this game it's a lot of

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.160 
throughout this game it's a lot of
damage<00:01:07.619> but<00:01:08.100> it's<00:01:08.250> one<00:01:08.430> swipe<00:01:08.850> right<00:01:09.600> exactly

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
damage but it's one swipe right exactly

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.780 
damage but it's one swipe right exactly
and<00:01:10.380> you're<00:01:10.860> never<00:01:11.070> gonna<00:01:11.189> get<00:01:11.430> off<00:01:11.549> more<00:01:11.760> than

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
and you're never gonna get off more than

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.710 
and you're never gonna get off more than
one<00:01:12.619> but<00:01:13.619> I<00:01:13.680> guess<00:01:13.920> he's<00:01:14.189> pretty<00:01:14.400> quick<00:01:14.720> it's

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
one but I guess he's pretty quick it's

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.109 
one but I guess he's pretty quick it's
it's<00:01:16.110> probably<00:01:16.229> not<00:01:16.740> smart<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.340> ever<00:01:17.369> do<00:01:17.790> more

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
it's probably not smart to ever do more

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.690 
it's probably not smart to ever do more
than<00:01:18.330> one<00:01:18.600> swipe<00:01:19.100> just<00:01:20.100> because<00:01:20.430> you're<00:01:20.610> not

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
than one swipe just because you're not

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.210 
than one swipe just because you're not
going<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:20.970> have<00:01:21.090> enough<00:01:21.360> stamina<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.619> block<00:01:22.890> a

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
going to have enough stamina to block a

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.609 
going to have enough stamina to block a
double-handed<00:01:24.000> attack<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:25.110> you<00:01:25.229> can<00:01:25.380> tell

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
double-handed attack and you can tell

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.640 
double-handed attack and you can tell
like<00:01:26.549> I<00:01:27.150> don't<00:01:27.960> comply<00:01:28.140> understand<00:01:28.500> how<00:01:28.590> the

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
like I don't comply understand how the

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.109 
like I don't comply understand how the
double-handed<00:01:29.100> stuff<00:01:29.520> works<00:01:29.759> in<00:01:29.909> this<00:01:30.000> game

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
double-handed stuff works in this game

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.780 
double-handed stuff works in this game
but<00:01:30.450> like<00:01:30.570> it<00:01:30.840> it<00:01:31.619> looks<00:01:31.770> like<00:01:31.920> he<00:01:32.100> can<00:01:32.280> tap<00:01:32.520> why

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
but like it it looks like he can tap why

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.640 
but like it it looks like he can tap why
