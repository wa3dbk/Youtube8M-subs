production of these boolean pieces had

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.120 
production of these boolean pieces had
everything<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:40.049> do<00:01:40.200> with<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.560> ramp<00:01:40.770> up<00:01:40.950> and

fractional type rounds and bars and that

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.630 
fractional type rounds and bars and that
is<00:01:59.640> just<00:02:00.570> a<00:02:00.719> craziness<00:02:01.380> that's<00:02:01.409> going<00:02:01.710> on<00:02:02.009> so

see it here with the despot e toning is
how<00:02:22.600> exactly<00:02:23.080> the<00:02:23.590> way<00:02:23.740> I<00:02:23.770> bought<00:02:24.070> it<00:02:24.250> and<00:02:24.540> same

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
how exactly the way I bought it and same

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:32.330 
how exactly the way I bought it and same
reverse<00:02:25.720> only<00:02:26.560> this<00:02:26.740> one<00:02:26.980> says<00:02:27.250> one<00:02:27.520> tenth<00:02:28.890> ok

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340

so that's the the 110th they didn't make

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.290 
so that's the the 110th they didn't make
a<00:02:35.350> whole<00:02:35.560> lot<00:02:35.620> of<00:02:35.920> these<00:02:36.040> and<00:02:36.370> a<00:02:36.640> lot<00:02:37.030> of<00:02:37.060> them

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
a whole lot of these and a lot of them

so<00:04:07.870> low<00:04:08.870> mintage<00:04:10.480> to<00:04:11.480> give<00:04:11.660> you<00:04:11.780> an<00:04:11.870> idea<00:04:11.990> the

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
so low mintage to give you an idea the

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.320 
so low mintage to give you an idea the
regular<00:04:12.740> libertad<00:04:13.250> so<00:04:13.460> I<00:04:13.520> think<00:04:13.580> they<00:04:13.880> for

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:14.330 
regular libertad so I think they for

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.260 
regular libertad so I think they for
this<00:04:14.510> year<00:04:14.720> they<00:04:14.840> made<00:04:14.870> a<00:04:15.080> couple<00:04:15.380> million<00:04:16.270> so

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:17.270 
this year they made a couple million so

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:19.390 
this year they made a couple million so
quite<00:04:17.480> a<00:04:17.510> bit<00:04:17.720> more<00:04:17.900> but<00:04:18.230> the<00:04:18.380> mintage<00:04:18.950> is<00:04:19.130> so

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
quite a bit more but the mintage is so

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.720 
quite a bit more but the mintage is so
much<00:04:19.610> far<00:04:20.030> less<00:04:20.270> than<00:04:20.630> the<00:04:21.530> american<00:04:22.370> silver

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:22.730 
much far less than the american silver

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:24.790 
much far less than the american silver
eagle<00:04:23.060> and<00:04:23.270> then<00:04:23.510> here<00:04:23.780> is<00:04:23.870> a<00:04:23.900> tiny<00:04:24.380> tiny

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800

there's<00:04:30.470> no<00:04:30.620> difference<00:04:31.070> no<00:04:31.310> carryover<00:04:31.880> this

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
there's no difference no carryover this

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:37.690 
there's no difference no carryover this
one's<00:04:32.480> a<00:04:32.600> 97<00:04:33.910> 20,000<00:04:34.910> pieces<00:04:35.090> were<00:04:35.450> minted<00:04:36.700> for

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:37.700 
one's a 97 20,000 pieces were minted for

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.320 
one's a 97 20,000 pieces were minted for
the<00:04:37.910> Libertad<00:04:38.570> the<00:04:38.840> fractional<00:04:39.410> is<00:04:39.560> the<00:04:39.770> 98

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
the Libertad the fractional is the 98

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:46.060 
the Libertad the fractional is the 98
1999<00:04:41.330> are<00:04:41.660> the<00:04:41.810> lowest<00:04:42.080> mintage<00:04:44.590> for<00:04:45.590> these<00:04:45.740> I

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.070 
1999 are the lowest mintage for these I

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:48.760 
1999 are the lowest mintage for these I
think<00:04:46.880> they<00:04:47.210> dip<00:04:47.540> down<00:04:47.690> under<00:04:48.020> ten<00:04:48.230> thousand

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770 
think they dip down under ten thousand

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:50.740 
think they dip down under ten thousand
eight<00:04:48.890> thousand<00:04:49.490> seven<00:04:49.880> thousand<00:04:50.360> somewhere

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.540 
that's how I roll five grams point nine
nine<00:05:28.580> fine<00:05:29.200> so<00:05:30.200> this<00:05:30.410> isn't<00:05:30.740> really<00:05:30.800> the

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:31.550 
nine fine so this isn't really the

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:34.810 
nine fine so this isn't really the
dahlonega<00:05:32.180> meant<00:05:32.420> that<00:05:32.750> produced<00:05:33.320> all<00:05:34.250> of<00:05:34.670> the

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:34.820

it's<00:05:39.080> actually<00:05:39.380> a<00:05:39.650> separate<00:05:40.160> company<00:05:40.340> that

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:40.760 
it's actually a separate company that

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:44.510 
it's actually a separate company that
operates<00:05:41.210> out<00:05:41.450> of<00:05:42.220> Dahlonega<00:05:43.220> Georgia

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 
operates out of Dahlonega Georgia

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.930

I<00:05:45.710> guess<00:05:46.710> they<00:05:46.889> picked<00:05:47.129> up<00:05:47.280> the<00:05:47.400> rights<00:05:47.610> to<00:05:47.759> the

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:47.940 
I guess they picked up the rights to the

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:49.670 
I guess they picked up the rights to the
name<00:05:48.270> and<00:05:48.629> they<00:05:48.720> produce<00:05:48.930> these<00:05:49.229> during<00:05:49.560> the

this<00:05:52.860> design<00:05:53.430> I<00:05:53.729> could<00:05:54.060> not<00:05:54.210> find<00:05:54.240> another

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:54.840 
this design I could not find another

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:58.070 
this design I could not find another
design<00:05:55.259> like<00:05:55.500> this<00:05:56.090> it's<00:05:57.090> not<00:05:57.270> a<00:05:57.330> one-off<00:05:57.690> I'm

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 
design like this it's not a one-off I'm

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.330 
design like this it's not a one-off I'm
sure<00:05:58.289> there<00:05:58.500> are<00:05:58.590> others<00:05:58.830> just<00:05:58.860> like<00:05:59.190> it

00:05:59.330 --> 00:05:59.340 
sure there are others just like it

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:01.899 
sure there are others just like it
there's<00:05:59.789> just<00:05:59.970> not<00:06:00.120> many<00:06:00.479> out<00:06:00.720> in<00:06:00.840> the<00:06:00.930> market
