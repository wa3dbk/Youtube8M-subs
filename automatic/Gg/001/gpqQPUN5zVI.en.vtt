happy<00:01:49.450> with<00:01:49.630> the<00:01:49.690> day<00:01:49.840> hey<00:01:50.770> thirds<00:01:51.340> okay<00:01:51.640> but<00:01:51.850> I

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
happy with the day hey thirds okay but I

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.180 
happy with the day hey thirds okay but I
like<00:01:52.030> to<00:01:52.149> be<00:01:52.240> a<00:01:52.300> bit<00:01:52.450> closer<00:01:52.780> to<00:01:53.110> to<00:01:53.860> run<00:01:54.009> of<00:01:54.100> the

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:54.190 
like to be a bit closer to to run of the

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:55.410 
like to be a bit closer to to run of the
hoop<00:01:54.340> I<00:01:54.490> think<00:01:54.670> hubo<00:01:54.910> would<00:01:55.060> have<00:01:55.149> been<00:01:55.240> pretty

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
hoop I think hubo would have been pretty

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:56.779 
hoop I think hubo would have been pretty
close<00:01:55.569> to<00:01:55.720> Ronald<00:01:55.990> if<00:01:56.080> you<00:01:56.170> hadn't<00:01:56.410> crashed

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
the 112th firmament here but even they

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.010 
the 112th firmament here but even they
are<00:02:06.670> having<00:02:07.030> trouble<00:02:07.270> this<00:02:07.390> difficult<00:02:07.869> and

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
are having trouble this difficult and

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.020 
are having trouble this difficult and
tricky<00:02:08.349> track<00:02:08.590> layout<00:02:08.920> I<00:02:09.190> pushed<00:02:09.700> really

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
tricky track layout I pushed really

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.760 
tricky track layout I pushed really
really<00:02:10.209> hard<00:02:10.360> and<00:02:10.539> I<00:02:10.630> had<00:02:10.750> one<00:02:11.200> big<00:02:11.500> crash

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
really hard and I had one big crash

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.370 
really hard and I had one big crash
almost<00:02:12.490> killed<00:02:12.700> the<00:02:12.790> car<00:02:12.970> and<00:02:13.230> thank<00:02:14.230> God

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
almost killed the car and thank God

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.410 
almost killed the car and thank God
nothing<00:02:14.590> happened<00:02:14.770> yet<00:02:15.520> it's<00:02:15.849> not<00:02:16.000> easy<00:02:16.209> with

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
nothing happened yet it's not easy with

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.680 
nothing happened yet it's not easy with
the<00:02:17.260> dots<00:02:17.470> and<00:02:17.709> also<00:02:17.950> with<00:02:18.099> the<00:02:18.220> tape<00:02:18.459> but<00:02:19.300> I

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
the dots and also with the tape but I

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.890 
the dots and also with the tape but I
think<00:02:20.230> of<00:02:20.349> if<00:02:20.560> if<00:02:21.310> the<00:02:21.700> sorted<00:02:22.330> out<00:02:22.420> as<00:02:22.630> a

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
think of if if the sorted out as a

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.960 
think of if if the sorted out as a
problem<00:02:23.140> with<00:02:23.260> the<00:02:23.319> tape<00:02:23.530> and<00:02:23.760> another<00:02:24.760> thing

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
problem with the tape and another thing

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.699 
problem with the tape and another thing
I<00:02:25.209> mean<00:02:25.540> I<00:02:25.629> like<00:02:25.840> to<00:02:25.959> lay<00:02:26.079> out<00:02:26.200> so<00:02:26.470> I<00:02:26.500> hope

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
I mean I like to lay out so I hope

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.309 
I mean I like to lay out so I hope
everything<00:02:27.670> will<00:02:27.760> be<00:02:27.879> fine<00:02:28.060> for<00:02:28.299> you<00:02:28.390> went<00:02:28.540> now

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
everything will be fine for you went now

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:30.750 
everything will be fine for you went now
with<00:02:29.500> the<00:02:29.590> bot<00:02:29.769> dots<00:02:29.980> and<00:02:30.250> which

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
with the bot dots and which

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.100 
with the bot dots and which
in<00:02:30.909> cars<00:02:31.090> when<00:02:31.269> your<00:02:31.360> own<00:02:31.450> bot<00:02:31.599> does<00:02:31.750> is<00:02:31.930> pretty

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
in cars when your own bot does is pretty

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.240 
in cars when your own bot does is pretty
good<00:02:32.230> because<00:02:32.319> they<00:02:32.500> act<00:02:32.620> like<00:02:32.650> curbs<00:02:32.980> but

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
good because they act like curbs but

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.039 
good because they act like curbs but
obviously<00:02:33.580> with<00:02:34.299> the<00:02:34.480> car<00:02:34.659> running<00:02:34.689> only

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:35.049 
obviously with the car running only

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:37.289 
obviously with the car running only
three<00:02:35.709> mile<00:02:35.890> off<00:02:35.980> the<00:02:36.099> ground<00:02:36.340> the<00:02:36.939> doc<00:02:37.120> is

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:37.299 
three mile off the ground the doc is

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:40.170 
three mile off the ground the doc is
quite<00:02:37.540> big<00:02:37.720> so<00:02:37.780> it's<00:02:38.530> it's<00:02:39.310> good<00:02:39.640> to<00:02:39.790> drive<00:02:40.000> in

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
quite big so it's it's good to drive in

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.610 
quite big so it's it's good to drive in
a<00:02:40.269> way<00:02:40.360> because<00:02:40.510> you<00:02:40.659> haven't<00:02:40.870> got<00:02:40.959> a<00:02:40.989> solid

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
a way because you haven't got a solid

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.920 
a way because you haven't got a solid
track<00:02:41.920> markers<00:02:42.250> hit<00:02:42.519> but<00:02:42.819> if<00:02:43.150> you<00:02:43.360> do<00:02:43.510> hit<00:02:43.750> it

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
track markers hit but if you do hit it

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.960 
track markers hit but if you do hit it
you<00:02:44.170> do<00:02:44.319> fly<00:02:44.650> off<00:02:44.769> so<00:02:45.340> all<00:02:45.489> the<00:02:45.610> top<00:02:45.790> drivers

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
you do fly off so all the top drivers

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.789 
you do fly off so all the top drivers
have<00:02:46.180> plenty<00:02:46.540> of<00:02:46.569> work<00:02:46.810> to<00:02:46.840> do<00:02:47.049> and<00:02:47.140> we<00:02:47.200> asked

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:47.799 
have plenty of work to do and we asked

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:49.589 
have plenty of work to do and we asked
them<00:02:47.950> what<00:02:48.549> are<00:02:48.579> you<00:02:48.790> doing<00:02:49.030> over<00:02:49.450> the<00:02:49.569> course

the rest of qualifying well basically in

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.330 
the rest of qualifying well basically in
stock<00:02:52.209> your<00:02:52.360> toilet<00:02:52.840> was<00:02:53.049> gearing<00:02:53.470> and<00:02:53.500> wii

actually<00:02:59.079> with<00:02:59.230> tires<00:02:59.470> I<00:02:59.829> think<00:03:00.400> tires<00:03:00.640> i<00:03:00.819> will

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
actually with tires I think tires i will

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.599 
actually with tires I think tires i will
just<00:03:01.359> stick<00:03:01.510> with<00:03:01.689> pink<00:03:02.680> rear<00:03:02.859> magenta<00:03:03.340> france

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:03.609 
just stick with pink rear magenta france

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:05.490 
just stick with pink rear magenta france
that<00:03:03.790> without<00:03:04.060> well<00:03:04.569> eyes<00:03:04.690> are<00:03:04.840> using<00:03:05.109> all<00:03:05.319> day

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
that without well eyes are using all day
