and sometimes it's nice to play those

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:45.539 
and sometimes it's nice to play those
keys<00:00:44.170> without<00:00:44.350> so<00:00:44.710> you<00:00:44.769> can<00:00:44.949> get<00:00:45.069> forward

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:45.549 
keys without so you can get forward

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:57.950 
keys without so you can get forward
versions<00:00:45.999> of<00:00:46.089> the<00:00:46.239> gorge

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:05.070 

at<00:00:58.960> nine<00:01:01.079> okay<00:01:02.079> well<00:01:02.430> so<00:01:03.430> and<00:01:03.850> it<00:01:04.690> increases

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
at nine okay well so and it increases

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.560 
at nine okay well so and it increases
the<00:01:05.259> possibilities<00:01:06.159> for<00:01:06.670> example<00:01:07.119> has<00:01:07.300> a<00:01:07.330> lot

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570 
the possibilities for example has a lot

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:55.859 
the possibilities for example has a lot
of<00:01:07.600> things<00:01:12.540> our<00:01:13.540> d<00:01:51.509> what<00:01:53.190> I<00:01:54.190> did<00:01:54.700> over<00:01:54.880> data<00:01:55.300> so

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:55.869 
of things our d what I did over data so

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:58.139 
of things our d what I did over data so
that's<00:01:56.080> an<00:01:56.229> optimal<00:01:56.649> pretty<00:01:57.250> but<00:01:57.910> then

00:01:58.139 --> 00:01:58.149 
that's an optimal pretty but then

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:00.120 
that's an optimal pretty but then
there's<00:01:58.479> on<00:01:58.810> in<00:01:58.869> a<00:01:59.080> few<00:01:59.140> and<00:01:59.440> if<00:01:59.530> I<00:01:59.619> had<00:01:59.830> to<00:01:59.920> play

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
there's on in a few and if I had to play

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.680 
there's on in a few and if I had to play
the<00:02:00.520> Ricketts<00:02:00.819> 15<00:02:01.239> I<00:02:01.450> just<00:02:01.660> played<00:02:01.869> in<00:02:02.050> d

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.740 

or<00:02:05.530> another<00:02:05.950> third<00:02:06.250> option<00:02:06.550> would<00:02:07.360> be<00:02:07.420> capable

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
or another third option would be capable

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.290 
or another third option would be capable
and<00:02:08.050> then<00:02:08.229> tune<00:02:08.470> the<00:02:08.619> string<00:02:08.860> down<00:02:09.060> so<00:02:10.060> there's

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
and then tune the string down so there's

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.120 
and then tune the string down so there's
three<00:02:10.479> kind<00:02:10.780> of<00:02:10.900> ways<00:02:11.020> to<00:02:11.050> play<00:02:11.410> and<00:02:11.770> indeed

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
three kind of ways to play and indeed

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.090 
three kind of ways to play and indeed
there<00:02:15.130> are<00:02:15.160> others<00:02:15.670> and<00:02:16.620> factors<00:02:17.620> kind<00:02:17.920> of<00:02:18.040> the

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
there are others and factors kind of the

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:25.050 
there are others and factors kind of the
way<00:02:18.250> of<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:23.920> sounds<00:02:24.340> tentacle<00:02:24.790> but<00:02:24.940> it's

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
way of the sounds tentacle but it's

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:40.570 
way of the sounds tentacle but it's
really<00:02:25.330> simple<00:02:25.570> and

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.460 

okay<00:02:41.580> that's<00:02:41.819> that<00:02:42.209> song<00:02:42.540> has<00:02:42.810> an<00:02:42.989> awesome<00:02:43.110> G

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
okay that's that song has an awesome G

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.530 
okay that's that song has an awesome G
chord<00:02:43.860> and<00:02:44.459> two<00:02:44.970> others<00:02:45.390> it<00:02:46.319> has<00:02:46.500> this<00:02:46.709> one

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
chord and two others it has this one

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.890 
chord and two others it has this one
they<00:02:48.540> are<00:02:48.599> here<00:02:48.989> and<00:02:49.620> it<00:02:49.800> has<00:02:49.950> this<00:02:50.160> one<00:02:50.900> and

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
they are here and it has this one and

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.820 
they are here and it has this one and
that<00:02:51.930> is<00:02:52.319> a<00:02:52.640> two<00:02:53.640> and<00:02:53.670> A<00:02:54.450> or<00:02:54.690> ninth<00:02:55.020> of<00:02:55.470> you<00:02:55.590> go

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
that is a two and A or ninth of you go

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.360 
that is a two and A or ninth of you go
forth<00:02:56.130> and<00:02:56.430> the<00:02:56.610> six<00:02:56.850> and<00:02:57.739> so<00:02:58.739> if<00:02:58.770> I<00:02:58.950> put<00:02:59.160> those

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
forth and the six and so if I put those

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.100 
forth and the six and so if I put those
in<00:02:59.700> as<00:03:00.000> smokes<00:03:01.100> with<00:03:02.100> the<00:03:02.250> G<00:03:02.430> chord<00:03:02.700> it<00:03:03.540> makes<00:03:03.840> a

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
in as smokes with the G chord it makes a

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:22.009 
in as smokes with the G chord it makes a
Johnny<00:03:04.860> scale<00:03:18.860> okay<00:03:19.860> well<00:03:20.400> this<00:03:21.360> pentatonic

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
Johnny scale okay well this pentatonic

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:25.550 
Johnny scale okay well this pentatonic
scale<00:03:22.260> has<00:03:22.500> G<00:03:22.920> and<00:03:23.160> D<00:03:23.220> in<00:03:23.549> it<00:03:23.870> there<00:03:24.870> are<00:03:25.200> three

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
scale has G and D in it there are three

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.830 
scale has G and D in it there are three
others<00:03:25.950> that<00:03:26.160> have<00:03:26.280> gia<00:03:26.519> dinh<00:03:26.850> it<00:03:27.090> since<00:03:27.390> no<00:03:27.600> DS

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
others that have gia dinh it since no DS

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.570 
others that have gia dinh it since no DS
and<00:03:28.049> E's<00:03:28.170> account<00:03:28.500> for<00:03:28.680> four<00:03:28.920> out<00:03:29.100> of<00:03:29.130> my<00:03:29.340> five

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
and E's account for four out of my five

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.150 
and E's account for four out of my five
strings<00:03:30.000> and<00:03:30.299> I<00:03:30.959> can<00:03:31.170> use<00:03:31.290> them<00:03:31.530> a<00:03:31.650> lot<00:03:31.680> agree

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
strings and I can use them a lot agree

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.130 
strings and I can use them a lot agree
but<00:03:32.790> then<00:03:32.970> those<00:03:33.180> scales<00:03:33.600> should<00:03:33.840> be<00:03:33.959> pretty

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
but then those scales should be pretty

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.500 
but then those scales should be pretty
six<00:03:34.500> I<00:03:34.620> don't<00:03:34.799> have<00:03:34.920> to<00:03:35.040> fret<00:03:35.220> 3<00:03:35.459> notes<00:03:35.760> out<00:03:36.299> of
