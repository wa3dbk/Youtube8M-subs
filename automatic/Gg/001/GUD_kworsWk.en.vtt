00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.370
 because the lodge for two fundamental reasons the first because the 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.460
 market demand biotechnologists and preparations which is to multiply their 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:17.320
 options 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.900
 the professional the world d 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.760
 the work is complicated but the biotechnology sector will have many 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:23.839
 possibilities 

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:28.739
 and another fundamental reason this goes beyond enjoying a lot studying the premier and 

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:31.289
 because the technology the European nbch of madrid 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.679
 because here we train professionals exactly in what becomes physical 

00:00:35.679 --> 00:00:40.350
 first of all you will have an excellent scientific education 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.999
 highly qualified professionals who combine 

00:00:43.999 --> 00:00:45.289
 his teaching activity 

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:46.559
 with your activity 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.140
 between sanctions that such as in pharmaceutical companies or could 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.269
 technological secondly osterling action focused on the company gives us a 

00:00:56.269 --> 00:00:59.429
 added value for both their curriculum and here they have been incorporated 

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:00.890
 from the first course 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.409
 subjects in this one for her 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:06.780
 as for the practice of fighting in the fight without companies in the last 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.240
 year gratification 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.070
 plus 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.210
 our international approach has also been with high added value 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.470
 because internationality is a very important aspect in 

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:20.630
 the sector from the beginning we have some natura in English 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.540
 every year 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.439
 i also encourage until almost international 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:26.230
 hilda 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:29.530
 so the exchanges with other universities outside of Spain 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:30.880
 the goal is to work 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.280
 in many sectors from the pharmaceutical sector orio doctor in 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.530
 text and the environmental clinician will have food because there is little 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.970
 quality biotechnology uses the processes of living beings 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.090
 to synthesize a multitude of products with many applications 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:47.490
 practically 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.759
 in any case it weighs and within these organizations you can work not 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:57.229
 only in R &amp; D if not by a hundred developing other pipelines 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:00.750
 patents and also with a little experience you can create your own 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.080
 company from a scientific project if what you like most about 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.149
 health if you have high aspirations 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.359
 I recommend the pharmacy governor technology

 in just six years for having his titles the fifth year he looks 

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:16.319
 song and with another year will also be like that or technologist and in this way

 when investigating in new treatments products 

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:30.869
 goodbye gnostics and not the materials and the sector is growing in a way 

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:35.299
