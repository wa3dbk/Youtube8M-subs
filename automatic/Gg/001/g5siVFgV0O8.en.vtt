I'm thinking if I was to get these
panels<00:02:45.860> down<00:02:46.400> because<00:02:47.300> the<00:02:47.390> glass<00:02:47.600> is<00:02:47.630> still

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
panels down because the glass is still

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.780 
panels down because the glass is still
there<00:02:48.230> how<00:02:48.470> does<00:02:48.530> it<00:02:48.680> get<00:02:48.770> those<00:02:48.950> that<00:02:49.430> down<00:02:49.760> I

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
there how does it get those that down I

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.690 
there how does it get those that down I
might<00:02:50.120> let<00:02:50.959> a<00:02:51.020> little<00:02:51.290> bit<00:02:51.530> more<00:02:51.709> light<00:02:51.920> into

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
might let a little bit more light into

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.250 
might let a little bit more light into
the<00:02:52.790> back<00:02:53.000> there<00:02:53.330> you<00:02:53.630> know<00:02:53.720> during<00:02:53.900> the<00:02:54.050> day
