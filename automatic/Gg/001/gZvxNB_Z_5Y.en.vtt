shallower and easier to cross and it

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:21.850 
shallower and easier to cross and it
should<00:01:20.600> put<00:01:20.780> me<00:01:20.899> above<00:01:21.020> most<00:01:21.259> of<00:01:21.500> the<00:01:21.560> brush

attack<00:01:24.229> River<00:01:24.560> I'd<00:01:24.950> follow<00:01:25.220> the<00:01:25.429> river<00:01:25.640> shown

journey<00:01:28.729> would<00:01:28.970> be<00:01:29.060> impossible<00:01:29.330> so<00:01:29.720> my

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:30.049 
journey would be impossible so my

journey would be impossible so my
winding<00:01:30.440> route<00:01:30.649> would<00:01:30.799> likely<00:01:31.009> be<00:01:31.250> about<00:01:31.520> a

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:31.580 
winding route would likely be about a

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.630 
winding route would likely be about a
thousand<00:01:32.119> miles<00:01:33.280> here's<00:01:34.280> some<00:01:34.490> highlights
