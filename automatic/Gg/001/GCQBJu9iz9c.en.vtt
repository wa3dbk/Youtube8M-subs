00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 hello and welcome to digi school I 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:04.380
 am manuela was worth it your teacher 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.060
 geography 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.120
 today we will see the second 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.980
 video about France in town and 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.170
 its second part is called the city 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:23.039
 between social inequalities and 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:24.390
 spatial discontinuities you have under 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.970
 eyes now a map 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.470
 a diagram that shows you the situation 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:34.020
 theoretical of cities you find that 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:36.809
 the red corresponds to the urban centers 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.120
 dense and to the suburbs yellow that 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.100
 corresponds to the peri-urbanization of 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.629
 spaces of populations that are a lot 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.940
 less dense while the city center 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.620
 is much denser 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.420
 Then you can see that there are 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.879
 dynamics of social distribution and 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.760
 functional in urban space on 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.890
 the spaces more located in the suburbs on 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.100
 see a presence of all that is 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.660
 related to industrial activities is 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.510
 rather in the city centers 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.049
 the location of services such as 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.479
 businesses but also administrations 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:11.220
 there is also a break at the level of 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.590
 sociological in the centers in the 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.750
 cities indeed the city centers are 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.210
 much richer in terms of 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.790
 of population while the suburbs 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:25.140
 welcomes a larger population 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.340
 precarious finally we see that 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.840
 outside cities 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.580
 we're really going to have more spaces 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.590
 turned to nature spaces 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.420
 rural spaces that can be 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.229
 sometimes protected as you can 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.369
 find here in relation to the scheme is 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:39.990
 also a desire today to 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.729
 preserve these rural spaces by 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.310
 proximity to cities what is 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.990
 necessary to retain in relation to 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.729
 urban spaces that's all going 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.290
 first notion of commuter mobility 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.210
 of the son of the sprawl of the cities the 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.740
 urban dwellers need to get 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.810
 move especially to go to 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.130
 work so on entry schedules 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.479
 and out of work there is 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.280
 a lot of people in the 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.860
 transport whether public transport 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.259
 or individual transport we also have the 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.660
 concept of urban congestion the centers 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.399
 cities are very very dense so a 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.330
 congestion in terms of habitat but 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.700
 also activities 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.370
 we also have the notion of segregation 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.410
 spatial and social so a separation 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.239
 between the rather wealthy neighborhoods and 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.190
 poorer neighborhoods but also at 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:21.570
 level of economic activities 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.130
 downtown will be rather turned towards 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.330
 services and peripheries earlier 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.660
 to turn to activities 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:30.060
 industrial and so all that leads 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.310
 like and to the notion of urban sprawl 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.470
 cities are becoming more 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.000
 spaces on the territory so you 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.590
 could see that cities today 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.480
 occupy more and more spaces 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.220
 they are not territories 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.590
 homogeneous from a spatial point of view and 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.299
 economic but also social I you 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.470
 thanks for watching this video and I 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:48.470
 see you soon on school 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:56.770
