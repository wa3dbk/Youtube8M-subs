00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
character as you can see on his left

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.029 
character as you can see on his left
side<00:00:45.180> he<00:00:45.629> has<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.960> special<00:00:46.320> I'm<00:00:46.649> looking<00:00:46.980> at

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
side he has the special I'm looking at

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.060 
side he has the special I'm looking at
the<00:00:47.190> special<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.910> fear<00:00:48.270> III<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.230> bleed<00:00:49.620> -

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
the special the fear III and the bleed -

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.689 
the special the fear III and the bleed -
so<00:00:50.850> fury<00:00:51.149> 3<00:00:51.570> is<00:00:51.780> nice<00:00:52.199> and<00:00:52.590> bleeding<00:00:53.190> is<00:00:53.309> also

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
so fury 3 is nice and bleeding is also

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.360 
so fury 3 is nice and bleeding is also
good<00:00:53.969> especially<00:00:54.420> it<00:00:55.050> ignores<00:00:55.559> defense<00:00:56.129> and

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
good especially it ignores defense and

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.810 
good especially it ignores defense and
things<00:00:56.520> like<00:00:56.699> that<00:00:56.910> but<00:00:57.239> that<00:00:57.809> is<00:00:58.020> if<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.590> get

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
things like that but that is if you get

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.319 
things like that but that is if you get
the<00:00:59.820> fury<00:01:00.210> or<00:01:00.570> bleed<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.410> activate<00:01:02.070> I<00:01:02.340> think

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
the fury or bleed to activate I think

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.969 
the fury or bleed to activate I think
there's<00:01:03.480> a<00:01:03.570> really<00:01:03.809> low<00:01:03.989> percent<00:01:04.409> chance<00:01:04.680> 9

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
there's a really low percent chance 9

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.359 
there's a really low percent chance 9
percent<00:01:05.430> chance<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:06.350> then<00:01:07.350> there's<00:01:07.590> 23

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
percent chance and then there's 23

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.030 
percent chance and then there's 23
percent<00:01:08.820> 100<00:01:09.299> percent<00:01:09.330> chance<00:01:10.049> inflict<00:01:10.619> bleed

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
percent 100 percent chance inflict bleed

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.109 
percent 100 percent chance inflict bleed

last one which I call the super is the
destroyer<00:01:24.720> let's<00:01:25.080> go<00:01:25.229> in<00:01:25.380> here<00:01:25.710> there<00:01:26.369> it<00:01:26.490> is

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
destroyer let's go in here there it is

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.890 
destroyer let's go in here there it is
if<00:01:26.820> you're<00:01:26.939> wondering<00:01:27.330> what<00:01:27.509> it<00:01:27.659> says<00:01:28.340> and<00:01:29.900> the

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
if you're wondering what it says and the

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.319 
if you're wondering what it says and the
second<00:01:31.350> move<00:01:31.500> it<00:01:31.680> has<00:01:31.829> a<00:01:31.860> 23<00:01:32.579> percent<00:01:32.790> chance

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
second move it has a 23 percent chance

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.289 
second move it has a 23 percent chance
to<00:01:33.509> inflict<00:01:33.840> bleed<00:01:34.490> so<00:01:35.490> I<00:01:35.549> guess<00:01:35.729> that's<00:01:35.970> good

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
to inflict bleed so I guess that's good

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.200 
to inflict bleed so I guess that's good
and<00:01:37.290> while<00:01:37.650> I<00:01:37.680> guess<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.130> super<00:01:38.670> attack<00:01:38.970> has

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
and while I guess the super attack has

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.480 
and while I guess the super attack has
100<00:01:39.780> percent<00:01:39.900> inflict<00:01:40.650> bleed<00:01:40.979> that's<00:01:41.250> even

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
100 percent inflict bleed that's even

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.389 
100 percent inflict bleed that's even
better<00:01:41.540> alright<00:01:42.540> so<00:01:42.810> going<00:01:43.020> in<00:01:43.409> here<00:01:43.829> now
