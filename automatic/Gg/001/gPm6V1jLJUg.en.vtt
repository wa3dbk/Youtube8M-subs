00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.910
 it was iniesta I think it should 

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:05.210
 from the point of view of the best players in the world not at least not 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.249
 you are considered to be a national or be Spanish 

00:00:08.249 --> 00:00:12.039
 because we have n in the eternal rival but I think it is a great 

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:13.639
 noble player 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:17.130
 that has been making a difference for a long time or going to a team like 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.230
 barcelona I think it's very difficult to do 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.050
 what he is doing not and he is a player who technically has a 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.919
 extraordinary quality he has speed has mourning in the last 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:30.640
 I think it does not have almost everything 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.480
 I will not be nice it will be 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.890
 the special he 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.890
 the classic is a very match 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:43.300
 of many emotions per hundred what surrounds that party with the xerez is 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.220
 spectacular 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.570
 hirvonen we do not know to see what happens we try to do things right 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.199
 in front of us 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.930
 a very good team 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.330
 but but good 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:01.230
 I do not think that is to say what the league decides is in that game 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.240
 We will try to win it because then it means a lot 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.930
 my name in the first place for the difference of points of 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.120
 in which they take us in this case one that I think I can mark is not 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.329
 administer inference that kara separates us throughout the season 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.480
 when the league ends even 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.600
 he can define the championship as it happened to us with the league before capel or not that the 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:26.570
 Victory of 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.100
 The barcelona did not work 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.720
 to conclude to conquer the title not and this type of party 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.470
 ea apart from that you mark efe for all the fans and and for all the madridismo 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:41.760
 the year not the tranquility that dollars earned him 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.350
 to Barcelona they can see was because they have their reward 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.470
 well I think 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:48.760
 that they are 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.290
 trying 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.680
 find your your game before have brought 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.050
 many new soles players 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.060
 undoubtedly of a very good quality 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.670
 they have very important 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.170
 but but not 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.450
 It is not easy to win matches 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.940
 And we tried to maintain 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:14.909
 or in the line of last year and in improving it 

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:18.469
 an advantage of two goals against which are players that he 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:22.299
 who have been working together for a long time, they know each other perfectly 

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:26.749
 have also had the luck of the reward to have achieved a 

00:02:26.749 --> 00:02:30.799
 triplet I do not tell you it does not get title after it seems that everything must 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:34.559
 it's easier not but in the difference I think that each team has a 

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:38.989
 style is not different us maybe if it is true that it was coming out year 

00:02:39.529 --> 00:02:42.529
 at an offensive level in the management of counterattacks 

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:56.249
 but good 

00:02:56.249 --> 00:02:58.149
 in any case 

00:02:58.149 --> 00:03:01.079
 my mother has players for 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:03.419
 to win games for 

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:06.479
 to play very fast to play against 

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:09.589
 and that you block us to show on 

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:11.539
 homophobic 

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:13.150
 good thing you have 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.150
 signings of right of alonso de kakÃ¡ 

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:18.160
 red adeje 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.869
 barn believes that they can give 

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:22.099
 also s 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:23.079
 that game 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:26.129
 what happens is that it is not easy to find a 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:27.600
 a line and 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.669
 and maybe that line 

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:33.829
 in which the one that we have but not only this year but that the barza 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:35.919
 he has always maintained a 

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:38.809
 a philosophy and a style of play 

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:44.299
 rommel mixed and with a new signing nooo who have taken the group 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.510
 there is a new system to go there still a lot of thing that I keep proving that 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.319
 the coach so much the positioning system in tactical I think that 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:56.320
 let's go modifying things so we hope 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.939
 create a suitable profile for this new real madrid no but 

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:02.620
 Now I think that I would not know how to say a 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.579
 concrete question as maybe we have good equipment not us 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:10.429
 we are still trying things to try to revive how to coexist 

00:04:10.429 --> 00:04:14.959
 Once we find what we want we will try to ed 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:17.819
 emphasis not ns in that style 

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:20.789
 no room d 

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:22.880
 as in all of them but well 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.400
 in the end 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.220
 one goes to the field to at home the best that to float to have fun 

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:31.750
 and try to win 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.300
 will try to win and eto'o porte because it is a match 

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:38.069
 special ei 

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:40.770
 and good is a match of that central 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:42.479
 two of the teams 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:44.279
 nothing more important 

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:47.610
 What are all the players? 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.289
 a joy not only for 

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:52.559
 for the one who faces them and not for 

00:04:52.559 --> 00:04:55.309
 to the show that after all football is that
