this will only take half I have to do

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.759 
this will only take half I have to do
this<00:02:48.190> twice<00:02:48.519> and<00:02:48.819> so<00:02:48.909> what<00:02:49.060> I<00:02:49.090> do<00:02:49.470> is<00:02:50.470> we

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
this twice and so what I do is we

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:54.900 
this twice and so what I do is we
actually<00:02:50.980> just<00:02:51.489> pretty<00:02:51.730> much<00:02:51.909> drink<00:02:53.760> one<00:02:54.760> of

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
actually just pretty much drink one of

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.640 
actually just pretty much drink one of
the<00:02:55.000> batches<00:02:55.480> probably<00:02:56.049> I'll<00:02:56.170> save<00:02:56.470> the

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
the batches probably I'll save the

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.199 
the batches probably I'll save the
second<00:02:57.040> batch<00:02:57.220> that'll<00:02:57.640> be<00:02:57.700> enough<00:02:57.940> for<00:02:58.150> all

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
second batch that'll be enough for all

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:00.780 
second batch that'll be enough for all
of<00:02:58.480> us<00:02:58.660> have<00:02:59.590> our<00:02:59.769> first<00:03:00.010> dose<00:03:00.280> of<00:03:00.430> this<00:03:00.609> and

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
of us have our first dose of this and

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.849 
of us have our first dose of this and
now<00:03:00.879> I<00:03:00.910> like<00:03:01.299> doing<00:03:01.690> small<00:03:02.019> batches<00:03:02.290> because<00:03:02.739> I

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:02.859 
now I like doing small batches because I

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:03.780 
now I like doing small batches because I
want<00:03:03.040> it<00:03:03.099> fresh

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
want it fresh

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.699 
want it fresh
so<00:03:04.660> I'm<00:03:04.720> just<00:03:04.900> going<00:03:05.049> to<00:03:05.109> turn<00:03:05.319> that<00:03:05.470> on<00:03:05.530> and

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
so I'm just going to turn that on and

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:07.640 
so I'm just going to turn that on and
then<00:03:05.980> I'm<00:03:06.099> going<00:03:06.280> to<00:03:06.340> run<00:03:06.519> run<00:03:06.879> it<00:03:07.000> five<00:03:07.239> times

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
then I'm going to run run it five times

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.869 
then I'm going to run run it five times
to<00:03:08.650> make<00:03:08.829> sure<00:03:09.010> it<00:03:09.129> all<00:03:09.250> gets<00:03:09.579> nice<00:03:09.849> and

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:09.879 
to make sure it all gets nice and

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:14.759 
to make sure it all gets nice and
combined<00:03:10.209> so<00:03:10.569> this<00:03:10.690> is<00:03:11.250> the<00:03:12.250> fats<00:03:13.200> from<00:03:14.200> de<00:03:14.560> les

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
combined so this is the fats from de les

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:19.949 
combined so this is the fats from de les
yourson<00:03:15.209> combining<00:03:16.209> with<00:03:16.420> the<00:03:16.659> vitamin<00:03:17.440> C<00:03:18.959> so

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
yourson combining with the vitamin C so

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:23.069 
yourson combining with the vitamin C so
okay<00:03:20.739> so<00:03:20.799> I<00:03:21.040> use<00:03:21.430> glass<00:03:21.819> a<00:03:22.120> glass<00:03:22.150> straw<00:03:22.750> to

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:23.079 
okay so I use glass a glass straw to

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:26.150 
okay so I use glass a glass straw to
stir<00:03:23.379> this<00:03:23.560> and<00:03:23.980> you<00:03:24.099> want<00:03:24.340> to<00:03:24.489> stir<00:03:24.790> it

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
stir this and you want to stir it

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:32.339 
stir this and you want to stir it
frequently<00:03:27.160> while<00:03:27.700> it's<00:03:27.910> doing<00:03:28.209> this<00:03:31.079> so<00:03:32.079> and

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:32.349 
frequently while it's doing this so and

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:35.280 
frequently while it's doing this so and
you<00:03:32.440> don't<00:03:32.650> want<00:03:32.859> to<00:03:32.950> use<00:03:33.220> a<00:03:33.930> metal<00:03:34.930> you<00:03:35.109> want

you don't want to use a metal you want
to<00:03:35.349> either<00:03:35.470> use<00:03:35.799> glass<00:03:36.519> or<00:03:37.000> wood<00:03:37.540> you<00:03:38.139> have<00:03:38.230> a

to either use glass or wood you have a
wood<00:03:38.560> spoon<00:03:38.859> okay<00:03:39.430> so<00:03:39.669> it<00:03:39.940> has<00:03:39.970> stopped<00:03:40.450> so

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
wood spoon okay so it has stopped so

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:41.699

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:44.919 
on again and we're going to give it a

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:47.819 
on again and we're going to give it a
stir<00:03:45.450> and<00:03:46.450> while<00:03:46.989> I'm<00:03:47.079> getting<00:03:47.200> that<00:03:47.500> I<00:03:47.560> can

loss<00:04:23.470> of<00:04:23.680> mental<00:04:23.949> acuity<00:04:24.210> so<00:04:25.210> that's<00:04:25.330> a<00:04:25.449> huge

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
loss of mental acuity so that's a huge

fact<00:04:26.710> about<00:04:27.010> it<00:04:27.220> when<00:04:28.210> you<00:04:28.360> take<00:04:28.659> a<00:04:28.900> pill<00:04:29.289> of

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
fact about it when you take a pill of

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.320 
fact about it when you take a pill of
vitamin<00:04:30.010> C<00:04:30.310> your

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
vitamin C your

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.809 
vitamin C your
usually<00:04:31.569> only<00:04:31.750> absorbing<00:04:32.710> about<00:04:32.949> 20%<00:04:33.639> of<00:04:33.759> that

00:04:33.809 --> 00:04:33.819 
usually only absorbing about 20% of that

00:04:33.819 --> 00:04:37.260 
usually only absorbing about 20% of that
pill<00:04:34.210> because<00:04:34.629> and<00:04:35.409> it<00:04:36.310> attracts<00:04:36.669> water<00:04:36.819> and

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
pill because and it attracts water and

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.059 
pill because and it attracts water and
losses<00:04:37.569> in<00:04:37.659> your<00:04:37.780> bowels<00:04:38.110> and<00:04:38.289> so<00:04:38.770> you're<00:04:38.949> only

00:04:39.059 --> 00:04:39.069 
losses in your bowels and so you're only

00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:43.219 
losses in your bowels and so you're only
able<00:04:39.699> to<00:04:40.090> absorb<00:04:40.509> on<00:04:40.810> 20%<00:04:41.680> during<00:04:42.159> that<00:04:42.310> time

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:43.229 
able to absorb on 20% during that time

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:46.649 
able to absorb on 20% during that time
with<00:04:44.229> liposomal<00:04:45.039> vitamin<00:04:45.189> C<00:04:46.030> depending<00:04:46.539> on

00:04:46.649 --> 00:04:46.659 
with liposomal vitamin C depending on

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:48.629 
with liposomal vitamin C depending on
what<00:04:46.870> you<00:04:46.990> read<00:04:47.259> the<00:04:47.889> absorption<00:04:48.400> rate<00:04:48.610> is

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:48.639 
what you read the absorption rate is

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:50.969 
what you read the absorption rate is
around<00:04:48.939> 85<00:04:49.509> to<00:04:49.539> 95<00:04:50.289> percent<00:04:50.319> so<00:04:50.860> that's

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:50.979 
around 85 to 95 percent so that's

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:54.390 
around 85 to 95 percent so that's
comparable<00:04:51.669> to<00:04:51.849> a<00:04:51.879> vitamin<00:04:52.240> C<00:04:52.689> IV<00:04:53.039> so<00:04:54.039> you<00:04:54.159> can

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 
comparable to a vitamin C IV so you can

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.800 
comparable to a vitamin C IV so you can
make<00:04:54.550> this<00:04:54.699> in<00:04:54.879> your<00:04:54.909> home<00:04:55.210> and<00:04:57.270> basically<00:04:58.270> get

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
make this in your home and basically get

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.670 
make this in your home and basically get

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 
a vitamin C IV dose of vitamin C and

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.100 
a vitamin C IV dose of vitamin C and
you're<00:05:03.280> getting<00:05:03.400> the<00:05:03.669> wonderful

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:06.520 
phosphatidylcholine with it that you

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.779 
phosphatidylcholine with it that you
would<00:05:06.699> not<00:05:06.849> get<00:05:07.090> an<00:05:07.210> IV<00:05:07.389> so

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:08.789 
would not get an IV so

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:11.010 
would not get an IV so
phosphatidylcholine<00:05:09.789> is<00:05:10.240> an<00:05:10.449> integral

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:39.080 
little air space as possible and to make

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:42.839
