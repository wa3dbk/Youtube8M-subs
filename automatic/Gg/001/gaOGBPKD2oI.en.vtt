did this way just to just to release the

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:45.520 
did this way just to just to release the
pressure<00:00:43.670> on<00:00:43.850> evenly<00:00:44.329> so<00:00:44.629> there's<00:00:44.809> no<00:00:45.019> stress

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
pressure on evenly so there's no stress

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.680 
pressure on evenly so there's no stress
or<00:00:45.739> no<00:00:45.920> twisting<00:00:46.489> with<00:00:46.969> one<00:00:47.210> side<00:00:47.480> being

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
or no twisting with one side being

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.270 
or no twisting with one side being
tightened<00:00:48.109> yet<00:00:48.260> while<00:00:48.440> not<00:00:48.589> being<00:00:48.739> tired<00:00:49.039> so

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
tightened yet while not being tired so

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.490 
tightened yet while not being tired so
this<00:00:49.519> was<00:00:49.640> my<00:00:49.789> method<00:00:50.210> and<00:00:50.420> this<00:00:51.170> what<00:00:51.320> worked

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 
this was my method and this what worked

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:57.939 
this was my method and this what worked
best<00:00:51.589> for<00:00:51.769> me<00:00:55.989> now<00:00:56.989> the<00:00:57.050> next<00:00:57.320> thing<00:00:57.410> to<00:00:57.559> do<00:00:57.679> was

00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:57.949 
best for me now the next thing to do was

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:00.790 
best for me now the next thing to do was
to<00:00:58.100> remove<00:00:58.309> the<00:00:58.460> timing<00:00:59.030> cover<00:00:59.359> itself<00:00:59.960> this

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
to remove the timing cover itself this

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.500 
to remove the timing cover itself this
is<00:01:00.859> the<00:01:00.980> time<00:01:01.249> about<00:01:01.370> covers<00:01:01.850> got<00:01:01.999> two<00:01:02.239> little

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
is the time about covers got two little

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.030 
is the time about covers got two little
fish<00:01:02.749> can't<00:01:03.109> see<00:01:03.170> one<00:01:03.440> there<00:01:03.710> but<00:01:03.859> you<00:01:03.920> could

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
fish can't see one there but you could

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.250 
fish can't see one there but you could
just<00:01:04.220> better<00:01:04.430> see<00:01:04.670> it<00:01:04.790> once<00:01:05.659> you<00:01:05.780> get<00:01:05.930> that<00:01:06.050> off

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 
just better see it once you get that off

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:07.990 
just better see it once you get that off
he<00:01:06.470> allows<00:01:06.680> you<00:01:06.830> full<00:01:07.100> access<00:01:07.250> to<00:01:07.520> the<00:01:07.790> actual

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
he allows you full access to the actual

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.720 
he allows you full access to the actual
rocker<00:01:08.390> cover<00:01:08.750> itself<00:01:09.260> now<00:01:10.070> if<00:01:10.160> you<00:01:10.280> loosen<00:01:10.670> it

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:10.730 
rocker cover itself now if you loosen it

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.230 
rocker cover itself now if you loosen it
all<00:01:10.880> it<00:01:11.060> should<00:01:11.270> only<00:01:11.360> take<00:01:11.510> a<00:01:11.720> little<00:01:12.020> nudge

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
all it should only take a little nudge

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.810 
all it should only take a little nudge
make<00:01:14.240> sure<00:01:14.360> you<00:01:14.450> get<00:01:14.600> clearance<00:01:14.960> and<00:01:15.820> it

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
make sure you get clearance and it

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.520 
make sure you get clearance and it
should<00:01:16.940> slide<00:01:17.060> out<00:01:17.210> don't<00:01:17.990> take<00:01:18.170> off<00:01:18.350> that

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
should slide out don't take off that

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.200 
should slide out don't take off that
timing<00:01:18.980> belt<00:01:19.250> cover<00:01:19.430> it<00:01:19.670> does<00:01:19.790> make<00:01:20.000> a<00:01:20.030> lot

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
timing belt cover it does make a lot

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:21.970 
timing belt cover it does make a lot
more<00:01:20.390> tricky<00:01:20.750> so<00:01:20.960> much<00:01:21.320> done<00:01:21.560> that<00:01:21.740> should<00:01:21.920> you

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:21.980 
more tricky so much done that should you

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:27.060 
more tricky so much done that should you
find<00:01:24.100> it's<00:01:25.100> there<00:01:25.370> now<00:01:25.730> we<00:01:25.790> removed<00:01:26.330> the

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
find it's there now we removed the

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.640 
find it's there now we removed the
injector<00:01:28.070> Lube<00:01:28.550> itself<00:01:29.090> now<00:01:29.930> it<00:01:30.080> does<00:01:30.320> just

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 
injector Lube itself now it does just

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.160 
injector Lube itself now it does just
come<00:01:31.040> up<00:01:31.340> but<00:01:31.940> it<00:01:32.060> will<00:01:32.270> put<00:01:32.510> a<00:01:32.540> bit<00:01:32.780> of<00:01:32.840> a<00:01:32.900> fight

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
come up but it will put a bit of a fight

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:34.990 
come up but it will put a bit of a fight
the<00:01:33.350> clubs<00:01:33.590> be<00:01:33.770> sealed<00:01:34.130> in<00:01:34.340> there<00:01:34.580> isn't<00:01:34.940> my

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
the clubs be sealed in there isn't my

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.970 
the clubs be sealed in there isn't my
hot<00:01:35.180> engine<00:01:35.600> and<00:01:35.780> they<00:01:36.350> kind<00:01:36.620> of<00:01:36.740> fuse

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:36.980 
hot engine and they kind of fuse

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:38.050 
hot engine and they kind of fuse
together<00:01:37.160> with<00:01:37.580> the<00:01:37.670> oil<00:01:37.820> and<00:01:38.000> everything

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
together with the oil and everything

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.840 
together with the oil and everything
else<00:01:38.510> in<00:01:38.720> grease<00:01:38.960> so<00:01:39.620> the<00:01:39.890> idea<00:01:40.190> is<00:01:40.370> to<00:01:40.460> try<00:01:40.730> and

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
else in grease so the idea is to try and

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.170 
else in grease so the idea is to try and
kind<00:01:41.030> of<00:01:41.210> rock<00:01:41.570> them<00:01:41.840> side<00:01:42.170> to<00:01:42.410> side<00:01:42.790> I'm<00:01:43.790> sorry

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
kind of rock them side to side I'm sorry

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.970 
kind of rock them side to side I'm sorry
side<00:01:44.390> slowly<00:01:44.720> and<00:01:45.080> it<00:01:45.260> will<00:01:45.500> come<00:01:45.800> out

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:45.980 
side slowly and it will come out

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.070 
side slowly and it will come out
eventually<00:01:46.210> now<00:01:47.210> it's<00:01:47.570> important<00:01:47.930> to<00:01:47.960> be

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:48.080 
eventually now it's important to be

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.270 
eventually now it's important to be
careful<00:01:48.290> with<00:01:48.560> these<00:01:48.620> because<00:01:48.680> these<00:01:48.950> can

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
careful with these because these can

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.950 
careful with these because these can
come<00:01:49.490> brittle<00:01:49.910> the<00:01:50.120> heat<00:01:50.330> and<00:01:50.480> cause<00:01:50.780> you

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
come brittle the heat and cause you

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.140 
come brittle the heat and cause you
problems<00:01:51.230> later<00:01:51.530> on<00:01:51.680> so<00:01:52.280> try<00:01:52.730> and<00:01:52.940> be<00:01:53.060> as

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.150 
problems later on so try and be as

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:54.700 
problems later on so try and be as
delicate<00:01:53.570> as<00:01:53.630> possible<00:01:53.750> with<00:01:54.170> your<00:01:54.230> counties

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
delicate as possible with your counties

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.620 
delicate as possible with your counties
and<00:01:54.920> just<00:01:55.130> slowly<00:01:56.090> ease<00:01:56.540> them<00:01:56.870> up<00:01:58.480> I'm<00:01:59.480> gonna

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
and just slowly ease them up I'm gonna

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.380 
and just slowly ease them up I'm gonna
need<00:01:59.840> this<00:02:00.020> m10<00:02:00.890> spline<00:02:01.340> sake<00:02:01.880> you<00:02:02.030> can<00:02:02.180> buy

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
need this m10 spline sake you can buy

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.370 
need this m10 spline sake you can buy
them<00:02:02.600> on<00:02:02.750> eBay<00:02:03.170> or<00:02:03.440> from<00:02:03.800> my<00:02:03.920> website<00:02:04.340> and<00:02:05.380> next

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
them on eBay or from my website and next

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.359 
them on eBay or from my website and next
job<00:02:06.560> is<00:02:06.710> to<00:02:06.740> remove<00:02:07.340> this<00:02:07.820> rocker<00:02:08.750> the

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
job is to remove this rocker the

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:11.210 
job is to remove this rocker the
injector<00:02:10.369> rocker

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
injector rocker

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.430 
injector rocker
now<00:02:11.730> it's<00:02:12.030> going<00:02:12.180> to<00:02:12.270> be<00:02:12.390> a<00:02:12.420> bit<00:02:12.630> tough<00:02:13.110> here

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
now it's going to be a bit tough here

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.410 
now it's going to be a bit tough here
because<00:02:13.770> once<00:02:13.980> again<00:02:14.130> it<00:02:14.430> gets<00:02:14.610> hot<00:02:14.880> but<00:02:15.360> just

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
because once again it gets hot but just

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.840 
because once again it gets hot but just
be<00:02:15.660> careful<00:02:15.890> this<00:02:16.890> is<00:02:16.950> why<00:02:17.250> it's<00:02:17.400> important<00:02:17.790> to

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
be careful this is why it's important to

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.460 
be careful this is why it's important to
have<00:02:17.940> the<00:02:18.090> correct<00:02:18.300> tool<00:02:18.750> because<00:02:19.020> if<00:02:19.140> you<00:02:19.230> use

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
have the correct tool because if you use

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.380 
have the correct tool because if you use
a<00:02:19.500> torch<00:02:19.890> or<00:02:20.040> anything<00:02:20.220> else<00:02:20.490> it<00:02:20.760> will<00:02:20.970> spin

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
a torch or anything else it will spin

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.930 
a torch or anything else it will spin
them<00:02:21.630> out<00:02:21.840> so<00:02:22.500> like<00:02:23.040> I<00:02:23.190> did<00:02:23.400> much<00:02:23.580> with<00:02:23.790> the

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
them out so like I did much with the

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.140 
them out so like I did much with the
rocker<00:02:24.930> cover<00:02:25.320> itself<00:02:25.800> blue<00:02:26.520> sir<00:02:26.730> them<00:02:26.880> first

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
rocker cover itself blue sir them first

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.090 
rocker cover itself blue sir them first
and<00:02:27.480> get<00:02:28.200> to<00:02:28.440> a<00:02:28.470> stage<00:02:28.770> where<00:02:28.980> you<00:02:29.010> can

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
and get to a stage where you can

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.120 
and get to a stage where you can
actually<00:02:29.400> undo<00:02:29.850> them<00:02:30.000> by<00:02:30.150> hand<00:02:30.500> this<00:02:31.500> is<00:02:31.710> me

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
actually undo them by hand this is me

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.340 
actually undo them by hand this is me
this<00:02:32.280> is<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:32.490> safest<00:02:32.910> way<00:02:33.030> once<00:02:33.960> you<00:02:34.110> loosen

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
this is the safest way once you loosen

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.340 
this is the safest way once you loosen
it<00:02:34.560> up<00:02:34.740> carefully<00:02:35.700> raise<00:02:35.970> it<00:02:36.180> up<00:02:36.330> making<00:02:37.200> sure

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
it up carefully raise it up making sure

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:38.810 
it up carefully raise it up making sure
you<00:02:37.680> bring<00:02:37.830> all<00:02:38.010> the<00:02:38.100> screws<00:02:38.370> up<00:02:38.550> here<00:02:38.670> and

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
you bring all the screws up here and

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.750 
you bring all the screws up here and
nothing<00:02:39.060> falls<00:02:39.300> into<00:02:39.480> the<00:02:39.690> head<00:02:39.870> itself<00:02:40.760> onto

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
nothing falls into the head itself onto

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.510 
nothing falls into the head itself onto
the<00:02:42.150> similar<00:02:42.570> spline<00:02:42.900> talk<00:02:43.170> this<00:02:43.410> one's<00:02:43.680> an<00:02:43.860> m6

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
the similar spline talk this one's an m6

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.670 
the similar spline talk this one's an m6
now<00:02:45.270> you're<00:02:45.480> going<00:02:45.630> to<00:02:45.720> use<00:02:45.900> this<00:02:46.050> to<00:02:46.290> remove

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
now you're going to use this to remove

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.090 
now you're going to use this to remove
the<00:02:47.400> locator<00:02:47.970> the<00:02:48.510> injector<00:02:49.320> locator<00:02:49.740> this<00:02:50.010> is

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
the locator the injector locator this is

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.980 
the locator the injector locator this is
what<00:02:50.250> holds<00:02:50.610> the<00:02:50.760> injector<00:02:51.240> in<00:02:51.420> place<00:02:51.720> and

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
what holds the injector in place and

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:53.330 
what holds the injector in place and
secures<00:02:52.350> objector<00:02:52.740> in<00:02:52.830> place

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
secures objector in place

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.700 
secures objector in place
so<00:02:53.820> once<00:02:54.000> you've<00:02:54.150> removed<00:02:54.300> that<00:02:54.690> this<00:02:55.560> is

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:55.710 
so once you've removed that this is

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.580 
so once you've removed that this is
gonna<00:02:55.860> be<00:02:56.070> the<00:02:56.220> tricky<00:02:56.490> part<00:02:57.200> make<00:02:58.200> sure<00:02:58.410> the

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
gonna be the tricky part make sure the

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.920 
gonna be the tricky part make sure the
wires<00:02:58.800> are<00:02:58.920> out<00:02:59.160> the<00:02:59.310> way<00:02:59.460> now<00:02:59.700> just<00:03:00.690> try<00:03:00.870> and

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
wires are out the way now just try and

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.540 
wires are out the way now just try and
move<00:03:01.080> it<00:03:01.260> left<00:03:01.530> and<00:03:01.800> right<00:03:02.040> so<00:03:02.250> you<00:03:02.340> can

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
move it left and right so you can

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.000 
move it left and right so you can
actually<00:03:02.730> break<00:03:03.270> the<00:03:03.510> silk<00:03:03.810> once<00:03:04.680> you<00:03:04.830> get<00:03:04.980> a

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
actually break the silk once you get a

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.740 
actually break the silk once you get a
little<00:03:05.130> bit<00:03:05.340> movement<00:03:05.730> left<00:03:05.910> and<00:03:06.090> right<00:03:06.300> you

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
little bit movement left and right you

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.800 
little bit movement left and right you
can<00:03:06.930> start<00:03:07.430> easing<00:03:08.430> it<00:03:08.580> up<00:03:08.730> now<00:03:09.360> there<00:03:09.630> is<00:03:09.780> a

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
can start easing it up now there is a

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.750 
can start easing it up now there is a
special<00:03:10.020> tool<00:03:10.590> to<00:03:10.770> take<00:03:10.950> this<00:03:11.130> out<00:03:11.370> but<00:03:11.670> I

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
special tool to take this out but I

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.030 
special tool to take this out but I
didn't<00:03:12.120> have<00:03:12.240> one<00:03:12.510> so<00:03:13.080> I<00:03:13.110> just<00:03:13.410> tried<00:03:13.680> to<00:03:13.710> juice

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
didn't have one so I just tried to juice

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.220 
didn't have one so I just tried to juice
my<00:03:14.250> brain<00:03:14.550> and<00:03:14.820> try<00:03:15.420> and<00:03:15.540> make<00:03:15.630> something<00:03:15.900> work

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
my brain and try and make something work

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.830 
my brain and try and make something work
so<00:03:16.560> I've<00:03:16.680> got<00:03:16.830> a<00:03:16.860> bit<00:03:17.040> of<00:03:17.130> rope<00:03:17.390> and<00:03:18.390> I've

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
so I've got a bit of rope and I've

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.890 
so I've got a bit of rope and I've
wrapped<00:03:19.110> it<00:03:19.290> around<00:03:19.320> the<00:03:20.010> the<00:03:20.520> metal<00:03:21.300> base<00:03:21.660> of

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
wrapped it around the the metal base of

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.620 
wrapped it around the the metal base of
it<00:03:22.050> if<00:03:22.650> you<00:03:22.770> can<00:03:22.950> see<00:03:23.160> that<00:03:23.370> go<00:03:23.640> underneath<00:03:24.180> and

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
it if you can see that go underneath and

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.770 
it if you can see that go underneath and
repre<00:03:25.290> ground<00:03:25.500> a<00:03:25.590> metal<00:03:25.860> base<00:03:26.120> now<00:03:27.120> what<00:03:27.450> I<00:03:27.480> did

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
repre ground a metal base now what I did

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.229 
repre ground a metal base now what I did
was<00:03:27.989> is<00:03:28.230> I<00:03:28.350> just<00:03:28.410> put<00:03:29.130> a<00:03:29.160> little<00:03:29.370> bit<00:03:29.489> upward

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
was is I just put a little bit upward

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:33.290 
was is I just put a little bit upward
tension<00:03:30.750> on<00:03:30.900> the<00:03:31.560> injector<00:03:32.100> itself<00:03:32.550> there<00:03:33.270> is

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
tension on the injector itself there is

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.360 
tension on the injector itself there is
a<00:03:33.420> slide<00:03:33.810> hammer<00:03:34.050> tool<00:03:34.380> that<00:03:34.500> you<00:03:34.590> can<00:03:34.739> use<00:03:34.800> but

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
a slide hammer tool that you can use but

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.790 
a slide hammer tool that you can use but
this<00:03:36.030> is<00:03:36.209> what<00:03:36.360> I<00:03:36.390> had<00:03:36.750> available<00:03:36.870> I<00:03:37.440> didn't

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
this is what I had available I didn't

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.190 
this is what I had available I didn't
have<00:03:37.920> the<00:03:38.520> special<00:03:38.910> tool<00:03:39.150> now<00:03:39.450> once<00:03:39.989> that's

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
have the special tool now once that's

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.830 
have the special tool now once that's
got<00:03:40.410> a<00:03:40.440> little<00:03:40.500> bit<00:03:40.620> up<00:03:40.830> pressure<00:03:41.570> it<00:03:42.570> should

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
got a little bit up pressure it should

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.350 
got a little bit up pressure it should
only<00:03:43.050> take<00:03:43.290> a<00:03:43.860> few<00:03:44.370> little<00:03:44.580> Weeble<00:03:44.790> before<00:03:45.269> it

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
only take a few little Weeble before it

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.840 
only take a few little Weeble before it
comes<00:03:45.600> out<00:03:45.840> there<00:03:46.080> you<00:03:46.230> go<00:03:46.380> so<00:03:47.190> that's<00:03:47.370> how<00:03:47.580> my

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
comes out there you go so that's how my
