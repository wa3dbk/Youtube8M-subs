00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.309 
fail-safe to sell at a discounted price
okay<00:02:08.160> now<00:02:09.000> it<00:02:09.090> looks<00:02:09.270> like<00:02:09.420> you<00:02:09.720> roll<00:02:10.020> more

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
okay now it looks like you roll more

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.140 
okay now it looks like you roll more
dice<00:02:10.679> from<00:02:11.039> having<00:02:11.459> some<00:02:11.640> of<00:02:11.760> these<00:02:11.850> how<00:02:12.060> does

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
dice from having some of these how does

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.640 
dice from having some of these how does
that<00:02:12.270> work<00:02:12.540> out<00:02:12.750> how<00:02:13.110> do<00:02:13.170> you<00:02:13.230> get<00:02:13.380> more<00:02:13.590> of

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
that work out how do you get more of

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.970 
that work out how do you get more of
those<00:02:13.890> okay<00:02:14.430> so<00:02:14.489> the<00:02:14.850> way<00:02:14.970> it<00:02:15.000> works<00:02:15.120> is<00:02:15.480> that

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
those okay so the way it works is that

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.320 
those okay so the way it works is that
each<00:02:16.980> round<00:02:17.340> the<00:02:17.580> person<00:02:17.880> who<00:02:18.000> is<00:02:18.060> in<00:02:18.180> last

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
each round the person who is in last

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.090 
each round the person who is in last
place<00:02:18.480> is<00:02:18.810> going<00:02:18.989> to<00:02:19.019> choose<00:02:19.320> what<00:02:19.830> time

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
place is going to choose what time

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.710 
place is going to choose what time
they're<00:02:20.459> going<00:02:20.610> to<00:02:20.670> wake<00:02:20.820> up<00:02:21.030> okay<00:02:21.420> and<00:02:21.570> that's

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
they're going to wake up okay and that's

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.540 
they're going to wake up okay and that's
going<00:02:21.870> to<00:02:21.930> affect<00:02:22.290> turn<00:02:22.530> order<00:02:22.769> the<00:02:23.100> earlier

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
going to affect turn order the earlier

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.550 
going to affect turn order the earlier
the<00:02:23.580> wake<00:02:23.820> of<00:02:24.030> they<00:02:24.420> wake<00:02:24.600> up<00:02:24.780> yeah<00:02:25.350> exactly

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
the wake of they wake up yeah exactly

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.640 
the wake of they wake up yeah exactly
the<00:02:26.220> earlier<00:02:26.610> they<00:02:26.880> wake<00:02:27.090> up<00:02:27.300> the<00:02:28.290> sooner<00:02:28.530> that

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
the earlier they wake up the sooner that

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.440 
the earlier they wake up the sooner that
they<00:02:28.950> can<00:02:29.220> get<00:02:29.400> to<00:02:29.550> the<00:02:29.670> market<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.180> sooner

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
they can get to the market the sooner

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.240 
they can get to the market the sooner
they<00:02:30.569> can<00:02:30.600> sell<00:02:30.930> their<00:02:31.010> products<00:02:32.010> to<00:02:32.040> the

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
they can sell their products to the

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.070 
they can sell their products to the
customer<00:02:32.640> but<00:02:33.120> the<00:02:33.390> grumpy<00:02:33.720> oh<00:02:33.750> they're<00:02:33.930> going

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
customer but the grumpy oh they're going

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.870 
customer but the grumpy oh they're going
to<00:02:34.140> be<00:02:34.380> and<00:02:34.620> so<00:02:34.830> the<00:02:34.950> fewer<00:02:35.220> actions<00:02:35.700> you're

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
to be and so the fewer actions you're

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.059 
to be and so the fewer actions you're
going<00:02:36.030> to<00:02:36.090> get<00:02:36.269> for<00:02:36.540> it<00:02:36.569> the<00:02:37.230> later<00:02:37.500> you<00:02:37.860> sleep

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
going to get for it the later you sleep

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:39.830 
going to get for it the later you sleep
in<00:02:38.459> the<00:02:38.790> more<00:02:38.970> actions<00:02:39.150> you're<00:02:39.450> going<00:02:39.569> to<00:02:39.630> get

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
in the more actions you're going to get

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.570 
in the more actions you're going to get
but<00:02:40.290> you're<00:02:40.560> going<00:02:40.739> to<00:02:40.830> have<00:02:40.890> to<00:02:41.190> deal<00:02:41.370> with

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
but you're going to have to deal with

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.120 
but you're going to have to deal with
what's<00:02:41.880> left<00:02:42.260> with<00:02:43.260> what's<00:02:43.500> left<00:02:43.680> out<00:02:43.920> there

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
what's left with what's left out there

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.850 
what's left with what's left out there
so<00:02:44.310> the<00:02:44.790> way<00:02:44.940> you<00:02:44.970> get<00:02:45.390> more<00:02:45.600> dice<00:02:45.900> is<00:02:46.200> just<00:02:46.650> by

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
so the way you get more dice is just by

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.069 
so the way you get more dice is just by
the<00:02:47.700> more<00:02:47.880> actions<00:02:48.030> you<00:02:48.299> can<00:02:48.450> have<00:02:48.630> the<00:02:48.840> more

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:49.079 
the more actions you can have the more

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:51.800 
the more actions you can have the more
you<00:02:49.110> can<00:02:49.320> grab<00:02:50.220> it<00:02:50.250> so<00:02:50.790> taking<00:02:51.090> a<00:02:51.209> dye<00:02:51.450> is<00:02:51.510> in

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
you can grab it so taking a dye is in

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.900 
you can grab it so taking a dye is in
action<00:02:52.230> absolutely<00:02:52.860> yeah<00:02:53.010> taking<00:02:53.579> a<00:02:53.670> dye<00:02:53.850> is

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
action absolutely yeah taking a dye is

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.000 
action absolutely yeah taking a dye is
in<00:02:54.180> action<00:02:54.510> taking<00:02:54.930> the<00:02:55.049> water<00:02:55.260> element<00:02:55.500> is<00:02:55.860> an

action and refilling the distillery is
an<00:02:59.250> action<00:02:59.489> now<00:02:59.670> water<00:03:00.360> can<00:03:00.810> be<00:03:00.870> simply<00:03:01.590> points

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.760 
spend more
them<00:03:10.560> to<00:03:11.010> turn<00:03:11.310> a<00:03:11.670> fail<00:03:12.030> into<00:03:12.540> a<00:03:12.570> success<00:03:13.050> okay

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
them to turn a fail into a success okay

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.100 
them to turn a fail into a success okay
directly<00:03:14.520> so<00:03:14.850> it's<00:03:15.150> kind<00:03:15.390> of<00:03:15.450> like<00:03:15.570> a<00:03:15.780> push<00:03:15.990> and

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
directly so it's kind of like a push and

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.450 
directly so it's kind of like a push and
pull<00:03:16.290> as<00:03:16.440> to<00:03:16.590> whether<00:03:16.770> it's<00:03:16.980> worth<00:03:17.160> it<00:03:17.310> to<00:03:17.340> you

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:17.460 
pull as to whether it's worth it to you

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.130 
pull as to whether it's worth it to you
for<00:03:17.580> the<00:03:17.700> points<00:03:17.940> at<00:03:18.030> the<00:03:18.060> end<00:03:18.150> of<00:03:18.420> the<00:03:18.630> or

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
for the points at the end of the or

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.720 
for the points at the end of the or
whether<00:03:19.530> it<00:03:19.710> makes<00:03:19.860> more<00:03:20.040> sense<00:03:20.100> to

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
whether it makes more sense to

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.460 
whether it makes more sense to
manipulate<00:03:21.360> the<00:03:21.480> dice<00:03:21.630> and<00:03:21.660> get<00:03:22.050> your<00:03:22.200> points

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.890 
manipulate the dice and get your points
by<00:03:22.620> self<00:03:23.010> they're<00:03:23.880> nice<00:03:24.090> and<00:03:24.270> when<00:03:24.660> would<00:03:24.780> the

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
by self they're nice and when would the

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.840 
by self they're nice and when would the
game<00:03:25.020> be<00:03:25.080> over<00:03:25.290> do<00:03:25.680> we<00:03:25.800> have<00:03:25.830> to<00:03:26.460> run<00:03:26.610> out<00:03:26.820> the

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
game be over do we have to run out the

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.600 
game be over do we have to run out the
customers<00:03:27.540> not<00:03:28.110> completely<00:03:28.740> so<00:03:29.040> there<00:03:29.340> is<00:03:29.460> an

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
customers not completely so there is an
