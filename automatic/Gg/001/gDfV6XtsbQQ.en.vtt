00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.340
 I propose to work on a 

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.799
 other support on another set of table 

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:09.020
 white cotton we will do this bayadère 

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:12.920
 very simple to make and then we 

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:15.230
 will add a little stencil effect so 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.900
 first thing we're going to work on a 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.910
 support that will have been the bay we go 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.160
 at first realize the bayer 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:27.920
 of air with the colors it is to kohler 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:31.940
 opaque moire colors here we go 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:34.280
 apply to the foam roller and we will 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.679
 define the khaled bias of adhesives 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.109
 of different widths 

00:00:35.679 --> 00:00:41.659
 then when the bayadère will be dry on 

00:00:39.109 --> 00:00:44.659
 will come applied with the brush 

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:48.469
 stencils and the last stencil 

00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:50.809
 finish with black plum color and 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:53.659
 at first I will prepare 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:56.690
 my bayadère with adhesives from 

00:00:53.659 --> 00:01:01.809
 different widths by placing 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.809
 vertical well parallel to butter 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:20.329
 I check well that my scotch to say 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:25.430
 well before using my color well 

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:28.310
 I sure stirs and I place the center 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.740
 of the plate it is important to use 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:34.039
 a roll in the foam and well dry 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:36.049
 especially no water in the foam 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:40.189
 then you see I'm going to take the 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:44.530
 color all around love actually 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:44.530
 adhesives only serve as stencils 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:58.590
 here I can wash my roll with water 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.979
 always and then I withdraw all 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.979
 adhesives 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.350
 now I'm waiting for the drying of 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.980
 colors before applying to the stencil the 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.960
 last color purple 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.930
 so I take a little more 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:33.690
 nothing and using adhesives I'm going 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:34.830
 hide nor motive I do not want I 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.900
 will stop here 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:43.980
 this is a very dry choice soap especially 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:46.110
 well dry starts next I go there the 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.390
 color becomes opaque when dry 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.430
 initially it may seem small 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.680
 transparent and the opaque side comes in 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.230
 drying the realization is over I have 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.870
 more than just letting it dry and ironing 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:00.690
 the reverse cotton position for fixing 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:05.780
 colors then I use it for 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.780
 lover washing machine without worry
