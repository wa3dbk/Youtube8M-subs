00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
percent there was nothing left he still

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.179 
percent there was nothing left he still
had<00:01:59.310> thirty<00:01:59.729> percent<00:02:00.180> of<00:02:00.359> his<00:02:00.479> strength<00:02:00.780> and

had thirty percent of his strength and
thirty<00:02:02.189> thirty<00:02:02.670> percent<00:02:03.119> of<00:02:03.359> bills<00:02:03.570> his<00:02:03.689> power

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
thirty thirty percent of bills his power

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.649 
thirty thirty percent of bills his power
is<00:02:04.049> more<00:02:04.560> than<00:02:04.649> enough<00:02:04.859> to<00:02:05.009> blow<00:02:05.219> up<00:02:05.310> a<00:02:05.399> planet

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
is more than enough to blow up a planet

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:09.830 
is more than enough to blow up a planet
believe<00:02:06.659> me<00:02:06.780> guys<00:02:06.899> mean<00:02:07.259> bills<00:02:08.450> what<00:02:09.450> he<00:02:09.630> needs

believe me guys mean bills what he needs

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.440 
believe me guys mean bills what he needs
to<00:02:09.929> do<00:02:10.140> is<00:02:10.289> go<00:02:10.799> up<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.430> planet<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:11.940> earth<00:02:12.120> and

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
to do is go up the planet the earth and

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.360 
to do is go up the planet the earth and
you<00:02:12.750> do<00:02:12.959> like<00:02:13.109> a<00:02:13.140> kid<00:02:13.440> but<00:02:13.590> what<00:02:13.739> kid<00:02:13.980> buu<00:02:14.130> did

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
you do like a kid but what kid buu did

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.490 
you do like a kid but what kid buu did
for<00:02:15.120> bills<00:02:15.329> it<00:02:15.480> would<00:02:15.600> be<00:02:15.690> like<00:02:15.840> 10<00:02:16.230> times

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
for bills it would be like 10 times

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.990 
for bills it would be like 10 times
easier<00:02:16.799> i<00:02:17.220> believe<00:02:17.730> so<00:02:18.980> that's<00:02:19.980> how<00:02:20.130> bills

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
easier i believe so that's how bills

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.580 
easier i believe so that's how bills
would<00:02:21.299> destroy<00:02:21.630> the<00:02:21.750> planet<00:02:21.989> in<00:02:22.200> my<00:02:22.290> opinion

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
would destroy the planet in my opinion

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.129 
would destroy the planet in my opinion
and<00:02:22.920> that's<00:02:23.880> what<00:02:24.060> i<00:02:24.120> was<00:02:24.239> thinking<00:02:24.299> because

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:25.139 
and that's what i was thinking because

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:26.360 
and that's what i was thinking because
bills<00:02:25.500> in<00:02:25.739> the<00:02:26.070> movie

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
bills in the movie

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.160 
bills in the movie
had<00:02:26.489> plenty<00:02:26.849> of<00:02:27.000> chances<00:02:27.090> to<00:02:27.569> actually<00:02:27.989> blow

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
had plenty of chances to actually blow

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.890 
had plenty of chances to actually blow
up<00:02:28.260> the<00:02:28.409> earth<00:02:28.519> even<00:02:29.519> in<00:02:29.610> the<00:02:29.730> beginning<00:02:30.269> when

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
up the earth even in the beginning when

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.360 
up the earth even in the beginning when
he<00:02:30.989> stepped<00:02:31.290> into<00:02:31.470> the<00:02:31.620> planet<00:02:31.980> he<00:02:32.069> could<00:02:32.250> have

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
he stepped into the planet he could have

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:33.770 
he stepped into the planet he could have
blow<00:02:32.760> up<00:02:32.879> the<00:02:33.030> earth<00:02:33.120> right<00:02:33.360> there<00:02:33.540> and<00:02:33.659> then

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
blow up the earth right there and then

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.750 
blow up the earth right there and then
but<00:02:34.019> he<00:02:34.080> didn't<00:02:34.500> do<00:02:34.799> it<00:02:34.830> and<00:02:35.190> I'm<00:02:35.610> actually

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
but he didn't do it and I'm actually

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.780 
but he didn't do it and I'm actually
starting<00:02:36.120> to<00:02:36.239> thinking<00:02:36.780> why<00:02:37.200> not<00:02:37.580> blow<00:02:38.580> up<00:02:38.700> the

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
starting to thinking why not blow up the

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.089 
starting to thinking why not blow up the
plan<00:02:39.030> I<00:02:39.060> mean<00:02:39.269> that's<00:02:40.230> that<00:02:40.650> was<00:02:40.769> his<00:02:40.920> sole

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099
