00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
light I think you can see the reflection

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.950 
light I think you can see the reflection
of<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.200> 9<00:01:10.409> LEDs<00:01:10.950> in<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.430> top<00:01:12.270> here<00:01:12.600> which<00:01:12.780> is

of the 9 LEDs in the top here which is
removable<00:01:14.330> and<00:01:15.330> we<00:01:15.420> take<00:01:15.720> it<00:01:15.900> off<00:01:16.080> here<00:01:16.470> just

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
removable and we take it off here just

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.340 
removable and we take it off here just
to<00:01:19.170> show<00:01:19.200> you<00:01:19.909> the<00:01:20.909> filter<00:01:21.240> which<00:01:21.659> is<00:01:21.840> actually

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.940 
to show you the filter which is actually
a<00:01:22.380> very<00:01:22.830> nice<00:01:23.070> filter<00:01:24.080> it<00:01:25.080> has<00:01:25.290> a<00:01:25.320> replaceable

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
a very nice filter it has a replaceable

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.080 
a very nice filter it has a replaceable
charcoal<00:01:27.320> actual<00:01:28.320> filter<00:01:28.770> in<00:01:28.890> there<00:01:29.070> I<00:01:29.310> think

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090

actual pump has an on and off switch for

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.730 
actual pump has an on and off switch for
the<00:01:38.310> LED<00:01:38.790> which<00:01:39.420> is<00:01:39.600> nice<00:01:42.229> and<00:01:43.229> this<00:01:43.500> one
