right<00:03:20.160> let's<00:03:20.910> see<00:03:21.120> what<00:03:21.300> else<00:03:21.450> there<00:03:21.660> is

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.240 

I<00:03:27.110> mean<00:03:28.110> there's<00:03:28.230> only<00:03:28.350> five<00:03:28.620> colors<00:03:29.070> that

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
I mean there's only five colors that

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:35.479 
I mean there's only five colors that
she's<00:03:29.430> wrong<00:03:33.470> that's<00:03:34.470> true<00:03:34.739> I<00:03:35.100> don't<00:03:35.250> know
