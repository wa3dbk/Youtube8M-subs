00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
answer is five so yeah did the first

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.699 
answer is five so yeah did the first
ones<00:03:03.299> aren't<00:03:03.600> the<00:03:03.780> answer<00:03:03.810> for<00:03:04.140> that<00:03:04.170> is<00:03:04.380> five

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
ones aren't the answer for that is five

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:10.710 
ones aren't the answer for that is five
and<00:03:06.620> trying<00:03:07.620> to<00:03:07.709> keep<00:03:08.220> going<00:03:08.519> around

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
and trying to keep going around

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.390 
and trying to keep going around
hopefully<00:03:11.720> this<00:03:11.840> one<00:03:12.020> it<00:03:12.590> is<00:03:12.830> a<00:03:12.860> frog<00:03:13.220> is

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
hopefully this one it is a frog is

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.190 
hopefully this one it is a frog is
trying<00:03:13.700> to<00:03:13.819> leap<00:03:13.940> up<00:03:14.120> a<00:03:14.270> slippery<00:03:14.540> riverbank

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
trying to leap up a slippery riverbank

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.140 
trying to leap up a slippery riverbank
he<00:03:15.470> jumps<00:03:15.830> up<00:03:15.950> three<00:03:16.280> feet<00:03:16.520> but<00:03:16.730> then<00:03:16.849> slides

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
he jumps up three feet but then slides

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.570 
he jumps up three feet but then slides
back<00:03:17.390> one<00:03:17.630> for<00:03:17.900> each<00:03:18.020> time<00:03:18.319> how<00:03:19.099> many<00:03:19.370> leads

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
back one for each time how many leads

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.460 
back one for each time how many leads
were<00:03:19.790> taken<00:03:20.330> to<00:03:20.450> climb<00:03:20.690> the<00:03:20.810> 14-foot

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
were taken to climb the 14-foot

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.420 
were taken to climb the 14-foot
riverbank<00:03:22.459> the<00:03:22.730> answer<00:03:23.000> is<00:03:23.030> seven<00:03:23.540> so<00:03:24.500> we'll

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
riverbank the answer is seven so we'll

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.160 
riverbank the answer is seven so we'll
come<00:03:25.640> through<00:03:25.790> here<00:03:25.940> and<00:03:26.390> then<00:03:26.720> we<00:03:26.930> have<00:03:27.050> the

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
come through here and then we have the

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:28.809 
come through here and then we have the
next<00:03:27.410> one<00:03:27.440> which<00:03:28.130> is<00:03:28.160> which<00:03:28.430> of<00:03:28.459> the<00:03:28.670> following

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:28.819 
next one which is which of the following

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:30.850 
next one which is which of the following
statements<00:03:29.030> is<00:03:29.540> correct<00:03:29.690> it<00:03:30.080> and<00:03:30.260> the<00:03:30.590> answer

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
statements is correct it and the answer

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.530 
statements is correct it and the answer
is<00:03:30.890> exactly<00:03:31.430> four<00:03:31.760> of<00:03:31.910> these<00:03:32.030> statements<00:03:32.300> are

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
is exactly four of these statements are

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.470 
is exactly four of these statements are
false<00:03:32.599> and<00:03:33.760> then<00:03:34.760> you<00:03:34.880> should<00:03:35.030> go<00:03:35.060> to<00:03:35.330> get

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
false and then you should go to get

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.800 
false and then you should go to get
through<00:03:35.599> that<00:03:35.720> one<00:03:35.900> then<00:03:36.769> come<00:03:37.099> down<00:03:37.340> here

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
through that one then come down here

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:47.680 
through that one then come down here
turn<00:03:38.810> this<00:03:38.900> way<00:03:40.000> this<00:03:41.000> way<00:03:41.269> this<00:03:43.060> way<00:03:44.060> this<00:03:46.690> way

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
turn this way this way this way this way

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:54.370 
turn this way this way this way this way
and<00:03:48.440> just<00:03:49.340> carry<00:03:49.670> on<00:03:50.769> and<00:03:52.060> then<00:03:53.060> this<00:03:54.049> is<00:03:54.230> what

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
and just carry on and then this is what

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.190 
and just carry on and then this is what
is<00:03:54.530> the<00:03:54.620> value<00:03:54.739> of<00:03:54.920> 1<00:03:55.580> over<00:03:55.610> 2<00:03:55.970> 2<00:03:56.180> or<00:03:56.390> 3<00:03:56.569> 3<00:03:56.810> or<00:03:56.930> 4

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
is the value of 1 over 2 2 or 3 3 or 4

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.860 
is the value of 1 over 2 2 or 3 3 or 4
and<00:03:57.380> so<00:03:57.620> on<00:03:57.650> order<00:03:58.400> order<00:03:58.519> up<00:03:58.730> 29<00:03:59.060> /<00:03:59.330> 10<00:03:59.540> and

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
and so on order order up 29 / 10 and

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.370 
and so on order order up 29 / 10 and
then<00:03:59.959> TSA's<00:04:00.170> of<00:04:00.349> 1000<00:04:01.099> the<00:04:01.819> answer<00:04:02.090> is<00:04:02.380> 100

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.380 
then TSA's of 1000 the answer is 100

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.890 
then TSA's of 1000 the answer is 100
which<00:04:03.650> should<00:04:03.830> be<00:04:03.950> the<00:04:04.069> last<00:04:04.220> one<00:04:04.459> and<00:04:04.690> one<00:04:05.690> run

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
which should be the last one and one run

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
which should be the last one and one run
down<00:04:06.080> here<00:04:06.410> to<00:04:06.769> the<00:04:06.950> last<00:04:07.190> gate<00:04:07.489> and<00:04:08.650> this<00:04:09.650> is<00:04:09.769> I

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
down here to the last gate and this is I

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.670 
down here to the last gate and this is I
have<00:04:10.160> a<00:04:10.190> very<00:04:10.430> slow<00:04:10.819> clock<00:04:11.120> baillieu<00:04:11.989> it<00:04:12.260> loses

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
have a very slow clock baillieu it loses

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.250 
have a very slow clock baillieu it loses
24<00:04:13.280> minutes<00:04:13.459> every<00:04:13.790> hour<00:04:13.819> it<00:04:14.630> was<00:04:14.840> right<00:04:15.049> at

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
24 minutes every hour it was right at

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.080 
24 minutes every hour it was right at
midnight<00:04:15.560> when<00:04:16.010> I<00:04:16.039> looked<00:04:16.340> at<00:04:16.549> it<00:04:16.579> an<00:04:16.760> hour<00:04:16.910> ago

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
midnight when I looked at it an hour ago

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.449 
midnight when I looked at it an hour ago
it<00:04:17.419> showed<00:04:17.690> free<00:04:17.959> am<00:04:18.229> what<00:04:18.530> time<00:04:18.560> is<00:04:19.010> it<00:04:19.160> really

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
it showed free am what time is it really

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.659 
it showed free am what time is it really
what<00:04:19.880> what<00:04:20.660> time<00:04:20.959> is<00:04:21.169> it<00:04:21.320> really<00:04:21.680> now<00:04:21.859> it<00:04:22.580> will

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:22.669 
what what time is it really now it will

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:25.390 
what what time is it really now it will
be<00:04:22.700> 60<00:04:23.390> so<00:04:24.200> go<00:04:24.560> down<00:04:24.620> to<00:04:24.830> the<00:04:24.919> bottom<00:04:25.070> one<00:04:25.280> that

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
be 60 so go down to the bottom one that

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.020 
be 60 so go down to the bottom one that
was<00:04:25.550> six<00:04:26.289> and<00:04:27.289> yeah<00:04:27.650> that's<00:04:28.310> the<00:04:28.490> last<00:04:28.669> one<00:04:28.910> we

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
was six and yeah that's the last one we

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.740 
was six and yeah that's the last one we
just<00:04:29.060> have<00:04:29.300> to<00:04:29.419> run<00:04:29.600> through<00:04:29.810> now<00:04:30.140> and<00:04:31.750> get

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
just have to run through now and get

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.890 
just have to run through now and get
