00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
so I did play a little bit sweaty for

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:01.770 
so I did play a little bit sweaty for
the<00:03:00.730> last<00:03:00.910> five<00:03:01.180> seconds<00:03:01.510> of<00:03:01.630> the<00:03:01.750> game

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
the last five seconds of the game

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.780

passing<00:03:02.349> it<00:03:02.410> back<00:03:02.530> to<00:03:02.650> my<00:03:02.769> right<00:03:02.920> back<00:03:03.160> until

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
passing it back to my right back until

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.970 
passing it back to my right back until
the<00:03:03.910> referee<00:03:04.030> blood<00:03:04.480> but<00:03:05.049> and<00:03:05.290> to<00:03:05.650> be<00:03:05.769> honest

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
the referee blood but and to be honest

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.410 
the referee blood but and to be honest
we<00:03:06.099> definitely<00:03:06.459> deserve<00:03:06.519> to<00:03:06.880> take<00:03:07.030> the<00:03:07.180> game

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
we definitely deserve to take the game

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.089 
we definitely deserve to take the game
and<00:03:07.660> it<00:03:08.019> would<00:03:08.140> have<00:03:08.230> been<00:03:08.319> an<00:03:08.500> absolute

00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:09.099 
and it would have been an absolute

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:10.559 
and it would have been an absolute
shocker<00:03:09.430> if<00:03:09.670> we<00:03:09.760> had<00:03:09.880> managed<00:03:10.150> to<00:03:10.180> concede

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:10.569 
shocker if we had managed to concede

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:12.479 
shocker if we had managed to concede
three<00:03:10.810> goals<00:03:11.049> in<00:03:11.170> the<00:03:11.290> 90th<00:03:11.620> minute<00:03:11.709> although

Smalling<00:04:09.220> straight<00:04:09.489> through<00:04:09.670> the<00:04:09.760> back<00:04:09.880> of

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
Smalling straight through the back of

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.789 
Smalling straight through the back of
the<00:04:10.090> legs<00:04:10.239> when<00:04:10.359> he's<00:04:10.450> wrong<00:04:10.780> go<00:04:11.019> and<00:04:11.350> gave

00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:11.799

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:13.920 
the legs when he's wrong go and gave
away<00:04:11.980> a<00:04:12.010> penalty<00:04:12.250> not<00:04:12.790> only<00:04:13.150> that<00:04:13.299> it<00:04:13.510> was<00:04:13.630> also

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930
