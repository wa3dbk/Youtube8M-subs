but yeah so a couple of things when
you're<00:04:50.670> doing<00:04:50.880> this<00:04:51.000> reckoner<00:04:51.900> build<00:04:52.490> the

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
you're doing this reckoner build the

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:54.950 
you're doing this reckoner build the
buildings<00:04:53.880> want<00:04:54.060> to<00:04:54.120> target<00:04:54.360> of<00:04:54.600> course<00:04:54.810> it's

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
buildings want to target of course it's

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.050 
buildings want to target of course it's
MCV<00:04:55.380> and<00:04:55.680> when<00:04:55.770> i<00:04:55.800> get<00:04:55.920> that<00:04:56.100> first<00:04:56.370> if<00:04:56.640> you<00:04:56.820> can

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
MCV and when i get that first if you can

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.840 
MCV and when i get that first if you can
lose<00:04:57.870> and<00:04:58.320> if<00:04:58.710> you<00:04:58.770> has<00:04:58.890> a<00:04:58.920> war<00:04:59.160> factory<00:04:59.580> with<00:04:59.730> G

00:04:59.840 --> 00:04:59.850 
lose and if you has a war factory with G

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:01.460 
lose and if you has a war factory with G
which<00:05:00.090> you<00:05:00.210> should<00:05:00.540> definitely<00:05:01.140> should<00:05:01.440> have

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470 
which you should definitely should have

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:04.040 
which you should definitely should have
wore<00:05:01.710> fact<00:05:01.950> you<00:05:02.040> by<00:05:02.190> that<00:05:02.340> time<00:05:02.840> then<00:05:03.840> you<00:05:03.870> go

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
wore fact you by that time then you go

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.140 
wore fact you by that time then you go
to<00:05:04.110> target<00:05:04.500> that<00:05:04.650> Lee<00:05:04.860> wells<00:05:05.040> will<00:05:05.430> because<00:05:06.030> if

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
to target that Lee wells will because if

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.560 
to target that Lee wells will because if
you<00:05:06.270> just<00:05:06.630> get<00:05:06.780> his<00:05:06.870> MCV<00:05:08.090> you<00:05:09.090> can<00:05:09.240> just<00:05:09.390> build

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:09.570 
you just get his MCV you can just build

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:11.510 
you just get his MCV you can just build
another<00:05:09.690> one<00:05:09.900> out<00:05:10.170> of<00:05:10.260> his<00:05:10.350> war<00:05:10.560> factory<00:05:10.980> and

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 
another one out of his war factory and

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.560 
another one out of his war factory and
you<00:05:12.120> don't<00:05:12.300> want<00:05:12.450> that<00:05:13.940> so<00:05:14.940> yeah<00:05:15.060> if<00:05:15.180> you<00:05:15.300> can't

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:15.570 
you don't want that so yeah if you can't

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:17.000 
you don't want that so yeah if you can't
get<00:05:15.780> the<00:05:15.900> M<00:05:15.960> severe<00:05:16.290> the<00:05:16.410> war<00:05:16.590> factory

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.010 
get the M severe the war factory

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:19.490 
get the M severe the war factory
structures<00:05:17.930> basically<00:05:18.930> just<00:05:19.140> target

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
structures basically just target

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.020 
structures basically just target
anything<00:05:19.860> power<00:05:20.070> plants<00:05:20.490> it's<00:05:20.640> just<00:05:20.790> kind<00:05:20.970> of

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.030 
anything power plants it's just kind of

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:24.620 
anything power plants it's just kind of
a<00:05:21.120> waste<00:05:21.300> of<00:05:21.420> time<00:05:23.090> but<00:05:24.090> it<00:05:24.210> can<00:05:24.330> get<00:05:24.450> to

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.630 
a waste of time but it can get to

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:26.690 
a waste of time but it can get to
refineries<00:05:25.140> and<00:05:25.290> something<00:05:25.890> when<00:05:26.190> technicals

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:26.700 
refineries and something when technicals

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:28.550 
refineries and something when technicals
and<00:05:26.850> that<00:05:27.000> also<00:05:27.210> good<00:05:27.510> don't<00:05:28.290> be<00:05:28.410> discouraged
