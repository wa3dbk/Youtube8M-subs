name is Shane and today we'll be going

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:18.610 
name is Shane and today we'll be going
over<00:00:17.210> the<00:00:17.330> process<00:00:17.840> for<00:00:18.080> installing<00:00:18.380> a

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:18.620 
over the process for installing a

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:22.960 
over the process for installing a
thermal<00:00:19.010> printer<00:00:19.220> to<00:00:20.060> a<00:00:20.420> POS<00:00:21.140> terminal<00:00:21.970> we'll

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:22.970 
thermal printer to a POS terminal we'll

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.330 
thermal printer to a POS terminal we'll
be<00:00:23.090> using<00:00:23.240> a<00:00:23.570> parallel<00:00:23.900> port<00:00:24.350> the<00:00:24.950> parallel

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:25.340 
be using a parallel port the parallel

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.450 
be using a parallel port the parallel
ports<00:00:25.670> and<00:00:25.880> a<00:00:26.330> parallel<00:00:27.020> cable<00:00:27.260> today<00:00:27.680> it's

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460 
ports and a parallel cable today it's

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.429 
ports and a parallel cable today it's
essentially<00:00:28.970> the<00:00:29.060> same<00:00:29.270> process<00:00:29.599> as<00:00:30.020> using<00:00:30.349> a

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:30.439 
essentially the same process as using a

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:33.970 
essentially the same process as using a
USB<00:00:30.470> cable<00:00:31.009> in<00:00:31.460> the<00:00:31.610> USB<00:00:32.150> port<00:00:32.509> but<00:00:32.750> of<00:00:33.260> course

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:33.980 
USB cable in the USB port but of course

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.950 
USB cable in the USB port but of course
you'll<00:00:34.160> be<00:00:34.190> using<00:00:34.550> different<00:00:34.700> ports<00:00:35.210> and<00:00:35.390> when

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
you'll be using different ports and when

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.840 
you'll be using different ports and when
you<00:00:36.050> install<00:00:36.410> the<00:00:36.560> drivers<00:00:36.980> you<00:00:37.460> will<00:00:37.610> choose

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
you install the drivers you will choose

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.830 
you install the drivers you will choose
lpt1<00:00:38.690> as<00:00:39.440> your<00:00:40.160> port<00:00:40.490> instead<00:00:41.150> of<00:00:41.360> the<00:00:41.480> USB

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:41.840 
lpt1 as your port instead of the USB

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.560 
lpt1 as your port instead of the USB
port<00:00:42.410> but<00:00:43.190> we'll<00:00:43.460> go<00:00:43.610> over<00:00:43.640> that<00:00:43.820> process<00:00:44.180> a

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
port but we'll go over that process a

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.330 
port but we'll go over that process a
little<00:00:44.870> bit<00:00:45.020> later<00:00:45.230> what<00:00:46.010> you're<00:00:46.160> going<00:00:46.310> to

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340 
little bit later what you're going to

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.310 
little bit later what you're going to
need<00:00:46.520> for<00:00:46.730> this<00:00:46.820> is<00:00:47.150> of<00:00:47.390> course<00:00:47.780> your<00:00:47.960> thermal

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 
need for this is of course your thermal

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.760 
need for this is of course your thermal
printer<00:00:48.740> a<00:00:49.210> POS<00:00:50.210> terminal<00:00:50.780> your<00:00:51.680> power<00:00:51.950> supply

to<00:01:07.150> your<00:01:08.150> thermal<00:01:08.570> printer<00:01:09.250> so<00:01:10.250> we'll<00:01:10.880> take

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
to your thermal printer so we'll take

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:20.819 
to your thermal printer so we'll take
this<00:01:11.600> cable<00:01:11.950> and<00:01:12.950> we'll<00:01:13.610> plug<00:01:13.790> it<00:01:13.970> into<00:01:14.150> here

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:20.829 

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:26.669 

we'll<00:01:21.829> then<00:01:21.979> plug<00:01:22.640> in<00:01:23.229> our<00:01:24.229> power<00:01:24.499> source

00:01:26.669 --> 00:01:26.679 
we'll then plug in our power source

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:29.919 
we'll then plug in our power source
we'll<00:01:27.679> take<00:01:27.890> our<00:01:28.100> adapter<00:01:28.579> which<00:01:29.119> has<00:01:29.329> a<00:01:29.600> flat

00:01:29.919 --> 00:01:29.929 
we'll take our adapter which has a flat

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:33.160 
we'll take our adapter which has a flat
side<00:01:30.670> and<00:01:31.670> we<00:01:31.729> want<00:01:31.909> that<00:01:32.060> flat<00:01:32.359> side<00:01:32.630> facing

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
side and we want that flat side facing

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.380 
side and we want that flat side facing
up<00:01:33.350> towards<00:01:33.890> the<00:01:34.039> bottom<00:01:34.520> of<00:01:34.729> the<00:01:34.909> printer
