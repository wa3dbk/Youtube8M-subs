00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:11.250
 we are ready for the second annuity 

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:14.940
 and today is Friday so you too 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.940
 they celebrate that we are going to do 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:21.940
 as useful as good is that it has a 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.130
 hard napkin to all all so 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:26.860
 let's see the list of materials for 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:29.830
 the billboards for the new year 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:32.040
 We need a certain red and white ribbon 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:36.000
 one centimeter wide black 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:39.760
 clean golden pipes ruler scissors 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.290
 gun and silicon bars as well 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.080
 how are we going to convert this being 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:46.690
 victuals are words and apart 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:52.059
 we buy in exact roll and we're going to 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:54.260
 decorate with this very Christmas for this 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:57.949
 scene from 24 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:02.230
 and we are going to do as we are also a 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:06.740
 5 where santa could be played very well 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:09.560
 that by the way we were struggling to 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:12.900
 to be able to extract another idea from these 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:16.650
 magnificent napkin rings 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:21.030
 and for it you have the buckle we have 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:23.130
 practice we already have practice let's go 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.740
 We are going to cover this and good 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.440
 we can make them as a fold and cough 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.880
 very well to the best that comes out a little 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.770
 white a little bit white and 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.590
 so 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.320
 will have three dimensions all 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.570
 colors we could put our out and 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.820
 do as everything very accurate but I do not know 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.280
 because as we master the subject well 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.090
 takes from home to the metro and grope 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:51.920
 It was so nice because then 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:55.490
 It gives you that self- made aspect or 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.770
 carney as they like that rich part 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:03.140
 I am already touching that scene that 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:06.310
 the romeritos that lomo jungle that the 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.310
 night than cod 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.700
 that the leg 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.700
 marinated 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.770
 later I achieved ciarÃ¡n and another was formed 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:25.910
 sure time 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:27.140
 that would be like the first part that 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.700
 same and a little bit longer because 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:33.980
 here nothing is going 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:35.570
 roll up the slogan because not because 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.450
 seeing and also because I'm not going to 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:41.540
 cut out and other new ones are going to be 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:44.360
 economize on napkin and material 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.470
 here we have the bar and lower and 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.710
 thrown away but 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.390
 there is nothing but white is a bit 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:54.800
 thicker and then the story over 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.800
 of the exact red 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:04.840
 and here is the launch and then 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.780
 our buckle that you had already made 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.770
 How are you 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:13.010
 and also because 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:17.690
 tell us what is going to exchange what 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:20.690
 always hear so that he really and the 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.340
 cusco every that is incredible if that 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.500
 idea is very good so do it the same 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:27.290
 at home you get a gift from 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.780
 truth and joke joke and always 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.210
 They are the cheapest and with the best 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.010
 you pass it you die of laughter because the 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:36.130
 another almost always says very seriously because 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:39.710
 we almost never like what usually happens 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:42.640
 then I want and put face today 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:42.640
 thanks dad 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:50.379
 and well some fighter's pants never 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:53.620
 We give songs fighter and 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:56.620
 The fighter's underpants are not strong but yes 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:04:01.290
 that the socks this way you know 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.290
 some pull out the silicone heaters 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:07.850
 eighties but yes that the sweater that already 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:10.190
 did not want the aunt for 4 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:19.670
 perfect that is a case closet like 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:21.290
 we say here exactly that the program is 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:23.270
 the respectful of your son who catches the 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:26.210
 television that back to see the child the 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:28.430
 street the video game be quiet for 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.940
 what children is called blind to be in 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.370
 pedrito 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:37.950
 look how beautiful the truth is very good 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:39.450
 pedrito brings his video game that I'm going to 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:41.169
 double because I had already put him in 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:45.360
 the silicon of 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:48.550
 besides nothing is a mistake all added 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:50.620
 remember it let me put a little more and 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.440
 and nothing else then with the black and so 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.990
 we do not spend so much 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:57.770
 material is highlighting and then I was 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:05:02.830
 it happens that we can do it here 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:05.770
 oh how beautiful it is and cut out please 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:07.819
 we seem like the magician who made you 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:10.729
 cut the rope like this with those that 

00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:14.650
 they broke not now not magic of the 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:14.650
 parties if already for a few years 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:23.910
 i 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:26.600
 and we stop the experience no no I am 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:26.600

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:31.870
 Of course yes then we have here 

00:05:29.989 --> 00:05:35.130
 our napkin ring 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:35.130
 that we are going to turn around 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:41.510
 and we stick it with silicone 

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:50.130
 and we remember the secular of 14 and really 

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:51.960
 is that this getting up so early 

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:55.550
 to come here to the first and the morning 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.550
 and that you in craft can see 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:04.180
 what you do not know comes directly but 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:05.889
 of the clear pachanga that will not be 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:10.340
 spiritual retreat that is very difficult 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:12.269
 ideas fell and they win him lombroso 

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:18.779
 one 

00:06:12.269 --> 00:06:22.370
 the guardian of the horrible napkin 

00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:25.360
 the taking of the sac 

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:27.800
 very careful of no more than 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:30.320
 the elegance of france mister de polanco 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:33.100
 applying life and napkins or the 

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:33.100
 napkins 

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:39.440
 magic of the areas condemned by a 

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:42.760
 passive and told me net and now yes 

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:42.760
 let's see the step by step 

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:48.680
 processing mode cuts a strip of 

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:50.810
 three centimeters by five in the felt 

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:53.720
 white and in the red a strip of 

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:55.790
 13 x 4 cuts 13 centimeters from the ribbon 

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:58.040
 black and stick it on the red 

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:59.990
 make a small picture with the world as 

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:03.340
 if it were the buckle of the future they close 

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:03.340
 the strips forming napkin ring 

00:07:06.129 --> 00:07:11.020
 we are that you have liked these 

00:07:07.779 --> 00:07:13.149
