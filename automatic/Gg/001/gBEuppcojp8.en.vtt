00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260
 after that it's time to refuse them 

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:05.820
 do not believe that you will see and yet this summer 2008 

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:06.649
 Yes 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:08.049
 why I say 

00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:10.989
 and then with us tonight at the villa in a stable state 

00:00:10.989 --> 00:00:13.439
 after a search 

00:00:13.439 --> 00:00:16.159
 to discover these little robots scenario 

00:00:16.159 --> 00:00:19.230
 he misses this little robot for laos 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.380
 in the tenth year 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.329
 so this art to the dungeons inspired the huma fall that him 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:26.759
 looks a bit like that so 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:31.269
 paris i want to know why not very quickly the judgment i'm 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:34.269
 dad 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.430
 by pierre lopes 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.800
 these last 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.790
 he recognizes his career 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:47.080
 revival 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.070
 after he 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.070
 the fair which is held to the fact that it is hot 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.760
 he's done more than 6,400 dead the organization has refueled 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.229
 it is important for women who like to look closely at what makes the cleaning 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.939
 everyone can then make the bread is okay said it's to play 

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:09.790
 this base yes 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.150
 so it's mine 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.180
 this is a good m mechatronic system that means what it is 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.050
 a fusion of mechanics 2 the haye and electronics integrate 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:21.050
 and the goal 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.020
 of this system is that 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.570
 the highest since April 5 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.960
 when you run out of heavier loads the result goes to georgia 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.360
 1-0 one way 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.110
 to believe the opposite France will not repeat after 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.320
 while football 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.770
 indeed a lot we will not reach the crisis acolyte clip which is a school 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.450
 engineer or university 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.630
 % of in training he did not provide chronic tickling chronicle 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.500
 automatic in sandals indicates 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.800
 because these themes that meaning corollar around this system there it is 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.580
 to say we do not have to be a mechanic to use this 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.430
 robot there we can be so% to have knowledge in electronics in 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.600
 computer science including soiling to students to learn how to 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.559
 program his orders and it was shaving abuse of power 

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:13.379
 so program it for 100 th so the program and to perform tasks 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:16.709
 say he leads the deal such as walking 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.029
 % climb the stairs we attend 

00:02:20.029 --> 00:02:23.519
 people accompanying them in one year 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:26.700
 bridges and interacts with people in relation to the beaujoire 

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:29.729
 vis-Ã -vis the vision and we try 

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:31.669
 in e2 support 

00:02:31.669 --> 00:02:36.609
 in ed mariners operators in the reception or in the assistantship of a 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:38.299
 In General 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:41.989
 e in everyday life the cpi can replace someone the question risk of not 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:45.400
 to hurt me to place earlier accompanied by the department 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.509
 American at work reforms in the capital 

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:51.679
 the eye of the research she was really 

00:02:51.679 --> 00:02:53.509
 alger of the future 

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:55.659
 can we imagine 

00:02:55.659 --> 00:03:00.029
 five years for example he's going to have a bigger shape even more human 

00:03:00.029 --> 00:03:02.879
 and who will really assist people at home for the first time 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:07.259
 time has been fixed in the current vision in the development in the 

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:09.750
 design of new generations of 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.610
 of this type of robot and and the goal is precisely not only to 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.220
 to realize the robot is to be able the program is so that they can 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.890
 realize this is what is more difficult to do it will dance 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.080
 so you have that the mans the tone is light breakaway scythe perfume is 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.000
 in the process of 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.179
 the project waking up to say 

00:03:30.179 --> 00:03:34.909
 it takes progressively in power in energy and my bed driven by 

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:37.900
 explanation energy and% and 10% 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.890
 which has a lifespan 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:43.580
 ten depending on type number of actions of summer mankon and at the same time 

00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:45.780
 the good loser 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.420
 yes but not for her so he's not ready right now after 28 years 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.369
 is not an incident that 

00:03:51.369 --> 00:03:54.519
 yes he had given the green light to lower the price of the place of 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:04:01.329
 victories at the Seine while it was in the fire dallas the broker finished in 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:04.660
 drop always about were present for example interlocutor 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.389
 with the Scottish candidate the sort of wizard 

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:10.389
 especially by the final victory at roland-garros 

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:14.159
 in normal times while the commanders prefer to dance or what 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.400
 in any case that's what I do to him what I mean 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.099
 the countess actually marketed here you are 

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:25.770
 ap at the moment is already marketed and expensive 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.090
 it's still very expensive because it's not enough talking and general public 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:34.139
 to steer it they are it's not oriented general public senate thursday at d 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:37.940
 given the demand of academic and research institutions for the purpose 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:39.700
 to develop further programs 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:43.400
 medard% in the future in addition to minimizing this age 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.590
 on the number of embedded sensors for 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:49.500
 make it the more you tell yourself in the elections it is able to read 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.280
 the worst emails about neurological diseases yes for example in a 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.140
 repetition of the chaos and a black and pungent jacket she reinstates in place 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:04:57.699
 for example 

00:04:57.699 --> 00:04:59.949
 the pmu person is not indispensable as ever
