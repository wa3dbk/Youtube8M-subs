00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:07.620
 hello today i will show you how 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.679
 cook home a butter gi 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.900
 this beautiful Sanskrit kim word in 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.420
 India for many centuries called the product 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.830
 which was also known to our grandmothers 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.670
 under a different name 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.090
 they knew him like melted butter 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.000
 cooking gi 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.890
 is in the process of cleansing the oil and 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.949
 remove all impurities from it 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.080
 water, so the quality of the original 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.290
 raw materials are very high 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.800
 requirements better than the original 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:40.170
 oil the better product we will get on 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.829
 Out I prefer to take butter on 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.260
 the bazaar 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.420
 but you can take oil and store and 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.760
 the only thing you need to watch out for 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:56.010
 it was without any additives and 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:59.550
 unsalted to begin with we will cut our 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:03.210
 oil into small pieces and put in 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:07.130
 thick-bottomed pot to finish our 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:16.259
 butter we will be on very low heat and 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:18.450
 long enough and very neat on 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.090
 the very first stage is under closed 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.150
 lid need to completely melt the butter 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.439
 and bring it to a boil when on 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.009
 oil surfaces 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:33.210
 white foam is formed we start it 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:36.060
 clean while reducing fire to 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.340
 the most possible minimum in the process 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:42.750
 cooking our butter becomes 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:45.960
 transparent and here comes the main 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:49.710
 the danger of this process that she does not give 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:54.450
 God will start to burn so that it will not 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:02:00.689
 happened we use small 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:06.200
 trick we set aside our pan with 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:12.800
 fire put on fire a new pot and 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:19.700
 slowly very carefully pour 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:23.910
 our clear oil to the new pan 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:26.880
 in 2 pans of foam and sediment 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:30.990
 much less but all is formed 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:33.140
 they still have butter 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:40.520
 absolutely transparent 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:45.600
 has a very beautiful golden color and 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:48.770
 very pleasant nutty aroma but for 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:53.840
 so that it does not start to burn 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:53.840
 it's time to pour it again 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.400
 if we did everything right then in 3 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:20.030
 the pan will not have any foam 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:22.640
 no sediment it serves rather to check 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:25.520
 the quality of the product than for its further 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.400
 cleaning now we only need 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:31.130
 wait for the oil 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:33.170
 finally get ready to pay 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:38.570
 attention is that this nasty white 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:43.010
 foam and terrible sediment that stayed on 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:45.410
 the bottom of the pots could be inside you 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.390
 your liver would have to be very good 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:51.890
 work hard to get them out 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:54.530
 out but our oil is ready we gave 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:57.560
 our butter and cool slightly and now 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:00.080
 for final cleaning we are through cheesecloth 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:03.620
 pour it into a glass jar 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:11.720
 where it will cool completely when 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:16.280
 open lid at room 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:20.049
 oil temperature freezes and has 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.049
 very nice yellowish tint 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:32.080
 and nice nutty flavor we store it 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:37.650
 in a dark dry place where she can 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:37.650
 stored indefinitely
