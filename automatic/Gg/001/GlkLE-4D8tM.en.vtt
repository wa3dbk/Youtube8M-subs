00:00:03.189 --> 00:00:07.580
 ea's press conference is over 

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:09.380
 and half the internet wonders what 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.060
 has with the new games of bioware 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.800
 What's up with it? 

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:14.810
 good question so we saw that 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.789
 you in addition to mass effect in a whole 

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:18.650
 New brand work in edmonton in the 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:20.480
 the headquarters of bio who they have 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.699
 kinda prototype like that a bit 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.019
 what footage moderately shown but really 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:26.210
 we did not make it smart 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:27.589
 if i am not i am in good hope 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.929
 that maybe he somehow on the e3 

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:31.279
 then see something else or learn how 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:32.930
 you know, roleplaying is the new thing 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:36.140
 ax new action game or us something 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:38.420
 so far was only hinted but times 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.180
 wait and see what's new at werder 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.769
 for us apropos new brands there were yes 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.890
 other smiles michael already 

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:48.199
 Happy to a new game of criterion 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.879
 games why are you was to inspire 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:51.289
 very early on you have prototypes of 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:52.429
 that means maybe that's what 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:53.690
 I imagine everything synonymous only in 

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:56.120
 but my head is always god only 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.339
 awesome because it seems open world 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.870
 game is where you like a bit now 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:01.670
 earlier at the old pilotwings where she 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.649
 everything that flies through the clinics of 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.329
 nexus has aircraft to somewhere else 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:07.369
 they thinking in animals okay we do 

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:09.200
 only with everything that flies and drives 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:11.180
 and then they showed jetskis 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.570
 and should handballer turner is always 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.070
 Super 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.840
 especially because of the damage model 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.159
 just cars against a wall 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.899
 driving has never been so much fun 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:19.220
 and now if I'm eight jets and 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:20.659
 helicopter and drive in the wall 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.850
 can and they break so nicely 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:23.990
 I'm perfectly happy drive driving 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.710
 Also like to have his article on the wall though 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.710
 that's another story 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.640
 So go straight to the wall 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.230
 a little bit against the wall was yes 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.610
 also the sense of the new battlefield 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:34.080
 from battlefield hartl one already 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.090
 somehow weeks before the e3 half 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.500
 internet is like it is now as an old age 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.340
 Battlefield further your impression of 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.320
 battlefield hardliner 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.850
 I'm torn because that's what 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.040
 we have seen and also what petra 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.690
 has played that is actually objective 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.730
 all very well and will definitely 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.230
 first of all fun but me 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:51.270
 personally I'm not at all 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:53.070
 excited about the announcement because it 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.560
 comes to me too early after battlefield 4 it 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.700
 looks a lot like heiko ahead 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.740
 already said in the livestream with us 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.330
 that looks like a mod yes are just 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.440
 police cars driving through the city 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.880
 there are some tank trucks that 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.460
 explode and buses are all quite 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.950
 cool but he looks at it 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.179
 similar and it comes too fast and me 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.640
 Do not find them on battlefield 4 yet 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.010
 times really completely gefixed and me 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.790
 I'm no fan of this newer every year 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.500
 part 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.910
 I had wanted 23 years who 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.250
 this setting has been cool 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:23.130
 only hope is that many games 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.950
 better not a story than the ice 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.120
 I did it myself 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.580
 honestly not really 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.620
 thrilled that come from 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:34.290
 and then there was also addressed 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.060
 we have seen very early versions 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.010
 have a lot of playing at ea very ea 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.720
 very or unusually early versions 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.180
 even seen why do you think to do it 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.500
 It has always been like that before 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.120
 In conversation that many of the bigger ones 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.530
 Polish was very skeptical about itself 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.420
 this new console generation yet 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.940
 lets sell obviously belongs 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.290
 to it and accordingly has now 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.340
 apparently not so many things that 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.200
 They can show you and in the near 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.000
 coming out of dragon age 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.650
 and so apart and has now 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.870
 probably just forced to see 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.260
 to trump on this e3 properly 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.150
 can 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.130
 to show earlier versions we have 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.989
 from the very big guarantees of 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.850
 battlefront for example, yes too 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.290
 Actually just a studio tour and here 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.820
 and there they said before 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.470
 At mass effect we were working 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.450
 looks but we show you nothing 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.769
 probably only around now 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.000
 new consoles generation not that 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:20.850
 to dig off water by herself 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.470
 put it down and say it in two years 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:25.530
 Maybe the next coal title will come 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:27.239
 Okay then we give grad 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.400
 the ball still worth rené walter 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.959
 your conclusion was too little battlefront in 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.140
 the presentation or in the 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.370
 press conference in it 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.470
 I'm first been happy there 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.660
 He has shown very briefly 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:40.150
 what seen here with the speed bikes 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.950
 through the jungle and somehow hood 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.090
 was implied with the rockers and it 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:43.660
 of course again all very very 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.580
 cool 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.410
 if that really looks like later 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.850
 I have yet to show you 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.190
 little skeptical but we can 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.750
 Now glad that it showed what 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.340
 me personally, of course, very close to the heart 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.500
 lay was morissette that finally 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.000
 there is more to see and that she is 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.130
 really behind it and is well 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.290
 actually becomes a game and not only 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.570
 I was a vision of that 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.120
 actually happy if the 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:09.040
 battlefield story would not be 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.750
 andré your conclusion i must confess so 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.640
 First of all, he has to say 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.220
 bit hard that battlefield 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.250
 easter fire already said in the internet 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.669
 before up and down 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.530
 was trained through 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:22.510
 one has already noticed that was so 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.520
 knaller planned but where they say and 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.530
 now you can play and everyone 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:31.270
 even battlefield hardliner sat yes 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:32.620
 something new then all the big titles me 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.750
 I've already said everything where I am 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.230
 now said so boring shows cool 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.450
 me more 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:39.610
 no, we'll show you the studio and how 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:40.930
 you like the art is your 3d models 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.970
 to tinker together that means everything 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.050
 really big and fat would be what we from 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:44.860
 he did not know anything about it yet 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:49.960
 far away 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:51.340
 so far a bit he is so solid though 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.630
 Actually, we already knew it 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.120
 would not necessarily have this pk 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:56.710
 used where from now on the two sports 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.180
 Of course, I'm having a nice banana next to me 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:00.010
 Did not say anything is the new metten 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.810
 with the completely overhauled here 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:02.890
 by the way, fans have been with us for years 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.330
 will make that necessary now 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:07.620
 Interested except me in Germany 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.620
 of course, virtually no one 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.460
 why we go so we 

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:14.169
 Now back to the hotel look us 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.940
 the ubisoft pk and hope that you 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:18.510
 us as the first chamber really from 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.510
 socks skin or
