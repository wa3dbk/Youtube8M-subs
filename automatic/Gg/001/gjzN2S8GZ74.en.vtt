apparently is going to have two options
22<00:00:28.740> most<00:00:29.490> likely<00:00:29.789> options<00:00:30.359> either<00:00:30.570> he<00:00:30.900> fights

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
know it's of course it's probably going

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:53.959 
know it's of course it's probably going
to<00:00:46.379> be<00:00:46.440> morales<00:00:47.100> if<00:00:47.280> he<00:00:47.430> wins<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:52.969> because

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
to be morales if he wins and because

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.910 
to be morales if he wins and because
he's<00:00:54.149> much<00:00:54.420> more<00:00:55.170> known<00:00:55.530> than<00:00:55.559> peterson<00:00:56.489> but<00:00:56.820> i

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
just think that is impressive as a

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.760 
just think that is impressive as a
performance<00:01:04.890> that<00:01:05.040> Morales<00:01:05.700> put<00:01:06.180> forth

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
performance that Morales put forth

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.650 
performance that Morales put forth

i'm<00:01:28.430> pretty<00:01:28.640> sure<00:01:28.970> that<00:01:29.000> speed<00:01:29.780> he<00:01:30.050> won't<00:01:30.260> be

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
i'm pretty sure that speed he won't be

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:38.109 
i'm pretty sure that speed he won't be
able<00:01:30.530> to<00:01:30.650> handle<00:01:31.030> your<00:01:32.030> speed<00:01:33.760> but<00:01:36.970> but<00:01:37.970> he

able to handle your speed but but he
knows<00:01:38.300> how<00:01:38.450> to<00:01:38.479> get<00:01:38.750> inside<00:01:39.080> and<00:01:39.140> land<00:01:39.500> a<00:01:39.619> good

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:39.800 
knows how to get inside and land a good

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.290 
knows how to get inside and land a good
solid<00:01:40.070> punchy<00:01:40.729> easy<00:01:41.090> he<00:01:41.930> knows<00:01:42.640> he's<00:01:43.640> able<00:01:43.880> to

pretty<00:02:31.010> much<00:02:31.220> I<00:02:31.489> mean<00:02:32.180> he<00:02:32.329> occasionally<00:02:32.630> puts

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
pretty much I mean he occasionally puts

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.009

his hands up and clams up but maybe a

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:40.870 
his hands up and clams up but maybe a
little<00:02:36.230> bit<00:02:36.410> more<00:02:36.650> now<00:02:37.690> than<00:02:38.690> before<00:02:39.880> that

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
little bit more now than before that

little bit more now than before that
only<00:02:41.420> slightly<00:02:42.019> more<00:02:42.410> I<00:02:42.440> don't<00:02:43.190> really<00:02:43.459> even

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
only slightly more I don't really even

only slightly more I don't really even
think<00:02:43.940> his<00:02:44.660> defense<00:02:45.110> has<00:02:45.290> improved<00:02:45.500> at<00:02:45.920> all<00:02:46.010> to

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
think his defense has improved at all to

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:47.860

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
only slightly but but um I you know you

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.229 
only slightly but but um I you know you
have<00:02:53.989> conf<00:02:54.799> on<00:02:55.040> him<00:02:55.280> then<00:02:55.640> con<00:02:55.940> fault

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239

McCloskey<00:02:56.959> which<00:02:58.239> nobody<00:02:59.239> even<00:02:59.510> really<00:02:59.750> knew

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
McCloskey which nobody even really knew

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.160 
McCloskey which nobody even really knew
too<00:03:00.470> much<00:03:00.650> about<00:03:00.709> more<00:03:01.400> cared<00:03:01.730> about<00:03:01.880> and<00:03:02.329> then

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:11.630 

and<00:03:06.170> then<00:03:06.320> he<00:03:06.410> fought<00:03:06.590> Judah<00:03:08.380> that<00:03:09.380> and

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
and then he fought Judah that and

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.560 
and then he fought Judah that and
so<00:03:12.640> basically<00:03:14.220> okay<00:03:15.220> the<00:03:15.760> thing<00:03:15.970> about<00:03:16.000> Judah

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570 
so basically okay the thing about Judah

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.560 
so basically okay the thing about Judah
is<00:03:16.720> is<00:03:16.990> he<00:03:17.520> people<00:03:18.520> have<00:03:18.640> criticized<00:03:19.150> him<00:03:19.390> and

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
is is he people have criticized him and

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.420 
is is he people have criticized him and
he<00:03:19.720> definitely<00:03:19.960> proved<00:03:20.620> them<00:03:20.830> right<00:03:21.100> in<00:03:21.370> that

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
he definitely proved them right in that

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.780 
he definitely proved them right in that
fight<00:03:21.790> that<00:03:22.000> he's<00:03:22.570> unreliable<00:03:22.990> and<00:03:23.650> that<00:03:24.280> he

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
fight that he's unreliable and that he

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.660 
fight that he's unreliable and that he
doesn't<00:03:24.970> really<00:03:25.240> have<00:03:25.390> heart<00:03:26.200> I<00:03:26.670> didn't

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
doesn't really have heart I didn't

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.470 
doesn't really have heart I didn't
believe<00:03:28.000> that<00:03:28.030> but<00:03:29.070> I<00:03:30.070> can't<00:03:30.910> deny<00:03:31.090> what

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
believe that but I can't deny what

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.550 
believe that but I can't deny what
happened<00:03:31.930> in<00:03:32.260> the<00:03:33.420> in<00:03:34.420> the<00:03:34.480> in<00:03:35.110> the<00:03:35.200> fight

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
happened in the in the in the fight

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.500 
happened in the in the in the fight
against<00:03:36.220> Conn<00:03:36.430> I<00:03:38.550> think<00:03:39.550> he's<00:03:39.670> capable<00:03:40.090> of

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
against Conn I think he's capable of

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.180 
against Conn I think he's capable of
much<00:03:40.720> more<00:03:40.750> I<00:03:41.080> think<00:03:41.320> he's<00:03:41.590> better<00:03:41.800> than<00:03:42.040> that

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
much more I think he's better than that

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.710 
much more I think he's better than that
performance<00:03:42.820> but<00:03:44.250> but<00:03:45.250> I<00:03:45.880> can't<00:03:46.390> deny<00:03:46.570> that

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
performance but but I can't deny that

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.710 
performance but but I can't deny that
you<00:03:47.620> know<00:03:47.820> can't<00:03:48.820> beat<00:03:49.390> him

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
you know can't beat him

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.990 
you know can't beat him
with<00:03:51.200> arguably<00:03:51.560> a<00:03:51.830> low<00:03:52.130> blow<00:03:52.340> that<00:03:52.700> he<00:03:52.820> should

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
with arguably a low blow that he should

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.030 
with arguably a low blow that he should
have<00:03:53.090> gotten<00:03:53.240> a<00:03:53.390> point<00:03:53.630> deducted<00:03:54.020> for<00:03:54.590> and<00:03:54.920> the

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
have gotten a point deducted for and the

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.370 
have gotten a point deducted for and the
fight<00:03:55.220> should<00:03:55.430> have<00:03:55.550> went<00:03:55.700> on<00:03:55.820> but<00:03:56.150> I'll<00:03:57.140> admit

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
fight should have went on but I'll admit

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.530 
fight should have went on but I'll admit
it<00:03:57.680> wasn't<00:03:57.710> looking<00:03:58.130> good<00:03:58.340> for<00:03:58.850> Judah<00:03:59.180> at<00:03:59.330> that

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
it wasn't looking good for Judah at that

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:06.340 
it wasn't looking good for Judah at that
point<00:03:59.900> at<00:04:00.170> that<00:04:00.410> time<00:04:02.980> then

you<00:05:08.800> might<00:05:08.949> argue<00:05:09.309> that<00:05:09.339> Kessler<00:05:11.159> that<00:05:12.159> was<00:05:12.279> a

00:05:12.299 --> 00:05:12.309 
you might argue that Kessler that was a

00:05:12.309 --> 00:05:15.329 
you might argue that Kessler that was a
little<00:05:12.400> while<00:05:12.669> ago<00:05:12.849> but<00:05:13.300> he<00:05:13.539> you<00:05:14.499> know<00:05:14.650> you

little while ago but he you know you
might<00:05:15.520> argue<00:05:15.639> there's<00:05:16.029> some<00:05:16.240> similarities

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:16.449 
might argue there's some similarities

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:20.119 
might argue there's some similarities
there<00:05:17.110> but<00:05:17.379> but<00:05:18.309> as<00:05:18.490> of<00:05:18.639> recently<00:05:19.149> he<00:05:19.449> hasn't

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.409 
he hasn't fought anyone with that kind
of<00:05:22.569> mix<00:05:22.949> so<00:05:23.949> I<00:05:23.979> just<00:05:24.430> I<00:05:24.639> think<00:05:24.789> it<00:05:25.180> would<00:05:25.270> be

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:25.419 
of mix so I just I think it would be

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:27.570 
of mix so I just I think it would be
interesting<00:05:25.539> I<00:05:26.050> I<00:05:26.080> think<00:05:26.559> in<00:05:26.680> the<00:05:26.800> end<00:05:26.830> to<00:05:27.430> be

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:27.580 
interesting I I think in the end to be

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:33.149 
interesting I I think in the end to be
honest<00:05:27.909> I<00:05:28.229> think<00:05:29.229> again<00:05:30.419> Khan<00:05:31.419> speed<00:05:32.159> will

00:05:33.149 --> 00:05:33.159 
honest I think again Khan speed will

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:35.549 
honest I think again Khan speed will
overwhelm<00:05:33.939> Peterson<00:05:34.689> but<00:05:34.839> I<00:05:34.870> think<00:05:35.110> Peterson

00:05:35.549 --> 00:05:35.559 
overwhelm Peterson but I think Peterson

00:05:35.559 --> 00:05:39.049 
overwhelm Peterson but I think Peterson
will<00:05:35.680> definitely<00:05:36.159> put<00:05:36.999> in<00:05:37.149> a<00:05:37.270> good<00:05:37.479> show<00:05:37.839> and

00:05:39.049 --> 00:05:39.059 
will definitely put in a good show and

00:05:39.059 --> 00:05:45.450 
will definitely put in a good show and
it'll<00:05:40.059> be<00:05:40.180> relatively<00:05:40.719> close<00:05:43.080> if<00:05:44.080> Khan<00:05:44.919> stops

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:45.460 
it'll be relatively close if Khan stops

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:52.800 
it'll be relatively close if Khan stops
Peterson<00:05:46.240> it'll<00:05:46.779> be<00:05:46.930> very<00:05:47.259> late<00:05:48.779> and<00:05:51.810> very

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:52.810 
Peterson it'll be very late and very

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:56.369 
Peterson it'll be very late and very
late<00:05:53.139> I<00:05:53.520> think<00:05:54.520> Peterson<00:05:54.939> stays<00:05:55.209> in<00:05:55.449> it<00:05:55.599> to<00:05:56.259> be

00:05:56.369 --> 00:05:56.379 
late I think Peterson stays in it to be

00:05:56.379 --> 00:06:01.920 
late I think Peterson stays in it to be
honest<00:05:56.709> I<00:05:56.860> just<00:05:57.279> think<00:05:57.459> he's<00:05:57.669> got<00:06:00.240> many<00:06:01.240> many

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:01.930 
honest I just think he's got many many

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:06.540 
honest I just think he's got many many
more<00:06:02.199> moves<00:06:02.610> many<00:06:03.610> more<00:06:04.620> he<00:06:05.620> just<00:06:05.830> adjusts<00:06:06.399> and

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:06.550 
more moves many more he just adjusts and

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:08.119 
more moves many more he just adjusts and
conch<00:06:06.819> comes<00:06:07.089> in<00:06:07.240> and<00:06:07.419> does<00:06:07.539> one<00:06:07.810> thing

00:06:08.119 --> 00:06:08.129 
conch comes in and does one thing

00:06:08.129 --> 00:06:10.889 
conch comes in and does one thing
basically<00:06:09.129> with<00:06:09.580> a<00:06:09.610> few<00:06:09.909> tweaks<00:06:10.209> and<00:06:10.479> twists

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:10.899 
basically with a few tweaks and twists

00:06:10.899 --> 00:06:13.290 
basically with a few tweaks and twists
here<00:06:11.110> but<00:06:11.860> overall<00:06:12.159> he<00:06:12.490> pretty<00:06:12.699> much<00:06:12.789> does<00:06:13.120> the

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:13.300 
here but overall he pretty much does the

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:16.140 
here but overall he pretty much does the
same<00:06:13.509> thing<00:06:13.779> every<00:06:14.080> fight

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:16.150 
same thing every fight

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:19.260 
same thing every fight
that's<00:06:16.720> the<00:06:16.810> way<00:06:16.930> I<00:06:16.960> see<00:06:17.230> it
