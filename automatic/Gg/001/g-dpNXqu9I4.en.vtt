00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 Hello everyone , I somehow had an idea to do 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.200
 sharpener for sharpening knives with a small length 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.090
 blade less than 100 millimeters but 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.200
 using two home sharpeners for different 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.460
 knives is inconvenient and inappropriate 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.490
 so the idea came to do for 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.960
 existing sharpeners simple 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:22.199
 additional mount for small knives 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:25.140
 and the most important thing is that this mount has become 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.570
 convenient turning device for a knife 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.460
 mount is very simple consists of here 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.500
 such two absolutely identical plates 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.239
 4 millimeter thick difference only in 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.790
 holes here she is 6 half 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:39.780
 mm and here m6 thread and more 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:42.030
 there is no difference well, this plate is closer 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.829
 on this side I stuck thin 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.780
 rubber so as not to scratch the blade when 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.840
 mechanical mount but also seen from the side 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.120
 that on the plate is made the second bevel 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.199
 plate is completely identical only with 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.180
 M6 thread 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:01:01.670
 also the resina is glued the same bevel 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:05.930
 I will connect these two plates of bolts on m6 and 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:08.700
 I'll get this mount already assembled 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.640
 by the way the plates need to make so 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:15.090
 to have a very important rear end 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.890
 the plane was flush without any 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.840
 projections and it is desirable that the side 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.240
 the surfaces were flush too 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:26.159
 but not as critical as the back 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:29.310
 put the back end of the attachment 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:32.610
 any plate i have is a piece 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:36.049
 rubber she will perform the function here 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.049
 clamping lever 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:50.480
 Now I will fix the knife itself, the length of the blade 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.790
 it's 90 millimeters using this 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:57.650
 mounts can sharpen a knife with a length 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:02:00.140
 blade only 50 millimeters at assembly 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.160
 it is very important to observe the plane of Nastya 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.670
 two rear 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:07.070
 end surfaces need it for 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.730
 sharpening angle accuracy when turning 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.730
 mounts 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:19.189
 Well, it turned out quite reliable form 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:20.420
 mechanical attachment of the knife for this 

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:21.379
 I use my type of attachment 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.090
 combo drag 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:24.829
 review did earlier link will be description 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.810
 base here and will serve 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:29.000
 this is the butt of its clamping and auxiliary 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.040
 the two sides of the stops will always be working 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.430
 dorsal side when turning mount 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.680
 toris and the other side now 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:40.010
 I set the very fastening of the knife in 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.629
 sharpener so that she rested against these two 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.730
 parties 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:45.950
 due to these two stops 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:51.739
 mounting on the magnet becomes even 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:57.430
 more reliable and still cast like 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:57.430
 usually sharpen one side of the knife 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:04.209
 dragged overturned 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:18.930
 now we have these two basic sides and 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:27.959
 Similarly, we sharpen the second side 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:31.290
 clicking on but once again demonstrate 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:34.260
 convenience of fixing and turning this 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:37.290
 clamp by the way 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:41.930
 basic sides can be selected 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:44.040
 any important thing that they know during the coup 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:47.640
 respected and symmetrical about 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:49.709
 axles and beds as you already understood for 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.570
 This type of knife attachment uses 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:53.580
 Teacher with a magnet can advantage 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.530
 carry what yours doesn't interact 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.360
 directly with a magnet but still fixed 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.580
 mechanically also in this clip is convenient 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.069
 sharpen knives with or uneven butt 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:04.140
 blade 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:06.000
 it is very important in the manufacture to make these 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.000
 two plates of the same thickness 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.019
 this is necessary so that when clamping the knife 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.360
 about this axis 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:14.370
 there were completely identical angles of these 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.440
 plates on the outside 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.630
 thus the angle of sharpening the knife when 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.640
 the fastener coup will be the same 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.410
 from two sides on this principle can 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.979
 make a mount for longer 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.350
 knives 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:27.030
 I 'll leave the drawings for this mount man 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:29.570
 at the end of the video I have all thanks to all 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.570
 good luck
