00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
fast over in Maine number one as we take

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.400 
fast over in Maine number one as we take
a<00:02:17.490> look<00:02:17.610> at<00:02:17.760> the<00:02:17.820> girls<00:02:18.030> underneath<00:02:18.510> the<00:02:19.200> water

the first 50 is just a fifty to

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.340 
the first 50 is just a fifty to
establish<00:02:21.510> yourself<00:02:21.840> you<00:02:21.900> don't<00:02:22.080> want<00:02:22.200> to<00:02:22.260> go

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
establish yourself you don't want to go

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
the groove of your stroke as we turn

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.380 
the groove of your stroke as we turn
it's<00:02:26.010> actually<00:02:26.310> Megan<00:02:26.460> a<00:02:26.760> that<00:02:27.000> goes<00:02:27.150> around

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
it's actually Megan a that goes around

first 30.1 - that's a nice first 50
meter<00:02:30.210> split<00:02:30.540> so<00:02:38.510> underwater<00:02:39.510> work<00:02:39.720> we<00:02:39.900> saw

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
meter split so underwater work we saw

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.630 
meter split so underwater work we saw
off<00:02:40.320> that<00:02:40.470> start<00:02:40.770> how<00:02:41.010> good<00:02:41.220> they<00:02:41.370> actually

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640

the<00:03:15.300> her<00:03:15.450> second<00:03:15.930> 100<00:03:16.470> is<00:03:16.590> probably<00:03:17.070> normally

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
the her second 100 is probably normally

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.820 
the her second 100 is probably normally
as<00:03:17.730> good<00:03:17.910> as<00:03:18.000> their<00:03:18.150> first<00:03:18.360> 100<00:03:18.930> so<00:03:19.140> if<00:03:19.590> she's

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
as good as their first 100 so if she's

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.040 
as good as their first 100 so if she's
gone<00:03:20.010> out<00:03:20.190> in<00:03:20.310> the<00:03:20.370> 103<00:03:20.940> 104<00:03:21.510> then<00:03:21.780> you<00:03:21.900> would

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
gone out in the 103 104 then you would

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:23.810 
gone out in the 103 104 then you would
look<00:03:22.200> that<00:03:22.470> she<00:03:22.650> would<00:03:22.800> be<00:03:22.920> around<00:03:23.160> till<00:03:23.400> 8<00:03:23.580> to

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
look that she would be around till 8 to

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.820 
look that she would be around till 8 to
9<00:03:24.060> but<00:03:24.360> Megan<00:03:24.990> I<00:03:25.080> think<00:03:25.110> that's<00:03:25.500> actually<00:03:25.800> a

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
9 but Megan I think that's actually a

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.320 
9 but Megan I think that's actually a
really<00:03:26.040> good<00:03:26.280> first<00:03:26.550> split<00:03:26.850> for<00:03:27.030> her

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
really good first split for her

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.960 
really good first split for her
102<00:03:27.630> 66<00:03:28.560> she's<00:03:29.100> held<00:03:29.310> it<00:03:29.460> together<00:03:29.610> really

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
102 66 she's held it together really

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.320 
102 66 she's held it together really
nicely<00:03:30.270> here<00:03:30.720> -<00:03:30.960> let's<00:03:31.530> take<00:03:31.710> a<00:03:31.740> look<00:03:31.920> one<00:03:32.330> 3484

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
nicely here - let's take a look one 3484

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.630 
nicely here - let's take a look one 3484
so<00:03:33.660> you<00:03:33.720> are<00:03:33.960> looking<00:03:34.290> at<00:03:34.410> around<00:03:34.500> about<00:03:34.770> a<00:03:34.950> 208

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
so you are looking at around about a 208

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.990 
so you are looking at around about a 208
and<00:03:36.390> of<00:03:36.510> course<00:03:36.690> Megan

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
and of course Megan

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.850 
and of course Megan
said<00:03:38.300> he<00:03:38.420> was<00:03:38.510> very<00:03:38.660> stronger<00:03:39.230> than<00:03:39.380> Christ<00:03:39.680> on

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
said he was very stronger than Christ on

with the recent miss Johnson tried it

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:44.740 
with the recent miss Johnson tried it
back<00:03:42.950> on<00:03:43.100> the<00:03:43.190> backstroke<00:03:43.550> a<00:03:43.880> little<00:03:44.300> more<00:03:44.480> and

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
back on the backstroke a little more and

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.570 
back on the backstroke a little more and
she's<00:03:44.930> back<00:03:45.110> in<00:03:45.320> form<00:03:45.560> here<00:03:45.800> and<00:03:45.830> really<00:03:46.310> doing
