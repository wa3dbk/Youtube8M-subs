00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
warm and then proceeded to see how it's

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.809 
warm and then proceeded to see how it's
like<00:03:27.079> separated<00:03:27.620> into<00:03:27.709> like<00:03:27.920> five<00:03:28.489> six

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:28.819 
like separated into like five six

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:35.860 
like separated into like five six
sections<00:03:29.030> Sam<00:03:29.660> and<00:03:29.930> so<00:03:30.769> um<00:03:31.329> I<00:03:33.940> put<00:03:34.940> the<00:03:35.420> I

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.720 
sections Sam and so um I put the I
probably<00:03:36.350> shouldn't<00:03:36.739> did<00:03:36.859> my<00:03:36.980> part<00:03:37.220> and<00:03:37.430> you

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
know that's what i'm thinking i might

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.539 
know that's what i'm thinking i might
not<00:03:39.650> like<00:03:39.889> but<00:03:40.160> uh<00:03:41.200> so<00:03:42.200> I<00:03:42.680> had<00:03:43.069> like<00:03:43.190> put<00:03:43.459> the

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:43.549 
not like but uh so I had like put the

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:46.199 
not like but uh so I had like put the
blow<00:03:43.760> dryer<00:03:43.940> on<00:03:44.209> it<00:03:44.510> so<00:03:44.870> for<00:03:45.079> not<00:03:45.230> that<00:03:45.470> long

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
blow dryer on it so for not that long

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:49.449 
blow dryer on it so for not that long
because<00:03:47.209> he<00:03:47.690> was<00:03:47.900> just<00:03:48.440> damp<00:03:48.799> and<00:03:49.100> so<00:03:49.250> it's

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 
because he was just damp and so it's

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:51.699 
because he was just damp and so it's
kind<00:03:49.700> of<00:03:49.760> like<00:03:49.880> that<00:03:50.209> in<00:03:50.480> between<00:03:50.660> of<00:03:51.109> life<00:03:51.319> dry

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
kind of like that in between of life dry

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:53.140 
kind of like that in between of life dry
too<00:03:51.769> damp<00:03:52.130> because<00:03:52.370> I<00:03:52.430> didn't<00:03:52.730> want<00:03:52.760> it<00:03:52.880> super

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
too damp because I didn't want it super

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.360 
too damp because I didn't want it super
keeper<00:03:53.870> wet<00:03:54.049> because<00:03:54.680> I<00:03:54.799> wanted<00:03:55.040> to<00:03:55.100> have

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
keeper wet because I wanted to have

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.729 
keeper wet because I wanted to have
enough<00:03:55.609> time<00:03:55.760> to<00:03:55.819> dry<00:03:56.209> and<00:03:56.510> most<00:03:57.349> likely<00:03:57.500> I

00:03:57.729 --> 00:03:57.739 
enough time to dry and most likely I

00:03:57.739 --> 00:03:59.979 
enough time to dry and most likely I
would<00:03:57.950> do<00:03:58.130> this<00:03:58.310> style<00:03:58.609> again<00:03:58.910> on<00:03:59.389> dry<00:03:59.959> hair

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 
would do this style again on dry hair

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:02.979 
would do this style again on dry hair
like<00:04:00.620> my<00:04:00.799> day<00:04:00.859> for<00:04:01.040> hair<00:04:01.579> and<00:04:01.790> a<00:04:02.239> be<00:04:02.510> even
