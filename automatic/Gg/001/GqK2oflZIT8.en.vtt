ok to install ram generally you would

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.820 
ok to install ram generally you would
open<00:00:03.120> up<00:00:03.240> your<00:00:03.419> computer<00:00:03.659> case<00:00:03.990> again<00:00:04.680> make

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
open up your computer case again make

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.950 
open up your computer case again make
sure<00:00:04.890> you're<00:00:05.220> grounded<00:00:05.790> so<00:00:06.060> that<00:00:06.270> anything

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
sure you're grounded so that anything

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.480 
sure you're grounded so that anything
that<00:00:07.109> you<00:00:07.350> touch<00:00:07.529> on<00:00:07.740> the<00:00:07.859> motherboard<00:00:08.130> does

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
that you touch on the motherboard does

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:09.910 
that you touch on the motherboard does
not<00:00:08.639> get<00:00:08.820> statically<00:00:09.269> shocked<00:00:09.570> and

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:09.920 
not get statically shocked and

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.129 
not get statically shocked and
automatically<00:00:10.920> made<00:00:11.160> into<00:00:11.400> a<00:00:11.429> paperweight

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:12.139 
automatically made into a paperweight

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:14.620 
automatically made into a paperweight
the<00:00:13.139> first<00:00:13.380> thing<00:00:13.530> that<00:00:13.620> you<00:00:13.710> wanted<00:00:13.889> to<00:00:13.980> do<00:00:14.099> is

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:14.630 
the first thing that you wanted to do is

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:18.609 
the first thing that you wanted to do is
locate<00:00:15.630> where<00:00:15.990> the<00:00:16.020> RAM<00:00:16.230> goes<00:00:16.470> so<00:00:16.920> in<00:00:17.820> my<00:00:17.940> case

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:18.619 
locate where the RAM goes so in my case

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:21.230 
locate where the RAM goes so in my case
we<00:00:19.619> have<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:20.010> CPU<00:00:20.400> here<00:00:20.670> this<00:00:20.820> is<00:00:20.910> for<00:00:20.939> this

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
we have the CPU here this is for this

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.590 
we have the CPU here this is for this
big<00:00:21.600> giant<00:00:21.840> heatsink<00:00:22.470> is<00:00:22.939> and<00:00:23.939> then<00:00:24.180> to<00:00:24.480> the

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
big giant heatsink is and then to the

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.920 
big giant heatsink is and then to the
left<00:00:24.810> or<00:00:25.430> sometimes<00:00:26.430> across<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:26.849> bottom<00:00:27.029> very

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
left or sometimes across the bottom very

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.439 
left or sometimes across the bottom very
near<00:00:28.320> to<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.590> processor<00:00:29.160> you'll<00:00:29.789> see<00:00:30.090> a

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
near to the processor you'll see a

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.700 
near to the processor you'll see a
couple<00:00:30.750> of<00:00:30.960> slots<00:00:31.230> long<00:00:31.769> slots<00:00:32.189> like<00:00:32.460> this<00:00:32.730> and

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
couple of slots long slots like this and

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.410 
couple of slots long slots like this and
there<00:00:34.710> if<00:00:35.010> there<00:00:35.340> are<00:00:35.430> more<00:00:35.579> than<00:00:35.760> two<00:00:36.090> slots

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
there if there are more than two slots

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.170 
there if there are more than two slots
you'll<00:00:36.840> see<00:00:37.050> them<00:00:37.230> color-coded<00:00:37.860> in<00:00:38.520> my<00:00:38.760> case<00:00:39.000> I

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
you'll see them color-coded in my case I

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.860 
you'll see them color-coded in my case I
have<00:00:39.300> blue<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:39.780> black<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:41.059> that's<00:00:42.059> for<00:00:42.480> when

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
have blue and black and that's for when

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.500 
have blue and black and that's for when
you<00:00:43.020> put<00:00:43.860> more<00:00:44.129> than<00:00:44.250> one<00:00:44.309> stick<00:00:44.850> of<00:00:44.969> ram<00:00:45.210> in

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
you put more than one stick of ram in

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.440 
you put more than one stick of ram in
there<00:00:45.809> you<00:00:46.440> need<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.710> match<00:00:46.950> up<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.219> size<00:00:47.640> with

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
there you need to match up the size with

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.040 
there you need to match up the size with
each<00:00:48.629> slot<00:00:49.020> so<00:00:49.920> slots<00:00:50.219> one<00:00:50.700> in<00:00:50.969> three<00:00:51.510> go

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
each slot so slots one in three go

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.069 
each slot so slots one in three go
together<00:00:52.230> so<00:00:52.770> if<00:00:52.920> i<00:00:53.160> had<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.820> 512<00:00:54.600> megabytes

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
together so if i had to 512 megabytes

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.810 
together so if i had to 512 megabytes
tix<00:00:55.440> i'm<00:00:56.010> gonna<00:00:56.160> make<00:00:56.280> sure<00:00:56.430> that<00:00:56.610> they<00:00:56.699> go

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
tix i'm gonna make sure that they go

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.119 
tix i'm gonna make sure that they go
here<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.390> i've<00:00:57.510> had<00:00:57.539> gigabyte<00:00:58.079> sticks<00:00:58.379> i<00:00:58.620> want

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
here and i've had gigabyte sticks i want

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.500 
here and i've had gigabyte sticks i want
to<00:00:59.190> make<00:00:59.280> sure<00:00:59.340> that<00:00:59.460> they<00:00:59.730> matched<00:00:59.969> up<00:01:00.239> and

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
to make sure that they matched up and

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.520 
to make sure that they matched up and
went<00:01:00.750> two<00:01:01.050> slots<00:01:01.649> two<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:02.070> four<00:01:03.110> so<00:01:04.110> basically

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
went two slots two and four so basically

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.649 
went two slots two and four so basically
make<00:01:04.799> sure<00:01:04.949> that<00:01:05.129> you're<00:01:05.250> grounded<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:05.729> snap

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
make sure that you're grounded and snap

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.730 
make sure that you're grounded and snap
in<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:08.180> memory<00:01:09.180> modules<00:01:09.659> they<00:01:10.350> will<00:01:10.500> snap

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
in the the memory modules they will snap

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.490 
in the the memory modules they will snap
in<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.220> then<00:01:11.400> these<00:01:11.670> two<00:01:12.200> these<00:01:13.200> white

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
in and then these two these white

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.679 
in and then these two these white
latches<00:01:13.920> here<00:01:14.250> will<00:01:14.520> snap<00:01:14.610> into<00:01:14.760> place<00:01:15.119> and

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
latches here will snap into place and

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.410 
latches here will snap into place and
there<00:01:16.380> are<00:01:16.500> notches<00:01:16.920> on<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.159> memory<00:01:17.790> modules

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
there are notches on the memory modules

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.170 
there are notches on the memory modules
that<00:01:18.570> will<00:01:18.930> snap<00:01:19.590> with<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.520> latches<00:01:20.909> here

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
that will snap with the latches here

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.289 
that will snap with the latches here
they're<00:01:21.509> pretty<00:01:21.689> universal<00:01:22.580> if<00:01:23.580> they<00:01:23.909> don't

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
they're pretty universal if they don't

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.740 
they're pretty universal if they don't
fit<00:01:24.810> do<00:01:25.650> not<00:01:25.799> force<00:01:26.100> them<00:01:26.310> in<00:01:26.570> flip<00:01:27.570> them

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
fit do not force them in flip them

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.960 
fit do not force them in flip them
around<00:01:27.950> because<00:01:28.950> even<00:01:29.340> though<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.700> slots

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
around because even though the slots

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.460 
around because even though the slots
look<00:01:30.240> like<00:01:30.420> they're<00:01:30.540> evenly<00:01:30.869> spaced<00:01:31.259> out

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
look like they're evenly spaced out

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.380 
look like they're evenly spaced out
between<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:32.070> two<00:01:32.100> dividers<00:01:32.700> that<00:01:32.729> are<00:01:32.909> in<00:01:33.119> in

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
between the two dividers that are in in

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.830 
between the two dividers that are in in
the<00:01:33.900> plastic<00:01:34.409> here<00:01:34.650> they're<00:01:34.950> not<00:01:35.180> so<00:01:36.180> one<00:01:36.600> side

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
the plastic here they're not so one side

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.679 
the plastic here they're not so one side
is<00:01:37.170> longer<00:01:37.500> than<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.009> other<00:01:38.220> side<00:01:38.490> so<00:01:39.210> flip

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
is longer than the other side so flip

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.420 
is longer than the other side so flip
them<00:01:39.840> around<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:40.380> then<00:01:40.590> pop<00:01:40.920> it<00:01:40.950> in<00:01:41.130> there<00:01:41.280> and

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
them around and then pop it in there and

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.520 
them around and then pop it in there and
then<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:42.299> white<00:01:42.450> latches<00:01:42.780> will<00:01:42.899> come<00:01:43.049> up<00:01:43.200> and

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
then the white latches will come up and

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.219 
then the white latches will come up and
pop<00:01:43.680> into<00:01:43.920> place<00:01:44.930> one<00:01:45.930> thing<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.140> remember

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
pop into place one thing to remember

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.410 
pop into place one thing to remember
about<00:01:46.590> installing<00:01:47.130> memory<00:01:47.549> is<00:01:47.700> make<00:01:48.180> sure<00:01:48.210> you

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
about installing memory is make sure you

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.710 
about installing memory is make sure you
get<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.630> right<00:01:48.659> speed<00:01:49.259> of<00:01:49.470> memory<00:01:50.689> make<00:01:51.689> sure

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
get the right speed of memory make sure

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.149 
get the right speed of memory make sure
your<00:01:51.990> motherboard<00:01:52.350> supports<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.950> right

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159

speed as well so if you go out and you
buy<00:01:56.930> 667<00:01:57.930> megahertz<00:01:58.850> speed<00:01:59.850> memory<00:02:00.540> make<00:02:01.439> sure

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
buy 667 megahertz speed memory make sure

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:02.899 
buy 667 megahertz speed memory make sure
that<00:02:01.770> your<00:02:01.890> motherboard<00:02:02.310> can<00:02:02.460> support<00:02:02.790> that

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
that your motherboard can support that

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.600 
that your motherboard can support that
speed<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:03.600> also<00:02:04.439> if<00:02:04.950> you<00:02:05.070> buy<00:02:05.189> more<00:02:05.430> than<00:02:05.490> one

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
speed and also if you buy more than one

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.580 
speed and also if you buy more than one
stick<00:02:06.000> make<00:02:06.240> sure<00:02:06.270> they<00:02:06.509> match<00:02:06.750> in<00:02:07.020> capacity

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
stick make sure they match in capacity

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.580 
stick make sure they match in capacity
so<00:02:08.220> 5<00:02:08.459> 12<00:02:08.729> matches<00:02:09.209> with<00:02:09.509> 512<00:02:09.989> one<00:02:10.259> gigabyte

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
so 5 12 matches with 512 one gigabyte

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.740 
so 5 12 matches with 512 one gigabyte
just<00:02:11.009> going<00:02:11.310> day<00:02:11.430> by<00:02:11.459> someone<00:02:11.910> so<00:02:12.060> forth

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
just going day by someone so forth

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.120 
just going day by someone so forth
that's<00:02:13.380> pretty<00:02:13.530> much<00:02:13.680> how<00:02:13.830> you<00:02:13.860> install

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
that's pretty much how you install

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.520 
that's pretty much how you install
