festival<00:01:15.469> in<00:01:15.979> Sheffield<00:01:16.429> I<00:01:16.640> think<00:01:16.880> it's<00:01:17.000> a

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
festival in Sheffield I think it's a

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.969 
festival in Sheffield I think it's a
really<00:01:17.329> good<00:01:17.450> idea<00:01:17.509> actually<00:01:17.990> like<00:01:18.380> I<00:01:18.619> think

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
really good idea actually like I think

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:22.719 
really good idea actually like I think
if<00:01:19.340> every<00:01:20.210> city<00:01:21.049> tried<00:01:21.469> to<00:01:21.679> do<00:01:21.860> a<00:01:22.159> free

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
if every city tried to do a free

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:24.429 
if every city tried to do a free
festival<00:01:23.060> it<00:01:23.600> probably<00:01:23.869> wouldn't<00:01:24.049> work<00:01:24.229> as

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:24.439 
festival it probably wouldn't work as

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:26.620 
festival it probably wouldn't work as
well<00:01:24.619> as<00:01:24.799> it<00:01:25.399> has<00:01:25.549> here<00:01:25.909> like<00:01:26.119> the<00:01:26.240> cities

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630
