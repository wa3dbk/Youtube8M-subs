00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700
 it's an experience 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.460
 for whom no other concert togo format than five gold concertos for our 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:08.649
 man anyway three pianists 

00:00:08.649 --> 00:00:10.889
 many of these applicants 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.389
 but especially with a good force from the spiritual city natan who is 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:16.509
 so much I think it's the same for the public 

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:19.279
 the manceaux who will want 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:22.730
 I remember very well sector 80 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:23.980
 riccardo chailly 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.230
 he asked me if I was interested you learn what I did not know 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.390
 him also moreover the time proof the 3d there it is miseries 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.640
 at the time it was to play it first in Bologna after the end of my 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.239
 life I played it was at the theater corona poland were directly 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:38.220
 g4 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.750
 and then we did it with their pc to know how well 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.320
 in this case saved 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.880
 while on the head also surrounded 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.060
 e but what is more interested in me obviously I 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:49.150
 knew 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.990
 this sluggish facts on which exist and with the mayor's agreement it's true that 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:56.530
 this announcement was neither to sell at a loss to become lovers in the case 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.990
 meanings that I started by the remote MP the partition what 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.990
 I was very scared right away 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.940
 I've always loved music but on the sundae it's an opportunity 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.410
 in my life to learn what really was extraordinary I have to 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.920
 really do it I'm really going to really want to do it it's someone who 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.270
 really had 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.150
 to find a 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:17.950
 he wanted to stay 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.650
 really just nor to anyone else who is writing music 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.200
 as it is it is the harmonic richness the agreements that use it 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.330
 for what benefited the whole discussion about birds that has it 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.220
 left this fascination for birds and seven major themes field 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:30.869
 for birds 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.310
 in the sixth month for example what does not fail to emphasize aquitaine 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.119
 brittany you have seized following this one as you know what 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:39.930
 and south 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.810
 the bark of studies long martenot his whole and south that the piano that makes 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.510
 his songs of birds for 12 minutes 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.180
 what is a real moment rowing moments of his family 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:50.229
 who always says 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:51.530
 there we have to look 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.530
 you are looking for people of different colors and a variety 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:57.280
 e girl on their text headset 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.110
 Sunday in the flanders' tour 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.630
 I think of 100 French musicians with a lot of percussion 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.840
 of instruments are not often used in the teeth the arts first 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.220
 concerts be not the first rehearsal the first time I was 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.019
 sitting at the piano and I heard 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:12.230
 all this music around me but it was something 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.179
 extraordinary 

00:02:14.179 --> 00:02:18.009
 I really have to say that it's him science his wife madam 

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:21.659
 marion was absolutely amazing me is there a generosity 

00:02:22.419 --> 00:02:26.039
 in their time in their advice I obviously right away when I 

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:29.599
 started to learn figeac pieces the votes right away and I 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:33.069
 said here I believe you and here can I come to see you 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:34.449
 i am proud to have paris 

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:37.409
 she gave me her score at the time it was so nice 

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:41.639
 bast his score as the score the first edition in lack of 49 

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:44.799
 with all and must count with his pedals all the annotations of 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:46.939
 corrections every six years scored 

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:50.139
 m I think she lent to cooperate fully with the boy 

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:52.799
 was in the game that's a lot in his city remains to be won a lot 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:53.559
 of time 

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:56.179
 and then you will see it many times 

00:02:56.179 --> 00:02:59.319
 % she gave me he normally board 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:02.849
 that's what counts it's not a lot of advice 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:04.309
 and then it was 

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:07.589
 this information is studied very big risks 

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:08.679
 he was not saying much 

00:03:08.679 --> 00:03:10.529
 we do not talk much while playable 

00:03:10.529 --> 00:03:12.939
 because he has nothing to say what he liked what he did not like 

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:15.719
 but then if we start asking myself more specific questions started 

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:18.719
 to speak after the speaker manufacturer and half had to really 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:20.800
 it's not someone who 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.790
 right now she by cons we always had plenty to say the one 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:24.929
 who was very calm 

00:03:24.929 --> 00:03:27.799
 very posed and it really had to ask me specific questions limited to 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:28.509
 put here 

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:31.359
 do you think about the future of pensions 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:34.789
 and then it was really great it was a little too much 

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:39.799
 and then he had to come in. It fits the favor of the tram in 1992 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:42.709
 and unfortunately he's starting to hurt the best he's just died 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:46.599
 me after all we did the recording is said end of January in 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:48.169
 february soul amsterdam 

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:50.099
 he could not get over a year 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:51.869
 they really belonged 

00:03:51.869 --> 00:03:55.189
 of the project both I mean this land a privilege that is 

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:58.219
 someone who was completely 

00:03:58.219 --> 00:04:01.339
 practically another world so by a few times from him 

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:04.769
 since by the innovations he was there he who was not quite there 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:08.840
 on facebook he was and listen to you he had so many things that so m 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.269
 in his head it was really maybe exceptional
