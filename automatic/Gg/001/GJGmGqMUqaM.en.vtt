00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 hello friends and youtube subscribers in 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.560
 this time I will show you how to make a 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:11.280
 nice ornament either for your tree 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.070
 Christmas or for the Christmas holidays 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.390
 materials that we will use will be 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:20.189
 paper circles can be metallic or 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.560
 normal paper in this case I have 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.080
 metallic one side red color and 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.270
 another white 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:29.380
 a needle 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:34.210
 with about half a meter of thread 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:36.430
 and a stapler or stapler 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:39.399
 The first thing we will do is to fold 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:43.949
 our circles if they have two 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:43.949
 colors the color must go inside 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:52.200
 we will fold in half 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.200
 in this way and again 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:00.530
 in half 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:02.870
 we unfold and take our in 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.630
 stapler our stapler and you 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.960
 we will put a staple for the brand of 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:11.350
 our fold 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:13.520
 in this way well and the following is 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:20.200
 open 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:20.200
 the tips doubling the way 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:27.840
 well we unfolded the other 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.840
 and we open it 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.750
 to obtain this figure we will perform the 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.660
 same procedure with others 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.580
 circles once all finished 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:44.000
 our circles in this case I have 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:47.360
 done eight we will take our needle and the 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:51.190
 figures in such a way that we will insert 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:53.980
 the needle by this vertex 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:56.240
 where our fold passes almost 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:58.549
 reaching the tip 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:02.030
 we will put and hal we will make our thread 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:07.030
 leaving approximately 10 centimeters 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.030
 well we will continue putting the pieces 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.950
 and we will push it 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.540
 so we will put all the pieces in the 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.790
 thread 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.870
 once he put all the pieces in 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.870
 we will do is push the 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:33.300
 to press them a bit is not 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:36.300
 need to tighten it very hard 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:40.010
 and already having all the pieces together 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.010
 What we will do is tie our thread 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.290
 all right 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.610
 and with the help of the scissors we will cut 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.610
 this remaining 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:00.470
 on the side of the needle we will cut the needle 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.450
 and we'll make a small knot on this side 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:16.630
 and finally what we have to do is 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:20.880
 open our figures a little 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.880
 to give volume to the sphere 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:30.790
 all right 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.290
 good friends this has been everything I hope 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.480
 that you have liked do not forget 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:38.490

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.490
 like see you next time bye
