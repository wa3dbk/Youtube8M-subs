on the MPEG version this one is 317
megabytes<00:01:45.930> and<00:01:46.140> it's<00:01:46.649> 10<00:01:46.920> minutes<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:47.310> 50

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
megabytes and it's 10 minutes and 50

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.940 
megabytes and it's 10 minutes and 50
seconds<00:01:47.939> long<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:48.470> right<00:01:49.470> here<00:01:49.619> this<00:01:49.770> is<00:01:49.829> the

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
seconds long and right here this is the

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.710 
seconds long and right here this is the
avi<00:01:50.280> version<00:01:50.700> of<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:50.850> exact<00:01:51.149> same<00:01:51.329> video<00:01:51.570> as

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
avi version of the exact same video as

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.980 
avi version of the exact same video as
you<00:01:52.290> can<00:01:52.380> see<00:01:52.560> it's<00:01:52.680> a<00:01:52.860> lot<00:01:53.310> larger<00:01:53.540> 2.51<00:01:54.540> gigs

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
you can see it's a lot larger 2.51 gigs

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.520 
you can see it's a lot larger 2.51 gigs
and<00:01:55.259> it<00:01:56.250> also<00:01:56.430> took<00:01:56.610> about<00:01:56.969> 17<00:01:57.570> minutes<00:01:57.780> and<00:01:58.170> 14

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
and it also took about 17 minutes and 14

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.280 
and it also took about 17 minutes and 14
seconds<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:58.979> render<00:01:59.719> now<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:00.780> math<00:02:01.079> on<00:02:01.229> that

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
seconds to render now the math on that

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.940 
seconds to render now the math on that
is<00:02:01.560> pretty<00:02:02.070> astounding<00:02:02.369> on<00:02:03.350> this<00:02:04.350> one<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.649> AVI

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
is pretty astounding on this one the AVI

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.069 
is pretty astounding on this one the AVI
this<00:02:05.460> is<00:02:05.640> about<00:02:05.759> eight<00:02:06.060> times<00:02:06.360> larger<00:02:06.689> than

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
this is about eight times larger than

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.680 
this is about eight times larger than
the<00:02:07.560> MPEG<00:02:07.920> version<00:02:08.310> and<00:02:08.459> it<00:02:09.030> takes<00:02:09.239> about<00:02:09.330> and

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
the MPEG version and it takes about and

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.540 
the MPEG version and it takes about and
it<00:02:10.379> takes<00:02:10.560> a<00:02:10.649> little<00:02:10.770> over<00:02:10.979> one<00:02:11.340> and<00:02:11.430> a<00:02:11.489> half

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
it takes a little over one and a half

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.700 
it takes a little over one and a half
times<00:02:11.690> longer<00:02:12.690> to<00:02:12.810> renders

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
times longer to renders

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.750 
times longer to renders
so<00:02:14.400> anyways<00:02:14.730> you<00:02:15.720> go<00:02:15.870> over<00:02:15.960> here<00:02:16.260> mpeg1<00:02:17.250> choose

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
so anyways you go over here mpeg1 choose

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.390 
so anyways you go over here mpeg1 choose
that<00:02:17.970> and<00:02:18.230> then<00:02:19.230> go<00:02:19.590> over<00:02:19.620> to<00:02:19.830> setting<00:02:20.280> and

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
that and then go over to setting and

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.130 
that and then go over to setting and
quality<00:02:20.790> and<00:02:20.970> make<00:02:21.570> sure<00:02:21.600> that<00:02:21.750> you<00:02:21.930> have<00:02:22.050> that

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
quality and make sure that you have that

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.980 
quality and make sure that you have that
on<00:02:22.290> high<00:02:22.500> quality<00:02:22.890> of<00:02:22.980> course<00:02:23.810> then<00:02:24.810> once

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
on high quality of course then once

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.240 
on high quality of course then once
you're<00:02:25.170> in<00:02:25.260> there<00:02:25.380> Gordon<00:02:25.590> settings<00:02:26.040> and

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
you're in there Gordon settings and

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.890 
you're in there Gordon settings and
you'll<00:02:26.730> make<00:02:26.910> sure<00:02:26.940> that<00:02:27.210> all<00:02:27.240> things<00:02:27.720> are

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
you'll make sure that all things are

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.320 
you'll make sure that all things are
kind<00:02:28.110> of<00:02:28.140> up<00:02:28.260> to<00:02:28.290> power<00:02:28.590> of<00:02:28.680> mine<00:02:28.860> real<00:02:29.040> quick

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
kind of up to power of mine real quick

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.760 
kind of up to power of mine real quick
such<00:02:30.330> as<00:02:30.480> video<00:02:30.690> resolution<00:02:31.260> change<00:02:31.620> that

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
such as video resolution change that

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.200 
such as video resolution change that
over<00:02:32.010> to<00:02:32.100> 1920<00:02:33.030> x<00:02:33.180> 1080<00:02:33.920> and<00:02:34.920> then<00:02:35.210> 29.97

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
over to 1920 x 1080 and then 29.97

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:39.440 
over to 1920 x 1080 and then 29.97
frames<00:02:36.540> per<00:02:36.960> second<00:02:38.000> then<00:02:39.000> over<00:02:39.240> here<00:02:39.270> you

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
frames per second then over here you

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.960 
frames per second then over here you
make<00:02:39.660> sure<00:02:39.780> that's<00:02:39.930> at<00:02:40.110> five<00:02:40.820> megabits<00:02:41.820> per

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
make sure that's at five megabits per

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.700 
make sure that's at five megabits per
second<00:02:42.420> you<00:02:42.810> can<00:02:42.960> change<00:02:43.140> that<00:02:43.290> if<00:02:43.350> you<00:02:43.500> want

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
second you can change that if you want

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.440 
second you can change that if you want
but<00:02:43.920> for<00:02:44.340> me<00:02:44.460> I<00:02:44.490> found<00:02:44.850> that<00:02:44.970> this<00:02:45.120> really

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
but for me I found that this really

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.030 
but for me I found that this really
works<00:02:45.690> and<00:02:45.990> then<00:02:46.230> of<00:02:46.350> course<00:02:46.380> go<00:02:46.740> to<00:02:46.800> audio

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
works and then of course go to audio

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.630 
works and then of course go to audio
sample<00:02:47.490> rate<00:02:47.580> at<00:02:47.730> 48<00:02:48.540> kilohertz<00:02:50.390> go<00:02:51.390> where

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
sample rate at 48 kilohertz go where

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.490 
sample rate at 48 kilohertz go where
alright<00:02:53.640> anyways<00:02:54.060> that<00:02:54.300> should<00:02:54.720> about<00:02:54.870> fix

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
alright anyways that should about fix

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.940 
alright anyways that should about fix
all<00:02:55.620> your<00:02:55.650> problems<00:02:55.770> for<00:02:56.640> now<00:02:56.790> at<00:02:56.850> least
