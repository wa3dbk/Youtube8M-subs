on going there we go all the way around
and<00:01:06.390> then<00:01:06.900> we're<00:01:07.049> going<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.200> be<00:01:07.610> you<00:01:08.610> need<00:01:08.729> a

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
and then we're going to be you need a

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.800 
and then we're going to be you need a
stealth<00:01:09.180> right<00:01:09.390> here<00:01:09.689> so<00:01:11.030> use<00:01:12.030> Batman<00:01:12.330> here

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
stealth right here so use Batman here

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.649 
stealth right here so use Batman here
we're<00:01:12.990> going<00:01:13.110> to<00:01:13.170> switch<00:01:13.470> over<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:13.920> the

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
we're going to switch over to the

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:21.440 
we're going to switch over to the
invisibility<00:01:15.659> in<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:17.100> censor<00:01:17.460> suit<00:01:20.360> there<00:01:21.360> we

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
invisibility in the censor suit there we

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.780 
invisibility in the censor suit there we
go<00:01:21.570> now<00:01:21.810> we're<00:01:21.960> going<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.110> walk<00:01:22.229> over<00:01:22.530> here

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
go now we're going to walk over here

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.780 
go now we're going to walk over here
flip<00:01:23.790> this<00:01:23.939> switch<00:01:25.100> turn<00:01:26.100> that<00:01:26.220> off<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:26.430> then

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
flip this switch turn that off and then

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.590 
flip this switch turn that off and then
I<00:01:26.880> switch<00:01:27.119> back<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.330> Plastic<00:01:27.810> Man

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.210 

and<00:01:32.230> we're<00:01:32.350> going<00:01:32.470> to<00:01:32.500> do<00:01:32.590> another<00:01:32.770> this<00:01:33.040> other

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
and we're going to do another this other

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.070 
and we're going to do another this other
plastic<00:01:33.729> man<00:01:33.909> pad<00:01:34.180> and<00:01:34.479> he's<00:01:34.690> going<00:01:34.810> to<00:01:34.900> turn

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
plastic man pad and he's going to turn

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.130 
plastic man pad and he's going to turn
into<00:01:35.970> looks<00:01:36.970> like<00:01:37.090> a<00:01:37.180> jackhammer<00:01:37.420> on<00:01:37.840> the<00:01:37.960> wall

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
into looks like a jackhammer on the wall
