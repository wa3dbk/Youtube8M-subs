saw<00:00:10.559> this<00:00:10.710> three<00:00:10.920> travel<00:00:11.190> RC<00:00:11.460> aircraft<00:00:11.580> that<00:00:11.969> I

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
saw this three travel RC aircraft that I

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.520 
saw this three travel RC aircraft that I
was<00:00:12.269> really<00:00:12.540> curious<00:00:12.870> I<00:00:13.139> just<00:00:13.290> had<00:00:13.410> to<00:00:13.469> know

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
was really curious I just had to know

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.499 
was really curious I just had to know
how<00:00:13.740> it<00:00:13.830> worked<00:00:14.009> you've<00:00:14.820> got<00:00:14.969> three<00:00:15.179> rotors

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
how it worked you've got three rotors

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.420 
how it worked you've got three rotors
here<00:00:15.719> these<00:00:16.020> two<00:00:16.260> are<00:00:16.289> the<00:00:16.379> back<00:00:16.650> this<00:00:17.190> is<00:00:17.400> the

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
here these two are the back this is the

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.970 
here these two are the back this is the
front<00:00:17.660> these<00:00:18.660> two<00:00:18.900> on<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.109> back<00:00:19.289> spin<00:00:19.740> in

front these two on the back spin in

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.800 
front these two on the back spin in
opposite<00:00:20.400> direction<00:00:20.550> so<00:00:21.000> they<00:00:21.359> counteract

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
opposite direction so they counteract

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.080 
opposite direction so they counteract
each<00:00:21.960> other's<00:00:22.230> torque<00:00:22.590> this<00:00:23.519> one<00:00:23.730> on<00:00:23.970> the

things you need to know about this

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.560 
things you need to know about this
aircraft<00:01:31.530> is<00:01:31.770> it<00:01:32.579> doesn't<00:01:33.030> like<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.329> fly<00:01:33.540> in

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
aircraft is it doesn't like to fly in

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.410 
aircraft is it doesn't like to fly in
Reverse<00:01:34.280> the<00:01:35.280> fact<00:01:35.490> that<00:01:35.640> all<00:01:35.729> these<00:01:35.939> engines

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
Reverse the fact that all these engines

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.200 
Reverse the fact that all these engines
are<00:01:36.659> tilted<00:01:37.049> at<00:01:37.500> different<00:01:38.250> angles<00:01:38.369> whenever

are tilted at different angles whenever
you<00:01:39.329> start<00:01:39.509> going<00:01:39.659> in<00:01:39.840> Reverse<00:01:40.110> it<00:01:40.350> kind<00:01:40.560> of

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
you start going in Reverse it kind of

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:41.990 
you start going in Reverse it kind of
wants<00:01:40.950> to<00:01:41.100> spin<00:01:41.520> around

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
wants to spin around

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.240

so<00:01:42.659> usually<00:01:43.200> whenever<00:01:43.500> you<00:01:43.680> started<00:01:43.979> out<00:01:44.070> you

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
so usually whenever you started out you

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.889 
so usually whenever you started out you
want<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.460> try<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.640> fly<00:01:44.939> just<00:01:45.240> slightly<00:01:45.600> forward

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
want to try to fly just slightly forward

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.719 
want to try to fly just slightly forward
and<00:01:46.140> you<00:01:46.259> do<00:01:46.409> that<00:01:46.619> by<00:01:46.860> spending<00:01:47.220> this<00:01:47.460> knob

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
and you do that by spending this knob

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.960 
and you do that by spending this knob
counterclockwise<00:01:48.540> just<00:01:49.530> a<00:01:50.280> tiny<00:01:50.460> little<00:01:50.729> bit

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
counterclockwise just a tiny little bit

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.630 
counterclockwise just a tiny little bit
you<00:01:51.600> usually<00:01:51.780> want<00:01:52.170> it

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
you usually want it

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.250 
you usually want it
a<00:01:52.700> little<00:01:53.240> bit<00:01:53.360> of<00:01:53.450> forward<00:01:53.720> motion<00:01:53.900> to<00:01:54.110> keep

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:54.260 
a little bit of forward motion to keep

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.710 
a little bit of forward motion to keep
it<00:01:54.440> from<00:01:54.620> being<00:01:54.860> a<00:01:55.280> little<00:01:55.729> unstable<00:01:56.090> now<00:01:56.659> you

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
it from being a little unstable now you

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.149 
it from being a little unstable now you
get<00:01:56.840> about<00:01:57.020> six<00:01:57.350> minutes<00:01:57.500> worth<00:01:57.830> of<00:01:57.920> flight

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 
get about six minutes worth of flight

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:00.370 
get about six minutes worth of flight
time<00:01:58.430> with<00:01:58.700> this<00:01:58.820> aircraft<00:01:59.060> and<00:01:59.630> the<00:02:00.080> charge

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
time with this aircraft and the charge

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.680 
time with this aircraft and the charge
time<00:02:00.710> is<00:02:00.920> about<00:02:01.070> 24<00:02:01.820> minutes<00:02:01.970> and<00:02:02.390> it<00:02:02.479> charges

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
time is about 24 minutes and it charges

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.960 
time is about 24 minutes and it charges
off<00:02:03.050> the<00:02:03.260> transmitter<00:02:04.130> it's<00:02:04.670> got<00:02:04.790> a<00:02:04.820> nice

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
off the transmitter it's got a nice

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.359 
off the transmitter it's got a nice
little<00:02:05.090> flare<00:02:05.360> goes<00:02:05.479> in<00:02:05.659> there<00:02:05.979> and<00:02:06.979> let's<00:02:07.250> go

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
little flare goes in there and let's go

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:39.540 
little flare goes in there and let's go
ahead<00:02:07.460> and<00:02:07.670> see<00:02:07.760> how<00:02:07.790> she<00:02:07.970> fly

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.870 

now<00:02:40.060> the<00:02:40.120> server<00:02:40.450> is<00:02:40.810> pretty<00:02:41.110> responsive<00:02:41.880> it

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
now the server is pretty responsive it

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.510 
now the server is pretty responsive it
turns<00:02:43.240> whenever<00:02:43.660> you<00:02:43.780> wanted<00:02:44.050> to<00:02:44.520> whenever

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
turns whenever you wanted to whenever

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.640 
turns whenever you wanted to whenever
you<00:02:45.670> let<00:02:45.820> off<00:02:45.940> the<00:02:46.060> controls<00:02:46.480> it<00:02:47.020> goes<00:02:47.260> into<00:02:47.470> a

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
you let off the controls it goes into a

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.380 
you let off the controls it goes into a
pretty<00:02:47.860> nice<00:02:48.130> stable<00:02:48.490> hover<00:02:50.850> if<00:02:51.850> you<00:02:52.060> noticed

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
pretty nice stable hover if you noticed

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.970 
pretty nice stable hover if you noticed
it's<00:02:52.540> spinning<00:02:54.000> or<00:02:55.000> moving<00:02:55.360> you<00:02:55.690> know<00:02:55.770> if<00:02:56.770> you

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
it's spinning or moving you know if you

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.770 
it's spinning or moving you know if you
if<00:02:57.610> you<00:02:57.760> lift<00:02:57.970> off<00:02:58.150> and<00:02:58.300> you<00:02:58.390> notice<00:02:58.630> they're

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
if you lift off and you notice they're

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:59.940 
if you lift off and you notice they're
spinning<00:02:59.110> out<00:02:59.200> of<00:02:59.230> control

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
spinning out of control

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.190 
spinning out of control
try<00:03:00.850> and<00:03:01.150> trim<00:03:01.360> it<00:03:01.510> to<00:03:01.600> move<00:03:01.750> forward<00:03:02.110> a<00:03:02.170> little

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
try and trim it to move forward a little

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.440 
try and trim it to move forward a little
bit<00:03:02.410> and<00:03:02.770> then<00:03:03.010> trim<00:03:03.280> least<00:03:03.460> an<00:03:03.670> ounce<00:03:03.850> and<00:03:04.300> you

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
bit and then trim least an ounce and you

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:16.690 
bit and then trim least an ounce and you
should

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.800 

now<00:03:17.700> when<00:03:17.820> it<00:03:17.910> comes<00:03:18.030> to<00:03:18.180> actually<00:03:18.540> flying

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
now when it comes to actually flying

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.570 
now when it comes to actually flying
this<00:03:18.990> aircraft<00:03:19.230> I<00:03:19.860> would<00:03:20.040> say<00:03:20.420> one<00:03:21.420> out<00:03:21.600> of<00:03:21.630> ten

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 
this aircraft I would say one out of ten

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.220 
this aircraft I would say one out of ten
ten<00:03:23.580> being<00:03:23.880> the<00:03:23.970> hardest<00:03:24.300> one<00:03:24.810> being<00:03:25.080> the

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
ten being the hardest one being the

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.210 
ten being the hardest one being the
easiest<00:03:25.290> this<00:03:26.280> is<00:03:26.460> probably<00:03:26.790> a<00:03:26.990> 3.5<00:03:27.990> or<00:03:28.350> a<00:03:28.410> 4<00:03:28.710> it

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
easiest this is probably a 3.5 or a 4 it

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.310 
easiest this is probably a 3.5 or a 4 it
takes<00:03:29.670> a<00:03:29.820> little<00:03:29.970> experience<00:03:30.570> to<00:03:30.690> fly<00:03:30.840> it<00:03:30.960> you

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
takes a little experience to fly it you

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:32.720 
takes a little experience to fly it you
know<00:03:31.440> if<00:03:31.590> you<00:03:31.710> have<00:03:31.800> no<00:03:31.950> experience<00:03:32.100> it's

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
know if you have no experience it's

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.090 
know if you have no experience it's
probably<00:03:33.150> going<00:03:33.330> to<00:03:33.390> be<00:03:33.600> a<00:03:33.960> little<00:03:34.830> bit<00:03:35.010> of

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
probably going to be a little bit of

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.490 
probably going to be a little bit of
trouble<00:03:35.280> to<00:03:35.430> get<00:03:35.550> to<00:03:35.670> hang<00:03:35.880> out<00:03:36.030> but<00:03:36.510> after<00:03:37.410> you

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
trouble to get to hang out but after you

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:38.960 
trouble to get to hang out but after you
get<00:03:37.590> the<00:03:37.680> hang<00:03:37.860> of<00:03:37.920> it<00:03:37.980> it<00:03:38.160> really<00:03:38.190> is<00:03:38.640> a<00:03:38.670> nice

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
get the hang of it it really is a nice

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:47.290 
get the hang of it it really is a nice
stable<00:03:39.330> stable<00:03:39.959> platform

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:47.300 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.700 

now<00:03:48.300> one<00:03:48.510> of<00:03:48.540> the<00:03:48.690> only<00:03:48.810> real<00:03:49.050> complaints<00:03:49.590> I

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:49.710 
now one of the only real complaints I

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:52.190 
now one of the only real complaints I
have<00:03:49.920> with<00:03:50.130> this<00:03:50.370> is<00:03:50.700> the<00:03:51.090> transmitter<00:03:51.900> stick

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
have with this is the transmitter stick

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.260 
have with this is the transmitter stick
the<00:03:52.440> right<00:03:52.860> transmitter<00:03:53.340> stick<00:03:53.580> isn't<00:03:54.030> very

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:54.270 
the right transmitter stick isn't very

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.440 
the right transmitter stick isn't very
secure<00:03:54.780> on<00:03:55.020> there<00:03:55.380> kind<00:03:55.920> of<00:03:56.040> jiggles<00:03:56.910> loosely

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
secure on there kind of jiggles loosely

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.330 
secure on there kind of jiggles loosely
on<00:03:57.600> there<00:03:57.900> they'd<00:03:58.560> be<00:03:58.740> matched<00:03:58.950> for<00:03:59.130> that<00:03:59.220> to

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
on there they'd be matched for that to

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:00.680 
on there they'd be matched for that to
be<00:03:59.430> a<00:03:59.460> little<00:03:59.670> more<00:03:59.790> secure<00:04:00.120> but<00:04:00.360> other<00:04:00.540> than

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
be a little more secure but other than

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.810 
be a little more secure but other than
that<00:04:00.840> it's<00:04:01.020> nice<00:04:01.230> on<00:04:01.410> the<00:04:01.560> left<00:04:02.040> one<00:04:02.550> thing<00:04:02.730> I

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
that it's nice on the left one thing I

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.100 
that it's nice on the left one thing I
really<00:04:03.030> do<00:04:03.150> like<00:04:03.330> doing<00:04:03.510> is<00:04:03.690> lying<00:04:03.870> in<00:04:04.050> the

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
really do like doing is lying in the

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:05.480 
really do like doing is lying in the
dark<00:04:04.290> because<00:04:04.560> the<00:04:04.680> flashing<00:04:05.040> lights<00:04:05.220> really

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:05.490 
dark because the flashing lights really

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:07.280 
dark because the flashing lights really
help<00:04:05.790> you<00:04:05.910> keep<00:04:06.060> your<00:04:06.240> orientation<00:04:06.960> and

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
help you keep your orientation and

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:08.420 
help you keep your orientation and
they're<00:04:07.410> not<00:04:07.500> too<00:04:07.680> terribly<00:04:07.980> bright<00:04:08.190> but

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
they're not too terribly bright but

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:09.560 
they're not too terribly bright but
they're<00:04:08.550> just<00:04:08.760> right<00:04:08.940> enough<00:04:09.150> to<00:04:09.270> light<00:04:09.420> up

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
they're just right enough to light up

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:11.120 
they're just right enough to light up
the<00:04:09.660> room<00:04:09.810> so<00:04:10.080> you<00:04:10.170> can<00:04:10.320> now<00:04:10.620> see<00:04:10.830> the<00:04:10.860> walls

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
the room so you can now see the walls

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.030 
the room so you can now see the walls
before<00:04:11.340> you<00:04:11.580> hit<00:04:11.790> them<00:04:11.910> and<00:04:12.740> it's<00:04:13.740> really<00:04:13.950> a

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
before you hit them and it's really a

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.650 
before you hit them and it's really a
lot<00:04:14.160> of<00:04:14.220> fun<00:04:14.459> most<00:04:14.700> America<00:04:15.150> if<00:04:15.270> you<00:04:15.390> know<00:04:15.510> I'm

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
lot of fun most America if you know I'm

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.390 
lot of fun most America if you know I'm
not<00:04:15.780> gonna<00:04:15.930> find<00:04:16.170> the<00:04:16.320> pitch-black<00:04:16.530> darkness

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
not gonna find the pitch-black darkness

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.340 
not gonna find the pitch-black darkness
but<00:04:17.730> this<00:04:17.910> one<00:04:18.090> you<00:04:18.120> really<00:04:18.239> can<00:04:18.690> you're<00:04:19.230> gonna

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
but this one you really can you're gonna

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.110 
but this one you really can you're gonna
feed<00:04:19.590> UFO<00:04:19.950> sightings<00:04:20.340> around<00:04:20.459> if<00:04:20.730> you<00:04:20.790> do<00:04:20.940> fly

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
feed UFO sightings around if you do fly

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:47.240 
feed UFO sightings around if you do fly
the<00:04:21.180> south<00:04:21.450> side

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.590 

there's<00:04:48.250> a<00:04:48.370> lot<00:04:48.759> of<00:04:48.940> engineering<00:04:49.060> that<00:04:49.479> went

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.600 
there's a lot of engineering that went

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.260 
there's a lot of engineering that went
into<00:04:49.810> this<00:04:50.020> I<00:04:50.320> mean<00:04:50.440> you've<00:04:50.620> got<00:04:50.880> four<00:04:51.880> motors

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
into this I mean you've got four motors

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.420 
into this I mean you've got four motors
being<00:04:52.720> controlled<00:04:53.259> you've<00:04:53.710> got<00:04:53.979> another

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
being controlled you've got another

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.370 
being controlled you've got another
lithium<00:04:54.820> battery<00:04:55.180> you've<00:04:55.509> got<00:04:55.750> all<00:04:56.289> the

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:56.380 
lithium battery you've got all the

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.710 
lithium battery you've got all the
control<00:04:56.680> circuitry<00:04:57.160> plastic<00:04:58.060> body<00:04:58.240> interlock

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 
control circuitry plastic body interlock

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.210 
control circuitry plastic body interlock
so<00:04:58.990> nicely<00:04:59.380> together<00:04:59.530> and<00:04:59.919> it's<00:05:00.039> really

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.220 
so nicely together and it's really

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.430 
so nicely together and it's really
strong<00:05:00.550> for<00:05:01.210> $23.99<00:05:01.960> to<00:05:02.050> get<00:05:02.169> the<00:05:02.259> three

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:02.440 
strong for $23.99 to get the three

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:03.779 
strong for $23.99 to get the three
channel<00:05:02.710> aircraft<00:05:03.190> and<00:05:03.490> you<00:05:03.520> get<00:05:03.669> the

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:03.789 
channel aircraft and you get the

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:06.450 
channel aircraft and you get the
transmitter<00:05:04.270> you<00:05:05.229> don't<00:05:05.949> get<00:05:06.070> any<00:05:06.250> spare

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.460 
transmitter you don't get any spare

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.430 
transmitter you don't get any spare
parts<00:05:06.490> it<00:05:07.120> isn't<00:05:07.419> the<00:05:07.509> easiest<00:05:07.539> aircraft<00:05:08.289> in

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.440 
parts it isn't the easiest aircraft in

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.590 
parts it isn't the easiest aircraft in
the<00:05:08.500> world<00:05:08.530> to<00:05:08.830> fly<00:05:08.970> your<00:05:09.970> first<00:05:10.180> time<00:05:10.360> flying

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:10.600 
the world to fly your first time flying

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.659 
the world to fly your first time flying
this<00:05:10.870> don't<00:05:11.110> just<00:05:11.199> put<00:05:11.979> on<00:05:12.100> your<00:05:12.220> coffee<00:05:12.400> table

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:12.669 
this don't just put on your coffee table

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:14.610 
this don't just put on your coffee table
and<00:05:12.940> expect<00:05:13.270> to<00:05:13.479> jump<00:05:13.960> around<00:05:14.080> in<00:05:14.320> the<00:05:14.410> staff

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:14.620 
and expect to jump around in the staff

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:16.050 
and expect to jump around in the staff
make<00:05:14.889> sure<00:05:15.070> you<00:05:15.220> try<00:05:15.430> the<00:05:15.490> first<00:05:15.580> make<00:05:16.030> sure

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:16.060 
make sure you try the first make sure

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:17.760 
make sure you try the first make sure
you<00:05:16.270> trying<00:05:16.479> to<00:05:16.600> move<00:05:16.780> forward<00:05:16.990> make<00:05:17.470> sure<00:05:17.500> you

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:17.770 
you trying to move forward make sure you

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:20.640 
you trying to move forward make sure you
trend<00:05:18.070> it<00:05:18.190> left<00:05:18.340> right<00:05:18.550> trim<00:05:18.880> look<00:05:19.690> for<00:05:19.870> $23.99

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:20.650 
trend it left right trim look for $23.99

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.170 
trend it left right trim look for $23.99
it's<00:05:20.830> pretty<00:05:21.010> good<00:05:21.130> deal<00:05:21.370> I<00:05:21.610> think<00:05:21.880> it's<00:05:22.060> a

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:22.180 
it's pretty good deal I think it's a

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.290 
it's pretty good deal I think it's a
nice<00:05:23.080> aircraft<00:05:23.590> it<00:05:23.800> looks<00:05:24.039> cool<00:05:24.280> bicycle<00:05:24.970> all
