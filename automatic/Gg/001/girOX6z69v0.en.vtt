you<00:00:09.870> know<00:00:09.990> the<00:00:10.170> capacities<00:00:10.800> here<00:00:11.040> it<00:00:11.130> says<00:00:11.340> the

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
you know the capacities here it says the

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
so I'm very curious about it because I

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.730 
so I'm very curious about it because I
do<00:00:24.210> remember<00:00:24.869> that<00:00:24.990> my<00:00:25.880> ether<00:00:26.880> t8<00:00:27.710> had<00:00:28.710> a

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
do remember that my ether t8 had a

do remember that my ether t8 had a
twenty<00:00:29.490> two<00:00:29.699> point<00:00:30.029> three<00:00:30.539> gallon<00:00:31.230> tank<00:00:31.529> I

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
twenty two point three gallon tank I

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.370

I am surprised that this one had a

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.970 
I am surprised that this one had a
significantly<00:00:38.550> larger<00:00:39.059> fuel<00:00:39.390> tank<00:00:39.719> so<00:00:40.079> I<00:00:40.350> am

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
were the red part starts so let's see

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.840 
were the red part starts so let's see
how<00:01:19.170> many<00:01:19.229> gallons<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:20.130> how<00:01:20.250> much<00:01:20.430> money<00:01:20.700> it

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
how many gallons and how much money it

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.500 
how many gallons and how much money it
takes<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:21.270> fill<00:01:21.450> up

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:40.450 

yeah

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.290 

it'll<00:01:41.210> take<00:01:41.960> more<00:01:42.200> than<00:01:42.380> that<00:01:42.850> unless<00:01:43.850> that

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:44.300 
it'll take more than that unless that

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.590 
it'll take more than that unless that
red<00:01:44.690> reserved<00:01:45.110> area<00:01:45.500> is<00:01:46.270> you<00:01:47.270> know<00:01:47.390> a<00:01:47.420> lot

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
red reserved area is you know a lot

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:57.010 
red reserved area is you know a lot
bigger<00:01:47.840> than<00:01:47.930> I<00:01:48.140> thought<00:01:48.340> you<00:01:49.340> know<00:01:49.460> I<00:01:56.020> just

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
bigger than I thought you know I just

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.859 
bigger than I thought you know I just
did<00:01:57.200> my<00:01:57.350> fill<00:01:57.650> up<00:01:57.860> in<00:01:58.430> the<00:01:59.030> cars<00:01:59.240> running<00:01:59.570> right

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
did my fill up in the cars running right

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:03.400 
did my fill up in the cars running right
now<00:02:00.190> and<00:02:01.190> the<00:02:02.150> needle<00:02:02.479> seems<00:02:02.780> like<00:02:03.020> it's<00:02:03.200> not

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:03.410 
now and the needle seems like it's not

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.430 
now and the needle seems like it's not
all<00:02:03.619> the<00:02:03.740> way<00:02:03.860> to<00:02:03.920> a<00:02:04.070> hundred<00:02:04.160> percent<00:02:05.110> but<00:02:06.110> I

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
all the way to a hundred percent but I

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:13.330 
all the way to a hundred percent but I
topped<00:02:07.250> it<00:02:07.369> off<00:02:07.520> as<00:02:07.700> much<00:02:08.060> as<00:02:08.270> I<00:02:08.360> could<00:02:08.860> so<00:02:12.340> did

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
topped it off as much as I could so did

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.370 
topped it off as much as I could so did
I<00:02:13.430> get<00:02:13.489> an<00:02:13.700> answer<00:02:13.850> I<00:02:14.290> don't<00:02:15.290> know<00:02:16.030> is<00:02:17.380> a

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
I get an answer I don't know is a

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.210 
I get an answer I don't know is a
reserved<00:02:19.010> 7<00:02:19.580> gallons<00:02:19.970> really<00:02:20.690> I<00:02:20.930> really<00:02:21.890> don't

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
reserved 7 gallons really I really don't

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.960 
reserved 7 gallons really I really don't
think<00:02:22.310> so

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
think so

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.120 
think so
if<00:02:23.390> there's<00:02:23.720> any<00:02:23.930> of<00:02:24.080> you<00:02:24.200> guys<00:02:24.380> out<00:02:24.590> there<00:02:24.650> and

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
if there's any of you guys out there and

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.880 
if there's any of you guys out there and
the<00:02:26.090> YouTube<00:02:26.450> community<00:02:26.660> that<00:02:27.500> would<00:02:27.620> like<00:02:27.739> to

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
the YouTube community that would like to

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.910 
the YouTube community that would like to
let<00:02:28.010> me<00:02:28.160> know<00:02:28.340> that<00:02:28.370> you<00:02:28.700> guys<00:02:28.730> have<00:02:29.480> actually

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
let me know that you guys have actually

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.560 
let me know that you guys have actually
experienced<00:02:30.920> the<00:02:31.550> twenty<00:02:31.880> six<00:02:32.060> point<00:02:32.360> four

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
experienced the twenty six point four

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.410 
experienced the twenty six point four
gallon<00:02:32.989> tank<00:02:33.200> please<00:02:33.440> let<00:02:33.680> me<00:02:33.800> know<00:02:34.150> but<00:02:35.150> I

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
gallon tank please let me know but I

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:43.060 
gallon tank please let me know but I
really<00:02:36.110> doubt<00:02:36.290> it<00:02:36.530> because<00:02:37.160> I<00:02:38.470> only<00:02:39.470> put<00:02:42.070> 19.1

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
really doubt it because I only put 19.1

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.840 
really doubt it because I only put 19.1
gallons<00:02:43.520> in<00:02:43.700> the<00:02:43.790> tank<00:02:44.090> and<00:02:45.610> pretty<00:02:46.610> sure

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
gallons in the tank and pretty sure

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.240 
gallons in the tank and pretty sure
maybe<00:02:47.150> there's<00:02:47.989> two<00:02:48.320> and<00:02:48.440> a<00:02:48.500> half<00:02:48.650> gallons<00:02:49.100> at

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
maybe there's two and a half gallons at

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.750 
maybe there's two and a half gallons at
the<00:02:49.370> most<00:02:49.549> in<00:02:50.019> reserve<00:02:51.019> so<00:02:51.860> probably<00:02:52.340> a<00:02:52.370> 22

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
the most in reserve so probably a 22

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.479 
the most in reserve so probably a 22
gallon<00:02:53.239> tank<00:02:53.480> and<00:02:53.780> that<00:02:54.010> is<00:02:55.010> what<00:02:55.370> the

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
gallon tank and that is what the

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:59.979 
gallon tank and that is what the
Imperial<00:02:56.030> gallons<00:02:56.420> is<00:02:56.660> on<00:02:57.160> the<00:02:58.630> on<00:02:59.630> the<00:02:59.810> book

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989 
Imperial gallons is on the on the book

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:05.970 
Imperial gallons is on the on the book
here<00:03:00.380> so<00:03:02.440> maybe<00:03:03.549> maybe<00:03:04.549> they<00:03:04.760> got<00:03:04.940> it<00:03:05.000> wrong

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
here so maybe maybe they got it wrong

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.199 
here so maybe maybe they got it wrong
