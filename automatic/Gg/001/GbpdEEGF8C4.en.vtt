hello youtubers

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.859 
hello youtubers
here<00:00:09.679> I<00:00:09.709> want<00:00:10.040> to<00:00:10.129> give<00:00:10.250> you<00:00:10.280> a<00:00:10.869> comparison

00:00:11.859 --> 00:00:11.869 
here I want to give you a comparison

00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:14.910 
here I want to give you a comparison
that<00:00:12.200> they<00:00:12.410> have<00:00:12.559> the<00:00:12.740> stock<00:00:13.009> for<00:00:13.369> versus<00:00:13.879> the

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:14.920 
that they have the stock for versus the

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.859 
that they have the stock for versus the
Nanyan<00:00:15.920> the<00:00:16.250> stock<00:00:16.520> for<00:00:16.820> 95<00:00:17.359> millimeter

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:17.869 
Nanyan the stock for 95 millimeter

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:20.890 
Nanyan the stock for 95 millimeter
versus<00:00:18.320> the<00:00:18.470> 98<00:00:18.860> mo<00:00:19.070> meter<00:00:19.340> piston<00:00:19.789> one<00:00:20.180> my<00:00:20.360> kit

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:20.900 
versus the 98 mo meter piston one my kit

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.859 
versus the 98 mo meter piston one my kit
here<00:00:21.169> boys<00:00:22.099> here's<00:00:22.579> comparison<00:00:23.360> the<00:00:23.480> two<00:00:23.689> boys

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:23.869 
here boys here's comparison the two boys

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:28.209 
here boys here's comparison the two boys
this<00:00:24.289> is<00:00:24.500> a<00:00:24.939> stock<00:00:25.939> 95<00:00:26.779> millimeter<00:00:27.410> bore<00:00:27.710> from

00:00:28.209 --> 00:00:28.219 
this is a stock 95 millimeter bore from

00:00:28.219 --> 00:00:29.019 
this is a stock 95 millimeter bore from
the<00:00:28.309> AL<00:00:28.460> Mahal

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:29.029 
the AL Mahal

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:31.839 
the AL Mahal
I<00:00:29.529> guess<00:00:30.529> it's<00:00:30.710> kind<00:00:30.950> of<00:00:31.040> hard<00:00:31.219> to<00:00:31.279> see<00:00:31.669> the

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:31.849 
I guess it's kind of hard to see the

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:37.690 
I guess it's kind of hard to see the
size<00:00:33.969> then<00:00:34.969> here's<00:00:35.210> a<00:00:35.860> 98<00:00:36.860> million<00:00:37.280> bore

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:37.700 
size then here's a 98 million bore

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.299 
size then here's a 98 million bore
cylinder<00:00:38.390> from<00:00:38.600> cylinder<00:00:39.289> works

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:42.309 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:45.819 

no<00:00:43.309> no<00:00:43.550> hold<00:00:43.850> on<00:00:43.909> a<00:00:43.969> sec<00:00:44.350> if<00:00:45.350> you<00:00:45.469> look<00:00:45.620> in<00:00:45.800> here

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:45.829 
no no hold on a sec if you look in here

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:50.049 
no no hold on a sec if you look in here
that's<00:00:46.309> how<00:00:46.489> much<00:00:46.699> bigger<00:00:47.379> this<00:00:48.730> 508<00:00:49.730> well

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:50.059 
that's how much bigger this 508 well

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:53.319 
that's how much bigger this 508 well
this<00:00:50.329> ain't<00:00:50.510> the<00:00:50.659> 508<00:00:51.079> it<00:00:52.010> is<00:00:52.190> the<00:00:52.399> 508<00:00:52.850> but

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:53.329 
this ain't the 508 it is the 508 but

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:56.739 
this ain't the 508 it is the 508 but
it's<00:00:53.539> not<00:00:53.719> all<00:00:53.899> from<00:00:54.109> the<00:00:54.260> fibery<00:00:54.789> how<00:00:55.789> big<00:00:56.059> how

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:56.749 
it's not all from the fibery how big how

00:00:56.749 --> 00:00:58.770 
it's not all from the fibery how big how
much<00:00:56.929> bigger<00:00:57.170> this<00:00:57.379> ninety<00:00:57.739> eight<00:00:57.800> millimeter

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
much bigger this ninety eight millimeter

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.969 
much bigger this ninety eight millimeter
cylinder<00:00:59.780> is<00:00:59.929> compared<00:01:00.440> to<00:01:00.499> the<00:01:00.649> 95

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:00.979 
cylinder is compared to the 95

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:04.090 
cylinder is compared to the 95
millimeter<00:01:01.609> Stockton<00:01:02.589> here's<00:01:03.589> a<00:01:03.679> comparison

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
millimeter Stockton here's a comparison

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.300 
millimeter Stockton here's a comparison
here's<00:01:04.760> the<00:01:04.940> stock<00:01:05.239> piston<00:01:05.890> it's<00:01:06.890> still<00:01:07.159> in

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
here's the stock piston it's still in

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.330 
here's the stock piston it's still in
the<00:01:07.430> star<00:01:07.670> crank<00:01:08.590> and<00:01:09.590> here's<00:01:09.799> the<00:01:10.040> ninety

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
the star crank and here's the ninety

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.790 
the star crank and here's the ninety
eight<00:01:10.460> millimeter<00:01:10.909> piston<00:01:11.420> I<00:01:14.380> guess<00:01:15.380> I<00:01:15.530> didn't

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:15.800 
eight millimeter piston I guess I didn't

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.490 
eight millimeter piston I guess I didn't
really<00:01:15.920> good<00:01:16.220> comparison<00:01:16.730> either<00:01:17.030> I<00:01:17.330> can<00:01:18.290> I

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
really good comparison either I can I

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.960 
really good comparison either I can I
think<00:01:18.620> I<00:01:19.010> can<00:01:19.040> definitely<00:01:19.460> tell<00:01:19.820> the

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
think I can definitely tell the

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.510 
think I can definitely tell the
difference<00:01:20.000> between<00:01:20.510> the<00:01:20.870> size<00:01:21.050> I<00:01:21.470> don't<00:01:22.430> know

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
difference between the size I don't know

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:28.330 
difference between the size I don't know
if<00:01:22.580> you<00:01:22.700> guys<00:01:22.850> can<00:01:24.550> but<00:01:25.630> anyways<00:01:26.680> the<00:01:27.680> 5/8

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
if you guys can but anyways the 5/8

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.600 
if you guys can but anyways the 5/8
doesn't<00:01:28.730> come<00:01:28.940> straight<00:01:29.240> from<00:01:29.600> the<00:01:30.110> board

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
doesn't come straight from the board

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.230 
doesn't come straight from the board
with<00:01:31.610> this<00:01:32.000> bore<00:01:32.870> in<00:01:33.050> this<00:01:33.230> piston<00:01:33.710> right<00:01:33.890> here

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
with this bore in this piston right here

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.020 
with this bore in this piston right here
we<00:01:35.240> would<00:01:35.300> only<00:01:35.510> make<00:01:35.750> it<00:01:35.810> up<00:01:36.110> for<00:01:36.350> 78<00:01:37.040> but<00:01:37.850> the

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
we would only make it up for 78 but the

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.140 
we would only make it up for 78 but the
Stricker<00:01:38.390> adds<00:01:38.770> the<00:01:39.770> other<00:01:39.950> whatever<00:01:40.730> Steve

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150 
Stricker adds the other whatever Steve

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.260 
Stricker adds the other whatever Steve
sees<00:01:41.360> it<00:01:41.570> is<00:01:41.780> to<00:01:41.960> make<00:01:42.110> it<00:01:42.230> a<00:01:42.290> 508<00:01:43.060> so<00:01:44.060> it's<00:01:44.210> a

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
sees it is to make it a 508 so it's a

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.350 
sees it is to make it a 508 so it's a
bore<00:01:44.540> and<00:01:44.570> Stroke<00:01:45.320> kit<00:01:45.680> okay<00:01:46.610> just<00:01:46.970> got<00:01:47.180> my

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
bore and Stroke kit okay just got my

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.050 
bore and Stroke kit okay just got my

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
wheels and tires shined up then my front

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.130 
wheels and tires shined up then my front
bumper<00:01:50.420> and<00:01:51.250> I<00:01:52.250> am<00:01:52.490> ready<00:01:52.880> for<00:01:53.270> spring<00:01:53.390> man<00:01:53.900> I
