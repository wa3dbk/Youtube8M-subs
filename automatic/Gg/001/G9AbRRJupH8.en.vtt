00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:05.990
 Yes 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:11.260
 so I'm skiing moguls because 

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:15.030
 my par 11 and my brother too so bah 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:15.030
 I am I am the family 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.450
 since 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:51.210
 I came back so in France team 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.210
 and I train with them 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.860
 to enter a new era of ski 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.960
 moguls with young talents and 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.309
 especially perrine laffont who for his 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.449
 first season last year when 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.100
 even talked about it many times 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.600
 recovery and beautiful way with 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.809
 very promising results for his young 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.809
 career 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.130
 because she has all today for 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.410
 be part of the best 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.440
 the world's best she has a 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:22.240
 passion for this sport she has a desire 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.700
 maybe that allows him today 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.800
 even with his young age of perhaps 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.390
 to surpass and then bah inevitably there is some 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.380
 talent so well now do not have to 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.240
 only to have crazy talent too 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.330
 exploit it but I think it has to 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.450
 what to do to become a day 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.450
 the best 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.119
 for me the tower where she has everything 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:47.009
 from a big one already to 15 years old and 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.069
 she is persevering has unstructured 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.539
 I come from the dauphinÃ© 6 6 and a small 

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:52.560
 committee 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:54.240
 perrinelle and link it comes from the goods 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.920
 of the Pyrenees so it's true that there 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:00.119
 already had little similarities by 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:03.259
 compared to that with his little accent there a 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.259
 little trick in addition what 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.910
 the trainings they are often 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.480
 based in the alps so me it takes 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:35.700
 that I make trips back to the Pyrenees 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.970
 alps all the time and financially 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:41.310
 it's not easy so thanks to France 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.709
 continue I will be able to finance his 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.510
 traveling well to train take 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.640
 the plane to be less tired 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:52.819
 train in very good conditions 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.819
 so thank you very much france continues 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.920
 it's good that today also 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.000
 sponsors like France continues because 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.190
 that I think it's people who are 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.320
 passionate about their sport as much as 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.580
 young people who practice it and it allows 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.250
 really help them to be able to 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.510
 perform I think it feels good 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.820
 also young people to see that there are 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.130
 people behind for them to support them 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.810
 and motivate them mentally 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.200
 and financially to pursue in 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.200
 their career
