throw<00:01:06.580> in<00:01:06.759> a<00:01:06.850> bit<00:01:07.060> I<00:01:08.700> won't<00:01:09.700> ask<00:01:09.910> actually

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 
throw in a bit I won't ask actually

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.150 
throw in a bit I won't ask actually
because<00:01:10.810> I<00:01:10.840> know<00:01:10.990> song<00:01:11.290> anybody<00:01:11.710> would<00:01:11.830> eat<00:01:11.979> it

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:12.160

and so obviously you wouldn't eaten to
throw<00:01:17.200> it<00:01:17.259> away<00:01:17.410> so<00:01:18.220> why<00:01:18.430> is<00:01:18.490> it<00:01:18.640> that<00:01:18.820> we<00:01:19.060> do

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.950 
throw it away so why is it that we do
not<00:01:19.330> care<00:01:19.750> for<00:01:20.399> hours<00:01:21.399> the<00:01:22.180> spiritual<00:01:22.690> side
