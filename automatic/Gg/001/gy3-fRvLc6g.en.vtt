of improvisation we're talking about was

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:15.910 
of improvisation we're talking about was
was<00:02:13.190> their<00:02:13.459> premise<00:02:13.940> and<00:02:14.510> this<00:02:15.230> is<00:02:15.410> not<00:02:15.650> really

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
was their premise and this is not really

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.560 
was their premise and this is not really
true<00:02:16.370> after<00:02:16.640> a<00:02:16.820> certain<00:02:17.060> point<00:02:17.329> although

ways away from it but i would say you

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.930 
ways away from it but i would say you
couldn't<00:02:26.720> start<00:02:27.050> out<00:02:27.230> with<00:02:27.440> anybody<00:02:27.950> better

real<00:05:22.569> place<00:05:22.840> mm-hmm<00:05:23.580> you<00:05:24.580> want<00:05:24.849> to<00:05:24.970> match<00:05:25.150> it

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 
real place mm-hmm you want to match it

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.240 
real place mm-hmm you want to match it
exactly<00:05:25.479> you<00:05:26.319> don't<00:05:26.470> want<00:05:26.710> to<00:05:26.800> just<00:05:26.919> sort<00:05:27.159> of

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.250 
exactly you don't want to just sort of

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.420 
exactly you don't want to just sort of
sing<00:05:27.490> along<00:05:27.759> with<00:05:27.789> it<00:05:28.060> not<00:05:28.389> your<00:05:28.750> your

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:29.430 
sing along with it not your your

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:32.249 
sing along with it not your your
objective<00:05:30.430> is<00:05:30.550> to<00:05:30.759> merge<00:05:31.000> or<00:05:31.509> actually<00:05:32.020> right

00:05:32.249 --> 00:05:32.259 
objective is to merge or actually right

00:05:32.259 --> 00:05:35.100 
objective is to merge or actually right
so<00:05:32.669> when<00:05:33.669> you<00:05:33.789> get<00:05:33.970> the<00:05:34.090> notes<00:05:34.330> and<00:05:34.630> you<00:05:34.750> get

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:35.110 
so when you get the notes and you get

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:36.540 
so when you get the notes and you get
them<00:05:35.289> by<00:05:35.440> ear<00:05:35.710> you<00:05:35.919> don't<00:05:36.099> get<00:05:36.220> them<00:05:36.400> by

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:36.550 
them by ear you don't get them by

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:38.129 
them by ear you don't get them by
writing<00:05:36.819> them<00:05:37.030> on<00:05:37.180> a<00:05:37.210> piece<00:05:37.449> of<00:05:37.479> paper<00:05:37.630> right

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:38.139 
writing them on a piece of paper right

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:40.469 
writing them on a piece of paper right
but<00:05:38.949> once<00:05:39.460> you've<00:05:39.610> gotten<00:05:39.940> the<00:05:40.000> notes<00:05:40.210> that's

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:40.479 
but once you've gotten the notes that's

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:42.600 
but once you've gotten the notes that's
your<00:05:40.659> point<00:05:40.840> of<00:05:40.990> entry<00:05:41.440> when<00:05:41.770> you<00:05:41.949> sing<00:05:42.250> a<00:05:42.400> solo

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:42.610 
your point of entry when you sing a solo

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:44.730 
your point of entry when you sing a solo
over<00:05:43.210> and<00:05:43.360> over<00:05:43.479> and<00:05:43.780> you<00:05:43.840> get<00:05:44.409> all<00:05:44.590> the

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:44.740 
over and over and you get all the

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.529 
over and over and you get all the
subtleties<00:05:44.949> what<00:05:45.490> that's<00:05:45.969> when<00:05:46.210> you<00:05:46.360> could

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:46.539 
subtleties what that's when you could

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:48.899 
subtleties what that's when you could
start<00:05:46.780> to<00:05:46.900> experience<00:05:47.289> this<00:05:47.729> wonderful<00:05:48.729> merge

00:05:48.899 --> 00:05:48.909 
start to experience this wonderful merge

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:51.270 
start to experience this wonderful merge
right<00:05:49.330> and<00:05:49.659> I<00:05:49.840> remember<00:05:50.380> you<00:05:50.469> had<00:05:50.680> me<00:05:50.949> pick<00:05:51.250> a

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:51.280 
right and I remember you had me pick a

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.969 
right and I remember you had me pick a
few<00:05:51.550> songs<00:05:51.849> and<00:05:52.150> you<00:05:52.330> almost<00:05:52.990> like<00:05:53.289> pick<00:05:53.949> one

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:53.979 
few songs and you almost like pick one

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:56.459 
few songs and you almost like pick one
and<00:05:54.550> then<00:05:55.150> just<00:05:55.360> work<00:05:55.570> with<00:05:55.780> that<00:05:55.990> one<00:05:56.259> and

00:05:56.459 --> 00:05:56.469 
and then just work with that one and

00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:58.649 
and then just work with that one and
keep<00:05:56.889> singing<00:05:57.550> it<00:05:57.669> and<00:05:57.849> sing<00:05:58.180> along<00:05:58.210> whether

00:05:58.649 --> 00:05:58.659 
keep singing it and sing along whether

00:05:58.659 --> 00:06:01.290 
keep singing it and sing along whether
we'd<00:05:58.930> sing<00:05:59.259> along<00:05:59.530> sing<00:05:59.830> along<00:06:00.130> until<00:06:00.669> I<00:06:00.729> am<00:06:01.000> I

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:01.300 
we'd sing along sing along until I am I

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.860 
we'd sing along sing along until I am I
was<00:06:01.750> I<00:06:02.009> was<00:06:03.009> like<00:06:03.219> really<00:06:03.669> one<00:06:04.030> with<00:06:04.270> the<00:06:04.419> lead

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:04.870 
was I was like really one with the lead

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:06.260 
was I was like really one with the lead
i<00:06:05.050> could<00:06:05.229> sing<00:06:05.440> it<00:06:05.590> I<00:06:05.800> could<00:06:06.099> almost

i could sing it I could almost

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:09.300 
i could sing it I could almost
instinctually<00:06:07.889> anticipate<00:06:08.889> it<00:06:09.009> wasn't

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:09.310 
instinctually anticipate it wasn't

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:11.309 
instinctually anticipate it wasn't
memorization<00:06:10.000> it<00:06:10.270> was<00:06:10.479> getting<00:06:10.960> the<00:06:11.080> feeling

00:06:11.309 --> 00:06:11.319 
memorization it was getting the feeling

00:06:11.319 --> 00:06:13.680 
memorization it was getting the feeling
and<00:06:11.979> this<00:06:12.280> way<00:06:12.490> I<00:06:12.520> I<00:06:12.969> knew<00:06:13.270> when<00:06:13.419> he<00:06:13.479> was<00:06:13.599> going

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:13.690 
and this way I I knew when he was going

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:17.100 
and this way I I knew when he was going
to<00:06:13.840> look<00:06:14.050> up<00:06:14.289> and<00:06:14.560> this<00:06:14.919> that<00:06:15.280> and<00:06:15.630> that<00:06:16.630> really

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:17.110 
to look up and this that and that really

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:19.920 
to look up and this that and that really
makes<00:06:18.039> a<00:06:18.190> difference<00:06:18.219> yeah<00:06:18.909> many<00:06:19.659> musicians

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:19.930 
makes a difference yeah many musicians

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:22.399 
makes a difference yeah many musicians
learn<00:06:20.590> the<00:06:20.800> solos<00:06:21.280> of<00:06:21.610> these<00:06:22.000> great

00:06:22.399 --> 00:06:22.409 
learn the solos of these great

00:06:22.409 --> 00:06:27.839 
learn the solos of these great
innovators<00:06:23.409> and<00:06:24.810> now<00:06:25.810> musicians<00:06:26.710> spent<00:06:27.639> a<00:06:27.699> lot

00:06:27.839 --> 00:06:27.849 
innovators and now musicians spent a lot

00:06:27.849 --> 00:06:30.089 
innovators and now musicians spent a lot
of<00:06:27.880> the<00:06:28.030> time<00:06:28.270> learning<00:06:28.630> it<00:06:28.870> from<00:06:29.020> sheet<00:06:29.710> music

00:06:30.089 --> 00:06:30.099 
of the time learning it from sheet music

00:06:30.099 --> 00:06:32.339 
of the time learning it from sheet music
right<00:06:30.520> which<00:06:31.120> I<00:06:31.300> feel<00:06:31.539> is<00:06:31.599> pretty<00:06:32.169> much<00:06:32.289> a

00:06:32.339 --> 00:06:32.349 
right which I feel is pretty much a

00:06:32.349 --> 00:06:34.379 
right which I feel is pretty much a
waste<00:06:32.469> of<00:06:32.800> time<00:06:32.860> what<00:06:33.340> if<00:06:33.580> you<00:06:33.789> learn<00:06:34.060> it<00:06:34.210> that

00:06:34.379 --> 00:06:34.389 
waste of time what if you learn it that

00:06:34.389 --> 00:06:35.890 
waste of time what if you learn it that
way<00:06:34.569> all<00:06:34.870> you<00:06:35.110> get<00:06:35.259> are<00:06:35.319> the<00:06:35.560> No

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:35.900 
way all you get are the No

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.020 
way all you get are the No
you<00:06:36.110> will<00:06:36.320> wind<00:06:36.560> up<00:06:36.680> playing<00:06:36.889> but<00:06:37.340> actually

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:38.030 
you will wind up playing but actually

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:40.590
