00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:09.380
 recording ubees games so i'm 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.450
 climbed many sites and 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:15.240
 videos about this and in all 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.090
 The cases have practically been resolved. 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:22.050
 the problem is stupid here they say put 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:24.570
 tick sources game and so 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.289

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.070
 to work if it helped you now 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:31.170
 subscribe put likes 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.430
 Well, at least if you do not need 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.760
 subscribe to my channel 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.020
 Well, of course comment on the video and those 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.960
 who didn't help 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:43.590
 those maybe have two video cards 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:47.329
 integrated and and nvidia that is 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.670
 discrete more powerful 3d graphics 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:53.340
 the game starts through 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.090
 discrete because they are more complex in 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.579
 processing 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.039
 i.e. intel cannot cope 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.629
 created to follow for 2d graphics ie 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.660
 desktops and unpretentious applications 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.439
 and so you need to do you need 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.189
 run 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.299
 and ps through nvidia that is, u click 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:14.070
 right click 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:17.670
 run through high performance 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:20.360
 nvidia processor I have no fad 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.619
 this is why those who are not 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.040
 right click on the desktop 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.460
 mice 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:29.159
 go to the nvidia control panel and 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:31.610
 so here you choose control parameters 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.259
 3d 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.240
 romance of ukraine with 3d parameters 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.850
 program settings choose 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:43.829
 application that should be launched 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:46.950
 through video 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.689
 video card and in the second fad 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.680
 choose high performance 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.960
 processor n and i 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.820
 that is, it costs with integration that we do not 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.250
 need to choose high performance 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.920
 I have a processor , so here I am 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.320
 write down an example I will not show but 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.450
 as you can see here by trial and error I 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.280
 all the same solved this problem because 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.270
 generally no one answer did not find any 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.400
 forums in general, I did not find everything 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.750
 Well writes stupid black screen not 

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.360
 I will not run because I have 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.490
 The problem with this for some reason flies ubees 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.190
 I can still fail Marish 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:21.470
 someday but not now see here 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:25.880
 recorded the game here on this video 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:27.440
 that is, noticeably well and believe on 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.460
 the word that is, you can now 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.150
 test it 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:34.310
 If it works, then I'm glad to help.
