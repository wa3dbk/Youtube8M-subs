looks<00:01:17.310> nice<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:18.000> rare<00:01:18.680> what<00:01:19.680> is<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.890> biggest

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
looks nice and rare what is the biggest

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.179 
looks nice and rare what is the biggest
challenge<00:01:20.750> such<00:01:21.750> a<00:01:21.780> huge<00:01:22.110> change<00:01:22.320> what

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
challenge such a huge change what

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.170 
challenge such a huge change what
happened<00:01:23.610> look<00:01:23.700> outward

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.680 

I<00:01:27.320> think<00:01:28.320> which<00:01:28.500> face<00:01:29.010> is<00:01:29.160> very<00:01:29.390> rarely<00:01:30.390> then

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:30.690 
I think which face is very rarely then

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.600 
I think which face is very rarely then
delicate<00:01:31.580> so<00:01:32.580> I<00:01:32.970> have<00:01:33.390> to<00:01:33.510> kill<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.780> them

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
delicate so I have to kill to them

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.820 
delicate so I have to kill to them
before<00:01:35.610> I<00:01:35.850> introduce<00:01:36.060> in<00:01:36.510> my<00:01:36.630> 10<00:01:36.900> and<00:01:37.170> even<00:01:37.680> if

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:37.830 
before I introduce in my 10 and even if

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.360 
before I introduce in my 10 and even if
you<00:01:38.070> see<00:01:38.280> them<00:01:38.460> they<00:01:38.850> still<00:01:39.060> keep<00:01:39.330> dying<00:01:40.370> so

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:41.370 
you see them they still keep dying so

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:42.560 
you see them they still keep dying so
that<00:01:41.400> is<00:01:41.670> I<00:01:41.850> think<00:01:41.910> that's<00:01:42.300> the<00:01:42.390> biggest

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
that is I think that's the biggest

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.750 
that is I think that's the biggest
challenge<00:01:43.020> for<00:01:43.200> me<00:01:43.350> is<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.680> fish<00:01:44.010> is<00:01:44.550> there

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:44.760 
challenge for me is the fish is there

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.969 
challenge for me is the fish is there
any<00:01:44.940> special<00:01:45.390> methods<00:01:46.050> that<00:01:46.350> you<00:01:46.530> do<00:01:46.710> of

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
did it it is under control that's the

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:12.420 
did it it is under control that's the
very<00:04:09.700> serious<00:04:10.450> problem<00:04:10.950> so<00:04:11.950> if<00:04:12.099> you<00:04:12.190> start

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
very serious problem so if you start

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.000 
very serious problem so if you start
with<00:04:12.700> the<00:04:13.150> fake<00:04:13.390> lock<00:04:13.629> or<00:04:13.810> dialogue<00:04:14.440> would<00:04:14.860> be

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
with the fake lock or dialogue would be

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.420 
with the fake lock or dialogue would be
more<00:04:15.449> easier<00:04:16.560> have<00:04:17.560> you<00:04:17.620> seen<00:04:17.829> it<00:04:17.949> is<00:04:18.070> like

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
more easier have you seen it is like

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.400 
more easier have you seen it is like
