00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
facing me so his treads withhold his

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.440 
facing me so his treads withhold his
first<00:03:41.870> date<00:03:42.170> was<00:03:42.470> shielded<00:03:42.980> by<00:03:43.100> his<00:03:43.310> body<00:03:43.640> and

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
first date was shielded by his body and

first date was shielded by his body and
I<00:03:44.570> just<00:03:44.810> wanted<00:03:45.140> to<00:03:45.290> see<00:03:45.470> if<00:03:45.500> I<00:03:45.740> still<00:03:45.770> pick<00:03:46.280> up

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
I just wanted to see if I still pick up

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.910 
I just wanted to see if I still pick up
the<00:03:46.670> signal<00:03:47.180> it<00:03:47.510> worked<00:03:47.930> just<00:03:48.050> fine<00:03:48.320> worked

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
the signal it worked just fine worked

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.580 
the signal it worked just fine worked
reliably<00:03:49.310> here<00:03:50.060> so<00:03:50.840> what<00:03:50.990> I'll<00:03:51.140> do<00:03:51.380> now<00:03:51.560> is

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
reliably here so what I'll do now is

00:03:51.590 --> 00:05:24.770 
reliably here so what I'll do now is
I'll<00:03:51.980> go<00:03:52.280> about<00:03:52.880> 25<00:03:53.750> feet

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:24.780 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:31.100 

yeah<00:05:26.340> 50<00:05:27.340> give<00:05:28.030> at<00:05:28.270> 25<00:05:29.020> feet<00:05:29.970> completely

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.110 
yeah 50 give at 25 feet completely

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:35.159 
yeah 50 give at 25 feet completely
regularly<00:05:32.110> oh<00:05:32.500> so<00:05:33.460> now<00:05:33.490> that's<00:05:34.120> nice<00:05:34.419> so<00:05:35.080> I

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:35.169 
regularly oh so now that's nice so I

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:38.550 
regularly oh so now that's nice so I
guess<00:05:35.229> you<00:05:35.919> were<00:05:36.160> you<00:05:36.310> still<00:05:36.550> pacing<00:05:36.820> me<00:05:37.560> yeah

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 
guess you were you still pacing me yeah

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.610 
guess you were you still pacing me yeah
yeah<00:05:38.919> so<00:05:39.340> that<00:05:39.610> would<00:05:39.729> have<00:05:39.880> been<00:05:40.060> dead<00:05:40.300> the<00:05:41.020> 25

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:41.620 
yeah so that would have been dead the 25

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.070 
yeah so that would have been dead the 25
feet<00:05:41.890> that<00:05:42.100> going<00:05:42.370> through<00:05:42.729> your<00:05:42.910> body<00:05:43.150> so<00:05:44.050> I

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:44.080 
feet that going through your body so I

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:48.659 
feet that going through your body so I
think<00:05:44.770> the<00:05:45.160> signals<00:05:45.580> at<00:05:46.140> 160<00:05:47.140> decibels<00:05:47.669> it's

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:48.669 
think the signals at 160 decibels it's

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:52.290 
think the signals at 160 decibels it's
very<00:05:49.150> strong<00:05:49.690> enough<00:05:50.080> and<00:05:50.729> yet<00:05:51.729> it's<00:05:51.970> not<00:05:52.270> a

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:52.300 
very strong enough and yet it's not a

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.510 
very strong enough and yet it's not a
whole<00:05:52.630> lot<00:05:52.750> of<00:05:52.960> threads<00:05:53.200> per<00:05:53.410> hour<00:05:53.830> so<00:05:54.250> the

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:54.520 
whole lot of threads per hour so the

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.120 
whole lot of threads per hour so the
best<00:05:54.729> we<00:05:55.000> will<00:05:55.180> last<00:05:55.390> a<00:05:55.630> long<00:05:55.780> time<00:05:56.130> probably

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:57.130 
best we will last a long time probably

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:59.280 
best we will last a long time probably
much<00:05:57.760> more<00:05:57.790> 3-pointers<00:05:58.570> it<00:05:58.810> might<00:05:59.110> reveal

00:05:59.280 --> 00:05:59.290 
much more 3-pointers it might reveal

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:02.159 
much more 3-pointers it might reveal
much<00:05:59.710> power<00:06:00.010> to<00:06:00.040> purchase<00:06:00.550> all<00:06:01.240> right<00:06:01.390> so

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:02.169 
much power to purchase all right so

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:03.840 
much power to purchase all right so
buh-bye<00:06:02.350> you<00:06:02.530> are<00:06:02.770> a<00:06:02.800> great<00:06:03.280> Haiti<00:06:03.580> good
