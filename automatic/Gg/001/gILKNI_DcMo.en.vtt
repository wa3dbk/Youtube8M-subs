00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
the stiffer areas are okay so

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.440 
the stiffer areas are okay so
essentially<00:00:56.520> when<00:00:56.640> that<00:00:56.760> player<00:00:57.000> puts<00:00:57.270> that

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
hand right here to lean into that slap

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.340 
hand right here to lean into that slap
truck<00:00:59.730> you're<00:01:00.059> going<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:00.239> get<00:01:00.420> all<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:01.079> flex

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
truck you're going to get all the flex

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.889 
truck you're going to get all the flex
up<00:01:01.590> through<00:01:01.620> here<00:01:02.280> that<00:01:02.789> softer<00:01:03.390> layup<00:01:03.750> it's

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
up through here that softer layup it's

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.389 
up through here that softer layup it's
going<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.079> allow<00:01:04.170> that<00:01:04.289> stick<00:01:04.649> to<00:01:04.769> really<00:01:05.100> load

00:01:05.389 --> 00:01:05.399 
going to allow that stick to really load

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:07.399 
going to allow that stick to really load
and<00:01:05.700> then<00:01:05.850> give<00:01:06.000> you<00:01:06.090> that<00:01:06.270> explosive<00:01:06.960> kick<00:01:07.229> so

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
and then give you that explosive kick so

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.010 
and then give you that explosive kick so
that<00:01:07.530> that<00:01:07.950> amplified<00:01:08.670> kind<00:01:09.299> of<00:01:09.390> mid<00:01:09.600> kick<00:01:09.840> as

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
that that amplified kind of mid kick as

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.570 
that that amplified kind of mid kick as
we<00:01:10.140> started<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.590> call<00:01:10.799> it<00:01:10.860> now<00:01:10.979> because<00:01:11.340> of<00:01:11.369> the

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
we started to call it now because of the

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.070 
we started to call it now because of the
explosive<00:01:12.090> release<00:01:12.330> that<00:01:12.540> you<00:01:12.630> get<00:01:12.810> with<00:01:12.900> this

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
explosive release that you get with this

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.230 
explosive release that you get with this
stick<00:01:13.320> so<00:01:13.500> built<00:01:14.040> for<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.310> power<00:01:14.520> player<00:01:14.909> but

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
stick so built for the power player but

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.789 
stick so built for the power player but
the<00:01:15.659> other<00:01:15.780> thing<00:01:15.990> that<00:01:16.049> we've<00:01:16.260> built<00:01:16.470> in<00:01:16.619> a

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
the other thing that we've built in a

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.070 
the other thing that we've built in a
stick<00:01:17.040> is<00:01:17.190> the<00:01:17.340> dual<00:01:17.549> density<00:01:17.729> blade<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.450> what

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
stick is the dual density blade and what

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.620 
stick is the dual density blade and what
that<00:01:19.200> allows<00:01:19.320> us<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.799> do<00:01:19.950> is<00:01:20.130> give<00:01:20.939> you<00:01:21.090> some<00:01:21.330> a

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
that allows us to do is give you some a

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.539 
that allows us to do is give you some a
stiffer<00:01:22.140> foam<00:01:22.350> here<00:01:22.619> in<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.860> heel<00:01:23.130> that's

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
stiffer foam here in the heel that's

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.190 
stiffer foam here in the heel that's
going<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:23.760> provide<00:01:24.090> structural<00:01:24.630> support<00:01:24.720> to

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
going to provide structural support to

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.240 
going to provide structural support to
the<00:01:25.290> blade<00:01:25.500> so<00:01:25.740> that<00:01:25.770> when<00:01:25.950> you<00:01:26.040> take<00:01:26.220> that

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
the blade so that when you take that

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.920 
the blade so that when you take that
slap<00:01:26.640> shot<00:01:26.850> it's<00:01:27.030> not<00:01:27.180> going<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.390> open<00:01:27.630> up<00:01:27.750> on

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
slap shot it's not going to open up on

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.780 
slap shot it's not going to open up on
you<00:01:28.049> but<00:01:28.650> we<00:01:28.740> know<00:01:28.890> that<00:01:29.070> those<00:01:29.220> players<00:01:29.460> want

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
you but we know that those players want

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.300 
you but we know that those players want
good<00:01:30.090> soft<00:01:30.450> feel<00:01:30.689> so<00:01:31.100> aramid<00:01:32.100> fiber

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
good soft feel so aramid fiber

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.670 
good soft feel so aramid fiber
reinforced<00:01:33.090> epoxy<00:01:33.240> core<00:01:33.840> it's<00:01:34.380> going<00:01:34.500> to<00:01:34.560> give

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
reinforced epoxy core it's going to give

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.380 
reinforced epoxy core it's going to give
you<00:01:34.770> that<00:01:34.860> really<00:01:35.130> nice<00:01:35.340> soft<00:01:35.670> feel<00:01:35.790> and<00:01:36.090> those

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
you that really nice soft feel and those

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.480 
you that really nice soft feel and those
are<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.689> two<00:01:36.900> things<00:01:36.930> about<00:01:37.380> 195<00:01:38.070> that<00:01:38.400> have

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
are the two things about 195 that have

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.950 
are the two things about 195 that have
really<00:01:38.640> kind<00:01:38.850> of<00:01:38.939> separated<00:01:39.390> itself<00:01:39.810> from

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
really kind of separated itself from

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.420 
really kind of separated itself from
anything<00:01:40.229> we've<00:01:40.500> done<00:01:40.530> in<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:40.860> past<00:01:41.070> was

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
anything we've done in the past was

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.109 
anything we've done in the past was
explosive<00:01:42.299> release<00:01:42.990> with<00:01:43.350> great<00:01:43.770> feel<00:01:44.130> yeah<00:01:45.090> I

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
explosive release with great feel yeah I

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.940 
explosive release with great feel yeah I
mean<00:01:45.270> that<00:01:45.450> definitely<00:01:45.840> is<00:01:46.229> you<00:01:46.500> know<00:01:46.590> nice<00:01:46.740> to

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
mean that definitely is you know nice to

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.859 
mean that definitely is you know nice to
combine<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.280> two<00:01:47.520> of<00:01:47.640> them<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:47.970> so<00:01:48.659> I<00:01:48.689> mean

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
combine the two of them and so I mean

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.240 
combine the two of them and so I mean
just<00:01:49.229> kind<00:01:49.380> of<00:01:49.409> going<00:01:49.530> back<00:01:49.710> to<00:01:49.860> this<00:01:49.950> guy<00:01:50.100> so

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
just kind of going back to this guy so

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.469 
just kind of going back to this guy so
the<00:01:50.369> yellow<00:01:50.670> zones<00:01:50.909> here<00:01:51.150> are<00:01:51.240> going<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.390> be

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
the yellow zones here are going to be

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.120 
the yellow zones here are going to be
the<00:01:51.810> soft<00:01:52.079> regions<00:01:52.470> and<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.650> Reds<00:01:52.890> going<00:01:53.070> to

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
the soft regions and the Reds going to

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.399 
the soft regions and the Reds going to
be<00:01:53.189> where<00:01:53.310> it<00:01:53.400> gets<00:01:53.460> more<00:01:53.640> stiff<00:01:53.939> yep<00:01:54.299> so<00:01:54.570> the

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
be where it gets more stiff yep so the

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.319 
be where it gets more stiff yep so the
guys<00:01:55.619> who<00:01:55.829> who<00:01:56.220> develop<00:01:56.610> our<00:01:56.729> sticks<00:01:56.970> are<00:01:57.150> kind

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
guys who who develop our sticks are kind

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.760 
guys who who develop our sticks are kind
of<00:01:57.390> like<00:01:57.540> kind<00:01:57.840> of<00:01:57.930> like<00:01:58.020> chefs<00:01:58.320> in<00:01:58.500> a<00:01:58.560> kitchen

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
of like kind of like chefs in a kitchen

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.770 
of like kind of like chefs in a kitchen
and<00:01:59.070> they<00:01:59.369> have<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.640> ability<00:01:59.729> to<00:02:00.180> put<00:02:00.750> a

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
and they have the ability to put a

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.120 
and they have the ability to put a
different<00:02:01.170> recipe<00:02:01.350> together<00:02:01.860> and<00:02:02.040> by

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
different recipe together and by

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.639 
different recipe together and by
adjusting<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:03.090> stiffness<00:02:03.750> in<00:02:03.960> certain<00:02:04.560> areas

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
adjusting the stiffness in certain areas

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.920 
adjusting the stiffness in certain areas
whether<00:02:05.070> it's<00:02:05.340> stiffer<00:02:05.820> stiffer<00:02:06.479> like<00:02:06.630> as<00:02:06.780> it

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
whether it's stiffer stiffer like as it

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.779 
whether it's stiffer stiffer like as it
is<00:02:07.049> in<00:02:07.200> this<00:02:07.290> red<00:02:07.530> area<00:02:07.560> or<00:02:08.009> softer<00:02:08.459> as<00:02:08.579> it<00:02:08.700> is

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
is in this red area or softer as it is

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.219 
is in this red area or softer as it is
in<00:02:08.939> the<00:02:09.030> yellow<00:02:09.209> area<00:02:09.420> they<00:02:09.599> can<00:02:09.750> change<00:02:09.989> the

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
in the yellow area they can change the

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.959 
in the yellow area they can change the
way<00:02:10.349> that<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:10.649> stick<00:02:10.860> actually<00:02:11.340> flexes<00:02:11.609> so

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:11.969 
way that the stick actually flexes so

00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:14.299 
way that the stick actually flexes so
that<00:02:12.419> idea<00:02:12.719> of<00:02:12.809> vapor<00:02:13.439> being<00:02:13.829> different<00:02:14.279> from

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:14.309 
that idea of vapor being different from

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:16.700 
that idea of vapor being different from
supreme<00:02:14.879> it's<00:02:15.329> actually<00:02:15.569> a<00:02:15.809> reality<00:02:16.409> and<00:02:16.439> this

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
supreme it's actually a reality and this

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.430 
supreme it's actually a reality and this
allows<00:02:16.890> us<00:02:17.100> to<00:02:17.310> show<00:02:17.550> our<00:02:17.850> retail<00:02:18.840> partners<00:02:18.870> in

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
allows us to show our retail partners in

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.230 
allows us to show our retail partners in
our<00:02:19.590> so<00:02:19.800> our<00:02:19.920> consumers<00:02:20.400> why<00:02:20.700> these<00:02:20.760> sticks

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
our so our consumers why these sticks

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.460 
our so our consumers why these sticks
are<00:02:21.330> different<00:02:21.690> will<00:02:21.870> show<00:02:22.050> you<00:02:22.110> the<00:02:22.290> vapor

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
are different will show you the vapor

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.290 
are different will show you the vapor
and<00:02:22.650> how<00:02:22.770> it<00:02:22.950> kind<00:02:23.100> of<00:02:23.190> it's<00:02:23.430> different<00:02:23.850> when

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
and how it kind of it's different when

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.850 
and how it kind of it's different when
we<00:02:24.390> get<00:02:24.540> to<00:02:24.630> vapor<00:02:24.840> in<00:02:24.990> a<00:02:25.050> little<00:02:25.230> while<00:02:25.380> yeah

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
we get to vapor in a little while yeah

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.490 
we get to vapor in a little while yeah
well<00:02:26.070> I<00:02:26.100> mean<00:02:26.310> I<00:02:26.580> definitely<00:02:26.730> know<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.500> 195

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
well I mean I definitely know the 195

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.650 
well I mean I definitely know the 195
definitely<00:02:29.130> had<00:02:29.280> a<00:02:29.310> big<00:02:29.970> impact<00:02:30.120> on<00:02:30.540> the

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
definitely had a big impact on the

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.080 
definitely had a big impact on the
market<00:02:31.050> and<00:02:31.290> then<00:02:32.100> what's<00:02:32.460> actually<00:02:32.670> let's<00:02:33.000> go

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
market and then what's actually let's go

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.230 
market and then what's actually let's go
on<00:02:33.210> and<00:02:33.330> take<00:02:33.390> a<00:02:33.450> look<00:02:33.630> at<00:02:33.750> that<00:02:33.870> new<00:02:34.680> mexico<00:02:35.240> so

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
on and take a look at that new mexico so

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.840 
on and take a look at that new mexico so
vapor<00:02:37.110> x<00:02:37.350> 60<00:02:37.800> was<00:02:38.730> designed<00:02:39.210> excuse<00:02:39.690> me<00:02:39.810> guys

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
vapor x 60 was designed excuse me guys

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.120 
vapor x 60 was designed excuse me guys
was<00:02:41.850> was<00:02:42.330> designed<00:02:42.720> for<00:02:42.990> a<00:02:43.050> player<00:02:43.410> who<00:02:43.680> wanted

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
was was designed for a player who wanted

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.820 
was was designed for a player who wanted
that<00:02:44.340> quick<00:02:44.670> release<00:02:44.700> so<00:02:45.270> initially<00:02:45.570> vapor<00:02:46.380> 30

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
that quick release so initially vapor 30

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.880 
that quick release so initially vapor 30
light<00:02:47.100> vapor<00:02:47.490> 40<00:02:48.000> had<00:02:48.870> that<00:02:49.080> low<00:02:49.320> kick<00:02:49.590> flex

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
light vapor 40 had that low kick flex

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.070 
light vapor 40 had that low kick flex
profile<00:02:50.340> and<00:02:50.610> you<00:02:50.970> can<00:02:51.090> see<00:02:51.270> here<00:02:51.510> is<00:02:51.600> since

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
profile and you can see here is since

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.470 
profile and you can see here is since
this<00:02:52.230> lower<00:02:52.560> area<00:02:52.980> it's<00:02:53.270> illustrated<00:02:54.270> in<00:02:54.360> the

this lower area it's illustrated in the

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.880 
this lower area it's illustrated in the
yellow<00:02:54.720> that's<00:02:55.170> where<00:02:55.470> it's<00:02:55.590> going<00:02:55.680> to<00:02:55.770> be

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
yellow that's where it's going to be

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.200 
yellow that's where it's going to be
softened<00:02:56.400> it's<00:02:56.550> going<00:02:56.670> to<00:02:56.730> actually<00:02:56.880> give<00:02:57.120> you

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.210 
softened it's going to actually give you

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:58.640 
softened it's going to actually give you
that<00:02:57.360> flex<00:02:57.630> which<00:02:57.810> will<00:02:57.930> give<00:02:58.080> you<00:02:58.170> that<00:02:58.350> quick

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
that flex which will give you that quick

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.520 
that flex which will give you that quick
release<00:02:58.700> but<00:02:59.700> what<00:02:59.880> we<00:03:00.030> were<00:03:00.210> common<00:03:01.110> feedback

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
release but what we were common feedback

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.440 
release but what we were common feedback
was<00:03:01.800> low<00:03:02.430> kick<00:03:02.670> stix<00:03:02.880> don't<00:03:03.090> have<00:03:03.180> a<00:03:03.210> great

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
was low kick stix don't have a great

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.050 
was low kick stix don't have a great
slap<00:03:03.720> shot<00:03:03.990> so<00:03:04.710> by<00:03:04.860> adding<00:03:05.040> a<00:03:05.310> secondary<00:03:05.760> kick

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
slap shot so by adding a secondary kick

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.450 
slap shot so by adding a secondary kick
point<00:03:06.470> when<00:03:07.470> you're<00:03:07.590> taking<00:03:07.770> that<00:03:08.010> slap<00:03:08.280> shot

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:08.460 
point when you're taking that slap shot

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.370 
point when you're taking that slap shot
that<00:03:08.610> secondary<00:03:09.000> kick<00:03:09.240> point<00:03:09.480> gets<00:03:09.990> gets

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
that secondary kick point gets gets

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.770 
that secondary kick point gets gets
activated<00:03:10.920> it<00:03:11.190> the<00:03:11.430> intellisense<00:03:11.970> it<00:03:12.360> senses

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
activated it the intellisense it senses

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.270 
activated it the intellisense it senses
what<00:03:12.900> kind<00:03:13.140> of<00:03:13.200> shot<00:03:13.410> you're<00:03:13.590> taking<00:03:13.890> based<00:03:14.100> on

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
what kind of shot you're taking based on

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.460 
what kind of shot you're taking based on
where<00:03:14.430> your<00:03:14.550> hand<00:03:14.760> is<00:03:14.880> positioned<00:03:15.390> and<00:03:15.540> react

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
where your hand is positioned and react

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:17.720 
where your hand is positioned and react
so<00:03:16.680> that<00:03:16.800> you<00:03:16.890> can<00:03:17.040> get<00:03:17.220> that<00:03:17.250> quick<00:03:17.700> release

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
so that you can get that quick release

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.270 
so that you can get that quick release
on<00:03:18.270> a<00:03:18.330> snapshot<00:03:18.870> or<00:03:19.080> wrist<00:03:19.350> shot<00:03:19.530> but<00:03:20.040> you<00:03:20.100> also

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
on a snapshot or wrist shot but you also

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.640 
on a snapshot or wrist shot but you also
get<00:03:20.610> that<00:03:21.060> extra<00:03:21.450> energy<00:03:21.630> for<00:03:22.080> the<00:03:22.140> explosive

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
get that extra energy for the explosive

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.410 
get that extra energy for the explosive
slap<00:03:22.890> shot<00:03:23.070> and<00:03:23.190> that's<00:03:23.250> what's<00:03:23.520> helped<00:03:23.970> the<00:03:24.240> x

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
slap shot and that's what's helped the x

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.920 
slap shot and that's what's helped the x
60<00:03:24.810> be<00:03:25.290> very<00:03:25.530> very<00:03:25.710> successful<00:03:26.340> for<00:03:26.370> us

60 be very very successful for us

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.990 
60 be very very successful for us
because<00:03:27.930> those<00:03:28.320> kids<00:03:28.620> who<00:03:28.770> had<00:03:29.010> that<00:03:29.280> that<00:03:29.760> low

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
because those kids who had that that low

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.520 
because those kids who had that that low
kick<00:03:30.270> stick<00:03:30.480> and<00:03:30.630> like<00:03:30.750> that<00:03:30.930> low<00:03:31.050> kick<00:03:31.260> stick

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.750 
call arrow foam core two in our blade
we're<00:03:52.350> actually<00:03:52.470> able<00:03:52.650> to<00:03:53.070> create<00:03:53.370> a<00:03:53.400> better

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
we're actually able to create a better

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.670 
we're actually able to create a better
balance<00:03:54.090> point<00:03:54.510> but<00:03:54.960> this<00:03:54.990> material<00:03:55.530> also

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
balance point but this material also

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.590 
balance point but this material also
absorbs<00:03:56.220> a<00:03:56.310> lot<00:03:56.340> of<00:03:56.640> energy<00:03:56.760> on<00:03:57.060> impact<00:03:57.300> so<00:03:57.480> the

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
absorbs a lot of energy on impact so the

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.900 
absorbs a lot of energy on impact so the
puck<00:03:57.810> locks<00:03:58.050> a<00:03:58.170> stick<00:03:58.620> so<00:03:59.190> it's<00:03:59.340> a<00:03:59.400> crisper

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
puck locks a stick so it's a crisper

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.960 
puck locks a stick so it's a crisper
feel<00:04:00.440> then<00:04:01.440> 195<00:04:02.100> which<00:04:02.250> has<00:04:02.430> a<00:04:02.460> little<00:04:02.730> bit<00:04:02.910> of

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
feel then 195 which has a little bit of

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.120 
feel then 195 which has a little bit of
a<00:04:03.210> kind<00:04:03.690> of<00:04:03.720> a<00:04:03.810> softer<00:04:04.350> more<00:04:04.500> cushion<00:04:04.920> field

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
a kind of a softer more cushion field

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:06.830 
a kind of a softer more cushion field
this<00:04:05.490> has<00:04:05.700> that<00:04:05.910> crisper<00:04:06.300> feel<00:04:06.480> that<00:04:06.690> those

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
this has that crisper feel that those

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.870 
this has that crisper feel that those
low<00:04:07.080> kick<00:04:07.320> guys<00:04:07.530> are<00:04:07.770> really<00:04:08.040> looking<00:04:08.280> for<00:04:08.670> so

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
low kick guys are really looking for so

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.060 
low kick guys are really looking for so
little<00:04:09.630> bit<00:04:09.870> different<00:04:10.230> shaft<00:04:10.470> shape<00:04:10.710> as<00:04:10.890> well

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.070 
little bit different shaft shape as well

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:12.230 
little bit different shaft shape as well
it's<00:04:11.220> going<00:04:11.310> to<00:04:11.400> be<00:04:11.460> a<00:04:11.490> little<00:04:11.610> bit<00:04:11.730> rounder<00:04:12.120> so

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:12.240 
it's going to be a little bit rounder so

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.270 
it's going to be a little bit rounder so
it's<00:04:12.390> easier<00:04:12.720> to<00:04:12.900> you<00:04:13.320> know<00:04:13.410> to<00:04:13.590> roll<00:04:13.920> the<00:04:14.070> rest

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
it's easier to you know to roll the rest

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.099 
it's easier to you know to roll the rest
and<00:04:14.490> dangle<00:04:14.820> a<00:04:15.120> little<00:04:15.510> bit<00:04:15.600> easier<00:04:15.720> to<00:04:16.020> get

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
and dangle a little bit easier to get

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:17.660 
and dangle a little bit easier to get
that<00:04:16.320> shot<00:04:16.560> off<00:04:16.590> so<00:04:16.920> we're<00:04:17.070> supremes<00:04:17.430> is<00:04:17.549> going

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:17.670 
that shot off so we're supremes is going

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:19.340 
that shot off so we're supremes is going
to<00:04:17.730> be<00:04:17.820> a<00:04:17.850> lot<00:04:18.030> more<00:04:18.090> square<00:04:18.480> paper<00:04:19.049> is<00:04:19.230> going

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
to be a lot more square paper is going

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.380 
to be a lot more square paper is going
to<00:04:19.440> be<00:04:19.500> a<00:04:19.530> bit<00:04:19.739> more<00:04:19.890> round<00:04:20.190> so<00:04:20.460> you've<00:04:20.910> got<00:04:21.180> the

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
to be a bit more round so you've got the

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:24.290 
to be a bit more round so you've got the
the<00:04:21.420> nonstick<00:04:22.410> inversion<00:04:22.980> and<00:04:23.130> this<00:04:24.030> is<00:04:24.180> the

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
the nonstick inversion and this is the

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:25.580 
the nonstick inversion and this is the
stick<00:04:24.510> inversion<00:04:24.900> in<00:04:25.050> the<00:04:25.140> black<00:04:25.320> and<00:04:25.500> the

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
stick inversion in the black and the

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.700 
stick inversion in the black and the
white<00:04:25.940> really<00:04:26.940> it's<00:04:27.210> a<00:04:27.390> matter<00:04:28.080> of<00:04:28.230> choice<00:04:28.500> for

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
white really it's a matter of choice for

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.810 
white really it's a matter of choice for
the<00:04:28.800> consumer<00:04:29.310> whether<00:04:30.150> they<00:04:30.330> won't<00:04:30.510> stick

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
the consumer whether they won't stick

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.160 
the consumer whether they won't stick
non<00:04:31.030> stick<00:04:31.270> them<00:04:31.390> but<00:04:31.540> we<00:04:31.630> know<00:04:31.750> that<00:04:31.960> kids

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:32.170 
non stick them but we know that kids

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:33.780 
non stick them but we know that kids
want<00:04:32.350> options<00:04:32.500> as<00:04:32.830> far<00:04:32.860> as<00:04:33.220> graphics<00:04:33.640> and

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:33.790 
want options as far as graphics and

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:35.610 
want options as far as graphics and
design<00:04:33.880> so<00:04:34.360> I<00:04:34.600> want<00:04:35.080> to<00:04:35.170> make<00:04:35.260> sure<00:04:35.290> they<00:04:35.530> had

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
design so I want to make sure they had

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.890 
design so I want to make sure they had
two<00:04:35.770> different<00:04:36.040> options<00:04:36.130> out<00:04:36.520> there<00:04:36.550> so<00:04:36.970> yeah

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
two different options out there so yeah

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.260 
two different options out there so yeah
I<00:04:37.930> mean<00:04:38.050> definitely<00:04:38.230> the<00:04:38.790> shack<00:04:39.790> dimensions

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
I mean definitely the shack dimensions

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.270 
I mean definitely the shack dimensions
has<00:04:40.420> a<00:04:40.450> nice<00:04:41.110> soft<00:04:41.440> feel<00:04:41.560> to<00:04:41.740> it<00:04:41.890> when<00:04:42.190> you're

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
has a nice soft feel to it when you're

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.520 
has a nice soft feel to it when you're
home<00:04:42.400> it<00:04:42.610> so<00:04:43.240> that<00:04:43.420> the<00:04:43.450> shaft<00:04:43.930> dimension<00:04:44.410> we

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530 
home it so that the shaft dimension we

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:47.010 
home it so that the shaft dimension we
we<00:04:44.920> internally<00:04:45.220> call<00:04:45.490> the<00:04:45.640> Schultz<00:04:45.970> shaft<00:04:46.210> it

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020 
we internally call the Schultz shaft it

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.180 
we internally call the Schultz shaft it
was<00:04:47.140> actually<00:04:47.440> a<00:04:47.470> custom<00:04:47.800> shaft<00:04:48.010> that<00:04:48.130> was

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.190 
was actually a custom shaft that was

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:50.490 
was actually a custom shaft that was
built<00:04:48.430> for<00:04:48.550> an<00:04:48.640> NHL<00:04:48.970> athlete<00:04:49.390> and<00:04:49.570> it<00:04:50.140> just<00:04:50.380> had

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
built for an NHL athlete and it just had

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.860

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:57.520 
the big features with with vapor this

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.070 
the big features with with vapor this
year<00:05:57.700> going<00:05:57.880> forward<00:05:57.970> was<00:05:58.510> we<00:05:58.930> actually

00:05:59.070 --> 00:05:59.080 
year going forward was we actually

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:00.960 
year going forward was we actually
expanded<00:05:59.770> the<00:05:59.890> throat<00:06:00.190> out<00:06:00.340> so<00:06:00.580> the<00:06:00.700> throat

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:00.970 
expanded the throat out so the throat

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:02.490 
expanded the throat out so the throat
area<00:06:01.120> is<00:06:01.270> a<00:06:01.330> lot<00:06:01.480> thicker<00:06:01.750> not<00:06:02.110> a<00:06:02.140> lot<00:06:02.350> thicker

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:02.500 
area is a lot thicker not a lot thicker

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:03.930 
area is a lot thicker not a lot thicker
but<00:06:02.710> it's<00:06:02.890> thicker<00:06:03.130> and<00:06:03.580> what<00:06:03.730> that<00:06:03.850> allows

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:03.940 
but it's thicker and what that allows

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:06.210 
but it's thicker and what that allows
the<00:06:04.270> blade<00:06:04.480> to<00:06:04.630> do<00:06:04.780> is<00:06:04.930> stay<00:06:05.320> more<00:06:05.530> closed<00:06:05.890> upon

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:06.220 
the blade to do is stay more closed upon

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:07.620 
the blade to do is stay more closed upon
impact<00:06:06.610> with<00:06:06.760> the<00:06:06.880> puck<00:06:07.120> so<00:06:07.270> you're<00:06:07.420> not<00:06:07.510> going

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:07.630 
impact with the puck so you're not going
