so what we're really talking about here
is<00:01:58.100> a<00:01:58.130> unity<00:01:58.460> of<00:01:58.490> Dragon<00:01:58.970> and<00:01:59.060> man<00:01:59.300> before<00:01:59.780> the

really interesting part of this trailer

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.930 
really interesting part of this trailer
is<00:02:30.560> that<00:02:30.739> we<00:02:30.980> actually<00:02:31.130> meet<00:02:31.550> the<00:02:31.670> big<00:02:31.820> man

himself<00:02:32.000> in<00:02:32.630> the<00:02:32.959> sea<00:02:33.140> of<00:02:33.170> clouds<00:02:33.550> it's<00:02:34.550> hard

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
himself in the sea of clouds it's hard

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:35.979 
himself in the sea of clouds it's hard
to<00:02:34.790> speculate<00:02:35.180> exactly<00:02:35.690> what<00:02:35.840> he's<00:02:35.959> doing

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
to speculate exactly what he's doing

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:38.380 
to speculate exactly what he's doing
here<00:02:36.530> but<00:02:36.680> it<00:02:36.800> must<00:02:37.010> be<00:02:37.190> something<00:02:37.880> pretty<00:02:37.910> big

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
here but it must be something pretty big

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.470 
here but it must be something pretty big
to<00:02:38.630> bring<00:02:38.750> Galvis<00:02:39.320> to<00:02:39.650> a<00:02:39.680> gauzy<00:02:40.040> in<00:02:40.310> person<00:02:40.880> we

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
to bring Galvis to a gauzy in person we

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.000 
to bring Galvis to a gauzy in person we
see<00:02:41.660> some<00:02:41.840> vana<00:02:42.110> vana<00:02:42.410> with<00:02:42.709> his<00:02:42.860> entourage

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
see some vana vana with his entourage

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.310 
see some vana vana with his entourage
but<00:02:43.550> it<00:02:44.000> actually<00:02:44.150> seemed<00:02:44.510> to<00:02:44.630> be<00:02:44.720> restrained

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
but it actually seemed to be restrained

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.910 
but it actually seemed to be restrained
to<00:02:45.470> one<00:02:45.709> another<00:02:45.980> as<00:02:46.280> prisoners<00:02:47.209> to<00:02:47.390> me<00:02:47.920> so

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
to one another as prisoners to me so

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.040 
to one another as prisoners to me so
this<00:02:49.730> scene<00:02:50.000> may<00:02:50.209> well<00:02:50.450> have<00:02:50.600> something<00:02:50.870> to<00:02:50.959> do

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
this scene may well have something to do

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.050 
this scene may well have something to do
with<00:02:51.170> bish<00:02:51.410> mark<00:02:51.709> and<00:02:52.040> without<00:02:52.730> goals

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
with bish mark and without goals

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.150 
with bish mark and without goals
aligning<00:02:53.750> with<00:02:53.959> that<00:02:54.290> of<00:02:54.410> the<00:02:54.440> Guardians<00:02:55.010> in

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
aligning with that of the Guardians in

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.190 
aligning with that of the Guardians in
dealing<00:02:55.519> with<00:02:55.550> the<00:02:55.700> primal<00:02:55.970> but<00:02:56.840> I<00:02:56.989> suspect

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
dealing with the primal but I suspect

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.229 
dealing with the primal but I suspect
that<00:02:57.440> the<00:02:57.620> galleons<00:02:58.010> are<00:02:58.160> going<00:02:58.550> to<00:02:58.700> tie<00:02:58.910> a<00:02:58.940> bit

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
that the galleons are going to tie a bit

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:01.479 
that the galleons are going to tie a bit
closer<00:02:59.630> with<00:02:59.900> the<00:02:59.989> theme<00:03:00.290> of<00:03:00.320> heavens<00:03:01.010> one<00:03:01.220> I

closer with the theme of heavens one I

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:04.319 
closer with the theme of heavens one I
know<00:03:02.180> this<00:03:02.510> is<00:03:02.660> big<00:03:02.840> leap<00:03:03.049> but<00:03:03.170> hear<00:03:03.620> me<00:03:03.650> out

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:04.329 
know this is big leap but hear me out

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:07.030 
know this is big leap but hear me out
when<00:03:05.329> we<00:03:05.450> first<00:03:05.600> entered<00:03:06.019> the<00:03:06.049> binding<00:03:06.560> coils

when we first entered the binding coils
it<00:03:07.160> was<00:03:07.250> primarily<00:03:07.730> to<00:03:08.060> prevent<00:03:08.540> the

some comments about how how eagerly the

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
they were ever to find out about it well

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.890 
they were ever to find out about it well
I<00:03:27.200> think<00:03:27.350> that<00:03:27.620> they<00:03:27.739> have<00:03:27.769> I<00:03:28.390> think<00:03:29.390> Galvis

I think that they have I think Galvis

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.699 
I think that they have I think Galvis
has<00:03:30.140> the<00:03:30.290> same<00:03:30.530> idea<00:03:31.070> as<00:03:31.370> zandi's<00:03:32.440> to<00:03:33.440> enslave

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
has the same idea as zandi's to enslave

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:35.740 
has the same idea as zandi's to enslave
and<00:03:33.950> weaponize<00:03:34.340> a<00:03:34.370> horde<00:03:34.730> of<00:03:34.790> dragons<00:03:35.299> there's

for some reason I really hope that
scholars<00:05:17.190> get<00:05:17.310> a<00:05:17.340> replica<00:05:17.580> of<00:05:17.789> it<00:05:18.030> and<00:05:18.210> that

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
scholars get a replica of it and that

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.629 
scholars get a replica of it and that
each<00:05:18.449> time<00:05:18.479> they<00:05:18.960> because<00:05:19.770> ruin<00:05:20.159> this<00:05:20.250> demon

so<00:05:22.470> excited<00:05:22.830> for<00:05:22.949> the<00:05:23.009> library<00:05:23.340> I<00:05:23.520> tried<00:05:24.509> to

00:05:24.649 --> 00:05:24.659 
so excited for the library I tried to

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:26.719 
so excited for the library I tried to
translate<00:05:24.930> the<00:05:25.199> writing<00:05:25.470> in<00:05:25.889> the<00:05:26.220> demon<00:05:26.550> book

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:26.729 
translate the writing in the demon book

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:28.700 
translate the writing in the demon book
but<00:05:27.120> at<00:05:27.509> this<00:05:27.690> resolution<00:05:28.080> all<00:05:28.500> I<00:05:28.560> could

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:28.710 
but at this resolution all I could

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.330 
but at this resolution all I could
really<00:05:29.280> make<00:05:29.430> up<00:05:29.699> was<00:05:30.000> the<00:05:30.150> first<00:05:30.479> title<00:05:31.340> Ben

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:32.340 
really make up was the first title Ben

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:36.140 
really make up was the first title Ben
tetas<00:05:32.699> lot<00:05:33.090> boom<00:05:33.389> and<00:05:33.630> the<00:05:34.259> larger<00:05:34.680> one<00:05:35.150> v'let

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150 
tetas lot boom and the larger one v'let

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.839 
tetas lot boom and the larger one v'let
chaos<00:05:36.710> so<00:05:37.710> the<00:05:37.830> titles<00:05:38.159> at<00:05:38.250> least<00:05:38.430> seem<00:05:38.610> to<00:05:38.759> be

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:38.849 
chaos so the titles at least seem to be

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:41.210 
chaos so the titles at least seem to be
in<00:05:38.940> the<00:05:39.000> language<00:05:39.360> that<00:05:39.630> the<00:05:40.139> assian<00:05:40.650> speak<00:05:41.009> or

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:41.220 
in the language that the assian speak or

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:43.820 
in the language that the assian speak or
perhaps<00:05:41.400> Dragon<00:05:42.030> tongue<00:05:42.240> or<00:05:42.570> I've<00:05:43.380> got<00:05:43.590> it<00:05:43.710> all

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:43.830 
perhaps Dragon tongue or I've got it all

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:46.850 
perhaps Dragon tongue or I've got it all
wrong<00:05:44.070> and<00:05:44.130> it's<00:05:44.580> it's<00:05:44.969> gibberish<00:05:45.740> if<00:05:46.740> it

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:46.860 
wrong and it's it's gibberish if it

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.010 
wrong and it's it's gibberish if it
doesn't<00:05:47.009> translate<00:05:47.520> to<00:05:47.639> English<00:05:48.060> then<00:05:48.599> I

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:49.020 
doesn't translate to English then I

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:50.990 
doesn't translate to English then I
really<00:05:49.740> hope<00:05:49.889> Cody<00:05:50.070> Fox<00:05:50.370> will<00:05:50.550> offer<00:05:50.729> us<00:05:50.820> some

next<00:05:53.710> I<00:05:53.770> think<00:05:53.800> this<00:05:53.979> is<00:05:54.070> probably<00:05:54.250> the<00:05:54.400> the

great wings before they began summoning

00:06:32.949 --> 00:06:35.129

Garuda and subsequent generations were

00:06:35.139 --> 00:06:38.939 
Garuda and subsequent generations were
born<00:06:35.380> without<00:06:35.710> wings<00:06:37.560> interesting<00:06:38.560> that<00:06:38.830> we

00:06:38.939 --> 00:06:38.949 
born without wings interesting that we

00:06:38.949 --> 00:06:40.650 
born without wings interesting that we
see<00:06:39.130> now<00:06:39.280> the<00:06:39.340> elegans<00:06:39.910> were<00:06:40.060> collecting<00:06:40.570> the

ancient<00:06:40.990> exile<00:06:41.289> II<00:06:41.410> maybe<00:06:41.949> they<00:06:42.130> were<00:06:42.220> trying

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:42.250 
ancient exile II maybe they were trying

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:45.390 
ancient exile II maybe they were trying
to<00:06:42.610> intern<00:06:43.240> Garuda<00:06:43.810> in<00:06:43.960> a<00:06:44.050> similar<00:06:44.470> way<00:06:44.500> to

to intern Garuda in a similar way to

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.029 
to intern Garuda in a similar way to
Bahamut<00:06:46.210> or<00:06:46.330> maybe<00:06:46.780> as<00:06:46.930> some<00:06:47.139> prototype<00:06:47.800> for

dalam woods which I think we might be
looking<00:06:50.349> at<00:06:50.620> here<00:06:51.039> or<00:06:51.479> maybe<00:06:52.479> it<00:06:52.660> was<00:06:52.690> in<00:06:52.960> fact

00:06:53.189 --> 00:06:53.199 
looking at here or maybe it was in fact

00:06:53.199 --> 00:06:55.260
