00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.670 

it<00:01:00.480> was<00:01:00.600> interesting<00:01:00.900> because<00:01:01.110> I<00:01:01.350> didn't

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
it was interesting because I didn't

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.400 
it was interesting because I didn't
really<00:01:01.890> know<00:01:02.630> how<00:01:03.630> people<00:01:03.960> would<00:01:04.019> react

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:04.410 
really know how people would react

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:06.380 
really know how people would react
underwater<00:01:05.190> I<00:01:05.309> didn't<00:01:05.730> know<00:01:05.820> how<00:01:06.000> long<00:01:06.060> people

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
underwater I didn't know how long people

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.420 
underwater I didn't know how long people
could<00:01:06.630> stay<00:01:06.840> down<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:07.110> I<00:01:07.530> will<00:01:07.740> say<00:01:07.980> shooting

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
could stay down and I will say shooting

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.160 
could stay down and I will say shooting
underwater<00:01:08.880> is<00:01:09.090> one<00:01:09.300> of<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.479> toughest<00:01:09.930> things

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
underwater is one of the toughest things

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:24.480 
underwater is one of the toughest things
that<00:01:10.590> you<00:01:10.680> can<00:01:10.860> do<00:01:11.040> yeah

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:42.810 

you

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.730 

big<00:01:43.270> challenge<00:01:43.570> for<00:01:43.810> me<00:01:43.990> with<00:01:44.259> the<00:01:44.350> submerged

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
big challenge for me with the submerged

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.070 
big challenge for me with the submerged
series<00:01:45.159> was<00:01:45.460> being<00:01:45.880> able<00:01:46.000> to<00:01:46.299> stay<00:01:46.780> down

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:47.080 
series was being able to stay down

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.920 
series was being able to stay down
longer<00:01:47.560> than<00:01:47.830> anyone<00:01:48.130> else<00:01:48.509> it<00:01:49.509> was<00:01:49.630> really

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
longer than anyone else it was really

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.800 
longer than anyone else it was really
important<00:01:50.700> for<00:01:51.700> me<00:01:51.850> to<00:01:51.880> be<00:01:52.119> able<00:01:52.240> to<00:01:52.390> sit<00:01:52.689> on

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
important for me to be able to sit on

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.080 
important for me to be able to sit on
the<00:01:52.899> bottom<00:01:53.380> and<00:01:53.680> let<00:01:54.130> everyone<00:01:54.399> else<00:01:54.520> go<00:01:54.820> up

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
the bottom and let everyone else go up

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.020 
the bottom and let everyone else go up
and<00:01:55.270> down<00:01:55.360> for<00:01:55.630> breath<00:01:55.869> I<00:01:56.759> wanted<00:01:57.759> to<00:01:57.850> be<00:01:57.939> able

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
and down for breath I wanted to be able

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.020 
and down for breath I wanted to be able
to<00:01:58.149> get<00:01:58.360> as<00:01:58.869> many<00:01:59.259> shots<00:01:59.680> as<00:01:59.860> I<00:02:00.009> could<00:02:00.340> in<00:02:00.940> a

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
to get as many shots as I could in a

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.080 
to get as many shots as I could in a
very<00:02:01.270> short<00:02:01.570> amount<00:02:01.659> of<00:02:01.869> time<00:02:01.930> and<00:02:02.789> so<00:02:03.789> I<00:02:03.820> had

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
very short amount of time and so I had

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.260 
very short amount of time and so I had
to<00:02:04.210> learn<00:02:04.360> how<00:02:04.600> to<00:02:04.630> hold<00:02:04.840> my<00:02:05.080> breath<00:02:05.380> I<00:02:06.270> watched

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
to learn how to hold my breath I watched

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.630 
to learn how to hold my breath I watched
a<00:02:07.479> video<00:02:07.659> on<00:02:08.200> the<00:02:08.470> best<00:02:08.679> free<00:02:09.039> diver<00:02:09.280> in<00:02:09.519> the

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
a video on the best free diver in the

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.150 
a video on the best free diver in the
world<00:02:09.850> and<00:02:10.239> I<00:02:10.539> began<00:02:10.840> to<00:02:10.989> emulate<00:02:11.319> how<00:02:11.709> he<00:02:11.769> held

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
world and I began to emulate how he held

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.430 
world and I began to emulate how he held
his<00:02:12.280> breath<00:02:12.420> which<00:02:13.420> really<00:02:13.900> came<00:02:14.110> in<00:02:14.260> handy

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
his breath which really came in handy

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.620 
his breath which really came in handy
and<00:02:14.800> it<00:02:14.890> gave<00:02:15.040> me<00:02:15.220> a<00:02:15.250> great<00:02:15.519> ability<00:02:15.730> I<00:02:16.150> would

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
and it gave me a great ability I would

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.059 
and it gave me a great ability I would
go<00:02:16.750> down<00:02:16.780> to<00:02:16.959> the<00:02:17.140> bottom<00:02:17.380> and<00:02:17.709> I<00:02:17.769> would<00:02:17.920> just

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069 
go down to the bottom and I would just

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:20.190 
go down to the bottom and I would just
watch<00:02:18.310> us<00:02:18.610> as<00:02:18.819> they<00:02:19.269> would<00:02:19.390> come<00:02:19.600> down<00:02:19.660> and

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
watch us as they would come down and

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.720 
watch us as they would come down and
then<00:02:20.290> somebody<00:02:21.010> would<00:02:21.160> go<00:02:21.280> up<00:02:21.430> for<00:02:21.610> another

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
then somebody would go up for another

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.400 
then somebody would go up for another
breath<00:02:22.000> somebody<00:02:22.330> else<00:02:22.480> would<00:02:22.630> come<00:02:22.810> down<00:02:23.049> and

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
breath somebody else would come down and

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.309 
breath somebody else would come down and
and<00:02:23.590> it<00:02:24.549> gave<00:02:24.819> me<00:02:25.090> it<00:02:25.750> gave<00:02:25.959> me<00:02:26.080> a<00:02:26.110> great

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 
and it gave me it gave me a great

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:28.350 
and it gave me it gave me a great
freedom<00:02:26.920> to<00:02:27.069> just<00:02:27.220> be<00:02:27.370> able<00:02:27.459> to<00:02:27.610> sit<00:02:27.880> there<00:02:28.150> and

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
freedom to just be able to sit there and

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.970 
freedom to just be able to sit there and
I<00:02:29.200> could<00:02:29.380> review<00:02:29.709> the<00:02:29.830> photos<00:02:30.040> I<00:02:30.760> could<00:02:31.360> just

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
I could review the photos I could just

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.590 
I could review the photos I could just
watch<00:02:32.980> and<00:02:33.310> see<00:02:33.489> exactly<00:02:34.000> what<00:02:34.330> I<00:02:34.360> was<00:02:34.540> doing

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
watch and see exactly what I was doing

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.900 
watch and see exactly what I was doing
without<00:02:35.590> having<00:02:35.769> to<00:02:36.160> go<00:02:36.310> back<00:02:36.340> up<00:02:36.730> without

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
without having to go back up without

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.100 
without having to go back up without
having<00:02:37.180> to<00:02:37.390> think<00:02:37.540> about<00:02:37.660> it<00:02:37.959> I<00:02:38.049> could

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
having to think about it I could

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.259 
having to think about it I could
literally<00:02:38.530> use<00:02:38.920> the<00:02:39.100> camera<00:02:39.580> on<00:02:39.700> the<00:02:39.970> bottom

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.490 
of the ocean bottom of the pool wherever
we<00:02:42.340> were<00:02:42.489> it<00:02:42.670> didn't<00:02:42.940> matter<00:02:43.060> I<00:02:43.390> had<00:02:43.989> complete
