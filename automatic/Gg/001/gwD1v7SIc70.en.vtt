it<00:01:28.829> comes<00:01:28.979> to<00:01:29.100> light<00:01:29.220> edge<00:01:29.400> profiling<00:01:30.119> yeah<00:01:30.420> or

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
it comes to light edge profiling yeah or

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.359 
it comes to light edge profiling yeah or
I<00:01:30.630> this<00:01:31.290> particular<00:01:31.439> case<00:01:31.829> I<00:01:31.950> also<00:01:32.100> like<00:01:32.280> to

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
I this particular case I also like to

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.569 
I this particular case I also like to
use<00:01:32.490> this<00:01:32.610> one<00:01:32.820> in<00:01:32.939> my<00:01:33.060> router<00:01:33.479> table<00:01:33.840> yeah<00:01:34.290> and

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:34.579 
use this one in my router table yeah and

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:36.469 
use this one in my router table yeah and
occasionally<00:01:35.579> if<00:01:35.670> I<00:01:35.759> have<00:01:35.970> just<00:01:36.210> like<00:01:36.329> some

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
occasionally if I have just like some

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:37.819 
occasionally if I have just like some
straight<00:01:36.720> cuts<00:01:36.930> like<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.079> nice<00:01:37.259> groove<00:01:37.619> or

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
straight cuts like a nice groove or

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.170 
straight cuts like a nice groove or
something<00:01:38.130> or<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:38.310> dado<00:01:38.579> that's<00:01:38.880> going<00:01:39.060> from

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
something or a dado that's going from

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.880 
something or a dado that's going from
one<00:01:39.299> end<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.570> other<00:01:39.689> it's<00:01:40.229> perfect<00:01:40.590> for<00:01:40.619> it

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
one end to the other it's perfect for it

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.289 
one end to the other it's perfect for it
ok<00:01:41.400> so<00:01:41.460> what<00:01:41.640> sort<00:01:41.820> of<00:01:41.880> woods<00:01:42.030> were<00:01:42.210> you

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
ok so what sort of woods were you

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.639 
ok so what sort of woods were you
chewing<00:01:42.509> through<00:01:42.689> oh<00:01:42.960> well<00:01:43.290> we<00:01:43.409> were<00:01:43.500> using

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
chewing through oh well we were using

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.530 
chewing through oh well we were using
this<00:01:43.860> I'm<00:01:44.009> oak<00:01:44.250> we<00:01:44.490> used<00:01:44.640> it<00:01:44.790> on<00:01:44.880> maple<00:01:45.390> you

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
this I'm oak we used it on maple you

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.389 
this I'm oak we used it on maple you
know<00:01:45.659> some<00:01:45.869> nice<00:01:46.049> dense<00:01:46.439> hardwoods<00:01:47.009> that<00:01:47.280> are

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
know some nice dense hardwoods that are

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.190 
know some nice dense hardwoods that are
really<00:01:47.670> gonna<00:01:47.790> kind<00:01:48.119> of<00:01:48.210> see<00:01:48.689> what<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.899> motors

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
really gonna kind of see what the motors

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.649 
really gonna kind of see what the motors
made<00:01:49.380> of<00:01:49.560> variability<00:01:50.280> of<00:01:50.490> bits<00:01:50.759> used<00:01:51.119> I<00:01:51.540> used

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
made of variability of bits used I used

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.380 
made of variability of bits used I used
I'd<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.439> some<00:01:52.619> nice<00:01:53.159> narrow<00:01:53.579> straight<00:01:54.090> bits

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
I'd and some nice narrow straight bits

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.999 
I'd and some nice narrow straight bits
all<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.630> way<00:01:54.720> up<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:54.869> a<00:01:54.899> big<00:01:55.140> old<00:01:55.229> panel<00:01:55.740> bit

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
all the way up to a big old panel bit

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.300 
all the way up to a big old panel bit
and<00:01:56.299> that<00:01:57.299> motor<00:01:57.540> guess<00:01:57.960> it<00:01:58.259> just<00:01:58.560> breezed

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
and that motor guess it just breezed

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.920 
and that motor guess it just breezed
right<00:01:59.460> through<00:01:59.579> home<00:01:59.909> with<00:02:00.060> hogs<00:02:00.329> it<00:02:00.630> did<00:02:00.780> not

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
right through home with hogs it did not

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.770 
right through home with hogs it did not
Bob<00:02:01.200> exactly<00:02:02.100> yes<00:02:02.430> cool<00:02:03.030> I'll<00:02:03.450> tell<00:02:03.630> you<00:02:03.689> what

through a top to bottom as we talk about

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.779

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
design ok and tell me what you like and

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.699 
design ok and tell me what you like and
don't<00:02:09.000> like<00:02:09.119> about<00:02:09.360> it<00:02:09.539> ok<00:02:09.780> well<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:10.050> number

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
don't like about it ok well the number

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:11.839 
don't like about it ok well the number
one<00:02:10.860> thing<00:02:11.039> is<00:02:11.129> when<00:02:11.340> you're<00:02:11.459> taking<00:02:11.640> a<00:02:11.700> look

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
one thing is when you're taking a look

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.350 
one thing is when you're taking a look
at<00:02:11.940> this<00:02:12.090> you<00:02:12.209> can<00:02:12.330> see<00:02:12.360> that<00:02:12.569> it<00:02:12.810> it's

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
at this you can see that it it's

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.970 
at this you can see that it it's
short<00:02:13.780> and<00:02:13.960> stout<00:02:14.230> for<00:02:14.500> some<00:02:14.620> reason<00:02:14.830> I<00:02:14.890> have

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
short and stout for some reason I have

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.890 
short and stout for some reason I have
an<00:02:15.070> affinity<00:02:15.280> for<00:02:15.520> short<00:02:15.940> and<00:02:16.060> stout<00:02:16.270> as<00:02:16.540> your

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
an affinity for short and stout as your

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.560 
an affinity for short and stout as your
wife<00:02:17.020> yes<00:02:17.410> yeah<00:02:17.710> exactly<00:02:17.860> I<00:02:18.220> know<00:02:18.340> so<00:02:19.030> uh<00:02:19.060> but

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
wife yes yeah exactly I know so uh but

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.570 
wife yes yeah exactly I know so uh but
that's<00:02:19.750> one<00:02:19.930> thing<00:02:20.080> I<00:02:20.200> really<00:02:20.980> like<00:02:21.130> about<00:02:21.160> is

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
that's one thing I really like about is

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.760 
that's one thing I really like about is
the<00:02:21.760> overall<00:02:22.210> size<00:02:22.570> because<00:02:23.260> when<00:02:23.440> I<00:02:23.470> am

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
the overall size because when I am

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.560 
the overall size because when I am
coming<00:02:23.950> around<00:02:24.220> those<00:02:24.400> edge<00:02:24.610> profiles<00:02:25.120> it's

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
coming around those edge profiles it's

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.480 
coming around those edge profiles it's
not<00:02:25.810> tippy<00:02:26.260> on<00:02:26.410> me<00:02:26.590> it's<00:02:26.740> gonna<00:02:26.890> stay<00:02:27.160> right<00:02:27.370> in

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
not tippy on me it's gonna stay right in

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.670 
not tippy on me it's gonna stay right in
place<00:02:27.730> and<00:02:28.000> I<00:02:28.210> even<00:02:28.330> found<00:02:28.690> that<00:02:28.810> as<00:02:29.020> I<00:02:29.200> was

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
place and I even found that as I was

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:30.930 
place and I even found that as I was
coming<00:02:29.980> around<00:02:30.070> from<00:02:30.310> those<00:02:30.430> corners<00:02:30.820> the

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
coming around from those corners the

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.820 
coming around from those corners the
corners<00:02:30.970> are<00:02:31.420> where<00:02:31.540> you<00:02:31.660> tend<00:02:31.900> to<00:02:31.960> tip<00:02:32.200> and

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
corners are where you tend to tip and

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.290 
corners are where you tend to tip and
even<00:02:33.130> as<00:02:33.250> I<00:02:33.310> was<00:02:33.460> kind<00:02:33.580> of<00:02:33.700> stretching<00:02:34.210> out

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
even as I was kind of stretching out

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.000 
even as I was kind of stretching out
more<00:02:34.570> than<00:02:34.690> I<00:02:34.750> probably<00:02:34.900> should<00:02:35.140> have<00:02:35.590> it

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
more than I probably should have it

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.770 
more than I probably should have it
stayed<00:02:36.400> exactly<00:02:37.030> where<00:02:37.150> it<00:02:37.240> was<00:02:37.300> supposed<00:02:37.660> to

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
stayed exactly where it was supposed to

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.199 
stayed exactly where it was supposed to
be<00:02:37.930> Sokka<00:02:38.380> that<00:02:38.560> was<00:02:39.100> really<00:02:39.580> really<00:02:39.670> nice<00:02:39.940> in

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
be Sokka that was really really nice in

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:41.400 
be Sokka that was really really nice in
fact<00:02:40.300> that's<00:02:40.510> that's<00:02:40.840> something<00:02:41.320> I

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
fact that's that's something I

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:42.660 
fact that's that's something I
absolutely<00:02:41.740> love<00:02:42.100> about<00:02:42.340> it

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
absolutely love about it

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.850 
absolutely love about it
another<00:02:43.209> thing<00:02:43.450> the<00:02:43.780> handles<00:02:44.290> handles<00:02:44.530> are

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
another thing the handles handles are

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.710 
another thing the handles handles are
important<00:02:45.310> to<00:02:45.400> me<00:02:45.490> because<00:02:45.640> if<00:02:46.030> you<00:02:46.390> feel<00:02:46.600> like

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
important to me because if you feel like

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:47.910 
important to me because if you feel like
you're<00:02:46.900> not<00:02:47.050> holding<00:02:47.260> on<00:02:47.410> to<00:02:47.560> it<00:02:47.680> the<00:02:47.770> right

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
you're not holding on to it the right

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.040 
you're not holding on to it the right
way<00:02:48.160> when<00:02:48.520> that<00:02:48.640> motor<00:02:49.000> engages<00:02:49.209> and<00:02:49.750> the<00:02:49.810> bit

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
way when that motor engages and the bit

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.800 
way when that motor engages and the bit
starts<00:02:50.380> to<00:02:50.470> the<00:02:50.590> the<00:02:51.190> wood<00:02:51.340> all<00:02:52.330> heck<00:02:52.630> can

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
starts to the the wood all heck can

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.380 
starts to the the wood all heck can
break<00:02:52.989> loose<00:02:53.230> on<00:02:53.410> him<00:02:53.650> a<00:02:54.280> big<00:02:55.120> thing<00:02:55.300> we

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
break loose on him a big thing we

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.479 
break loose on him a big thing we
mentioned<00:02:55.720> the<00:02:55.810> soft<00:02:56.290> start<00:02:56.650> on<00:02:56.920> this<00:02:57.130> and

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
mentioned the soft start on this and

00:02:57.489 --> 00:02:58.979 
mentioned the soft start on this and
that's<00:02:57.940> one<00:02:58.300> thing<00:02:58.420> I<00:02:58.510> don't<00:02:58.570> even<00:02:58.720> buy<00:02:58.959> a

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
that's one thing I don't even buy a

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:00.390 
that's one thing I don't even buy a
router<00:02:59.260> anymore<00:02:59.560> unless<00:02:59.680> it<00:02:59.860> has<00:02:59.980> the<00:03:00.160> soft

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
router anymore unless it has the soft

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.220 
router anymore unless it has the soft
start<00:03:00.730> on<00:03:00.880> it<00:03:01.060> right<00:03:01.270> so<00:03:01.630> because<00:03:01.930> what<00:03:02.110> I'm

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
start on it right so because what I'm

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:03.479 
start on it right so because what I'm
holding<00:03:02.620> out<00:03:02.680> of<00:03:02.800> those<00:03:02.890> handles<00:03:03.280> if<00:03:03.370> I'm

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
holding out of those handles if I'm

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:04.979 
holding out of those handles if I'm
reaching<00:03:03.850> up<00:03:03.940> I<00:03:04.150> have<00:03:04.360> one<00:03:04.390> hand<00:03:04.780> that's<00:03:04.900> not

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
reaching up I have one hand that's not

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:07.080 
reaching up I have one hand that's not
necessarily<00:03:05.709> holding<00:03:06.070> on<00:03:06.220> very<00:03:06.430> tight<00:03:06.700> right

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
necessarily holding on very tight right

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:08.370 
necessarily holding on very tight right
and<00:03:07.330> I<00:03:07.390> don't<00:03:07.450> have<00:03:07.660> that<00:03:07.690> start<00:03:08.200> a<00:03:08.260> little

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
and I don't have that start a little

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.410 
and I don't have that start a little
good<00:03:08.590> it's<00:03:08.890> gonna<00:03:09.010> go<00:03:09.160> away<00:03:09.250> from<00:03:09.370> me<00:03:09.670> here<00:03:09.850> so

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
good it's gonna go away from me here so

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.510 
good it's gonna go away from me here so
that<00:03:10.660> that's<00:03:10.959> a<00:03:11.080> big<00:03:11.290> thing<00:03:11.470> now<00:03:12.010> the<00:03:12.340> only

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.520 
that that's a big thing now the only

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.070 
that that's a big thing now the only
thing<00:03:12.730> I<00:03:12.820> didn't<00:03:13.209> like<00:03:13.239> about<00:03:13.360> the<00:03:13.750> overall

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
thing I didn't like about the overall

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.770 
thing I didn't like about the overall
design<00:03:14.470> is<00:03:14.709> this<00:03:15.550> adjustment<00:03:16.239> ring<00:03:16.360> in<00:03:16.510> here

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
design is this adjustment ring in here

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.600 
design is this adjustment ring in here
and<00:03:16.959> that's<00:03:17.230> this<00:03:17.470> is<00:03:17.620> the<00:03:17.739> micro<00:03:18.100> adjustment

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
and that's this is the micro adjustment

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:19.289 
and that's this is the micro adjustment
when<00:03:18.700> I<00:03:18.760> guess<00:03:18.910> we<00:03:19.060> do

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
when I guess we do

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:21.810 
when I guess we do
64<00:03:19.989> in<00:03:20.110> increments<00:03:20.530> yeah<00:03:21.100> and<00:03:21.400> the<00:03:21.519> thing<00:03:21.670> is

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
64 in increments yeah and the thing is

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.449 
64 in increments yeah and the thing is
what<00:03:22.510> I<00:03:22.540> don't<00:03:22.900> like<00:03:23.080> about<00:03:23.320> it<00:03:23.380> is<00:03:23.560> even<00:03:24.370> if

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
what I don't like about it is even if

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:26.789 
what I don't like about it is even if
you<00:03:24.549> zero<00:03:24.850> it<00:03:25.000> out<00:03:25.180> you<00:03:25.480> could<00:03:25.630> easily<00:03:25.930> you

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
you zero it out you could easily you

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:27.720 
you zero it out you could easily you
only<00:03:26.920> want<00:03:27.130> to<00:03:27.160> move<00:03:27.250> it<00:03:27.370> maybe<00:03:27.519> like<00:03:27.640> an

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
only want to move it maybe like an

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.670 
only want to move it maybe like an
eighth<00:03:27.880> of<00:03:27.970> an<00:03:28.060> inch<00:03:28.150> or<00:03:28.299> something<00:03:28.690> I<00:03:28.840> just

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
eighth of an inch or something I just

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.580 
eighth of an inch or something I just
don't<00:03:29.980> completely<00:03:30.370> trust<00:03:30.519> it<00:03:31.150> to<00:03:31.510> stay<00:03:32.440> aware

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
don't completely trust it to stay aware

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.650 
don't completely trust it to stay aware
as<00:03:32.680> opposed<00:03:32.920> to<00:03:33.010> it's<00:03:33.160> too<00:03:33.310> easy<00:03:33.340> to<00:03:34.000> kind<00:03:34.570> of

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
as opposed to it's too easy to kind of

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.750 
as opposed to it's too easy to kind of
adjust<00:03:35.650> the<00:03:35.799> wrong<00:03:35.980> way<00:03:36.190> maybe<00:03:36.370> move<00:03:36.549> a<00:03:36.640> little

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
adjust the wrong way maybe move a little

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.160 
adjust the wrong way maybe move a little
bit<00:03:36.910> too<00:03:37.060> far<00:03:37.269> ahead<00:03:37.420> of<00:03:37.570> you<00:03:37.750> or<00:03:37.780> something

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
bit too far ahead of you or something

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.080 
bit too far ahead of you or something
right<00:03:39.160> there<00:03:39.430> though<00:03:39.459> couldn't<00:03:39.970> you<00:03:40.030> just

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
right there though couldn't you just

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.539 
right there though couldn't you just
kind<00:03:40.390> of<00:03:40.450> do<00:03:40.600> it<00:03:40.690> from<00:03:40.810> the<00:03:40.900> side<00:03:41.280> you<00:03:42.280> could

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
kind of do it from the side you could

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:44.009 
kind of do it from the side you could
but<00:03:42.760> as<00:03:42.880> you're<00:03:43.030> actually<00:03:43.299> making<00:03:43.510> it<00:03:43.720> I<00:03:43.870> have

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
but as you're actually making it I have

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:45.449 
but as you're actually making it I have
a<00:03:44.049> tendency<00:03:44.500> to<00:03:44.530> kind<00:03:44.769> of<00:03:44.860> go<00:03:44.950> oh<00:03:45.130> I<00:03:45.160> need<00:03:45.430> to

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
a tendency to kind of go oh I need to

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:46.979 
a tendency to kind of go oh I need to
come<00:03:45.760> back<00:03:45.910> here<00:03:46.150> and<00:03:46.239> readjust<00:03:46.690> that<00:03:46.780> or

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
come back here and readjust that or

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:49.229 
come back here and readjust that or
something<00:03:47.170> if<00:03:47.410> it<00:03:47.560> if<00:03:47.890> it<00:03:48.130> locked<00:03:48.459> to<00:03:48.880> the<00:03:49.000> main

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
something if it if it locked to the main

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:52.110 
something if it if it locked to the main
adjustment<00:03:49.840> ring<00:03:49.989> somehow<00:03:50.290> then<00:03:51.280> I<00:03:51.610> could<00:03:51.790> to

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
adjustment ring somehow then I could to

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.250 
adjustment ring somehow then I could to
me<00:03:52.269> that<00:03:52.450> would<00:03:52.570> be<00:03:52.600> a<00:03:52.660> little<00:03:52.750> bit<00:03:52.930> better<00:03:53.019> but

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
me that would be a little bit better but

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.140 
me that would be a little bit better but
the<00:03:53.350> fact<00:03:53.560> that<00:03:53.620> it's<00:03:53.830> completely<00:03:54.150> free

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
the fact that it's completely free

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.699 
the fact that it's completely free
moving<00:03:55.540> it's<00:03:55.720> just<00:03:55.900> it's<00:03:56.110> too<00:03:56.260> easy<00:03:56.290> for

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:56.709 
moving it's just it's too easy for

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:57.960 
moving it's just it's too easy for
somebody<00:03:56.890> like<00:03:57.070> me<00:03:57.250> to<00:03:57.310> mess<00:03:57.519> up<00:03:57.700> or<00:03:57.910> if

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
somebody like me to mess up or if

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:59.520 
somebody like me to mess up or if
instead<00:03:58.480> of<00:03:58.570> free<00:03:58.810> spinning<00:03:59.140> if<00:03:59.290> it<00:03:59.380> had<00:03:59.500> just

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
instead of free spinning if it had just

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.680 
instead of free spinning if it had just
some<00:03:59.830> clicks<00:04:00.160> like<00:04:00.549> detents<00:04:01.090> there<00:04:01.360> you<00:04:01.510> go

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
some clicks like detents there you go

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:03.180 
some clicks like detents there you go
yeah<00:04:01.959> that<00:04:01.989> would<00:04:02.320> be<00:04:02.440> even<00:04:02.560> better<00:04:02.830> I<00:04:02.920> like

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
yeah that would be even better I like

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.729 
yeah that would be even better I like
that<00:04:03.400> idea<00:04:03.549> okay<00:04:04.480> so<00:04:04.810> now<00:04:05.110> another<00:04:05.380> thing<00:04:05.500> with

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
that idea okay so now another thing with

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:07.620 
that idea okay so now another thing with
the<00:04:05.830> design<00:04:06.100> that<00:04:06.280> I<00:04:06.310> do<00:04:06.430> like<00:04:06.910> is<00:04:07.180> where<00:04:07.480> the

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:07.630 
the design that I do like is where the

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:11.100 
the design that I do like is where the
the<00:04:08.340> cord<00:04:09.340> isn't<00:04:09.610> attached<00:04:09.910> and<00:04:10.299> one<00:04:10.840> thing<00:04:10.989> is

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:11.110 
the cord isn't attached and one thing is

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:12.539 
the cord isn't attached and one thing is
I've<00:04:11.290> left-handed<00:04:11.829> my<00:04:11.950> neighbor<00:04:12.190> might<00:04:12.430> be

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:12.549 
I've left-handed my neighbor might be

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:14.819 
I've left-handed my neighbor might be
right-handed<00:04:12.880> well<00:04:13.660> we<00:04:13.810> can<00:04:13.959> easily<00:04:14.260> swap<00:04:14.620> it

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:14.829 
right-handed well we can easily swap it

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:17.610 
right-handed well we can easily swap it
in<00:04:14.980> push<00:04:15.790> it<00:04:15.940> back<00:04:16.060> down<00:04:16.090> and<00:04:16.750> then<00:04:16.810> now<00:04:17.560> the

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
in push it back down and then now the

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.340 
in push it back down and then now the
cord<00:04:18.160> is<00:04:18.310> located<00:04:18.729> in<00:04:18.820> another<00:04:18.989> area<00:04:19.989> for

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
cord is located in another area for

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:21.570 
cord is located in another area for
somebody<00:04:20.590> else<00:04:20.769> to<00:04:20.859> use<00:04:21.040> just<00:04:21.280> that<00:04:21.430> much

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:21.580 
somebody else to use just that much

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:23.700 
somebody else to use just that much
easier<00:04:21.940> okay<00:04:22.450> flip<00:04:23.020> it<00:04:23.169> over<00:04:23.260> and<00:04:23.380> let's<00:04:23.590> talk

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
easier okay flip it over and let's talk

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.770 
easier okay flip it over and let's talk
about<00:04:23.860> change<00:04:24.190> in<00:04:24.340> the<00:04:24.430> bits<00:04:24.610> okay<00:04:25.120> well<00:04:25.599> it

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
about change in the bits okay well it

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:26.940 
about change in the bits okay well it
comes<00:04:25.990> with<00:04:26.200> a<00:04:26.380> half

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:26.950 
comes with a half

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:29.130 
comes with a half
in<00:04:27.190> a<00:04:27.400> quarter<00:04:27.790> inch<00:04:27.970> collet<00:04:28.240> very<00:04:28.690> easy<00:04:28.930> to

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:29.140 
in a quarter inch collet very easy to

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.250 
in a quarter inch collet very easy to
swap<00:04:29.380> those<00:04:29.560> out<00:04:29.740> yeah<00:04:30.070> the<00:04:30.520> the<00:04:30.990> the<00:04:31.990> the

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.260 
swap those out yeah the the the the

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.620 
swap those out yeah the the the the
wrench<00:04:32.470> to<00:04:32.800> lock<00:04:33.520> it<00:04:33.670> the<00:04:33.700> the<00:04:34.090> bit<00:04:34.270> into<00:04:34.450> place

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630 
wrench to lock it the the bit into place

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:38.280 
wrench to lock it the the bit into place
it's<00:04:35.260> just<00:04:35.560> one<00:04:35.710> of<00:04:35.770> those<00:04:35.860> finger<00:04:36.930> the<00:04:37.930> little

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:38.290 
it's just one of those finger the little

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.380 
it's just one of those finger the little
stop<00:04:38.530> here<00:04:38.800> with<00:04:38.920> the<00:04:38.980> one<00:04:39.190> hand<00:04:39.400> use<00:04:40.000> just<00:04:40.210> one

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:40.390 
stop here with the one hand use just one

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:42.450 
stop here with the one hand use just one
wrench<00:04:40.630> you<00:04:40.810> can<00:04:40.840> lock<00:04:41.080> it<00:04:41.260> in<00:04:41.380> works<00:04:42.160> really

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
wrench you can lock it in works really

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:43.800 
wrench you can lock it in works really
well<00:04:42.670> I<00:04:42.940> always<00:04:43.270> kind<00:04:43.450> of<00:04:43.480> struggle<00:04:43.780> with

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
well I always kind of struggle with

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.570 
well I always kind of struggle with
those<00:04:43.990> a<00:04:44.020> little<00:04:44.350> bit<00:04:44.500> so<00:04:44.710> I<00:04:44.950> really<00:04:45.340> shouldn't

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
those a little bit so I really shouldn't

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.010 
those a little bit so I really shouldn't
say<00:04:45.700> too<00:04:45.760> much<00:04:46.000> about<00:04:46.060> it<00:04:46.420> but<00:04:46.540> I<00:04:46.600> never<00:04:46.810> had

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020 
say too much about it but I never had

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.630 
say too much about it but I never had
any<00:04:47.050> problems<00:04:47.620> getting<00:04:47.980> that<00:04:48.190> locked<00:04:48.490> in

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:48.640 
any problems getting that locked in

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
any problems getting that locked in
place<00:04:48.960> another<00:04:49.960> nice<00:04:50.290> thing<00:04:50.320> is<00:04:50.740> they<00:04:51.040> send<00:04:51.370> a

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 
place another nice thing is they send a

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:55.470 
place another nice thing is they send a
centering<00:04:52.660> cone<00:04:52.900> so<00:04:53.620> you<00:04:54.100> get<00:04:54.250> an<00:04:54.370> extra<00:04:54.820> base

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:55.480 
centering cone so you get an extra base

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.450 
centering cone so you get an extra base
with<00:04:55.780> it<00:04:55.900> so<00:04:55.990> this<00:04:56.110> one<00:04:56.260> has<00:04:56.410> a<00:04:56.440> smaller<00:04:56.920> circle

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
with it so this one has a smaller circle

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.940 
with it so this one has a smaller circle
so<00:04:57.670> you<00:04:58.150> know<00:04:58.270> narrower<00:04:58.690> diameter<00:04:58.900> bits<00:04:59.470> you

00:04:59.940 --> 00:04:59.950 
so you know narrower diameter bits you

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:01.980 
so you know narrower diameter bits you
just<00:05:00.160> drop<00:05:00.340> that<00:05:00.370> cone<00:05:00.760> into<00:05:00.970> place<00:05:01.270> actually

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:01.990 
just drop that cone into place actually

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:04.680 
just drop that cone into place actually
first<00:05:02.320> put<00:05:02.530> the<00:05:02.650> UH<00:05:03.180> put<00:05:04.180> the<00:05:04.240> base<00:05:04.390> in<00:05:04.600> place

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:04.690 
first put the UH put the base in place

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:06.450 
first put the UH put the base in place
we<00:05:04.930> loosen<00:05:05.200> the<00:05:05.290> screws<00:05:05.590> you<00:05:05.770> put<00:05:05.950> that<00:05:06.040> in<00:05:06.250> and

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.460 
we loosen the screws you put that in and

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.000 
we loosen the screws you put that in and
it<00:05:06.910> centers<00:05:07.360> itself<00:05:07.450> it's<00:05:08.080> self<00:05:08.380> centering<00:05:08.800> so

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.010 
it centers itself it's self centering so

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:11.430 
it centers itself it's self centering so
it's<00:05:09.190> like<00:05:09.370> it's<00:05:10.090> just<00:05:10.270> how<00:05:10.360> much<00:05:10.510> easier<00:05:10.660> yeah

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:11.440 
it's like it's just how much easier yeah

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.020 
it's like it's just how much easier yeah
cool<00:05:11.920> okay<00:05:12.130> you<00:05:12.340> know<00:05:12.550> I<00:05:12.580> was<00:05:12.700> doing<00:05:12.910> some

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.090 
take on this it's got within the collet

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:18.120 
take on this it's got within the collet
it's<00:05:16.210> got<00:05:16.360> all<00:05:16.480> these<00:05:16.630> little<00:05:16.810> love<00:05:17.140> it's<00:05:17.890> kind

it's got all these little love it's kind
of<00:05:18.160> channels<00:05:18.580> cut<00:05:18.850> in<00:05:18.970> here<00:05:19.150> that's

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 
of channels cut in here that's

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.930 
of channels cut in here that's
supposedly<00:05:19.660> a<00:05:20.170> din<00:05:20.470> bit<00:05:20.650> retention<00:05:21.280> but<00:05:21.790> also

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:21.940 
supposedly a din bit retention but also

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.720 
supposedly a din bit retention but also
preclude<00:05:22.300> bit<00:05:22.930> freezing<00:05:23.680> did<00:05:23.950> you<00:05:24.100> ever<00:05:24.220> have

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:24.730 
preclude bit freezing did you ever have

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:26.250 
preclude bit freezing did you ever have
a<00:05:24.760> bit<00:05:24.970> come<00:05:25.180> loose<00:05:25.390> or<00:05:25.600> do<00:05:25.690> you<00:05:25.750> ever<00:05:25.840> have<00:05:26.050> one

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:26.260 
a bit come loose or do you ever have one

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.440 
a bit come loose or do you ever have one
get<00:05:26.530> stuck<00:05:26.830> no<00:05:27.640> I<00:05:27.670> think<00:05:27.820> I<00:05:28.030> didn't<00:05:28.240> know<00:05:28.300> those

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:28.450 
get stuck no I think I didn't know those

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:30.270 
get stuck no I think I didn't know those
were<00:05:28.630> in<00:05:28.840> there<00:05:29.110> which<00:05:29.590> probably<00:05:29.920> makes<00:05:30.130> more

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280 
were in there which probably makes more

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:31.350 
were in there which probably makes more
sense<00:05:30.520> of<00:05:30.580> them<00:05:30.700> because<00:05:30.880> I<00:05:30.970> never<00:05:31.180> had<00:05:31.330> a

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360 
sense of them because I never had a

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:32.730 
sense of them because I never had a
problem<00:05:31.540> with<00:05:31.900> them<00:05:32.050> coming<00:05:32.230> loose<00:05:32.500> at<00:05:32.650> all

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:32.740 
problem with them coming loose at all

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.440 
problem with them coming loose at all
and<00:05:33.130> for<00:05:33.520> sure<00:05:33.730> that's<00:05:33.970> another<00:05:34.150> thing<00:05:34.330> when

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:34.450 
and for sure that's another thing when

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:35.640 
and for sure that's another thing when
when<00:05:34.780> you're<00:05:34.900> done<00:05:34.960> with<00:05:35.140> it<00:05:35.230> you<00:05:35.260> gotta<00:05:35.470> pull

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:35.650 
when you're done with it you gotta pull

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:36.870 
when you're done with it you gotta pull
it<00:05:35.680> out<00:05:35.830> nothing<00:05:36.070> that's<00:05:36.340> worse<00:05:36.520> than<00:05:36.790> those

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:36.880 
it out nothing that's worse than those

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.580 
it out nothing that's worse than those
sharp<00:05:37.270> blades<00:05:37.540> and<00:05:37.720> struggling<00:05:38.140> to<00:05:38.380> get<00:05:38.500> it

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:38.590 
sharp blades and struggling to get it

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:40.350 
sharp blades and struggling to get it
out<00:05:38.710> right<00:05:39.070> and<00:05:39.370> they<00:05:39.580> came<00:05:39.760> out<00:05:39.880> really

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 
out right and they came out really

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.810 
out right and they came out really
simple<00:05:40.750> so<00:05:41.020> yeah<00:05:41.350> nice<00:05:41.740> okay<00:05:42.400> let's<00:05:42.700> talk
