00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.710
 video tutorial in which we are going to 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.900
 learn how to restore our 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.750
 computer with windows operating system 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.269
 8 has been good factory this is a 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.249
 new feature in windows 8 we 

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:23.609
 allows to restore our computer 

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:26.309
 As if it were new to the factory state 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.649
 original good we will not install 

00:00:26.309 --> 00:00:31.619
 no program is totally free of 

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:33.449
 programs there is no risk in this we are going to 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.129
 delete all files all 

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:37.769
 installed programs and we're going to 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:39.570
 reinstall windows 8 in this is a 

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:41.399
 very complete tutorial is a 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.129
 new feature so I wanted it 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.710
 take in this good tutorial video we're going 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.179
 to start we're going to need a disk of 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.270
 installation of windows 8 

00:00:48.179 --> 00:00:53.940
 this serves as 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.880
 windows you need the disk to 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.130
 based on that copy to be able to 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.930
 reinstall windows 8 and in this way 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:04.260
 reset our computer to state 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:07.560
 factory this function is similar to 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.810
 format and install windows 8 but not 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.960
 it's the same thing this function is more secure 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.570
 it's easier since it's practically 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.180
 automatic the only the only disadvantage 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.369
 is that it is a very long function 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.430
 first time I did it took me 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.590
 around three hours so yes it is 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.600
 very very slow but it is a function that 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.729
 It caught my attention so I did not 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.410
 let's take today as good as 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.660
 I already mentioned we're going to need the disk 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:36.840
 of installing windows 8 so what 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:40.450
 let's introduce in the label 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.759
 ok once the law we give you a click 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.340
 and we select not to make any 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:48.670
 action since not yet not yet 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.289
 let's use this function the only 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.119
 reason is that it has to be the 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:54.850
 disk inside of our computer 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:57.429
 let's press windows + and we're going 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:00.070
 to go to configuration we are going to change 

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:02.290
 pc configuration 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.430
 here we are going to general use that what 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.760
 we have the right side of 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:08.890
 configuration and let's go down towards 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.709
 where we find remove everything and 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:16.080
 reinstall windows let's select 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:16.080
 a click where it says start 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:22.030
 and good here we get a message 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.800
 practically says reset your pc your 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.930
 personal files and applications 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.570
 will remove the configuration of your pc from 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.400
 you will return default values or in 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:33.100
 once we have read this 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:37.060
 we select next we hope that 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:38.950
 windows 8 configure and prepare the 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.590
 necessary files to be able to do 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.810
 this action once we have left 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.330
 this message we are going to injure 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.250
 completely clean the unit since 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.200
 the only way to restore our 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.260
 windows 8 as if it were new to state 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.840
 from factory as we can see here says 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.760
 this will take much longer and if 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.830
 effectively the last time that I 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.290
 I did it took me about 3 hours 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:05.050
 also this will depend depends the 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.540
 speed of your computer but good 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:10.120
 I clarify that it is a delayed process so 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:13.410
 do not worry we select clean and 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:16.110
 complete the unit we give a click 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:18.000
 and well here we are going to see everything ready 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.760
 all we have to do is 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.380
 select reset and in this way 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.730
 will begin to restore our 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.750
 windows 8 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.970
 so we select reset 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.340
 as we see is restarting our 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.730
 computer so let's start with 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:37.690
 this video tutorial officially 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:42.170
 we wait for it to restart 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:45.260
 we do not press anything we leave it like this 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:48.160
 as we see it is already preparing what it is 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.160
 the configuration 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:53.780
 ok well here the process of 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:56.659
 reset our computer here is 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:04:00.260
 where it's going to take a lot of time already 

00:03:56.659 --> 00:04:02.299
 have to reach the 100 percent is a 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.790
 very delayed process so we're going to 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:07.519
 wait let's wait approximately 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:09.170
 3 hours may your gas have 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:12.290
 that if you have a faster computer 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:14.030
 of less afternoons or evenings more good 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.130
 let's wait for this to end 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:19.039
 process I will be passing the video 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:21.139
 and every time I go forward I will go 

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:22.840
 trimming and I'll go recording so that 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:26.509
 see the process of this video tutorial 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:30.580
 so it happened and I come back when I go more 

00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:30.580
 Advance and return with you 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.889

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:48.210
 let's select next 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:53.710
 let's select use the 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:53.710
 quick configuration 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:59.590
 let's select the last option the 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:01.990
 that says to login without an account 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:04.690
 from microsoft and we're going to select 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:08.020
 local account we have it from the side 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:12.490
 here we are going to put a name to our 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:15.910
 computer in this case I will put my 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:17.770
 name we will put a password since 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:20.640
 when you start our computer you will ask us 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:20.640
 the password 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:24.900
 we will repeat what the password is 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:32.040
 and we will put a hint of the password 

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:33.510

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:46.790
 windows 8 configuration we have already 

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:49.970
 reinstalled windows 8 with the 

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:52.790
 configuration to reset windows 8 to 

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:55.900
 factory state a configuration that 

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:58.250
 manolas do not allow windows 8 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:00.890
 well let's start let's wait for 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:02.900

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:08.950
 let's wait for this process 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:13.759
 and well the configuration is finished 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:15.610

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:18.900
 we give enter 

00:06:20.569 --> 00:06:26.479
 and well we already have practically our 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:28.719
 Windows 8 is already refitted 

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:31.550
 We reset to factory state 

00:06:28.719 --> 00:06:33.619
