00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
so the effort of the steering wheel has

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.480 
so the effort of the steering wheel has
to<00:01:05.880> have<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.119> certain<00:01:06.570> level<00:01:07.049> of<00:01:07.260> effort<00:01:07.680> when

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
even at very small angle you have to

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.880 
even at very small angle you have to
feel<00:01:13.710> that<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.610> car<00:01:14.850> is<00:01:15.030> moving<00:01:15.680> and<00:01:16.680> the

feel that the car is moving and the
effort<00:01:17.250> is<00:01:17.430> constant<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.479> this<00:01:18.720> will<00:01:19.110> should

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
effort is constant and this will should

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.999

something in your hand and that's that's

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.860 
something in your hand and that's that's
the<00:02:26.580> most<00:02:26.760> important<00:02:27.300> thing<00:02:27.450> that's<00:02:27.600> what

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
the most important thing that's what

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.199 
the most important thing that's what
that<00:02:28.380> was<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:28.680> concept<00:02:29.220> of<00:02:29.400> adrenaline<00:02:30.000> tire

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
that was the concept of adrenaline tire

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:37.940 
that was the concept of adrenaline tire
I<00:02:33.590> think<00:02:34.590> is<00:02:35.250> also<00:02:35.459> -<00:02:35.880> it's<00:02:36.560> an<00:02:37.560> improvement

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
I think is also - it's an improvement

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.090 
I think is also - it's an improvement
around<00:02:38.880> some<00:02:39.239> area<00:02:39.660> which<00:02:39.930> are<00:02:40.380> easy<00:02:40.739> roseola

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100

I think that our Israel - especially on
dry<00:02:51.630> handling<00:02:52.170> improved<00:02:53.130> the<00:02:53.520> center<00:02:53.970> point

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
dry handling improved the center point

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.090 
dry handling improved the center point
area<00:02:56.190> in<00:02:56.940> terms<00:02:57.270> of<00:02:57.480> response<00:02:57.989> and<00:02:58.320> in<00:02:58.830> terms

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
area in terms of response and in terms

of steering effort the center point

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.510 
of steering effort the center point

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:05.520 
response and the effort on center is one

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.000 
response and the effort on center is one
of<00:03:05.640> the<00:03:05.760> most<00:03:05.970> important<00:03:06.660> thing<00:03:06.870> for<00:03:07.620> a<00:03:07.680> tire

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010
