00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.050 
galaxy s2 that is really the main thing

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.100 
galaxy s2 that is really the main thing
that<00:01:06.050> captures<00:01:06.710> people's<00:01:07.040> views<00:01:07.550> and<00:01:07.760> stuff

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
that captures people's views and stuff

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.960 
that captures people's views and stuff
is<00:01:09.159> that<00:01:10.159> the<00:01:10.310> only<00:01:10.490> thing<00:01:10.670> that's<00:01:10.909> different

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
is that the only thing that's different

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.969 
is that the only thing that's different
is<00:01:11.300> that<00:01:11.360> this<00:01:11.540> was<00:01:11.750> actually<00:01:11.930> faster<00:01:12.290> this

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
is that this was actually faster this

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:16.149 
is that this was actually faster this
runs<00:01:13.550> on<00:01:13.729> 1.5<00:01:14.360> gigahertz<00:01:14.930> i<00:01:15.350> think<00:01:15.590> so<00:01:16.010> it's<00:01:16.130> a

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 
runs on 1.5 gigahertz i think so it's a

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:17.940 
runs on 1.5 gigahertz i think so it's a
little<00:01:16.310> bit<00:01:16.400> faster<00:01:16.610> and<00:01:17.090> the<00:01:17.479> other<00:01:17.630> ones<00:01:17.810> are

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
little bit faster and the other ones are

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.070 
little bit faster and the other ones are
1.2<00:01:18.950> so<00:01:19.220> this<00:01:19.400> is<00:01:19.580> a<00:01:19.610> really<00:01:20.450> it's<00:01:20.750> a<00:01:20.840> killer

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
1.2 so this is a really it's a killer

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.580 
1.2 so this is a really it's a killer
and<00:01:21.350> trying<00:01:21.860> to<00:01:22.870> express<00:01:23.870> speed<00:01:24.170> and<00:01:24.350> stuff

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
and trying to express speed and stuff

on the back of the camp on the back of
the<00:02:15.760> the<00:02:16.760> phone<00:02:16.970> it's<00:02:17.360> a<00:02:18.459> 8.0<00:02:19.459> megapixel<00:02:19.850> so

the the phone it's a 8.0 megapixel so

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.870 
the the phone it's a 8.0 megapixel so
it's<00:02:20.480> a<00:02:20.510> really<00:02:20.780> really<00:02:21.400> so<00:02:22.400> it's<00:02:22.640> a<00:02:22.730> good

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880

phone<00:02:23.090> and<00:02:23.390> and<00:02:23.959> I<00:02:24.050> think<00:02:24.080> there<00:02:24.440> are<00:02:24.470> a<00:02:24.890> lot<00:02:25.190> of

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
phone and and I think there are a lot of

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.710 
phone and and I think there are a lot of
phones<00:02:25.490> out<00:02:25.640> there<00:02:25.670> that<00:02:26.000> have<00:02:26.209> eight<00:02:26.510> point

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
phones out there that have eight point

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.350 
phones out there that have eight point
OS<00:02:26.900> I<00:02:27.140> think<00:02:27.950> one<00:02:28.130> of<00:02:28.160> them<00:02:28.340> are<00:02:28.459> droids<00:02:28.819> which

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
OS I think one of them are droids which

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.720 
OS I think one of them are droids which
are<00:02:29.510> really<00:02:29.750> which<00:02:30.170> are<00:02:30.350> a<00:02:30.380> killer<00:02:30.680> and<00:02:31.280> trying

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
are really which are a killer and trying

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.650 
are really which are a killer and trying
to<00:02:32.319> win<00:02:33.319> when<00:02:33.920> it<00:02:34.220> comes<00:02:34.640> to<00:02:34.880> speed<00:02:35.270> and<00:02:35.420> stuff

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
to win when it comes to speed and stuff

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.280 
to win when it comes to speed and stuff
that<00:02:35.989> that's<00:02:36.290> the<00:02:36.470> phone<00:02:37.930> it's<00:02:38.930> really<00:02:39.170> I
