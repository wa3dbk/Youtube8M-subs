 I was a starter but later they found out 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:08.050
 that he did not start because he had discomfort 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.230
 muscle and still played half an hour what 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.580
 which surely aggravated your situation 

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:15.569
 causing this injury that will take him away 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.939
 two weeks of the courts 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:20.249

 I lead the group d after their draw to 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:39.120
 two so the Malaga continues to surprise 

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:41.280
 came out alive with San Siro when they drew 1 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.500

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.760

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:51.060
 Spanish but Alexander Duck achieves the 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.069
 matched for the milan that 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.349
 fortunately it remains in the 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:57.629
 second place of group c in others 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:03:00.120

 Manchester City drew 2 goals with the 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.819

 Mario Carrillo would not like to coincide 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.860
 again with the Argentine strategist 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.170
 He noted that the capelo never gave 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.270
 explanations of why I did not have 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.580
 activity with the cougars but said that of 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:36.160
 run into him again surely 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.989
 would happen the same and would not play romagnoli 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.569
 He commented that despite not having had 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:42.250
 an opportunity with the team 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:44.590
