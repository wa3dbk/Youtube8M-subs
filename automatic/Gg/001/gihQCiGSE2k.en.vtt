00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
it is pretty easy to find them so import

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:54.400 
it is pretty easy to find them so import
in<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.550> project<00:00:49.460> we<00:00:50.460> will<00:00:50.610> take<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:53.329> image

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.410 
in the project we will take the image

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.290 
in the project we will take the image
camera<00:00:55.410> image<00:00:55.680> and<00:00:56.010> bring<00:00:56.640> it<00:00:56.850> in<00:00:57.120> the

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
camera image and bring it in the

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:08.240 
camera image and bring it in the
timeline<00:01:05.150> okay<00:01:06.150> I<00:01:06.799> don't<00:01:07.799> have<00:01:08.040> the

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
timeline okay I don't have the

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.140 
timeline okay I don't have the
background<00:01:08.670> color<00:01:09.390> because<00:01:10.340> this<00:01:11.340> format<00:01:11.939> is

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
background color because this format is

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.910 
background color because this format is
a<00:01:12.180> PNG<00:01:13.110> format<00:01:13.560> but<00:01:14.400> maybe<00:01:15.210> you<00:01:15.810> can<00:01:16.200> have<00:01:16.530> the

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
a PNG format but maybe you can have the

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.380 
a PNG format but maybe you can have the
or<00:01:17.310> you<00:01:17.700> can<00:01:18.000> find<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.810> JPEG<00:01:19.770> format<00:01:20.280> so<00:01:20.610> you

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
or you can find the JPEG format so you

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.080 
or you can find the JPEG format so you
will<00:01:21.600> have<00:01:21.869> that<00:01:22.200> background<00:01:22.439> color<00:01:22.830> in<00:01:23.790> this

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
will have that background color in this

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.510 
will have that background color in this
case<00:01:24.420> you<00:01:24.840> have<00:01:25.049> two<00:01:25.290> masking<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.070> camera

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
case you have two masking the camera

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.719 
case you have two masking the camera
back<00:01:26.880> there<00:01:26.909> masking<00:01:27.869> tool<00:01:28.170> you<00:01:29.040> will<00:01:29.340> take

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
back there masking tool you will take

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.810 
back there masking tool you will take
their<00:01:30.090> pen<00:01:30.420> tool<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:30.869> start<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:32.159> masking<00:01:32.640> the

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
their pen tool and start to masking the

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.289 
their pen tool and start to masking the
camera<00:01:33.290> okay<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.560> you<00:01:35.310> will<00:01:35.549> delete<00:01:35.909> the

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
camera okay and you will delete the

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
background okay now we have to create

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:47.480 
background okay now we have to create
the<00:01:41.540> reflection<00:01:42.540> effect<00:01:43.820> so<00:01:44.820> a<00:01:45.649> ctrl<00:01:46.649> D<00:01:47.189> to

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
the reflection effect so a ctrl D to

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.980 
the reflection effect so a ctrl D to
duplicate<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.689> image<00:01:48.920> right<00:01:49.920> click<00:01:50.340> on<00:01:50.700> it

the<00:01:58.159> duplicate<00:01:59.159> image<00:01:59.670> like<00:02:00.240> this<00:02:01.310> now<00:02:02.310> we

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
the duplicate image like this now we

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.010 
the duplicate image like this now we
have<00:02:02.700> to<00:02:02.969> do<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.299> same<00:02:03.540> with<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.840> logo<00:02:04.229> I<00:02:06.020> did

like this now we want to create the
reflection<00:02:53.209> effect<00:02:53.540> so<00:02:54.670> click<00:02:55.670> on<00:02:55.940> both<00:02:56.380> of

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
reflection effect so click on both of

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:02.080 
reflection effect so click on both of
the<00:02:58.370> duplicate<00:02:58.970> image<00:02:59.390> press<00:03:00.200> T<00:03:00.650> and<00:03:01.090> bring

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
the duplicate image press T and bring

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.970
