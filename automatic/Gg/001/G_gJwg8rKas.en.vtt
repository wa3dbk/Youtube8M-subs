00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.289 

so<00:01:22.770> it's<00:01:22.890> pretty<00:01:23.040> cool<00:01:23.220> it's<00:01:23.280> got<00:01:23.400> concept<00:01:24.090> art

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.210 
so it's pretty cool it's got concept art
for<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.570> monsters<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:26.960> Kratos<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.439> all<00:01:29.009> that

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
for the monsters and Kratos and all that

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.999 
for the monsters and Kratos and all that
so<00:01:29.549> that's<00:01:29.790> pretty<00:01:29.970> cool<00:01:30.060> I<00:01:30.770> like<00:01:31.770> that<00:01:31.799> a<00:01:31.950> lot

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
so that's pretty cool I like that a lot

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.940 
so that's pretty cool I like that a lot
and<00:01:34.159> got<00:01:35.159> up<00:01:35.420> lift<00:01:36.420> this<00:01:36.570> tab<00:01:36.900> right<00:01:37.140> here<00:01:37.170> and

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
and got up lift this tab right here and

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.050 
and got up lift this tab right here and
I<00:01:38.310> guess<00:01:39.210> this<00:01:39.390> uh<00:01:39.450> this<00:01:40.430> is<00:01:41.430> just<00:01:41.610> a<00:01:41.670> shelf<00:01:41.909> or

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
I guess this uh this is just a shelf or

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.109 
I guess this uh this is just a shelf or
something<00:01:42.119> and<00:01:42.680> that<00:01:43.680> unveils<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.759> game

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
something and that unveils the game

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.410 
something and that unveils the game
itself<00:01:46.520> it<00:01:47.520> just<00:01:47.759> looks<00:01:47.909> like<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.060> standard

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
itself it just looks like the standard

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.990 
itself it just looks like the standard
game<00:01:48.750> it<00:01:48.960> doesn't<00:01:49.430> say<00:01:50.430> anything<00:01:50.790> to

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
game it doesn't say anything to

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.990 
game it doesn't say anything to
differentiate<00:01:51.840> it<00:01:52.110> from<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.500> standard<00:01:53.000> so

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
differentiate it from the standard so

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.800 
differentiate it from the standard so
that's<00:01:54.689> kind<00:01:54.930> of<00:01:54.990> lame<00:01:55.229> and<00:01:56.420> it<00:01:57.420> only<00:01:57.570> comes

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
that's kind of lame and it only comes

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.830 
that's kind of lame and it only comes
with<00:01:57.930> one<00:01:58.170> disk<00:01:58.439> and<00:01:59.450> it<00:02:00.450> comes<00:02:00.630> with<00:02:00.689> this

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
with one disk and it comes with this

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.480 
with one disk and it comes with this
pamphlet<00:02:01.140> right<00:02:01.560> here<00:02:01.829> which<00:02:02.009> has<00:02:02.189> all<00:02:02.399> the

the<00:02:13.470> documentary<00:02:14.370> I<00:02:14.970> guess<00:02:15.900> Sony<00:02:16.620> was<00:02:16.890> too

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
the documentary I guess Sony was too

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.180 
the documentary I guess Sony was too
cheap<00:02:17.520> to<00:02:17.580> put<00:02:18.360> on<00:02:18.630> another<00:02:18.870> disk<00:02:19.170> in<00:02:19.440> so<00:02:19.890> it's

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
cheap to put on another disk in so it's

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.220 
cheap to put on another disk in so it's
just<00:02:20.310> a<00:02:20.460> code<00:02:20.810> that's<00:02:21.810> kind<00:02:22.110> of<00:02:22.170> crappy<00:02:22.440> but

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
just a code that's kind of crappy but

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.270 
just a code that's kind of crappy but
yeah<00:02:25.230> overall<00:02:25.620> this<00:02:25.890> is<00:02:26.040> kind<00:02:26.250> of

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
yeah overall this is kind of

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.160 
yeah overall this is kind of
underwhelming<00:02:26.730> I<00:02:27.060> for<00:02:27.390> a<00:02:27.420> hundred<00:02:27.750> dollars

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
underwhelming I for a hundred dollars

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.450 
underwhelming I for a hundred dollars
this<00:02:28.350> doesn't<00:02:28.680> seem<00:02:28.860> like<00:02:29.040> it<00:02:29.160> was<00:02:29.250> money

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
this doesn't seem like it was money

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.520 
this doesn't seem like it was money
