00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
the floor obviously at some point you

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.100

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
had to have lineups out there I'm sure

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.880

just<00:01:40.259> a<00:01:40.590> numbers<00:01:40.950> standpoint

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
just a numbers standpoint

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:43.890 
just a numbers standpoint
out<00:01:42.010> of<00:01:42.100> an<00:01:42.190> ideal<00:01:42.520> but<00:01:43.390> it<00:01:43.479> seemed<00:01:43.720> like

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:43.900 
out of an ideal but it seemed like

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.330 
out of an ideal but it seemed like
they'd<00:01:44.050> a<00:01:44.140> little<00:01:44.409> jumpy<00:01:44.740> in<00:01:44.830> time<00:01:45.010> maybe<00:01:45.190> a

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
they'd a little jumpy in time maybe a

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.850 
they'd a little jumpy in time maybe a
couple<00:01:45.550> bad<00:01:45.790> shots<00:01:46.120> yeah<00:01:46.420> they<00:01:46.960> kind<00:01:47.530> of<00:01:47.620> cut

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
couple bad shots yeah they kind of cut

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.950 
couple bad shots yeah they kind of cut
your<00:01:48.070> your<00:01:48.520> halftime<00:01:48.880> lead<00:01:49.060> a<00:01:49.120> pretty<00:01:49.630> quick

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
your your halftime lead a pretty quick

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.750 
your your halftime lead a pretty quick
yes<00:01:50.320> was<00:01:50.770> that<00:01:50.890> sort<00:01:51.130> of<00:01:51.190> the<00:01:51.280> stretch<00:01:51.550> that

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:51.760 
yes was that sort of the stretch that

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.850 
yes was that sort of the stretch that
got<00:01:51.909> this<00:01:52.390> game<00:01:52.630> to<00:01:52.750> where<00:01:52.900> it<00:01:52.960> ended<00:01:53.110> up<00:01:53.229> why<00:01:53.830> I

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
got this game to where it ended up why I

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.410 
got this game to where it ended up why I
thought<00:01:54.250> they<00:01:54.460> you<00:01:54.700> know<00:01:54.729> they<00:01:54.790> are<00:01:54.970> able<00:01:55.119> to

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
thought they you know they are able to

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.870 
thought they you know they are able to
we<00:01:56.140> got<00:01:56.260> up<00:01:56.380> i<00:01:56.440> think<00:01:56.470> 19<00:01:57.040> in<00:01:57.130> the<00:01:57.190> first<00:01:57.400> half<00:01:57.580> i

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
we got up i think 19 in the first half i

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.969 
we got up i think 19 in the first half i
think<00:01:58.119> though<00:01:58.300> and<00:01:59.229> that<00:01:59.259> second<00:01:59.800> half<00:01:59.950> you

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
think though and that second half you

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:03.660 
think though and that second half you
know<00:02:00.100> where<00:02:00.340> we<00:02:00.490> started<00:02:00.880> we're<00:02:01.060> up<00:02:01.150> 13<00:02:02.670> you

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
know where we started we're up 13 you

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.109 
know where we started we're up 13 you
know<00:02:03.990> they<00:02:04.990> were<00:02:05.050> able<00:02:05.350> to<00:02:05.560> make<00:02:05.710> a<00:02:05.740> run<00:02:06.119> score

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
know they were able to make a run score

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:08.550 
know they were able to make a run score
some<00:02:07.300> baskets<00:02:07.750> in<00:02:07.840> that<00:02:07.990> stretch<00:02:08.259> we<00:02:08.440> have<00:02:08.530> a

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
some baskets in that stretch we have a

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.820 
some baskets in that stretch we have a
turnover<00:02:08.830> that<00:02:09.190> was<00:02:10.020> with<00:02:11.020> a<00:02:11.050> bad<00:02:11.319> couple<00:02:11.560> bad

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
turnover that was with a bad couple bad

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.830 
turnover that was with a bad couple bad
shots<00:02:12.160> at<00:02:12.370> that<00:02:12.520> time<00:02:12.790> and<00:02:13.180> then<00:02:13.569> they<00:02:13.720> were

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
shots at that time and then they were

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.810 
shots at that time and then they were
able<00:02:13.959> to<00:02:14.200> convert<00:02:14.770> it<00:02:14.890> the<00:02:15.010> other<00:02:15.160> ends<00:02:15.520> and<00:02:15.670> so

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
able to convert it the other ends and so

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.850 
able to convert it the other ends and so
we<00:02:16.300> just<00:02:16.420> got<00:02:16.570> to<00:02:16.630> continue<00:02:16.840> to<00:02:17.080> work<00:02:17.320> and<00:02:17.530> get

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
we just got to continue to work and get

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.920 
we just got to continue to work and get
better<00:02:18.070> and<00:02:18.370> sometimes<00:02:18.790> it's<00:02:19.209> you<00:02:19.810> know<00:02:19.900> it's

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.860 
better and sometimes it's you know it's
time<00:02:20.260> and<00:02:20.440> score<00:02:20.739> sometimes<00:02:21.190> it's<00:02:21.400> just

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
time and score sometimes it's just

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.790 
time and score sometimes it's just
understanding<00:02:22.870> that<00:02:22.930> it's<00:02:23.170> there<00:02:23.320> to<00:02:23.530> attack

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
and not to attack we're just going to

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:28.080 
and not to attack we're just going to
make<00:02:25.269> better<00:02:25.480> decisions<00:02:26.730> Tyrone<00:02:27.730> said<00:02:27.910> you
