00:00:00.759 --> 00:00:03.860
 I think 

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:06.860
 just in Europe and America 

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:11.179
 there is 

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:17.259
 about 

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:20.259
 true 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.380
 simpler 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.339
 nothing else six schools already 

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:32.140
 east media 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.230
 earlier 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.920
 where 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.310
 about an hour 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:39.830
 nobody survived 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:42.440
 fragments no less time 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.900
 Shipulin took 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.150
 to do this 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.150
 monte cristo 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.430
 so big 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.290
 wide dialogue 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.570
 it is clear that the total percentage 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.570
 what we have what we have 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.170
 understand what else 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.170
 to which nonsense is allowed 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.710
 person 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.750
 but this is not an end in itself 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.550
 this is not true 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.410
 traffic on the street 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:33.930
 I am young 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.220
 nice 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:37.700
 what is the reason 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.670
 while I mentioned colleagues 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.670
 opening up 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.960
 I would even say 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.700
 although 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.450
 order 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.450
 who turned out to rest 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.250
 it's me 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.310
 well maybe 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.080
 about last year he 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.269
 which subjects 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:14.349
 young people 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:17.349
 May 4th 

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:21.839
 so we are not reflected 

00:02:23.179 --> 00:02:24.260
 not we 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.169
 300 thousand 

00:02:26.169 --> 00:02:29.169
 how the reports tie I turn on the screen 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:32.700
 up to this point and rf
