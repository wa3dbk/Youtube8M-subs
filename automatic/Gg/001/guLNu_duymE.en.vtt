of tone they're going to take this year
we're<00:01:34.650> coming<00:01:34.890> off<00:01:35.070> of<00:01:35.100> you<00:01:35.759> know<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.299> whole

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
we're coming off of you know the whole

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.179 
we're coming off of you know the whole
tragedy<00:01:36.869> in<00:01:37.020> Boston<00:01:37.500> so<00:01:37.710> what<00:01:37.890> can<00:01:37.979> we<00:01:38.040> expect

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
tragedy in Boston so what can we expect

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.859 
tragedy in Boston so what can we expect
as<00:01:38.729> far<00:01:38.790> as<00:01:39.030> that<00:01:39.119> goes<00:01:39.180> you<00:01:39.420> think<00:01:39.570> well<00:01:39.840> I

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
as far as that goes you think well I

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.359 
as far as that goes you think well I
think<00:01:40.020> we<00:01:40.259> should<00:01:40.290> expect<00:01:40.710> it<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:40.950> be<00:01:41.040> a<00:01:41.070> little

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
think we should expect it to be a little

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.700 
think we should expect it to be a little
bit<00:01:41.579> more<00:01:41.820> subdued<00:01:42.210> but<00:01:42.869> it<00:01:43.079> is<00:01:43.229> interesting

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
bit more subdued but it is interesting

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.770 
bit more subdued but it is interesting
