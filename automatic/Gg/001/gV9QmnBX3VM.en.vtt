mother<00:00:30.679> it's<00:00:31.189> a<00:00:31.339> scoby<00:00:32.410> which<00:00:33.410> is<00:00:33.590> a<00:00:33.620> Simba

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:34.220 
mother it's a scoby which is a Simba

grains and the bacteria on this mother

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.549 
grains and the bacteria on this mother
will<00:00:41.329> be<00:00:41.450> used<00:00:42.340> we'll<00:00:43.390> use<00:00:44.390> the<00:00:44.420> sugar<00:00:44.989> to

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:45.559 
will be used we'll use the sugar to

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:50.319 
will be used we'll use the sugar to
ferment<00:00:45.920> and<00:00:46.160> create<00:00:46.690> kombucha<00:00:49.210> will<00:00:50.210> be

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:50.329 
ferment and create kombucha will be

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:52.510 
ferment and create kombucha will be
using<00:00:50.480> organic<00:00:51.140> green<00:00:51.500> tea<00:00:51.559> the<00:00:51.829> reason<00:00:52.100> why<00:00:52.190> I

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:52.520 
using organic green tea the reason why I

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.369 
using organic green tea the reason why I
like<00:00:52.760> these<00:00:52.910> are<00:00:53.120> green<00:00:53.750> tea<00:00:53.960> is<00:00:53.989> because

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 
like these are green tea is because

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:58.090 
like these are green tea is because
green<00:00:54.620> tea<00:00:54.859> is<00:00:54.890> a<00:00:55.789> heavily<00:00:56.480> sprayed<00:00:56.899> crop<00:00:57.530> and

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
green tea is a heavily sprayed crop and

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.660 
green tea is a heavily sprayed crop and
it's<00:00:59.059> just<00:00:59.300> better<00:00:59.899> to<00:01:00.050> get<00:01:00.340> organic<00:01:01.340> for<00:01:01.579> the

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
it's just better to get organic for the

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.549 
it's just better to get organic for the
most<00:01:01.850> part<00:01:02.000> to<00:01:02.179> avoid<00:01:02.420> pesticides<00:01:03.050> which<00:01:03.350> can

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
most part to avoid pesticides which can

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:06.550 
most part to avoid pesticides which can
lead<00:01:03.679> to<00:01:03.739> cancers<00:01:04.250> and<00:01:04.430> other<00:01:04.519> things<00:01:05.560> it's

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
lead to cancers and other things it's

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.219 
lead to cancers and other things it's
also<00:01:06.770> good<00:01:07.119> today<00:01:08.119> we're<00:01:08.299> using<00:01:08.330> tea<00:01:08.750> bags<00:01:08.990> but

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
also good today we're using tea bags but

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:11.649 
also good today we're using tea bags but
I<00:01:09.259> also<00:01:09.439> use<00:01:09.979> loose<00:01:10.490> grantee<00:01:11.060> for<00:01:11.390> the<00:01:11.450> most

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:11.659 
I also use loose grantee for the most

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:14.140 
I also use loose grantee for the most
most<00:01:12.020> of<00:01:12.140> the<00:01:12.200> time<00:01:12.520> will<00:01:13.520> be<00:01:13.610> using<00:01:13.790> white

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
most of the time will be using white

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.420 
most of the time will be using white
sugar<00:01:14.770> white<00:01:15.770> sugar<00:01:15.799> is<00:01:16.130> usually<00:01:16.930> the

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:18.430 
sugar white sugar is usually the

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.069 
sugar white sugar is usually the
ultimate<00:01:19.430> poison<00:01:19.909> but<00:01:20.150> today<00:01:20.509> we're<00:01:20.689> using<00:01:20.869> it

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:21.079 
ultimate poison but today we're using it

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:23.890 
ultimate poison but today we're using it
because<00:01:21.170> the<00:01:21.500> scoby<00:01:21.909> can<00:01:22.909> easily<00:01:23.420> feed<00:01:23.689> off

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:23.900 
because the scoby can easily feed off

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.050 
because the scoby can easily feed off
the<00:01:24.079> white<00:01:24.259> sugar<00:01:24.680> and<00:01:24.920> produces<00:01:25.759> glucuronic

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
the white sugar and produces glucuronic

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.929 
the white sugar and produces glucuronic
acid<00:01:26.259> which<00:01:27.259> your<00:01:27.500> liver<00:01:27.770> can<00:01:28.490> then<00:01:28.640> use<00:01:28.909> to

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:28.939 
acid which your liver can then use to

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:32.260 
acid which your liver can then use to
detox<00:01:29.780> from<00:01:30.140> xenoestrogens<00:01:31.130> and<00:01:32.119> other

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
detox from xenoestrogens and other

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.469 
detox from xenoestrogens and other
environmental<00:01:34.030> contaminants<00:01:35.030> in<00:01:35.119> your<00:01:35.240> body

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
environmental contaminants in your body

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:39.100 
environmental contaminants in your body
and<00:01:35.829> then<00:01:36.829> the<00:01:37.700> boiling<00:01:38.240> water<00:01:38.270> i<00:01:38.659> like<00:01:38.960> to

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
and then the boiling water i like to

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.859 
and then the boiling water i like to
boil<00:01:39.350> first<00:01:39.770> off<00:01:40.070> because<00:01:40.490> some<00:01:41.270> places<00:01:41.479> put

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
boil first off because some places put

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:44.260 
boil first off because some places put
fluoride<00:01:42.110> and<00:01:42.740> other<00:01:43.399> things<00:01:43.939> into<00:01:44.240> their

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
fluoride and other things into their

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.030 
fluoride and other things into their
water<00:01:45.520> so<00:01:46.520> we'll<00:01:46.700> use<00:01:46.729> the<00:01:47.560> today<00:01:48.560> we're<00:01:48.770> in<00:01:48.920> an

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
water so we'll use the today we're in an

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.609 
water so we'll use the today we're in an
area<00:01:49.219> that<00:01:49.670> is<00:01:49.820> a<00:01:50.420> fairly<00:01:50.899> developed<00:01:51.380> area

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
area that is a fairly developed area

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:53.050 
area that is a fairly developed area
where<00:01:51.740> they<00:01:51.829> probably<00:01:52.070> do<00:01:52.280> put<00:01:52.520> fluoride<00:01:52.729> in

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
where they probably do put fluoride in

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.640 
where they probably do put fluoride in
the<00:01:53.090> water

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:53.650 
the water

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:55.980 
the water
so<00:01:53.770> hopefully<00:01:54.460> this<00:01:54.820> boiling<00:01:55.480> can<00:01:55.720> get<00:01:55.840> the

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
so hopefully this boiling can get the

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.620 
so hopefully this boiling can get the
fluoride<00:01:56.290> out<00:01:56.410> of<00:01:56.620> the<00:01:56.680> water<00:01:56.890> before<00:01:57.300> we<00:01:58.300> get

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
fluoride out of the water before we get

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.110 
fluoride out of the water before we get
everything<00:01:58.900> going<00:01:59.520> okay<00:02:00.520> so<00:02:00.580> now<00:02:00.880> we're<00:02:01.030> going

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:01.120 
everything going okay so now we're going

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.480 
everything going okay so now we're going
to<00:02:01.180> mix<00:02:01.480> the<00:02:02.380> tea<00:02:02.620> and<00:02:02.890> the<00:02:02.950> sugar<00:02:03.160> together

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
to mix the tea and the sugar together

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.639 
to mix the tea and the sugar together
into<00:02:04.120> the<00:02:04.150> hot<00:02:04.540> water<00:02:06.660> so<00:02:07.660> usually<00:02:08.170> a<00:02:08.229> good

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
into the hot water so usually a good

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.290 
into the hot water so usually a good
rule<00:02:08.860> of<00:02:08.890> thumb<00:02:09.040> is<00:02:09.340> to<00:02:09.369> make<00:02:09.700> weak<00:02:10.060> to

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
rule of thumb is to make weak to

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.420 
rule of thumb is to make weak to
moderately<00:02:10.720> strong<00:02:11.140> grantee<00:02:12.510> which<00:02:13.510> is<00:02:13.750> about

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
moderately strong grantee which is about

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.600 
moderately strong grantee which is about
8<00:02:15.430> teaspoons<00:02:15.940> of<00:02:16.510> green<00:02:16.750> tea<00:02:17.080> to<00:02:17.890> one<00:02:18.070> gallon

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
8 teaspoons of green tea to one gallon

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.060 
8 teaspoons of green tea to one gallon
of<00:02:18.700> water<00:02:18.940> and<00:02:19.330> then<00:02:19.630> 1<00:02:19.930> cup<00:02:19.960> of<00:02:20.260> sugar<00:02:20.680> so

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
of water and then 1 cup of sugar so

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:22.920 
of water and then 1 cup of sugar so
we're<00:02:21.700> going<00:02:21.790> to<00:02:21.880> put<00:02:22.000> our<00:02:22.060> tea<00:02:22.300> bags<00:02:22.570> in<00:02:22.750> which

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
we're going to put our tea bags in which

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.690 
we're going to put our tea bags in which
is<00:02:23.050> about<00:02:23.230> a<00:02:23.290> teaspoon<00:02:23.500> each<00:02:23.920> so<00:02:24.250> we<00:02:24.310> have<00:02:24.430> a<00:02:24.640> to

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
is about a teaspoon each so we have a to

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.030 
is about a teaspoon each so we have a to
them<00:02:24.970> and<00:02:25.720> set<00:02:25.959> them<00:02:25.990> in<00:02:26.170> their<00:02:26.410> steep<00:02:26.770> we're

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040
