you know 2012 like we we hustle the line

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.170 
you know 2012 like we we hustle the line
really<00:02:29.959> really<00:02:30.200> hard<00:02:30.410> 2010<00:02:31.070> and<00:02:31.280> it's<00:02:31.850> kind<00:02:32.090> of

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
really really hard 2010 and it's kind of

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.090 
really really hard 2010 and it's kind of
it's<00:02:32.330> not<00:02:32.390> frowned<00:02:32.870> upon<00:02:33.050> but<00:02:33.500> it's<00:02:33.650> just<00:02:33.860> not

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
it's not frowned upon but it's just not

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
it's not frowned upon but it's just not
like<00:02:34.340> a<00:02:35.110> running<00:02:36.110> low<00:02:36.200> line<00:02:36.380> isn't<00:02:36.620> exactly

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
like a running low line isn't exactly

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.140 
like a running low line isn't exactly
I<00:02:38.150> guess<00:02:38.810> it<00:02:38.930> is<00:02:39.430> it's<00:02:40.430> gotten<00:02:40.670> to<00:02:40.790> spend<00:02:41.030> this

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150
