00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.200 

so<00:00:00.840> I<00:00:00.870> basically<00:00:01.380> just<00:00:01.800> come<00:00:02.280> up<00:00:02.429> with<00:00:02.610> solid

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
so I basically just come up with solid

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.559 
so I basically just come up with solid
proof<00:00:03.720> that<00:00:04.290> the<00:00:05.040> Sun<00:00:05.339> revolves<00:00:05.879> on<00:00:05.970> the<00:00:06.210> earth

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
proof that the Sun revolves on the earth

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.009 
proof that the Sun revolves on the earth
so<00:00:06.950> now<00:00:07.950> the<00:00:08.010> bible<00:00:08.639> does<00:00:08.880> say<00:00:09.179> that<00:00:09.630> the<00:00:09.840> earth

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
so now the bible does say that the earth

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.900 
so now the bible does say that the earth
is<00:00:10.290> the<00:00:10.320> center<00:00:10.440> of<00:00:10.889> the<00:00:11.130> universe<00:00:11.370> but

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
is the center of the universe but

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.450 
is the center of the universe but
there's<00:00:12.240> that<00:00:12.809> you<00:00:13.110> know<00:00:13.259> so<00:00:13.769> if<00:00:13.920> you<00:00:14.040> think<00:00:14.280> of

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
there's that you know so if you think of

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.939 
there's that you know so if you think of
the<00:00:14.700> universe<00:00:14.910> like<00:00:15.120> a<00:00:15.210> circle<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:16.199> radius<00:00:16.350> is

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
the universe like a circle the radius is

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.650 
the universe like a circle the radius is
all<00:00:17.130> around<00:00:17.539> the<00:00:18.539> earth<00:00:18.859> so<00:00:19.859> I<00:00:20.130> I<00:00:20.880> don't<00:00:21.119> I

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
all around the earth so I I don't I

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.500 
all around the earth so I I don't I
don't<00:00:21.720> really<00:00:22.020> believe<00:00:22.260> anything<00:00:22.920> I<00:00:23.910> I<00:00:24.180> don't

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
don't really believe anything I I don't

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.080 
don't really believe anything I I don't
I<00:00:24.660> don't<00:00:24.990> have<00:00:25.170> faith<00:00:25.590> in<00:00:25.980> things<00:00:26.550> so<00:00:26.820> I<00:00:26.880> just

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
I don't have faith in things so I just

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.269 
I don't have faith in things so I just
kind<00:00:27.359> of<00:00:27.539> think<00:00:28.289> you<00:00:28.410> know<00:00:28.500> there's<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:29.039> Sun

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
kind of think you know there's the Sun

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.939 
kind of think you know there's the Sun
there's<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.670> moon<00:00:29.849> there's<00:00:30.150> ears

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:30.949 
there's the moon there's ears

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:34.130 
there's the moon there's ears
maybe<00:00:31.949> Mars<00:00:32.309> and<00:00:33.210> then<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.570> rest<00:00:33.750> is<00:00:33.899> really

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
maybe Mars and then the rest is really

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.560 
maybe Mars and then the rest is really
just<00:00:34.649> dots<00:00:34.890> in<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.219> sky<00:00:35.460> that<00:00:35.760> I<00:00:35.969> like<00:00:36.450> to

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
just dots in the sky that I like to

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.110 
just dots in the sky that I like to
think<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:37.469> act<00:00:37.680> of<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.190> star<00:00:38.430> what<00:00:38.670> you<00:00:38.910> call

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
think the act of the star what you call

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.410 
think the act of the star what you call
stars<00:00:39.570> as<00:00:40.100> basically<00:00:41.100> being<00:00:41.399> you<00:00:41.969> know<00:00:42.090> dots

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
stars as basically being you know dots

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.119 
stars as basically being you know dots
and<00:00:42.660> sky<00:00:42.870> kind<00:00:43.079> of<00:00:43.200> breaking<00:00:43.559> into<00:00:43.739> heaven

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
and sky kind of breaking into heaven

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.100 
and sky kind of breaking into heaven
kind<00:00:44.489> of<00:00:44.550> proving<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.629> heavens<00:00:46.079> real<00:00:46.760> know

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110 
kind of proving the heavens real know

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.869 
kind of proving the heavens real know
the<00:00:49.110> Sun<00:00:49.559> if<00:00:49.770> you<00:00:49.800> look<00:00:50.039> at<00:00:50.190> it<00:00:50.280> in<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.489> sky

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
the Sun if you look at it in the sky

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.799 
the Sun if you look at it in the sky
it's<00:00:51.300> actually<00:00:51.809> tiny<00:00:52.530> I<00:00:53.190> mean<00:00:54.059> it's<00:00:54.360> it's<00:00:54.660> just

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
it's actually tiny I mean it's it's just

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.650 
it's actually tiny I mean it's it's just
like<00:00:55.020> a<00:00:55.050> few<00:00:55.469> miles<00:00:55.739> around<00:00:56.070> I<00:00:56.699> mean<00:00:57.329> it<00:00:57.539> would

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
like a few miles around I mean it would

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.260 
like a few miles around I mean it would
be<00:00:57.690> so<00:00:57.989> simple<00:00:58.649> to<00:00:58.739> go<00:00:58.829> around<00:00:59.039> it<00:00:59.190> so<00:00:59.370> I<00:00:59.579> have

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
be so simple to go around it so I have

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.310 
be so simple to go around it so I have
no<00:01:00.480> idea<00:01:00.840> why<00:01:01.620> you<00:01:02.300> atheists<00:01:03.300> would<00:01:03.930> even

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
no idea why you atheists would even

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.080 
no idea why you atheists would even
think<00:01:04.559> that<00:01:04.710> we<00:01:05.070> revolve<00:01:05.549> around<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:06.060> Sun

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
think that we revolve around the Sun

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.020 
think that we revolve around the Sun
because<00:01:06.510> let's<00:01:07.260> pretend<00:01:07.799> magnets<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.700> exist

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
because let's pretend magnets to exist

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.250 
because let's pretend magnets to exist
for<00:01:09.180> now<00:01:09.299> let's<00:01:09.479> pretend<00:01:09.630> you're<00:01:09.840> right<00:01:10.080> about

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
for now let's pretend you're right about

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.730 
for now let's pretend you're right about
the<00:01:10.500> magnet<00:01:10.920> thing<00:01:11.100> okay<00:01:11.450> but<00:01:12.740> what's

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
the magnet thing okay but what's

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:14.780 
the magnet thing okay but what's
pretending<00:01:14.159> you're<00:01:14.280> not<00:01:14.340> right<00:01:14.700> about

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
pretending you're not right about

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.429 
pretending you're not right about
everything<00:01:15.240> else<00:01:15.360> so<00:01:15.570> because<00:01:15.869> you're<00:01:16.020> not<00:01:16.110> I

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
everything else so because you're not I

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:17.810 
everything else so because you're not I
mean<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:16.979> probably<00:01:17.220> not<00:01:17.430> right<00:01:17.580> about<00:01:17.759> the

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
mean you probably not right about the

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.179 
mean you probably not right about the
magnet<00:01:18.119> thing<00:01:18.240> but<00:01:18.780> with<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.560> Sun<00:01:19.770> being<00:01:20.009> so

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
magnet thing but with the Sun being so

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.969 
magnet thing but with the Sun being so
small<00:01:20.580> why<00:01:21.180> would<00:01:21.509> we<00:01:21.780> Revolver<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.590> Sun<00:01:22.799> and

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
small why would we Revolver the Sun and

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.560 
small why would we Revolver the Sun and
be<00:01:23.070> caught<00:01:23.280> in<00:01:23.400> our<00:01:23.600> magnetic<00:01:24.600> pole<00:01:25.400> so<00:01:26.400> I<00:01:26.790> mean

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
be caught in our magnetic pole so I mean

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.039 
be caught in our magnetic pole so I mean
I<00:01:28.369> think<00:01:29.369> that<00:01:29.700> kind<00:01:29.909> of<00:01:29.939> debunks<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.540> idea

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
I think that kind of debunks the idea

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.600 
I think that kind of debunks the idea
that<00:01:31.920> we<00:01:32.070> revolve<00:01:32.490> around<00:01:32.610> Sun<00:01:33.290> if<00:01:34.290> you<00:01:34.350> so<00:01:35.040> you

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
that we revolve around Sun if you so you

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.069 
that we revolve around Sun if you so you
might<00:01:35.790> want<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.060> kind<00:01:36.299> of<00:01:36.420> reconsider<00:01:36.900> the

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
might want to kind of reconsider the

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.440 
might want to kind of reconsider the
viable<00:01:37.619> because<00:01:37.860> you<00:01:38.100> know<00:01:38.220> you<00:01:38.280> will<00:01:38.549> suffer

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
viable because you know you will suffer

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.399 
viable because you know you will suffer
in<00:01:39.570> hell<00:01:40.040> for<00:01:41.119> going<00:01:42.119> against<00:01:42.540> God's<00:01:42.780> Word<00:01:43.079> and

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
in hell for going against God's Word and

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.639 
in hell for going against God's Word and
not<00:01:43.860> worshiping<00:01:44.610> him<00:01:44.990> you<00:01:45.990> do<00:01:46.170> want<00:01:46.409> to<00:01:46.470> go<00:01:46.590> to

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
not worshiping him you do want to go to

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.310 
not worshiping him you do want to go to
paradise<00:01:47.070> right<00:01:47.310> I<00:01:47.640> mean<00:01:47.759> I<00:01:47.970> mean<00:01:48.329> you<00:01:49.170> would

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320

or or maybe you have Asperger's or
something<00:01:57.630> i<00:01:57.780> really<00:01:58.020> don't<00:01:58.229> know<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.439> term

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
something i really don't know the term

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:06.390 
something i really don't know the term
for<00:01:58.890> it<00:01:59.090> but<00:02:00.860> i<00:02:02.420> mean<00:02:03.420> you<00:02:05.000> kind<00:02:06.000> in<00:02:06.180> the
