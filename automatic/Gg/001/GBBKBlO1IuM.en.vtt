 that's how he's in charge of his burrito tour so this place is called this 

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:08.809
 emblematic place of stone fountain where we are and where we take care 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:12.990
 as you said in an altruistic way these burritos right now have 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.430
 screen our friend 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:15.499
 farruquito 

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:19.949
 That is his name and the most curious curious this acts as a guide with 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.869

 its enclosure and the one that when we came to do a treatment with it reassure 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.420
 finally any treatment we do with con with alberto either from 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.470

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.210
 the web of the center are close and outstanding of each other go pretty 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.010
 insertion and social insertion is also possible in the world of 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:53.679
 animals 

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:56.989
 We continue touring this shelter of the burrito 'because we have to say 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.809
 and to remind the people that here you dedicate yourselves above all to the subject of 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.379
 protection and wants to be from the wall a protective of this list animals in 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.890
 every rule if we do not dedicate ourselves to breeding for that there are already 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.079
 nations as could be the rut donkeys that are dedicated to breeding 

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:13.009
 soto hidalgo 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:15.939
 precisely to prevent these animals from ending up abandoned 

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:20.079
 today we even investigate the case of abuse and denounce two possible abusers 

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:23.970
 we believe that the donkey that is an animal that has always been 

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:27.729
 linked man and the subsistence economy rural economy 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:32.319
 does not deserve to end up abandoned in a destination or that may harm your 

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:34.380
 wellbeing that's why we devote protection 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.480
 white here we have a friend and the earth a donkey 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.420
 Andalusian 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.220
 the lord what characteristics has the kind of this autonomy in lurgan la 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.259
 light is a large donkey 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:48.869
 is a blur has always been very appreciated to amortize it to create 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:49.520
 mules 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.940
 And also because of its large size already sounded by Perez it has been dedicated to the 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.990
 hardest tasks in the field and sown a very good result apart from a 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.250
 very gentle character but at the same time very alive is also the oldest of the 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.550
 family I can not 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.740
 He is not the oldest but he is almost 35 years old and also the old man or the older one 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.580
 of what we have here is 39 years old that is a donkey rescues a difference 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.379
 higher 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:14.230
 based in irun a portento 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.230
 the donkey depends on the life derived in third world countries 

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:21.259
 have a life expectancy of around 15 years in Spain and 

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:23.710
 is between 25 and 30 years old 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.530
 and in other countries that come from a life to a life expectancy of about 40 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.239
 years everything depends on how you have lived previously 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.950
 it's a picture the burrito do not go I wanted to know if that saucer was real 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.540
 It is the donkey as docile as it is painted literature 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.640
 if the donkey is an animal in general it has a great sensitivity 

00:02:41.419 --> 00:02:46.779
 We are going to see yesterday, I came from a trip, we came from backing a donkey and 

00:02:46.779 --> 00:02:49.239
 a person without a doubt we are slowly rebounding 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:53.209
 and recommended that he still had another who looked after the flock and also 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:56.749
 He was in charge of watching all the lambs that are born in his flock 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:00.660
 here we have these little ones small in size but the baby 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.060
 these are no longer adult walls despite their small size is a very 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.939
 special sardine or pure Sardinian breed 

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:10.319
 is a donkey has always been very appreciated by the shepherds 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:15.349
 both this donkey lice who are and adults little from their height then they 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:16.430
 respect and simat 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.890
 that's why walls changed on the island and on the island there were very few resources with the 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.909
 that larraz has been deriving in this animal so small is saying the 

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:27.010
 positive note situation in Syria is very curious this donkey is a zarco donkey 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.629
 conscious white that will have 

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:31.989
 wolf sprinkled with zavala and kosor malaise that has blue eyes 

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:37.269
 - AragÃ³n really the unusual but it is very rare to see 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:40.970
 and obviously you'll see well with eyes like this one that looks like manor 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.509
 it's something real tacna tacna 

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:46.539
 let's see a curious detail here also in another stage 

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:50.709
 for people to see so that people know and observe in the first person 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.469
 the great work that develops is here here we have perhaps the center of 

00:03:54.469 --> 00:03:58.069
 recovery the animals that arrive in worse condition already have here the 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:01.079
 veterinarian a specialized team are dedicated to take care of them and the farrier 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:04.859
 also because he could helmets very important this happens for example they are 

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:07.179
 donkeys that come from iraq de galicia 

00:04:07.179 --> 00:04:10.879
 in the end it was a group of the insurances that we have rescued from a very life 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:11.659
 sad 

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:15.790
 all their lives in a very dark stable without ever being able to get the light of the 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.090
 sun and without taking care of a casus helmets and as it can be for the images we are 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:22.120
 those who do not have just musculature 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.250
 Well, with this nice image with these friends, I've got these 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.229
 accompanying years this afternoon 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:32.120
 we leave it here above all congratulations for your work I want to take advantage 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.639
 to say that the shelter is open to all visitors and schoolchildren and that 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:38.710
 you can come when you believe because we come all days of the year will go after 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.360
 free and he has said thank you very much 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.260
 an important job they do with an animal that is very smart in 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:45.650
 against what you can think
