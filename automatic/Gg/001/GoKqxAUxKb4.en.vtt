00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
as out of it well I think was a very

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.620 
as out of it well I think was a very
good<00:00:06.420> first<00:00:06.870> to<00:00:07.440> set<00:00:07.680> for<00:00:07.890> me<00:00:08.040> I<00:00:08.820> think<00:00:09.480> I

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
good first to set for me I think I

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.900

was<00:00:12.030> playing<00:00:12.320> aggressive<00:00:13.320> with<00:00:13.559> not<00:00:13.710> many

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
was playing aggressive with not many

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.039 
was playing aggressive with not many
mistakes<00:00:14.450> changing<00:00:15.450> direction<00:00:15.599> with

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
mistakes changing direction with

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.220 
mistakes changing direction with
forehand<00:00:16.529> and<00:00:16.650> backhand<00:00:16.859> so<00:00:18.080> have<00:00:19.080> been<00:00:19.199> a

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
forehand and backhand so have been a

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.779 
forehand and backhand so have been a
great<00:00:19.439> two<00:00:19.590> sets<00:00:19.800> know<00:00:19.980> and<00:00:20.189> then<00:00:20.490> in<00:00:20.670> the

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
great two sets know and then in the

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.040 
great two sets know and then in the
third<00:00:21.000> I<00:00:21.119> think<00:00:21.150> I<00:00:21.359> lost<00:00:21.539> a<00:00:21.720> little<00:00:21.810> bit<00:00:21.960> the

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
third I think I lost a little bit the

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.990 
third I think I lost a little bit the
intensity<00:00:22.410> even<00:00:23.660> you<00:00:24.660> know<00:00:25.519> even<00:00:26.519> before<00:00:26.640> the

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
intensity even you know even before the

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.310 
intensity even you know even before the
five<00:00:27.180> for<00:00:27.920> only<00:00:29.390> being<00:00:30.390> honest<00:00:30.900> and<00:00:31.050> realistic

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
five for only being honest and realistic

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.970 
five for only being honest and realistic
in<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.099> third<00:00:32.989> only<00:00:33.989> one<00:00:34.110> very<00:00:34.320> positive<00:00:34.559> game

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
in the third only one very positive game

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.440 
in the third only one very positive game
that<00:00:35.160> was<00:00:35.690> after<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:37.910> three<00:00:38.910> -<00:00:39.030> for<00:00:39.210> me<00:00:39.300> with

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
that was after the three - for me with

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.690 
that was after the three - for me with
break<00:00:39.660> he<00:00:39.960> break<00:00:40.200> he<00:00:40.410> bring<00:00:40.590> me<00:00:40.710> back<00:00:40.890> so<00:00:41.340> then

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
break he break he bring me back so then

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.450 
break he break he bring me back so then
with<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.809> three<00:00:43.649> all<00:00:43.800> I<00:00:43.829> think<00:00:44.129> I<00:00:44.190> played<00:00:44.430> a

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
with the three all I think I played a

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.150 
with the three all I think I played a
fantastic<00:00:45.239> game<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:46.140> break<00:00:46.350> him<00:00:46.590> back<00:00:46.800> again

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
fantastic game to break him back again

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.790 
fantastic game to break him back again
no<00:00:47.370> so<00:00:47.579> but<00:00:48.329> after<00:00:48.629> that<00:00:48.750> I<00:00:49.020> think<00:00:49.440> my<00:00:49.559> search

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
no so but after that I think my search

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.299 
no so but after that I think my search
today<00:00:49.980> was<00:00:50.250> done<00:00:50.750> the<00:00:51.750> worst<00:00:51.930> thing<00:00:52.309> didn't

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
today was done the worst thing didn't

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.869 
today was done the worst thing didn't
start<00:00:54.500> enough<00:00:55.500> points<00:00:55.949> with<00:00:56.100> advantage<00:00:56.640> and

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
start enough points with advantage and

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.380 
start enough points with advantage and
that's<00:00:57.480> why<00:00:57.739> he<00:00:58.739> had<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:58.949> chance<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.489> to<00:01:00.210> bring

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
that's why he had the chance to to bring

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.219 
that's why he had the chance to to bring
me<00:01:00.570> in<00:01:00.739> in<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.920> third<00:01:02.480> twice<00:01:03.480> and<00:01:03.780> in<00:01:04.140> the

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689
