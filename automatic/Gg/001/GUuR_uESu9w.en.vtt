juice<00:03:38.880> let's<00:03:39.660> take<00:03:39.840> a<00:03:39.870> look

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:42.800 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.430 

since<00:03:43.070> the<00:03:43.340> the<00:03:43.550> sidecar<00:03:44.030> was<00:03:44.270> invented<00:03:45.230> in

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
since the the sidecar was invented in

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.320 
since the the sidecar was invented in
Europe<00:03:45.530> we're<00:03:46.220> going<00:03:46.370> to<00:03:46.430> use<00:03:46.550> a<00:03:46.580> Parisian

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.330 
Europe we're going to use a Parisian

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.540

shaker<00:03:47.660> which<00:03:48.020> is<00:03:48.170> similar<00:03:48.710> to<00:03:49.100> a<00:03:49.130> Boston

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:49.550 
shaker which is similar to a Boston

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:51.420 
shaker which is similar to a Boston
shaker<00:03:49.580> it's<00:03:50.300> got<00:03:50.570> a<00:03:50.600> slightly<00:03:51.260> different

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
shaker it's got a slightly different

00:03:51.430 --> 00:04:08.260 
shaker it's got a slightly different
look<00:03:52.430> to<00:03:52.610> it<00:04:06.550> so<00:04:07.550> that's<00:04:07.670> two<00:04:07.910> ounces<00:04:08.210> of

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:08.270 
look to it so that's two ounces of

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:18.530 
look to it so that's two ounces of
cognac<00:04:08.720> and<00:04:09.760> then<00:04:10.760> one<00:04:10.970> ounce<00:04:11.180> of<00:04:11.990> Cointreau

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
I like treating the sidecar also is a

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.510

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:19.380 
rim because my fingers always tend to

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.740 
rim because my fingers always tend to
get<00:05:19.530> sticky<00:05:19.820> there's<00:05:20.820> two<00:05:21.030> ways<00:05:21.240> to<00:05:21.270> deal<00:05:21.630> with

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:23.030 
get sticky there's two ways to deal with
this<00:05:21.840> especially<00:05:22.170> since<00:05:22.350> some<00:05:22.650> people<00:05:22.890> like

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:23.040 
this especially since some people like

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.640 
this especially since some people like
the<00:05:23.190> sugared<00:05:23.460> rim<00:05:23.580> in<00:05:24.540> this<00:05:24.750> case<00:05:24.960> I<00:05:25.200> took<00:05:25.470> in

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:25.650 
the sugared rim in this case I took in

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:28.970 
the sugared rim in this case I took in
half<00:05:25.980> sugar<00:05:26.340> the<00:05:26.580> rim<00:05:26.750> so<00:05:27.750> if<00:05:28.140> you<00:05:28.350> like<00:05:28.770> the

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:28.980 
half sugar the rim so if you like the

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:30.620 
half sugar the rim so if you like the
sugar<00:05:29.250> with<00:05:29.610> your<00:05:29.790> drink<00:05:30.060> you<00:05:30.090> can<00:05:30.330> drink<00:05:30.510> it

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:30.630 
sugar with your drink you can drink it

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.540 
sugar with your drink you can drink it

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550 
on the side with sugared rim in if you

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:33.890 
on the side with sugared rim in if you
don't<00:05:32.760> like<00:05:32.940> the<00:05:33.090> sugar<00:05:33.330> in<00:05:33.450> your<00:05:33.480> drink<00:05:33.780> you

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:33.900 
don't like the sugar in your drink you

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.810 
don't like the sugar in your drink you
can<00:05:34.110> drink<00:05:34.290> it<00:05:34.410> on<00:05:34.500> the<00:05:34.590> clean<00:05:34.770> side<00:05:34.980> and

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:35.820 
can drink it on the clean side and

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:37.460 
can drink it on the clean side and
another<00:05:36.150> important<00:05:36.570> aspect<00:05:36.930> of<00:05:37.020> this<00:05:37.170> helps

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:37.470 
another important aspect of this helps

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:39.950 
another important aspect of this helps
with<00:05:37.680> the<00:05:37.920> sticky<00:05:38.220> finger<00:05:38.490> problem<00:05:38.850> is<00:05:39.000> you

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 
with the sticky finger problem is you

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.110 
with the sticky finger problem is you
want<00:05:40.080> to<00:05:40.230> prepare<00:05:40.680> the<00:05:40.920> glass<00:05:41.220> ahead<00:05:41.790> of<00:05:41.910> time

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.120 
want to prepare the glass ahead of time

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.990 
want to prepare the glass ahead of time
I<00:05:42.390> actually<00:05:42.960> prepared<00:05:43.770> this<00:05:44.160> several<00:05:44.700> hours

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000 
I actually prepared this several hours

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000 
I actually prepared this several hours
ago<00:05:45.240> so<00:05:45.930> the<00:05:46.050> sugar<00:05:46.200> had<00:05:46.440> a<00:05:46.470> chance<00:05:46.800> to

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.010 
ago so the sugar had a chance to

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:49.490 
ago so the sugar had a chance to
actually<00:05:47.190> solidify<00:05:48.180> on<00:05:48.330> the<00:05:48.420> outside<00:05:48.870> so<00:05:49.410> the

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:49.500 
actually solidify on the outside so the

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.040 
actually solidify on the outside so the
glass<00:05:49.740> itself<00:05:50.250> is<00:05:50.520> no<00:05:50.700> longer<00:05:50.730> wet<00:05:51.300> and<00:05:51.540> so

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.050 
glass itself is no longer wet and so

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:53.000 
glass itself is no longer wet and so
we're<00:05:52.170> not<00:05:52.230> going<00:05:52.380> to<00:05:52.440> have<00:05:52.560> condensation

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:53.010 
we're not going to have condensation

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:55.220 
we're not going to have condensation
dripping<00:05:53.760> the<00:05:54.060> sugar<00:05:54.300> down<00:05:54.570> the<00:05:54.780> outside<00:05:54.930> of

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:55.230 
dripping the sugar down the outside of

00:05:55.230 --> 00:06:00.980 
dripping the sugar down the outside of
the<00:05:55.290> glass<00:05:55.470> onto<00:05:56.280> the<00:05:56.400> stem<00:05:59.780> so<00:06:00.780> let's<00:06:00.900> go

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:00.990 
the glass onto the stem so let's go

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:02.210 
the glass onto the stem so let's go
ahead<00:06:01.110> and<00:06:01.230> strain<00:06:01.440> that<00:06:01.470> and<00:06:01.710> now<00:06:01.800> again<00:06:01.950> an

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:02.220 
ahead and strain that and now again an

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:03.050 
ahead and strain that and now again an
important<00:06:02.580> thing<00:06:02.670> here<00:06:02.820> when<00:06:02.940> you're

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:03.060 
important thing here when you're

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:04.340 
important thing here when you're
straining<00:06:03.300> make<00:06:03.540> sure<00:06:03.690> you<00:06:03.810> do<00:06:03.900> it<00:06:04.020> carefully

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:04.350 
straining make sure you do it carefully

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:06.230 
straining make sure you do it carefully
so<00:06:04.650> you're<00:06:05.010> not<00:06:05.130> slopping<00:06:05.730> over<00:06:05.910> the<00:06:06.030> side

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.240 
so you're not slopping over the side

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.330 
so you're not slopping over the side
which<00:06:06.510> would<00:06:06.750> add<00:06:07.140> water<00:06:07.620> to<00:06:07.800> the<00:06:07.920> outside<00:06:08.250> of

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:08.340 
which would add water to the outside of

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:20.730 
which would add water to the outside of
the<00:06:08.400> glass

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:20.740 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:23.010 

and<00:06:21.670> there<00:06:21.880> we<00:06:21.970> have<00:06:22.060> a<00:06:22.090> sidecar<00:06:22.510> cocktail

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:23.020 
and there we have a sidecar cocktail

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:24.900 
and there we have a sidecar cocktail
made<00:06:23.620> with<00:06:23.650> great<00:06:24.010> ingredients<00:06:24.190> which

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:24.910 
made with great ingredients which

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:28.320 
made with great ingredients which
results<00:06:25.300> in<00:06:25.390> a<00:06:25.480> great<00:06:25.810> cocktail
