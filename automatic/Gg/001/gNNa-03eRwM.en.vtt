Steve<00:02:49.850> that<00:02:50.060> the<00:02:50.470> walkers<00:02:51.470> are<00:02:51.680> sort<00:02:51.860> of<00:02:51.890> a

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
Steve that the walkers are sort of a

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.860 
Steve that the walkers are sort of a
race<00:02:52.190> apart<00:02:52.549> in<00:02:52.820> athletics<00:02:53.420> is<00:02:53.540> that<00:02:53.660> right

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
race apart in athletics is that right

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.600 
race apart in athletics is that right
and<00:02:54.739> well<00:02:54.950> they<00:02:55.010> certainly<00:02:55.250> train

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
and well they certainly train

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.190 
and well they certainly train
differently<00:02:55.790> than<00:02:56.150> most<00:02:56.330> people<00:02:56.690> means<00:02:56.870> some

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
differently than most people means some

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.720 
differently than most people means some
of<00:02:57.230> those<00:02:57.350> guys<00:02:57.590> are<00:02:57.830> out<00:02:57.950> training<00:02:58.370> for<00:02:58.519> a

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
of those guys are out training for a

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.390 
of those guys are out training for a
tour<00:02:59.269> now<00:02:59.420> and<00:02:59.570> now<00:02:59.690> at<00:03:00.290> a<00:03:00.380> time<00:03:00.590> they<00:03:01.250> take

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
tour now and now at a time they take

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.860 
tour now and now at a time they take
their<00:03:01.549> lunch<00:03:01.670> with<00:03:01.910> them<00:03:02.060> and<00:03:02.180> their<00:03:02.480> tea<00:03:02.660> with

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
their lunch with them and their tea with

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.930 
their lunch with them and their tea with
stop<00:03:03.680> and<00:03:03.830> have<00:03:03.920> it<00:03:04.010> then<00:03:04.160> continue<00:03:04.760> walking

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
stop and have it then continue walking

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.000 
stop and have it then continue walking
that<00:03:05.239> sort<00:03:05.450> of<00:03:05.480> thing<00:03:05.660> but<00:03:06.080> I<00:03:06.140> think<00:03:06.290> they

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
that sort of thing but I think they

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.380 
that sort of thing but I think they
often<00:03:07.220> get<00:03:07.340> a<00:03:07.370> few<00:03:07.549> strange<00:03:07.760> glances<00:03:08.000> too

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
often get a few strange glances too

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:09.850 
often get a few strange glances too
don't<00:03:08.570> they<00:03:08.690> because<00:03:09.019> of<00:03:09.079> the<00:03:09.170> style<00:03:09.500> of<00:03:09.680> walk

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
don't they because of the style of walk

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.710 
don't they because of the style of walk
that's<00:03:10.070> right<00:03:10.340> yes<00:03:10.610> I'm<00:03:10.850> using<00:03:11.090> about<00:03:11.450> it<00:03:11.600> to

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
that's right yes I'm using about it to

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.569 
that's right yes I'm using about it to
something<00:03:12.049> what<00:03:12.290> it<00:03:12.829> restricts<00:03:13.310> the<00:03:13.430> room

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:13.579 
something what it restricts the room

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:14.710 
something what it restricts the room
that's<00:03:13.760> the<00:03:13.850> funny<00:03:14.090> thing<00:03:14.150> about<00:03:14.329> it<00:03:14.510> I<00:03:14.630> mean

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
that's the funny thing about it I mean

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:15.789 
that's the funny thing about it I mean
most<00:03:14.900> people<00:03:14.989> would<00:03:15.200> normally<00:03:15.500> think<00:03:15.620> well

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:15.799 
most people would normally think well

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:17.710 
most people would normally think well
why<00:03:15.920> doesn't<00:03:16.160> he<00:03:16.280> run<00:03:16.430> but<00:03:17.090> the<00:03:17.150> whole<00:03:17.269> idea<00:03:17.630> of

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
why doesn't he run but the whole idea of

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.330 
why doesn't he run but the whole idea of
walking<00:03:18.049> is<00:03:18.170> that<00:03:18.320> it<00:03:18.410> restricts<00:03:19.190> your

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
walking is that it restricts your

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.820 
walking is that it restricts your
technique<00:03:19.760> and<00:03:20.030> that<00:03:20.090> you<00:03:20.209> must<00:03:20.420> continue<00:03:20.830> in

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
technique and that you must continue in

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:22.540 
technique and that you must continue in
the<00:03:22.010> confined

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:22.550 
the confined

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:25.030 
the confined
style<00:03:23.270> hmm<00:03:23.870> and<00:03:23.989> that's<00:03:24.500> what<00:03:24.650> makes<00:03:24.800> it<00:03:24.920> so

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
style hmm and that's what makes it so

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.559 
style hmm and that's what makes it so
funny<00:03:25.250> because<00:03:25.340> these<00:03:25.580> guys<00:03:25.760> are<00:03:26.000> obviously

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:26.569 
funny because these guys are obviously

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:29.050 
funny because these guys are obviously
going<00:03:26.689> faster<00:03:27.079> faster<00:03:27.499> as<00:03:27.769> times<00:03:28.010> improve<00:03:28.430> so

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
going faster faster as times improve so

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.399 
going faster faster as times improve so
their<00:03:29.239> star<00:03:29.420> looks<00:03:29.629> more<00:03:29.840> and<00:03:29.930> more<00:03:30.049> awkward

00:03:30.399 --> 00:03:30.409 
their star looks more and more awkward

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:31.509 
their star looks more and more awkward
but<00:03:30.829> they're<00:03:30.950> putting<00:03:31.069> an<00:03:31.189> awful<00:03:31.310> lot<00:03:31.489> of

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519 
but they're putting an awful lot of

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:33.039 
but they're putting an awful lot of
effort<00:03:31.639> into<00:03:31.849> really<00:03:32.209> the<00:03:32.719> best<00:03:32.900> way<00:03:33.019> of

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:33.049 
effort into really the best way of

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:36.220 
effort into really the best way of
getting<00:03:33.260> from<00:03:33.709> A<00:03:33.889> to<00:03:33.920> B<00:03:34.099> on<00:03:35.060> your<00:03:35.329> legs<00:03:35.599> if

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
getting from A to B on your legs if

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.369 
getting from A to B on your legs if
you're<00:03:36.409> racing<00:03:36.650> is<00:03:37.069> running<00:03:37.549> isn't<00:03:37.819> it<00:03:37.909> really

00:03:38.369 --> 00:03:38.379 
you're racing is running isn't it really

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:40.660 
you're racing is running isn't it really
it<00:03:39.379> often<00:03:39.680> seems<00:03:39.859> it<00:03:39.950> wants<00:03:40.159> a<00:03:40.219> strange<00:03:40.459> thing

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
it often seems it wants a strange thing

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:42.129 
it often seems it wants a strange thing
to<00:03:40.730> sort<00:03:40.999> of<00:03:41.060> cramp<00:03:41.299> your<00:03:41.389> style<00:03:41.480> by<00:03:41.840> having<00:03:42.079> a

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:42.139 
to sort of cramp your style by having a

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:44.619 
to sort of cramp your style by having a
wall<00:03:42.349> yes<00:03:43.129> I<00:03:43.310> mean<00:03:43.430> but<00:03:43.849> I<00:03:44.000> think<00:03:44.239> that<00:03:44.359> it's

00:03:44.619 --> 00:03:44.629 
wall yes I mean but I think that it's

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:46.539 
wall yes I mean but I think that it's
dependent<00:03:44.959> upon<00:03:45.019> what<00:03:45.230> distance<00:03:45.560> you<00:03:45.620> do<00:03:45.859> um<00:03:46.159> I

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549 
dependent upon what distance you do um I

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:48.789 
dependent upon what distance you do um I
think<00:03:46.790> in<00:03:47.269> the<00:03:47.359> earlier<00:03:47.659> days<00:03:47.930> the<00:03:48.530> further

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:48.799 
think in the earlier days the further

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:51.160 
think in the earlier days the further
that<00:03:49.129> the<00:03:49.579> distance<00:03:49.909> went<00:03:50.150> it<00:03:50.750> switched<00:03:51.049> over

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
that the distance went it switched over

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.020 
that the distance went it switched over
from<00:03:51.319> being<00:03:51.560> a<00:03:51.709> running<00:03:52.010> event<00:03:52.400> to<00:03:52.790> a<00:03:52.819> walking

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
from being a running event to a walking

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:54.250 
from being a running event to a walking
event<00:03:53.359> because<00:03:53.540> people<00:03:53.810> just<00:03:53.900> couldn't<00:03:54.169> run

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
event because people just couldn't run

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.979 
event because people just couldn't run
any<00:03:54.439> fart<00:03:54.680> any<00:03:54.950> further<00:03:55.129> but<00:03:56.060> I<00:03:56.299> ran<00:03:56.629> a<00:03:56.659> bit<00:03:56.870> and

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:56.989 
any fart any further but I ran a bit and

00:03:56.989 --> 00:03:58.209 
any fart any further but I ran a bit and
walked<00:03:57.109> a<00:03:57.230> bit<00:03:57.379> you<00:03:57.530> mean<00:03:57.680> yes<00:03:57.859> that's<00:03:58.040> right

00:03:58.209 --> 00:03:58.219 
walked a bit you mean yes that's right

00:03:58.219 --> 00:03:59.589 
walked a bit you mean yes that's right
and<00:03:58.430> eventually<00:03:58.969> I<00:03:59.000> found<00:03:59.180> that<00:03:59.359> if<00:03:59.480> they

00:03:59.589 --> 00:03:59.599 
and eventually I found that if they

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:00.819 
and eventually I found that if they
walked<00:03:59.810> all<00:03:59.989> the<00:04:00.109> way<00:04:00.139> they<00:04:00.409> do<00:04:00.560> it<00:04:00.650> quicker

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:00.829 
walked all the way they do it quicker

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:03.009 
walked all the way they do it quicker
than<00:04:00.980> running<00:04:01.159> but<00:04:02.150> now<00:04:02.269> obviously<00:04:02.780> is<00:04:02.930> the

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:03.019 
than running but now obviously is the

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:04.479 
than running but now obviously is the
running<00:04:03.260> Standards<00:04:03.620> and<00:04:03.739> the<00:04:04.069> ultra<00:04:04.370> distance

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:04.489 
running Standards and the ultra distance

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:05.949 
running Standards and the ultra distance
runners<00:04:04.939> are<00:04:05.060> coming<00:04:05.299> through<00:04:05.419> then<00:04:05.780> their

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 
runners are coming through then their

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:07.689 
runners are coming through then their
times<00:04:06.169> are<00:04:06.379> improving<00:04:06.769> but<00:04:07.069> there's<00:04:07.549> still<00:04:07.669> a

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:07.699 
times are improving but there's still a

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:09.069 
times are improving but there's still a
case<00:04:07.909> for<00:04:08.120> keeping<00:04:08.209> walking<00:04:08.689> in<00:04:08.780> most

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:09.079 
case for keeping walking in most

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:10.569 
case for keeping walking in most
championships<00:04:09.530> because<00:04:09.650> it<00:04:10.069> is<00:04:10.189> a<00:04:10.219> very

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:10.579 
championships because it is a very

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:12.610 
championships because it is a very
peculiar<00:04:11.120> and<00:04:11.540> a<00:04:11.719> very<00:04:11.840> specialized<00:04:12.290> event

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
peculiar and a very specialized event

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.060 
peculiar and a very specialized event
and<00:04:13.069> thousands<00:04:13.400> around<00:04:13.489> the<00:04:13.639> country<00:04:13.939> do
