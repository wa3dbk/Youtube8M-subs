right there so now you know what the

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.390 
right there so now you know what the
soil<00:00:19.400> food<00:00:19.730> web<00:00:19.789> is<00:00:20.090> I<00:00:21.189> guess<00:00:22.189> I<00:00:22.279> better

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:22.400 
soil food web is I guess I better

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.679 
soil food web is I guess I better
actually<00:00:22.610> talk<00:00:22.880> about<00:00:23.090> it<00:00:23.210> because<00:00:23.330> uh

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:23.689 
actually talk about it because uh

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:25.660 
actually talk about it because uh
the<00:00:24.109> video<00:00:24.320> would<00:00:24.470> be<00:00:24.529> too<00:00:24.710> short<00:00:24.890> then<00:00:25.130> I'm

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:25.670 
the video would be too short then I'm

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:26.769 
the video would be too short then I'm
gonna<00:00:25.789> put<00:00:25.970> it<00:00:26.060> on<00:00:26.090> a<00:00:26.179> bit<00:00:26.330> of<00:00:26.359> an<00:00:26.480> angle<00:00:26.750> here

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:26.779 
gonna put it on a bit of an angle here

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:27.820 
gonna put it on a bit of an angle here
otherwise<00:00:27.199> you're<00:00:27.410> gonna<00:00:27.470> see<00:00:27.710> the

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:27.830 
otherwise you're gonna see the

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.880 
otherwise you're gonna see the
reflection<00:00:28.279> of<00:00:28.340> my<00:00:28.400> window<00:00:28.900> I<00:00:29.900> think<00:00:30.410> so<00:00:30.740> this

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
reflection of my window I think so this

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.220 
reflection of my window I think so this
I<00:00:31.189> think<00:00:31.310> that'll<00:00:31.640> be<00:00:31.670> good<00:00:31.820> like<00:00:31.939> this<00:00:32.119> so<00:00:32.750> you

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.230 
I think that'll be good like this so you

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:34.540 
I think that'll be good like this so you
may<00:00:33.379> if<00:00:33.589> you're<00:00:33.739> new<00:00:33.830> to<00:00:33.860> gardening<00:00:34.070> you<00:00:34.430> may

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:34.550 
may if you're new to gardening you may

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.070 
may if you're new to gardening you may
have<00:00:34.670> come<00:00:34.850> across<00:00:35.000> this<00:00:35.239> term<00:00:35.300> soil<00:00:35.839> food<00:00:36.019> web

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:36.080 
have come across this term soil food web

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.219 
have come across this term soil food web
and<00:00:36.470> wondered<00:00:36.800> what<00:00:37.040> that<00:00:37.100> meant<00:00:38.019> so<00:00:39.019> it

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:39.229 
and wondered what that meant so it

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:41.170 
and wondered what that meant so it
really<00:00:39.470> refers<00:00:39.739> to<00:00:39.850> everything<00:00:40.850> all<00:00:41.089> the

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
really refers to everything all the

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.969 
really refers to everything all the
organisms<00:00:41.780> all<00:00:41.960> the<00:00:42.080> life<00:00:42.260> forms<00:00:42.620> that<00:00:42.680> live

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:42.979 
organisms all the life forms that live

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:46.810 
organisms all the life forms that live
in<00:00:43.339> and<00:00:43.729> on<00:00:43.909> the<00:00:44.360> soil<00:00:44.830> and<00:00:45.830> the<00:00:46.400> reason<00:00:46.760> we

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
in and on the soil and the reason we

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.399 
in and on the soil and the reason we
call<00:00:46.970> it<00:00:47.000> a<00:00:47.119> web<00:00:47.360> this<00:00:47.690> is<00:00:47.839> what<00:00:47.989> I<00:00:48.019> really<00:00:48.260> want

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:48.409 
call it a web this is what I really want

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:51.399 
call it a web this is what I really want
to<00:00:48.470> talk<00:00:48.559> about<00:00:48.619> today<00:00:49.000> is<00:00:50.000> because<00:00:50.659> it's<00:00:51.140> it's

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:51.409 
to talk about today is because it's it's

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:52.149 
to talk about today is because it's it's
to<00:00:51.559> show<00:00:51.739> how<00:00:51.890> they're<00:00:52.010> all<00:00:52.129> interconnected

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:52.159 
to show how they're all interconnected

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:54.640 
to show how they're all interconnected
if<00:00:53.119> you<00:00:53.390> have<00:00:53.510> a<00:00:53.540> spider's<00:00:53.960> web<00:00:54.110> if<00:00:54.290> you<00:00:54.379> cut

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:54.650 
if you have a spider's web if you cut

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.619 
if you have a spider's web if you cut
you<00:00:54.890> know<00:00:55.010> one<00:00:55.220> or<00:00:55.339> two<00:00:55.369> strands<00:00:56.089> of<00:00:56.299> that<00:00:56.420> web

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:56.629 
you know one or two strands of that web

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:59.259 
you know one or two strands of that web
it<00:00:56.960> had<00:00:57.500> it<00:00:57.710> might<00:00:57.979> impact<00:00:58.369> the<00:00:58.670> whole<00:00:58.790> web<00:00:59.000> and

00:00:59.259 --> 00:00:59.269 
it had it might impact the whole web and

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:00.729 
it had it might impact the whole web and
it's<00:00:59.600> the<00:00:59.689> same<00:00:59.869> with<00:01:00.019> this<00:01:00.170> all<00:01:00.470> of<00:01:00.619> these

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
it's the same with this all of these

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:03.759 
it's the same with this all of these
organisms<00:01:01.100> are<00:01:01.570> important<00:01:02.570> and<00:01:03.409> they're

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:03.769 
organisms are important and they're

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:05.530 
organisms are important and they're
really<00:01:03.979> important<00:01:04.580> for<00:01:04.670> our<00:01:04.729> Gardens<00:01:05.150> so<00:01:05.420> what

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
really important for our Gardens so what

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.649 
really important for our Gardens so what
I<00:01:05.570> did<00:01:05.659> is<00:01:05.869> I<00:01:05.960> drew<00:01:06.229> the<00:01:06.680> plants<00:01:07.130> in<00:01:07.490> the<00:01:08.299> middle

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659 
I did is I drew the plants in the middle

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:10.929 
I did is I drew the plants in the middle
it<00:01:09.470> doesn't<00:01:09.530> really<00:01:09.770> matter<00:01:10.010> I<00:01:10.100> just<00:01:10.520> did<00:01:10.820> that

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:10.939 
it doesn't really matter I just did that

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:12.459 
it doesn't really matter I just did that
because<00:01:11.000> that<00:01:11.630> was<00:01:11.810> the<00:01:11.899> first<00:01:12.109> thing<00:01:12.200> I<00:01:12.320> drew

00:01:12.459 --> 00:01:12.469 
because that was the first thing I drew

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:17.319 
because that was the first thing I drew
and<00:01:13.420> down<00:01:14.420> here<00:01:14.780> I<00:01:14.960> have<00:01:15.530> some<00:01:15.920> bacteria<00:01:16.460> which

00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:17.329 
and down here I have some bacteria which

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:19.959 
and down here I have some bacteria which
are<00:01:17.479> tiny<00:01:17.780> one-celled<00:01:18.729> organisms<00:01:19.729> that

00:01:19.959 --> 00:01:19.969 
are tiny one-celled organisms that

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:21.700 
are tiny one-celled organisms that
they're<00:01:20.299> you<00:01:20.479> know<00:01:20.509> there<00:01:20.719> could<00:01:20.810> be<00:01:20.869> 30,000

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
they're you know there could be 30,000

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.800 
they're you know there could be 30,000
different<00:01:21.979> species<00:01:22.520> of<00:01:22.880> them<00:01:23.060> in<00:01:23.179> a<00:01:23.240> gram<00:01:23.479> of

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
different species of them in a gram of

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.169 
different species of them in a gram of
healthy<00:01:24.079> soil<00:01:24.289> so<00:01:24.950> they're<00:01:25.100> very<00:01:25.520> very<00:01:25.670> tiny

00:01:26.169 --> 00:01:26.179 
healthy soil so they're very very tiny

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:28.389 
healthy soil so they're very very tiny
we<00:01:26.630> have<00:01:26.749> fungi<00:01:27.289> which<00:01:27.590> are<00:01:27.710> also<00:01:27.859> very<00:01:28.009> tiny

00:01:28.389 --> 00:01:28.399 
we have fungi which are also very tiny

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:30.730 
we have fungi which are also very tiny
and<00:01:28.700> protists<00:01:29.479> which<00:01:29.689> are<00:01:29.929> also<00:01:30.049> small<00:01:30.469> like

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
and protists which are also small like

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:31.959 
and protists which are also small like
Paramecium<00:01:31.429> there's<00:01:31.609> all<00:01:31.670> kinds<00:01:31.909> of

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:31.969 
Paramecium there's all kinds of

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:35.109 
Paramecium there's all kinds of
odds-and-ends<00:01:32.570> protists<00:01:33.140> and<00:01:33.890> then<00:01:34.640> I<00:01:34.670> drew

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
odds-and-ends protists and then I drew

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:37.239 
odds-and-ends protists and then I drew
animals<00:01:35.539> up<00:01:35.659> here<00:01:35.689> and<00:01:36.499> this<00:01:36.649> I<00:01:36.890> guarantee

00:01:37.239 --> 00:01:37.249 
animals up here and this I guarantee

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:38.859 
animals up here and this I guarantee
this<00:01:37.369> is<00:01:37.520> the<00:01:37.640> first<00:01:37.850> soil<00:01:38.119> food<00:01:38.359> web

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
this is the first soil food web

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:41.050 
this is the first soil food web
drawing<00:01:39.170> with<00:01:39.319> a<00:01:39.740> unicorn<00:01:40.399> and<00:01:40.579> probably<00:01:40.969> the

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
drawing with a unicorn and probably the

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.819 
drawing with a unicorn and probably the
last<00:01:41.240> so<00:01:41.659> this<00:01:41.840> is<00:01:41.960> a<00:01:41.990> real<00:01:42.170> special<00:01:42.409> day<00:01:42.649> here

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:42.829 
last so this is a real special day here

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:45.700 
last so this is a real special day here
I<00:01:42.859> think<00:01:43.130> so<00:01:43.729> what's<00:01:44.329> going<00:01:44.600> on<00:01:44.719> here<00:01:44.990> is<00:01:45.170> all

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
I think so what's going on here is all

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.789 
I think so what's going on here is all
of<00:01:45.770> these<00:01:46.189> things<00:01:46.249> impact<00:01:46.789> each<00:01:47.179> other<00:01:47.799> you

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 
of these things impact each other you

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:50.649 
of these things impact each other you
know<00:01:48.920> many<00:01:49.189> of<00:01:49.249> them<00:01:49.429> eat<00:01:49.609> plants<00:01:50.119> bacteria

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
know many of them eat plants bacteria

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:53.139 
know many of them eat plants bacteria
fungi<00:01:51.049> protists<00:01:51.499> animals<00:01:52.249> eat<00:01:53.119> plants

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:53.149 
fungi protists animals eat plants

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:55.539 
fungi protists animals eat plants
obviously<00:01:54.049> the<00:01:54.530> Unicorn<00:01:54.920> is<00:01:55.009> a<00:01:55.069> herbivore<00:01:55.520> so

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:55.549 
obviously the Unicorn is a herbivore so

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:57.690 
obviously the Unicorn is a herbivore so
it<00:01:55.880> only<00:01:55.999> eats<00:01:56.149> plants<00:01:56.389> I'm<00:01:57.079> pretty<00:01:57.350> sure

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
it only eats plants I'm pretty sure

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.010 
it only eats plants I'm pretty sure
although<00:01:58.700> in<00:01:58.880> Harry<00:01:59.090> Potter<00:01:59.149> there<00:01:59.659> was<00:01:59.749> kind

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
although in Harry Potter there was kind

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.410 
although in Harry Potter there was kind
of<00:02:00.109> a<00:02:00.200> was<00:02:01.189> that<00:02:01.340> a<00:02:01.369> unicorn<00:02:01.670> that<00:02:01.969> was<00:02:02.030> eating

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
of a was that a unicorn that was eating

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.080 
of a was that a unicorn that was eating
a<00:02:02.539> I<00:02:02.840> don't<00:02:03.499> remember<00:02:03.709> but<00:02:04.549> I<00:02:04.639> think<00:02:04.850> unicorns

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
a I don't remember but I think unicorns

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.050 
a I don't remember but I think unicorns
are<00:02:05.450> herbivores<00:02:06.429> then<00:02:07.429> we<00:02:07.520> have<00:02:07.729> you<00:02:07.969> know

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
are herbivores then we have you know

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.300 
are herbivores then we have you know
fungi<00:02:08.600> and<00:02:08.750> bacteria<00:02:08.810> the<00:02:09.470> like<00:02:09.740> the<00:02:10.009> fungi

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
fungi and bacteria the like the fungi

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.010 
fungi and bacteria the like the fungi
will<00:02:10.459> eat<00:02:10.610> the<00:02:10.759> bacteria<00:02:10.880> the<00:02:11.360> protists<00:02:11.780> will

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
will eat the bacteria the protists will

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
will eat the bacteria the protists will
eat<00:02:12.200> these<00:02:12.470> other<00:02:12.650> these<00:02:13.069> other<00:02:13.130> organisms

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
eat these other these other organisms

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.290 
eat these other these other organisms
animals<00:02:16.040> especially<00:02:16.280> small<00:02:16.820> animals<00:02:17.240> like

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
animals especially small animals like

animals especially small animals like
earthworms

or Neiman like the tiny animals like
nematodes<00:02:22.220> they'll<00:02:22.400> eat<00:02:22.730> protists<00:02:23.450> and<00:02:23.540> fungi

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
nematodes they'll eat protists and fungi

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.870 
nematodes they'll eat protists and fungi
and<00:02:23.900> bacteria<00:02:24.020> they<00:02:24.830> all<00:02:24.950> eat<00:02:25.160> each<00:02:25.280> other<00:02:25.460> but

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
and bacteria they all eat each other but

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.360 
and bacteria they all eat each other but
they<00:02:26.030> also<00:02:26.210> work<00:02:26.600> together<00:02:27.070> you<00:02:28.070> know<00:02:28.190> there

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
they also work together you know there

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.160 
they also work together you know there
are<00:02:28.460> cooperative<00:02:28.850> beneficial<00:02:29.630> relationships

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
are cooperative beneficial relationships

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.130 
are cooperative beneficial relationships
that<00:02:30.320> happen<00:02:30.620> between<00:02:31.360> all<00:02:32.360> like<00:02:32.810> many<00:02:33.020> of

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
that happen between all like many of

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.930 
that happen between all like many of
these<00:02:33.230> things<00:02:33.440> bacteria<00:02:34.100> and<00:02:34.280> plants<00:02:34.580> fungi

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
these things bacteria and plants fungi

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.630 
these things bacteria and plants fungi
and<00:02:35.060> plants<00:02:35.180> protists<00:02:35.900> and<00:02:36.080> plants<00:02:36.640> animals

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
and plants protists and plants animals

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.420 
and plants protists and plants animals
and<00:02:37.850> microbes<00:02:38.500> microbes<00:02:39.500> are<00:02:39.710> friendly<00:02:40.310> with

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
and microbes microbes are friendly with

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.350 
and microbes microbes are friendly with
everyone<00:02:40.730> and<00:02:41.090> they<00:02:41.600> also<00:02:41.750> eat<00:02:42.170> everyone<00:02:43.360> so

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
everyone and they also eat everyone so

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.360 
everyone and they also eat everyone so
it's<00:02:44.570> it's<00:02:44.810> a<00:02:44.930> very<00:02:44.960> interconnected<00:02:45.530> web<00:02:46.070> and

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
it's it's a very interconnected web and

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.820 
it's it's a very interconnected web and
I<00:02:46.760> think<00:02:46.970> the<00:02:47.060> video<00:02:47.270> is<00:02:47.330> long<00:02:47.540> enough<00:02:47.780> now<00:02:47.960> so

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
I think the video is long enough now so

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:49.990 
I think the video is long enough now so
I'm<00:02:48.920> not<00:02:49.040> going<00:02:49.190> to<00:02:49.280> get<00:02:49.370> into<00:02:49.490> too<00:02:49.640> much<00:02:49.670> more

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
I'm not going to get into too much more

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.300 
I'm not going to get into too much more
detail<00:02:50.030> about<00:02:50.360> why<00:02:51.260> this<00:02:51.320> is<00:02:51.650> so<00:02:51.770> important

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
detail about why this is so important

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.900 
detail about why this is so important
but<00:02:52.760> the<00:02:53.300> reason<00:02:53.660> ultimately<00:02:54.500> is<00:02:54.650> because<00:02:54.980> all

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
but the reason ultimately is because all

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:56.890 
but the reason ultimately is because all
of<00:02:55.970> these<00:02:56.330> things

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
of these things

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.200 
of these things
having<00:02:57.410> a<00:02:57.500> diverse<00:02:57.890> soil<00:02:58.400> food<00:02:58.610> web<00:02:58.670> is<00:02:59.090> going

00:02:59.200 --> 00:02:59.210 
having a diverse soil food web is going

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:00.670 
having a diverse soil food web is going
to<00:02:59.300> make<00:02:59.420> for<00:02:59.600> a<00:02:59.630> better<00:02:59.840> healthier<00:03:00.230> garden

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
to make for a better healthier garden

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.130 
to make for a better healthier garden
for<00:03:00.890> us<00:03:01.060> and<00:03:02.060> so<00:03:02.240> that's<00:03:02.510> why<00:03:02.630> I<00:03:02.660> do<00:03:02.810> talk<00:03:03.110> about

for us and so that's why I do talk about

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.610 
for us and so that's why I do talk about
