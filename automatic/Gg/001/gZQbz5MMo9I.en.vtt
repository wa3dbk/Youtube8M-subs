00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.020 
another gloss on top of it because if
you<00:04:49.110> mess<00:04:49.140> it<00:04:49.470> up<00:04:49.710> that's<00:04:50.669> the<00:04:50.820> way<00:04:50.910> it's<00:04:51.000> done

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
you mess it up that's the way it's done

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.190 
you mess it up that's the way it's done
that<00:04:51.210> look<00:04:51.390> so<00:04:51.600> i'll<00:04:51.660> just<00:04:51.720> show<00:04:51.960> you<00:04:51.990> what<00:04:52.169> i

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:52.200 
that look so i'll just show you what i

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:58.200 
that look so i'll just show you what i
mean<00:04:52.260> by<00:04:52.560> that<00:04:52.710> okay

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:59.640 

so<00:04:58.750> that's<00:04:58.930> going<00:04:59.080> to<00:04:59.169> be<00:04:59.229> the<00:04:59.380> color

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
so that's going to be the color

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:06.980 
so that's going to be the color
basically<00:05:00.840> now<00:05:01.840> go<00:05:02.169> in<00:05:02.350> and

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:06.990 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:11.250 

clean<00:05:07.740> up<00:05:07.950> the<00:05:08.130> edges

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:11.260 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:15.050 

and<00:05:11.530> pay

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.510 

and<00:05:15.630> that's<00:05:15.840> basically<00:05:16.050> me<00:05:17.040> to<00:05:17.190> show<00:05:17.370> you<00:05:17.430> over

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
and that's basically me to show you over

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.420 
and that's basically me to show you over
here<00:05:18.260> you<00:05:19.260> know<00:05:19.380> it<00:05:19.710> doesn't<00:05:19.950> really<00:05:20.160> go<00:05:20.400> very

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
here you know it doesn't really go very

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.070 
here you know it doesn't really go very
far<00:05:20.970> I<00:05:21.770> feel<00:05:22.770> like<00:05:22.830> I<00:05:22.980> would<00:05:23.100> use<00:05:23.280> it<00:05:23.400> a<00:05:23.460> lot

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.080 
far I feel like I would use it a lot

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.570 
far I feel like I would use it a lot
even<00:05:25.080> just<00:05:25.470> from<00:05:25.530> one<00:05:25.740> application<00:05:25.889> so<00:05:26.460> it's

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 
even just from one application so it's

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:29.300 
even just from one application so it's
kind<00:05:26.730> of<00:05:26.760> expensive<00:05:27.440> and<00:05:28.440> it<00:05:28.530> kind<00:05:28.740> of<00:05:28.800> reminds

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.310 
kind of expensive and it kind of reminds

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.550 
kind of expensive and it kind of reminds
me<00:05:29.400> of<00:05:29.520> the<00:05:30.120> lovely<00:05:30.660> color<00:05:30.870> that<00:05:31.020> I<00:05:31.110> like<00:05:31.320> and

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.560 
me of the lovely color that I like and

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.980 
me of the lovely color that I like and
the<00:05:31.830> kalaya<00:05:32.070> like<00:05:32.310> is<00:05:32.520> much<00:05:32.730> less<00:05:32.940> so<00:05:33.210> I'm<00:05:33.750> just

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:33.990 
the kalaya like is much less so I'm just

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:35.600 
the kalaya like is much less so I'm just
using<00:05:34.139> the<00:05:34.320> one<00:05:34.470> is<00:05:34.590> almost<00:05:34.710> finish<00:05:35.130> the<00:05:35.340> clear

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:35.610 
using the one is almost finish the clear

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:50.660 
using the one is almost finish the clear
almost<00:05:36.090> clear<00:05:36.360> going<00:05:36.600> on<00:05:36.750> top

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:50.670 

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:52.430 

now<00:05:51.270> what<00:05:51.420> I<00:05:51.450> like<00:05:51.660> about<00:05:51.690> this<00:05:52.050> is<00:05:52.110> that<00:05:52.260> it

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:52.440 
now what I like about this is that it

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.150 
now what I like about this is that it
doesn't<00:05:52.710> transfer<00:05:53.390> um<00:05:54.680> so<00:05:55.680> like<00:05:55.800> I<00:05:55.920> said<00:05:55.980> it

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:56.160 
doesn't transfer um so like I said it

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.160 
doesn't transfer um so like I said it
has<00:05:56.310> to<00:05:56.340> whatever<00:05:56.760> you<00:05:56.940> do<00:05:57.240> to<00:05:57.420> put<00:05:57.600> it<00:05:57.690> on<00:05:57.810> just

00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:58.170 
has to whatever you do to put it on just

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:00.380 
has to whatever you do to put it on just
make<00:05:58.320> sure<00:05:58.350> it<00:05:58.560> is<00:05:58.620> applied<00:05:59.430> exactly<00:06:00.150> the<00:06:00.270> way

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:00.390 
make sure it is applied exactly the way

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:01.850 
make sure it is applied exactly the way
you<00:06:00.450> wanted<00:06:00.720> to<00:06:00.870> appear<00:06:01.230> because<00:06:01.440> it's<00:06:01.740> going

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:01.860 
you wanted to appear because it's going

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:05.720 
you wanted to appear because it's going
to<00:06:01.980> stay<00:06:02.190> in<00:06:02.220> place<00:06:02.900> um<00:06:04.400> so<00:06:05.400> this<00:06:05.490> what<00:06:05.640> it

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:05.730 
to stay in place um so this what it

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:09.680 
to stay in place um so this what it
looks<00:06:05.880> like<00:06:06.090> it<00:06:06.450> does<00:06:07.050> remind<00:06:07.350> me<00:06:07.530> of<00:06:08.690> this

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:09.690 
looks like it does remind me of this

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:12.050 
looks like it does remind me of this
lovely<00:06:10.170> color<00:06:10.380> but<00:06:10.830> this<00:06:10.980> one<00:06:11.130> is<00:06:11.250> more<00:06:11.460> purple

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:12.060 
lovely color but this one is more purple

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:15.220 
lovely color but this one is more purple
here<00:06:12.660> and<00:06:12.870> this<00:06:13.380> one<00:06:13.590> has<00:06:13.800> more<00:06:14.280> like<00:06:14.670> a

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:15.230 
here and this one has more like a

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:17.930 
here and this one has more like a
another<00:06:16.230> took<00:06:16.470> more<00:06:16.710> of<00:06:16.740> a<00:06:16.980> future<00:06:17.370> future

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:17.940 
another took more of a future future

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:22.480 
another took more of a future future
reddish<00:06:18.540> kind<00:06:18.960> but<00:06:19.920> so<00:06:20.070> the<00:06:20.190> way<00:06:20.310> looks<00:06:20.550> like<00:06:20.730> I

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:22.490 
reddish kind but so the way looks like I

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:25.610 
reddish kind but so the way looks like I
like<00:06:23.490> it<00:06:23.730> but<00:06:24.120> it's<00:06:24.690> nineteen<00:06:25.140> dollars<00:06:25.260> and

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:25.620 
like it but it's nineteen dollars and

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:26.900 
like it but it's nineteen dollars and
you<00:06:25.710> have<00:06:25.830> to<00:06:25.950> apply<00:06:26.160> an<00:06:26.340> additional<00:06:26.790> lip

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:26.910 
you have to apply an additional lip

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:29.030 
you have to apply an additional lip
gloss<00:06:27.120> on<00:06:27.300> top<00:06:27.330> of<00:06:27.630> it<00:06:27.780> and<00:06:27.930> the<00:06:28.500> process<00:06:28.920> is

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:29.040 
gloss on top of it and the process is

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:31.610 
gloss on top of it and the process is
kind<00:06:29.280> of<00:06:29.430> too<00:06:29.700> tricky<00:06:29.910> so<00:06:30.240> I<00:06:30.270> can't<00:06:30.570> imagine<00:06:30.690> if

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:31.620 
kind of too tricky so I can't imagine if

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:34.370 
kind of too tricky so I can't imagine if
I'm<00:06:31.740> going<00:06:31.950> out<00:06:32.810> and<00:06:33.810> I<00:06:33.930> just<00:06:34.080> want<00:06:34.230> something

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:37.320 
to put on as easy this is probably not

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:40.040 
to put on as easy this is probably not
that<00:06:37.620> thing<00:06:37.920> or<00:06:38.430> I'd<00:06:39.210> have<00:06:39.240> to<00:06:39.480> have<00:06:39.720> to<00:06:39.870> bring
