IMI<00:01:02.050> Motorsports<00:01:03.150> backwards<00:01:04.230> there's<00:01:05.230> a

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
IMI Motorsports backwards there's a

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.320 
IMI Motorsports backwards there's a
reason<00:01:05.560> for<00:01:05.680> this<00:01:05.800> but<00:01:06.040> ready<00:01:06.280> um<00:01:06.700> okay

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.330 
reason for this but ready um okay

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:15.450 
reason for this but ready um okay
and<00:01:08.010> three<00:01:09.010> two<00:01:09.580> one<00:01:10.300> go<00:01:13.410> okay<00:01:14.410> so<00:01:15.070> here's<00:01:15.310> our

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
and three two one go okay so here's our

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.300 
and three two one go okay so here's our
reasoning<00:01:16.000> this<00:01:16.750> is<00:01:16.990> a<00:01:17.260> vehicle<00:01:17.650> that<00:01:18.040> a<00:01:18.100> lot

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
reasoning this is a vehicle that a lot

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.190 
reasoning this is a vehicle that a lot
of<00:01:18.430> people<00:01:18.670> are<00:01:18.790> going<00:01:18.940> to<00:01:19.090> take<00:01:19.360> to<00:01:19.540> malls<00:01:19.780> and

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:22.660 
schools it's true and various other

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:24.510 
schools it's true and various other
places<00:01:22.900> like<00:01:23.229> that<00:01:23.290> oh<00:01:23.710> my<00:01:23.950> gosh<00:01:24.160> we've<00:01:24.490> been

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
places like that oh my gosh we've been

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:31.039 
places like that oh my gosh we've been
watching<00:01:24.729> this<00:01:24.970> in<00:01:25.119> the<00:01:25.150> back<00:01:25.390> out<00:01:25.600> camera

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.319 

I'm<00:01:31.590> not<00:01:31.740> going<00:01:31.859> to<00:01:31.920> lie<00:01:32.039> to<00:01:32.070> you<00:01:32.280> I<00:01:32.490> think<00:01:33.030> that

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
I'm not going to lie to you I think that

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.840 
I'm not going to lie to you I think that
at<00:01:33.780> least<00:01:33.810> from<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.320> profile<00:01:34.829> it's<00:01:35.549> not<00:01:35.729> too

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
at least from the profile it's not too

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.539 
at least from the profile it's not too
bad<00:01:36.000> looking<00:01:36.210> it<00:01:36.990> kind<00:01:37.320> of<00:01:37.380> looks<00:01:37.590> like<00:01:37.829> there

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
bad looking it kind of looks like there

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.069 
bad looking it kind of looks like there
was<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:38.700> committee<00:01:39.060> that<00:01:39.149> got<00:01:39.420> together<00:01:39.569> and

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
was a committee that got together and

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.349 
was a committee that got together and
kind<00:01:41.069> of<00:01:41.100> threw<00:01:41.340> pieces<00:01:41.549> up<00:01:41.819> in<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.030> air<00:01:42.179> and

00:01:42.349 --> 00:01:42.359 
kind of threw pieces up in the air and

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:43.669 
kind of threw pieces up in the air and
whatever<00:01:42.479> landed<00:01:42.929> on<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.079> ground<00:01:43.229> first<00:01:43.500> is

00:01:43.669 --> 00:01:43.679 
whatever landed on the ground first is

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:45.559 
whatever landed on the ground first is
like<00:01:43.829> what<00:01:44.340> they<00:01:44.429> decided<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.819> go<00:01:44.939> with<00:01:45.149> the

00:01:45.559 --> 00:01:45.569 
like what they decided to go with the

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:48.380 
like what they decided to go with the
front<00:01:45.810> end<00:01:45.990> is<00:01:46.140> extremely<00:01:46.950> low<00:01:47.159> it's<00:01:47.700> not<00:01:48.090> an

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
front end is extremely low it's not an

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.510 
front end is extremely low it's not an
SUV<00:01:49.259> that<00:01:49.469> you<00:01:49.530> can<00:01:49.709> really<00:01:49.860> take<00:01:50.039> off<00:01:50.219> road

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
SUV that you can really take off road

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.880 
SUV that you can really take off road
I'm<00:01:51.090> sure<00:01:51.149> some<00:01:51.479> people<00:01:51.509> will<00:01:51.840> try<00:01:52.020> it<00:01:52.140> but

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
I'm sure some people will try it but

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.300 
I'm sure some people will try it but
because<00:01:53.700> of<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:54.090> aerodynamic<00:01:54.959> lower<00:01:55.829> balance

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
because of the aerodynamic lower balance

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.270 
because of the aerodynamic lower balance
it<00:01:56.520> is<00:01:56.850> basically<00:01:57.659> very<00:01:57.810> very<00:01:58.380> low<00:01:59.039> to<00:01:59.100> the

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
it is basically very very low to the

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.980 
it is basically very very low to the
ground<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.789> the<00:01:59.880> point<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.240> where<00:02:00.270> even<00:02:00.810> some

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
ground to the point to where even some

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.599 
ground to the point to where even some
driveways<00:02:01.229> you'll<00:02:01.590> scrape<00:02:01.859> on<00:02:02.069> which<00:02:02.280> is<00:02:02.459> an

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:02.609 
driveways you'll scrape on which is an

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:03.889 
driveways you'll scrape on which is an
issue<00:02:02.759> considering<00:02:03.239> that<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.569> rest<00:02:03.720> of<00:02:03.810> the

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
issue considering that the rest of the

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.690 
issue considering that the rest of the
vehicle<00:02:04.259> has<00:02:04.409> pretty<00:02:04.649> good<00:02:04.739> ground<00:02:05.220> plans

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
vehicle has pretty good ground plans

incidentally<00:03:04.370> this<00:03:05.090> is<00:03:05.150> the<00:03:05.420> same<00:03:05.750> motor<00:03:06.080> that

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
incidentally this is the same motor that

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.260 
incidentally this is the same motor that
when<00:03:06.890> we<00:03:07.040> decided<00:03:07.370> we<00:03:07.520> wanted<00:03:07.820> to<00:03:07.940> switch<00:03:08.120> from

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:08.270 
when we decided we wanted to switch from

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:10.300 
when we decided we wanted to switch from
an<00:03:08.450> air-cooled<00:03:08.870> motor<00:03:09.140> to<00:03:09.650> a<00:03:09.680> water-cooled

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
an air-cooled motor to a water-cooled

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.430 
an air-cooled motor to a water-cooled
motor<00:03:10.490> in<00:03:10.700> our<00:03:10.850> Baja<00:03:11.180> Bug<00:03:11.330> down<00:03:11.540> in<00:03:11.660> Mexico<00:03:12.050> we

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
motor in our Baja Bug down in Mexico we

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.650 
motor in our Baja Bug down in Mexico we
went<00:03:12.650> with<00:03:12.740> a<00:03:12.800> 2.4<00:03:13.370> liter<00:03:13.400> Ecotec<00:03:13.880> here's<00:03:14.480> why

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
went with a 2.4 liter Ecotec here's why

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.720 
went with a 2.4 liter Ecotec here's why
because<00:03:15.110> they're<00:03:15.230> indestructible<00:03:15.890> this

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
because they're indestructible this

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.250 
because they're indestructible this
motor<00:03:17.060> is<00:03:17.300> going<00:03:17.510> to<00:03:17.660> be<00:03:17.750> able<00:03:17.840> to<00:03:17.960> get<00:03:18.170> you

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
motor is going to be able to get you

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.840 
motor is going to be able to get you
anywhere<00:03:18.800> that<00:03:18.980> you<00:03:19.100> want<00:03:19.130> to<00:03:19.340> go<00:03:19.400> a<00:03:19.430> lot<00:03:19.790> of

anywhere that you want to go a lot of

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.730 
anywhere that you want to go a lot of
people<00:03:20.030> use<00:03:20.330> them<00:03:20.510> in<00:03:20.600> off-road<00:03:20.930> racing<00:03:21.260> so<00:03:21.470> if

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:21.740 
people use them in off-road racing so if

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:23.830 
people use them in off-road racing so if
it's<00:03:22.190> good<00:03:22.370> enough<00:03:22.400> for<00:03:22.700> the<00:03:22.790> Baja<00:03:23.060> 1000<00:03:23.660> I
