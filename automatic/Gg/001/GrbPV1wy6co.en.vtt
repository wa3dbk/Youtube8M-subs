00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
big like you know the lenses I I used to

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.450 
big like you know the lenses I I used to
wear<00:01:15.659> like<00:01:15.869> clear<00:01:16.110> lenses<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:16.890> then<00:01:17.159> they're

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
wear like clear lenses and then they're

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.330 
wear like clear lenses and then they're
just<00:01:17.729> a<00:01:18.000> lot<00:01:18.960> smaller<00:01:19.320> these<00:01:19.710> are<00:01:19.890> really<00:01:20.009> big

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
just a lot smaller these are really big

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.570 
just a lot smaller these are really big
and<00:01:21.380> for<00:01:22.380> some<00:01:22.590> reason<00:01:22.619> they<00:01:23.040> look<00:01:23.070> more

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
and for some reason they look more

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.719 
and for some reason they look more
grayish<00:01:24.210> green<00:01:24.570> on<00:01:25.439> my<00:01:25.590> eyes<00:01:25.770> I<00:01:26.070> think<00:01:26.340> it's

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
grayish green on my eyes I think it's

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.789 
grayish green on my eyes I think it's
because<00:01:26.970> my<00:01:27.240> eyes<00:01:27.420> are<00:01:27.450> darker<00:01:27.930> but<00:01:28.650> the

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
because my eyes are darker but the

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.530 
because my eyes are darker but the
lenses<00:01:29.130> are<00:01:29.250> really<00:01:29.579> really<00:01:29.790> yellow<00:01:30.299> like

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
bright yellow so um yeah that's probably

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.380
