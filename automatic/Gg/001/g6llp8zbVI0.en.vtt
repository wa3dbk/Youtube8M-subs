the boat holding the cap as you can see

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.429 
the boat holding the cap as you can see
I<00:02:37.060> use<00:02:37.299> a<00:02:37.329> screwdriver<00:02:37.659> to<00:02:37.989> remove<00:02:38.079> the<00:02:38.260> o-ring

00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:38.439

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:41.399 
I use a screwdriver to remove the o-ring
from<00:02:38.680> the<00:02:38.860> cap<00:02:39.040> and<00:02:39.720> the<00:02:40.720> boat<00:02:40.870> itself<00:02:41.200> has

00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:41.409 
from the cap and the boat itself has

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:44.280 
from the cap and the boat itself has
this<00:02:41.620> little<00:02:41.920> one<00:02:42.040> here<00:02:42.220> it's<00:02:43.180> usually<00:02:43.930> pretty

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
this little one here it's usually pretty

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.240 
this little one here it's usually pretty
difficult<00:02:44.650> to<00:02:44.980> get<00:02:45.099> it<00:02:45.250> off<00:02:45.930> normally<00:02:46.930> and<00:02:47.250> so

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
difficult to get it off normally and so

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.360 
difficult to get it off normally and so
you<00:02:48.340> can<00:02:48.489> see<00:02:48.670> here<00:02:49.530> so<00:02:50.530> what<00:02:50.680> I<00:02:50.739> tend<00:02:50.980> to<00:02:51.040> do<00:02:51.220> is

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
you can see here so what I tend to do is

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.309 
you can see here so what I tend to do is
I<00:02:51.549> just<00:02:51.790> cut<00:02:52.239> it<00:02:52.420> since<00:02:52.659> I'm<00:02:52.810> gonna<00:02:52.870> replace<00:02:53.200> it

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319 
I just cut it since I'm gonna replace it

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:58.500 
I just cut it since I'm gonna replace it
anyway<00:02:53.560> just<00:02:56.519> to<00:02:57.519> put<00:02:57.670> it<00:02:57.760> back<00:02:57.849> on<00:02:58.060> it's

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
anyway just to put it back on it's

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.509 
anyway just to put it back on it's
fairly<00:02:58.780> simple<00:02:59.230> we<00:02:59.379> just<00:02:59.530> orient<00:03:00.220> it<00:03:00.310> up<00:03:00.430> a

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
fairly simple we just orient it up a

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:04.009 
fairly simple we just orient it up a
little<00:03:00.670> bit<00:03:00.849> and<00:03:01.440> roll<00:03:02.440> it<00:03:02.620> over<00:03:02.709> the<00:03:03.010> boat

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
little bit and roll it over the boat

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:09.890 
little bit and roll it over the boat
make<00:03:05.019> sure<00:03:05.139> you<00:03:05.230> get<00:03:05.349> all<00:03:05.650> around<00:03:06.099> it

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.149 

same<00:03:10.900> thing<00:03:11.049> goes<00:03:11.230> with<00:03:11.409> a<00:03:11.470> big<00:03:11.680> old<00:03:11.859> room<00:03:12.010> for

00:03:12.149 --> 00:03:12.159 
same thing goes with a big old room for

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:14.190 
same thing goes with a big old room for
the<00:03:12.250> cap<00:03:12.459> I<00:03:12.760> like<00:03:13.510> to<00:03:13.629> dab<00:03:13.780> a<00:03:13.810> little<00:03:13.900> bit<00:03:14.109> of

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200

finish tightening it up I don't like to
go<00:04:47.699> too<00:04:47.909> tight<00:04:48.060> because<00:04:48.240> the<00:04:48.449> threads<00:04:48.659> are

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
go too tight because the threads are

00:04:48.750 --> 00:05:13.219 
go too tight because the threads are
pretty<00:04:48.930> fine<00:05:11.270> we<00:05:12.270> go<00:05:12.389> back<00:05:12.599> to<00:05:12.750> the<00:05:12.840> bottom<00:05:13.080> of

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:13.229 
pretty fine we go back to the bottom of

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:14.779 
pretty fine we go back to the bottom of
the<00:05:13.289> car<00:05:13.500> where<00:05:13.770> I'm<00:05:13.889> going<00:05:14.129> to<00:05:14.280> replace<00:05:14.550> my

00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:14.789 
the car where I'm going to replace my

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:17.240 
the car where I'm going to replace my
drain<00:05:15.000> plug<00:05:15.240> in<00:05:15.389> washing<00:05:15.870> the<00:05:16.620> old<00:05:16.800> one<00:05:17.009> I<00:05:17.039> had

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:17.250 
drain plug in washing the old one I had

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:18.950 
drain plug in washing the old one I had
was<00:05:17.400> pretty<00:05:17.639> beat-up<00:05:17.909> so<00:05:18.270> I'm<00:05:18.389> gonna<00:05:18.569> replace

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 
was pretty beat-up so I'm gonna replace

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.439 
was pretty beat-up so I'm gonna replace
it<00:05:19.020> and<00:05:19.469> it's<00:05:20.280> good<00:05:20.430> practice<00:05:20.550> to<00:05:20.819> replace<00:05:21.240> it

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:21.449 
it and it's good practice to replace it

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:25.070 
it and it's good practice to replace it
every<00:05:22.289> once<00:05:22.469> in<00:05:22.620> a<00:05:22.710> while<00:05:23.479> it<00:05:24.479> goes<00:05:24.599> back<00:05:24.870> on

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080 
every once in a while it goes back on

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.559 
every once in a while it goes back on
the<00:05:25.349> same<00:05:25.560> way<00:05:25.620> you<00:05:25.800> took<00:05:25.979> it<00:05:26.129> off<00:05:26.300> but<00:05:27.300> I<00:05:27.330> like

00:05:27.559 --> 00:05:27.569 
the same way you took it off but I like

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:29.119 
the same way you took it off but I like
to<00:05:27.690> clean<00:05:27.930> the<00:05:28.050> surrounding<00:05:28.409> areas<00:05:28.740> before<00:05:29.099> I

00:05:29.119 --> 00:05:29.129 
to clean the surrounding areas before I

00:05:29.129 --> 00:06:11.339 
to clean the surrounding areas before I
put<00:05:29.340> it<00:05:29.430> back<00:05:29.460> in

00:06:11.339 --> 00:06:11.349 

00:06:11.349 --> 00:06:13.629 

once<00:06:12.349> that's<00:06:12.530> on<00:06:12.650> and<00:06:12.830> tight<00:06:12.979> we<00:06:13.129> move<00:06:13.340> up<00:06:13.460> to

00:06:13.629 --> 00:06:13.639 
once that's on and tight we move up to

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:15.369 
once that's on and tight we move up to
the<00:06:13.729> top<00:06:13.910> of<00:06:14.240> the<00:06:14.330> car<00:06:14.509> where<00:06:15.199> we're<00:06:15.319> gonna

00:06:15.369 --> 00:06:15.379 
the top of the car where we're gonna

00:06:15.379 --> 00:06:21.909 
the top of the car where we're gonna
fill<00:06:15.680> the<00:06:15.770> oil<00:06:20.199> now<00:06:21.199> this<00:06:21.349> particular<00:06:21.500> engine

00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:21.919 
fill the oil now this particular engine

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:24.100 
fill the oil now this particular engine
takes<00:06:22.340> about<00:06:22.490> four<00:06:22.879> quarts<00:06:23.300> of<00:06:23.389> oil<00:06:23.569> but<00:06:23.990> you

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:24.110 
takes about four quarts of oil but you

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:25.869 
takes about four quarts of oil but you
might<00:06:24.289> need<00:06:24.470> a<00:06:24.530> little<00:06:24.860> bit<00:06:24.949> more<00:06:25.129> just<00:06:25.639> to<00:06:25.729> be

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:49.130 
time then put it back in you get a more

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:50.020 
time then put it back in you get a more
accurate<00:06:49.310> reading

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:50.030 
accurate reading

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:51.850 
accurate reading
should<00:06:50.810> be<00:06:50.930> somewhere<00:06:51.199> between<00:06:51.380> the<00:06:51.680> two

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:51.860
