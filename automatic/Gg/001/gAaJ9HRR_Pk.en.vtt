00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
walked out into the hotel when they were

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.120 
walked out into the hotel when they were
checking<00:05:06.360> the<00:05:06.450> tape<00:05:06.630> and<00:05:06.750> he's<00:05:06.870> like<00:05:07.050> yeah<00:05:07.260> my

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
checking the tape and he's like yeah my

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:09.770 
checking the tape and he's like yeah my
knee<00:05:08.190> is<00:05:08.400> really<00:05:08.550> bloody<00:05:08.940> so<00:05:09.240> that<00:05:09.480> way<00:05:09.600> they

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 
knee is really bloody so that way they

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.420 
knee is really bloody so that way they
figured<00:05:10.230> that<00:05:10.410> the<00:05:10.530> tape<00:05:10.860> broke<00:05:11.070> from<00:05:11.250> that

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
figured that the tape broke from that

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.580 
figured that the tape broke from that
instead<00:05:11.880> of<00:05:11.940> my<00:05:12.060> friends<00:05:12.510> breaking<00:05:13.350> it<00:05:13.470> when

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.590 
instead of my friends breaking it when
