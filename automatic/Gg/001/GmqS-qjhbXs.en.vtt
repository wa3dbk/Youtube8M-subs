it<00:00:51.360> sounds<00:00:51.840> like<00:00:52.020> it<00:00:52.140> would<00:00:52.199> be<00:00:52.320> kind<00:00:52.620> of

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
it sounds like it would be kind of

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.860 
it sounds like it would be kind of
garish<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.399> really<00:00:54.030> all<00:00:54.180> looking<00:00:54.629> they

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
actually came across really beautiful so

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.279 
actually came across really beautiful so
my<00:00:56.699> number<00:00:56.969> four<00:00:57.149> trend<00:00:57.390> is<00:00:57.480> called<00:00:57.660> full<00:00:57.989> face

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
my number four trend is called full face

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.959 
my number four trend is called full face
tattoos<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:59.190> I<00:00:59.280> guess<00:00:59.430> it's<00:00:59.609> on<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.820> very

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
tattoos and I guess it's on the very

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.700 
tattoos and I guess it's on the very
opposite<00:01:00.539> scale<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.260> more<00:01:01.440> delicate

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
opposite scale of the more delicate

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.210 
opposite scale of the more delicate
designs<00:01:02.579> so<00:01:03.329> this<00:01:04.199> is<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.470> cently<00:01:04.680> is<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:04.949> guy<00:01:05.159> who

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
designs so this is a cently is a guy who

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.420 
designs so this is a cently is a guy who
got<00:01:05.780> sort<00:01:06.780> of<00:01:06.840> like<00:01:06.990> an<00:01:07.140> iron<00:01:07.350> mask<00:01:07.799> tattooed

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
got sort of like an iron mask tattooed

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.750 
got sort of like an iron mask tattooed
on<00:01:08.580> his<00:01:08.700> face<00:01:08.850> so<00:01:09.119> it<00:01:09.270> goes<00:01:09.510> all<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.869> way<00:01:10.760> past

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
on his face so it goes all the way past

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.539 
on his face so it goes all the way past
his<00:01:11.970> head<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.510> it<00:01:12.600> goes<00:01:12.630> around<00:01:13.590> his<00:01:13.890> eyes<00:01:14.100> so

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
his head and it goes around his eyes so

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.520

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
and it's all blacked out so it's very

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.100 
and it's all blacked out so it's very
dramatic<00:01:17.270> you<00:01:18.270> would<00:01:18.420> really<00:01:18.600> need<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:18.990> be
