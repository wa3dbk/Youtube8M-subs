00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:05.440
 good morning let's explain to him that 

00:00:02.889 --> 00:00:07.510
 contains a cctv kit that are 

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.370
 closed circuits on television 

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:12.430
 the kits contain a duty that is the 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:14.620
 equipment where the cameras record the kit 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:17.859
 which is differentiated by the amount of 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:21.429
 channels is 4 has channels 8 

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:23.499
 channels and 16 channels each channel 

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:26.529
 represents a camera this is a kit 

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:28.720
 16 channels that you have installed in these 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:30.519
 moments only 10 cameras we can see that 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:35.019
 they are connected up to 10 cameras 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:37.300
 Each kit comes with its sources for a 

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:40.570
 for each camera comes with hard drive 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:43.539
 usually and it comes with the cap with the 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.609
 cables the cables are what are called 

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:47.920
 Siamese cables are already pre cables 

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:50.890
 factory assemblies that already come with the 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:54.550
 connectors power or energy and 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:56.859
 of video ok if you need these cables 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.310
 they measure approximately 15 meters each 

00:00:56.859 --> 00:01:02.300
 rollito for each camera 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:05.220
 if you need to lengthen it or put 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:08.370
 more distant cameras can use cable 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.080
 Coaxial that is 100% compatible or balance 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:13.860
 what are these devices that are 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:17.880
 here where you connect directly 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:20.910
 a camera and its electrical part yes and what 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:24.020
 what you do is that the interconnected with 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:26.240
 a network cable ok 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.270
 the ball support is 100 meters with 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.670
 category 5 network cable and the kits that 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.679
 we distribute support any 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.240
 type of cameras to cameras pt zetas 

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:38.810
 which are the ones that can be moved with a 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.909
 joystick and obviously those that 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.950
 come with cameras of this type are 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:45.020
 cameras that are considered day and night 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.020
 so they are infrared you can see 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.149
 there the LEDs and the amount of LED read the 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.000
 distance are also cameras for 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:55.450
 outside or they support the interperience and 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.450
 Water 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.990
 ok our kits also come with 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.060
 white ports network port that this 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.009
 port here imports a network that 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.650
 port is used to connect to the 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:08.030
 duty network and in this way 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.920
 share it on the internet and see the 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.459
 recordings from the internet using a 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.830
 computer or a cell phone is a 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:19.280
 Android or an additional iphone our 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:21.050
 kits have audio ports that is for 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.480
 can connect microphones of this 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:27.430
 way you can associate a microphone to 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.430
 one to one camera 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.650
 the duty menus are super simple 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.270
 it's very friendly you here you have the part 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.530
 of the network configuration where in this 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.950
 case I have it with a configuration 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.810
 static if you also have the way 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.260
 how do you want it to be displayed in the 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:47.570
 cameras if you want them to show 44 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.730
 of 88 obviously that depends on the 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:53.600
 number of channels you also have the 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:56.990
 part of the hard drive if where you put this 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.910
 you have to format the hard disk 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:01.100
 inside the duty so that he has his 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.080
 system file is very interest very 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.210
 important the size of the hard disk of 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:08.600
 baby since that's the time it's going to 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:11.060
 record the dvr with the cameras that you 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:14.870
 you are installing the relationship is that each 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:18.260
 four cameras with 500 gigas you go to 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:20.810
 record a month with eight cameras and a 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:24.410
 unter disk you are going to record equally 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:27.890
 a month and that's the proportion ok the dvr 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:29.900
 in your menu you have multiple options per 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.880
 example the accesses per user you 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.080
 you can finish that a user only 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.450
 there may be the cameras 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.250
 for example manipulate them change the 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.470
 configuration or suchlike 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.630
 many of the duties have the option 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:44.750
 of alarms which make you a 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:46.790
 shot before a motion sensor by 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.710
 example you determine an area here you 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.620
 can notify by mail what is 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:52.870
 happening 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.060
 you have the backup option which is 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:59.830
 very important because your backs via 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:02.200
 usb either on a pendrive or on a disk 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:06.180
 external hard the time you need to see 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.180
 of the event happened
