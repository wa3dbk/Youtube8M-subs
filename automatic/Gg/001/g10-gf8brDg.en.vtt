00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:09.490
 peter wk 

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:21.060
 chapter 23 boeing derby next 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.900
 work better tomorrow exchanged a 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.580
 good sign 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.470
 I pull myself out of bed and go 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.939
 down to the kitchen already 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.610
 first aid kit in hand and 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.380
 all emergency numbers in the head against 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.329
 my expectations, however, lola has in 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.820
 the kitchen no second texas chainsaw 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.590
 massacre is hosting instead 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.510
 Derby in the midst of a pile of heap star 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.630
 and sees me with big squinting 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.420
 eyes on 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:46.230
 Something went wrong 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.600
 strangely, i can help the little one 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.640
 Blond bangs just do not be angry 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.500
 Rather mild and mild, instead 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.510
 help her pick up the pieces 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.650
 the derby slips several times and 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.500
 the little mess still on 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.970
 spreading disturbs me little now 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.270
 Luna finally seems to be awake 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:05.369
 and trots sleepily into the kitchen 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:08.280
 People like you have to go in the morning 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.350
 I can make you such a noise 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.470
 Remember my favorite roommate 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.570
 that you have been the me since the day 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:19.460
 the collection with unnecessary every morning 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.110
 loud music has been right yes 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:26.270
 what do you even have in the kitchen 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:28.880
 made derby i wanted for that 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.130
 show that you can see me without 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.530
 Last and there I thought I'm doing 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.600
 Breakfast for you and when I then the 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.759
 I wanted to cover my table 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.100
 feet stumbled 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:43.009
 you are over your own hooves 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.710
 stumbled derby turns red and sees 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:49.390
 embarrassed to the ground 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.390
 and what happened to the breakfast? 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:57.200
 see yourself moment rp and gives the view 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.119
 on the hearth plate is free there 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.450
 in the middle of the hearth plate an extremely 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:04.310
 strange thing that is not just strange 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.070
 There are noises but also in 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.259
 every one of the sentence lives on 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:12.739
 new meaning exists 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:14.120
 What in the world should we do 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:15.769
 send to a lab 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.610
 I think you have a new species 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:22.250
 created yes I wanted you to succeed 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.019
 but then it went on also took 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.269
 I tried to extinguish the fire 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:28.959
 but the more expect juicy on the 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:30.860
 earthly tab the more burned it is 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:34.760
 we do not just have that 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:37.220
 orange juice in the house I go because 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.750
 Dispose of it in ten minutes 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.480
 I'm back alarmed the 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:44.110
 homeland security authority then I am 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.280
 presumably the hero's death died 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.049
 after we have the mess in the kitchen 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.579
 then finally cleaned up and halfway 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:51.110
 Edible breakfast from the 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:53.329
 conjured up surviving foods 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.650
 we sit together at table and 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:55.450
 try an entertainment in swing 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.010
 bring to 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.829
 now looks like we have something else 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:05.090
 found what I do not control 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:06.049
 Conversation say Derby I want the 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.760
 continue question 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:10.160
 However, he realized that I was not like that 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.600
 have planned far an unpleasant break 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.400
 but then it arises 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.670
 luckily interrupted by luna 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.570
 becomes 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.980
 have you always targeted luna what that 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.480
 is not to be overlooked why should 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.900
 to make a secret of it 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.930
 the bbi just smiles okay i did 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.940
 always played since my birth 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:31.070
 Something went wrong 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.700
 but I can not complain 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:35.489
 twice as many parents are 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:38.610
 also something nice again 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:42.090
 Silent silence and have you 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:58.440
 read any hobbies or so happy 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:04:00.090
 looks at me questioningly and smiles mildly 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:09.930
 then she gets up and walks in direction 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:12.959
 door for a while reigned then calls 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:17.870
 Derby should once again in the living room 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:17.870
 I'll go we'll both look the same 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:25.880
 okay the bi closes your eyes 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.880
 start and crashed against the wall 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:31.960
 i think that will be a long day for 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.960
 you 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.260
 Two hours later derby trots again 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.210
 through the door 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.190
 This time she caught the first 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.139
 Right and walk in the direction 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:46.030
 living room 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:48.760
 hey baby and how did the job search not work 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:49.830
 she mumbles so well and examines the 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.690
 controller of the ps3 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.130
 after several tries she gives up and 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:58.810
 put him down are back 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:05:00.460
 why that well I thought I should 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.440
 go to the post office 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.540
 I'm also friendly 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.400
 there are even two boys 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:08.710
 men i think they were twins 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:11.020
 come and have both of me 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:12.520
 doors identified as I not the 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:16.600
 I wanted to disappoint both 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:19.780
 just stayed outside and that's it 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:22.780
 in about and what do you have then 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:25.720
 remaining two hours 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:28.060
 that's the best part about it. I'm mine 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:30.610
 but befriended one of them 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.540
 really nice but unfortunately they had none 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:32.979
 free 

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:35.200
 After that we have a while 

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:39.250
 entertained and I believe we understand 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:43.660

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:45.880
 because asks luna and smiles dieter med 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:50.350
 how is your job search now ? 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:50.979
 Next I will continue tomorrow 

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:52.870
 look 

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:54.789
 but now I have to get ready 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:57.539
 Dieter picks me up this evening 

00:05:54.789 --> 00:06:03.130
 be a wave with tinted slices 

00:05:57.539 --> 00:06:05.229
 no, why is it? 

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:08.110
 no matter we see you later okay 

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:10.780
 people will show that 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:12.400
 a little later it rings at the door as 

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:14.169
 I open a young lad 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:16.120
 blond short hair and one 

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:20.560
 charming smile because in hand a 

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:21.760
 bouquet if i am right here i 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.710
 can not answer because I 

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.639
 I am busy with the boy in the 

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:26.200
 to hit the door 

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:28.690
 when I spoke my language 

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:30.639
 I have found derby again 

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:32.830
 comes after five minutes the stairs 

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:35.050
 galloping down smiles and 

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:37.510
 Then, with a smile, arm disappears into arm 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:39.820
 Dieter a damn good-looking 

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:42.430
 blond guys whom they look up to 

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:43.360
 I laughed at a post office 

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:45.400
 following the two 

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:47.680
 then shake your head and sit down 

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:49.750
 next to luna on the sofa would never have thought 

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:51.699
 the derby of us as the first date 

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:55.090
 and already on her second 

00:06:51.699 --> 00:06:56.860
 evening with luna shaking his head and 

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:59.169
 while we both sit alone at home 

00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:00.970
 and hard thinking is clear to me 

00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:01.780
 that we derby still a lot 

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:04.570
 be able to learn 

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:05.500
 she may not be genius and 

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:08.080
 not very good 

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:10.300
 but after all, the real one has 

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:13.650
 Things learned in life you just have to 

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:13.650
 set priorities
