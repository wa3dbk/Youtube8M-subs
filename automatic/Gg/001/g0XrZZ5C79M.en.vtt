00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:16.189 
the end of this video first I'm going to

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:18.330 
the end of this video first I'm going to
start<00:00:16.460> off<00:00:16.550> with<00:00:16.580> the<00:00:17.060> little<00:00:17.330> patch<00:00:17.480> of<00:00:17.509> Holly

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:18.340 
start off with the little patch of Holly

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.900 
start off with the little patch of Holly
near<00:00:19.340> the<00:00:19.520> corner<00:00:19.970> of<00:00:20.000> the<00:00:20.449> cup<00:00:21.609> so<00:00:22.609> I'll<00:00:22.699> start

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:22.910 
near the corner of the cup so I'll start

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.630 
near the corner of the cup so I'll start
with<00:00:22.970> one<00:00:23.269> little<00:00:23.420> circle<00:00:24.430> it's<00:00:25.430> another

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:25.640 
with one little circle it's another

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:32.560 
with one little circle it's another
circle<00:00:26.119> and<00:00:27.220> a<00:00:28.220> third<00:00:28.460> one<00:00:28.670> on<00:00:28.820> top<00:00:29.000> there<00:00:31.570> to

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
circle and a third one on top there to

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.009 
circle and a third one on top there to
make<00:00:32.750> them<00:00:32.900> look<00:00:33.050> shiny<00:00:33.470> I'm<00:00:34.210> adding<00:00:35.210> these

00:00:36.009 --> 00:00:36.019 
make them look shiny I'm adding these

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:39.180 
make them look shiny I'm adding these
little<00:00:36.190> smaller<00:00:37.190> circles<00:00:37.699> to<00:00:37.790> the<00:00:37.820> side<00:00:38.059> and

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.190 
little smaller circles to the side and

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:40.750 
little smaller circles to the side and
for<00:00:40.190> a<00:00:40.220> leaf

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
for a leaf

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:46.600 
for a leaf
I'll<00:00:41.120> draw<00:00:41.449> one<00:00:41.479> curve<00:00:44.920> and<00:00:45.920> then<00:00:46.190> I'll<00:00:46.339> draw

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:46.610 
I'll draw one curve and then I'll draw

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.820 
I'll draw one curve and then I'll draw
these<00:00:48.400> little<00:00:49.400> lines<00:00:49.640> to<00:00:50.299> form<00:00:50.659> the<00:00:51.140> rest<00:00:51.500> of

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:51.830 
these little lines to form the rest of

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:58.130 
these little lines to form the rest of
the<00:00:52.010> leaf<00:00:54.100> it's<00:00:55.100> a<00:00:55.159> baseline<00:00:55.580> curving<00:00:56.000> out

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
the leaf it's a baseline curving out

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.110 
the leaf it's a baseline curving out
repeating<00:00:58.620> those<00:00:58.770> curves<00:00:59.130> all<00:00:59.550> the<00:01:00.000> way

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
repeating those curves all the way

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:12.410 
repeating those curves all the way
around<00:01:02.030> until<00:01:03.030> we<00:01:03.750> have<00:01:03.930> it<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:11.210> drill<00:01:12.210> one

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
around until we have it to drill one

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.820 
around until we have it to drill one
more<00:01:12.630> leaf<00:01:14.180> so<00:01:15.180> once<00:01:15.360> we<00:01:15.510> have<00:01:15.690> that<00:01:15.900> I'll<00:01:16.380> draw

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
more leaf so once we have that I'll draw

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.960 
more leaf so once we have that I'll draw
a<00:01:17.010> big<00:01:17.280> curve<00:01:18.920> so<00:01:19.920> this<00:01:20.130> is<00:01:20.280> going<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.580> be<00:01:20.700> the

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
a big curve so this is going to be the

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:29.390 
a big curve so this is going to be the
brim<00:01:21.780> of<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.500> cup<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:27.890> to<00:01:28.890> start<00:01:29.250> the

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
brim of the cup and to start the

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.940 
brim of the cup and to start the
marshmallows<00:01:30.150> off

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
marshmallows off

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.870 
marshmallows off
I'll<00:01:31.950> draw<00:01:32.400> three<00:01:32.729> really<00:01:33.119> skinny<00:01:33.390> ovals<00:01:34.880> with

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
I'll draw three really skinny ovals with

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.499 
I'll draw three really skinny ovals with
very<00:01:36.570> short<00:01:37.110> lines<00:01:38.040> coming<00:01:38.460> down<00:01:38.580> for<00:01:39.360> each

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
very short lines coming down for each

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.649 
very short lines coming down for each
one

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:43.659 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:48.440 

and<00:01:44.049> then<00:01:44.469> a<00:01:44.500> curved<00:01:44.890> line

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.940 

so<00:01:49.450> these<00:01:49.600> little<00:01:50.140> marshmallows<00:01:50.710> are<00:01:50.800> going

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
so these little marshmallows are going

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.590 
so these little marshmallows are going
to<00:01:51.010> be<00:01:51.070> floating<00:01:51.430> on<00:01:51.700> top<00:01:51.730> of<00:01:52.000> the<00:01:52.420> hot

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
to be floating on top of the hot

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.840 
to be floating on top of the hot
chocolate<00:01:55.140> I'll<00:01:56.140> draw<00:01:56.470> another<00:01:56.500> line<00:01:56.850> curved

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
chocolate I'll draw another line curved

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.800 
chocolate I'll draw another line curved
line<00:01:58.120> coming<00:01:58.960> around<00:01:59.290> and<00:01:59.530> from<00:02:00.430> behind<00:02:00.810> the

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
line coming around and from behind the

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.160 
line coming around and from behind the
little<00:02:02.050> marshmallows<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:04.810> I'm<00:02:05.020> drawing

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
little marshmallows and I'm drawing

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.660 
little marshmallows and I'm drawing
these<00:02:05.350> little<00:02:05.560> ripples<00:02:05.860> inside<00:02:06.220> the<00:02:06.550> hot

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
these little ripples inside the hot

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.580 
these little ripples inside the hot
chocolate

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.490 

okay<00:02:11.590> one<00:02:11.920> more<00:02:12.130> line<00:02:12.340> to<00:02:12.520> finish<00:02:12.790> up<00:02:12.970> the

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
okay one more line to finish up the

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.790 
okay one more line to finish up the
outer<00:02:14.500> part<00:02:14.950> of<00:02:15.160> the<00:02:15.550> cup<00:02:15.870> and<00:02:16.870> let's<00:02:17.290> go<00:02:17.500> down

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
outer part of the cup and let's go down

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:24.540 
outer part of the cup and let's go down
to<00:02:18.280> form<00:02:18.580> the<00:02:18.700> body<00:02:22.710> so<00:02:23.710> the<00:02:23.830> body<00:02:23.860> of<00:02:24.190> the<00:02:24.370> cup

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550

okay so once we have this I done I'll go
into<00:03:35.130> this<00:03:35.310> side<00:03:35.610> but<00:03:35.940> instead<00:03:36.240> of<00:03:36.300> drawing

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
into this side but instead of drawing
