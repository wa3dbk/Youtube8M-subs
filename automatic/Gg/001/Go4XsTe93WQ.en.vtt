00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
on the home screen but I would say just

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.870 
on the home screen but I would say just
restricted<00:03:12.570> don't<00:03:12.840> go<00:03:13.050> bonkers<00:03:13.490> because<00:03:14.490> the

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
restricted don't go bonkers because the

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.180 
restricted don't go bonkers because the
phone<00:03:15.090> hardware<00:03:15.510> is<00:03:15.780> not<00:03:16.020> very<00:03:16.380> powerful<00:03:16.920> and

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
phone hardware is not very powerful and

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.820 
phone hardware is not very powerful and
it<00:03:17.489> has<00:03:17.610> just<00:03:17.820> limited<00:03:18.180> amount<00:03:18.420> of<00:03:18.510> RAM<00:03:18.840> so

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
it has just limited amount of RAM so

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.250 
it has just limited amount of RAM so
that's<00:03:20.070> how<00:03:20.220> you<00:03:20.280> install<00:03:20.640> visits<00:03:21.300> you<00:03:22.110> can

thing<00:07:02.590> that<00:07:02.800> I<00:07:03.130> would<00:07:03.370> say<00:07:03.640> is<00:07:03.880> that<00:07:03.910> if<00:07:04.450> you

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:04.480 
thing that I would say is that if you

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.270 
thing that I would say is that if you
are<00:07:04.810> going<00:07:05.110> to<00:07:05.230> buy<00:07:05.350> this<00:07:05.410> phone<00:07:05.740> and<00:07:05.920> use<00:07:06.040> it

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:10.180 
it's a good idea to install this

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:12.480 
it's a good idea to install this
advanced<00:07:10.660> task<00:07:11.110> manager<00:07:11.830> or<00:07:11.860> a<00:07:12.010> task<00:07:12.340> killer

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:12.490 
advanced task manager or a task killer

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:14.550 
advanced task manager or a task killer
