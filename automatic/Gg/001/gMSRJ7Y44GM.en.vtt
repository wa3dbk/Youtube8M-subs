be using a Wi-Fi also compared to their

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:53.060 
are 30 and I guess our 32 those I looked

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:54.370 
are 30 and I guess our 32 those I looked
at<00:05:53.240> went<00:05:53.540> to<00:05:53.630> the<00:05:53.720> store<00:05:53.960> wasn't<00:05:54.320> that

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:54.380 
at went to the store wasn't that

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:55.750 
at went to the store wasn't that
impressed<00:05:54.680> with<00:05:54.830> the<00:05:54.950> zoom<00:05:55.160> even<00:05:55.370> though<00:05:55.640> it's

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:55.760 
impressed with the zoom even though it's

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:57.730 
impressed with the zoom even though it's
a<00:05:55.850> lot<00:05:56.000> more<00:05:56.210> than<00:05:56.450> the<00:05:56.600> zoom<00:05:56.810> on<00:05:57.260> this<00:05:57.530> guy

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:57.740 
a lot more than the zoom on this guy

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:59.980 
a lot more than the zoom on this guy
here<00:05:58.070> has<00:05:58.370> a<00:05:58.430> looming<00:05:59.090> more<00:05:59.510> like<00:05:59.660> for<00:05:59.900> these

00:05:59.980 --> 00:05:59.990 
here has a looming more like for these

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:03.760 
here has a looming more like for these
older<00:06:00.860> ones<00:06:01.660> soon<00:06:02.660> but<00:06:03.380> it<00:06:03.470> wasn't<00:06:03.710> that

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:03.770 
older ones soon but it wasn't that

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:05.290 
older ones soon but it wasn't that
impressed<00:06:04.130> it<00:06:04.280> was<00:06:04.370> kind<00:06:04.550> of<00:06:04.610> grainy<00:06:04.850> not<00:06:05.120> so

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:05.300 
impressed it was kind of grainy not so

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:09.430 
impressed it was kind of grainy not so
clear<00:06:05.570> and<00:06:05.690> sharp<00:06:05.930> and<00:06:06.400> it<00:06:07.400> also<00:06:08.140> the<00:06:09.140> battery

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:09.440 
clear and sharp and it also the battery

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:10.900 
clear and sharp and it also the battery
life<00:06:09.650> once<00:06:09.890> I<00:06:10.010> read<00:06:10.160> about<00:06:10.250> the<00:06:10.430> battery<00:06:10.700> life

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:10.910 
life once I read about the battery life

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:13.000 
life once I read about the battery life
I<00:06:11.090> definitely<00:06:11.570> decided<00:06:11.720> against<00:06:12.350> our<00:06:12.560> series

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:13.010 
I definitely decided against our series

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:16.060 
I definitely decided against our series
because<00:06:13.400> the<00:06:13.610> battery<00:06:13.880> life<00:06:14.260> typically<00:06:15.260> will

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:16.070 
because the battery life typically will

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:18.910 
because the battery life typically will
get<00:06:16.190> you<00:06:16.370> 20<00:06:16.700> to<00:06:16.790> 25<00:06:17.210> minutes<00:06:17.500> so<00:06:18.500> this<00:06:18.680> guy

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:18.920 
get you 20 to 25 minutes so this guy

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:22.120 
get you 20 to 25 minutes so this guy
here<00:06:19.280> recording<00:06:19.700> at<00:06:20.090> the<00:06:20.440> mxp<00:06:21.440> the<00:06:21.710> top<00:06:21.890> detail

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:22.130 
here recording at the mxp the top detail

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:25.380 
here recording at the mxp the top detail
level<00:06:22.760> you<00:06:23.510> will<00:06:23.660> get<00:06:23.930> with<00:06:24.560> this<00:06:24.710> battery

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:25.390 
level you will get with this battery

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:27.940 
level you will get with this battery
again<00:06:26.390> it's<00:06:26.600> an<00:06:26.750> estimate<00:06:27.200> on<00:06:27.230> their<00:06:27.440> part<00:06:27.710> but

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:27.950 
again it's an estimate on their part but

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:30.790 
again it's an estimate on their part but
little<00:06:28.550> over<00:06:28.760> an<00:06:28.850> hour<00:06:28.940> so<00:06:29.810> I<00:06:29.840> just<00:06:30.440> couldn't

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:30.800 
little over an hour so I just couldn't

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.340 
little over an hour so I just couldn't
manage<00:06:30.950> the<00:06:31.250> 20<00:06:31.520> to<00:06:31.610> 25<00:06:32.000> minutes<00:06:32.210> I<00:06:32.570> don't<00:06:33.170> have

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:33.350 
manage the 20 to 25 minutes I don't have

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:35.410 
manage the 20 to 25 minutes I don't have
to<00:06:33.440> go<00:06:33.560> spend<00:06:33.860> another<00:06:34.130> $79<00:06:35.030> just<00:06:35.060> for<00:06:35.240> the

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:35.420 
to go spend another $79 just for the

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:37.090 
to go spend another $79 just for the
battery<00:06:35.690> so<00:06:36.380> it<00:06:36.470> seemed<00:06:36.680> like<00:06:36.830> it<00:06:36.980> was<00:06:37.070> a

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:37.100 
battery so it seemed like it was a

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:38.650 
battery so it seemed like it was a
better<00:06:37.310> deal<00:06:37.490> to<00:06:37.700> spend<00:06:37.910> more<00:06:38.090> to<00:06:38.330> get<00:06:38.480> the

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:38.660 
better deal to spend more to get the

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:42.250 
better deal to spend more to get the
m500<00:06:39.080> also<00:06:39.800> the<00:06:39.980> m500<00:06:40.400> has<00:06:41.360> a<00:06:41.810> lot<00:06:42.020> better

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:42.260 
m500 also the m500 has a lot better

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.560 
m500 also the m500 has a lot better

low-light capabilities which you use
