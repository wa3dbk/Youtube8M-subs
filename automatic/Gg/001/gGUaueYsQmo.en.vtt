 35 kg bytes therefore it takes little time 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:07.110
 open and these are two rows 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:09.880

 window to find the roms 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.690
 clearly the Roma you have to download 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.150
 what is rome is simply the game 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.580

 then there are Italian English 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.480

 go here but mark archive archive 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.570
 as they say and look for the Rome that you 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.760
 I have always been interested in writing a pokémon 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:27.040

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.360

 Italian so I show you how 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:35.680
 works that works especially then 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.140
 let's go down let's go down there 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.910

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.920
 first in Italian that I found there 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.810

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.910
 music page on Roma transfer 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.520
 as a green dart pd always opens 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:51.070
 another page go down green recipe 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:53.890
 click and download mo puts us 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:55.630
 slightly more than the mason and 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.740
 however, games are very small 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:00.430
 in short, then there are countless 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:02.170
 those you can safely look for 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.900
 what you want for downloaded 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:07.030
 in short, here you are, then you downloaded me 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.610
 the roma you the pri the reader to this 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.350
 file here where you will always be where the fuck 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:13.750
 I think it was on the desktop that I was 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:15.370
 I find it convenient to close this 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.109
 put down here we have this 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:20.979
 you can't open that stuff clearly 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:23.070
 what or cba instead you can open reds 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:26.620
 cpa look for the 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:29.610
 the rom you are interested in is here then 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:33.639
 the mason opened and started us 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:37.570
 then clearly here you reveal it 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:40.990
 enlarge in like how the game varies 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:43.030
 practically this is the game and people 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:45.880
 emerald premier is scheduled from new 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:48.729
 short game options this is it 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.440
 you see it works and I've tried it I've got it 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:53.820
 played and works 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:58.990
 then create you these folders here that they are 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:05:01.180
 bacteria and slots agp a.in you clearly 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:03.370
 not deleted if you prefer 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.900
 so you create a folder that you 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.280
 all piccard is all in this way 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:08.080
 at least it doesn't bother me but not 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:11.380
 delete nothing because i am 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.090
