00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:31.470
 I just thought again before okay good 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:36.120
 Your name is noodles before you 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:38.319
 A friend is also his mother 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.120
 We are now leaving all speculation 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:42.819
 aside then look something and I completely 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:46.360
 great that's nice with the sharpness and 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:48.640
 with the moment zone heide dares 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.130
 in the erika edeka i can mine 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.170
 Hearts of botany shining over communicate 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:59.079
 I personally always like something like that 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:03:01.570
 behind the erika scotland one always 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:05.640
 nice not live the good is because 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:08.380
 because I do not think but beautiful real 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.470
 has something so soothing in color 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.359
 and I think that's a lot of arguments 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.299
 Rest from that they are what I do 

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:18.310
 also to share the former 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:20.920
 beautiful colors and but also 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.269
 be authentic and with me i like it 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.820
 when people are right in the middle 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:27.190
 are also beautiful weather through 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:29.530
 this is a bit too photographed 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.190
 soft and funny as she sits in the grass 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.900
 but that's really grumpy now 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.360
 if it is often called then I know something 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:43.710
 it means six little puppies 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:44.340
 cultures and future I mean that 

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:46.080
 in Berlin 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:49.620
 or are they the tribe of the Scots? 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:51.210
 or possibly works mostly 9 me 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:56.580
 Wonder about so much green and beyond 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:04:00.410
 in berlin the berliner weighed in 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:01.920
 scotland originated really cool 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:04.440
 Beautiful colors 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:10.380
 That's a bit of a pose for me 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:12.120
 a bit delivered and cohesive 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:17.940
 cool here too with the bassist that is 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:21.209
 the weather bad alexander should be there 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:23.460
 a nice work in the back, too 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:25.320
 always calmly set 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.450
 Most frames would have more I find 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:31.440
 also forward all fits together nicely 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:32.340
 thick paper nice and harmonious all around 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.280

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:37.740
