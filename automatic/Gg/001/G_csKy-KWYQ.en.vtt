00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.970 
because level 2 gets you the hidden

for the the only way you can get it and

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.009 
for the the only way you can get it and
you<00:04:07.780> need<00:04:08.200> it<00:04:08.260> for<00:04:08.590> the<00:04:08.879> all<00:04:09.879> sorcery<00:04:10.510> trophy

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
which turn then will put you on your way

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:16.229 
which turn then will put you on your way
towards<00:04:14.290> a<00:04:14.349> platinum<00:04:14.879> alright<00:04:15.879> so<00:04:16.000> we've<00:04:16.150> been

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
towards a platinum alright so we've been

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:17.670 
towards a platinum alright so we've been
up<00:04:16.389> here<00:04:16.510> this<00:04:16.660> I<00:04:16.780> think<00:04:16.840> will<00:04:17.079> be<00:04:17.169> the<00:04:17.440> fifth

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
up here this I think will be the fifth

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.819 
up here this I think will be the fifth
attempt<00:04:18.160> I<00:04:18.660> lose<00:04:19.660> track<00:04:19.870> if<00:04:20.260> we<00:04:20.440> don't<00:04:20.620> get<00:04:20.709> in

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:20.829 
attempt I lose track if we don't get in

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:22.500 
attempt I lose track if we don't get in
by<00:04:20.919> five<00:04:21.190> we're<00:04:21.489> going<00:04:21.609> to<00:04:21.669> try<00:04:21.940> the<00:04:22.000> throw

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
by five we're going to try the throw

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.260 
by five we're going to try the throw
loading<00:04:22.930> screen<00:04:23.290> method<00:04:23.620> in<00:04:23.740> there<00:04:23.949> and

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
loading screen method in there and

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.930 
loading screen method in there and
hopefully<00:04:25.270> he<00:04:25.660> spawns<00:04:25.990> this<00:04:26.800> is<00:04:27.010> X<00:04:27.370> all<00:04:27.850> right

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
hopefully he spawns this is X all right

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.689 
hopefully he spawns this is X all right
there<00:04:28.120> he<00:04:28.270> is<00:04:28.300> yeah<00:04:28.900> this<00:04:29.169> was<00:04:29.410> one<00:04:30.040> in<00:04:30.190> five<00:04:30.430> so

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:30.699 
there he is yeah this was one in five so

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:32.610 
there he is yeah this was one in five so
20%<00:04:31.030> usually<00:04:31.780> it's<00:04:31.930> a<00:04:31.990> little<00:04:32.229> better<00:04:32.380> than

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
20% usually it's a little better than

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.770 
20% usually it's a little better than
that<00:04:32.650> but<00:04:33.070> and<00:04:33.639> that<00:04:33.820> was<00:04:34.000> a<00:04:34.030> complete<00:04:34.449> fail

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780 
that but and that was a complete fail

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.020 
that but and that was a complete fail

backstab and he's gonna kill me now
right<00:05:09.210> alright<00:05:10.210> we<00:05:11.020> played<00:05:11.289> that<00:05:11.410> little

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 
right alright we played that little

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.469 
right alright we played that little
carelessly<00:05:12.130> but<00:05:12.430> that's<00:05:12.639> the<00:05:12.910> guy<00:05:13.060> you<00:05:13.120> want

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:13.479 
carelessly but that's the guy you want

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:17.520 
carelessly but that's the guy you want
to<00:05:13.539> have<00:05:14.260> respawn<00:05:14.860> like<00:05:15.639> I<00:05:15.729> said<00:05:15.910> 10<00:05:16.150> times<00:05:16.530> for

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:17.530 
to have respawn like I said 10 times for

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:22.770 
to have respawn like I said 10 times for
level<00:05:17.800> 1<00:05:17.979> 30<00:05:18.970> times<00:05:19.300> for<00:05:19.990> rink<00:05:20.919> -<00:05:21.760> and<00:05:22.240> the

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:22.780 
level 1 30 times for rink - and the

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.080 
level 1 30 times for rink - and the
sorcery<00:05:23.260> rank<00:05:24.039> 3<00:05:24.310> you<00:05:24.430> can<00:05:24.610> do<00:05:24.700> it<00:05:24.820> all<00:05:24.940> the<00:05:25.030> way

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:25.090 
sorcery rank 3 you can do it all the way

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:27.180 
sorcery rank 3 you can do it all the way
up<00:05:25.120> to<00:05:25.300> rank<00:05:25.510> 3<00:05:25.660> but<00:05:25.930> I<00:05:26.200> have<00:05:26.560> a<00:05:26.590> feeling<00:05:27.039> that

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:27.190 
up to rank 3 but I have a feeling that

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:30.750 
up to rank 3 but I have a feeling that
that<00:05:27.630> ring<00:05:28.630> 3<00:05:28.870> out<00:05:28.990> ofits<00:05:29.410> how<00:05:30.099> many<00:05:30.280> kills<00:05:30.580> you

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:30.760 
that ring 3 out ofits how many kills you

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.820 
that ring 3 out ofits how many kills you
need

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:33.830 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:35.830 

that<00:05:34.160> will<00:05:34.280> probably<00:05:34.610> not<00:05:34.759> be<00:05:34.789> so<00:05:35.419> much<00:05:35.599> fun

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840 
that will probably not be so much fun

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.559 
that will probably not be so much fun
but<00:05:36.740> you<00:05:36.889> could<00:05:37.009> do<00:05:37.129> it<00:05:37.160> I<00:05:37.460> don't<00:05:38.300> want<00:05:38.509> the

00:05:38.559 --> 00:05:38.569 
but you could do it I don't want the

00:05:38.569 --> 00:05:40.029 
but you could do it I don't want the
reward<00:05:38.750> is<00:05:39.050> for<00:05:39.199> ring<00:05:39.349> clear<00:05:39.530> things<00:05:39.740> like<00:05:39.919> the

00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:40.039 
reward is for ring clear things like the

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:41.409 
reward is for ring clear things like the
belt<00:05:40.250> keeper<00:05:40.550> armor<00:05:40.910> or<00:05:41.060> something<00:05:41.300> like<00:05:41.360> that

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:41.419 
belt keeper armor or something like that

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:43.749 
belt keeper armor or something like that
so<00:05:42.229> it's<00:05:42.620> probably<00:05:42.919> pretty<00:05:43.009> unique<00:05:43.460> because<00:05:43.490> I

00:05:43.749 --> 00:05:43.759 
so it's probably pretty unique because I

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:45.850 
so it's probably pretty unique because I
can't<00:05:43.970> imagine<00:05:44.060> many<00:05:44.419> people<00:05:44.780> have<00:05:45.020> gotten

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:45.860 
can't imagine many people have gotten

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:48.700 
can't imagine many people have gotten
terrain<00:05:46.159> 3<00:05:46.400> in<00:05:46.490> this<00:05:46.550> covenant<00:05:46.789> but<00:05:47.180> hey<00:05:47.810> it's

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:48.710 
terrain 3 in this covenant but hey it's

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:51.760 
terrain 3 in this covenant but hey it's
