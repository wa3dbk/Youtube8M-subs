00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
nobody really thought about any hint of

nobody really thought about any hint of
conservation<00:01:03.210> it<00:01:03.629> was<00:01:03.809> puzzling<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.320> the

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
conservation it was puzzling to the

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.560 
conservation it was puzzling to the
Indians<00:01:04.890> how<00:01:05.369> do<00:01:05.430> you<00:01:05.580> deal<00:01:05.850> with<00:01:05.880> these<00:01:06.299> men

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
Indians how do you deal with these men

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.010 
Indians how do you deal with these men
for<00:01:06.900> every<00:01:06.990> deer<00:01:07.830> that<00:01:08.070> fell<00:01:08.340> -<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:08.729> long<00:01:09.390> hunter

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
for every deer that fell - a long hunter

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.500 
for every deer that fell - a long hunter
gun<00:01:10.530> could<00:01:11.159> have<00:01:11.189> fallen<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.850> an<00:01:11.970> Indian<00:01:12.299> gun

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
gun could have fallen to an Indian gun

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.350 
gun could have fallen to an Indian gun
and<00:01:12.869> so<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.979> two<00:01:14.130> ideas<00:01:14.400> soared<00:01:14.700> as<00:01:14.909> the

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
and so the two ideas soared as the

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.789 
and so the two ideas soared as the
traders<00:01:15.750> would<00:01:15.930> come<00:01:16.140> in<00:01:16.320> they<00:01:16.500> would<00:01:16.530> bring

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
traders would come in they would bring

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.950 
traders would come in they would bring
in<00:01:17.009> new<00:01:17.189> commodities<00:01:17.880> blankets<00:01:18.689> they<00:01:18.840> would

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
in new commodities blankets they would

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.999 
in new commodities blankets they would
bring<00:01:19.170> in<00:01:19.610> beads<00:01:21.229> they<00:01:22.229> would<00:01:22.350> bring<00:01:22.530> in<00:01:22.740> wool

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
bring in beads they would bring in wool

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.219 
bring in beads they would bring in wool
they<00:01:23.520> would<00:01:23.670> bring<00:01:23.820> in<00:01:24.030> trade<00:01:24.330> silver<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:25.049> so

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
they would bring in trade silver and so

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.590 
they would bring in trade silver and so
these<00:01:25.409> were<00:01:25.560> desirable<00:01:26.040> things<00:01:26.340> T<00:01:26.790> oftentimes

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
these were desirable things T oftentimes

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.069 
these were desirable things T oftentimes
the<00:01:28.409> liquor<00:01:28.950> trade<00:01:29.810> was<00:01:30.810> extensive<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:31.650> so

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:33.079 
the liquor trade was extensive and so

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:36.109 
the liquor trade was extensive and so
basically<00:01:34.079> what<00:01:34.380> happens<00:01:34.829> is<00:01:35.040> you<00:01:35.340> began<00:01:36.000> to

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
basically what happens is you began to

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:43.980 
basically what happens is you began to
have<00:01:36.680> conflicts

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:49.570

by<00:04:32.690> 1810<00:04:33.690> 1812<00:04:34.500> they<00:04:34.710> no<00:04:34.860> longer<00:04:34.890> had<00:04:35.370> them<00:04:35.520> on

by 1810 1812 they no longer had them on

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.460 
by 1810 1812 they no longer had them on
the<00:04:35.790> menu<00:04:35.970> because<00:04:36.480> they<00:04:36.630> couldn't<00:04:36.900> get<00:04:37.110> on<00:04:37.260> so

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
the menu because they couldn't get on so

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.110 
the menu because they couldn't get on so
you<00:04:37.590> can<00:04:37.680> kind<00:04:37.890> of<00:04:37.950> infer<00:04:38.130> then<00:04:38.820> that<00:04:39.000> they

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
you can kind of infer then that they

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.360 
you can kind of infer then that they
were<00:04:39.180> you<00:04:40.110> know<00:04:40.230> if<00:04:40.380> not<00:04:40.590> gone<00:04:40.890> pretty<00:04:41.250> well

were you know if not gone pretty well
diminished<00:04:42.150> shot<00:04:42.390> out<00:04:42.630> now<00:04:43.169> what<00:04:43.350> about

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:43.730 
diminished shot out now what about

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:46.760 
diminished shot out now what about
records<00:04:44.730> of<00:04:44.940> elk<00:04:45.390> when<00:04:46.140> did<00:04:46.290> they<00:04:46.380> start<00:04:46.650> to

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
records of elk when did they start to

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.159 
records of elk when did they start to
disappear<00:04:47.270> well<00:04:48.270> the<00:04:48.390> elk<00:04:48.600> is<00:04:48.750> a<00:04:48.870> little<00:04:49.050> bit

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:49.169 
disappear well the elk is a little bit

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:52.040 
disappear well the elk is a little bit
more<00:04:49.290> problematic<00:04:49.740> -<00:04:50.280> in<00:04:51.210> my<00:04:51.450> opinion<00:04:51.600> -<00:04:51.840> to

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
more problematic - in my opinion - to

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:53.659 
more problematic - in my opinion - to
talk<00:04:52.230> about<00:04:52.470> because<00:04:52.980> the<00:04:53.190> records<00:04:53.550> are<00:04:53.640> a

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:53.669 
talk about because the records are a

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:56.300 
talk about because the records are a
little<00:04:53.760> bit<00:04:53.910> bigger<00:04:54.180> but<00:04:55.020> again<00:04:55.950> by<00:04:56.160> the<00:04:56.220> time

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
little bit bigger but again by the time

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:01.909 
little bit bigger but again by the time
of<00:04:56.520> statehood<00:04:56.910> 8<00:04:57.919> 1792<00:05:00.290> they<00:05:01.290> were<00:05:01.680> thinning

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:01.919 
of statehood 8 1792 they were thinning

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:03.650 
of statehood 8 1792 they were thinning
dramatically<00:05:02.580> i<00:05:02.790> think<00:05:03.330> that<00:05:03.510> the<00:05:03.630> last

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 
dramatically i think that the last

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.920 
dramatically i think that the last
kentucky<00:05:04.350> sighting<00:05:04.710> of<00:05:04.770> elk<00:05:04.979> is<00:05:05.160> in<00:05:06.090> the<00:05:06.240> 1840s

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
kentucky sighting of elk is in the 1840s

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.260 
kentucky sighting of elk is in the 1840s
1850s<00:05:07.500> what<00:05:08.280> it<00:05:08.400> was<00:05:08.520> the<00:05:08.640> most<00:05:08.820> wasteful

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
1850s what it was the most wasteful

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.210 
1850s what it was the most wasteful
thing<00:05:09.450> that<00:05:09.600> had<00:05:09.930> happened<00:05:10.140> every<00:05:10.740> March

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
thing that had happened every March

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.670 
thing that had happened every March
April<00:05:11.550> May<00:05:11.910> they<00:05:12.690> would<00:05:12.840> fire<00:05:13.110> up<00:05:13.350> the<00:05:13.470> cane

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
April May they would fire up the cane

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.500 
April May they would fire up the cane
lands<00:05:13.919> they<00:05:14.070> would<00:05:14.190> just<00:05:14.310> destroy<00:05:14.510> literally

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:15.510 
lands they would just destroy literally

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.240 
lands they would just destroy literally
thousands<00:05:16.169> of<00:05:16.260> acres<00:05:16.380> of<00:05:16.530> cane<00:05:16.830> you<00:05:16.950> can<00:05:17.100> read

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:17.250 
thousands of acres of cane you can read

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.400 
thousands of acres of cane you can read
the<00:05:17.370> accounts<00:05:17.850> where<00:05:18.000> they<00:05:18.030> the<00:05:18.630> fires<00:05:19.050> would

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:19.410 
the accounts where they the fires would

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:20.600 
the accounts where they the fires would
burn<00:05:19.680> at<00:05:19.860> night<00:05:20.039> they<00:05:20.250> would<00:05:20.370> burn

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
burn at night they would burn

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:22.040 
burn at night they would burn
uncontrollably<00:05:21.330> they<00:05:21.570> would<00:05:21.750> they<00:05:21.930> would

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.050 
uncontrollably they would they would

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:24.100 
uncontrollably they would they would
sweep<00:05:22.320> cabins<00:05:22.919> and<00:05:23.430> so<00:05:23.610> there<00:05:23.760> they<00:05:23.910> were<00:05:23.940> just

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
sweep cabins and so there they were just

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.570 
sweep cabins and so there they were just
the<00:05:25.110> most<00:05:25.229> wasteful<00:05:25.680> practice<00:05:26.070> was<00:05:26.220> probably

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 
the most wasteful practice was probably

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:27.740 
the most wasteful practice was probably
not<00:05:26.760> hunting<00:05:27.180> even<00:05:27.390> though<00:05:27.479> that<00:05:27.660> was

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
not hunting even though that was

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:29.719 
not hunting even though that was
incredibly<00:05:28.140> wasteful<00:05:28.620> but<00:05:29.460> it<00:05:29.580> was<00:05:29.700> a

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:29.729 
incredibly wasteful but it was a

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:31.550 
incredibly wasteful but it was a
combination<00:05:30.270> of<00:05:30.330> that<00:05:30.479> plus<00:05:30.840> the<00:05:30.870> the

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.560 
combination of that plus the the

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.290 
combination of that plus the the
destruction<00:05:32.130> of<00:05:32.220> the<00:05:32.370> habitat<00:05:32.880> and<00:05:33.060> it<00:05:33.180> was

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 
destruction of the habitat and it was

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:34.790 
destruction of the habitat and it was
always<00:05:33.479> rapacious<00:05:34.140> hunting<00:05:34.530> there<00:05:34.680> was

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800 
always rapacious hunting there was

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.230 
always rapacious hunting there was
always<00:05:34.979> over<00:05:35.340> killing<00:05:35.669> there<00:05:35.820> was<00:05:35.940> all<00:05:36.090> there

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 
always over killing there was all there

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.909 
always over killing there was all there
was<00:05:36.300> no<00:05:36.360> regard<00:05:36.810> to<00:05:36.990> hunting<00:05:37.260> seasons<00:05:37.740> and

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:37.919 
was no regard to hunting seasons and

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:41.120 
was no regard to hunting seasons and
guest<00:05:38.130> station<00:05:38.490> periods<00:05:38.820> you<00:05:39.360> had<00:05:39.900> that<00:05:40.229> but

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:41.130 
guest station periods you had that but

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:43.730 
guest station periods you had that but
probably<00:05:41.640> the<00:05:42.090> breeds<00:05:42.360> could<00:05:43.020> have<00:05:43.260> survived

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:43.740 
probably the breeds could have survived

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.820 
probably the breeds could have survived
if<00:05:44.100> they<00:05:44.940> would<00:05:45.090> have<00:05:45.289> maintained<00:05:46.289> some<00:05:46.560> sense

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:46.830 
if they would have maintained some sense

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:49.040 
if they would have maintained some sense
of<00:05:46.950> habitat<00:05:47.430> and<00:05:47.580> they<00:05:47.789> didn't<00:05:48.090> all<00:05:48.900> right

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.050
