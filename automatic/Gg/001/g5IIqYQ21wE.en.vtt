fishing a saltwater for flounder look
this<00:02:39.010> is<00:02:39.190> a<00:02:39.220> great<00:02:39.489> simple<00:02:40.090> rig<00:02:40.239> to<00:02:40.390> use<00:02:40.599> it's<00:02:41.290> a

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
this is a great simple rig to use it's a

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.800 
this is a great simple rig to use it's a
slip<00:02:41.920> rig<00:02:42.280> basically<00:02:43.060> we<00:02:43.209> got<00:02:43.330> a<00:02:43.390> little<00:02:43.629> leg

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
slip rig basically we got a little leg

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.180 
slip rig basically we got a little leg
sinker<00:02:44.200> right<00:02:44.379> here

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
sinker right here

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.040 
sinker right here
and<00:02:45.610> this<00:02:45.820> sake<00:02:46.030> stinkers<00:02:46.390> just<00:02:46.630> on<00:02:46.780> the<00:02:46.870> line

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
and this sake stinkers just on the line

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.440 
and this sake stinkers just on the line
and<00:02:47.470> it<00:02:47.650> allows<00:02:48.220> the<00:02:48.550> line<00:02:48.730> to<00:02:48.910> slide<00:02:49.150> through

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
and it allows the line to slide through

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.150 
and it allows the line to slide through
it<00:02:49.540> so<00:02:49.690> if<00:02:49.780> the<00:02:49.870> sinker<00:02:50.140> geeks<00:02:50.350> hunt<00:02:50.590> gets<00:02:50.980> hung

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
it so if the sinker geeks hunt gets hung

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.430 
it so if the sinker geeks hunt gets hung
up<00:02:51.310> a<00:02:51.430> little<00:02:51.610> bit<00:02:51.820> the<00:02:52.450> fish<00:02:52.690> can<00:02:52.930> still<00:02:53.170> pull

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
up a little bit the fish can still pull

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.710 
up a little bit the fish can still pull
the<00:02:53.530> line<00:02:53.740> through<00:02:53.980> the<00:02:54.040> sinker<00:02:54.460> and<00:02:55.270> you<00:02:55.510> can

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
the line through the sinker and you can

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.630 
the line through the sinker and you can
you<00:02:56.170> can<00:02:56.320> feel<00:02:56.530> the<00:02:56.650> body's<00:02:56.950> real<00:02:57.190> sensitive

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
you can feel the body's real sensitive

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.670 
you can feel the body's real sensitive
and<00:02:57.850> I<00:02:57.970> always<00:02:58.210> use<00:02:58.570> a<00:02:58.600> bead<00:02:58.960> right<00:02:59.290> here<00:02:59.500> right

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
and I always use a bead right here right

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:00.750 
and I always use a bead right here right
below<00:02:59.860> that<00:02:59.980> sinker

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
below that sinker

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.610 
below that sinker
now<00:03:01.180> that<00:03:01.360> bead<00:03:01.630> there<00:03:01.900> I<00:03:01.930> used<00:03:02.230> to<00:03:02.320> protect

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
now that bead there I used to protect

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:03.990 
now that bead there I used to protect
the<00:03:02.710> knot<00:03:02.950> but<00:03:03.130> also<00:03:03.280> it'll<00:03:03.610> make<00:03:03.760> a<00:03:03.790> little

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
the knot but also it'll make a little

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.790 
the knot but also it'll make a little
bit<00:03:04.210> of<00:03:04.300> noise<00:03:04.480> when<00:03:04.870> I<00:03:04.900> bump<00:03:05.470> it<00:03:05.590> on<00:03:05.710> the

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
bit of noise when I bump it on the

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.680 
bit of noise when I bump it on the
bottom<00:03:06.100> a<00:03:06.190> little<00:03:06.220> bit<00:03:06.580> and<00:03:06.730> help<00:03:06.820> create<00:03:07.660> a

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
bottom a little bit and help create a

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.510 
bottom a little bit and help create a
