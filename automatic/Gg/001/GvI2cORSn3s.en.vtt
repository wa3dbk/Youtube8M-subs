creative if he's going to get four he
has<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.100> push<00:01:51.000> into<00:01:51.330> the<00:01:51.450> attack<00:01:51.780> he<00:01:51.930> came<00:01:52.110> as<00:01:52.229> a

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
has to push into the attack he came as a

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.050 
has to push into the attack he came as a
sub<00:01:52.620> in<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:52.830> last<00:01:53.070> game<00:01:53.250> against<00:01:53.549> Honduras

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
sub in the last game against Honduras

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.640 
sub in the last game against Honduras
but<00:01:54.270> I<00:01:54.479> think<00:01:54.840> he's<00:01:54.930> gonna<00:01:55.020> start<00:01:55.380> from<00:01:55.530> the

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:55.650 
but I think he's gonna start from the

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.620 
but I think he's gonna start from the
beginning<00:01:56.010> and<00:01:56.100> if<00:01:56.549> he<00:01:56.790> can<00:01:57.000> be<00:01:57.150> that<00:01:57.360> guy<00:01:57.570> to

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
beginning and if he can be that guy to

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.140 
beginning and if he can be that guy to
stretch<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.860> defense<00:01:58.979> for<00:01:59.490> Mexico<00:01:59.880> that

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.150 
stretch the defense for Mexico that

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.539

to<00:02:02.729> get<00:02:02.970> forward<00:02:03.360> they<00:02:04.020> have<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:04.350> deny<00:02:04.530> service

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
to get forward they have to deny service

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.859

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:31.770 
think that bringing in Gordon brings
some<00:03:30.099> more<00:03:30.250> options<00:03:30.430> up<00:03:30.910> top<00:03:31.329> that's<00:03:31.630> an

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
some more options up top that's an

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.120 
some more options up top that's an
interesting<00:03:32.169> one<00:03:32.319> to<00:03:32.349> me<00:03:32.560> now<00:03:32.739> they<00:03:32.919> have<00:03:33.099> a

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
interesting one to me now they have a

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.099 
interesting one to me now they have a
guy<00:03:33.310> up<00:03:33.459> top<00:03:33.669> who<00:03:33.880> can<00:03:34.060> really<00:03:34.269> hold<00:03:34.660> the<00:03:34.900> ball

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:35.109 
guy up top who can really hold the ball

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:37.440 
guy up top who can really hold the ball
up<00:03:35.160> Johnson<00:03:36.160> gives<00:03:36.609> them<00:03:36.790> some<00:03:36.970> more<00:03:37.090> speed<00:03:37.419> i

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
up Johnson gives them some more speed i

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:38.729 
up Johnson gives them some more speed i
think<00:03:37.780> that<00:03:37.930> Klinsmann<00:03:38.139> wants<00:03:38.500> to<00:03:38.590> just

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
think that Klinsmann wants to just

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:40.379 
think that Klinsmann wants to just
continue<00:03:39.069> to<00:03:39.099> work<00:03:39.340> him<00:03:39.579> into<00:03:39.760> the<00:03:39.940> lineup<00:03:40.150> and

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:40.389 
continue to work him into the lineup and

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:42.599 
continue to work him into the lineup and
B's<00:03:41.049> ler<00:03:41.290> and<00:03:41.500> eventually<00:03:41.889> gonzalez<00:03:42.370> when<00:03:42.489> he

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:42.609 
B's ler and eventually gonzalez when he

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:44.190 
B's ler and eventually gonzalez when he
joins<00:03:42.819> for<00:03:43.030> the<00:03:43.090> semis<00:03:43.480> if<00:03:43.630> they<00:03:43.750> get<00:03:43.930> through

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
joins for the semis if they get through

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.199 
joins for the semis if they get through
he's<00:03:44.799> the<00:03:44.980> one<00:03:45.099> hang<00:03:45.579> on<00:03:45.730> I<00:03:45.760> need<00:03:45.880> some<00:03:46.060> extra

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
he's the one hang on I need some extra

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:48.150 
he's the one hang on I need some extra
time<00:03:46.450> I<00:03:46.720> need<00:03:47.019> some<00:03:47.139> extra<00:03:47.319> time<00:03:47.500> or<00:03:47.769> stoppage

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
time I need some extra time or stoppage

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.379 
time I need some extra time or stoppage
time<00:03:48.190> can<00:03:48.489> we<00:03:48.519> get<00:03:48.669> some<00:03:48.819> Salvage<00:03:49.150> time<00:03:49.269> I

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:49.389 
time can we get some Salvage time I

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:50.819 
time can we get some Salvage time I
think<00:03:49.660> we<00:03:49.810> can<00:03:49.959> get<00:03:50.139> things<00:03:50.290> all<00:03:50.530> right<00:03:50.680> it<00:03:50.799> is

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:50.829 
think we can get things all right it is

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:53.069 
think we can get things all right it is
the<00:03:51.040> u.s.<00:03:51.310> it<00:03:52.000> is<00:03:52.060> the<00:03:52.389> US<00:03:52.569> but<00:03:52.750> I<00:03:52.810> think<00:03:53.049> that

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:53.079 
the u.s. it is the US but I think that

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:54.599 
the u.s. it is the US but I think that
these<00:03:53.349> have<00:03:53.500> been<00:03:53.620> some<00:03:53.859> good<00:03:53.980> decisions<00:03:54.340> but

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:54.609 
these have been some good decisions but

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:56.909 
these have been some good decisions but
I<00:03:54.970> Klinsmann<00:03:55.419> really<00:03:55.900> it<00:03:55.989> shows<00:03:56.230> he<00:03:56.530> wants<00:03:56.829> to

00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:56.919 
I Klinsmann really it shows he wants to

00:03:56.919 --> 00:03:58.409 
I Klinsmann really it shows he wants to
go<00:03:57.069> and<00:03:57.220> try<00:03:57.370> and<00:03:57.430> get<00:03:57.579> the<00:03:57.700> victory<00:03:58.030> get<00:03:58.269> the
