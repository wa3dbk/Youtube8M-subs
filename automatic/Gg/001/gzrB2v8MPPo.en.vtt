00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
from this stay away from this unless you

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.699 
from this stay away from this unless you
have<00:02:17.269> a<00:02:17.299> proxy<00:02:17.870> but<00:02:17.989> then<00:02:18.410> you're<00:02:18.530> screwed

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
have a proxy but then you're screwed

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:26.229 
have a proxy but then you're screwed
anyway<00:02:20.500> dms<00:02:21.820> try<00:02:22.820> it<00:02:22.989> automatically<00:02:23.989> or<00:02:25.239> well

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
anyway dms try it automatically or well

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:30.580 
anyway dms try it automatically or well
if<00:02:26.510> possible<00:02:27.340> do<00:02:28.340> it<00:02:28.459> yourself<00:02:29.590> automatically

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
if possible do it yourself automatically

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.130 
if possible do it yourself automatically
is<00:02:30.799> probably<00:02:31.609> your<00:02:31.730> best<00:02:31.790> bet<00:02:32.120> but<00:02:32.660> I<00:02:32.720> have

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
is probably your best bet but I have

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.190 
is probably your best bet but I have
done<00:02:33.440> well<00:02:33.829> not<00:02:34.609> automatically<00:02:35.600> because<00:02:36.049> I

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
done well not automatically because I

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.970 
done well not automatically because I
have<00:02:36.500> static<00:02:36.920> ip's<00:02:37.340> here<00:02:37.640> at<00:02:38.390> my<00:02:38.690> oh<00:02:38.720> my<00:02:39.170> I<00:02:39.530> said

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
everything myself which if you have to

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.930 
everything myself which if you have to
know<00:02:43.069> that<00:02:43.250> you<00:02:43.430> can<00:02:43.639> do<00:02:44.150> of<00:02:44.299> course<00:02:45.940> that's
