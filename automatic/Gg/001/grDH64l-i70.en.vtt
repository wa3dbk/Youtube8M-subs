didn't<00:01:50.409> expect<00:01:50.740> it<00:01:50.830> but<00:01:51.009> in<00:01:51.399> the<00:01:51.490> morning<00:01:51.850> the

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970 
didn't expect it but in the morning the

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.370 
didn't expect it but in the morning the
weather<00:01:52.149> is<00:01:52.270> ok<00:01:52.479> in<00:01:52.689> the<00:01:52.840> wind<00:01:53.020> is<00:01:53.110> not<00:01:53.259> that

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
weather is ok in the wind is not that

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.010 
weather is ok in the wind is not that
strong<00:01:54.009> the<00:01:54.640> moment<00:01:55.000> also<00:01:55.119> we<00:01:55.330> are<00:01:55.450> looking<00:01:55.869> if

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
strong the moment also we are looking if

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.499 
strong the moment also we are looking if
we<00:01:56.140> can<00:01:56.320> remove<00:01:56.649> the<00:01:56.860> wing<00:01:57.039> tips<00:01:57.250> because<00:01:58.060> the

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:58.509 
we can remove the wing tips because the

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:01.080 
we can remove the wing tips because the
wing<00:01:58.659> is<00:01:58.810> closing<00:01:59.320> is<00:01:59.920> close<00:02:00.250> by<00:02:00.549> the<00:02:00.610> wing<00:02:00.880> tip

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
wing is closing is close by the wing tip

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.300 
wing is closing is close by the wing tip
and<00:02:01.330> if<00:02:01.960> we<00:02:02.110> have<00:02:02.229> the<00:02:02.380> possibility<00:02:02.770> to<00:02:03.039> just

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
and if we have the possibility to just

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.730 
and if we have the possibility to just
take<00:02:03.460> off<00:02:03.640> the<00:02:03.789> wing<00:02:03.970> tip<00:02:04.210> we<00:02:05.020> can<00:02:05.439> make<00:02:05.619> it

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
take off the wing tip we can make it

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.309 
take off the wing tip we can make it
possible<00:02:05.920> for<00:02:06.250> the<00:02:06.490> small<00:02:06.899> fishes<00:02:07.899> and<00:02:08.110> for

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319 
possible for the small fishes and for

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:10.109 
possible for the small fishes and for
the<00:02:08.410> small<00:02:08.649> microbes<00:02:09.160> are<00:02:09.369> actively<00:02:09.759> looking

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
the small microbes are actively looking

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.630 
the small microbes are actively looking
for<00:02:10.179> shelter<00:02:10.539> to<00:02:10.899> breed<00:02:11.590> this<00:02:12.430> should<00:02:12.610> be

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
for shelter to breed this should be

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.220 
for shelter to breed this should be
interesting<00:02:12.790> case<00:02:14.430> for<00:02:15.430> planes<00:02:15.959> do<00:02:16.959> you<00:02:17.049> think

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
interesting case for planes do you think

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:18.300 
interesting case for planes do you think
the<00:02:17.350> planes<00:02:17.650> are<00:02:17.860> going<00:02:17.980> to<00:02:18.040> be<00:02:18.100> more

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
the planes are going to be more

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.490 
the planes are going to be more
interesting<00:02:18.850> for<00:02:19.030> the<00:02:19.120> divers<00:02:19.360> once<00:02:20.230> it<00:02:20.470> is

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
interesting for the divers once it is

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.440 
interesting for the divers once it is

noticed one of the helicopters we did we

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.960 
noticed one of the helicopters we did we
miss<00:02:51.390> most<00:02:52.390> of<00:02:52.570> it<00:02:52.750> of<00:02:52.959> course<00:02:53.620> but<00:02:53.970> it's

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
miss most of it of course but it's

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.300 
miss most of it of course but it's
always<00:02:55.150> a<00:02:55.359> sharp<00:02:55.989> and<00:02:56.290> Middle<00:02:56.739> East<00:02:56.890> medal<00:02:57.190> and

always a sharp and Middle East medal and

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:58.680 
always a sharp and Middle East medal and
they<00:02:57.430> go<00:02:57.609> under<00:02:57.760> the<00:02:57.940> water<00:02:58.060> so<00:02:58.329> you<00:02:58.359> have<00:02:58.570> to

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
they go under the water so you have to

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.750 
they go under the water so you have to
get<00:02:58.840> care<00:02:59.049> is<00:02:59.230> the<00:02:59.650> safest<00:02:59.920> way<00:03:00.220> is<00:03:00.250> to<00:03:00.579> type

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
get care is the safest way is to type

this rake is around looking the fish

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.080 
this rake is around looking the fish
they<00:03:02.470> will<00:03:02.590> come<00:03:02.739> immediately<00:03:03.190> it<00:03:03.579> called<00:03:03.940> us

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
they will come immediately it called us

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.300 
they will come immediately it called us
a<00:03:04.120> lot<00:03:04.390> more<00:03:04.420> altitude<00:03:05.320> with<00:03:05.739> the<00:03:05.920> first<00:03:06.130> it

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
a lot more altitude with the first it

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.370 
a lot more altitude with the first it
starts<00:03:06.609> as<00:03:06.730> a<00:03:06.760> fa<00:03:07.180> deficient<00:03:07.630> erecting<00:03:08.079> device

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
starts as a fa deficient erecting device

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.440 
starts as a fa deficient erecting device
and<00:03:08.680> it<00:03:09.010> gets<00:03:09.190> that<00:03:09.430> an<00:03:09.579> artificial<00:03:10.030> reef<00:03:10.180> with

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
and it gets that an artificial reef with

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.479 
and it gets that an artificial reef with
the<00:03:10.600> years<00:03:10.840> do<00:03:11.829> you<00:03:11.890> think<00:03:11.950> the<00:03:12.220> fish

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
the years do you think the fish

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:14.160 
the years do you think the fish
themselves<00:03:12.940> were<00:03:13.420> like<00:03:13.630> this<00:03:13.870> I<00:03:14.049> mean

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
themselves were like this I mean

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:15.539 
themselves were like this I mean
obviously<00:03:14.470> they'll<00:03:14.920> go<00:03:15.069> in<00:03:15.250> through<00:03:15.430> the

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549 
obviously they'll go in through the

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:17.160 
obviously they'll go in through the
windows<00:03:15.910> and<00:03:16.239> the<00:03:16.299> openings<00:03:16.750> but<00:03:16.930> the

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
windows and the openings but the

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.410 
windows and the openings but the
openings<00:03:17.560> of<00:03:17.739> the<00:03:17.799> front<00:03:18.069> look<00:03:18.489> quite<00:03:18.670> big<00:03:18.970> do

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
openings of the front look quite big do

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:20.490 
openings of the front look quite big do
you<00:03:19.480> think<00:03:19.540> you'll<00:03:19.750> get<00:03:19.930> some<00:03:20.140> big<00:03:20.319> fish

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
you think you'll get some big fish

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.680 
you think you'll get some big fish
coming<00:03:20.829> directly<00:03:21.519> directly<00:03:21.970> they<00:03:22.390> become

coming directly directly they become

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.900 
coming directly directly they become
immediately<00:03:23.109> taking<00:03:23.680> the<00:03:23.769> new<00:03:23.890> houses<00:03:24.310> we

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
immediately taking the new houses we

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:26.759 
immediately taking the new houses we
give<00:03:25.090> them<00:03:25.209> quite<00:03:25.450> huge<00:03:25.870> realized<00:03:26.290> to<00:03:26.440> live<00:03:26.590> in

give them quite huge realized to live in

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:28.590 
give them quite huge realized to live in
and<00:03:26.950> it's<00:03:27.579> an<00:03:27.700> attraction<00:03:28.030> for<00:03:28.209> all<00:03:28.450> the
