00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
now that I've got all those screws out I

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.460

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
can begin to remove the lower case by

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.260 
can begin to remove the lower case by
grabbing<00:01:40.920> it<00:01:41.130> right<00:01:41.370> between<00:01:41.550> the<00:01:41.940> display

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
it towards the front of the computer now

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.260 
it towards the front of the computer now
that<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.620> lower<00:01:49.800> case<00:01:50.100> is<00:01:50.310> removed<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:51.120> very

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:52.440 
first thing we're going to do is

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.380 
first thing we're going to do is
disconnect<00:01:52.800> the<00:01:53.010> battery<00:01:53.370> and<00:01:53.580> really<00:01:54.180> that

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
disconnect the battery and really that

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.430 
disconnect the battery and really that
should<00:01:54.540> be<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.750> first<00:01:54.960> step<00:01:55.170> in<00:01:55.200> any

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:55.440 
should be the first step in any

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.380 
should be the first step in any
electronics<00:01:56.160> repair<00:01:56.490> because<00:01:56.880> we<00:01:57.090> don't<00:01:57.270> want
