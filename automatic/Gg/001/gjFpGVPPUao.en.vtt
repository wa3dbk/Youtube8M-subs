00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:55.539 
vegetables in just give that broth that

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:57.630 
vegetables in just give that broth that
extra<00:01:55.899> flavor<00:01:56.110> so<00:01:56.500> we<00:01:56.590> put<00:01:56.829> the<00:01:56.950> vegetables<00:01:57.520> in

here you can see dehydrate vegetables

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:01.080 
here you can see dehydrate vegetables
probably<00:02:00.280> not<00:02:00.399> the<00:02:00.489> best<00:02:00.520> choice<00:02:00.729> on<00:02:01.060> your

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
probably not the best choice on your

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.440 
probably not the best choice on your
diet<00:02:01.420> but<00:02:02.049> in<00:02:02.349> type<00:02:02.829> times<00:02:03.099> and<00:02:03.520> in<00:02:04.090> quick

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
diet but in type times and in quick

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:05.850 
diet but in type times and in quick
times<00:02:04.719> it's<00:02:05.079> probably<00:02:05.319> the<00:02:05.379> best<00:02:05.619> thing<00:02:05.799> for

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
times it's probably the best thing for

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.410 
times it's probably the best thing for
you<00:02:06.219> so<00:02:06.399> while<00:02:06.670> the<00:02:06.789> water<00:02:07.000> is<00:02:07.179> boiling

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.180 
you so while the water is boiling
something<00:02:07.899> I<00:02:07.959> do<00:02:08.019> like<00:02:08.289> to<00:02:08.440> actually<00:02:08.619> do<00:02:08.950> is

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
something I do like to actually do is

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:10.949

sometimes<00:03:24.730> what<00:03:24.880> I<00:03:24.910> like<00:03:24.970> to<00:03:25.150> do<00:03:25.270> is<00:03:25.450> I<00:03:25.540> just

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
sometimes what I like to do is I just

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.590 
sometimes what I like to do is I just
like<00:03:25.780> to<00:03:25.900> crack<00:03:26.170> this<00:03:26.380> in<00:03:26.530> half<00:03:26.740> here<00:03:27.120> mm-hmm

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
like to crack this in half here mm-hmm

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.110 
like to crack this in half here mm-hmm
and<00:03:29.200> the<00:03:29.650> reason<00:03:29.980> why<00:03:30.070> I<00:03:30.100> like<00:03:30.580> to<00:03:30.670> do<00:03:30.790> this<00:03:30.940> is

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
and the reason why I like to do this is

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.820 
and the reason why I like to do this is
because<00:03:31.420> the<00:03:31.540> flavors<00:03:31.900> can<00:03:32.020> soak<00:03:32.260> in<00:03:32.440> between

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
because the flavors can soak in between

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.510 
because the flavors can soak in between
the<00:03:33.280> ramen<00:03:33.730> halves<00:03:34.650> just<00:03:35.650> like<00:03:35.800> that<00:03:36.010> just<00:03:36.370> to

the ramen halves just like that just to

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.280 
the ramen halves just like that just to
get<00:03:36.640> the<00:03:36.760> more<00:03:37.210> the<00:03:37.330> flavor<00:03:37.600> to<00:03:37.780> spread<00:03:38.110> out

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
get the more the flavor to spread out

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:39.510 
get the more the flavor to spread out
