okay<00:00:04.660> next<00:00:04.990> up<00:00:05.230> is<00:00:05.529> software<00:00:06.250> called<00:00:06.430> power

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:06.760 
okay next up is software called power

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:08.730 
okay next up is software called power
agent<00:00:07.210> which<00:00:07.359> comes<00:00:07.689> with<00:00:07.899> the<00:00:07.960> power<00:00:08.440> tap

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:08.740 
agent which comes with the power tap

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.030 
agent which comes with the power tap
power<00:00:09.460> meter<00:00:10.050> this<00:00:11.050> is<00:00:11.230> the<00:00:11.349> only<00:00:11.500> software

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:12.040 
power meter this is the only software

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:13.259 
power meter this is the only software
that<00:00:12.460> I'm<00:00:12.549> going<00:00:12.669> to<00:00:12.700> talk<00:00:12.820> about<00:00:12.969> today<00:00:13.240> that

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:13.269 
that I'm going to talk about today that

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:15.360 
that I'm going to talk about today that
is<00:00:13.540> Mac<00:00:13.750> compatible<00:00:14.080> so<00:00:14.589> if<00:00:14.679> you're<00:00:14.830> a<00:00:14.889> power

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:15.370 
is Mac compatible so if you're a power

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:18.029 
is Mac compatible so if you're a power
Mac<00:00:15.580> user<00:00:16.020> this<00:00:17.020> is<00:00:17.080> the<00:00:17.320> one<00:00:17.470> you<00:00:17.590> may<00:00:17.740> want<00:00:17.980> to

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:18.039 
Mac user this is the one you may want to

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:19.560 
Mac user this is the one you may want to
consider<00:00:18.340> that<00:00:18.580> may<00:00:18.670> be<00:00:18.730> a<00:00:18.880> factor<00:00:18.940> for<00:00:19.300> you

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:19.570 
consider that may be a factor for you

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.540 
consider that may be a factor for you
and<00:00:19.689> the<00:00:19.750> buying<00:00:20.019> decision<00:00:20.439> when<00:00:21.250> looking<00:00:21.460> at

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:21.550 
and the buying decision when looking at

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.080 
and the buying decision when looking at
different<00:00:21.820> power<00:00:21.970> meters<00:00:24.090> definitely

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:25.090 
different power meters definitely

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:27.990 
different power meters definitely
visually<00:00:26.009> simpler<00:00:27.009> and<00:00:27.279> easier<00:00:27.640> to<00:00:27.699> use

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:28.000 
visually simpler and easier to use

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.230 
visually simpler and easier to use
software<00:00:28.599> package<00:00:28.960> than<00:00:29.349> than<00:00:29.859> the<00:00:30.009> SRM<00:00:30.429> and

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:31.240 
software package than than the SRM and

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.390 
software package than than the SRM and
it<00:00:31.869> I<00:00:32.080> think<00:00:32.110> presents<00:00:32.740> the<00:00:32.830> data<00:00:33.040> in<00:00:33.280> an

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:33.400 
it I think presents the data in an

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.400 
it I think presents the data in an
overview<00:00:33.790> way<00:00:34.060> and<00:00:34.360> a<00:00:34.690> little<00:00:34.810> bit<00:00:35.020> more<00:00:35.200> of<00:00:35.320> an

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:35.410 
overview way and a little bit more of an

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.760 
overview way and a little bit more of an
intuitive<00:00:35.740> fashion<00:00:37.410> also<00:00:38.410> gives<00:00:38.620> you<00:00:38.710> the

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:38.770 
intuitive fashion also gives you the

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:40.770 
intuitive fashion also gives you the
ability<00:00:39.040> like<00:00:40.030> I<00:00:40.180> mentioned<00:00:40.480> before<00:00:40.540> to

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:40.780 
ability like I mentioned before to

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.310 
ability like I mentioned before to
configure<00:00:41.620> your<00:00:42.070> your<00:00:43.030> CPU<00:00:43.540> the<00:00:43.780> head<00:00:43.930> unit<00:00:44.230> on

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.320 
configure your your CPU the head unit on

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.800 
configure your your CPU the head unit on
the<00:00:44.410> power<00:00:44.590> tab<00:00:44.920> directly<00:00:45.550> from<00:00:45.910> the<00:00:46.120> PC<00:00:46.510> so

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:46.810 
the power tab directly from the PC so

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:50.730 
the power tab directly from the PC so
that's<00:00:47.020> really<00:00:47.320> handy<00:00:47.440> so<00:00:49.350> one<00:00:50.350> thing<00:00:50.500> you<00:00:50.590> see

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:50.740 
that's really handy so one thing you see

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:51.960 
that's really handy so one thing you see
here<00:00:50.770> when<00:00:51.040> you<00:00:51.130> first<00:00:51.310> download<00:00:51.490> your<00:00:51.850> data

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:51.970 
here when you first download your data

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.360 
here when you first download your data
and<00:00:52.270> open<00:00:52.360> it<00:00:52.540> up<00:00:52.630> in<00:00:52.780> power<00:00:53.020> agent<00:00:53.530> you<00:00:54.190> see

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370 
and open it up in power agent you see

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.610 
and open it up in power agent you see
the<00:00:54.490> workout<00:00:54.820> summary<00:00:55.240> you<00:00:55.750> see<00:00:55.960> powered<00:00:56.470> and

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:56.620 
the workout summary you see powered and

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.640 
the workout summary you see powered and
heartrate<00:00:57.190> distributions<00:00:58.110> for<00:00:59.110> the<00:00:59.260> percent

00:00:59.640 --> 00:00:59.650 
heartrate distributions for the percent

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.250 
heartrate distributions for the percent
time<00:00:59.890> for<00:01:00.550> your<00:01:00.670> different<00:01:00.820> zones<00:01:01.270> so<00:01:02.080> that's

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 
time for your different zones so that's

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.170 
time for your different zones so that's
really<00:01:02.410> important<00:01:02.950> in<00:01:03.430> terms<00:01:03.490> of<00:01:03.880> getting<00:01:04.030> a

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180 
really important in terms of getting a

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.910 
really important in terms of getting a
really<00:01:04.360> good<00:01:04.570> snapshot<00:01:04.989> of<00:01:05.260> whether<00:01:05.650> or<00:01:05.799> not

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
really good snapshot of whether or not

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.260 
really good snapshot of whether or not
you<00:01:06.159> spent<00:01:06.460> the<00:01:06.549> right<00:01:06.700> amount<00:01:07.000> of<00:01:07.060> time

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270 
you spent the right amount of time

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.590 
you spent the right amount of time
during<00:01:07.990> your<00:01:08.140> workout<00:01:08.969> in<00:01:09.969> the<00:01:10.090> right<00:01:10.240> zones

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
during your workout in the right zones

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.270 
during your workout in the right zones
the<00:01:11.259> other<00:01:11.409> thing<00:01:11.560> in<00:01:11.649> the<00:01:11.740> top<00:01:11.920> right<00:01:12.130> corner

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
the other thing in the top right corner

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.660 
the other thing in the top right corner
you<00:01:12.429> see<00:01:12.729> is<00:01:13.000> your<00:01:13.719> peak<00:01:13.960> power<00:01:14.200> curve<00:01:14.979> versus

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
you see is your peak power curve versus

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.270 
you see is your peak power curve versus
time<00:01:15.969> so<00:01:16.000> for<00:01:16.570> a<00:01:16.630> given<00:01:16.810> duration<00:01:17.259> what's<00:01:18.130> the

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
time so for a given duration what's the

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.330 
time so for a given duration what's the
maximum<00:01:18.700> power<00:01:19.030> that<00:01:19.810> you<00:01:19.899> averaged<00:01:20.439> for<00:01:21.219> that

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
maximum power that you averaged for that

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.029 
maximum power that you averaged for that
duration<00:01:21.789> over<00:01:22.240> the<00:01:22.359> course<00:01:22.570> of<00:01:22.689> the<00:01:22.780> ride

00:01:23.029 --> 00:01:23.039 
duration over the course of the ride

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:25.380 
duration over the course of the ride
which<00:01:24.039> is<00:01:24.070> a<00:01:24.189> pretty<00:01:24.460> useful<00:01:24.670> graph<00:01:25.119> to<00:01:25.359> look

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
which is a pretty useful graph to look

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:26.840 
which is a pretty useful graph to look
at<00:01:25.689> it<00:01:25.869> tells<00:01:26.079> you<00:01:26.200> whether<00:01:26.350> you're<00:01:26.590> getting

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
at it tells you whether you're getting

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.090 
at it tells you whether you're getting
faster<00:01:27.850> for<00:01:28.659> slow<00:01:28.929> durations<00:01:29.380> or<00:01:29.560> faster<00:01:29.950> for

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
faster for slow durations or faster for

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.130 
faster for slow durations or faster for
longer<00:01:30.159> durations<00:01:30.939> and<00:01:31.179> kind<00:01:31.810> of<00:01:31.869> helps<00:01:32.049> you

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
longer durations and kind of helps you

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.080 
longer durations and kind of helps you
figure<00:01:32.380> out<00:01:32.409> if<00:01:32.649> you're<00:01:32.829> if<00:01:33.310> you're<00:01:33.369> improving

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
figure out if you're if you're improving

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.999 
figure out if you're if you're improving
in<00:01:34.270> the<00:01:34.569> right<00:01:34.780> areas<00:01:35.259> depending<00:01:35.649> on<00:01:35.770> the<00:01:35.859> type

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:36.009 
in the right areas depending on the type

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:38.160 
in the right areas depending on the type
of<00:01:36.039> racing<00:01:36.549> that<00:01:36.670> you<00:01:36.789> do<00:01:36.939> so<00:01:37.810> this<00:01:37.899> is<00:01:37.960> the

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
of racing that you do so this is the

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:39.690 
of racing that you do so this is the
summary<00:01:38.560> view<00:01:38.590> then<00:01:39.159> I'll<00:01:39.280> let<00:01:39.399> you<00:01:39.520> take<00:01:39.670> a

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
summary view then I'll let you take a

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.149 
summary view then I'll let you take a
look<00:01:39.939> you<00:01:40.810> know<00:01:40.840> just<00:01:41.499> like<00:01:41.649> all<00:01:41.799> of<00:01:41.950> them<00:01:42.100> it

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:42.159 
look you know just like all of them it

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:46.649 
look you know just like all of them it
gives<00:01:42.310> you<00:01:42.460> a<00:01:42.579> basic<00:01:43.109> output<00:01:44.109> versus<00:01:44.950> time<00:01:45.700> for

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
gives you a basic output versus time for

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:48.899 
gives you a basic output versus time for
both<00:01:47.020> power<00:01:47.319> heartrate<00:01:47.920> cadence<00:01:48.369> and<00:01:48.520> speed

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909 
both power heartrate cadence and speed

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:51.779 
both power heartrate cadence and speed
you<00:01:49.179> can<00:01:49.840> also<00:01:49.990> display<00:01:50.499> that<00:01:51.219> the<00:01:51.460> torque

00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:51.789 
you can also display that the torque

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:54.059 
you can also display that the torque
measured<00:01:52.270> at<00:01:52.389> the<00:01:52.420> hub<00:01:52.659> I<00:01:52.960> always<00:01:53.649> take<00:01:53.950> that

00:01:54.059 --> 00:01:54.069 
measured at the hub I always take that

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:56.580 
measured at the hub I always take that
off<00:01:54.219> the<00:01:54.340> graph<00:01:54.549> because<00:01:54.939> it's<00:01:55.439> generally<00:01:56.439> not

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
off the graph because it's generally not

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.599 
off the graph because it's generally not
not<00:01:57.219> a<00:01:57.249> terribly<00:01:57.850> useful<00:01:57.999> thing<00:01:58.420> to<00:01:58.569> look<00:01:58.719> at

00:01:59.599 --> 00:01:59.609 
not a terribly useful thing to look at

00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:02.129 
not a terribly useful thing to look at
and<00:02:00.609> you<00:02:00.969> can<00:02:01.090> again<00:02:01.299> go<00:02:01.479> down<00:02:01.509> here<00:02:01.869> and<00:02:01.990> see

00:02:02.129 --> 00:02:02.139 
and you can again go down here and see

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:04.429 
and you can again go down here and see
the<00:02:02.259> numerical<00:02:02.560> values<00:02:03.159> on<00:02:03.340> each<00:02:03.369> of<00:02:03.670> these

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
the numerical values on each of these

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.109 
the numerical values on each of these
for<00:02:05.439> the<00:02:05.560> different<00:02:05.979> for<00:02:06.909> the<00:02:06.999> different

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
for the different for the different

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:09.210 
for the different for the different
parameters<00:02:07.749> you<00:02:08.440> also<00:02:08.590> have<00:02:08.770> the<00:02:08.890> ability<00:02:09.190> to

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
parameters you also have the ability to

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.980 
parameters you also have the ability to
zoom<00:02:09.340> in<00:02:09.789> so<00:02:10.060> if<00:02:10.179> you<00:02:10.270> want<00:02:10.450> to<00:02:10.539> really<00:02:10.720> pick

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
zoom in so if you want to really pick

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:12.660 
zoom in so if you want to really pick
apart<00:02:11.290> one<00:02:11.560> particular<00:02:12.130> part<00:02:12.370> of<00:02:12.400> the<00:02:12.490> ride

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
apart one particular part of the ride

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:13.559 
apart one particular part of the ride
you<00:02:12.880> can<00:02:13.000> come<00:02:13.210> in<00:02:13.330> and

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
you can come in and

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:18.300 
you can come in and
that<00:02:14.969> so<00:02:15.969> that's<00:02:16.150> power<00:02:16.450> agent<00:02:16.900> it's<00:02:17.349> like<00:02:18.219> I

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
that so that's power agent it's like I

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:19.259 
that so that's power agent it's like I
said<00:02:18.370> probably<00:02:18.609> a<00:02:18.819> little<00:02:18.969> bit<00:02:19.120> more

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:19.269 
said probably a little bit more

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:21.239 
said probably a little bit more
intuitive<00:02:19.569> than<00:02:19.780> the<00:02:20.079> SRM<00:02:20.469> software<00:02:20.950> I<00:02:21.010> think

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:21.249 
intuitive than the SRM software I think

00:02:21.249 --> 00:02:22.860 
intuitive than the SRM software I think
-<00:02:21.340> just<00:02:21.370> for<00:02:22.030> a<00:02:22.060> person<00:02:22.329> to<00:02:22.359> sit<00:02:22.569> down<00:02:22.689> and

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
- just for a person to sit down and

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.959 
- just for a person to sit down and
start<00:02:23.049> using<00:02:23.200> it<00:02:23.439> right<00:02:23.560> away<00:02:23.620> one<00:02:24.489> thing<00:02:24.519> that

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:24.969 
start using it right away one thing that

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:27.239 
start using it right away one thing that
it<00:02:25.689> does<00:02:25.930> lack<00:02:26.170> though<00:02:26.409> is<00:02:26.530> that<00:02:26.680> ability<00:02:26.889> to

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:27.249 
it does lack though is that ability to

00:02:27.249 --> 00:02:30.390 
it does lack though is that ability to
aggregate<00:02:27.400> data<00:02:27.939> over<00:02:28.950> over<00:02:29.950> the<00:02:30.099> entire

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
aggregate data over over the entire

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.190 
aggregate data over over the entire
season<00:02:30.849> and<00:02:30.939> over<00:02:31.150> multiple<00:02:31.540> days<00:02:31.719> or<00:02:32.019> weeks

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
season and over multiple days or weeks

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.860 
season and over multiple days or weeks
or<00:02:32.379> months<00:02:32.439> so<00:02:32.920> it<00:02:33.069> doesn't<00:02:33.540> seem<00:02:34.540> to<00:02:34.629> provide

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
or months so it doesn't seem to provide

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.649 
or months so it doesn't seem to provide
as<00:02:34.959> many<00:02:35.079> tools<00:02:35.459> or<00:02:36.459> features<00:02:37.060> to<00:02:37.239> help<00:02:37.389> you<00:02:37.510> do

00:02:37.649 --> 00:02:37.659 
as many tools or features to help you do

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:41.399 
as many tools or features to help you do
that<00:02:37.950> so<00:02:38.950> that's<00:02:39.310> one<00:02:40.299> one<00:02:40.629> minor<00:02:40.840> drawback<00:02:41.260> to

00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:41.409 
that so that's one one minor drawback to

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:45.390 
that so that's one one minor drawback to
this<00:02:41.500> one<00:02:41.709> but<00:02:42.870> nothing<00:02:43.980> maybe<00:02:44.980> not<00:02:45.159> a<00:02:45.189> big

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
this one but nothing maybe not a big

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.909 
this one but nothing maybe not a big
deal<00:02:45.549> them<00:02:45.730> to<00:02:45.969> a<00:02:46.000> lot<00:02:46.150> of<00:02:46.239> users<00:02:46.480> so<00:02:47.319> that's<00:02:47.739> it

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:47.919 
deal them to a lot of users so that's it

00:02:47.919 --> 00:02:50.399 
deal them to a lot of users so that's it
for<00:02:48.069> Power<00:02:48.250> agent<00:02:48.639> and<00:02:49.599> we'll<00:02:49.840> move<00:02:49.959> on<00:02:50.169> now<00:02:50.379> to

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:50.409 
for Power agent and we'll move on now to
