00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
all right part three in this part we

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.610 
all right part three in this part we
would<00:00:04.910> move<00:00:05.910> things<00:00:06.240> around<00:00:06.420> a<00:00:06.839> little<00:00:06.960> bit<00:00:07.259> to

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
would move things around a little bit to

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.459 
would move things around a little bit to
fix<00:00:08.220> the<00:00:08.400> shape<00:00:08.610> of<00:00:08.910> the<00:00:09.059> hand<00:00:09.360> it<00:00:09.960> looks<00:00:10.230> very

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
fix the shape of the hand it looks very

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.660 
fix the shape of the hand it looks very
flat<00:00:10.679> right<00:00:11.160> now<00:00:12.290> you<00:00:13.290> can<00:00:13.500> add<00:00:13.740> details<00:00:14.370> where

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
flat right now you can add details where

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.490 
flat right now you can add details where
you<00:00:14.820> need<00:00:15.030> them<00:00:15.330> but<00:00:15.599> I'm<00:00:16.049> just<00:00:16.320> going<00:00:16.470> to

quickly show you what you need to do

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.050 
quickly show you what you need to do
from<00:00:18.539> this<00:00:18.720> point<00:00:18.840> on<00:00:19.400> if<00:00:20.400> you<00:00:20.580> want<00:00:20.789> you<00:00:20.910> can

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
from this point on if you want you can

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.689 
from this point on if you want you can
continue<00:00:21.270> working<00:00:21.900> with<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:22.980> nervous<00:00:23.369> toggle

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
continue working with the nervous toggle

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.599 
continue working with the nervous toggle
on<00:00:23.939> and<00:00:24.180> if<00:00:24.960> you<00:00:25.109> jump<00:00:25.410> to<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.609> sub-object

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
on and if you jump to the sub-object

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.800 
on and if you jump to the sub-object
mode<00:00:26.820> like<00:00:27.210> say<00:00:27.660> word<00:00:28.650> takes<00:00:28.949> a<00:00:29.160> polygon<00:00:29.810> you

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
mode like say word takes a polygon you

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.430 
mode like say word takes a polygon you
see<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.320> low<00:00:32.279> detail<00:00:32.730> cage<00:00:33.090> on<00:00:33.390> top<00:00:33.780> of<00:00:34.079> the

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
see the low detail cage on top of the

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.639 
see the low detail cage on top of the
smooth<00:00:34.920> version<00:00:35.219> of<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.790> model<00:00:36.180> so<00:00:36.989> sometimes

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
smooth version of the model so sometimes

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.220 
smooth version of the model so sometimes
it<00:00:37.800> makes<00:00:37.980> it<00:00:38.190> a<00:00:38.280> little<00:00:38.489> easier<00:00:39.000> so<00:00:39.180> what<00:00:40.110> you

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
it makes it a little easier so what you

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.680 
it makes it a little easier so what you
can<00:00:40.410> do<00:00:40.590> is<00:00:40.800> start<00:00:43.969> giving<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.090> fingers<00:00:45.539> a

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
can do is start giving the fingers a

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.529 
can do is start giving the fingers a
little<00:00:45.809> bit<00:00:45.989> rotation<00:00:46.890> so<00:00:47.789> let's<00:00:48.270> go<00:00:48.480> ahead

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
little bit rotation so let's go ahead

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.430 
little bit rotation so let's go ahead
and<00:00:48.780> grab<00:00:50.000> the<00:00:51.000> word<00:00:51.180> it<00:00:51.329> sees<00:00:51.539> for<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:51.960> index

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
and grab the word it sees for the index

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:59.750 
and grab the word it sees for the index
finger<00:00:52.860> and<00:00:54.890> get<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.100> rotate<00:00:57.410> and<00:00:58.550> what<00:00:59.550> we

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
finger and get the rotate and what we

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.209 
finger and get the rotate and what we
can<00:00:59.940> do<00:01:00.120> is<00:01:00.480> give<00:01:01.170> it<00:01:01.260> some<00:01:01.469> rotation<00:01:01.980> like

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
can do is give it some rotation like

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.170 
can do is give it some rotation like
that<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:03.290> then<00:01:04.460> move<00:01:05.460> it<00:01:05.610> down<00:01:05.790> I'm<00:01:06.000> going<00:01:06.150> to

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
that and then move it down I'm going to

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.630 
that and then move it down I'm going to
switch<00:01:06.390> back<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.990> view<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:07.560> then<00:01:08.189> move<00:01:08.520> it

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
switch back to the view and then move it

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.910 
switch back to the view and then move it
down<00:01:09.170> like<00:01:10.170> that<00:01:11.060> so<00:01:12.060> yeah<00:01:13.020> that<00:01:13.290> looks<00:01:13.650> good

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
down like that so yeah that looks good

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.899 
down like that so yeah that looks good
so<00:01:13.950> far<00:01:14.460> deselect<00:01:15.360> these<00:01:15.720> guys<00:01:16.159> and<00:01:17.159> maybe

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
so far deselect these guys and maybe

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.440 
so far deselect these guys and maybe
give<00:01:18.240> it<00:01:18.270> a<00:01:18.540> little<00:01:18.869> bit<00:01:19.080> more<00:01:19.290> rotation<00:01:20.450> let

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
give it a little bit more rotation let

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.280 
give it a little bit more rotation let
move<00:01:21.659> it<00:01:21.810> down<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.020> little<00:01:22.259> bit<00:01:22.470> more<00:01:24.290> yeah<00:01:26.270> okay

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
move it down a little bit more yeah okay

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.289 
move it down a little bit more yeah okay
we<00:01:28.290> can<00:01:28.500> repeat<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:28.979> process<00:01:29.189> for<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.060> Johnny

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
we can repeat the process for the Johnny

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.929 
we can repeat the process for the Johnny
Cash<00:01:30.570> finger<00:01:31.049> so<00:01:31.979> let's<00:01:32.340> select<00:01:32.520> these

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
Cash finger so let's select these

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.170 
Cash finger so let's select these
vertices<00:01:33.290> vertices<00:01:34.610> oops<00:01:35.610> I<00:01:35.880> don't<00:01:35.939> need

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
vertices vertices oops I don't need

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.600 
vertices vertices oops I don't need
these<00:01:36.360> guys<00:01:36.829> just<00:01:37.829> make<00:01:38.070> sure<00:01:38.250> you<00:01:38.369> got<00:01:38.549> the

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
these guys just make sure you got the

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:44.240 
these guys just make sure you got the
right<00:01:38.759> selection<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:40.759> rotation<00:01:41.759> first<00:01:43.250> move

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
right selection and rotation first move

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:53.950 
right selection and rotation first move
it<00:01:44.399> down<00:01:46.640> like<00:01:47.640> that<00:01:49.520> deselect<00:01:50.520> these<00:01:50.909> guys

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.270 

and<00:01:54.960> we<00:01:55.140> don't<00:01:55.320> need<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.560> rotate<00:01:55.710> it<00:01:56.009> anymore

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
and we don't need to rotate it anymore

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.399 
and we don't need to rotate it anymore
maybe<00:01:57.030> a<00:01:57.149> little<00:01:57.420> bit<00:01:57.740> okay<00:01:58.740> like<00:01:59.579> that<00:02:00.409> then

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
maybe a little bit okay like that then

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.240 
maybe a little bit okay like that then
move<00:02:01.649> it<00:02:01.770> down<00:02:02.060> something<00:02:03.060> like<00:02:03.240> this<00:02:04.219> okay

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
move it down something like this okay

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.300 
move it down something like this okay
it's<00:02:06.119> looking<00:02:06.450> good<00:02:06.600> so<00:02:06.810> far<00:02:06.920> you<00:02:07.920> can<00:02:07.950> repeat

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
it's looking good so far you can repeat

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.130 
it's looking good so far you can repeat
the<00:02:08.429> process<00:02:08.640> on<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.239> other<00:02:09.270> two<00:02:09.569> fingers<00:02:09.780> I'm

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
the process on the other two fingers I'm

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.940 
the process on the other two fingers I'm
not<00:02:10.319> going<00:02:10.530> to<00:02:10.590> do<00:02:10.679> it<00:02:10.830> here

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
not going to do it here

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:18.510 
not going to do it here
for<00:02:12.730> the<00:02:12.880> thumb<00:02:14.880> this<00:02:15.880> area<00:02:16.620> looks<00:02:17.620> too<00:02:17.890> fat<00:02:18.190> so

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
for the thumb this area looks too fat so

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.750 
for the thumb this area looks too fat so
maybe<00:02:18.940> move<00:02:19.240> these<00:02:19.510> guys<00:02:19.780> out<00:02:20.170> a<00:02:20.530> little<00:02:21.430> bit

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
maybe move these guys out a little bit

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:30.420 
maybe move these guys out a little bit
like<00:02:22.360> this<00:02:23.790> okay<00:02:25.020> and<00:02:26.970> let's<00:02:27.970> see<00:02:29.250> what<00:02:30.250> else

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
like this okay and let's see what else

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:38.370 
like this okay and let's see what else
we<00:02:30.610> can<00:02:30.640> do<00:02:31.050> yeah<00:02:32.050> if<00:02:32.500> we<00:02:33.150> go<00:02:35.610> here<00:02:36.610> and<00:02:37.380> start

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
we can do yeah if we go here and start

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:43.530 
we can do yeah if we go here and start
working<00:02:38.620> on<00:02:38.860> the<00:02:39.040> palm<00:02:40.950> we<00:02:41.950> can<00:02:42.310> grab<00:02:43.270> these

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
working on the palm we can grab these

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:51.120 
working on the palm we can grab these
vertices<00:02:45.180> 1<00:02:46.180> 2<00:02:46.690> 3<00:02:47.459> move<00:02:48.459> them<00:02:48.730> up<00:02:48.910> and<00:02:50.130> just

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
vertices 1 2 3 move them up and just

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.729 
vertices 1 2 3 move them up and just
take<00:02:52.120> the<00:02:52.330> middle<00:02:52.540> one<00:02:52.660> move<00:02:53.140> it<00:02:53.290> up<00:02:53.440> a<00:02:53.590> little

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
take the middle one move it up a little

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:59.550 
take the middle one move it up a little
bit<00:02:53.980> more<00:02:54.330> so<00:02:55.330> we<00:02:55.360> have<00:02:55.510> some<00:02:57.959> some<00:02:58.959> shape<00:02:59.230> here

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
bit more so we have some some shape here

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.580 
bit more so we have some some shape here
we<00:03:00.370> can<00:03:00.580> repeat<00:03:00.910> the<00:03:01.090> process<00:03:01.330> for<00:03:01.870> this<00:03:02.290> guy

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
we can repeat the process for this guy

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.990 
we can repeat the process for this guy
move<00:03:03.220> it<00:03:03.370> up<00:03:03.520> a<00:03:03.700> little<00:03:03.820> bit<00:03:05.700> something<00:03:06.700> like

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
move it up a little bit something like

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.630 
move it up a little bit something like
this<00:03:08.489> okay<00:03:09.959> yeah<00:03:10.959> this<00:03:11.739> is<00:03:11.920> looking<00:03:12.100> good<00:03:12.400> so

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
this okay yeah this is looking good so

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.900 
this okay yeah this is looking good so
far

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
far

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:23.310 
far
and<00:03:16.230> let's<00:03:17.230> see<00:03:21.299> yeah<00:03:22.299> so<00:03:22.570> basically<00:03:22.989> all<00:03:23.140> you

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
and let's see yeah so basically all you

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.979 
and let's see yeah so basically all you
need<00:03:23.560> to<00:03:23.709> do<00:03:23.860> is<00:03:24.070> start<00:03:24.570> moving<00:03:25.570> things<00:03:25.810> around

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
need to do is start moving things around

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:27.630 
need to do is start moving things around
a<00:03:26.230> little<00:03:26.380> bit

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
a little bit

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.820 
a little bit
if<00:03:28.030> you<00:03:28.450> need<00:03:28.690> more<00:03:30.060> geometry<00:03:31.260> for<00:03:32.260> example

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
if you need more geometry for example

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.220 
if you need more geometry for example
say<00:03:33.370> the<00:03:33.670> knuckles

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
say the knuckles

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.090 
say the knuckles
I<00:03:36.090> usually<00:03:37.090> don't<00:03:37.420> bother<00:03:37.720> about<00:03:37.930> it<00:03:38.110> but<00:03:38.560> yeah

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
I usually don't bother about it but yeah

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.250 
I usually don't bother about it but yeah
what<00:03:39.340> you<00:03:39.549> can<00:03:39.730> do<00:03:39.880> is<00:03:40.030> start<00:03:40.810> adding<00:03:41.110> more

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
what you can do is start adding more

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.330 
what you can do is start adding more
details<00:03:42.900> for<00:03:43.900> example<00:03:43.959> we<00:03:44.620> can<00:03:44.799> grab<00:03:45.070> these

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
details for example we can grab these

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.860 
details for example we can grab these
four<00:03:45.730> polygons<00:03:47.160> extrude<00:03:48.160> them<00:03:48.400> up<00:03:48.610> a<00:03:49.209> little

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
four polygons extrude them up a little

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:56.789 
four polygons extrude them up a little
bit<00:03:50.580> like<00:03:51.580> that<00:03:51.610> and<00:03:52.530> then<00:03:53.530> scale<00:03:53.950> them<00:03:55.799> like

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:56.799 
bit like that and then scale them like

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:05.060 
bit like that and then scale them like
that<00:04:00.239> maybe<00:04:01.239> too<00:04:01.450> much<00:04:01.630> but<00:04:02.760> you<00:04:03.760> start<00:04:04.120> seeing

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
that maybe too much but you start seeing

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:08.810 
that maybe too much but you start seeing
you<00:04:06.070> know<00:04:06.100> start<00:04:06.880> having<00:04:07.420> some<00:04:07.630> extra

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
you know start having some extra

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.150 
you know start having some extra
polygons<00:04:09.820> to<00:04:10.030> work<00:04:10.209> with<00:04:10.450> so<00:04:11.380> you<00:04:11.440> can<00:04:11.650> do<00:04:11.950> like

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
polygons to work with so you can do like

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:18.270 
polygons to work with so you can do like
that<00:04:12.600> and<00:04:15.329> for<00:04:16.329> the<00:04:16.450> fingers<00:04:16.870> maybe<00:04:17.380> adding<00:04:18.190> a

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
that and for the fingers maybe adding a

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.810 
that and for the fingers maybe adding a
little<00:04:18.459> bit<00:04:18.640> bulge<00:04:19.239> in<00:04:19.630> the<00:04:19.780> first<00:04:20.820> portion

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
little bit bulge in the first portion

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.250 
little bit bulge in the first portion
here<00:04:22.240> is<00:04:22.479> a<00:04:22.539> good<00:04:22.930> idea

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
here is a good idea

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:30.130 
here is a good idea
so<00:04:24.410> you<00:04:25.250> can<00:04:26.230> grab<00:04:27.230> the<00:04:27.440> polygon<00:04:28.690> move<00:04:29.690> it<00:04:29.810> up<00:04:29.960> a

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:30.140 
so you can grab the polygon move it up a

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:37.170 
so you can grab the polygon move it up a
little<00:04:30.260> or<00:04:31.630> actually<00:04:32.630> we<00:04:32.990> should<00:04:33.260> add<00:04:34.720> more

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
little or actually we should add more

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.790 
little or actually we should add more
details<00:04:38.180> so<00:04:38.510> I'm<00:04:38.570> going<00:04:38.810> to<00:04:38.870> just<00:04:39.050> select<00:04:39.230> one

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
details so I'm going to just select one

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:46.120 
details so I'm going to just select one
edge<00:04:39.980> here<00:04:40.780> select<00:04:41.780> ring<00:04:43.180> connect<00:04:44.180> and<00:04:44.810> now<00:04:45.800> I

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
edge here select ring connect and now I

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.220 
edge here select ring connect and now I
have<00:04:46.370> this<00:04:46.550> extra<00:04:46.850> edge<00:04:47.090> to<00:04:47.360> work<00:04:47.510> with<00:04:47.810> I<00:04:48.020> can

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:48.230 
have this extra edge to work with I can

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:50.800 
have this extra edge to work with I can
just<00:04:48.440> grab<00:04:48.710> this<00:04:48.920> edge<00:04:49.190> here<00:04:49.580> and<00:04:50.030> then<00:04:50.570> move

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
just grab this edge here and then move

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:56.230 
just grab this edge here and then move
it<00:04:50.930> up<00:04:51.050> like<00:04:51.620> that<00:04:51.650> so<00:04:55.000> basically<00:04:56.000> all<00:04:56.120> you

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
it up like that so basically all you

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.600 
it up like that so basically all you
need<00:04:56.360> to<00:04:56.570> do<00:04:56.750> is<00:04:56.930> add<00:04:57.230> details<00:04:57.950> where<00:04:58.220> you<00:04:58.400> need

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
need to do is add details where you need

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.140 
need to do is add details where you need
them<00:04:58.850> and<00:04:59.230> just<00:05:00.230> simply<00:05:00.650> start<00:05:01.340> moving<00:05:01.820> the

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:02.150 
them and just simply start moving the

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:06.850 
them and just simply start moving the
points<00:05:02.900> around<00:05:04.300> so<00:05:05.470> depending<00:05:06.470> on<00:05:06.650> how

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
points around so depending on how

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:08.770 
points around so depending on how
detailed<00:05:07.100> the<00:05:07.490> hand<00:05:07.700> you<00:05:08.150> need<00:05:08.360> for<00:05:08.630> the

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:08.780 
detailed the hand you need for the

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.900 
detailed the hand you need for the
character<00:05:09.200> is<00:05:09.470> it<00:05:10.130> really<00:05:10.430> going<00:05:10.610> to<00:05:10.700> be<00:05:10.850> in

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:10.910 
character is it really going to be in

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:13.120 
character is it really going to be in
focus<00:05:11.150> or<00:05:11.510> not<00:05:11.540> or<00:05:11.990> is<00:05:12.110> it<00:05:12.230> something<00:05:12.500> you<00:05:12.860> just

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.130 
focus or not or is it something you just

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:15.580 
focus or not or is it something you just
need<00:05:13.370> to<00:05:13.610> have<00:05:14.480> which<00:05:14.780> looks<00:05:15.080> a<00:05:15.200> little<00:05:15.320> bit

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590 
need to have which looks a little bit

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:18.700 
need to have which looks a little bit
realistic<00:05:16.150> so<00:05:17.150> my<00:05:17.810> only<00:05:18.080> advice<00:05:18.170> at<00:05:18.560> this

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710 
realistic so my only advice at this

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:20.590 
realistic so my only advice at this
point<00:05:19.010> would<00:05:19.190> be<00:05:19.220> spend<00:05:19.790> whatever<00:05:20.090> time<00:05:20.270> you

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:20.600 
point would be spend whatever time you

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.400 
point would be spend whatever time you
need<00:05:20.750> to<00:05:20.930> and<00:05:22.030> save<00:05:23.030> the<00:05:23.360> hand<00:05:23.720> as<00:05:23.960> a<00:05:23.990> separate

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:24.410 
need to and save the hand as a separate

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:27.640 
need to and save the hand as a separate
file<00:05:24.760> you<00:05:25.760> can<00:05:25.970> use<00:05:26.030> the<00:05:26.480> same<00:05:26.780> hand<00:05:27.080> on<00:05:27.260> all<00:05:27.290> of

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:27.650 
file you can use the same hand on all of

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:30.970 
file you can use the same hand on all of
your<00:05:27.770> characters<00:05:28.310> and<00:05:29.290> you<00:05:30.290> don't<00:05:30.440> need<00:05:30.590> to<00:05:30.770> do

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:30.980 
your characters and you don't need to do

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.610 
your characters and you don't need to do
it<00:05:31.010> again<00:05:31.760> and<00:05:31.940> again<00:05:32.470> thanks<00:05:33.470> for<00:05:33.530> watching

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:33.620 
it again and again thanks for watching

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:37.840 
it again and again thanks for watching
and<00:05:34.280> I'll<00:05:35.090> see<00:05:35.390> you<00:05:35.480> next<00:05:35.540> time
