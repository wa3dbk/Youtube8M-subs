00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.020 
the lens away like a laser and then that
comes<00:02:12.150> out<00:02:12.560> the<00:02:13.560> rest<00:02:13.860> of<00:02:14.100> the<00:02:14.220> shield<00:02:14.550> starts

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
comes out the rest of the shield starts

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.240 
comes out the rest of the shield starts
to<00:02:15.180> kind<00:02:15.300> of<00:02:15.420> act<00:02:15.630> like<00:02:15.840> a<00:02:15.870> regular<00:02:16.110> frame<00:02:16.860> for

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
to kind of act like a regular frame for

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.100 
to kind of act like a regular frame for
other<00:02:17.400> glasses<00:02:17.970> because<00:02:18.210> the<00:02:18.510> lenses<00:02:18.900> then

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
other glasses because the lenses then

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.680 
other glasses because the lenses then
get<00:02:19.290> mounted<00:02:19.680> into<00:02:19.800> that<00:02:20.070> frame<00:02:20.760> or<00:02:21.270> into<00:02:21.570> the

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
get mounted into that frame or into the

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.010 
get mounted into that frame or into the
holes<00:02:21.990> into<00:02:22.260> that<00:02:22.470> shield<00:02:23.060> like<00:02:24.060> this<00:02:24.330> so

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
holes into that shield like this so

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.410 
holes into that shield like this so
there<00:02:25.230> you<00:02:25.380> can<00:02:25.410> kind<00:02:25.680> of<00:02:25.800> see<00:02:26.040> exactly<00:02:26.760> what

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
there you can kind of see exactly what

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.070 
there you can kind of see exactly what
I'm<00:02:27.660> talking<00:02:28.170> about<00:02:28.440> as<00:02:28.680> far<00:02:28.710> as<00:02:29.190> the<00:02:30.080> embedded

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
I'm talking about as far as the embedded

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.220 
I'm talking about as far as the embedded
lenses<00:02:31.650> so<00:02:32.070> first<00:02:32.850> off<00:02:33.120> let's<00:02:33.270> just<00:02:33.630> talk

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230

lenses so first off let's just talk
about<00:02:34.260> the<00:02:34.590> elephant<00:02:34.860> in<00:02:35.100> the<00:02:35.160> room<00:02:35.240> it's<00:02:36.240> kind

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
about the elephant in the room it's kind

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:37.010 
about the elephant in the room it's kind
of<00:02:36.540> ugly

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
of ugly

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.800 
of ugly
well<00:02:37.430> maybe<00:02:38.430> ugly<00:02:38.880> isn't<00:02:39.000> the<00:02:39.210> term<00:02:39.450> but<00:02:39.690> it's

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
well maybe ugly isn't the term but it's

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.810 
well maybe ugly isn't the term but it's
very<00:02:40.050> high-tech<00:02:40.500> looking<00:02:41.160> to<00:02:41.340> say<00:02:41.490> the<00:02:41.640> least

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
very high-tech looking to say the least

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.430 
very high-tech looking to say the least
I<00:02:42.000> actually<00:02:42.240> have<00:02:42.600> had<00:02:42.690> customers<00:02:43.260> that

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
I actually have had customers that

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.470 
I actually have had customers that
really<00:02:43.980> like<00:02:44.250> this<00:02:44.460> idea<00:02:44.670> and<00:02:45.000> it<00:02:45.240> actually

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
really like this idea and it actually

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.540 
really like this idea and it actually
looks<00:02:45.900> cool<00:02:46.200> this<00:02:46.800> is<00:02:46.980> definitely<00:02:47.280> not<00:02:47.490> my

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
looks cool this is definitely not my

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.449 
looks cool this is definitely not my
prescription<00:02:48.860> thinks<00:02:49.860> it<00:02:50.010> thinks<00:02:50.310> it<00:02:50.430> looks

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
prescription thinks it thinks it looks

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.400

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
cool and they even do it in clear just

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.020 
cool and they even do it in clear just
to<00:02:52.470> have<00:02:52.590> some<00:02:52.800> funky<00:02:53.220> everyday<00:02:53.580> eyeglasses

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
to me it's definitely a very high-tech

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.210 
to me it's definitely a very high-tech
look<00:02:57.180> so<00:02:57.870> let's<00:02:58.320> say<00:02:58.500> you<00:02:58.560> get<00:02:58.800> past<00:02:59.040> the

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
look so let's say you get past the

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
to get these in glasses functionally

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.440 
to get these in glasses functionally
this<00:03:03.720> works<00:03:04.200> amazingly<00:03:05.160> well<00:03:05.459> they're<00:03:05.880> super

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
this works amazingly well they're super

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.480 
this works amazingly well they're super
durable<00:03:06.690> the<00:03:07.200> lenses<00:03:07.530> are<00:03:07.680> in<00:03:07.800> there<00:03:07.950> very

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
again I'll make this kind of my personal

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.220 
again I'll make this kind of my personal
point<00:04:54.700> I<00:04:54.970> think<00:04:55.510> they<00:04:55.570> look<00:04:55.750> kind<00:04:55.990> of<00:04:56.050> weird

point I think they look kind of weird

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:58.950 
point I think they look kind of weird
but<00:04:56.530> they<00:04:56.680> work<00:04:56.890> really<00:04:56.920> well<00:04:57.370> so<00:04:57.760> that's<00:04:58.720> just

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
but they work really well so that's just

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.780 
but they work really well so that's just
something<00:04:59.110> to<00:04:59.260> kind<00:04:59.470> of<00:04:59.590> think<00:04:59.770> about<00:04:59.860> the

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:00.790 
something to kind of think about the

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:03.600 
something to kind of think about the
radar<00:05:01.780> Eevee's<00:05:02.380> and<00:05:02.710> prescription<00:05:03.370> are
