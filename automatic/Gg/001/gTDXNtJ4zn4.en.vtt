00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 hey people welcome to a new one 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.480
 video and today I'll say how to get in 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.170
 minecraft manila such holograms here 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.200
 can create 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.210
 these are just text lines here 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.230
 in the world around hover as it can be 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.049
 enter a text here 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.640
 as you want and of course with 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.289
 any color codes you want that 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.199
 all here again, for example, in red 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.519
 and the whole thing works well with pmg 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.710
 you can see them in minecraft here 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.400
 can import and as a hologram here 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.560
 in the world 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.510
 The whole thing can also be inserted here 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.430
 still animate and how the whole 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.640
 that works out after the show 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.640
 intro 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.559
 so I am again and yes 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.329
 I 'm just a new world 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.379
 because I changed the coordinates here 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.500
 can be better 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.870
 because I am at the coordinates 0 10 0 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.210
 and just the coordinates I have to 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.440
 remember because exactly to these coordinates 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:07.950
 the hologram will be stretched later and 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:09.840
 then we go it first in embedded so 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.220
 I'm already embedded again 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.619
 So I 've got a blog 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.750
 where the whole thing is spurred on 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.910
 should at the coordinates 0 10 0 like 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.250
 said and then I go down here 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.330
 filter you need the hologram before 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.380
 filter of course in the 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.509
 description is linked 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.100
 and when the whole is downloaded and 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.929
 have installed then just go here 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.280
 here on text mode so make one 

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:31.770
 hook in text mode pure 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.570
 leave the frames together because that is 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.690
 yes no no animation but easy 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.979
 just a single picture so a text alpha 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.800
 com let out that it only for 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.750
 pictures in charge and in this text 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:46.050
 can just enter a text 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.550
 yes the stop later than hologram here 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.990
 should be visible I give it here 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.329
 Just let it go here 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.590
 Just that's a hologram you 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.909
 Of course you can also color codes here 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.700
 but I'll just leave it here 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.860
 we can do enough with universe 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.869
 since you do not have to kick it because 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:05.310
 that is true only of animations exactly 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:06.840
 as with late xl1 pacing celebrity not synonymous 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.619
 because that's just a text 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.880
 a leyen 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.370
 and we do not need more than one 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:15.420
 but the 1 and finally the 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.110
 coordinates xyz as I said 0 10 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.239
 and 0 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.420
 Just leave the others like that and 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:23.400
 click here on filter already there 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.250
 what has formed so this park 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.859
 manno bell and that's it 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.290
 I'm on control and press it and 

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:32.670
 it can be stored back in so 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.250
 minecraft so we see here already 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:38.040
 These bell have formed and 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.230
 is just a redstone signal so 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.549
 to some a torch and placed 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.560
 here on this cross blog 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:46.380
 then we'll see under these 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.570
 redstone stuff has become this hologram 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.920
 formed exactly that could be here now 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.109
 just run away that Baumann not even 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.560
 not anymore and that exists 

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:55.450
 just keep it up here 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.430
 and even if we lift and barns too 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.239
 at the server, for example, a disk 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.140
 just received 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:03.760
 and then we have such a hologram like that 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.500
 if the whole thing is still one with one 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.200
 So want to make a picture with 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.019
 a png picture what just in 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.380
 any image editing program 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:13.330
 have created 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.849
 then we can do it all in here too 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.319
 Minecraft by just like her 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:19.330
 here at this hologram the 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:21.459
 Remember coordinate here and then immediately 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.290
 again by ending change so but 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:25.450
 before we need to change tent 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.299
 now first of all these folders where the whole 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.709
 program is saved because 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:33.280
 We'll just go the folder 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:35.260
 where filters fund and tool icons and so on 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.780
 what is in it and create here 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.720
 just times the folder frames and in 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.250
 this folder just create me one 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.370
 picture file here for example my head 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:47.019
 in the dimensions 808 pixels I have just 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.060
 Of course you can take the measurements 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:50.799
 but you always have to 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.239
 also watch out that the whole pixel for 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:54.640
 pixel is displayed in minecraft 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:55.660
 and that should not be as big as 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.579
 I had it here you take a my 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.930
 taken head and the hair are black 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:01.959
 because that does not appear otherwise 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:04.390
 can minecraft and yes I have 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:07.329
 just pasted here and frame one 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:10.269
 called blank and so on 

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:12.940
 Now I have this blog again 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:15.100
 marked and am in filters and this time 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.870
 we can do this in image mode 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.959
 insert hook and text model 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.549
 make out hooks while frames 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.620
 can we leave the whole thing at 1 ? 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:25.750
 we only have one frame if you have one 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.530
 Now if you make an animation 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:31.180
 of course you can of course the pictures in 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.720
 So divide frames before 1 2 3 and 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.340
 4 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.600
 and so on and I have it easy 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.620
 just taken a frame because it's easy 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.180
 just a picture should be 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:42.100
 alpha describes the whole thing on the whole 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:43.450
 should be square or so if you 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:47.250
 for example, if there is a gap in it 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:48.900
 a pixel not with one with color 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.620
 is filled out if the whole 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.360
 should be squeezed together or 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.650
 Not 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.350
 I can not do that, though 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:57.940
 good at text mode is actually 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:59.560
 no matter he will not use the loop 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.360
 if the animation is always 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.979
 should be played or not if 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.430
 the whole thing should be played then 

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:05.540
 Makes her hook in I am 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:08.150
 not so with me it is actually 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:11.960
 no matter because I have only one picture anyway 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:14.450
 latics is just in which time as the 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:16.690
 next frame should be played the 

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:21.080
 tics holding one second is 20 by the way 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:23.870
 26 ticks and alone spacing is here 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:25.820
 you can do it pretty well 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:28.340
 do not put up with that too 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:30.830
 individual lines stop more distance 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:33.950
 Here we agree the coordinates here 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:37.550
 there is only 0 10 -20 1 here so that 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:38.990
 has a bit of a gap and as before 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:40.880
 you can leave the rest here as well 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:42.770
 I went to filter and lead the came 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.910
 so back in minecraft we see here 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:47.360
 already there they have commander bridge again 

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:48.830
 formed and earlier also have as here 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.150
 we lock a quartz where just 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:50.360
 a fairly simple place 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:52.520
 got to 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:55.220
 I'll just do that and we'll see 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:56.030
 already back there was the picture yes 

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.710
 create 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:58.970
 You see you already this fashion is not 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:00.200
 perfectly perfect so there should be 

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:02.090
 be a white pixel 

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:04.130
 that somehow always wrong but 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:05.660
 I do not know why but everyone 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:07.880
 case could be your own here now 

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:10.250
 animations and pictures taken the 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.450
 insert texts here in minecraft that 

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:12.140
 we do not need to do anything again 

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:15.320
 chip off 

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:16.700
 and yes that was it in the reason already 

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.680
 If you liked it I would 

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:20.650
 Of course, as always about a like 

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:23.650
 happy and see you next time 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:23.650
 and
