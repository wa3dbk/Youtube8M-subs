00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.699 
course they still function just fine now
they<00:03:04.530> also<00:03:04.680> have<00:03:04.830> anti<00:03:05.340> soap<00:03:05.580> followers

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
they also have anti soap followers

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:10.210 
they also have anti soap followers
usually<00:03:07.709> I'm<00:03:07.800> just<00:03:07.860> pressing<00:03:08.160> on<00:03:08.400> the<00:03:08.489> front

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
usually I'm just pressing on the front

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.240 
usually I'm just pressing on the front
they<00:03:11.220> don't<00:03:11.400> tilt<00:03:11.610> at<00:03:11.790> all<00:03:11.910> and<00:03:12.920> they<00:03:13.920> actually

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
they don't tilt at all and they actually

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.340 
they don't tilt at all and they actually
have<00:03:14.400> kind<00:03:14.610> of<00:03:14.700> like<00:03:14.850> a<00:03:14.880> bullet<00:03:15.390> tip<00:03:15.570> so<00:03:16.200> it's

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
have kind of like a bullet tip so it's

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:17.720 
have kind of like a bullet tip so it's
very<00:03:16.500> easy<00:03:16.620> to<00:03:16.950> know<00:03:17.190> which<00:03:17.400> way<00:03:17.579> you're

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
very easy to know which way you're

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.960 
very easy to know which way you're
putting<00:03:17.970> your<00:03:18.209> your<00:03:18.930> rounds<00:03:19.320> in<00:03:19.730> the<00:03:20.730> feed

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
putting your your rounds in the feed

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:26.120 
putting your your rounds in the feed
lips<00:03:21.180> are<00:03:21.750> low<00:03:22.370> which<00:03:23.370> adds<00:03:24.360> to<00:03:24.690> I<00:03:25.260> don't<00:03:26.070> know

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
lips are low which adds to I don't know

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.460 
lips are low which adds to I don't know
they<00:03:26.280> it<00:03:26.489> makes<00:03:26.640> it<00:03:26.790> more<00:03:26.910> rigid<00:03:27.090> it<00:03:28.079> makes<00:03:28.320> it

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
they it makes it more rigid it makes it

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.590 
they it makes it more rigid it makes it
so<00:03:28.590> these<00:03:28.739> aren't<00:03:28.920> gonna<00:03:29.190> spread<00:03:30.060> as<00:03:30.209> much<00:03:30.390> if

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
so these aren't gonna spread as much if

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.080 
so these aren't gonna spread as much if
they<00:03:30.720> were<00:03:30.810> a<00:03:30.870> little<00:03:31.049> bit<00:03:31.140> higher<00:03:31.350> and<00:03:32.090> the

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
they were a little bit higher and the

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:45.530 
they were a little bit higher and the
disassembly<00:03:33.540> is<00:03:33.810> really<00:03:34.079> quick<00:03:34.320> too<00:03:44.209> and<00:03:45.209> the

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
disassembly is really quick too and the

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.690 
disassembly is really quick too and the
benefit<00:03:45.900> to<00:03:45.989> that<00:03:46.019> of<00:03:46.290> course<00:03:46.440> is<00:03:46.709> that<00:03:46.860> not

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
benefit to that of course is that not

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.130 
benefit to that of course is that not
only<00:03:47.790> is<00:03:47.970> it<00:03:48.120> easy<00:03:48.329> to<00:03:48.450> do<00:03:48.630> you<00:03:48.750> don't<00:03:48.900> need<00:03:49.049> any

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
only is it easy to do you don't need any

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:50.300 
only is it easy to do you don't need any
tools<00:03:49.410> but<00:03:49.739> then<00:03:49.920> with<00:03:50.040> them<00:03:50.190> being

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
tools but then with them being

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:51.890 
tools but then with them being
translucent<00:03:51.030> you<00:03:51.090> can<00:03:51.239> really<00:03:51.480> see<00:03:51.660> where<00:03:51.750> the

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
translucent you can really see where the

00:03:51.900 --> 00:04:00.280 
translucent you can really see where the
dirt<00:03:52.110> is<00:03:52.260> if<00:03:52.440> you<00:03:52.530> want<00:03:52.709> to<00:03:52.769> clean<00:03:52.980> them<00:03:53.100> out

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:07.840 

they<00:04:01.290> really<00:04:01.440> go<00:04:01.650> on<00:04:01.799> and<00:04:01.980> off<00:04:02.070> very<00:04:02.310> easily

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:07.850 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:13.430 

long<00:04:08.850> as<00:04:08.940> you<00:04:09.000> got<00:04:09.090> it<00:04:09.209> lined<00:04:09.390> up<00:04:09.510> correctly

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.069 

but<00:04:14.440> anyway<00:04:15.220> just<00:04:15.459> a<00:04:16.180> real<00:04:16.359> quick<00:04:16.570> look<00:04:16.750> at<00:04:16.959> the

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:17.079 
but anyway just a real quick look at the

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:19.860 
but anyway just a real quick look at the
elite<00:04:17.320> tactical<00:04:17.560> systems<00:04:18.190> magazines<00:04:18.790> I<00:04:19.090> will

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
elite tactical systems magazines I will

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.569 
elite tactical systems magazines I will
be<00:04:20.019> doing<00:04:20.199> more<00:04:20.470> testing<00:04:20.919> with<00:04:21.040> these<00:04:21.250> and

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:21.579 
be doing more testing with these and

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:25.620 
be doing more testing with these and
hopefully<00:04:21.940> some<00:04:22.360> more<00:04:24.090> durability<00:04:25.090> testing<00:04:25.510> I

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
hopefully some more durability testing I

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.300 
hopefully some more durability testing I
guess<00:04:25.810> you<00:04:25.900> could<00:04:26.050> say<00:04:26.080> so<00:04:26.710> -<00:04:26.770> be<00:04:26.889> sure<00:04:26.919> to<00:04:27.160> look

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
guess you could say so - be sure to look

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.150 
guess you could say so - be sure to look
forward<00:04:27.610> to<00:04:27.729> more<00:04:28.590> testing<00:04:29.590> and<00:04:29.650> evaluating

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
forward to more testing and evaluating

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.060 
forward to more testing and evaluating
of<00:04:30.520> these<00:04:31.090> magazines<00:04:31.500> anyway<00:04:32.530> elite<00:04:32.860> tactical
