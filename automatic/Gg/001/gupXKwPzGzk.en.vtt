to start you on your weak hand so

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:57.090 
to start you on your weak hand so
remember<00:04:55.720> you<00:04:55.840> can<00:04:55.960> add<00:04:56.200> Dill's<00:04:56.590> or<00:04:56.919> two

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:57.100 
remember you can add Dill's or two

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.010 
remember you can add Dill's or two
consecutive<00:04:57.430> strokes<00:04:57.940> with<00:04:58.210> one<00:04:58.419> hand<00:04:58.720> to
