00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:03.800 

why<00:00:01.079> have<00:00:01.350> is<00:00:01.589> some<00:00:02.040> barium<00:00:02.700> hydroxide<00:00:03.000> okay

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
why have is some barium hydroxide okay

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.809 
why have is some barium hydroxide okay
I'm<00:00:03.959> gonna<00:00:04.110> put<00:00:04.259> this<00:00:04.350> into<00:00:04.529> me<00:00:04.770> if<00:00:05.490> I<00:00:05.640> know

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
I'm gonna put this into me if I know

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:06.889 
I'm gonna put this into me if I know
what<00:00:05.940> I'm<00:00:06.000> gonna<00:00:06.089> do<00:00:06.210> this<00:00:06.330> in<00:00:06.450> one<00:00:06.540> a<00:00:06.569> because

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
what I'm gonna do this in one a because

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:08.240 
what I'm gonna do this in one a because
not<00:00:07.049> my<00:00:07.140> things<00:00:07.379> is<00:00:07.529> what<00:00:07.680> it<00:00:07.770> is

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
not my things is what it is

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.950 
not my things is what it is
I<00:00:08.280> don't<00:00:08.820> hydroxide<00:00:09.240> and<00:00:09.450> I've<00:00:09.540> got<00:00:09.719> some

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
I don't hydroxide and I've got some

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.049 
I don't hydroxide and I've got some
ammonium<00:00:10.710> chloride<00:00:10.889> know<00:00:11.670> what<00:00:11.790> I<00:00:11.820> want<00:00:11.940> to<00:00:12.000> do

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
ammonium chloride know what I want to do

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.270 
ammonium chloride know what I want to do
is<00:00:12.179> mix<00:00:12.360> these<00:00:12.509> together<00:00:12.719> and<00:00:13.349> hopefully<00:00:14.160> we

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
is mix these together and hopefully we

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.090 
is mix these together and hopefully we
should<00:00:14.309> send<00:00:14.700> a<00:00:15.410> endothermic<00:00:16.410> reaction<00:00:17.150> yes

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:19.100 
should send a endothermic reaction yes

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.890 
should send a endothermic reaction yes
what<00:00:20.100> hand<00:00:20.250> stuff<00:00:20.460> the<00:00:20.789> hand<00:00:21.000> sanitizer

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
what hand stuff the hand sanitizer

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.050 
what hand stuff the hand sanitizer
oh<00:00:21.930> it<00:00:22.170> just<00:00:22.350> lives<00:00:22.650> on<00:00:22.710> my<00:00:22.800> desk<00:00:23.010> I<00:00:23.250> was

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
oh it just lives on my desk I was

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.000 
oh it just lives on my desk I was
chopping<00:00:24.210> up<00:00:24.420> hearts<00:00:24.720> earlier<00:00:25.050> yeah<00:00:25.650> I<00:00:25.830> need

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
chopping up hearts earlier yeah I need

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.820 
chopping up hearts earlier yeah I need
to<00:00:26.099> be<00:00:26.189> not<00:00:26.369> coming<00:00:26.820> in<00:00:26.880> again<00:00:27.080> so<00:00:28.080> what<00:00:28.500> I<00:00:28.529> do

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
to be not coming in again so what I do

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.400 
to be not coming in again so what I do
to<00:00:29.220> show<00:00:29.269> how<00:00:30.269> exothermic<00:00:30.869> is<00:00:30.990> how<00:00:31.140> much<00:00:31.260> heat

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
to show how exothermic is how much heat

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.359 
to show how exothermic is how much heat
this<00:00:31.500> is<00:00:31.619> taking<00:00:31.830> here<00:00:31.980> now<00:00:32.099> so<00:00:32.219> I'm<00:00:32.279> gonna

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
this is taking here now so I'm gonna

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.569 
this is taking here now so I'm gonna
make<00:00:32.489> this<00:00:32.610> wooden<00:00:32.910> block<00:00:33.149> wet<00:00:33.620> okay<00:00:34.620> now<00:00:35.160> then

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
make this wooden block wet okay now then

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.470 
make this wooden block wet okay now then
you<00:00:36.120> will<00:00:36.149> see<00:00:36.450> why<00:00:36.600> done<00:00:36.780> that<00:00:36.899> in<00:00:36.989> a<00:00:37.079> second

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480 
you will see why done that in a second

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.170 
you will see why done that in a second
so<00:00:39.480> ina<00:00:39.840> mix<00:00:40.050> these<00:00:40.140> two<00:00:40.290> things<00:00:40.320> together<00:00:40.590> and

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
so ina mix these two things together and

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.560 
so ina mix these two things together and
carefully<00:00:42.180> and<00:00:43.579> it<00:00:44.579> makes<00:00:45.120> these<00:00:45.239> sing<00:00:45.390> things

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
carefully and it makes these sing things

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.299 
carefully and it makes these sing things
together<00:00:45.690> well<00:00:46.379> hopefully<00:00:46.649> not<00:00:46.800> as<00:00:47.129> it's

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
together well hopefully not as it's

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.619 
together well hopefully not as it's
blowing<00:00:47.579> up<00:00:47.700> and<00:00:47.910> giving<00:00:48.120> out<00:00:48.210> any<00:00:48.390> amount<00:00:48.570> of

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
blowing up and giving out any amount of

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:49.760 
blowing up and giving out any amount of
energy<00:00:48.840> like<00:00:48.960> that<00:00:49.079> that<00:00:49.289> would<00:00:49.350> be<00:00:49.469> what's<00:00:49.649> up

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
energy like that that would be what's up

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.860 
energy like that that would be what's up
reaction<00:00:50.160> exothermic<00:00:50.789> now<00:00:51.539> we'll<00:00:51.750> see

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
reaction exothermic now we'll see

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.150 
reaction exothermic now we'll see
endothermic<00:00:52.500> just<00:00:52.680> let<00:00:52.800> me<00:00:52.860> let<00:00:52.949> me<00:00:53.010> more

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
endothermic just let me let me more

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.340 
endothermic just let me let me more
subtle<00:00:53.520> so<00:00:53.730> I<00:00:54.300> mix<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.600> brown<00:00:54.719> hydroxide<00:00:55.170> and

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
subtle so I mix the brown hydroxide and

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.229 
subtle so I mix the brown hydroxide and
ammonium<00:00:55.410> chloride<00:00:55.829> together<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:57.120> they

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
ammonium chloride together and they

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.670 
ammonium chloride together and they
should<00:00:57.530> start<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.649> react<00:00:59.690> well<00:01:00.690> we<00:01:01.500> should

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
should start to react well we should

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.130 
should start to react well we should
soon<00:01:01.890> see<00:01:01.920> so<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.059> mixing<00:01:03.239> together<00:01:03.390> now<00:01:03.989> can

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
soon see so the mixing together now can

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.299 
soon see so the mixing together now can
you<00:01:04.229> see<00:01:04.350> how<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.530> consistency<00:01:05.040> of<00:01:05.070> that<00:01:05.129> is

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
you see how the consistency of that is

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.160 
you see how the consistency of that is
changing<00:01:05.790> slightly<00:01:06.060> it's<00:01:06.659> of<00:01:06.780> clumping

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
changing slightly it's of clumping

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.600 
changing slightly it's of clumping
together<00:01:07.320> because<00:01:07.890> one<00:01:08.010> of<00:01:08.070> products<00:01:08.460> it's

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
together because one of products it's

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.030 
together because one of products it's
making<00:01:08.970> is<00:01:09.210> water<00:01:09.869> in<00:01:10.260> this<00:01:10.350> reaction<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:10.979> you

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
making is water in this reaction and you

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.170 
making is water in this reaction and you
can<00:01:11.130> see<00:01:11.220> actually<00:01:11.310> that's<00:01:11.580> all<00:01:11.670> gone<00:01:11.760> liquid

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
can see actually that's all gone liquid

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.060 
can see actually that's all gone liquid
and<00:01:12.659> it<00:01:12.720> was<00:01:12.869> all<00:01:12.990> just<00:01:13.110> solid<00:01:13.320> powders<00:01:13.680> it's

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
and it was all just solid powders it's

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.429 
and it was all just solid powders it's
not<00:01:14.310> milk<00:01:14.549> you<00:01:14.729> wouldn't<00:01:14.909> have<00:01:15.060> done<00:01:15.210> ah

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
not milk you wouldn't have done ah

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.130 
not milk you wouldn't have done ah
Gabe<00:01:16.890> you<00:01:16.979> put<00:01:17.130> on<00:01:17.250> coffee<00:01:17.490> off<00:01:18.049> from<00:01:19.049> being

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
Gabe you put on coffee off from being

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.690 
Gabe you put on coffee off from being
problems<00:01:19.530> now<00:01:19.680> one<00:01:20.009> of<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.159> products<00:01:20.490> of<00:01:20.580> this

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
problems now one of the products of this

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.160 
problems now one of the products of this
because<00:01:21.000> it's<00:01:21.119> ammonium<00:01:21.509> chloride<00:01:21.600> is<00:01:22.020> it's

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
because it's ammonium chloride is it's

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.020 
because it's ammonium chloride is it's
giving<00:01:22.380> off<00:01:22.409> ammonia<00:01:22.860> which<00:01:23.490> smells<00:01:23.790> rather

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
giving off ammonia which smells rather

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.149 
giving off ammonia which smells rather
horrible<00:01:24.330> I<00:01:24.630> forgot<00:01:25.500> about<00:01:25.619> that<00:01:25.710> which<00:01:26.040> is

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
horrible I forgot about that which is

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.850 
horrible I forgot about that which is
why<00:01:26.250> I<00:01:26.280> just<00:01:26.520> breathe<00:01:26.700> they<00:01:27.390> did<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:28.320> that

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
why I just breathe they did and that

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.440 
why I just breathe they did and that
court<00:01:29.549> sort<00:01:29.700> of<00:01:29.759> horrible<00:01:29.939> slightly<00:01:30.240> tangy

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
court sort of horrible slightly tangy

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.679 
court sort of horrible slightly tangy
smelling<00:01:30.960> we<00:01:31.229> is<00:01:31.530> um<00:01:32.040> some<00:01:32.820> ammonia<00:01:33.150> like<00:01:33.450> is

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
smelling we is um some ammonia like is

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.330 
smelling we is um some ammonia like is
that<00:01:33.750> like<00:01:33.900> it<00:01:34.200> yeah<00:01:34.770> that's<00:01:35.040> what<00:01:35.189> you<00:01:35.250> can

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
for me unless you've wet yourself back

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.289 
for me unless you've wet yourself back
okay<00:01:39.450> but<00:01:40.079> also<00:01:40.530> actually<00:01:41.400> I'm<00:01:41.729> this<00:01:42.180> is

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
okay but also actually I'm this is

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.690 
okay but also actually I'm this is
getting<00:01:42.479> at<00:01:42.630> very<00:01:43.020> cold<00:01:43.259> as<00:01:43.470> going<00:01:43.710> a<00:01:43.770> lot<00:01:43.890> okay

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
getting at very cold as going a lot okay

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.090 
getting at very cold as going a lot okay
now<00:01:45.000> hopefully<00:01:45.270> this<00:01:45.689> has<00:01:45.840> worked<00:01:46.110> it's

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
now hopefully this has worked it's

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.190 
now hopefully this has worked it's
getting<00:01:47.340> cold<00:01:47.610> enough<00:01:47.850> well<00:01:48.240> do<00:01:48.899> not<00:01:49.020> put

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
getting cold enough well do not put

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.399 
getting cold enough well do not put
water<00:01:49.409> on<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.100> base<00:01:50.250> there<00:01:50.520> yeah<00:01:51.409> fingers

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
water on the base there yeah fingers

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.130 
water on the base there yeah fingers
crossed<00:01:53.570> it's<00:01:54.570> frozen<00:01:55.470> that<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.130> water<00:01:56.340> on

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
crossed it's frozen that the water on

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.260 
crossed it's frozen that the water on
now<00:01:58.140> this<00:01:58.500> reaction<00:01:58.740> is<00:01:59.189> worked<00:01:59.369> so<00:01:59.610> well<00:01:59.790> so

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
now this reaction is worked so well so

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.700 
now this reaction is worked so well so
much<00:02:00.509> energy<00:02:00.899> is<00:02:00.990> had<00:02:01.110> to<00:02:01.170> be<00:02:01.229> taken<00:02:01.530> out<00:02:01.590> the

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
much energy is had to be taken out the

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.080 
much energy is had to be taken out the
environments<00:02:02.100> call<00:02:02.219> that<00:02:02.310> water<00:02:02.490> so<00:02:02.790> cold

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
environments call that water so cold

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.090 
environments call that water so cold
that<00:02:03.450> dropped<00:02:04.020> below<00:02:04.140> freezing<00:02:04.229> and<00:02:04.799> frozen

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
that dropped below freezing and frozen

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.790 
that dropped below freezing and frozen
onto<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.430> bottom<00:02:06.259> he's<00:02:07.259> pretty<00:02:07.500> cool

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
onto the bottom he's pretty cool

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.700 
onto the bottom he's pretty cool
uh<00:02:09.450> well<00:02:10.450> I'm<00:02:10.600> gonna<00:02:10.690> if<00:02:10.930> I<00:02:11.020> have<00:02:11.290> a<00:02:11.320> floor<00:02:11.620> mat

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
uh well I'm gonna if I have a floor mat

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:12.690 
uh well I'm gonna if I have a floor mat
I'm<00:02:11.830> an<00:02:11.950> absolute<00:02:12.100> liar

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
I'm an absolute liar

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.580 
I'm an absolute liar
so<00:02:12.820> button<00:02:13.090> better<00:02:13.240> there<00:02:13.420> and<00:02:14.020> that<00:02:14.500> is

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
so button better there and that is

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.830 
so button better there and that is
dropping<00:02:14.950> down<00:02:14.980> to<00:02:15.310> well<00:02:15.970> we<00:02:16.300> know<00:02:16.450> it's<00:02:16.600> below

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
dropping down to well we know it's below

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.620 
dropping down to well we know it's below
what<00:02:17.370> 0<00:02:18.370> so<00:02:20.670> this<00:02:21.670> thermometer<00:02:22.120> is<00:02:22.180> calibrated

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
what 0 so this thermometer is calibrated

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.120 
what 0 so this thermometer is calibrated
to<00:02:22.720> minus<00:02:23.020> 10<00:02:23.440> it's<00:02:24.250> shot<00:02:24.640> down<00:02:24.910> to<00:02:25.210> minus<00:02:25.540> 5<00:02:26.130> by

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
to minus 10 it's shot down to minus 5 by

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.530 
to minus 10 it's shot down to minus 5 by
back<00:02:27.340> now<00:02:27.840> um<00:02:29.430> and<00:02:30.430> it's<00:02:30.580> carrying<00:02:30.850> on<00:02:31.090> going

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
back now um and it's carrying on going

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.900 
back now um and it's carrying on going
well<00:02:31.720> if<00:02:31.810> here's<00:02:31.960> our<00:02:32.050> fingers<00:02:32.460> if<00:02:33.460> you<00:02:33.520> had<00:02:33.760> on

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
well if here's our fingers if you had on

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.250 
well if here's our fingers if you had on
there<00:02:34.000> yeah<00:02:34.180> we<00:02:34.360> start<00:02:34.570> to<00:02:34.660> write<00:02:35.020> in<00:02:35.110> fact

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
there yeah we start to write in fact

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.480 
there yeah we start to write in fact
there's<00:02:35.380> actually<00:02:35.470> ice<00:02:35.710> crystals<00:02:36.130> forming<00:02:36.400> on

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
there's actually ice crystals forming on

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:41.700 
there's actually ice crystals forming on
this<00:02:36.580> one<00:02:37.830> ya<00:02:38.830> know
