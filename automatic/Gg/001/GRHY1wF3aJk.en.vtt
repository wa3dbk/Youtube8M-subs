so<00:00:50.010> there<00:00:50.190> I<00:00:50.340> just<00:00:50.550> wanted<00:00:50.789> you<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:51.030> know<00:00:51.210> that

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
so there I just wanted you to know that

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.229 
so there I just wanted you to know that
there's<00:00:52.289> nothing<00:00:52.590> wrong<00:00:53.010> with<00:00:53.070> having<00:00:53.640> many

there's nothing wrong with having many

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.330 
there's nothing wrong with having many
instruments<00:00:54.660> in<00:00:54.989> fact<00:00:55.320> if<00:00:55.500> you<00:00:55.620> see<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.010> stats

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
instruments in fact if you see the stats

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.130 
instruments in fact if you see the stats
on<00:00:56.579> it<00:00:56.670> I<00:00:56.760> think<00:00:56.820> Dearing<00:00:57.300> has<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.660> stats<00:00:57.960> on

on it I think Dearing has the stats on

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.849 
on it I think Dearing has the stats on
it<00:00:58.170> of<00:00:58.590> about<00:00:59.010> how<00:00:59.340> many<00:00:59.609> how<00:01:00.329> many<00:01:00.859> banjos
