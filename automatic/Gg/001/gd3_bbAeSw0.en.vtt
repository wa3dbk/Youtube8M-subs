00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.580
 hi girls I hope you go 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.410
 well I find you today with 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.020
 a hairdressing tutorial that's going to be really 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.760
 very very easy so like the tutorial 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.050
 previous it's going to be really at the 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.450
 everyone's reach I told myself 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.590
 down since only the previous tutorial that 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:28.939
 you liked it I thought why not 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.710
 stay a little in simplicity 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:32.300
 so here it is going to be really very very 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.890
 easy you will see and I leave you 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.690
 with the little top of the hill 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.100
 so to start the place where 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.600
 find your rey does not really 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.940
 of importance as you can see 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.710
 dominate slightly on the started side 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.489
 to take a snow under the front and 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:48.140
 start twisting and backwards 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:51.019
 added another wick that is found 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.589
 around the face and continue twisting 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:53.589
 and damaged 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.559
 add another wick continue to 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.559
 to work 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.049
 and so on until you reach 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.049
 the back of your ear 

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:16.399
 then put your twists on the back 

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:19.130
 your head is attached to it with the help of 

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:20.570
 pliers no matter how you 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:25.130
 put since they will be removed then 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:26.960
 so do not worry and so do 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.799
 exactly the same on the other side 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.530
 of your head 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:34.369
 then put your second twist on 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:36.579
 the back and remove the clamps from everything 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:36.579
 on time 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.480
 gather the twists 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.150
 and tie the sets with a 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.150
 transparent elastic 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.150
 then separate your hair in three 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.150
 equal parts 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.600
 past the two parts at the ends 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.400
 Front 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:16.300
 and began to squeeze the first 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:18.910
 part between is this normal to three arms 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.290
 tied with a transparent elastic and 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:27.220
 do the same thing for the other two 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:28.900
 left then for the middle part I 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.460
 starts to squeeze in the back and I 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.960
 ends on the front class is enough 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:35.140
 difficult to train to the end 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:37.120
 the back and so I had spent 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.680
 wicks underneath each time instead 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.240
 from above since matray was 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.000
 returned as I pass them on 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:45.870
 the front and finally we 're going 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.640
 simply braid the 3 13 together 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:52.780
 to give a very thick and rather 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:55.590
 original especially do not forget to 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.590
 tight every time 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.260
 and if you go back to the front 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.760
 do not forget to train upside down so 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.520
 we spent each time the locks in 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:07.450
 underneath tied it all together and 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.450
 here you are finished
