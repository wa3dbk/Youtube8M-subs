one's<00:02:52.709> actually<00:02:52.919> interesting<00:02:53.639> to<00:02:53.790> look<00:02:53.970> at

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:01.919 
soleil on the movement so a sunburst and

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:03.800 
soleil on the movement so a sunburst and
you<00:03:02.040> can<00:03:02.159> see<00:03:02.280> that<00:03:02.459> the<00:03:02.549> origin<00:03:03.030> is<00:03:03.150> this

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
you can see that the origin is this

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.409 
you can see that the origin is this
iconic<00:03:04.349> balance<00:03:04.950> because<00:03:05.340> digital<00:03:05.760> is<00:03:06.389> the

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:06.419 
iconic balance because digital is the

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:08.809 
iconic balance because digital is the
watchmakers<00:03:07.290> watchmaker<00:03:07.919> so<00:03:08.579> they're<00:03:08.700> gonna

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 
watchmakers watchmaker so they're gonna

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:11.089 
watchmakers watchmaker so they're gonna

side of the disc tapered lugs this watch
is<00:06:50.400> actually<00:06:50.820> very<00:06:51.030> thin<00:06:51.450> for<00:06:51.630> the<00:06:51.690> degree<00:06:51.960> of

is actually very thin for the degree of

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:53.990 
is actually very thin for the degree of

complexity involved and it sits tight

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.370 
complexity involved and it sits tight
against<00:06:54.390> the<00:06:54.420> wrists<00:06:54.750> so<00:06:54.990> there's<00:06:55.290> no

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:55.380 
against the wrists so there's no

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:57.170 
against the wrists so there's no
flopping<00:06:55.980> around<00:06:56.100> a<00:06:56.460> very<00:06:56.670> comfortable

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:00.350 
flopping around a very comfortable
conforms<00:06:58.050> nicely<00:06:58.530> and<00:06:58.710> you<00:06:59.100> can<00:06:59.250> see<00:06:59.520> the

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:00.360 
conforms nicely and you can see the

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:03.740 
conforms nicely and you can see the
watch<00:07:00.570> can<00:07:00.840> actually<00:07:01.580> contour<00:07:02.580> very<00:07:03.270> closely

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:03.750 
watch can actually contour very closely

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:05.840 
watch can actually contour very closely
because<00:07:04.260> it<00:07:04.380> has<00:07:04.500> a<00:07:04.530> very<00:07:04.770> supple<00:07:05.130> strap<00:07:05.400> and

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:05.850 
because it has a very supple strap and

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:07.970 
because it has a very supple strap and
the<00:07:06.330> lugs<00:07:06.540> are<00:07:06.750> drilled<00:07:06.990> relatively<00:07:07.710> low

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:07.980 
the lugs are drilled relatively low

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:10.430 
the lugs are drilled relatively low
close<00:07:08.370> to<00:07:08.400> the<00:07:08.580> wrists<00:07:08.880> so<00:07:09.480> although<00:07:09.780> it's<00:07:10.050> 40

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:10.440 
close to the wrists so although it's 40

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:12.560 
close to the wrists so although it's 40
millimeters<00:07:10.980> it<00:07:11.670> serves<00:07:12.030> well<00:07:12.360> as<00:07:12.540> a

millimeters it serves well as a
traditional<00:07:13.080> dress<00:07:13.350> watch<00:07:13.620> because<00:07:14.280> it

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:14.430 
traditional dress watch because it

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:16.370 
traditional dress watch because it
