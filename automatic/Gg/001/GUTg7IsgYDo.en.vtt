00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.630
 Dad knew where we are, this is it. 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.580
 Hello everyone, how do you know I can 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.190
 dakar chip 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.230
 I'm here because diadema-são paulo de 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.539
 life nor immigrants highway 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:27.579
 immigrants seeking peace 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:30.519
 two colleagues or friends shout there 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:35.140
 stoudemire luiz we are doing a test 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:36.309
 no versa 2012 1.6 have just installed the 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.980
 chip 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:46.420
 There are differences here, but I get 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:46.420
 foot highway 15 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:51.870
 we just passed that block one 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.760
 and the way he told me that the 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.800
 motor gives a little more agile even 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.510
 because I tell you there to get a 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.550
 quickest response time you 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.850
 touches the star of what is imposed is more 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.850
 broad 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.780
 the same 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:12.040
 we are talking about a year a car 1.6 and 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:14.290
 is air conditioned on then 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.810
 he did not show that natural stone 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.410
 generally have is conditioned generally 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.220
 have this loss 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:24.780
 I'm talking about the nissan car 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:28.230
 conversation 2011 1.6 gave to realize 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.870
 better then I did it just now too 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:33.180
 intensity from here with Luis who is 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:36.960
 Here we draw from it they 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:40.740
 2014 will not know the number 2014 and 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.250
 2013 model 2014 will consume us at 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.290
 do a test here where he gave 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:50.330
 140 is to do a test with a speed 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:53.850
 of 140 only for testing of course 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.620
 it was 160 with the same vote with the 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.150
 same acceleration 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.130
 then the chip he can fill a 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.900
 a little later in another 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.330
 opportunity maybe they will see the video 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.250
 You still know next time, and you can 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.860
 search and you already have the video there 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:11.190
 Do you know how to dance with this little skirt here? 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:19.350
 custom to make me return engine in 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:21.020
 second stage is full of 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.930
 third parties and kerry 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:27.280
 wanted to hit me 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.280
 a recent event 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:37.049
 played in six 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:39.359
 Wow, did you speak later in São Paulo? 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:41.730
 yet how many minutes did the second 

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:43.560
 subject that gave the time that he 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:49.560
 took buses that maybe 15 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:51.410
 seconds and resume the 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.290
 speed and miranda 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.480
 It's a space that I made behind the space 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.670
 that I leave the company 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:04.100
 I speed up as much as I can 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:06.820
 on a radar so we can not correct it until 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:12.320
 arrives next year 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:14.180
 now it has reached 106 in the head 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.070
 the chip can then increase with the 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.260
 torque and power and economy of 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:20.570
 fuel taken up other than 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.970
 is also a leader and maybe they will 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:24.410
 realize in the gearshift the intention 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.390
 exchange easier to find a 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.950
 best time yet to upshift 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:31.150
 I was realizing this. 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:33.380
 so it's a better one than actually 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.990
 proving that the chip is able to 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:40.520
 better still in the gear shifts 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:41.940
 It's okay, thank you very much. 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:46.430
 by the video 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:48.900

 waiting for your questions about any 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:59.130
 thing installation difficult to do manual 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:02.070
 I would give you a photo of me 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:04.380
 We send to all Brazil is fred por 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:05.790
 our ketchup account has a guarantee of 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:09.530
 three years 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.530
 Thank worth talked about aa
