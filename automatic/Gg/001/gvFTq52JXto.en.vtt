00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:17.199
 we will take as an example 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:20.619
 pizzeria's website is one in point yet br 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:23.619
 today we can find three promotional banners 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.640
 with separate ads at the same time 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:33.020
 let's now learn how to include abstract band are the most have your website 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.100
 too easy 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.100
 just open the locked navigation 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.160
 we will avoid it again 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.160
 the address of the world pizzeria 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.070
 pizzeria a point yet br 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.050
 / mobin 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.480
 mancini is your impact management system 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.840
 where the bandit system is included 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.840
 when we access 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:11.750
 enter the program interface 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.760
 today we will find 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.620
 in this comic the band module 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.820
 we stayed on top of the icon 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.640
 we will see the three images 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.790
 What else do we see on the fiction site? 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.080
 it is precisely this image a two and three 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.500
 the same images we see 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.090
 in the manager 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:33.930
 from your website 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.290
 we want to remember that these images 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.020
 are configured 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.590
 in these dimensions 648 by 304 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.480
 and these files are in jpg 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:51.210
 these files are developed by the client, ie people are users 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.320
 which will create bank crises 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.740
 through this creative sector through your own computer 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.010
 and the management system 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:01.150
 the shocking 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.759
 and so loads of including that image 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:05.390
 closed down this network 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:06.630
 too easy 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.829
 We came here no more number 1 

00:02:08.829 --> 00:02:11.429
 click change the image 

00:02:11.429 --> 00:02:13.479
 we can observe a field 

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:17.369
 where we should look for the image inside your machine 

00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:21.099
 In this case I will include 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:23.999
 this image of the whale 

00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:26.169
 save operation 

00:02:26.169 --> 00:02:27.589
 and how can we see 

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:30.589
 the image was changed by the image of the whale 

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:34.309
 Let's go to the website now. 

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:35.449
 in the image the number 1 

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:37.389
 we can still see 

00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:40.009
 the image that I just took away 

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:43.009
 I refresh the page one more time 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:50.669
 let's wait for the update 

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:52.729
 and how can you see 

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:54.299
 the image of the whale 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:55.849
 was included 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:58.589
 in the place of the promotional pack 

00:02:58.589 --> 00:03:01.589
 it stands to reason that this is just a test I am testing the system 

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:05.399
 and place an image without advertisement 

00:03:05.399 --> 00:03:06.679
 to show 

00:03:06.679 --> 00:03:08.639
 the way to include bands 

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:10.289
 on your website 

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:11.569
 we will go now 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:13.879
 change picture number 2 

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:17.239
 I'll put another photo. 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:20.239
 I'm going to put this cascade photo now 

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:23.879
 save setting 

00:03:26.649 --> 00:03:28.829
 and how can you see 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:32.129
 was changed to the waterfall image 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:34.589
 Let's use this petition. 

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:37.829
 we still see the bunch - two with the promotion 

00:03:38.999 --> 00:03:42.749
 we will go to refresh the page I can also use the f5 

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:49.669
 team because the update load 

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:54.669
 the number 2 will appear the image of the cascade 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:59.719
 let's now do the same procedure was maxi lopez 

00:04:00.749 --> 00:04:03.749
 it includes pictures of flowers now 

00:04:04.899 --> 00:04:08.019
 but defenders 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:10.929
 save change 

00:04:10.929 --> 00:04:13.359
 and once again the tv the image 

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:16.189
 and now we have three images 

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:18.689
 different managed 

00:04:18.689 --> 00:04:21.689
 on the pizzeria site where 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.789
 one more time but we see in image 03 besides the promotion 

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:29.849
 we updated the page 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.930
 and after updating 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:37.430
 we got 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.499
 to also change the third image we can not see the image of flowers 

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:46.349
 the image one with the whale image of the rexpa cascade 

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:47.789
 and the image 3 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:49.270
 with the flowers 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.330
 are the images that we can see 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.330
 the band management system they 

00:04:56.259 --> 00:04:58.199
 of the petition site 

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:01.210
 we came once again to include 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:03.409
 these names 

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:06.139
 I do the same procedure 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:09.279
 looking no further 

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:11.900
 I can also 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.900
 save all three images at once 

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:19.479
 and that's what I'm going to do now 

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:26.919
 but my 3 

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:34.099
 and as we can see it 

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:38.589
 we again include the three promotional banners on the site of pizzeria 1 

00:05:39.689 --> 00:05:42.689
 I do not know if I feel a little refreshed. 

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:48.909
 after page load 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:52.580
 we can see the return 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:55.590
 of the three promotional banners of the world pizzeria 

00:05:56.409 --> 00:05:59.710
 imagine an image 2 image 3 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:02.539
 quick simple practice 

00:06:02.539 --> 00:06:03.539
 in a way 

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:06.550
 try to think on your site 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:08.809
 we are at your disposal 

00:06:08.809 --> 00:06:11.879
 for any questions regarding the tram system 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.620
 through the support to a little impacting point with br 

00:06:18.029 --> 00:06:19.580
 we want to remember 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.129
 that these images 

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:24.409
 are made by you client user 

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:26.869
 and what's called people has to be 

00:06:26.869 --> 00:06:29.189
 in the following dimensions 

00:06:29.189 --> 00:06:31.729
 dimension is related 

00:06:31.729 --> 00:06:35.099
 to the size of its flock and has been developed 

00:06:35.099 --> 00:06:38.509
 it's shocking technology say you're a web surfer 

00:06:38.509 --> 00:06:39.839
 a great day 

00:06:39.839 --> 00:06:42.069
 a great afternoon on a great night
