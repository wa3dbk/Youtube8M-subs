yo guys what is up extortion back she
once<00:00:02.610> again<00:00:02.669> and<00:00:03.120> today<00:00:03.300> I'm<00:00:03.600> gonna<00:00:03.780> be<00:00:03.959> going

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
once again and today I'm gonna be going

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.400 
once again and today I'm gonna be going
over<00:00:04.410> the<00:00:04.799> Pearl<00:00:05.190> theory<00:00:05.810> for<00:00:06.810> Steven

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
over the Pearl theory for Steven

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.379 
over the Pearl theory for Steven
universe<00:00:07.620> which<00:00:08.400> is<00:00:08.610> essentially<00:00:09.030> saying

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
universe which is essentially saying

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.339 
universe which is essentially saying
that<00:00:09.510> she<00:00:09.840> is<00:00:10.019> lost<00:00:10.950> and<00:00:11.340> she<00:00:12.150> was<00:00:12.360> made<00:00:12.719> as<00:00:12.990> a

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
that she is lost and she was made as a

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.109 
that she is lost and she was made as a
knight<00:00:13.740> to<00:00:14.150> defend<00:00:15.150> rose<00:00:15.480> quartz<00:00:16.010> now<00:00:17.010> when<00:00:18.000> it

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
knight to defend rose quartz now when it

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.609 
knight to defend rose quartz now when it
comes<00:00:18.330> to<00:00:18.510> specifically<00:00:18.990> defending<00:00:19.439> rose

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
comes to specifically defending rose

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.380 
comes to specifically defending rose
quartz<00:00:19.980> that's<00:00:20.250> not<00:00:20.550> exactly<00:00:20.880> what<00:00:21.150> I<00:00:21.210> mean

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
quartz that's not exactly what I mean

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.830 
quartz that's not exactly what I mean
what<00:00:22.230> I<00:00:22.260> mean<00:00:22.350> one<00:00:22.710> of<00:00:22.800> us<00:00:22.920> pearls<00:00:23.820> I'm<00:00:24.090> made<00:00:24.390> to

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
what I mean one of us pearls I'm made to

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.849 
what I mean one of us pearls I'm made to
protect<00:00:25.789> the<00:00:26.789> main<00:00:27.119> diamonds<00:00:27.689> which<00:00:28.529> is<00:00:28.560> why

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
protect the main diamonds which is why

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.560 
protect the main diamonds which is why
they<00:00:29.250> will<00:00:29.369> put<00:00:29.609> themselves<00:00:30.029> over<00:00:30.359> anything

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
they will put themselves over anything

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:31.820 
they will put themselves over anything
now<00:00:30.810> I'm<00:00:30.900> not<00:00:31.019> going<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.199> put<00:00:31.289> that<00:00:31.320> club<00:00:31.619> but<00:00:31.769> I

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
now I'm not going to put that club but I

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.020 
now I'm not going to put that club but I
have<00:00:31.920> two<00:00:32.070> other<00:00:32.219> cliffs<00:00:32.520> i'm<00:00:32.640> going<00:00:32.820> to<00:00:32.910> show

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
have two other cliffs i'm going to show

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.360 
have two other cliffs i'm going to show
and<00:00:33.270> as<00:00:33.930> you<00:00:34.020> guys<00:00:34.170> can<00:00:34.290> see<00:00:34.350> right<00:00:34.620> here<00:00:34.829> there

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
and as you guys can see right here there

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.490 
and as you guys can see right here there
is<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:35.640> pink<00:00:36.270> diamond<00:00:36.510> in<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:36.930> middle<00:00:37.020> of<00:00:37.320> her

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
is a pink diamond in the middle of her

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.830 
is a pink diamond in the middle of her
space<00:00:37.829> suit<00:00:38.070> in<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.250> episode<00:00:38.610> space<00:00:38.940> race<00:00:39.210> now

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
space suit in the episode space race now

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.080 
space suit in the episode space race now
this<00:00:40.500> is<00:00:40.559> pretty<00:00:40.739> much<00:00:40.800> signaling<00:00:41.399> signifying

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
this is pretty much signaling signifying

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.500 
this is pretty much signaling signifying
that<00:00:42.329> she<00:00:42.899> is<00:00:43.020> with<00:00:43.559> pink<00:00:43.950> diamond<00:00:44.210> which<00:00:45.210> is

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
that she is with pink diamond which is

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.049 
that she is with pink diamond which is
obviously<00:00:46.500> most<00:00:46.710> likely<00:00:47.160> rose<00:00:47.579> now<00:00:47.879> this

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
obviously most likely rose now this

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.549 
obviously most likely rose now this
hasn't<00:00:48.329> been<00:00:48.360> confirmed<00:00:48.600> but<00:00:49.110> I<00:00:49.170> mean<00:00:49.379> there's

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
hasn't been confirmed but I mean there's

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.799 
hasn't been confirmed but I mean there's
yellow<00:00:49.860> diamond<00:00:50.070> we<00:00:50.610> know<00:00:50.879> about<00:00:51.030> her<00:00:51.329> now<00:00:51.539> and

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
yellow diamond we know about her now and

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.100 
yellow diamond we know about her now and
so<00:00:52.710> there's<00:00:53.550> obviously<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.510> pink<00:00:54.719> diamond

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
so there's obviously the pink diamond

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.260 
so there's obviously the pink diamond
now<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:55.829> that<00:00:56.340> probably<00:00:56.550> means<00:00:56.730> there's<00:00:56.940> the

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
now and that probably means there's the

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.240 
now and that probably means there's the
blue<00:00:57.510> diamond<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.140> I<00:00:58.440> think<00:00:58.649> it's<00:00:58.800> a<00:00:58.920> green

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
blue diamond and I think it's a green

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.279 
blue diamond and I think it's a green
diamond<00:00:59.609> that's<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.850> other<00:00:59.940> 1i<00:01:00.030> forgot<00:01:00.300> which

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
diamond that's the other 1i forgot which

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.210 
diamond that's the other 1i forgot which
but<00:01:02.090> yeah<00:01:03.090> now<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.690> theory<00:01:04.110> goes<00:01:04.140> is<00:01:04.589> she<00:01:05.100> is

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
but yeah now the theory goes is she is

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.429 
but yeah now the theory goes is she is
actually<00:01:05.549> lost<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.450> I<00:01:06.659> guess<00:01:06.869> technically

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
actually lost and I guess technically

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.969 
actually lost and I guess technically
she's<00:01:07.740> not<00:01:07.920> because<00:01:08.280> steven<00:01:08.790> is<00:01:09.979> technically

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
she's not because steven is technically

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.240 
she's not because steven is technically
rose<00:01:11.340> quartz<00:01:11.880> so<00:01:12.750> he's<00:01:13.409> pretty<00:01:13.619> much<00:01:13.830> pink

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
rose quartz so he's pretty much pink

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.030 
rose quartz so he's pretty much pink
diamond<00:01:14.610> now<00:01:14.729> but<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.990> two<00:01:16.320> quotes<00:01:16.650> for<00:01:16.860> this

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
diamond now but the two quotes for this

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.490 
diamond now but the two quotes for this
or<00:01:18.080> this<00:01:19.080> movie<00:01:19.590> Oh<00:01:19.820> some<00:01:20.820> lost<00:01:21.180> dip-dip<00:01:22.110> girl

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
or this movie Oh some lost dip-dip girl

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.249 
or this movie Oh some lost dip-dip girl
saying<00:01:23.460> that<00:01:23.700> she's<00:01:23.909> a<00:01:23.939> lost<00:01:24.390> effective<00:01:24.930> peril

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
saying that she's a lost effective peril

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.219 
saying that she's a lost effective peril
and<00:01:25.549> so<00:01:26.549> essentially<00:01:27.450> that's<00:01:28.439> just<00:01:28.799> like

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
and so essentially that's just like

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:33.170 
and so essentially that's just like
parallels<00:01:31.229> are<00:01:31.439> made<00:01:31.829> to<00:01:32.070> take<00:01:32.250> orders<00:01:32.700> for

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
parallels are made to take orders for

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.210 
parallels are made to take orders for
their<00:01:34.110> main<00:01:34.619> diamonds<00:01:35.159> and<00:01:35.600> so<00:01:36.860> yeah<00:01:37.860> there's

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
their main diamonds and so yeah there's

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.740 
their main diamonds and so yeah there's
one<00:01:38.310> clip<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:38.820> then<00:01:38.939> a<00:01:38.970> new<00:01:39.180> clip<00:01:39.390> that<00:01:39.570> came

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
one clip and then a new clip that came

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.850 
one clip and then a new clip that came
out<00:01:39.900> today<00:01:40.640> was<00:01:41.640> this<00:01:42.600> which<00:01:43.170> pretty<00:01:43.770> much

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
out today was this which pretty much

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.630 
out today was this which pretty much
proves<00:01:44.520> that<00:01:44.939> this<00:01:45.720> is<00:01:46.579> gonna<00:01:47.579> be<00:01:47.759> correct

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
proves that this is gonna be correct

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.530 
proves that this is gonna be correct
yes

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.320 

forget<00:01:54.540> me<00:01:54.810> you<00:01:55.409> caught<00:01:55.740> you<00:01:56.280> lie<00:01:56.520> to<00:01:56.580> me<00:01:56.940> you

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
need to learn that there are

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.320 
need to learn that there are

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.990 

so

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.390 

so<00:02:19.630> right<00:02:19.840> there<00:02:19.870> she's<00:02:20.830> pretty<00:02:21.040> much<00:02:21.160> saying

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
so right there she's pretty much saying

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.140 
so right there she's pretty much saying
that<00:02:21.850> pearl<00:02:22.650> herself<00:02:23.650> she<00:02:24.640> needs<00:02:24.850> someone<00:02:25.060> to

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
that pearl herself she needs someone to

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:26.850 
that pearl herself she needs someone to
tell<00:02:25.360> her<00:02:25.450> what<00:02:25.600> to<00:02:25.630> do<00:02:25.870> who<00:02:26.290> was<00:02:26.470> most<00:02:26.680> likely

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
tell her what to do who was most likely

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
tell her what to do who was most likely
rose<00:02:27.280> quartz<00:02:27.640> so<00:02:28.630> now<00:02:29.620> that<00:02:29.860> this<00:02:30.100> theory<00:02:30.850> has

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
rose quartz so now that this theory has

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.210 
rose quartz so now that this theory has
pretty<00:02:31.240> much<00:02:31.390> been<00:02:31.630> proven<00:02:32.170> correct<00:02:32.350> what<00:02:33.160> do

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
pretty much been proven correct what do

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.320 
pretty much been proven correct what do
you<00:02:33.310> guys<00:02:33.430> think<00:02:33.490> do<00:02:33.940> you<00:02:33.970> think<00:02:34.030> we're<00:02:34.240> going

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
you guys think do you think we're going

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:35.280 
you guys think do you think we're going
to<00:02:34.420> get<00:02:34.480> to<00:02:34.570> see<00:02:34.720> some<00:02:34.840> of<00:02:34.900> the<00:02:34.990> other<00:02:35.020> pearls

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
to get to see some of the other pearls

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.440 
to get to see some of the other pearls
and<00:02:35.590> if<00:02:36.370> you<00:02:36.459> enjoyed<00:02:36.760> this<00:02:36.940> and<00:02:37.150> want<00:02:37.300> to<00:02:37.330> see

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
and if you enjoyed this and want to see

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:38.730 
and if you enjoyed this and want to see
more<00:02:37.480> like<00:02:37.780> this<00:02:37.959> of<00:02:38.110> course<00:02:38.140> I'd<00:02:38.470> be<00:02:38.620> better

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740 
more like this of course I'd be better

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.020 
more like this of course I'd be better
in<00:02:38.920> the<00:02:38.950> future<00:02:39.040> this<00:02:39.370> is<00:02:39.430> my<00:02:39.610> first<00:02:39.820> one<00:02:40.000> I

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
in the future this is my first one I

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.220 
in the future this is my first one I
don't<00:02:40.150> really<00:02:40.360> know<00:02:40.540> how<00:02:40.660> to<00:02:40.720> do<00:02:40.959> this<00:02:41.110> stuff

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
don't really know how to do this stuff

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.620 
don't really know how to do this stuff
and<00:02:41.950> I've<00:02:42.280> loved<00:02:42.730> the<00:02:42.910> show<00:02:43.150> for<00:02:43.390> a<00:02:43.420> while<00:02:43.510> I

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
and I've loved the show for a while I

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.120 
and I've loved the show for a while I
just<00:02:43.810> didn't<00:02:44.170> really<00:02:44.350> want<00:02:44.530> to<00:02:44.560> do<00:02:44.770> anything

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
just didn't really want to do anything

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:46.800 
just didn't really want to do anything
on<00:02:45.220> it<00:02:45.340> because<00:02:45.459> I<00:02:45.550> didn't<00:02:45.850> know<00:02:45.880> how<00:02:46.180> I<00:02:46.600> would

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
on it because I didn't know how I would

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.840 
on it because I didn't know how I would
be<00:02:47.020> able<00:02:47.110> to<00:02:47.410> and<00:02:47.650> considering<00:02:48.340> my<00:02:48.490> channels

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
be able to and considering my channels

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.150 
be able to and considering my channels
based<00:02:49.030> around<00:02:49.300> gaming<00:02:49.690> I<00:02:50.080> really<00:02:50.980> don't<00:02:51.130> know

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
based around gaming I really don't know

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.100 
based around gaming I really don't know
how<00:02:51.310> I<00:02:51.340> fit<00:02:51.550> this<00:02:51.640> in<00:02:51.820> but<00:02:51.970> i<00:02:52.030> decided<00:02:52.300> i'll

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
how I fit this in but i decided i'll

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.680 
how I fit this in but i decided i'll
take<00:02:53.500> this<00:02:53.590> on<00:02:53.770> anyways<00:02:54.040> and<00:02:54.390> i<00:02:55.390> have<00:02:55.480> another

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
take this on anyways and i have another

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.270 
take this on anyways and i have another
theory<00:02:55.959> that<00:02:56.170> could<00:02:56.320> easily<00:02:56.650> go<00:02:56.770> up<00:02:56.950> for

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
theory that could easily go up for

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.860 
theory that could easily go up for
debate<00:02:57.489> which<00:02:57.820> was<00:02:58.000> the<00:02:58.180> diamond<00:02:58.480> theory<00:02:58.690> and

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
debate which was the diamond theory and

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.340 
debate which was the diamond theory and
everything<00:02:59.170> try<00:02:59.980> diamond<00:03:00.310> theory<00:03:00.550> and<00:03:01.350> so

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
everything try diamond theory and so

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:03.780 
everything try diamond theory and so
yeah<00:03:02.770> if<00:03:02.920> you<00:03:03.010> got<00:03:03.130> into<00:03:03.220> the<00:03:03.370> video<00:03:03.489> drop<00:03:03.760> a

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
yeah if you got into the video drop a

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.220 
yeah if you got into the video drop a
