00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.070 
that are in here that they are the large

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:28.480 
that are in here that they are the large
ones<00:05:25.490> you<00:05:26.479> may<00:05:26.630> have<00:05:26.810> another<00:05:27.020> spare<00:05:27.409> pair<00:05:27.710> so

obviously they are adjustable you can

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:31.839 
obviously they are adjustable you can
remove<00:05:30.349> those<00:05:30.590> and<00:05:30.860> put<00:05:30.979> the<00:05:31.099> ones<00:05:31.310> on<00:05:31.639> the

00:05:31.839 --> 00:05:31.849 
remove those and put the ones on the

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:35.080 
remove those and put the ones on the
cover<00:05:32.120> spares<00:05:32.620> but<00:05:33.620> that<00:05:33.860> as<00:05:34.070> far<00:05:34.820> as<00:05:34.849> the

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:35.090 
cover spares but that as far as the

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:37.960 
cover spares but that as far as the
initial<00:05:35.449> impression<00:05:35.990> goes<00:05:36.460> as<00:05:37.460> it<00:05:37.759> says<00:05:37.940> on

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:37.970 
initial impression goes as it says on

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:40.779 
initial impression goes as it says on
the<00:05:38.240> box<00:05:38.479> they<00:05:38.870> are<00:05:39.550> designed<00:05:40.550> to<00:05:40.639> be

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:40.789 
the box they are designed to be

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:42.939 
the box they are designed to be
lightweight<00:05:41.000> and<00:05:41.659> they<00:05:41.900> are<00:05:42.020> incredibly

00:05:42.939 --> 00:05:42.949 
lightweight and they are incredibly

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:45.219 
lightweight and they are incredibly
light<00:05:43.219> I<00:05:43.400> can<00:05:43.639> hardly<00:05:43.849> feel<00:05:44.270> those<00:05:44.539> in<00:05:44.750> my<00:05:44.840> hand

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:45.229 
light I can hardly feel those in my hand

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:47.170 
light I can hardly feel those in my hand
so<00:05:45.949> I<00:05:45.979> would<00:05:46.190> suggest<00:05:46.370> from<00:05:46.699> a<00:05:46.849> point<00:05:47.030> of<00:05:47.120> view

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:47.180 
so I would suggest from a point of view

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.999 
so I would suggest from a point of view
of<00:05:47.300> wearing<00:05:47.719> them<00:05:47.840> for<00:05:47.870> a<00:05:48.080> you<00:05:48.650> know<00:05:48.710> a<00:05:48.800> long

00:05:48.999 --> 00:05:49.009 
of wearing them for a you know a long

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:51.249 
of wearing them for a you know a long
period<00:05:49.370> of<00:05:49.460> time<00:05:49.990> whilst<00:05:50.990> you're<00:05:51.139> on<00:05:51.229> a

00:05:51.249 --> 00:05:51.259 
period of time whilst you're on a

00:05:51.259 --> 00:05:52.870 
period of time whilst you're on a
journey<00:05:51.530> listening<00:05:52.039> to<00:05:52.159> music<00:05:52.610> or<00:05:52.729> anything

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:52.880 
journey listening to music or anything

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.749 
journey listening to music or anything
like<00:05:53.120> that<00:05:53.590> or<00:05:54.590> if<00:05:54.800> you're<00:05:54.919> on<00:05:55.070> your<00:05:55.250> PC<00:05:55.610> for

00:05:55.749 --> 00:05:55.759 
like that or if you're on your PC for

00:05:55.759 --> 00:05:58.689 
like that or if you're on your PC for
any<00:05:55.940> length<00:05:56.090> of<00:05:56.240> time<00:05:57.070> they<00:05:58.070> are<00:05:58.099> incredibly

00:05:58.689 --> 00:05:58.699 
any length of time they are incredibly

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:00.159 
any length of time they are incredibly
lightweight<00:05:59.000> so<00:05:59.360> I<00:05:59.389> would<00:05:59.570> imagine<00:05:59.780> you<00:06:00.139> would

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:00.169 
lightweight so I would imagine you would

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:01.870 
lightweight so I would imagine you would
hardly<00:06:00.469> feel<00:06:00.919> that<00:06:01.130> you're<00:06:01.250> actually<00:06:01.460> wearing

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:01.880 
hardly feel that you're actually wearing

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:05.890 
hardly feel that you're actually wearing
them<00:06:02.440> and<00:06:03.940> you<00:06:04.940> know<00:06:05.060> with<00:06:05.210> the<00:06:05.240> cable<00:06:05.690> as<00:06:05.750> well

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:05.900 
them and you know with the cable as well

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.420 
them and you know with the cable as well
the<00:06:06.020> cable<00:06:06.380> is<00:06:06.440> also<00:06:06.740> incredibly<00:06:07.159> lightweight

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:07.430 
the cable is also incredibly lightweight

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:09.279 
the cable is also incredibly lightweight
so<00:06:07.760> it's<00:06:07.909> not<00:06:08.000> as<00:06:08.120> if<00:06:08.270> you're<00:06:08.449> gonna<00:06:08.570> you<00:06:09.199> know

00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:09.289 
so it's not as if you're gonna you know

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:11.110 
so it's not as if you're gonna you know
you<00:06:09.380> can<00:06:09.529> have<00:06:09.680> a<00:06:09.740> lightweight<00:06:10.010> ear

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:11.120 
you can have a lightweight ear

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.150 
you can have a lightweight ear
a<00:06:11.180> phone<00:06:11.660> in<00:06:11.840> your<00:06:11.870> ears<00:06:12.260> and<00:06:12.470> yet<00:06:12.919> that<00:06:13.100> you

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:13.160 
a phone in your ears and yet that you

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:14.680 
a phone in your ears and yet that you
can<00:06:13.340> feel<00:06:13.550> the<00:06:13.699> kid<00:06:13.880> will<00:06:14.060> sort<00:06:14.240> of<00:06:14.330> dragging

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:14.690 
can feel the kid will sort of dragging

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:17.320 
can feel the kid will sort of dragging
on<00:06:14.810> them<00:06:14.990> so<00:06:15.199> as<00:06:15.680> a<00:06:16.220> product<00:06:16.669> you<00:06:17.000> know<00:06:17.120> going

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:17.330 
on them so as a product you know going

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:19.810 
on them so as a product you know going
off<00:06:17.510> what<00:06:17.690> it<00:06:17.780> says<00:06:17.960> on<00:06:18.110> the<00:06:18.139> box<00:06:18.820> initial

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:19.820 
off what it says on the box initial

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:21.520 
off what it says on the box initial
impression<00:06:20.270> is<00:06:20.389> that<00:06:20.419> it<00:06:20.780> is<00:06:20.960> a<00:06:20.990> really

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:21.530 
impression is that it is a really

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:24.219 
impression is that it is a really
lightweight<00:06:21.770> product<00:06:22.190> and<00:06:22.550> and<00:06:23.540> yeah<00:06:23.930> being
