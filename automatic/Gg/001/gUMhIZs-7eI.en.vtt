more advanced machines they become very

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:54.369 
more advanced machines they become very
redundant<00:02:52.819> and<00:02:53.030> thus<00:02:53.269> become<00:02:53.659> easier<00:02:54.139> because

00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:54.379 
redundant and thus become easier because

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:55.809 
redundant and thus become easier because
you're<00:02:54.650> doing<00:02:54.919> them<00:02:55.069> over<00:02:55.370> and<00:02:55.489> over<00:02:55.700> again
