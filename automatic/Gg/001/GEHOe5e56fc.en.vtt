00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:14.220
 hi youtube that were not made 15 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.860
 materials always this then in this 

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:20.250
 occasion I bring you in my little 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:23.400
 tutorial that can happen this is about 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.730
 how to show the hidden folders the 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.730
 windows 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:34.230
 for example here right now I'm going to add 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:37.230
 a folder for example 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.500
 but only to show them what to do 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.500
 this 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.050
 and here properties 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:50.399
 and as they realize this she hides 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:55.019
 this folder and it is no longer seen or it is said that 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:58.559
 This is empty and will not appear anything 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:01:01.859
 at least it is not visible good for 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:06.170
 can see this folder this the only thing 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:10.280
 one has to do is this either for 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:14.310
 windows xp is already bring the bar this 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:17.929
 list of options or lower windows 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:21.409
 but for windows 7 you have to press 

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:25.400
 the alt key 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:28.220
 and then we go to tools 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.090
 and options of strong options 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.060
 binder 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:36.070
 and then here we slide to the 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:41.440
 vista tab 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:44.979
 and let's find where it says folders and 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:48.190
 I say hidden folders and files and 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:52.869
 here we are going to palomear or mark the 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:56.740
 option that says this show show 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:59.070
 folders files and hidden drivers and 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:02.790
 we are going to apply 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.770
 ok and as you realize, this 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.479
 folder that is called an example but 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.289
 it appears a bit fuzzy 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.670
 because it's still hidden but now this 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:15.770
 this we put the option that 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.770
 We could see this 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:25.520
 this hidden folders and in fact 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:25.520
 this also serves here this part 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.640
 reuters 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:34.240
 this one that normally comes hidden to 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.790
 AppData folder that is where 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.550
 store the data of those of the 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.800
 applications or programs and that 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:45.370
 Sometimes we have to sign in to eliminate 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.940
 something put something but then we can not 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:51.340
 get in 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:54.700
 well this was in windows 7 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:58.730
 let me finish 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:02.930
 windows 8 good I'm here in windows 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:05.380
 8 and then now we go to the browser 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.380
 windows 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:19.410
 we go to documents and here we are going to create 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:22.340
 a folder for example 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.340
 manage 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.980
 the appetite 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:37.520
 we are going to give you tutoring 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.770
 narrowly 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:46.110
 the droppers here 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:50.660
 and here we are going to create the folder that I'm going 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.660
 to hide for the example 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:08.630
 to do this is basically the same 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:12.370
 no more than windows windows vista 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:15.290
 in windows 8 is a little bit more this more 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:17.750
 fast what we are going to do only 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:21.500
 we go to the tab view here 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:23.630
 up and we go to options 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.690
 the top button of options and we're going to 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:28.730
 view over and we go to files and folders 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:31.139
 hidden and we're going to give you our 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:34.430
 hidden files and folders 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:34.430
 and we are going to remove 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:40.470
 and accept 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:42.770
 and here it appears how you can set 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.770
 as well 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.510
 this he appears 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:50.050
 It can be a bit pink because it's still 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:52.389
 hidden 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:55.900
 more you can hide the same as 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:59.270
 we hide properties and then what 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:01.529
 less the body we are going to apply 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:04.849
 and it would be everything 

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:04.849
 and can reset 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:10.610
 what was coming again we are going to 

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:15.190
 options to see and not show files and 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:15.190
 Hidden folders apply and accept 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:23.940
 and now if you see this color rigid 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:26.700
 this and expropriation is not hidden 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:31.070
 and then I think that exported this me 

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:33.390
