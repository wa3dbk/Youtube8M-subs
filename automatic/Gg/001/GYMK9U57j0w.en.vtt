trigger<00:01:49.439> red<00:01:49.770> tides<00:01:50.100> or<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:50.909> bacteria<00:01:51.090> where

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
trigger red tides or the bacteria where

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.810 
trigger red tides or the bacteria where
the<00:01:51.960> bacteria<00:01:52.380> and<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:52.860> algae<00:01:53.009> just<00:01:53.280> go<00:01:53.520> crazy

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
the bacteria and the algae just go crazy

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.300 
the bacteria and the algae just go crazy
off<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.180> nutrients<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:54.960> then<00:01:55.500> this<00:01:55.799> can<00:01:56.100> lead

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
off the nutrients and then this can lead

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.429 
off the nutrients and then this can lead
to<00:01:56.460> dead<00:01:56.670> zones<00:01:56.969> in<00:01:57.119> our<00:01:57.270> Bay<00:01:57.479> which<00:01:58.020> can<00:01:58.229> kill

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
to dead zones in our Bay which can kill

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.970 
to dead zones in our Bay which can kill
off<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.860> fish<00:01:59.100> in<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.520> life<00:02:00.030> usually<00:02:00.450> we

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:00.980 
off the fish in the life usually we

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.340 
off the fish in the life usually we
have<00:02:01.100> a<00:02:01.130> stagnant<00:02:01.760> pool<00:02:01.970> of<00:02:02.120> water<00:02:02.330> when<00:02:03.170> there

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
have a stagnant pool of water when there

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.880 
have a stagnant pool of water when there
is<00:02:03.440> a<00:02:03.470> sandbar<00:02:04.130> here<00:02:04.460> on<00:02:04.580> the<00:02:04.670> beach<00:02:05.200> but<00:02:06.200> of

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
is a sandbar here on the beach but of

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.370 
is a sandbar here on the beach but of
course<00:02:07.250> the<00:02:07.580> the<00:02:08.090> expensive<00:02:08.570> hotels<00:02:08.960> don't

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
course the the expensive hotels don't

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.590 
course the the expensive hotels don't
want<00:02:10.040> their<00:02:10.460> guests<00:02:10.820> to<00:02:10.940> be<00:02:11.060> seeing<00:02:11.330> a

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
want their guests to be seeing a

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.380 
want their guests to be seeing a
stagnant<00:02:12.200> pool<00:02:12.380> of<00:02:12.650> pollutants<00:02:13.340> so<00:02:14.120> what<00:02:14.270> they

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
stagnant pool of pollutants so what they

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.750 
stagnant pool of pollutants so what they
do<00:02:14.450> is<00:02:14.720> they<00:02:14.900> scour<00:02:15.260> a<00:02:15.410> groove<00:02:15.770> in<00:02:16.160> the<00:02:16.250> sandbar

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
do is they scour a groove in the sandbar

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.910 
do is they scour a groove in the sandbar
which<00:02:17.030> allows<00:02:17.510> the<00:02:17.810> water<00:02:18.020> to<00:02:18.200> flow<00:02:18.320> from<00:02:18.860> the

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
which allows the water to flow from the

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.300 
which allows the water to flow from the
pool<00:02:19.220> out<00:02:19.580> into<00:02:20.240> the<00:02:20.360> ocean<00:02:20.810> when<00:02:21.620> we<00:02:21.770> got<00:02:21.980> here

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
pool out into the ocean when we got here

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.510 
pool out into the ocean when we got here
there's<00:02:22.940> no<00:02:23.270> flow<00:02:23.600> but<00:02:24.080> right<00:02:24.320> now<00:02:24.560> after<00:02:24.920> the

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
there's no flow but right now after the

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.370 
there's no flow but right now after the
guy<00:02:25.880> in<00:02:26.030> the<00:02:26.150> truck<00:02:26.450> just<00:02:26.480> opened<00:02:27.110> up<00:02:27.200> the

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
guy in the truck just opened up the

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.320 
guy in the truck just opened up the
channel<00:02:27.740> there's<00:02:28.130> a<00:02:28.220> lot<00:02:28.490> of<00:02:28.640> flow<00:02:28.850> so<00:02:28.910> now<00:02:29.270> the

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
channel there's a lot of flow so now the

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:30.700 
channel there's a lot of flow so now the
ocean<00:02:29.870> right<00:02:30.080> there<00:02:30.320> is<00:02:30.440> going<00:02:30.590> to<00:02:30.650> be

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:30.710 
ocean right there is going to be

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:32.200 
ocean right there is going to be
unlivable<00:02:31.220> there's<00:02:31.610> gonna<00:02:31.700> be<00:02:31.820> lots<00:02:32.030> of

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.210 
unlivable there's gonna be lots of

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:34.480 
unlivable there's gonna be lots of
pollutants<00:02:32.630> and<00:02:32.780> it'll<00:02:33.710> be<00:02:33.920> unsafe<00:02:34.340> this

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490 
pollutants and it'll be unsafe this

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.870 
pollutants and it'll be unsafe this
woman<00:02:35.290> we<00:02:36.290> label<00:02:36.680> all<00:02:36.890> of<00:02:36.920> our<00:02:37.190> bags<00:02:37.430> so<00:02:37.730> when

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
woman we label all of our bags so when

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.580 
woman we label all of our bags so when
we<00:02:37.970> go<00:02:38.090> back<00:02:38.240> to<00:02:38.420> the<00:02:38.570> lab<00:02:38.750> we<00:02:38.990> can<00:02:39.110> test<00:02:39.350> it

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
we go back to the lab we can test it

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.520 
we go back to the lab we can test it
correctly<00:02:40.300> the<00:02:41.300> water<00:02:41.540> samples<00:02:41.990> were<00:02:42.140> left<00:02:42.320> in

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
correctly the water samples were left in

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.860 
correctly the water samples were left in
the<00:02:42.560> incubator<00:02:43.100> for<00:02:43.700> 24<00:02:44.360> hours<00:02:44.660> so<00:02:44.840> that

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
the incubator for 24 hours so that

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.350 
the incubator for 24 hours so that
bacteria<00:02:45.500> can<00:02:45.740> use<00:02:46.040> the<00:02:46.550> protein<00:02:47.060> that<00:02:47.090> would

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
bacteria can use the protein that would

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.600 
bacteria can use the protein that would
give<00:02:47.480> them<00:02:47.630> into<00:02:47.900> the<00:02:47.990> food<00:02:48.320> so<00:02:49.010> that<00:02:49.160> we<00:02:49.280> can

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
give them into the food so that we can

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.360 
give them into the food so that we can
recognize<00:02:49.940> if<00:02:50.840> there<00:02:51.440> was<00:02:51.680> or<00:02:52.130> was<00:02:52.340> not

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
recognize if there was or was not

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.990 
recognize if there was or was not
bacteria<00:02:53.150> in<00:02:54.050> the<00:02:54.350> sample<00:02:54.740> the<00:02:55.400> ones<00:02:55.670> that<00:02:55.910> are

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
bacteria in the sample the ones that are

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.280 
bacteria in the sample the ones that are
blue<00:02:56.240> were<00:02:56.360> the<00:02:56.450> ones<00:02:56.660> that<00:02:56.900> have<00:02:57.080> the

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
blue were the ones that have the

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.880 
blue were the ones that have the
bacterial<00:02:58.330> colonies<00:02:59.330> our<00:02:59.710> population<00:03:00.710> in

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
bacterial colonies our population in

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.730 
bacterial colonies our population in
them<00:03:01.100> and<00:03:01.760> the<00:03:02.120> ones<00:03:02.330> that<00:03:02.960> are<00:03:03.140> not<00:03:03.320> blue<00:03:03.590> are

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:03.740 
them and the ones that are not blue are

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:05.380 
them and the ones that are not blue are
the<00:03:03.830> ones<00:03:03.920> without<00:03:04.280> bacteria<00:03:04.910> and<00:03:05.150> so<00:03:05.330> you

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
the ones without bacteria and so you

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.040 
the ones without bacteria and so you
determine<00:03:06.700> whether<00:03:07.700> or<00:03:07.820> not<00:03:08.000> it's<00:03:08.510> safe<00:03:08.870> to

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.050 
determine whether or not it's safe to

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.140 
determine whether or not it's safe to
swim<00:03:09.170> in<00:03:09.380> by<00:03:09.530> how<00:03:09.740> many<00:03:09.950> are<00:03:10.100> blue<00:03:10.430> versus<00:03:10.940> how

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
swim in by how many are blue versus how

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.650 
swim in by how many are blue versus how
many<00:03:11.440> are<00:03:12.440> not<00:03:12.770> blue<00:03:13.459> there's<00:03:14.120> a<00:03:14.209> lot<00:03:14.510> of

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
many are not blue there's a lot of

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.550 
many are not blue there's a lot of
bacteria<00:03:15.110> in<00:03:15.560> this<00:03:16.100> sample<00:03:16.370> which<00:03:16.820> is<00:03:17.000> from
