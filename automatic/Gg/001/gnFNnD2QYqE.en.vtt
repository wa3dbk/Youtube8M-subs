00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.859
 hello friends so today I them 

00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:09.860
 show how we can install 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:13.519
 the theme that I have on my iphone as 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:15.320
 can see has a pretty appearance 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:18.920
 flat that reminds us a lot of the 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:22.160
 windows phones phone interface 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:25.670
 or the metro interface in windows 8 what 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:29.269
 is that they have spent in this type of 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:31.580
 interface the first thing we need is 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:34.219
 have installed and dÃ­az and also winter 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:37.160
 board so we start with the process 

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:40.309
 we enter cydia and in cydia we have to 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.620
 add a repository for people 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:45.829
 who do not know how to add a repository 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:48.649
 then I'll do so here 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:51.230
 shortly we wait for the cydia to load 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:52.969
 all the data and once you have 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.570
 loaded we come to the part of 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:01:00.230
 handle then we tap on sources 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:03.260
 then in edit and then in add and 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:07.370
 here we put and lower case followed by a 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:10.310
 uppercase hacks repo dotcom 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:12.470
 and we give in adding source is going to 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.720
 appear this little sign and we give it in 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.540
 add anyway I do not do it 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.250
 because I already have it installed there are hacks 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.830
 repo 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.450
 so after we install this 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.390
 tweet we come to the part of the 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:29.120
 search engine and in the search engine we write in 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:35.000
 the name of the topic that we are going to 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:37.160
 install so we put isolate and eat 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.470
 here we can see the two appear 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.720
 options the option in blue letters is 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.090
 the payment option and the option in letters 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.460
 black is the free option that we are going to 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.950
 install I already have it installed but 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.510
 you to install you enter there where 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.540

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:56.510
 right to you will appear to install 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:59.270
 so you give it a touch and install and 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:02.030
 ready after you install it we are going to 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.400
 open the inter-board and we come to the 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.009
 part of selecting themes and we're going to 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.590
 install these two that appear there 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:13.070
 that's the two I'm selecting 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:15.890
 flat and cons and flan and silver and cons square 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:18.620

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.870
 spring to our phone and after 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.030
 sprint we can have this interface 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.489
 we can see that there are many icons of the 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:29.270
 most famous applications best known 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:32.209
