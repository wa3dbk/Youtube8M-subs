00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.059
 to paint cadmium expressing the edge 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:14.280
 are you also going to have a roasted sienna 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:17.179
 and titanium white that is opaque white zinc white 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.179
 is transparent 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.529
 easiest way to do that is 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.369
 if you do it this way 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.480
 what is in your blood and then what finds 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.579
 you through it 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.579
 how like you this is rosier huh 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:45.079
 sit without me noomi 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:47.809
 this is his made-up lines yes I know 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:50.930
 not you can do very much here 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:53.329
 and make variations because if you are here 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.579
 in doing is going to say after that color it is 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:59.030
 but should actually slightly lighter which suit 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:01.729
 you do that color and then you make something 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:04.039
 lighter if you feel so well it is more 

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:07.460
 a brown tint 

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:10.450
 but so what the reddish you grab 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.450
 that shade no 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.220
 that is tint difference 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.610
 slight difference so you can actually 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.560
 Continue as she says there 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.270
 hardly i have a skin that is anything 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.759
 yellower 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.610
 of course in gold a lot 10 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.860
 too different to sit in you think 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.729
 well it might be a solution or 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.740
 herb 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.700
 but if it is not this incredibly 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:42.030
 put in a skin 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.229
 canadian is so very very much but 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.500
 can do more 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.970
 adapting you online is something 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.350
 rosier 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.350
 make minutes backs 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.270
 so you get a toilet where you actually 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:59.429
 quite such have a hooves not every 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.399
 turn your pure cotton red and pack 

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:05.009
 why did you earn it more in the 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:08.670
 tint here think it should be 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:10.380
 and she decided this is a closed pan 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.910
 then honor anyone 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:16.410
 try as little as possible with oil 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.290
 to work 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:22.079
 only when it is lined so gray look 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.930
 that remain transparent so you stay 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:28.019
 very thin painting and then you suddenly see him 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.970
 out with the hairdresser to fuck 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:34.080
 then you get a very nice one 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:39.330
 low and down over low consultation you build 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:43.970
 that space on yes so this is the these tips 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:54.090
 palette believe says the fifth stage 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:57.410
 five and four is that difference of 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:02.240
 slow down the first phase that you do 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:02.240
 then you get a vase and the sketched one 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.630
 Then you get a phase that you scale 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:12.840
 whole pot with actually burnt 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:16.940
 recipes with him 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.940
 the next phase so that your lungs turn gray 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.750
 so you really get a gray portrait like 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:27.570
 that now 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:32.730
 with portrait of 8 nights you see whole 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:35.880
 clear gray and then you start as 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:39.080
 city ​​is very well done with it 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:42.959
 color became dictates this fifth phase 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:45.480
 very light about nine acids 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:48.950
 I use oil as little as possible 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.950
 must use this phase
