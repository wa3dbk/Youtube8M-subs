00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:14.530
 in something that is undeniable is that the 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.340
 muralism then born in mexico 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.350
 my name is close 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.780
 Many people know me as spanair 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:30.170
 which is the pseudonym that I chose to 

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:32.439
 paint and start about muralism is 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:35.350
 very weird because 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:38.110
 drawing from 3 years then I 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.940
 had as an approach towards the 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.670
 drawing in the painting from an early age 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.440
 but not knowing how the slopes or 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.890
 plastic currents that existed in their 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.890
 moment 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:01:00.310
 I was shocked when I have as 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:03.260
 about five or six years for a ticket 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:05.660
 that had the scene of the trench and 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.880
 that image with a button in purple tones 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.380
 that I liked a lot and tried to 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.450
 copy it but not knowing that actually 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.180
 of being a mural, I did not just see it as 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.900
 an image of a ticket and just years 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:21.970
 Then I understand what 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:24.970
 in one piece and discover how all 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:27.540
 he did an artistic work together with 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:30.160
 diego ribera together with gonzález camarena 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.230
 already with time obviously when I went 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.790
 I am growing because now I went to see some of 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.260
 the murals live and obviously stay 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.090
 more impacted because it's not the same 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.880
 move from a ticket to a book to 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.950
 happen to see him díaz with the real tones 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.250
 or with the magnitude they have as such 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:48.790
 also something that helped me a lot I think 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:51.520
 that was doing psl graffiti for 97 98 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:55.240
 when I discover artists like Jim 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:57.620
 jones de brasil people like that new 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.570
 york 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:02.090
 and when I discover a book that 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.560
 called art or profession because I see these 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.280
 people working in france 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.869
 working in italy working in usa 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:12.390
 when all that happens, obviously 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:14.460
 I had a clearer understanding of what 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.020
 after the mural and the history of 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.630
 the fine arts because you 're also 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.880
 I studied graphic design from 2008 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:24.380
 I started traveling around the guest world 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.970
 to have exhibitions or make murals 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.970
 for example last year I was in 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:31.100
 france making a mural with the theme 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.470
 with the theme of conquest for 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.720
 generate a romantic image of certain 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.340
 way where you are starting a 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.490
 conqueror together with a warrior 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:44.630
 jaguar these are stabbed and thanks to that 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:46.160
 we are, we have the idea of 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.260
 that being Mexican will cost us 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.000
 much, or really, it's going to cost us 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.330
 me and cost me a lot of it can 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.490
 tell life or easy on me 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:58.040
 every time I go out, it's like saying 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:00.770
 playing the world cup and it goes like this you have to 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.630
 go out and be among the best not 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.310
 because people are coming from france come 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:06.230
 people from new zealand come people from 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.440
 us and you have to give your best 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:12.110
 effort and say that because of something you're 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.910
 in those in those places not working and 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.470
 representing in a certain way your work 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:20.430
 but also to your country 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:23.490
 the departures usa helped me with that with 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.980
 many compatriots who also gives them 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:28.710
 a lot of happiness suddenly really 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:33.870
 Mexicans make the murals in the 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:36.069
 streets I feel that that is also the 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.959
 the power 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:41.319
 the responsibility of public art 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:43.030
 have a general emotion something in the 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:45.269
 viewer that poetry that in the end not 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:48.430
 they like the pieces it can not be that 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:50.379
 come in the tachen or the line too 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:53.210
 It may be that the child is a 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:54.890
 flown but there is a 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:56.720
 and restless because there is also a 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:01.820
 responsibility that should be taken in 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:03.890
 serious what I want to leave a good 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:07.250
 ask not to be afraid of the word 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:08.810
 failure because things can sound 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.080
 that is an animal act are actually 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:13.280
 something good then you'll stop 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:16.270
 reality choice and then you can do 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.270
 other things in the future
