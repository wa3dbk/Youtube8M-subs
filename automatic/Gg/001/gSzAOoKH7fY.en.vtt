00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.300
 well these are from two to a new video 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:11.540
 we are here in a platinum platinum 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:14.750
 number 78 this time we are in saints go 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:18.160
 get out of health and good basically 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:21.019
 Well, the last trophy that I had left 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.539
 complete the has also be will pass 

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:25.160
 three hours in cooperative his last one that 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:27.169
 I have stayed and good to say that good 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.960
 even if a tlc is a dlc 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:32.140
 independent and has platinum too 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.540
 as I had for example the ingenios 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.390
 first life 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.550
 and say that good the game in certain 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.890
 aspects I liked in many other 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.320
 I was quite disappointed in the 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.670
 look pretty bastard that for example 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.680
 if you have the listen to them and if the game 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.540
 if you have it, it 's difficult because I have it 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:53.020
 in digital or why but good is 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:55.540
 freezes many times or I say that 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.910
 I have to restart the console about 15 or 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:00.239
 16 times of all the times that I have been 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.559
 got caught the play and others 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.000
 moving this game I have it a 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:05.440
 downloadable and I do not know why that happens 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.080
 apart from that it has qualities of 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.070
 Frames that are amazing of the best 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.190
 suddenly 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.000
 10 geeks and you can not play the mega 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.620
 tail 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.570
 sometimes it has some very flaws 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.670
 tremendous the game otherwise 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.650
 It looks like a pretty fun game 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.120
 platinum and others I was scared with 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.420
 this platinum because there were more than 1000 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.920
 collectibles but good you syndicate 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.810
 technique where this one with pÃ©rez a 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.750
 skill and so on and then it tells you 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.920
 where are the bulls collectibles 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.590
 with which for good it has not either 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.350
 cost so much in that sense 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:42.230
 pretty funny I'll do indeed 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:45.050
 means to some collectibles because 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:46.380
 good me while doing other 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.039
 things 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.869
 because there are many there are thousand if not then 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:53.549
 if we like and like the 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.659
 collectibles better that you do not do to us 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.390
 this platinum because you can scream 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.369
 very much because in addition to the good game 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.840
 to be a dlc I liked it a lot 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.750
 the duration is short 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.939
 spend the whole game because I do not think that 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.530
 we arrive more than three hours ago that 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.050
 game then time action and so on and 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:13.530
 logically the campus or are about 20 20 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:16.550
 23 more or less do alone and others the 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:19.400
 difficulty I have not seen anything that is 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.170
 difficult the truth indeed the game in 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.080
 the most difficult way is not that it costs 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:27.460
 A lot of me is one of the things that I 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.770
 they surprised we have many skills 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:34.660
 and there are many states really are 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:36.340
 many the stomp is broken and 5 bone and 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.930
 the shotgun is also because then 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.180
 we have infinite ammunition we can 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.190
 improve the total good things that do not 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.850
 we can make a very broken character 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.560
 very much dust because the truth 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:50.830
 I wanted to comment a bit on the 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.540
 theme of the trophies so separately what 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.060
 good that a lot of people say but this is not 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.310
 It's good for nothing, I do not know, I do not know how much 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:01.570
 in part they are not wrong or it is not for 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:03.850
 nothing in the fact that it would be for his 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:06.460
 material or anything like that, not even 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:08.350
 have more trophies will give you what 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:10.000
 they are and nothing more or to have more achievements 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.610
 to give those from microsoft 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.910
 nothing else we could say in advantages 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:17.860
 as could be I do not know it 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.020
 for having more proposed could give no 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.360
 is access to sales or something like that 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.820
 do not do as competitions we can not 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.120
 say who is more consigned 500 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:28.950
 trophies for example then 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.470
 have access to the beta of I do not know what 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:34.830
 game and you can test it and I also do not know 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.720
 small rewards that really 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:39.650
 they would not encourage people to squeeze 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:42.330
 your games 100% because many times 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:45.240
 I was pack our collection is 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:47.250
 that we like I like the subject of 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:50.310
 collections directly and if it's in 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:52.950
 video games is more is not what cool and 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.570
 Also, you write your game at 100 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.880
 per cent that too what I what I 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:58.680
 like to be able to say look is first I'm 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.360
 one hundred percent and you can 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.100
 show us like when we were little 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.470
 what we said happened to me this game is 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:06.570
 difficult to see how your 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.280
 colleague no if he was not inviting your house 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:10.560
 you have to look from water to the and 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.870
 then done this or that, for now 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.850
 is recorded trophies I have is 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.250
 try in fact I am I have this trophy 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.680
 do not be I have passed for example the degree 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:22.019
 last to uar in veteran mode and I have 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.780
 of the trophies to show the obvious 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:26.700
 what happened to me the background is in mode 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.490
 and more difficult that incidentally cost me a 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:33.810
 egg in that game spend me the most 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:36.090
 difficult not recommend platinum if 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.919
 you do not want to suffer the truth is that it is 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.780
 very rewarding just like the code 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:42.550
 to the uar is also pretty crappy 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:45.250
 get off a veteran mode 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.870
 Oddly enough one of the is 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:51.689
 one of the most difficult is one of the 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:53.669
 more chungy dishes so I would put it in 

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:55.949
 in the ranking could read the 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:58.529
 fifteenth gas and order many that 

00:04:55.949 --> 00:05:02.270
 they are very difficult there are many who have 

00:04:58.529 --> 00:05:04.070
 some trophies that are already death 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:06.930
 and above all there is one of the max payne per 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:09.690
 example did not mention it ever 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:12.090
 the good sermon the last way 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:14.360
 difficulty that good that always 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:16.430
 start of the game 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.710
 bitch I never dare me with those 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:20.509
 trophies we are serious indeed the 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:23.419
 present I think there is another so no 

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:24.740
 never save if you die then 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:26.150
 logically it starts from the last 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.099
 saved point or start from the 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:31.479
 principle I do not dare with the 

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:31.479
 estrogens that are like that 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:40.220
 to die is that I would break everything 

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:44.210
 would enter a fucking rage more than rage 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:47.480
 maybe it would be a little frustrating I do not know 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:50.020
 I do not want to feel it I never wanted to try it 

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:52.400
 thank you to me of owners 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:54.080
 must be a bitch is that with luck 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.150
 that I'm sure they kill me in the 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:58.730
 final point and for a tour and cocks 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:01.030
 because I accidentally kill myself because 

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:02.890
 they got to gain nothing at my feet 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:05.650
 well that would be 20 service for 

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:08.260
 something to me the truth is that good that a 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:10.120
 platform have trophies achievements and others 

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:13.330
 Well, I think it helps a lot is not a 

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:16.590
 of the things missing from nintendo 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:19.360
 I know achievements and others we have pretty good 

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:22.030
 and as I say, that's fine with me 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:24.640
 I'm also cool, I do not know how to 

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:26.140
 reward more for having gone through this 

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:28.110
 or by others but as I say it would be cool that 

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:31.570
 I had enough to go crazy 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:33.070
 avatars or things like they cost them 

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:39.240
 it costs more I think that in the future what 

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:40.800
 will add future will add something in fact 

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:42.990
 the microsoft for a while now 

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:45.710
 give them rewards this I do not remember 

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:50.580
 well that you got but are 

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:53.430
 feet I do not know well sting also by the 

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:56.310
 logos also with chairs are chromos or 

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:57.810
 that are then your chromos I think that the 

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:59.099
 can you understand something like that I do not remember 

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:00.690
 because I'm wrong in many cases but 

00:06:59.099 --> 00:07:03.419
 good it's cool that you are giving things 

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:04.979
 new or missing maybe that so 

00:07:03.419 --> 00:07:08.910
 well there you have the saving platinum 

00:07:04.979 --> 00:07:10.380
 embraced and nothing platinum guys number 78 

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:13.009
 and nothing we see the next videos of the 

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:13.009
 next week
