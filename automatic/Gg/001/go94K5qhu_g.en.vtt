00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
pumped onto our Shore here and I've

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:33.879 
pumped onto our Shore here and I've
heard<00:02:30.560> it<00:02:30.709> said<00:02:30.829> that<00:02:31.040> that<00:02:31.430> barge<00:02:32.030> is<00:02:32.889> only

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:33.889 
heard it said that that barge is only

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:36.220 
heard it said that that barge is only
allowed<00:02:34.280> to<00:02:34.459> work<00:02:34.639> at<00:02:34.790> night<00:02:35.030> it's<00:02:35.780> enough<00:02:36.049> to

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
allowed to work at night it's enough to

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.660 
allowed to work at night it's enough to
disrupt<00:02:36.530> the<00:02:36.769> view<00:02:36.950> during<00:02:37.069> the<00:02:37.220> day<00:02:37.430> for

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
disrupt the view during the day for

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.710 
disrupt the view during the day for
everybody<00:02:37.940> along<00:02:38.299> the<00:02:38.480> beach<00:02:40.329> which<00:02:41.329> if<00:02:41.510> it's

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
everybody along the beach which if it's

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.210 
everybody along the beach which if it's
true<00:02:41.959> it<00:02:42.170> sounds<00:02:42.350> pretty<00:02:42.530> impressive<00:02:43.100> that

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
true it sounds pretty impressive that

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.580 
true it sounds pretty impressive that
they're<00:02:43.600> concerned<00:02:44.600> about<00:02:44.840> only<00:02:44.989> disrupting

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
they're concerned about only disrupting

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.309 
they're concerned about only disrupting
as<00:02:46.430> minimal<00:02:46.970> number<00:02:47.510> of<00:02:47.720> people<00:02:48.019> as<00:02:48.109> possible

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:48.319 
as minimal number of people as possible

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:50.800 
as minimal number of people as possible
which<00:02:48.980> is<00:02:49.130> which<00:02:49.700> would<00:02:50.150> be<00:02:50.269> the<00:02:50.389> people<00:02:50.630> right

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
which is which would be the people right

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:51.940 
which is which would be the people right
on<00:02:50.959> the<00:02:51.049> beach<00:02:51.170> where<00:02:51.380> the<00:02:51.440> works<00:02:51.590> going<00:02:51.769> on

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
on the beach where the works going on

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.890 
on the beach where the works going on
and<00:02:52.250> not<00:02:52.459> disrupting<00:02:53.120> the<00:02:53.209> entire<00:02:53.239> Beach<00:02:55.900> by

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
and not disrupting the entire Beach by

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.960 
and not disrupting the entire Beach by
putting<00:02:57.530> that<00:02:57.650> eyesore<00:02:58.250> in<00:02:58.430> their<00:02:58.549> views<00:02:58.790> but

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
putting that eyesore in their views but

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.300 
putting that eyesore in their views but
I<00:02:59.470> kind<00:03:00.470> of<00:03:00.500> doubt<00:03:00.650> that<00:03:00.709> I<00:03:00.920> think<00:03:01.220> it's

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
I kind of doubt that I think it's

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:02.630 
I kind of doubt that I think it's
probably<00:03:01.609> just<00:03:01.730> luck<00:03:01.910> with<00:03:02.060> time

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
probably just luck with time

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.260 
probably just luck with time
happens<00:03:02.910> that<00:03:03.090> way<00:03:03.240> because<00:03:04.760> it<00:03:05.760> certainly<00:03:06.000> is

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
happens that way because it certainly is

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:07.370 
happens that way because it certainly is
there<00:03:06.450> now<00:03:06.660> it<00:03:06.810> doesn't<00:03:07.050> look<00:03:07.080> like<00:03:07.170> it's

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
there now it doesn't look like it's

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.770 
there now it doesn't look like it's
going<00:03:07.440> anywhere<00:03:08.270> people<00:03:09.270> are<00:03:09.360> gonna<00:03:09.480> see<00:03:09.690> it

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
going anywhere people are gonna see it
