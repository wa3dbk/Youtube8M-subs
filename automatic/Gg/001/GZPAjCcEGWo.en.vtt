00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:08.139
 There is a hint that makes the consultation fail, ah 

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:09.580
 Oh please think that it will work if you avoid these things Rave him 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:14.560
 I do not hear what I say 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:18.910
 Not nestled not sympathetic to evaluate the decision made I guess with'm usually everyone likely No partner deny 

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:20.240
 It isn't being licked or it's evaluated I wonder what happens if this is said 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:24.320
 Excuse me 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:27.770
 People may change as crispy, but this is often not the case 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:31.700
 We're not hear to say recently of a child who would feel that immediately known 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:34.440
 I say I'm perhaps not that you doing talking like that I Toka but it is difficult I organization 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:37.829
 It is the Tteyuu not listen to 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:42.059
 Neither not not listen to say and say do not listen to what you say defined as the person 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:44.969
 I felt that I did not go to the field because I had a different definition of 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:49.110
 It's hard to be sad It's sad It's hard It's all right 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:51.620
 I'm gonna I'm quite difficult me it Soshitara here that does not go more and more work 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.620
 I'm going 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:58.030
 I advise you to do something without understanding the site 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:03.100
 It will be the reason Well it celebrates not work next 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:03.790
 It leads to a solution without a purpose It stands in the position of the partner who runs to development 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.860
 Oh yes 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:11.870
 The first place even though there is something what you want to not have Mowaka' whether the real purpose of the standing in the position of the other party 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:16.190
 It 's time to listen to something that is going to ask you to say something 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:19.640
 Or you're not are trying listen to what you say while saying the first place that really want 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:23.060
 I'm not ginger, I was thinking about how to listen to say to what no putamen 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.570
 But that consultation that does not go well may do such a thing 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.780
 is 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:30.890
 Where do you think bad cause into the pursuit of your say how 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.890
 He et al. Why what he I guess you will not hear it say blame his opponent What a problem 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.030
 Relationship between Taro and 7 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:39.510
 Even if it does not work well I will give advice immediately 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:44.040
 I Toka'll begin to take a meal First, because it is important to trust 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:48.540
 What I'm saying something Toka Let's tell him the purpose and specific guidance opponent 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:51.480
 Painful Tatte advise the other party to I do not know even the goal that I do not know the site even after the 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:55.860
 There is only a small amount of advice 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:56.820
 So we are sympathetic to the other party is that you let go of this kind of ok to opponent 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.870
 Put out 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:04.030
 So what does happen to you in the field of what it is like not knowing at once 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:07.060
 As I said, I listened more, but I'm steaming after this sheet ahead 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:10.780
 It's in people, but then I'm listening to what it's supposed to be 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:16.000
 In the gap between them there is something that is going to be searched for what is likely to be filled 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:20.410
 Ask them found a likely able to partner me what was Once in basis while in together 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.980
 Anyway, it's just an easy job to say by trying it out 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.020
 is 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:28.510
 That's just that the left side of the front is such a pitfall 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.510
 It means that it will be difficult because you wait
