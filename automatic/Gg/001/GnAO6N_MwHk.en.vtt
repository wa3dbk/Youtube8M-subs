direction<00:01:08.479> can<00:01:09.260> do<00:01:09.350> them<00:01:09.470> a<00:01:09.530> lot<00:01:09.650> of<00:01:09.770> harm<00:01:09.979> not

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
direction can do them a lot of harm not

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.700 
direction can do them a lot of harm not
physical<00:01:11.030> damage<00:01:11.330> but<00:01:11.570> you<00:01:12.170> will<00:01:12.320> be<00:01:12.440> making

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
physical damage but you will be making

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.380 
physical damage but you will be making
that<00:01:12.770> situation<00:01:13.250> a<00:01:13.310> lot<00:01:13.430> harder<00:01:13.670> and<00:01:14.270> it's

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
that situation a lot harder and it's

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.480 
that situation a lot harder and it's
because<00:01:14.659> if<00:01:14.870> a<00:01:15.049> bullet<00:01:15.260> flies<00:01:15.590> just<00:01:15.619> past<00:01:16.250> them

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
because if a bullet flies just past them

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.060 
because if a bullet flies just past them
it<00:01:17.119> blurs<00:01:17.540> their<00:01:17.780> screen<00:01:18.110> and<00:01:18.350> they<00:01:18.650> can't<00:01:18.860> see

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
it blurs their screen and they can't see

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:20.770 
it blurs their screen and they can't see
what<00:01:19.220> the<00:01:19.280> hell's<00:01:19.430> going<00:01:19.670> on<00:01:19.790> it<00:01:20.299> also<00:01:20.450> makes<00:01:20.690> a

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
what the hell's going on it also makes a

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.359 
what the hell's going on it also makes a
big<00:01:20.930> whistling<00:01:21.350> sound<00:01:21.650> in<00:01:21.770> their<00:01:21.890> ears<00:01:22.100> and

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369 
big whistling sound in their ears and

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:23.500 
big whistling sound in their ears and
they<00:01:22.430> can't<00:01:22.640> really<00:01:22.760> hear<00:01:23.030> what's<00:01:23.210> going<00:01:23.270> on

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:23.510 
they can't really hear what's going on

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.570 
they can't really hear what's going on
and<00:01:24.080> altogether<00:01:24.440> their<00:01:24.799> awareness<00:01:24.979> drops<00:01:25.430> and

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
and altogether their awareness drops and

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:26.830 
and altogether their awareness drops and
it<00:01:25.640> makes<00:01:25.790> things<00:01:25.940> a<00:01:26.090> lot<00:01:26.240> more<00:01:26.420> difficult<00:01:26.810> for

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
it makes things a lot more difficult for

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:27.969 
it makes things a lot more difficult for
them<00:01:27.049> to<00:01:27.229> do<00:01:27.350> anything

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
them to do anything

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:30.640 
them to do anything
needless<00:01:28.880> to<00:01:28.909> say<00:01:29.090> like<00:01:30.020> machine<00:01:30.320> guns<00:01:30.500> are

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 
needless to say like machine guns are

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:32.170 
needless to say like machine guns are
the<00:01:30.770> best<00:01:31.040> at<00:01:31.220> suppressive<00:01:31.670> fire<00:01:31.909> they're

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
the best at suppressive fire they're

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.359
