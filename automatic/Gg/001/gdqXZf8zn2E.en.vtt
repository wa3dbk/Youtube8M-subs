but the client doesn't have to use them
I've<00:01:17.280> got<00:01:17.430> technique<00:01:17.820> which<00:01:17.939> is<00:01:18.060> the

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
I've got technique which is the

is<00:01:59.130> a<00:01:59.479> faster<00:02:00.479> version<00:02:00.869> of<00:02:01.200> bucket<00:02:01.799> basically

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
is a faster version of bucket basically

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.300 
is a faster version of bucket basically
they've<00:02:03.810> took<00:02:04.020> bucket<00:02:04.409> and<00:02:04.590> made<00:02:04.829> it<00:02:04.920> faster

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
they've took bucket and made it faster

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
installed we can start our server so it

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:23.980 
installed we can start our server so it
will<00:02:22.490> generate<00:02:22.640> the<00:02:23.030> plugins<00:02:23.510> folder<00:02:23.690> and

everything else we need and just install

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.750 
everything else we need and just install
spigot<00:02:28.160> or<00:02:28.510> bucket<00:02:29.950> so<00:02:30.950> that's<00:02:31.340> it<00:02:31.460> we've<00:02:31.580> got

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
spigot or bucket so that's it we've got

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.870 
spigot or bucket so that's it we've got
our<00:02:32.140> bucket<00:02:33.140> service<00:02:33.590> setup<00:02:33.770> so<00:02:34.640> you<00:02:34.670> see

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
our bucket service setup so you see
