00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 hey all welcome to new black again 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.150
 I leave you your body style today 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.760
 see my quick way of cleaning 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.650
 of my makeup brushes first 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.480
 I started rinsing my 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.880
 I do all brushes piece by piece 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.369
 just rinse with lukewarm water 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.930
 I do this to just the excess 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.289
 makeup that is still hanging on it 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.420
 and hooks under the so to get rid of 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.960
 but I only get with lukewarm water 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.210
 so my brushes never clean if I already 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.109
 I have had my brushes and I fill myself 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.880
 better 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.590
 I just have a separate cup for it 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.270
 it's not that fresh to another 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.210
 use beer wherever you go 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.160
 I fill it with lukewarm water and drink 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.760
 do it again all my makeup 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.170
 brushes I clean kind of movements 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.910
 with a brush to make it as clean as possible 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:53.309
 to immerse them in it very well 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.800
 if i did that if i all 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:59.399
 I have had brushes so I take them again 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.680
 briefly and I also rinse more better 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.359
 and then I fill it up again 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.189
 lukewarm water 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.740
 I do it about a fifth 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:10.350
 because after cosmetic brush cleaner almost 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.170
 is gone and I simply link to it 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.240
 with some lauda and water this is the 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.670
 cosmetic brush cleaner from hema 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.939
 cost of this I will below 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:24.270
 place inma description box 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:27.630
 so I film and water in my cup 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.460
 so just lies loose 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.740
 then I immerse makeup 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.390
 brush in it and as you see it begins 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.400
 a bit cloudy with water 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.170
 to become color 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.119
 so what i just said just with 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.280
 lukewarm water they never get clean 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.270
 now so it is starting to get a bit cleaner 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.950
 to become 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.930
 stupid of me other brushes in it too 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.720
 because my cosmÃ¨tiques plus clean so 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.540
 as good as it is now but you can 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.149
 also just constant limiting was again to 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.820
 rinse funda and refill with a 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.979
 new layer costs with that plus cleaner 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.320
 immerse them well again so that you are sure 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:04.110
 know that your brushes get school because 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.600
 know it is like you with dirty brushes 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.819
 constantly come back on your skin on you 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.590
 skin comes then you can next to van 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.430
 pimples and pimples 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.219
 I do this every week 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.859
 so this is my quick version of it 

00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:18.540
 rinse everything well again with lukewarm 

00:02:17.859 --> 00:02:21.519
 water 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.379
 you can repeat this process as often as 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:26.319
 you want if you really want flat brushes 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:28.000
 very fierce I do more often 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:30.129
 then I rinse them with again 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.900
 lukewarm water if I still have some costs 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:33.280
 I was talking about the bus cleaner 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.799
 thrown over again 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:39.040
 so you can also do that so you are certain 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:41.349
 know that your brushes are really clean 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.510
 I repeat this kvass for brush rinse them 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:45.519
 then off again I can do as often as 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.889
 So you want it yourself, but I definitely wanted it 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:49.480
 from being my brushes just clean 

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:52.180
 to be 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:55.799
 if I have rinsed off all brushes 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.799
 they naturally also go dry again 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.760
 what it is you can choose to it 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.639
 on an offer to do a tissue or 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:06.189
 even above your heating but I rub 

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:08.139
 first dry them on a towel 

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:10.870
 I do this for brush and we know 

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:14.079
 so sure my brushes are back completely 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.969
 fresh and fruity there are again clean this 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:18.519
 was my shorter how to make up brushes 

00:03:15.969 --> 00:03:20.409
 cleaning the fast way 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:22.150
 I hope you enjoy my vlog 

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:24.609

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:27.220

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:30.359
 say again to the next place you
