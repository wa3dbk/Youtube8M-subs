yes a 1964 Chevrolet Impala has been
retrofitted<00:00:22.590> with<00:00:23.070> a<00:00:23.100> 700<00:00:23.730> r4<00:00:23.880> to<00:00:24.660> give<00:00:24.750> it<00:00:24.840> an

retrofitted with a 700 r4 to give it an
overdrive<00:00:25.289> well<00:00:26.099> trouble<00:00:26.400> is<00:00:26.519> it's<00:00:26.730> not

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
overdrive well trouble is it's not

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.810 
overdrive well trouble is it's not
shifting<00:00:27.359> right<00:00:27.510> now<00:00:27.689> so<00:00:28.490> we've<00:00:29.490> checked<00:00:29.699> a

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
shifting right now so we've checked a

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.429 
shifting right now so we've checked a
few<00:00:29.849> things<00:00:30.179> we<00:00:30.269> check<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.599> modulator<00:00:31.140> check

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
few things we check the modulator check

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.799 
few things we check the modulator check
the<00:00:31.560> throttle<00:00:31.949> valve<00:00:31.980> they<00:00:32.969> seem<00:00:33.210> to<00:00:33.360> be<00:00:33.480> okay

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
the throttle valve they seem to be okay

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.970 
the throttle valve they seem to be okay
so<00:00:34.940> we<00:00:35.940> seem<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.329> think<00:00:36.510> and<00:00:36.809> judging<00:00:37.680> by<00:00:37.710> just

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
so we seem to think and judging by just

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.889 
so we seem to think and judging by just
how<00:00:38.100> tightly<00:00:38.670> and<00:00:38.790> how<00:00:38.969> unevenly<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.719> valve

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
how tightly and how unevenly the valve

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.260 
how tightly and how unevenly the valve
body<00:00:40.110> even<00:00:40.379> putting<00:00:40.739> excuse<00:00:41.670> me<00:00:41.790> had<00:00:41.910> been<00:00:42.030> put

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
body even putting excuse me had been put

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.779 
body even putting excuse me had been put
back<00:00:42.480> on<00:00:42.750> by<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.620> previous<00:00:44.129> folks<00:00:44.460> who<00:00:44.610> worked

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
back on by the previous folks who worked

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.369 
back on by the previous folks who worked
on<00:00:44.940> it<00:00:45.000> I<00:00:45.270> would<00:00:45.629> tend<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:45.840> think<00:00:45.930> that<00:00:46.110> one<00:00:46.289> of

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
on it I would tend to think that one of

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.420 
on it I would tend to think that one of
these<00:00:46.469> ship<00:00:46.710> valves<00:00:47.070> inside<00:00:47.340> the

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
these ship valves inside the

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.459 
these ship valves inside the
transmission<00:00:48.059> will<00:00:48.180> be<00:00:48.270> here<00:00:48.539> maybe<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:49.320> little

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
transmission will be here maybe a little

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.060 
transmission will be here maybe a little
bit<00:00:49.559> stuck<00:00:49.940> once<00:00:50.940> it's<00:00:51.590> once<00:00:52.590> will<00:00:52.800> screw<00:00:52.980> into

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
bit stuck once it's once will screw into

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.709 
bit stuck once it's once will screw into
place<00:00:53.190> so<00:00:53.640> we're<00:00:54.149> going<00:00:54.239> to<00:00:54.300> be<00:00:54.390> taking<00:00:54.660> this

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
place so we're going to be taking this

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.360 
place so we're going to be taking this
thing<00:00:54.960> apart<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.440> valve<00:00:55.620> body<00:00:55.800> cleaning<00:00:56.280> it

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
thing apart the valve body cleaning it

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.119 
thing apart the valve body cleaning it
checking<00:00:56.879> it<00:00:57.059> up<00:00:57.180> fluids<00:00:57.870> not<00:00:58.320> not<00:00:58.680> burnt<00:00:58.949> at

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
checking it up fluids not not burnt at

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.110 
checking it up fluids not not burnt at
all<00:00:59.219> there's<00:00:59.489> absolutely<00:00:59.789> nothing<00:00:59.969> wrong

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
all there's absolutely nothing wrong

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.520 
all there's absolutely nothing wrong
with<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.420> clutches<00:01:00.840> or<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.079> band<00:01:01.260> in<00:01:01.410> this

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
with the clutches or the band in this

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.250 
with the clutches or the band in this
transmission<00:01:02.120> again<00:01:03.120> like<00:01:03.449> I<00:01:03.600> think<00:01:03.660> it's

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
transmission again like I think it's

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.010 
transmission again like I think it's
just<00:01:04.350> because<00:01:04.949> it's<00:01:04.979> sticking<00:01:05.970> with<00:01:06.869> all's

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
just because it's sticking with all's

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.270 
just because it's sticking with all's
inside<00:01:07.470> so<00:01:08.570> first<00:01:09.570> things<00:01:09.810> first<00:01:09.900> I<00:01:10.380> want<00:01:11.220> to

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
inside so first things first I want to

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.440 
inside so first things first I want to
check<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:11.640> make<00:01:11.670> sure<00:01:11.760> there's<00:01:12.030> also<00:01:12.119> sold

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
check and make sure there's also sold

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.210 
check and make sure there's also sold
check<00:01:12.689> balls<00:01:12.930> inside<00:01:13.260> these<00:01:13.439> things<00:01:13.500> if<00:01:13.950> some

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
check balls inside these things if some

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.710 
check balls inside these things if some
of<00:01:14.340> you<00:01:14.490> have<00:01:14.640> seen<00:01:14.820> some<00:01:14.880> of<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.270> movies<00:01:15.600> I

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
of you have seen some of the movies I

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.170 
of you have seen some of the movies I
made<00:01:15.869> of<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.020> 204<00:01:16.740> are<00:01:16.950> just<00:01:17.700> how<00:01:17.790> important

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
made of the 204 are just how important

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.880 
made of the 204 are just how important
they<00:01:18.330> were<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.659> do<00:01:18.869> it<00:01:19.020> in<00:01:19.140> that<00:01:19.320> one<00:01:19.500> you<00:01:19.799> have

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
they were to do it in that one you have

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.109 
they were to do it in that one you have
to<00:01:19.979> make<00:01:20.130> sure<00:01:20.220> these<00:01:20.369> valves<00:01:20.729> I'll<00:01:20.880> go<00:01:20.970> back

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
to make sure these valves I'll go back

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.609 
to make sure these valves I'll go back
into<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.450> transmission<00:01:21.840> proper<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.530> this

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
into the transmission proper and this

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.240 
into the transmission proper and this
one<00:01:22.830> as<00:01:22.920> well<00:01:23.100> do<00:01:23.340> so<00:01:24.560> also<00:01:25.560> little<00:01:25.860> pieces

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
one as well do so also little pieces

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.760 
one as well do so also little pieces
this<00:01:26.369> is<00:01:26.430> your<00:01:26.640> throttle<00:01:26.909> valve<00:01:27.090> assembly

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
this is your throttle valve assembly

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.730 
this is your throttle valve assembly
mods<00:01:28.770> with<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.070> little<00:01:29.280> things<00:01:29.579> here<00:01:30.740> because

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
mods with the little things here because

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:32.899 
mods with the little things here because
you've<00:01:32.070> got<00:01:32.159> to<00:01:32.250> be<00:01:32.310> careful<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.790> get

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
you've got to be careful to get

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:33.920 
you've got to be careful to get
everything<00:01:33.060> back<00:01:33.270> in<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.450> proper<00:01:33.750> sequence

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
everything back in the proper sequence

everything back in the proper sequence
you<00:01:34.229> know<00:01:34.350> there's<00:01:34.619> little<00:01:34.970> check<00:01:35.970> balls<00:01:36.210> in

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
you know there's little check balls in

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.080 
you know there's little check balls in
some<00:01:36.509> of<00:01:36.570> these<00:01:36.659> passages<00:01:36.869> one<00:01:37.770> two<00:01:39.380> three<00:01:41.090> we

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
some of these passages one two three we

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.730 
some of these passages one two three we
have<00:01:42.329> a<00:01:42.360> fourth<00:01:42.780> one<00:01:42.990> over<00:01:43.020> here<00:01:43.350> as<00:01:43.409> well<00:01:43.590> too

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
have a fourth one over here as well too

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.200 
have a fourth one over here as well too
which<00:01:43.829> is<00:01:43.979> a<00:01:44.009> larger<00:01:44.430> size<00:01:44.640> I<00:01:44.790> thought<00:01:45.030> that's

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
which is a larger size I thought that's

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.789 
which is a larger size I thought that's
called<00:01:45.450> a<00:01:45.509> throttle<00:01:45.869> exhaust<00:01:46.259> them<00:01:46.530> check

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
called a throttle exhaust them check

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.560 
called a throttle exhaust them check
ball<00:01:47.009> they<00:01:47.670> make<00:01:47.909> sure<00:01:48.000> that<00:01:48.090> all<00:01:48.270> these<00:01:48.390> are

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570

again<00:02:32.510> we<00:02:32.630> could<00:02:32.780> play<00:02:32.960> with<00:02:33.110> Springs<00:02:33.440> and<00:02:33.590> you

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
again we could play with Springs and you

again we could play with Springs and you
play<00:02:33.860> with<00:02:34.010> different<00:02:34.400> sorts<00:02:34.610> of<00:02:35.050> sleeves<00:02:36.050> to

some hole the separator plate which have
all<00:02:41.480> these<00:02:41.600> little<00:02:41.750> passages<00:02:42.320> this<00:02:42.830> is<00:02:42.980> an

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
all these little passages this is an

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.060 
all these little passages this is an
amazing<00:02:43.850> and<00:02:44.540> you<00:02:44.810> might<00:02:44.960> have<00:02:45.050> to<00:02:45.140> drill<00:02:45.500> one

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
amazing and you might have to drill one

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:47.800 
amazing and you might have to drill one
going<00:02:46.370> from<00:02:46.550> the<00:02:46.640> one<00:02:46.820> to<00:02:47.000> shift<00:02:47.330> valve<00:02:47.540> into

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
going from the one to shift valve into

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.240 
going from the one to shift valve into
another<00:02:48.080> passage<00:02:48.500> I<00:02:48.590> forget<00:02:48.860> which<00:02:48.950> one<00:02:49.010> it

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
another passage I forget which one it

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.490 
another passage I forget which one it
was<00:02:49.280> exactly<00:02:49.850> but<00:02:50.140> that's<00:02:51.140> what<00:02:51.320> we<00:02:51.410> have

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
was exactly but that's what we have

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.870 
was exactly but that's what we have
these<00:02:51.650> structures<00:02:51.980> for<00:02:52.160> so<00:02:52.280> we<00:02:52.370> never<00:02:52.550> forget

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
these structures for so we never forget

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.140 
these structures for so we never forget
about<00:02:53.000> this<00:02:53.270> sort<00:02:53.510> of<00:02:53.570> stuff<00:02:53.810> and<00:02:54.610> but<00:02:55.610> but<00:02:56.030> um

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
about this sort of stuff and but but um

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.360 
about this sort of stuff and but but um
it'll<00:02:56.420> be<00:02:56.540> a<00:02:56.570> whole<00:02:56.780> sequence<00:02:57.110> of<00:02:57.320> stuff<00:02:57.560> that

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
it'll be a whole sequence of stuff that

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.060 
it'll be a whole sequence of stuff that
we're<00:02:58.460> going<00:02:58.550> to<00:02:58.610> be<00:02:58.700> doing<00:02:58.880> over<00:02:59.090> here<00:02:59.240> and

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
we're going to be doing over here and

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.500 
we're going to be doing over here and
hopefully<00:03:01.070> the<00:03:01.340> 64<00:03:01.880> will<00:03:01.970> be<00:03:02.060> running<00:03:02.330> really

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
hopefully the 64 will be running really

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.580 
hopefully the 64 will be running really
nice<00:03:03.140> again<00:03:03.770> real<00:03:03.950> soon<00:03:04.190> so<00:03:05.110> here<00:03:06.110> we<00:03:06.230> have<00:03:06.440> it
