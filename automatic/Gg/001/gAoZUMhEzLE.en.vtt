00:00:04.229 --> 00:00:10.740
 hello my name is daniel weber and you 

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:10.740
 itself was once a sport.de 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.439
 in this dvd deal with the 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:20.000
 main component of the 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:21.470
 Team training you can do it that way 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.750
 maybe break down 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.700
 every good essay starts at school 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.070
 with the beginning with the main part and 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:31.090
 and now we move 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.090
 really in the main part 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:39.190
 in the main part we take care of 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:42.070
 tactical ways to play games 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.300
 Openings around the goal we reach 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.210
 want to score goals 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.980
 we try again and again 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.690
 play situation out at those 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.690
 to improve the mirror 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:55.330
 to offer that in solutions 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:58.180
 They always know under the stress 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:59.710
 of the game, when can I do something and 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.150
 where can i rely on that 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.089
 now even if I do not have it right now 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:06.910
 see one of my fellow players stands 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:08.920
 to give players the tools 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:11.740
 his technical possibilities with 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:15.250
 to play around a player's openings 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:18.070
 always to create a game idea 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:21.010
 to keep track of that again and that 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:24.090
 under low stress but under one 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.090
 great accuracy 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.530
 you see very often in the high class 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:34.130
 teams the real ways 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.840
 are predetermined and the players 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.060
 Just know what to do when 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.320
 We also have our goal to pursue 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.320
 namely to shoot the gate
