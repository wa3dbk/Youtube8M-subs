really be new year or not so I kind of
built<00:00:32.579> my<00:00:32.759> team<00:00:33.000> err<00:00:33.030> on<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.239> basis<00:00:33.600> of<00:00:33.630> what<00:00:34.440> I

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
built my team err on the basis of what I

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.580 
built my team err on the basis of what I
think<00:00:34.649> will<00:00:35.219> for<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.000> most<00:00:36.030> part<00:00:36.480> really<00:00:36.780> Buu

think will for the most part really Buu

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.250 
think will for the most part really Buu
so<00:00:38.250> that's<00:00:38.850> kind<00:00:39.059> of<00:00:39.090> what<00:00:39.210> my<00:00:39.329> team<00:00:39.540> is<00:00:39.750> just

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
my own zap just in case you switches out

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.650 
my own zap just in case you switches out
to<00:02:51.040> anything<00:02:51.220> else<00:02:51.430> tactical<00:02:52.390> just<00:02:52.540> be<00:02:52.629> a

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
to anything else tactical just be a

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.589 
to anything else tactical just be a
overall<00:02:53.049> safe<00:02:53.379> move<00:02:53.620> otherwise<00:02:54.000> it's<00:02:55.000> like<00:02:55.299> I

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:55.599 
overall safe move otherwise it's like I

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:57.360 
overall safe move otherwise it's like I
can<00:02:55.870> just<00:02:55.900> get<00:02:56.349> the<00:02:56.500> status<00:02:56.799> on<00:02:56.890> the<00:02:56.980> melodic

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
can just get the status on the melodic

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.069 
can just get the status on the melodic
which<00:02:57.640> will<00:02:58.180> probably<00:02:58.420> be<00:02:58.540> hard<00:02:58.750> to<00:02:58.840> deal<00:02:58.959> with

00:02:59.069 --> 00:02:59.079 
which will probably be hard to deal with

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:01.319 
which will probably be hard to deal with
later<00:02:59.290> on<00:02:59.500> but<00:02:59.890> whatever<00:03:00.430> the<00:03:00.489> case<00:03:00.549> he<00:03:01.150> brings

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:01.329 
later on but whatever the case he brings

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:02.640 
later on but whatever the case he brings
in<00:03:01.450> the<00:03:01.510> floor<00:03:01.690> geez<00:03:01.870> and<00:03:02.079> I'm<00:03:02.230> gonna<00:03:02.470> go

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
in the floor geez and I'm gonna go

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.440 
in the floor geez and I'm gonna go
switching<00:03:03.250> to<00:03:03.280> metagross<00:03:03.700> cuz<00:03:04.060> no<00:03:04.299> matter

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
switching to metagross cuz no matter

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:05.910 
switching to metagross cuz no matter
what<00:03:04.629> he<00:03:04.690> does<00:03:04.810> metagross<00:03:05.260> can<00:03:05.470> take<00:03:05.620> a<00:03:05.650> hit

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
what he does metagross can take a hit

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.580 
what he does metagross can take a hit
well<00:03:06.129> enough<00:03:06.280> so<00:03:06.760> I'm<00:03:07.420> just<00:03:07.569> gonna<00:03:07.659> try<00:03:07.989> and<00:03:08.319> go

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
well enough so I'm just gonna try and go

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.020 
well enough so I'm just gonna try and go
for<00:03:08.620> the<00:03:08.859> earthquake<00:03:09.430> right<00:03:09.640> here<00:03:09.819> cuz<00:03:09.970> i

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
for the earthquake right here cuz i

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.160 
for the earthquake right here cuz i
figured<00:03:10.299> need<00:03:10.390> to<00:03:10.450> touch<00:03:10.599> up<00:03:10.720> predicting<00:03:10.959> the

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
figured need to touch up predicting the

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:12.360 
figured need to touch up predicting the
meteor<00:03:11.409> mash<00:03:11.590> i<00:03:11.799> figured<00:03:12.069> you<00:03:12.159> would<00:03:12.280> go<00:03:12.340> to

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
meteor mash i figured you would go to

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.580 
meteor mash i figured you would go to
milotic<00:03:12.940> or<00:03:13.120> something<00:03:13.450> so<00:03:13.780> i<00:03:14.019> thought

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
milotic or something so i thought

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:15.899 
milotic or something so i thought
earthquake<00:03:14.980> would<00:03:15.129> be<00:03:15.250> the<00:03:15.340> best<00:03:15.489> move<00:03:15.579> to<00:03:15.700> go

00:03:15.899 --> 00:03:15.909 
earthquake would be the best move to go

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:17.940 
earthquake would be the best move to go
for<00:03:16.209> because<00:03:16.480> although<00:03:17.079> i<00:03:17.349> wouldn't<00:03:17.650> do<00:03:17.799> too

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
for because although i wouldn't do too

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.440 
for because although i wouldn't do too
much<00:03:18.069> damage<00:03:18.130> to<00:03:18.519> my<00:03:18.760> load<00:03:18.940> it<00:03:19.060> could<00:03:19.150> be<00:03:19.269> a

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
much damage to my load it could be a

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.330 
much damage to my load it could be a
nice<00:03:19.900> chunk<00:03:20.200> and<00:03:20.440> then<00:03:20.590> i<00:03:20.620> can<00:03:20.829> easily<00:03:20.950> pivot

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
nice chunk and then i can easily pivot

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.879 
nice chunk and then i can easily pivot
up<00:03:21.430> to<00:03:21.549> something<00:03:21.880> else<00:03:21.970> so<00:03:22.690> that<00:03:23.590> was<00:03:23.680> kind<00:03:23.859> of

in zapdos if he wants to protect he just

00:05:56.349 --> 00:05:58.320 
in zapdos if he wants to protect he just
puts<00:05:56.529> himself<00:05:56.680> in<00:05:56.949> his<00:05:57.039> own<00:05:57.159> kill<00:05:57.520> range<00:05:57.759> so

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:58.330 
puts himself in his own kill range so

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.089 
puts himself in his own kill range so
I'm<00:05:58.419> not<00:05:58.539> too<00:05:58.719> concerned<00:05:58.900> about<00:05:59.110> that<00:05:59.289> if<00:05:59.680> you

00:06:00.089 --> 00:06:00.099 
I'm not too concerned about that if you

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:02.129 
I'm not too concerned about that if you
were<00:06:00.190> covered<00:06:00.599> he<00:06:01.599> would<00:06:01.719> still<00:06:01.930> take<00:06:02.080> a

00:06:02.129 --> 00:06:02.139 
were covered he would still take a

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:03.749 
were covered he would still take a
thunderbolt<00:06:02.680> which<00:06:02.860> would<00:06:03.069> do<00:06:03.190> a<00:06:03.219> ton<00:06:03.729> of

00:06:03.749 --> 00:06:03.759 
thunderbolt which would do a ton of

00:06:03.759 --> 00:06:05.670 
thunderbolt which would do a ton of
damage<00:06:04.000> and<00:06:04.210> skull<00:06:04.659> earned<00:06:04.900> the<00:06:05.169> toxic<00:06:05.560> is

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:05.680 
damage and skull earned the toxic is

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.070 
damage and skull earned the toxic is
still<00:06:06.009> just<00:06:06.129> wearing<00:06:06.340> him<00:06:06.520> down<00:06:06.599> so<00:06:07.599> you<00:06:07.990> know

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:08.080 
still just wearing him down so you know

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.360 
still just wearing him down so you know
that's<00:06:08.259> kind<00:06:08.409> of<00:06:08.440> thing<00:06:08.680> but<00:06:08.830> he<00:06:08.949> decided<00:06:09.279> to

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:09.370 
that's kind of thing but he decided to

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:11.010 
that's kind of thing but he decided to
go<00:06:09.610> triangle<00:06:10.060> for<00:06:10.180> double<00:06:10.479> Protectorate

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:11.020 
go triangle for double Protectorate

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:12.420 
go triangle for double Protectorate
there<00:06:11.199> he<00:06:11.409> really<00:06:11.710> should<00:06:11.889> just<00:06:12.099> tried<00:06:12.279> and

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:12.430 
there he really should just tried and

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:14.010 
there he really should just tried and
recovered<00:06:12.849> that<00:06:13.029> what<00:06:13.150> is<00:06:13.270> his<00:06:13.629> best<00:06:13.870> play

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:14.020 
recovered that what is his best play

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:16.409 
recovered that what is his best play
even<00:06:14.349> though<00:06:14.460> Thunderbolt<00:06:15.460> should<00:06:15.699> still

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:16.419 
even though Thunderbolt should still

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:18.269 
even though Thunderbolt should still
should<00:06:16.659> have<00:06:16.690> done<00:06:16.930> a<00:06:16.960> lot<00:06:17.169> so<00:06:17.440> really<00:06:18.039> when<00:06:18.159> it

00:06:18.269 --> 00:06:18.279 
should have done a lot so really when it

right now it's kinda iffy because

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:05.670 
right now it's kinda iffy because
obviously<00:07:03.000> not<00:07:04.000> everything's<00:07:04.480> fully<00:07:04.810> done

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:05.680

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:09.690 
yet they just put it out there to put it
out<00:07:07.660> there<00:07:07.900> but<00:07:08.169> well<00:07:09.010> it's<00:07:09.130> parent<00:07:09.460> with<00:07:09.580> it

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:09.700 
out there but well it's parent with it

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:11.580 
out there but well it's parent with it
more<00:07:09.880> I<00:07:10.120> mean<00:07:10.480> no<00:07:10.630> doubt<00:07:10.840> in<00:07:10.960> my<00:07:10.990> mind<00:07:11.169> I<00:07:11.350> want

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:11.590 
more I mean no doubt in my mind I want

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:13.620 
more I mean no doubt in my mind I want
to<00:07:11.710> play<00:07:11.860> you<00:07:11.919> you<00:07:12.280> but<00:07:12.850> it's<00:07:13.210> just<00:07:13.450> gonna<00:07:13.540> take

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:13.630 
to play you you but it's just gonna take

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:15.590 
to play you you but it's just gonna take
a<00:07:13.810> little<00:07:14.020> bit<00:07:14.139> to<00:07:14.260> get<00:07:14.350> it<00:07:14.410> really<00:07:14.800> shaped<00:07:15.100> but

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:15.600 
a little bit to get it really shaped but

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:18.060 
a little bit to get it really shaped but
you<00:07:16.600> know<00:07:16.750> there<00:07:17.139> this<00:07:17.560> game<00:07:17.740> was<00:07:17.860> still

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:18.070 
you know there this game was still

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:20.129 
you know there this game was still
falling<00:07:18.250> and<00:07:18.490> I<00:07:18.700> feel<00:07:19.419> like<00:07:19.600> this<00:07:19.750> is<00:07:19.870> more

00:07:20.129 --> 00:07:20.139 
falling and I feel like this is more

00:07:20.139 --> 00:07:22.230 
falling and I feel like this is more
what<00:07:20.169> you<00:07:20.470> you<00:07:20.680> will<00:07:20.950> be<00:07:21.240> obviously

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:22.240 
what you you will be obviously

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.719 
what you you will be obviously
reminiscent<00:07:22.840> of<00:07:22.930> 5th<00:07:23.380> gen<00:07:23.830> you<00:07:24.070> you<00:07:24.250> a<00:07:24.280> bit<00:07:24.550> but

00:07:24.719 --> 00:07:24.729 
reminiscent of 5th gen you you a bit but

00:07:24.729 --> 00:07:26.310 
reminiscent of 5th gen you you a bit but
that's<00:07:24.850> just<00:07:25.030> seemed<00:07:25.270> like<00:07:25.330> the<00:07:25.450> common<00:07:25.900> trend

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:26.320 
that's just seemed like the common trend

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:28.920 
that's just seemed like the common trend
but<00:07:27.250> you<00:07:27.760> know<00:07:27.850> we'll<00:07:28.150> see<00:07:28.180> what<00:07:28.330> happens<00:07:28.510> but
