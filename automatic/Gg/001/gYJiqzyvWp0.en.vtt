00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:08.140 
two little ball it's probably about 1.2

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:10.820 
two little ball it's probably about 1.2
meters<00:05:08.470> wide<00:05:08.680> I'd<00:05:08.919> say<00:05:09.160> with<00:05:09.400> four<00:05:09.669> screws

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830 
meters wide I'd say with four screws

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:14.040 
meters wide I'd say with four screws
screwed<00:05:11.830> through<00:05:12.130> now<00:05:13.120> we've<00:05:13.270> got<00:05:13.510> four<00:05:13.840> big

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 
screwed through now we've got four big

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.340 
screwed through now we've got four big
boards<00:05:14.530> for<00:05:14.710> we're<00:05:14.860> about<00:05:15.040> 1.8<00:05:15.610> meters<00:05:16.350> with

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:17.350 
boards for we're about 1.8 meters with

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:21.719 
boards for we're about 1.8 meters with
holes<00:05:17.650> drilled<00:05:18.280> in<00:05:18.490> for<00:05:18.760> spots<00:05:19.710> so<00:05:20.710> I<00:05:20.740> think<00:05:21.010> no

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:21.729 
holes drilled in for spots so I think no

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:23.820 
holes drilled in for spots so I think no
no<00:05:21.760> holes<00:05:22.210> drilled<00:05:22.510> in<00:05:22.630> to<00:05:22.840> spot<00:05:23.140> top<00:05:23.620> and

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:23.830 
no holes drilled in to spot top and

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:25.010 
no holes drilled in to spot top and
bottom<00:05:24.100> only

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 
bottom only

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.610 
bottom only
okay<00:05:25.590> I'll<00:05:26.280> set<00:05:26.580> this<00:05:26.730> up<00:05:26.970> and<00:05:27.500> give<00:05:28.500> you<00:05:28.590> a

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:31.670 
look at my cunning stealth camper design

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:35.990 
look at my cunning stealth camper design
that'll<00:05:32.670> give<00:05:32.820> you<00:05:32.910> a<00:05:32.940> laugh<00:05:33.950> okay<00:05:34.950> so<00:05:35.250> you<00:05:35.670> can

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:38.220 
see I may have got distracted with some

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.460 
see I may have got distracted with some
aquaponics<00:05:38.850> work<00:05:39.090> and<00:05:39.480> it's<00:05:39.660> actually<00:05:40.140> almost

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:40.470 
aquaponics work and it's actually almost

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:44.030 
aquaponics work and it's actually almost
dark<00:05:40.680> now<00:05:41.990> but<00:05:42.990> I<00:05:43.020> think<00:05:43.230> you<00:05:43.500> can<00:05:43.770> get<00:05:43.920> the

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:44.040 
dark now but I think you can get the

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:47.450 
dark now but I think you can get the
gist<00:05:44.250> of<00:05:44.490> what<00:05:44.550> goes<00:05:44.910> on<00:05:45.320> so<00:05:46.320> the<00:05:46.560> short<00:05:46.830> beams

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.460 
gist of what goes on so the short beams

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.270 
gist of what goes on so the short beams
went<00:05:47.910> across<00:05:48.120> that<00:05:48.240> way<00:05:48.630> and<00:05:48.930> they<00:05:49.890> just<00:05:50.100> get

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:50.280 
went across that way and they just get

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:55.390 
went across that way and they just get
screwed<00:05:50.990> see<00:05:51.990> if<00:05:52.080> I<00:05:52.170> can<00:05:52.380> zoom<00:05:52.830> in<00:05:53.070> on<00:05:53.130> that

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:55.400 
screwed see if I can zoom in on that

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:59.510 
screwed see if I can zoom in on that
this<00:05:56.400> is<00:05:56.640> little<00:05:56.940> screws<00:05:58.100> they<00:05:59.100> just<00:05:59.340> get

00:05:59.510 --> 00:05:59.520 
this is little screws they just get

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:04.970 
this is little screws they just get
screwed<00:05:59.760> together<00:06:00.180> like<00:06:00.450> that<00:06:03.590> four<00:06:04.590> places

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:04.980 
screwed together like that four places

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:08.150 
screwed together like that four places
on<00:06:05.340> the<00:06:05.430> way<00:06:05.520> across<00:06:05.790> and<00:06:06.710> I<00:06:07.710> haven't<00:06:08.010> bothered

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:08.160 
on the way across and I haven't bothered

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.560 
on the way across and I haven't bothered
to<00:06:08.400> put<00:06:08.550> it<00:06:08.670> on<00:06:08.790> because<00:06:09.060> I<00:06:09.120> wanted<00:06:09.330> to<00:06:09.420> be<00:06:09.510> able

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:09.570 
to put it on because I wanted to be able

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:13.130 
to put it on because I wanted to be able
to<00:06:09.690> show<00:06:09.930> you<00:06:10.250> how<00:06:11.250> it<00:06:11.370> works<00:06:11.870> let<00:06:12.870> me<00:06:12.960> just

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:13.140 
to show you how it works let me just

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:16.400 
to show you how it works let me just
drop<00:06:13.350> this<00:06:13.500> on<00:06:13.740> just<00:06:14.610> the<00:06:14.790> NP<00:06:15.180> supply<00:06:15.570> doesn't

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:16.410 
drop this on just the NP supply doesn't

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:17.630 
drop this on just the NP supply doesn't
need<00:06:16.590> the<00:06:16.710> whole<00:06:16.890> weight<00:06:17.130> because<00:06:17.460> these

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:17.640 
need the whole weight because these

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:20.660 
need the whole weight because these
cross<00:06:17.880> members<00:06:18.950> what<00:06:19.950> will<00:06:20.100> take<00:06:20.280> your<00:06:20.490> weight

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:20.670 
cross members what will take your weight

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:23.690 
cross members what will take your weight
folks<00:06:21.030> and<00:06:21.620> that's<00:06:22.620> the<00:06:23.070> simple<00:06:23.490> bit

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:23.700 
folks and that's the simple bit

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:27.020 
folks and that's the simple bit
conversion<00:06:24.770> for<00:06:25.770> the<00:06:25.830> delica<00:06:26.310> is<00:06:26.520> it<00:06:26.760> a<00:06:26.850> little

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:27.030 
conversion for the delica is it a little

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:30.650 
conversion for the delica is it a little
bit<00:06:27.240> rickety<00:06:28.040> -<00:06:29.040> damn<00:06:29.250> right<00:06:29.520> does<00:06:30.450> that

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:30.660 
bit rickety - damn right does that

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:34.400 
bit rickety - damn right does that
matter<00:06:30.870> no<00:06:31.650> way<00:06:31.950> it<00:06:32.700> works<00:06:32.910> a<00:06:33.090> treat<00:06:33.290> the<00:06:34.290> other

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:34.410 
matter no way it works a treat the other

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:36.460 
matter no way it works a treat the other
thing<00:06:34.620> I<00:06:34.680> quite<00:06:34.950> like<00:06:35.190> is<00:06:35.460> even<00:06:35.760> folded<00:06:36.210> down

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:36.470 
thing I quite like is even folded down

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:38.600 
thing I quite like is even folded down
you<00:06:37.470> can<00:06:37.650> see<00:06:37.830> I've<00:06:37.950> got<00:06:38.040> a<00:06:38.100> bit<00:06:38.280> of<00:06:38.310> shelf

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:38.610 
you can see I've got a bit of shelf

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:40.490 
you can see I've got a bit of shelf
space<00:06:38.790> in<00:06:38.970> there<00:06:39.330> I<00:06:39.360> put<00:06:39.600> my<00:06:39.750> kitchen<00:06:40.080> up<00:06:40.230> under

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:40.500
