00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
was noticeably peeling like I had to

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.589

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:25.599 
like exfoliate but I didn't exfoliate

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:27.590 
like exfoliate but I didn't exfoliate
because<00:02:25.870> I<00:02:25.959> don't<00:02:26.110> have<00:02:26.290> to<00:02:26.440> wear<00:02:26.530> makeup<00:02:26.889> so

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
because I don't have to wear makeup so

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.360 
because I don't have to wear makeup so
it<00:02:28.600> wasn't<00:02:28.870> that<00:02:28.900> big<00:02:29.109> of<00:02:29.230> a<00:02:29.290> problem<00:02:29.319> and<00:02:30.250> I

it wasn't that big of a problem and I

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.620 
it wasn't that big of a problem and I
noticed<00:02:30.670> like<00:02:30.850> I<00:02:31.000> started<00:02:31.569> getting<00:02:33.630> clearer

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630
