anyone who has minecraft right now and

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.479 
anyone who has minecraft right now and
they're<00:02:44.989> worried<00:02:45.380> that<00:02:45.650> if<00:02:45.860> Microsoft

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
they're worried that if Microsoft

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:48.520 
they're worried that if Microsoft
purchases<00:02:47.030> it<00:02:47.209> they<00:02:47.690> can't<00:02:47.930> play<00:02:48.140> it<00:02:48.290> on<00:02:48.380> their

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
purchases it they can't play it on their

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.949 
purchases it they can't play it on their
PlayStation<00:02:49.040> or<00:02:50.030> they<00:02:50.239> can't<00:02:50.450> play<00:02:50.690> it<00:02:50.720> on

their phone or anything like that

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.680 
their phone or anything like that
however<00:02:53.750> I<00:02:54.250> believe<00:02:55.250> that<00:02:55.670> Microsoft<00:02:56.330> if<00:02:56.540> they
