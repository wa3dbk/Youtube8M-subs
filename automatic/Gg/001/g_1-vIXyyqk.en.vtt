00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.880
 all right 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.209
 now we are on board one of the 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:19.529
 last releases leave one that is the 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:21.810
 of 150 as a reason that this is conceived 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.329
 it's exactly the time together with my 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.189
 brothers and my father we launched this 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:28.890
 equipito for people who know that 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.920
 begins in the nautical sector precisely which 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.660
 his team small but comfortable and very 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.440
 good navigability for the one that starts 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.440
 in this area 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:48.500
 what are the general dimensions a 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:51.680
 equipment that has 460 length 189 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.390
 of sleeve and 0 90 of strut we are talking 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.710
 of two just mentioned two details 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.170
 that maybe the people who start the 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.270
 nautical does not know but the sleeve that 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.510
 you mentioned is a manga more than 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:04.010
 generous and the same the prop can 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.080
 explain to the people what a 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:09.590
 strut of these measures are these 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.150
 dimensions and in principle the sleeve 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.670
 gives a great stability to the marking 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.770
 which gives the client security by 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.240
 On the other hand, good prop is what it does 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.979
 have security for the kids 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.840
 who are on board the boat 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:25.390
 they feel safe having the little ones 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.390
 under an important embankment of height 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.670
 apart from having an important hand 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.590
 What other feature to highlight 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.440
 has the bottom of this boat is a 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.540
 little fund that we have brought from outside that 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.190
 is a touch navigates very well has the 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.810
 good sleeve and we have also applied 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:57.290
 the stick be of all the boats 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.390
 like the 185 of 160 the cudi and 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.369
 this marking we apply the same 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.900
 system which allows you to navigate with 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:04.670
 much less fuel quantity and with 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.410
 less powers you know we're 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.020
 talking about powers I would like that 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:11.060
 Say the minimum with which you can 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.010
 navigate the boat well and the maximum 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.800
 for which this is enabled 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:18.739
 boat starts from 40 hp to 70 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:22.459
 hp ideally recommended by the company 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:25.370
 it's a 50 or 60 if possible 70 is a 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.810
 luxury left and the 40 so that initiated 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.640
 three people who up to four suns 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.350
 we would say that this would make it feasible for 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.670
 use the things that interest the 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.040
 people who are nautical to a 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.720
 little motor of 60 hp like what we are 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.400
 proving that consumption has 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.650
 approximately is a little button that is 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.959
 oil mixture in principle and has a 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.980
 average naphtha consumption between 10 and 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:44.980
 the 11 liters of naphtha 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.180
 what is the equipment that brings the 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:13.420
 boat because this is an item 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.459
 let's say a pretty market segment 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.200
 difficult is the first Argentine 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:19.269
 boat is a team has 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.799
 quite full so it 's come 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:22.860
 with poop with bow tone 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:25.599
 comes with fuel bilge pump 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:28.660
 the 24-year-old engine brings it 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:30.940
 buy customer obsessed good there 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.700
 many factory in the upholstery 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:36.510
 complete curved windshield and lights 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.510
 navigation and fittings 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:50.480
 the family that buys the 750 what is 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.280
 question is how many members can 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.230
 take on board for how many people 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.760
 are enabled by luck in 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:57.680
 prefectures does not have authorization to 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.959
 six adults so we are more than more 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.300
 how good are we then and exl in 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:03.860
 construction techniques good as 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.290
 provided that a better quality use in 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:09.220
 the market we buy the best is the coti 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:11.320
 the best resins and the best fiber 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.690
 has the same quality as when buying 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:17.739
 a boat once a 160 or 185 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:19.380
 even a rocket would say that yes it has 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:20.820
 optional 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.440
 that I do not have gentlemen that others no longer 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.830
 they bring but they have the best quality 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.830
 brand are 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.770
 both of the mother 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:41.210
 The guarantee offered by the brand 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.130
 good buyer as long as a 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:45.229
 gives the client his five years of 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:48.689
 transferable guarantee 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:50.849
 In case you do not sell shares 

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:54.479
 I keep asking, I always put in 

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:56.509
 a first vessel comparator is 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:59.369
 difficult to buy about 150 at this time 

00:04:56.509 --> 00:05:01.409
 It is a team that has some prices 

00:04:59.369 --> 00:05:02.969
 very reasonable has the quality has 

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:06.670
 a price ratio I would finally say I 

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:09.870
 very logical very logical 

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:09.870
 to say 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:18.660
 do not 

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:26.040
 throughout the note we were left with 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:28.650
 say that customers who start the 

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:31.440
 can purchase a boat with 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:34.230
 very nice completions with very good 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:36.140
 feasibility and obviously with the 

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:38.280
 backing of the guarantee I always left a 

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:40.860
 would have liked to thank the time that 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:42.720
 has given us the facilitation of 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:45.000
 unit to test the cert in technique 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:47.250
 as always we make a gift are 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.690
 the pacific union glasses in follow 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:50.690
 we are with the final comments 

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:11.580
 we turn now to our comments 

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:14.400
 final the f-150 is the first step of 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:16.890
 the family of boats g is one 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.780
 ideal launch to start in nautical 

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:21.630
 sports for several reasons many of 

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:24.060
 which you have heard is 

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:26.160
 difficult to find in this one achieves a 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:28.860
 sleeve of similar importance which 

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:31.410
 results in inner comfort and for 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:33.870
 course in navigation conditions the 

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:35.820
 brand continues to maintain the successful 

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:37.830
 designs of your funds those that have 

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:40.220
 allowed and provided very good 

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:42.810
 results with excellent performance is 

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:44.460
 we went to the navigation test this 

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:47.330
 unit is equipped with a yamaha engine 

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:49.830
 two times of 60 hp of power 

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:52.200
 our records gave a speed 

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:55.890
 average cruise of 22 knots and one 

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:57.930
 end speed of 32 knots to regime 

00:06:55.890 --> 00:07:00.480
 Consumer cruise indicated for this 

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:02.880
 engine is between 10 and 11 liters 

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:05.790
 now the bird that has the bow 

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:08.970
 boat also collaborates to a 

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:11.400
 smooth and effective navigation has a 

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:12.480
 immediate response to the maneuvers their 

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.520
 rudder is smooth 

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:18.030
 It is an extremely easy boat 

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:20.670
 carry on concluding the f-150 leave one is 

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:22.950
 an excellent opportunity that they have 

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:24.870
 who want to start in this 

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:27.800
 activity of nautical sports with 

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:27.800
 a boat 0 hours
