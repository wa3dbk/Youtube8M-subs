00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.799
 that's how it all looks like in london 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.629
 work was a developed 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.189
 Radwegenetz failed 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.040
 on most streets in the center 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.210
 bicyclists share cars and buses 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.370
 lorry the roadway 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.220
 who wants to do so needs courage 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.109
 and luckily reporter is one 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.640
 from them every day just empty from the 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.189
 south london to his workplace 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.590
 a theater in the city for some time 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.570
 Time often with helmet camera the apple 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:32.099
 documenting what's on London's streets 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.730
 I've had a couple of accidents 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.620
 not many 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.850
 Often an oil spill is the cause or 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.510
 you get into one of the many 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.399
 potholes 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.290
 but I was already hit by 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.010
 a car and I have the right one 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.010
 broken clavicle 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:49.370
 Find the pictures of the helmet cameras 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.370
 quickly make your way to the net 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:55.129
 Hundreds of clips show everyday life 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.129
 the streets of London 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.030
 The media is already calling it a war 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:12.030
 You can not really one or the other 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.500
 the other side blame it 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.119
 There are black sheep everywhere 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.220
 cyclists as well as the car 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.470
 but the cyclist is a lot 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.680
 more endangered so he needs more 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.680
 protection 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.540
 The number of cyclists in London is rising 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.040
 many from year to year are the 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.590
 public transport too expensive 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.210
 or too full and the car comes to you 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:35.590
 hardly any progresses 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:37.150
 I added thousands of rental bikes 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.500
 I've seen a few accidents but 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.500
 you just have to take care of yourself 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.280
 everyone comes here just too close 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:49.570
 Nobody takes into consideration especially the 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:51.910
 taxi driver not quite 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.830
 Nervous it is everywhere this 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:57.090
 traffic but at the same time exciting 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:59.680
 he does that, too 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.020
 The accident statistics are terrifying 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.310
 More than 120 cyclists are in the 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.580
 past two years in london 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:09.070
 deadly accident does not always work 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.660
 like here just good for 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.400
 more security on the streets wants 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.560
 London Mayor Boris Johnson also 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.200
 he cares for himself almost every day 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.330
 to work recently, he has his big 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.070
 Visions for London presents the 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.290
 a million metropolises should become a city 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.030
 for two-wheeled vehicles are wheeled boulevard 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.730
 it like this along the thames the 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.040
 cost a billion euros to fit 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:33.790
 that 2014 on the tour de france station 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.769
 in London, vision makes the ben potter 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.650
 still little help in professional traffic today 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:40.570
 but at least he has achieved his goal 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.910
 13 kilometers in about 30 minutes 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.470
 that you make during the day in london despite 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:48.060
 all driven only with one 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.060
 transport the bicycle
