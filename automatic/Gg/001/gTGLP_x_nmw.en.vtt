00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.380
 What do we have to offer? 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.920
 We're just a bunch of weak soldiers. 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.860
 Let's go to the battlefield using those stupid weapons 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.940
 And we tried to militarize a war that is not ours. 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.840
 We do not have the strength ... 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.400
 ... but we will not fall 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.980
 Because we still have God and each other 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.860
 When we feel weak, we are stronger. 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.660
 We can even drag but never stop moving forward. 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.560
 We'll go even if everything goes wrong. 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.820
 This is who we are, only empty souls 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.740
 Corpses that roam this hate-filled world 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.440
 Always living under the wings of faith 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.800
 So faith is all we have if we have something to offer 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.200
 We do not have the strength ... 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.120
 ... but we will not fall 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.020
 Because we still have God and each other 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.580
 When we feel weak, we are stronger. 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.220
 We can even drag but never stop moving forward. 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:57.820
 We'll go even if everything goes wrong. 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:08.460
 I believe things will improve one day. 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:16.300
 So I will lie down and rest in peace. 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:27.760
 Waiting for the sun's brightness to appear 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:37.340
 Casting out my affliction and fear 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.800
 Because we still have God and each other 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.420
 When we feel weak, we are stronger. 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.340
 We can even drag but never stop moving forward. 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:44.020
 We will go forward even though everything ... 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:04:03.580
 WE STILL HAVE GOD AND OTHERS
