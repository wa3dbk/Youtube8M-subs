here and see the wires are disconnected
from<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.350> switch<00:00:43.789> so<00:00:45.800> not<00:00:46.800> sure<00:00:47.070> what<00:00:47.280> the

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
from the switch so not sure what the

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.950 
from the switch so not sure what the
story<00:00:47.670> is<00:00:47.760> that's<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.719> way<00:00:48.870> we're<00:00:49.079> selling<00:00:49.469> it

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
story is that's the way we're selling it

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.170 
story is that's the way we're selling it
it<00:00:51.960> will<00:00:52.320> open<00:00:52.590> manually<00:00:53.370> with<00:00:53.610> a<00:00:53.640> pump<00:00:54.000> I

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
it will open manually with a pump I

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.880 
it will open manually with a pump I
would<00:00:54.300> imagine<00:00:54.600> I<00:00:54.930> wasn't<00:00:55.260> able<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:55.469> try<00:00:55.710> it

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
would imagine I wasn't able to try it

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.430 
would imagine I wasn't able to try it
but<00:00:56.789> I<00:00:56.820> would<00:00:57.270> imagine<00:00:57.360> it<00:00:57.750> will<00:00:57.930> open<00:00:58.079> like

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
alright this maybe hook the wires up and

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.050 
alright this maybe hook the wires up and
it<00:01:04.350> works<00:01:04.530> fine<00:01:04.830> that<00:01:05.129> yeah<00:01:05.309> I'm<00:01:05.489> not<00:01:05.729> exactly

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060

clean

00:01:57.849 --> 00:01:57.859 

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:00.349 

now<00:01:58.859> it<00:01:59.039> looks<00:01:59.219> at<00:01:59.399> some<00:01:59.609> point<00:01:59.939> that<00:02:00.149> there

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:00.359 
now it looks at some point that there

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:06.139 
now it looks at some point that there
was<00:02:01.609> maybe<00:02:02.609> a<00:02:02.789> water<00:02:03.060> leak<00:02:03.270> there<00:02:04.820> or<00:02:05.820> maybe

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
was maybe a water leak there or maybe

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.809 
was maybe a water leak there or maybe
here<00:02:06.539> in<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:07.049> roof

00:02:07.809 --> 00:02:07.819 
here in the roof

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:13.369 
here in the roof
it<00:02:08.819> really<00:02:09.179> rained<00:02:09.750> a<00:02:09.959> lot<00:02:10.019> two<00:02:10.860> days<00:02:11.069> ago<00:02:12.379> here

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
it really rained a lot two days ago here

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:16.070 
it really rained a lot two days ago here
filled<00:02:14.280> up<00:02:14.400> a<00:02:14.519> 5-gallon<00:02:15.090> bucket<00:02:15.360> in<00:02:15.450> my<00:02:15.569> house

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
filled up a 5-gallon bucket in my house

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.150 
filled up a 5-gallon bucket in my house
this<00:02:17.040> is<00:02:17.250> all<00:02:17.430> dry<00:02:18.080> there's<00:02:19.080> nothing<00:02:19.500> wet<00:02:19.950> in

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
this is all dry there's nothing wet in

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.059 
this is all dry there's nothing wet in
here<00:02:20.340> right<00:02:20.549> now<00:02:20.989> but<00:02:21.989> at<00:02:22.260> some<00:02:22.530> point<00:02:22.830> there

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
here right now but at some point there

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:24.650 
here right now but at some point there
probably<00:02:23.430> was<00:02:23.610> a<00:02:23.640> leak<00:02:23.940> like<00:02:24.180> there<00:02:24.390> is<00:02:24.510> with

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
probably was a leak like there is with

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.530 
probably was a leak like there is with
most<00:02:24.930> trailers<00:02:25.230> and<00:02:25.790> I'm<00:02:26.790> gonna<00:02:26.940> imagine<00:02:27.180> that

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
most trailers and I'm gonna imagine that

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.490 
most trailers and I'm gonna imagine that
it<00:02:27.660> was<00:02:27.750> sealed<00:02:27.959> up<00:02:28.819> so<00:02:30.019> that<00:02:31.019> is<00:02:31.230> the<00:02:31.349> way

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
it was sealed up so that is the way

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.550 
it was sealed up so that is the way
we're<00:02:31.709> selling<00:02:32.130> it<00:02:32.450> as<00:02:33.450> far<00:02:33.750> as<00:02:33.780> the<00:02:33.989> room<00:02:34.230> I'm

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560
