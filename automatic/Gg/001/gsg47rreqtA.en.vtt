myself<00:01:39.119> hitting<00:01:39.660> the<00:01:39.780> wall<00:01:40.610> and<00:01:41.610> that<00:01:41.789> would

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:41.910 
myself hitting the wall and that would

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:57.240 
myself hitting the wall and that would
be<00:01:42.000> certain<00:01:42.300> death

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:00.829 
it's all really difficult to do but at

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:04.420 
it's all really difficult to do but at
least<00:02:00.950> in<00:02:01.189> my<00:02:01.369> mind<00:02:01.670> this<00:02:02.659> allows<00:02:03.020> me<00:02:03.409> to<00:02:03.439> try

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
least in my mind this allows me to try

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.179 
least in my mind this allows me to try
things<00:02:04.850> that<00:02:05.149> I<00:02:05.720> would<00:02:06.200> never<00:02:06.439> try<00:02:06.799> to<00:02:06.830> free

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:07.189 
things that I would never try to free

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:09.520
