00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:16.250 

well<00:00:11.910> I<00:00:11.940> prefer<00:00:12.450> my<00:00:13.490> answer<00:00:14.490> so<00:00:14.759> my<00:00:15.599> trucks<00:00:15.839> are

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
well I prefer my answer so my trucks are

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.410 
well I prefer my answer so my trucks are
just<00:00:16.590> like<00:00:16.800> this<00:00:17.039> they're<00:00:17.340> not<00:00:17.550> practically

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
just like this they're not practically

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.090 
just like this they're not practically
falling<00:00:18.779> off<00:00:19.050> and<00:00:19.230> they're<00:00:19.380> not<00:00:19.470> stiff<00:00:19.800> tight

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
falling off and they're not stiff tight

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.070 
falling off and they're not stiff tight
Sam<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:21.180> back<00:00:21.330> ones<00:00:21.539> are<00:00:21.660> a<00:00:21.720> little<00:00:21.869> bit

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
Sam the back ones are a little bit

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.349 
Sam the back ones are a little bit
tighter<00:00:22.350> so<00:00:23.039> it's<00:00:23.189> easier<00:00:23.490> to<00:00:23.580> kind<00:00:23.730> of<00:00:23.880> manual

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
tighter so it's easier to kind of manual

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.990 
tighter so it's easier to kind of manual
so<00:00:24.660> there<00:00:24.810> doesn't<00:00:25.199> bend<00:00:25.560> off<00:00:25.740> like<00:00:25.920> that<00:00:26.130> well

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
so there doesn't bend off like that well

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.089 
so there doesn't bend off like that well
I<00:00:27.029> prefer<00:00:27.240> my<00:00:27.570> trucks<00:00:27.869> a<00:00:27.990> lot<00:00:28.140> looser<00:00:28.740> so<00:00:29.039> you

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
I prefer my trucks a lot looser so you

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.800 
I prefer my trucks a lot looser so you
can<00:00:29.279> turn<00:00:29.519> a<00:00:29.550> lot<00:00:29.789> sharper<00:00:30.090> because<00:00:30.660> then

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
can turn a lot sharper because then

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:31.490 
can turn a lot sharper because then
they're<00:00:30.960> tight

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
they're tight

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.280 
they're tight
maybe<00:00:32.130> you<00:00:32.460> need<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:32.640> turn<00:00:32.850> like<00:00:33.120> that<00:00:33.899> because

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
maybe you need to turn like that because

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.190 
maybe you need to turn like that because
you<00:00:34.380> can't<00:00:34.590> get<00:00:35.390> there's<00:00:36.390> not<00:00:36.540> returning<00:00:37.020> oh

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
you can't get there's not returning oh

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.000 
you can't get there's not returning oh

my<00:01:15.840> favorite<00:01:16.290> trick<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.650> do<00:01:16.830> is<00:01:17.460> a<00:01:17.520> Bert<00:01:17.909> slide

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
my favorite trick to do is a Bert slide

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.960 
my favorite trick to do is a Bert slide
and<00:01:18.600> it<00:01:19.170> isn't<00:01:19.320> too<00:01:19.560> hard<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.920> pick<00:01:20.130> up<00:01:20.310> because

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
and it isn't too hard to pick up because

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.730 
and it isn't too hard to pick up because
you're<00:01:21.090> just<00:01:21.210> riding<00:01:21.689> you<00:01:21.810> kind<00:01:22.110> of<00:01:22.200> bend<00:01:22.409> down

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
you're just riding you kind of bend down

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.380 
you're just riding you kind of bend down
so<00:01:23.640> you're<00:01:24.150> kind<00:01:24.360> of<00:01:24.479> like

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.950 

and<00:01:29.200> wobble<00:01:29.950> the<00:01:30.070> slide<00:01:30.430> on<00:01:30.760> its<00:01:30.940> own<00:01:31.120> through

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
and wobble the slide on its own through

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.600 
and wobble the slide on its own through
to<00:01:32.080> the<00:01:32.200> speed<00:01:32.500> that<00:01:32.740> you're<00:01:32.860> going<00:01:33.130> up<00:01:33.280> so

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610 
to the speed that you're going up so

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.340 
to the speed that you're going up so
it's<00:01:33.909> better<00:01:34.090> if<00:01:34.240> you're<00:01:34.330> going<00:01:34.450> faster<00:01:35.020> we're

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
it's better if you're going faster we're

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.590 
it's better if you're going faster we're
not<00:01:35.500> too<00:01:35.680> fast<00:01:35.940> because<00:01:36.940> you<00:01:37.090> want<00:01:37.270> to<00:01:37.360> still

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
not too fast because you want to still

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.870 
not too fast because you want to still
be<00:01:37.750> able<00:01:37.990> to<00:01:38.110> land<00:01:38.409> in<00:01:38.619> a<00:01:38.680> fast<00:01:38.920> and<00:01:39.550> then<00:01:39.729> you

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880

be able to land in a fast and then you
end<00:01:40.060> up<00:01:40.240> at<00:01:40.390> the<00:01:40.420> other<00:01:40.600> side<00:01:40.869> from<00:01:41.080> the<00:01:41.170> 180

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240

landing it goes up seen publicly and
arms<00:01:58.930> which<00:01:59.680> is<00:01:59.830> the<00:01:59.979> hardest<00:02:00.399> thing<00:02:00.580> about
