00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:23.619 
little bit smaller or even larger so

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:25.950 
little bit smaller or even larger so
that<00:01:23.649> you<00:01:24.369> don't<00:01:24.640> end<00:01:24.820> up<00:01:25.060> with<00:01:25.270> too<00:01:25.570> small<00:01:25.930> of

that you don't end up with too small of
a<00:01:26.170> twist<00:01:26.469> but<00:01:26.799> you<00:01:26.920> don't<00:01:27.039> want<00:01:27.250> them<00:01:27.369> to<00:01:27.520> be

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640

a twist but you don't want them to be
too<00:01:27.820> large<00:01:28.000> either

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:54.669 

and<00:01:50.649> we're<00:01:51.649> gone<00:01:51.890> I<00:01:52.579> probably<00:01:52.939> have<00:01:53.390> about<00:01:53.679> 12

00:01:54.669 --> 00:01:54.679 
and we're gone I probably have about 12

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:57.370 
and we're gone I probably have about 12
twists<00:01:55.399> not<00:01:56.119> sure<00:01:56.270> exactly<00:01:56.719> but<00:01:56.810> you<00:01:57.020> can<00:01:57.229> see

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
twists not sure exactly but you can see

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.289 
twists not sure exactly but you can see
they're<00:01:57.530> really<00:01:57.770> not<00:01:57.890> that<00:01:58.100> little<00:01:58.340> nor<00:01:59.270> are

00:01:59.289 --> 00:01:59.299 
they're really not that little nor are

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:01.690 
they're really not that little nor are
they<00:01:59.630> very<00:01:59.899> very<00:02:00.319> large<00:02:00.619> so<00:02:01.159> now<00:02:01.280> we<00:02:01.340> want<00:02:01.459> to

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
they very very large so now we want to

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.999 
they very very large so now we want to
grab<00:02:01.909> our<00:02:02.119> flexi<00:02:02.630> rod<00:02:02.840> and<00:02:03.200> we're<00:02:03.679> going<00:02:03.979> to

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:04.009 
grab our flexi rod and we're going to

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:07.090 
grab our flexi rod and we're going to
take<00:02:04.340> the<00:02:04.549> end<00:02:04.759> and<00:02:05.179> bend<00:02:05.630> it<00:02:05.840> around<00:02:06.100> upward

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
take the end and bend it around upward

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.180 
take the end and bend it around upward
so<00:02:07.700> that<00:02:07.729> when<00:02:08.060> we<00:02:08.090> twist<00:02:08.690> will<00:02:09.530> be<00:02:09.709> able<00:02:09.920> to

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
so that when we twist will be able to

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.270 
so that when we twist will be able to
secure<00:02:10.729> the<00:02:10.970> ends<00:02:11.150> of<00:02:11.540> the<00:02:11.720> hair<00:02:11.750> with<00:02:12.739> our<00:02:13.040> two

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.970 
secure the ends of the hair with our two
strand<00:02:13.610> twists<00:02:14.060> and<00:02:14.150> then<00:02:14.510> bend<00:02:15.470> the<00:02:15.590> ends<00:02:15.799> of

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
strand twists and then bend the ends of

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.979 
strand twists and then bend the ends of
your<00:02:16.010> flexi<00:02:16.549> rod<00:02:16.700> to<00:02:16.970> secure<00:02:17.390> that<00:02:17.420> in<00:02:17.780> your

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
your flexi rod to secure that in your

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:21.370 
your flexi rod to secure that in your
hair<00:02:18.260> I'm<00:02:18.799> using<00:02:19.130> one<00:02:19.459> flexi<00:02:19.940> rod<00:02:20.090> /<00:02:20.480> twist<00:02:20.900> but

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
hair I'm using one flexi rod / twist but

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.890

if<00:02:21.500> you<00:02:21.620> don't<00:02:21.799> have<00:02:21.860> enough<00:02:22.700> it's<00:02:23.390> okay<00:02:23.750> if

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
if you don't have enough it's okay if

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.650 
if you don't have enough it's okay if

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:45.070 
because it's another option versus just

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:46.860

doing<00:05:45.400> a<00:05:45.460> regular<00:05:45.490> twist<00:05:46.090> out<00:05:46.300> it<00:05:46.450> has<00:05:46.600> a<00:05:46.630> lot

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:46.870 
doing a regular twist out it has a lot
