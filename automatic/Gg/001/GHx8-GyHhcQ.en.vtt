00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:34.660 
down into a contracted position if it's

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.720 
down into a contracted position if it's
still<00:00:34.899> flexible<00:00:35.260> meaning<00:00:36.100> you<00:00:36.250> can<00:00:36.460> still

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:36.730 
still flexible meaning you can still

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.930 
still flexible meaning you can still
pull<00:00:37.210> the<00:00:37.450> toe<00:00:37.660> edge<00:00:37.870> straight<00:00:38.350> a<00:00:38.940> simple

pull the toe edge straight a simple

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.819 
pull the toe edge straight a simple
procedure<00:00:40.120> is<00:00:40.660> to<00:00:40.809> come<00:00:40.989> right<00:00:41.200> here<00:00:41.500> to<00:00:41.559> the

procedure is to come right here to the

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:44.430 
procedure is to come right here to the
bottom<00:00:42.190> of<00:00:42.309> the<00:00:42.430> toe<00:00:42.610> put<00:00:43.510> a<00:00:43.539> small<00:00:43.899> injection

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
bottom of the toe put a small injection

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.770 
bottom of the toe put a small injection
of<00:00:44.559> novocaine<00:00:45.070> like<00:00:45.340> the<00:00:45.460> dentists<00:00:45.760> uses<00:00:46.180> this

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780 
of novocaine like the dentists uses this

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.410 
of novocaine like the dentists uses this
simply<00:00:47.110> taught<00:00:47.410> that<00:00:47.650> tendon<00:00:48.100> now<00:00:48.910> when<00:00:49.090> we<00:00:49.210> do

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420 
simply taught that tendon now when we do

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.180 
simply taught that tendon now when we do
that<00:00:49.690> we<00:00:49.840> put<00:00:50.020> a<00:00:50.050> little<00:00:50.290> dressing<00:00:50.739> on<00:00:50.890> it

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 
that we put a little dressing on it

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.069 
that we put a little dressing on it
and<00:00:51.610> it<00:00:51.700> heals<00:00:51.910> up<00:00:52.120> just<00:00:52.329> like<00:00:52.450> any<00:00:52.630> other<00:00:52.780> cut

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:53.079 
and it heals up just like any other cut

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:55.500 
and it heals up just like any other cut
goat<00:00:53.320> when<00:00:54.250> you<00:00:54.340> walk<00:00:54.520> in<00:00:54.790> and<00:00:54.970> you<00:00:55.090> walk<00:00:55.270> out

and<00:01:02.950> this<00:01:03.280> is<00:01:03.430> a<00:01:03.460> pretty<00:01:03.790> simple<00:01:04.150> hammertoe

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:04.900 
and this is a pretty simple hammertoe

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.920 
and this is a pretty simple hammertoe

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:12.159 
pull straight we know that we can

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:14.370 
pull straight we know that we can
straighten<00:01:12.550> by<00:01:13.060> cutting<00:01:13.479> the<00:01:13.600> tendon<00:01:14.050> that<00:01:14.080> is

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
straighten by cutting the tendon that is

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.680 
straighten by cutting the tendon that is
deforming<00:01:15.010> the<00:01:15.070> toe<00:01:15.369> in<00:01:15.610> this<00:01:15.760> case<00:01:16.060> the

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:16.690 
deforming the toe in this case the

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:18.980 
deforming the toe in this case the
flexor<00:01:17.170> tendon<00:01:17.530> is<00:01:17.650> our<00:01:17.770> deforming<00:01:18.310> force

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
flexor tendon is our deforming force

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.570 
flexor tendon is our deforming force
we're<00:01:19.990> gonna<00:01:20.110> numb<00:01:20.409> the<00:01:20.619> skin<00:01:20.770> up<00:01:21.070> with<00:01:21.310> cold

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:21.580 
we're gonna numb the skin up with cold

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.370 
we're gonna numb the skin up with cold
spray<00:01:21.970> so<00:01:22.240> that<00:01:22.270> the<00:01:22.420> needle<00:01:22.840> doesn't<00:01:23.050> hurt

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
spray so that the needle doesn't hurt

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.730 
spray so that the needle doesn't hurt
and<00:01:24.009> now<00:01:24.159> we're<00:01:24.369> ready<00:01:24.520> to<00:01:24.700> inject<00:01:25.619> what<00:01:26.619> the

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
and now we're ready to inject what the

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.730 
and now we're ready to inject what the
patient<00:01:27.190> will<00:01:27.280> feel<00:01:27.310> is<00:01:27.700> a<00:01:27.729> stick<00:01:28.300> you<00:01:28.740> can

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
patient will feel is a stick you can

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.200 
patient will feel is a stick you can
burn<00:01:30.340> as<00:01:31.050> the<00:01:32.050> medication<00:01:32.649> goes<00:01:32.890> in<00:01:33.159> okay<00:01:34.090> now

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
burn as the medication goes in okay now

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.300 
burn as the medication goes in okay now
this<00:01:34.420> toe<00:01:34.750> is<00:01:34.960> nice<00:01:35.170> and<00:01:35.470> numb<00:01:35.680> what<00:01:36.160> we're

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
this toe is nice and numb what we're

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:37.740 
this toe is nice and numb what we're
going<00:01:36.460> to<00:01:36.520> do<00:01:36.700> here<00:01:37.060> is<00:01:37.240> make<00:01:37.420> a<00:01:37.479> small

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
going to do here is make a small

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.930 
going to do here is make a small
incision<00:01:38.320> in<00:01:38.649> this<00:01:38.800> planner<00:01:39.100> sulcus<00:01:39.729> and

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:39.940 
incision in this planner sulcus and

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.850 
incision in this planner sulcus and
through<00:01:40.630> that<00:01:40.780> incision<00:01:40.929> we're<00:01:41.440> going<00:01:41.649> to

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
through that incision we're going to

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.880 
through that incision we're going to
tenotomy<00:01:42.399> our<00:01:42.940> cut<00:01:43.240> the<00:01:43.509> flexor<00:01:43.929> tendon<00:01:44.380> which

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
tenotomy our cut the flexor tendon which

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.330 
tenotomy our cut the flexor tendon which
is<00:01:45.039> pulling<00:01:45.310> the<00:01:45.520> toe<00:01:45.729> in<00:01:46.000> a<00:01:46.090> curl<00:01:46.390> position

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
is pulling the toe in a curl position

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:54.990 
is pulling the toe in a curl position
it's<00:01:48.340> a<00:01:48.490> simple<00:01:48.910> incision<00:01:51.330> and<00:01:52.740> that's<00:01:53.740> it<00:01:54.009> the

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
it's a simple incision and that's it the

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.540 
it's a simple incision and that's it the
procedure<00:01:55.360> is<00:01:55.600> over<00:01:55.780> now<00:01:56.619> Linda<00:01:56.979> if<00:01:57.160> you<00:01:57.340> could

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:57.550 
procedure is over now Linda if you could

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.010 
procedure is over now Linda if you could
show<00:01:57.759> us<00:01:57.970> the<00:01:58.000> difference<00:01:58.509> between<00:01:58.869> this

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
show us the difference between this

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.499 
show us the difference between this
curly<00:01:59.470> toe<00:01:59.649> over<00:01:59.830> here<00:02:00.220> which<00:02:00.970> we<00:02:01.149> have<00:02:01.300> not

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
curly toe over here which we have not

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:04.590 
curly toe over here which we have not
yet<00:02:01.869> fixed<00:02:02.470> and<00:02:03.009> this<00:02:03.610> nice<00:02:03.880> and<00:02:03.909> straight<00:02:04.390> toe

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
yet fixed and this nice and straight toe

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.800 
yet fixed and this nice and straight toe
over<00:02:04.780> here

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.990 

so<00:02:10.810> this<00:02:11.020> is<00:02:11.170> our<00:02:11.319> post-op<00:02:11.800> foot<00:02:12.069> you<00:02:12.670> can<00:02:12.849> see
