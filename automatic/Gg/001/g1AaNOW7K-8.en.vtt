00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.159 
thumb sticks it's I guess this the you
know<00:04:09.280> leftovers<00:04:10.180> from<00:04:10.359> my<00:04:10.449> control<00:04:10.690> freak<00:04:11.019> cos

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:11.169 
know leftovers from my control freak cos

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:12.210 
know leftovers from my control freak cos
they're<00:04:11.290> black<00:04:11.500> and<00:04:11.530> I<00:04:11.739> guess<00:04:11.859> it<00:04:11.949> was<00:04:12.040> on<00:04:12.099> it

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
they're black and I guess it was on it

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:13.530 
they're black and I guess it was on it
for<00:04:12.340> too<00:04:12.430> long<00:04:12.549> so<00:04:12.879> you<00:04:13.239> know<00:04:13.449> the

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
for too long so you know the

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:14.849 
for too long so you know the
controller's<00:04:13.840> cups<00:04:14.019> would<00:04:14.109> be<00:04:14.199> fine<00:04:14.440> and<00:04:14.620> um

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:14.859 
controller's cups would be fine and um

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:17.039 
controller's cups would be fine and um
maybe<00:04:15.370> the<00:04:15.669> person<00:04:15.940> I<00:04:16.000> give<00:04:16.299> this<00:04:16.479> controller

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
maybe the person I give this controller

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:19.890 
maybe the person I give this controller
way<00:04:17.169> to<00:04:17.229> you<00:04:18.039> know<00:04:18.130> they<00:04:18.280> get<00:04:18.609> it<00:04:18.729> and<00:04:18.849> it's<00:04:19.150> you

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
way to you know they get it and it's you

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.180 
way to you know they get it and it's you
