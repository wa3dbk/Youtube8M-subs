00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.669
 you can favor a little forest not 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.230
 because we have seen that it goes very fast with 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.580
 this bike over there and it fits well and good 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.519
 he will come in handy to have two sleeves has 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.620
 said this and I'm happy sergio and javi 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.030
 I'm happy to see marching and not afores 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.559
 because I tell you we had had 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.809
 benefit in August did not have a motorcycle 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.940
 I was looking for the poor one a little 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.230
 endorsement so he could be put back 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.119
 started the team and in the end it has been 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.680
 an incredible economic effort for its 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.869
 part and by two or three friends includes 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.140
 also michelin what they do today 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.820
 be there and be so strong too 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.140
 It is tremendously strong reason 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.279
 in the heads of your rivals that we have 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.200
 spoken with them you know them well 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.880
 there is also that man who comes with the 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.860
 ducati number 12 on the right those 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.170
 lcd screens to the commissar the traffic light 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.780
 red about to start the first 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.850
 day load here in albacete el cb 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.950
 direct let's see how they come out 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.600
 jumping less and almost to all comfort is 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.219
 a product with problems to place 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.079
 let's see how they get to that first 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.020
 braking right that curve of 2a 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:58.109
 carmelo very well if everything is put first 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:59.550
 I first only for privileges and before a 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.410
 Carmelo position has gained the pulse there 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.850
 to xavi and silva third it seems that the 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.460
 three protagonists are where they should 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.850
 room alarcos 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:10.070
 gone barragán I think he's watering it 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.659
 look look how it closes look how it looks 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.310
 close to Carmelo that at least told us 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:14.630
 in the warm-up that can not be that 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.010
 go to xavi in the first laps 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.890
 because what happened the last race and 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:21.890
 there was no way of health at least he knows 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.570
 and can not at least put it first 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.790
 try to cover how he did rossi in 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.380
 dry lagoon with the ducati stoner no 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.180
 tried to embitter the race and what 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.979
 got you believe that here and that same 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.330
 what he said was in law is what I gave him 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:34.790
 get me out of law or carmen you need to do 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:37.550
 what Rossi did with this in lagoon 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.619
 dry neutralize by is because of all 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.300
 the forest grill is the pilot who more 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:43.910
 knows how to ride with cold tires 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.500
 have a capacity look there 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:48.080
 when he entered he said he has gotten in but a 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.580
 kart but pretty nice that a lot 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.200
 meat does not know that it has to stop him and 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.030
 Forés look outside, keep the 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.800
 position that or brave is that it is very 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:58.610
 brave carmel with everything taught his 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:00.080
 letters saying you will not have it look 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.970
 that comes serve also tries to get 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.710
 How beautiful the braking before the curve 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.840
 so fast before the girl let's see 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.390
 how come carmelo more covering all 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.769
 it is totally I believe that Xavi is also 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.090
 note that they will tell you a little 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:13.430
 patience because having the pace that 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.260
 has and the one who has done knows he has 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.519
 where the fifth that has gotten into 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.110
 the dirty area not well almost hollow 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:21.879
 surely the carmelo how beautiful 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.879
 good good good here they touch 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:28.349
 this is not very good 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.680
 first first round 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:40.799
 Carmelo not to leave 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:48.489
 I always say that the barrier of what 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.500
 legal and legal in the motorcycle world 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:52.060
 here we see Ivan deprived of class 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.750
 forest 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:03:00.819
 carmelo is third now not only is not 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:02.079
 the one who is third is not third something 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:04.750
 we have lost but surely you have 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:06.640
 there was a good fight between them and for 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.500
 forest end is put first and now 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.079
 you sure are trying to pull hard 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.940
 because he knows that it is not good for him 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:15.400
 all these messes that we are seeing and 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.440
 that he has a rhythm to catch a little 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.299
 give away here we see the touch by 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.099
 here very repeated that image is between the 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:22.390
 half in which forest got angry 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:23.859
 little with carmelo although good at 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.019
 final are known from long ago 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:27.520
 either or not between them they know where 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:29.440
 are the limits I believe 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.820
 good chaves was thinking uncle you know 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.490
 that has been superior you know that I have 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.690
 been strong no no I do not think there's 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:36.160
 enter this war not the things that 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.740
 obviously carmelo inside you 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:42.390
 yes but javier forés is a pilot is 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:42.390
 super professional and he knows
