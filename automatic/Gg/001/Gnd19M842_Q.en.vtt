00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
went through and checked you know

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.420 
went through and checked you know
several<00:02:32.210> Corrections<00:02:32.810> with<00:02:33.740> the<00:02:33.830> Beast<00:02:34.040> X<00:02:34.250> and

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
several Corrections with the Beast X and

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:35.860 
several Corrections with the Beast X and
that's<00:02:34.580> fairly<00:02:34.820> straightforward

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
that's fairly straightforward

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.440 
that's fairly straightforward
the<00:02:36.290> only<00:02:36.440> thing<00:02:36.620> I<00:02:36.709> would<00:02:36.770> recommend<00:02:37.040> is<00:02:37.550> make

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
the only thing I would recommend is make

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.260 
the only thing I would recommend is make
sure<00:02:38.690> you<00:02:38.990> check<00:02:39.430> your<00:02:40.430> servo<00:02:40.850> wires<00:02:41.060> right

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
sure you check your servo wires right

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.630 
sure you check your servo wires right
here<00:02:41.330> as<00:02:41.630> you<00:02:41.930> can<00:02:41.959> see<00:02:42.340> make<00:02:43.340> sure<00:02:43.370> they're

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
here as you can see make sure they're

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.690 
here as you can see make sure they're
not<00:02:43.790> touching<00:02:44.950> the<00:02:45.950> drive<00:02:46.190> right<00:02:46.400> here<00:02:46.550> the

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
not touching the drive right here the

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.940 
not touching the drive right here the
belt<00:02:46.880> drive<00:02:46.970> mine<00:02:47.870> is<00:02:48.080> not<00:02:48.230> and<00:02:48.560> you<00:02:48.620> can<00:02:48.770> see

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
belt drive mine is not and you can see

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.100 
belt drive mine is not and you can see
it's<00:02:49.340> perfectly<00:02:50.030> clear<00:02:50.600> right<00:02:50.780> there<00:02:50.930> but

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
it's perfectly clear right there but

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.140 
it's perfectly clear right there but
just<00:02:51.290> want<00:02:51.560> to<00:02:51.680> point<00:02:51.830> that<00:02:51.950> out<00:02:52.070> so<00:02:52.880> it<00:02:52.910> goes

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
just want to point that out so it goes

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.010 
just want to point that out so it goes
underneath<00:02:53.450> and<00:02:54.170> it<00:02:54.650> is<00:02:54.800> a<00:02:55.459> tie<00:02:56.360> strap<00:02:56.750> in<00:02:56.959> the

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
underneath and it is a tie strap in the

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:58.810 
underneath and it is a tie strap in the
back<00:02:57.200> right<00:02:57.410> here<00:02:57.620> so<00:02:57.770> it<00:02:57.860> keeps<00:02:58.040> tension<00:02:58.610> so

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
back right here so it keeps tension so

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.160 
back right here so it keeps tension so
it<00:02:58.850> should<00:02:59.209> be<00:02:59.239> fine<00:02:59.600> and<00:02:59.780> it<00:02:59.900> should<00:03:00.050> never

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
it should be fine and it should never

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.710 
it should be fine and it should never
touch<00:03:00.470> that<00:03:00.739> gear<00:03:00.980> but<00:03:01.340> just<00:03:01.880> kind<00:03:02.360> of<00:03:02.420> a<00:03:02.510> heads

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
touch that gear but just kind of a heads

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.410 
touch that gear but just kind of a heads
up<00:03:02.840> and<00:03:03.790> another<00:03:04.790> I<00:03:05.950> noticed<00:03:06.950> was<00:03:07.239> where<00:03:08.239> the

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
up and another I noticed was where the

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.500 
up and another I noticed was where the
motor<00:03:08.660> wires<00:03:08.930> exit<00:03:09.470> the<00:03:09.560> frame<00:03:10.390> it<00:03:11.390> was

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
motor wires exit the frame it was

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.600 
motor wires exit the frame it was
relatively<00:03:11.900> close<00:03:12.290> to<00:03:12.470> the<00:03:12.530> frame<00:03:12.800> so<00:03:13.040> I<00:03:13.070> added

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
relatively close to the frame so I added

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.390 
relatively close to the frame so I added
you<00:03:13.760> know<00:03:13.940> just<00:03:14.180> a<00:03:14.920> double-faced<00:03:15.920> tape<00:03:16.040> right

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
you know just a double-faced tape right

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.090 
you know just a double-faced tape right
here<00:03:16.459> cover<00:03:17.000> up<00:03:17.150> the<00:03:17.269> edge<00:03:17.390> I<00:03:18.110> figured

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
here cover up the edge I figured

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.759 
here cover up the edge I figured
eventually<00:03:19.450> maybe<00:03:20.450> after<00:03:21.170> a<00:03:21.200> you<00:03:21.650> know<00:03:21.739> a

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769 
eventually maybe after a you know a

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:23.590 
eventually maybe after a you know a
couple<00:03:21.950> of<00:03:22.100> hundred<00:03:22.220> or<00:03:22.580> a<00:03:22.760> thousand<00:03:23.330> flights

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
couple of hundred or a thousand flights

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.690 
couple of hundred or a thousand flights
this<00:03:23.989> wires<00:03:24.320> will<00:03:24.620> eventually<00:03:25.190> keep<00:03:25.370> touching

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
this wires will eventually keep touching

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.420 
this wires will eventually keep touching
that<00:03:26.000> that<00:03:26.780> free<00:03:27.440> image<00:03:27.650> and<00:03:27.860> it<00:03:27.950> might<00:03:28.130> wear

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
that that free image and it might wear

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.530 
that that free image and it might wear
the<00:03:28.750> insulation<00:03:29.750> so<00:03:30.070> I<00:03:31.070> did<00:03:31.370> the<00:03:31.489> easy<00:03:31.700> lazy

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
the insulation so I did the easy lazy

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.020 
the insulation so I did the easy lazy
fix<00:03:32.930> by<00:03:33.170> just<00:03:33.410> you<00:03:33.650> know<00:03:33.680> folding<00:03:34.220> a<00:03:34.400> piece<00:03:34.790> of

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
fix by just you know folding a piece of

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.280 
fix by just you know folding a piece of
double<00:03:35.510> double<00:03:36.410> faced<00:03:36.590> tape<00:03:36.830> right<00:03:37.070> there

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
double double faced tape right there

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.530 
double double faced tape right there
just<00:03:39.290> keep<00:03:39.470> those<00:03:39.709> wires<00:03:40.239> from<00:03:41.239> getting

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
just keep those wires from getting

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.449 
just keep those wires from getting
scratched<00:03:41.810> up<00:03:42.019> there's<00:03:42.650> many<00:03:42.860> ways<00:03:42.950> to<00:03:43.100> fix

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
scratched up there's many ways to fix

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:47.650 
scratched up there's many ways to fix
that<00:03:43.610> you<00:03:43.880> can<00:03:45.640> sand<00:03:46.640> the<00:03:46.790> edges<00:03:46.940> make<00:03:47.510> the

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
that you can sand the edges make the

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.810 
that you can sand the edges make the
carbon<00:03:48.019> nice<00:03:48.200> and<00:03:48.440> smooth<00:03:48.650> it<00:03:49.489> is<00:03:49.580> fairly

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:49.820 
carbon nice and smooth it is fairly

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.390 
carbon nice and smooth it is fairly
smooth<00:03:50.209> from<00:03:51.019> the<00:03:51.140> factory<00:03:51.470> but<00:03:51.620> you<00:03:52.310> know

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
smooth from the factory but you know

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.630 
smooth from the factory but you know
what<00:03:52.549> that's<00:03:53.420> just<00:03:53.810> a<00:03:53.900> simple<00:03:54.230> easy<00:03:55.130> thing<00:03:55.519> to

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
what that's just a simple easy thing to

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.360 
what that's just a simple easy thing to
put<00:03:56.200> just<00:03:57.200> to<00:03:57.350> make<00:03:57.470> sure<00:03:57.620> that<00:03:57.980> doesn't<00:03:58.280> get

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
put just to make sure that doesn't get

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:05.530 
put just to make sure that doesn't get
all<00:03:58.459> chopped<00:03:58.850> up<00:04:00.459> okay<00:04:02.200> so<00:04:04.269> today<00:04:05.269> I'm

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
all chopped up okay so today I'm

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.710 
all chopped up okay so today I'm
actually<00:04:06.250> there's<00:04:07.250> no<00:04:07.430> open<00:04:08.000> field<00:04:08.269> so<00:04:08.420> I<00:04:08.480> can

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
actually there's no open field so I can

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.560 
actually there's no open field so I can
you<00:04:09.709> know<00:04:09.769> take<00:04:09.920> a<00:04:09.980> good<00:04:10.430> flight<00:04:10.700> video<00:04:10.880> so

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:11.570 
you know take a good flight video so

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:13.780 
you know take a good flight video so
I'll<00:04:11.660> do<00:04:11.870> that<00:04:12.019> in<00:04:12.230> the<00:04:12.260> next<00:04:12.470> coming<00:04:12.709> days<00:04:12.799> but

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.150 
you guys ordered yours because I mean
with<00:04:36.420> only<00:04:36.690> a<00:04:36.870> few<00:04:37.050> flights<00:04:37.350> on<00:04:37.530> mine<00:04:37.710> in<00:04:38.040> the

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
with only a few flights on mine in the

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.010 
with only a few flights on mine in the
front<00:04:38.340> of<00:04:38.400> my<00:04:38.430> house<00:04:38.640> I<00:04:38.880> am<00:04:39.180> really<00:04:39.540> loving

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
front of my house I am really loving

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.940 
front of my house I am really loving
this<00:04:40.140> helicopter

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:40.950 
this helicopter

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:43.790 
this helicopter
it<00:04:41.040> flies<00:04:41.700> phenomenal<00:04:42.510> and<00:04:42.840> I<00:04:43.140> think<00:04:43.410> a<00:04:43.560> lot<00:04:43.770> of

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
it flies phenomenal and I think a lot of

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.810 
it flies phenomenal and I think a lot of
it<00:04:44.010> is<00:04:44.210> attributed<00:04:45.210> to<00:04:46.430> optimize<00:04:47.430> servo

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820 
it is attributed to optimize servo

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:51.110 
it is attributed to optimize servo
geometry<00:04:48.590> so<00:04:49.590> until<00:04:50.490> next<00:04:50.610> time<00:04:50.760> when<00:04:51.000> I<00:04:51.030> get

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
geometry so until next time when I get

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.620 
geometry so until next time when I get
the<00:04:51.330> videos<00:04:51.600> together<00:04:51.750> I'll<00:04:52.140> see<00:04:52.410> you<00:04:52.470> then
