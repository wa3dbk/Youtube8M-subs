what<00:03:21.010> I<00:03:21.040> think<00:03:21.160> you<00:03:21.340> could<00:03:21.519> do<00:03:21.670> with<00:03:21.820> this

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
what I think you could do with this

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.120 
what I think you could do with this
since<00:03:22.299> it's<00:03:22.420> got<00:03:22.570> this<00:03:22.660> little<00:03:22.900> box

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
since it's got this little box

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.039 
since it's got this little box
underneath<00:03:24.130> you<00:03:24.850> can<00:03:25.030> probably<00:03:25.510> store<00:03:25.840> when

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:26.049 
underneath you can probably store when

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:27.870 
underneath you can probably store when
your<00:03:26.140> character<00:03:26.320> buys<00:03:26.680> to<00:03:26.920> a<00:03:27.040> special<00:03:27.610> weapon

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
your character buys to a special weapon

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:28.770 
your character buys to a special weapon
or<00:03:27.970> something<00:03:28.180> you<00:03:28.239> could<00:03:28.360> store<00:03:28.570> them

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
or something you could store them

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:34.560 
or something you could store them
underneath<00:03:29.100> very<00:03:30.100> cool<00:03:32.340> put<00:03:33.340> these<00:03:33.549> away<00:03:33.730> and

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.570 
underneath very cool put these away and

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:36.030 
underneath very cool put these away and
of<00:03:34.840> course<00:03:35.079> I<00:03:35.200> get<00:03:35.350> anything<00:03:35.500> with<00:03:35.620> Lego<00:03:35.829> it's

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
of course I get anything with Lego it's

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.759 
of course I get anything with Lego it's
got<00:03:36.160> a<00:03:36.190> nice<00:03:36.430> set<00:03:36.640> of<00:03:36.730> instructions<00:03:37.769> so

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
got a nice set of instructions so

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:41.610 
got a nice set of instructions so
there's<00:03:38.980> our<00:03:39.100> case<00:03:39.459> that's<00:03:39.820> kind<00:03:40.120> of<00:03:40.209> all<00:03:40.620> this

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
there's our case that's kind of all this

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:42.960 
there's our case that's kind of all this
is<00:03:41.739> kind<00:03:41.890> of<00:03:41.920> the<00:03:42.010> main<00:03:42.160> event<00:03:42.430> of<00:03:42.519> the<00:03:42.579> product

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
is kind of the main event of the product

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:44.430 
is kind of the main event of the product
but<00:03:43.060> actually<00:03:43.480> I<00:03:43.510> think<00:03:43.630> this<00:03:43.900> plane<00:03:44.170> mount<00:03:44.380> is

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
but actually I think this plane mount is

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:45.380 
but actually I think this plane mount is
going<00:03:44.560> to<00:03:44.620> be<00:03:44.709> the<00:03:44.799> main<00:03:44.980> event

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
going to be the main event

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:46.910 
going to be the main event
for<00:03:45.510> me<00:03:45.690> this<00:03:46.230> is<00:03:46.290> probably<00:03:46.440> the<00:03:46.650> thing<00:03:46.770> I<00:03:46.830> was

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
for me this is probably the thing I was

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.680 
for me this is probably the thing I was
the<00:03:47.040> most<00:03:47.220> excited<00:03:47.400> about<00:03:47.850> because<00:03:48.150> you<00:03:48.660> know

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
the most excited about because you know

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.000 
the most excited about because you know
you<00:03:48.810> want<00:03:49.080> something<00:03:49.260> to<00:03:49.380> be<00:03:49.470> able<00:03:49.560> to<00:03:49.709> lay<00:03:49.890> out

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
you want something to be able to lay out

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.620 
you want something to be able to lay out
oh<00:03:50.340> this<00:03:50.550> is<00:03:50.700> nice<00:03:50.910> so<00:03:51.060> if<00:03:51.150> we<00:03:51.240> look<00:03:51.390> over<00:03:51.510> here

but<00:03:58.800> it<00:03:58.950> shows<00:03:59.160> you<00:03:59.280> how<00:03:59.400> you<00:03:59.490> can<00:03:59.580> lay<00:03:59.850> out<00:04:00.000> and

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
but it shows you how you can lay out and

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:01.670 
but it shows you how you can lay out and
what<00:04:00.330> you<00:04:00.420> can<00:04:00.569> store<00:04:00.840> so<00:04:00.990> you<00:04:01.050> can<00:04:01.230> store<00:04:01.410> like

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
what you can store so you can store like

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.590 
what you can store so you can store like
six<00:04:01.980> times<00:04:02.160> these<00:04:02.459> eighteen<00:04:02.880> times<00:04:03.000> these<00:04:03.180> all

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
six times these eighteen times these all

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.449 
six times these eighteen times these all
around<00:04:03.840> and<00:04:04.260> these<00:04:04.500> are<00:04:04.680> where<00:04:04.830> the<00:04:04.860> action

the idea of being able to stretch these
board<00:04:25.380> pieces<00:04:25.590> out<00:04:27.140> first<00:04:28.140> of<00:04:28.260> all<00:04:28.410> this<00:04:28.590> is<00:04:28.740> a

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 
and so these are kind of the major

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.090 
and so these are kind of the major
locations<00:04:47.790> right<00:04:48.300> now<00:04:48.630> this<00:04:49.410> looks<00:04:49.710> great

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 
locations right now this looks great

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.070

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
though because what I think we're

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.250 
though because what I think we're
hinting<00:04:52.530> at<00:04:52.740> new<00:04:53.520> expansion<00:04:54.450> areas<00:04:54.840> because

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:55.260 
hinting at new expansion areas because

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.650 
hinting at new expansion areas because
these<00:04:56.070> four<00:04:56.460> locations<00:04:56.610> are<00:04:57.300> the<00:04:57.450> four

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:57.660 
these four locations are the four

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.040 
these four locations are the four
locations<00:04:57.840> of<00:04:58.380> the<00:04:58.470> current<00:04:58.830> boxes<00:04:59.430> for<00:04:59.700> tan

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
locations of the current boxes for tan

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.750 
locations of the current boxes for tan
and<00:05:01.050> I'm<00:05:01.200> gonna<00:05:01.380> botch<00:05:01.710> the<00:05:01.979> pronunciations<00:05:02.640> I

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:09.720 
and dry enough and so these are the four

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.930 
and dry enough and so these are the four
locations<00:05:09.900> but<00:05:10.350> over<00:05:10.590> here<00:05:10.800> it<00:05:10.919> says<00:05:11.100> baarish

these<00:05:20.250> are<00:05:20.400> apparently<00:05:21.090> new<00:05:21.360> locations<00:05:22.140> if

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 
these are apparently new locations if

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:23.630 
these are apparently new locations if
