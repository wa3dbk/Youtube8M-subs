00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:08.849
 friends and we started here the way 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.110
 as possible in the racetrack of 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.690
 tarumã 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.580
 the third-generation cerato test 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.460
 kia cerato and you know when it comes 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.680
 hyundai-kia group from a generation to 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.820
 another has a huge difference 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.010
 informal technology 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.750
 I do not know if they break more 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.260
 with technology or clothing and more 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.869
 the two are balanced in the 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.460
 sense of a break always very 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.860
 large with the previous model 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.899
 if the anterior cerate is a beautiful place of 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.660
 lines included but a car one 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:43.170
 More Executive trend a car one 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.430
 tendency I would say without any degree 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.760
 of sportiness 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:51.690
 in this new third generation although it 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:54.390
 downloaded to the 1.6 engine with 128 hp zhuo 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.600
 author of the last generation the cerato won 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.719
 much in sportsmanship and who is a police officer 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.489
 by any chance there is an owner of 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.390
 ancient cerate that will pass into the new 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.119
 cerato 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.380
 evidently it will be very strange 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:10.350
 because if this position is not here 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.340
 breaking the Taruman goal now to 140 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.900
 kilometers kilometers 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.310
 it's a much sportier car much more 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:20.040
 Radical Turn in Your Veins 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.229
 I say more firm in the bonds is a 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.640
 car has less roll - side scrolling 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.090
 of the body 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.689
 He has a reaction from the steering wheel says 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.790
 having the most accurate steering wheel in 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:34.680
 to the old cerate there is a very 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.159
 between the wheels direct 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.229
 front and driver action and in case 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.340
 here I am making an average of 120 70 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.070
 balloon schedules 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.420
 of course we have the security 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:48.240
 of this high-speed track taking 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.799
 highest constant and clear speed 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.630
 that I'm not pushing the limit of 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.090
 limit the car because we are 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.219
 with a car facing the streets 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.689
 road trip does not take the competition 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.890
 I have one hand at the sequential exchange 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.049
 six-speed 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.149
 I'm watching the tarumã track is a 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.939
 challenging track we entered 140 for 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.979
 time in Turn 1 but do not think the textiles 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.270
 I used to work here before. 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.490
 virtually 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.650
 for the first time on the track and was 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.210
 a car that already gave me a safety 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:19.260
 very large and of course I'm 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:21.360
 leaving no margin of chance and 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.680
 cigarette cards are bikes is a car 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.090
 factory people have to be careful 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.610
 even more so because this is a case of 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.650
 test drive if it repairs only notice that it 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.780
 enter with the four here 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.620
 has no tendency over or over 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.490
 to be sant 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:37.770
 what does this mean is not coming out 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.870
 excessively rear-facing 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.330
 although the tendency to get traction 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.880
 is the front exit in the 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:47.220
 but this is not what 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.860
 it's happening I'm right here in the 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:53.610
 curve 1 and another thing surprises me that 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:57.270
 new kia engine new generation engine 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:59.790
 and 128 japs ​​look much more 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:02.490
 Impress I've heard stuff from the company 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:05.040
 poorly placed than the car but it's a car 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:07.350
 luxury a 1.6 car has nothing to do 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.020
 He's a very fast car, you'll see. 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:13.020
 that he is not seeing here loss of 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.790
 torque practically at the sequential exchange rate 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:16.620
 I 'm making champion shirt 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.500
 constantly from Friday to Thursday 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.880
 because I need to resume touching a 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.060
 autorama track gives me more security 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:26.310
 in a curve that knows that we relieve a 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.770
 little at the entrance and accelerates the maximum 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.750
 within the curve in a situation of 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:34.320
 autograph not in a use situation 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:36.720
 normal absolutely good I would say so 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.709
 the guy positively surprised me here 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.270
 in taruma 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:41.790
 I do not want to break with the 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:44.250
 tires are but jefferson that I'm already 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:47.250
 You must be very angry with me. 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.959
 are expensive imported Korean tires 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.990
 This electric car comes to say I 'm going alone. 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:53.880
 We closed this is not a car not 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:56.190
 absurdly not expensive in maintenance 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:58.770
 absolutely is a car that does not like 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:01.860
 mechanical engineering here is extremely 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:04.170
 reliable and I think it made her a 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.900
 excellent engineering work with 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:09.060
 This new cerato I liked much more 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.470
 dynamic behavior by pulling the 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.780
 sportsmanship is to pick up a little more 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.930
 this new young is she 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:19.049
 beautiful design in relation to the old 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.570
 will be given so I endorse below here 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.880
 this account 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:24.040
 surprising dynamic city that this 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.610
 new kestrel showed in the 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.610
 road race track
