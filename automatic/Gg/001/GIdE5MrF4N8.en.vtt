a couple hundred gold whatever depending
on<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.519> event<00:00:26.820> so<00:00:27.420> it's<00:00:27.900> really<00:00:28.140> awesome<00:00:28.560> that

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
on the event so it's really awesome that

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.700 
on the event so it's really awesome that
he<00:00:29.369> picked<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.730> mouse<00:00:30.029> for<00:00:30.510> this<00:00:30.779> because<00:00:31.109> the

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
he picked the mouse for this because the

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.040 
he picked the mouse for this because the
mouse<00:00:31.920> is<00:00:31.949> characterized<00:00:32.820> by<00:00:33.030> just<00:00:33.420> really

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
mouse is characterized by just really

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.040 
mouse is characterized by just really
great<00:00:34.350> armor<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:35.360> terrible<00:00:36.360> everything<00:00:36.870> else

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
great armor and terrible everything else

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.569 
great armor and terrible everything else
the<00:00:37.290> firepower<00:00:37.739> is<00:00:38.070> just<00:00:38.430> abysmal<00:00:38.940> it<00:00:39.450> has<00:00:40.579> 490

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
the firepower is just abysmal it has 490

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.600 
the firepower is just abysmal it has 490
alpha<00:00:42.030> which<00:00:42.239> is<00:00:42.500> fine<00:00:43.500> I<00:00:43.950> mean<00:00:44.340> there<00:00:44.520> are

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
alpha which is fine I mean there are

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.900 
alpha which is fine I mean there are
other<00:00:44.640> heavy<00:00:45.059> tanks<00:00:45.539> in<00:00:45.719> tier<00:00:46.140> that<00:00:46.860> make<00:00:47.399> low

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
other heavy tanks in tier that make low

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.410 
other heavy tanks in tier that make low
alpha<00:00:48.379> truck<00:00:49.379> kind<00:00:49.620> of<00:00:49.770> work<00:00:50.010> like<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.420> t110e5

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
alpha truck kind of work like the t110e5

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.450 
alpha truck kind of work like the t110e5
but<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.170> problem<00:00:52.410> of<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.590> most<00:00:52.800> offensively

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
but the problem of the most offensively

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.910 
but the problem of the most offensively
is<00:00:53.730> that<00:00:54.030> it<00:00:54.329> has<00:00:54.510> such<00:00:54.780> low<00:00:55.110> damage<00:00:55.469> per

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
is that it has such low damage per

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.549 
is that it has such low damage per
minute<00:00:56.149> I'll<00:00:57.149> pretty<00:00:57.570> much<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.899> lowest<00:00:58.320> in

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
minute I'll pretty much the lowest in

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.099 
minute I'll pretty much the lowest in
tier<00:00:59.210> but<00:01:00.210> whatever<00:01:00.570> you're<00:01:00.719> not<00:01:00.870> playing

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
this tank to be an offensive juggernaut

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.980 
this tank to be an offensive juggernaut
you're<00:01:03.210> playing<00:01:03.510> this<00:01:03.809> tank<00:01:04.199> with<00:01:04.799> its<00:01:05.159> three

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
you're playing this tank with its three

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.649 
you're playing this tank with its three
thousand<00:01:06.990> HP<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:08.340> it's<00:01:08.670> stupidly<00:01:09.510> awesome

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
thousand HP and it's stupidly awesome

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.260 
thousand HP and it's stupidly awesome
armor<00:01:10.560> you're<00:01:10.770> just<00:01:10.979> going<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.310> be<00:01:11.490> a<00:01:11.700> rolling

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
armor you're just going to be a rolling

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.870 
armor you're just going to be a rolling
road<00:01:12.630> block<00:01:13.080> for<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.590> enemy<00:01:13.950> so<00:01:14.400> because<00:01:14.729> he's

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
road block for the enemy so because he's

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.120 
road block for the enemy so because he's
in<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.150> sheriff's<00:01:15.509> account<00:01:15.869> he's<00:01:16.560> going<00:01:17.070> to

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
in the sheriff's account he's going to

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.060 
in the sheriff's account he's going to
be<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.640> pretty<00:01:18.479> high<00:01:18.840> point<00:01:19.439> of<00:01:19.650> contention

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
be a pretty high point of contention

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.520 
be a pretty high point of contention
people<00:01:20.670> want<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.330> get<00:01:21.479> that<00:01:21.720> couple<00:01:22.229> hundred

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
people want to get that couple hundred

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.700 
people want to get that couple hundred
gold<00:01:23.540> so<00:01:24.540> it's<00:01:24.750> pretty<00:01:24.960> funny<00:01:25.170> watching<00:01:25.409> him

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
gold so it's pretty funny watching him

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.380 
gold so it's pretty funny watching him
taking<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.189> beating<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.670> getting<00:01:27.000> swarmed

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
taking the beating and getting swarmed

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.130 
taking the beating and getting swarmed
in<00:01:27.750> something<00:01:28.500> like<00:01:28.650> this<00:01:29.600> the<00:01:30.600> good<00:01:30.750> parts<00:01:31.020> of

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
in something like this the good parts of

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.289 
in something like this the good parts of
the<00:01:31.229> mouse<00:01:31.380> are<00:01:31.680> that<00:01:32.070> if<00:01:32.310> you<00:01:32.460> angle<00:01:32.909> it<00:01:33.000> it's

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
the mouse are that if you angle it it's

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.270 
the mouse are that if you angle it it's
very<00:01:33.570> predictable<00:01:34.290> in<00:01:34.530> what<00:01:34.799> it<00:01:34.950> will<00:01:35.100> bounce

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
very predictable in what it will bounce

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.960 
very predictable in what it will bounce
and<00:01:35.759> not<00:01:36.240> bounce<00:01:36.630> so<00:01:37.409> you<00:01:37.470> can<00:01:37.860> expect<00:01:38.640> certain

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
and not bounce so you can expect certain

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.870 
and not bounce so you can expect certain
situations<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:40.200> be<00:01:40.350> better<00:01:40.619> or<00:01:40.920> worse<00:01:41.280> for<00:01:41.310> you

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
situations to be better or worse for you

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.510 
situations to be better or worse for you
there<00:01:42.630> is<00:01:42.780> a<00:01:42.810> weak<00:01:43.110> spot<00:01:43.290> in<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.740> front<00:01:44.009> of<00:01:44.369> the

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
there is a weak spot in the front of the

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.440 
there is a weak spot in the front of the
tank<00:01:44.790> it<00:01:45.119> looks<00:01:45.689> like<00:01:46.340> kind<00:01:47.340> of<00:01:47.430> an<00:01:47.549> M<00:01:47.820> and<00:01:48.149> in

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
tank it looks like kind of an M and in

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.560 
tank it looks like kind of an M and in
the<00:01:48.600> middle<00:01:48.840> on<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.920> lower<00:01:50.130> plate<00:01:50.570> that's

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
the middle on the lower plate that's

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.330 
the middle on the lower plate that's
where<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:52.020> enemy<00:01:52.259> is<00:01:52.290> most<00:01:52.560> likely<00:01:52.860> to<00:01:53.040> pen

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
where the enemy is most likely to pen

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.300 
where the enemy is most likely to pen
you<00:01:53.490> so<00:01:53.729> if<00:01:53.880> you<00:01:54.060> stay<00:01:54.420> angled<00:01:55.350> as<00:01:55.619> program<00:01:56.130> is

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
you so if you stay angled as program is

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.760 
you so if you stay angled as program is
angled<00:01:57.180> right<00:01:57.450> there<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:58.170> enemy<00:01:58.439> is<00:01:58.469> going<00:01:58.680> to

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
angled right there the enemy is going to

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.100 
angled right there the enemy is going to
have<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:58.950> pretty<00:01:59.490> tough<00:01:59.850> time<00:02:00.240> hitting<00:02:00.810> you

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.399 
have a pretty tough time hitting you
from<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.979> front<00:02:02.130> in<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.610> hall<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:03.450> problem

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
from the front in the hall the problem

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.670 
from the front in the hall the problem
is<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:05.280> turret<00:02:06.060> is<00:02:06.299> not<00:02:06.630> that<00:02:06.899> amazing<00:02:07.259> and

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
is the turret is not that amazing and

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.169 
is the turret is not that amazing and
they<00:02:07.799> can<00:02:07.979> pen<00:02:08.220> you<00:02:08.369> right<00:02:08.640> through<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:08.970> face

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
they can pen you right through the face

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.309 
they can pen you right through the face
of<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.509> turret<00:02:09.840> it's<00:02:10.649> slightly<00:02:11.340> weaker<00:02:11.910> than

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
of the turret it's slightly weaker than

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.789 
of the turret it's slightly weaker than
e<00:02:12.409> 100<00:02:13.159> s<00:02:13.189> turret<00:02:13.879> face<00:02:14.150> overall<00:02:14.959> but<00:02:15.620> there

00:02:15.789 --> 00:02:15.799 
e 100 s turret face overall but there

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:18.129 
e 100 s turret face overall but there
are<00:02:15.950> some<00:02:16.219> angles<00:02:16.670> to<00:02:17.150> the<00:02:17.359> turret<00:02:17.659> face<00:02:17.870> which

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:18.139 
are some angles to the turret face which

00:02:18.139 --> 00:02:19.959 
are some angles to the turret face which
make<00:02:18.409> it<00:02:18.439> a<00:02:18.709> little<00:02:18.950> more<00:02:19.159> difficult<00:02:19.370> and<00:02:19.819> give

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:19.969 
make it a little more difficult and give

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:22.449 
make it a little more difficult and give
you<00:02:20.090> a<00:02:20.150> little<00:02:20.420> more<00:02:20.629> protection<00:02:21.310> he<00:02:22.310> was

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
you a little more protection he was

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:24.309 
you a little more protection he was
setting<00:02:22.700> up<00:02:22.879> the<00:02:22.999> reverse<00:02:23.359> angle<00:02:23.599> right<00:02:23.989> there

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 
setting up the reverse angle right there

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:26.440 
setting up the reverse angle right there
the<00:02:24.560> mouse<00:02:24.739> is<00:02:24.769> very<00:02:25.310> good<00:02:25.549> at<00:02:25.700> reverse<00:02:26.060> angles

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
the mouse is very good at reverse angles

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.660 
the mouse is very good at reverse angles
as<00:02:26.599> well<00:02:26.840> the<00:02:27.349> thing<00:02:27.560> remember<00:02:27.889> is<00:02:28.219> when<00:02:28.459> you

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
as well the thing remember is when you

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.059 
as well the thing remember is when you
are<00:02:28.879> not<00:02:29.150> ready<00:02:29.450> to<00:02:29.659> fire<00:02:29.900> try<00:02:30.500> to<00:02:30.560> angle<00:02:30.920> your

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
are not ready to fire try to angle your

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:33.369 
are not ready to fire try to angle your
turret<00:02:31.430> 15<00:02:31.819> to<00:02:31.909> 20<00:02:32.209> degrees<00:02:32.329> away<00:02:32.989> from<00:02:33.019> the

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:33.379 
turret 15 to 20 degrees away from the

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:35.470 
turret 15 to 20 degrees away from the
enemy<00:02:33.530> so<00:02:33.889> they<00:02:34.010> can't<00:02:34.280> get<00:02:34.519> a<00:02:34.549> flash<00:02:34.879> shot<00:02:35.239> on

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
enemy so they can't get a flash shot on

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.750 
enemy so they can't get a flash shot on
your<00:02:35.689> turf<00:02:35.900> face<00:02:36.170> here's<00:02:36.829> he's<00:02:37.250> setting<00:02:37.609> up

your turf face here's he's setting up

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.970 
your turf face here's he's setting up
the<00:02:38.030> reverse<00:02:38.419> angle<00:02:38.629> again<00:02:39.079> which<00:02:39.379> is<00:02:39.409> very

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
the reverse angle again which is very

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.970 
the reverse angle again which is very
effective<00:02:40.749> no<00:02:41.749> one<00:02:41.930> is<00:02:42.109> denying<00:02:42.620> the

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:28.819 
will die but the Traverse just isn't

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:31.809 
will die but the Traverse just isn't
good<00:03:29.090> enough<00:03:29.769> and<00:03:30.769> this<00:03:31.040> is<00:03:31.189> ultimately<00:03:31.669> what

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:31.819 
good enough and this is ultimately what
