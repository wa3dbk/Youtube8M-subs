chips<00:01:30.260> from<00:01:30.380> a<00:01:30.710> fan<00:01:30.979> deck<00:01:31.250> and<00:01:31.610> I'm<00:01:32.360> going<00:01:32.690> to

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
chips from a fan deck and I'm going to

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.890

just going to yank out three that I

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.100 
just going to yank out three that I
think<00:01:39.470> I<00:01:39.590> might<00:01:39.770> want<00:01:40.070> to<00:01:40.160> my<00:01:40.430> bow<00:01:40.670> in<00:01:41.600> terms<00:01:41.900> of

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
think I might want to my bow in terms of

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.600 
think I might want to my bow in terms of
the<00:01:42.229> color<00:01:44.410> then<00:01:45.410> I'm<00:01:45.680> going<00:01:45.920> to<00:01:46.010> cut<00:01:46.250> each<00:01:46.430> of

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
the color then I'm going to cut each of

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.270 
the color then I'm going to cut each of
these<00:01:46.729> lengthwise<00:01:47.270> so<00:01:48.080> I'll<00:01:48.229> have<00:01:48.470> six<00:01:48.890> strips

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
these lengthwise so I'll have six strips

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.280 
these lengthwise so I'll have six strips
all<00:01:49.490> together<00:01:49.729> next<00:01:50.720> we'll<00:01:50.869> want<00:01:50.990> to<00:01:51.110> make<00:01:51.229> a

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.290 
all together next we'll want to make a

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.710 
all together next we'll want to make a
loop<00:01:51.619> out<00:01:51.860> of<00:01:52.100> each<00:01:52.280> of<00:01:52.460> these<00:01:52.580> strips<00:01:52.940> I'll

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
loop out of each of these strips I'll

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.290 
loop out of each of these strips I'll
just<00:01:53.930> put<00:01:54.140> a<00:01:54.170> dab<00:01:54.649> of<00:01:54.950> hot<00:01:55.310> glue<00:01:55.369> on<00:01:56.000> one<00:01:56.229> end

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.300 
just put a dab of hot glue on one end

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:03.850 
just put a dab of hot glue on one end
and<00:02:01.030> loop<00:02:02.030> it<00:02:02.180> around<00:02:02.270> then<00:02:03.259> we're<00:02:03.590> going<00:02:03.800> to

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
and loop it around then we're going to

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:10.840 
and loop it around then we're going to
turn<00:02:04.160> this<00:02:04.340> loop<00:02:04.610> into<00:02:05.420> a<00:02:05.450> little<00:02:05.720> eight<00:02:09.850> now

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
turn this loop into a little eight now

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.210 
turn this loop into a little eight now
you<00:02:10.910> may<00:02:11.209> be<00:02:11.270> looking<00:02:11.540> at<00:02:11.810> my<00:02:11.989> hot<00:02:12.590> pink<00:02:12.830> finger

at<00:02:45.610> the<00:02:45.760> top<00:02:46.030> of<00:02:46.209> the<00:02:46.300> bow<00:02:46.510> it<00:02:46.930> could<00:02:47.200> use<00:02:47.440> a

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
at the top of the bow it could use a

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.130 
at the top of the bow it could use a
little<00:02:47.800> bit<00:02:47.860> more<00:02:48.069> volume<00:02:48.280> so<00:02:48.819> now<00:02:49.510> I'm<00:02:49.810> going

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
little bit more volume so now I'm going
