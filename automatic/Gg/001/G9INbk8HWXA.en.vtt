explain how to do bond clip a bomb on
battlefield<00:00:16.300> first<00:00:17.300> I<00:00:17.570> just<00:00:17.630> want<00:00:17.869> to<00:00:17.900> explain

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:18.260 
battlefield first I just want to explain

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.710 
battlefield first I just want to explain
the<00:00:18.410> inputs<00:00:18.740> to<00:00:18.890> get<00:00:19.010> to<00:00:19.160> the<00:00:19.279> bomb<00:00:19.449> went<00:00:20.449> into

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:20.720 
the inputs to get to the bomb went into

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.109 
the inputs to get to the bomb went into
the<00:00:20.810> stage<00:00:21.020> hit<00:00:21.410> see<00:00:21.680> down<00:00:21.890> and<00:00:22.190> see<00:00:22.400> left<00:00:22.640> then

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:23.119 
the stage hit see down and see left then

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:25.000 
the stage hit see down and see left then
it's<00:00:23.300> one<00:00:23.539> long<00:00:23.750> jump<00:00:24.050> followed<00:00:24.529> by<00:00:24.680> three

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:25.010 
it's one long jump followed by three

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:30.070 
it's one long jump followed by three
jump<00:00:25.250> dives<00:00:25.460> and<00:00:25.820> finally<00:00:26.570> a<00:00:26.750> long<00:00:27.080> jump<00:00:29.080> so

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:30.080 
jump dives and finally a long jump so

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.390 
jump dives and finally a long jump so
without<00:00:30.199> the<00:00:30.560> way<00:00:30.650> we'll<00:00:30.859> jump<00:00:31.010> straight<00:00:31.250> into

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:31.400 
without the way we'll jump straight into

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.279 
without the way we'll jump straight into
the<00:00:31.490> first<00:00:31.760> example<00:00:32.329> which<00:00:32.899> shows<00:00:32.929> what

00:00:33.279 --> 00:00:33.289 
the first example which shows what

00:00:33.289 --> 00:00:34.779 
the first example which shows what
happens<00:00:33.409> if<00:00:33.739> you<00:00:33.829> grab<00:00:34.039> the<00:00:34.159> bomb<00:00:34.309> too<00:00:34.519> early

00:00:34.779 --> 00:00:34.789 
happens if you grab the bomb too early

00:00:34.789 --> 00:00:36.520 
happens if you grab the bomb too early
you'll<00:00:35.089> gain<00:00:35.239> no<00:00:35.449> backwards<00:00:35.870> momentum<00:00:36.350> and

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:36.530 
you'll gain no backwards momentum and

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.139 
you'll gain no backwards momentum and
even<00:00:37.100> with<00:00:37.219> jumps<00:00:37.519> you<00:00:37.639> will<00:00:37.729> not<00:00:37.819> be<00:00:37.969> able<00:00:38.030> to

00:00:38.139 --> 00:00:38.149 
even with jumps you will not be able to

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:49.869 
even with jumps you will not be able to
make<00:00:38.329> it<00:00:38.479> to<00:00:38.569> the<00:00:38.659> gate<00:00:38.809> in<00:00:38.960> time<00:00:48.699> the<00:00:49.699> next

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:49.879 
make it to the gate in time the next

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:51.939 
make it to the gate in time the next
example<00:00:50.510> is<00:00:50.659> the<00:00:50.749> first<00:00:51.079> bomb<00:00:51.319> size<00:00:51.589> that<00:00:51.920> you

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949 
example is the first bomb size that you

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:53.319 
example is the first bomb size that you
can<00:00:52.129> make<00:00:52.280> it<00:00:52.369> behind<00:00:52.639> the<00:00:52.699> gate<00:00:52.850> with<00:00:53.030> which

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:53.329 
can make it behind the gate with which

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:55.209 
can make it behind the gate with which
is<00:00:53.510> small<00:00:53.809> bomb<00:00:54.019> although<00:00:54.949> I<00:00:54.979> wouldn't

00:00:55.209 --> 00:00:55.219 
is small bomb although I wouldn't

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:56.680 
is small bomb although I wouldn't
recommend<00:00:55.339> demon<00:00:55.999> for<00:00:56.119> this<00:00:56.209> bomb<00:00:56.420> size

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
recommend demon for this bomb size

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.719 
recommend demon for this bomb size
because<00:00:57.350> it<00:00:57.469> does<00:00:57.589> require<00:00:57.769> that<00:00:58.249> you<00:00:58.399> do<00:00:58.519> two

00:00:58.719 --> 00:00:58.729 
because it does require that you do two

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:00.099 
because it does require that you do two
or<00:00:58.850> three<00:00:59.029> small<00:00:59.089> jumps<00:00:59.659> and<00:00:59.869> may<00:01:00.049> be

00:01:00.099 --> 00:01:00.109 
or three small jumps and may be

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:06.580 
or three small jumps and may be
difficult<00:01:00.649> for<00:01:00.709> beginners<00:01:05.380> however<00:01:06.380> it<00:01:06.469> may

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
difficult for beginners however it may

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.230 
difficult for beginners however it may
be<00:01:06.649> useful<00:01:06.829> to<00:01:07.189> learn<00:01:07.340> in<00:01:07.490> the<00:01:07.549> future<00:01:07.939> because

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
be useful to learn in the future because

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.609 
be useful to learn in the future because
it<00:01:08.479> can<00:01:08.600> be<00:01:08.630> used<00:01:08.960> as<00:01:09.079> a<00:01:09.140> great<00:01:09.409> backup

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 
it can be used as a great backup

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:15.160 
it can be used as a great backup
strategy<00:01:12.759> this<00:01:13.759> next<00:01:14.149> example<00:01:14.450> is<00:01:14.719> medium

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
strategy this next example is medium

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:16.870 
strategy this next example is medium
bomb<00:01:15.350> this<00:01:15.920> is<00:01:16.070> the<00:01:16.189> first<00:01:16.369> barb<00:01:16.640> sighs<00:01:16.820> i

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
bomb this is the first barb sighs i

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.899 
bomb this is the first barb sighs i
recommend<00:01:17.390> you<00:01:17.450> waiting<00:01:17.689> for<00:01:18.670> once<00:01:19.670> you're<00:01:19.820> at

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:19.909 
recommend you waiting for once you're at

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:21.760 
recommend you waiting for once you're at
the<00:01:19.939> bomb<00:01:20.179> you<00:01:20.570> want<00:01:20.719> to<00:01:20.810> hit<00:01:20.929> beats<00:01:21.380> pick<00:01:21.649> the

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
the bomb you want to hit beats pick the

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.830 
the bomb you want to hit beats pick the
ball<00:01:21.920> up<00:01:21.950> hold<00:01:22.880> left<00:01:23.179> on<00:01:23.390> the<00:01:23.509> analog<00:01:23.810> stick

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
ball up hold left on the analog stick

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.870 
ball up hold left on the analog stick
then<00:01:24.829> the<00:01:24.920> inputs<00:01:25.310> are<00:01:25.490> a<00:01:25.729> a<00:01:26.229> plus<00:01:27.229> be

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
then the inputs are a a plus be

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.050 
then the inputs are a a plus be
neutrally<00:01:28.880> analog<00:01:29.210> stick<00:01:29.479> down<00:01:30.469> and<00:01:30.710> be<00:01:31.060> and

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
neutrally analog stick down and be and

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.370 
neutrally analog stick down and be and
you<00:01:32.179> want<00:01:32.329> to<00:01:32.420> tap<00:01:32.600> down<00:01:32.840> on<00:01:32.990> the<00:01:33.049> analog<00:01:33.350> stick

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
you want to tap down on the analog stick

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.249 
you want to tap down on the analog stick
and<00:01:33.920> then<00:01:34.340> press<00:01:34.579> nothing<00:01:35.030> until<00:01:35.990> your<00:01:36.109> back

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:36.259 
and then press nothing until your back

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:38.109 
and then press nothing until your back
is<00:01:36.439> against<00:01:36.679> the<00:01:36.770> gate<00:01:36.979> and<00:01:37.130> you<00:01:37.820> want<00:01:37.969> to<00:01:38.030> hit

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
is against the gate and you want to hit

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:40.359 
is against the gate and you want to hit
be<00:01:38.359> again<00:01:38.659> to<00:01:38.810> throw<00:01:39.079> the<00:01:39.200> bomb<00:01:39.380> and<00:01:39.619> this<00:01:40.249> will

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
be again to throw the bomb and this will

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:49.539 
be again to throw the bomb and this will
push<00:01:40.549> you<00:01:40.670> through<00:01:40.820> the<00:01:40.939> gate

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:52.969 

this<00:01:50.549> final<00:01:50.820> example<00:01:51.240> is<00:01:51.539> big<00:01:51.780> bomb<00:01:51.990> big<00:01:52.770> bombs

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
this final example is big bomb big bombs

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.770 
this final example is big bomb big bombs
the<00:01:53.159> best<00:01:53.340> bomb<00:01:53.549> size<00:01:53.789> because<00:01:54.329> it<00:01:54.509> gives<00:01:54.630> you

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
the best bomb size because it gives you

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.120 
the best bomb size because it gives you
the<00:01:54.869> most<00:01:54.990> backwards<00:01:55.439> momentum<00:01:55.890> and

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
the most backwards momentum and

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.529 
the most backwards momentum and
ultimately<00:01:56.579> allows<00:01:56.939> you<00:01:57.119> to<00:01:57.240> collect<00:01:57.329> the

00:01:57.529 --> 00:01:57.539 
ultimately allows you to collect the

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:02.690 
ultimately allows you to collect the
