00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.420 
makeup like in lore'l I'm cocoa but I've
noticed<00:03:31.980> that<00:03:32.160> cocoa<00:03:33.000> seems<00:03:33.390> to<00:03:33.660> be<00:03:34.100> it<00:03:35.100> works

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
noticed that cocoa seems to be it works

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.240 
noticed that cocoa seems to be it works
but<00:03:35.670> it<00:03:35.730> seems<00:03:36.120> to<00:03:36.240> be<00:03:36.360> too<00:03:36.750> dark<00:03:37.110> I<00:03:37.530> noticed

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
but it seems to be too dark I noticed

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.610 
but it seems to be too dark I noticed
that<00:03:38.310> the<00:03:38.550> cocoa<00:03:39.060> powder<00:03:39.540> the<00:03:40.110> actual

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
that the cocoa powder the actual

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.370 
that the cocoa powder the actual
translucent<00:03:41.310> powder<00:03:41.580> that<00:03:42.420> translucent

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
translucent powder that translucent

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.690 
translucent powder that translucent
powder<00:03:44.220> works<00:03:44.940> much<00:03:45.570> much<00:03:45.870> better<00:03:46.400> than<00:03:47.400> the

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
powder works much much better than the

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.520 
powder works much much better than the
actual<00:03:47.880> liquid<00:03:48.270> foundation<00:03:48.930> so<00:03:49.080> I<00:03:49.140> can<00:03:49.380> use

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
actual liquid foundation so I can use

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.500
