00:00:00.699 --> 00:00:02.470
 dülmen 

00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:05.470
 figuratively 

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:11.200
 I am today at the SIAL and Nico people in Berlin in the main plant space 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.350
 next to me is the light rail of Fortune Hello Allofs at that time he was here 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:17.640
 powerful horny part he brought 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.789
 so that could control with it and cheers and thus can tomorrow 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:21.749
 understeer 

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:22.900
 former 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.970
 Of course, Duramax is still integrated with it's Darfur control 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.039
 Lotti Kia Soul and and and Nicki July log can also have a loaf and 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:35.120
 how it works at Kia better I have to do Bakuba is quite 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.800
 easy 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.980
 Controllers are the first product to buy eleven percent 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.890
 costs 6200 euros okay 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.969
 World so cheap but very adapted for the product too 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.780
 install a software 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.440
 on the plate Euro 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.020
 Wolski or it runs the ANDTEK but plug in a pirate rest given 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.690
 getting started 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.270
 very easy as well 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.100
 «But that's me pump NCAZ Stremlau it's noon controller 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.830
 da Control can control up to 2 49 channels via 8 controls more 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.530
 there can also be extended by the Xpand Chen units to 32 lost 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.460
 So you can never really cool to consolidate that hours 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.430
 Basel I already see here, for example 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.260
 I'm now proposing sideways that made it hot again 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.590
 he turns this one on the side 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.650
 Wiesent corresponds to the chip now running with the percent parameters 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.670
 All these are in effect a niece for Barthel the entire platinum 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.210
 Diver can tax 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.680
 I showed you so that Gruner + Jahrs one basic tone reason overview but the 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:37.930
 Console or even 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.350
 the baby is the most important of the console that can compete with her this month 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.190
 I very quickly rd he had no lays 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.810
 then this 8 Rico herb Reken PR 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.939
 I then have certain mode for making it feel like I'm from the big studio 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.790
 Console 70 Schorch from one big belly into the kingdom 8 knobs movable Main 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.979
 I'm still studying 8 direction but just other ounces when I study 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:03.000
 just my chair and last year 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.059
 they have each 8 Rekener draufgelegt Mr this is for months yes 

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:12.219
 In addition, of course, I can also say that I want certain channels 

00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:14.599
 always in certain order he put on it 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:15.829
 Never judge 5 

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:17.859
 Kreuzlingen 

00:02:17.859 --> 00:02:20.510
 and then we have 8 channels on it 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.510
 Jacek Sienkiewicz percent using the same method 

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:26.080
 right at the moment when I'm somewhere 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.110
 a controller BWG recognizes this, of course, Huber is that I now in this 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.669
 Channel to edit 

00:02:31.669 --> 00:02:35.249
 you pull your channel I pulled the circles section once 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:39.180
 on the right side I have now that he now says Walpurgis 

00:02:40.669 --> 00:02:44.219
 normal 9 by Jun -prof Huber is government 

00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:46.809
 I can control this once 

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:47.939
 the controllers 

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:51.169
 but can also make a big window 

00:02:51.169 --> 00:02:54.339
 how can I take other parameters where can change accordingly 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:58.339
 the same right 

00:02:58.339 --> 00:03:00.089
 also applies to the Palm Pre 

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:01.259
 panorama 

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:04.349
 a man I have the opportunity to do that to her 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:07.349
 I see here "You can Obama from these so can 

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:10.569
 they look impressive 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:12.899
 but is not a Cubase video 

00:03:12.899 --> 00:03:16.239
 If I expected Haye to be clear it is absolutely no club food 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:18.340
 the IOC actually represents 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.620
 Injected into a spray that does not represent a UBA ripped mixer that can 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.170
 I also call a sale several times before then I'm in 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:27.949
 wrap up Switzer 

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:29.489
 so that's me already 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:34.359
 the virtual keyboard that allows you to name more has Funky 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:35.509
 Bass VOC Rappen 

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:39.969
 In addition, I still have Edit Pellens these are my show cars 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:43.859
 from my child I want to get in there 

00:03:44.399 --> 00:03:47.399
 but again a formal supported too 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:54.179
 AFP are for Dove 

00:03:54.179 --> 00:03:55.729
 understandably so 

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:58.969
 there are if you just not the quiz is controlled on the touch screen 

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:02.899
 that's a key I probably will be among people as well 

00:04:02.899 --> 00:04:06.769
 out of how we get out of it the very same thing yes that controls then the 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:11.259
 appropriate parameters in the software no matter what it is exactly no problem 

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:13.109
 and around 

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:16.039
 now my question is honestly changed in the preliminary conversation 

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:17.659
 like fine ministries 

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:21.009
 Here is this error on the ITB with the very very long session already 

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:22.840
 the four millimeters are throwing 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.550
 the visit to 100 millimeters further yes 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.330
 because where the natural resolution corresponds to the resolution of the 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.229
 Internet appearance and Juba is 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:34.940
 in fact year there does not work via midi protocol to ambience directly 

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:37.460
 programmed with the Software Development Kit 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.250
 from Cuba Travel 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:40.849
 So there is no mediator in it 

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:45.280
 What used to be Yukon protocol department Mandic checkers can do anything 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.930
 that's exactly what it's right with the software development kit 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:50.020
 programmed 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.060
 yes and therefore not limited to complaints protocol that was amazing 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.590
 Century for me 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.010
 Impressive because there I always got annoyed so always the vulnerability 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:04.590
 Fotolia is 80 to 70 percent good at these standard protocols but man 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:07.950
 Never has the feeling that the program really controls it so directly 

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:09.330
 is grazing both at the moment 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.539
 the eye is enough and our customers always have it 

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:15.840
 Nick Frese also gives his wish list quite clearly years and there we can do a lot 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.740
 react faster because the indirect is sought at all a child 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:22.050
 program and who is using what like interface 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.050
 normal ethernet connections 

00:05:25.939 --> 00:05:26.950
 not bad 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:28.030
 I am impressed 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:32.620
 but that bidders to buy but of course directly stated m who 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:36.449
 at FCZ with balls clear but perhaps burdened world thank you
