00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.270 
way you can unable and disable a flash
player<00:02:40.840> on<00:02:40.959> your<00:02:41.020> Samsung<00:02:41.530> Galaxy<00:02:41.560> s3<00:02:42.040> mini

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
player on your Samsung Galaxy s3 mini

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.660

unless<00:02:42.910> you<00:02:43.590> uninstall<00:02:44.590> a<00:02:44.770> flash<00:02:45.130> player<00:02:45.400> from

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
unless you uninstall a flash player from

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.240 
unless you uninstall a flash player from
your<00:02:45.880> samsung<00:02:46.720> galaxy<00:02:46.750> s3<00:02:47.260> mini<00:02:47.470> and<00:02:47.860> then<00:02:48.100> you

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
your samsung galaxy s3 mini and then you

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.880 
your samsung galaxy s3 mini and then you
have<00:02:48.400> to<00:02:48.580> install<00:02:48.850> a<00:02:48.910> flash<00:02:49.239> player<00:02:49.480> game<00:02:49.890> so

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
have to install a flash player game so

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.699 
have to install a flash player game so
this<00:02:51.100> is<00:02:51.250> a<00:02:51.280> downside<00:02:51.640> of<00:02:52.180> having<00:02:52.709> samsung

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
this is a downside of having samsung

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.010 
this is a downside of having samsung
galaxy<00:02:54.070> s3<00:02:54.220> when<00:02:54.670> we<00:02:55.090> are<00:02:55.330> talking<00:02:55.750> about<00:02:55.840> a

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020 
galaxy s3 when we are talking about a

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.330 
galaxy s3 when we are talking about a
flash<00:02:56.380> player<00:02:58.230> now<00:02:59.230> let's<00:02:59.560> see<00:02:59.709> which<00:02:59.920> one<00:03:00.160> is

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
flash player now let's see which one is

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.640 
flash player now let's see which one is
better<00:03:00.640> in<00:03:00.940> scrolling<00:03:01.390> pages<00:03:01.750> and<00:03:01.989> which<00:03:02.320> one

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
better in scrolling pages and which one

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.670 
better in scrolling pages and which one
is<00:03:02.860> going<00:03:03.610> to<00:03:04.150> zoom<00:03:04.690> in<00:03:04.930> and<00:03:05.170> out<00:03:05.260> to<00:03:05.500> more

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
is going to zoom in and out to more

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.330 
is going to zoom in and out to more
smoother<00:03:06.070> for<00:03:06.280> us<00:03:06.959> so<00:03:07.959> this<00:03:08.170> is<00:03:08.200> a<00:03:08.560> first<00:03:09.100> way

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
smoother for us so this is a first way

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.460 
smoother for us so this is a first way
to<00:03:09.459> zoom<00:03:09.640> in<00:03:09.850> and<00:03:10.000> out<00:03:10.060> anything<00:03:10.600> on<00:03:10.780> one<00:03:11.290> sv

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
to zoom in and out anything on one sv

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.490 
to zoom in and out anything on one sv
and<00:03:11.650> I<00:03:11.950> think<00:03:12.220> it's<00:03:12.340> lagging<00:03:12.640> a<00:03:12.850> lot<00:03:13.090> on<00:03:13.330> a

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
and I think it's lagging a lot on a

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.410 
and I think it's lagging a lot on a
wwe.com<00:03:14.500> side<00:03:15.070> or<00:03:15.549> you<00:03:15.700> can<00:03:15.850> say<00:03:16.030> on<00:03:16.180> a<00:03:16.209> heavy

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
wwe.com side or you can say on a heavy

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.140 
wwe.com side or you can say on a heavy
flash<00:03:16.750> player<00:03:16.930> content<00:03:17.350> site<00:03:17.730> it's<00:03:18.730> lagging<00:03:18.970> a

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
flash player content site it's lagging a

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.120 
flash player content site it's lagging a
lot<00:03:19.330> here<00:03:19.600> you<00:03:19.690> can<00:03:19.840> see<00:03:20.049> Lord<00:03:20.440> of<00:03:20.590> legging<00:03:20.980> is

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
lot here you can see Lord of legging is

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.610 
lot here you can see Lord of legging is
involved<00:03:21.790> in<00:03:22.450> zooming<00:03:22.989> in<00:03:23.140> and<00:03:23.230> out<00:03:23.320> in<00:03:23.650> one<00:03:23.709> sv

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
involved in zooming in and out in one sv

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.199 
involved in zooming in and out in one sv
and<00:03:26.620> let's<00:03:27.400> see<00:03:27.580> how<00:03:27.790> I<00:03:27.820> streets<00:03:28.239> performing

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
and let's see how I streets performing

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:36.590 
and let's see how I streets performing
so<00:03:31.209> I<00:03:31.239> think<00:03:31.570> it<00:03:31.690> has<00:03:31.870> less<00:03:32.650> lag<00:03:33.010> than<00:03:33.459> one<00:03:33.760> sv

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:41.660 

so<00:03:37.600> this<00:03:37.780> is<00:03:37.900> a<00:03:37.930> good<00:03:38.200> sign<00:03:38.440> of<00:03:38.709> having<00:03:39.040> s3<00:03:39.790> mini

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
so this is a good sign of having s3 mini

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.280 
so this is a good sign of having s3 mini
now<00:03:42.670> I<00:03:42.700> have<00:03:43.090> already<00:03:43.269> shown<00:03:43.600> you<00:03:43.660> how<00:03:43.959> to<00:03:43.989> zoom

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
now I have already shown you how to zoom

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:45.780 
now I have already shown you how to zoom
in<00:03:44.470> and<00:03:44.590> out<00:03:44.650> anything<00:03:45.160> on<00:03:45.280> both<00:03:45.489> of<00:03:45.519> these

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
in and out anything on both of these

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.600 
in and out anything on both of these
devices<00:03:46.120> and<00:03:46.950> let's<00:03:47.950> see<00:03:48.160> how<00:03:48.280> our<00:03:48.310> schooling

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:48.610 
devices and let's see how our schooling

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:50.670 
devices and let's see how our schooling
is<00:03:48.820> looking<00:03:49.120> so<00:03:49.840> scrolling<00:03:50.140> is<00:03:50.350> looking

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:25.690 
to disable a flash player on this side

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:28.140 
to disable a flash player on this side
and<00:05:26.469> let's<00:05:26.860> see<00:05:27.069> how<00:05:27.279> this<00:05:27.520> is<00:05:27.580> going<00:05:27.969> to

and let's see how this is going to

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:36.300 
and let's see how this is going to
perform<00:05:28.479> now<00:05:28.750> I<00:05:34.500> think<00:05:35.500> there<00:05:35.650> is<00:05:35.680> not<00:05:35.919> much<00:05:36.159> of

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:36.310 
perform now I think there is not much of

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:37.980 
perform now I think there is not much of
a<00:05:36.400> difference<00:05:36.789> when<00:05:37.000> you<00:05:37.180> disable<00:05:37.539> a<00:05:37.719> flash

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:37.990 
a difference when you disable a flash

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.890 
a difference when you disable a flash
player<00:05:38.229> on<00:05:38.259> your<00:05:38.469> one<00:05:39.370> sv<00:05:39.550> it<00:05:39.940> is<00:05:40.089> still

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:40.900 
player on your one sv it is still

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:49.570 
player on your one sv it is still
lagging

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:49.580 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:51.399
