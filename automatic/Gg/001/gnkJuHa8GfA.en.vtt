 need little things what we are going to 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.120
 to use is mainly honey and that is 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.620
 honey so natural bee not hot 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.500
 cakes honey contains many vitamins 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.989
 and minerals and it's a very good moisturizer 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.450
 it's going to be how you can feed 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.460
 our hair 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.230
 and we are going to add 2 tablespoons of 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.870
 avocado because like honey is 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:04.300
 a very good moisturizer and it helps a lot 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:08.370
 to improve the condition of your hair 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.370
 and now we only stir well 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.880
 When it's ready, you only put it on 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.650
 Wet hair and leave about 20 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.810
 minutes you can optionally add 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.210
 olive oil so that our next 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:25.750
 do not be so sticky after 20 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:28.119
 white minutes do well and ready is a 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.520
