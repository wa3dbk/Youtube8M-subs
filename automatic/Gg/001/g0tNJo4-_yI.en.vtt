00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.180 
is so stimulating to them and it is so
all-encompassing<00:02:11.020> that<00:02:12.020> the<00:02:12.650> children<00:02:13.070> they

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
all-encompassing that the children they

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.830 
all-encompassing that the children they
don't<00:02:13.370> realize<00:02:13.790> how<00:02:13.820> hard<00:02:14.210> they<00:02:14.330> are<00:02:14.360> working

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
don't realize how hard they are working

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.480 
don't realize how hard they are working
when<00:02:15.440> they're<00:02:15.620> asked<00:02:15.830> to<00:02:15.980> do<00:02:16.160> all<00:02:16.340> these

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
when they're asked to do all these

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.080 
when they're asked to do all these
movements<00:02:17.410> and<00:02:18.410> therefore<00:02:19.070> it<00:02:19.370> is<00:02:19.670> just

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
movements and therefore it is just

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:26.170 
movements and therefore it is just
producing<00:02:20.630> the<00:02:20.780> most<00:02:20.930> amazing<00:02:21.410> results<00:02:25.180> the

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
producing the most amazing results the

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.560 
producing the most amazing results the
horse<00:02:26.570> has<00:02:26.959> a<00:02:27.709> movement<00:02:28.430> when<00:02:29.120> you<00:02:29.300> have

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
horse has a movement when you have

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.740 
horse has a movement when you have
somebody<00:02:29.750> with<00:02:29.959> severe<00:02:30.320> spasticity<00:02:31.030> or<00:02:32.030> that

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
somebody with severe spasticity or that

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.750 
somebody with severe spasticity or that
gets<00:02:32.959> overwhelmed<00:02:33.650> the<00:02:33.830> horse<00:02:34.040> has<00:02:34.459> that

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
gets overwhelmed the horse has that

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.580 
gets overwhelmed the horse has that
quiet<00:02:35.120> nature<00:02:35.450> in<00:02:35.720> half<00:02:35.870> that<00:02:36.080> and<00:02:36.380> really

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
quiet nature in half that and really

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.210 
quiet nature in half that and really
move<00:02:36.920> with<00:02:37.160> the<00:02:37.760> side<00:02:37.970> to<00:02:38.150> side<00:02:38.330> roll<00:02:39.290> there<00:02:39.709> it

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
move with the side to side roll there it

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.400 
move with the side to side roll there it
it<00:02:40.850> mimics<00:02:41.150> walking<00:02:41.840> in<00:02:41.959> a<00:02:42.050> very<00:02:42.230> nice

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
it mimics walking in a very nice

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.920 
it mimics walking in a very nice
comfortable<00:02:42.890> gay<00:02:43.100> so<00:02:43.160> therefore<00:02:43.820> the<00:02:43.970> person

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
comfortable gay so therefore the person

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.230 
comfortable gay so therefore the person
has<00:02:45.680> muscles<00:02:46.160> that<00:02:46.280> starts<00:02:46.550> with<00:02:46.670> snuff<00:02:46.970> they

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:47.240 
has muscles that starts with snuff they

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.570 
has muscles that starts with snuff they
start<00:02:47.510> to<00:02:47.720> get<00:02:48.500> more<00:02:48.530> comfortable<00:02:48.950> and<00:02:49.459> their

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
start to get more comfortable and their

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.250 
start to get more comfortable and their
body<00:02:49.820> really<00:02:50.150> starts<00:02:50.270> to<00:02:50.540> feel<00:02:50.750> better<00:02:50.810> and

body really starts to feel better and

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.979 
body really starts to feel better and
then<00:02:51.470> when<00:02:51.769> people<00:02:52.160> say<00:02:52.910> they<00:02:53.150> have<00:02:53.330> autism

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
then when people say they have autism

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:55.690 
then when people say they have autism
you<00:02:54.230> know<00:02:54.350> they<00:02:54.620> get<00:02:54.769> overwhelmed<00:02:55.400> by<00:02:55.519> what's
