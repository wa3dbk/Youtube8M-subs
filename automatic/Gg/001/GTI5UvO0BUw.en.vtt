00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.630 
had to turn up the level of the main mix
and<00:00:31.219> for<00:00:32.219> some<00:00:32.340> reason<00:00:32.369> was<00:00:32.730> turned<00:00:32.969> down<00:00:33.059> and

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640

and for some reason was turned down and
instruction<00:00:35.640> manual<00:00:36.090> suck<00:00:36.390> because<00:00:36.750> it<00:00:36.899> never

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
instruction manual suck because it never

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.350 
instruction manual suck because it never
told<00:00:37.260> me<00:00:37.380> to<00:00:37.530> turn<00:00:37.649> it<00:00:37.829> back<00:00:37.860> up<00:00:38.210> but<00:00:39.210> now<00:00:39.329> i

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
told me to turn it back up but now i

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.150 
told me to turn it back up but now i
know<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:39.989> i<00:00:40.079> have<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.530> pan<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.520> game<00:00:41.760> and<00:00:43.160> the

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
know and i have the pan the game and the

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.090 
know and i have the pan the game and the
trim<00:00:44.489> all<00:00:44.780> set<00:00:45.780> pretty<00:00:46.620> much<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.950> way<00:00:47.070> I

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
trim all set pretty much the way I

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.340 
trim all set pretty much the way I
wanted<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.610> there<00:00:48.360> is<00:00:48.570> still<00:00:48.780> a<00:00:48.840> little<00:00:48.989> bit<00:00:49.230> of

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
wanted to there is still a little bit of

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.510 
wanted to there is still a little bit of
white<00:00:49.559> noise<00:00:49.739> but<00:00:49.950> that<00:00:50.190> might<00:00:50.370> be<00:00:50.399> just

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
white noise but that might be just

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.979 
white noise but that might be just
because<00:00:50.940> of<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.059> furnace<00:00:51.480> whatnot<00:00:51.870> because

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
because of the furnace whatnot because

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.930

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
find the time well usually I play games

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:23.150 
find the time well usually I play games
and<00:03:20.070> I<00:03:20.670> watch<00:03:21.120> shows<00:03:21.480> at<00:03:21.750> the<00:03:21.870> same<00:03:22.170> time<00:03:22.380> and<00:03:22.620> I

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
and I watch shows at the same time and I

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.319 
and I watch shows at the same time and I
can<00:03:23.310> still<00:03:23.459> concentrate<00:03:23.880> and<00:03:24.000> get<00:03:24.090> the<00:03:24.209> most

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
can still concentrate and get the most

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:27.440 
can still concentrate and get the most
out<00:03:24.570> of<00:03:24.600> both<00:03:24.840> and<00:03:25.160> unfortunately<00:03:26.160> that's<00:03:27.000> my

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
out of both and unfortunately that's my

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.000 
out of both and unfortunately that's my
limit<00:03:27.720> I<00:03:27.900> can't<00:03:28.140> even<00:03:28.290> chew<00:03:28.440> gum<00:03:28.620> while<00:03:28.799> do

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
limit I can't even chew gum while do

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.050 
limit I can't even chew gum while do
that<00:03:29.190> so<00:03:29.610> it<00:03:29.730> takes<00:03:29.880> all<00:03:30.030> my<00:03:30.150> concentration

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
that so it takes all my concentration

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:37.280 
that so it takes all my concentration
