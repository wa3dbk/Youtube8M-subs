00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:05.879
 Hello and welcome to 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.910
 worldclub i in isabell of which and 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.790
 Today we make the basic recipe for 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:13.500
 chapter 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.790
 Everything you need for it you will find 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.430
 below in the description 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.770
 We just start doing this 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.539
 I need a food processor her 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.560
 But you can also do it with the hand mixer 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.150
 do 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:29.670
 I start with the butter that should 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:32.520
 Room temperature so do not have that cold 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.760
 Can I put the butter around with the sugar 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.040
 namely beat frothy 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:41.270
 the whole to 23 minutes stir and so 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.270
 to become really fluid 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.370
 the mother and the sugar hat together 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.230
 now come the frothy 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:57.860
 other ingredients were on the one go 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.860
 and 2 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:08.960
 but not all at once 

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:12.189
 but a bit in a row with it 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:14.840
 the machines and shared 

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:18.170
 more uniformly mixed together 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:23.240
 I also only give half of them 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:27.399
 to do it now very carefully 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.399
 not the whole 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:44.159
 and now the second one can do it 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:49.679
 I can do my rest, too 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:53.009
 already doing my bosom and first time 

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:58.020
 be careful first half to 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:02:01.670
 watch how day looks and then 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.670
 It may still be too tight 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.880
 and now I'll give you one more end 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.760
 Of course you can also do many 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:20.840
 Other things we give this cola 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.970
 or I'm afraid I have this already 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:30.020
 like a band scraped and give 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:32.950
 just too wet is ready and we 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:35.480
 can form the papac 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.740
 So I think it's my dough in the 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.780
 capex shaped 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.820
 I have here a paper looking ever 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.650
 you can do it now, of course 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.660
 with the spoon make with two spoons 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:48.200
 working is pretty good too but me 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:50.300
 like to work with syringes but even 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.030
 not a problem at home now 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:55.690
 because a completely different customary much 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.690
 to find booty 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:14.030
 this is generally four wanted hits 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:15.430
 my whole mass in the corner and turn 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:20.270
 back up here 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:24.080
 now i need to honor and cut 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:27.440
 we just have a small and up here 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:29.510
 can start with the filling 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.519
 the whole thing will not be so 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.739
 mess that not so many landed 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:35.870
 tin and I can be great too 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:39.680
 the whole dosing that all the same 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:42.350
 becomes large so that me as a fix coming 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.450
 now at 160 degrees 20 minutes in the oven 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:47.380
 I have the cupcakes already out of the 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.610
 oven have the chance of this 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.530
 put lattices to make them beautiful 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:54.920
 can cool down when they are in there 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.180
 then they will stay and specki 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.750
 Of course we do not want that 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:02.060
 right on a grid and as soon as the 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:04.100
 we can cool them down too 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.739
 with butter for the granite that this 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:08.959
 However, in anna called only I 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:11.120
 me shows you commented on 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:14.799

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.799
