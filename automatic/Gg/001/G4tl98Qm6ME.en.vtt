looks<00:01:06.970> quiet<00:01:07.240> to<00:01:07.420> me<00:01:07.600> picking<00:01:08.260> anything<00:01:08.470> up

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.650 
looks quiet to me picking anything up

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.930 
looks quiet to me picking anything up
negative<00:01:09.580> something's<00:01:10.420> not<00:01:10.540> right<00:01:11.940> so

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:12.940 
negative something's not right so

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.370 
negative something's not right so
there's<00:01:13.090> an<00:01:13.210> entirely<00:01:13.540> different<00:01:13.960> scale<00:01:14.200> of

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:17.259 
and therefore different tactics that you

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:19.770 
and therefore different tactics that you
have<00:01:17.410> to<00:01:17.590> use<00:01:17.770> we<00:01:18.280> know<00:01:18.460> how<00:01:18.700> aliens<00:01:19.330> this<00:01:19.509> time

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
had a lot of fun being able to come up

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:39.309 
had a lot of fun being able to come up
with<00:02:38.150> some<00:02:38.390> of<00:02:38.480> these<00:02:38.540> types<00:02:38.780> of<00:02:38.900> weapons<00:02:39.230> that

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
with some of these types of weapons that

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:41.110 
with some of these types of weapons that
are<00:02:39.530> really<00:02:39.830> maximizing<00:02:40.489> destruction<00:02:41.000> I

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
are really maximizing destruction I

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.460 
are really maximizing destruction I
think<00:02:41.360> at<00:02:41.450> the<00:02:41.540> core<00:02:41.569> of<00:02:41.780> it<00:02:41.959> it<00:02:42.080> is<00:02:42.200> a<00:02:42.230> game

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
think at the core of it it is a game

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:43.990 
think at the core of it it is a game
it's<00:02:42.709> entertainment<00:02:43.100> and<00:02:43.430> it's<00:02:43.670> going<00:02:43.819> to<00:02:43.880> be

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
it's entertainment and it's going to be

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.690 
it's entertainment and it's going to be
fun<00:02:44.180> I<00:02:44.709> think<00:02:45.709> we've<00:02:45.830> really<00:02:46.130> tightened<00:02:46.580> it<00:02:46.640> up

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
fun I think we've really tightened it up

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.339 
fun I think we've really tightened it up
with<00:02:46.880> red<00:02:47.060> faction<00:02:47.239> armageddon<00:02:47.630> it's<00:02:48.110> still

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:48.349 
with red faction armageddon it's still

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:50.830
