00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
kind of exuberance and complexity and so

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.960 
kind of exuberance and complexity and so
when<00:02:25.410> I<00:02:25.500> looked<00:02:25.709> at<00:02:25.799> the<00:02:25.890> work<00:02:26.069> I<00:02:26.370> said<00:02:26.430> what<00:02:26.940> I

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
when I looked at the work I said what I

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.570 
when I looked at the work I said what I
would<00:02:27.150> like<00:02:27.269> to<00:02:27.330> do<00:02:27.660> is<00:02:27.959> to<00:02:28.379> offer<00:02:28.980> him

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580

would like to do is to offer him
stillness<00:02:30.030> and<00:02:30.750> rather<00:02:31.080> than<00:02:31.379> make<00:02:31.650> a<00:02:31.980> set<00:02:32.280> for

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
stillness and rather than make a set for

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.729 
stillness and rather than make a set for
the<00:02:32.700> dance<00:02:32.940> I<00:02:33.330> would<00:02:33.720> perform<00:02:34.590> as<00:02:35.280> well<00:02:36.739> for

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
I said Stephen we should do it in honey

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.390 
I said Stephen we should do it in honey
because<00:03:23.849> honey<00:03:24.739> looks<00:03:25.739> and<00:03:25.980> feels<00:03:26.220> like

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
very hard to understand that we did this

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.040 
very hard to understand that we did this
together<00:04:53.610> because<00:04:54.450> they<00:04:54.570> want<00:04:54.750> to<00:04:54.810> think<00:04:54.960> of
