extremely<00:00:24.770> hard<00:00:24.980> to<00:00:25.099> find<00:00:25.130> so<00:00:25.820> it<00:00:25.970> took<00:00:26.119> a<00:00:26.210> lot

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:26.330 
extremely hard to find so it took a lot

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.060 
extremely hard to find so it took a lot
of<00:00:26.450> experimentation<00:00:27.200> to<00:00:27.410> figure<00:00:27.740> out<00:00:27.890> how<00:00:28.039> all

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.070 
of experimentation to figure out how all

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.580 
of experimentation to figure out how all
this<00:00:28.369> went<00:00:28.609> together<00:00:28.760> and<00:00:29.289> looking<00:00:30.289> at<00:00:30.410> a<00:00:30.439> lot

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:30.590 
this went together and looking at a lot

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.250 
this went together and looking at a lot
of<00:00:30.880> bits<00:00:31.880> and<00:00:32.000> pieces<00:00:32.239> of<00:00:32.570> other<00:00:32.660> make<00:00:32.960> makes

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:33.260 
of bits and pieces of other make makes

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.830 
of bits and pieces of other make makes
and<00:00:33.410> manufactures<00:00:34.010> but<00:00:34.040> I<00:00:34.280> finally<00:00:34.550> got<00:00:34.910> it

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:35.840 
and manufactures but I finally got it

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.210 
and manufactures but I finally got it
all<00:00:35.960> assembled<00:00:36.410> and<00:00:36.530> I<00:00:36.559> thought<00:00:36.739> I'd<00:00:36.890> show<00:00:37.190> you

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:37.220 
all assembled and I thought I'd show you

simply two bolts that you can see here

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.819 
simply two bolts that you can see here
it's<00:00:50.360> pretty<00:00:50.510> self-explanatory<00:00:50.960> and<00:00:51.710> the

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:51.829 
it's pretty self-explanatory and the

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:53.380

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
one side to the other the two shoes for

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:00.729 
one side to the other the two shoes for
each<00:00:58.250> side<00:00:58.550> are<00:00:58.789> different<00:00:59.300> the<00:01:00.260> two<00:01:00.559> that

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
each side are different the two that

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:03.549 
each side are different the two that
goes<00:01:00.920> toward<00:01:01.219> the<00:01:01.280> front<00:01:01.579> of<00:01:01.670> the<00:01:01.730> car<00:01:02.050> has<00:01:03.050> pad

goes toward the front of the car has pad
material<00:01:03.739> over<00:01:04.339> a<00:01:04.369> much<00:01:04.580> smaller<00:01:05.000> area<00:01:06.160> then

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:07.160 
material over a much smaller area then

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.770 
material over a much smaller area then
the<00:01:07.369> pad<00:01:07.550> that<00:01:07.580> goes<00:01:07.880> to<00:01:08.090> the<00:01:08.180> rear<00:01:08.420> of<00:01:08.450> the<00:01:08.600> car

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
the pad that goes to the rear of the car

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.450 
the pad that goes to the rear of the car
which<00:01:08.990> is<00:01:09.020> the<00:01:09.140> trailing<00:01:09.560> shoe<00:01:09.770> which<00:01:10.130> covers

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
which is the trailing shoe which covers

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.850 
which is the trailing shoe which covers
a<00:01:10.490> much<00:01:10.700> larger<00:01:11.149> area<00:01:11.330> it's<00:01:12.320> important<00:01:12.680> not<00:01:12.800> to

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
a much larger area it's important not to

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.070 
a much larger area it's important not to
get<00:01:13.130> those<00:01:13.340> confused<00:01:13.610> because<00:01:14.570> they<00:01:14.899> will

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
get those confused because they will

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.540 
get those confused because they will
interchange<00:01:15.410> and<00:01:15.920> you<00:01:16.009> can<00:01:16.160> completely

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:16.550 
interchange and you can completely

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.630 
interchange and you can completely
assemble<00:01:17.090> the<00:01:17.240> rear<00:01:18.140> end<00:01:18.289> like<00:01:18.860> I<00:01:19.009> did<00:01:19.220> with

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
assemble the rear end like I did with

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.199 
assemble the rear end like I did with
them<00:01:19.789> in<00:01:19.880> the<00:01:19.970> wrong<00:01:20.149> order

00:01:22.199 --> 00:01:22.209 
them in the wrong order

00:01:22.209 --> 00:01:24.400 
them in the wrong order
inside<00:01:23.209> here<00:01:23.479> starting<00:01:23.840> to<00:01:23.929> look<00:01:24.020> at<00:01:24.170> some<00:01:24.319> of

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:24.410 
inside here starting to look at some of

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.359 
inside here starting to look at some of
the<00:01:24.470> internal<00:01:24.560> parts<00:01:25.060> here<00:01:26.060> you<00:01:26.179> can<00:01:26.330> see<00:01:26.569> the

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:27.369 
the internal parts here you can see the

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:31.029 
the internal parts here you can see the
park<00:01:28.369> brake<00:01:28.640> lever<00:01:29.410> that<00:01:30.410> joins<00:01:30.740> the<00:01:31.009> two

00:01:31.029 --> 00:01:31.039 
park brake lever that joins the two

shoes<00:01:31.630> from<00:01:32.630> one<00:01:32.869> side<00:01:33.170> to<00:01:33.470> the<00:01:34.099> other<00:01:34.899> in

00:01:35.889 --> 00:01:35.899 
shoes from one side to the other in

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:38.100 
shoes from one side to the other in
order<00:01:35.990> to<00:01:36.140> get<00:01:36.289> light<00:01:36.500> in<00:01:36.679> there

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
order to get light in there

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.270 
order to get light in there
and<00:01:39.110> you'll<00:01:39.259> notice<00:01:39.410> that<00:01:39.500> one<00:01:39.740> side<00:01:40.039> has<00:01:40.069> a

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
and you'll notice that one side has a

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.479 
and you'll notice that one side has a
spring<00:01:40.729> over<00:01:40.880> it<00:01:41.590> and<00:01:42.590> the<00:01:42.709> spring<00:01:42.979> goes<00:01:43.190> on

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:43.489 
spring over it and the spring goes on

00:01:43.489 --> 00:01:46.270 
spring over it and the spring goes on
the<00:01:43.759> end<00:01:43.940> of<00:01:44.209> the<00:01:44.479> bar<00:01:44.750> that<00:01:45.560> has<00:01:45.709> a<00:01:45.739> narrow

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
the end of the bar that has a narrow

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.419 
the end of the bar that has a narrow
knotch<00:01:47.259> there's<00:01:48.259> a<00:01:48.319> much<00:01:48.470> wider<00:01:48.770> notch<00:01:49.069> in

00:01:49.419 --> 00:01:49.429 
knotch there's a much wider notch in

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:54.490 
knotch there's a much wider notch in
this<00:01:50.209> end<00:01:50.450> here<00:01:50.780> and<00:01:51.130> the<00:01:52.130> reason<00:01:53.229> and<00:01:54.229> you<00:01:54.349> can

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
this end here and the reason and you can

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.410 
this end here and the reason and you can
see<00:01:54.679> right<00:01:54.860> here<00:01:55.190> kind<00:01:55.880> of<00:01:55.970> hiding<00:01:56.300> in<00:01:56.390> the

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
see right here kind of hiding in the

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.900 
see right here kind of hiding in the
background<00:01:56.599> the<00:01:57.200> reason<00:01:57.500> it<00:01:57.619> has<00:01:57.770> a<00:01:57.910> wider

00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:58.910 
background the reason it has a wider

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.359 
background the reason it has a wider
notch<00:01:59.209> in<00:01:59.450> it<00:01:59.539> is<00:02:00.140> because<00:02:00.500> it<00:02:00.619> also<00:02:00.739> goes<00:02:01.069> over

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
notch in it is because it also goes over

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:04.270 
notch in it is because it also goes over

leave that part out it's kind of

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:06.309 
leave that part out it's kind of
important

00:02:06.309 --> 00:02:06.319 
important

difficult to stretch it goes on to the
other<00:03:24.030> shoe<00:03:24.330> so<00:03:25.200> basically<00:03:25.590> it<00:03:25.769> holds<00:03:26.040> two

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
other shoe so basically it holds two

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.030 
other shoe so basically it holds two
shoes<00:03:26.549> together<00:03:26.820> at<00:03:27.120> the<00:03:27.239> bottom<00:03:27.650> and<00:03:28.650> also

provides tension for the cable that goes

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:35.960 
provides tension for the cable that goes
up<00:03:33.450> to<00:03:33.570> here<00:03:33.959> it's<00:03:34.709> part<00:03:35.010> of<00:03:35.040> the<00:03:35.220> self

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
up to here it's part of the self

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.990 
up to here it's part of the self
adjusting<00:03:36.420> mechanism<00:03:36.989> and<00:03:37.670> allows<00:03:38.670> this

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
taking up room for slack when the jet

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:58.550 
taking up room for slack when the jet
window<00:03:54.900> breaks<00:03:55.109> where<00:03:57.109> that's<00:03:58.109> the<00:03:58.230> basic

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
window breaks where that's the basic

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.430 
window breaks where that's the basic
arrangement<00:03:58.769> of<00:03:59.130> parts<00:04:00.230> hopefully<00:04:01.230> this

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
arrangement of parts hopefully this

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.380 
arrangement of parts hopefully this
video<00:04:01.920> will<00:04:02.160> be<00:04:02.280> of<00:04:02.370> some<00:04:02.670> assistance<00:04:02.790> to<00:04:03.239> you

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
video will be of some assistance to you

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.289 
video will be of some assistance to you
I<00:04:03.660> wish<00:04:03.900> I'd<00:04:04.109> had<00:04:04.290> something<00:04:04.709> like<00:04:04.890> this<00:04:05.299> many

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 
I wish I'd had something like this many

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:07.759 
I wish I'd had something like this many
hours<00:04:06.600> ago<00:04:06.750> when<00:04:06.989> I<00:04:07.049> started<00:04:07.290> into<00:04:07.650> this

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769 
hours ago when I started into this

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:09.830 
hours ago when I started into this
project<00:04:08.150> but<00:04:09.150> I've<00:04:09.269> checked<00:04:09.510> it<00:04:09.690> all<00:04:09.810> out

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
project but I've checked it all out

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.660 
project but I've checked it all out
everything<00:04:10.410> all<00:04:10.560> works<00:04:10.950> and<00:04:11.130> functions<00:04:11.310> the

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
everything all works and functions the

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.849 
everything all works and functions the
way<00:04:11.700> it's<00:04:11.910> supposed<00:04:12.209> to<00:04:12.329> so<00:04:12.690> we<00:04:13.500> know<00:04:13.620> this<00:04:13.799> is

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:13.859 
way it's supposed to so we know this is

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:16.520 
way it's supposed to so we know this is
this<00:04:14.609> is<00:04:14.790> correct<00:04:15.060> so<00:04:15.359> hopefully<00:04:16.200> this<00:04:16.380> will

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
this is correct so hopefully this will

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.419 
this is correct so hopefully this will
be<00:04:16.650> of<00:04:16.739> some<00:04:16.979> assistance<00:04:17.100> to<00:04:17.519> you<00:04:17.609> thanks
