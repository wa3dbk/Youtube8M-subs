00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:18.430
 hello everyone welcome and we're going to do 

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:20.770
 this tutorial of delineated cat's eye 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.060
 as in social networks 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.270
 belief here so that together we do 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.940
 this makeup 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:30.330
 well let's start our tutorial 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:33.060
 of delineated cat's eye how are we going to 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:36.330
 do we are going to use this which is a 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:38.760
 cream gel is called black hawk and what 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:41.250
 let's do with a brush that is 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.850
 angular that is planet so that we 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.550
 let it be easier to do it and I 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.260
 I put a little product in 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.600
 the hand and pressed it with a brush and 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.390
 so that last one to me particularly 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.730
 I like to do the line holding me 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.560
 with the outside finger I 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.050
 makes it easier but there are people who 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:03.510
 like with the open eye that I do not know 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.190
 they have to sustain is depends how they 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.650
 feel more comfortable is something very 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.540
 personal 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.600
 The first thing we are going to do is 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:14.030
 diagonal line of the middle of the eye towards 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.190
 outside depending on the inclination that 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:20.210
 give you thicker thinner is going to be the 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:23.120
 line then let's make another line 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:26.090
 from the bottom of the eye towards the 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:29.420
 eyebrow while further up or down we 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:32.270
 is going to give the shape of the tail we're going 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:36.630
 now to join the top part with the 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:40.500
 below and we started to fill 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.439
 and then in the inward part what 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.630
 we do the most to the tabs 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:48.119
 possible for it to be a thin line 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.009
 We flip the brush with the 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.920
 point out and we make strokes 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:55.710
 firm in the opposite direction this is for 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.259
 give thickness to the line while more 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:02.009
 firm and in a single stroke make it easier 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:07.590
 is going to be this is the secret and we fill 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:10.319
 well with the same brush molding the part 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.030
 outside of the tail and you can 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.160
 lengthen a little remember to put the 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.220
 hand as gently as possible so that the 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.290
 end of the tail is the most perfect 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.840
 then with the corrector of your preference 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.360
 and a brush that is flat and synthetic 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.160
 let's clean this area and that's what 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.750
 It makes the tail look super 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.750
 defined and clean 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.890
 good in our line is ready but 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:39.260
 if we want I can suggest you 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:42.530
 you can apply this that you put a black 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:45.500
 is a fully proof eyeliner 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:48.470
 water for example they went to parties if 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:51.319
 you sweat a lot or go to a climate 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.510
 hot I like to apply it in the part 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:56.390
 interior that is the most humid zone and in 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.730
 the part ends of the balls so that 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.980
 last me longer and perfect during all the 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.030
 day then with the same applicator that 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:09.000
 bring 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:13.410
 I'm going to put a little bit to when 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:16.920
 by criteria and a little bit in this 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:19.800
 part of the good crib we are ready 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.930
 well as you see me you can already go out with your 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.060
 perfect line for where they want and 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.310
 any occasion but I like it 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.989
 always how to add a different touch 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.900
 so that it is not like the same as always 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:33.510
 today I'm not going to place this which is a 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:36.660
 citrus neon color and I'll do it in 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:41.459
 key points in the inner part here of 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:43.830
 down and I'm going to make another line here at 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:47.300
 little side of the tail to give a 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.300
 touch as more fun 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.819
 and he put me in 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:10.970
 and also then placed and that you can 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:13.670
 do with the color that you like 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:18.459
 golden purple silver blue and gives 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:20.590
 a different touch and we are ready 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:22.360
 good those minutes for today I hope you've 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.400
 enjoyed this tutorial and now you 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.780
 you can apply all those eyeliners 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.669
 that are in trend 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.349
 remember to start this video subscribe 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:33.270
 and at the moment a comment that more 

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:33.270
 would make us see and see you 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:43.320
 it's called sites 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:45.150
 I put it with a little in the palm 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.630
 hand and pressed with the brush to 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.630
 to sink
