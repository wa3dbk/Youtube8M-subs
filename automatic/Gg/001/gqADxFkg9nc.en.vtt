and I'm going to show you how to install
an<00:00:43.710> orb<00:00:44.600> on<00:00:45.600> this<00:00:45.900> guitar<00:00:47.270> head<00:00:49.580> so

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:51.080 
an orb on this guitar head so

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.660 
an orb on this guitar head so
fortunately<00:00:52.080> I'm<00:00:52.800> working<00:00:53.130> on<00:00:53.220> this<00:00:53.340> guitar

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
fortunately I'm working on this guitar

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.100 
fortunately I'm working on this guitar
so<00:00:53.910> but<00:00:54.090> it<00:00:54.180> doesn't<00:00:54.450> have<00:00:54.570> any<00:00:54.720> strings<00:00:55.730> so<00:00:57.110> if

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:58.110 
so but it doesn't have any strings so if

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.180 
so but it doesn't have any strings so if
you<00:00:58.290> were<00:00:58.440> to<00:00:58.559> start<00:00:58.800> out<00:00:59.010> I<00:00:59.610> would<00:01:00.180> definitely

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
you were to start out I would definitely

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.810 
you were to start out I would definitely
D<00:01:02.190> tune<00:01:03.500> the<00:01:04.500> guitar<00:01:04.650> string<00:01:05.129> so<00:01:05.339> there's<00:01:05.640> no

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
D tune the guitar string so there's no

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.790 
D tune the guitar string so there's no
tension<00:01:06.210> on<00:01:06.660> the<00:01:07.230> string

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:07.800 
tension on the string

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.610 
tension on the string
we<00:01:08.700> don't<00:01:08.880> want<00:01:09.030> tension<00:01:09.180> because<00:01:09.720> then<00:01:10.500> it

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:10.620 
we don't want tension because then it

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.100 
we don't want tension because then it
pops<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.280> big<00:01:11.850> ear<00:01:12.060> out<00:01:12.090> it<00:01:12.690> makes<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:12.960> really

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
pops the big ear out it makes it really

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.260 
pops the big ear out it makes it really
difficult<00:01:13.380> for<00:01:13.680> installation<00:01:14.370> but<00:01:15.030> it's<00:01:15.150> no

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
difficult for installation but it's no

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.020 
difficult for installation but it's no
big<00:01:15.450> deal<00:01:15.630> you<00:01:15.870> just<00:01:16.010> detune<00:01:17.010> the<00:01:17.040> string<00:01:17.760> and

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
big deal you just detune the string and

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.110 
big deal you just detune the string and
that<00:01:18.120> solves<00:01:18.510> the<00:01:18.600> problem<00:01:19.020> right<00:01:19.320> there

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:20.120 
that solves the problem right there

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.240 
that solves the problem right there
so<00:01:21.120> again<00:01:21.420> we're<00:01:21.780> going<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:22.050> the<00:01:22.710> way<00:01:22.830> that<00:01:23.070> the

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
so again we're going to the way that the

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.970 
so again we're going to the way that the
the<00:01:23.940> orb<00:01:24.210> shows<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.380> I'm<00:01:25.440> going<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:25.620> show<00:01:25.830> the

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:25.980 
the orb shows and I'm going to show the

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.660 
the orb shows and I'm going to show the
sleeve<00:01:26.250> again<00:01:27.080> because<00:01:28.080> it's<00:01:28.470> it's<00:01:29.070> important

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
sleeve again because it's it's important

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.630 
sleeve again because it's it's important
just<00:01:29.760> to<00:01:30.060> just<00:01:30.659> see<00:01:30.870> it<00:01:31.050> and<00:01:32.040> sleeve<00:01:32.430> is

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
just to just see it and sleeve is

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:39.090 
just to just see it and sleeve is
basically<00:01:34.340> this<00:01:35.340> piece<00:01:35.610> of

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:44.630 

metal<00:01:40.000> right<00:01:40.150> here<00:01:40.210> with<00:01:41.020> a<00:01:41.049> hole<00:01:41.259> in<00:01:41.290> it<00:01:43.020> and

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
metal right here with a hole in it and

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.219 
metal right here with a hole in it and
it<00:01:45.640> slides<00:01:46.150> right<00:01:46.360> into<00:01:46.810> the<00:01:47.640> into<00:01:48.640> the<00:01:48.759> orb

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
it slides right into the into the orb

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.499 
it slides right into the into the orb
you<00:01:50.229> know<00:01:50.350> do<00:01:50.530> it<00:01:50.590> again

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
you know do it again

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.120 
you know do it again
so<00:01:52.509> what<00:01:52.810> we<00:01:52.899> do<00:01:53.080> is<00:01:53.229> we<00:01:53.350> have<00:01:53.560> on<00:01:53.740> a<00:01:53.770> little<00:01:53.890> orb

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
so what we do is we have on a little orb

00:01:54.130 --> 00:02:01.230 
so what we do is we have on a little orb
here<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:57.990> our<00:01:58.990> sleeve<00:01:59.440> whether<00:01:59.920> you<00:02:00.039> learn<00:02:00.240> we

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
here and our sleeve whether you learn we

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.690 
here and our sleeve whether you learn we
want<00:02:01.420> to<00:02:01.479> make<00:02:01.630> sure<00:02:01.659> that<00:02:01.899> it's<00:02:02.080> aligned<00:02:02.440> up

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
want to make sure that it's aligned up

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.160 
want to make sure that it's aligned up
with<00:02:03.700> the<00:02:04.539> allen<00:02:04.960> wrench<00:02:05.640> screw<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:07.840> Allen

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
with the allen wrench screw the Allen

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:15.120 
with the allen wrench screw the Allen
screw<00:02:08.470> I<00:02:09.030> can<00:02:10.030> show<00:02:10.239> that<00:02:10.420> you<00:02:10.630> see<00:02:13.110> and<00:02:14.110> it<00:02:14.950> has

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
screw I can show that you see and it has

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:20.750 
screw I can show that you see and it has
to<00:02:15.340> align<00:02:15.640> up<00:02:18.209> that

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
to align up that

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.640 
to align up that
I'll<00:02:21.760> just<00:02:21.940> hold<00:02:22.120> that<00:02:22.239> like<00:02:22.510> that<00:02:22.690> so<00:02:22.989> you<00:02:23.440> can

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
I'll just hold that like that so you can

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.520 
I'll just hold that like that so you can
see<00:02:24.629> and<00:02:25.629> it's<00:02:25.780> got<00:02:25.959> to<00:02:26.080> slip<00:02:26.290> inside<00:02:28.409> again<00:02:29.409> if

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
see and it's got to slip inside again if

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.649 
see and it's got to slip inside again if
it<00:02:29.650> doesn't<00:02:29.950> fit<00:02:30.069> totally<00:02:30.519> it<00:02:30.610> means<00:02:30.790> that<00:02:31.060> the

00:02:31.649 --> 00:02:31.659 
it doesn't fit totally it means that the

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:35.130 
it doesn't fit totally it means that the
Allen<00:02:32.200> screws<00:02:32.709> is<00:02:33.420> just<00:02:34.420> back<00:02:34.629> it<00:02:34.780> out<00:02:34.900> it'll

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
Allen screws is just back it out it'll

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.940 
Allen screws is just back it out it'll
drop<00:02:35.349> right<00:02:35.590> in<00:02:36.239> but<00:02:37.239> once<00:02:37.510> it's<00:02:37.720> once<00:02:38.470> it's<00:02:38.650> in

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
drop right in but once it's once it's in

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.070 
drop right in but once it's once it's in
there<00:02:39.280> I<00:02:39.430> just<00:02:40.030> tighten<00:02:40.299> it<00:02:40.360> up<00:02:40.450> just<00:02:40.900> a<00:02:41.049> little

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
there I just tighten it up just a little

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.740 
there I just tighten it up just a little
bit<00:02:41.410> so<00:02:41.590> that<00:02:41.620> it's<00:02:41.920> in<00:02:42.069> place<00:02:42.280> so<00:02:42.519> it<00:02:42.610> doesn't

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
bit so that it's in place so it doesn't

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.770 
bit so that it's in place so it doesn't
doesn't<00:02:43.750> come<00:02:43.840> out<00:02:43.930> so<00:02:44.650> it's<00:02:44.830> ready<00:02:45.519> to<00:02:45.580> be<00:02:45.780> put

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
doesn't come out so it's ready to be put

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.360 
doesn't come out so it's ready to be put
into<00:02:46.930> place<00:02:47.200> I<00:02:48.599> take<00:02:49.599> out<00:02:49.810> tension<00:02:50.379> off<00:02:50.769> of<00:02:50.829> the

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
into place I take out tension off of the

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.869 
into place I take out tension off of the
string<00:02:52.440> so<00:02:53.440> that<00:02:53.620> so<00:02:54.370> that<00:02:54.400> there's<00:02:54.730> no

00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:54.879 
string so that so that there's no

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:57.680 
string so that so that there's no
there's<00:02:55.690> no<00:02:55.810> tension<00:02:56.410> on<00:02:56.680> the<00:02:56.860> string<00:02:57.160> so<00:02:57.340> it's

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
there's no tension on the string so it's

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.530 
there's no tension on the string so it's
going<00:02:58.690> to<00:02:59.129> pop<00:03:00.129> the<00:03:00.400> biggie<00:03:01.060> rap<00:03:01.120> when<00:03:01.510> I

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
going to pop the biggie rap when I

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.599 
going to pop the biggie rap when I
remove<00:03:01.959> this<00:03:02.170> because<00:03:02.560> this<00:03:03.549> is

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:03.609 
remove this because this is

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:07.559 
remove this because this is
spring-loaded<00:03:04.890> and<00:03:05.890> it's<00:03:06.040> important<00:03:06.489> to<00:03:06.569> make

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 
spring-loaded and it's important to make

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:10.319 
spring-loaded and it's important to make
sure<00:03:08.280> you<00:03:09.280> do<00:03:09.459> relieve<00:03:09.760> the<00:03:09.849> tension<00:03:10.209> because

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:10.329 
sure you do relieve the tension because

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:13.650 
sure you do relieve the tension because
if<00:03:11.290> you<00:03:11.500> do<00:03:11.709> forget<00:03:12.129> what<00:03:12.970> could<00:03:13.180> happen<00:03:13.540> is

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
if you do forget what could happen is

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.089 
if you do forget what could happen is
that<00:03:13.690> the<00:03:14.530> washers<00:03:14.980> can<00:03:15.040> just<00:03:15.370> pop<00:03:15.819> out<00:03:17.099> you

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:18.099 
that the washers can just pop out you

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:21.900 
that the washers can just pop out you
just<00:03:18.160> go<00:03:18.250> pink<00:03:18.640> and<00:03:20.099> you<00:03:21.099> can<00:03:21.280> lose<00:03:21.459> them<00:03:21.609> but

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
just go pink and you can lose them but

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.900 
just go pink and you can lose them but
it's<00:03:22.030> important<00:03:22.480> to<00:03:22.660> keep<00:03:23.170> those<00:03:23.910> those

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
it's important to keep those those

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.849 
it's important to keep those those
washers<00:03:25.540> there's<00:03:26.079> two<00:03:26.349> washers<00:03:26.680> and<00:03:28.859> those

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:29.859 
washers there's two washers and those

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:32.490 
washers there's two washers and those
washers<00:03:30.340> are<00:03:30.519> important<00:03:31.090> to<00:03:32.019> make<00:03:32.139> sure<00:03:32.319> that

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
washers are important to make sure that

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.500 
washers are important to make sure that
the<00:03:32.650> system<00:03:33.010> works<00:03:33.190> okay<00:03:33.579> you<00:03:34.090> have<00:03:34.239> to<00:03:34.359> keep

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
the system works okay you have to keep

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.809 
the system works okay you have to keep
them<00:03:34.690> on<00:03:35.049> making<00:03:35.769> sure<00:03:35.799> that<00:03:36.069> they're<00:03:36.280> that

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 
like that and that's why we leave

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.400 
like that and that's why we leave
tension<00:04:45.460> so<00:04:45.670> that<00:04:45.700> it's<00:04:46.090> basically<00:04:46.840> very<00:04:46.930> easy

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
tension so that it's basically very easy

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:51.920 
tension so that it's basically very easy
for<00:04:47.650> us<00:04:47.800> to<00:04:47.920> be<00:04:48.820> able<00:04:48.910> to<00:04:49.180> move<00:04:49.540> that<00:04:50.430> alright<00:04:51.430> I

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
for us to be able to move that alright I

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:57.870 
for us to be able to move that alright I
usually<00:04:52.930> put<00:04:53.110> my<00:04:53.140> thumb<00:04:54.060> behind<00:04:55.060> there<00:04:56.880> push

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
usually put my thumb behind there push

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.110 
usually put my thumb behind there push
it<00:04:58.030> up<00:04:58.120> against<00:04:58.570> it

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
it up against it

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:05.330 
it up against it
with<00:05:00.570> this<00:05:00.720> in<00:05:00.900> place<00:05:02.090> now<00:05:03.090> I<00:05:03.150> simply<00:05:04.010> slip<00:05:05.010> the

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 
with this in place now I simply slip the

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.450 
with this in place now I simply slip the
orb<00:05:06.150> into<00:05:06.900> position<00:05:07.350> I<00:05:07.530> got<00:05:08.220> to<00:05:08.310> make<00:05:08.400> sure

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
orb into position I got to make sure

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.180 
orb into position I got to make sure
that<00:05:08.940> the<00:05:09.090> Allen<00:05:09.479> screw<00:05:09.810> is<00:05:10.199> facing<00:05:10.620> upward<00:05:11.010> so

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.190 
that the Allen screw is facing upward so

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:17.840 
that the Allen screw is facing upward so
I<00:05:11.220> can<00:05:11.460> access<00:05:11.880> it<00:05:15.199> and<00:05:16.199> now<00:05:16.410> of<00:05:16.770> course<00:05:16.850> the

I can access it and now of course the

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:20.900 
I can access it and now of course the
Allen<00:05:18.150> screws<00:05:18.479> too<00:05:19.110> far<00:05:19.410> down<00:05:19.680> I<00:05:20.100> just<00:05:20.639> bring

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:20.910 
Allen screws too far down I just bring

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:23.060 
Allen screws too far down I just bring
it<00:05:21.000> up<00:05:21.120> up<00:05:21.300> there<00:05:21.570> goes<00:05:21.810> that's<00:05:22.650> it
