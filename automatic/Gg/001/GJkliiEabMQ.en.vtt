00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.600

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
this is actually biggest car

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.070 
this is actually biggest car
yes<00:02:02.470> and<00:02:03.470> then<00:02:03.770> we<00:02:03.860> can<00:02:04.010> also<00:02:04.130> rotate<00:02:04.670> the

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 
yes and then we can also rotate the

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.150 
yes and then we can also rotate the
flood<00:02:06.080> to<00:02:06.200> the<00:02:06.260> other<00:02:06.470> side<00:02:06.710> so<00:02:06.860> we<00:02:06.950> can<00:02:06.980> do

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.160 
flood to the other side so we can do

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:28.140 
flood to the other side so we can do
both<00:02:07.370> at<00:02:07.550> the<00:02:07.580> same<00:02:07.670> time

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.820 

it's<00:02:29.150> got<00:02:29.300> a<00:02:29.330> helicopter<00:02:29.690> feature<00:02:30.050> where<00:02:30.379> two

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
it's got a helicopter feature where two

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.190 
it's got a helicopter feature where two
of<00:02:30.860> the<00:02:30.980> LEDs<00:02:31.489> as<00:02:31.819> they<00:02:32.299> rotate<00:02:32.750> are<00:02:32.959> always

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
of the LEDs as they rotate are always

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.420 
of the LEDs as they rotate are always
exposed<00:02:35.019> so<00:02:36.019> you<00:02:36.110> can<00:02:36.260> see<00:02:36.440> here<00:02:36.680> puts<00:02:37.220> light

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
exposed so you can see here puts light

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:44.320 
exposed so you can see here puts light
up<00:02:37.670> to<00:02:37.970> the<00:02:38.090> sky

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:58.790 

I<00:02:44.420> do<00:02:44.930> it

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.760
