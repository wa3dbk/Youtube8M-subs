works<00:00:53.850> out<00:00:54.059> so<00:00:54.840> that's<00:00:55.050> pretty<00:00:55.350> cool<00:00:55.590> I

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
works out so that's pretty cool I

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.610 
works out so that's pretty cool I
actually<00:00:56.180> created<00:00:57.180> this<00:00:57.570> look<00:00:57.840> with<00:00:58.170> colors

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
actually created this look with colors

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.610

from<00:00:58.890> all<00:00:59.160> over<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.789> spectrum<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.750> sort<00:01:01.559> of

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
from all over the spectrum to sort of

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:02.990 
from all over the spectrum to sort of
emulate<00:01:01.949> a<00:01:02.129> look<00:01:02.399> that<00:01:02.579> I've<00:01:02.699> been<00:01:02.789> wearing

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
emulate a look that I've been wearing

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.660 
emulate a look that I've been wearing
often<00:01:03.449> that<00:01:03.690> I've<00:01:03.809> gotten<00:01:04.110> requested<00:01:04.769> so<00:01:05.100> this

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
often that I've gotten requested so this
