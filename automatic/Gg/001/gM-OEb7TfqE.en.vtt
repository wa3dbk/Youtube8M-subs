00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:06.529
 instructions of the forgiving 

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:13.630
 offenses 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:13.630
 simeon bordeaux 1862 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:22.220
 How many times do you forgive my brother? 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:24.550
 forgive him ex not seven months but seventy 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:28.220
 times seven 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:31.069
 this is one of those teachings of Jesus that 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:35.690
 shut up in your intelligence and speak well 

00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:38.840
 let your hearts be compared to these 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:42.620
 merciful words with prayer 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:45.079
 so simple as summarized and at the same time 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:48.739
 time so great in their aspirations that they 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:51.969
 Jesus taught the symbols and I will find 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:56.300
 always the same thought 

00:00:51.969 --> 00:01:00.070
 jesus fair par excellence responds to 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:03.170
 pedro forgive the most without limits 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:07.250
 forgive each offense so many times 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:08.570
 as she sought to teach made 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.509
 your brothers 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:14.750
 that forgetfulness of oneself that 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:19.040
 renders invulnerable attacks on 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:22.399
 abuse and insults you will be sweet 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:25.729
 humble of heart never measuring 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:28.490
 lovers and you will do the 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:30.820
 others what you want the heavenly father 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:35.149
 do it for you 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:37.340
 does not he have to forgive you always and perhaps 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:40.630
 count the number of times your forgiveness 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:45.079
 come to pay your faults 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:49.720
 there was therefore this response from Jesus and how 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:49.720
 pedro would apply to yourselves 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:58.549
 forgive us our thirsty indulgence 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:01.580
 charitable generous and even lavish 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:05.750
 in your walnut tree 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:09.590
 hence why you will let you down 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:12.980
 may the Lord raise you up to humble you 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:19.190
 those that you are willing to accept your 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:21.410
 right and my love to study you in 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.230
 comment on these words that 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:27.350
 we drive from the one who from the top 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:30.980
 celestial splendors always have the 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.730
 eyes facing the voice and continues 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.299
 love 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.580
 the unpleasant task that began 18 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:40.069
 centuries 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:44.630
 therefore forgive your brethren as 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:49.400
 you need to be forgiven 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:52.040
 their acts because they personally harm 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:55.280
 that's one more reason to be 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:58.940
 developed because the merit of the 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:02.840
 forgiveness is proportional to the severity of the 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:06.260
 and there would be none to go through highs 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:10.040
 mistakes of your brothers if they are only 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:14.670
 because they bothered slightly 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:17.910
 spiritists do not listen to you 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:20.400
 both in words and deeds 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:25.019
 forgiveness of injuries should never 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:30.120
 reduce yourself to an empty cyrus expression 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:33.060
 16 spiritists served to forget the 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:37.140
 ill have done to us and to think 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:41.760
 only in one thing in the good that you can 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:45.720
 do the one who got in that way 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:49.799
 should not depart from it even in 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:53.420
 thought because those responsible for 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:57.750
 your thoughts that God knows and 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:04:00.420
 They do because they are devoid of 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:03.660
 any feelings of bitterness 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:05.690
 God knows what's in the background 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:09.150
 heart of each 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:13.079
 happy the one who can say every night 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:15.470
 To sleep I have nothing against my 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:15.470
 next
