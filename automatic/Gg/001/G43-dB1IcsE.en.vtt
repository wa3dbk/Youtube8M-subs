the<00:00:47.739> reason<00:00:48.129> is<00:00:48.340> mainly<00:00:48.879> the<00:00:49.180> brush<00:00:49.510> I<00:00:49.809> feel

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:50.080 
the reason is mainly the brush I feel

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.860 
the reason is mainly the brush I feel
like<00:00:50.170> it<00:00:50.290> is<00:00:50.320> the<00:00:50.440> least<00:00:51.270> user-friendly<00:00:52.270> the

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:52.870 
like it is the least user-friendly the

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.170 
like it is the least user-friendly the
big<00:00:53.230> front<00:00:53.500> part<00:00:53.860> is<00:00:54.070> okay<00:00:54.340> to<00:00:54.580> do<00:00:54.820> the<00:00:55.030> first

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.180 
big front part is okay to do the first

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.640 
big front part is okay to do the first
part<00:00:55.300> of<00:00:55.449> your<00:00:55.629> brow<00:00:55.780> especially<00:00:56.410> if<00:00:56.470> you<00:00:56.559> have

thicker brows personally and are pretty

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.119 
thicker brows personally and are pretty
thin<00:00:58.480> and<00:00:58.720> they<00:00:59.080> are<00:00:59.110> pretty<00:00:59.379> sparse<00:00:59.770> so<00:00:59.980> I

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:00.129 
thin and they are pretty sparse so I

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:01.439

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490

that<00:01:09.640> I<00:01:10.000> do<00:01:10.420> appreciate<00:01:10.780> that<00:01:11.020> there's<00:01:11.350> not

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
that I do appreciate that there's not

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.080 
that I do appreciate that there's not
too<00:01:11.710> much<00:01:11.830> product<00:01:12.250> on<00:01:12.310> the<00:01:12.520> one<00:01:12.700> per<00:01:12.909> se

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
too much product on the one per se

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:14.670 
too much product on the one per se
whenever<00:01:13.330> you<00:01:13.540> take<00:01:13.720> it<00:01:13.840> out<00:01:13.960> of<00:01:13.990> packaging

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.680 
whenever you take it out of packaging

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.580 
whenever you take it out of packaging
but<00:01:15.220> it<00:01:15.490> did<00:01:15.940> make<00:01:16.270> a<00:01:16.510> mess<00:01:16.780> quite<00:01:17.140> a<00:01:17.170> few<00:01:17.380> times

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
but it did make a mess quite a few times

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.620 
but it did make a mess quite a few times
not<00:01:17.890> today<00:01:18.280> actually<00:01:18.520> when<00:01:18.850> I<00:01:18.880> did<00:01:19.120> the<00:01:19.299> little

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
not today actually when I did the little

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.190 
not today actually when I did the little
clip<00:01:19.960> to<00:01:20.140> insert<00:01:21.060> it<00:01:22.060> was<00:01:22.240> like<00:01:22.479> neat<00:01:22.720> one<00:01:22.960> time

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
clip to insert it was like neat one time

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.680 
clip to insert it was like neat one time
that<00:01:23.409> I<00:01:23.470> didn't<00:01:23.830> do<00:01:23.950> it<00:01:24.159> obviously<00:01:24.850> right<00:01:24.880> it

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:25.690 
that I didn't do it obviously right it

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:26.940 
that I didn't do it obviously right it
was<00:01:25.840> fine<00:01:26.049> to<00:01:26.170> do<00:01:26.290> the<00:01:26.380> first<00:01:26.530> part<00:01:26.650> of<00:01:26.830> my

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
was fine to do the first part of my

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.010 
was fine to do the first part of my
brows<00:01:27.220> but<00:01:27.430> as<00:01:27.549> soon<00:01:27.729> as<00:01:27.790> I<00:01:27.909> go<00:01:28.060> toward<00:01:28.570> my<00:01:28.630> tip

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
brows but as soon as I go toward my tip

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.109 
brows but as soon as I go toward my tip
I<00:01:29.260> couldn't<00:01:29.830> do<00:01:29.920> it<00:01:30.040> because<00:01:30.220> it<00:01:30.820> would<00:01:30.940> always

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119 
I couldn't do it because it would always

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:33.120 
I couldn't do it because it would always
touch<00:01:31.450> my<00:01:31.630> skin<00:01:31.869> and<00:01:32.140> there's<00:01:32.680> not<00:01:32.860> as<00:01:32.980> much

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
touch my skin and there's not as much

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.220 
touch my skin and there's not as much
hair<00:01:33.460> so<00:01:33.760> it<00:01:33.880> was<00:01:34.000> really<00:01:34.180> hard<00:01:34.480> to<00:01:34.540> just<00:01:34.840> focus

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:35.230 
hair so it was really hard to just focus

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:37.140 
hair so it was really hard to just focus
it<00:01:35.350> on<00:01:35.500> one<00:01:35.710> place<00:01:36.010> I<00:01:36.280> have<00:01:36.790> to<00:01:36.910> say<00:01:37.030> I<00:01:37.090> don't

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.150 
it on one place I have to say I don't

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.090 
it on one place I have to say I don't
even<00:01:37.270> know<00:01:37.540> why<00:01:37.690> they<00:01:37.720> bother<00:01:38.080> doing<00:01:38.680> this<00:01:38.860> low

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
even know why they bother doing this low

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.740 
even know why they bother doing this low
part<00:01:39.400> of<00:01:39.430> the<00:01:39.490> end<00:01:39.760> because<00:01:40.150> there's

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
part of the end because there's

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.600 
part of the end because there's
personally<00:01:41.200> no<00:01:41.410> way<00:01:41.560> I<00:01:41.590> can<00:01:41.860> even<00:01:42.130> use<00:01:42.310> it<00:01:42.340> even

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
personally no way I can even use it even

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.430 
personally no way I can even use it even
in<00:01:42.820> like<00:01:42.970> no<00:01:43.180> matter<00:01:43.300> what<00:01:43.570> angle<00:01:43.780> I<00:01:44.050> put<00:01:44.260> it<00:01:44.350> in

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:44.440 
in like no matter what angle I put it in

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.620 
in like no matter what angle I put it in
there's<00:01:45.100> no<00:01:45.280> way<00:01:45.430> I<00:01:45.460> can<00:01:45.670> touch<00:01:46.150> the<00:01:46.420> brows

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
there's no way I can touch the brows

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.810 
there's no way I can touch the brows
without<00:01:47.020> making<00:01:47.380> a<00:01:47.440> mess<00:01:47.650> everywhere<00:01:48.190> instead

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
without making a mess everywhere instead

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.670 
without making a mess everywhere instead
I<00:01:48.850> would<00:01:48.940> suggest<00:01:49.180> to<00:01:49.540> do<00:01:49.720> a<00:01:49.750> little<00:01:50.110> cone<00:01:50.410> one

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
I would suggest to do a little cone one

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.380 
I would suggest to do a little cone one
that<00:01:50.950> way<00:01:51.130> it<00:01:51.250> would<00:01:51.370> be<00:01:51.490> so<00:01:51.700> much<00:01:51.820> easier<00:01:51.850> to

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
that way it would be so much easier to

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.180 
that way it would be so much easier to
just<00:01:52.600> do<00:01:52.810> it<00:01:52.930> everywhere<00:01:53.350> you<00:01:53.560> want<00:01:53.770> and<00:01:54.040> not

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:54.190 
just do it everywhere you want and not

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:55.950 
just do it everywhere you want and not
touch<00:01:54.400> any<00:01:54.670> where<00:01:54.850> the<00:01:55.000> skin<00:01:55.270> or<00:01:55.420> other<00:01:55.510> airs

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
touch any where the skin or other airs

00:01:58.470 --> 00:01:58.480 
on your face the color per se was not

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.180 
on your face the color per se was not
the<00:01:58.630> best<00:01:58.780> but<00:01:59.080> again<00:01:59.320> this<00:01:59.680> one<00:01:59.890> is<00:02:00.010> right

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:00.190 
the best but again this one is right

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:01.860 
the best but again this one is right

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
because this one contains little fibers

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.160 
because this one contains little fibers
in<00:04:45.890> it<00:04:46.010> which<00:04:46.610> obviously<00:04:46.820> is<00:04:47.510> going<00:04:47.900> to<00:04:48.050> make

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:48.170 
in it which obviously is going to make

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:49.960 
in it which obviously is going to make
your<00:04:48.380> brows<00:04:48.560> look<00:04:48.950> fuller<00:04:49.220> but<00:04:49.520> personally

your brows look fuller but personally

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:51.910 
your brows look fuller but personally
because<00:04:50.390> of<00:04:50.420> that<00:04:50.630> it<00:04:50.840> makes<00:04:50.870> it<00:04:51.230> more<00:04:51.500> useful

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:51.920 
because of that it makes it more useful

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.260 
because of that it makes it more useful
to<00:04:52.070> me<00:04:52.100> and<00:04:52.340> more<00:04:52.460> quick<00:04:52.760> in<00:04:52.880> the<00:04:52.940> morning

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
to me and more quick in the morning

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.240

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.790 
because if I went to use the next one
and<00:04:55.460> I<00:04:55.580> felt<00:04:56.450> like<00:04:56.540> ah<00:04:56.750> the<00:04:57.140> end<00:04:57.290> part<00:04:57.530> still
