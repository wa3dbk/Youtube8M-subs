I<00:00:01.190> am<00:00:02.190> NOT<00:00:02.399> a<00:00:02.429> big<00:00:02.760> fan<00:00:02.790> of<00:00:03.120> adding<00:00:03.750> a<00:00:03.870> weight<00:00:04.080> to

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
I am NOT a big fan of adding a weight to

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:06.440 
I am NOT a big fan of adding a weight to
the<00:00:04.470> baseball<00:00:04.890> bat<00:00:05.130> for<00:00:05.190> the<00:00:05.879> common<00:00:06.240> use<00:00:06.420> of

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
the baseball bat for the common use of

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.259 
the baseball bat for the common use of

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
swinging the bat this added weight tends

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:10.940 
swinging the bat this added weight tends
to<00:00:09.540> drag<00:00:09.809> the<00:00:09.990> barrel<00:00:10.320> of<00:00:10.380> the<00:00:10.500> bat<00:00:10.530> through

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
to drag the barrel of the bat through

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.490 
to drag the barrel of the bat through
the<00:00:11.070> hitting<00:00:11.250> zone<00:00:11.570> causing<00:00:12.570> an<00:00:12.690> uppercut<00:00:13.230> for

the bat is held in position the better
for<00:01:20.610> building<00:01:21.000> sustained<00:01:21.780> strength<00:01:22.520> players

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
for building sustained strength players

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.670 
for building sustained strength players
should<00:01:23.790> begin<00:01:24.090> by<00:01:24.299> choking<00:01:24.570> up<00:01:24.900> on<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.110> bat<00:01:25.229> to

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
should begin by choking up on the bat to

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.050 
should begin by choking up on the bat to
where<00:01:25.830> they<00:01:25.979> can<00:01:26.040> perform<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.759> drills

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
where they can perform the drills

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.719 
where they can perform the drills
correctly<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:27.979> gradually<00:01:28.979> move<00:01:29.220> towards<00:01:29.610> the

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
correctly and gradually move towards the

correctly and gradually move towards the
knob<00:01:29.939> of<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.150> bat<00:01:30.240> as<00:01:30.659> they<00:01:30.930> gain<00:01:31.170> strength<00:01:31.590> of

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:31.939 
knob of the bat as they gain strength of

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:34.969 
knob of the bat as they gain strength of
course<00:01:32.939> young<00:01:33.630> players<00:01:33.930> can<00:01:34.259> begin<00:01:34.650> these

course young players can begin these

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.520 
course young players can begin these
without<00:01:35.549> an<00:01:35.759> added<00:01:36.090> wait<00:01:36.329> until<00:01:37.170> they<00:01:37.320> gain

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
without an added wait until they gain

important of course is that players work

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.190 
important of course is that players work
to<00:01:46.950> strengthen<00:01:47.220> each<00:01:47.820> hand<00:01:48.180> because<00:01:48.930> it<00:01:49.110> is
