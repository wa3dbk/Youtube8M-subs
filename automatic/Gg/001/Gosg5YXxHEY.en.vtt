00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.619
 friendly friends very good afternoon days 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:22.939
 nights wherever you are sure that 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:25.970
 good guess today I'm going to make a cake 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:28.070
 homemade apple a classic cake 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.170
 all my life but good that I do not have in 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:33.440
 my recipe book and somehow I had you 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:34.910
 that I had to put it then I'm going to 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:39.019
 make a cake that is a little 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:41.660
 dense to which I will add a series 

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:43.879
 of an ingredient that is cinnamon that 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.649
 I do not usually use it 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:47.840
 biscuits but in this if it goes 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:50.239
 perfectly because the apple I want 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:54.020
 give us a memory of the apple 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:56.650
 roasted with cinnamon and then I would go back or go 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:59.290
 to explain how the process will be 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:02.320
 first I'm going to beat the egg whites 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:03.820
 separately and I went to raise a 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.180
 little need not be merengue a 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:10.240
 Meringue with a pinch of salt and half 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.370
 of sugar approximately the yolks 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:16.960
 I will do the stir and set aside with the other 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:19.000
 half of the sugar and I will add the oil 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:22.270
 and the flour 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.660
 after the girl's I already have the 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:28.840
 chemical yeast powder or as you call 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:31.270
 in america baking powders and a 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.370
 cinnamon granite what is a 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.950
 teaspoon of coffee size of the 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:38.320
 little ones, it's a little touch 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.660
 careers a subtle credit point and 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.490
 then I'm going to appeal the apples 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.229
 cut them the Shiites as if they were 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.540
 for the classic apple pie but in 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:49.530
 place to put you over I'm going to 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:53.170
 stick in the dough so that they are going to 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.540
 sink into the sponge cake and then 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.910
 we are going to find the roasted manzanita 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:01.090
 with cinnamon flavor inside the sponge cake 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:03.700
 Well, the order is going to be that I'm going to 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.470
 do the whites on the one hand because this 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:09.090
 you are going to see it in a fast camera and on the other 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:11.560
 the yolks with the sugar with the oil 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.170
 I finally add life and then to 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.810
 all this I put the flat of 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:20.590
 moving it gently so that it is not 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:23.019
 lower the oven base to 175 degrees with the 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.240
 fire up below and well then up 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:27.030
 what antler 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.130
 which can be 35-40 minutes or 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.440
 depending on the furnaces a little bit more 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.150
 or a little less you already know that for 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.620
 that's the old needle trick for 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.620
 click and not fail 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:32.150
 good and now 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:35.769
 I just put it clearly 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.769
 let's take advantage of them all 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:43.400
 and I'm going to beat it like that with the spoon what 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:47.160
 I'm going to mix more than beating and mixing 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:50.520
 because it 's because that's not how it goes down 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:52.860
 loses all the air the merengue 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.840
 clear voted as the one who always calls 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:58.890
 you will lose something because whenever you 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:01.220
 manipulates is always lost but we're going to 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:03.480
 try to be the least possible 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:06.080
 Well now I only have left 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.080
 mix this 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:11.230
 and then invest it in the mold and 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:13.629
 place it in the apple that I already have 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:16.150
 here ready to cut and leaving 

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:20.109
 a few minutes and I go back 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:22.060
 good good good let's see how 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:24.430
 you can see I already have the mountain is a 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.180
 little jar of butter and now I'm going to 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.850
 put here 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:31.090
 well what corresponds to it is no more 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:31.090
 No less 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.419
 that the preparation for sponge cake 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:45.580
 how rich are you that right way is going to 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.580
 extend the horror as to the mental 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.870
 the other cinnamon does not have another person 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:53.480
 It will but what is human 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:56.420
 a fantastic aroma 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:05:00.080
 here that one likes simply to hear 

00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:02.810
 the good name let's see now we see 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:05.210
 the pieces of apple by the cloves 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:07.740
 down 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:09.900
 this is 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:12.400
 is not to put it on but nail it 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:16.169
 inside the cake 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.169
 As you can see they are a little thick 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:24.000
 he does not want to enter is that you touch 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.000
 let's go to work 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:30.400
 well this is a little bit to taste if you 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:33.139
 you like it more you put it more if you like less 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:36.120
 put less this already 

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:38.520
 I leave it to your choice since 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:41.220
 It will depend on if you like it more than you have 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:43.979
 more fruit or less inside the beatbox a 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:46.979
 I like the meetings I like to go to 

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:49.660
 fruits edit already good because it is one of my 

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:53.110
 of my vices 

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:55.950
 For more advanced Araya peace takes 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:58.689
 the palm well as well I'm putting 

00:05:55.950 --> 00:06:00.339
 good enough 

00:05:58.689 --> 00:06:02.349
 This is not grade I 'm not going to 

00:06:00.339 --> 00:06:04.629
 put because this is going away that is going to 

00:06:02.349 --> 00:06:07.830
 do inside and if I put delgadito 

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:10.470
 delgadito well as it's going 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:12.410
 is going to do too well for these 

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:14.760
 those that have been loved me is not that 

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:17.190
 this is that I was so eager to get there 

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:18.729
 to the cake I said I got myself 

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:20.050
 head 

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:22.949
 good 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:22.949
 Well, I think 

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:31.780
 These are then to be removed 

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:36.690
 machines 

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:40.150
 style is the thing to throw like that 

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:42.340
 for himself 

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:44.169
 it will also go 

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:47.480
 really because add a little bit of 

00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:50.650
 sugar above the apple 

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:50.650
 you'll see how easy 

00:06:53.030 --> 00:07:00.490
 I take the sugar bowl and as if it were salt 

00:06:55.540 --> 00:07:00.490
 well a little above without more 

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:06.689
 for the floor thing ja a little bit of 

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:13.289
 water and manzanita 

00:07:06.689 --> 00:07:15.599
 Well now I 35 40 minutes is 

00:07:13.289 --> 00:07:17.070
 that I think it will cost and we'll see 

00:07:15.599 --> 00:07:19.500
 then 

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:22.190
 Well, we have the result here 

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:25.980
 end of this homemade apple pie 

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:29.820
 with a touch of cinnamon that is more than 

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:33.270
 I've already tried it and well anyway 

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:35.070
 this is my downfall and this is for 

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:38.250
 get lost look I'll bring you the plane 

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:40.530
 little by little so you can see the fluffy 

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:42.770
 which is at the touch of apple that 

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:46.650
 see there is a small corner is spectacular 

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:48.960
