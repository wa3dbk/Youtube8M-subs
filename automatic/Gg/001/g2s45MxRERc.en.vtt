with<00:04:06.080> Frank<00:04:06.349> Vogel<00:04:06.769> I<00:04:06.950> think<00:04:07.459> the<00:04:07.549> biggest

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
with Frank Vogel I think the biggest

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.789 
with Frank Vogel I think the biggest
thing<00:04:07.940> is<00:04:08.299> i<00:04:08.569> can<00:04:08.780> tell<00:04:09.019> guys<00:04:09.410> on<00:04:09.650> our<00:04:09.769> team

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:09.799 
thing is i can tell guys on our team

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:12.009 
thing is i can tell guys on our team
because<00:04:10.280> we<00:04:10.730> don't<00:04:11.000> have<00:04:11.060> anybody<00:04:11.360> that's<00:04:11.780> won

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:12.019 
because we don't have anybody that's won

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:14.770 
because we don't have anybody that's won
championships<00:04:13.030> other<00:04:14.030> than<00:04:14.239> our<00:04:14.390> other

want to do things at game speed I can

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:30.370 
want to do things at game speed I can
let<00:04:28.760> them<00:04:28.940> know<00:04:29.090> that<00:04:29.300> I<00:04:29.330> saw<00:04:29.600> the<00:04:29.660> best<00:04:29.930> do<00:04:30.199> it

let them know that I saw the best do it

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.879 
let them know that I saw the best do it
and<00:04:31.220> the<00:04:31.940> best<00:04:32.180> also<00:04:32.690> worked<00:04:32.960> the<00:04:33.080> hardest<00:04:33.229> and

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:33.889 
and the best also worked the hardest and

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:36.189 
and the best also worked the hardest and
if<00:04:34.610> you're<00:04:34.789> not<00:04:34.910> going<00:04:35.090> to<00:04:35.150> at<00:04:35.449> least<00:04:35.600> work<00:04:35.900> as

00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:36.199 
if you're not going to at least work as

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:38.080 
if you're not going to at least work as
hard<00:04:36.350> as<00:04:36.500> you<00:04:36.620> can<00:04:36.800> you<00:04:37.220> have<00:04:37.370> no<00:04:37.550> chance<00:04:37.789> and

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
hard as you can you have no chance and

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.000 
hard as you can you have no chance and
they<00:04:38.150> have<00:04:38.300> to<00:04:38.500> accept<00:04:39.500> they<00:04:39.560> have<00:04:39.680> to<00:04:39.800> believe

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.010 
they have to accept they have to believe

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:41.890 
they have to accept they have to believe
that<00:04:40.070> because<00:04:40.460> I've<00:04:40.970> seen<00:04:41.300> them<00:04:41.419> they<00:04:41.539> have<00:04:41.720> it

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900 
that because I've seen them they have it

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.110 
that because I've seen them they have it
I<00:04:42.169> think<00:04:42.680> it<00:04:42.800> indicates<00:04:43.070> obviously<00:04:43.820> thing<00:04:43.970> you

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 
I think it indicates obviously thing you

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.659 
I think it indicates obviously thing you
want<00:04:44.600> to<00:04:44.720> make<00:04:45.440> a<00:04:45.470> point<00:04:45.800> to<00:04:45.979> recount<00:04:46.400> some
