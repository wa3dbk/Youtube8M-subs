you<00:00:34.500> know<00:00:34.620> have<00:00:35.160> that<00:00:35.190> mega<00:00:35.550> evolution<00:00:36.030> just

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
you know have that mega evolution just

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.490 
you know have that mega evolution just
in<00:00:36.329> case<00:00:36.480> they<00:00:36.600> try<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:36.840> cancel<00:00:37.079> out<00:00:37.320> your

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
in case they try to cancel out your

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.720 
in case they try to cancel out your
weather<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:38.120> on<00:00:39.120> top<00:00:39.360> of<00:00:39.390> that<00:00:39.620> you<00:00:40.620> just

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
weather and on top of that you just

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.940 
weather and on top of that you just
really<00:00:41.809> bring<00:00:42.809> in<00:00:42.960> Tyranitar<00:00:43.440> just<00:00:43.680> for<00:00:43.829> that

really bring in Tyranitar just for that
sand<00:00:44.250> stream<00:00:44.550> it<00:00:45.239> doesn't<00:00:45.600> really<00:00:45.780> matter

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
sand stream it doesn't really matter

that<00:00:50.940> way<00:00:51.059> you<00:00:51.120> can<00:00:51.300> conserve<00:00:51.690> turns<00:00:52.020> on<00:00:52.230> your

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
that way you can conserve turns on your

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.029 
that way you can conserve turns on your
sandstorm

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
sandstorm

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.130 
sandstorm
now<00:00:53.550> that<00:00:53.760> sandstorm<00:00:54.210> only<00:00:54.420> has<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.600> 5<00:00:54.899> turn

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
now that sandstorm only has a 5 turn

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.470 
now that sandstorm only has a 5 turn
limit<00:00:55.530> when<00:00:55.829> brought<00:00:56.460> in<00:00:56.640> on<00:00:56.789> a<00:00:56.820> Pokemon<00:00:57.300> that

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
limit when brought in on a Pokemon that

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.240 
limit when brought in on a Pokemon that
has<00:00:57.690> an<00:00:57.930> ability<00:00:59.030> you<00:01:00.030> really<00:01:00.539> just<00:01:01.050> want<00:01:02.039> to

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
has an ability you really just want to

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.520 
has an ability you really just want to
get<00:01:02.550> as<00:01:02.730> many<00:01:02.879> turns<00:01:03.180> possible<00:01:03.629> with<00:01:03.840> a<00:01:04.049> Ron<00:01:04.260> so

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
get as many turns possible with a Ron so

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.620 
get as many turns possible with a Ron so
the<00:01:04.949> strategy<00:01:05.309> isn't<00:01:05.670> as<00:01:05.729> strong<00:01:05.909> as<00:01:05.970> it<00:01:06.180> was

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
the strategy isn't as strong as it was

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.080 
the strategy isn't as strong as it was
in<00:01:06.840> fiction<00:01:07.229> but<00:01:07.680> still<00:01:07.950> just<00:01:08.250> dominates<00:01:08.880> and

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
in fiction but still just dominates and

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.660 
in fiction but still just dominates and
devastates<00:01:09.720> in<00:01:09.990> singles<00:01:10.530> so<00:01:11.340> let's<00:01:11.490> watch
