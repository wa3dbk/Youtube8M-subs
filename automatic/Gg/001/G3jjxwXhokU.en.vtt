00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
I've been getting lots of questions

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.140 
I've been getting lots of questions
lately<00:00:08.570> so<00:00:09.570> one<00:00:09.840> of<00:00:09.960> them<00:00:10.170> is<00:00:10.500> how<00:00:11.429> long<00:00:11.820> does

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
lately so one of them is how long does

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.650 
lately so one of them is how long does
HCG<00:00:12.929> last<00:00:13.259> and<00:00:13.969> there's<00:00:14.969> there's<00:00:15.240> kind<00:00:15.509> of<00:00:15.570> two

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
HCG last and there's there's kind of two

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.150 
HCG last and there's there's kind of two
answers<00:00:16.020> for<00:00:16.529> that<00:00:17.359> basically<00:00:18.359> when<00:00:19.080> this<00:00:20.010> is

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
answers for that basically when this is

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.710 
answers for that basically when this is
for<00:00:20.369> RX<00:00:20.699> HCG<00:00:21.600> by<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.810> way<00:00:22.460> if<00:00:23.460> you<00:00:23.670> buy<00:00:23.699> rx<00:00:24.390> or

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
for RX HCG by the way if you buy rx or

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.349 
for RX HCG by the way if you buy rx or
prescription<00:00:25.289> HCG<00:00:25.980> and<00:00:26.279> it's<00:00:26.760> in<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.090> powder

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
prescription HCG and it's in the powder

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:28.640 
prescription HCG and it's in the powder
form

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
form

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.589 
form
there<00:00:29.070> will<00:00:29.220> be<00:00:29.250> an<00:00:29.429> expiration<00:00:29.789> date<00:00:30.330> on<00:00:30.510> the

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
there will be an expiration date on the

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.680 
there will be an expiration date on the
box<00:00:31.019> or<00:00:31.439> on<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.619> bottle<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.399> that<00:00:33.239> is<00:00:33.450> gonna

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
box or on the bottle and that is gonna

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.900 
box or on the bottle and that is gonna
be<00:00:33.930> most<00:00:34.170> likely<00:00:34.410> anywhere<00:00:35.010> from<00:00:35.219> like<00:00:35.399> one<00:00:35.700> to

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
be most likely anywhere from like one to

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.470 
be most likely anywhere from like one to
two<00:00:36.120> years<00:00:36.510> before<00:00:37.230> it<00:00:37.559> expires<00:00:38.010> um<00:00:38.550> so<00:00:39.360> when

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
two years before it expires um so when

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.600 
two years before it expires um so when
it's<00:00:39.600> unmixed<00:00:40.110> like<00:00:40.350> that<00:00:40.620> it<00:00:40.920> will<00:00:41.129> last<00:00:41.309> you

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
it's unmixed like that it will last you

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.580 
it's unmixed like that it will last you
quite<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:41.969> long<00:00:42.239> time<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:42.870> that's<00:00:43.200> why<00:00:43.410> it's

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
quite a long time and that's why it's

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.680 
quite a long time and that's why it's
kind<00:00:43.860> of<00:00:43.920> nice<00:00:44.040> you<00:00:44.070> can<00:00:44.430> you<00:00:44.910> know<00:00:45.030> buy<00:00:45.360> it<00:00:45.420> in

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
kind of nice you can you know buy it in

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.500 
kind of nice you can you know buy it in
bulk<00:00:46.100> to<00:00:47.100> last<00:00:47.309> you<00:00:47.489> for<00:00:47.700> a<00:00:47.760> while<00:00:47.910> sometimes

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
bulk to last you for a while sometimes

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.060 
bulk to last you for a while sometimes
the<00:00:48.870> shipping<00:00:49.260> can<00:00:49.469> be<00:00:49.500> a<00:00:49.620> little<00:00:49.860> expensive

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
the shipping can be a little expensive

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.029 
the shipping can be a little expensive
coming<00:00:50.760> from<00:00:50.850> overseas<00:00:51.320> so<00:00:52.320> when<00:00:52.710> you<00:00:52.829> buy<00:00:52.980> it

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
coming from overseas so when you buy it

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.549 
coming from overseas so when you buy it
like<00:00:53.309> that<00:00:53.550> from<00:00:53.940> overseas<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.660> it's<00:00:54.780> unmixed

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
like that from overseas and it's unmixed

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.950 
like that from overseas and it's unmixed
it<00:00:56.280> will<00:00:56.520> definitely<00:00:57.059> last<00:00:57.210> you<00:00:57.480> at<00:00:57.600> least<00:00:57.809> a

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
it will definitely last you at least a

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.229 
it will definitely last you at least a
year<00:00:58.199> if<00:00:58.410> not<00:00:58.440> two<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:59.160> know<00:00:59.250> depending<00:00:59.730> on<00:00:59.910> on

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
year if not two you know depending on on

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.330 
year if not two you know depending on on
when<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.629> lab<00:01:00.809> made<00:01:01.109> it<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.500> you<00:01:02.010> can<00:01:02.160> just

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
when the lab made it and you can just

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.770 
when the lab made it and you can just
look<00:01:02.460> at<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.699> expiration<00:01:03.059> date<00:01:03.390> on<00:01:03.660> the

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
look at the expiration date on the

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.429 
look at the expiration date on the
bottle<00:01:04.220> so<00:01:05.299> and<00:01:06.299> you<00:01:06.750> know<00:01:06.810> it's<00:01:07.200> possible

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
bottle so and you know it's possible

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.950 
bottle so and you know it's possible
that<00:01:08.159> even<00:01:08.220> once<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.939> expiration<00:01:09.360> date<00:01:09.630> has

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
that even once the expiration date has

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.570 
that even once the expiration date has
come<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.320> gone<00:01:10.350> on<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.710> bottle<00:01:11.010> that<00:01:11.040> you<00:01:11.369> may

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
come and gone on the bottle that you may

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.130 
come and gone on the bottle that you may
be<00:01:11.640> able<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:11.970> use<00:01:12.210> it<00:01:12.360> a<00:01:12.420> little<00:01:12.540> longer<00:01:12.750> after

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
be able to use it a little longer after

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.830 
be able to use it a little longer after
that<00:01:13.290> I'm<00:01:13.650> assuming<00:01:14.040> that<00:01:14.600> they're<00:01:15.600> not

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
that I'm assuming that they're not

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.649 
that I'm assuming that they're not
putting<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.470> very<00:01:16.799> last<00:01:17.189> viable<00:01:18.030> date<00:01:18.299> on

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
putting the very last viable date on

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.420 
putting the very last viable date on
that<00:01:18.960> bottle<00:01:19.350> because<00:01:19.799> then<00:01:20.040> they<00:01:20.159> would<00:01:20.280> be

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
that bottle because then they would be

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.280 
that bottle because then they would be
kind<00:01:20.640> of<00:01:20.729> risking<00:01:21.119> some<00:01:21.450> bottles<00:01:21.780> going<00:01:22.110> bad

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
kind of risking some bottles going bad

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.710 
kind of risking some bottles going bad
early<00:01:22.710> so<00:01:23.430> you<00:01:23.520> probably<00:01:24.030> could<00:01:24.240> even<00:01:24.390> push

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
early so you probably could even push

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.710 
early so you probably could even push
that<00:01:24.900> date<00:01:25.140> off<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.290> little<00:01:25.680> further<00:01:26.720> but

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
that date off a little further but

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.100 
that date off a little further but
anyway<00:01:28.080> so<00:01:28.140> that's<00:01:28.530> that<00:01:29.150> now<00:01:30.150> once<00:01:30.689> it<00:01:30.840> comes

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
anyway so that's that now once it comes

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.399 
anyway so that's that now once it comes
to<00:01:31.520> HCG<00:01:32.520> that<00:01:32.729> is<00:01:32.820> already<00:01:33.210> mixed<00:01:33.600> when<00:01:34.320> you

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
to HCG that is already mixed when you

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.899 
to HCG that is already mixed when you
receive<00:01:34.770> it<00:01:34.799> in<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.009> mail<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.549> then<00:01:35.670> you<00:01:35.759> and

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
receive it in the mail and then you and

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.840 
receive it in the mail and then you and
then<00:01:35.970> you<00:01:36.060> mix<00:01:36.390> your<00:01:36.780> RX<00:01:37.200> HCG<00:01:37.799> yourself<00:01:38.430> um

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
then you mix your RX HCG yourself um

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.600 
then you mix your RX HCG yourself um
generally<00:01:41.850> it<00:01:42.119> seems<00:01:42.180> to<00:01:42.869> be<00:01:43.079> that<00:01:43.680> like<00:01:44.159> say<00:01:44.579> a

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
generally it seems to be that like say a

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.630 
generally it seems to be that like say a
5,000<00:01:45.540> IU<00:01:45.780> vial<00:01:46.290> that<00:01:46.439> you<00:01:46.799> mix<00:01:47.100> which<00:01:47.369> is<00:01:47.490> what

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
5,000 IU vial that you mix which is what

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.219 
5,000 IU vial that you mix which is what
most<00:01:47.790> people<00:01:47.909> mix<00:01:50.420> usually<00:01:51.420> will<00:01:51.600> last<00:01:51.630> you

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
most people mix usually will last you

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.639 
most people mix usually will last you
around<00:01:52.829> three<00:01:53.579> weeks<00:01:53.850> as<00:01:54.270> far<00:01:54.899> as<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.170> potency

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
around three weeks as far as the potency

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.160 
around three weeks as far as the potency
goes<00:01:56.360> so<00:01:57.360> if<00:01:57.450> you're<00:01:57.600> doing<00:01:57.869> you<00:01:58.049> know<00:01:58.140> a

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
goes so if you're doing you know a

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.950 
goes so if you're doing you know a

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
six-week around a 40 42 day round you'll

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.230 
six-week around a 40 42 day round you'll
usually<00:02:01.229> need<00:02:01.649> to<00:02:01.829> mix<00:02:02.100> twice<00:02:02.549> if<00:02:03.060> you're

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
using 5000 IU vials and that's because

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.809 
using 5000 IU vials and that's because
even<00:02:06.630> if<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:07.049> first<00:02:07.259> 5,000<00:02:08.250> IU

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
even if the first 5,000 IU

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.470 
even if the first 5,000 IU
you<00:02:08.999> mixed<00:02:09.359> even<00:02:09.599> if<00:02:09.719> you<00:02:09.840> have<00:02:10.079> some<00:02:10.469> HCG<00:02:11.069> left

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.280 
you mixed even if you have some HCG left
after<00:02:12.480> that<00:02:12.629> three<00:02:12.900> weeks

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
after that three weeks

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.949 
after that three weeks
oftentimes<00:02:14.219> the<00:02:14.879> potency<00:02:15.329> has<00:02:15.389> dropped<00:02:15.719> off

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
oftentimes the potency has dropped off

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.069 
oftentimes the potency has dropped off
so<00:02:16.260> much<00:02:16.609> that<00:02:17.609> it's<00:02:17.969> no<00:02:18.239> longer<00:02:18.450> doing<00:02:18.959> what

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:19.079 
so much that it's no longer doing what

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:22.129 
so much that it's no longer doing what
it<00:02:19.170> needs<00:02:19.200> to<00:02:19.530> do<00:02:19.650> in<00:02:19.799> your<00:02:19.889> body<00:02:20.159> um<00:02:21.139> however

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
the possible causes so that you can kind

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.689 
the possible causes so that you can kind
of<00:03:51.239> nip<00:03:51.359> it<00:03:51.479> in<00:03:51.569> the<00:03:51.629> bud<00:03:51.900> and<00:03:52.430> you<00:03:53.430> know<00:03:53.519> and<00:03:53.639> do

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:53.699 
of nip it in the bud and you know and do

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:55.129 
of nip it in the bud and you know and do
whatever<00:03:53.879> you<00:03:54.030> need<00:03:54.180> to<00:03:54.299> do<00:03:54.509> so<00:03:54.870> because<00:03:54.959> you

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:55.139 
whatever you need to do so because you

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:56.509 
whatever you need to do so because you
definitely<00:03:55.500> you<00:03:55.680> know<00:03:55.979> we<00:03:56.159> don't<00:03:56.219> want<00:03:56.400> to<00:03:56.430> be

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
definitely you know we don't want to be

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:58.249 
definitely you know we don't want to be
doing<00:03:56.699> this<00:03:56.790> protocol<00:03:57.239> without<00:03:57.389> sufficient

00:03:58.249 --> 00:03:58.259 
doing this protocol without sufficient

00:03:58.259 --> 00:04:00.920 
doing this protocol without sufficient
HCG<00:03:59.099> active<00:03:59.459> in<00:03:59.549> our<00:03:59.609> system<00:04:00.030> and<00:04:00.719> that's<00:04:00.810> the

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
HCG active in our system and that's the

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.479 
HCG active in our system and that's the
whole<00:04:01.109> reason<00:04:01.139> we're<00:04:01.530> doing<00:04:01.680> this<00:04:01.889> diet<00:04:02.129> right

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
whole reason we're doing this diet right

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:05.029 
whole reason we're doing this diet right
is<00:04:02.639> because<00:04:02.819> we<00:04:03.209> believe<00:04:03.599> that<00:04:03.959> this<00:04:04.560> hormone

00:04:05.029 --> 00:04:05.039 
is because we believe that this hormone

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:07.279 
is because we believe that this hormone
really<00:04:05.370> does<00:04:05.579> do<00:04:05.819> something<00:04:06.090> that<00:04:07.049> our<00:04:07.079> body

00:04:07.279 --> 00:04:07.289 
really does do something that our body

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:10.309 
really does do something that our body
wouldn't<00:04:07.769> be<00:04:07.889> doing<00:04:08.099> without<00:04:08.219> it<00:04:08.780> so<00:04:09.780> so<00:04:10.289> I

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 
wouldn't be doing without it so so I

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:13.279 
wouldn't be doing without it so so I
definitely<00:04:10.739> want<00:04:10.889> to<00:04:10.979> be<00:04:11.039> using<00:04:11.370> that<00:04:11.930> at<00:04:12.930> its

00:04:13.279 --> 00:04:13.289 
definitely want to be using that at its

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:15.259 
definitely want to be using that at its
maximum<00:04:13.590> potency<00:04:13.829> I<00:04:14.250> believe<00:04:14.729> once<00:04:15.060> you've

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
maximum potency I believe once you've

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:17.180 
maximum potency I believe once you've
mixed<00:04:15.539> your<00:04:15.689> HCG<00:04:16.139> it's<00:04:16.500> already<00:04:16.979> gonna

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
mixed your HCG it's already gonna

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.129 
mixed your HCG it's already gonna
gradually<00:04:17.789> be<00:04:17.940> losing<00:04:18.359> potency<00:04:18.840> it's<00:04:18.959> not

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:19.139 
gradually be losing potency it's not

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:20.599 
gradually be losing potency it's not
like<00:04:19.260> it's<00:04:19.469> you<00:04:19.680> know<00:04:19.799> 100<00:04:20.130> percent

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
like it's you know 100 percent

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.420 
like it's you know 100 percent
and<00:04:21.000> then<00:04:21.150> three<00:04:21.870> weeks<00:04:22.019> later<00:04:22.169> its<00:04:22.620> it<00:04:23.220> dies

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
and then three weeks later its it dies

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.550 
and then three weeks later its it dies
all<00:04:23.819> of<00:04:23.909> a<00:04:24.000> sudden<00:04:24.360> it's<00:04:24.689> gonna<00:04:24.810> be<00:04:25.050> a<00:04:25.080> probably

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
all of a sudden it's gonna be a probably

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.159 
all of a sudden it's gonna be a probably
a<00:04:25.650> gradual<00:04:26.129> dropping<00:04:26.490> off<00:04:26.639> but<00:04:27.000> I<00:04:27.300> guess<00:04:28.020> at

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:28.169 
a gradual dropping off but I guess at

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:29.719 
a gradual dropping off but I guess at
some<00:04:28.199> point<00:04:28.590> it<00:04:28.710> just<00:04:28.740> gets<00:04:29.069> to<00:04:29.250> a<00:04:29.280> point<00:04:29.490> where

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:29.729 
some point it just gets to a point where

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:32.089 
some point it just gets to a point where
it's<00:04:30.330> not<00:04:30.569> strong<00:04:30.900> enough<00:04:30.960> to<00:04:31.500> really<00:04:31.650> do<00:04:31.919> what

00:04:32.089 --> 00:04:32.099 
it's not strong enough to really do what

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:34.129 
it's not strong enough to really do what
it<00:04:32.159> needs<00:04:32.430> to<00:04:32.610> do<00:04:33.030> in<00:04:33.330> our<00:04:33.449> body<00:04:33.659> anymore

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:34.139 
it needs to do in our body anymore

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:37.580 
it needs to do in our body anymore
so<00:04:34.830> anyway<00:04:35.610> that's<00:04:36.120> I<00:04:36.629> hope<00:04:36.810> that<00:04:37.020> helps<00:04:37.439> and

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
so anyway that's I hope that helps and

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:41.719 
so anyway that's I hope that helps and
as<00:04:38.189> I<00:04:39.090> said<00:04:39.590> one<00:04:40.590> way<00:04:40.740> to<00:04:40.800> kind<00:04:41.129> of<00:04:41.340> avoid<00:04:41.699> that

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:41.729 
as I said one way to kind of avoid that

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:44.659 
as I said one way to kind of avoid that
issue<00:04:42.360> is<00:04:42.750> by<00:04:43.080> mixing<00:04:43.409> with<00:04:43.740> smaller<00:04:44.069> vials

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:44.669 
issue is by mixing with smaller vials

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:46.879 
issue is by mixing with smaller vials
which<00:04:45.000> is<00:04:45.150> what<00:04:45.330> I<00:04:45.360> like<00:04:45.599> to<00:04:45.780> do<00:04:45.900> myself<00:04:46.080> now<00:04:46.590> I

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:46.889 
which is what I like to do myself now I

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:50.779 
which is what I like to do myself now I
mix<00:04:47.400> with<00:04:47.639> 2000<00:04:48.449> IU<00:04:48.659> vials<00:04:49.340> these<00:04:50.340> typically

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:50.789 
mix with 2000 IU vials these typically

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:53.050 
mix with 2000 IU vials these typically
will<00:04:51.060> last<00:04:51.270> anywhere<00:04:51.659> between<00:04:51.960> like<00:04:52.169> nine<00:04:52.650> and

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
will last anywhere between like nine and

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.930 
will last anywhere between like nine and
nine<00:04:54.060> to<00:04:54.360> 11<00:04:54.750> or<00:04:54.870> 12<00:04:55.110> days<00:04:55.349> depending<00:04:56.159> on<00:04:56.400> what

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
nine to 11 or 12 days depending on what

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.659 
nine to 11 or 12 days depending on what
dose<00:04:57.150> you<00:04:57.389> end<00:04:57.569> up<00:04:57.719> taking<00:04:58.250> and<00:04:59.250> this<00:04:59.370> is<00:04:59.490> four

00:04:59.659 --> 00:04:59.669 
dose you end up taking and this is four

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:03.409 
dose you end up taking and this is four
injections<00:04:59.909> by<00:05:00.360> the<00:05:00.449> way<00:05:01.310> so<00:05:02.310> you<00:05:03.090> know<00:05:03.210> that

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:03.419 
injections by the way so you know that

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:05.600 
injections by the way so you know that
being<00:05:03.690> the<00:05:03.810> case<00:05:03.840> I'm<00:05:04.379> already<00:05:04.770> remix<00:05:05.280> in<00:05:05.460> my

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
being the case I'm already remix in my

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:08.300 
being the case I'm already remix in my
HCG<00:05:05.819> basically<00:05:06.810> about<00:05:07.050> every<00:05:07.409> 10<00:05:07.650> days

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
HCG basically about every 10 days

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.790 
HCG basically about every 10 days
so<00:05:08.759> in<00:05:08.969> general<00:05:09.150> I<00:05:09.930> haven't<00:05:10.349> had<00:05:10.469> to<00:05:10.560> worry

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
so in general I haven't had to worry

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.019 
so in general I haven't had to worry
about<00:05:11.099> it<00:05:11.250> going<00:05:11.340> bad<00:05:11.639> because<00:05:11.909> that's

00:05:12.019 --> 00:05:12.029 
about it going bad because that's

00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:14.059 
about it going bad because that's
definitely<00:05:12.659> a<00:05:12.690> short<00:05:13.080> enough<00:05:13.319> time<00:05:13.590> that<00:05:13.919> it's

00:05:14.059 --> 00:05:14.069 
definitely a short enough time that it's

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:16.939 
definitely a short enough time that it's
it's<00:05:14.370> still<00:05:14.550> gonna<00:05:14.729> be<00:05:14.819> viable<00:05:15.199> so<00:05:16.199> um<00:05:16.500> so

00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:16.949 
it's still gonna be viable so um so

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:18.260 
it's still gonna be viable so um so
that's<00:05:17.069> one<00:05:17.340> thing<00:05:17.520> that<00:05:17.669> I<00:05:17.699> really<00:05:18.090> like

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.270 
that's one thing that I really like

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.300 
that's one thing that I really like
about<00:05:18.300> that<00:05:18.810> I<00:05:18.840> just<00:05:18.930> don't<00:05:19.289> have<00:05:19.439> to<00:05:19.590> even<00:05:19.830> you

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:20.310 
about that I just don't have to even you

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.610 
about that I just don't have to even you
know<00:05:20.400> worry<00:05:20.639> about<00:05:20.909> that<00:05:21.150> but<00:05:21.810> as<00:05:22.080> it<00:05:22.229> is<00:05:22.379> you

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:22.620 
know worry about that but as it is you

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.149 
know worry about that but as it is you
know<00:05:22.650> 5,000<00:05:23.400> IU<00:05:23.550> vials<00:05:23.969> are<00:05:24.180> a<00:05:24.210> little<00:05:24.539> cheaper

00:05:25.149 --> 00:05:25.159 
know 5,000 IU vials are a little cheaper

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:27.769 
know 5,000 IU vials are a little cheaper
to<00:05:26.159> do<00:05:26.340> you<00:05:26.610> don't<00:05:26.699> have<00:05:26.879> to<00:05:27.029> mix<00:05:27.180> this<00:05:27.360> often

00:05:27.769 --> 00:05:27.779 
to do you don't have to mix this often

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:30.649 
to do you don't have to mix this often
and<00:05:28.020> and<00:05:28.949> certainly<00:05:29.759> for<00:05:30.029> the<00:05:30.120> for<00:05:30.389> the<00:05:30.449> most

00:05:30.649 --> 00:05:30.659 
and and certainly for the for the most

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:34.279 
and and certainly for the for the most
part<00:05:30.990> they<00:05:31.169> work<00:05:31.379> great<00:05:31.710> you<00:05:32.069> know<00:05:32.310> um<00:05:33.289> so

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:34.289 
part they work great you know um so

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:43.940 
looks like a 5,000 IU vial of sublingual

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:47.390 
looks like a 5,000 IU vial of sublingual
of<00:05:44.940> rx<00:05:45.419> HCG<00:05:46.080> for<00:05:46.440> you<00:05:46.650> know<00:05:46.770> using<00:05:47.099> for

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:49.110 
sublingual ends up getting used up in

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:52.339 
sublingual ends up getting used up in
about<00:05:49.289> 15<00:05:49.529> days<00:05:50.009> so<00:05:50.849> in<00:05:51.060> general<00:05:51.389> you<00:05:51.870> again

00:05:52.339 --> 00:05:52.349 
about 15 days so in general you again

00:05:52.349 --> 00:05:54.019 
about 15 days so in general you again
you<00:05:52.529> probably<00:05:52.800> wouldn't<00:05:53.339> have<00:05:53.430> to<00:05:53.580> worry<00:05:53.789> too

00:05:54.019 --> 00:05:54.029 
you probably wouldn't have to worry too

00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:57.860 
you probably wouldn't have to worry too
much<00:05:54.060> about<00:05:54.270> losing<00:05:55.259> the<00:05:55.379> potency<00:05:56.690> on<00:05:57.690> those

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:57.870 
much about losing the potency on those

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:59.649 
much about losing the potency on those
since<00:05:58.199> you're<00:05:58.319> using<00:05:58.469> it<00:05:58.710> up<00:05:58.800> fairly<00:05:59.009> quickly

00:05:59.649 --> 00:05:59.659 
since you're using it up fairly quickly

00:05:59.659 --> 00:06:02.089 
since you're using it up fairly quickly
so<00:06:00.659> it's<00:06:00.839> mostly<00:06:01.169> just<00:06:01.440> for<00:06:01.620> those<00:06:01.740> who<00:06:01.800> are
