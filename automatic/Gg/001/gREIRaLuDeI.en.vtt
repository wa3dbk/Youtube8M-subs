00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.670
 all salute i'm not some kind of yar and push 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:10.620
 but still fix the knife on the paste 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:13.950
 using the board me this way 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:18.869
 like and he sort of 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:21.920
 is such a relax somehow and this 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:25.400
 video is dedicated to when here 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:28.950
 beginner click is selected for the post 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:31.710
 the board and thinks that I will rule 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:33.809
 what I want to say do not chase the big 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.510
 the amount of art that's after 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:40.530
 half a year what board tmi did not appear 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:43.140
 line of mimo video about it is on my 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:49.140
 channel if I find the link I will leave here 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:53.040
 I mean somewhere I bought posts gray 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:56.100
 white and thought that well, that's all to me 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.200
 you need one more package 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.560
 the situation that I could not take 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:04.470
 so left here as is one by one 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:06.420
 I think ok well, I do not have enough so not 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.939
 enough so now after six months 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:15.110
 pasta from used up if you just 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:15.110
 show how much you see how much 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:22.819
 consumed this paste that is with 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:27.270
 the same success can not be said that 

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:30.659
 constant and put and so on but by those 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:35.819
 same winter evenings for example i'm much 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:37.679
 more often engaged with dostochka with knives 

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:40.740
 because such a small relax 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:43.350
 turn on and youtube look happens 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.670
 that and at the same time correct all the knives 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:49.060
 which do you have 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:51.759
 and the actual consumption is here 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.640
 what is white what server is about the same 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:57.670
 the only sulfur is a little more 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:00.670
 development apparently more often and and I have to 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:05.439
 apply more often and use it here 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:08.170
 half a year intense for someone in 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:13.800
 communication is not intensive work 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:16.630
 less this is such a blackboard 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:20.650
 Now almost every day this summer 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:23.920
 about once every three days maybe 4 correct 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.180
 knives when there is time then 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.489
 daylight hours 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:32.319
 much more but by the evening you 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:35.769
 come tired just not even up 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:38.019
 youtube videos don't even look 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:41.980
 It happens that you rarely look one 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:44.310
 little eyes and everything is well and winter evenings were 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:48.370
 the time is somewhat larger therefore 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:51.130
 the post was spent well nevertheless 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.880
 in general, I do not know how anyone is 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.519
 half a year 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:57.670
 eaten here like that 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:03:00.280
 to a large extent from one piece of dialux 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.910
 that's enough for 5-6 years 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.950
 anyway me with my current 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:08.709
 use and I have a number of knives 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:11.950
 do not increase that is here appeared at 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:14.609
 I was ontario's knife and the plan sent me 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:17.850
 buddy and I will review it 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:20.739
 be sure to enjoy it 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:22.900
 poisonous acid handle unfortunately 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:25.870
 the camera here is this fish she just does not 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:28.550
 conveys the color I tried to adjust in no way 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:36.430
 it fails try us here 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:37.670
 need to remove that is to use 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.630
 pasta 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:45.740
 It seems to me to a laptop . will be for eyes 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:48.200
 enough so friends here in my 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:50.630
 use as will appear new 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:55.820
 the knife is up to me the old knife which is mine 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:59.180
 was ganzo g704 I presented further with my 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:01.160
 such use is such a paste from 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.500
 consumed very very long like 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:06.350
 the board itself will be whether 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:10.820
 nothing at all will be interesting to find out how 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:13.580
 you spend fasting how often do you 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:17.660
 do this welcome video responses 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:19.430
 this remained friends well this video and 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:23.630
 wanted to devote here directly 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:26.420
 beginners pushing us that friends are not 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:28.850
 drive because of the post i am at first myself 

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:30.950
 I thought that now Iâ€™m going to start knives 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:33.830
 adversity to rule so she has everything 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:38.140
 will end and then what to do 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:42.860
 will take 2 or even four as 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:45.260
 boys surrogate words yes all by 2 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:51.350
 need to take i understand it in something well 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:54.440
 I think you shouldn't pick this one up 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:56.020
 because even with this principle on 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.880
 my view is heavy use 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:01.820
 fasting consumed satisfied channel 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:04.010
