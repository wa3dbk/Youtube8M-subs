every<00:00:56.540> year<00:00:56.780> so<00:00:57.680> then<00:00:57.860> finally<00:00:58.490> I<00:00:58.760> think<00:00:59.330> in

00:00:59.460 --> 00:00:59.470 
every year so then finally I think in

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:05.109 
every year so then finally I think in
1952<00:01:00.470> is<00:01:00.890> when<00:01:01.790> he<00:01:02.120> admitted<00:01:02.930> that<00:01:03.110> in<00:01:03.620> fact<00:01:04.119> he

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 
1952 is when he admitted that in fact he

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:09.490 
1952 is when he admitted that in fact he
had<00:01:05.630> actually<00:01:06.040> fifth<00:01:07.040> the<00:01:07.220> age<00:01:08.260> so<00:01:09.260> that<00:01:09.410> he

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
had actually fifth the age so that he

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:10.840 
had actually fifth the age so that he
could<00:01:09.650> start<00:01:09.890> racing<00:01:10.130> when<00:01:10.430> he<00:01:10.520> was<00:01:10.640> still<00:01:10.790> a

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
could start racing when he was still a

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.110 
could start racing when he was still a
teenager<00:01:11.090> he<00:01:11.780> finally<00:01:12.200> admitted<00:01:12.500> in<00:01:12.800> 52<00:01:13.370> that

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:14.120
