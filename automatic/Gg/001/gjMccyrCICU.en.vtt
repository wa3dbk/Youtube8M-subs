00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.520
 the alive and brown 92 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.500
 very good we are all here once 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.900
 more in kraft and today he will teach how to do 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:15.030
 x 10 and well guys you know that yesterday 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.070
 I brought a command to be able to perform 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.600
 kamehameha that would be a fi fi val 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.970
 whatever it does is run 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.800
 and burst and well I'm going to explain a 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.269
 command that is the same nothing more than 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.430
 modified a number and we can do it 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.230
 by 10 that is to say your explosion will be ten 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.510
 times more then well I hope that you 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.279
 like it and good first thing we will do 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.750
 will obviously copy the command that 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.480
 I have the description that I already did yesterday 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.250
 you can go through the video and take it and 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.360
 well it's just worth once we're 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.579
 inside you are going to see that here he puts 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.350
 explosion power 5 is worth it we are going to 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.200
 change and we're going to put 10 and let's see 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.660
 if it bursts this I advise you that if not 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.610
 you have a good pc do not do it because it is 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.750
 a very big explosion I have even 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.699
 I tried the one of 100 and I dropped it 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.320
 minecraft or that flipar and good a 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.579
 once we change the number it's worth checking 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.129
 by the way the command that does not have 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.829
 no any code so that it's not 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.039
 normal okay then let's apply 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.039
 here 

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:08.090
 and all this that I'm seeing floating 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.490
 obviously they are the kamehameha for 10 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.110
 it's worth fire vall as such 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.490
 you can see the look is different already 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.560
 that I have not included any part of 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.750
 textures this is a val cinema but in 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.890
 every rule is worth this is the fire vall and 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.500
 well we can find the minecraft 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.660
 you do not need any pack of 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.700
 textures or anything worth it would be there you see 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.320
 that cool is super epic and good 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.060
 then everything together in fourth because to 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.260
 the occasion comes in handy and now what 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.780
 I'm going to do is burst this area the 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:36.580
 it looks like a shirt and yes and we're going to see that 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.580
 everything goes well ok let's go there 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:54.110
 the power follows and we comment on the people 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.110
 leave 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:03.900
 and well let's affect them 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.900
 because we're leaving 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:15.940
 I am super saiyans a mega pita metal 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:19.600
 I'm carrying everything my mother 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.940
 I will not leave anything out outside here 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.680
 out everything but as you can see the 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.180
 explosion is much bigger than the 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.560
 above is this is busting a 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.530
 way look i'm going to throw the guide is 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:32.380
 alone so that you can see it look at mother 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.150
 mine is 10 times bigger and good 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.610
 that's why it's a kamehameha for 10 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.950
 voucher from the dragon ball gt series that 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.840
 I liked it much more by the way and good 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.250
 if you want to put what would be the fire 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.350
 Okay, I would be saying oh yes with 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.330
 I put it and I said it yesterday in the 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.860
 gameplay in simply because as we have 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.530
 pressed the button quoted from there of the block 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:53.020
 Pulse command is beating and here you see 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.430
 who tells me if I tell him I love her and 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.960
 it's already this way we put it here 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.960
 and we already have it kamehameha 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.480
 polis polis and good guys here 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.100
 dismissal with these explosions that no longer 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.320
 I will obviously bring more kamehameha is 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.700

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.440
 tomorrow we continue with the tutorials os 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.020
