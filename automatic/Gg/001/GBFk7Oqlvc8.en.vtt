this<00:00:14.730> kind<00:00:14.940> of<00:00:14.969> roundish<00:00:15.780> shape<00:00:15.809> like<00:00:16.379> that

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
this kind of roundish shape like that

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.890 
this kind of roundish shape like that
which<00:00:16.859> is<00:00:16.980> a<00:00:17.010> fan<00:00:17.250> of<00:00:17.340> an<00:00:17.430> upside-down<00:00:17.730> u<00:00:18.000> and

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
which is a fan of an upside-down u and

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.740 
which is a fan of an upside-down u and
then<00:00:19.859> we<00:00:20.070> need<00:00:20.250> to<00:00:20.279> bring<00:00:20.609> it<00:00:20.970> round<00:00:21.240> into<00:00:21.720> a

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
then we need to bring it round into a

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.630 
then we need to bring it round into a
nice<00:00:22.850> curve<00:00:24.050> around<00:00:25.050> like<00:00:25.350> that<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:25.650> curve<00:00:26.430> it

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
nice curve around like that and curve it

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.630 
nice curve around like that and curve it
up<00:00:26.789> into<00:00:27.000> there<00:00:27.529> and<00:00:28.529> then<00:00:28.740> starting<00:00:29.340> around

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
up into there and then starting around

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.450 
up into there and then starting around
about<00:00:29.849> here<00:00:30.179> we're<00:00:30.390> gonna<00:00:30.510> draw<00:00:31.219> kind<00:00:32.219> of<00:00:32.369> a

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
about here we're gonna draw kind of a

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.490 
about here we're gonna draw kind of a
semi<00:00:32.880> ellipse<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:33.750> you<00:00:33.809> can<00:00:33.960> just<00:00:34.140> do<00:00:34.320> some

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
semi ellipse and you can just do some

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.130 
semi ellipse and you can just do some
little<00:00:34.620> dots<00:00:34.980> in<00:00:35.309> there<00:00:35.489> like<00:00:35.700> that<00:00:36.020> and<00:00:37.020> we're

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
little dots in there like that and we're

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.310 
little dots in there like that and we're
gonna<00:00:37.230> put<00:00:37.440> in<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.649> clap<00:00:37.920> up<00:00:38.930> let's<00:00:39.930> start<00:00:40.020> off

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
gonna put in the clap up let's start off

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.770 
gonna put in the clap up let's start off
with<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.530> little<00:00:40.739> circle<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:41.460> little<00:00:42.059> bit<00:00:42.420> like

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
with the little circle a little bit like

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.250 
with the little circle a little bit like
that<00:00:43.250> draw<00:00:44.250> a<00:00:44.399> circle<00:00:45.030> behind<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.840> then<00:00:46.079> the

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
that draw a circle behind and then the

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.369 
that draw a circle behind and then the
bit<00:00:46.410> that<00:00:46.590> goes<00:00:46.739> up<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.100> middle<00:00:48.170> and<00:00:49.170> then

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
bit that goes up the middle and then

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.610 
bit that goes up the middle and then
that<00:00:49.559> will<00:00:49.710> give<00:00:49.890> you<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.250> clapper<00:00:51.410> and<00:00:52.410> then

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
that will give you the clapper and then

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.610 
that will give you the clapper and then
I'm<00:00:52.770> going<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.100> put<00:00:53.280> some<00:00:53.989> shading<00:00:54.989> in<00:00:55.379> like

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
I'm going to put some shading in like

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.340 
I'm going to put some shading in like
that<00:00:56.989> and<00:00:57.989> I'm<00:00:58.170> gonna<00:00:58.289> put<00:00:58.559> some<00:00:58.590> more<00:00:58.800> shading

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
that and I'm gonna put some more shading

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:07.429 
that and I'm gonna put some more shading
coming<00:01:01.350> in<00:01:01.469> down<00:01:01.680> behind<00:01:01.859> like<00:01:02.340> that<00:01:06.290> so<00:01:07.290> we're

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
coming in down behind like that so we're

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.140 
coming in down behind like that so we're
gonna<00:01:07.530> get<00:01:09.830> the<00:01:10.830> kind<00:01:11.010> of<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.189> thickness<00:01:11.640> of

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
gonna get the kind of the thickness of

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.380 
gonna get the kind of the thickness of
the<00:01:12.360> material<00:01:12.450> like<00:01:13.170> that<00:01:13.200> there<00:01:14.240> and<00:01:15.240> then

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
the material like that there and then

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.440 
the material like that there and then
that<00:01:15.630> will<00:01:15.810> all<00:01:15.930> say<00:01:16.400> sweep<00:01:17.400> around<00:01:17.610> there<00:01:18.090> and

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
that will all say sweep around there and

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.440 
that will all say sweep around there and
then<00:01:18.689> we're<00:01:18.840> gonna<00:01:18.960> want<00:01:19.259> to<00:01:19.320> have<00:01:19.619> just<00:01:20.450> a

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
then we're gonna want to have just a

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.980 
then we're gonna want to have just a
little<00:01:21.479> bit<00:01:21.840> of<00:01:21.960> a<00:01:22.049> pattern<00:01:23.659> coming<00:01:24.659> across

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
little bit of a pattern coming across

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.819 
little bit of a pattern coming across
there<00:01:25.439> and<00:01:26.659> what<00:01:27.659> we're<00:01:27.780> gonna<00:01:27.869> do<00:01:28.259> is<00:01:28.530> have

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
these this sort of tied together as a

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:39.170 
these this sort of tied together as a
ribbon<00:01:34.130> with<00:01:35.130> a<00:01:35.159> bow<00:01:35.430> and<00:01:37.549> then<00:01:38.549> we'll<00:01:38.759> put

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
ribbon with a bow and then we'll put

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.440 
ribbon with a bow and then we'll put
round<00:01:39.509> there<00:01:39.810> into<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.439> bow<00:01:41.090> and<00:01:42.090> that<00:01:42.119> will

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
round there into the bow and that will

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.240 
round there into the bow and that will
come<00:01:42.720> in<00:01:42.930> like<00:01:43.350> that<00:01:43.619> as<00:01:43.799> well

come in like that as well

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:50.510 
come in like that as well
a<00:01:44.479> bit<00:01:45.479> of<00:01:45.630> shade<00:01:45.960> underneath<00:01:46.649> it<00:01:49.220> and<00:01:50.220> a<00:01:50.340> bit

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
a bit of shade underneath it and a bit

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.850 
a bit of shade underneath it and a bit
of<00:01:50.640> shade<00:01:50.909> around<00:01:51.119> that<00:01:51.600> part<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.439> there<00:01:52.649> may

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
of shade around that part and there may

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.959 
of shade around that part and there may
be<00:01:52.890> a<00:01:53.070> little<00:01:53.280> bit<00:01:53.520> of<00:01:55.310> shading<00:01:56.310> around<00:01:56.549> there

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.410 
be a little bit of shading around there
then<00:01:57.270> we<00:01:57.390> control<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:57.840> other<00:01:58.020> belt<00:01:58.320> behind

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
then we control the other belt behind

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.510 
then we control the other belt behind
which<00:02:00.420> will<00:02:00.600> be<00:02:00.750> gonna<00:02:00.990> tied<00:02:01.350> on<00:02:01.619> and<00:02:01.979> that

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
which will be gonna tied on and that

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.060 
which will be gonna tied on and that
will<00:02:02.729> be<00:02:02.939> doing<00:02:03.210> a<00:02:03.390> similar<00:02:04.290> kind<00:02:04.530> of<00:02:04.740> shape

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
will be doing a similar kind of shape

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.119 
will be doing a similar kind of shape
like<00:02:05.340> that<00:02:06.259> except<00:02:07.259> that<00:02:07.350> we're<00:02:07.590> looking<00:02:07.770> from

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
like that except that we're looking from

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.550 
like that except that we're looking from
behind<00:02:08.280> this<00:02:08.849> time<00:02:09.149> so<00:02:09.989> we<00:02:10.110> can<00:02:10.259> go<00:02:10.440> around

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
behind this time so we can go around

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.920 
behind this time so we can go around
there<00:02:11.009> and<00:02:11.910> then<00:02:12.150> we<00:02:12.270> want<00:02:12.480> to<00:02:12.540> have<00:02:12.750> the
