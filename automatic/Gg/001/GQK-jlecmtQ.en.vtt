00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.100
 Islam seems a simple thing but 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.250
 has great technology 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.650
 His first thing as the mask is the 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.949
 people first evaluate comfort comfort 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.689
 the biter biters are usually 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.970
 very flexible materials and 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:33.690
 and you can also find the 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.100
 snorkel in the version also in black with the 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.809
 same location 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:43.649
 soft on average 35 to 45 centimeters 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:46.020
 always and always always the same 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.149
 scuba diving snorkels they are 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.670
 placed on the left side then the 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.559
 already indicates that he is going to 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.750
 be placed on the left side 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:59.219
 there are snorkels that you can use 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:03.049
 both sides on both sides as well as 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:05.880
 on the other just a matter of adjustment 

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:07.920
 these new ones are usually used 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.030
 both for free diving and 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.479
 scuba diving 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:15.509
 Another important factor in snorkeling is 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.549
 gauge width already exists . 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.450
 three-quarters of an inch to a 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.729
 inch 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.189
 The important thing about the snorkel that gives comfort 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.080
 for you got talent because every time 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.630
 You make a descent, you're a show. 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.970
 for it there may remain water inside 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.939
 quality of nato north it for that 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.100
 invented that a discharge valve 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.890
 It is nothing more than a diaphragm zinho 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.020
 which allows the water to escape then when 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.119
 you just to create a venture effect that 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.030
 the air will come out from under and out 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:48.020
 over and water accompanies exhaust in 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:51.090
 note the wider notes in this 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.310
 Everyone has to have this as an issue. 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.969
 of comfort I can have a snorkel without 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:00.090
 The valve can then I prefer that where 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:02.790
 thinner body gauge than you 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.320
 You will have the same comfort of the work okay 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.659
 free diving 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.479
 the dive is used on either side 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.950
 stand alone on left side only 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.560
 in scuba diving we use the 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:17.099
 snorkel a stage called stage 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.709
 that is, he will be imprisoned in this region and 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:21.420
 you work because in diving 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.819
 standalone, we stand for more time 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.870
 than in free diving and diving 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:27.510
 free 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.450
 we use it in a position called 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:33.360
 of never we go to catch the snorkel 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:36.030
 on the back of the mask or 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.640
 diving autonomic lateral saci and 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:42.660
 in the free dive in the back strip then 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:45.090
 you stand in this position here some of the 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.580
 also has what breaks the wave 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.470
 this is to prevent a wave from coming 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.580
 above and between water working its 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.230
 breath 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:56.010
 a lot of people think that scuba diving 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.810
 or do not move if you use snorkel yes and 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.569
 is important for navigation in the 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.700
 surface even with the equipment that 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:05.340
 if you accept a situation of more than 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.560
 stronger wave in water not so 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.930
 quiet though a good solution than 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.880
 you spend the side of the cylinder in the 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.980
 northern surfaces 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.290
 Teether will you wear your teeth 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:20.880
 position and the lip above this position. 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:25.829
 shape and breathe the full 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:30.560
 mouth gives when what you have to discharge 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:30.560
 You do the same job too. 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:36.569
 To exhaust this snorkel you will exhaust 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.370
 he is not particularly 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:40.200
 valve water then goes all out 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.090
 you are always with full lungs all 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.680
 time you make a descent with 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.530
 snorkel you will always be with the 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:50.820
 lung full because when you climb 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:53.370
 you can exhaust it hard to 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:55.230
 remembering that the valve is a tool and 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.620
 both for your comfort to power 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.620
 local
