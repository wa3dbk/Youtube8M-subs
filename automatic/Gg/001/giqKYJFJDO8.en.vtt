now<00:02:07.130> this<00:02:07.280> one<00:02:07.430> here<00:02:07.549> is<00:02:07.640> a<00:02:07.670> little<00:02:07.759> bit

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
now this one here is a little bit

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.719 
now this one here is a little bit
different<00:02:08.479> it's<00:02:09.170> not<00:02:09.289> an<00:02:09.649> actual<00:02:10.220> functional

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
different it's not an actual functional

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.570 
different it's not an actual functional
bed<00:02:10.910> it's<00:02:11.270> more<00:02:11.600> like<00:02:11.860> if<00:02:12.860> you<00:02:13.010> just<00:02:13.250> building

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
bed it's more like if you just building

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.000 
bed it's more like if you just building
a<00:02:13.640> house<00:02:13.819> to<00:02:14.030> show<00:02:14.239> and<00:02:14.540> you<00:02:15.319> want<00:02:15.500> something

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
a house to show and you want something

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.650 
a house to show and you want something
that<00:02:16.130> looks<00:02:16.220> like<00:02:16.459> a<00:02:16.489> bit<00:02:16.760> and<00:02:16.970> for<00:02:17.600> the

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
that looks like a bit and for the

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.490 
that looks like a bit and for the
pillows<00:02:17.989> I've<00:02:18.319> used<00:02:18.680> snow<00:02:19.130> blocks<00:02:19.489> which<00:02:20.030> are

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
pillows I've used snow blocks which are

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.300 
pillows I've used snow blocks which are
here<00:02:22.120> blocks<00:02:23.120> that<00:02:23.569> block<00:02:23.840> there<00:02:24.080> and<00:02:24.319> then

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
here blocks that block there and then

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.550 
here blocks that block there and then
you<00:02:25.400> just<00:02:25.430> place<00:02:25.790> them<00:02:26.000> down<00:02:26.209> have<00:02:27.140> to<00:02:27.290> strut

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
you just place them down have to strut

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.229 
you just place them down have to strut
down<00:02:27.800> let's<00:02:28.459> get<00:02:28.730> the<00:02:28.910> block<00:02:29.239> back<00:02:31.120> get<00:02:32.120> our

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
down let's get the block back get our

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:35.290 
down let's get the block back get our
cream<00:02:32.510> and<00:02:33.040> press<00:02:34.040> snow<00:02:34.400> down<00:02:34.640> and<00:02:34.880> it<00:02:35.150> looks

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
cream and press snow down and it looks

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.520 
cream and press snow down and it looks
like<00:02:35.360> a<00:02:35.480> pillar<00:02:35.750> because<00:02:35.870> it's<00:02:36.080> just<00:02:36.230> slightly

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
like a pillar because it's just slightly

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:37.300 
like a pillar because it's just slightly
raised<00:02:36.890> up

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
raised up

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:38.920 
raised up
you've<00:02:37.790> got<00:02:37.910> hatches<00:02:38.239> on<00:02:38.360> the<00:02:38.450> end<00:02:38.569> of<00:02:38.690> the<00:02:38.750> bed

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
you've got hatches on the end of the bed

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.309 
you've got hatches on the end of the bed
so<00:02:39.170> it<00:02:39.319> gives<00:02:39.530> the<00:02:39.920> bed<00:02:40.100> kind<00:02:40.340> of<00:02:40.459> a<00:02:40.550> frame<00:02:41.319> some

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
so it gives the bed kind of a frame some

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:44.410 
so it gives the bed kind of a frame some
wall<00:02:42.530> blocks<00:02:42.769> here<00:02:42.950> for<00:02:43.160> a<00:02:43.190> rug<00:02:43.489> another

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
really used that before but I thought it

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.229

came up with on the couch crossover I
like<00:03:24.320> it<00:03:24.470> because<00:03:24.680> it<00:03:24.769> looks<00:03:24.950> really<00:03:25.220> modern

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.490 
it's like a modern style of a big
headboard<00:03:28.070> at<00:03:28.190> the<00:03:28.250> back<00:03:28.489> and<00:03:28.790> this<00:03:29.690> is<00:03:30.350> his

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
headboard at the back and this is his

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.349 
headboard at the back and this is his
wall<00:03:30.680> blocks<00:03:30.950> with<00:03:31.100> half<00:03:31.310> slabs<00:03:32.000> going<00:03:32.239> all

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:32.359 
wall blocks with half slabs going all

wall blocks with half slabs going all
the<00:03:32.510> way<00:03:32.540> around<00:03:32.840> it<00:03:33.049> and<00:03:33.200> it<00:03:33.530> gives<00:03:33.769> it<00:03:33.890> that

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
the way around it and it gives it that

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.640 
the way around it and it gives it that
like<00:03:34.519> step-up<00:03:35.000> look<00:03:35.239> so<00:03:35.570> it<00:03:36.140> doesn't<00:03:36.470> look<00:03:36.590> too

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650

picture<00:03:47.720> lived<00:03:48.440> a<00:03:48.560> chair<00:03:48.970> got<00:03:49.970> leaves<00:03:50.269> again

picture lived a chair got leaves again
for<00:03:50.810> decoration<00:03:51.549> lamps<00:03:52.549> beside<00:03:52.880> the<00:03:53.060> bed<00:03:53.209> so

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660 
for decoration lamps beside the bed so

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.120 
for decoration lamps beside the bed so
it's<00:03:53.840> a<00:03:53.930> simple<00:03:54.140> design<00:03:54.410> but<00:03:54.769> I<00:03:54.799> think<00:03:55.010> it

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130 
it's a simple design but I think it

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:56.860 
it's a simple design but I think it
looked<00:03:55.340> really<00:03:55.549> nice<00:03:55.790> when<00:03:56.329> it's<00:03:56.480> put<00:03:56.630> into<00:03:56.780> a

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
looked really nice when it's put into a

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.039 
looked really nice when it's put into a
house<00:03:58.209> crafting<00:03:59.209> tables<00:03:59.570> each<00:03:59.690> side<00:03:59.840> of<00:03:59.989> the

pictures<00:04:03.560> repeated<00:04:04.010> because<00:04:04.340> I<00:04:04.370> didn't<00:04:04.670> have

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
pictures repeated because I didn't have

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.259 
pictures repeated because I didn't have
one<00:04:04.910> that<00:04:05.060> fit<00:04:05.209> the<00:04:05.329> space<00:04:05.920> again<00:04:06.920> leaves<00:04:07.790> here

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:08.269 
one that fit the space again leaves here

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:11.170 
one that fit the space again leaves here
for<00:04:08.630> some<00:04:08.810> decoration<00:04:09.470> and<00:04:09.739> yeah<00:04:10.340> I<00:04:10.640> think<00:04:10.910> I

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
for some decoration and yeah I think I

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.550 
for some decoration and yeah I think I
think<00:04:11.510> this<00:04:11.600> one<00:04:11.750> looks<00:04:11.780> really<00:04:11.989> nice<00:04:12.290> I<00:04:12.500> do

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
think this one looks really nice I do

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.729 
think this one looks really nice I do
like<00:04:12.829> this<00:04:12.950> one<00:04:13.010> I've<00:04:13.340> used<00:04:13.820> this<00:04:13.940> one<00:04:14.120> before

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:14.739 
like this one I've used this one before

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:17.620 
like this one I've used this one before
let's<00:04:15.739> go<00:04:15.889> into<00:04:16.040> the<00:04:16.130> next<00:04:16.310> one

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
let's go into the next one

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.390 
let's go into the next one
now<00:04:18.630> this<00:04:18.780> one<00:04:18.990> here<00:04:19.260> is<00:04:19.320> the<00:04:19.830> slightly

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
now this one here is the slightly

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.040 
now this one here is the slightly
different<00:04:20.580> style<00:04:21.030> of<00:04:21.270> four-poster<00:04:21.870> bed

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:22.050 
different style of four-poster bed

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:24.410 
different style of four-poster bed
because<00:04:22.950> we're<00:04:23.130> not<00:04:23.220> using<00:04:23.670> real<00:04:24.150> beds

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:24.420 
because we're not using real beds

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:26.600 
because we're not using real beds
reusing<00:04:24.840> wool<00:04:25.020> this<00:04:25.170> time<00:04:25.440> again<00:04:25.950> snow<00:04:26.340> for

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
reusing wool this time again snow for

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.550 
reusing wool this time again snow for
the<00:04:26.640> pillars<00:04:26.880> and<00:04:27.210> around<00:04:28.080> the<00:04:28.170> top<00:04:28.380> we've<00:04:28.530> got

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
the pillars and around the top we've got

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.130 
the pillars and around the top we've got
fence<00:04:29.490> gates<00:04:29.820> and<00:04:30.180> I<00:04:30.330> like<00:04:30.540> this<00:04:30.720> because<00:04:30.960> I

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.140 
fence gates and I like this because I

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:32.660 
fence gates and I like this because I
think<00:04:31.200> it<00:04:31.470> looks<00:04:31.650> like<00:04:31.890> it<00:04:32.130> kind<00:04:32.340> of<00:04:32.460> looks

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:32.670 
think it looks like it kind of looks

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:34.970 
think it looks like it kind of looks
like<00:04:32.790> the<00:04:33.360> style<00:04:33.660> that<00:04:33.810> a<00:04:34.140> four-poster<00:04:34.830> bed

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:34.980 
like the style that a four-poster bed

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.460 
like the style that a four-poster bed
would<00:04:35.130> have<00:04:35.340> I<00:04:35.610> run<00:04:36.480> a<00:04:36.510> top<00:04:36.780> like<00:04:36.960> linked<00:04:37.290> up

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
would have I run a top like linked up

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.680 
would have I run a top like linked up
kind<00:04:37.710> of<00:04:37.770> thing<00:04:38.120> and<00:04:39.120> I<00:04:39.210> think<00:04:39.420> it<00:04:39.540> looks

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
kind of thing and I think it looks

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:40.540 
kind of thing and I think it looks
really<00:04:39.960> good

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
really good

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:45.410 
really good
another<00:04:41.810> bookshelf<00:04:43.130> kind<00:04:44.130> of<00:04:44.220> style<00:04:44.670> there<00:04:45.240> I

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:45.420 
another bookshelf kind of style there I

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.470 
another bookshelf kind of style there I
came<00:04:45.720> up<00:04:45.900> with<00:04:46.760> this<00:04:47.760> this<00:04:48.030> one's<00:04:48.270> really

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:48.480 
came up with this this one's really

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:49.940 
came up with this this one's really
simple<00:04:48.870> is<00:04:48.930> not<00:04:49.050> much<00:04:49.230> in<00:04:49.350> it<00:04:49.380> because<00:04:49.680> the<00:04:49.770> bed

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:49.950 
simple is not much in it because the bed

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:51.560 
simple is not much in it because the bed
takes<00:04:50.220> up<00:04:50.400> a<00:04:50.490> lot<00:04:50.700> of<00:04:50.730> space<00:04:51.030> so<00:04:51.270> you<00:04:51.360> don't

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 
takes up a lot of space so you don't

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:54.110 
takes up a lot of space so you don't
want<00:04:51.690> to<00:04:51.750> cram<00:04:52.020> the<00:04:52.170> room<00:04:52.790> unnecessary<00:04:53.790> things

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
want to cram the room unnecessary things

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.330 
want to cram the room unnecessary things
so<00:04:54.900> I'll<00:04:55.020> just<00:04:55.170> put<00:04:55.320> two<00:04:55.530> chests<00:04:55.890> either<00:04:56.160> side

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
so I'll just put two chests either side

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.880 
so I'll just put two chests either side
of<00:04:56.370> the<00:04:56.550> bed<00:04:56.810> you've<00:04:57.810> got<00:04:58.080> your<00:04:58.290> half<00:04:58.530> slabs

00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:58.890 
of the bed you've got your half slabs

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:00.620 
of the bed you've got your half slabs
going<00:04:59.130> around<00:04:59.310> the<00:04:59.460> bed<00:04:59.670> and<00:04:59.850> then<00:04:59.970> the<00:05:00.390> full

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
going around the bed and then the full

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.370 
going around the bed and then the full
