hey<00:00:01.140> guys<00:00:01.350> CTS<00:00:01.829> out<00:00:01.979> there<00:00:02.280> and<00:00:02.550> I<00:00:02.790> just<00:00:03.000> got<00:00:03.179> a

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
hey guys CTS out there and I just got a

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.720 
hey guys CTS out there and I just got a
question<00:00:03.510> that's<00:00:04.020> actually<00:00:04.410> pretty<00:00:04.799> it's<00:00:05.670> a

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
question that's actually pretty it's a

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.470 
question that's actually pretty it's a
pretty<00:00:05.910> good<00:00:06.089> one<00:00:07.099> based<00:00:08.099> off<00:00:08.280> my<00:00:08.340> auto<00:00:09.120> rig<00:00:09.330> a

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
pretty good one based off my auto rig a

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.299 
pretty good one based off my auto rig a
garage<00:00:09.780> door<00:00:09.990> in<00:00:10.050> Maya<00:00:10.290> I<00:00:10.559> was<00:00:10.800> asked<00:00:11.160> about

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
garage door in Maya I was asked about

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.789 
garage door in Maya I was asked about
the<00:00:11.880> motion<00:00:12.300> path<00:00:12.540> and<00:00:12.809> how<00:00:13.019> to<00:00:13.080> make<00:00:13.320> it<00:00:13.440> be

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
the motion path and how to make it be

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.140 
the motion path and how to make it be
able<00:00:14.009> to<00:00:14.099> cycle<00:00:14.639> and<00:00:15.350> what<00:00:16.640> ATV<00:00:17.640> broke<00:00:17.910> here

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
able to cycle and what ATV broke here

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.849 
able to cycle and what ATV broke here
aka<00:00:18.840> Alfonso<00:00:19.560> he<00:00:20.220> was<00:00:20.369> asking<00:00:21.560> how<00:00:22.560> I<00:00:22.590> could

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
aka Alfonso he was asking how I could

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.150 
aka Alfonso he was asking how I could
make<00:00:22.949> it<00:00:23.070> cycle<00:00:23.460> and<00:00:24.529> what<00:00:25.529> would<00:00:25.680> be<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:26.010> best

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
make it cycle and what would be the best

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.419 
make it cycle and what would be the best
approach<00:00:26.310> now<00:00:26.820> to<00:00:26.880> do<00:00:27.029> that<00:00:27.240> so<00:00:28.250> this<00:00:29.250> is<00:00:29.310> a

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
approach now to do that so this is a

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.479 
approach now to do that so this is a
video<00:00:29.789> a<00:00:30.000> video<00:00:30.240> response<00:00:30.539> to<00:00:31.470> that<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:32.040> what

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
video a video response to that and what

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.819 
video a video response to that and what
I<00:00:32.520> have<00:00:32.700> here<00:00:32.940> is<00:00:33.090> I<00:00:33.239> actually<00:00:33.390> have<00:00:33.630> his<00:00:33.899> Maya

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
I have here is I actually have his Maya

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.200 
I have here is I actually have his Maya
file<00:00:35.130> and<00:00:35.600> I<00:00:36.600> I<00:00:37.309> just<00:00:38.309> want<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.489> be<00:00:38.579> sure<00:00:38.820> but

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
file and I I just want to be sure but

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.900 
file and I I just want to be sure but
I've<00:00:39.960> created<00:00:40.290> one<00:00:40.680> that<00:00:41.100> already<00:00:41.309> cycles

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
I've created one that already cycles

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.170 
I've created one that already cycles
based<00:00:42.600> on<00:00:42.809> this<00:00:42.989> controller<00:00:43.579> so<00:00:44.579> what<00:00:45.090> I'm

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
based on this controller so what I'm

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.209 
based on this controller so what I'm
going<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.360> do<00:00:45.510> here<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:45.899> he'll<00:00:46.469> he'll<00:00:46.890> notice

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
going to do here and he'll he'll notice

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.750 
going to do here and he'll he'll notice
that<00:00:47.730> he's<00:00:48.270> missing<00:00:48.510> some<00:00:48.780> few<00:00:49.550> threads<00:00:50.550> here

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
that he's missing some few threads here

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.639 
that he's missing some few threads here
I've<00:00:50.969> hidden<00:00:51.210> them<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:51.930> make<00:00:52.110> it<00:00:52.260> easier<00:00:52.620> to

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
I've hidden them to make it easier to

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.750 
I've hidden them to make it easier to
see<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:54.260> another<00:00:55.260> thing<00:00:55.500> you<00:00:55.829> had<00:00:56.160> was<00:00:56.579> you

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
see and another thing you had was you

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.270 
see and another thing you had was you
had<00:00:56.910> some<00:00:57.180> bones<00:00:57.449> as<00:00:57.960> well<00:00:58.170> as<00:00:58.320> stuff<00:00:59.010> in<00:00:59.129> the

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
had some bones as well as stuff in the

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.630 
had some bones as well as stuff in the
sashayed<00:00:59.670> so<00:01:00.629> if<00:01:00.960> I<00:01:01.079> select<00:01:01.680> these<00:01:01.980> hypershade

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
sashayed so if I select these hypershade

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.609 
sashayed so if I select these hypershade
windows<00:01:03.059> I'm<00:01:03.539> not<00:01:03.719> exactly<00:01:03.989> sure<00:01:04.320> what<00:01:04.350> you

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
windows I'm not exactly sure what you

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:05.630 
windows I'm not exactly sure what you
were<00:01:04.710> going<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:04.860> do<00:01:05.040> with<00:01:05.159> all<00:01:05.280> this

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
were going to do with all this

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.300 
were going to do with all this
is<00:01:05.729> he<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:05.939> rigid<00:01:06.299> bodies<00:01:07.470> typically<00:01:07.950> rigid

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
is he a rigid bodies typically rigid

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.950 
is he a rigid bodies typically rigid
bodies<00:01:08.549> are<00:01:08.670> used<00:01:08.880> for<00:01:09.060> dynamics<00:01:09.600> such<00:01:09.780> as

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
bodies are used for dynamics such as

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.039 
bodies are used for dynamics such as
particles<00:01:10.430> explosions<00:01:11.430> and<00:01:11.900> contact<00:01:12.900> on

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
particles explosions and contact on

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.800 
particles explosions and contact on
contact<00:01:13.560> meshes<00:01:14.010> forming<00:01:14.430> collisions<00:01:14.850> so<00:01:15.600> I'm

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
contact meshes forming collisions so I'm

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.090 
contact meshes forming collisions so I'm
not<00:01:15.900> exactly<00:01:16.140> sure<00:01:16.409> what<00:01:16.530> he<00:01:16.710> was<00:01:16.799> going<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:16.950> do

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
not exactly sure what he was going to do

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.950 
not exactly sure what he was going to do
that<00:01:17.340> probably<00:01:17.640> something<00:01:18.150> if<00:01:18.509> I<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.659> guess

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
that probably something if I the guess

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.200 
that probably something if I the guess
would<00:01:19.680> be<00:01:19.799> something<00:01:20.189> with<00:01:20.400> deformations

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
would be something with deformations

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.820 
would be something with deformations
however<00:01:22.200> prevented<00:01:22.650> me<00:01:22.770> from<00:01:23.600> actually

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
however prevented me from actually

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.940 
however prevented me from actually
creating<00:01:25.830> this<00:01:25.950> to<00:01:26.130> rotate<00:01:26.490> properly<00:01:26.970> because

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
creating this to rotate properly because

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.920 
creating this to rotate properly because
of<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.310> way<00:01:29.400> we<00:01:29.610> set<00:01:29.850> up<00:01:29.880> so<00:01:30.479> I'm<00:01:30.600> not<00:01:30.720> exactly

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
of the way we set up so I'm not exactly

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.210 
of the way we set up so I'm not exactly
sure<00:01:31.110> what<00:01:31.200> you're<00:01:31.439> going<00:01:31.500> to<00:01:31.590> do<00:01:31.710> that<00:01:31.890> so<00:01:32.100> if

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
sure what you're going to do that so if

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.530 
sure what you're going to do that so if
you're<00:01:32.369> going<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.549> do<00:01:33.000> something<00:01:33.180> with<00:01:33.420> it<00:01:33.509> you

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
you're going to do something with it you

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.440 
you're going to do something with it you
can<00:01:33.810> edit<00:01:34.710> it<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:35.369> your<00:01:35.520> liking<00:01:35.700> after<00:01:36.210> you<00:01:36.329> do

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
can edit it to your liking after you do

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.060 
can edit it to your liking after you do
this<00:01:37.310> so<00:01:38.310> anyway<00:01:39.079> first<00:01:40.079> of<00:01:40.259> all<00:01:40.350> as<00:01:40.590> you<00:01:40.979> can

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
this so anyway first of all as you can

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.179 
this so anyway first of all as you can
see<00:01:41.159> I<00:01:41.189> do<00:01:41.400> have<00:01:41.790> one<00:01:42.090> that<00:01:42.240> is<00:01:42.299> cycling<00:01:43.189> your

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
see I do have one that is cycling your

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.010 
see I do have one that is cycling your
curve<00:01:44.520> isn't<00:01:45.090> showing<00:01:45.329> up<00:01:45.630> here

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
curve isn't showing up here

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.679 
curve isn't showing up here
I<00:01:46.799> want<00:01:47.189> to<00:01:47.280> guess<00:01:47.460> it's<00:01:47.729> connected<00:01:48.180> but<00:01:48.390> I'm

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
I want to guess it's connected but I'm

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.889 
I want to guess it's connected but I'm
not<00:01:48.990> sure<00:01:49.530> it<00:01:49.799> just<00:01:49.829> it<00:01:50.340> might<00:01:50.490> be<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:50.670> UI<00:01:51.180> I<00:01:51.689> get

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
not sure it just it might be a UI I get

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.139 
not sure it just it might be a UI I get
that<00:01:51.990> a<00:01:52.049> lot<00:01:52.110> so<00:01:52.470> if<00:01:53.040> it<00:01:53.130> is<00:01:53.250> in<00:01:53.460> fact<00:01:53.579> connected

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
that a lot so if it is in fact connected

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.429 
that a lot so if it is in fact connected
which<00:01:54.270> it<00:01:54.420> looks<00:01:54.540> like<00:01:54.659> it<00:01:54.810> is<00:01:55.079> because<00:01:55.320> it

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
which it looks like it is because it

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.770 
which it looks like it is because it
goes<00:01:55.649> past<00:01:55.890> it<00:01:56.189> then<00:01:57.950> um<00:01:58.969> then<00:01:59.969> it<00:02:00.060> should<00:02:00.689> be

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
goes past it then um then it should be

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.959 
goes past it then um then it should be
okay<00:02:01.020> so<00:02:01.079> first<00:02:01.860> of<00:02:01.950> all<00:02:02.009> make<00:02:02.250> sure<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.640> path

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
okay so first of all make sure the path

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.350 
okay so first of all make sure the path
is<00:02:03.149> continuous<00:02:03.689> and<00:02:04.460> secondly<00:02:05.460> I'm<00:02:06.090> going<00:02:06.299> to

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
is continuous and secondly I'm going to

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.029 
is continuous and secondly I'm going to
I've<00:02:06.899> got<00:02:07.320> this<00:02:08.030> extra<00:02:09.140> thread<00:02:10.140> I've<00:02:10.500> broken

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
I've got this extra thread I've broken

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.010 
I've got this extra thread I've broken
the<00:02:11.790> connections<00:02:12.480> so

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
the connections so

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.990 
the connections so
it<00:02:13.080> doesn't<00:02:13.320> have<00:02:13.470> any<00:02:13.650> of<00:02:13.770> your<00:02:14.000> high

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
it doesn't have any of your high

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.550 
it doesn't have any of your high
pressure<00:02:15.180> shaded<00:02:15.660> it<00:02:15.960> doesn't<00:02:16.260> have<00:02:16.350> any<00:02:16.470> of

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
pressure shaded it doesn't have any of

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.100 
pressure shaded it doesn't have any of
this<00:02:16.710> I<00:02:16.890> just<00:02:17.280> deleted<00:02:17.850> the<00:02:17.880> rigidbody<00:02:18.210> got

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
this I just deleted the rigidbody got

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.530 
this I just deleted the rigidbody got
rid<00:02:19.260> of<00:02:19.320> it<00:02:19.670> and<00:02:20.670> don't<00:02:21.150> know<00:02:21.210> what<00:02:21.420> you're

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
rid of it and don't know what you're

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.290 
rid of it and don't know what you're
going<00:02:21.660> to<00:02:21.690> do<00:02:21.780> with<00:02:21.870> that<00:02:21.990> but<00:02:22.740> so<00:02:23.700> first<00:02:24.150> I'm

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
going to do with that but so first I'm

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.850 
going to do with that but so first I'm
going<00:02:24.420> to<00:02:24.510> assign<00:02:25.020> it<00:02:25.050> to<00:02:25.200> the<00:02:25.380> motion<00:02:25.680> path

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
going to assign it to the motion path

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.380 
going to assign it to the motion path
which<00:02:26.750> is<00:02:27.750> right<00:02:28.560> here<00:02:28.670> animate<00:02:29.670> motion<00:02:30.240> path

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
which is right here animate motion path

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.840 
which is right here animate motion path
attached<00:02:31.050> motion<00:02:31.500> path<00:02:31.680> and<00:02:31.950> it<00:02:32.610> kind<00:02:32.790> of

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
attached motion path and it kind of

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.420 
attached motion path and it kind of
comes<00:02:33.180> off<00:02:33.300> wonky<00:02:33.780> so<00:02:34.530> first<00:02:35.100> thing<00:02:35.250> I'm<00:02:35.340> going

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
comes off wonky so first thing I'm going

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.770 
comes off wonky so first thing I'm going
to<00:02:35.490> do<00:02:35.580> is<00:02:35.700> I'm<00:02:35.790> going<00:02:35.820> to<00:02:35.940> fix<00:02:36.270> that<00:02:36.510> and

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
to do is I'm going to fix that and

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.440 
to do is I'm going to fix that and
whether<00:02:37.290> the<00:02:37.530> motion<00:02:37.680> path<00:02:38.040> world<00:02:38.550> up<00:02:38.880> type

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
whether the motion path world up type

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.200 
whether the motion path world up type
vector<00:02:40.140> I'm<00:02:41.010> going<00:02:41.160> to<00:02:41.220> make<00:02:41.310> this<00:02:41.490> zero<00:02:41.850> and

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
vector I'm going to make this zero and

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:47.120 
vector I'm going to make this zero and
see<00:02:42.420> how<00:02:42.510> the<00:02:44.780> actual<00:02:45.980> influences<00:02:46.980> are

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
see how the actual influences are

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.500 
see how the actual influences are
occurring<00:02:48.030> and<00:02:49.070> ok<00:02:50.070> so<00:02:50.250> I<00:02:50.370> got<00:02:50.670> it<00:02:50.820> flat<00:02:51.150> now<00:02:51.180> I

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
occurring and ok so I got it flat now I

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.620 
occurring and ok so I got it flat now I
need<00:02:51.690> to<00:02:51.780> twist<00:02:52.020> it<00:02:52.290> so<00:02:52.680> I<00:02:53.100> get<00:02:53.790> the<00:02:53.970> side<00:02:54.240> twist

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
need to twist it so I get the side twist

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:00.250 
need to twist it so I get the side twist
by<00:02:54.990> 90<00:02:55.530> no<00:02:56.280> not<00:02:56.640> that<00:02:56.850> one<00:02:57.090> this<00:02:58.050> one<00:02:58.290> yes<00:02:59.070> okay

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
by 90 no not that one this one yes okay

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.060 
by 90 no not that one this one yes okay
so<00:03:01.260> now<00:03:01.350> that<00:03:01.470> I<00:03:01.530> have<00:03:01.650> then<00:03:01.770> I'm<00:03:01.830> going<00:03:01.950> to<00:03:02.010> go

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
so now that I have then I'm going to go

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:03.710 
so now that I have then I'm going to go
to<00:03:02.160> the<00:03:02.280> channel<00:03:02.550> box<00:03:02.700> and<00:03:03.000> go<00:03:03.150> down<00:03:03.330> to<00:03:03.360> the

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
to the channel box and go down to the

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.400 
to the channel box and go down to the
motion<00:03:04.170> path<00:03:04.350> and<00:03:04.680> the<00:03:05.490> UV<00:03:05.880> u<00:03:06.330> value<00:03:06.810> I'm<00:03:07.080> going

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
motion path and the UV u value I'm going

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.140 
motion path and the UV u value I'm going
to<00:03:07.530> break<00:03:07.800> the<00:03:08.100> connections<00:03:08.580> so<00:03:08.880> it's<00:03:09.000> no

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
to break the connections so it's no

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.940 
to break the connections so it's no
longer<00:03:09.180> keyframed<00:03:09.870> because<00:03:10.470> essentially

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
longer keyframed because essentially

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.240 
longer keyframed because essentially
they<00:03:11.160> all<00:03:11.310> that<00:03:11.520> is<00:03:11.640> it's<00:03:11.880> just<00:03:11.940> a<00:03:12.090> key<00:03:12.240> frame

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
they all that is it's just a key frame

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.810 
they all that is it's just a key frame
now<00:03:14.250> I'm<00:03:14.490> going<00:03:14.760> to<00:03:15.710> grab<00:03:16.710> the<00:03:16.920> U<00:03:17.160> value<00:03:17.400> and

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
now I'm going to grab the U value and

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.090 
now I'm going to grab the U value and
move<00:03:18.330> it<00:03:18.540> into<00:03:18.750> position<00:03:19.080> which<00:03:19.770> I'm<00:03:20.040> just

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
move it into position which I'm just

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.500 
move it into position which I'm just
going<00:03:20.490> to<00:03:20.520> guess<00:03:20.700> and<00:03:20.940> say<00:03:21.060> it's<00:03:21.209> not<00:03:21.300> right

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
going to guess and say it's not right

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.290 
going to guess and say it's not right
there<00:03:21.720> and<00:03:22.400> I'm<00:03:23.400> going<00:03:23.520> to<00:03:23.610> grab<00:03:24.060> my<00:03:24.180> little

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 
there and I'm going to grab my little

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:29.090 
there and I'm going to grab my little
controller<00:03:24.740> here<00:03:25.740> I'm<00:03:26.250> going<00:03:26.970> to<00:03:27.890> select<00:03:28.890> them

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
controller here I'm going to select them

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:34.460 
controller here I'm going to select them
to<00:03:29.400> go<00:03:30.180> to<00:03:30.240> the<00:03:32.150> set<00:03:33.150> driven<00:03:33.630> key<00:03:33.810> it's<00:03:34.290> under

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
to go to the set driven key it's under

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:35.870 
to go to the set driven key it's under
animate<00:03:34.830> set<00:03:35.070> driving<00:03:35.340> keys

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
animate set driving keys

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.310 
animate set driving keys
pull<00:03:36.870> up<00:03:36.959> my<00:03:37.110> window<00:03:37.530> and<00:03:38.930> load<00:03:39.930> the<00:03:40.080> driver

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
pull up my window and load the driver

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:45.140 
pull up my window and load the driver
the<00:03:40.770> circle's<00:03:41.130> driver<00:03:42.470> the<00:03:43.580> tread<00:03:44.580> is<00:03:44.730> the

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
the circle's driver the tread is the

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.740 
the circle's driver the tread is the
driven<00:03:45.510> and<00:03:46.250> select<00:03:47.250> the<00:03:47.459> motion<00:03:48.090> path<00:03:48.270> and

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
driven and select the motion path and

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.750 
driven and select the motion path and
reload<00:03:49.170> it<00:03:49.320> so<00:03:49.770> you<00:03:49.860> get<00:03:50.010> the<00:03:50.100> motion<00:03:50.250> path<00:03:50.550> in

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
reload it so you get the motion path in

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.810 
reload it so you get the motion path in
the<00:03:50.880> u-value<00:03:51.500> okay<00:03:52.500> so<00:03:52.560> now<00:03:52.890> the<00:03:52.950> you<00:03:53.370> value<00:03:53.730> is

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
the u-value okay so now the you value is

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.850 
the u-value okay so now the you value is
set<00:03:54.060> to<00:03:54.090> point<00:03:54.570> zero<00:03:54.900> five<00:03:55.140> I<00:03:55.410> can<00:03:55.590> set<00:03:55.740> the

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 
set to point zero five I can set the

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.510 
set to point zero five I can set the
neutral<00:03:56.190> position<00:03:56.580> so<00:03:56.760> I'm<00:03:57.360> going<00:03:57.540> to<00:03:57.600> set

00:03:58.510 --> 00:03:58.520 
neutral position so I'm going to set

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
neutral position so I'm going to set
this<00:03:59.520> circle<00:04:00.000> is<00:04:00.180> rotating<00:04:00.900> around<00:04:01.230> the<00:04:02.030> X<00:04:03.030> as

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
this circle is rotating around the X as

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.360 
this circle is rotating around the X as
you<00:04:03.870> can<00:04:03.990> see<00:04:04.170> I'll<00:04:04.890> make<00:04:05.070> that<00:04:05.220> a<00:04:05.280> little

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
you can see I'll make that a little

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.360 
you can see I'll make that a little
bigger<00:04:05.640> so<00:04:06.080> as<00:04:07.080> you<00:04:07.200> can<00:04:07.320> see<00:04:07.470> if<00:04:07.860> I<00:04:07.950> rotate<00:04:08.340> it

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
bigger so as you can see if I rotate it

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:09.020 
bigger so as you can see if I rotate it
this<00:04:08.580> way

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
this way

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.680 
this way
that's<00:04:09.570> the<00:04:09.810> rotate<00:04:10.260> X<00:04:10.470> so<00:04:11.250> rotate<00:04:11.850> X<00:04:12.030> and<00:04:12.270> you

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
that's the rotate X so rotate X and you

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.090 
that's the rotate X so rotate X and you
V<00:04:12.870> value<00:04:13.200> and<00:04:13.530> I'm<00:04:14.520> going<00:04:14.550> to<00:04:14.760> key<00:04:15.290> then<00:04:16.290> what

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
V value and I'm going to key then what

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.380 
V value and I'm going to key then what
I'm<00:04:17.190> going<00:04:17.310> to<00:04:17.340> do<00:04:17.459> I'm<00:04:17.820> going<00:04:17.940> to<00:04:18.030> take<00:04:18.180> this

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390 
I'm going to do I'm going to take this

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.479 
I'm going to do I'm going to take this
and<00:04:18.690> I'm<00:04:19.230> going<00:04:19.320> to<00:04:19.410> go<00:04:19.470> to<00:04:19.530> the<00:04:19.680> max<00:04:20.190> position

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
and I'm going to go to the max position

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.600 
and I'm going to go to the max position
value<00:04:21.080> which

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
value which

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:31.200 
value which
see<00:04:24.610> I<00:04:25.259> want<00:04:26.259> it<00:04:26.410> to<00:04:26.560> be<00:04:29.610> let's<00:04:30.610> just<00:04:30.729> make<00:04:31.060> it

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
see I want it to be let's just make it

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.719 
see I want it to be let's just make it
like<00:04:31.330> a<00:04:31.389> roughly<00:04:31.870> right<00:04:32.080> there<00:04:32.520> okay

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:33.729 
like a roughly right there okay

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:37.110 
like a roughly right there okay
so<00:04:34.060> that's<00:04:34.240> point<00:04:34.600> 99<00:04:35.169> and<00:04:35.860> I'm<00:04:36.759> going<00:04:36.910> to<00:04:36.940> key

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
so that's point 99 and I'm going to key

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.960 
so that's point 99 and I'm going to key
that<00:04:37.560> all<00:04:38.560> right<00:04:38.680> what<00:04:38.830> I'm<00:04:38.919> gonna<00:04:39.009> get<00:04:39.220> is<00:04:39.460> I'm

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:39.970 
that all right what I'm gonna get is I'm

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:46.110 
that all right what I'm gonna get is I'm
actually<00:04:40.090> going<00:04:40.419> to<00:04:40.509> get<00:04:40.660> um<00:04:44.639> do<00:04:45.639> that<00:04:45.789> not<00:04:45.940> key

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
actually going to get um do that not key

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:54.090 
actually going to get um do that not key
I<00:04:46.330> don't<00:04:46.419> think<00:04:46.750> I<00:04:46.840> keyed<00:04:52.590> let<00:04:53.590> me<00:04:53.650> hide<00:04:53.889> the

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:54.100 
I don't think I keyed let me hide the

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:59.279 
I don't think I keyed let me hide the
other<00:04:54.280> one<00:04:55.110> on<00:04:56.110> the<00:04:56.470> motion<00:04:56.830> path<00:04:57.070> one<00:04:57.510> so<00:04:58.510> let

00:04:59.279 --> 00:04:59.289 
other one on the motion path one so let

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:02.400 
other one on the motion path one so let
me<00:04:59.380> hide<00:04:59.590> this<00:04:59.860> one<00:05:00.070> okay<00:05:00.910> so<00:05:01.229> let's<00:05:02.229> see<00:05:02.380> that

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:02.410 
me hide this one okay so let's see that

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:06.000 
me hide this one okay so let's see that
key<00:05:04.889> Saro

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.010 
key Saro

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:12.930 
key Saro
oops<00:05:06.600> okay<00:05:07.600> um<00:05:08.470> so<00:05:09.220> now<00:05:09.669> I<00:05:10.110> should<00:05:11.789> that<00:05:12.789> one's

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:12.940 
oops okay um so now I should that one's

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.089 
oops okay um so now I should that one's
not<00:05:13.090> moving<00:05:13.449> so<00:05:13.840> the<00:05:13.990> neutral<00:05:14.320> position<00:05:14.470> did

00:05:15.089 --> 00:05:15.099 
not moving so the neutral position did

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:16.560 
not moving so the neutral position did
not<00:05:15.130> get<00:05:15.430> set<00:05:15.639> right<00:05:15.880> so<00:05:16.120> I'm<00:05:16.240> going<00:05:16.389> to<00:05:16.419> go

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.570 
not get set right so I'm going to go

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:18.750 
not get set right so I'm going to go
point<00:05:17.050> zero<00:05:17.349> five<00:05:17.650> back<00:05:18.190> over<00:05:18.550> here<00:05:18.699> because

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:18.760 
point zero five back over here because

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.659 
point zero five back over here because
that<00:05:19.060> was<00:05:19.240> the<00:05:19.479> u-value<00:05:20.169> I'm<00:05:20.919> gonna<00:05:21.070> key<00:05:21.430> this

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:21.669 
that was the u-value I'm gonna key this

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:29.870 
that was the u-value I'm gonna key this
again<00:05:24.330> okay<00:05:26.190> and<00:05:27.190> it's<00:05:27.520> still<00:05:27.580> not<00:05:27.820> moving

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:29.880 
again okay and it's still not moving

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:37.219 
again okay and it's still not moving
so<00:05:31.199> point<00:05:32.199> nine<00:05:32.349> nine<00:05:33.120> and<00:05:34.120> then<00:05:34.419> I'll<00:05:34.630> key<00:05:35.970> off

00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:37.229 
so point nine nine and then I'll key off

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:39.960 
so point nine nine and then I'll key off
that's<00:05:38.229> why<00:05:38.530> I'm<00:05:38.800> such<00:05:39.520> an<00:05:39.669> idiot

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:39.970 
that's why I'm such an idiot

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:43.189 
that's why I'm such an idiot
I<00:05:40.030> forgot<00:05:40.240> the<00:05:40.389> rotate<00:05:40.900> the<00:05:41.320> controller<00:05:41.650> I

00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:43.199 
I forgot the rotate the controller I

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:45.450 
I forgot the rotate the controller I
forgot<00:05:44.199> to<00:05:44.289> rotate<00:05:44.650> the<00:05:44.770> controller<00:05:45.099> before<00:05:45.280> I

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:45.460 
forgot to rotate the controller before I

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:48.810 
forgot to rotate the controller before I
tweaked<00:05:46.210> the<00:05:46.240> motion<00:05:46.659> path<00:05:46.840> so<00:05:47.530> now<00:05:48.340> let's<00:05:48.639> do

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:48.820 
tweaked the motion path so now let's do

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.659 
tweaked the motion path so now let's do
this<00:05:48.880> again<00:05:49.289> all<00:05:50.289> right<00:05:50.470> so<00:05:50.860> I'll<00:05:51.250> key<00:05:51.430> this

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:51.669 
this again all right so I'll key this

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:55.320 
this again all right so I'll key this
and<00:05:53.280> now<00:05:54.280> what<00:05:54.699> I<00:05:54.729> should<00:05:55.000> get

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:55.330 
and now what I should get

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:57.810 
and now what I should get
yes<00:05:55.570> I<00:05:55.870> should<00:05:56.380> get<00:05:56.530> a<00:05:56.560> movement<00:05:56.830> all<00:05:57.669> right

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:57.820 
yes I should get a movement all right

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:04.170 
yes I should get a movement all right
now<00:05:58.570> the<00:05:59.020> first<00:05:59.229> one<00:05:59.500> won't<00:06:02.970> looks<00:06:03.970> like<00:06:04.060> it's

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:04.180 
now the first one won't looks like it's

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:07.589 
now the first one won't looks like it's
catching<00:06:04.330> up<00:06:04.570> to<00:06:04.780> it<00:06:04.900> but<00:06:06.030> you<00:06:07.030> can<00:06:07.210> always<00:06:07.330> fix

00:06:07.589 --> 00:06:07.599 
catching up to it but you can always fix

00:06:07.599 --> 00:06:11.159 
catching up to it but you can always fix
that<00:06:08.669> it's<00:06:09.669> it's<00:06:10.030> not<00:06:10.240> continuing<00:06:10.930> like<00:06:11.110> this

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:11.169 
that it's it's not continuing like this

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:13.230 
that it's it's not continuing like this
one<00:06:11.560> is<00:06:11.680> now<00:06:12.310> there's<00:06:12.580> a<00:06:12.639> special<00:06:13.000> feature

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:13.240 
one is now there's a special feature

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.029 
one is now there's a special feature
within<00:06:13.960> the<00:06:14.050> graph<00:06:14.229> it<00:06:14.380> because<00:06:14.740> essentially

00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:15.039 
within the graph it because essentially

00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:17.700 
within the graph it because essentially
that<00:06:15.430> what<00:06:15.760> this<00:06:15.909> is<00:06:16.060> is<00:06:16.300> these<00:06:16.810> are<00:06:17.050> actual

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:17.710 
that what this is is these are actual

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:19.800 
that what this is is these are actual
keyframes<00:06:18.190> and<00:06:18.430> when<00:06:19.360> you<00:06:19.449> set<00:06:19.599> the<00:06:19.690> motion

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:19.810 
keyframes and when you set the motion

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:21.480 
keyframes and when you set the motion
path<00:06:20.110> I<00:06:20.320> could<00:06:20.440> click<00:06:20.620> play<00:06:20.919> and<00:06:20.949> it<00:06:21.220> will<00:06:21.280> just

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:21.490 
path I could click play and it will just

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:23.129 
path I could click play and it will just
follow<00:06:22.000> the<00:06:22.240> motion<00:06:22.510> path<00:06:22.690> throughout<00:06:22.990> the

00:06:23.129 --> 00:06:23.139 
follow the motion path throughout the

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:27.110 
follow the motion path throughout the
time<00:06:23.470> slider<00:06:23.800> but<00:06:24.789> if<00:06:25.210> you<00:06:25.479> go<00:06:25.659> to<00:06:25.720> the

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:27.120 
time slider but if you go to the

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.250 
time slider but if you go to the
animation<00:06:28.120> editors<00:06:28.449> and<00:06:28.630> go<00:06:28.690> down<00:06:28.930> to<00:06:29.139> that

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:29.260 
animation editors and go down to that

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.100 
animation editors and go down to that
editor<00:06:29.590> you'll<00:06:30.250> see<00:06:30.460> a<00:06:30.729> line<00:06:31.120> like<00:06:31.690> this<00:06:31.870> and

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:32.110 
editor you'll see a line like this and

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:35.519 
editor you'll see a line like this and
what<00:06:32.889> I've<00:06:33.039> done<00:06:33.250> is<00:06:33.520> I've<00:06:34.270> turned<00:06:34.719> on

00:06:35.519 --> 00:06:35.529 
what I've done is I've turned on

00:06:35.529 --> 00:06:37.499 
what I've done is I've turned on
call<00:06:36.249> it<00:06:36.339> something<00:06:36.609> called<00:06:36.759> infinity<00:06:37.239> it's

00:06:37.499 --> 00:06:37.509 
call it something called infinity it's

00:06:37.509 --> 00:06:40.469 
call it something called infinity it's
in<00:06:37.659> view<00:06:38.199> committee<00:06:39.009> and<00:06:39.279> then<00:06:40.059> you<00:06:40.209> go<00:06:40.359> over

00:06:40.469 --> 00:06:40.479 
in view committee and then you go over

00:06:40.479 --> 00:06:43.379 
in view committee and then you go over
to<00:06:40.569> the<00:06:40.779> curves<00:06:41.079> and<00:06:41.469> you<00:06:41.529> go<00:06:42.219> to<00:06:42.279> pre<00:06:42.789> infinity

00:06:43.379 --> 00:06:43.389 
to the curves and you go to pre infinity

00:06:43.389 --> 00:06:45.059 
to the curves and you go to pre infinity
and<00:06:43.599> there's<00:06:43.959> these<00:06:44.109> lists<00:06:44.379> of<00:06:44.499> options

00:06:45.059 --> 00:06:45.069 
and there's these lists of options

00:06:45.069 --> 00:06:47.929 
and there's these lists of options
each<00:06:45.819> one<00:06:46.089> of<00:06:46.119> the<00:06:46.209> OP<00:06:46.359> options<00:06:47.169> are<00:06:47.319> different

00:06:47.929 --> 00:06:47.939 
each one of the OP options are different

00:06:47.939 --> 00:06:50.339 
each one of the OP options are different
for<00:06:48.939> walk<00:06:49.119> cycles<00:06:49.569> and<00:06:49.689> stuff<00:06:49.929> like<00:06:50.079> if<00:06:50.229> you're

00:06:50.339 --> 00:06:50.349 
for walk cycles and stuff like if you're

00:06:50.349 --> 00:06:51.989 
for walk cycles and stuff like if you're
creating<00:06:50.649> a<00:06:50.679> sine<00:06:50.919> wave<00:06:50.949> you<00:06:51.429> use<00:06:51.639> and<00:06:51.849> also

00:06:51.989 --> 00:06:51.999 
creating a sine wave you use and also

00:06:51.999 --> 00:06:54.239 
creating a sine wave you use and also
late<00:06:52.299> but<00:06:53.049> what<00:06:53.589> we're<00:06:53.709> going<00:06:53.829> to<00:06:53.859> do<00:06:54.009> is<00:06:54.129> we're

00:06:54.239 --> 00:06:54.249 
late but what we're going to do is we're

00:06:54.249 --> 00:06:56.309 
late but what we're going to do is we're
going<00:06:54.279> to<00:06:54.399> have<00:06:54.489> a<00:06:54.549> cycle<00:06:55.089> and<00:06:55.329> so<00:06:56.109> what

00:06:56.309 --> 00:06:56.319 
going to have a cycle and so what

00:06:56.319 --> 00:06:58.169 
going to have a cycle and so what
essentially<00:06:56.679> does<00:06:57.039> is<00:06:57.249> we're<00:06:57.789> going<00:06:57.879> to<00:06:57.939> set

00:06:58.169 --> 00:06:58.179 
essentially does is we're going to set

00:06:58.179 --> 00:07:00.119 
essentially does is we're going to set
both<00:06:58.419> of<00:06:58.599> those<00:06:58.689> cycles<00:06:59.379> and<00:06:59.559> you<00:06:59.709> can<00:06:59.889> see

00:07:00.119 --> 00:07:00.129 
both of those cycles and you can see

00:07:00.129 --> 00:07:02.999 
both of those cycles and you can see
that<00:07:00.879> we<00:07:01.479> get<00:07:01.629> this<00:07:01.779> line<00:07:02.109> that's<00:07:02.469> constant

00:07:02.999 --> 00:07:03.009 
that we get this line that's constant

00:07:03.009 --> 00:07:05.099 
that we get this line that's constant
this<00:07:03.519> dotted<00:07:03.999> line<00:07:04.179> just<00:07:04.209> means<00:07:04.509> that<00:07:04.809> this

00:07:05.099 --> 00:07:05.109 
this dotted line just means that this

00:07:05.109 --> 00:07:07.139 
this dotted line just means that this
point<00:07:05.499> starts<00:07:05.949> immediately<00:07:06.699> right<00:07:06.909> here

00:07:07.139 --> 00:07:07.149 
point starts immediately right here

00:07:07.149 --> 00:07:08.969 
point starts immediately right here
after<00:07:07.509> so<00:07:07.659> it's<00:07:07.809> not<00:07:07.989> like<00:07:08.229> a<00:07:08.259> straight<00:07:08.649> tip

00:07:08.969 --> 00:07:08.979 
after so it's not like a straight tip

00:07:08.979 --> 00:07:12.029 
after so it's not like a straight tip
and<00:07:09.249> now<00:07:10.119> when<00:07:10.539> I<00:07:10.629> turn<00:07:10.809> the<00:07:10.899> controller<00:07:11.229> it

00:07:12.029 --> 00:07:12.039 
and now when I turn the controller it

00:07:12.039 --> 00:07:18.869 
and now when I turn the controller it
should<00:07:12.369> be<00:07:12.519> infinite<00:07:14.519> which<00:07:15.519> it<00:07:15.969> is<00:07:17.879> alright

00:07:18.869 --> 00:07:18.879 
should be infinite which it is alright

00:07:18.879 --> 00:07:21.779 
should be infinite which it is alright
so<00:07:19.349> that's<00:07:20.349> how<00:07:20.409> you<00:07:20.499> make<00:07:20.679> it<00:07:20.709> infinite<00:07:21.399> you

00:07:21.779 --> 00:07:21.789 
so that's how you make it infinite you

00:07:21.789 --> 00:07:23.279 
so that's how you make it infinite you
know<00:07:21.909> just<00:07:22.179> small<00:07:22.689> tweak<00:07:22.929> in<00:07:23.049> the<00:07:23.109> graph

00:07:23.279 --> 00:07:23.289 
know just small tweak in the graph

00:07:23.289 --> 00:07:26.359 
know just small tweak in the graph
editor<00:07:23.409> infinity

00:07:26.359 --> 00:07:26.369 

00:07:26.369 --> 00:07:30.809 

that's<00:07:27.369> my<00:07:27.669> script<00:07:28.029> slightly<00:07:28.629> ignore<00:07:28.839> that<00:07:29.819> so

00:07:30.809 --> 00:07:30.819 
that's my script slightly ignore that so

00:07:30.819 --> 00:07:32.459 
that's my script slightly ignore that so
yeah<00:07:30.939> it's<00:07:31.299> just<00:07:31.359> the<00:07:31.599> brief<00:07:31.899> and<00:07:32.259> post

00:07:32.459 --> 00:07:32.469 
yeah it's just the brief and post

00:07:32.469 --> 00:07:35.279 
yeah it's just the brief and post
infinity<00:07:32.889> I<00:07:33.549> hope<00:07:33.909> that<00:07:34.059> helps<00:07:34.329> and<00:07:34.659> good<00:07:35.019> luck

00:07:35.279 --> 00:07:35.289 
infinity I hope that helps and good luck

00:07:35.289 --> 00:07:38.339 
infinity I hope that helps and good luck
with<00:07:35.589> that<00:07:35.619> whatever<00:07:36.039> you're<00:07:36.189> doing
