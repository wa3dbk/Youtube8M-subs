00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:11.710
 hello how about friends due to vÃ¡zquez them 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.180
 speaks his friend Rafael Sandoval ex 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:14.799
 professional player selected ex 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.260
 national and now coach of 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:19.450
 basketball then I will tell you a 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:23.300
 exercise a little more complicated where 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:25.310
 we involve address changes 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:28.449
 and cross between the legs cross by 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.449
 front and cost from the back 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.370
 to do a cross we must 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:39.160
 have a balanced posture yes 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.469
 in our center of gravity a little 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.260
 down to be able to have much greater 

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:46.960
 control and protect the ball from a 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.180
 adversary if there are several changes of 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.790
 direction in basketball one of them 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:56.120
 it is ahead how this should be done 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:01:00.860
 in a way where our body 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:04.400
 and the boat controls our movement and 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:06.380
 protect from the adversary if we 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.840
 we make a very high pot we expose the 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.210
 ball since the travel time of the 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.820
 ball to the ground and ground to the 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.490
 hand is more here if we bend over 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:19.009
 this way if the ball has to pass 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:22.040
 below the knee so you can 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:25.009
 analyze any balloon theft if the 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.930
 change between the legs is similar 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:29.060
 this movement does not expose both the ball 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.670
 and it's safer but it's a little bit more 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.860
 complicated to do it since it is required 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:37.070
 of much more control of the ball and the 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:40.100
 body if this way is how you get 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:42.020
 and you stop turning the whole body to 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.990
 control in the position and you pass the 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.479
 you expose it and take it out of control 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.750
 of the player if another of the changes of 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:52.700
 directions is behind this change 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.920
 logically does not expose the ball at all 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.560
 because our body comes before 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.470
 the defender and the ball if it's the same 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.670
 situation we lower the hip a bit to 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.439
 have more control 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.229
 the waist moves and the ball passes through 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:07.939
 behind us in this way the 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.700
 prepare to leave for any of 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:13.640
 the two directions we need the 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:16.880
 last change of direction is turning 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.250
 here we lose a little bit of sight at 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.500
 defensive and that makes us expose ourselves 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.650
 since if it's a little more skillful than 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.660
 we can steal the ball but if 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.610
 we follow the same rules without exposing 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.010
 the ball going down the hip and we do it 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.170
 in a faster way we have a good 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.360
 change of address I recommend you 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.160
 do these exercises at least two 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.350
 or three times a week with the 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.060
 supervision of a trainer remember 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.769
 that being corrected makes 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.060
 better and what perfection is the 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:46.060
 movement until soon
