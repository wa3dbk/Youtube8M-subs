love this it's absolutely crazy it's you
know<00:00:23.310> everything<00:00:23.760> is<00:00:23.789> where<00:00:23.970> you<00:00:24.060> expect<00:00:24.420> it

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
know everything is where you expect it

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.390 
know everything is where you expect it
to<00:00:24.570> be<00:00:24.779> but<00:00:24.990> not<00:00:25.230> quite<00:00:25.560> everything's<00:00:26.189> a

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
to be but not quite everything's a

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.660 
to be but not quite everything's a
little<00:00:26.730> bit<00:00:27.029> different<00:00:27.570> you<00:00:27.750> know<00:00:27.960> things<00:00:28.260> on

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:28.670 
little bit different you know things on

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.130 
little bit different you know things on
where<00:00:29.670> they<00:00:29.849> seem<00:00:30.119> to<00:00:30.150> be<00:00:30.390> it<00:00:30.689> makes<00:00:30.900> it<00:00:31.050> look

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
where they seem to be it makes it look

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.600 
where they seem to be it makes it look
like<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.349> whole<00:00:31.619> new<00:00:31.830> map<00:00:32.009> and<00:00:32.189> I<00:00:32.219> just<00:00:32.399> think<00:00:32.520> it

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
like a whole new map and I just think it

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.940 
like a whole new map and I just think it
adds<00:00:32.730> an<00:00:32.910> extra<00:00:33.030> level<00:00:33.390> of<00:00:33.800> awesomeness<00:00:34.800> till

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
adds an extra level of awesomeness till

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.979 
adds an extra level of awesomeness till
I<00:00:35.070> really<00:00:35.399> think<00:00:35.550> that<00:00:35.700> on<00:00:35.940> this<00:00:36.120> game<00:00:36.329> they

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
I really think that on this game they

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.470 
I really think that on this game they
should<00:00:37.380> you<00:00:38.250> know<00:00:38.280> make<00:00:38.579> versions<00:00:39.180> of<00:00:39.239> all<00:00:39.390> of

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
should you know make versions of all of

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.490 
should you know make versions of all of
the<00:00:39.570> mirrored<00:00:39.809> map<00:00:39.930> like<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.140> mirrored

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
the mirrored map like a mirrored

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.530 
the mirrored map like a mirrored
playlist<00:00:40.980> just<00:00:41.190> like<00:00:41.340> you<00:00:41.460> off<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.760> you<00:00:42.450> know

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
playlist just like you off the you know

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.600 
playlist just like you off the you know
the<00:00:42.660> reverse<00:00:42.930> tracks<00:00:43.260> on<00:00:43.440> Mario<00:00:43.739> Kart<00:00:44.040> you<00:00:44.430> can

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
the reverse tracks on Mario Kart you can

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.310 
the reverse tracks on Mario Kart you can
get<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.850> mirrored<00:00:45.210> maps<00:00:45.570> on<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.110> game

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
get the mirrored maps on the game

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.290 
get the mirrored maps on the game
because<00:00:47.010> actually<00:00:47.399> because<00:00:47.700> everything<00:00:48.120> is<00:00:48.270> a

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
because actually because everything is a

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.600 
because actually because everything is a
real<00:00:48.539> world<00:00:48.809> object<00:00:49.410> it<00:00:50.010> appears<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.460> be

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
real world object it appears to be

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.310 
real world object it appears to be
normal<00:00:50.879> obviously<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.539> text<00:00:51.870> is<00:00:51.989> reversed

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
normal obviously the text is reversed

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.869 
normal obviously the text is reversed
and<00:00:52.530> flipped<00:00:52.770> around<00:00:52.920> I<00:00:53.250> did<00:00:53.670> consider

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
and flipped around I did consider

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.600 
and flipped around I did consider
playing<00:00:54.420> this<00:00:54.690> on<00:00:54.930> hardcore<00:00:55.860> so<00:00:56.160> I<00:00:56.190> wouldn't

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
playing this on hardcore so I wouldn't

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.970 
playing this on hardcore so I wouldn't
have<00:00:56.640> that<00:00:56.910> issue<00:00:57.059> but<00:00:57.629> hardcore<00:00:58.469> game<00:00:58.680> plays

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
have that issue but hardcore game plays

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.010 
have that issue but hardcore game plays
they're<00:00:59.579> not<00:00:59.699> fun<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:00.180> get<00:01:00.270> everyone<00:01:00.600> sat<00:01:00.899> in

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.920 
they're not fun you get everyone sat in
corners<00:01:01.530> or<00:01:01.770> that<00:01:01.890> kind<00:01:02.160> of<00:01:02.219> stuff<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.699> I<00:01:02.930> was

for<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.509> first<00:01:39.659> episode<00:01:39.990> probably<00:01:40.259> be<00:01:40.350> using

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
for the first episode probably be using

normal<00:01:40.829> guns<00:01:41.159> from<00:01:41.759> here<00:01:42.210> on<00:01:42.420> in<00:01:42.600> mixing<00:01:43.439> it<00:01:43.560> up

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
normal guns from here on in mixing it up

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.770 
normal guns from here on in mixing it up
a<00:01:43.770> bit<00:01:43.799> but<00:01:44.430> it<00:01:44.549> is<00:01:44.670> just<00:01:44.880> yet<00:01:45.180> it's<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.509> lot<00:01:45.689> of

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
a bit but it is just yet it's a lot of

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.539 
a bit but it is just yet it's a lot of
fun<00:01:45.960> it<00:01:46.079> just<00:01:46.259> kind<00:01:46.470> of<00:01:46.530> messes<00:01:47.250> with<00:01:47.430> your

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
fun it just kind of messes with your

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.370 
fun it just kind of messes with your
perception<00:01:48.149> a<00:01:48.240> little<00:01:48.479> bit<00:01:48.630> it's<00:01:48.780> almost<00:01:49.170> as

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
perception a little bit it's almost as

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.499 
perception a little bit it's almost as
if<00:01:49.530> it's<00:01:49.799> a<00:01:49.950> whole<00:01:50.100> new<00:01:50.310> map<00:01:50.520> but<00:01:51.119> it's<00:01:51.270> not

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
if it's a whole new map but it's not

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.780 
if it's a whole new map but it's not
quite<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:52.110> I<00:01:52.560> like<00:01:52.770> that<00:01:52.979> now<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.310> will<00:01:53.610> add

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
quite and I like that now a will add

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.160 
quite and I like that now a will add
that<00:01:54.000> I<00:01:54.030> don't<00:01:54.240> actually<00:01:54.420> play<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.840> game

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
that I don't actually play the game

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.350 
that I don't actually play the game
mirrored<00:01:55.590> I<00:01:55.770> might<00:01:56.159> do<00:01:56.280> that<00:01:56.310> for<00:01:57.030> a<00:01:57.090> future

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
mirrored I might do that for a future

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.780 
mirrored I might do that for a future
one<00:01:57.570> life<00:01:57.930> as<00:01:58.140> a<00:01:58.200> challenge<00:01:58.590> possibly<00:01:59.070> see<00:01:59.549> how

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
one life as a challenge possibly see how

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.969 
one life as a challenge possibly see how
that<00:02:00.030> works<00:02:00.240> out<00:02:00.540> but<00:02:01.140> actually<00:02:01.619> what<00:02:01.770> it<00:02:01.799> is

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
that works out but actually what it is

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.249 
that works out but actually what it is
that<00:02:02.219> I'm<00:02:02.369> doing<00:02:02.399> is<00:02:02.969> I'm<00:02:03.060> using<00:02:03.270> an<00:02:03.630> effect<00:02:03.990> on

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
that I'm doing is I'm using an effect on

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.760 
that I'm doing is I'm using an effect on
the<00:02:04.950> gameplay<00:02:05.399> to<00:02:06.119> flip<00:02:06.869> it<00:02:06.960> all<00:02:07.110> around<00:02:07.439> for

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
the gameplay to flip it all around for

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.589 
the gameplay to flip it all around for
you<00:02:07.860> guys<00:02:08.069> and<00:02:08.340> yeah<00:02:09.000> actually<00:02:09.179> that<00:02:09.360> sounds

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
you guys and yeah actually that sounds

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.660 
you guys and yeah actually that sounds
like<00:02:09.780> a<00:02:09.810> good<00:02:10.020> thing<00:02:10.080> to<00:02:10.289> do<00:02:10.590> for<00:02:11.009> just<00:02:11.550> their

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
like a good thing to do for just their

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.350 
like a good thing to do for just their
challenge<00:02:12.090> at<00:02:12.150> some<00:02:12.330> point<00:02:12.599> so

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
challenge at some point so

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.600 
challenge at some point so
I<00:02:13.420> will<00:02:13.990> try<00:02:14.260> that<00:02:14.440> and<00:02:14.710> one<00:02:15.070> thing<00:02:15.370> I<00:02:15.550> think

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
I will try that and one thing I think

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.160 
I will try that and one thing I think
it's<00:02:15.910> really<00:02:16.210> weird<00:02:16.360> is<00:02:16.570> how<00:02:16.750> the<00:02:16.810> sniper

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
it's really weird is how the sniper

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.260 
it's really weird is how the sniper
looked<00:02:17.560> is<00:02:17.770> this<00:02:18.130> really<00:02:18.460> what<00:02:18.850> it<00:02:19.030> would<00:02:19.150> look

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
looked is this really what it would look

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:20.940 
looked is this really what it would look
like<00:02:19.330> if<00:02:19.690> you're<00:02:19.810> holding<00:02:20.200> a<00:02:20.320> sniper<00:02:20.590> and

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
like if you're holding a sniper and

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.730 
like if you're holding a sniper and
you're<00:02:21.100> left<00:02:21.340> handed<00:02:21.550> I<00:02:21.910> don't<00:02:22.900> know<00:02:23.080> it's<00:02:23.470> you

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
you're left handed I don't know it's you

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:24.900 
you're left handed I don't know it's you
know<00:02:23.860> something<00:02:24.130> that<00:02:24.250> I've<00:02:24.370> always<00:02:24.550> thought

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
know something that I've always thought

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.970 
know something that I've always thought
looked<00:02:25.750> a<00:02:25.840> bit<00:02:25.870> strange<00:02:26.260> and<00:02:26.620> you'll<00:02:26.770> see<00:02:26.950> more

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
looked a bit strange and you'll see more

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.110 
looked a bit strange and you'll see more
so<00:02:27.520> on<00:02:27.550> other<00:02:28.120> weapons<00:02:28.570> in<00:02:28.810> future<00:02:29.530> episodes

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
so on other weapons in future episodes

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.060 
so on other weapons in future episodes
that<00:02:31.120> it<00:02:31.270> is<00:02:31.360> a<00:02:31.390> little<00:02:31.690> bit<00:02:31.930> a<00:02:32.200> little<00:02:32.560> bit<00:02:32.830> odd

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
that it is a little bit a little bit odd

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.130 
that it is a little bit a little bit odd
you<00:02:33.400> know<00:02:33.490> would<00:02:33.910> you<00:02:34.060> really<00:02:34.330> would<00:02:35.050> it

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
you know would you really would it

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.050 
you know would you really would it
really<00:02:35.290> look<00:02:35.590> like<00:02:35.620> that<00:02:35.860> and<00:02:36.310> you<00:02:36.910> know<00:02:37.030> it

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
really look like that and you know it

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.300 
really look like that and you know it
just<00:02:37.180> throws<00:02:37.780> up<00:02:38.020> that<00:02:38.290> is<00:02:38.500> the<00:02:38.770> first

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
just throws up that is the first

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.250 
just throws up that is the first
person's<00:02:39.790> perspective<00:02:40.060> on<00:02:40.600> Call<00:02:40.870> of<00:02:40.900> Duty

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
person's perspective on Call of Duty

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.080 
person's perspective on Call of Duty
actually<00:02:41.650> realistic<00:02:42.010> or<00:02:42.580> is<00:02:42.640> it<00:02:42.940> something

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
actually realistic or is it something

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.940 
actually realistic or is it something
that<00:02:43.180> it's<00:02:43.360> just<00:02:43.510> made<00:02:43.750> to<00:02:44.020> look<00:02:44.200> like<00:02:44.500> it

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
that it's just made to look like it

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.530 
that it's just made to look like it
would<00:02:45.040> work<00:02:45.070> I<00:02:45.430> don't<00:02:45.640> know<00:02:45.760> you<00:02:46.090> guys<00:02:46.270> can

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
would work I don't know you guys can

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.420 
would work I don't know you guys can
comment<00:02:47.110> on<00:02:47.290> that<00:02:47.470> if<00:02:47.650> you<00:02:47.800> would<00:02:47.950> like<00:02:48.130> and

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
comment on that if you would like and

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.340 
comment on that if you would like and
actually<00:02:48.700> I<00:02:48.940> thought<00:02:49.150> I<00:02:49.360> went<00:02:49.840> on<00:02:49.959> a<00:02:49.990> quite

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
actually I thought I went on a quite

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.530 
actually I thought I went on a quite
nice<00:02:50.590> streak<00:02:50.980> around<00:02:51.190> this<00:02:51.489> point<00:02:51.820> in<00:02:52.000> the

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
nice streak around this point in the

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.960 
nice streak around this point in the
game<00:02:52.650> and<00:02:53.650> yet<00:02:53.860> it's<00:02:54.010> so<00:02:54.130> strange<00:02:54.430> like<00:02:54.760> when

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
game and yet it's so strange like when

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.520 
game and yet it's so strange like when
you<00:02:55.060> look<00:02:55.209> around<00:02:55.360> when<00:02:55.660> I'm<00:02:55.780> well<00:02:56.230> I<00:02:56.290> come<00:02:56.410> out

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
you look around when I'm well I come out

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.650 
you look around when I'm well I come out
of<00:02:56.620> sight<00:02:57.100> when<00:02:57.340> you<00:02:57.430> look<00:02:57.610> around<00:02:57.760> it's<00:02:58.480> like

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
of sight when you look around it's like

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.810 
of sight when you look around it's like
this<00:02:58.959> isn't<00:02:59.110> carrier<00:02:59.530> is<00:02:59.680> it<00:02:59.860> or<00:03:00.340> is<00:03:00.489> it<00:03:00.520> it's

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
this isn't carrier is it or is it it's

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.330 
this isn't carrier is it or is it it's
you<00:03:01.209> know<00:03:01.360> it's<00:03:01.570> like<00:03:02.320> I<00:03:02.560> run<00:03:02.800> to<00:03:02.950> a<00:03:02.980> corner<00:03:03.310> and

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
you know it's like I run to a corner and

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.520 
you know it's like I run to a corner and
I<00:03:03.459> expect<00:03:03.820> there<00:03:04.000> to<00:03:04.030> be<00:03:04.150> you<00:03:04.900> know<00:03:05.020> something

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
I expect there to be you know something

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.050 
I expect there to be you know something
on<00:03:05.739> that<00:03:05.980> corner<00:03:06.250> but<00:03:06.520> it's<00:03:06.670> actually<00:03:06.790> the

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
on that corner but it's actually the

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
because i don't know why but the episode

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.289 
because i don't know why but the episode
seemed<00:03:37.660> to<00:03:37.959> lose<00:03:38.769> everyone's<00:03:39.130> interest<00:03:39.640> about

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:40.299
