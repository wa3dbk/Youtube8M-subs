00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.970
 Hi guys, how are you? 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.330
 I promised to make more videos, I'm 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.490
 doing today I'm going to show a recipe 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.790
 that I say mine despite having 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.800
 Last time she finally knew more but I 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.490
 I say mine because I knew the 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.430
 what I do 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:25.189
 then mine ready for a 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.189
 chocolate with strawberries is the one here 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.519
 she got so cute on top because 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.910
 uses a base is very large chocolate 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:38.670
 It did not yield so much but I could 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:41.160
 happy ian as always is very easy 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.230
 doing is very practical so if you go 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.410
 a serious left in the kitchen meeting 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.230
 You'll get the letter from you. 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.640
 need to make this recipe 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:54.809
 chocolate cream wafer cornstarch 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.219
 I 'm older I think that 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.890
 marina is the same 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:03.390
 but in the easiest way to use the form 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:07.920
 and strawberries order if you do not like 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.390
 strawberries and can use ufa carambola sei 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.020
 there any other fruit you liked 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.210
 more 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.990
 but a year ago I started with a 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.700
 It's beautiful , I love it, it's me. 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.560
 I use more milk like that 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.930
 if you do not have milk in 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.670
 It does not make so much difference, it 's just for 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.340
 to know the ball more was already a 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.200
 a little more ball but not catch 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.040
 here is different because chocolate is 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.040
 give cidinho also rolÃª 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:40.359
 step 1 quit the chocolate do not step on 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:41.710
 there too but so has phelps since the 

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:43.479
 fast in bath Maria 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.069
 if you are to blame for the delay but 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:47.140
 could have more time lost 

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:50.799
 rolling at the end of it 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:53.049
 besides this time the mother Maria to those who do not 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:54.399
 Do you know what step 2 is in the shower? 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:58.359
 Maria 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:02:01.509
 are you putting a pot on the stove with 

00:01:58.359 --> 00:02:03.579
 water and the chocolate goes in another 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:04.869
 canister that was inside the pot is good 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:06.610
 see fit well 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:08.349
 I had a bit of trouble today because 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.030
 the base sometimes falls in as in the 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:12.040
 water so I had to hold it with a 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.290
 not to fall and never 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.660
 water inside the chocolate that 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.840
 inside the chocolate dairy hardens a lot 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:24.730
 fast on a flight everything to let you go 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:26.379
 although again it is chocolate as well 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:30.250
 Maria 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:31.690
 step 3 opens cans of sour cream and 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.519
 take her sleep to mix the 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.450
 chocolate has no other word but 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:36.879
 had a serum 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.769
 This time I did not take it because I ended up in 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:39.880
 market was too mixed I said ah 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:42.160
 go anyway 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.810
 but if you take the lord and do not stay so 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.290
 hard at the beginning so it 's easier to 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:50.620
 mix four passes 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.329
 Do you have that strawberries? 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.069
 after leaving the chocolate reserved 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:55.239
 mix dinho the cream is 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:59.049
 all the strawberries in small pieces 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:00.700
 little ones 0 1 or 2 or 3 strawberries 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:04.510
 prefer beautiful for coverage to 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:06.579
 let the rhythm up without getting more 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.609
 you are very tiny that they will 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:11.769
 stay in the middle totally stay the days I 

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:14.440
 I've already left sympathy when it comes to 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:17.520
 I took the support line she sells 3 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:22.170
 bruises get easier 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:25.380
 so the game is over five 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:28.710
 then chop the chocolate has reached the final 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:30.750
 after getting strawberry 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:33.450
 After that, you'll just receive a whole bounce. 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.940
 in the corner on the table you're going to 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:38.910
 for part of the assembly that is to take a 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.960
 canister to pass the chocolate in the 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.660
 canister 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:44.820
 after picking up the dung cornstarch places 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.190
 in the milk for a lidinha is not for 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:51.180
 just watch milk and go riding 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:52.550
 under the canister, thus placing the 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.780
 chocolate 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:56.190
 in this step a little chocolat on top 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.410
 because you have to change the 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.690
 order begins because the chocolate in low 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:04.530
 so that they are male and rubber 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:06.090
 to give a lot of firmness this is how 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:09.780
 If you live on my way, it 's time to 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:11.400
 catching this harder to take this step the 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.890
 chocolate so I can make the order 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:17.630
 right but the Strawberry Chocolate 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:20.340
 chocolate chip cookie 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.720
 leave the last cookie tight 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.430
 to stay 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.100
 she is very thin and better to pass 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:28.500
 the chocolate team she wants the most retinha 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.720
 if you put the chocolate as peanuts 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:34.040
 coconut chocolate because my base was 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:36.090
 I usually too large to smaller cell 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.220
 stay a little bit like this but if you 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:40.230
 have enough chocolate yet you can 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:43.730
 pick up and spend enough chocolate to 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:45.870
 to be well on top 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:48.170
 decorated place the strawberries in 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:50.420
 and usually cut in 4 to make a 

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:52.740
 tenth to be cute 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:53.870
 arrived that refrigerator because they 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.930
 become isolated 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:59.100
 in this line, an hour and a half maximum and 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.820
 are you ready to eat? 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:04.919
 then I learned that not discern 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:09.660
 eating was still that I eat with the 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:12.840
 friends as they enjoy the recipe inside 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:15.120
 click on the video is to share with the 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:17.850
 friends to mother also do if you 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.800
 have lazy sid the Sunday without 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:21.930
 to do nothing to do at home is very 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:25.020
 Good when the bad side here has nothing 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:26.230
 then old wife had I done 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:29.650
 a bad thing now 

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:33.720
 You 'll want to feel like this. 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:33.720
 Thank you. A kiss, bye.
