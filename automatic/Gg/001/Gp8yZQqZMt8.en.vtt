in close quarters combat is the elbow

in close quarters combat is the elbow
strike<00:00:20.220> however<00:00:20.789> most<00:00:21.060> people<00:00:21.180> are

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
strike however most people are

strike however most people are
delivering<00:00:21.990> this<00:00:22.140> strike<00:00:22.410> completely<00:00:23.220> wrong

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
delivering this strike completely wrong

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.040 
delivering this strike completely wrong
because<00:00:24.000> they're<00:00:24.210> basically<00:00:24.359> just<00:00:24.689> going<00:00:24.900> off

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
because they're basically just going off

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.990 
because they're basically just going off
of<00:00:25.109> a<00:00:25.199> theory<00:00:25.680> of<00:00:25.830> how<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.369> strikes<00:00:26.880> should

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
of a theory of how the strikes should

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.970 
of a theory of how the strikes should
work<00:00:27.480> when<00:00:27.930> in<00:00:28.019> actuality<00:00:28.260> in<00:00:28.470> a<00:00:28.500> real<00:00:28.710> street

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980

work when in actuality in a real street
fight<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.699> dynamics<00:00:30.179> are<00:00:30.300> quite<00:00:30.539> quite

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
fight the dynamics are quite quite

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.179 
fight the dynamics are quite quite
different<00:00:30.990> so<00:00:31.500> I'm<00:00:31.590> going<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:31.740> show<00:00:31.859> you<00:00:31.920> now

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
different so I'm going to show you now

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.830 
different so I'm going to show you now
there<00:00:32.759> are<00:00:32.790> some<00:00:33.239> of<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.390> mistakes<00:00:33.540> that

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
there are some of the mistakes that

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.930 
there are some of the mistakes that
people<00:00:33.960> make<00:00:34.290> as<00:00:34.500> well<00:00:34.710> as<00:00:34.920> how<00:00:35.670> you<00:00:35.700> can

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
people make as well as how you can

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.360 
people make as well as how you can
deliver<00:00:36.149> a<00:00:36.300> faster<00:00:37.140> elbow<00:00:37.590> strike<00:00:37.920> and

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
deliver a faster elbow strike and

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.430 
deliver a faster elbow strike and
generate<00:00:38.850> more<00:00:38.910> power<00:00:39.450> behind<00:00:39.690> it<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.050> do<00:00:40.170> more

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
generate more power behind it to do more

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.319 
generate more power behind it to do more
damage<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:40.920> your<00:00:41.070> attacker<00:00:41.460> now<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.030> reason

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
damage to your attacker now the reason

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.700 
damage to your attacker now the reason
why<00:00:42.480> most<00:00:42.809> people<00:00:42.930> get<00:00:43.170> this<00:00:43.290> wrong<00:00:43.350> is

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
why most people get this wrong is

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:44.959 
why most people get this wrong is
because<00:00:43.920> they're<00:00:44.070> trying<00:00:44.309> to<00:00:44.370> do<00:00:44.520> it<00:00:44.610> from<00:00:44.760> too

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
because they're trying to do it from too

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:45.590 
because they're trying to do it from too
far<00:00:45.270> away

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
far away

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.389 
far away
they're<00:00:46.289> try<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:46.590> deliver<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.950> strike<00:00:47.219> from

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
they're try and deliver the strike from

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.310 
they're try and deliver the strike from
back<00:00:48.030> here<00:00:48.239> from<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.420> fighting<00:00:48.809> stance<00:00:49.020> here

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
back here from the fighting stance here

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.470 
back here from the fighting stance here
and<00:00:49.469> they're<00:00:49.770> coming<00:00:50.010> in<00:00:50.250> like<00:00:50.489> this<00:00:50.670> the

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
and they're coming in like this the

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.209 
and they're coming in like this the
elbow<00:00:51.780> strike<00:00:51.989> is<00:00:52.170> really<00:00:52.469> for<00:00:52.680> very<00:00:52.980> very

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
elbow strike is really for very very

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.279 
elbow strike is really for very very
close<00:00:53.520> in<00:00:53.789> fighting<00:00:54.360> for<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.629> most<00:00:54.930> part

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
close in fighting for the most part

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.860 
close in fighting for the most part
however<00:00:55.620> that's<00:00:55.980> not<00:00:56.129> necessarily<00:00:56.870> that

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
however that's not necessarily that

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.709 
however that's not necessarily that
needs<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.289> be<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.469> problem<00:00:59.359> the<00:01:00.359> other<00:01:00.390> thing

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
needs to be the problem the other thing

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.270 
needs to be the problem the other thing
is<00:01:00.870> that<00:01:00.899> when<00:01:01.590> you<00:01:01.739> try<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:01.980> deliver<00:01:02.190> the

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
is that when you try and deliver the

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.920 
is that when you try and deliver the
strike<00:01:02.489> from<00:01:02.670> too<00:01:02.850> far<00:01:03.090> away<00:01:03.329> with<00:01:03.539> a<00:01:03.570> fist

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
strike from too far away with a fist

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.420 
strike from too far away with a fist
that's<00:01:04.080> much<00:01:04.290> much<00:01:04.439> easier<00:01:04.830> when<00:01:04.949> you're<00:01:05.100> here

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
that's much much easier when you're here

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.789 
that's much much easier when you're here
the<00:01:05.909> fist<00:01:06.180> is<00:01:06.299> very<00:01:06.510> very<00:01:06.750> fast<00:01:07.290> it's<00:01:07.680> very

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
the fist is very very fast it's very

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.500 
the fist is very very fast it's very
even<00:01:08.340> though<00:01:08.400> it's<00:01:08.549> coming<00:01:08.820> farther<00:01:09.270> back

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
even though it's coming farther back

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.109 
even though it's coming farther back
than<00:01:09.540> your<00:01:09.900> elbow<00:01:10.049> is<00:01:10.409> you<00:01:11.100> have<00:01:11.340> more<00:01:11.700> speed

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
than your elbow is you have more speed

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.640 
than your elbow is you have more speed
behind<00:01:12.570> it<00:01:12.780> because<00:01:12.960> you're<00:01:13.229> carrying<00:01:13.590> a

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
behind it because you're carrying a

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.100 
behind it because you're carrying a
smaller<00:01:14.040> projectile<00:01:14.670> basically<00:01:15.270> so<00:01:15.840> you<00:01:15.900> can

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
smaller projectile basically so you can

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.480 
smaller projectile basically so you can
actually<00:01:16.320> get<00:01:16.680> in<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:16.950> attack<00:01:17.250> before

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
actually get in the attack before

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.670 
actually get in the attack before
somebody<00:01:18.210> actually<00:01:18.450> flinches<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:19.560> moves

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
somebody actually flinches and moves

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.920 
somebody actually flinches and moves
away<00:01:19.830> with<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.700> elbow<00:01:21.060> strike<00:01:21.330> your<00:01:21.689> whole

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
away with the elbow strike your whole

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.410 
away with the elbow strike your whole
body<00:01:22.259> is<00:01:22.500> moving<00:01:22.680> in<00:01:23.009> what<00:01:23.790> that<00:01:23.939> does<00:01:24.119> is<00:01:24.270> his

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
body is moving in what that does is his

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.480 
body is moving in what that does is his
peripheral<00:01:24.840> vision<00:01:25.259> subconsciously<00:01:26.189> already

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
peripheral vision subconsciously already

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.550 
peripheral vision subconsciously already
picks<00:01:26.729> it<00:01:26.909> up<00:01:27.030> long<00:01:27.659> before<00:01:27.869> would<00:01:28.320> if<00:01:28.470> you

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
picks it up long before would if you

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.080 
picks it up long before would if you
were<00:01:28.650> trying<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:28.950> slip<00:01:29.159> this<00:01:29.280> with<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.790> the

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
were trying to slip this with the the

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.390 
were trying to slip this with the the
punch<00:01:30.329> in<00:01:30.540> so<00:01:31.140> in<00:01:31.290> essence<00:01:31.650> what<00:01:31.799> happens<00:01:32.250> is

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
punch in so in essence what happens is

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.510 
punch in so in essence what happens is
he<00:01:32.579> starts<00:01:32.850> flinching<00:01:33.299> away<00:01:33.570> a<00:01:33.900> lot<00:01:34.409> sooner<00:01:34.799> so

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
he starts flinching away a lot sooner so

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.100 
he starts flinching away a lot sooner so
by<00:01:35.670> that<00:01:35.820> time<00:01:35.880> you've<00:01:36.630> got<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:36.840> come<00:01:37.079> in

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
by that time you've got to come in

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.590 
by that time you've got to come in
further<00:01:37.619> with<00:01:38.009> your<00:01:38.189> strike<00:01:38.579> number<00:01:39.090> one<00:01:39.420> so

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
further with your strike number one so

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.940 
further with your strike number one so
it<00:01:39.689> increases<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.170> distance<00:01:40.439> with<00:01:40.829> your

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
it increases the distance with your

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.740 
it increases the distance with your
elbow<00:01:41.280> strike<00:01:41.670> because<00:01:42.150> he's<00:01:42.570> already

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
elbow strike because he's already

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.319 
elbow strike because he's already
flinching<00:01:43.380> back<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:44.280> other<00:01:44.399> thing<00:01:44.640> is<00:01:44.790> while

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
flinching back the other thing is while

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.270 
flinching back the other thing is while
you're<00:01:45.540> striking<00:01:45.930> and<00:01:46.290> he's<00:01:46.470> flinching<00:01:47.040> back

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
you're striking and he's flinching back

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.310 
you're striking and he's flinching back
you're<00:01:47.939> generating<00:01:48.240> less<00:01:48.540> power<00:01:48.840> because

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
you're generating less power because

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.530 
you're generating less power because
your<00:01:49.740> elbow<00:01:50.159> in<00:01:50.369> his<00:01:50.549> head<00:01:50.790> are<00:01:51.000> moving<00:01:51.329> in<00:01:51.450> the

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
your elbow in his head are moving in the

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.359 
your elbow in his head are moving in the
same<00:01:51.720> direction<00:01:51.780> so<00:01:52.740> you're<00:01:52.890> not<00:01:53.040> really

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
same direction so you're not really

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.460 
same direction so you're not really
generating<00:01:54.000> a<00:01:54.090> lot<00:01:54.360> of<00:01:54.570> force<00:01:54.869> at<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.320> point

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
generating a lot of force at the point

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.609 
generating a lot of force at the point

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
I had it's real close to my body

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.640 
I had it's real close to my body
generating<00:03:09.330> a<00:03:09.420> lot<00:03:09.630> of<00:03:09.780> force<00:03:10.020> there<00:03:10.260> the

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
generating a lot of force there the

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:11.949 
generating a lot of force there the
other<00:03:10.740> thing<00:03:10.920> is<00:03:11.040> it's<00:03:11.160> much<00:03:11.340> much<00:03:11.580> faster

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
other thing is it's much much faster

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:15.620 
other thing is it's much much faster
because<00:03:13.220> with<00:03:14.220> the<00:03:14.400> with<00:03:15.060> his<00:03:15.240> head<00:03:15.450> coming

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
because with the with his head coming

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.210 
because with the with his head coming
forward<00:03:16.020> it<00:03:16.110> shortens<00:03:16.590> the<00:03:16.709> distance<00:03:16.830> by<00:03:17.190> a

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
forward it shortens the distance by a

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.250 
forward it shortens the distance by a
half<00:03:17.550> then<00:03:18.390> what<00:03:18.570> if<00:03:18.690> I<00:03:18.780> were<00:03:18.900> just<00:03:19.019> trying<00:03:19.230> to

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
half then what if I were just trying to

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.920 
half then what if I were just trying to
wring<00:03:19.380> my<00:03:19.500> elbow<00:03:19.800> up<00:03:19.830> into<00:03:20.580> his<00:03:20.760> face<00:03:21.060> so<00:03:21.810> by

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
wring my elbow up into his face so by

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.810 
wring my elbow up into his face so by
bringing<00:03:22.140> it<00:03:22.380> in<00:03:22.530> it<00:03:22.830> shortens<00:03:23.580> the<00:03:23.700> distance

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
bringing it in it shortens the distance

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.509 
bringing it in it shortens the distance
I<00:03:24.150> get<00:03:24.269> a<00:03:24.300> much<00:03:24.510> faster<00:03:24.870> strike<00:03:25.470> and<00:03:25.739> I'm

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
I get a much faster strike and I'm

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:29.570 
I get a much faster strike and I'm
creating<00:03:26.940> double<00:03:27.420> the<00:03:27.480> impact<00:03:28.280> creating<00:03:29.280> more

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
creating double the impact creating more

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.270 
creating double the impact creating more
for<00:03:29.880> more<00:03:30.360> force<00:03:30.720> more<00:03:30.989> damage<00:03:31.980> on<00:03:32.220> my

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
for more force more damage on my

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.150 
for more force more damage on my
attacker<00:03:33.209> so<00:03:33.780> definitely<00:03:34.440> use<00:03:34.739> your<00:03:34.950> other

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
attacker so definitely use your other

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.670 
attacker so definitely use your other
hand<00:03:35.610> to<00:03:35.850> index<00:03:36.300> this<00:03:36.540> person<00:03:36.989> to<00:03:37.350> generate

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
hand to index this person to generate

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.560 
hand to index this person to generate
more<00:03:37.800> power<00:03:38.010> and<00:03:38.310> get<00:03:38.670> in<00:03:38.790> a<00:03:38.880> faster<00:03:39.269> reaction

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
more power and get in a faster reaction

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.440 
more power and get in a faster reaction
time<00:03:39.600> and<00:03:39.750> a<00:03:39.870> faster<00:03:40.200> strike
