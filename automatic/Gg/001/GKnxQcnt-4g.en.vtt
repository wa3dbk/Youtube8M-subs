00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:59.059 
turned off so I was in complete darkness
for<00:01:57.509> a<00:01:57.539> while<00:01:57.780> and<00:01:58.109> then<00:01:58.560> I<00:01:58.619> was<00:01:58.740> going<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:58.979> turn

00:01:59.059 --> 00:01:59.069 
for a while and then I was going to turn

for a while and then I was going to turn
back<00:01:59.280> on<00:01:59.340> so<00:01:59.759> what<00:02:00.149> what<00:02:00.569> I'm<00:02:00.719> thinking<00:02:01.259> is

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
back on so what what I'm thinking is

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.649 
back on so what what I'm thinking is
that<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:02.310> light<00:02:02.490> is<00:02:02.520> dying<00:02:02.880> and<00:02:03.270> that<00:02:03.329> it's

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
that the light is dying and that it's

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.870 
that the light is dying and that it's
old<00:02:03.929> light<00:02:04.200> and<00:02:04.469> it<00:02:04.530> needs<00:02:04.740> to<00:02:04.829> be<00:02:04.979> replaced<00:02:05.340> so

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
old light and it needs to be replaced so

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.940 
old light and it needs to be replaced so
