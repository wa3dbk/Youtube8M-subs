hi<00:00:03.949> I'm<00:00:04.100> James<00:00:04.400> and<00:00:04.819> in<00:00:04.910> this<00:00:05.000> video<00:00:05.210> I'm

00:00:05.679 --> 00:00:05.689 
hi I'm James and in this video I'm

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:09.850 
hi I'm James and in this video I'm
taking<00:00:06.140> a<00:00:06.290> look<00:00:06.439> at<00:00:06.710> the<00:00:06.950> Lenovo<00:00:07.849> IdeaPad<00:00:08.230> flex

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:09.860 
taking a look at the Lenovo IdeaPad flex

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.850 
taking a look at the Lenovo IdeaPad flex
and<00:00:10.130> this<00:00:10.550> is<00:00:10.640> a<00:00:10.730> small<00:00:11.090> 10-inch<00:00:11.690> Windows<00:00:12.650> 8

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:12.860 
and this is a small 10-inch Windows 8

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.599 
and this is a small 10-inch Windows 8
system<00:00:13.300> with<00:00:14.300> an<00:00:14.570> Intel<00:00:14.990> Celeron<00:00:15.380> Bay<00:00:16.309> Trail

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:16.609 
system with an Intel Celeron Bay Trail

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:19.120 
system with an Intel Celeron Bay Trail
processor<00:00:17.119> so<00:00:17.480> dual<00:00:17.779> core<00:00:18.050> chip<00:00:18.470> based<00:00:18.740> on<00:00:19.010> the

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:19.130 
processor so dual core chip based on the

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.150 
processor so dual core chip based on the
latest<00:00:19.520> as<00:00:19.970> I<00:00:20.930> think<00:00:21.050> it's<00:00:21.320> silvermont<00:00:21.800> calls

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.160 
latest as I think it's silvermont calls

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.300 
latest as I think it's silvermont calls
and<00:00:22.930> so<00:00:23.930> what<00:00:24.110> we<00:00:24.199> have<00:00:24.350> to<00:00:24.470> do<00:00:24.560> first<00:00:24.920> gain

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.310 
and so what we have to do first gain

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.370 
and so what we have to do first gain
access<00:00:25.550> the<00:00:26.029> internals<00:00:26.570> of<00:00:26.690> the<00:00:26.810> machine<00:00:27.140> is

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:27.380 
access the internals of the machine is

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.040 
access the internals of the machine is
we<00:00:28.070> have<00:00:28.310> a<00:00:28.670> selection<00:00:29.090> of<00:00:29.270> screws<00:00:29.660> on<00:00:29.900> the

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
we have a selection of screws on the

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.860 
we have a selection of screws on the
base<00:00:30.230> and<00:00:30.609> we<00:00:31.609> also<00:00:31.730> have<00:00:31.970> two<00:00:32.119> hidden<00:00:32.390> screws

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:32.870 
base and we also have two hidden screws

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.709 
base and we also have two hidden screws
which<00:00:33.199> are<00:00:33.440> under<00:00:33.859> these<00:00:34.729> two<00:00:35.089> front<00:00:35.479> rubber

00:00:35.709 --> 00:00:35.719 
which are under these two front rubber

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:37.869 
which are under these two front rubber
feet<00:00:35.989> so<00:00:36.409> what<00:00:36.559> we're<00:00:36.710> going<00:00:36.800> to<00:00:36.859> do<00:00:37.100> is<00:00:37.460> we're

00:00:37.869 --> 00:00:37.879 
feet so what we're going to do is we're

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:41.889 
feet so what we're going to do is we're
going<00:00:37.909> to<00:00:38.120> take<00:00:38.329> a<00:00:38.569> guitar<00:00:39.019> pick<00:00:39.350> and<00:00:40.899> slide

00:00:41.889 --> 00:00:41.899 
going to take a guitar pick and slide

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:47.110 
going to take a guitar pick and slide
that<00:00:42.229> in<00:00:44.139> underneath<00:00:45.139> the<00:00:45.409> feet<00:00:45.670> to<00:00:46.670> remove

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
that in underneath the feet to remove

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.869 
that in underneath the feet to remove
those<00:00:47.479> these<00:00:48.440> held<00:00:48.799> on<00:00:48.949> just<00:00:49.190> with<00:00:49.339> adhesive

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:49.879 
those these held on just with adhesive

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:51.869 
those these held on just with adhesive
so<00:00:50.179> if<00:00:50.299> we<00:00:50.389> get<00:00:50.510> the<00:00:50.659> guitar<00:00:50.960> pick<00:00:51.170> underneath

00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:51.879 
so if we get the guitar pick underneath

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:54.610 
so if we get the guitar pick underneath
and<00:00:52.879> we<00:00:53.030> can<00:00:53.179> see<00:00:53.359> in<00:00:53.600> fact<00:00:53.719> these<00:00:53.929> onto<00:00:54.260> T<00:00:54.409> so

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
and we can see in fact these onto T so

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.729 
and we can see in fact these onto T so
these<00:00:54.829> are<00:00:55.039> actually<00:00:55.399> clip<00:00:55.850> in<00:00:56.409> but<00:00:57.409> that

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
these are actually clip in but that

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:00.819 
these are actually clip in but that
lifts<00:00:58.159> up<00:00:58.280> like<00:00:58.459> that<00:00:59.109> and<00:01:00.109> again<00:01:00.229> the<00:01:00.649> other

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829 
lifts up like that and again the other

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:05.530 
lifts up like that and again the other
side<00:01:01.929> get<00:01:02.929> the<00:01:03.019> pick<00:01:03.229> in<00:01:04.000> and<00:01:05.000> this<00:01:05.089> one<00:01:05.330> has<00:01:05.510> a

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
side get the pick in and this one has a

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.420 
side get the pick in and this one has a
little<00:01:05.750> warranty<00:01:06.350> sticker<00:01:06.620> underneath<00:01:06.830> it<00:01:07.310> as

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 
little warranty sticker underneath it as

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:16.540 
little warranty sticker underneath it as
well<00:01:07.670> so<00:01:13.900> we're<00:01:14.900> just<00:01:14.990> going<00:01:15.260> to<00:01:15.410> need<00:01:15.560> to<00:01:15.590> lift

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:16.550 
well so we're just going to need to lift

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:27.950 
well so we're just going to need to lift
that<00:01:16.790> sticker<00:01:17.270> as<00:01:17.540> well

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.910 

obviously<00:01:28.960> don't<00:01:29.230> do<00:01:29.380> this<00:01:29.530> if<00:01:29.740> you<00:01:29.890> are

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
obviously don't do this if you are

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.940 
obviously don't do this if you are
concerned<00:01:30.550> about<00:01:30.700> you<00:01:30.970> user<00:01:31.240> warranty<00:01:31.950> but

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
concerned about you user warranty but

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.440 
concerned about you user warranty but
that<00:01:33.070> gives<00:01:33.310> us<00:01:33.460> access<00:01:33.610> to<00:01:33.880> the<00:01:34.090> screw<00:01:34.300> under

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
that gives us access to the screw under

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.590 
that gives us access to the screw under
there<00:01:34.750> and<00:01:34.960> now<00:01:35.260> we're<00:01:35.560> going<00:01:35.710> to<00:01:35.830> just<00:01:36.600> remove

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
there and now we're going to just remove

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:45.420 
there and now we're going to just remove
the<00:01:38.080> screws<00:01:38.380> from<00:01:38.650> the<00:01:38.740> system<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:45.130> what<00:01:45.280> I<00:01:45.310> do

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
the screws from the system and what I do

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.030 
the screws from the system and what I do
when<00:01:45.730> I<00:01:45.760> take<00:01:45.850> them<00:01:46.180> out<00:01:46.300> is<00:01:46.600> as<00:01:47.290> I'm<00:01:47.860> just

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.040 
when I take them out is as I'm just

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.920 
when I take them out is as I'm just
doing<00:01:48.220> the<00:01:48.310> short<00:01:48.550> term<00:01:48.880> I<00:01:49.150> just<00:01:49.450> position

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
doing the short term I just position

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.790 
doing the short term I just position
them<00:01:50.760> behind<00:01:51.760> the<00:01:52.000> laptop<00:01:52.540> in<00:01:52.810> the<00:01:53.410> order<00:01:53.680> that

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:53.800 
them behind the laptop in the order that

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.620 
them behind the laptop in the order that
I've<00:01:53.890> taken<00:01:54.100> them<00:01:54.400> out<00:01:54.490> alternatively<00:01:55.360> you

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
I've taken them out alternatively you

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.540 
I've taken them out alternatively you
can<00:01:55.840> mark<00:01:56.380> things<00:01:56.620> up<00:01:56.800> on<00:01:56.950> a<00:01:56.980> piece<00:01:57.160> of<00:01:57.310> paper

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:57.550 
can mark things up on a piece of paper

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.570 
can mark things up on a piece of paper
if<00:01:57.910> they're<00:01:58.560> you<00:01:59.560> want<00:01:59.710> to<00:01:59.830> keep<00:01:59.950> track<00:02:00.280> what

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
if they're you want to keep track what

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.700 
if they're you want to keep track what
came<00:02:00.820> from<00:02:01.060> where<00:02:01.300> I<00:02:01.540> believe<00:02:01.930> in<00:02:02.200> this<00:02:02.380> these

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
came from where I believe in this these

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.740 
came from where I believe in this these
screws<00:02:03.040> are<00:02:03.070> all<00:02:03.340> actually<00:02:03.760> the<00:02:03.880> same<00:02:04.090> size<00:02:04.390> so

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
screws are all actually the same size so

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.690 
screws are all actually the same size so
it's<00:02:04.870> not<00:02:04.990> too<00:02:05.170> important<00:02:05.770> just<00:02:06.100> gather<00:02:06.460> them

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
it's not too important just gather them

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.560 
it's not too important just gather them
up<00:02:06.820> and<00:02:06.880> make<00:02:07.180> sure<00:02:07.210> you<00:02:07.390> don't<00:02:07.660> lose<00:02:07.960> them<00:02:08.320> and

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:09.570 
up and make sure you don't lose them and

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:11.880 
up and make sure you don't lose them and
see<00:02:10.570> quite<00:02:10.869> often<00:02:11.020> see<00:02:11.320> when<00:02:11.500> someone's<00:02:11.770> have

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
see quite often see when someone's have

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.530 
see quite often see when someone's have
a<00:02:11.920> laptop<00:02:12.130> apartment<00:02:12.970> missing<00:02:13.330> a<00:02:13.390> couple

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
a laptop apartment missing a couple

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.450 
a laptop apartment missing a couple
screws<00:02:14.020> underneath<00:02:14.470> or<00:02:14.830> something<00:02:15.130> like<00:02:15.280> that

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.460 
screws underneath or something like that

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.150 
screws underneath or something like that
so<00:02:15.730> it's<00:02:15.850> always<00:02:15.970> good<00:02:16.210> idea<00:02:16.540> just<00:02:16.750> to<00:02:17.160> make

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
so it's always good idea just to make

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:27.440 
so it's always good idea just to make
sure<00:02:18.370> you<00:02:18.550> know<00:02:18.670> what<00:02:18.910> is<00:02:19.060> what

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.380 

and<00:02:28.080> it's<00:02:28.500> fairly<00:02:28.740> simple<00:02:29.069> to<00:02:29.250> do<00:02:29.459> this<00:02:29.670> as<00:02:30.209> you

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
and it's fairly simple to do this as you

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:49.600 
and it's fairly simple to do this as you
can<00:02:30.450> see<00:02:30.540> where<00:02:30.900> most<00:02:31.470> the<00:02:31.650> way<00:02:31.770> through<00:02:32.040> now

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:59.210 

one<00:02:50.610> last<00:02:50.790> screw<00:02:51.030> to<00:02:51.240> remove<00:02:57.410> and<00:02:58.410> now<00:02:58.800> it

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
one last screw to remove and now it

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.780 
one last screw to remove and now it
should<00:02:59.640> simply<00:03:00.060> be<00:03:00.090> a<00:03:00.240> case<00:03:00.510> of<00:03:01.790> separating

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
should simply be a case of separating

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.730 
should simply be a case of separating
the<00:03:02.940> base<00:03:03.120> off<00:03:03.420> of<00:03:03.570> the<00:03:03.660> chassis<00:03:04.050> so<00:03:04.080> again<00:03:04.620> if

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
the base off of the chassis so again if

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:11.510 
the base off of the chassis so again if
we<00:03:04.830> take<00:03:05.010> out<00:03:05.250> our<00:03:05.520> Peck<00:03:10.250> what<00:03:11.250> I'm<00:03:11.340> going<00:03:11.490> to

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
we take out our Peck what I'm going to

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:18.340 
we take out our Peck what I'm going to
do<00:03:11.730> is<00:03:12.000> find<00:03:12.270> a<00:03:12.360> point<00:03:12.540> we<00:03:12.750> can<00:03:12.930> slide<00:03:13.260> this<00:03:13.530> in

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:37.600 

around<00:03:19.350> the<00:03:19.530> front<00:03:19.830> of<00:03:19.890> the<00:03:20.040> laptop<00:03:20.160> possibly

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:42.229 

so<00:03:38.610> yep<00:03:38.940> there<00:03:39.330> we've<00:03:39.629> got<00:03:39.660> the<00:03:39.989> pick<00:03:40.170> in<00:03:41.239> and

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
so yep there we've got the pick in and

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.979 
so yep there we've got the pick in and
then<00:03:42.390> we<00:03:42.540> can<00:03:42.750> slide<00:03:43.200> that<00:03:43.530> along<00:03:43.860> to<00:03:44.160> release

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
then we can slide that along to release

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:52.309 
then we can slide that along to release
the<00:03:45.989> clips<00:03:46.290> inside<00:03:50.540> having<00:03:51.540> gone<00:03:51.690> round<00:03:51.930> and

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 
the clips inside having gone round and

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:54.440 
the clips inside having gone round and
removed<00:03:52.680> the<00:03:52.950> back<00:03:53.129> panel<00:03:53.519> of<00:03:53.610> the<00:03:53.670> laptop<00:03:54.209> we

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
removed the back panel of the laptop we

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.780 
removed the back panel of the laptop we
can<00:03:54.480> now<00:03:54.780> see<00:03:55.110> there<00:03:55.440> isn't<00:03:55.560> a<00:03:55.769> great<00:03:56.069> deal<00:03:56.129> of

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
can now see there isn't a great deal of

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.550 
can now see there isn't a great deal of
things<00:03:57.060> that<00:03:57.360> you<00:03:57.450> can<00:03:57.660> replace<00:03:57.870> inside<00:03:58.379> the

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
things that you can replace inside the

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.979 
things that you can replace inside the
laptop<00:03:58.739> and<00:03:59.720> processor<00:04:00.720> and<00:04:00.870> memory

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
laptop and processor and memory

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:03.339 
laptop and processor and memory
obviously<00:04:01.440> soldered<00:04:02.160> down<00:04:02.340> on<00:04:02.730> this<00:04:03.000> system

00:04:03.339 --> 00:04:03.349 
obviously soldered down on this system

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:06.800 
obviously soldered down on this system
but<00:04:04.349> what<00:04:04.470> we<00:04:04.590> can<00:04:04.769> access<00:04:05.310> is<00:04:05.610> the<00:04:06.239> standard

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
but what we can access is the standard

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.500 
but what we can access is the standard
two<00:04:07.049> and<00:04:07.200> a<00:04:07.230> half<00:04:07.379> inch<00:04:07.620> hard<00:04:07.890> drive<00:04:08.220> and<00:04:08.549> we

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
two and a half inch hard drive and we

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.210 
two and a half inch hard drive and we
have<00:04:09.690> the<00:04:09.870> power<00:04:10.019> board<00:04:10.290> here<00:04:10.650> and<00:04:10.890> we<00:04:11.040> can

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
have the power board here and we can

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.949 
have the power board here and we can
also<00:04:11.310> replace<00:04:11.519> the<00:04:11.730> internal<00:04:12.360> battery<00:04:12.510> pack

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
also replace the internal battery pack

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:16.750 
also replace the internal battery pack
and<00:04:13.430> wireless<00:04:14.430> mini<00:04:14.910> PCI<00:04:15.360> Express<00:04:15.750> card<00:04:16.109> and

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
and wireless mini PCI Express card and

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.509 
and wireless mini PCI Express card and
so<00:04:17.760> the<00:04:17.880> hard<00:04:18.030> drive<00:04:18.269> is<00:04:18.510> removed<00:04:18.870> by<00:04:19.519> these

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
so the hard drive is removed by these

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:24.290 
so the hard drive is removed by these
three<00:04:20.910> screws<00:04:21.350> here<00:04:22.350> holding<00:04:22.919> down<00:04:23.070> the<00:04:23.300> three

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
three screws here holding down the three

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.450 
three screws here holding down the three
or<00:04:24.419> four<00:04:24.630> screws<00:04:24.960> here<00:04:25.169> so<00:04:25.410> holding<00:04:26.100> down<00:04:26.160> the

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
or four screws here so holding down the

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.300 
or four screws here so holding down the
cradle<00:04:26.880> it's<00:04:27.060> on<00:04:27.350> and<00:04:28.350> with<00:04:28.680> that<00:04:28.830> removed<00:04:28.979> we

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
cradle it's on and with that removed we

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.310 
cradle it's on and with that removed we
can<00:04:29.340> also<00:04:29.550> release<00:04:30.210> the<00:04:30.419> keyboard<00:04:30.900> so<00:04:31.110> that<00:04:31.139> we

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
can also release the keyboard so that we

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.070 
can also release the keyboard so that we
can<00:04:31.470> remove<00:04:31.680> that<00:04:31.740> if<00:04:32.360> there's<00:04:33.360> any<00:04:33.510> issues

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
can remove that if there's any issues

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.740 
can remove that if there's any issues
with<00:04:34.320> the<00:04:34.440> AC<00:04:34.590> adapter<00:04:35.310> this<00:04:36.030> board<00:04:36.300> here<00:04:36.539> can

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
with the AC adapter this board here can

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.379 
with the AC adapter this board here can
be<00:04:36.870> removed<00:04:37.199> with<00:04:37.470> this<00:04:37.650> screw<00:04:37.979> and

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:38.389 
be removed with this screw and

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:42.050 
be removed with this screw and
disconnecting<00:04:39.389> this<00:04:39.479> ribbon<00:04:39.780> cable<00:04:39.810> and<00:04:41.060> and

disconnecting this ribbon cable and and

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.000 
disconnecting this ribbon cable and and
that's<00:04:42.330> also<00:04:42.810> good<00:04:43.050> if<00:04:43.289> there's<00:04:43.530> any<00:04:43.650> damage

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
that's also good if there's any damage

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:45.950 
that's also good if there's any damage
to<00:04:44.220> the<00:04:44.310> AC<00:04:44.460> connector<00:04:45.150> you<00:04:45.389> only<00:04:45.600> have<00:04:45.840> to

to the AC connector you only have to

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.900 
to the AC connector you only have to
replace<00:04:46.080> this<00:04:46.440> small<00:04:46.860> board<00:04:47.160> here<00:04:47.490> not<00:04:47.789> the

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
replace this small board here not the

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.110 
replace this small board here not the

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
soldiering parts so a fairly easy system

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.250 
soldiering parts so a fairly easy system
to<00:04:55.500> get<00:04:55.620> into<00:04:56.010> just<00:04:56.310> be<00:04:56.430> careful<00:04:56.880> while

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:57.260 
to get into just be careful while

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.770 
to get into just be careful while
releasing<00:04:58.370> the<00:04:59.370> little<00:04:59.669> plastic<00:04:59.970> Clips<00:05:00.479> those

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
releasing the little plastic Clips those

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.830 
releasing the little plastic Clips those
are<00:05:00.960> quite<00:05:01.200> fiddly<00:05:01.530> on<00:05:01.830> this<00:05:02.039> and<00:05:02.360> and<00:05:03.360> there

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
are quite fiddly on this and and there

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.420 
are quite fiddly on this and and there
is<00:05:03.960> the<00:05:04.080> potential<00:05:04.380> to<00:05:04.650> cause<00:05:04.800> and<00:05:05.130> damage<00:05:05.400> to

is the potential to cause and damage to

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.879 
is the potential to cause and damage to
those<00:05:05.700> as<00:05:05.970> you're<00:05:06.120> going<00:05:06.270> around<00:05:06.479> and<00:05:07.110> I'll

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:07.889 
those as you're going around and I'll

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:10.640 
those as you're going around and I'll
admit<00:05:08.280> I<00:05:08.310> did<00:05:08.610> break<00:05:08.789> one<00:05:09.120> while<00:05:09.590> removing<00:05:10.590> the

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:10.650 
admit I did break one while removing the

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:13.129 
admit I did break one while removing the
back<00:05:10.800> panel<00:05:11.160> of<00:05:11.250> this<00:05:11.400> but<00:05:11.849> it<00:05:12.630> will<00:05:12.780> go<00:05:12.930> back

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:13.139 
back panel of this but it will go back

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:15.260 
back panel of this but it will go back
together<00:05:13.289> okay<00:05:13.770> with<00:05:14.039> the<00:05:14.280> one<00:05:14.490> damaged<00:05:14.910> but

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 
together okay with the one damaged but

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.089
