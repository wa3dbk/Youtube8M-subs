boiler<00:00:18.029> it's<00:00:18.300> a<00:00:18.359> little<00:00:18.630> larger<00:00:19.020> than<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:19.500> 100

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
boiler it's a little larger than the 100

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.279 
boiler it's a little larger than the 100
but<00:00:20.580> it<00:00:20.820> does<00:00:21.029> still<00:00:21.330> fit<00:00:21.689> in<00:00:21.840> a<00:00:21.900> very<00:00:22.109> nice

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289

does is it allows the boiler to have its

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.400 
does is it allows the boiler to have its
required<00:00:43.290> flow<00:00:43.710> rate<00:00:44.420> without<00:00:45.420> having<00:00:46.260> to

is<00:02:18.710> depending<00:02:19.280> on<00:02:19.430> the<00:02:19.610> temperature<00:02:20.120> and<00:02:20.300> the

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
is depending on the temperature and the

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.950 
is depending on the temperature and the
required<00:02:22.100> water<00:02:23.030> temperature<00:02:23.510> inside<00:02:23.900> the

required water temperature inside the

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.650 
required water temperature inside the
house<00:02:24.290> the<00:02:25.120> calculations<00:02:26.120> come<00:02:26.330> out<00:02:26.450> of<00:02:26.570> the

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
house the calculations come out of the

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.770 
house the calculations come out of the
boiler<00:02:26.990> computer<00:02:27.470> and<00:02:27.740> run<00:02:28.520> the<00:02:28.550> water<00:02:28.790> okay

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
boiler computer and run the water okay

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.990 
boiler computer and run the water okay
I'd<00:02:29.870> like<00:02:30.020> to<00:02:30.200> talk<00:02:30.410> to<00:02:30.590> you<00:02:30.680> about<00:02:30.800> the<00:02:31.160> the

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
I'd like to talk to you about the the

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.960 
I'd like to talk to you about the the
lambda<00:02:32.720> probe<00:02:32.990> gas<00:02:33.320> valve<00:02:33.710> it's<00:02:34.580> a<00:02:34.760> very

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
lambda probe gas valve it's a very

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.060 
lambda probe gas valve it's a very
important<00:02:35.450> piece<00:02:35.690> exclusive<00:02:36.440> to<00:02:36.620> V<00:02:36.770> ceman

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
important piece exclusive to V ceman

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.670 
important piece exclusive to V ceman
really<00:02:37.910> interesting<00:02:38.390> piece<00:02:38.660> what<00:02:38.990> it<00:02:39.110> does<00:02:39.350> is

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
really interesting piece what it does is

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.570 
really interesting piece what it does is
it<00:02:40.100> takes<00:02:40.460> the<00:02:40.850> air<00:02:41.720> and<00:02:42.050> the<00:02:42.410> gas<00:02:42.590> and<00:02:43.010> mixes

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
it takes the air and the gas and mixes

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.940 
it takes the air and the gas and mixes
to<00:02:43.820> a<00:02:43.850> perfect<00:02:44.360> mixture<00:02:44.690> and<00:02:45.020> it's<00:02:45.470> checking

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
to a perfect mixture and it's checking

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.680 
to a perfect mixture and it's checking
itself<00:02:46.430> over<00:02:46.730> and<00:02:46.850> over<00:02:47.030> again<00:02:47.120> all<00:02:47.480> the<00:02:47.660> time

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
itself over and over again all the time

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.710 
itself over and over again all the time
to<00:02:48.110> make<00:02:48.290> sure<00:02:48.320> it's<00:02:48.650> got<00:02:48.800> pure<00:02:49.160> burn<00:02:49.720> it's

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
to make sure it's got pure burn it's

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.600 
to make sure it's got pure burn it's
great<00:02:51.200> technology<00:02:51.860> and<00:02:51.890> you<00:02:52.250> can<00:02:52.400> guarantee

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
great technology and you can guarantee

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.090 
great technology and you can guarantee
when<00:02:53.150> you<00:02:53.240> do<00:02:53.420> a<00:02:53.450> combustion<00:02:53.930> test<00:02:54.410> that

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
when you do a combustion test that

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.650 
when you do a combustion test that
you're<00:02:55.340> going<00:02:55.459> to<00:02:55.520> be<00:02:55.640> darn<00:02:55.850> close<00:02:56.120> to<00:02:56.390> perfect

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
you're going to be darn close to perfect

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.870 
you're going to be darn close to perfect
combustion<00:02:57.110> all<00:02:57.410> the<00:02:57.590> time<00:02:57.830> there<00:02:58.430> is<00:02:58.459> another

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
combustion all the time there is another

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.699 
combustion all the time there is another
thing<00:02:59.150> that's<00:02:59.390> kind<00:02:59.810> of<00:02:59.930> nice<00:03:00.140> about<00:03:00.200> this

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
thing that's kind of nice about this

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:04.210 
thing that's kind of nice about this
boiler<00:03:01.070> setup<00:03:01.430> is<00:03:01.990> the<00:03:02.990> option<00:03:03.470> of<00:03:03.530> fuels<00:03:03.860> is

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
boiler setup is the option of fuels is

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.970 
boiler setup is the option of fuels is
there<00:03:04.940> if<00:03:05.150> you<00:03:05.209> want<00:03:05.690> to<00:03:05.870> burn<00:03:06.080> say<00:03:06.440> propane

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
there if you want to burn say propane

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.680 
there if you want to burn say propane
you<00:03:07.430> don't<00:03:07.640> have<00:03:07.850> to<00:03:07.940> go<00:03:08.060> through<00:03:08.360> the<00:03:08.510> process

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
you don't have to go through the process

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.490 
you don't have to go through the process
of<00:03:09.110> actually<00:03:09.790> converting<00:03:10.790> orifices<00:03:11.420> etc<00:03:11.989> what

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
of actually converting orifices etc what

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.229 
of actually converting orifices etc what
you<00:03:12.650> can<00:03:12.830> do<00:03:13.010> is<00:03:13.220> you<00:03:13.370> basically<00:03:13.489> tell<00:03:14.090> the

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
you can do is you basically tell the

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:15.880 
you can do is you basically tell the
boiler<00:03:14.450> what<00:03:14.810> it's<00:03:14.930> burning<00:03:15.410> and<00:03:15.590> then

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
boiler what it's burning and then

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.430 
boiler what it's burning and then
through<00:03:16.400> the<00:03:17.000> lambda<00:03:17.330> Pro<00:03:17.540> it<00:03:17.780> actually

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
through the lambda Pro it actually

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.860 
through the lambda Pro it actually
adapts<00:03:19.070> itself<00:03:19.340> to<00:03:19.580> burn<00:03:19.820> that<00:03:20.060> fuel<00:03:20.420> so

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
adapts itself to burn that fuel so

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.780 
adapts itself to burn that fuel so
that's<00:03:21.350> kind<00:03:21.650> of<00:03:21.739> a<00:03:21.830> really<00:03:22.040> nice<00:03:22.250> thing<00:03:22.580> and

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
that's kind of a really nice thing and

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.380 
that's kind of a really nice thing and
it<00:03:22.850> reduces<00:03:23.709> you<00:03:24.709> know<00:03:24.850> initial<00:03:25.850> startup

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390 
it reduces you know initial startup

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:27.970 
it reduces you know initial startup
because<00:03:26.810> you<00:03:26.930> don't<00:03:27.110> have<00:03:27.260> to<00:03:27.350> take<00:03:27.470> it<00:03:27.530> apart

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
because you don't have to take it apart

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.740 
because you don't have to take it apart

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470 
it's kind of a nice feature because we

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.920 
it's kind of a nice feature because we
can<00:05:07.920> put<00:05:08.100> on<00:05:08.250> the<00:05:08.370> board<00:05:08.580> and<00:05:08.820> we<00:05:09.510> can<00:05:09.660> put<00:05:09.840> it

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 
boiler and what it does is it allows us

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.620 
boiler and what it does is it allows us
to<00:05:15.480> power<00:05:15.660> our<00:05:15.930> pumps<00:05:16.380> closer<00:05:17.190> to<00:05:17.520> them<00:05:17.730> it

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:18.630 
to power our pumps closer to them it

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.530 
to power our pumps closer to them it
utilizes<00:05:19.230> a<00:05:19.440> plug<00:05:20.130> which<00:05:20.370> makes<00:05:20.970> for<00:05:21.180> ease<00:05:21.360> of

utilizes a plug which makes for ease of
installation<00:05:22.580> we<00:05:23.580> opted<00:05:24.150> out<00:05:24.210> for<00:05:24.480> a<00:05:24.510> switch

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:24.810 
installation we opted out for a switch

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:28.370 
installation we opted out for a switch
to<00:05:25.020> kill<00:05:25.230> everything<00:05:25.500> but<00:05:25.890> a<00:05:26.520> plug<00:05:27.060> is<00:05:27.210> fine

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380 
to kill everything but a plug is fine

elimination on this system
I<00:05:36.150> also<00:05:36.750> like<00:05:37.020> to<00:05:37.140> talk<00:05:37.320> a<00:05:37.350> little<00:05:37.560> bit<00:05:37.680> about

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:37.950 
I also like to talk a little bit about

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:40.340 
I also like to talk a little bit about
the<00:05:38.130> low<00:05:38.280> loss<00:05:38.460> header<00:05:38.790> um<00:05:39.120> it's<00:05:39.840> much<00:05:40.080> in<00:05:40.260> a

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:40.350 
the low loss header um it's much in a

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:42.590 
the low loss header um it's much in a
way<00:05:40.530> like<00:05:40.770> a<00:05:40.830> clutch<00:05:41.310> in<00:05:41.490> a<00:05:41.580> car<00:05:41.850> what<00:05:42.210> it<00:05:42.330> does

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:42.600 
way like a clutch in a car what it does

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.980 
way like a clutch in a car what it does
is<00:05:42.900> it<00:05:43.080> allows<00:05:43.740> the<00:05:44.280> flow<00:05:44.760> of<00:05:44.790> water<00:05:45.210> from<00:05:45.810> the

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:45.990 
is it allows the flow of water from the

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:50.330 
is it allows the flow of water from the
boiler<00:05:46.380> out<00:05:47.510> through<00:05:48.510> and<00:05:48.870> back<00:05:49.170> in<00:05:49.440> and<00:05:49.740> that

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:50.340 
boiler out through and back in and that

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:52.850 
boiler out through and back in and that
allows<00:05:51.150> the<00:05:51.390> boiler<00:05:51.600> to<00:05:51.810> have<00:05:51.960> its<00:05:52.230> sufficient
