00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:17.889 
ways on the go this is a very very

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:23.040 
ways on the go this is a very very
useful<00:04:18.220> app<00:04:18.639> to<00:04:18.880> have<00:04:19.090> a<00:04:21.630> very<00:04:22.630> very<00:04:22.900> useful

straightforward<00:04:26.289> if<00:04:26.830> you're<00:04:26.979> not

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
straightforward if you're not

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.399 
straightforward if you're not
synchronizing<00:04:27.700> files<00:04:27.940> and<00:04:28.180> do<00:04:28.270> so<00:04:28.450> now<00:04:28.690> one

00:04:29.399 --> 00:04:29.409 
synchronizing files and do so now one

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:30.580 
synchronizing files and do so now one
thing<00:04:29.590> I<00:04:29.650> will<00:04:29.710> quickly<00:04:30.130> show<00:04:30.250> you

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
thing I will quickly show you

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.240 
thing I will quickly show you
just<00:04:30.680> before<00:04:30.800> go<00:04:31.130> is<00:04:31.400> let's<00:04:31.610> take<00:04:31.790> a<00:04:31.820> photo<00:04:32.090> and

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
just before go is let's take a photo and

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.880 
just before go is let's take a photo and
you'll<00:04:34.250> see<00:04:34.460> it<00:04:34.580> synchronize<00:04:35.000> up<00:04:35.210> to<00:04:35.390> the

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:35.890 
you'll see it synchronize up to the

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:43.930 
you'll see it synchronize up to the
cloud<00:04:36.890> itself<00:04:37.250> so<00:04:37.900> here<00:04:38.900> we<00:04:38.960> go<00:04:42.760> now<00:04:43.760> what

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
cloud itself so here we go now what

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.810 
cloud itself so here we go now what
should<00:04:44.180> happen<00:04:44.450> in<00:04:44.720> a<00:04:44.780> moment<00:04:45.140> is<00:04:46.040> the<00:04:46.370> final

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:46.820 
should happen in a moment is the final

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:51.250 
should happen in a moment is the final
transfer<00:04:47.150> dialog<00:04:47.570> appears<00:04:47.690> here<00:04:50.080> there<00:04:51.080> it<00:04:51.230> is

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:51.260 
transfer dialog appears here there it is

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.560 
transfer dialog appears here there it is
and<00:04:51.680> now<00:04:52.070> the<00:04:52.130> file<00:04:52.430> in<00:04:52.730> the<00:04:52.880> background<00:04:53.330> is

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:53.570 
and now the file in the background is

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:55.240 
and now the file in the background is
immediately<00:04:54.290> being<00:04:54.620> uploaded<00:04:54.890> to<00:04:55.130> the<00:04:55.220> cloud

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.250 
immediately being uploaded to the cloud

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.910 
immediately being uploaded to the cloud
so<00:04:56.110> you<00:04:57.110> don't<00:04:57.290> even<00:04:57.350> have<00:04:57.470> to<00:04:57.650> see<00:04:57.770> this

00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:57.920 
so you don't even have to see this

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:58.990 
so you don't even have to see this
happening<00:04:58.220> that<00:04:58.370> was<00:04:58.460> going<00:04:58.610> to<00:04:58.670> tap<00:04:58.820> on<00:04:58.970> it

00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.000 
happening that was going to tap on it

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.400 
happening that was going to tap on it
now<00:04:59.240> just<00:04:59.480> so<00:04:59.570> you<00:04:59.660> can<00:04:59.750> see<00:04:59.810> the<00:05:00.020> transfer

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:00.410 
now just so you can see the transfer

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:02.860 
now just so you can see the transfer
dialogue<00:05:00.890> and<00:05:01.190> see<00:05:01.580> the<00:05:01.670> foot<00:05:01.820> all<00:05:02.180> the<00:05:02.240> box

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:02.870 
dialogue and see the foot all the box

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.350 
dialogue and see the foot all the box
files<00:05:03.170> have<00:05:03.410> been<00:05:03.470> uploaded<00:05:03.760> I've<00:05:04.760> downloaded
