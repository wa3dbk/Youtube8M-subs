that's amazing at 15 16 17 years of age
here's<00:03:52.450> an<00:03:52.600> example<00:03:52.900> of<00:03:53.410> students<00:03:53.980> being

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:54.549 
here's an example of students being

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:57.000 
here's an example of students being
really<00:03:55.239> in<00:03:55.420> college<00:03:55.900> so<00:03:56.139> not<00:03:56.350> only<00:03:56.440> they<00:03:56.709> ready
