00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:06.759
 and well, welcome here to a 

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:08.860
 new video and well let's do 

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:11.800
 what for me is the most important thing 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:16.059
 within the interests of big cars 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:19.349
 5 and it's going to the house of dj or what 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:22.179
 has been the destroyed grow that 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:24.489
 then we have here marked in 

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:24.730
 our radar the place where we go to 

00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:28.300
 to go 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:30.489
 I'm not sure 100% if it is but good 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.500
 well, let's go see the role to see 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:35.680
 what do we find, according to me? 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.910
 remember there was a bridge a bridge by 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.840
 the one that you climbed 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:42.610
 to get to his at home not but good 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:46.600
 It seems that the bridge is not moving 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:48.910
 in these directions but good we are going to 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.590
 give us the roland or if here is the good 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:54.860
 this is not a bridge 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:59.320
 this is what was grow street it seems 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.320
 be that this is what was grow street 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:06.140
 if this seems to be serious street 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.180
 a little 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.180
 disappointing 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:18.630
 a little disappointing honestly about 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:21.810
 all because good was marked by a 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.090
 for let's say something intense here 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:28.210
 pro but here we can see if I do not 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:31.330
 I 'm wrong and if this guy really 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.440
 maybe not good because I'm not mistaken 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.080
 This is what is still the groove 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.909
 street the house d 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:40.130
 well the house of then is to say 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:41.220
 it should be this we are seeing 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.740
 here 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.470
 and good 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.690
 because they were supposed to have a court of 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.490
 you're not going to be here in lie I'm 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.220
 I'm very half asshole this is the house 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:56.780
 openwork 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:02:00.409
 I can not cross from the other side 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:05.040
 because it's because there's a 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:08.880
 what is a collectible called an east 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:11.310
 here back then here is this 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.460
 collectable 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:17.550
 I do not know what is fragment 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:20.760
 a fragment that says well fragment 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:23.190
 collected to spend around the mystery 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.800
 of the murder of leonard leonora johnson 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:29.020
 if dj's mom 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.730
 then we can discover the 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.690
 seem with these fragments what 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.690
 it's been him 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:40.480
 of the murder and I remember that this house 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:43.960
 It was also yours because you could put a 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:46.210
 car was east west of here not what 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:48.130
 I remember very well but the point is that 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:51.250
 well this is the serious tweets not 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:53.740
 I'm still happy to know in 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:57.610
 be sure of what was the house of dj 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:59.380
 good where where this lived but then 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.960
 obviously they do not seem like time 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.600
 what happened between big auto san andreas 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:07.000
 and great picture 5 because he could do the 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.910
 not changes but then this is what for 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.320
 me is the email is the most important with 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.080
 regarding big false 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.400
 sanz of these big cars 5 obviously 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.350
 because with the passage of time we will go 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:21.200
 discovering some things surely 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:25.390
 rockstar has kept some 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:28.959
 Well, some things with regard to 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:31.370
 sorry to san andreas for example 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:33.950
 related to this not and well then 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:36.440
 this is where it is located where is the 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:39.880
 they receive says grow street garage 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:43.489
 Libya that we are really close to the 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:45.290
 of agro street and this is still being 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:47.370
 this street simply that well no no what 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:50.069
 they put like a 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.480
 let's say that as a circular one that was 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:53.700
 as it was in san andreas that was a 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.500
 place to put your stuff and then 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.380
 It is near d 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.080
 Really, it's not good people, this has 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.940
 been everything I hope you liked it 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:05.480
 as I say a little disappointing the 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:07.560
 see what has been this way 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.720
 I expected a little more details 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.610
 curious maybe with regard to that but 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.200
 it may be so it's a matter of 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.090
 wait a little bit is not good people 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.100
 I hope you liked this 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.220
 I say goodbye see you next and for 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.220
 you
