we<00:02:49.820> in<00:02:49.970> the<00:02:50.120> cichlid<00:02:50.690> walkthrough

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:38.670 

even<00:03:09.580> though<00:03:09.700> weight<00:03:09.970> falls<00:03:10.320> under<00:03:37.380> so<00:03:38.380> I

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
even though weight falls under so I

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.530 
even though weight falls under so I
