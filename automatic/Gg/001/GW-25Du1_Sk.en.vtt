you tips about practicing changing and

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
between each so that the cord learning

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.000 
between each so that the cord learning
process<00:03:01.580> becomes<00:03:01.910> easier<00:03:02.480> later<00:03:03.110> on<00:03:03.320> I<00:03:03.740> just

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
process becomes easier later on I just

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.320 
process becomes easier later on I just
wanted<00:03:04.250> to<00:03:04.280> add<00:03:04.520> that<00:03:04.550> whenever<00:03:05.030> you're

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
wanted to add that whenever you're

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.240 
wanted to add that whenever you're
playing<00:03:05.600> a<00:03:05.750> song<00:03:06.050> that<00:03:06.080> has<00:03:06.440> a<00:03:06.470> seventh<00:03:07.160> chord

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.160 
playing a song that has a seventh chord
in<00:03:07.790> it<00:03:07.970> it's<00:03:08.510> always<00:03:09.140> okay<00:03:09.770> to<00:03:09.800> play<00:03:10.870> the<00:03:11.870> major

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
in it it's always okay to play the major

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.110 
in it it's always okay to play the major
chord<00:03:12.650> instead<00:03:13.220> of<00:03:13.250> playing<00:03:13.610> the<00:03:13.820> seventh

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
chord instead of playing the seventh

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.340 
chord instead of playing the seventh
chord<00:03:14.330> if<00:03:14.420> you<00:03:14.510> don't<00:03:14.660> know<00:03:14.840> the<00:03:15.020> seventh

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
chord if you don't know the seventh

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.290 
chord if you don't know the seventh
chord<00:03:15.560> for<00:03:15.710> example<00:03:16.040> if<00:03:16.130> you<00:03:16.220> see<00:03:16.370> a<00:03:16.400> song<00:03:16.730> with

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.300 
chord for example if you see a song with

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.140 
chord for example if you see a song with
a<00:03:17.330> c7<00:03:18.460> it's<00:03:19.460> like<00:03:19.640> this<00:03:19.820> you're<00:03:20.000> going<00:03:20.090> to

a c7 it's like this you're going to

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.870 
a c7 it's like this you're going to
learn<00:03:20.330> it<00:03:20.510> later<00:03:20.810> don't<00:03:20.960> worry<00:03:21.550> if<00:03:22.550> you<00:03:22.610> see<00:03:22.850> a

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
learn it later don't worry if you see a

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.210 
learn it later don't worry if you see a
song<00:03:23.030> with<00:03:23.150> that<00:03:23.180> then<00:03:23.570> you<00:03:23.660> can<00:03:23.840> play<00:03:24.220> instead

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
song with that then you can play instead

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.130 
song with that then you can play instead
it's<00:03:25.850> not<00:03:26.120> gonna<00:03:26.270> sound<00:03:26.570> terrible<00:03:26.780> it's<00:03:27.050> not

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
it's not gonna sound terrible it's not

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.270 
it's not gonna sound terrible it's not
going<00:03:27.260> to<00:03:27.350> sound<00:03:27.470> as<00:03:27.650> good<00:03:27.710> as<00:03:28.160> the<00:03:28.250> original

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
going to sound as good as the original

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.430 
going to sound as good as the original
but<00:03:29.030> it<00:03:29.150> will<00:03:29.270> still<00:03:29.480> allow<00:03:29.660> you<00:03:29.810> to<00:03:30.020> play<00:03:30.260> the

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
but it will still allow you to play the

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:31.660 
but it will still allow you to play the
song<00:03:30.620> so<00:03:30.770> you<00:03:30.830> don't<00:03:30.980> have<00:03:31.040> to<00:03:31.190> go<00:03:31.310> to<00:03:31.370> another

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
song so you don't have to go to another

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.670 
song so you don't have to go to another
song<00:03:31.940> just<00:03:32.180> because<00:03:32.210> you<00:03:32.540> can't<00:03:32.750> play<00:03:32.900> c7<00:03:33.560> and

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
song just because you can't play c7 and

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.650 
song just because you can't play c7 and
then<00:03:34.130> when<00:03:34.370> you<00:03:34.490> learn<00:03:34.670> the<00:03:34.850> cord<00:03:35.090> later<00:03:35.390> on

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
then when you learn the cord later on

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.480 
then when you learn the cord later on
you<00:03:36.320> can<00:03:36.470> go<00:03:36.590> back<00:03:36.740> to<00:03:36.800> the<00:03:36.980> song<00:03:37.130> and<00:03:37.250> you<00:03:37.340> can

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:37.490 
you can go back to the song and you can

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:40.390 
you can go back to the song and you can
play<00:03:37.670> it<00:03:37.700> as<00:03:37.940> it<00:03:38.000> is<00:03:38.600> played<00:03:39.080> originally<00:03:39.410> same
