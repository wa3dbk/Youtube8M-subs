00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
because I picked up and knit I started

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.299 
because I picked up and knit I started
with<00:01:00.899> one<00:01:01.109> square<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:01.530> then<00:01:01.649> I<00:01:01.739> picked<00:01:01.980> up<00:01:02.100> and

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
with one square and then I picked up and

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.889 
with one square and then I picked up and
knit<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.579> next<00:01:02.730> one<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:03.270> picked<00:01:03.420> up<00:01:03.539> into<00:01:03.780> the

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
knit the next one and picked up into the

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.250 
knit the next one and picked up into the
next<00:01:04.140> one<00:01:04.290> but<00:01:05.040> each<00:01:05.909> of<00:01:05.970> these<00:01:06.360> squares<00:01:06.780> had<00:01:07.229> a

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
next one but each of these squares had a

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.890 
next one but each of these squares had a
beginning<00:01:07.610> to<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.729> yarn<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.330> an<00:01:09.420> end<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:09.780> the

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
beginning to the yarn and an end to the

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.750 
beginning to the yarn and an end to the
yarn<00:01:10.170> so<00:01:10.710> I<00:01:10.979> ended<00:01:11.490> up<00:01:11.610> with<00:01:12.020> exactly<00:01:13.159> 100<00:01:14.159> yarn

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
yarn so I ended up with exactly 100 yarn

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.820 
yarn so I ended up with exactly 100 yarn
ends<00:01:15.000> I<00:01:15.380> tried<00:01:16.380> to<00:01:16.920> knit<00:01:17.490> them<00:01:17.610> in<00:01:17.850> at<00:01:18.350> as<00:01:19.350> I<00:01:19.619> was

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
ends I tried to knit them in at as I was

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.950 
ends I tried to knit them in at as I was
picking<00:01:20.490> up<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:21.060> that<00:01:21.390> wasn't<00:01:21.780> very

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
picking up and that wasn't very

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.440 
picking up and that wasn't very
satisfactory<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.070> I<00:01:23.400> tried<00:01:23.700> several<00:01:24.030> other

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
satisfactory and I tried several other

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.380 
satisfactory and I tried several other
methods<00:01:24.750> but<00:01:25.619> really<00:01:26.220> I'm<00:01:26.820> a<00:01:26.880> little<00:01:27.240> bit

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
methods but really I'm a little bit

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.620 
methods but really I'm a little bit
persnickety<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.400> this<00:01:29.400> is<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:30.000> method<00:01:30.450> that

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
persnickety and this is the method that

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.100 
persnickety and this is the method that
I<00:01:31.200> think<00:01:32.070> looks<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.640> best<00:01:32.850> so<00:01:33.630> I<00:01:33.659> want<00:01:33.930> to<00:01:33.960> show

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
I think looks the best so I want to show

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.640 
I think looks the best so I want to show
it<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.350> you<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:34.770> let's<00:01:35.189> get<00:01:35.340> started<00:01:36.650> the

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
it to you and let's get started the

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.660 
it to you and let's get started the
whole<00:01:37.979> purpose<00:01:38.520> of<00:01:38.850> duplicate<00:01:39.479> stitch<00:01:39.630> is<00:01:40.020> to

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
whole purpose of duplicate stitch is to

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.210 
whole purpose of duplicate stitch is to
duplicate<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:42.180> look<00:01:42.479> of<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:43.560> stitches<00:01:44.009> that

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
duplicate the look of the stitches that

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.700 
duplicate the look of the stitches that
you<00:01:44.520> have<00:01:45.060> in<00:01:45.270> front<00:01:45.509> of<00:01:45.689> you<00:01:45.899> if<00:01:46.110> it<00:01:46.860> is<00:01:47.159> a

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
you have in front of you if it is a

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.560 
you have in front of you if it is a
stockinette<00:01:49.710> stitch<00:01:49.860> you<00:01:50.610> duplicate<00:01:51.240> by

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
stockinette stitch you duplicate by

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:52.999 
stockinette stitch you duplicate by
going<00:01:52.079> in<00:01:52.259> there

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
going in there

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.530 
going in there
coming<00:01:53.310> around<00:01:54.020> going<00:01:55.020> under<00:01:55.950> those<00:01:56.250> two<00:01:56.700> it's

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
coming around going under those two it's

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.719 
coming around going under those two it's
I've<00:01:57.960> already<00:01:58.380> shown<00:01:58.619> you<00:01:58.649> how<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:58.979> graft<00:01:59.460> it's

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
I've already shown you how to graft it's

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.480 
I've already shown you how to graft it's
very<00:01:59.939> similar<00:02:00.210> to<00:02:00.329> grafting<00:02:00.899> going<00:02:01.829> there

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
very similar to grafting going there

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.149 
very similar to grafting going there
coming<00:02:03.390> around<00:02:03.750> so<00:02:04.079> you<00:02:04.140> it's<00:02:04.619> easy<00:02:04.950> to

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
coming around so you it's easy to

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.930 
coming around so you it's easy to
duplicate<00:02:05.670> this<00:02:05.850> one<00:02:06.090> but<00:02:06.960> you'll<00:02:07.500> see<00:02:07.940> that

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
duplicate this one but you'll see that

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.910 
duplicate this one but you'll see that
it's<00:02:09.119> a<00:02:09.209> little<00:02:09.479> more<00:02:09.690> tricky<00:02:09.959> with<00:02:10.440> garter

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
it's a little more tricky with garter

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.460 
it's a little more tricky with garter
stitch<00:02:11.190> which<00:02:11.550> this<00:02:11.879> is<00:02:12.150> because<00:02:12.780> it<00:02:12.930> looks

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
stitch which this is because it looks

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.550 
stitch which this is because it looks
a<00:02:13.500> lot<00:02:13.650> like<00:02:14.100> reverse<00:02:14.700> stockinette<00:02:15.450> which<00:02:16.260> it

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
a lot like reverse stockinette which it

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.990 
a lot like reverse stockinette which it
is<00:02:16.710> not<00:02:17.010> and<00:02:17.340> the<00:02:17.970> reason<00:02:18.540> is<00:02:19.730> see<00:02:20.730> how<00:02:20.850> these

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
is not and the reason is see how these

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.620 
is not and the reason is see how these
purl<00:02:21.270> bumps<00:02:21.660> are<00:02:22.970> stacked<00:02:23.970> on<00:02:24.180> one<00:02:24.360> another

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
purl bumps are stacked on one another

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.660 
purl bumps are stacked on one another
these<00:02:25.200> purl<00:02:25.500> bumps<00:02:25.830> are<00:02:25.950> stacked<00:02:26.280> on<00:02:26.460> one

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
these purl bumps are stacked on one

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.460 
these purl bumps are stacked on one
another<00:02:27.140> but<00:02:28.140> if<00:02:28.290> you<00:02:28.320> pull<00:02:28.770> this<00:02:29.040> apart<00:02:30.470> you

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
another but if you pull this apart you

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.420 
another but if you pull this apart you
can<00:02:31.710> see<00:02:32.160> that<00:02:32.790> there<00:02:33.150> are<00:02:33.620> knits<00:02:34.620> under<00:02:35.130> there

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
can see that there are knits under there

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.220 
can see that there are knits under there
and<00:02:35.610> then<00:02:36.450> a<00:02:36.750> little<00:02:37.080> pearl<00:02:37.620> frown<00:02:38.160> and<00:02:38.870> then<00:02:39.870> a

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
and then a little pearl frown and then a

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.280 
and then a little pearl frown and then a
knit<00:02:40.770> which<00:02:41.760> it<00:02:42.120> was<00:02:42.330> knit<00:02:42.570> from<00:02:42.810> this<00:02:43.020> side

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
knit which it was knit from this side

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.910 
knit which it was knit from this side
this<00:02:44.250> one<00:02:44.580> was<00:02:45.540> knit<00:02:45.959> from<00:02:46.260> the<00:02:46.380> other<00:02:46.560> side

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
this one was knit from the other side

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.670 
this one was knit from the other side
and<00:02:47.190> that's<00:02:47.370> why<00:02:47.550> you<00:02:47.610> have<00:02:47.910> that<00:02:47.940> purl<00:02:48.330> bump

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
and that's why you have that purl bump

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:54.380 
and that's why you have that purl bump
so<00:02:50.060> when<00:02:51.060> you<00:02:51.300> do<00:02:51.630> duplicate<00:02:52.380> stitch<00:02:53.270> you<00:02:54.270> have

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
so when you do duplicate stitch you have

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:59.180 
so when you do duplicate stitch you have
to<00:02:54.510> be<00:02:54.660> very<00:02:54.959> careful<00:02:55.680> to<00:02:55.950> follow<00:02:56.850> and<00:02:58.190> you

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
to be very careful to follow and you

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.650 
to be very careful to follow and you
I've<00:02:59.340> chosen<00:02:59.670> this<00:02:59.940> is<00:03:00.090> the<00:03:00.209> wrong<00:03:00.420> side

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
I've chosen this is the wrong side

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.780 
I've chosen this is the wrong side
because<00:03:01.020> remember<00:03:01.530> because<00:03:02.190> garter<00:03:02.580> stitch

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
because remember because garter stitch

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.640 
because remember because garter stitch
is<00:03:03.030> the<00:03:03.060> same<00:03:03.450> on<00:03:03.630> both<00:03:03.660> sides<00:03:04.170> of<00:03:04.320> the<00:03:04.410> fabric

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
is the same on both sides of the fabric

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.330 
is the same on both sides of the fabric
you<00:03:05.370> choose<00:03:05.700> one<00:03:06.090> that<00:03:06.570> is<00:03:06.810> less<00:03:07.680> public<00:03:08.190> I

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
you choose one that is less public I

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.230 
you choose one that is less public I
mean<00:03:08.370> on<00:03:08.640> a<00:03:08.670> scarf<00:03:09.090> or<00:03:09.420> an<00:03:10.230> Afghan<00:03:10.950> and<00:03:11.250> that's

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.240 
mean on a scarf or an Afghan and that's

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.930 
mean on a scarf or an Afghan and that's
up<00:03:12.420> to<00:03:12.570> you<00:03:12.780> it's<00:03:13.230> half<00:03:14.100> a<00:03:14.190> dozen<00:03:14.340> to<00:03:14.520> one<00:03:14.700> and

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
up to you it's half a dozen to one and

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.110 
up to you it's half a dozen to one and
you<00:03:15.240> can<00:03:15.450> see<00:03:15.690> that<00:03:15.900> I've<00:03:16.050> followed<00:03:16.530> this

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
you can see that I've followed this

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.650 
you can see that I've followed this
here's<00:03:18.120> the<00:03:18.390> duplicate<00:03:18.930> stitch<00:03:19.340> on<00:03:20.660> the

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
here's the duplicate stitch on the

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.770 
here's the duplicate stitch on the
reverse<00:03:21.989> stockinette<00:03:23.150> so<00:03:24.150> you<00:03:24.239> can<00:03:24.390> see<00:03:24.600> that

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
reverse stockinette so you can see that

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.650 
reverse stockinette so you can see that
it<00:03:24.900> looks<00:03:25.140> different<00:03:26.090> you<00:03:27.090> can<00:03:27.269> see<00:03:27.450> that<00:03:27.630> I

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
it looks different you can see that I

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.800 
it looks different you can see that I
have<00:03:28.019> two<00:03:28.800> loops<00:03:29.430> whereas<00:03:30.030> this<00:03:30.209> one<00:03:30.450> kind<00:03:30.720> of

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
have two loops whereas this one kind of

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.140 
have two loops whereas this one kind of
looks<00:03:30.989> like<00:03:31.080> a<00:03:31.200> knitted<00:03:31.800> loop<00:03:32.010> it's<00:03:32.730> on<00:03:33.000> the

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
looks like a knitted loop it's on the

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.180 
looks like a knitted loop it's on the
other<00:03:33.330> side<00:03:33.720> that<00:03:33.930> you<00:03:34.080> can<00:03:34.290> really<00:03:34.650> see<00:03:35.040> the

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
other side that you can really see the

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:41.600 
other side that you can really see the
difference<00:03:39.410> notice<00:03:40.410> that<00:03:40.769> you<00:03:40.860> cannot<00:03:41.250> see

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
difference notice that you cannot see

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.270 
difference notice that you cannot see
any<00:03:42.110> stitches<00:03:43.110> well<00:03:43.380> I<00:03:43.650> mean<00:03:43.950> this<00:03:44.100> is<00:03:44.250> a

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
any stitches well I mean this is a

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.979 
any stitches well I mean this is a
different<00:03:44.430> color<00:03:44.790> yarn<00:03:45.030> so<00:03:45.299> you<00:03:45.330> can<00:03:45.660> see<00:03:45.870> it

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
different color yarn so you can see it

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:48.020 
different color yarn so you can see it
through<00:03:46.290> there<00:03:46.530> but<00:03:46.980> it's<00:03:47.100> invisible<00:03:47.489> on<00:03:47.820> this

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
through there but it's invisible on this

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.810 
through there but it's invisible on this
side<00:03:48.239> whereas<00:03:49.170> the<00:03:49.769> duplicate<00:03:50.280> stitch<00:03:50.400> for

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
side whereas the duplicate stitch for

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.120 
side whereas the duplicate stitch for
your<00:03:50.970> garter<00:03:51.390> stitch<00:03:51.630> is<00:03:51.930> visible<00:03:52.830> on<00:03:52.950> this

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
your garter stitch is visible on this

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.190 
your garter stitch is visible on this
side<00:03:53.340> so<00:03:53.700> let<00:03:54.090> me<00:03:54.209> go<00:03:54.360> ahead<00:03:54.450> and<00:03:54.570> show<00:03:54.810> you<00:03:54.870> how

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
side so let me go ahead and show you how

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.300 
side so let me go ahead and show you how
I've<00:03:55.380> done<00:03:55.590> this<00:03:56.570> first<00:03:57.570> of<00:03:57.720> all<00:03:57.900> leave<00:03:58.590> a<00:03:58.830> long

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
I've done this first of all leave a long

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.970 
I've done this first of all leave a long
end<00:03:59.600> you<00:04:00.600> should<00:04:00.810> always<00:04:01.049> do<00:04:01.380> that<00:04:01.530> and<00:04:01.590> when

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
end you should always do that and when

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.360 
end you should always do that and when
possible<00:04:02.310> break<00:04:03.150> off<00:04:03.410> the<00:04:04.410> end<00:04:04.620> rather<00:04:05.070> than

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
possible break off the end rather than

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.380 
possible break off the end rather than
cut<00:04:05.610> it<00:04:05.790> see<00:04:06.360> how<00:04:06.540> this<00:04:06.690> gives<00:04:06.900> you<00:04:07.170> a<00:04:07.200> nice

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
cut it see how this gives you a nice

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.229 
cut it see how this gives you a nice
tapered<00:04:09.390> and<00:04:09.660> thinning<00:04:10.640> yarn<00:04:11.640> end<00:04:11.910> so<00:04:12.209> that

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
tapered and thinning yarn end so that

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:14.150 
tapered and thinning yarn end so that
when<00:04:12.480> you<00:04:12.600> work<00:04:12.780> it<00:04:12.959> in<00:04:13.140> it<00:04:13.350> tends<00:04:13.680> to<00:04:13.799> want<00:04:14.010> to

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
when you work it in it tends to want to

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.210 
when you work it in it tends to want to
stay<00:04:14.310> put<00:04:14.640> better<00:04:14.910> than<00:04:15.209> if<00:04:15.450> you<00:04:15.480> do<00:04:16.130> if<00:04:17.130> you

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
stay put better than if you do if you

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.780 
stay put better than if you do if you
cut<00:04:17.580> that<00:04:17.760> blunt<00:04:18.150> end<00:04:18.390> off<00:04:18.739> okay<00:04:19.739> so<00:04:19.799> let<00:04:20.760> me

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:20.790 
cut that blunt end off okay so let me

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.050 
cut that blunt end off okay so let me
see<00:04:21.090> where<00:04:21.239> I<00:04:21.269> am<00:04:21.630> in<00:04:21.810> this<00:04:21.959> process

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:56.660 
directly over it pulled this leg a

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.980 
directly over it pulled this leg a
little<00:04:56.900> bit<00:04:57.200> tight<00:04:57.470> so<00:04:58.480> there<00:04:59.480> we<00:04:59.570> go<00:04:59.720> and

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
little bit tight so there we go and

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:01.600 
little bit tight so there we go and
straighten<00:05:00.290> that<00:05:00.530> out<00:05:00.590> and<00:05:01.010> you<00:05:01.220> can<00:05:01.250> always

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 
straighten that out and you can always

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.000 
straighten that out and you can always
tease<00:05:02.180> it<00:05:02.419> and<00:05:02.570> coax<00:05:02.810> it<00:05:03.020> with<00:05:03.200> your<00:05:03.440> needle<00:05:03.830> so

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.010 
tease it and coax it with your needle so

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:12.940 
tease it and coax it with your needle so
I'm<00:05:04.850> going<00:05:05.180> to<00:05:05.240> go<00:05:05.330> up

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:12.950 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:17.790 

follow<00:05:13.550> that<00:05:13.850> little<00:05:14.210> pearl<00:05:14.660> bump<00:05:15.020> of<00:05:15.200> a<00:05:15.320> frown

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.150 

go<00:05:18.800> back<00:05:19.040> into<00:05:19.340> the<00:05:19.610> hole<00:05:19.790> I<00:05:19.820> came<00:05:20.030> out<00:05:20.270> of<00:05:20.540> and

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:21.160 
go back into the hole I came out of and

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:25.300 
go back into the hole I came out of and
up<00:05:22.160> into<00:05:22.580> the<00:05:22.820> center<00:05:23.210> of<00:05:23.570> the<00:05:24.200> next<00:05:24.560> knit

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:25.310 
up into the center of the next knit

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:32.740 
up into the center of the next knit
stitch<00:05:30.310> of<00:05:31.310> course<00:05:31.610> you<00:05:31.820> would<00:05:32.060> be<00:05:32.090> using<00:05:32.600> the

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:32.750 
stitch of course you would be using the

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:36.880 
stitch of course you would be using the
same<00:05:33.050> yarn<00:05:34.600> rather<00:05:35.600> than<00:05:35.900> a<00:05:35.930> contrasting

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:36.890 
same yarn rather than a contrasting

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:41.920 
same yarn rather than a contrasting
color<00:05:39.220> but<00:05:40.220> I<00:05:40.520> think<00:05:40.970> it's<00:05:41.120> easier<00:05:41.540> for<00:05:41.780> you<00:05:41.900> to

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:41.930 
color but I think it's easier for you to

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:52.830 
color but I think it's easier for you to
see<00:05:42.320> if<00:05:42.470> I<00:05:42.620> do<00:05:42.680> it<00:05:42.950> this<00:05:43.100> way<00:05:47.770> one<00:05:48.770> more

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:52.840 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.560 

so<00:05:53.440> you<00:05:53.560> just<00:05:53.740> have<00:05:53.950> to<00:05:54.010> pull<00:05:54.460> that<00:05:54.820> garter

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:55.570 
so you just have to pull that garter

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:57.150 
so you just have to pull that garter
stitch<00:05:55.780> and<00:05:56.020> the<00:05:56.230> reason<00:05:56.500> I<00:05:56.560> doing<00:05:56.830> this<00:05:56.950> at

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:57.160 
stitch and the reason I doing this at

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:01.170 
stitch and the reason I doing this at
the<00:05:57.340> edge<00:05:57.490> is<00:05:57.880> because<00:05:58.419> when<00:05:58.990> I<00:05:59.020> did<00:05:59.470> that<00:06:00.180> that

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:01.180 
the edge is because when I did that that

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:03.560 
the edge is because when I did that that
Afghan<00:06:01.840> and<00:06:02.050> this<00:06:02.290> is<00:06:02.470> the<00:06:02.680> mitered<00:06:03.250> square

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:03.570 
Afghan and this is the mitered square

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:07.500 
Afghan and this is the mitered square
mock-up<00:06:04.570> of<00:06:04.720> it<00:06:04.900> then<00:06:05.470> I<00:06:05.740> would<00:06:06.190> pick<00:06:06.669> up<00:06:06.940> along

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:07.510 
mock-up of it then I would pick up along

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:10.590 
mock-up of it then I would pick up along
this<00:06:07.780> edge<00:06:08.080> so<00:06:08.560> that<00:06:09.160> when<00:06:09.669> I<00:06:09.700> worked<00:06:10.090> in<00:06:10.360> the

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:10.600 
this edge so that when I worked in the

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:13.950 
this edge so that when I worked in the
corner<00:06:11.200> yarn<00:06:12.040> I<00:06:12.430> worked<00:06:12.970> it<00:06:13.150> right<00:06:13.389> along<00:06:13.690> that

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:13.960 
corner yarn I worked it right along that

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:16.110 
corner yarn I worked it right along that
Ridge<00:06:14.380> so<00:06:15.040> it<00:06:15.100> gives<00:06:15.280> you<00:06:15.340> an<00:06:15.460> idea<00:06:15.610> it's<00:06:16.000> an

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:16.120 
Ridge so it gives you an idea it's an

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.300 
Ridge so it gives you an idea it's an
orientation<00:06:16.690> to<00:06:16.990> that<00:06:17.169> particular<00:06:17.500> project

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:18.310 
orientation to that particular project

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:20.580 
orientation to that particular project
but<00:06:18.490> you<00:06:18.669> can<00:06:18.940> work<00:06:19.120> it<00:06:19.300> anywhere<00:06:19.900> on<00:06:20.050> garter

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:20.590 
but you can work it anywhere on garter

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:24.300 
but you can work it anywhere on garter
stitch<00:06:21.660> so<00:06:22.660> there<00:06:22.960> you<00:06:23.139> have<00:06:23.169> it<00:06:23.410> a<00:06:23.770> way<00:06:24.250> to

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:24.310 
stitch so there you have it a way to

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:26.909 
stitch so there you have it a way to
work<00:06:24.669> in<00:06:24.940> those<00:06:25.120> garter<00:06:25.660> stitch<00:06:25.870> yarn<00:06:26.410> ends<00:06:26.770> in

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:26.919 
work in those garter stitch yarn ends in

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:29.670 
work in those garter stitch yarn ends in
a<00:06:27.370> way<00:06:27.550> that<00:06:27.790> they<00:06:27.940> are<00:06:27.970> barely<00:06:28.930> detectable

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:29.680 
a way that they are barely detectable

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.409 
a way that they are barely detectable
and<00:06:30.130> if<00:06:30.430> you're<00:06:30.580> interested<00:06:31.120> in<00:06:31.240> more
