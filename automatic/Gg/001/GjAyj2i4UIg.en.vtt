from this to this

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.180 
from this to this
so<00:02:31.060> how<00:02:31.210> bright<00:02:31.540> is<00:02:31.660> a<00:02:31.690> 50<00:02:32.170> watt<00:02:32.320> LED<00:02:32.770> anyway

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
so how bright is a 50 watt LED anyway

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.070 
so how bright is a 50 watt LED anyway
well<00:02:33.610> let's<00:02:33.790> find<00:02:34.000> out<00:02:34.120> before<00:02:34.300> the<00:02:34.570> Sun<00:02:34.810> comes
