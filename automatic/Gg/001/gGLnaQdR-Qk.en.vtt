would like to show you these these are a
couple<00:02:05.200> of<00:02:05.590> our<00:02:05.740> power<00:02:06.010> distribution<00:02:06.520> blocks

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:07.120 
couple of our power distribution blocks

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.770 
couple of our power distribution blocks
and<00:02:07.740> this<00:02:08.740> one<00:02:09.040> is<00:02:09.160> really<00:02:09.399> neat<00:02:09.700> because<00:02:09.940> you

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
and this one is really neat because you

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.240 
and this one is really neat because you
can<00:02:10.899> put<00:02:11.790> one<00:02:13.230> on<00:02:14.230> this<00:02:14.470> side<00:02:14.740> you<00:02:14.890> could<00:02:15.070> put

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
can put one on this side you could put

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.950 
can put one on this side you could put
one<00:02:15.690> wire<00:02:16.690> in<00:02:17.080> here<00:02:17.530> it's<00:02:18.460> got<00:02:18.670> to<00:02:18.730> be<00:02:18.850> a<00:02:18.960> bigger

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:19.960 
one wire in here it's got to be a bigger

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.830 
one wire in here it's got to be a bigger
gauge<00:02:20.290> and<00:02:20.740> then<00:02:21.100> turn<00:02:21.460> around<00:02:21.490> and<00:02:22.270> you<00:02:22.660> can

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
gauge and then turn around and you can

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.740 
gauge and then turn around and you can
have<00:02:23.020> four<00:02:23.880> accessories<00:02:24.880> coming<00:02:25.210> out<00:02:25.420> of<00:02:25.570> that

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
have four accessories coming out of that

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:32.400 
have four accessories coming out of that
one<00:02:25.990> wire<00:02:28.200> this<00:02:29.200> one<00:02:30.030> hooks<00:02:31.030> right<00:02:31.360> on<00:02:31.660> to<00:02:32.140> the

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
one wire this one hooks right on to the

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.510 
one wire this one hooks right on to the
battery<00:02:32.620> stud<00:02:33.370> itself<00:02:33.880> and<00:02:34.500> then<00:02:35.500> you<00:02:35.890> can

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
battery stud itself and then you can

huge<00:03:17.830> eyelet<00:03:18.370> on<00:03:18.430> this<00:03:18.610> thing<00:03:18.850> I<00:03:19.090> mean<00:03:19.120> you'd

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
huge eyelet on this thing I mean you'd

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.350 
huge eyelet on this thing I mean you'd
have<00:03:19.750> to<00:03:19.959> really<00:03:20.230> put<00:03:20.590> something<00:03:21.060> massive<00:03:22.060> oh

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 
have to really put something massive oh

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.780 
have to really put something massive oh
not<00:03:22.600> when<00:03:23.440> I<00:03:23.470> talk<00:03:23.769> to<00:03:23.920> customers<00:03:24.459> they

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
not when I talk to customers they

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.650 
not when I talk to customers they
usually<00:03:25.000> use<00:03:25.450> this<00:03:25.600> as<00:03:25.840> a<00:03:25.870> ground<00:03:26.260> this<00:03:27.220> one

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
usually use this as a ground this one

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.229 
usually use this as a ground this one
they<00:03:28.660> hook<00:03:28.870> the<00:03:29.050> positive<00:03:29.590> up<00:03:29.800> and<00:03:30.070> then<00:03:30.580> bring

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
they hook the positive up and then bring

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:35.040 
they hook the positive up and then bring
out<00:03:31.480> their<00:03:32.019> accessories<00:03:33.420> this<00:03:34.420> one<00:03:34.780> is<00:03:35.019> a

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
out their accessories this one is a

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:38.250 
out their accessories this one is a
pass-through<00:03:35.970> so<00:03:36.970> you<00:03:37.030> hook<00:03:37.300> up<00:03:37.480> on<00:03:37.750> one<00:03:37.989> side

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
pass-through so you hook up on one side

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.360 
pass-through so you hook up on one side
and<00:03:38.709> you<00:03:39.610> could<00:03:39.790> go<00:03:39.880> through<00:03:40.180> a<00:03:40.209> firewall<00:03:40.900> and

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
and you could go through a firewall and

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.610 
and you could go through a firewall and
then<00:03:42.370> it<00:03:42.519> hooks<00:03:42.670> up<00:03:42.820> on<00:03:43.000> the<00:03:43.120> other<00:03:43.209> side<00:03:43.530> so<00:03:44.530> it

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
then it hooks up on the other side so it

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.130 
then it hooks up on the other side so it
is<00:03:44.739> a<00:03:44.769> pass-through

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
is a pass-through

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.590 
is a pass-through
okay<00:03:47.140> I'm<00:03:47.260> gonna<00:03:47.350> put<00:03:47.590> these<00:03:47.709> to<00:03:47.920> the<00:03:47.950> side<00:03:48.600> now

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
okay I'm gonna put these to the side now

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.390 
okay I'm gonna put these to the side now

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:51.210 
Celsius Jarrell welding cable I really
like<00:04:48.220> the<00:04:48.430> welding<00:04:48.760> cable<00:04:49.210> it<00:04:49.540> is<00:04:49.780> so<00:04:50.380> flexible

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.220 
like the welding cable it is so flexible

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:56.040 
like the welding cable it is so flexible
so<00:04:51.640> easy<00:04:52.270> to<00:04:52.600> move<00:04:54.180> this<00:04:55.180> is<00:04:55.360> also<00:04:55.840> made<00:04:56.020> in
