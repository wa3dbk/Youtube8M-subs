00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 good kids and one for we are here in 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.069
 a new online gta 5 video today 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.810
 I bring the location of three new 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.790
 piles and well I appreciate that 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.980
 blowout of the eia that this is done 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.900
 a little hard to find them the truth 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.190
 that quite difficult and one then here 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.400
 we are going to have one to teach the 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.260
 Water is one location so 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.699
 let's get back in this part of the 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.650
 map as you see here where is the river 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.660
 Choluteca entrance inwards more 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.310
 or less for this position is as good as 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.630
 you see me more or less where is the 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.810
 line is that you do not see much in the 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.579
 video but as a line of change for 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.130
 water here, more or less, you will have it 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.809
 As you can see, it is a little more towards 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.829
 here good more or less I leave it there for 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.480
 look at me it has cost me 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.260
 quite find it but good for 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.210
 teach a signal that is very 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.890
 determinant in this aspect as we go 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.480
 to see right below we're going to have a 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.280
 boat side of some stones that this 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.170
 is going to be our signal that we are 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.760
 right here close and let's get 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.399
 well here a little behind the boat 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.190
 that is going to be where we are going to find 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:02.609
 our peyote that is where it is where 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.960
 it's down here you see one I'm going to 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.479
 start dying 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.310
 take peyote and let's save game 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.430
 here it is 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.310
 let's see what we have to do the truth 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:17.250
 is that I would be cool in plan I do not know dolphin and 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.070
 not something like that would be pretty cool and today we're going 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.380
 to see that we have to 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.990
 a hammerhead shark of this that I do not 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.930
 had played previously so very 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.770
 cool to see is a bit dark but 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:33.609
 good, pretty cool 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:37.479
 here you have the shark as it does not 

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:40.049
 see here I can I eat or something I have 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:40.049
 flutter 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:48.079
 haha cool that volume some weight something 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.079
 is super at night 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.990
 colossus with the shore not only the shore 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.990
 the poor man dies 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.090
 to see the truth is that it's going to be a 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.240
 shark or has been everything does not touch me 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.320
 neither a dolphin still quite by 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.830
 here a few times or that at night 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.830
 sleep 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.770
 Come on lady, nothing here, you have the 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.060
 shark as you know, I'll leave in the 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.560
 description the entire list of 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.080
 reproduction with all the above 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.540
 that we have found this would be 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.569
 peyote number 10 if I'm not wrong and 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.560
 now I'm going to teach 11 and 12 well 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.790
 that nothing because you have all the 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.770
 transformations and all to make 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.110
 reproduction in the description of the video 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.720
 and we go with the next one, let's go 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.630
 to take it out of the water to see how it dies and 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.490
 such 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.620
 let's go outside let's go outside I do not know if by 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:41.120
 here yes because it is something 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:42.260
 has taken the shark out of the water 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.580
 good nothing, now we see each other in the 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.709
 next but you good kids 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.390
 we are here in a new peyote and we are going 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.040
 to teach it as you see is willing and 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.530
 well basically we are here in the 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.180
 district stream and I'm going to teach 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.220
 the map exactly where we 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.940
 we find we are here lost in all 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:01.459
 the leader is on roads and just then 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.860
 next to the stream here in this 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:07.220
 position where I am is where is 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.569
 find what peyote is worth 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.510
 I think it's good because you have already 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:14.569
 see so let's go here you will find 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.950
 just above the hill he cited this and we're going 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:20.209
 to take it to see what we have to do 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.209
 let's eat peyote 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.610
 to see michael that I see you wanting to 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:26.080
 flip a little that you do not tell us 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.849
 here beside the water I do not know if it will touch me 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.740
 a dog I guess or something like that because 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:33.950
 marine animals alone within the sea 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:36.200
 a good puppy this I think I have not 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:39.010
 taught is still like black the truth 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.010
 that's pretty cool 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:45.470
 Yes, it's pretty cool and we're going to go up 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.540
 a little here for the mountain wall see 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.950
 to someone someone to bite him 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.960
 but it seems to me that here in the middle of the 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:54.320
 highway the truth is that look at the grass 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:57.120
 as it looks from handsome in play 4 the 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:59.790
 This is really amazing as you see 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:03.750
 although well practically like the 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:05.190
 reality and there's grass blanket and good 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.690
 Nothing here you have a new one 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.159
 Peyote's location and I'm looking forward 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.290
 know what happens already when we get it 

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:13.709
 all the truth, well, with this I think 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:16.250
 I've been going 11 and nothing for you so 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:18.870
 I'm going to teach the last one, let's go there 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.400
 many of us are here already in the last of 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.800
 the peyotes and well I'm going to 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.900
 teach the location we will be 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.669
 as you can see is in the creek was this 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.860
 the one above and well, there is here like 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:31.320
 a kind of crusade and crooked and this 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.789
 it's like a good mountain top not 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:36.090
 on top of everything but good is 

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:38.670
 as a small let's say a small 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:41.430
 top is not at the top of the whole but 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:44.820
 here you have it is just to the right of the 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:46.710
 road is worth as you see here we are going to 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:50.130
 find here this little peak like 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.540
 I say we have here the eastern viewpoint and 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:54.660
 just to the right of the lookout we're going to 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:56.880
 have this little flower that is a drug 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:59.640
 very powerful known as peyote which 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:02.210
 we already know so let's see what we 

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:04.009
 play this time 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:05.210
 I would like to see you touch me a bird 

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:07.420
 or something that I quite want to 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:09.249
 prove it 

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:11.859
 Let's see 

00:05:09.249 --> 00:05:13.929
 a puppy good a puppy different to 

00:05:11.859 --> 00:05:15.639
 see let's go here yes we have here in 

00:05:13.929 --> 00:05:21.030
 bite there are a lot of dog breeds 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:23.190
 different in agreement how 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:26.580

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:37.730
 where today it is cowardly to fight like a 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:37.730
