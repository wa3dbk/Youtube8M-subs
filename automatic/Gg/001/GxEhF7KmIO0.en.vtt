00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.830
 in the government of prosperous caguan if the power base was sustained so much the 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.700
 large as small landowners as well as towns, however, 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.230
 contradictions typical of the Porfirian system led this kind of 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.350
 social balance to its operational limit until it finally 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.380
 they broke another factor that put social stability at stake were the crises 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.670
 agricultural crops that were suddenly lived in tlaxcala during that 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.280
 agricultural production period was very difficult because of the fact that 

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.500
 part of the entity the little fertile land and the scarce water within the 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.700
 agricultural production only the pulque had an almost permanent rise due to 

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:39.739
 the all mine nature that the maguey keeps regarding the agricultural cycles 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:43.879
 of the other crops and that their development requires little water from there 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:47.480
 that the leading landowners could better withstand the repeated crises 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.460
 agricultural land compared to grain landowners and of course with 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.460
 the small owners 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.120
 for example this bad 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.530
 d 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.040
 and here the symantec disagreement of San Vicente to be heard 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.420
 more than 20 deep wells this way accumulates close 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.370
 because that helps us to 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:17.300
 for example to prevent erosion on the land no more excuses as we 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.690
 we keep fire 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:20.220
 Maintains humidity 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.090
 to cepeda 2 percent those two types of you is that we are sowing in the 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.080
 jail 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.590
 is the best prevents erosion on earth because because when I arrived 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:30.640
 too 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.240
 the water is carrying the parana 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.780
 and also knows a lot of wind 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.970
 also wind takes the Davis Cup 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:38.930
 for what it does 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.770
 in bay and that is form a kind of curtain and that is my little nor the water 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.370
 nor the Catalan left 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:49.470
 it is not supported by skin rash it is not very important to finish the 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.180
 for 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.180
 preserve the soil 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.119
 tasty white and why these studies 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.119
 own and the other ministers pointed out 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.500
 Athens was the first decade of the 20th century when the landowners 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.049
 they feel in danger 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:14.099
 the first evil though 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:17.560
 died manifests itself with the fall of days and a few days later with that of the 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.560
 prosperous governor caguan sic 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:28.120
 nevertheless towards 1900 11 thousand 912 the exercise of power of a revolutionary 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.050
 what is it that in hidalgo 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.810
 begins for example to the cremitas in the taxes on the production pulquera 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.170
 that somehow is going to lay a very bad placar to the landowners 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.250
 especially the ocean of pulque because it is the activity that is most 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.949
 buoyant in that sense in the colombes the folders 

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:46.839
 and to form a group of opposition to the government 

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:48.609
 percent in hidalgo 

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:52.849
 to leave margalida of the league of farmers was going to be a group of power 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:56.059
 that some way there has many of the government's proposals to 

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:59.530
 Antonio Hidalgo at the end of the day will have to be understood as a group of 

00:02:59.529 --> 00:03:03.209
 opposition in the political a pop group position in the economic 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.209
 and something also very important is that they are people who start arming their cafes and 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:07.799
 us 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:10.799
 because it is being foreseen in the national scenario 

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:15.459
 that things to alfresco madero is getting out of hand there 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:19.180
 revolts in morelos by the Zapatistas there are revolts in the north 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.699
 from en durango and chihuahua on the side of pascual orozco there is a revolt in 

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:27.150
 veracruz by frost Felix Díaz who has also rebelled against the 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.859
 Madero government 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:32.310
 This scenario is also perceived by the landowners that Tlaxcala 

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:36.469
 so that armed peasants by any for a possible regrowth 

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:40.319
 revolutionary neck had already lived it in the case of Juan Cuamatzin case 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:43.649
 of toledano sandoval and good is being prevented 

00:03:43.649 --> 00:03:48.319
 then the one that matters we already know how to finally derive 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:52.309
 overthrow a tree and that in the state is also going to reverberate because after the 

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:54.930
 rise of Victorian huerta the presidency of the republic 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.400
 new authorities will be appointed in tlaxcala 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.239
 Military military court 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:03.419
 kent will somehow begin to protect the interests of the landowners 

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:05.049
 but nevertheless 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:10.169
 these peasant groups that had seen certain expectations of improvement of 

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:13.179
 the condition of life through the revolution 

00:04:13.179 --> 00:04:17.239
 obviously they are also going to be directed towards the production centers for 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:21.459
 try to appropriate those disasters from these haciendas 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:24.770
 this is what is going to happen to somehow arm the economic chaos in 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.990
 waterfall 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.870
 because this james continuation 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.229
 here it serves us and in short God arranged that his 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:36.229
 come here to be threshold superior to moctezuma 

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:40.819
 won 

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:51.789
 Because of this, the civil war continued and San Bartolome de Montes 

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:55.659
 became a war barracks there was established sands Sunday 

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:59.589
 the haciendas that were once two great children and conviction in devastating 

00:04:59.589 --> 00:05:00.699
 battlefields 

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:03.699
 the earth and the magueyes without blood stains in 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.680
 the case of calpulalpan for example 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.009
 would have to talk here about the salinistas somehow d of these 

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:15.490
 these revolutionary groups that appropriated some haciendas 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.800
 and they put them to work finally the ones in optimum of a hacienda repercute 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:24.400
 directly on who is taking care of it is doing it is the case of the 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.660
 of the aguirristas that you know distributes land but that also 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.979
 worry about maintaining a production regime in the case of the east 

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:33.979
 of the state 

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:40.499
 the crop planters never imagined getting caught in a 

00:05:40.499 --> 00:05:42.479
 situation as dangerous as this 

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:46.379
 not only in tlaxcala but throughout the country had their vocation portishead 

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:50.759
 of his absolute rejection to the Maderismo of having sponsored the fight against 

00:05:50.759 --> 00:05:55.410
 Carranza the time of adjustments of accounts had arrived several estates of 

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:58.889
 the enemies of the constitutionalist revolution were intervened 

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:03.220
 the most important ones located in the district of ocampo for ignacio towers 

00:06:03.219 --> 00:06:07.349
 his participation in the side of the counterrevolution was disastrous 

00:06:07.349 --> 00:06:11.380
 had plagued too much rancor among the Constitutionalist ranks to 

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:15.419
 He forgave him for it, he decided not to go to Cuba and his hacienda San Bartolomé del 

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:18.419
 monte that was intervened by the local government 

00:06:23.589 --> 00:06:25.130
 vueling air 

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:27.229
 to your but almost none 

00:06:27.229 --> 00:06:30.229
 if it does not meet what is still weak 

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:39.440
 the constitutional article 27 that deals with the distribution of lands at the coup 

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:43.410
 end to the empires that appropriated so much land the only bad thing is that 

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:44.440
 with his defeat 

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:48.380
 and few continued the care that the planters used to devote the pulqui 

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:49.020
 finish 

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:53.020
 Thus begins the inevitable decline of the pointer as discrimination against 

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:58.360
 the drink continues now if they could call him home because of his city 

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.349
 of life of the vanquished 

00:07:00.349 --> 00:07:04.159
 anti-alcohol campaigns that discredited the ancestral life 

00:07:04.159 --> 00:07:07.679
 attacking them as a provocateur of all evil acquire much more strength 

00:07:10.059 --> 00:07:13.059
 between eight and a half in such a patient way 

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:16.680
 people never bothered to do a proper broadcast aimed 

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:24.409
 as an alternative the pulque was proposed to sell beer 

00:07:24.409 --> 00:07:29.099
 at that time he did not consider himself completely alcoholic since the 1920s 

00:07:29.099 --> 00:07:31.899
 in the city of beer was advertised as a family activity 

00:07:31.899 --> 00:07:34.899
 rigorously hygienic and modern 

00:07:36.939 --> 00:07:39.809
 the case after that for example thirty years ago 

00:07:39.809 --> 00:07:42.809
 it's start entesa 

00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:47.629
 I pretend to be a brewer 

00:07:49.249 --> 00:07:53.270
 of being fulfilled due to the wealth generated by the arid lands of the altiplano 

00:07:53.269 --> 00:07:53.910
 Mexican 

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:57.480
 and they forgot the thousands of people especially of the peasants who 

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:02.190
 they depended on that capital they decreed the funerals of an industry just when 

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:03.949
 it was in the process of modernization
