00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:10.010
 simple but very effective for muscles 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.010
 pelvic diaphragms 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:15.839
 the first exercise to lift imitated with 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.680
 shoulders and away from the ears central 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.859
 back position 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:24.390
 belly always tight always flat 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:27.510
 even when exhaling inhale raise my leg 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.660
 up to 90 degrees when exhaling faces and not 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.480
 to Jamaica if you can turn the legs in 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:37.260
 near you are no problem here in the composition 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.520
 can so take a breath rent bend in 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:46.739
 games sold by 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:48.660
 inhale inhale inhale inhale if you must 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.210
 be sure to know what zone t 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.190
 if you do not know what is needed you need 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.420
 you must visit larisa mana 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.719
 case my.com 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:02.250
 and see the secret zone etc. because 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:04.650
 This is very important so it briefly Jason 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.240
 when you activate engage muscles 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.780
 pelvic diaphragms 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.310
 uses the muscles of the pelvic diaphragm in 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.340
 you have to go to the toilet 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.950
 in a small way and stop doing it 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.979
 their body and then these muscles are just 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.470
 involved then these here 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.200
 hinged muscles after that pull off 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.580
 lower abdomen 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.580
 let me closer to the floor and 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:38.850
 in the next exercise slip foot 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.009
 this time we will add another hand stretch 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.040
 arm and ceiling 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:46.799
 when inhaling means one foot slides 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:50.570
 and straightened leg and same hands time 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:55.079
 go on for head that is above head and 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.880
 then exhale options center and again 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:01.320
 inhale 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:03.600
 glide and exhale back when your hands go 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:07.129
 who should you activate 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.489
 draw back muscles and muscles here under 

00:02:07.129 --> 00:02:09.690
 armpits 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.310
 just too 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:16.410
 not very important that you had a beautiful 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:18.390
 posture and abdomen is always flat if 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:22.200
 rowing you can slide 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:27.260
 two feet right away let's try 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:30.060
 inhale and when we breathe in let's say back 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:33.330
 the most important thing here is to position in 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.700
 life you have always been neutral and if 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.070
 you can't hold positions there 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:42.320
 go again 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:45.390
 slip that way you are good with you 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:47.730
 next exercise up two options 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.610
 more difficult option when legs in 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:53.340
 table top that is 90 degrees from the ticket 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:56.340
 90 degrees from colleagues either 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:59.430
 legs and feet on the floor jalla show 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:03.180
 more difficult when inhale you open 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:06.030
 knees both knees and when you breathe 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.130
 shut them out necessarily gold 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.070
 should work that is if you put 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.900
 here are two fingers here inside water 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:16.580
 a piece here so here we are what you should 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.580
 feel that they are tense up 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:20.970
 cut carols 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:23.700
 middle finger should always be think 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.680
 was in the same position as a knee with no 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.440
 drive your legs like this 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.239
 or knees on board you need to run 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.640
 necessarily at the same distance as 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:36.380
 here is the tape tickets in the same 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:40.860
 as if speed moves gain finger 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:44.810
 one more time if you find it difficult you 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:46.500
 put your feet up on 1 would sit the same 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.440
 only on the floor 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:56.600
 that is, his pregnant legs should be 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:56.600
 necessarily gender and so 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:03.360
 so the next exercise is one leg 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:06.970
 put the scene and the other leg goes down 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:09.190
 again, be sure to speed 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.980
 knees should be equal to speed here 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:15.480
 middle mentos finger and law need 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.480
 enter the same pace 

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:23.830
 if it is too difficult or if you 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:26.229
 pregnant put your feet on the floor do 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:29.770
 same thing only on the floor 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:37.300
 it's important anyway . diaphragm muscles 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:39.580
 pelvis work very well here and again 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:42.400
 same it is not a stretch yes that is, you do not 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:44.200
 you let go of your knees there do not throw 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.979
 in the name you need to control this movement 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.680
 before 

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:51.450
 which feels feel you 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.450
 here the muscles must have worked 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:57.970
 well and and the fifth exercise is hands 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.880
 by foot 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.419
 one leg stays in the center the other leg 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.610
 up 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:06.550
 turn him like a ballerina again if 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:10.510
 you can inhale when you exhale let go 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:17.080
 leg and inhale when Kru Devil and 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:20.200
 lift your leg up and exhale down inhale 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:22.180
 up that is not necessarily such 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:24.099
 big circles do and smaller thing 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:26.200
 the main thing is that the legs are machines here 

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:28.570
 she remained in the center yes not 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:31.090
 moved and here you too 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:40.150
 the pelvis should always be neutral 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:44.710
 positions will put out exhale and inhale now 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:46.990
 change legs legs straighten and again 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:50.830
 if you can you will return us as a ballerina 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:56.400
 inhale t-zone when inhale 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:06:01.540
 we lead the i doch back again 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:03.340
 will run out long back and if you 

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:05.860
 uncomfortable you can always bend a little but 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:06.580
 But check it very often 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:09.100
 many 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:11.380
 I see that my knees are bent 

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:13.810
 I go up straightening at all can 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:15.670
 straighten this leg necessarily if 

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:18.960
 can straighten the leg should board 

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:24.480
 be straight exhale down 

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:24.480
 current up and exhale down again 

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:35.980
 last time exhale down and long hair 

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:39.280
 and big circles and you sort of lower back 

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:41.070
 there is a circle but here again draw a circle 

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:47.020
 which you have on your lower back 

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:49.060
 on mother and here everything can do it 

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:51.730
 every day if you want 

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:54.880
 simple pretty exercises very 

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:55.270
 very effective for muscle for format 

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:57.310
 behind 

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:59.070
