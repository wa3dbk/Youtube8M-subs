00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:06.890 
done videos that I talked about this

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:09.640 
done videos that I talked about this
before<00:04:07.280> but<00:04:07.519> this<00:04:08.030> one<00:04:08.269> is<00:04:08.420> more<00:04:08.630> on<00:04:08.810> a<00:04:08.840> say

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
before but this one is more on a say

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.100 
before but this one is more on a say
that<00:04:09.680> something<00:04:10.519> goes<00:04:11.390> wrong<00:04:11.720> in<00:04:11.959> your<00:04:12.050> life

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:12.110 
that something goes wrong in your life

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:15.100 
that something goes wrong in your life
and<00:04:12.650> it's<00:04:13.040> not<00:04:13.280> a<00:04:13.580> perfect<00:04:13.940> scenario<00:04:14.450> anymore

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.110 
and it's not a perfect scenario anymore

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:16.659 
and it's not a perfect scenario anymore
or<00:04:15.260> maybe<00:04:15.410> it<00:04:15.560> never<00:04:15.709> was<00:04:15.920> a<00:04:15.950> perfect<00:04:16.400> scenario

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:16.669 
or maybe it never was a perfect scenario

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:21.520 
or maybe it never was a perfect scenario
that<00:04:17.480> is<00:04:17.720> not<00:04:17.959> a<00:04:19.269> reason<00:04:20.269> to<00:04:20.570> think<00:04:21.320> like

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
that is not a reason to think like

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:22.779 
that is not a reason to think like
there's<00:04:21.739> no<00:04:21.979> way<00:04:22.130> I<00:04:22.160> can<00:04:22.310> make<00:04:22.550> something

00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:22.789 
there's no way I can make something

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:25.360 
there's no way I can make something
happen<00:04:22.940> because<00:04:23.680> you<00:04:24.680> can<00:04:24.860> still<00:04:25.130> go<00:04:25.340> out

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
happen because you can still go out

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.430 
happen because you can still go out
there<00:04:25.520> and<00:04:26.000> do<00:04:26.150> it<00:04:26.180> if<00:04:26.479> you<00:04:26.660> really<00:04:27.020> really<00:04:27.169> put

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
there and do it if you really really put

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.800 
there and do it if you really really put
your

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810
