00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.200 
six team in Canada and you know the one
that<00:00:37.800> obviously<00:00:38.010> is<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.550> preeminent<00:00:38.760> team

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
that obviously is the preeminent team

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.720 
that obviously is the preeminent team
yeah<00:00:39.600> I<00:00:39.629> think<00:00:40.379> it<00:00:40.500> did<00:00:40.680> it'sit's<00:00:41.489> interesting

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
yeah I think it did it'sit's interesting

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.119 
yeah I think it did it'sit's interesting
point<00:00:42.239> because<00:00:42.329> as<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:43.050> process<00:00:43.620> went<00:00:43.860> as<00:00:44.010> I

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
point because as the process went as I

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.310 
point because as the process went as I
tried<00:00:44.309> to<00:00:44.399> figure<00:00:44.579> out<00:00:44.730> where<00:00:44.879> I<00:00:44.910> might<00:00:45.210> end<00:00:46.140> up

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
tried to figure out where I might end up

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.279 
tried to figure out where I might end up
playing<00:00:46.590> I<00:00:46.860> think<00:00:47.610> that<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:48.660> Montreal<00:00:49.020> canes

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
playing I think that the Montreal canes

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.069 
playing I think that the Montreal canes
and<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:49.860> what<00:00:50.700> that<00:00:50.879> organization<00:00:51.000> means<00:00:51.750> to

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
and the what that organization means to

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.439 
and the what that organization means to
the<00:00:52.559> people<00:00:52.710> of<00:00:52.949> not<00:00:53.160> only<00:00:53.280> go<00:00:53.969> back<00:00:54.149> but<00:00:54.360> the

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
the people of not only go back but the

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:55.880 
the people of not only go back but the
people<00:00:54.719> of<00:00:54.809> Canada<00:00:55.050> in<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.320> hockey<00:00:55.500> world<00:00:55.649> in

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
people of Canada in the hockey world in

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.680 
people of Canada in the hockey world in
general<00:00:56.070> I<00:00:56.399> think<00:00:56.730> that<00:00:56.969> really<00:00:57.120> identified

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
general I think that really identified

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.900 
general I think that really identified
within<00:00:57.899> I<00:00:58.620> think<00:00:59.160> you<00:00:59.219> probably<00:00:59.340> played<00:00:59.579> into

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
within I think you probably played into

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.430 
within I think you probably played into
my<00:01:00.000> decision<00:01:00.390> making<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.629> lot<00:01:00.809> maybe<00:01:00.989> even<00:01:01.260> more

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
my decision making a lot maybe even more

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.869 
my decision making a lot maybe even more
on<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.590> subconscious<00:01:02.160> than<00:01:02.309> i<00:01:02.399> did<00:01:02.730> not<00:01:02.820> even

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
on the subconscious than i did not even

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.329 
on the subconscious than i did not even
realize<00:01:03.120> but<00:01:03.899> there<00:01:04.350> obviously<00:01:04.559> are<00:01:04.890> some

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
realize but there obviously are some

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.500 
realize but there obviously are some
built-in<00:01:05.670> pressures<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.180> playing<00:01:06.390> in

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
built-in pressures to playing in

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.960 
built-in pressures to playing in
montreal<00:01:06.990> we<00:01:07.650> all<00:01:07.740> know<00:01:07.979> that<00:01:08.010> it'sit's<00:01:08.490> it

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
montreal we all know that it'sit's it

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.580 
montreal we all know that it'sit's it
can<00:01:09.150> be<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.270> great<00:01:09.540> place<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:09.960> play<00:01:10.049> it<00:01:10.260> can<00:01:10.409> be<00:01:10.560> a

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
can be a great place to play it can be a

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.530 
can be a great place to play it can be a
very<00:01:11.010> very<00:01:11.610> difficult<00:01:11.760> place<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.240> play

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
very very difficult place to play

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.590 
very very difficult place to play
sometimes<00:01:13.189> i'm<00:01:14.189> assuming<00:01:14.760> that<00:01:15.060> you<00:01:15.180> took

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
sometimes i'm assuming that you took

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.480 
sometimes i'm assuming that you took
that<00:01:15.659> into<00:01:15.930> account<00:01:16.049> your<00:01:16.320> decision<00:01:16.920> but<00:01:17.100> I

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
that into account your decision but I

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.910 
that into account your decision but I
also<00:01:18.150> would<00:01:18.630> assume<00:01:18.869> that<00:01:19.020> you<00:01:19.140> know<00:01:19.439> you<00:01:19.650> have

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
also would assume that you know you have

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.789 
also would assume that you know you have
the<00:01:19.950> mental<00:01:20.400> makeup<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.810> fortitude<00:01:22.590> to

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
the mental makeup and the fortitude to

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.800 
the mental makeup and the fortitude to
be<00:01:23.040> able<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:23.460> weather<00:01:24.060> through<00:01:24.390> those<00:01:24.509> sorts

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
be able to weather through those sorts

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.420 
be able to weather through those sorts
of<00:01:24.869> things<00:01:24.930> well<00:01:25.530> yeah<00:01:25.710> I<00:01:25.740> mean<00:01:25.920> I<00:01:26.130> would

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
of things well yeah I mean I would

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.450 
of things well yeah I mean I would
expect<00:01:26.759> that<00:01:26.880> I<00:01:27.210> will<00:01:27.270> and<00:01:27.659> I<00:01:27.720> think<00:01:28.290> that<00:01:28.500> my

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
expect that I will and I think that my

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.789 
expect that I will and I think that my
luck<00:01:29.670> my<00:01:29.820> outlook<00:01:30.090> on<00:01:30.210> it<00:01:30.390> is<00:01:30.509> is<00:01:30.780> I<00:01:30.810> understand

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
luck my outlook on it is is I understand

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.380 
luck my outlook on it is is I understand
that<00:01:31.950> there<00:01:32.100> is<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:32.250> certain<00:01:32.610> level<00:01:32.790> of<00:01:32.970> if<00:01:33.299> you

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
that there is a certain level of if you

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.760 
that there is a certain level of if you
want<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.600> call<00:01:33.689> it<00:01:33.750> scrutiny<00:01:34.200> or<00:01:34.290> pressure<00:01:34.560> or

want to call it scrutiny or pressure or
whatever<00:01:35.009> it<00:01:35.130> may<00:01:35.280> be<00:01:35.310> that<00:01:35.460> comes<00:01:35.759> with<00:01:35.909> play

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
whatever it may be that comes with play

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.880 
whatever it may be that comes with play
with<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.240> Canadians<00:01:36.689> but<00:01:36.900> i'll<00:01:37.409> try<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:37.799> take

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
with the Canadians but i'll try and take

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.440 
with the Canadians but i'll try and take
the<00:01:38.009> positive<00:01:38.400> spin<00:01:38.579> on<00:01:38.610> it<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:38.939> i'll<00:01:39.090> try<00:01:39.329> and

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
the positive spin on it and i'll try and

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.840 
the positive spin on it and i'll try and
say<00:01:39.630> that<00:01:39.869> you<00:01:40.650> can<00:01:40.829> you<00:01:41.009> can<00:01:41.189> use<00:01:41.369> that<00:01:41.610> to

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
say that you can you can use that to

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
that that old it'll be a positive

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.609 
that that old it'll be a positive

what<00:02:33.410> what<00:02:33.590> the<00:02:33.710> identity<00:02:34.160> actually<00:02:34.520> is<00:02:34.670> i

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
what what the identity actually is i

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.550 
what what the identity actually is i
mean<00:02:34.970> i<00:02:35.000> really<00:02:35.300> like<00:02:35.600> the<00:02:35.930> team<00:02:36.140> that<00:02:36.350> the

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
mean i really like the team that the

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.950 
mean i really like the team that the
bobs<00:02:37.040> put<00:02:37.280> together<00:02:37.460> i<00:02:37.670> really<00:02:38.000> like<00:02:38.180> the<00:02:38.420> the

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:38.960

bobs put together i really like the the
lineup<00:02:39.380> and<00:02:39.560> and<00:02:40.070> and<00:02:40.370> i<00:02:40.760> guess<00:02:41.000> the<00:02:41.030> chemistry

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
lineup and and and i guess the chemistry

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:42.910 
lineup and and and i guess the chemistry
and<00:02:41.690> what<00:02:41.840> we<00:02:41.960> what<00:02:42.230> we<00:02:42.260> create<00:02:42.710> is<00:02:42.800> our

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
and what we what we create is our

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.800 
and what we what we create is our
identity<00:02:43.010> or<00:02:43.460> we'll<00:02:43.910> have<00:02:44.030> to<00:02:44.090> present<00:02:44.360> itself

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
identity or we'll have to present itself

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.050 
identity or we'll have to present itself
as<00:02:45.020> time<00:02:45.260> goes<00:02:45.470> on<00:02:45.620> but<00:02:45.890> you<00:02:46.880> know<00:02:46.970> i<00:02:47.000> think

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
as time goes on but you know i think

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.340 
as time goes on but you know i think
we're<00:02:47.300> going<00:02:47.330> to<00:02:47.480> be<00:02:47.570> team<00:02:47.810> that<00:02:48.050> you<00:02:48.260> know

we're going to be team that you know

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.170 
we're going to be team that you know
upfront<00:02:48.770> seems<00:02:49.430> to<00:02:49.610> be<00:02:49.700> a<00:02:49.730> team<00:02:49.940> that<00:02:50.060> we're

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
upfront seems to be a team that we're

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.640 
upfront seems to be a team that we're
going<00:02:50.270> to<00:02:50.330> make<00:02:50.450> plays<00:02:50.720> and<00:02:50.780> control<00:02:51.380> the<00:02:51.470> puck

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
going to make plays and control the puck

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.100 
going to make plays and control the puck
and<00:02:51.890> and<00:02:52.100> skate<00:02:52.700> and<00:02:52.940> and<00:02:53.270> are<00:02:53.600> actually<00:02:53.960> right

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
and and skate and and are actually right

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:55.300 
and and skate and and are actually right
through<00:02:54.260> our<00:02:54.290> d<00:02:54.530> and<00:02:54.770> right<00:02:54.980> through<00:02:55.160> our<00:02:55.190> I

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
through our d and right through our I

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:56.950 
through our d and right through our I
mean<00:02:55.580> our<00:02:55.670> whole<00:02:55.820> lineup<00:02:56.060> seems<00:02:56.450> that<00:02:56.630> way<00:02:56.780> and

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:56.960 
mean our whole lineup seems that way and

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.020 
mean our whole lineup seems that way and
and<00:02:57.350> and<00:02:57.740> I<00:02:57.830> think<00:02:58.250> for<00:02:58.340> us<00:02:58.460> to<00:02:58.580> win<00:02:58.730> I<00:02:58.790> think

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
and and I think for us to win I think

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.890 
and and I think for us to win I think
we're<00:02:59.120> all<00:02:59.210> going<00:02:59.360> to<00:02:59.420> know<00:02:59.510> that<00:02:59.660> we<00:02:59.720> have<00:02:59.840> to

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
we're all going to know that we have to

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.540 
we're all going to know that we have to
be<00:02:59.990> a<00:03:00.020> real<00:03:00.230> strong<00:03:00.500> structure<00:03:01.040> defensive

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
be a real strong structure defensive

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.660 
be a real strong structure defensive
team<00:03:01.760> so<00:03:02.480> it's<00:03:03.260> kind<00:03:03.470> of<00:03:03.500> the<00:03:03.650> the<00:03:03.890> formula<00:03:04.280> we

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
team so it's kind of the the formula we

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.900 
team so it's kind of the the formula we
I<00:03:04.880> guess<00:03:05.060> right<00:03:05.240> now<00:03:05.300> we<00:03:05.450> can<00:03:05.660> pick<00:03:05.780> the<00:03:05.900> ideal

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910

be and aspire to it and that would be

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.280 
be and aspire to it and that would be
probably<00:03:10.640> a<00:03:10.790> team<00:03:10.940> that<00:03:11.840> would<00:03:11.930> play<00:03:12.080> a<00:03:12.110> real

you know and that's something that I
think<00:05:16.060> is<00:05:16.300> very<00:05:16.360> important<00:05:17.020> if<00:05:17.110> you<00:05:17.200> look<00:05:17.350> at

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:17.440 
think is very important if you look at

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:18.570 
think is very important if you look at
the<00:05:17.470> personalities<00:05:18.160> that<00:05:18.190> we've<00:05:18.430> put

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:18.580 
the personalities that we've put

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.610

just thought of it and you know at the

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:36.510 
just thought of it and you know at the
same<00:05:34.960> time<00:05:35.200> I<00:05:35.260> you<00:05:35.470> know<00:05:35.620> it<00:05:35.830> hockey<00:05:36.160> is<00:05:36.400> the

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:08.070 
talked about that little earlier I think
that<00:06:05.260> that<00:06:05.710> was<00:06:06.670> another<00:06:06.940> reason<00:06:07.270> why<00:06:07.780> it<00:06:07.840> was

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:08.080 
that that was another reason why it was

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.090 
that that was another reason why it was
so<00:06:08.200> attractive<00:06:08.650> the<00:06:08.740> Montreal<00:06:09.070> Canadiens

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:09.100 
so attractive the Montreal Canadiens

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:11.070 
so attractive the Montreal Canadiens
because<00:06:09.670> I<00:06:09.850> know<00:06:10.180> how<00:06:10.390> important<00:06:10.840> it<00:06:10.930> is<00:06:10.990> to

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:11.080 
because I know how important it is to

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.470 
because I know how important it is to
have<00:06:11.400> top<00:06:12.400> puck-moving<00:06:12.790> power<00:06:13.270> play

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:13.480 
have top puck-moving power play

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.300 
have top puck-moving power play
defenseman<00:06:13.960> and<00:06:14.170> and<00:06:14.350> those<00:06:14.770> three<00:06:15.010> guys<00:06:15.100> we

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:15.310 
defenseman and and those three guys we

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:17.100 
defenseman and and those three guys we
have<00:06:15.430> Montreal<00:06:15.880> are<00:06:16.030> second<00:06:16.600> to<00:06:16.630> none<00:06:16.690> so

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:17.110 
have Montreal are second to none so

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:18.660 
have Montreal are second to none so
that's<00:06:17.650> really<00:06:17.800> exciting<00:06:18.130> I<00:06:18.340> think<00:06:18.490> that'll

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:18.670 
that's really exciting I think that'll

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:20.220 
that's really exciting I think that'll
be<00:06:18.700> great<00:06:18.850> for<00:06:19.030> the<00:06:19.090> power<00:06:19.270> play<00:06:19.570> I<00:06:19.840> think<00:06:20.170> the

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:20.230 
be great for the power play I think the

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:21.630 
be great for the power play I think the
power<00:06:20.440> plays<00:06:20.650> a<00:06:20.740> very<00:06:20.890> important<00:06:21.340> thing<00:06:21.490> that

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:21.640 
power plays a very important thing that

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.730 
power plays a very important thing that
I<00:06:21.700> take<00:06:21.880> a<00:06:21.910> lot<00:06:22.060> of<00:06:22.120> pride<00:06:22.390> in<00:06:22.420> myself<00:06:22.740> being
