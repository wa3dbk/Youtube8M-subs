from the pizzoli company in Italy the
pizon<00:02:27.020> e<00:02:27.050> resonators<00:02:27.860> are<00:02:28.130> installed<00:02:28.640> with

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
pizon e resonators are installed with

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
the resonator and don't protrude through

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.130 
the resonator and don't protrude through
so<00:02:33.980> you<00:02:34.040> have<00:02:34.310> an<00:02:34.430> absolutely<00:02:34.850> smooth<00:02:35.660> service

okay<00:02:38.150> then<00:02:38.390> we'll<00:02:38.480> go<00:02:38.630> to<00:02:38.660> number<00:02:38.990> two<00:02:39.140> what

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
okay then we'll go to number two what

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.260 
okay then we'll go to number two what

strong very rich the bigger resonators

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.960 
strong very rich the bigger resonators
give<00:03:56.200> it<00:03:56.290> a<00:03:56.350> little<00:03:56.500> more<00:03:56.709> bite<00:03:57.010> and<00:03:57.370> of<00:03:57.730> course
