00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:09.650 

we<00:00:08.130> take<00:00:08.309> an<00:00:08.429> image<00:00:08.580> which<00:00:09.090> was<00:00:09.240> exactly

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
we take an image which was exactly

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.930 
we take an image which was exactly
planned<00:00:10.019> 50<00:00:10.469> seconds<00:00:10.950> after<00:00:11.309> the<00:00:11.400> release<00:00:11.700> and

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
planned 50 seconds after the release and

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.289 
planned 50 seconds after the release and
it<00:00:12.330> worked<00:00:12.599> perfectly<00:00:13.170> well<00:00:13.820> and<00:00:14.820> we<00:00:15.030> take<00:00:15.179> an

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
it worked perfectly well and we take an

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.029 
it worked perfectly well and we take an
image<00:00:15.420> that<00:00:15.780> just<00:00:15.809> arrived<00:00:16.440> here<00:00:16.710> so<00:00:16.920> it's

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
image that just arrived here so it's

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.279 
image that just arrived here so it's
really<00:00:17.250> not<00:00:17.430> process<00:00:18.000> it's<00:00:18.210> really<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.630> as<00:00:18.869> it

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
really not process it's really the as it

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.410 
really not process it's really the as it
is<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:20.189> primary<00:00:20.550> that<00:00:20.640> we<00:00:20.789> are<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:20.939> Sun<00:00:21.180> in<00:00:21.359> a

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
is the primary that we are the Sun in a

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.240 
is the primary that we are the Sun in a
window<00:00:21.750> if<00:00:21.960> I<00:00:22.080> can<00:00:22.199> say<00:00:22.410> so<00:00:22.470> so<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.010> Sun<00:00:23.220> is

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
window if I can say so so the Sun is

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.830 
window if I can say so so the Sun is
eliminating<00:00:23.910> everything<00:00:24.150> here<00:00:24.449> so<00:00:24.600> we<00:00:24.689> have<00:00:24.779> a

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
eliminating everything here so we have a

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.450 
eliminating everything here so we have a
lot<00:00:24.960> of<00:00:24.990> scattered<00:00:25.500> life<00:00:25.680> which<00:00:26.189> is<00:00:26.310> not

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
lot of scattered life which is not

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.220 
lot of scattered life which is not
important<00:00:26.849> to<00:00:27.000> demonstrate<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.689> quality<00:00:28.140> of

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
important to demonstrate the quality of

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.069 
important to demonstrate the quality of
the<00:00:28.349> image<00:00:28.529> and<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.740> dynamics<00:00:29.160> of<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.340> image

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:37.160 

so<00:00:34.079> we<00:00:34.230> have<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.710> first<00:00:35.460> images<00:00:36.090> taken<00:00:36.719> by<00:00:36.930> the

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
so we have the first images taken by the

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.030 
so we have the first images taken by the
orbiter<00:00:37.770> bio<00:00:37.980> series<00:00:38.489> coming<00:00:39.239> down<00:00:39.420> straight

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040 
orbiter bio series coming down straight

00:00:40.040 --> 00:01:16.160 
orbiter bio series coming down straight
these<00:00:41.040> minutes

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.480 

we<00:01:17.170> definitely<00:01:17.380> confirmed<00:01:17.950> that<00:01:18.130> the<00:01:18.219> lander

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
we definitely confirmed that the lander

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.010 
we definitely confirmed that the lander
is<00:01:18.520> on<00:01:18.729> the<00:01:18.850> surface<00:01:19.299> and<00:01:19.539> I'll<00:01:19.630> leave<00:01:19.780> it<00:01:19.869> to

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
is on the surface and I'll leave it to

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.990 
is on the surface and I'll leave it to
sniffing<00:01:20.409> I<00:01:20.469> think<00:01:20.500> it's<00:01:20.829> up<00:01:20.979> to<00:01:21.009> him<00:01:21.340> to<00:01:21.369> judge

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
sniffing I think it's up to him to judge

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.080 
sniffing I think it's up to him to judge
I<00:01:22.030> was<00:01:22.329> going<00:01:22.630> now<00:01:22.780> on<00:01:22.930> the<00:01:23.049> lander<00:01:23.399> okay<00:01:24.399> so<00:01:24.880> we

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
I was going now on the lander okay so we

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.380 
I was going now on the lander okay so we
are<00:01:25.180> there<00:01:25.390> and<00:01:25.659> Sheila<00:01:26.229> is<00:01:26.350> talking<00:01:26.920> to<00:01:27.070> us

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
are there and Sheila is talking to us

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.149 
are there and Sheila is talking to us
first<00:01:28.390> things<00:01:28.689> he<00:01:29.229> told<00:01:29.439> us<00:01:29.679> was<00:01:29.860> that<00:01:30.009> the

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:30.159 
first things he told us was that the

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:32.940 
first things he told us was that the
harpoons<00:01:30.520> have<00:01:30.759> been<00:01:30.970> fired<00:01:31.270> rebound<00:01:31.869> and<00:01:32.170> the

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
harpoons have been fired rebound and the

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.179 
harpoons have been fired rebound and the
landing<00:01:33.700> gear<00:01:33.759> has<00:01:34.659> been<00:01:34.960> moved<00:01:35.229> inside<00:01:35.530> so<00:01:36.069> we

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:36.189 
landing gear has been moved inside so we

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:38.429 
landing gear has been moved inside so we
are<00:01:36.340> sitting<00:01:36.759> on<00:01:36.880> the<00:01:37.000> surface<00:01:37.509> Fila<00:01:38.380> is

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:38.439 
are sitting on the surface Fila is

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:41.159 
are sitting on the surface Fila is
talking<00:01:38.860> to<00:01:39.039> us
