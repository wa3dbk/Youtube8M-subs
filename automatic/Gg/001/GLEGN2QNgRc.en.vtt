when<00:02:12.150> I<00:02:12.180> was<00:02:12.360> chasing<00:02:12.569> Darvish<00:02:13.110> so

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
when I was chasing Darvish so

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.410 
when I was chasing Darvish so
that<00:02:14.490> was<00:02:14.610> a<00:02:14.640> pretty<00:02:14.880> rough<00:02:15.720> day<00:02:15.750> I<00:02:17.420> didn't

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
that was a pretty rough day I didn't

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:19.880 
that was a pretty rough day I didn't
think<00:02:18.510> it<00:02:18.660> was<00:02:18.720> going<00:02:18.900> to<00:02:18.960> get<00:02:19.080> much<00:02:19.320> better<00:02:19.590> I

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
think it was going to get much better I

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.410 
think it was going to get much better I
thought<00:02:20.400> maybe<00:02:20.580> the<00:02:20.730> trip<00:02:20.910> would<00:02:21.000> be<00:02:21.060> a<00:02:21.150> bust

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
thought maybe the trip would be a bust

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.800 
thought maybe the trip would be a bust
but<00:02:21.830> that<00:02:22.830> day<00:02:23.040> and<00:02:23.370> when<00:02:24.060> I<00:02:24.120> was<00:02:24.240> at<00:02:24.330> Texas<00:02:24.720> I
