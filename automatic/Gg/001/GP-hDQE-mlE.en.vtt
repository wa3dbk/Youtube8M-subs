 photo manager 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:10.730
 is a young company born in 2009 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:14.640
 under the impulse of the president of Naples c. 

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.060
 tresor marco italo gusto 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.859
 dear friend e 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:21.929
 passionate bear scholar 

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:24.460
 together 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.849
 to the help of 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.390
 professor maria luisa brandi 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.700
 real muse of this society 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.010
 which in my opinion stands as the society of the two 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.560
 allow this joke in this period when a lot of talk is made 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.750
 of the hero of the two worlds of the unity of Italy 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.670
 in fact this society at all half between two worlds the world of knowing the 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.060
 the world of doing 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.270
 the world of knowing brings together so many scholars 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.720
 in the bone tissue 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.000
 scholars 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.410
 I am a field materialist in the world of being that brings together the finish 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:08.780
 endocrinologist internists surgeons most people like me who are 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.490
 orthopedic surgeon 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.330
 to tighten screws 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.030
 and sometimes to fix fractures when all is well 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.860
 but 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.330
 the society 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.320
 just for this commission farm two such different worlds 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.979
 anime 'cause i wanna die has a very broad board that is composed of 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.130
 20 people coming from professionalism 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.189
 extremely different cultural experiences 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.950
 but 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.280
 treated like I can young people 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.460
 young people are actually the lifeblood of this society of ours 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:51.760
 why 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.970
 they are the ones who will carry forward everything we want to grow 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:02.030
 although we have dedicated masters on bone tissue they are very popular with 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.130
 passionate people 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.829
 people who will have to become new professionals 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.020
 and that they will have to develop a new culture in the treatment of pathologies 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.020
 of bone tissue 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.259
 good 

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:22.299
 let's account that 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:26.729
 let's have a good night one of the most ambitious but we're actually getting ready 

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:29.069
 on my 100th birthday 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:36.030
 because the statistics tell us that in 2050 2 in Italy we will have 30% more than 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.479
 30% of the population over 80 

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:42.479
 and we orthopedists will operate almost only femoral fractures 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:45.769
 and prostheses in the elderly 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:49.919
 therefore absolutely necessary pools a 

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:52.349
 affect this trend 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:56.140
 both by reducing the number of older people 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.829
 but the number of structures will develop 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:04.009
 and the speed of healing of these fortunes and misfortunes and also the quality 

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:06.459
 of healing itself 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:07.389
 of course 

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:11.929
 I realize that these are very ambitious goals 

00:03:11.929 --> 00:03:14.099
 dead med actually 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:18.969
 you can proudly boast that you were one of the first companies in the world 

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:21.699
 to have understood 

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:26.209
 it is important to combine different cultural skills 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:29.199
 to work together 

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:33.119
 for a common goal that will be to have better prevention 

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:36.149
 the best treatment 

00:03:36.149 --> 00:03:39.159
 in our facilities when we will be holm oaks 

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:41.689
 we will put all our efforts into it 

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:45.760
 it is surely we will be able to find people as passionate as we are 

00:03:49.649 --> 00:03:49.809
