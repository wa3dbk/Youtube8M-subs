00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:04.110
 if it is a European car brand with a history in the field of 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.920
 motorsport then it's Porsche 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:11.040
 yet it was not for yourself in the first race versions of their parents 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.160
 but note that a dealer can get a ruling on sir 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.390
 he wanted no more than six cars, but the last one was a coupé 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.260
 was meant for the media and the hatch rome the hatches reilly 

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:27.489
 he is behind that car 

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:29.970
 the club color porsche coupé 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.890
 the poor's did experiment with boosting engines on time 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.160
 but most of them were prototypes 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.160
 and they have all been lost over time 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.630
 the all to pieces remote that is still known that has number 16 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.370
 and let that just be delivered to the one mister clubs working in frankfort 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.320
 and thus you end up in this car 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.400
 thus this is also actually a relaxed first porsche atmosphere 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.150
 shortly after that late rally sounds that this car was driving 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.940
 with those sold and an American 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.360
 but that man that is not really lucky to be too careful 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.180
 because he crashed the employee could still be there 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.430
 are children 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.860
 found dead behind the wheel after fourteen days 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.120
 and the club records ten didn't exactly help either 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.580
 that car was pulled out of the water and ended up there 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.770
 at a scrap yard in California 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.770
 there was not on the a19 94 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.960
 That year he was bought by a German and brought back with Germany 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.160
 but it still takes a long time 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.890
 that a restoration was started that is only in 2003 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.350
 now many people will wonder how the oldest prediction that the world 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:52.130
 turns 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.100
 and I can tell you because I drove hard about the 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.610
 first kilometers made after the restoration that seemed at first 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.150
 all disappointing and think strongly of a Volkswagen 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.780
 beetle 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.720
 above 4,000 revs you write that feeling to give it completely off 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:14.810
 many people on the street also gave questions what the car like this is worth after what 

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:17.809
 the closest thing to the neighborhood is it may be a porsche to nail up 

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:22.579
 and with a bit of this malfunction in a little good story two out of nine 

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:25.199
 copies have been built 

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:28.199
 there are now around 800 million dollars 

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:31.439
 a little more in the first instance
