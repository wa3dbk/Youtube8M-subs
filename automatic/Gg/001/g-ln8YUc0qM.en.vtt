$169.99 with tax so I think mood makes a

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.549 
$169.99 with tax so I think mood makes a
pretty<00:00:45.960> good<00:00:46.140> product<00:00:47.030> so<00:00:48.140> that's<00:00:49.140> what<00:00:49.440> I'll

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
pretty good product so that's what I'll

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.799 
pretty good product so that's what I'll
be<00:00:49.590> replacing<00:00:50.309> today<00:00:50.610> and<00:00:50.940> this<00:00:51.360> truck<00:00:51.629> and

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
be replacing today and this truck and

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.389 
be replacing today and this truck and
we'll<00:00:51.930> go<00:00:51.960> over<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.379> procedure<00:00:52.739> on<00:00:52.980> how<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.160> do

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
we'll go over the procedure on how to do

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.340 
we'll go over the procedure on how to do
it<00:00:53.570> won't<00:00:54.570> really<00:00:54.870> be<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.170> step-by-step<00:00:56.039> but

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
it won't really be a step-by-step but

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.610 
it won't really be a step-by-step but
you'll<00:00:58.350> get<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.710> idea<00:00:59.629> because<00:01:00.629> basically<00:01:01.199> if

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
you'll get the idea because basically if

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.230 
you'll get the idea because basically if
you<00:01:01.829> want<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.340> know<00:01:02.489> how<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:03.559> replace<00:01:04.559> this

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:05.240 
you want to know how to replace this

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.550 
you want to know how to replace this
it's<00:01:06.240> just<00:01:06.390> like<00:01:06.720> I<00:01:06.840> got<00:01:07.020> two<00:01:07.170> other<00:01:07.320> wheel

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
off as all one piece it's a the bracket

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.870 
off as all one piece it's a the bracket
bolts<00:02:22.590> are<00:02:22.680> right<00:02:22.860> here<00:02:23.160> and<00:02:23.280> over<00:02:23.400> there

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
bolts are right here and over there

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.270 
bolts are right here and over there
they're<00:02:24.120> like<00:02:24.510> 17<00:02:25.080> 18<00:02:25.110> millimeter<00:02:25.860> I<00:02:25.950> think

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
they're like 17 18 millimeter I think

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.460 
they're like 17 18 millimeter I think
they're<00:02:26.430> in<00:02:26.520> 18<00:02:26.820> not<00:02:27.600> real<00:02:27.750> sure<00:02:27.900> yeah<00:02:28.170> they're

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
they're in 18 not real sure yeah they're

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.700 
they're in 18 not real sure yeah they're
8<00:02:28.590> teams<00:02:28.800> but<00:02:29.760> take<00:02:30.630> those<00:02:30.840> out<00:02:31.050> scare<00:02:31.380> that<00:02:31.530> up

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
8 teams but take those out scare that up

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.970 
8 teams but take those out scare that up
there<00:02:31.950> and<00:02:32.160> now<00:02:32.700> we<00:02:33.120> can<00:02:33.270> get<00:02:33.420> to<00:02:33.860> taking<00:02:34.860> off

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
there and now we can get to taking off

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.980 
there and now we can get to taking off
that<00:02:35.580> cover<00:02:36.000> right<00:02:36.420> there<00:02:36.830> which<00:02:37.830> reveals<00:02:38.580> the

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990 
that cover right there which reveals the

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.500 
that cover right there which reveals the
36<00:02:39.990> millimeter<00:02:40.440> bolt<00:02:40.710> I<00:02:41.030> took<00:02:42.030> that<00:02:42.180> off<00:02:42.240> with

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
36 millimeter bolt I took that off with

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.940 
36 millimeter bolt I took that off with
an<00:02:42.630> impact<00:02:43.080> and<00:02:43.440> then<00:02:43.890> I<00:02:45.020> proceeded<00:02:46.020> on<00:02:46.290> to<00:02:46.680> I

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
an impact and then I proceeded on to I

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.850 
an impact and then I proceeded on to I
like<00:02:47.760> just<00:02:48.090> to<00:02:48.270> go<00:02:48.420> ahead<00:02:48.540> and<00:02:48.960> heat<00:02:49.260> the

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
like just to go ahead and heat the

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.160 
like just to go ahead and heat the
corners<00:02:50.460> right<00:02:50.490> up<00:02:51.060> there<00:02:51.330> they're<00:02:51.750> in<00:02:51.780> their

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
corners right up there they're in their

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.140 
corners right up there they're in their
own<00:02:52.200> have<00:02:52.620> you<00:02:52.740> seen<00:02:52.920> that<00:02:53.130> with<00:02:53.760> a<00:02:53.790> torch

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
own have you seen that with a torch

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.060 
own have you seen that with a torch
because<00:02:54.780> it<00:02:54.930> just<00:02:55.050> makes<00:02:55.320> everything<00:02:55.590> easier

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
your wheel hub assembly is free and then

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.110 
your wheel hub assembly is free and then
I<00:03:10.200> just<00:03:10.470> kind<00:03:10.740> of<00:03:10.800> tap<00:03:11.430> all<00:03:11.670> the<00:03:11.730> way<00:03:11.790> around

I just kind of tap all the way around
the<00:03:12.240> darn<00:03:12.450> thing<00:03:12.720> finally<00:03:13.080> this<00:03:13.380> thing<00:03:13.590> will

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
the darn thing finally this thing will

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:14.630 
the darn thing finally this thing will
fall<00:03:13.950> off

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
fall off

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.450 
fall off
it<00:03:14.730> was<00:03:15.270> pretty<00:03:15.510> stubborn<00:03:15.810> I'll<00:03:16.740> clean<00:03:17.280> this

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:17.460 
it was pretty stubborn I'll clean this

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.160 
it was pretty stubborn I'll clean this
grease<00:03:17.730> off<00:03:17.940> we<00:03:18.270> greased<00:03:18.570> it<00:03:18.600> because<00:03:19.050> the

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
grease off we greased it because the

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.090 
grease off we greased it because the
grease<00:03:19.700> for<00:03:20.700> this<00:03:21.020> spline<00:03:22.020> shaft<00:03:22.350> will<00:03:22.950> make

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
grease for this spline shaft will make

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.830 
grease for this spline shaft will make
it<00:03:23.250> a<00:03:23.340> lot<00:03:23.460> easier<00:03:23.520> for<00:03:23.970> the<00:03:24.090> next<00:03:24.360> time<00:03:24.570> you

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
it a lot easier for the next time you

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.650 
it a lot easier for the next time you
need<00:03:24.870> to<00:03:25.020> take<00:03:25.320> it<00:03:25.470> off<00:03:25.590> because<00:03:26.580> this<00:03:27.300> shaft

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
need to take it off because this shaft

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.460 
need to take it off because this shaft
will<00:03:27.900> slip<00:03:28.200> back<00:03:28.230> and<00:03:28.680> forth<00:03:30.050> so<00:03:31.050> basically

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
will slip back and forth so basically

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.280 
will slip back and forth so basically
and<00:03:31.590> then<00:03:31.680> we'll<00:03:31.830> put<00:03:31.980> it<00:03:32.070> all<00:03:32.190> back<00:03:32.310> together

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
and then we'll put it all back together

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.960 
and then we'll put it all back together
torque<00:03:34.290> specs<00:03:34.590> about<00:03:34.860> 150<00:03:35.430> foot<00:03:35.580> pounds<00:03:35.880> on

this freaking tight basically size you

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.270 
this freaking tight basically size you
can<00:03:39.180> get<00:03:39.390> it<00:03:39.510> because<00:03:40.170> that's<00:03:40.560> really<00:03:40.980> what

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
can get it because that's really what

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.000 
can get it because that's really what
