will need to focus towards the end of
the<00:05:10.590> fight<00:05:10.860> and<00:05:11.010> DPS<00:05:11.670> should<00:05:11.910> focus<00:05:12.090> at<00:05:12.450> the

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:12.630 
the fight and DPS should focus at the

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.350 
the fight and DPS should focus at the
start<00:05:12.960> of<00:05:13.110> the<00:05:13.230> fight<00:05:13.410> I<00:05:14.000> recommend<00:05:15.000> using

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 
start of the fight I recommend using

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.300 
start of the fight I recommend using
bloodlust<00:05:15.870> at<00:05:16.080> the<00:05:16.170> start<00:05:16.530> of<00:05:16.680> the<00:05:16.710> fight<00:05:16.920> sing

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.310 
bloodlust at the start of the fight sing

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:19.550 
bloodlust at the start of the fight sing
is<00:05:17.520> no<00:05:17.790> part<00:05:18.060> of<00:05:18.150> the<00:05:18.240> fight<00:05:18.420> really<00:05:19.020> needs<00:05:19.350> it

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
is no part of the fight really needs it

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.470 
is no part of the fight really needs it
so<00:05:19.860> may<00:05:20.220> as<00:05:20.340> well<00:05:20.430> use<00:05:20.490> it<00:05:20.700> at<00:05:20.940> the<00:05:21.030> start<00:05:21.270> with

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:21.480 
so may as well use it at the start with

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.780 
so may as well use it at the start with
potions<00:05:21.720> trinkets<00:05:22.350> and<00:05:22.440> cool<00:05:22.650> downs<00:05:22.860> so
