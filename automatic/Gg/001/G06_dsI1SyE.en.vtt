00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:10.550
 time to plant the garlic today 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.550
 large toes of echoes 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:19.109
 to the ground and here I already in the 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.580
 wood chips made a trench 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.180
 it is clearly somewhat dark because they 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:27.630
 Wood chips are still wet to the last 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.720
 rained and these wood chips that lie 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:34.410
 not very long here 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.579
 so what I'm going to do now is every ten 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.770
 centimeters or so 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.930
 stick a clove in the ground and then 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.030
 again over the wood chips 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.860
 and if all goes well we will see the 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.289
 green beers in the coming weeks 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.789
 come out of the ground here along this 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.989
 line 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:56.730
 comes a very long line, I guess so 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:58.770
 7 meter comes along this line 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.920
 I didn't stretch that line because 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:07.049
 the press wants to put a straight line but 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:09.420
 that way the children can see 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.610
 that it sat here because they walk here 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.229
 also to challenge that vegetable garden and I have 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.299
 no more tile paths where they are on 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.189
 walk just wood chips and then is 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.430
 the idea behind that later that 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.439
 garlic comes on and then some sort 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.880
 will provide natural border of 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.000
 where they can walk 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:30.329
 so as long as that is not yet visible 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.079
 so the string I now with rake 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.659
 wood chips 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:37.130
 pushed aside and we now go the 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.130
 put garlic cloves in the ground 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:45.330
 stand 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:45.330
 row 1 2 3 4 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.370
 you have the chef garlic clove on the 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:54.729
 top kind of dot and that is the 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:59.020
 bottom and put it at around 10 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:02:01.210
 centimeters in the ground and if you later 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.280
 had the whole line on one it had 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:08.140
 it just so 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:09.759
 the wood chips make the rain very simple 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.860
 and hopefully i can get you in a few 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.860
 have shown the result for weeks
