00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
we can see that the shade of red on both

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.660 
we can see that the shade of red on both
controllers<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.860> shade<00:00:53.039> of<00:00:53.160> blue<00:00:53.370> on<00:00:53.550> the

back does not actually match the

back does not actually match the
controller<00:00:56.309> it's<00:00:56.550> close<00:00:56.940> in<00:00:57.270> both<00:00:57.449> cases<00:00:57.750> but

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
controller it's close in both cases but

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.950 
controller it's close in both cases but
it's<00:00:59.039> slightly<00:00:59.399> more<00:00:59.550> close<00:01:00.270> with<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.750> Hori

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
it's slightly more close with the Hori

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.569 
it's slightly more close with the Hori
battle<00:01:01.260> pad<00:01:01.440> on<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.710> back<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.160> slightly<00:01:02.340> more

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
battle pad on the back and slightly more

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.060 
battle pad on the back and slightly more
close<00:01:02.760> with<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.229> PDP<00:01:04.229> pad<00:01:04.439> on<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.769> front

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
close with the PDP pad on the front

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.460 
close with the PDP pad on the front
looking<00:01:05.880> at<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.060> prices<00:01:06.450> on<00:01:06.600> Amazon<00:01:07.170> we<00:01:07.320> can

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
looking at the prices on Amazon we can

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.740 
looking at the prices on Amazon we can
see<00:01:07.710> that<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.189> Hori<00:01:08.400> battle<00:01:08.760> pad<00:01:08.970> retails<00:01:09.450> for

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
see that the Hori battle pad retails for

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.990 
see that the Hori battle pad retails for
price<00:01:10.350> that<00:01:10.590> is<00:01:10.740> comparably<00:01:11.159> slightly

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
price that is comparably slightly

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.399 
price that is comparably slightly
cheaper<00:01:12.860> than<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.159> PDP<00:01:14.670> pad<00:01:15.140> and<00:01:16.140> it<00:01:16.290> only

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
cheaper than the PDP pad and it only

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.020 
cheaper than the PDP pad and it only
comes<00:01:16.680> again<00:01:17.009> like<00:01:17.159> I<00:01:17.250> said<00:01:17.460> in<00:01:17.580> Mario<00:01:17.909> and

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
comes again like I said in Mario and

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.270 
comes again like I said in Mario and
Luigi<00:01:18.090> forms<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:19.080> PEP<00:01:19.409> pad<00:01:19.740> however<00:01:20.100> is

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
Luigi forms the PEP pad however is

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.890 
Luigi forms the PEP pad however is
cheaper<00:01:20.700> if<00:01:20.850> you<00:01:20.880> get<00:01:21.180> it<00:01:21.299> outside<00:01:21.689> of<00:01:21.750> the

getting the wrong kind of Wii mote but
if<00:01:58.049> you<00:01:58.140> go<00:01:58.380> back<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:59.009> like<00:01:59.219> original<00:02:00.119> Wii

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
there's a lot of stuff there so I guess

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.440 
there's a lot of stuff there so I guess
at<00:02:05.219> the<00:02:05.310> end<00:02:05.340> of<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.579> day<00:02:05.759> it<00:02:06.000> all<00:02:06.060> comes<00:02:06.270> down

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
at the end of the day it all comes down

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.029 
at the end of the day it all comes down
to<00:02:06.600> what<00:02:06.960> type<00:02:06.990> of<00:02:07.140> buttons<00:02:07.619> you<00:02:07.680> like<00:02:07.890> to

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
to what type of buttons you like to

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.720 
to what type of buttons you like to
press<00:02:08.310> if<00:02:09.239> you<00:02:09.450> like<00:02:09.599> to<00:02:09.750> use<00:02:09.989> the<00:02:10.619> L<00:02:11.009> and<00:02:11.489> R

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
press if you like to use the L and R

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.670 
press if you like to use the L and R
buttons<00:02:12.120> a<00:02:12.450> lot<00:02:12.959> on<00:02:13.080> the<00:02:13.200> back<00:02:13.410> of

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
buttons a lot on the back of

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.319 
buttons a lot on the back of
your<00:02:13.739> controller<00:02:14.129> then<00:02:14.790> you're<00:02:15.060> probably

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:15.329 
your controller then you're probably

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:17.630 
your controller then you're probably
going<00:02:15.599> to<00:02:15.689> prefer<00:02:16.200> the<00:02:16.409> PDP<00:02:16.980> tablet<00:02:17.340> slightly

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
going to prefer the PDP tablet slightly

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.229 
going to prefer the PDP tablet slightly
but<00:02:18.299> alternatively<00:02:19.019> if<00:02:19.409> you<00:02:19.579> enjoy<00:02:20.579> the<00:02:21.000> feel

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
but alternatively if you enjoy the feel

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:24.920 
but alternatively if you enjoy the feel
of<00:02:21.269> jumping<00:02:22.049> using<00:02:22.980> the<00:02:23.189> x<00:02:23.549> and<00:02:23.790> y<00:02:23.909> buttons<00:02:24.359> on

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
of jumping using the x and y buttons on

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.539 
of jumping using the x and y buttons on
a<00:02:24.989> game<00:02:25.379> controller<00:02:25.980> then<00:02:26.219> you're<00:02:26.370> probably

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:26.549 
a game controller then you're probably

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:28.429 
a game controller then you're probably
gonna<00:02:26.790> want<00:02:27.000> to<00:02:27.060> go<00:02:27.150> with<00:02:27.420> the<00:02:27.689> Horry<00:02:28.079> battle

00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:28.439 
gonna want to go with the Horry battle

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:29.599 
gonna want to go with the Horry battle
pad<00:02:28.560> which<00:02:28.680> is<00:02:28.769> what<00:02:28.920> I<00:02:28.950> do<00:02:29.069> which<00:02:29.340> is<00:02:29.370> why<00:02:29.579> I

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:29.609 
pad which is what I do which is why I

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:30.470 
pad which is what I do which is why I
would<00:02:29.879> go<00:02:30.000> with<00:02:30.180> it

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
would go with it

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.449 
would go with it
so<00:02:30.959> that's<00:02:31.530> my<00:02:31.709> review<00:02:31.980> at<00:02:32.099> the<00:02:32.189> end<00:02:32.219> of<00:02:32.400> the

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
so that's my review at the end of the

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.000 
so that's my review at the end of the
day<00:02:32.989> obviously<00:02:33.989> they're<00:02:34.109> both<00:02:34.139> good<00:02:34.769> in<00:02:34.889> their

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
day obviously they're both good in their

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.289 
day obviously they're both good in their
own<00:02:35.040> right<00:02:35.340> they're<00:02:35.549> very<00:02:35.730> different<00:02:36.090> pads

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:36.299 
own right they're very different pads

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:40.459 
own right they're very different pads
but<00:02:37.139> I<00:02:37.200> definitely<00:02:37.980> prefer<00:02:38.159> a<00:02:38.939> Horry<00:02:39.659> to<00:02:39.959> PDP

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:40.469 
but I definitely prefer a Horry to PDP

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:42.259 
but I definitely prefer a Horry to PDP
personally<00:02:41.099> because<00:02:41.730> it<00:02:41.909> not<00:02:42.030> only<00:02:42.060> looks

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
personally because it not only looks

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:44.390 
personally because it not only looks
more<00:02:43.049> like<00:02:43.230> a<00:02:43.260> game<00:02:43.500> controller<00:02:44.069> it<00:02:44.280> also

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
more like a game controller it also

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.250 
more like a game controller it also
feels<00:02:44.819> more<00:02:45.060> like<00:02:45.180> a<00:02:45.269> game<00:02:45.420> controller<00:02:45.989> and

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
feels more like a game controller and

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.440 
feels more like a game controller and
that<00:02:47.189> at<00:02:47.790> the<00:02:47.909> end<00:02:47.939> of<00:02:48.060> the<00:02:48.150> day<00:02:48.299> I<00:02:48.329> think

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
that at the end of the day I think

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:49.909 
that at the end of the day I think
should<00:02:48.900> be<00:02:48.930> the<00:02:49.139> most<00:02:49.319> important<00:02:49.739> factor

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:49.919 
should be the most important factor

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:52.759 
should be the most important factor
obviously<00:02:50.489> the<00:02:51.060> real<00:02:51.659> thing<00:02:51.989> you<00:02:52.260> still<00:02:52.560> got<00:02:52.739> a

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
obviously the real thing you still got a

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:54.259 
obviously the real thing you still got a
gamecube<00:02:52.950> controller<00:02:53.189> lying<00:02:53.790> around<00:02:53.909> is<00:02:54.150> the

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
gamecube controller lying around is the

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.839 
gamecube controller lying around is the
best<00:02:54.450> bet<00:02:54.720> I<00:02:54.930> use<00:02:55.439> that<00:02:55.680> with<00:02:55.859> a<00:02:55.889> converter<00:02:56.310> but

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:56.849 
best bet I use that with a converter but

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:58.909 
best bet I use that with a converter but
if<00:02:57.000> you're<00:02:57.209> getting<00:02:57.689> this<00:02:57.959> fresh<00:02:58.319> like<00:02:58.739> I<00:02:58.859> know

00:02:58.909 --> 00:02:58.919 
if you're getting this fresh like I know

a lot of people are like you probably

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:02.479
