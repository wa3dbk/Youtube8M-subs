00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
credit is basically any other network

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.290 
credit is basically any other network

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
putting a t-mobile SIM card in it

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.820 
putting a t-mobile SIM card in it
Rogers<00:00:30.090> in<00:00:30.300> Canada<00:00:30.660> t-mobile's<00:00:31.140> in<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.380> US<00:00:31.650> it

Rogers in Canada t-mobile's in the US it

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.220 
Rogers in Canada t-mobile's in the US it
doesn't<00:00:32.160> matter<00:00:32.340> what<00:00:32.579> network<00:00:33.110> now<00:00:34.110> it

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
doesn't matter what network now it

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.840 
doesn't matter what network now it
doesn't<00:00:34.410> necessarily<00:00:34.590> have<00:00:35.100> to<00:00:35.130> be<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.640> SIM

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
doesn't necessarily have to be the SIM

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.610 
doesn't necessarily have to be the SIM

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
phone like for example t-mobile SIM card

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.720 
phone like for example t-mobile SIM card
I<00:00:40.200> put<00:00:40.350> in<00:00:40.500> actually<00:00:40.649> doesn't<00:00:41.399> have<00:00:41.489> a<00:00:41.520> live

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
I put in actually doesn't have a live

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.660 
I put in actually doesn't have a live
line<00:00:42.000> on<00:00:42.420> it<00:00:42.629> but<00:00:43.260> it<00:00:43.379> will<00:00:43.500> work<00:00:43.680> so<00:00:43.950> this

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
line on it but it will work so this

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.400 
line on it but it will work so this
point<00:00:44.910> you've<00:00:45.059> gone<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.420> global<00:00:45.719> off<00:00:45.870> comm
