00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
now mode the Peyton Manning era and

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.950 
now mode the Peyton Manning era and
Denver<00:01:23.130> is<00:01:23.280> going<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:23.520> be<00:01:23.610> short-lived<00:01:24.180> okay

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
but they have the pieces in place to win

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.330 
but they have the pieces in place to win
now<00:01:27.210> this<00:01:27.780> keeps<00:01:28.110> them<00:01:28.290> in<00:01:28.439> my<00:01:28.619> mind<00:01:28.860> ahead<00:01:29.189> of

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
now this keeps them in my mind ahead of

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.280 
now this keeps them in my mind ahead of
the<00:01:29.430> Patriots<00:01:29.880> in<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.030> AFC<00:01:30.150> their<00:01:30.840> only<00:01:31.110> real

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
the Patriots in the AFC their only real

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.249 
the Patriots in the AFC their only real
chief<00:01:31.560> rival<00:01:32.040> and<00:01:32.250> more<00:01:32.880> importantly<00:01:33.420> I<00:01:33.689> don't

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
chief rival and more importantly I don't

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.780 
chief rival and more importantly I don't
think<00:01:34.439> they've<00:01:34.590> totally<00:01:34.860> closed<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.430> gap<00:01:35.579> on

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
think they've totally closed the gap on

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.730 
think they've totally closed the gap on
Seattle<00:01:36.360> but<00:01:36.689> I<00:01:36.750> think<00:01:37.020> Denver<00:01:37.200> certainly<00:01:37.710> a

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
Seattle but I think Denver certainly a

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.520 
Seattle but I think Denver certainly a
better<00:01:37.920> team<00:01:38.189> now<00:01:38.220> than<00:01:39.150> they<00:01:39.299> were<00:01:39.329> on<00:01:39.750> Super

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
better team now than they were on Super

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.440 
look this is a this is one that's going
to<00:01:46.530> sting<00:01:46.799> I<00:01:47.040> don't<00:01:47.220> think<00:01:47.369> anyone<00:01:47.729> thought<00:01:47.939> he

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
to sting I don't think anyone thought he

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.539 
to sting I don't think anyone thought he
would<00:01:48.630> get<00:01:48.780> this<00:01:49.020> kind<00:01:49.290> of<00:01:49.439> deal<00:01:49.710> a<00:01:49.979> long-term

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
would get this kind of deal a long-term

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.389 
would get this kind of deal a long-term
deal<00:01:51.149> given<00:01:51.600> his<00:01:51.689> past<00:01:51.899> history<00:01:52.229> but<00:01:52.950> give<00:01:53.280> the

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
deal given his past history but give the

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:54.920 
deal given his past history but give the
Broncos<00:01:53.790> credit<00:01:54.090> they<00:01:54.210> step<00:01:54.509> up<00:01:54.659> and<00:01:54.869> they

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
Broncos credit they step up and they

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.929 
Broncos credit they step up and they
give<00:01:55.110> it<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.350> them<00:01:55.500> with<00:01:56.159> some<00:01:56.430> risk<00:01:56.640> involved

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
give it to them with some risk involved

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.609 
give it to them with some risk involved
there's<00:01:57.299> not<00:01:57.450> that<00:01:57.479> the<00:01:57.719> no<00:01:57.990> risk<00:01:58.290> involved

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
there's not that the no risk involved

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.100 
there's not that the no risk involved
with<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.310> signing<00:01:59.549> of<00:01:59.790> to<00:01:59.969> leave<00:02:00.180> but<00:02:00.840> you

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
with the signing of to leave but you

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.380 
with the signing of to leave but you
know<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.680> Broncos<00:02:02.130> taking<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.820> strategy

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
know the Broncos taking the strategy

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.240 
know the Broncos taking the strategy
that<00:02:03.630> I<00:02:03.689> know<00:02:03.750> many<00:02:04.049> Patriots<00:02:04.500> fans<00:02:04.890> think

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
that I know many Patriots fans think

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.999 
that I know many Patriots fans think
they<00:02:05.369> should<00:02:05.610> be<00:02:05.790> with<00:02:06.390> Tom<00:02:06.630> Brady<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.590> window

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
they should be with Tom Brady the window

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.430 
they should be with Tom Brady the window
for<00:02:08.310> a<00:02:08.369> quarterback<00:02:08.849> it<00:02:09.209> is<00:02:09.360> mid<00:02:09.599> to<00:02:09.750> late<00:02:09.959> 30s

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
for a quarterback it is mid to late 30s

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.440 
for a quarterback it is mid to late 30s
short<00:02:11.039> let's<00:02:11.819> see<00:02:12.000> what<00:02:12.209> we<00:02:12.330> can<00:02:12.360> do<00:02:12.599> now<00:02:12.810> to

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
short let's see what we can do now to

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.720 
short let's see what we can do now to
win<00:02:13.569> now<00:02:13.780> and<00:02:14.200> clearly<00:02:15.069> the<00:02:15.280> plan<00:02:15.489> of<00:02:15.670> the

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
win now and clearly the plan of the

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.369 
win now and clearly the plan of the
Broncos<00:02:16.239> will<00:02:16.420> see<00:02:16.599> how<00:02:16.690> the<00:02:16.750> Patriots

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:17.379 
Broncos will see how the Patriots

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:19.979 
Broncos will see how the Patriots
respond<00:02:17.800> leaves<00:02:18.430> them<00:02:18.580> now<00:02:18.700> a<00:02:18.730> huge<00:02:19.239> hole<00:02:19.569> at

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
respond leaves them now a huge hole at

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:22.080 
respond leaves them now a huge hole at
the<00:02:20.110> cornerback<00:02:20.650> position<00:02:20.980> to<00:02:21.519> leap<00:02:21.700> far<00:02:21.970> and

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
the cornerback position to leap far and

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.780 
the cornerback position to leap far and
away<00:02:22.150> their<00:02:22.810> best<00:02:23.140> corner<00:02:23.560> last<00:02:23.830> year<00:02:24.280> guys

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
away their best corner last year guys

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:25.920 
away their best corner last year guys
let<00:02:25.060> me<00:02:25.150> know<00:02:25.269> what<00:02:25.390> you<00:02:25.510> think<00:02:25.690> of<00:02:25.810> the

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
let me know what you think of the

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.500 
let me know what you think of the
signing<00:02:26.379> of<00:02:26.560> a<00:02:27.040> keep<00:02:27.280> to<00:02:27.489> leave<00:02:27.670> there's<00:02:28.239> also

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
signing of a keep to leave there's also

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.180 
signing of a keep to leave there's also
probably<00:02:28.989> puts<00:02:29.230> Denver<00:02:29.620> out<00:02:29.769> of<00:02:29.920> the<00:02:30.010> running

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
probably puts Denver out of the running

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.220 
probably puts Denver out of the running
obviously<00:02:30.849> for<00:02:31.300> Darrelle<00:02:31.599> Revis<00:02:31.810> who's

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
obviously for Darrelle Revis who's

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.949 
obviously for Darrelle Revis who's
expected<00:02:32.739> to<00:02:32.800> be<00:02:32.920> released<00:02:32.950> on<00:02:33.459> Wednesday<00:02:34.420> so

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
expected to be released on Wednesday so

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:38.490 
expected to be released on Wednesday so
you<00:02:35.019> had<00:02:35.290> a<00:02:35.970> Tampa<00:02:36.970> releasing<00:02:37.480> it<00:02:37.599> Denver<00:02:38.349> as<00:02:38.470> a

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
you had a Tampa releasing it Denver as a

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.770 
you had a Tampa releasing it Denver as a
potential<00:02:38.890> landing<00:02:39.280> spot<00:02:39.599> seems<00:02:40.599> like

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
potential landing spot seems like

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.770 
potential landing spot seems like
certainly<00:02:41.319> it's<00:02:41.769> not<00:02:42.040> anymore<00:02:42.549> and<00:02:42.879> you<00:02:43.660> know

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
certainly it's not anymore and you know

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.960 
certainly it's not anymore and you know
we'll<00:02:43.959> see<00:02:43.989> how<00:02:44.349> the<00:02:44.410> market<00:02:44.980> for<00:02:45.610> Darrelle

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970
