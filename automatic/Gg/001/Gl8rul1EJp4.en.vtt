quite handy to have the lens up here in

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.410 
quite handy to have the lens up here in
the<00:00:28.560> top<00:00:28.769> corner<00:00:28.980> because<00:00:29.609> it's<00:00:29.849> been<00:00:30.119> easy

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
the top corner because it's been easy

shots on the move now you can see here

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:37.729 
shots on the move now you can see here
the<00:00:36.510> buttons<00:00:36.809> you've<00:00:36.930> got<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.170> on/off<00:00:37.380> button

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
and that's slightly different sides to

and that's slightly different sides to
the<00:00:39.510> shutter<00:00:39.750> release<00:00:40.079> so<00:00:40.410> it's<00:00:40.559> easy<00:00:40.770> to<00:00:40.890> feel

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160

is you've got these buttons on the back
here<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:49.739> this<00:00:49.920> one's<00:00:50.129> quite<00:00:50.340> prominent<00:00:50.820> so

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
here and this one's quite prominent so

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.790 
here and this one's quite prominent so
it's<00:00:51.059> quite<00:00:51.239> easy<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.750> press<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.379> button<00:00:52.649> if

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
it's quite easy to press the button if

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.740 
it's quite easy to press the button if
you're<00:00:53.190> just<00:00:53.399> holding<00:00:53.670> your<00:00:54.059> hand<00:00:54.300> all<00:00:54.539> the

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
you're just holding your hand all the

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.200 
you're just holding your hand all the
way<00:00:54.780> across<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.260> front<00:00:55.469> back<00:00:55.590> of<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.860> camera

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
way across the front back of the camera

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.970 
way across the front back of the camera
now<00:00:57.210> this<00:00:57.390> camera<00:00:57.809> has<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:57.960> 16.1<00:00:58.800> megapixel

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
now this camera has a 16.1 megapixel

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.430 
now this camera has a 16.1 megapixel
resolution<00:00:59.550> which<00:01:00.059> is<00:01:00.210> fairly<00:01:00.510> high<00:01:00.870> so<00:01:01.410> you

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
resolution which is fairly high so you

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.540 
resolution which is fairly high so you
should<00:01:01.680> be<00:01:01.710> able<00:01:01.770> to<00:01:01.920> get<00:01:02.039> pretty<00:01:02.190> detailed

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
should be able to get pretty detailed

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.670 
should be able to get pretty detailed
shots<00:01:02.940> but<00:01:03.480> then<00:01:03.600> again<00:01:03.750> it<00:01:04.229> might<00:01:04.409> struggle

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
shots but then again it might struggle

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.020 
shots but then again it might struggle
in<00:01:04.890> low-light<00:01:05.220> that's<00:01:05.489> something<00:01:05.760> we<00:01:05.850> won't

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
in low-light that's something we won't

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.580 
in low-light that's something we won't
know<00:01:06.210> until<00:01:06.450> we<00:01:06.600> get<00:01:06.750> it<00:01:06.900> out<00:01:07.020> of<00:01:07.140> this<00:01:07.320> bright

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
know until we get it out of this bright

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.440 
know until we get it out of this bright
environment<00:01:08.340> here<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:08.670> into<00:01:08.880> our<00:01:09.000> lab<00:01:09.240> for

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
environment here and into our lab for

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.750 
environment here and into our lab for
testing<00:01:10.040> now<00:01:11.040> you've<00:01:11.189> got<00:01:11.340> quite<00:01:11.520> a<00:01:11.580> lot<00:01:11.729> of

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
testing now you've got quite a lot of

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.880 
testing now you've got quite a lot of
menu<00:01:12.119> options<00:01:12.150> round<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.930> back<00:01:13.110> here<00:01:13.380> so<00:01:13.830> you

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
menu options round the back here so you

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.560 
menu options round the back here so you
can<00:01:14.189> choose<00:01:14.400> from<00:01:14.520> all<00:01:14.700> sorts<00:01:14.970> of<00:01:15.119> settings

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
can choose from all sorts of settings

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.480 
can choose from all sorts of settings
you've<00:01:15.810> got<00:01:15.960> like<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.140> panorama<00:01:16.680> mode<00:01:16.950> macro

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
you've got like a panorama mode macro

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.370 
you've got like a panorama mode macro
shooting<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:18.150> all<00:01:18.360> sorts<00:01:18.689> of<00:01:18.750> effects<00:01:19.170> you

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
shooting and all sorts of effects you

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.230 
shooting and all sorts of effects you
can<00:01:19.439> pick<00:01:19.710> out<00:01:19.830> highlight<00:01:20.280> colors<00:01:20.670> or<00:01:20.820> soften

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
can pick out highlight colors or soften

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.990 
can pick out highlight colors or soften
the<00:01:21.360> way<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.659> shot<00:01:21.869> looks<00:01:22.280> now<00:01:23.280> it's<00:01:23.670> only<00:01:23.820> got

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
the way the shot looks now it's only got

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.030 
the way the shot looks now it's only got
a<00:01:24.030> limited<00:01:24.270> four<00:01:24.810> times<00:01:25.110> optical<00:01:25.320> zoom<00:01:25.590> and

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
a limited four times optical zoom and

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.740 
a limited four times optical zoom and
that<00:01:26.400> is<00:01:26.549> quite<00:01:26.790> limited<00:01:26.970> for<00:01:27.360> this<00:01:27.479> kind<00:01:27.689> of

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
that is quite limited for this kind of

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.030 
that is quite limited for this kind of
camera<00:01:27.930> but<00:01:28.140> you<00:01:28.229> expect<00:01:28.680> it<00:01:28.920> because

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
camera but you expect it because

camera but you expect it because
obviously<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.729> lens<00:01:29.909> can't<00:01:30.210> stick<00:01:30.570> out<00:01:30.720> the

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
obviously the lens can't stick out the

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.200 
obviously the lens can't stick out the
front<00:01:31.079> when<00:01:31.259> it<00:01:31.380> needs<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.680> be<00:01:31.799> waterproof<00:01:32.400> now

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210
