00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:03:03.630 

you

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.990 

so<00:03:17.330> why<00:03:17.510> actually<00:03:17.990> does<00:03:18.230> is<00:03:18.500> it<00:03:18.580> closes<00:03:19.580> the

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
so why actually does is it closes the

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.390 
so why actually does is it closes the
gap<00:03:20.380> automatically<00:03:23.890> so<00:03:24.890> if<00:03:24.980> you<00:03:25.070> want<00:03:25.250> the

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
gap automatically so if you want the

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.040 
gap automatically so if you want the
gaps<00:03:25.670> in<00:03:25.880> the<00:03:26.030> brace<00:03:26.300> to<00:03:26.330> close<00:03:26.780> immediately

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
gaps in the brace to close immediately

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:32.710 
gaps in the brace to close immediately
the<00:03:27.740> edges<00:03:28.220> give<00:03:28.430> you<00:03:28.610> better<00:03:30.370> sectioning<00:03:31.720> and

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
the edges give you better sectioning and

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.280 
the edges give you better sectioning and
this<00:03:32.960> is<00:03:33.110> what<00:03:33.260> I<00:03:33.290> mean

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290
