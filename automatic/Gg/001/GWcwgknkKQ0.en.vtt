what I thought it was going to be it's
sporty<00:00:49.800> I<00:00:50.100> think<00:00:50.820> as<00:00:50.940> 40<00:00:51.390> as<00:00:51.570> it<00:00:51.750> should<00:00:52.079> be<00:00:52.520> BMW

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
sporty I think as 40 as it should be BMW

sporty I think as 40 as it should be BMW
does<00:00:53.670> a<00:00:53.700> great<00:00:53.910> job<00:00:53.970> with<00:00:54.270> their<00:00:54.420> interiors

overall<00:01:01.530> I<00:01:01.680> think<00:01:02.040> just<00:01:02.340> what<00:01:02.520> you<00:01:02.640> would

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730

overall I think just what you would
expect<00:01:02.790> sporty<00:01:03.540> steering<00:01:03.780> wheel<00:01:04.110> but<00:01:04.320> BMW<00:01:05.160> is

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
expect sporty steering wheel but BMW is

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.190 
expect sporty steering wheel but BMW is
just<00:01:05.910> on<00:01:06.030> a<00:01:06.060> roll<00:01:06.330> their<00:01:06.570> stuff<00:01:06.840> is<00:01:06.960> really

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
just on a roll their stuff is really

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.070 
just on a roll their stuff is really
solid<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:08.070> although<00:01:08.940> I'm<00:01:09.210> not<00:01:09.390> crazy<00:01:09.840> about

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
solid and although I'm not crazy about

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.249 
solid and although I'm not crazy about
the<00:01:10.440> external<00:01:10.950> styling<00:01:11.399> on<00:01:11.550> this<00:01:12.259> overall

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:13.259 
the external styling on this overall

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:14.930
