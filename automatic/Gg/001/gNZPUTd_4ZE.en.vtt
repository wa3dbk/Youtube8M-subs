the<00:02:18.940> net<00:02:19.120> so<00:02:19.360> they<00:02:19.480> have<00:02:19.569> more<00:02:19.690> time<00:02:19.930> to<00:02:20.080> get<00:02:20.200> it

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
the net so they have more time to get it

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.780 
the net so they have more time to get it
and<00:02:20.530> that<00:02:20.950> they<00:02:21.040> can<00:02:21.190> hit<00:02:21.310> it<00:02:21.459> in<00:02:21.550> any
