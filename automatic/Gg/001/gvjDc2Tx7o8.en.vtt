solid<00:01:24.319> we<00:01:24.560> had<00:01:24.710> a<00:01:24.740> thaw<00:01:25.729> a<00:01:26.149> significant

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:27.079 
solid we had a thaw a significant

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:28.660 
solid we had a thaw a significant
thought<00:01:27.259> and<00:01:27.469> then<00:01:27.560> it<00:01:27.679> froze<00:01:27.979> down<00:01:28.249> to<00:01:28.399> minus

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
thought and then it froze down to minus

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.480 
thought and then it froze down to minus
25<00:01:29.030> or<00:01:29.479> so<00:01:29.630> it's<00:01:30.530> just<00:01:30.679> rock<00:01:30.920> hard<00:01:31.840> this<00:01:32.840> is

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
25 or so it's just rock hard this is

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.359 
25 or so it's just rock hard this is
very<00:01:34.490> different<00:01:34.819> than<00:01:35.030> it<00:01:35.240> was<00:01:35.389> in<00:01:35.600> January

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:36.369

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
the snowmobilers have been in here it's

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.330 
the snowmobilers have been in here it's
a<00:01:38.659> lake<00:01:38.810> trout<00:01:39.049> lake<00:01:39.229> and<00:01:41.020> it's<00:01:42.020> it<00:01:42.859> looks<00:01:42.920> like

the<00:01:43.520> lake<00:01:43.700> is<00:01:43.880> packed<00:01:44.179> hard<00:01:44.509> I<00:01:44.659> think<00:01:44.719> I<00:01:44.959> can

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
the lake is packed hard I think I can

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.590 
the lake is packed hard I think I can
boot<00:01:45.380> it<00:01:45.639> all<00:01:46.639> the<00:01:46.729> way<00:01:46.819> down<00:01:47.030> the<00:01:47.149> lake<00:01:47.299> if<00:01:47.479> I

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
boot it all the way down the lake if I

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.179 
boot it all the way down the lake if I
stay<00:01:47.810> on<00:01:47.929> those<00:01:48.079> trails<00:01:48.409> if<00:01:48.649> they<00:01:48.829> should<00:01:48.889> take

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:49.189 
stay on those trails if they should take

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:51.899 
stay on those trails if they should take
me<00:01:49.340> right<00:01:49.520> by<00:01:49.700> my<00:01:49.850> campsite<00:01:50.179> I<00:01:50.509> hope<00:01:50.719> nobody's

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:51.909 
me right by my campsite I hope nobody's

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:54.699 
me right by my campsite I hope nobody's
helped<00:01:52.909> themselves<00:01:53.030> to<00:01:53.450> my<00:01:53.689> wood<00:01:54.020> supply<00:01:54.409> that

00:01:54.699 --> 00:01:54.709 
helped themselves to my wood supply that

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:57.849 
helped themselves to my wood supply that
I<00:01:54.770> stashed<00:01:55.189> back<00:01:55.789> in<00:01:55.999> the<00:01:56.090> bush<00:01:56.299> I<00:01:56.679> guess<00:01:57.679> we'll

00:01:57.849 --> 00:01:57.859 
I stashed back in the bush I guess we'll

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:04.059 
I stashed back in the bush I guess we'll
find<00:01:58.130> out<00:01:59.979> what<00:02:00.979> a<00:02:01.189> day<00:02:01.459> what<00:02:02.299> a<00:02:02.329> day<00:02:02.450> I<00:02:03.069> don't

think there'll be any slush out there
her<00:02:05.779> if<00:02:05.899> there<00:02:06.109> is<00:02:06.609> it<00:02:07.609> won't<00:02:07.789> be<00:02:07.909> under<00:02:08.060> the

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:28.410 
in balsam vows where I left them we had
actually<00:04:27.280> about<00:04:27.460> a<00:04:27.520> foot<00:04:27.730> of<00:04:27.850> snow<00:04:27.880> but<00:04:28.240> a<00:04:28.270> lot

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:28.420 
actually about a foot of snow but a lot

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:30.570 
actually about a foot of snow but a lot
of<00:04:28.450> it<00:04:28.600> melted<00:04:28.990> and<00:04:29.800> there<00:04:30.070> was<00:04:30.160> a<00:04:30.190> horrible

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
of it melted and there was a horrible
