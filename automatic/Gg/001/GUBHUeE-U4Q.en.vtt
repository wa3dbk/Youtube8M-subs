00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:03.979
 If the Galaxy S6, here in its "Edge" version with curved edges, puts 

00:00:03.979 --> 00:00:06.939
 especially the emphasis on its new design, it also includes new products 

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:10.719
 software that allows you to exploit your full potential. I am Thomas 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:14.250
 of Android MT, and we'll see together twelve tips for the Galaxy S6 and 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.410
 the Galaxy S6 Edge. 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:32.550
 Like HTC and "Blinkfeed", Samsung offers information curator 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:33.770
 named "Briefing". 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.399
 To disable it, make a long press on an empty place of the office, 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:39.829
 and drag the screens until you find "Briefing". 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:42.319
 Uncheck the box just above. 

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:43.919
 to remove the interface. 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.660
 Introduced with the Galaxy S5, the "Download Booster" allows to download more 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.160
 quickly by combining Wi-Fi and 4G. To activate it on the Galaxy S6, go 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.810
 in the Settings, 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.120
 and in "More connection settings", touch "Download Booster" 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.680
 to activate the cursor here. 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.510
 Samsung had promised us that the Galaxy S6 would ship less 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.930
 preinstalled applications, 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.320
 and especially that they would be easier to remove. 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.580
 This is not entirely true, but you can still disable some of it. 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:17.730
 Go to the launcher and, at the top right, touch "Edit". 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.370
 The small "-" that appear shows the applications that can be disabled. 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.270
 Touch those of your choice and press "OK" to validate. 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.570
 Warning: a deactivated application always remains on your phone 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.240
 and takes up space on the storage space. On the other hand, it will only 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.160
 absolutely nothing. 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.420
 Galaxy S6's "Do not disturb" mode is actually the same as the one 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.710
 introduced by Android 5.0 Lollipop 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.940
 but much easier to set up. 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.160
 Go to Settings, and in "Sounds and Notifications", touch "Do not disturb" 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.910
 to activate the mode. It is possible to allow exceptions, in other words 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.260
 you will still receive alarms, calls and messages, or even 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.660
 specific application notifications. 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.930
 You can also "Define the program", ie a start and 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.730
 an automatic stop of the "Do not disturb" mode. 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.170
 To change the graphical interface of your Galaxy S6, no need to switch 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.119
 by an alternative application launcher. 

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:15.280
 Just make a long press on an empty area of ​​the desktop and tap the "Themes" option. 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.900
 You can download here, knowing that there are paid and free. 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.860
 Obviously the shop contains a lot more. 

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:28.609
 Preinstalled on the Galaxy S6, the "Smart Manager" application acts as 

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:30.380
 "Clean Master" or "CCleaner". 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.450
 With it, you can for example free up storage space by 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.499
 deleting files deemed unnecessary, 

00:02:35.499 --> 00:02:38.769
 but also free RAM, so that your phone turns a little faster 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:41.039
 by removing background tasks. 

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:44.419
 Note that the "Clear All" button will free up storage space and 

00:02:44.419 --> 00:02:46.459
 free RAM with one click. 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:51.249
 Samsung has also thought about music lovers. By plugging in a headset or 

00:02:51.249 --> 00:02:53.000
 headphones to your Galaxy S6, 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.710
 you have access to options that allow you to make the most of your 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:56.910
 favorite titles. 

00:02:57.779 --> 00:02:59.580
 Go to Device Settings 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.169
 and in "Sounds &amp; Notifications", touch "Quality &amp; Sound Effects". 

00:03:03.169 --> 00:03:07.259
 Here you can simulate a "surround" effect with the "SoundAlive +" option, 

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:11.139
 or a "Tube amp", with the option here present. 

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:14.780
 Now let's take a look at the camera 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.390
 Galaxy S6. if you are the type to want to check immediately if 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:19.790

 go to the Photo App Settings and check the box 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.389
 "Evaluate the photos". 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:27.649
 From now on, when you take a snapshot, it will appear directly 

00:03:27.649 --> 00:03:30.789
 on the screen of the S6, before disappearing into the gallery. 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:34.839
 It is possible to obtain more settings in order to properly set the shooting. 

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:37.799
 Touch here "Mode" and activate the "Pro" mode. 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:41.449
 you will have access to several white scales, among those proposed, 

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:44.929

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:48.749
 Note that you can also add a particular tone to your photos. 

00:03:48.749 --> 00:03:53.789
 These are either directly pre-registered or fully customizable. 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:01.779
 The videos recorded by the Galaxy S6 are by default in Full HD. 

00:04:01.779 --> 00:04:05.650
 Know that you can ride up to Ultra HD. Go for that 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.890
 in Settings, and in "Video Resolution", check the "UHD" box .. 

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:13.200
 Warning: this will disable some functions, such as 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.680
 the image stabilizer. 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:20.459
 Let's see to finish two features specific to the Galaxy S6 Edge and 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:21.629
 at its curved edges. 

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:23.260
 In the Device Settings, 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.050
 go to "Side Screen" 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.180
 and activate the night clock. It's actually an automatic activation of the 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.160
 sidebar to display the time for a given period. 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.159
 The second tip for the sidebar of the Galaxy S6 Edge is 

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:38.679
 how to add a contact in the shortcut bar. 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.029

00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:44.430
 and add the contact of your wish. 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.789
 Now, when you tap on it, 

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:50.809
