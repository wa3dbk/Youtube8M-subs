are<00:04:13.430> there<00:04:14.440> it's<00:04:15.440> a<00:04:15.709> good<00:04:16.280> idea<00:04:16.699> not<00:04:17.120> to<00:04:17.180> run

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
are there it's a good idea not to run

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:19.569 
are there it's a good idea not to run
the<00:04:17.810> installer<00:04:18.229> again<00:04:18.650> because<00:04:19.039> on<00:04:19.220> Windows

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:19.579 
the installer again because on Windows

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:20.860 
the installer again because on Windows
you<00:04:19.789> would<00:04:19.910> actually<00:04:20.060> have<00:04:20.389> to<00:04:20.539> run<00:04:20.720> the

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
you would actually have to run the

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.589 
you would actually have to run the
uninstaller<00:04:21.380> first<00:04:22.099> so<00:04:22.880> what<00:04:23.090> you'll<00:04:23.300> need<00:04:23.450> to

00:04:23.589 --> 00:04:23.599 
uninstaller first so what you'll need to

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:25.990 
uninstaller first so what you'll need to
do<00:04:23.780> if<00:04:24.080> for<00:04:24.140> some<00:04:24.710> strange<00:04:25.099> reason<00:04:25.219> there<00:04:25.880> is

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
do if for some strange reason there is

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.020 
do if for some strange reason there is
no<00:04:26.030> automate<00:04:26.719> folder<00:04:27.140> is<00:04:27.289> to<00:04:28.280> open

no automate folder is to open

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.360 
no automate folder is to open
the<00:04:29.090> plugins<00:04:29.480> folder<00:04:29.540> and<00:04:30.050> just<00:04:30.500> simply<00:04:30.800> make

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 
the plugins folder and just simply make

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:34.000
