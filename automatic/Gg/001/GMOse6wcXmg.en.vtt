this test program that we have and give
you<00:05:39.700> an<00:05:39.790> idea<00:05:40.090> how<00:05:40.150> it<00:05:40.960> works

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:55.030 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:57.930 

this<00:05:55.510> program<00:05:56.020> I<00:05:56.260> don't<00:05:56.440> know<00:05:56.500> they<00:05:56.760> bury<00:05:57.760> the

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:57.940 
this program I don't know they bury the

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:00.210 
this program I don't know they bury the

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:00.220 
spindle speed back and forth as they do

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:03.060 
spindle speed back and forth as they do
a<00:06:00.540> some<00:06:01.540> movement<00:06:02.020> but<00:06:02.260> just<00:06:02.800> give<00:06:02.950> you<00:06:03.040> a

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:03.070 
a some movement but just give you a

00:06:03.070 --> 00:07:18.100 
a some movement but just give you a
basic<00:06:03.310> idea<00:06:03.580> here

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:18.110 

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:22.400 

alright<00:07:19.110> that's<00:07:19.440> the<00:07:19.920> cycle<00:07:20.580> and<00:07:21.200> that's<00:07:22.200> the

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:22.410 
alright that's the cycle and that's the

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:25.220 
alright that's the cycle and that's the
machine<00:07:23.000> if<00:07:24.000> you<00:07:24.120> have<00:07:24.270> any<00:07:24.450> questions<00:07:24.900> feel
