important features i think the most
important<00:00:32.520> one<00:00:32.550> is<00:00:32.700> for<00:00:33.480> channel<00:00:33.870> audio

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
important one is for channel audio

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.020 
important one is for channel audio
recording<00:00:34.680> so<00:00:35.520> now<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.790> camera<00:00:36.360> has<00:00:36.800> four

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
recording so now the camera has four

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.030 
recording so now the camera has four
24-bit<00:00:39.030> 48<00:00:39.570> kilohertz<00:00:39.870> audio<00:00:40.649> channel

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
channel inputs via what we called a

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.240 
channel inputs via what we called a
monthly<00:00:57.539> interface<00:00:58.109> shoe<00:00:58.350> so<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:58.770> may<00:00:59.010> hear

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
about it as a mi shoe multi interface

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.189 
about it as a mi shoe multi interface
and<00:01:02.070> there<00:01:03.059> are<00:01:03.149> different<00:01:03.510> accessories<00:01:03.870> that

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
and there are different accessories that

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.760 
and there are different accessories that
can<00:01:04.320> be<00:01:04.470> connected<00:01:04.760> one<00:01:05.760> of<00:01:05.909> them<00:01:06.060> is<00:01:06.770> using

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
can be connected one of them is using

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.359 
can be connected one of them is using
the<00:01:07.950> UWPD<00:01:08.700> wireless<00:01:09.630> system<00:01:10.049> it<00:01:10.260> is<00:01:10.369> possible

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
the UWPD wireless system it is possible

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.030 
the UWPD wireless system it is possible
to<00:01:11.430> attach<00:01:11.939> an<00:01:12.240> mi<00:01:12.540> shoe<00:01:12.750> adapter<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.500> then

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
to attach an mi shoe adapter and then

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.240 
to attach an mi shoe adapter and then
that<00:01:14.460> feeds<00:01:14.880> without<00:01:15.720> any<00:01:15.900> wires<00:01:16.170> into<00:01:16.890> the

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
that feeds without any wires into the

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.130 
that feeds without any wires into the
the<00:01:17.790> camera<00:01:18.150> and<00:01:18.270> could<00:01:18.450> be<00:01:18.600> assigned<00:01:18.930> to

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
the camera and could be assigned to

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.730 
the camera and could be assigned to
channel<00:01:19.560> three<00:01:19.710> or<00:01:19.860> four<00:01:20.130> or<00:01:21.049> any<00:01:22.049> channel<00:01:22.530> is

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
channel three or four or any channel is

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.590 
channel three or four or any channel is
essentially<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:24.560> it<00:01:25.560> also<00:01:25.799> there's<00:01:26.430> another

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
you have the XC CA ff7 module we can now

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.150 
you have the XC CA ff7 module we can now
encode<00:02:17.320> progress<00:02:17.920> HD<00:02:18.490> pro<00:02:18.760> res<00:02:18.970> at<00:02:19.330> HQ<00:02:20.290> or<00:02:20.560> 42

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
encode progress HD pro res at HQ or 42

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.630 
encode progress HD pro res at HQ or 42
and<00:02:21.640> then<00:02:22.270> record<00:02:22.930> it<00:02:23.020> back<00:02:23.319> onto<00:02:23.650> the<00:02:23.860> xqt

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
and then record it back onto the xqt

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.920 
and then record it back onto the xqt
memory<00:02:25.060> cards<00:02:25.570> and<00:02:25.840> the<00:02:26.709> last<00:02:26.950> feature<00:02:27.489> is

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
memory cards and the last feature is

16<00:03:23.980> millimeter<00:03:24.400> lenses<00:03:24.820> on<00:03:25.000> the<00:03:25.120> camera<00:03:25.480> and

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
16 millimeter lenses on the camera and

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:30.569 
16 millimeter lenses on the camera and
use<00:03:26.200> them<00:03:26.380> directly<00:03:27.030> and<00:03:28.030> as<00:03:28.540> well<00:03:28.840> as<00:03:29.260> using<00:03:30.220> a

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:30.579 
use them directly and as well as using a

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:32.699 
use them directly and as well as using a
tooth<00:03:30.970> or<00:03:31.150> change<00:03:31.390> be<00:03:31.690> four<00:03:31.720> lenses<00:03:32.170> as<00:03:32.500> well

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
tooth or change be four lenses as well

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:34.830 
tooth or change be four lenses as well
so<00:03:33.010> this<00:03:33.220> this<00:03:33.730> is<00:03:33.910> a<00:03:33.940> important

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
so this this is a important

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.009 
so this this is a important
functionality<00:03:35.350> for<00:03:35.890> people<00:03:36.250> who<00:03:36.370> need<00:03:36.400> to<00:03:37.019> do

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
functionality for people who need to do

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:39.810 
functionality for people who need to do
documentary<00:03:38.709> work<00:03:38.920> where<00:03:39.220> you<00:03:39.250> need<00:03:39.519> to<00:03:39.640> have

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
documentary work where you need to have

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:43.560 
documentary work where you need to have
a<00:03:39.850> very<00:03:40.209> long<00:03:41.019> focal<00:03:41.709> range<00:03:41.980> very<00:03:42.820> assumed

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
a very long focal range very assumed

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:48.840 
a very long focal range very assumed
range<00:03:43.930> and<00:03:44.640> or<00:03:45.640> even<00:03:46.890> deep<00:03:47.890> depth<00:03:48.250> of<00:03:48.400> field<00:03:48.579> so

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 
range and or even deep depth of field so

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.470 
range and or even deep depth of field so
to<00:03:49.120> follow<00:03:50.079> the<00:03:50.320> action<00:03:50.440> so<00:03:51.010> all<00:03:51.459> of<00:03:51.519> this<00:03:51.820> just

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
to follow the action so all of this just

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.840 
to follow the action so all of this just
expands<00:03:53.350> the<00:03:53.560> lensing<00:03:53.920> capability<00:03:54.609> to<00:03:54.640> that

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:54.850 
expands the lensing capability to that

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:55.220 
expands the lensing capability to that
