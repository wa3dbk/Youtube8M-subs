lightweight case and it's designed this

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.950 
lightweight case and it's designed this
way<00:01:00.400> because<00:01:00.640> it's<00:01:00.790> designed<00:01:01.240> to<00:01:01.360> protect<00:01:01.570> all

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:01.960 
way because it's designed to protect all

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270 
the corners it's got xrd power on foam

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.200 
the corners it's got xrd power on foam
in<00:01:08.259> there<00:01:08.530> so<00:01:08.799> it's<00:01:08.980> very<00:01:09.160> impact<00:01:09.670> resistant

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 
in there so it's very impact resistant

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
have a look in here but they're easily

principle they've been put in exactly
the<00:02:07.240> right<00:02:07.390> place<00:02:07.570> so<00:02:07.990> your<00:02:08.170> mute<00:02:08.349> switch<00:02:08.590> you

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:08.769 
the right place so your mute switch you

the right place so your mute switch you
can<00:02:08.920> get<00:02:09.129> to<00:02:09.450> that's<00:02:10.450> a<00:02:10.569> little<00:02:10.780> bit<00:02:10.899> tricky

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
can get to that's a little bit tricky

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:12.869 
can get to that's a little bit tricky
because<00:02:11.349> that's<00:02:11.590> quite<00:02:11.799> far<00:02:12.069> inset<00:02:12.549> because

00:02:12.869 --> 00:02:12.879 
because that's quite far inset because

of this corner that kind of sticks out
your<00:02:16.569> power<00:02:17.379> button<00:02:17.680> lock<00:02:18.099> but

your power button lock but
up<00:02:18.609> here<00:02:18.849> is<00:02:19.120> easily<00:02:19.569> possible<00:02:19.959> but<00:02:20.140> it's

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
up here is easily possible but it's

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.899 
up here is easily possible but it's
covered<00:02:20.530> again<00:02:20.620> so<00:02:20.950> that's<00:02:21.099> protected<00:02:21.730> and

00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:21.909 
covered again so that's protected and

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:25.530 
covered again so that's protected and
then<00:02:22.540> at<00:02:22.659> the<00:02:22.689> bottom<00:02:22.840> as<00:02:23.730> you'd<00:02:24.730> expect<00:02:24.879> all

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
then at the bottom as you'd expect all

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.399 
then at the bottom as you'd expect all
your<00:02:26.079> speakers<00:02:26.709> and<00:02:26.920> your<00:02:27.040> Porter<00:02:27.840> left<00:02:28.840> open

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:29.409 
your speakers and your Porter left open

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:31.140 
your speakers and your Porter left open
but<00:02:29.680> it's<00:02:29.859> not<00:02:29.980> completely<00:02:30.400> exposed<00:02:30.879> there's

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
but it's not completely exposed there's

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.270 
but it's not completely exposed there's
still<00:02:31.359> some<00:02:31.629> protection<00:02:32.170> there<00:02:32.349> it's<00:02:32.859> a<00:02:33.010> very

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
still some protection there it's a very

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.119 
still some protection there it's a very
very<00:02:33.340> rigid<00:02:33.939> material<00:02:34.510> that<00:02:34.659> they've<00:02:34.840> used

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:35.129 
very rigid material that they've used

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:37.559 
very rigid material that they've used
there<00:02:36.129> so<00:02:36.489> it<00:02:36.609> should<00:02:36.849> retain<00:02:37.150> its<00:02:37.359> shape

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
there so it should retain its shape

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.020 
there so it should retain its shape
quite<00:02:37.900> well<00:02:38.109> it<00:02:38.739> feels<00:02:38.980> very<00:02:39.280> light<00:02:39.489> in<00:02:39.760> hand

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
quite well it feels very light in hand

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.670 
quite well it feels very light in hand
doesn't<00:02:40.450> feel<00:02:40.750> it<00:02:40.840> really<00:02:41.109> feel<00:02:41.349> like<00:02:41.530> you've

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
doesn't feel it really feel like you've

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.559 
doesn't feel it really feel like you've
got<00:02:41.709> much<00:02:42.040> on<00:02:42.250> there<00:02:42.459> apart<00:02:42.790> from<00:02:42.849> the<00:02:43.090> unusual

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569 
got much on there apart from the unusual

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:45.509 
got much on there apart from the unusual
shape<00:02:43.870> but<00:02:44.560> it<00:02:44.680> does<00:02:44.829> feel<00:02:44.859> very<00:02:45.310> comfortable

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
shape but it does feel very comfortable

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:49.050 
shape but it does feel very comfortable
and<00:02:47.069> obviously<00:02:48.069> I<00:02:48.219> have<00:02:48.400> another<00:02:48.609> chance<00:02:48.879> to

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
and obviously I have another chance to

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.520 
and obviously I have another chance to
go<00:02:49.209> and<00:02:49.359> start<00:02:49.569> throwing<00:02:49.780> my<00:02:49.989> iPhone<00:02:50.409> on

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
go and start throwing my iPhone on

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.979 
go and start throwing my iPhone on
concrete<00:02:50.919> but<00:02:51.280> I'd<00:02:51.939> be<00:02:52.150> quite<00:02:52.329> happy<00:02:52.450> to<00:02:52.750> have

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
concrete but I'd be quite happy to have

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:54.599 
concrete but I'd be quite happy to have
that<00:02:53.169> on<00:02:53.319> my<00:02:53.349> phone<00:02:53.769> and<00:02:53.799> not<00:02:54.040> only<00:02:54.189> because<00:02:54.430> of

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:54.609 
that on my phone and not only because of

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:56.250 
that on my phone and not only because of
the<00:02:54.730> corner<00:02:55.120> protection<00:02:55.510> that<00:02:55.780> you<00:02:55.900> can<00:02:56.049> see

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
the corner protection that you can see

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.069 
the corner protection that you can see
on<00:02:56.409> there<00:02:56.590> but<00:02:57.400> also<00:02:57.549> this<00:02:57.939> it's<00:02:58.659> got<00:02:58.810> quite<00:02:58.959> a

00:02:59.069 --> 00:02:59.079 
on there but also this it's got quite a

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:01.020 
on there but also this it's got quite a
thick<00:02:59.409> Ridge<00:02:59.680> just<00:03:00.010> above<00:03:00.250> the<00:03:00.430> display<00:03:00.760> that

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
thick Ridge just above the display that

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.030 
thick Ridge just above the display that
surrounds<00:03:01.540> the<00:03:01.689> whole<00:03:01.870> display<00:03:02.349> as<00:03:02.590> a<00:03:02.620> frame

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
surrounds the whole display as a frame

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.610 
surrounds the whole display as a frame
so<00:03:03.760> if<00:03:03.879> it<00:03:04.000> does<00:03:04.180> land<00:03:04.510> facedown<00:03:05.139> it's<00:03:05.439> also

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
so if it does land facedown it's also

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.300 
so if it does land facedown it's also
protected<00:03:06.400> which<00:03:06.549> is<00:03:06.760> that's<00:03:07.150> really<00:03:07.510> great

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
protected which is that's really great

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.830 
protected which is that's really great
