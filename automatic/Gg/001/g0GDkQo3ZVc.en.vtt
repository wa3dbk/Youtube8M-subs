00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.450
 and basically it is a disease 

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:14.790
 relates to the increase in pressure 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.880
 inside the eye and it's a disease that 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.619
 by increasing the pressure inside the eye 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:23.039
 it produces nerve tissue damage 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:25.230
 of the retina basically and this is going to 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.110
 translate with an alteration in the 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.390
 optic nerve which is the nerve 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.160
 that collects all the information of the 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.410
 retina and sends it to the brain 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.570
 when the pressure inside the eye increases 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.850
 injured in these fibers damage the 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.310
 iii optical and functionally translates 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.410
 with the loss of vision of the field 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:45.750
 visual that comes from the periphery 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.540
 towards the center this is what it does 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.610
 quite complex to the disease of 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.989
 glaucoma that is not really a single 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.300
 disease but they are multiple 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:58.040
 diseases that have as epicenter 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.040
 the increase in pressure inside the eye 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.159
 the most important detail that the 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:07.830
 glaucoma is that it is a disease 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.110
 silent that's why glaucoma is 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.479
 know as the silent thief of the 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.850
 vision because because I can have the 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.670
 disease and not present any kind of 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.830
 symptoms therefore make a 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.630
 disease that being silent does not 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.790
 motivates does not take the patient to 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.790
 ophthalmologist therefore makes 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:30.380
 advancing disease causing all the 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.380
 damage without us noticing 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.759
 I have several steps of treatment 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:42.640
 in the primary step is to start 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:45.820
 use medication that will take us to 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.310
 cause a decrease in pressure 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.439
 inside the eye I upload the following 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.899
 step that optionally in some 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:55.360
 patients I can do treatments with 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:57.159
 laser if that laser treatment that 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.319
 is a palliative treatment what 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:01.810
 means what I'm buying 

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:04.060
 time in controlling the pressure of the 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:07.179
 eye my third step is going to be a 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.979
 surgical step I have many types 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:10.840
 of surgeries that I can offer to 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.940
 Patients according to the characteristic 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.670
 of the glaucoma of each of the 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.769
 patients and the stage of severity of 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.090
 glaucoma presented by each of the 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:21.970
 patients 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.129
 until you can reach the placement of 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:27.550
 devices that help me regulate the 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:30.780
 eye pressure valves such as 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.780
 lower the pressure of the eyes
