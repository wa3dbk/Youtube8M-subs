00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.230
 there is a lot going on 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.599
 Of course we are in London as we are 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.880
 big ben the londoner fans or ships 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.690
 and cars more so the presentation is 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.020
 really good 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.510
 you can now between 2d and 3d here 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.930
 views we choose the massacre on 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.369
 3-d and show you the times so 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.760
 important points are here directly 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:33.540
 marked as sourcefire human 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:36.059
 prosecutor kroder london 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:40.110
 you can just north through this 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:43.370
 you have to move around and look around 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.180
 such a plan built-in compass and 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.820
 Impressive one can, for example, too 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.860
 say okay i want to search something for 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.600
 example oxford street thinks itself some 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.180
 Below the search results are displayed and 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.809
 can then choose where to go 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.820
 are welcome to let's say this and bang 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.370
 we already hereby street on is also 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:06.090
 the apple store will be somewhere but me 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:09.180
 think you have to go here or here 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.650
 there is actually an apple somewhere 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.540
 store is not a sign but us 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.650
 can a customer card right now 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.630
 against all other countries 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.960
 and we will see a lot, too 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.280
 you can see there too 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.229
 show small text in english 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.210
 its infotexts can be found next to 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.520
 a spot of interest and better 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.880
 Show her like that again 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.880
 garden 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:50.220
 okay that is not so 1 1 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.900
 I do not know exactly where we are 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:56.490
 But there you are, you see 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.680
 presentation is actually very 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:05.190
 it was impressive somewhere 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:06.570
 what everybody knows say tabriz then so 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.380
 you know that 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:13.440
 Now you could say it up here 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:17.970
 what is the manager as the most important 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:19.830
 things to for example here goes with a small 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.130
 text you can go to weblinks or pins 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.080
 put as you want and that really 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.080
 genius I think of this app that the 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.220
 without internet connection works 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.050
 can now just in here 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.950
 Setting to activate each flight mode 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:36.840
 and back in the app the only one 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:41.489
 what is no longer possible is the search 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:43.769
 which probably needs the band contains 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:45.540
 connection to this example 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:49.200
 we can continue our interest 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:54.170
 For example, you can just search 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:03:00.780
 here olympiastadion fly is schwupps 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:03.170
 really big and why could look what 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.170
 there are 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:10.440
 the cool is that unfortunately goes only 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.500
 with the connections switch again 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.500
 on 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:18.390
 there can really see very well that 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.630
 example of this Olympic 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.760
 sports facilities that you as dates has 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:26.700
 Of course, it also works for others 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:28.700
 Venues on it and has here 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:32.519
 for example the karl index 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:34.109
 Start soon and could do that now 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:37.859
 in my calendar, that's possible 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:39.090
 sometimes also for concerts etc pp and 

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:40.440
 Overall, I just think the app 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:44.989
 really hate made we go 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.989
 once back to London 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:53.010
 downtown we say stop the 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:57.570
 travel the awo has started 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:59.130
 I have this new skyscraper that 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.660
 really impressive degree it was 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.460
 not actually see from anywhere 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.860
 Can and action on help 

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:06.710
 I'm even started as we have 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:09.720
 He is really great for free 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:10.860
 as a universal app on vacation actually 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.100
 thought very well how to get involved 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:17.720
 I would like to orientate a bit 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.720
