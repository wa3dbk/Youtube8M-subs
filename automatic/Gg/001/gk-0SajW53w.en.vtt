that you pick this up what is there is
vastly<00:05:54.840> amazing<00:05:55.840> but<00:05:56.200> there's<00:05:56.410> just<00:05:56.620> some

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:56.860 
vastly amazing but there's just some

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.010 
vastly amazing but there's just some
stuff<00:05:57.130> that's<00:05:57.280> lacking<00:05:57.580> and<00:05:58.060> so

00:05:59.010 --> 00:05:59.020 
stuff that's lacking and so

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:00.300

realistically i'm going to give the game
at<00:06:00.460> eight<00:06:00.610> and<00:06:00.820> say<00:06:01.030> that<00:06:01.180> if<00:06:01.330> they<00:06:01.510> come<00:06:01.660> up

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:01.750

at eight and say that if they come up
with<00:06:01.780> a<00:06:01.930> sequel<00:06:02.280> easily<00:06:03.280> could<00:06:03.430> be<00:06:03.520> a<00:06:03.550> 10<00:06:03.760> out

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:03.880 
with a sequel easily could be a 10 out

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:06.030 
with a sequel easily could be a 10 out
of<00:06:03.940> 10<00:06:04.000> and<00:06:04.270> i<00:06:04.330> can't<00:06:04.630> wait<00:06:04.690> for<00:06:04.930> the<00:06:04.990> sequel<00:06:05.169> so
