 hello and welcome to the double whistle channel 15 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:15.020
 today we are going to make a marble manicure 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:17.600
 water may seem complicated but it is 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.840
 very easy and the result is 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.840
 Fantastic 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:28.789
 first let's paint the base color no 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:33.649
 test paint a base color but will do 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:35.749
 the cuts on being I'm going to make a 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:38.030
 orange manicure pink 

00:00:35.749 --> 00:00:39.170
 retro so the saae is orange with 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.109
 peace 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.510
 The following tape tape is the basis of the 

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:46.339
 nails 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:49.010
 this is for when we look at the nails in the 

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:57.379
 see in this we do not get our hands all 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:01:00.109
 painted to make this manicurist 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:04.010
 Let's put some water in the water. 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:06.649
 then we will mix it with toothpick and 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:11.899
 then we will wet the nail in the mixture 

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:14.180
 This is to create a standard super tab strip 

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:19.460
 the rest of the government in this one using a 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:21.140
 test swab from the start 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.729
 for each nail 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.810
 unless you do the two nails to the 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:25.810
 same time as me 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:34.590
 be sure to use a cotton swab to 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.700
 take the varnish on sheshan before taking 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.700
 the water finger 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:45.210
 now let's reveal our nails strip 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:48.740
 glue the tape and use a cotton swab with a 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:57.710
 of acetone to remove the varnish in chief 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:02:01.080
 that should not be much are not touring 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.820
 now you just have to make another hand if the 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.400
 first time not going very well and 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:09.360
 with other varnishes and certifies 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:11.970

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.140
 It is already one marmo manicure water to
