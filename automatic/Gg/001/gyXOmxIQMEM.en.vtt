00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
right now we're gonna play it moderately

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.660 
right now we're gonna play it moderately
slow<00:02:09.290> again<00:02:09.649> so<00:02:09.830> you<00:02:09.920> can<00:02:10.070> catch<00:02:10.220> on<00:02:10.429> to<00:02:10.460> that

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
slow again so you can catch on to that

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:22.470 
slow again so you can catch on to that
rhythm

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.970 

and<00:02:22.720> then<00:02:22.870> we're<00:02:22.989> gonna<00:02:23.080> move<00:02:23.260> back<00:02:23.319> we're

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
and then we're gonna move back we're

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.770

gonna<00:02:24.040> move<00:02:24.190> back<00:02:24.459> down<00:02:24.700> to<00:02:24.879> that<00:02:24.910> LOI<00:02:25.239> again

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
gonna move back down to that LOI again

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:37.690 
gonna move back down to that LOI again
and<00:02:25.989> start<00:02:26.560> the<00:02:26.650> progression

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.289 
so remember this lesson start out slow
the<00:03:09.620> slower<00:03:10.190> you<00:03:10.400> go<00:03:10.430> the<00:03:10.580> more<00:03:10.790> you<00:03:11.180> know

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:11.299 
the slower you go the more you know

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:12.670 
the slower you go the more you know
better<00:03:11.599> at<00:03:11.720> rhythm<00:03:11.989> you're<00:03:12.110> gonna<00:03:12.200> get<00:03:12.440> and

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
better at rhythm you're gonna get and

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:13.899 
better at rhythm you're gonna get and
the<00:03:12.769> better<00:03:12.799> you're<00:03:13.069> gonna<00:03:13.129> do<00:03:13.340> the<00:03:13.459> example

00:03:13.899 --> 00:03:13.909 
the better you're gonna do the example

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:15.850 
the better you're gonna do the example
and<00:03:14.150> as<00:03:14.510> you<00:03:14.629> keep<00:03:14.810> speeding<00:03:15.140> up<00:03:15.379> you<00:03:15.530> can<00:03:15.680> keep

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
and as you keep speeding up you can keep

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.410 
and as you keep speeding up you can keep
adding<00:03:16.099> any<00:03:16.400> more<00:03:16.430> things<00:03:16.730> or<00:03:17.030> just<00:03:17.090> in<00:03:17.360> a

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
adding any more things or just in a

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.390 
adding any more things or just in a
sense<00:03:17.569> playing<00:03:17.840> it<00:03:17.930> faster<00:03:18.290> and<00:03:18.470> pretty<00:03:19.280> much

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
sense playing it faster and pretty much

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.460 
sense playing it faster and pretty much
play<00:03:19.610> them<00:03:19.730> differently<00:03:20.090> so<00:03:20.659> I'm<00:03:21.140> gonna<00:03:21.290> play

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
play them differently so I'm gonna play

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.410 
play them differently so I'm gonna play
an<00:03:21.530> example<00:03:21.920> for<00:03:22.069> you<00:03:22.250> a<00:03:22.459> little<00:03:22.790> bit<00:03:23.000> sped<00:03:23.269> up

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
an example for you a little bit sped up

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.030 
an example for you a little bit sped up
and<00:03:23.660> with<00:03:23.930> a<00:03:23.959> little<00:03:24.080> bit<00:03:24.200> of<00:03:24.349> combo<00:03:24.620> change<00:03:24.890> to

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
and with a little bit of combo change to

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.440 
and with a little bit of combo change to
so<00:03:25.129> you<00:03:25.220> can<00:03:25.310> actually<00:03:25.430> hear<00:03:25.730> how<00:03:25.910> it<00:03:26.060> sounds

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
so you can actually hear how it sounds

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.700 
so you can actually hear how it sounds
with<00:03:27.170> other<00:03:27.379> notation<00:03:27.830> involved<00:03:28.220> too

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:28.710 
with other notation involved too

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:47.509

and<00:03:48.519> remember<00:03:48.909> that<00:03:49.299> whole<00:03:49.480> riff<00:03:49.629> I<00:03:49.780> just<00:03:50.019> did

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
and remember that whole riff I just did

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.440 
and remember that whole riff I just did
is<00:03:50.290> pretty<00:03:50.560> much<00:03:50.680> based<00:03:50.920> around<00:03:51.340> the<00:03:51.999> E<00:03:52.030> and

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
is pretty much based around the E and

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.059 
is pretty much based around the E and
the<00:03:52.629> a<00:03:52.659> progression<00:03:53.109> that<00:03:53.349> we<00:03:53.439> were<00:03:53.590> doing<00:03:53.739> so

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:54.069 
the a progression that we were doing so

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:55.619 
the a progression that we were doing so
at<00:03:54.159> the<00:03:54.219> same<00:03:54.400> time<00:03:54.579> I<00:03:54.609> just<00:03:54.849> keep<00:03:55.030> playing

00:03:55.619 --> 00:03:55.629 
at the same time I just keep playing

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:57.420 
at the same time I just keep playing
that<00:03:55.719> new<00:03:55.930> riff<00:03:56.170> what<00:03:56.680> I<00:03:56.709> do<00:03:56.829> is<00:03:57.010> just<00:03:57.159> move<00:03:57.310> it

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
that new riff what I do is just move it

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:58.709 
that new riff what I do is just move it
up<00:03:57.489> to<00:03:57.549> the<00:03:57.700> a<00:03:57.730> string<00:03:58.060> it's<00:03:58.209> the<00:03:58.269> same<00:03:58.450> thing

00:03:58.709 --> 00:03:58.719 
up to the a string it's the same thing

00:03:58.719 --> 00:04:02.190 
up to the a string it's the same thing
very<00:03:59.170> simple<00:04:00.269> very<00:04:01.269> good<00:04:01.599> system<00:04:01.959> you<00:04:02.079> can
