00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
so what makes the an-94 so different and

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.340 
so what makes the an-94 so different and
why<00:00:59.520> are<00:00:59.670> so<00:00:59.850> many<00:00:59.970> people<00:01:00.090> wanting<00:01:01.020> it<00:01:01.110> back

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
why are so many people wanting it back

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.039 
why are so many people wanting it back
in<00:01:01.530> battlefield<00:01:02.100> 4<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.910> secret<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.600> an-94

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
in battlefield 4 the secret to the an-94

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.770 
in battlefield 4 the secret to the an-94
is<00:01:04.769> in<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.190> very<00:01:05.489> bottom<00:01:05.940> left<00:01:06.360> hand<00:01:06.480> corner

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
is in the very bottom left hand corner

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.560 
is in the very bottom left hand corner
of<00:01:07.170> your<00:01:07.290> screen<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:08.250> it's<00:01:09.030> where<00:01:09.240> it<00:01:09.360> says

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
of your screen and it's where it says

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.880 
of your screen and it's where it says
burst<00:01:11.390> 1200<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.750> that's<00:01:13.080> because<00:01:13.320> this<00:01:13.680> is<00:01:13.860> a

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
burst 1200 and that's because this is a

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.640 
burst 1200 and that's because this is a
burst<00:01:14.280> fire<00:01:14.610> good<00:01:14.970> every<00:01:15.780> time<00:01:15.960> you<00:01:16.230> pull<00:01:16.470> the

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
burst fire good every time you pull the

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.240 
burst fire good every time you pull the
trigger<00:01:16.950> it<00:01:17.250> fires<00:01:17.760> two<00:01:18.240> shots<00:01:18.270> not<00:01:18.900> one<00:01:19.230> so<00:01:20.100> if

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
trigger it fires two shots not one so if

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.820 
trigger it fires two shots not one so if
you<00:01:20.430> watch<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.880> ammo<00:01:21.210> count<00:01:21.480> here<00:01:21.840> it's<00:01:22.290> going

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
you watch the ammo count here it's going

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.120 
you watch the ammo count here it's going
down<00:01:23.010> by<00:01:23.280> two<00:01:23.360> every<00:01:24.360> time<00:01:24.740> now<00:01:25.740> i'm<00:01:26.070> using

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
down by two every time now i'm using

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.120 
down by two every time now i'm using
this<00:01:26.670> gun<00:01:26.880> in<00:01:27.210> burst<00:01:27.510> fire<00:01:27.810> mode<00:01:27.840> you<00:01:28.560> can<00:01:28.590> use

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
this gun in burst fire mode you can use

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.490 
this gun in burst fire mode you can use
it<00:01:29.280> in<00:01:29.400> full<00:01:29.640> auto<00:01:29.820> mode<00:01:30.090> but<00:01:31.050> that's<00:01:31.170> really

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
it in full auto mode but that's really

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.660 
it in full auto mode but that's really
not<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.950> an-94<00:01:32.729> strong<00:01:33.510> point<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:34.280> 94<00:01:35.280> strong

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
not the an-94 strong point a 94 strong

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.300 
not the an-94 strong point a 94 strong
point<00:01:35.970> is<00:01:36.210> staying<00:01:37.050> in<00:01:37.470> burst<00:01:37.860> fire<00:01:38.159> mode

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
point is staying in burst fire mode

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.270 
point is staying in burst fire mode
where<00:01:39.210> effectively<00:01:39.510> it's<00:01:40.140> a<00:01:40.320> semi-automatic

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
where effectively it's a semi-automatic

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.940 
where effectively it's a semi-automatic
that<00:01:42.120> fires<00:01:42.390> two<00:01:42.750> bullets<00:01:43.170> at<00:01:43.320> a<00:01:43.409> time<00:01:43.710> and

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
that fires two bullets at a time and

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.149 
that fires two bullets at a time and
they're<00:01:44.610> both<00:01:44.909> gonna<00:01:45.180> hit<00:01:45.890> now<00:01:46.890> I<00:01:46.920> haven't

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
they're both gonna hit now I haven't

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.460 
they're both gonna hit now I haven't
used<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.549> an-94<00:01:48.060> in<00:01:48.479> a<00:01:48.570> long<00:01:48.780> time<00:01:49.020> in<00:01:49.320> fact

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
used the an-94 in a long time in fact

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.140 
used the an-94 in a long time in fact
hadn't<00:01:49.740> played<00:01:49.890> battlefield<00:01:50.310> 3<00:01:50.820> in<00:01:50.880> a<00:01:50.970> long

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.150 
hadn't played battlefield 3 in a long

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.149 
hadn't played battlefield 3 in a long
time<00:01:51.330> I<00:01:51.540> had<00:01:51.690> to<00:01:51.810> reinstall<00:01:52.140> it<00:01:52.440> really<00:01:53.010> just

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
time I had to reinstall it really just

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.880 
time I had to reinstall it really just
all<00:01:53.370> my<00:01:53.549> sensitivity<00:01:54.140> so<00:01:55.140> it<00:01:55.229> took<00:01:55.380> me<00:01:55.560> a<00:01:55.590> few

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
all my sensitivity so it took me a few

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.830 
all my sensitivity so it took me a few
rounds<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.460> get<00:01:56.549> back<00:01:56.909> into<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.330> swing<00:01:57.570> of<00:01:57.659> it

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
rounds to get back into the swing of it

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.440 
rounds to get back into the swing of it
but<00:01:58.590> once<00:01:58.920> you<00:01:59.100> remember<00:01:59.610> how<00:01:59.820> to<00:01:59.880> use<00:02:00.270> the

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
but once you remember how to use the

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.399 
but once you remember how to use the
an-94<00:02:01.400> it's<00:02:02.400> really<00:02:02.880> effective<00:02:03.630> if<00:02:04.020> you're

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
an-94 it's really effective if you're

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.070 
an-94 it's really effective if you're
patient<00:02:04.799> let<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:05.820> gun<00:02:06.090> settle<00:02:06.600> once<00:02:06.869> you

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
patient let the gun settle once you

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.649 
patient let the gun settle once you
fired<00:02:07.440> a<00:02:07.619> shot<00:02:07.860> then<00:02:08.729> it's<00:02:08.939> incredibly

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:09.659 
fired a shot then it's incredibly

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:12.080 
fired a shot then it's incredibly
accurate<00:02:09.959> and<00:02:10.560> it<00:02:10.889> does<00:02:11.159> a<00:02:11.189> lot<00:02:11.430> of<00:02:11.489> damage

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
accurate and it does a lot of damage

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.619 
accurate and it does a lot of damage
even<00:02:12.840> at<00:02:12.930> ranges<00:02:13.440> you<00:02:14.340> can<00:02:14.550> pick<00:02:14.819> off<00:02:15.030> targets

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
even at ranges you can pick off targets

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:18.320 
even at ranges you can pick off targets
really<00:02:16.319> easily<00:02:16.739> because<00:02:17.370> one<00:02:17.610> accurate<00:02:18.090> shot

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
really easily because one accurate shot

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.380 
really easily because one accurate shot
with<00:02:18.750> the<00:02:18.840> an-94<00:02:19.379> is<00:02:19.980> actually<00:02:20.550> two<00:02:20.879> accurate

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
with the an-94 is actually two accurate

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.809 
with the an-94 is actually two accurate
shots<00:02:21.660> so<00:02:22.410> what<00:02:22.560> you<00:02:22.739> end<00:02:22.890> up<00:02:23.010> with<00:02:23.069> is<00:02:23.519> a<00:02:23.550> gun

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
shots so what you end up with is a gun

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:27.380 
shots so what you end up with is a gun
does<00:02:24.180> 50<00:02:24.720> damage<00:02:24.900> close-up<00:02:25.680> and<00:02:25.830> 36<00:02:26.819> damage<00:02:27.239> at

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
does 50 damage close-up and 36 damage at

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.830 
does 50 damage close-up and 36 damage at
range<00:02:27.440> so<00:02:28.440> three<00:02:29.310> good<00:02:29.580> shots<00:02:29.610> of<00:02:30.180> range<00:02:30.540> is

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
range so three good shots of range is

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.710 
range so three good shots of range is
going<00:02:31.230> to<00:02:31.319> take<00:02:31.530> somebody<00:02:31.799> down<00:02:32.510> in<00:02:33.510> these

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
going to take somebody down in these

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.680 
going to take somebody down in these

seem<00:02:45.000> a<00:02:45.030> bit<00:02:45.120> odd<00:02:45.450> to<00:02:45.480> battlefield<00:02:46.200> 4<00:02:46.530> players

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
seem a bit odd to battlefield 4 players

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.180 
seem a bit odd to battlefield 4 players
but<00:02:47.730> to<00:02:47.880> battlefield<00:02:48.420> 3<00:02:48.750> players<00:02:49.079> the<00:02:49.620> bipod

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
but to battlefield 3 players the bipod

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.460 
but to battlefield 3 players the bipod
was<00:02:50.430> an<00:02:50.610> accessory<00:02:51.000> that<00:02:51.329> was<00:02:51.750> very<00:02:52.110> popular

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
was an accessory that was very popular

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.430 
was an accessory that was very popular

effective<00:03:00.810> now<00:03:01.530> here<00:03:01.799> about<00:03:02.099> to<00:03:02.280> get<00:03:02.400> into<00:03:02.610> a
