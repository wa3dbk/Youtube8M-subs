00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.520
 when you see a lot of water from the front it is good to be with the reflexes in 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.449
 its strong on the road 

00:00:09.449 --> 00:00:10.799
 the track gets wet 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:13.799
 the way of colleagues 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:18.779
 something that can make this situation even more dramatic by almeida guarda 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:25.449
 paulo sometimes it rains so much that even during the day going slowly with the 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:26.529
 headlights on 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:30.099
 The feeling we have is that we do not see each other. 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.060
 intended for car with the lights off 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.340
 in the truck capable of further complicating the driver's vision 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.990
 the former mayor of water who defined his tender 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.990
 what to do before 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.680
 first, the driver must reduce the speed 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.680
 also maintain a safe distance from the 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.499
 low headlights because high light 

00:01:00.499 --> 00:01:02.580
 but the changes were no different 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.580
 this further decreases visibility 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.210
 there is a weapon 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.119
 the fine is wrong for drivers to walk with the warning flash on 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:14.680
 that confusion increases 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.240
 Thirty driving can not distinguish who is on the move 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.280
 tries to stop walking with a lethality 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.010
 but 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:30.420
 there are a lot of people do 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.600
 and the car is stopped at the side of the road 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.880
 and so stated 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.880
 parked car 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.510
 in front of other vehicles 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.300
 It's worth another defeat in periods like this that you can identify 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.480
 the rain will not be strong I do not know where to expect rain 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.480
 during the rain I just stopped the car in the restaurant-bar of a 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.960
 fuel a police base 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.930
 do not need to clear the trip just because of the rain but also do not have 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:07.080
 end 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.300
 so hurry to get there
