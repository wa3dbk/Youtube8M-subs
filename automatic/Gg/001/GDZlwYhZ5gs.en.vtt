00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:11.300 
right-hand side and select the import so

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:14.079 
right-hand side and select the import so
you<00:06:11.749> do<00:06:11.930> want<00:06:12.139> to<00:06:12.199> import<00:06:12.589> it<00:06:12.800> and<00:06:13.430> then<00:06:13.939> it'll

00:06:14.079 --> 00:06:14.089 
you do want to import it and then it'll

00:06:14.089 --> 00:06:17.519 
you do want to import it and then it'll
take<00:06:14.360> just<00:06:14.899> a<00:06:14.960> couple<00:06:15.080> seconds<00:06:15.649> to<00:06:15.680> import<00:06:16.219> it

take just a couple seconds to import it

00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:25.530 
take just a couple seconds to import it
and<00:06:18.529> then<00:06:19.399> now<00:06:19.520> we<00:06:19.580> can<00:06:19.699> back<00:06:20.029> out<00:06:20.270> of<00:06:20.539> it

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:25.540

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:49.550 
you can see I've got a some other rides

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:52.210 
you can see I've got a some other rides
here<00:06:49.880> that<00:06:50.150> would<00:06:50.509> -<00:06:50.690> that<00:06:50.720> would<00:06:51.229> take<00:06:51.259> on<00:06:52.160> a

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:52.220 
here that would - that would take on a

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:54.640 
here that would - that would take on a
regular<00:06:52.639> basis<00:06:53.090> so<00:06:53.270> down<00:06:53.930> here<00:06:54.110> at<00:06:54.169> the<00:06:54.320> bottom

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:54.650 
regular basis so down here at the bottom

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:57.730 
regular basis so down here at the bottom
is<00:06:54.770> the<00:06:54.919> test<00:06:55.190> ride<00:06:55.460> plan<00:06:56.350> so<00:06:57.350> you<00:06:57.440> can<00:06:57.560> select

00:06:57.730 --> 00:06:57.740 
is the test ride plan so you can select

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:01.719 
is the test ride plan so you can select
it<00:06:58.190> and<00:06:59.320> then<00:07:00.320> from<00:07:00.680> here<00:07:00.710> you<00:07:00.979> just<00:07:01.280> hit<00:07:01.430> start

00:07:01.719 --> 00:07:01.729 
it and then from here you just hit start

00:07:01.729 --> 00:07:03.490 
it and then from here you just hit start
you<00:07:02.300> don't<00:07:02.479> need<00:07:02.660> to<00:07:02.750> choose<00:07:03.020> any<00:07:03.260> one<00:07:03.470> of

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:03.500 
you don't need to choose any one of

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:05.290 
you don't need to choose any one of
these<00:07:03.650> other<00:07:03.860> waypoints<00:07:04.490> unless<00:07:04.729> you<00:07:04.910> want<00:07:05.210> to

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:05.300 
these other waypoints unless you want to

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.960 
these other waypoints unless you want to
go<00:07:05.600> to<00:07:05.660> one<00:07:06.169> of<00:07:06.260> these<00:07:06.320> waypoints<00:07:06.590> direct<00:07:07.310> say

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:07.970 
go to one of these waypoints direct say

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:09.460 
go to one of these waypoints direct say
you<00:07:08.030> didn't<00:07:08.389> want<00:07:08.419> to<00:07:08.600> do<00:07:08.750> the<00:07:08.900> first<00:07:09.050> half<00:07:09.380> of

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:09.470 
you didn't want to do the first half of

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:10.659 
you didn't want to do the first half of
the<00:07:09.560> ride<00:07:09.740> and<00:07:09.979> you<00:07:10.039> just<00:07:10.190> want<00:07:10.400> to<00:07:10.460> go<00:07:10.639> to

00:07:10.659 --> 00:07:10.669 
the ride and you just want to go to

00:07:10.669 --> 00:07:13.029 
the ride and you just want to go to
Waypoint<00:07:11.210> 3<00:07:11.479> you<00:07:11.780> could<00:07:11.930> select<00:07:12.139> that<00:07:12.410> and<00:07:12.800> it

00:07:13.029 --> 00:07:13.039 
Waypoint 3 you could select that and it

00:07:13.039 --> 00:07:14.860 
Waypoint 3 you could select that and it
would<00:07:13.220> take<00:07:13.669> you<00:07:13.820> there<00:07:14.030> and<00:07:14.150> start<00:07:14.479> you<00:07:14.630> there

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:14.870 
would take you there and start you there

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:17.950 
would take you there and start you there
so<00:07:15.680> if<00:07:15.860> you<00:07:15.979> go<00:07:16.130> to<00:07:16.160> the<00:07:16.400> start<00:07:16.699> it'll<00:07:17.479> begin<00:07:17.690> to

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:17.960 
so if you go to the start it'll begin to

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:19.870 
so if you go to the start it'll begin to
calculate<00:07:18.169> your<00:07:18.710> route<00:07:18.919> right<00:07:19.190> here<00:07:19.490> being

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:19.880 
calculate your route right here being

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:24.400 
calculate your route right here being
calculated<00:07:21.280> you<00:07:22.280> can<00:07:22.490> choose<00:07:22.960> how<00:07:23.960> you<00:07:23.990> want

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:24.410 
calculated you can choose how you want

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:26.439 
calculated you can choose how you want
to<00:07:24.440> take<00:07:24.680> the<00:07:24.830> route<00:07:25.039> in<00:07:25.490> the<00:07:25.610> calculation

00:07:26.439 --> 00:07:26.449 
to take the route in the calculation

00:07:26.449 --> 00:07:28.960 
to take the route in the calculation
mode<00:07:26.660> which<00:07:27.590> most<00:07:27.860> of<00:07:28.039> mine<00:07:28.220> I<00:07:28.250> keep<00:07:28.760> on

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:28.970 
mode which most of mine I keep on

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:32.500 
mode which most of mine I keep on
twisties<00:07:29.840> so<00:07:30.800> that<00:07:31.130> if<00:07:31.250> if<00:07:31.550> you're<00:07:31.880> just<00:07:32.090> one

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:32.510 
twisties so that if if you're just one

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:34.570 
twisties so that if if you're just one
to<00:07:32.630> get<00:07:32.750> from<00:07:32.900> point<00:07:33.110> A<00:07:33.260> to<00:07:33.289> point<00:07:33.440> B<00:07:33.770> the

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:34.580 
to get from point A to point B the

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:36.670 
to get from point A to point B the
fastest<00:07:35.030> way<00:07:35.210> but<00:07:35.510> kind<00:07:35.990> of<00:07:36.050> take<00:07:36.289> you<00:07:36.560> know

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:36.680 
fastest way but kind of take you know

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.520 
fastest way but kind of take you know
your<00:07:36.889> own<00:07:37.010> route<00:07:37.310> then<00:07:37.669> you<00:07:37.910> can<00:07:38.090> choose<00:07:38.530> you

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:39.530 
your own route then you can choose you

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:41.770 
your own route then you can choose you
can<00:07:39.590> choose<00:07:39.710> fastest<00:07:40.490> or<00:07:40.820> shortest<00:07:40.849> or

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:41.780 
can choose fastest or shortest or

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:43.480 
can choose fastest or shortest or
whatever<00:07:42.110> so<00:07:42.409> if<00:07:42.470> you<00:07:42.560> choose<00:07:42.740> fastest<00:07:43.310> and

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:43.490 
whatever so if you choose fastest and

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:44.589 
whatever so if you choose fastest and
then<00:07:43.580> you<00:07:43.669> back<00:07:43.849> out<00:07:44.060> of<00:07:44.090> that<00:07:44.240> it<00:07:44.479> will

00:07:44.589 --> 00:07:44.599 
then you back out of that it will

00:07:44.599 --> 00:07:48.070 
then you back out of that it will
recalculate<00:07:44.960> your<00:07:45.440> route<00:07:46.750> the<00:07:47.750> route<00:07:47.900> is

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:48.080 
recalculate your route the route is

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:50.570 
recalculate your route the route is
being<00:07:48.260> calculated

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:50.580 
being calculated

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:54.080 
being calculated
and<00:07:51.090> you<00:07:51.180> just<00:07:51.330> click<00:07:51.569> go<00:07:51.780> and<00:07:52.819> it<00:07:53.819> will<00:07:53.940> bring

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:54.090 
and you just click go and it will bring

00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:57.230 
and you just click go and it will bring
up<00:07:54.240> your<00:07:54.300> route<00:07:54.629> and<00:07:55.699> then<00:07:56.699> tell<00:07:56.970> you<00:07:57.060> where<00:07:57.180> to

00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:57.240 
up your route and then tell you where to

00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:00.560 
up your route and then tell you where to
go<00:07:57.360> and<00:07:57.660> that's<00:07:58.319> it
