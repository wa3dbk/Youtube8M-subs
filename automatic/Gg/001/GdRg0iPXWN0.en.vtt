00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.860
Did you know that a new earth has been found?

00:00:03.357 --> 00:00:05.357
Its the elder cousin of our Earth

00:00:05.782 --> 00:00:07.782
It looks like our one

00:00:07.782 --> 00:00:12.482
just a little bigger than us

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.160
Lets find out about our new cousin

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.900
Nasa has announced recently that they found a new Earth

00:00:26.902 --> 00:00:28.602
Its basically a new Planet

00:00:29.058 --> 00:00:31.058
Which is apparently not in our solar system

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.320
Its in a different galaxy

00:00:34.806 --> 00:00:36.806
The name of the planet is Kepler452B

00:00:37.036 --> 00:00:39.956
They discovered this planet through their Kepler Telescope

00:00:39.975 --> 00:00:45.435
FIY, Nasa's Kepler mission is a 600 Million Dollar Project

00:00:46.078 --> 00:00:56.398
and it tries to find the exoplanet around the universe.

00:00:56.398 --> 00:00:58.276
to find out the habitable planet in our Milky Way

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.160

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.740
And this new planet almost looks like our own earth and its in the habitable zone

00:01:06.155 --> 00:01:07.919
Habitable zone means a position where the planet

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.952
will have its best placement to get the perfect sun light

00:01:10.952 --> 00:01:13.632
from its own star which will help to evolve life in that planet like our Earth.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:23.080
As an example, our Earth in in the habitable zone of our planet

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:30.280
Its the distance between the Sun and Earth that made possible our plant to have lives

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:37.780
All these days all the planets we discovered

00:01:37.926 --> 00:01:39.926
around us, all like mars, jupiters etc, all these planets

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.260
all of them are not in the habitable zone. Some of them

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:46.750
are rocky, red planet, excessive hot or cold

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:52.100
some with higher gravity or some is too close too sun or having bad atmosphere

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.900
Means, there is no way to form life in those planets

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.320
There is no water. But this time what NASA found is amazing

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.760
Its really far away from our Solar System but its actually

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.440
But its in the habitable zone of its own galazy

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.560
Means, it has earth like features

00:02:11.042 --> 00:02:13.042
Its not gonna be too hot or too warm may be.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.080
The distance is quite good!

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.960
Good enough to have life formed already

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:28.800
Any kind of biological thing can exist there according to scientists

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.120
It might have atmosphere and water formed in there as well

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:49.520
This Kepler452B is orbiting Cygnus

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:56.720
Its kinda 1400 Light years far away from earth!

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:02.960
But the exciting thing is,  since it is in the habitable zone so its so certain that life could have formed there

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.480
The planet is 6 Billion Years old

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.880
And its 60% bigger than our Earth

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:18.880
So for this reason, scientists are calling this planet the cousin of Earth :D

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.920
Scientists are predicting that there is an atmosphere in this planet already

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.040
They are not 100% sure about it but its likely to be

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.160
But since its in the habitable zone, so its very normal to have an atmosphere and water

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:38.160
..and also life has fomred here may be

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.200
may humans like us are there!

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:41.680

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.920
may be some sort of Alients are there!

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:56.400
Even this planet is really far away from us, like 1400 light years

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:06.720
But scientists are confirmed about its earth like features and the existence of this planet

00:04:06.868 --> 00:04:08.868
May be its just the matter of time and technology to have so that we know

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:18.120
But all the evidence pointing towards another habitable planet

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:25.220
I bet there is Oxygen and Water in that planet....

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.620
And where there is water there is life

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:45.340
and the planet is 1.5 Billion years older than earth so it had enough time to form life

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:53.020
Scientists are guessing about lives their

00:04:53.020 --> 00:05:26.760
It rotates its Star in 385 days just like earth does in 365 days

00:05:27.089 --> 00:05:34.969
There could be earth-like season even!

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:49.689
it might not be too cold or too hot

00:05:49.689 --> 00:06:02.649
The gravity of this planet is a bit more powerful than earth as its 60% bigger than our earth

00:06:02.649 --> 00:06:16.389
All the images you have seen here are not really the image of this planet rather they are artists' assumption

00:06:16.389 --> 00:06:27.909
So what you guys think about this planet? You think there is life in there? Wanna see more about it?
