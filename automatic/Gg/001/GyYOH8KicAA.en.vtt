00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 we this first weekend 

00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:06.660
 summer with flavor and smell of storms 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.059
 storms that actually come back to 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.559
 repeated intensify besides face 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.330
 tomorrow see how we hope that that 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.490
 instability is transferred to many 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.960
 points of the country to the north third with 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.150
 storm especially facing the second 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.160
 half of the day appearing in great 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.710
 part the interior of the peninsular east in 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.240
 Pyrenean areas with showers that 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.420
 end of the day would also run strength to 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.849
 the central area of the peninsula and while 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.349
 we start week with storms today 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.510
 we have also returned to the storm 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.030
 I hope however that has not prevented the 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.129
 that many Spaniards will approach 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.920
 our coasts to take the first 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.989
 Summer dip very good night 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.000
 we leave behind this first end of 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.829
 week the summer characterized by 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.230
 storms or storms that by the way 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.570
 they will go to further intensify further in 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.699
 the next few days we continue under the 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.469
 influence of that air pocketing 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.469
 cold in the middle layers that also 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.719
 appreciates pretty well to the west of 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.059
 the peninsula and that sends those bands of 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.860
 instability and form those showers 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.040
 storms that have come back again 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.600
 in many regions 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.330
 especially today from the peninsular east 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.340
 besides abundant cloudiness even and 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.110
 began to affect if more has remained 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.220
 below 25 hours between 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.410
 others, by the way, that continue 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.030
 descending the next days now what 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.040
 we see for the moment for tomorrow we start 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.560
 common week has stability and is that 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.479
 these storms are going to move to 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.370
 other points of the peninsula we hope 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:29.680
 that are intense in the afternoon on 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:32.080
 all in mountainous areas of the third 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.850
 north towards navarra alto ebro in good 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.560
 part about Iberian in zaragoza in 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.910
 teruel interior of story of the 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.590
 Valencian community and with some 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:40.750
 squall that could reach the end 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.610
 of the day the central zone community of 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.250
 madrid and also in the morning that 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.990
 disturbance would leave some 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.869
 precipitation even with storms 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.460
 towards huelva or badajoz with predominance of 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:53.110
 sun in both archipelagos and 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.509
 temperatures that face tomorrow just 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:58.600
 they will vary, we will continue with values ​​in 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:00.490
 general soft in the northern half and not 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.750
 excessively hot in the rest of 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.390
 the region is that every Tuesday is in 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.250
 stability becomes more pronounced and that is 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.009
 we hope that the precipitations are 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.230
 more evident in much of the country with 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.580
 storms in an intense especially 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.530
 into the eastern peninsula 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.480
 adios pirenaicas north navarra north of 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.360
 Huesca with temperatures that on Tuesday 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.890
 they descend attention noticeably in 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.020
 many regions of spain and on wednesday 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.000
 little by little, that 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.310
 situation as just some squall 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.690
 residual that may be isolated in 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.900
 mountainous areas of the interior of the 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.900
 peninsula 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.860
 sit on a sun terrace go out to 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.480
 play a park do sports are 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.280
 very pleasant activities when it arrives 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.890
 the good weather but we should have 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.660
 always present that the sun's rays 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.190
 can cause significant damage to 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.410
 short and long term in our skin 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:52.280
 that's why there is a word that never 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:54.380
 we must forget prevention also by 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.970
 did you know that the phototype is 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.980
 prototype tells us the ural capacity 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.080
 that has our skin to assimilate the 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.820
 solar radiation the lower the 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.280
 whitest phototype is the skin and for 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.960
 both have a greater tendency to burn 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.520
 but this does not mean that a phototype 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:10.040
 elevated ie a brown skin or 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.810
 Tanned should stop protection from 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.660
 sun sun protection experts 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.520
 They know how important it is to protect 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.010
 the skin from ultraviolet rays to 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.360
 any age and especially as in 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.900
 the first years of life when the 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:27.170
 you have even more sensitive why we should 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.940
 become aware that the sun always 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.650
 it always damages the cells of our skin 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.660
 and we have to protect it from there that is 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.530
 necessary to know for example the degree 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.270
 of incidence of radiation 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.580
 ultraviolet in the area that we are going to 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:39.170
 expose us to the sun for example look at 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.710
 this tablet incidence that we have in 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.630
 the day 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:44.360
 today is how you can check even 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.560
 extremely high that risk that's why 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.840
 makes ultraviolet rays in 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.580
 practically the whole country is why 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.070
 that we have to be more careful with the 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:54.620
 sun and take care here in these areas creams 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:56.810
 of high protection but so important 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.480
 how to know these indexes is to count 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.430
 as not with the best allies for that 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.470
 this summer nor ideas have eternal 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:06.530
 partner of our best moments 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:09.350
 the sun returns to innovate to offer us 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:11.480
 the new line or ideas have protect and 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:13.940
 cool that in addition to the effective 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.040
 sunscreen always now we 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:18.020
 offers an amazing experience 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:20.270
 refreshing on the skin to help us 

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:22.490
 Enjoy even more of our moments 

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:25.100
 to the sun its three formats with textures 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:27.080
 very light in spray in milk and in haze 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.840
 solar will make the application time 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:32.630
 be a blow of freshness and relief in front 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.520
 at high temperatures 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.890
 all with the peace of mind that 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.470
 Our skin is in the hands of the leader 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:43.810
 world in sun protection and brand 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.810
 expert in skin care 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:50.139
 continue the most intense storms and 

00:04:48.339 --> 00:04:52.900
 distributed in many points of the 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:54.909
 Peninsula and temperatures still falling 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.960
 especially for the Tuesday that happens in 

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:57.960
 a very good area
