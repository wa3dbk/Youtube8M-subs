over<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:23.009> our<00:01:24.500> file<00:01:25.500> here<00:01:26.150> okay<00:01:27.150> we'll<00:01:27.630> start

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
over to our file here okay we'll start

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.999 
over to our file here okay we'll start
with<00:01:28.080> positioning<00:01:28.790> position<00:01:29.790> absolute

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
with positioning position absolute

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:35.480 
with positioning position absolute
saying<00:01:32.009> snap<00:01:32.640> it<00:01:32.850> out<00:01:33.000> of<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.479> body<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.490> we

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
saying snap it out of the body and we

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:42.760 
saying snap it out of the body and we
will<00:01:35.610> go<00:01:35.759> top<00:01:37.790> 50%<00:01:38.790> and<00:01:39.829> left<00:01:40.829> fifty<00:01:41.600> percent

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
will go top 50% and left fifty percent

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.850 
will go top 50% and left fifty percent
so<00:01:43.770> will<00:01:44.040> our<00:01:44.310> zoom<00:01:44.850> will<00:01:45.210> save<00:01:45.540> it<00:01:45.619> back<00:01:46.619> to

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
so will our zoom will save it back to

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.550 
so will our zoom will save it back to

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
to our file and we will go margin top-

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:09.169 
to our file and we will go margin top-
250px<00:02:04.710> for<00:02:05.299> half<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.659> UM<00:02:07.550> half<00:02:08.550> height<00:02:08.849> and

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
250px for half the UM half height and

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.309 
250px for half the UM half height and
we'll<00:02:09.869> go<00:02:09.959> march<00:02:10.229> in<00:02:10.970> left-<00:02:11.970> 250px<00:02:12.870> for<00:02:13.170> half

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
we'll go march in left- 250px for half

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:14.080 
we'll go march in left- 250px for half
the<00:02:13.470> width

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
the width

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.260 
the width
so<00:02:15.090> there's<00:02:15.360> looks<00:02:15.690> like<00:02:16.580> we<00:02:17.580> will<00:02:17.700> zoom<00:02:17.760> out

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
so there's looks like we will zoom out

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.150 
so there's looks like we will zoom out
and<00:02:18.720> then<00:02:19.020> we<00:02:19.140> will<00:02:19.200> go<00:02:19.260> back<00:02:19.350> to<00:02:19.500> web<00:02:19.680> page<00:02:19.890> and
