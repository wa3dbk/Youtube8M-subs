 he was an interplanetary superhero who 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.550
 quickly climbed the ranks 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.219
 television to become the 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.230
 host of his own show but the 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.510
 triumph disappeared almost as fast as 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.250
 he came forcing the superhero to fend 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.039
 of all his powers just to 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.619
 survive those hard times he 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.019

 intergalactic fighter the ghost of 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.540

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.250
 those power bands the ghost of 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.079
 space would be as helpless as a 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.360
 puppy but nobody took his 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.969
 bands and for years kept order in 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.219
 the whole universe the ghost of space 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.079
 he did his job too well and already 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.320
 there were no evil villains to defeat 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.210
 the 'rating' started to go down once 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.210
 forced me to escape from prison alone 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.219
 to catch me again reduces me 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.830
 shot with his power bands and I had 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.980
 what to do was desperate 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.630
 I am very picky viewers not 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.460
 they wanted to see the ghost of space 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.190
 defeat the same criminals one and 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.260
 again and they stopped watching the program the 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.780
 cable television was important with 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.520
 all those channels people preferred to see 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.920
 the channel of the dancing hen that my 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.200

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.420

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.100
 of your home as a result of so little 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.530
 exercise and a cookie- based diet 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.660
 cheese and vanilla ice cream increased 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.910

 superhero he is looking for work or actor 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:41.670
 but there was no place in the show for 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.380
 a fat concapate attempt confirms in the 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.110
 musical but he was not given the role 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.940
 because he weighed more than the entire cast of 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.770
 from then on he only got jobs 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.170
 mediocre that barely paid to pay 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.700

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.550
 once kept order in the galaxy 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.450

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.340
 ghost of unemployed space and 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.470
 depressed the space ghost had 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.700
 a huge debt that he accumulated as 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.370
 result of your addiction 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.950

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.380
 number 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.600
 instead of trying to rid the world 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.280
 of crime and betrayal the ghost of 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.500
 space stayed at home to 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.120
 converse with those crazy ridiculous up 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.560
 I tried to send him little jobs how to get off 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.390
 a cat from a tree but it's no longer 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:36.180
 it mattered nothing and I really worried 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.980
 or the lowest point of his career the 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.350
 ghost of space had come to the 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.180
 bottom of his misery he saw himself packing 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:45.700
 bags in the supermarket 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.109
 I did not find converse not with my rocks 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.969
 I knew that things had come 

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:51.370
 too far when they started to 

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:54.010
 answering me there was when fate 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.390
 he called only on the phone was a person 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.069
 of a new television channel that 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.000
 shows only cartons wanted it to be 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:59.709
 host of the show 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.420
 I said very funny ride I already know that the 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.620
 study on the phone is not good 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.510
 play tricks on superheroes 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.400
 unemployed I still have my bands 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.170
 of power do not risk me like noodles 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.000
 but anyway they kept calling and 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.980
 I finally decided to meet them I had no 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.659
 nothing to lose and with this the ghost 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.760
 of space got a new career 

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:17.379
 as host of the ghost program of 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.879
 space from coast to coast 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:20.739
 cartoon network executives 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:22.239
 they caught two of their archenemies and 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:24.459
 they put them to work with him 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:26.859
 they made an offer that they can not refuse 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:29.049
 I did not work with the ghost of space 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:33.400
 or I went to the supermarket with bags 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:35.859
 I asked if at least one company in 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.810
 a car the space ghost never 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:39.700
 he looked better he lost almost all the weight that 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.159
 increased during those years and has a 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.740
 new perspective of life I want 

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:47.440

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:50.770

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.420

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:53.980
 the world a better place 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.690
 I think that came out more honest this 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:59.080
 they will avoid later not ghost the 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:01.510
 space you will always be our hero 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.430
