of the bin where we can use it just like
a<00:01:24.630> regular<00:01:24.810> bin<00:01:25.549> see<00:01:26.549> there's<00:01:26.700> a<00:01:26.759> lot<00:01:26.880> of

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
a regular bin see there's a lot of

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.380 
a regular bin see there's a lot of
wiring<00:01:28.579> temperature<00:01:29.579> sensor<00:01:29.939> over<00:01:30.180> there

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
wiring temperature sensor over there

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.210 
wiring temperature sensor over there
there's<00:01:30.780> lots<00:01:30.930> of<00:01:31.110> sensors<00:01:31.560> in<00:01:31.710> here

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
there's lots of sensors in here

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.969 
there's lots of sensors in here
tell<00:01:33.000> us<00:01:33.150> how<00:01:34.079> wet<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:35.000> how<00:01:36.000> warm<00:01:36.420> or<00:01:36.720> cool<00:01:37.710> the

corn is coming out of here

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.370 
corn is coming out of here
lots<00:01:41.220> of<00:01:41.369> vents<00:01:41.670> in<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:41.850> roof<00:01:42.150> all<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.110> dust

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
lots of vents in the roof all the dust

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.010 
lots of vents in the roof all the dust
stuck<00:01:43.680> there<00:01:43.920> as<00:01:44.040> because<00:01:44.250> as<00:01:44.659> the<00:01:45.659> moisture

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
stuck there as because as the moisture

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.899 
stuck there as because as the moisture
comes<00:01:46.229> out<00:01:46.409> it<00:01:46.619> gets<00:01:46.799> pretty<00:01:47.009> sticky<00:01:47.700> and

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
comes out it gets pretty sticky and

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.450 
comes out it gets pretty sticky and
humid<00:01:48.090> in<00:01:48.360> there<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:48.720> so<00:01:48.979> try<00:01:49.979> to<00:01:50.040> keep<00:01:50.280> that

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
humid in there and so try to keep that

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.690 
humid in there and so try to keep that
clean<00:01:51.140> and<00:01:52.140> that's<00:01:52.770> our<00:01:52.920> corn<00:01:53.189> dryer<00:01:53.430> I<00:01:53.610> know

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
clean and that's our corn dryer I know

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.149 
clean and that's our corn dryer I know
if<00:01:53.880> had<00:01:54.000> people<00:01:54.390> interested<00:01:54.810> in<00:01:54.840> seeing<00:01:55.170> what

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
if had people interested in seeing what

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.010 
if had people interested in seeing what
the<00:01:56.189> inside<00:01:56.700> is<00:01:56.729> like<00:01:57.119> it<00:01:57.390> looks<00:01:57.600> just<00:01:57.810> like<00:01:57.930> a

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
the inside is like it looks just like a

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.050 
the inside is like it looks just like a
regular<00:01:58.229> grain<00:01:58.649> bin<00:01:58.920> from<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.310> outside<00:01:59.700> but

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
regular grain bin from the outside but

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.389 
regular grain bin from the outside but
we've<00:02:00.990> got<00:02:01.110> this<00:02:01.259> false<00:02:01.530> floor<00:02:01.829> in<00:02:02.070> here<00:02:02.189> up

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
we've got this false floor in here up

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.200 
we've got this false floor in here up
top<00:02:02.610> where<00:02:02.909> we<00:02:02.939> pump<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.360> hot<00:02:03.509> air<00:02:03.659> in
