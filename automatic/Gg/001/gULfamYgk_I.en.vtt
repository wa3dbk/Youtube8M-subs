what<00:00:42.719> you're<00:00:42.870> gonna<00:00:42.989> do<00:00:43.200> is<00:00:43.379> you're<00:00:43.530> going<00:00:43.680> to

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
what you're gonna do is you're going to

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.970 
what you're gonna do is you're going to
use<00:00:43.920> your<00:00:44.309> dominant<00:00:44.550> hand<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:45.300> push<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:46.530> cards

use your dominant hand to push the cards
off<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.460> you're<00:00:47.820> gonna<00:00:47.940> be<00:00:48.120> using<00:00:48.300> your

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:48.860 
off and you're gonna be using your

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.580 
off and you're gonna be using your
weaker<00:00:49.860> hand<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.760> be<00:00:51.449> counting<00:00:51.989> so<00:00:52.170> it's<00:00:52.350> just

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
weaker hand to be counting so it's just

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.760 
weaker hand to be counting so it's just
the<00:00:52.800> opposite<00:00:53.460> now<00:00:53.940> try<00:00:54.270> something<00:00:54.780> try<00:00:55.530> doing

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
the opposite now try something try doing

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.099 
the opposite now try something try doing
the<00:00:55.980> Elmslie<00:00:56.340> count<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.820> other<00:00:57.030> way<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.809> same

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
the Elmslie count the other way the same

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.290 
the Elmslie count the other way the same
way<00:00:58.289> that<00:00:58.469> you<00:00:58.649> normally<00:00:59.129> count<00:00:59.340> cards<00:00:59.820> so<00:01:00.239> you

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
way that you normally count cards so you

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.600 
way that you normally count cards so you
take<00:01:00.510> one<00:01:01.070> block<00:01:02.070> push<00:01:02.520> and<00:01:02.879> return<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:04.610> 3/4

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
take one block push and return to 3/4

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.670 
take one block push and return to 3/4
and<00:01:05.880> then<00:01:06.330> you'll<00:01:06.510> see<00:01:06.720> how<00:01:06.840> difficult<00:01:07.409> it<00:01:07.650> is

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
and then you'll see how difficult it is

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.190 
and then you'll see how difficult it is
for<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:08.189> beginner<00:01:08.580> so<00:01:09.270> let's<00:01:09.479> try<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:10.080> do<00:01:10.170> a

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
for a beginner so let's try and do a

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.740 
for a beginner so let's try and do a
tutorial<00:01:10.439> on<00:01:10.880> the<00:01:11.880> Elmslie<00:01:12.180> count<00:01:12.479> very

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
that helps I know it's confusing when

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.089 
that helps I know it's confusing when
you<00:02:25.540> first<00:02:25.569> start<00:02:26.110> out<00:02:26.260> but<00:02:26.590> I<00:02:26.650> want<00:02:26.769> you<00:02:26.950> guys
