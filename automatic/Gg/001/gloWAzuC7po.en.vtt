well absolutely that's double double
every<00:01:38.590> three<00:01:38.619> DB<00:01:38.950> is<00:01:39.159> double<00:01:39.460> rest<00:01:39.639> what<00:01:39.880> yeah

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 
every three DB is double rest what yeah

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:42.840 
every three DB is double rest what yeah
okay<00:01:40.270> as<00:01:40.929> well<00:01:41.170> yeah<00:01:41.560> so<00:01:41.950> obviously<00:01:42.280> we<00:01:42.399> stack

even<00:03:27.980> more<00:03:28.160> trying<00:03:28.640> to<00:03:28.700> do<00:03:28.760> it<00:03:28.850> more<00:03:29.000> compact

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
even more trying to do it more compact

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.330 
even more trying to do it more compact
and<00:03:29.660> more<00:03:29.720> portable<00:03:30.230> so<00:03:30.470> this<00:03:30.920> year<00:03:31.070> we<00:03:31.220> come

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
and more portable so this year we come

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.430 
and more portable so this year we come
up<00:03:31.459> with<00:03:31.550> the<00:03:31.670> symbian<00:03:32.030> 1200<00:03:32.630> this<00:03:33.050> system

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
up with the symbian 1200 this system

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:34.960

it goes into and because it's not
forwards<00:06:47.040> you<00:06:47.100> get<00:06:47.310> a<00:06:47.340> lot<00:06:47.730> less<00:06:47.760> distortion

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:48.540 
forwards you get a lot less distortion

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:51.080 
forwards you get a lot less distortion
from<00:06:48.720> the<00:06:48.870> airflow<00:06:49.260> so<00:06:49.860> a<00:06:49.890> really<00:06:50.550> really<00:06:50.790> flat

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:51.090 
from the airflow so a really really flat

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:52.220 
from the airflow so a really really flat
natural<00:06:51.690> response

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:52.230 
natural response

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:55.460 
natural response
oh<00:06:52.410> my<00:06:53.100> amps<00:06:53.430> silk<00:06:54.000> sweet<00:06:54.240> as<00:06:54.420> Kevlar<00:06:54.930> drivers

and<00:06:55.740> yet<00:06:56.130> it's<00:06:56.280> the<00:06:56.430> nuclear<00:06:56.820> range<00:06:57.060> that<00:06:57.360> say

00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:57.870 
and yet it's the nuclear range that say

00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:59.780 
and yet it's the nuclear range that say
we're<00:06:58.080> we're<00:06:58.260> just<00:06:58.500> launching<00:06:58.650> light<00:06:59.400> p.m.<00:06:59.610> so

00:06:59.780 --> 00:06:59.790 
we're we're just launching light p.m. so

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:01.310 
we're we're just launching light p.m. so
you<00:06:59.970> don't<00:07:00.120> have<00:07:00.240> to<00:07:00.360> have<00:07:00.480> miners<00:07:00.900> larger

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:01.320 
you don't have to have miners larger

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:03.170 
you don't have to have miners larger
