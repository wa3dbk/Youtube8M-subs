00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
called a friction lever system the

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.490 
called a friction lever system the
buckle<00:01:19.970> has<00:01:20.120> a<00:01:20.180> ball<00:01:20.510> and<00:01:20.720> socket<00:01:20.930> system

buckle has a ball and socket system

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.260 
buckle has a ball and socket system
which<00:01:21.920> gives<00:01:22.250> you<00:01:22.370> a<00:01:22.400> little<00:01:22.580> bit<00:01:22.880> of<00:01:23.000> weight

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
which gives you a little bit of weight

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.960 
which gives you a little bit of weight
around<00:01:23.540> 60<00:01:24.230> degrees<00:01:24.310> the<00:01:25.310> reason<00:01:25.640> for<00:01:25.790> this<00:01:25.910> is

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
around 60 degrees the reason for this is

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:27.910 
around 60 degrees the reason for this is
so<00:01:26.360> the<00:01:26.480> buckle<00:01:26.870> doesn't<00:01:27.170> find<00:01:27.380> the<00:01:27.530> food<00:01:27.740> up

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
so the buckle doesn't find the food up

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.920 
so the buckle doesn't find the food up
so<00:01:28.160> it<00:01:28.280> goes<00:01:28.310> forwards<00:01:28.880> motion

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.750 

the<00:01:34.930> new<00:01:35.080> hinge<00:01:35.320> design<00:01:35.560> there's<00:01:36.190> no<00:01:36.430> breaking

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:36.760 
the new hinge design there's no breaking

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.880 
the new hinge design there's no breaking
time<00:01:37.150> because<00:01:37.750> of<00:01:37.900> the<00:01:37.990> range<00:01:38.230> of<00:01:38.410> movement

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
time because of the range of movement

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.190 
time because of the range of movement
the<00:01:39.430> hinge<00:01:39.610> design<00:01:39.850> also<00:01:40.540> gives<00:01:40.840> you<00:01:40.990> that
