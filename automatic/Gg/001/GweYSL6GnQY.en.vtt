00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
straightforward very simple let's try it

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:31.830 
straightforward very simple let's try it
teacup<00:03:20.230> here<00:03:20.500> we<00:03:20.620> go<00:03:23.850> drop<00:03:24.850> it<00:03:25.000> in<00:03:30.840> should

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
teacup here we go drop it in should

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.039 
teacup here we go drop it in should
dissolve<00:03:32.200> and<00:03:32.760> mix<00:03:33.760> in<00:03:34.000> and<00:03:34.269> obviously<00:03:34.989> you

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
dissolve and mix in and obviously you

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:38.280 
dissolve and mix in and obviously you
can<00:03:35.140> see<00:03:35.290> it's<00:03:35.410> getting<00:03:35.650> a<00:03:35.920> lot<00:03:36.220> darker<00:03:36.459> now<00:03:37.290> so

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.620 
oh the only thing on the bottom seems
like<00:04:15.810> it's<00:04:16.880> pretty<00:04:17.880> well<00:04:18.000> dissolved<00:04:18.420> through

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
like it's pretty well dissolved through

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.289 
like it's pretty well dissolved through
a<00:04:18.690> nice<00:04:18.900> dark<00:04:19.620> color<00:04:19.859> here<00:04:19.980> there's<00:04:20.850> some

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
a nice dark color here there's some

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:23.140 
a nice dark color here there's some
sediment<00:04:21.660> obviously<00:04:22.500> as<00:04:22.590> you<00:04:22.680> could<00:04:22.800> see<00:04:22.950> here

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
sediment obviously as you could see here

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.070 
sediment obviously as you could see here
but<00:04:24.150> that<00:04:24.300> is<00:04:24.420> normal

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
but that is normal

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.910 
but that is normal
maybe<00:04:25.590> some<00:04:25.770> of<00:04:25.800> the<00:04:25.920> small<00:04:26.220> tea<00:04:27.120> leaves

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:27.920 
maybe some of the small tea leaves

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:35.530 
maybe some of the small tea leaves
anyway<00:04:29.210> pinkies<00:04:30.210> up<00:04:30.390> let's<00:04:31.050> try<00:04:31.230> some<00:04:31.410> teeth

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:35.540 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:46.540 

hmm<00:04:42.620> that<00:04:43.620> is<00:04:43.650> really<00:04:43.950> good

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.610 

I'm<00:04:47.550> using<00:04:47.880> a<00:04:48.150> smaller<00:04:48.750> cup<00:04:49.110> here<00:04:49.320> because<00:04:49.560> I

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
I'm using a smaller cup here because I

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.340 
I'm using a smaller cup here because I
like<00:04:49.740> my<00:04:49.919> tea<00:04:49.980> stronger<00:04:50.610> flavor<00:04:51.110> and<00:04:52.110> I<00:04:52.200> have

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.350 
like my tea stronger flavor and I have

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:53.690 
like my tea stronger flavor and I have
to<00:04:52.470> say<00:04:52.650> that's<00:04:52.800> probably<00:04:53.280> the<00:04:53.490> perfect

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:53.700 
to say that's probably the perfect

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.640 
to say that's probably the perfect
amount<00:04:54.000> of<00:04:54.090> sugar<00:04:54.300> for<00:04:54.570> me<00:04:54.750> for<00:04:55.020> my<00:04:55.169> personal

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
amount of sugar for me for my personal

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.100 
amount of sugar for me for my personal
taste<00:04:55.860> it's<00:04:56.100> really<00:04:56.300> it's<00:04:57.300> not<00:04:57.480> that<00:04:57.720> sweet<00:04:57.930> I

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
taste it's really it's not that sweet I

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:59.990 
taste it's really it's not that sweet I
would<00:04:58.320> say<00:04:58.470> like<00:04:58.710> a<00:04:58.740> one<00:04:59.040> to<00:04:59.160> ten<00:04:59.370> one<00:04:59.669> being<00:04:59.700> no

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 
would say like a one to ten one being no

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.300 
would say like a one to ten one being no
sugar<00:05:00.330> ten<00:05:00.570> being<00:05:00.780> the<00:05:01.380> cuffs<00:05:01.590> have<00:05:01.800> sugar<00:05:02.040> I

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
sugar ten being the cuffs have sugar I

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.640 
sugar ten being the cuffs have sugar I
would<00:05:02.970> probably<00:05:03.210> put<00:05:03.570> it<00:05:03.690> in<00:05:03.810> around<00:05:04.110> like<00:05:04.440> a

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
would probably put it in around like a

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:08.210 
would probably put it in around like a
five<00:05:05.190> it's<00:05:06.030> like<00:05:06.680> it's<00:05:07.680> right<00:05:07.860> there<00:05:08.040> it<00:05:08.100> has

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 
five it's like it's right there it has

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.460 
five it's like it's right there it has
enough<00:05:08.430> sweetness<00:05:08.760> to<00:05:09.150> offset<00:05:09.470> the

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:10.470 
enough sweetness to offset the

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:12.409 
enough sweetness to offset the
bitterness<00:05:10.770> from<00:05:10.919> the<00:05:11.010> natural<00:05:11.460> tea<00:05:11.940> leaf<00:05:12.120> but

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:12.419 
bitterness from the natural tea leaf but

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:14.540 
bitterness from the natural tea leaf but
it's<00:05:12.570> not<00:05:12.780> like<00:05:13.020> really<00:05:13.410> really<00:05:13.530> sweet<00:05:13.860> so<00:05:14.430> if

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
it's not like really really sweet so if

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:15.620 
it's not like really really sweet so if
you<00:05:14.640> like<00:05:14.760> your<00:05:14.880> tea<00:05:15.030> sweet<00:05:15.300> you<00:05:15.419> probably

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:15.630 
you like your tea sweet you probably

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:17.050 
you like your tea sweet you probably
don't<00:05:15.810> want<00:05:15.930> to<00:05:16.020> add<00:05:16.140> sugar<00:05:16.410> to<00:05:16.590> this<00:05:16.710> which

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060 
don't want to add sugar to this which

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:18.950 
don't want to add sugar to this which
honestly<00:05:18.060> might<00:05:18.240> take<00:05:18.390> away<00:05:18.570> from<00:05:18.720> the<00:05:18.810> whole

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 
honestly might take away from the whole

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.900 
honestly might take away from the whole
concept<00:05:19.590> of<00:05:19.740> it<00:05:19.890> just<00:05:20.010> being<00:05:20.220> an<00:05:20.490> all-in-one

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:20.910 
concept of it just being an all-in-one
