today<00:00:09.650> it's<00:00:10.650> really<00:00:10.860> really<00:00:11.280> hot<00:00:11.460> day<00:00:12.769> as<00:00:13.769> you

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
today it's really really hot day as you

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.120 
today it's really really hot day as you
see<00:00:14.190> the<00:00:14.370> temperature<00:00:15.210> sensors<00:00:15.719> shows<00:00:16.350> us<00:00:16.590> 39

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
see the temperature sensors shows us 39

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.609 
see the temperature sensors shows us 39
degrees<00:00:18.500> and<00:00:19.500> I<00:00:19.830> want<00:00:20.070> to<00:00:21.170> check<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.380> soul

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
degrees and I want to check the soul

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.590 
degrees and I want to check the soul
temperature<00:00:23.279> in<00:00:23.609> front<00:00:23.910> of<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.210> greenhouse

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600

temperature in front of the greenhouse
also<00:00:25.230> insight<00:00:26.570> later<00:00:27.570> on<00:00:27.869> I<00:00:28.080> will<00:00:28.470> also<00:00:29.070> like

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
also insight later on I will also like

also insight later on I will also like
to<00:00:29.760> show<00:00:29.939> you<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.300> inside<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.320> air

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
to show you the inside the air

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.060 
to show you the inside the air
temperature<00:00:32.600> so<00:00:33.600> has<00:00:33.750> a<00:00:33.899> theorem<00:00:34.230> recently

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070

transplanted<00:00:35.790> 18<00:00:36.360> tomato<00:00:36.840> varieties<00:00:37.410> in<00:00:37.680> the

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
transplanted 18 tomato varieties in the

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.580 
transplanted 18 tomato varieties in the
greenhouse<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:38.480> this<00:00:39.480> is<00:00:39.629> just<00:00:40.110> one<00:00:40.379> day

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
greenhouse and this is just one day

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.470 
greenhouse and this is just one day
after<00:00:41.010> this<00:00:41.129> plantation<00:00:43.219> as<00:00:44.219> you<00:00:44.430> see<00:00:44.670> the

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
after this plantation as you see the

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.529 
after this plantation as you see the
surface<00:00:45.930> temperature<00:00:47.210> shows<00:00:49.250> around<00:00:50.539> 59

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
surface temperature shows around 59

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.869 
surface temperature shows around 59
degrees<00:00:52.129> which<00:00:53.129> is<00:00:53.160> really<00:00:53.640> really<00:00:53.850> hot<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:55.879> I

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
degrees which is really really hot and I

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:06.800 
degrees which is really really hot and I
wanna<00:00:57.530> step<00:00:59.390> and<00:01:00.390> go<00:01:01.140> into<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.530> greenhouse<00:01:05.810> as

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
wanna step and go into the greenhouse as

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.950 
wanna step and go into the greenhouse as
you<00:01:07.049> see<00:01:07.260> we<00:01:07.439> have<00:01:07.619> two<00:01:07.950> different

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
you see we have two different

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.260 
you see we have two different
retractable<00:01:09.960> roof<00:01:10.140> layers<00:01:10.710> here<00:01:11.000> one<00:01:12.000> is<00:01:12.150> the

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
retractable roof layers here one is the

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.170 
retractable roof layers here one is the
roof<00:01:12.450> itself<00:01:13.070> which<00:01:14.070> is<00:01:14.250> transparent<00:01:14.640> and

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
roof itself which is transparent and

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:21.530 
roof itself which is transparent and
then<00:01:15.509> white<00:01:17.299> curtain<00:01:19.790> heat<00:01:20.790> retention<00:01:21.150> and

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
then white curtain heat retention and

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.760 
then white curtain heat retention and
cooling<00:01:21.900> curtain<00:01:22.490> now<00:01:23.490> we<00:01:23.549> are<00:01:23.820> just

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
cooling curtain now we are just

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.539 
cooling curtain now we are just
retracting<00:01:25.770> them<00:01:26.070> from<00:01:26.340> different

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
retracting them from different

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.850 
retracting them from different
directions<00:01:27.420> so<00:01:28.430> we<00:01:29.430> can't<00:01:29.700> cover<00:01:29.970> all<00:01:30.860> the

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
directions so we can't cover all the

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.870 
directions so we can't cover all the
direct<00:01:32.250> sunlight<00:01:32.490> part<00:01:33.000> and<00:01:34.640> while<00:01:35.640> doing

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
direct sunlight part and while doing

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.960 
direct sunlight part and while doing
that<00:01:36.000> we<00:01:36.210> can<00:01:36.540> still<00:01:36.840> get<00:01:37.759> reasonable<00:01:38.759> air

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
that we can still get reasonable air

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:46.319 
that we can still get reasonable air
moment<00:01:39.509> in<00:01:39.780> between<00:01:40.259> these<00:01:40.500> two<00:01:40.799> layers<00:01:41.509> and

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:46.329 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:48.719 

walking<00:01:47.109> towards<00:01:47.350> the<00:01:47.770> inside<00:01:48.520> temperature

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
walking towards the inside temperature

00:01:48.729 --> 00:02:01.340 
walking towards the inside temperature
sensor<00:01:49.509> here<00:01:55.320> let<00:01:56.320> us<00:01:56.350> see<00:01:56.799> it<00:01:57.579> is<00:01:57.810> 37.9<00:01:59.280> and

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
sensor here let us see it is 37.9 and

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.899 
sensor here let us see it is 37.9 and
let's<00:02:02.350> check<00:02:02.679> the<00:02:02.829> soil<00:02:03.069> temperatures<00:02:03.460> once

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
let's check the soil temperatures once

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.289 
let's check the soil temperatures once
again<00:02:04.740> here<00:02:05.740> with<00:02:05.950> their<00:02:06.219> temper<00:02:06.640> soil

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:07.299 
again here with their temper soil

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:12.449 
again here with their temper soil
temperature<00:02:08.640> sensors<00:02:09.640> and<00:02:10.330> I'm<00:02:10.869> getting<00:02:11.459> 31

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
temperature sensors and I'm getting 31

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:20.539 
temperature sensors and I'm getting 31
to<00:02:12.879> 40<00:02:15.180> santur<00:02:16.180> degrees<00:02:17.129> and<00:02:18.780> as<00:02:19.780> you<00:02:19.989> see<00:02:20.260> we

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:20.549 
to 40 santur degrees and as you see we

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:23.670 
to 40 santur degrees and as you see we
have<00:02:21.549> really<00:02:22.000> small<00:02:22.329> young<00:02:22.780> plants<00:02:23.260> tomato

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
have really small young plants tomato

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.500 
have really small young plants tomato
young<00:02:23.860> plants<00:02:24.250> here<00:02:25.019> transplanted<00:02:26.019> yesterday
