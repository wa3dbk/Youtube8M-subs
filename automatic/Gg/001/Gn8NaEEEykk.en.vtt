00:00:00.799 --> 00:00:03.000
 in this video we are going to explain 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.010
 how the peptide bond is formed between two amino acids 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.439
 here we have the two amino acids 

00:00:10.439 --> 00:00:12.039
 each 

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:15.269
 your group r what is it that will differentiate you 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.630
 to each other 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.439
 let's see 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.439
 the peptide bond is formed 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.519
 by reaction 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:26.839
 from this group to me not 

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:28.689
 with this group has been 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:32.189
 and possibly remembered by organic chemistry classes 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.580
 the link that forms in which a group has been and a group the mine 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.660
 a friend group 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.150
 we can imagine 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:43.910
 that is hydrogen 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.210
 react with this group 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.650
 releasing a molecule of water 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:51.590
 and that they were linked 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:53.860
 this group co 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.370
 with this group 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.000
 nh 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.100
 remember 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.220
 what the acid group 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.220
 this structure 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.620
 and it is that he who is going to react 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.620
 therefore I will stay 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.370
 h 2 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:21.200
 ceco 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.510
 nh 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.560
 this is the link 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.110
 friend 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.110
 this one here 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.940
 we serve 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.820
 80 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.820
 and we complete 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.620
 of course it has come off 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.990
 the corresponding water molecule 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.700
 the friendly link 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.350
 has characteristics similar to those of the double bond in terms of rigidity 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.680
 because 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.609
 everything in this red box 

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:12.239
 It is in the same plane 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.459
 and while these simple links 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.169
 they can turn 

00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:22.129
 this link of the friend link is rigid this will be important later 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:27.250
 at the time that the amino acid chain of a protein is lost 

00:02:27.249 --> 00:02:29.109
 in the space 

00:02:29.109 --> 00:02:34.079
 finally I remind you kirk drawn the amino acids well with this state of 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:38.219
 proto nation that does not correspond to physiological ph 

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:41.039
 to make it easier for you to understand 

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:45.429
 the formation of this water molecule in the peptidic ac 

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:47.779
 I hope you have been useful
