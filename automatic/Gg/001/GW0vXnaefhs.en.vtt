me a lot of tire pressure in most cases
I'm<00:02:44.140> ready<00:02:44.350> to<00:02:44.440> go<00:02:44.560> all<00:02:48.420> right<00:02:49.420> so<00:02:49.630> my<00:02:49.750> tire<00:02:49.930> is

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:49.960 
I'm ready to go all right so my tire is

I'm ready to go all right so my tire is
sealed<00:02:50.680> ready<00:02:51.100> to<00:02:51.220> go<00:02:51.340> if<00:02:52.300> I<00:02:52.420> wanted<00:02:52.660> to<00:02:52.780> if<00:02:52.870> I

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
sealed ready to go if I wanted to if I

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.300 
sealed ready to go if I wanted to if I
felt<00:02:53.170> the<00:02:53.260> pressure<00:02:53.470> was<00:02:53.709> a<00:02:53.740> bit<00:02:53.920> low<00:02:54.040> I<00:02:54.070> can

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
felt the pressure was a bit low I can

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.160 
felt the pressure was a bit low I can
top<00:02:54.490> it<00:02:54.520> up<00:02:54.760> with<00:02:54.940> a<00:02:55.480> bit<00:02:55.570> of<00:02:55.600> pressure<00:02:55.810> from<00:02:56.020> a

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
top it up with a bit of pressure from a

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.410 
top it up with a bit of pressure from a
hand<00:02:56.350> pump<00:02:56.560> or<00:02:57.190> an<00:02:57.459> erase<00:02:57.700> that<00:02:57.850> I<00:02:57.910> have<00:02:58.030> a<00:02:58.060> co2

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
hand pump or an erase that I have a co2

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.960 
hand pump or an erase that I have a co2
canister<00:02:58.690> I<00:02:59.140> just<00:02:59.350> pop<00:02:59.530> it<00:02:59.650> on<00:02:59.740> make<00:03:00.490> sure<00:03:00.670> it's

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
canister I just pop it on make sure it's

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.400 
canister I just pop it on make sure it's
exactly<00:03:01.390> the<00:03:01.510> pressure<00:03:01.690> that<00:03:01.870> I<00:03:01.959> want<00:03:02.170> and<00:03:02.350> I'm

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
exactly the pressure that I want and I'm

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.320 
exactly the pressure that I want and I'm
good<00:03:02.590> to<00:03:02.620> go<00:03:02.709> nearly<00:03:03.490> good<00:03:03.760> as<00:03:03.880> new<00:03:04.060> and

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
good to go nearly good as new and

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:05.580 
good to go nearly good as new and
certainly<00:03:04.660> good<00:03:04.780> enough<00:03:04.810> to<00:03:05.080> finish<00:03:05.260> the<00:03:05.380> race

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
certainly good enough to finish the race

certainly good enough to finish the race
and<00:03:05.890> it's<00:03:06.310> only<00:03:06.430> taken<00:03:06.820> me<00:03:06.850> about<00:03:07.120> three

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
and it's only taken me about three

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:11.070 
and it's only taken me about three
seconds<00:03:08.320> to<00:03:08.470> stop<00:03:09.420> now<00:03:10.420> when<00:03:10.720> I<00:03:10.750> get<00:03:10.870> home

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
seconds to stop now when I get home

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
nobody really to change the tube might

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.510 
nobody really to change the tube might
tell<00:03:13.060> us<00:03:13.270> for<00:03:13.570> a<00:03:13.630> few<00:03:14.380> days<00:03:14.560> a<00:03:14.800> few<00:03:14.830> weeks<00:03:15.130> maybe

tell us for a few days a few weeks maybe
a<00:03:15.610> few<00:03:15.790> months<00:03:16.410> in<00:03:17.410> some<00:03:17.590> cases<00:03:17.800> I<00:03:18.100> found<00:03:18.580> that

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
a few months in some cases I found that

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.150 
a few months in some cases I found that
it<00:03:19.540> literally<00:03:19.750> is<00:03:19.959> no<00:03:20.170> need<00:03:20.380> to<00:03:20.560> to<00:03:20.980> replace

it literally is no need to to replace
the<00:03:21.370> tube<00:03:21.580> it's<00:03:22.450> as<00:03:22.600> good<00:03:22.750> as<00:03:22.870> new
