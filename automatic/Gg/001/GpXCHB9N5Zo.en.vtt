00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
as I like it the importance of having it

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.510 
as I like it the importance of having it
dense<00:02:00.290> is<00:02:01.290> so<00:02:01.530> you<00:02:01.590> can<00:02:01.829> stretch<00:02:02.100> this<00:02:02.280> thing

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
dense is so you can stretch this thing

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.399 
dense is so you can stretch this thing
out<00:02:02.700> about<00:02:02.939> as<00:02:03.090> thin<00:02:03.299> as<00:02:03.329> a<00:02:03.450> canvas<00:02:03.810> so<00:02:04.170> you<00:02:04.259> can

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
out about as thin as a canvas so you can

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:05.690 
out about as thin as a canvas so you can
really<00:02:04.560> have<00:02:04.799> some<00:02:04.829> noodles<00:02:05.310> that<00:02:05.520> when

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
really have some noodles that when

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.749 
really have some noodles that when
they're<00:02:05.850> cooked<00:02:06.500> aren't<00:02:07.500> as<00:02:08.099> bad<00:02:08.429> as<00:02:08.610> your

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
they're cooked aren't as bad as your

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.210 
they're cooked aren't as bad as your
fingers<00:02:09.179> you<00:02:09.660> want<00:02:09.869> it<00:02:09.929> to<00:02:10.110> look<00:02:10.500> like<00:02:10.560> pasta

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.640 

also<00:03:53.390> be<00:03:53.540> sure<00:03:53.569> to<00:03:53.780> add<00:03:54.050> a<00:03:54.080> little<00:03:54.260> bit<00:03:54.440> olive

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
also be sure to add a little bit olive

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.369 
also be sure to add a little bit olive
oil<00:03:55.040> and<00:03:55.300> salt<00:03:56.300> the<00:03:56.510> water<00:03:56.690> before<00:03:56.989> you<00:03:57.200> do<00:03:57.349> it

the<00:03:57.980> rule<00:03:58.129> of<00:03:58.160> thumb<00:03:58.370> with<00:03:58.580> the<00:03:58.760> salted<00:03:59.690> water

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
the rule of thumb with the salted water

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.300 
the rule of thumb with the salted water
is<00:04:00.110> that<00:04:00.379> it<00:04:00.470> should<00:04:00.650> taste<00:04:00.860> a<00:04:00.980> little<00:04:01.099> bit

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
is that it should taste a little bit

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.960 
is that it should taste a little bit
like<00:04:01.489> at<00:04:01.760> sea<00:04:02.599> water<00:04:03.370> that<00:04:04.370> way<00:04:04.489> it<00:04:04.610> Labor's
