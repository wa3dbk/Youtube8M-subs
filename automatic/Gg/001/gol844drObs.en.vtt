ah<00:00:00.620> hi<00:00:01.650> it's<00:00:02.010> Cameron<00:00:02.280> and<00:00:02.639> I'm<00:00:02.700> gonna<00:00:02.820> talk

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
ah hi it's Cameron and I'm gonna talk

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:04.519 
ah hi it's Cameron and I'm gonna talk
about<00:00:03.360> our<00:00:03.540> plasmids<00:00:04.200> and<00:00:04.410> their

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
about our plasmids and their

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:06.590 
about our plasmids and their
relationship<00:00:05.160> with<00:00:05.400> antibiotic<00:00:06.089> resistance

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
relationship with antibiotic resistance

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.049 
relationship with antibiotic resistance
our<00:00:07.319> plasmids<00:00:07.950> were<00:00:08.130> originally<00:00:08.610> discovered

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
our plasmids were originally discovered

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.180 
our plasmids were originally discovered
when<00:00:09.240> antibiotic<00:00:09.990> drugs<00:00:10.320> no<00:00:10.590> longer<00:00:10.980> worked

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
when antibiotic drugs no longer worked

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.680 
when antibiotic drugs no longer worked
as<00:00:11.400> they<00:00:11.519> once<00:00:11.700> did

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
as they once did

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.460 
as they once did
one<00:00:13.110> day<00:00:14.210> doctors<00:00:15.210> and<00:00:15.540> nurses<00:00:15.900> began<00:00:16.289> to

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
one day doctors and nurses began to

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.890 
one day doctors and nurses began to
realize<00:00:16.830> that<00:00:16.859> while<00:00:17.760> these<00:00:18.180> drugs<00:00:18.480> that<00:00:18.630> we

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
realize that while these drugs that we

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.540 
realize that while these drugs that we
were<00:00:19.170> using<00:00:19.439> like<00:00:19.770> ampicillin<00:00:20.130> and

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
were using like ampicillin and

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.700 
were using like ampicillin and
penicillin<00:00:20.910> wouldn't<00:00:21.750> work<00:00:21.930> well<00:00:22.199> against<00:00:22.619> a

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
penicillin wouldn't work well against a

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.349 
penicillin wouldn't work well against a
certain<00:00:22.890> disease<00:00:23.279> or<00:00:23.519> a<00:00:23.550> certain<00:00:23.910> strain<00:00:24.210> of

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
certain disease or a certain strain of

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.540 
certain disease or a certain strain of
bacteria<00:00:24.480> and<00:00:25.170> what<00:00:25.680> they<00:00:25.800> found<00:00:25.980> out<00:00:26.250> was

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
bacteria and what they found out was

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.750 
bacteria and what they found out was
that<00:00:26.580> these<00:00:27.480> bacteria<00:00:28.109> were<00:00:28.170> surviving<00:00:28.769> in<00:00:29.279> in

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
that these bacteria were surviving in in

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.720 
that these bacteria were surviving in in
thriving<00:00:30.630> really<00:00:31.019> in<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.160> presence<00:00:32.520> of<00:00:32.610> an

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
thriving really in the presence of an

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.549 
thriving really in the presence of an
antibiotic<00:00:33.059> drug<00:00:33.540> because<00:00:34.200> they<00:00:34.350> had<00:00:34.530> a

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
antibiotic drug because they had a

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.610 
antibiotic drug because they had a
resistance<00:00:35.130> gene<00:00:35.219> that<00:00:35.940> helped<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.110> bacteria

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
resistance gene that helped the bacteria

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.590 
resistance gene that helped the bacteria
survive<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.399> reproduce<00:00:38.610> even<00:00:39.239> though<00:00:39.360> they

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
survive and reproduce even though they

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.810 
survive and reproduce even though they
were<00:00:39.660> in<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.590> presence<00:00:41.010> of<00:00:41.160> an<00:00:41.489> antibiotic

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
were in the presence of an antibiotic

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.049 
were in the presence of an antibiotic
drug<00:00:42.410> and<00:00:43.410> it's<00:00:43.920> pretty<00:00:44.129> obvious<00:00:44.219> but<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.879> R

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
drug and it's pretty obvious but the R

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.500 
drug and it's pretty obvious but the R
for<00:00:46.219> resistance<00:00:47.219> is<00:00:47.520> what<00:00:47.730> where<00:00:48.149> you<00:00:48.180> get<00:00:48.390> the

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
for resistance is what where you get the

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.520 
for resistance is what where you get the
name<00:00:48.539> our<00:00:48.899> plasmid<00:00:49.620> from<00:00:50.600> so<00:00:51.600> for<00:00:51.989> example

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
name our plasmid from so for example

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.950 
name our plasmid from so for example
whenever<00:00:53.160> you<00:00:53.430> expose<00:00:53.940> like<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.600> whole

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
whenever you expose like a whole

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.340 
whenever you expose like a whole
bacterial<00:00:55.530> population<00:00:56.190> of<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:57.000> wide<00:00:57.360> range<00:00:58.020> of

bacterial population of a wide range of

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
resistance genes are the ones that

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.420 
resistance genes are the ones that
survive<00:01:10.170> because<00:01:10.590> everything<00:01:11.040> else<00:01:11.130> dies

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
survive because everything else dies

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.310 
survive because everything else dies
they<00:01:11.760> can't<00:01:12.000> reproduce<00:01:12.330> in<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:13.110> harsh

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
they can't reproduce in a harsh

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.109 
they can't reproduce in a harsh
environment<00:01:13.380> where<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.189> antibiotics<00:01:14.909> will

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
environment where the antibiotics will

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.899 
environment where the antibiotics will
kill<00:01:15.360> them<00:01:15.540> off<00:01:16.009> so<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.250> ones<00:01:17.430> that<00:01:17.580> survive

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
kill them off so the ones that survive

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.210 
kill them off so the ones that survive
as<00:01:18.299> you<00:01:18.479> can<00:01:18.630> see<00:01:18.780> by<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.020> image<00:01:19.409> that<00:01:19.799> second

generation of dark red circles when they
go<00:01:23.820> on<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:24.090> reproduce<00:01:24.590> that<00:01:25.590> all<00:01:26.070> of<00:01:26.850> their

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
go on to reproduce that all of their

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.890 
go on to reproduce that all of their
offspring<00:01:27.600> will<00:01:28.320> now<00:01:28.530> be<00:01:29.090> of<00:01:30.090> that<00:01:30.570> same

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.530 
offspring will now be of that same
resistance<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:31.799> they<00:01:32.759> can<00:01:32.939> even<00:01:33.240> reproduce

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
resistance and they can even reproduce

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.460 
resistance and they can even reproduce
like<00:01:33.900> that<00:01:34.079> in<00:01:34.320> a<00:01:35.299> dish<00:01:36.299> a<00:01:36.600> petri<00:01:36.810> dish<00:01:36.960> full<00:01:37.409> of

like that in a dish a petri dish full of
extremely<00:01:38.460> harsh<00:01:38.700> antibiotic<00:01:39.390> drug<00:01:39.630> and

extremely harsh antibiotic drug and

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.690 
extremely harsh antibiotic drug and
those<00:01:40.439> jobs<00:01:40.650> will<00:01:40.860> have<00:01:40.979> little<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:41.400> no<00:01:41.549> effect

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
those jobs will have little to no effect

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.670 
those jobs will have little to no effect
because<00:01:42.119> of<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.479> resistance<00:01:43.170> that's

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
because of the resistance that's

because of the resistance that's
developed<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:45.180> this<00:01:45.390> is<00:01:45.570> an<00:01:45.689> evolutionary
