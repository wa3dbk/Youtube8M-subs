calibration x1 whatever you have there

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.439 
calibration x1 whatever you have there
change<00:00:27.240> it<00:00:27.449> to<00:00:27.949> 1400<00:00:29.029> you<00:00:30.029> could<00:00:30.179> pause<00:00:30.300> the

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
change it to 1400 you could pause the

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.170 
change it to 1400 you could pause the
video<00:00:30.689> if<00:00:30.810> you<00:00:30.840> need<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.170> do<00:00:31.949> this<00:00:32.070> part<00:00:32.279> 1400

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
video if you need to do this part 1400

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.380 
video if you need to do this part 1400
change<00:00:34.110> calibration<00:00:34.829> x2<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.520> 1400<00:00:36.090> as<00:00:36.180> well

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
change calibration x2 to 1400 as well

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.979 
change calibration x2 to 1400 as well
and<00:00:36.719> then<00:00:37.469> hit<00:00:37.739> master<00:00:38.250> updates<00:00:38.989> it'll

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
and then hit master updates it'll

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.090 
and then hit master updates it'll
probably<00:00:40.170> take<00:00:40.440> a<00:00:40.469> moment<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:41.070> update<00:00:41.309> and

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.100 
probably take a moment to update and

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.020 
probably take a moment to update and
don't<00:00:44.100> press<00:00:44.280> ok<00:00:44.700> and<00:00:44.969> then<00:00:45.719> file<00:00:46.469> exit<00:00:47.160> once

don't press ok and then file exit once

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.639 
don't press ok and then file exit once
that's<00:00:48.239> done<00:00:48.450> we'll<00:00:48.690> go<00:00:48.870> over<00:00:48.960> here<00:00:49.440> and

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
that's done we'll go over here and

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
it's firm and then for the tracer it'll

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.790 
it's firm and then for the tracer it'll
take<00:01:59.090> the<00:02:00.090> allen<00:02:00.450> wrench<00:02:00.929> and<00:02:01.110> take<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.440> screw

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:01.800 
take the allen wrench and take the screw

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:10.550 
take the allen wrench and take the screw
out<00:02:05.479> and<00:02:06.479> then<00:02:06.690> you'll<00:02:06.869> have<00:02:07.110> your<00:02:08.989> tracer<00:02:09.989> now

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
out and then you'll have your tracer now

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.440 
out and then you'll have your tracer now
it's<00:02:10.769> important<00:02:11.310> that<00:02:11.340> you<00:02:11.580> put<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.060> chaser

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
it's important that you put the chaser

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.509 
it's important that you put the chaser
up<00:02:12.690> to<00:02:12.930> where<00:02:13.140> half<00:02:13.500> an<00:02:13.680> inch<00:02:13.890> is<00:02:14.040> sticking<00:02:14.400> out

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:14.519 
up to where half an inch is sticking out

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:16.970 
up to where half an inch is sticking out
or<00:02:14.820> under<00:02:15.180> actually<00:02:16.110> probably<00:02:16.410> best<00:02:16.739> would<00:02:16.950> be

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
or under actually probably best would be

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.520 
or under actually probably best would be
right<00:02:17.670> under<00:02:18.090> half<00:02:18.390> an<00:02:18.600> inch<00:02:18.780> so<00:02:19.019> here<00:02:19.260> we<00:02:19.410> got

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
right under half an inch so here we got

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.590 
right under half an inch so here we got
our<00:02:19.590> caliper<00:02:20.010> that's<00:02:20.760> half<00:02:21.060> an<00:02:21.209> inch

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
our caliper that's half an inch

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.259 
our caliper that's half an inch
we'll<00:02:22.440> make<00:02:22.590> a<00:02:22.650> measurement<00:02:23.070> here<00:02:23.280> the<00:02:24.120> best

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
we'll make a measurement here the best

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:25.370 
we'll make a measurement here the best
thing<00:02:24.420> to<00:02:24.450> do<00:02:24.660> would<00:02:24.870> be<00:02:25.019> to<00:02:25.050> make<00:02:25.350> a

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
thing to do would be to make a

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.530 
thing to do would be to make a
measurement<00:02:25.680> and<00:02:26.130> then<00:02:26.550> to<00:02:26.819> put<00:02:27.269> a<00:02:27.300> little

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
measurement and then to put a little

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:28.820 
measurement and then to put a little
marker<00:02:27.930> there<00:02:28.080> so<00:02:28.290> yeah<00:02:28.380> I<00:02:28.440> have<00:02:28.650> a<00:02:28.680> little

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
marker there so yeah I have a little

I mean a tubular key here so the notch

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:45.279 
I mean a tubular key here so the notch
goes<00:04:42.800> to<00:04:43.070> the<00:04:43.159> back<00:04:43.370> into<00:04:44.210> this<00:04:44.330> little<00:04:44.539> cutout

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:45.289 
goes to the back into this little cutout

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:47.800 
goes to the back into this little cutout
here<00:04:45.710> in<00:04:45.800> the<00:04:45.889> back<00:04:46.070> so<00:04:46.430> just<00:04:47.240> hold<00:04:47.510> that<00:04:47.659> up

notch goes into that recess there and

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:05.439 
notch goes into that recess there and
now<00:05:03.310> we're<00:05:04.310> ready<00:05:04.430> to<00:05:04.610> start<00:05:04.729> tracing<00:05:05.120> let's

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:05.449 
now we're ready to start tracing let's

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:07.570 
now we're ready to start tracing let's
go<00:05:05.570> select<00:05:06.260> the<00:05:06.409> key<00:05:06.560> and<00:05:06.680> our<00:05:06.770> software<00:05:07.310> here

key so to select the key we'll go to
type<00:05:13.760> manufacturer<00:05:14.539> and<00:05:15.460> from<00:05:16.460> the<00:05:16.699> drop-down

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 
type manufacturer and from the drop-down

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.890 
type manufacturer and from the drop-down
we'll<00:05:17.630> go<00:05:17.750> down<00:05:17.930> to<00:05:18.199> the<00:05:18.289> T's<00:05:18.560> where<00:05:19.099> it<00:05:19.190> says

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:19.900 
we'll go down to the T's where it says

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.060 
we'll go down to the T's where it says
tubular<00:05:20.900> you'll<00:05:21.139> see<00:05:21.320> we<00:05:21.440> have<00:05:21.470> several

there and so now we're ready to hit

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:40.570 
there and so now we're ready to hit
trace<00:05:38.570> so<00:05:38.870> I'm<00:05:39.440> gonna<00:05:39.560> hit<00:05:39.740> trace<00:05:40.070> and<00:05:40.370> this<00:05:40.520> is

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:40.580 
trace so I'm gonna hit trace and this is

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:50.670 
trace so I'm gonna hit trace and this is
gonna<00:05:40.789> trace<00:05:41.539> now

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:50.680 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.659 

that's<00:05:51.680> what<00:05:51.830> it<00:05:51.919> should<00:05:51.949> look<00:05:52.099> like<00:05:52.219> when<00:05:52.550> it

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:52.669 
that's what it should look like when it

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:54.749 
that's what it should look like when it
does<00:05:52.819> it<00:05:52.969> and<00:05:53.090> then<00:05:53.180> you<00:05:53.240> should<00:05:53.300> hit<00:05:53.539> the<00:05:53.629> top

00:05:54.749 --> 00:05:54.759 
does it and then you should hit the top

does it and then you should hit the top
I'll<00:05:55.759> go<00:05:55.909> down<00:05:56.090> and<00:05:56.650> chase<00:05:57.650> it<00:05:57.860> out<00:06:07.180> all<00:06:08.180> right

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:08.360
