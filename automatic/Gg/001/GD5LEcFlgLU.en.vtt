you get through this side you just pop
it<00:02:16.209> over<00:02:16.620> makes<00:02:17.620> it<00:02:17.860> so<00:02:18.220> much<00:02:18.580> easier<00:02:18.640> it<00:02:19.090> cuts

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
it over makes it so much easier it cuts

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.110 
it over makes it so much easier it cuts
it<00:02:19.480> down<00:02:19.510> in<00:02:19.900> half<00:02:20.140> but<00:02:21.099> anyway<00:02:21.640> to<00:02:21.700> get<00:02:21.940> back

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
it down in half but anyway to get back

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.089 
it down in half but anyway to get back
to<00:02:22.239> this<00:02:22.360> I'm<00:02:22.569> not<00:02:22.690> going<00:02:22.870> to<00:02:22.930> demonstrate<00:02:23.099> how

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:36.790 
long enforcement getting used to it and
figuring<00:04:35.300> out<00:04:35.360> how<00:04:35.420> all<00:04:35.810> works<00:04:36.110> but<00:04:36.290> the<00:04:36.620> rest

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
figuring out how all works but the rest

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.580 
figuring out how all works but the rest
of<00:04:36.950> these<00:04:37.070> I<00:04:37.340> was<00:04:37.820> fooling<00:04:38.210> about<00:04:38.330> like<00:04:38.690> maybe

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
of these I was fooling about like maybe

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.580 
of these I was fooling about like maybe
30<00:04:39.920> 35<00:04:40.430> minutes<00:04:40.610> of<00:04:40.820> peace<00:04:40.970> and<00:04:41.380> here's<00:04:42.380> my

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
30 35 minutes of peace and here's my

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:48.400 
30 35 minutes of peace and here's my
enduro<00:04:43.430> for<00:04:45.130> that<00:04:46.130> one<00:04:46.400> turned<00:04:46.700> out<00:04:47.410> equally

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.410 
enduro for that one turned out equally

00:04:48.410 --> 00:05:00.070 
enduro for that one turned out equally
as<00:04:48.560> well

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.250 

this<00:05:01.080> the<00:05:01.710> system<00:05:02.160> that<00:05:02.370> I<00:05:02.430> got<00:05:02.960> like<00:05:03.960> I<00:05:04.050> said

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:04.260 
this the system that I got like I said

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.120 
this the system that I got like I said
it<00:05:04.350> only<00:05:04.440> came<00:05:04.800> with<00:05:05.510> three<00:05:06.510> stones<00:05:06.930> and<00:05:07.830> the

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
it only came with three stones and the

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:09.890 
it only came with three stones and the
first<00:05:08.340> time<00:05:08.520> I<00:05:08.550> used<00:05:08.790> it<00:05:08.910> it<00:05:09.060> didn't<00:05:09.419> do<00:05:09.660> what<00:05:09.870> I

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 
first time I used it it didn't do what I

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.690 
first time I used it it didn't do what I
wanted<00:05:10.139> so<00:05:10.380> I<00:05:10.440> did<00:05:10.650> some<00:05:10.830> more<00:05:10.919> research<00:05:10.980> on<00:05:11.580> it

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:11.700 
wanted so I did some more research on it
