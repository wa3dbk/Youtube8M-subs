00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 the queens of the rectum then then first 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.890
 which explains the technique only say how 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.780
 what are musicians in brazilian states 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.900
 applied is telling you how you are 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.950
 the musicians then it is in relation to the 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.230
 abdominal 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:21.689
 both will have the muscles that go 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:22.560
 center is the total and dorsal reactor of the 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.560
 Last 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:31.250
 then in this region you will get involved 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:37.050
 the external abdominal vehicle or vehicle 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:39.090
 abdominal and transverse 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.760
 abdomen 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:46.770
 these three muscles go in a 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:49.440
 or other embracing is run to the 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:53.579
 another in relation to the abdominal rectus 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:58.230
 ah then always so much in the pre 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:01:02.039
 umbilical can biblical or public 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:08.270
 an obscure external abdominal oblique 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:12.030
 get the ventral abdominal straight after 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:18.720
 abdominal public that is this 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:23.430
 here in the pre salt region 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:26.310
 it will embrace the rectus abdominis in 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.890
 region may publish when publishing or 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.360
 it will pass central and in the region 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:37.140
 public he will pass dental 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:40.439
 then the transverse abdomen in the region 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.810
 pre umbilical it will pass dorsal to the 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.909
 straight 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:48.390
 then in the region may biblical also 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:52.640
 it will pass dorsal straight and in the region 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:55.350
 public it will start to pass ventral 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.310
 tac from that begins to pass 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.969
 central 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:03.350
 so here you can see very well the 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:06.830
 internal oblique abdominal embrace 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:09.560
 the rectus abdominis he is hugging 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:12.290
 then this region is the pre- 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:15.500
 publish where you went with the domain 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.930
 embrace because here we have the 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.790
 bric sheath and the external domain 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.200
 lined with the public when not 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:25.340
 internal 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:29.239
 so here you are hugging then in the 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:33.020
 region involves the abdominal oblique 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:38.930
 the outer will pass ventral the oblique 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:43.269
 Inner abdominal will cuddle and oas ass 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:45.950
 transverse will go through saving only has 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:47.660
 313 - there are always three songs are 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:51.170
 involved in the rectus abdominis 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:54.319
 then in the pre-umbilical region the oblique 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:58.580
 the central abdominal wall 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:03:01.880
 internal oblique embraces and the transverse 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:04.100
 abdomen and will pass the salt is the fact 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.049
 live where that is what he is 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.610
 involved he is advancing to it is 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:12.440
 passing both dorsal and central 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.700
 I was always doing sookie, how's it going? 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.850
 that it opens 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:19.070
 it makes video so easy it's a 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:21.350
 track will pass dorsal and another phase will 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:23.769
 pass center only that it is glued to the 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:26.810
 outer oblique 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:30.049
 then in this pelvic region or region 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:32.480
 umbilical can look at the oblique 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:33.890
 internal will already be stuck here he 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.410
 will not hug him any more will he be 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:39.920
 happening only now totally 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:42.100
 central with the bric was then the 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:45.680
 external public in the 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:48.930
 hell is more lethal here has 21 cases and the 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:53.040
 transverse is passing dorsal 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:55.620
 to 183 always 3 to 1 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:59.370
 then in the region can umbilical 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:02.099
 outer oblique make oblique apron 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:04.650
 that is also going to pass 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:08.090
 ventral side here will also pass 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:11.700
 environmental and transit is dorsal pass 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:14.840
 're not forget that this environment that 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:21.299
 this is not so boring that he's upset 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:22.470
 and in this pelvic region here what goes 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:26.280
 to happen 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:29.550
 the oblique oblique external audience 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:33.570
 will continue to pass through the ventral 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:36.240
 then the transverse will join then 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:37.830
 transverse that passed dorsal dorsal to 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.910
 From now on, that's why. 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.720
 here o 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:45.960
 from here it becomes 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:47.699
 ventral is also there and what will dorsal 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.550
 abdominal rectum 

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:53.370
 only the territory will not have any more lights 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:55.500
 understand there will not be easier to 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:58.229
 muscle only the peritoneum treat here already 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:00.960
 there are more muscles here the muscles already 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:02.789
 is going through these environmental 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.940
 fallacies I am already passing all 

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:07.099
 central and dorsal mind we just go 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:10.710
 have peritoneum 

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:13.289
 okay then why the person if he 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:17.159
 said in the test that the muscle marked 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:21.349
 is that the region behaves then if the 

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:21.349
 people mark here 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:29.060
 Let's say that we mark here the one that 

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:29.990
 is the beak is internal this is the public 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.610
 internal 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:34.159
 there you see the umbilical scar 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:36.919
 so if it is marked right here it is 

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:39.259
 in the pre-umbilical region 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:43.009
 in this internal oblique prosthetic region 

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:44.120
 behaves in what way in relation to the 

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:46.789
 abdominal rectum 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:50.120
 there he has to see if he hugs exactly 

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:52.490
 he hugs or he passes the central or 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:54.409
 depending on the musician going to pass dorsal 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:56.330
 which is the case of the rectus abdominis 

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:58.219
 cruise and I know which is totally ventral 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:00.770
 he is here if he will be 

00:05:58.219 --> 00:06:03.080
 the demand is in line with the demand 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:05.210
 relation to the pharmacy attack or lack 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:07.819
 his coming here O ex assist 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:09.889
 Brazil bank to music and not listening 

00:06:07.819 --> 00:06:11.599
 here below all this here are the 

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:13.939
 faces of the rectum 

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:17.150
 already the bay out of the pharmacies 

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:18.740
 straight then this is the faces of the 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:22.339
 musicians that the loving part of the world 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:24.259
 O listen here understood that part that 

00:06:22.339 --> 00:06:26.930
 people are seeing that it passes central 

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:30.349
 hugs that passes the dorsal depending on the 

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:32.689
 region is easy for the muscles that are 

00:06:30.349 --> 00:06:35.569
 hugging this muscle here 

00:06:32.689 --> 00:06:38.089
 adriel renato cajÃ¡ played two things alone 

00:06:35.569 --> 00:06:40.430
 by his fans here I return to dominate the 

00:06:38.089 --> 00:06:43.909
 us nasa was already in relation to 

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:47.389
 to what I do is easy here apart 

00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:50.120
 the external audience here is the 

00:06:47.389 --> 00:06:52.399
 part of the internal public and 

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:55.360
 here will be the loving part of the 

00:06:52.399 --> 00:06:55.360
 transverse abdomen 

00:06:55.659 --> 00:07:01.969
 then depending on the region you will 

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:05.509
 behave in a different way 

00:07:01.969 --> 00:07:08.529
 fascia with respect to this muscle that is 

00:07:05.509 --> 00:07:08.529
 the challenge of be
