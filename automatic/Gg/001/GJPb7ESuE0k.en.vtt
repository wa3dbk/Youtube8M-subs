00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.390
 hello girls then after making 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.430
 this make up 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:24.270
 I leave you the video I wanted here 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.480
 make a tiny one a moment 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.189
 hairstyle 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.810
 I always tell you that I am not 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:31.450
 absolutely very good with hair 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.700
 then for a matter of its own 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:36.040
 I like having simple faces 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.440
 but sometimes when I feel like changing 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:42.280
 I love going to create hairstyles 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:44.530
 here on the side is to leave tufts in front 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.140
 maybe go and create something special 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.030
 laterally or as in this case I have 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.040
 made this very simple lateral tail 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.320
 with a peculiarity of the tuft that yes 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.170
 turns around 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.390
 surely there are various and various tutorials 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.800
 on youtube definitely made by people 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.230
 very much better than me because 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.760
 I repeat he stresses I don't know not me 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.250
 I think very short with my hair 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:09.369
 but I wanted to share it with you 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.810
 can just five minutes when there 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:13.119
 go to change a little if you like 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.810
 follow the tutorial and see how I do it 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:15.810
 realized 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.130
 then 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:24.330
 our curls we bring the hair from 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:28.450
 one side and I usually choose the side 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.580
 from where or the tuft we say the known 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:35.050
 america 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:39.670
 I take the main lock of tufts e 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:44.409
 I leave it here and also on this side 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:53.259
 leaves the main lock of tufts e 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:02:02.860
 18 super long now it's as if you were going 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:02:07.570
 to do a side thing but I leave the 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:10.209
 a part of the free hair then 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:15.459
 let 's say the most extreme part 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:18.400
 on this side and leave you here that 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.870
 I get my hair on my head 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.940
 end of the ear so I don't want to 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.940
 have your hair behind your ear 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:31.920
 I take a very small elastic and if 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.920
 they should have this metal part 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.840
 let's go and position it in the part 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.840
 internal 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:02.230
 done that in case we expand a little bit e 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:13.250
 take the lock left free 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:15.140
 let 's go downstairs so not upstairs but 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:19.040
 internally near a part 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:26.329
 ear and we turn it around the 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:35.599
 our elastic in such a way as to 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:40.239
 let's just hide it now 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:45.730
 with hairpins to pin it all 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:45.730
 trying to hide them as much as possible 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:55.069
 so maybe the positions go from 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:58.099
 internal part will not be enough 23 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:04:01.449
 then it depends on the luck of 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:01.449
 how much hair you have 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:13.640
 I am not very similar by the way 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:13.640
 they are also very thin and therefore 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:32.220
 we arrange our curls and this is it 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:35.099
 the end result is absolutely not 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:37.759
 nothing special and so 

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:40.650
 complicated I hope to be framed 

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:43.349
 but never seen really very much 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:45.509
 cute eh you can change into a swimsuit from 

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:47.340
 this is also an outfit made and there 

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:48.990
 I leave the link here I send you a 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.650
 great kiss and if I do see you see 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.650
