longer<00:03:32.210> on<00:03:32.450> the<00:03:32.570> links<00:03:32.960> and<00:03:33.050> I<00:03:33.290> didn't<00:03:33.500> pay

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
longer on the links and I didn't pay

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.490 
longer on the links and I didn't pay
attention<00:03:33.680> to<00:03:34.070> that<00:03:34.250> because<00:03:34.490> I<00:03:34.700> never<00:03:35.500> need

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
attention to that because I never need

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.020 
attention to that because I never need
to<00:03:36.680> my<00:03:36.800> wrists<00:03:37.100> are<00:03:37.190> very<00:03:37.460> little<00:03:37.850> so<00:03:37.970> I

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
to my wrists are very little so I

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.130 
to my wrists are very little so I
usually<00:03:38.240> if<00:03:38.930> I<00:03:39.050> get<00:03:39.200> a<00:03:39.230> bracelet<00:03:39.890> I<00:03:40.130> usually

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
usually if I get a bracelet I usually

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.480 
usually if I get a bracelet I usually
take<00:03:42.140> out<00:03:42.410> some<00:03:42.680> of<00:03:42.740> the<00:03:42.830> leaves<00:03:42.950> myself

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:43.490 
take out some of the leaves myself

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:45.010 
take out some of the leaves myself
because<00:03:43.700> there's<00:03:43.850> so<00:03:44.060> many<00:03:44.270> extra<00:03:44.780> and<00:03:44.900> when<00:03:44.990> I

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:45.020 
because there's so many extra and when I

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:46.930 
because there's so many extra and when I
get<00:03:45.200> watches<00:03:45.710> I<00:03:45.860> have<00:03:45.890> a<00:03:46.160> bunch<00:03:46.520> of<00:03:46.610> the<00:03:46.760> links

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
get watches I have a bunch of the links

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.180 
get watches I have a bunch of the links
taken<00:03:47.210> outside<00:03:47.360> I<00:03:47.600> think<00:03:47.720> of<00:03:48.020> that<00:03:48.200> so<00:03:48.950> if<00:03:49.010> you

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
taken outside I think of that so if you

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.240 
taken outside I think of that so if you
get<00:03:49.430> it<00:03:49.580> make<00:03:49.790> sure<00:03:49.820> you<00:03:50.150> get<00:03:50.800> more<00:03:51.800> little<00:03:52.100> pay

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
get it make sure you get more little pay

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.010 
get it make sure you get more little pay

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:30.890 
things on the site I there were two
other<00:05:28.680> pieces<00:05:28.860> that<00:05:29.430> I<00:05:29.639> saw<00:05:29.849> for<00:05:30.060> $90<00:05:30.720> with

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 
other pieces that I saw for $90 with

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.490 
other pieces that I saw for $90 with
their<00:05:31.190> triple<00:05:32.190> chain<00:05:32.520> long<00:05:33.500> layered

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.500 
their triple chain long layered

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.240 
their triple chain long layered
necklaces<00:05:35.250> so<00:05:35.580> that's<00:05:35.940> why<00:05:36.150> but<00:05:37.050> I<00:05:37.349> think<00:05:38.099> the

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.250

low you know lowering is 20 and it's up

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:46.790 
low you know lowering is 20 and it's up
to<00:05:41.819> 90<00:05:42.479> but<00:05:42.629> mostly<00:05:43.110> it's<00:05:43.349> around<00:05:43.819> 25<00:05:44.819> to<00:05:45.560> 45<00:05:46.560> in

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 
to 90 but mostly it's around 25 to 45 in
