mixture of some gels in there to go

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.510 
mixture of some gels in there to go
ahead<00:00:33.989> and<00:00:34.200> shift<00:00:34.530> it<00:00:34.739> to<00:00:34.770> a<00:00:34.920> little<00:00:35.190> bit<00:00:35.309> of<00:00:35.460> a

very<00:03:17.730> happy<00:03:18.240> the<00:03:18.660> lights<00:03:18.840> are<00:03:19.020> quiet<00:03:19.380> they're

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:19.770 
very happy the lights are quiet they're

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:22.190 
very happy the lights are quiet they're
cool<00:03:20.100> and<00:03:20.130> they're<00:03:20.460> constant<00:03:21.150> now<00:03:21.780> the<00:03:22.050> light

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
cool and they're constant now the light

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.250 
cool and they're constant now the light
itself<00:03:22.530> very<00:03:23.250> very<00:03:23.460> crisp<00:03:23.790> nice<00:03:24.540> edge<00:03:24.840> to<00:03:25.230> it

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
itself very very crisp nice edge to it

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.350 
itself very very crisp nice edge to it
there's<00:03:25.680> also<00:03:25.860> available<00:03:26.430> the<00:03:26.550> low<00:03:26.700> gel<00:03:27.060> frame

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
there's also available the low gel frame

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.240 
there's also available the low gel frame
essentially<00:03:28.050> it's<00:03:28.260> a<00:03:28.410> frame<00:03:28.710> that<00:03:29.040> you<00:03:29.070> could

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
essentially it's a frame that you could

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.040 
essentially it's a frame that you could
drop<00:03:29.460> in<00:03:29.730> different<00:03:30.240> gels<00:03:30.510> or<00:03:30.720> diffusion

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
drop in different gels or diffusion

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.170 
drop in different gels or diffusion
material<00:03:31.230> and<00:03:31.740> then<00:03:32.130> cut<00:03:32.490> them<00:03:32.550> to<00:03:32.670> size<00:03:32.700> as

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
material and then cut them to size as

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.090 
material and then cut them to size as
needed<00:03:33.540> but<00:03:33.960> what<00:03:34.080> I<00:03:34.110> really<00:03:34.530> like<00:03:34.740> is<00:03:34.770> how

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
needed but what I really like is how

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.700 
needed but what I really like is how
accurate<00:03:35.730> the<00:03:35.820> color<00:03:36.030> balance<00:03:36.450> is<00:03:36.600> and<00:03:36.900> if<00:03:37.620> you

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:37.710 
accurate the color balance is and if you

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:39.800 
accurate the color balance is and if you
look<00:03:37.860> at<00:03:37.950> the<00:03:38.040> back<00:03:38.220> here<00:03:38.580> accuracy<00:03:39.420> is<00:03:39.450> all

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
look at the back here accuracy is all

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.660 
look at the back here accuracy is all
about<00:03:40.110> what<00:03:40.290> you've<00:03:40.440> got<00:03:40.650> so<00:03:41.190> you<00:03:41.250> see<00:03:41.430> we<00:03:41.580> have

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
about what you've got so you see we have

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.150 
about what you've got so you see we have
a<00:03:41.700> precise<00:03:42.090> number<00:03:42.390> dial<00:03:42.810> and<00:03:43.050> this<00:03:43.710> makes<00:03:44.010> it

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
a precise number dial and this makes it

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.760 
a precise number dial and this makes it
absolutely<00:03:44.340> certain<00:03:45.270> the<00:03:45.840> intensity<00:03:46.320> so<00:03:46.650> if

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:46.770 
absolutely certain the intensity so if

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:48.560 
absolutely certain the intensity so if
I'm<00:03:46.890> on<00:03:47.070> set<00:03:47.430> and<00:03:47.640> I<00:03:47.760> want<00:03:47.940> to<00:03:48.000> dial<00:03:48.270> in<00:03:48.510> a

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
I'm on set and I want to dial in a

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.600 
I'm on set and I want to dial in a
particular<00:03:49.050> setting<00:03:49.470> I<00:03:49.620> don't<00:03:50.130> have<00:03:50.250> to<00:03:50.370> guess

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
particular setting I don't have to guess

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.880 
particular setting I don't have to guess
it's<00:03:50.940> not<00:03:51.120> some<00:03:51.390> knob<00:03:51.660> that<00:03:51.960> I<00:03:52.020> turn<00:03:52.350> left<00:03:52.710> or

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
it's not some knob that I turn left or

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.280 
it's not some knob that I turn left or
right<00:03:53.100> so<00:03:53.310> that's<00:03:53.580> about<00:03:53.730> right<00:03:54.210> I<00:03:54.480> could<00:03:55.080> dial

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
right so that's about right I could dial

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.100 
right so that's about right I could dial
in<00:03:55.470> a<00:03:55.500> very<00:03:55.830> exact<00:03:56.220> number<00:03:56.610> plus<00:03:57.450> we<00:03:57.750> actually

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
in a very exact number plus we actually

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:59.900 
in a very exact number plus we actually
have<00:03:58.260> a<00:03:58.290> DM<00:03:58.590> export<00:03:59.100> that<00:03:59.160> allows<00:03:59.580> us<00:03:59.610> to

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
have a DM export that allows us to

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.570 
have a DM export that allows us to
control<00:04:00.090> this<00:04:00.510> light<00:04:00.750> remotely<00:04:01.290> so<00:04:02.100> if<00:04:02.370> you

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
control this light remotely so if you

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.580 
control this light remotely so if you
are<00:04:02.670> using<00:04:02.910> a<00:04:03.120> set<00:04:03.390> with<00:04:03.510> a<00:04:03.570> lighting<00:04:04.020> grid<00:04:04.260> or

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
are using a set with a lighting grid or

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.800 
are using a set with a lighting grid or
a<00:04:04.650> theatrical<00:04:05.280> type<00:04:05.490> setup<00:04:05.790> this<00:04:06.390> will<00:04:06.630> let

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
a theatrical type setup this will let

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.750 
a theatrical type setup this will let
you<00:04:06.960> remotely<00:04:07.320> trigger<00:04:07.860> this<00:04:08.040> light<00:04:08.340> as<00:04:08.550> well

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
you remotely trigger this light as well

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.820 
you remotely trigger this light as well
as<00:04:08.910> adjust<00:04:09.330> it<00:04:09.540> using<00:04:09.690> the<00:04:10.110> lighting<00:04:10.500> control

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
as adjust it using the lighting control

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.580 
as adjust it using the lighting control
board<00:04:11.070> great<00:04:11.730> overall<00:04:12.150> controls<00:04:12.750> I<00:04:12.990> think

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
board great overall controls I think

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:14.960 
board great overall controls I think
what<00:04:13.710> you<00:04:13.800> like<00:04:13.860> is<00:04:14.220> this<00:04:14.340> whole<00:04:14.610> light<00:04:14.820> is

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
what you like is this whole light is

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.250 
what you like is this whole light is
inclusive<00:04:15.480> you're<00:04:15.600> going<00:04:15.720> to<00:04:15.780> get<00:04:15.840> the<00:04:15.960> frame

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
inclusive you're going to get the frame

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.170 
inclusive you're going to get the frame

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
the safety cables everything you need in

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.479 
the safety cables everything you need in
the<00:04:18.720> kit<00:04:18.960> and<00:04:19.230> while<00:04:19.920> it<00:04:20.010> was<00:04:20.130> originally

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
the kit and while it was originally

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.730 
the kit and while it was originally
designed<00:04:20.609> as<00:04:20.940> a<00:04:21.000> studio<00:04:21.540> light<00:04:21.900> the<00:04:22.350> fact<00:04:22.620> that

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
designed as a studio light the fact that

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.440 
designed as a studio light the fact that
it's<00:04:22.919> clocking<00:04:23.400> in<00:04:23.490> at<00:04:23.640> about<00:04:23.700> 17<00:04:24.270> and<00:04:24.390> a<00:04:24.419> half
