in<00:00:28.039> sunny<00:00:28.369> Sochi<00:00:28.939> but<00:00:29.539> I've<00:00:29.660> always<00:00:29.869> wondered

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:30.169 
in sunny Sochi but I've always wondered

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:32.200 
in sunny Sochi but I've always wondered
how<00:00:30.590> do<00:00:30.649> they<00:00:30.949> get<00:00:31.160> the<00:00:31.340> shape<00:00:31.609> of<00:00:31.789> the<00:00:31.849> track

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.210 
how do they get the shape of the track

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.509 
how do they get the shape of the track
to<00:00:32.419> be<00:00:32.629> the<00:00:32.659> way<00:00:32.989> it<00:00:33.230> is<00:00:33.260> and<00:00:33.680> also<00:00:34.010> how<00:00:34.280> do<00:00:34.339> they

00:00:34.509 --> 00:00:34.519 
to be the way it is and also how do they

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:37.360 
to be the way it is and also how do they
get<00:00:34.670> it<00:00:34.820> so<00:00:34.970> smooth<00:00:35.390> well<00:00:36.350> I<00:00:36.379> found<00:00:36.890> the<00:00:37.040> answer

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370 
get it so smooth well I found the answer

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.329 
get it so smooth well I found the answer
today<00:00:37.699> and<00:00:37.970> it<00:00:38.420> takes<00:00:38.690> manpower<00:00:39.559> to<00:00:39.829> actually

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:40.339 
today and it takes manpower to actually

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:42.490 
today and it takes manpower to actually
come<00:00:40.699> out<00:00:41.000> of<00:00:41.180> the<00:00:41.269> shape<00:00:41.570> of<00:00:41.839> the<00:00:42.019> track<00:00:42.290> and

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
come out of the shape of the track and

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.700 
come out of the shape of the track and
once<00:00:43.010> that's<00:00:43.309> done<00:00:43.670> this<00:00:44.629> big<00:00:44.960> baby<00:00:45.170> here

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710 
once that's done this big baby here

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.340 
once that's done this big baby here
comes<00:00:46.280> into<00:00:46.610> action<00:00:47.180> what<00:00:47.780> it<00:00:47.899> does<00:00:48.079> is<00:00:48.110> it

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
comes into action what it does is it

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.250 
comes into action what it does is it
works<00:00:48.829> sort<00:00:49.129> of<00:00:49.190> like<00:00:49.399> a<00:00:49.550> vacuum<00:00:49.940> machine<00:00:50.390> so

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
works sort of like a vacuum machine so

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.369 
works sort of like a vacuum machine so
it<00:00:51.559> sucks<00:00:52.039> up<00:00:52.309> all<00:00:52.519> the<00:00:52.640> excess<00:00:53.300> eyes<00:00:53.510> off<00:00:53.930> at

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 
it sucks up all the excess eyes off at

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:57.729 
it sucks up all the excess eyes off at
the<00:00:54.500> track<00:00:54.800> and<00:00:55.039> then<00:00:55.429> smooth<00:00:56.090> it<00:00:56.120> over<00:00:56.809> the

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
the track and then smooth it over the

00:00:57.739 --> 00:00:59.830 
the track and then smooth it over the
course<00:00:58.010> is<00:00:58.429> the<00:00:58.579> first<00:00:58.789> in<00:00:59.030> Russia<00:00:59.300> to<00:00:59.660> have

00:00:59.830 --> 00:00:59.840 
course is the first in Russia to have

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.020 
course is the first in Russia to have
three<00:01:00.079> output<00:01:00.530> slopes<00:01:00.920> which<00:01:01.519> help<00:01:01.760> to<00:01:01.820> slow

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
three output slopes which help to slow

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.840 
three output slopes which help to slow
speed<00:01:02.600> and<00:01:02.870> keep<00:01:03.440> athletes<00:01:03.649> safe<00:01:04.190> but

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
speed and keep athletes safe but

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.999 
speed and keep athletes safe but
competitors<00:01:05.600> can<00:01:05.869> still<00:01:06.200> clock<00:01:06.619> up<00:01:06.830> to<00:01:06.979> a

00:01:06.999 --> 00:01:07.009 
competitors can still clock up to a

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:09.070 
competitors can still clock up to a
hundred<00:01:07.340> and<00:01:07.670> thirty-five<00:01:08.149> kilometers<00:01:08.210> an

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
hundred and thirty-five kilometers an

hundred and thirty-five kilometers an
hour<00:01:09.259> here<00:01:09.440> and<00:01:09.860> getting<00:01:10.550> the<00:01:10.759> trek<00:01:11.030> leveled

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
hour here and getting the trek leveled

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:14.080 
hour here and getting the trek leveled
takes<00:01:11.840> a<00:01:11.960> few<00:01:12.170> carving<00:01:12.649> tools<00:01:12.979> and<00:01:13.369> dedicated

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
takes a few carving tools and dedicated

takes a few carving tools and dedicated
covers<00:01:14.570> I<00:01:14.929> wasn't<00:01:15.590> making<00:01:16.009> my<00:01:16.159> way<00:01:16.310> all<00:01:16.610> the

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:16.909 
covers I wasn't making my way all the

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:19.120 
covers I wasn't making my way all the
way<00:01:16.940> to<00:01:17.090> an<00:01:17.360> Olympic<00:01:17.899> track<00:01:18.170> without<00:01:18.380> testing

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
way to an Olympic track without testing

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:26.940 
way to an Olympic track without testing
my<00:01:19.280> carving<00:01:19.700> skills<00:01:19.970> say<00:01:20.869> i<00:01:21.229> digged<00:01:22.009> in<00:01:22.690> what

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.669 

and<00:01:27.950> this<00:01:28.190> is<00:01:28.369> how<00:01:28.550> we<00:01:28.610> get<00:01:28.970> the<00:01:29.929> tracks<00:01:30.259> smith

00:01:30.669 --> 00:01:30.679 
and this is how we get the tracks smith

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:38.050 
and this is how we get the tracks smith
okay<00:01:34.959> it<00:01:35.959> really<00:01:36.200> isn't<00:01:36.500> as<00:01:36.950> easy<00:01:37.190> as<00:01:37.550> it<00:01:37.580> looks

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
okay it really isn't as easy as it looks

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.380 
okay it really isn't as easy as it looks
so<00:01:38.360> you<00:01:38.420> really<00:01:38.840> need<00:01:39.080> men<00:01:39.800> like<00:01:40.039> zynga<00:01:41.000> here

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
so you really need men like zynga here

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:42.790 
so you really need men like zynga here
who<00:01:41.509> know<00:01:41.720> what<00:01:41.959> they're<00:01:42.080> doing<00:01:42.140> who've<00:01:42.619> been

00:01:55.879 --> 00:01:58.479 
that the bobsleigh and the sledging
competitions<00:01:56.539> go<00:01:57.020> exactly<00:01:57.560> the<00:01:57.770> way<00:01:57.979> it<00:01:58.340> is

00:01:58.479 --> 00:01:58.489 
competitions go exactly the way it is

00:01:58.489 --> 00:02:00.490 
competitions go exactly the way it is

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
because the truck is too big to get

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.020 
because the truck is too big to get
through<00:02:00.679> the<00:02:00.830> narrow<00:02:01.009> lanes<00:02:01.280> it's<00:02:01.610> done<00:02:01.819> the
