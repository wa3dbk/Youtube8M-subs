00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.110
 good and welcome to the decade channel 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.580
 I think it was here we are in a new 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.469
 video in which we are going to try the 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.139
 Team creator has been implemented 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.490
 this morning the server west and late 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.869
 of the week if I'm not wrong will be 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.880
 available in northern Latin America and 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.400
 Latin America south so let's see a 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.080
 a little bit of those functions people with 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.670
 the one that has spoken that has proven the 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.619
 Team creator is pretty 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.930
 happy they have left the games 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.210
 well without any troll all perfect so 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.859
 that's good, you know what the 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.230
 of trolls in question, you bring a 

00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:39.059
 issue aside but good that the truth is 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.900
 that it has worked well what is the 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:45.720
 teams matched teams pretty 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:48.570
 with their corresponding roles go to 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.430
 a red with jungle there are two bots so 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.230
 let's start let's give the 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.330
 Play tab we go to Peru bp 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.060
 classic crack of the summoner 5 versus 5 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.740
 and normal team creator you know 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.420
 that it's not for start-up that only a 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.610
 different system we can also 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.980
 select the function of always the 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.720
 choose randomly but let's take the 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.850
 creator of equipment that for that we are 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.560
 let's try the two options join 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.270
 to a team how it works well because very 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.980
 simple here we see that we enter we have 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.220
 and a map on which our 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:19.290
 champion and we're going to choose the champion by 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.410
 example let's go a lioness his third 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.000
 arrival we will give the following or aspects 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:27.150
 and selection we would do the appearance by 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.210
 example lioness defender we select and 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.340
 let's select a position we're going to 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.950
 select the lower street and here 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.080
 we have the role fixed that we have the 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.000
 little star that is recommended and we 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.710
 says that also 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.960
 as it is a support we are going to select 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.870
 support then we will do it so 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.110
 we will stay as we want and we would change 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:50.790
 summoner spells by 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.830
 exhaustion or ignite in this case 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.520
 learn for example select and masters 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:58.650
 then the runes the masters and we 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.150
 would wait time a little bit maybe and 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.970
 we selected a mid that there's a lot 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.950
 people in my faith would come out high but not 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.020
 however, a mid and 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.000
 it took me about 20 seconds in 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.319
 find the group set the speed 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.569
 same now it takes a little bit longer 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:17.139
 well you see that it has taken a 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:19.359
 seconds just now let's see the 

00:02:17.139 --> 00:02:21.909
 creator of teams creating us a 

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:24.219
 team set we are in this tab 

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:27.459
 already and here we have more freedom to 

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:29.799
 invite we have 59 minutes an hour of 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.060
 wait to create a team this 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:33.159
 It is very good when you are playing with 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.629
 five friends invite everyone and good 

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:36.340
 you can make a good combination 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:37.870
 you have a time to talk then 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.879
 dais to sign up and directly 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.349
 matches already against another team like this 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:43.510
 that is pretty good we are going to 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:45.370
 select a champion in this case 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:49.180
 let's host a jungle for example the 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:52.480
 leasing your will my hands we give to 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:54.189
 next and we select an aspect by 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.490
 example let's select leasing fist 

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:58.340
 dragon 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:00.080
 here we have it and now we select the 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.390
 street where we want to play in this 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.230
 case jungle fix appear in jungle 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:08.270
 if we select central we would go to my 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:11.960
 superior the same we have already seen 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:13.700
 previously the bot now we select 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.170
 for example fighter in the case of 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.330
 that we want to do it tank because the 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:20.660
 leasing goes a little better in both 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:22.580
 maybe for airlines for law say and 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.830
 sorry good elections tank and there 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:28.850
 we have it and then we select the rune 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:30.350
 in this case damage and jungle and I would be by 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:33.380
 example we want to invite a person 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:36.650
 then we select here we give to 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:38.870
 invite select and see how not 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.940
 accept the game and start to 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.010
 mount could speak chat 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.780
 again where we want and select and 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.970
 masters good champions, etc. 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:49.460
 center let's take another one for example the 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.750
 caught big blitz I'm going to catch a light me 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:54.920
 I had to make a decision 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:57.230
 this skin and we select central street 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.660
 the truth is that it is very good because if 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.280
 we looked when we wanted with a 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.060
 game and we were alone for example 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.599
 we were 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.620
 and we said if he touches us with a guiri 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:08.180
 surely go to choose the line of 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.920
 smith and the top line and we're not going to 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.660
 can play those lines then this 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.520
 It is very good because we are already directly 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.500
 we point as mid as mole as what 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:18.290
 we want and we do not have any kind of 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.370
 problem I think that this system is very 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.010
 difficult to implement in 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:24.500
 qualifiers because because if we 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:26.120
 we set the selection we would make a champion 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.460
 then for example the whole world 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.919
 I would select caixa de casa dyn forgiveness 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:33.320
 cap ticks etcetera etcetera champions 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:34.669
 that are very strong and the bans would be 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.729
 very complicated but then my 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:39.320
 proposal or my way of seeing the creator 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:41.660
 of equipment within a startup would be 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.550
 the next one instead of selecting a 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.620
 champion that you select the line 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:48.500
 then you already enter with a line 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:50.540
 chosen for example all you already appear 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.280
 with him with the chosen top line 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.810
 then from that point the 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:56.060
 bans but people already know that you are 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:57.620
 top that another person in your boat and another 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.660
 person because for example he tells me 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.700
 then it would be much simpler like that 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:03.350
 how nice this would be a little bit 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:05.000
 creator of teams I hope that I have 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:07.220
 liked to tell me which ones are yours 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.480
 impressions when you try it or root 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.280
 of this video 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:11.600
 I hope you liked it and see you 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.460
 in the following you can give to like 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.110
 you can subscribe to little things that cost 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.610
 a little and it helps a lot as always 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:19.690
 I say and what we have said we will see in the 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:19.690
 next video goodbye
