00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:12.540
 android remote desktop 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:16.680
 Android remote desktop is practically the 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:19.130
 Control for your android mobile phone via 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.130
 a browser 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:23.510
 What do we do for this? 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.699
 website 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:28.740

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:35.940
 the link there he goes more 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.739
 and you know while in one 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.730
 tutorial we already have jashari 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:45.149
 looked at here on otto.de and the 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.129
 use to read the qr-code 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.969
 Who does not know how that works? 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.410
 said here one module is channels.ch 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.079
 attributed to now 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:59.670
 superimposed with the shop very around us 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:02.250
 is only holding qr-code i love this 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.260
 dearest this is so cool on android 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.470
 now a bit over-rich camel 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:11.420
 because back there because I'll tell you at dresen 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:14.250
 that will be really cool when we first 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.479
 the new dresen have where i stand like that 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.290
 can and i would pressed it before 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.490
 if it has to sit 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.770
 is downloaded then it works correctly 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:26.000
 los what we do initially make time 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:30.840
 us only browser windows on and here 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.130
 we have to specify a port 80 80 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.829
 If he had it right now , I would too 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:38.579
 keep import uncooled on startup 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:41.100
 server so we're stepping on here so now 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.140
 the desktop server is started 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.380
 in this green line you see 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.060
 practically an ip-address and this ip 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:54.960
 addresses we need our browser 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:02:00.420
 so enter http dortmund flash 192 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:05.460
 point 18.00 88 now must be 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:08.450
 Colon to 80 80 and / and now 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.450
 Let's start paying attention 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:15.510
 that was so now he has practically that 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:17.610
 complete desktop edited there on yours 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.590
 Handy had that you have here now 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:24.180
 that means you can go here now 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:26.010
 For example, let's go on your under 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.769
 construction does not work yet 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.230
 although under construction 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:34.530
 nothing works yet 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:36.680
 contact under construction wallpapers 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.209
 or it happens something all clear 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.379
 You can now have a new wallpaper 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.920
 put 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:46.319
 shared flipboard that means you can do that 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.780
 clipboard from android and here 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:51.599
 link together next 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.519
 we have file explorer and now are 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:58.700
 we practically directly on my android 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:03:01.079
 in the file explorer and it 's so cool 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.569
 that's really cool 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:05.909
 the white of delay point text you can 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:07.950
 see learning practically down and 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:09.840
 I can show what I have 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.760
 i still have messaging here too 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.540
 what else I can do here 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.349
 I can practically tell me here 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.260
 show 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:21.900
 from the last two weeks I can 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.540
 even rewrite here or on it 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:28.109
 Answer to this fair that is me 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:32.540
 Can me right from this application 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:35.430
 Send an sms to the mobile phone 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.079
 So what's up is that 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.840
 I find that messaging very much 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:41.970
 well and the case explorer works 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.069
 but you have to see it too 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.780
 then drag and drop still works 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:47.879
 not with the file explorer 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.629
 that is, if you are to part of here 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:53.669
 he probably loads the normal 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:57.870
 but you can also go to 

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:59.790
 example delete a file with the 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.599
 right mouse button on go you can 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.299
 to rename 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:05.040
 you can copy the delete or you 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:09.090
 You can also add an arrow over 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:12.269
 right click bargain and would on 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:15.810
 the sdk team needs and looking now 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:17.930
 Let's just play itunes out 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:22.550
 itunes media 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:25.340
 we endure music james foley monja 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:27.699
 land and then take just where 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:31.729
 open it rap 

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:35.600
 ok and now the file is over wlan 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:38.449
 directly on the android phone 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.979
 transfer should now see assisted 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:42.850
 there if now look to the fact 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:44.870
 would make you would download 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:48.530
 I do not think so 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:51.259
 no, the people are not yet the 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:53.720
 Idea is really good in front of the whole 

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:57.050
 is fun if that completely 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:05:00.590
 mature is I have to say is that 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:04.610
 exactly what I was looking for personally 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:07.310
 have an android phone also under 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:08.180
 mac os or linux super manage too 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.460
 So if it really can 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:12.560
 you can gravel this works 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:16.910
 terrible software the samsung with it 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:17.900
 really gives the h to give if 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:20.539
 everything works 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:24.310
 okay that's it for this short tutorial 

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:26.960
 over the android the stop 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:29.389
 I hope so interesting for you 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:31.070
 as there are innovations here in this 

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:33.440
 I will also apply it to you 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:35.449
 Keep youtube channel up to date 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.690
