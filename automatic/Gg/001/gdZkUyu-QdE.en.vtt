beige<00:00:54.989> which<00:00:55.620> might<00:00:55.920> look<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.219> little<00:00:56.250> dark<00:00:56.640> for

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
beige which might look a little dark for

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.849 
beige which might look a little dark for
me<00:00:57.059> but<00:00:57.270> when<00:00:57.360> I<00:00:57.390> was<00:00:57.570> in<00:00:57.629> Ulta<00:00:58.079> they<00:00:58.440> only<00:00:58.590> had

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
me but when I was in Ulta they only had

00:00:58.859 --> 00:00:59.959 
me but when I was in Ulta they only had
the<00:00:58.890> lightest<00:00:59.309> shade<00:00:59.340> and<00:00:59.699> then<00:00:59.789> there<00:00:59.910> were

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
the lightest shade and then there were

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.279 
the lightest shade and then there were
two<00:01:00.149> shades<00:01:00.420> missing<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:00.989> then<00:01:01.079> there<00:01:01.199> was

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
two shades missing and then there was

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.170 
two shades missing and then there was
this<00:01:01.440> one<00:01:01.680> so<00:01:02.129> that's<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.609> color<00:01:02.820> that<00:01:03.059> I

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
this one so that's the color that I

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.429 
this one so that's the color that I
picked<00:01:03.480> up<00:01:03.570> at<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.780> fact<00:01:04.019> that<00:01:04.080> this<00:01:04.229> is<00:01:04.350> the

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
picked up at the fact that this is the

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:05.960 
picked up at the fact that this is the
fourth<00:01:04.650> lightest<00:01:04.979> shade<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:05.460> you<00:01:05.549> see<00:01:05.760> like

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
fourth lightest shade and you see like

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.850 
fourth lightest shade and you see like
my<00:01:06.180> face<00:01:06.420> color<00:01:06.720> I'm<00:01:07.049> not<00:01:07.380> really<00:01:07.500> sure<00:01:07.740> what

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
my face color I'm not really sure what

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.640 
my face color I'm not really sure what
that<00:01:07.920> means<00:01:08.220> for<00:01:08.670> darker<00:01:09.150> skin<00:01:09.180> people

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 
that means for darker skin people

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.020 
that means for darker skin people
hopefully<00:01:10.650> there's<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.040> shade<00:01:11.369> range<00:01:11.610> for<00:01:11.939> you

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
hopefully there's a shade range for you

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.820 
hopefully there's a shade range for you
if<00:01:12.180> this<00:01:12.299> is<00:01:12.479> good<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:12.900> if<00:01:13.049> this<00:01:13.229> isn't<00:01:13.650> that<00:01:13.799> I

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
if this is good and if this isn't that I

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.260 
if this is good and if this isn't that I
guess<00:01:14.100> you<00:01:14.250> don't<00:01:14.340> have<00:01:14.460> much<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.880> worry<00:01:15.030> about

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
guess you don't have much to worry about

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.859 
guess you don't have much to worry about
this<00:01:15.509> was<00:01:16.009> $12.99<00:01:17.250> at<00:01:17.310> my<00:01:17.759> Ulta<00:01:18.479> but<00:01:18.720> then<00:01:18.840> I

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
this was $12.99 at my Ulta but then I

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.050 
this was $12.99 at my Ulta but then I
went<00:01:19.110> to<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.740> drugstore<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.580> I<00:01:20.670> saw<00:01:20.820> that<00:01:20.939> it

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
went to a drugstore and I saw that it

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.910 
went to a drugstore and I saw that it
was<00:01:21.090> 1099<00:01:21.869> so<00:01:22.140> I<00:01:22.170> guess<00:01:22.409> you<00:01:22.530> really<00:01:22.560> just<00:01:22.860> have

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
was 1099 so I guess you really just have

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.280

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
your local drugstores to see where this

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
this video I'm going to be using my

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.319 
this video I'm going to be using my
fingers<00:01:40.860> there<00:01:41.579> was<00:01:41.670> a<00:01:41.729> lot<00:01:41.909> of<00:01:41.939> controversy

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
fingers there was a lot of controversy

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.410 
fingers there was a lot of controversy
on<00:01:42.840> my<00:01:43.259> last<00:01:43.530> video<00:01:43.890> about<00:01:44.220> me<00:01:45.030> using<00:01:45.329> my

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
on my last video about me using my

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.719 
on my last video about me using my
fingers<00:01:45.810> but<00:01:46.320> I<00:01:46.590> think<00:01:46.979> that<00:01:47.189> everyone<00:01:47.610> is

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
fingers but I think that everyone is

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.280 
fingers but I think that everyone is
born<00:01:47.909> of<00:01:48.090> fingers<00:01:48.390> so<00:01:48.540> if<00:01:48.630> you<00:01:48.750> like<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.200> way

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
born of fingers so if you like the way

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.660 
born of fingers so if you like the way
that<00:01:49.439> this<00:01:49.590> foundation<00:01:49.740> turns<00:01:50.310> out<00:01:50.430> with<00:01:50.549> your

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
that this foundation turns out with your

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.190 
that this foundation turns out with your
fingers<00:01:50.909> it's<00:01:51.360> going<00:01:51.509> to<00:01:51.570> be<00:01:51.659> damn<00:01:51.899> better

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
fingers it's going to be damn better

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.230 
fingers it's going to be damn better
with<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:52.409> brush<00:01:52.710> with<00:01:53.009> a<00:01:53.040> sponge<00:01:53.399> with<00:01:53.850> anything

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
with a brush with a sponge with anything

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.969 
with a brush with a sponge with anything
so<00:01:54.360> this<00:01:54.479> is<00:01:54.630> just<00:01:54.840> how<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:54.990> product<00:01:55.439> really

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
so this is just how the product really

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.130 
so this is just how the product really
and<00:01:56.280> truly<00:01:56.610> works<00:01:57.060> so<00:01:57.600> that's<00:01:57.780> why<00:01:57.930> I'm<00:01:57.990> going

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
and truly works so that's why I'm going

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.330 
and truly works so that's why I'm going
to<00:01:58.170> use<00:01:58.229> my<00:01:58.439> fingers<00:01:58.799> because<00:01:58.920> I<00:01:59.070> think<00:01:59.159> it

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
to use my fingers because I think it

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.429 
to use my fingers because I think it
just<00:01:59.460> gives<00:01:59.670> the<00:02:00.270> basis<00:02:01.110> of<00:02:01.229> how<00:02:01.380> the

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
just gives the basis of how the

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.319 
just gives the basis of how the
foundation<00:02:01.979> works<00:02:02.310> and<00:02:02.640> it's<00:02:02.790> just<00:02:03.060> going<00:02:03.210> to

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
foundation works and it's just going to

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.899 
foundation works and it's just going to
be<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.630> truest<00:02:04.140> so<00:02:04.770> yeah<00:02:05.399> because<00:02:05.729> my<00:02:05.850> fingers

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
be the truest so yeah because my fingers

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.010 
be the truest so yeah because my fingers
aren't<00:02:06.270> really<00:02:06.420> going<00:02:06.540> to<00:02:06.600> alter<00:02:06.869> how<00:02:06.990> the

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
aren't really going to alter how the

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.510 
aren't really going to alter how the
product<00:02:07.439> works<00:02:07.560> but<00:02:07.829> a<00:02:07.860> sponge<00:02:08.220> or<00:02:08.459> brush

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
product works but a sponge or brush

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.449 
product works but a sponge or brush

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.210 
for me personally I think that it looks
great<00:04:05.599> but<00:04:05.959> what<00:04:06.230> I'm<00:04:06.349> really<00:04:06.379> impressed<00:04:06.980> with

my<00:05:25.220> blog<00:05:25.460> or<00:05:25.639> something<00:05:25.970> but<00:05:26.300> I<00:05:26.479> do<00:05:26.599> think<00:05:26.870> that

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:27.020 
my blog or something but I do think that

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.990 
my blog or something but I do think that
it<00:05:27.169> is<00:05:27.199> worth<00:05:27.560> 12<00:05:27.860> dollars<00:05:28.220> not<00:05:28.639> really<00:05:28.849> much

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 
it is worth 12 dollars not really much

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.939 
it is worth 12 dollars not really much
more<00:05:29.330> and<00:05:29.750> maybe<00:05:30.199> only<00:05:30.440> a<00:05:30.560> couple<00:05:30.860> dollars

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:30.949 
more and maybe only a couple dollars

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:33.749 
more and maybe only a couple dollars
less<00:05:31.190> because<00:05:31.849> I<00:05:31.880> do<00:05:32.210> think<00:05:32.570> that<00:05:32.720> it<00:05:32.900> has<00:05:33.110> very

00:05:33.749 --> 00:05:33.759 
less because I do think that it has very

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:37.060 
less because I do think that it has very
medium<00:05:34.759> to<00:05:35.150> full<00:05:35.360> coverage<00:05:35.740> full<00:05:36.740> coverage

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:37.070 
medium to full coverage full coverage

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:38.800 
medium to full coverage full coverage
for<00:05:37.280> a<00:05:37.310> lot<00:05:37.460> of<00:05:37.580> people<00:05:37.820> not<00:05:38.000> necessarily<00:05:38.630> for

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:38.810 
for a lot of people not necessarily for

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:40.270 
for a lot of people not necessarily for
me<00:05:38.840> I<00:05:38.990> might<00:05:39.320> go<00:05:39.530> put<00:05:39.740> on<00:05:39.860> a<00:05:39.889> little<00:05:40.130> bit<00:05:40.250> more
