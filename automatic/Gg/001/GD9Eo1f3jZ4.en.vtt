against a wall I always thought that was
rather<00:04:34.620> unique<00:04:34.860> but<00:04:35.220> that's<00:04:35.370> the<00:04:35.520> way<00:04:35.640> they

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:35.790 
rather unique but that's the way they

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.360 
rather unique but that's the way they
they<00:04:36.540> had<00:04:36.720> it<00:04:36.870> some<00:04:37.260> people<00:04:37.590> have<00:04:37.800> called<00:04:38.070> him

Tasmanian eucalyptus burl and these came
to<00:05:52.850> us<00:05:54.580> cut<00:05:55.580> about<00:05:55.790> this<00:05:56.030> thickness<00:05:56.300> and

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:56.660 
to us cut about this thickness and

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:58.540 
to us cut about this thickness and
stacked<00:05:57.110> just<00:05:57.410> the<00:05:57.620> way<00:05:57.740> they<00:05:57.889> were<00:05:57.949> cut<00:05:58.340> from

00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:58.550 
stacked just the way they were cut from

stacked just the way they were cut from
from<00:05:58.940> the<00:05:59.030> burl

00:05:59.650 --> 00:05:59.660 
from the burl

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:03.070 
from the burl
a<00:05:59.690> burl<00:06:00.169> is<00:06:00.260> usually<00:06:00.860> a<00:06:00.889> big<00:06:01.660> kind<00:06:02.660> of<00:06:02.750> growth

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:03.080 
a burl is usually a big kind of growth

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.560 
a burl is usually a big kind of growth
that<00:06:03.410> is<00:06:03.590> is<00:06:04.040> usually<00:06:04.490> down<00:06:04.699> towards<00:06:05.120> this<00:06:05.330> the

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:05.570 
that is is usually down towards this the

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:08.860 
that is is usually down towards this the
base<00:06:05.930> of<00:06:06.199> a<00:06:06.290> certain<00:06:06.800> trees<00:06:07.130> and<00:06:07.660> what<00:06:08.660> makes

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:08.870 
base of a certain trees and what makes

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:11.290 
base of a certain trees and what makes
them<00:06:09.110> so<00:06:09.800> desirable<00:06:10.400> is<00:06:10.669> that<00:06:10.880> they'll<00:06:11.060> have

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:11.300 
them so desirable is that they'll have

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:17.159 
them so desirable is that they'll have
this<00:06:11.990> just<00:06:12.290> wild<00:06:13.510> figure<00:06:14.510> in<00:06:14.690> it<00:06:14.840> yeah<00:06:15.290> I

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:17.169 
this just wild figure in it yeah I

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:19.570 
this just wild figure in it yeah I
really<00:06:18.169> think<00:06:18.380> this<00:06:18.500> is<00:06:18.680> just<00:06:18.919> a<00:06:19.040> quite<00:06:19.550> a

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:19.580 
really think this is just a quite a

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.550 
really think this is just a quite a
unique<00:06:19.790> showpiece<00:06:20.449> and<00:06:20.720> but<00:06:21.199> you'll<00:06:21.320> notice

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:21.560 
unique showpiece and but you'll notice

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:23.469 
unique showpiece and but you'll notice
that<00:06:21.800> that<00:06:22.190> what<00:06:22.729> we've<00:06:22.880> done<00:06:23.090> is<00:06:23.270> we've<00:06:23.449> taken

00:06:23.469 --> 00:06:23.479 
that that what we've done is we've taken

00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:27.580 
that that what we've done is we've taken
such<00:06:24.020> a<00:06:24.229> a<00:06:24.610> completely<00:06:25.610> natural<00:06:26.320> natural<00:06:27.320> edge

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:27.590 
such a a completely natural natural edge
