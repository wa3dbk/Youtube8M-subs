statistics<00:00:17.220> that's<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:17.730> number<00:00:18.029> game<00:00:18.240> now

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
statistics that's the number game now

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.320 
statistics that's the number game now
when<00:00:19.710> it<00:00:19.859> comes<00:00:20.010> to<00:00:20.220> statistics<00:00:20.939> a<00:00:21.029> lot<00:00:21.210> of

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
when it comes to statistics a lot of

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.359 
when it comes to statistics a lot of
people<00:00:21.779> are<00:00:21.990> evers<00:00:22.470> or<00:00:22.740> they're<00:00:22.949> kind<00:00:23.160> of

people are evers or they're kind of
afraid<00:00:23.910> of<00:00:25.070> numbers<00:00:26.070> or<00:00:26.689> mathematics<00:00:27.689> and

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
afraid of numbers or mathematics and

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.890 
afraid of numbers or mathematics and
they<00:00:28.560> feel<00:00:28.769> that<00:00:28.800> I<00:00:29.250> cannot<00:00:29.820> do<00:00:30.060> it<00:00:30.269> because

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
very very important when we try to look

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.210 
very very important when we try to look
at<00:04:40.260> statistics<00:04:40.890> the<00:04:41.310> first<00:04:41.580> term<00:04:41.880> is<00:04:42.060> a

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
at statistics the first term is a

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.220 
at statistics the first term is a
variable<00:04:44.220> now<00:04:44.490> what<00:04:44.760> is<00:04:44.910> a<00:04:44.940> variable<00:04:45.570> as<00:04:45.720> the

variable now what is a variable as the

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:49.220 
variable now what is a variable as the

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:49.230 
word suggests variable which involves

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:51.350 
word suggests variable which involves
variation<00:04:49.890> so<00:04:50.430> variable<00:04:51.240> is<00:04:51.330> a

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
variation so variable is a

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.630 
variation so variable is a

difference from one win individual to

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.270 
difference from one win individual to
other<00:04:56.640> let's<00:04:57.240> take<00:04:57.450> an<00:04:57.570> example<00:04:58.130> the<00:04:59.130> best

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
other let's take an example the best

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.060 
other let's take an example the best
example<00:04:59.760> is<00:04:59.820> height<00:05:00.060> so<00:05:01.050> height<00:05:01.320> of<00:05:01.620> one

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070 
example is height so height of one

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:04.340 
example is height so height of one
person<00:05:02.550> definitely<00:05:03.120> differs<00:05:03.750> from<00:05:03.900> height<00:05:04.170> of

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350 
person definitely differs from height of

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:06.410 
person definitely differs from height of
another<00:05:04.680> person<00:05:05.070> now<00:05:05.580> it<00:05:06.030> will<00:05:06.270> have

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:06.420 
another person now it will have

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:07.970 
another person now it will have
different<00:05:06.450> measurements<00:05:07.170> if<00:05:07.470> you<00:05:07.650> measure<00:05:07.860> it

when we talk about a variable we need to

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.810 
when we talk about a variable we need to
look<00:05:22.050> at<00:05:22.260> another<00:05:22.740> terminology<00:05:23.520> which<00:05:23.670> is

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:23.820 
look at another terminology which is

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:26.870 
look at another terminology which is
known<00:05:24.000> as<00:05:24.180> an<00:05:24.360> observation<00:05:25.050> an<00:05:25.880> observation

made in one individual and in that
respect<00:05:35.490> we<00:05:35.850> need<00:05:36.000> to<00:05:36.150> know<00:05:36.270> what<00:05:36.450> is<00:05:36.600> an

person in whom an observation is made
when<00:05:47.190> we<00:05:47.220> talk<00:05:47.520> about<00:05:47.550> a<00:05:47.820> variable<00:05:48.420> as<00:05:48.570> I<00:05:48.750> said

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:49.020 
when we talk about a variable as I said

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.800 
when we talk about a variable as I said
it<00:05:49.200> varies<00:05:49.710> from<00:05:49.950> one<00:05:50.250> person<00:05:50.730> to<00:05:50.760> other<00:05:51.030> but

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:51.810 
it varies from one person to other but

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.870 
it varies from one person to other but
if<00:05:51.930> I<00:05:52.080> tell<00:05:52.590> you<00:05:52.800> that<00:05:52.860> we<00:05:53.220> need<00:05:53.400> to<00:05:53.610> measure

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:53.880 
if I tell you that we need to measure

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:58.250 
if I tell you that we need to measure
heights<00:05:54.780> of<00:05:55.220> 100<00:05:56.220> students<00:05:56.760> in<00:05:56.910> a<00:05:57.060> glass<00:05:57.360> so<00:05:58.230> I

00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:58.260 
heights of 100 students in a glass so I

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.970 
heights of 100 students in a glass so I
will<00:05:58.620> have<00:05:58.860> 100<00:05:59.700> different<00:06:00.380> measurements<00:06:01.380> all

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:01.980 
will have 100 different measurements all

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:04.100 
will have 100 different measurements all
these<00:06:02.490> hundred<00:06:02.970> different<00:06:03.300> measurements

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:04.110 
these hundred different measurements

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:07.940 
these hundred different measurements
refer<00:06:04.860> to<00:06:05.280> one<00:06:05.520> variable<00:06:06.210> that<00:06:06.510> is<00:06:06.720> height<00:06:07.050> but

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:07.950 
refer to one variable that is height but

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:09.830 
refer to one variable that is height but
if<00:06:08.160> I<00:06:08.370> collect<00:06:08.700> this<00:06:08.940> piece<00:06:09.270> of<00:06:09.450> information

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:09.840 
if I collect this piece of information

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:14.300 
if I collect this piece of information
it<00:06:10.560> is<00:06:11.450> 400<00:06:12.450> students<00:06:13.080> so<00:06:13.500> all<00:06:13.740> the<00:06:13.980> hundred

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:14.310 
it is 400 students so all the hundred

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:17.210 
it is 400 students so all the hundred
students<00:06:14.760> taken<00:06:15.180> together<00:06:15.660> form<00:06:16.560> what<00:06:17.190> is

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:17.220 
students taken together form what is

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:20.840 
students taken together form what is
known<00:06:17.580> as<00:06:17.820> data<00:06:18.660> so<00:06:19.470> data<00:06:19.500> is<00:06:20.100> nothing<00:06:20.520> but<00:06:20.670> a

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:20.850 
known as data so data is nothing but a

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:24.410 
known as data so data is nothing but a
set<00:06:21.120> of<00:06:21.180> values<00:06:21.630> which<00:06:22.470> is<00:06:22.650> recorded<00:06:23.340> on<00:06:23.490> one

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:24.420 
set of values which is recorded on one

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:27.440 
set of values which is recorded on one
or<00:06:24.720> more<00:06:25.170> individuals<00:06:26.040> so<00:06:26.670> in<00:06:26.940> this<00:06:27.120> case

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:27.450 
or more individuals so in this case

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:30.940 
or more individuals so in this case
height<00:06:28.050> is<00:06:28.380> available<00:06:29.130> but<00:06:29.880> high<00:06:30.450> in

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:30.950 
height is available but high in

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:34.490 
height is available but high in
