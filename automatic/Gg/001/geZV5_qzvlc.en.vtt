record<00:00:21.779> a<00:00:21.930> few<00:00:22.230> games<00:00:22.410> on<00:00:22.619> PTC<00:00:23.160> Gio<00:00:23.369> and<00:00:23.460> then

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
record a few games on PTC Gio and then

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.009

does<00:02:46.750> from<00:02:47.110> here<00:02:47.140> he<00:02:48.130> just<00:02:48.310> attaches<00:02:48.670> an

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
does from here he just attaches an

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.430 
does from here he just attaches an
energy<00:02:49.060> to<00:02:49.180> his<00:02:49.270> Empoleon<00:02:49.780> and<00:02:49.930> passes<00:02:50.290> which

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
energy to his Empoleon and passes which

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.410 
energy to his Empoleon and passes which
is<00:02:50.590> perfectly<00:02:51.280> fine<00:02:51.550> with<00:02:51.760> me<00:02:51.940> so<00:02:52.180> I<00:02:52.210> get

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
is perfectly fine with me so I get

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.150 
is perfectly fine with me so I get
another<00:02:52.450> level<00:02:52.870> ball<00:02:53.140> which<00:02:53.530> is<00:02:53.560> okay<00:02:53.920> I<00:02:53.950> can

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
another level ball which is okay I can

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.490 
another level ball which is okay I can
grab<00:02:54.340> out<00:02:54.460> more<00:02:54.640> Dino's<00:02:55.060> I'm<00:02:55.540> still<00:02:56.020> fairly

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
grab out more Dino's I'm still fairly

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.680 
grab out more Dino's I'm still fairly
confused<00:02:57.040> and<00:02:57.190> polygons<00:02:57.610> confuses<00:02:58.090> me<00:02:58.240> just

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
confused and polygons confuses me just

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.690 
confused and polygons confuses me just
in<00:02:58.840> general<00:02:59.230> but<00:02:59.740> I'm<00:02:59.980> not<00:03:00.190> really<00:03:00.310> sure<00:03:00.550> what

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
in general but I'm not really sure what

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.520 
in general but I'm not really sure what
to<00:03:00.790> do<00:03:01.000> here<00:03:01.030> so<00:03:01.420> I<00:03:01.450> grab<00:03:01.690> another<00:03:01.780> Dino<00:03:02.140> just

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
to do here so I grab another Dino just

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.560 
to do here so I grab another Dino just
so<00:03:02.590> I<00:03:02.650> can<00:03:02.710> set<00:03:03.040> up<00:03:03.070> and<00:03:03.430> then<00:03:03.700> just<00:03:03.850> go<00:03:04.300> for<00:03:04.480> the

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570 
so I can set up and then just go for the

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.210 
so I can set up and then just go for the
Juniper<00:03:04.900> straightaway<00:03:05.410> I'm<00:03:05.770> not<00:03:05.980> too<00:03:06.100> happy

I'm just going to have to junk on off
the<00:03:50.860> dark<00:03:51.070> patching<00:03:51.489> so<00:03:51.730> not<00:03:52.120> great<00:03:52.300> before

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
the dark patching so not great before

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.840 
the dark patching so not great before
I'd<00:03:52.840> top<00:03:53.140> deck<00:03:53.350> array<00:03:53.770> candy<00:03:54.160> which<00:03:54.310> is<00:03:54.430> highly

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:54.850 
I'd top deck array candy which is highly

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.630 
I'd top deck array candy which is highly
highly<00:03:55.360> unlikely<00:03:55.780> I<00:03:56.200> could<00:03:57.160> be<00:03:57.280> onto<00:03:57.430> a<00:03:57.580> winner

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 
highly unlikely I could be onto a winner

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.340 
highly unlikely I could be onto a winner
here<00:03:58.060> I<00:03:58.150> could<00:03:58.330> be<00:03:58.480> onto<00:03:58.600> a<00:03:58.720> winner<00:03:58.780> can<00:03:59.170> nice

00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.350 
here I could be onto a winner can nice

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.530 
here I could be onto a winner can nice
be<00:03:59.620> an<00:03:59.709> extern<00:04:00.100> but<00:04:00.790> that's<00:04:00.970> only<00:04:01.120> if<00:04:01.420> he

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
be an extern but that's only if he

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.600 
be an extern but that's only if he
doesn't<00:04:01.840> get<00:04:01.900> the<00:04:02.080> energy<00:04:02.470> and<00:04:02.739> then<00:04:03.430> he

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610 
doesn't get the energy and then he

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.600 
doesn't get the energy and then he
attaches<00:04:03.910> it<00:04:04.330> so<00:04:04.810> I'm<00:04:05.410> in<00:04:05.650> a<00:04:05.680> really<00:04:05.769> bad<00:04:06.130> spot

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:06.610 
attaches it so I'm in a really bad spot

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:08.310 
attaches it so I'm in a really bad spot
right<00:04:06.940> now<00:04:07.120> I've<00:04:07.300> got<00:04:07.450> nothing<00:04:07.840> in<00:04:07.930> my<00:04:08.050> hand

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:08.320 
right now I've got nothing in my hand

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.930 
right now I've got nothing in my hand
the<00:04:08.769> potential<00:04:09.280> to<00:04:09.370> get<00:04:09.459> a<00:04:09.519> hide<00:04:09.700> you've<00:04:09.850> gone

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
the potential to get a hide you've gone

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.820 
the potential to get a hide you've gone
in<00:04:10.120> play<00:04:10.300> but<00:04:10.690> if<00:04:10.870> I<00:04:10.989> top<00:04:11.230> that<00:04:11.410> something<00:04:11.709> to

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:11.830 
in play but if I top that something to

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
get the rare candy I've got no energy

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:15.680 
get the rare candy I've got no energy
I've<00:04:14.130> got<00:04:14.280> no<00:04:14.400> Sableye<00:04:14.940> all<00:04:15.180> I<00:04:15.209> can<00:04:15.450> do<00:04:15.569> is

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
I've got no Sableye all I can do is

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.050 
I've got no Sableye all I can do is
paralyzed<00:04:16.169> so<00:04:16.530> he<00:04:17.010> thinks<00:04:17.370> for<00:04:17.549> a<00:04:17.609> while

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
paralyzed so he thinks for a while

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.270 
paralyzed so he thinks for a while
retreats<00:04:18.570> his<00:04:18.780> squirtle<00:04:19.260> and<00:04:19.290> then<00:04:19.620> and<00:04:19.889> then

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
retreats his squirtle and then and then

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:29.300 
retreats his squirtle and then and then
think<00:04:20.519> some<00:04:20.790> more<00:04:22.340> and<00:04:24.470> then<00:04:25.470> some<00:04:25.680> more<00:04:28.190> and<00:04:29.190> a

that's<00:04:37.710> what<00:04:37.919> he<00:04:37.980> was<00:04:38.070> thinking<00:04:38.669> about<00:04:38.760> so

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.450 
that's what he was thinking about so

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:40.820 
that's what he was thinking about so
I've<00:04:39.540> got<00:04:39.690> no<00:04:39.870> choice<00:04:40.080> but<00:04:40.350> to<00:04:40.410> promote<00:04:40.650> my

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
I've got no choice but to promote my

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:47.690 
I've got no choice but to promote my
dark<00:04:41.130> cry<00:04:41.370> and<00:04:44.900> yes<00:04:45.900> the<00:04:46.740> rare<00:04:46.950> candy<00:04:47.400> but

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:47.700 
dark cry and yes the rare candy but

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.850 
dark cry and yes the rare candy but
pretty<00:04:47.910> much<00:04:48.090> nothing<00:04:48.330> else<00:04:48.660> to<00:04:48.870> do<00:04:48.930> so<00:04:49.710> while

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
pretty much nothing else to do so while

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.560 
pretty much nothing else to do so while
I'm<00:04:50.010> familiarizing<00:04:50.760> myself<00:04:50.790> with<00:04:51.240> his

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 
I'm familiarizing myself with his

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:54.890 
I'm familiarizing myself with his
disappear<00:04:52.290> ops<00:04:52.590> down<00:04:52.830> another<00:04:53.400> rare<00:04:54.060> candy<00:04:54.570> so

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
disappear ops down another rare candy so

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.200 
disappear ops down another rare candy so
he's<00:04:55.080> got<00:04:55.350> not<00:04:55.919> only<00:04:56.190> one<00:04:56.400> Empoleon<00:04:56.940> but<00:04:57.120> he's

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
he's got not only one Empoleon but he's

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.330 
he's got not only one Empoleon but he's
also<00:04:57.360> got<00:04:57.570> a<00:04:57.600> Blastoise<00:04:58.169> out<00:04:58.350> and<00:04:58.560> I'm<00:04:59.160> not

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
also got a Blastoise out and I'm not

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:00.890 
also got a Blastoise out and I'm not
really<00:04:59.520> sure<00:04:59.729> what<00:04:59.940> the<00:05:00.030> Blastoise<00:05:00.450> is<00:05:00.630> about

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:00.900 
really sure what the Blastoise is about

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.680 
really sure what the Blastoise is about
then<00:05:01.290> he's<00:05:01.440> ditto<00:05:01.830> transforms<00:05:02.729> into<00:05:03.030> a<00:05:03.210> Kyodo

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
then he's ditto transforms into a Kyodo

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:06.260 
then he's ditto transforms into a Kyodo
and<00:05:03.960> I<00:05:04.200> am<00:05:04.350> immediately<00:05:05.160> in<00:05:05.550> trouble

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
and I am immediately in trouble

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.320 
and I am immediately in trouble
especially<00:05:07.110> when<00:05:07.350> not<00:05:07.530> one<00:05:07.770> note<00:05:08.460> not<00:05:08.760> two<00:05:09.030> but

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
especially when not one note not two but

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.659 
especially when not one note not two but
three<00:05:09.500> energy<00:05:10.500> come<00:05:10.710> down<00:05:10.919> on<00:05:11.100> this<00:05:11.280> magic

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:11.669 
three energy come down on this magic

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:14.000 
three energy come down on this magic
pony<00:05:11.970> and<00:05:12.270> I<00:05:12.510> am<00:05:12.630> seriously<00:05:13.200> in<00:05:13.470> some<00:05:13.800> deep

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.010 
pony and I am seriously in some deep

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:16.430 
pony and I am seriously in some deep
water<00:05:14.220> right<00:05:14.580> here<00:05:14.820> he's<00:05:15.330> probably<00:05:15.870> it<00:05:16.260> might

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440 
water right here he's probably it might

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:17.960 
water right here he's probably it might
be<00:05:16.560> able<00:05:16.650> to<00:05:16.800> carry<00:05:17.010> my<00:05:17.100> hydronic<00:05:17.550> and<00:05:17.790> get<00:05:17.940> a

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970 
be able to carry my hydronic and get a

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:20.150 
be able to carry my hydronic and get a
couple<00:05:18.300> more<00:05:18.390> energy<00:05:18.750> on<00:05:18.870> there<00:05:19.080> but<00:05:19.560> at<00:05:19.800> worst

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.160 
couple more energy on there but at worst

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.130 
couple more energy on there but at worst
yep<00:05:20.610> he<00:05:20.820> just<00:05:21.030> rushes<00:05:21.390> in<00:05:21.570> and<00:05:21.780> hits<00:05:21.960> me<00:05:22.110> for

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:22.140 
yep he just rushes in and hits me for

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:24.950 
yep he just rushes in and hits me for
110<00:05:23.010> so<00:05:23.460> I've<00:05:23.580> got<00:05:23.729> no<00:05:23.910> energy<00:05:24.090> and<00:05:24.450> I<00:05:24.690> draw<00:05:24.930> a

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 
110 so I've got no energy and I draw a

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.340 
110 so I've got no energy and I draw a
dark<00:05:25.200> patch<00:05:25.470> a<00:05:26.060> dark<00:05:27.060> patch<00:05:27.300> and<00:05:27.630> then<00:05:28.050> this<00:05:28.200> is

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:28.350 
dark patch a dark patch and then this is

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:30.230 
dark patch a dark patch and then this is
where<00:05:28.500> the<00:05:28.530> silliness<00:05:28.950> begins<00:05:29.430> i<00:05:29.760> retreat<00:05:30.120> my

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
where the silliness begins i retreat my

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.420 
where the silliness begins i retreat my
hives<00:05:30.479> gone<00:05:30.750> after<00:05:30.960> using<00:05:31.320> a<00:05:31.380> max<00:05:31.620> potion<00:05:31.860> just

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:32.430 
hives gone after using a max potion just

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:33.740 
hives gone after using a max potion just
so<00:05:32.520> that<00:05:32.640> he<00:05:32.669> has<00:05:33.000> 2k<00:05:33.300> over<00:05:33.390> do<00:05:33.570> you<00:05:33.600> know

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
so that he has 2k over do you know

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.330 
so that he has 2k over do you know
whether<00:05:33.960> my<00:05:34.229> hide<00:05:34.410> you<00:05:34.560> go<00:05:34.650> on<00:05:34.710> and<00:05:35.100> then<00:05:35.280> you

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:35.340 
whether my hide you go on and then you

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.070 
whether my hide you go on and then you
guys<00:05:35.490> have<00:05:35.669> rare<00:05:35.940> candies<00:05:36.330> into<00:05:36.630> women<00:05:36.870> poli

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 
guys have rare candies into women poli

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.140 
guys have rare candies into women poli
on<00:05:37.289> and<00:05:37.530> then<00:05:37.890> you<00:05:38.010> can<00:05:38.039> use<00:05:38.490> two<00:05:38.820> driving

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:39.150 
on and then you can use two driving

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.540 
on and then you can use two driving
draws<00:05:39.570> to<00:05:39.810> try<00:05:39.990> and<00:05:40.080> get<00:05:40.169> enough<00:05:40.440> energy<00:05:40.680> onto

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:41.550 
draws to try and get enough energy onto

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:44.029 
draws to try and get enough energy onto
this<00:05:41.669> car<00:05:41.910> do<00:05:42.090> so<00:05:42.600> the<00:05:42.690> ETA<00:05:42.960> was<00:05:43.169> one<00:05:43.620> here<00:05:43.830> care

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:44.039 
this car do so the ETA was one here care

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:46.760 
this car do so the ETA was one here care
of<00:05:44.130> everything<00:05:44.580> on<00:05:44.940> my<00:05:45.330> field<00:05:45.770> absolutely

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:46.770 
of everything on my field absolutely

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:48.950 
of everything on my field absolutely
everything<00:05:47.340> I<00:05:47.729> check<00:05:48.060> his<00:05:48.180> deck<00:05:48.419> see<00:05:48.690> if<00:05:48.750> I<00:05:48.810> can

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 
everything I check his deck see if I can

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.420 
everything I check his deck see if I can
win<00:05:49.080> by<00:05:49.200> Decker<00:05:49.560> but<00:05:49.770> that's<00:05:50.010> not<00:05:50.220> going<00:05:50.370> to

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:50.430 
win by Decker but that's not going to

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.460 
win by Decker but that's not going to
happen<00:05:50.580> either<00:05:51.000> and<00:05:51.690> this<00:05:51.810> uses<00:05:52.050> a<00:05:52.169> crazy

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:52.470 
happen either and this uses a crazy

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:53.540 
happen either and this uses a crazy
amount<00:05:52.710> of<00:05:52.740> junipers<00:05:53.160> but<00:05:53.310> I<00:05:53.340> don't<00:05:53.460> think

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:53.550 
amount of junipers but I don't think

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:55.340 
amount of junipers but I don't think
that's<00:05:53.760> going<00:05:53.940> to<00:05:54.000> happen<00:05:54.150> and<00:05:54.570> as<00:05:54.900> predicted

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:55.350 
that's going to happen and as predicted

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:57.800 
that's going to happen and as predicted
he<00:05:55.500> goes<00:05:55.680> head<00:05:55.950> attaches<00:05:56.370> one<00:05:56.760> energy<00:05:57.180> to

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:57.810 
he goes head attaches one energy to

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:59.390 
he goes head attaches one energy to
energy<00:05:58.200> and<00:05:58.410> that<00:05:58.560> carrier<00:05:58.919> is<00:05:59.070> now<00:05:59.190> hitting

00:05:59.390 --> 00:05:59.400 
energy and that carrier is now hitting

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.150 
energy and that carrier is now hitting
for<00:05:59.700> a<00:05:59.729> massive<00:06:00.229> 150<00:06:01.229> and<00:06:01.470> it<00:06:01.680> looks<00:06:01.860> like<00:06:01.919> the

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:02.160 
for a massive 150 and it looks like the
