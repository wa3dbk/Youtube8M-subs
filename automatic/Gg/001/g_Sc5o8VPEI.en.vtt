00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:20.030
 mounted on a southern river stretch 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:21.800
 running it's true that often in 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:24.590
 these places we have some beautiful 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.570
 fish that maraud the approach must 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:29.660
 to be very sweet 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:31.940
 we get to be in the nature element to 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:33.140
 spring in the nature event and 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:36.610
 somewhere fish it stresses 

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:36.610
 much less when a law 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:47.690
 an action against 8 who is in the process of 

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:51.620
 to pass in front of big shock is at the bottom and 

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:54.860
 so I presented by doing such 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:54.860
 orange head 

00:05:54.949 --> 00:06:01.259

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:04.500
 really a fish from us because 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:05.569
 that he has he with black dots so he 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.759
 has no red dot 

00:06:05.569 --> 00:06:10.370

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:16.770
