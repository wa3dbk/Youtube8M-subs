from Pixie you can get this brand at
Target<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.329> I<00:00:45.390> believe<00:00:45.719> this<00:00:45.930> goes<00:00:46.170> for<00:00:46.530> seven

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
Target and I believe this goes for seven

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.279 
Target and I believe this goes for seven
to<00:00:47.190> eight<00:00:47.340> dollars<00:00:47.789> which<00:00:48.270> is<00:00:48.510> pricey<00:00:48.870> for<00:00:49.079> a

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
to eight dollars which is pricey for a

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.959 
to eight dollars which is pricey for a
lip<00:00:49.530> balm<00:00:49.739> but<00:00:50.010> I<00:00:50.190> feel<00:00:50.370> like<00:00:50.489> it's<00:00:50.640> kind<00:00:50.910> of

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
lip balm but I feel like it's kind of

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.700 
lip balm but I feel like it's kind of
more<00:00:51.149> of<00:00:51.210> like<00:00:51.420> a<00:00:51.449> lipstick<00:00:52.020> lip<00:00:52.289> balm<00:00:52.469> it's

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
more of like a lipstick lip balm it's

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.590 
more of like a lipstick lip balm it's
multi-purpose<00:00:53.070> for<00:00:53.610> me<00:00:53.730> anyway<00:00:54.030> this<00:00:54.300> one<00:00:54.570> is

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
multi-purpose for me anyway this one is

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.600

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
i think is cool it's different for a lip

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.530 
i think is cool it's different for a lip
balm<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.470> I<00:01:23.040> think<00:01:23.460> they<00:01:23.610> do<00:01:23.850> make<00:01:24.060> tinted

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.200 
balm and I think they do make tinted
ones<00:01:24.750> but<00:01:25.110> I'm<00:01:25.259> not<00:01:25.409> sure<00:01:25.770> where<00:01:26.490> you<00:01:26.700> can<00:01:26.909> find
