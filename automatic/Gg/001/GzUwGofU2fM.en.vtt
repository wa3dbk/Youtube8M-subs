really no way to mess it up so bad that

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.640 
really no way to mess it up so bad that
you<00:04:52.110> know<00:04:52.620> you<00:04:52.920> can't<00:04:53.220> use<00:04:53.760> it<00:04:54.380> the<00:04:55.380> only<00:04:55.560> way

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
you know you can't use it the only way

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.770 
you know you can't use it the only way
it<00:04:55.830> would<00:04:55.890> be<00:04:56.070> if<00:04:56.340> you<00:04:57.210> pulled<00:04:57.510> the<00:04:57.660> battery

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
it would be if you pulled the battery

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.500 
it would be if you pulled the battery
wall<00:04:58.260> something<00:04:58.770> was<00:04:58.890> installing<00:04:59.280> but<00:04:59.850> even

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.510 
wall something was installing but even

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:02.840 
wall something was installing but even
then<00:05:00.870> you<00:05:00.900> could<00:05:01.200> still<00:05:01.500> get<00:05:02.280> it<00:05:02.430> back<00:05:02.610> to

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:02.850 
then you could still get it back to

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:08.140 
then you could still get it back to
working<00:05:03.180> um<00:05:04.790> so<00:05:05.790> yeah<00:05:06.030> I<00:05:06.330> guess<00:05:06.540> I'll<00:05:06.810> do<00:05:07.100> a

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.150 
working um so yeah I guess I'll do a

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.480 
working um so yeah I guess I'll do a
speed<00:05:09.150> test<00:05:09.390> just<00:05:09.630> to<00:05:09.720> show<00:05:09.930> how<00:05:10.169> fast<00:05:10.650> rise

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
speed test just to show how fast rise

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.920 
speed test just to show how fast rise
ins<00:05:11.730> network<00:05:12.090> is<00:05:12.300> here<00:05:12.660> it's<00:05:13.470> extremely<00:05:14.040> fast

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930 
ins network is here it's extremely fast

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:21.620 
ins network is here it's extremely fast
um<00:05:15.930> where's<00:05:16.919> my<00:05:17.100> there<00:05:17.370> it<00:05:17.460> is<00:05:17.580> speed<00:05:17.940> test<00:05:20.630> I'm

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:21.630 
um where's my there it is speed test I'm

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:25.390 
um where's my there it is speed test I'm
in<00:05:22.190> Minnetonka<00:05:23.190> Minnesota<00:05:23.820> which<00:05:24.330> is<00:05:24.510> about

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:25.400 
in Minnetonka Minnesota which is about

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:31.030 
in Minnetonka Minnesota which is about
10<00:05:26.400> miles<00:05:27.169> west<00:05:28.169> of<00:05:28.490> minneapolis<00:05:29.600> so

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:31.040 
10 miles west of minneapolis so

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.469 
10 miles west of minneapolis so
minneapolis<00:05:32.040> is<00:05:32.190> a<00:05:32.220> 4G<00:05:32.669> network<00:05:33.030> and<00:05:33.330> i'm

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:33.479 
minneapolis is a 4G network and i'm

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:50.429 
minneapolis is a 4G network and i'm
right<00:05:33.750> inside<00:05:33.900> of<00:05:34.080> it<00:05:34.260> so<00:05:34.560> begin<00:05:35.280> test<00:05:36.650> see

00:05:50.429 --> 00:05:50.439 

00:05:50.439 --> 00:05:53.110 

so<00:05:51.439> it<00:05:51.500> looks<00:05:51.680> like<00:05:51.740> I<00:05:51.949> peaked<00:05:52.220> at<00:05:52.400> about<00:05:52.460> 13
