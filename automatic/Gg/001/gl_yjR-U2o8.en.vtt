180 and it also fits this one would be

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:25.890 
180 and it also fits this one would be
maybe<00:04:24.070> a<00:04:24.220> bit<00:04:24.370> tricky<00:04:24.610> to<00:04:24.730> remove<00:04:25.060> I<00:04:25.330> have<00:04:25.750> to

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
bottle of 260 in room temperature it's

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.170 
bottle of 260 in room temperature it's
gonna<00:04:39.880> take<00:04:40.180> me<00:04:40.420> around<00:04:40.770> 4<00:04:41.770> minutes<00:04:42.370> 6<00:04:43.060> minutes

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
gonna take me around 4 minutes 6 minutes

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.710 
gonna take me around 4 minutes 6 minutes
6<00:04:43.870> minutes<00:04:44.250> 4<00:04:45.250> minutes<00:04:45.280> would<00:04:45.670> be<00:04:45.850> 150

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 
6 minutes 4 minutes would be 150

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.440 
6 minutes 4 minutes would be 150
milliliters<00:04:47.160> so<00:04:48.160> let's<00:04:48.520> see<00:04:48.760> let's<00:04:49.060> see<00:04:49.180> if<00:04:49.330> it

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:49.450 
milliliters so let's see let's see if it

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:52.770 
milliliters so let's see let's see if it
works<00:04:49.660> like<00:04:49.840> that<00:04:51.090> so<00:04:52.090> according<00:04:52.660> to<00:04:52.690> the

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780 
works like that so according to the

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.290 
works like that so according to the
instructions<00:04:53.470> I<00:04:53.860> have<00:04:54.100> to<00:04:54.490> first<00:04:54.790> place<00:04:55.120> the

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:55.300 
instructions I have to first place the

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.170 
instructions I have to first place the
battle<00:04:55.600> and<00:04:56.040> for<00:04:57.040> this<00:04:57.160> one<00:04:57.400> I'm<00:04:57.490> gonna<00:04:57.700> use<00:04:57.790> my

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
battle and for this one I'm gonna use my

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.860 
battle and for this one I'm gonna use my
206<00:04:59.050> manager<00:04:59.620> Tommy<00:05:00.010> to<00:05:00.160> the<00:05:00.250> bottle<00:05:00.720> place<00:05:01.720> on

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
206 manager Tommy to the bottle place on

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:19.800 
206 manager Tommy to the bottle place on
inside<00:05:04.080> I'm<00:05:05.080> going<00:05:05.260> to<00:05:05.380> add<00:05:05.500> some<00:05:05.740> water

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:19.810 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:23.820 

it<00:05:20.140> should<00:05:20.350> be<00:05:20.470> enough<00:05:21.060> and<00:05:22.350> I'm<00:05:23.350> going<00:05:23.710> to

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:23.830 
it should be enough and I'm going to

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:30.890 
it should be enough and I'm going to
turn<00:05:24.070> to<00:05:24.640> number<00:05:25.090> three<00:05:25.540> and<00:05:29.400> as<00:05:30.400> you<00:05:30.550> can<00:05:30.700> see

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 
turn to number three and as you can see

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.320 
turn to number three and as you can see
this<00:05:31.900> amber<00:05:32.560> light<00:05:32.770> is<00:05:32.980> flashing<00:05:33.160> which<00:05:34.090> means

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:34.330 
this amber light is flashing which means

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.680 
this amber light is flashing which means
the<00:05:34.420> water<00:05:34.540> is<00:05:34.690> hitting<00:05:35.530> it<00:05:35.650> and<00:05:36.360> once<00:05:37.360> the

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:37.690 
the water is hitting it and once the

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:41.250 
the water is hitting it and once the
water<00:05:37.840> is<00:05:38.110> warm<00:05:38.530> and<00:05:38.950> the<00:05:39.760> number<00:05:40.720> light<00:05:40.960> will

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:41.260 
water is warm and the number light will

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:45.360 
water is warm and the number light will
go<00:05:42.220> down<00:05:42.490> so<00:05:43.480> then<00:05:43.930> I<00:05:43.960> have<00:05:44.230> to<00:05:44.260> wait<00:05:44.530> they

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:45.370 
go down so then I have to wait they

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:47.430 
go down so then I have to wait they
recommended<00:05:46.000> six<00:05:46.600> minutes<00:05:46.930> until<00:05:47.080> this

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:47.440 
recommended six minutes until this

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.830 
recommended six minutes until this
battle<00:05:47.620> is<00:05:47.950> warm<00:05:48.400> enough<00:05:48.490> so<00:05:48.910> let's<00:05:49.570> see<00:05:49.720> I'm

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:49.840 
battle is warm enough so let's see I'm

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.270 
battle is warm enough so let's see I'm
gonna<00:05:49.990> count<00:05:50.200> now<00:05:50.410> how<00:05:50.620> long<00:05:50.650> it's<00:05:51.100> going<00:05:51.220> to

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:51.280 
gonna count now how long it's going to

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.970 
gonna count now how long it's going to
take<00:05:51.340> and<00:05:51.790> let's<00:05:52.150> see<00:05:52.300> so<00:05:53.169> six<00:05:53.470> minutes<00:05:53.830> have

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:53.980 
take and let's see so six minutes have

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:55.800 
take and let's see so six minutes have
passed<00:05:54.250> I<00:05:54.490> have<00:05:54.669> already<00:05:54.910> removed<00:05:55.090> my<00:05:55.450> bottle

and switch back to zero and the bottle
I've<00:06:01.330> already<00:06:01.690> tried<00:06:01.870> the<00:06:01.960> water<00:06:02.140> in<00:06:02.290> my<00:06:02.380> hand

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:02.590 
I've already tried the water in my hand

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:06.720 
I've already tried the water in my hand
and<00:06:02.860> it's<00:06:03.310> perfectly<00:06:04.180> warm<00:06:04.770> it's<00:06:05.770> the<00:06:06.070> ideal

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:06.730 
and it's perfectly warm it's the ideal

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:08.370 
and it's perfectly warm it's the ideal
temperature<00:06:07.090> and<00:06:07.690> I'm<00:06:07.930> really<00:06:08.290> really

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:08.380 
temperature and I'm really really

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:11.130 
temperature and I'm really really
satisfied<00:06:09.540> by<00:06:10.540> the<00:06:10.600> way<00:06:10.750> this<00:06:10.930> was

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:11.140 
satisfied by the way this was

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:15.990 
satisfied by the way this was
room-temperature<00:06:12.070> water<00:06:12.570> and<00:06:14.490> I'm<00:06:15.490> sure<00:06:15.880> it's

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:16.000 
room-temperature water and I'm sure it's

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.600 
room-temperature water and I'm sure it's
going<00:06:16.120> to<00:06:16.180> take<00:06:16.330> a<00:06:16.360> bit<00:06:16.570> longer<00:06:16.840> if<00:06:17.380> I<00:06:18.100> had<00:06:18.370> used

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:18.610 
going to take a bit longer if I had used

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:21.330 
going to take a bit longer if I had used
water<00:06:18.940> from<00:06:19.180> the<00:06:19.270> fridge<00:06:19.710> but<00:06:20.710> that's<00:06:21.070> not

water from the fridge but that's not

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:24.740 
water from the fridge but that's not
something<00:06:21.790> which<00:06:22.480> I'm<00:06:22.660> planning<00:06:22.990> on<00:06:23.020> doing<00:06:23.700> so

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:24.750 
something which I'm planning on doing so

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:29.790 
something which I'm planning on doing so

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:32.680 
thing about this warmer is that as you

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.110 
thing about this warmer is that as you
can<00:06:32.800> see<00:06:32.860> there<00:06:33.130> is<00:06:33.220> no<00:06:33.400> switch<00:06:33.700> on<00:06:33.880> enough

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:34.120

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:37.500
