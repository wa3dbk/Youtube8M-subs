00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 hi everyone at the DJ microphone he 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:08.120
 gamer and now finally figured out 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.120
 riddle to you on simpson 1942 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:17.130
 I think you all have heard about the tasks 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.770
 phantom categories at the moment their 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.920
 just two phantom object that appeared 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.660
 with the addition of tea rides and cadets 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.939
 the house that appeared with the addition 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.920
 new buildings immediately warn that this 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.420
 video just like the previous one I will 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.250
 put photos of cute animals 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.710
 empty seats and now a little 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.750
 dive into the past and I remind you about 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.120
 phantom object a few days after 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.489
 the addition of the tea rating 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.399
 for battlefield 4 on maps of it 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.550
 addition people found weird figures 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:50.010
 after a while they discovered that 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.379
 on their feet each of these figures were 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.960
 incomprehensible signs later they realized that 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.420
 These signs indicate the Chinese figures and 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.370
 Then these numbers were assigned to letters. 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.760
 English alphabet and they turned out 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.500
 set of letters and trial and error 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.590
 they arranged these letters so 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.180
 got a password that sounds like you 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.340
 in the night 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.740
 but this was not enough 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.650
 understand where to enter this password in the end 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.900
 battloge in page list of leaders in 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.840
 bottom left they found a little 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:25.170
 phantom icon and of course 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.659
 curiosity they clicked they went there 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.610
 some very strange characters then 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.070
 user identification 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.820
 and then they were asked to enter a password they 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:38.400
 of course they led him and got the message 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.680
 that unlocking phase is completed welcome 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.450
 welcome to the phantom program expect 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.460
 further instructions 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.930
 it immediately became clear that this was not the end 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.049
 phantom stories 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.179
 but still the task was open and 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.310
 complete it you had to kill 200 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:55.140

 head 300 meters for doing this 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.549
 tasks you are given a phantom program token 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.439
 unfortunately at the moment it is me 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.539
 the task is not completed I was left to kill 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.940
 another one hundred and ninety nine people of the machine 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:11.400
 Well, I do not go on the tanks what to do 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.069
 I also note that unfortunately for 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.080
 perform all the tasks phantom you 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:18.989
 need a premium assignment 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.450
 object phantom all go to the task 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:23.400
 course phantom course right after 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.680
 exit add-ons naval strike people 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.930
 went in search of Easter eggs 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.230
 or riddles and what can I say 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:34.890
 they found them on one of the cards namely 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:38.190
 islands on the lockers was written kevin 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:41.130
 simpson 1942 people immediately began to shoot down 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:44.579
 it is in search engines in Wikipedia wherever 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:47.519
 anything and they stumbled upon kevin site 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:50.519
 simpson 1942 dot com was on it 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:52.200
 depicts a strange basement or attic in 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:54.540
 principle, it does not matter the same way people 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.590
 discovered in this photo a few 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.230
 remarkable things 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.100
 namely a tattered photo under 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.920
 by stairs 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:06.690
 a bottle labeled 500 on it some 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:09.269
 sticker with a letter m hank 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:12.600
 wire in the form of numbers 9 and much 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:15.239
 another one even managed to make up 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.579
 letters from this picture but also what else 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.739
 they immediately noticed that when 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:23.239
 go to this site 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:23.239
 some kind of background music turns on 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.180
 this tune people threw in the program 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.280
 for processing music in my case it 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:43.000
 admin audishin 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:44.770
 made her form with pictograms and started and 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.900
 check and stumbled 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:52.980
 they are about fifty 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:58.240
 the ninth second the word was written 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:59.680
 epic it all shocked but no one 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.170
 understood what to do with it later 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.270
 stumbled upon the profile of a fighter Kevin Timson 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.550
 1942 in battlog 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:08.680
 in the information to his profile was 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.990
 day-to-day poem 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.610
 sometimes even changed several times 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:13.870
 day and so did the people turned their 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:16.690
 attention to his 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:20.049
 the emblem on his emblem was only three 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:23.050
 planets but gradually everything was added 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:26.110
 more and more and at the moment she 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:29.920
 already such besides this among the emblems was 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:33.010
 icon that denote and and more 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:34.630
 some kind of incomprehensible account by the way this 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:37.419
 there was only one bram that can 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:40.780
 had copy your after copy 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:44.040
 we could see that very first emblem 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:47.830
 so just recently namely today 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:50.500
 Kevin Simpson updated the information in it 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.850
 contained about the following phantoms 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.880
 it was my duty 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:56.620
 now my road comes to the end of ours 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:59.290
 the paths are unlikely to cross again 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:02.140
 but I know you will break through the world should know 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:04.900
 our reason and you have to pick up what 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:07.240
 belongs to you your key can be 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.660
 found in the information do not enter the field 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.070
 fight 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:12.960
 it's not safe there 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:15.610
 let the key bring you a prism 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.850
 after that there was some amount 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:21.640
 X's with spaces 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:23.440
 people immediately realized that this is a password and them 

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:26.410
 it remained only to substitute the necessary 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:28.600
 words to place x's first word like this 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:32.110
 was consisted of 4 letters 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:34.150
 here people remembered that epic 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:37.030
 encrypted in the melody the second word 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:39.010
 It consisted of five letters and honestly I do not 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:41.310
 I know how they got it but the branches 

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:44.590
 american community 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:47.190
 correlated his poems with that 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:51.910
 a picture that we have long known and 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:53.860
 somehow found the word dream here 

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:56.790
 which means dream and 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:59.440
 the last word is composed of 6 letters 

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:00.300
 hint to this word gave us it 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:03.930
 emblems 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:06.640
 ever changing planets and 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:08.770
 again I don't know how but people 

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:11.080
 guess what the word worlds is what 

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:15.000
 means the world and in the end we have turned 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:18.210
 password epic dream world people immediately went 

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:24.380
 already known place of the leaderboard 

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:28.180
 lower left screen led this password and 

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:30.440
 yes he worked the job openly 

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:32.630

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:34.600
 completed welcome to the program 

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:36.500

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:39.590

 server is it pistols and forth for 

00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:01.160
 camouflage of course i'm sure it's still 

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:03.260
 far from all the riddles from the supplement 

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:06.680
 naval strike because we also have 

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:09.800
 there was an uncharted camera some 

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:10.730
 inscriptions and lights that flash as 

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:13.220
 morse code 

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:16.070
 but I think in the future by joining together 

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:18.740
 our strength we can solve them on this 

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:20.540
