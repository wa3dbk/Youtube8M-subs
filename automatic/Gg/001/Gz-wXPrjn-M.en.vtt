00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:08.410 
and charm there you go
but<00:01:58.860> it's<00:01:59.010> so<00:01:59.280> annoying<00:01:59.520> because<00:02:06.290> and

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
but it's so annoying because and

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.820 
but it's so annoying because and
basically<00:02:09.420> I<00:02:09.540> had<00:02:09.810> it<00:02:09.929> run<00:02:10.050> out<00:02:10.170> of<00:02:10.200> salts

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
basically I had it run out of salts

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.950 
basically I had it run out of salts
moves<00:02:11.070> and<00:02:11.250> you<00:02:11.310> struck<00:02:11.640> on<00:02:11.790> kill<00:02:12.060> itself<00:02:12.360> and

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
moves and you struck on kill itself and

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.500 
moves and you struck on kill itself and
I<00:02:13.260> didn't<00:02:13.710> even<00:02:13.800> get<00:02:14.010> close<00:02:14.730> with<00:02:15.090> an<00:02:15.210> altar

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
I didn't even get close with an altar

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.690 
I didn't even get close with an altar
ball<00:02:15.660> so<00:02:16.260> it's<00:02:16.470> probably<00:02:16.710> about<00:02:16.860> forty<00:02:17.340> ultra

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
ball so it's probably about forty ultra

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:18.950 
ball so it's probably about forty ultra
balls<00:02:17.880> and<00:02:18.150> I<00:02:18.210> don't<00:02:18.270> even<00:02:18.420> think<00:02:18.630> I<00:02:18.660> got<00:02:18.810> one

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
balls and I don't even think I got one

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.550 
balls and I don't even think I got one
more<00:02:19.200> more<00:02:19.590> than<00:02:19.770> one<00:02:20.010> shake<00:02:20.960> like<00:02:21.960> no<00:02:22.350> better

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
more more than one shake like no better

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.260 
more more than one shake like no better
than<00:02:22.740> that<00:02:22.890> so<00:02:23.100> that's<00:02:23.190> why<00:02:23.430> I<00:02:23.460> decided<00:02:23.790> to<00:02:23.970> get

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
than that so that's why I decided to get

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.390 
than that so that's why I decided to get
the<00:02:24.390> timer<00:02:24.690> balls<00:02:24.960> I<00:02:25.410> thought<00:02:25.770> well<00:02:25.980> by<00:02:26.160> then

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
the timer balls I thought well by then

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.560 
the timer balls I thought well by then
the<00:02:26.610> Time<00:02:26.820> Vault<00:02:26.850> have<00:02:27.240> been<00:02:27.360> pretty

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
the Time Vault have been pretty

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.670 
the Time Vault have been pretty
effective<00:02:27.660> so<00:02:29.420> so<00:02:30.420> I'm<00:02:30.480> hoping<00:02:30.900> that<00:02:31.110> well

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
effective so so I'm hoping that well

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.199 
effective so so I'm hoping that well
first<00:02:31.950> of<00:02:32.070> all<00:02:32.130> psychic<00:02:32.550> doesn't<00:02:32.670> lower<00:02:33.030> the

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
first of all psychic doesn't lower the

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.830 
first of all psychic doesn't lower the
special<00:02:33.570> defense<00:02:33.840> too<00:02:34.080> much<00:02:34.850> and<00:02:35.850> that<00:02:36.570> the

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
special defense too much and that the

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.420 
special defense too much and that the
recovers<00:02:37.350> doesn't<00:02:38.600> I'd<00:02:39.600> rather<00:02:39.930> a<00:02:40.140> wait<00:02:40.860> to

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
recovers doesn't I'd rather a wait to

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.550 
recovers doesn't I'd rather a wait to
use<00:02:41.610> recover<00:02:42.000> until<00:02:42.270> it<00:02:42.600> really<00:02:43.050> only<00:02:43.200> knows

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
use recover until it really only knows

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.080 
use recover until it really only knows
recover<00:02:44.040> and<00:02:44.340> then<00:02:44.430> I<00:02:44.550> get<00:02:44.730> I'll<00:02:44.820> start

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
recover and then I get I'll start

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.140 
recover and then I get I'll start
spamming<00:02:45.420> it<00:02:45.660> when<00:02:45.780> it's<00:02:45.900> H<00:02:46.050> peaceful<00:02:47.150> its

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
spamming it when it's H peaceful its

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.600 
spamming it when it's H peaceful its
kind<00:02:48.390> of<00:02:48.420> what<00:02:48.540> I'm<00:02:48.630> hoping

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.330 

but<00:02:52.599> yeah<00:02:52.689> this<00:02:52.870> thing<00:02:53.140> is<00:02:53.170> a<00:02:53.290> real<00:02:53.530> pain<00:02:53.890> to<00:02:54.159> me

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
but yeah this thing is a real pain to me

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:00.630 
but yeah this thing is a real pain to me
so<00:02:54.700> I<00:02:54.939> don't<00:02:55.689> know<00:02:58.590> like<00:02:59.590> I<00:02:59.769> get<00:03:00.159> like<00:03:00.189> I<00:03:00.400> said<00:03:00.610> I

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
so I don't know like I get like I said I

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.220 
so I don't know like I get like I said I

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
many turns this has been it's actually

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:57.869 
many turns this has been it's actually
ridiculous<00:03:50.019> how<00:03:50.319> many<00:03:50.530> turns<00:03:50.799> it's<00:03:51.069> been<00:03:56.879> this

00:03:57.869 --> 00:03:57.879 
ridiculous how many turns it's been this

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:00.210 
ridiculous how many turns it's been this
fight<00:03:58.269> like<00:03:58.720> time<00:03:59.049> ball<00:03:59.230> should<00:03:59.410> be<00:03:59.500> automatic

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
fight like time ball should be automatic

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.059 
fight like time ball should be automatic
by<00:04:00.400> now<00:04:00.840> it<00:04:01.840> should<00:04:01.900> be<00:04:02.049> the<00:04:02.169> same<00:04:02.349> power<00:04:02.799> as<00:04:02.980> a

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:03.069 
by now it should be the same power as a

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:06.720 
by now it should be the same power as a
master<00:04:03.519> ball<00:04:04.260> not<00:04:05.260> not<00:04:05.919> even<00:04:05.949> close<00:04:06.489> to

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
master ball not not even close to

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:07.500 
master ball not not even close to
catching<00:04:06.760> it

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
catching it

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.420 
catching it
this<00:04:07.900> is<00:04:08.049> ridiculous<00:04:08.590> it's<00:04:08.709> the<00:04:08.829> second<00:04:09.280> time

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
this is ridiculous it's the second time

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:18.310 
this is ridiculous it's the second time
I've<00:04:09.699> tried<00:04:09.879> to<00:04:10.000> do<00:04:10.209> it

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:25.400
