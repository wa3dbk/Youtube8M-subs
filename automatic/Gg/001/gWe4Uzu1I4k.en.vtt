00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.750 
terrible it might it's partly me but
also<00:04:17.960> I<00:04:18.200> mean<00:04:18.410> you<00:04:18.739> can<00:04:18.859> ask<00:04:19.040> other<00:04:19.340> people<00:04:19.670> who

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
also I mean you can ask other people who

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.150 
also I mean you can ask other people who
have<00:04:19.850> used<00:04:20.030> it<00:04:20.290> they'll<00:04:21.290> probably<00:04:21.320> agree<00:04:21.920> this

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 
have used it they'll probably agree this

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.060 
have used it they'll probably agree this
thing<00:04:22.870> your<00:04:23.870> engine<00:04:24.170> choices<00:04:24.410> are<00:04:24.710> either<00:04:24.740> the

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
thing your engine choices are either the

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:28.270 
thing your engine choices are either the
stock<00:04:25.340> diesel<00:04:25.850> which<00:04:26.000> I<00:04:26.740> was<00:04:27.740> pretty<00:04:28.010> sure

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
stock diesel which I was pretty sure

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:29.710 
stock diesel which I was pretty sure
wasn't<00:04:28.550> going<00:04:28.670> to<00:04:28.730> work<00:04:28.850> but<00:04:29.150> I<00:04:29.300> tried<00:04:29.570> it

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
wasn't going to work but I tried it

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.690 
wasn't going to work but I tried it
anyway<00:04:29.810> just<00:04:30.050> for<00:04:30.290> the<00:04:30.470> hell<00:04:30.620> of<00:04:30.650> it<00:04:30.830> I<00:04:31.040> tried

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:31.700 
anyway just for the hell of it I tried

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.180 
anyway just for the hell of it I tried
modifying<00:04:32.630> it<00:04:33.080> didn't<00:04:33.290> work<00:04:33.440> so<00:04:33.890> then<00:04:34.040> this

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190 
modifying it didn't work so then this

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:35.980 
modifying it didn't work so then this
was<00:04:34.370> your<00:04:34.490> other<00:04:34.670> option<00:04:35.150> the<00:04:35.240> Australian<00:04:35.720> v8

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990 
was your other option the Australian v8

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.580 
was your other option the Australian v8
supercar<00:04:36.710> engine<00:04:37.100> ah<00:04:37.600> and<00:04:38.600> the<00:04:39.050> problem<00:04:39.320> with

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
supercar engine ah and the problem with

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.740 
supercar engine ah and the problem with
it<00:04:39.620> is<00:04:39.920> you<00:04:40.250> don't<00:04:40.430> get<00:04:40.670> you<00:04:40.850> know<00:04:40.880> the<00:04:41.420> torque

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
it is you don't get you know the torque

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.290 
it is you don't get you know the torque
or<00:04:41.930> whatever<00:04:42.200> you<00:04:42.350> want<00:04:42.620> until<00:04:43.520> it's<00:04:43.880> near<00:04:44.150> the

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 
or whatever you want until it's near the

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.750 
or whatever you want until it's near the
red<00:04:44.480> line<00:04:44.720> so<00:04:45.170> you<00:04:45.560> know<00:04:45.710> you<00:04:45.770> got<00:04:46.280> nothing

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:46.760 
red line so you know you got nothing

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.670 
red line so you know you got nothing
until<00:04:47.030> your<00:04:47.150> foots<00:04:47.390> all<00:04:47.510> the<00:04:47.690> way<00:04:47.780> down<00:04:48.020> which

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
until your foots all the way down which

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.640 
until your foots all the way down which
is<00:04:48.710> really<00:04:49.130> annoying<00:04:50.110> it's<00:04:51.110> kind<00:04:51.320> of<00:04:51.410> like<00:04:51.470> the

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
is really annoying it's kind of like the

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.680 
is really annoying it's kind of like the
exact<00:04:51.980> opposite<00:04:52.370> of<00:04:52.490> the<00:04:52.610> volvo<00:04:53.060> more<00:04:53.390> smoke

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.690 
exact opposite of the volvo more smoke

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:54.900 
exact opposite of the volvo more smoke
my<00:04:53.930> Volvo's

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
my Volvo's

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:56.190 
my Volvo's
you<00:04:55.090> need<00:04:55.240> the<00:04:55.360> torque<00:04:55.630> you<00:04:55.780> need<00:04:55.930> to<00:04:55.990> be<00:04:56.110> in

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:56.200 
you need the torque you need to be in

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.380 
you need the torque you need to be in
the<00:04:56.290> low<00:04:56.530> lower<00:04:57.160> ends<00:04:57.520> of<00:04:57.640> the<00:04:57.760> red<00:04:58.060> of<00:04:58.300> the

no torque till last minute
procrastinates<00:05:03.090> so<00:05:04.090> I<00:05:04.320> get<00:05:05.320> out<00:05:05.500> of<00:05:05.590> the<00:05:05.650> way

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830 
procrastinates so I get out of the way

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:11.130 
procrastinates so I get out of the way
um<00:05:08.340> so<00:05:09.340> yeah<00:05:09.550> but<00:05:10.090> it's<00:05:10.210> my<00:05:10.330> only<00:05:10.360> choice<00:05:10.780> and
