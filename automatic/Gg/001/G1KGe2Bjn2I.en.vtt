00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.269
 do not 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:15.820
 tel this is a game of the 80s in many 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.560
 the senses not only a gameplay the 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.930
 history of aesthetics really had 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.600
 two key things in the proposal 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.850
 tequila one that was a game of zombies 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:28.050
 and the other nonnegotiable thing was that 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.050
 had to happen the 80 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:36.440
 this kind of story is so pessimistic 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:38.570
 dystopian are classic from a time of 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.000
 late 70's and 80's with then with 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.830
 authors like richard corben novels like 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.780
 hello or america which is the novel of a 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.820
 character is even called Wayne and from 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.010
 there comes the surname of the 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.320
 character is that of stephen king the 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.330
 walking dead 'I am legend or the road 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.400
 the road not the lonely character 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.680
 who travels a road with a drama 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.559
 personal if you combine them with a 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:04.070
 aesthetic very typical of the 80 east this 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:07.130
 in this analog aspect that especially 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:10.070
 gray weather and the feeling of loneliness 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.110
 you combine it with this genre that is very 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.870
 in vogue in the 80s of the 90s as can 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.970
 be the first original support another 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:19.370
 world flashback which is that of the 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.610
 kinematic platforms in which the 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:24.740
 world is a character in itself 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:27.320
 You get something unique that goes around 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.960
 the 80 many senses not only at the level 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.070
 narrative at aesthetic level but to 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.460
 level 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.460
 playability 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.210
 It is a place where we can find 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.350
 last referents we all know everything 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.480
 this referring in terms of cinema 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.370
 television videogames a universe that 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:49.530
 is recognizable by most of 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:49.530
 possible public since it was was ideal 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.210
 we wanted or game in which the player 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.680
 he feels really helpless he 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.910
 it raises the limit and that's very 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.250
 interesting at the time of the hour of 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:00.720
 work and the 80 then the communications 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.150
 they are totally different there is no 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.900
 mobile phones for internet 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.900
 grandal is alone 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.020
 we have known a lot of little details 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.220
 they try to reinforce to reinforce that 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:18.020
 feeling that you really are 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:20.780
 living these moments of nostalgia with 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:23.450
 an example the game has a lot of 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:26.450
 secrets and collectibles including 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:29.209
 some little books had all the 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:32.390
 sense of the world that was in 1986 in 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:34.880
 create panting we create for example the 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:37.100
 most popular anime since dragon ball like 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.540
 it was because of daisy the mysterious one would be 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.140
 command animation in mansion that was 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:45.310
 some very popular comics in groups of 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.310
 dog how can it be bursting 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:52.299
 all these are small granites that 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:55.239
 we are leaving scattered throughout the universe 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:57.900
 a form of almost artisan production 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:00.430
 in the sense that each of the 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.500
 Steps 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:06.840
 they counted are made with the maximum 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.840
 attention and women
