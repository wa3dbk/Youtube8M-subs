00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 want to buy clear things but 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:07.200
 do not spend money on the marketplace 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.480
 I want this export point ru better 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.429
 3 random things link in description 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.799
 hello gangsters with you panda today 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.750
 us secrets bugs from subscriber evgeny 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.230
 forests let's see what's interesting to us 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.900
 told 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.539
 so the third skill bugs wonderful 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.910
 finger stealth raw ie give a third 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.320
 skill and if a charge flies somewhere 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.300
 in our case, bark attention to 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.220
 red charge means there is a number 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.260
 stealth p you can safely dos you and 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.200
 killing him is actually very useful 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.390
 thing you can check and then like this 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.840
 way to kill well or not to kill it too 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.840
 lucky 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.260
 The next chip bugs is that her ult 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.850
 works a little further than that 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.040
 shown in dota but in general they sin 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:52.900
 many skills and of course and so rikimaru 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:55.610
 standing behind the stone his silhouette is barely visible and 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:57.200
 ult it reaches himself quite well though 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.330
 show you ulta radius again 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.220
 such that is ult approximately to a stone 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:03.410
 rikimaru stands next to me no 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.600
 less ult calmly reaches now 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:08.450
 will let a little bit away yet again 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:11.260
 let's see how calm you get 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.850
 rikimaru although specified radius 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:16.510
 much smaller than real radius ults 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.510
 bed bugs 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:25.360
 but one more thing that we never did 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:28.120
 understood more precisely it seems to me she does not 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.660
 works like blink bugs can 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.540
 follow 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.920
 Ultimate antimag we very long jumped 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.200
 pancake forged tried to agree 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:38.380
 so that it is at the time blinka passed 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.960
 ulta but as it tells me 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.370
 my practice is yes in life it is practically 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.470
 impossible that is maybe once in 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:47.470
 billion times you can get exactly in 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:49.270
 Jump to throw in the ass but really 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:53.230
 it's there such milliseconds that get there 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:55.060
 not really i think it is unlikely 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:57.570
 the same is said with ulta zeus that 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.890
 supposedly help someone declare in blinks 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.720
 check it fails because 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.360
 need very little how much dad 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.950
 straight stuck in this blinky and then you can 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.990
 her ass to give us but naturally in 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.610
 Life they as you on will not wait 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.140
 so I think that, in principle, bling is not 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.630
 will these skills come out 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:17.520
 not ult antimaga not street because 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:19.720
 trite impossible to practice to get 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.060
 You can try it yourself but I think that 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.470
 you probably will not work miracle 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.120
 that moment you yourself see him 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.959
 instant that is it is not even a second 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.480
 it's milliseconds 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:30.040
 such things thanks for the great secrets 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.450
 if any of you come up with something 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.650
 interesting sure to shoot a video so 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.920
 write your secrets in the comments 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.920
 heroes
