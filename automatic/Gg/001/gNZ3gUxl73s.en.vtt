00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 we are in the office of the manufacturer 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.240
 phones died very soon the company 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.130
 will start the production of the phone at non zero 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.320
 and therefore employees these days have to 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.719
 work overtime draining at the table 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.490
 sits the chief engineer on his right 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.350
 assistant now they collect the dough you 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.230
 phone copies and debug build 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.330
 breaking it down into stages for the conveyor also 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.740
 shots you can see the director and the photographer 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.840
 which is my assistant and 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.449
 as a translator, let's take a look at the build 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.429
 first copies of the phone main 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.869
 engineer prepare the back cover 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.059
 This model is attached to the phone 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.070
 just a powerful double sided tape 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.140
 glass cover but this is not normal 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.200
 glass is a gorilla voice on assurances 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.430
 manufacturer protected from scratches and 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.620
 virtually unbreakable that further 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.600
 Be sure to check the chief engineer 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.070
 very neatly puts the back cover 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.320
 so as not to miss on glue 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.149
 the surface then glues the mesh 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.579
 dynamics and other small items there 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.070
 flashes and cameras checks everything and 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.989
 puts aside the assistant to this 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.579
 time is doing the main build on 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.710
 the part of the phone that represents 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.510
 is an object containing a touch screen and 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.810
 touch button starts pripyat 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.049
 motherboard first sticks 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.049
 Double-sided tape 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.900
 the motherboard inserts cameras and everything 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.900
 necessary plumes 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.460
 if something is not very good 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.200
 exactly everything back to getting better and after 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:46.000
 this plateau is simply set to 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:48.040
 place plume and snap do not think 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.930
 that absolutely everything is attached only to 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.250
 scotch this everywhere exists also 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.090
 required for more accurate installation 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.979
 items 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.600
 after correct installation fee 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.880
 screwed already fine 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.340
 screwed further with screws 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.710
 when buttons are made so that the loop does not 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.659
 popped up on bumps in this model they 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.440
 clamped another such planochka and 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:07.440
 two screws 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.840
 phone one more board is inserted and 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.569
 connects to the main with a loop 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.400
 plume is additionally fixed in 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:26.859
 unlike cheap plastic phone 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.170
 misery has a metal body this 

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:31.329
 a test batch of cases the engineer is very 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.250
 carefully checks the aluminum frame on 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:34.780
 marriage as in the first batches very 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.769
 there are often flaws 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.420
 Well, everything seems fine on the frame 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:42.579
 the last elements are stuck and 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:48.430
 the speaker is inserted and it connects to 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:51.299
 screen further screen and case 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.299
 twisted 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.080
 phone is installed battery 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.920
 additionally fixed special 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:07.580
 duct tape 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:10.220
 the phone is ready for the first time on the screen 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.660
 mediatek seen the inscription is not yet finished their 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.880
 I'm on the firmware provided 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.680
 processor manufacturer final 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.970
 version of the phone instead of this inscription 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.590
 will saver mind 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.900
 while the phone is sad he passes 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.030
 final inspection after loading 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:26.120
 the main functionality is checked 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:30.050
 both camera calls speaker well and so 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:31.610
 just the sound of all is small in this 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:31.970
 The phone uses a good camera from 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.030
 sony 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.680
 tests will show how good she is 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:39.459
 chief engineer check everything again 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:42.170
 functions and stick the back cover 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:44.239
 despite the fact that the back cover is just 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:47.630
 mounted on tape do not worry 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:50.000
 at the first fall it will not come off all 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:52.810
 checked by engineers neatly 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.810
 we press and 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:04:00.560
 the phone is almost ready to stick 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.600
 another piece of glass chamber until it all 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.609
 done slowly and not very smoothly with 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.410
 first time but collect the phone but not 

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:08.329
 developers and people and robots on 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:10.609
 the pipeline they will be 

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:13.220
 debugged will fall and 1 time where 

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:14.359
 need and one more check call 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.700
 number 112 

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:19.840
 test speaker phone well, like 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:22.729
 everything works here it is one of the first 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.979
 copies of Miller collected mainly 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:27.140
 manual engineer and designed to 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:29.960
 tests online stores on top 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:32.950
 microusb right slot for simok or one 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:35.600
 SIM cards and sd cards below the headset connector 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:38.300
 screen back surface and then the whole glass 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.850
 burned the eye here is such a telephone 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:44.090
 test sample battery 2500 milliampere 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:45.510
 hours weighs 145 grams but engineers do not 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.640
 only collect phones 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:49.680
 disassemble and the back cover is removed from 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:51.750
 using a sharp scalpel then 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.480
 the battery comes off well and everything is in reverse 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.950
 okay until the last screw apart 

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:58.230
 they are phones to understand 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:00.180
 how easy it is to disassemble 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:02.790
 The phone will have to be in production 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:04.680
 in order to repair unsuccessfully 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:06.930
 collected copies and in the repair 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.910
 so developers care not only 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:11.550
 fast and cheap build but also features 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:14.160
 quickly disassemble and repair like this 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:15.780
 looks like the main board of the phone in china 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.000
 there is practically no manufacturer 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:19.460
 with a full production cycle almost all 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.600
 components are ordered from 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:24.240
 specializing in this company 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:26.280
 so that faster and cheaper end up as a result 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.080
 the consumer gets the product collected from 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:30.180
 components produced well on 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.960
 dozens of productions and even 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:36.330
 for hundreds 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:38.070
 and here is the first crash test phone thrown 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:40.440
 from a height of 2 meters onto a concrete floor 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:44.540
 several times the screen is broken back 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:46.980
 glass lid is also glass 

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:54.240
 how can gorilla scratch you 

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:56.430
 Correct gorilla and eye running 1 test 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:58.290
 held without us but just decided 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:01.340
 scratch and were very surprised when 

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:01.340
 We learned that he still works 

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:18.640
 scratch a little test so hard 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:25.690
 I'm welcome 

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:33.130
 let's make you so strong 

00:07:13.869 --> 00:07:19.699
 so I once again went to the production 

00:07:17.029 --> 00:07:21.699
 where alkali acid and others are used 

00:07:19.699 --> 00:07:25.899
 unhealthy 

00:07:21.699 --> 00:07:25.899
 chemicals yes for nothing in life
