hey guys are doing a date kick kick to
her<00:00:02.970> since<00:00:03.300> I<00:00:03.510> haven't<00:00:03.720> done<00:00:03.870> one<00:00:03.990> for<00:00:04.049> a<00:00:04.200> while

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
her since I haven't done one for a while

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.320 
her since I haven't done one for a while
and<00:00:04.529> they're<00:00:04.710> my<00:00:04.890> setups<00:00:05.160> changed<00:00:05.609> a<00:00:05.790> little

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
and they're my setups changed a little

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:07.730 
and they're my setups changed a little
bit<00:00:06.540> anyway<00:00:06.810> so<00:00:07.020> I<00:00:07.170> thought<00:00:07.350> I'll<00:00:07.410> put<00:00:07.440> one<00:00:07.620> up

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
bit anyway so I thought I'll put one up

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:08.120 
bit anyway so I thought I'll put one up
anyway

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
anyway

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.100 
anyway
and<00:00:08.550> I<00:00:09.030> won't<00:00:09.150> have<00:00:09.210> any<00:00:09.300> sound<00:00:09.570> samples<00:00:09.929> but

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
and I won't have any sound samples but

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.480 
and I won't have any sound samples but
if<00:00:10.380> you<00:00:10.469> check<00:00:10.650> my<00:00:10.679> YouTube<00:00:11.070> page<00:00:11.099> there's

if you check my YouTube page there's
plenty<00:00:11.700> of<00:00:11.759> samples<00:00:11.880> of<00:00:12.120> the<00:00:12.240> kit<00:00:12.420> itself<00:00:12.509> and

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
plenty of samples of the kit itself and

for<00:00:15.059> you<00:00:15.509> to<00:00:15.599> check<00:00:15.780> out<00:00:15.929> so<00:00:16.139> there<00:00:16.560> we<00:00:16.619> go

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
for you to check out so there we go

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.340 
for you to check out so there we go
right<00:00:17.490> I'll<00:00:17.640> go<00:00:17.730> behind<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:18.029> kit<00:00:18.180> first<00:00:21.350> right

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
right I'll go behind the kit first right

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.910 
right I'll go behind the kit first right
as<00:00:23.189> you<00:00:23.279> can<00:00:23.369> see<00:00:23.550> it's<00:00:23.760> a<00:00:24.289> rather<00:00:25.289> nice<00:00:25.619> kit

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710

with<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.590> kick<00:00:34.739> drum<00:00:34.770> that's<00:00:35.100> an<00:00:35.250> 18<00:00:35.460> by<00:00:35.520> 14

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
with the kick drum that's an 18 by 14

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.250 
with the kick drum that's an 18 by 14
and<00:00:37.550> you<00:00:38.550> can<00:00:38.700> see<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:38.910> heavens<00:00:39.450> eq2

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260

I<00:00:45.360> think<00:00:47.000> head<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.530> inside<00:00:49.559> I've<00:00:49.800> just<00:00:49.980> got

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
I think head and inside I've just got

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.090 
I think head and inside I've just got
evidence<00:00:50.940> is<00:00:51.180> it<00:00:51.270> RG<00:00:51.629> t<00:00:52.079> part<00:00:52.440> of<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.949> leather

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
evidence is it RG t part of the leather

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.139 
evidence is it RG t part of the leather
it's<00:00:53.219> not<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.399> e<00:00:53.430> cube<00:00:53.670> had<00:00:53.820> it's<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.030> one

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
it's not the e cube had it's the one

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.029 
it's not the e cube had it's the one
with<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.420> with<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.719> gate<00:00:54.899> on<00:00:55.469> it<00:00:55.680> so<00:00:55.890> that's

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
with the with the gate on it so that's

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.410 
with the with the gate on it so that's
just<00:00:56.280> lightly<00:00:56.670> pressed<00:00:57.030> against<00:00:57.360> the
