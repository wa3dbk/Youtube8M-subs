00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:53.040 
be aware of their cutting capacity so if

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.380 
be aware of their cutting capacity so if
it's<00:00:53.160> a<00:00:53.220> light<00:00:53.400> cutter<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:54.030> you<00:00:54.240> have<00:00:54.330> a

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
it's a light cutter and you have a

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.450 
it's a light cutter and you have a
really<00:00:54.630> heavy<00:00:54.980> charm<00:00:55.980> here<00:00:56.220> that<00:00:56.340> you're

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
going to cut the top off you could kind

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.470 
going to cut the top off you could kind
of<00:00:58.320> ruin<00:00:58.590> your<00:00:58.710> cutters<00:00:59.040> so<00:00:59.520> make<00:01:00.060> sure<00:01:00.090> you're

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
of ruin your cutters so make sure you're

of ruin your cutters so make sure you're
using<00:01:00.510> an<00:01:00.870> appropriate<00:01:01.110> cutter<00:01:01.560> this<00:01:02.010> is<00:01:02.070> 24

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
using an appropriate cutter this is 24

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.729 
using an appropriate cutter this is 24
gauge<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.270> thickness<00:01:03.690> this<00:01:03.990> charm<00:01:04.320> so<00:01:04.589> this

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
gauge and thickness this charm so this

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.679 
gauge and thickness this charm so this
cutter<00:01:04.949> will<00:01:05.100> be<00:01:05.189> great<00:01:05.400> for<00:01:05.640> this<00:01:05.729> so<00:01:06.630> I'm

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
cutter will be great for this so I'm

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.569 
cutter will be great for this so I'm
just<00:01:06.869> going<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.020> come<00:01:07.229> in<00:01:07.259> and<00:01:07.619> cut<00:01:07.950> off<00:01:08.070> my<00:01:08.310> top

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:08.579 
just going to come in and cut off my top

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:15.710 
just going to come in and cut off my top
loop<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:13.700> then<00:01:14.700> you<00:01:14.790> can<00:01:14.940> see<00:01:15.150> it's<00:01:15.480> going<00:01:15.659> to

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
loop and then you can see it's going to

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.480 
loop and then you can see it's going to
need<00:01:15.870> a<00:01:15.930> little<00:01:16.380> bit<00:01:16.500> more<00:01:16.800> work<00:01:17.130> there

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
need a little bit more work there

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.550 
need a little bit more work there
there's<00:01:18.120> a<00:01:18.210> little<00:01:18.480> left<00:01:18.690> over<00:01:18.900> a<00:01:19.080> little<00:01:19.290> burr

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
there's a little left over a little burr

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.670 
there's a little left over a little burr
at<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.860> top<00:01:20.150> so<00:01:21.150> you're<00:01:21.930> going<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.170> come<00:01:22.440> in

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
at the top so you're going to come in

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.960 
at the top so you're going to come in
with<00:01:23.040> either<00:01:23.310> a<00:01:23.790> pretty<00:01:24.450> heavy<00:01:24.870> file<00:01:25.580> or<00:01:26.580> a

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
needle file depending on how much metal

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.480 
needle file depending on how much metal
you<00:01:30.180> need<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.510> remove<00:01:30.810> I<00:01:31.140> think<00:01:31.950> I'm<00:01:32.190> going<00:01:32.400> to
