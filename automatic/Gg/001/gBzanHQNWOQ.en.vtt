tonight on doing a little research and
Sophia<00:01:08.840> listen<00:01:09.840> we<00:01:10.020> can<00:01:10.229> do<00:01:10.530> that<00:01:10.880> so<00:01:12.080> then<00:01:13.080> we

Sophia listen we can do that so then we
thought<00:01:13.229> tonight<00:01:13.880> instead<00:01:14.880> of<00:01:14.940> just<00:01:15.450> riding<00:01:16.080> a

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
thought tonight instead of just riding a

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.250 
thought tonight instead of just riding a
whole<00:01:16.409> bunch<00:01:16.650> of<00:01:16.799> movements<00:01:17.460> we're<00:01:17.970> gonna

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:18.260 
whole bunch of movements we're gonna

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.870 
whole bunch of movements we're gonna
talk<00:01:19.260> to<00:01:19.440> you<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.620> little<00:01:19.799> bit<00:01:20.010> through<00:01:20.460> each

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
with a little canter let's see if we can

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:33.170 
with a little canter let's see if we can
get<00:01:26.430> through<00:01:26.790> chill<00:01:27.510> out<00:01:27.690> a<00:01:27.930> little<00:01:28.049> bit<00:01:32.180> so

very easily nor with the one you're not

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.359 
very easily nor with the one you're not
supposed<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.189> see<00:01:50.430> a<00:01:50.460> lot<00:01:50.759> of<00:01:50.790> driving<00:01:51.270> aids

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
supposed to see a lot of driving aids

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:55.990 
supposed to see a lot of driving aids
and<00:01:53.840> we're<00:01:54.840> just<00:01:55.020> going<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.200> start<00:01:55.560> the

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
and we're just going to start the

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.770 
and we're just going to start the
the<00:01:56.510> diagonal<00:01:57.200> try<00:01:57.530> to<00:01:57.590> ride<00:01:57.800> a<00:01:57.830> flying<00:01:58.040> change

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
the diagonal try to ride a flying change

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.630 
the diagonal try to ride a flying change
so<00:01:59.780> I<00:01:59.810> hmmm<00:02:00.110> chance<00:02:00.710> to<00:02:00.860> spend<00:02:01.130> much<00:02:01.310> time<00:02:01.340> with

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
so I hmmm chance to spend much time with

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.030 
so I hmmm chance to spend much time with
him<00:02:02.000> so<00:02:02.780> we're<00:02:03.020> just<00:02:03.050> going<00:02:03.350> to<00:02:03.410> get<00:02:03.560> used<00:02:03.800> to

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
him so we're just going to get used to

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.410 
him so we're just going to get used to
each<00:02:04.160> other<00:02:04.370> a<00:02:04.460> little<00:02:04.670> bit<00:02:04.850> and<00:02:05.030> see<00:02:05.240> how<00:02:05.360> it

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
each other a little bit and see how it

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:16.270 
each other a little bit and see how it
goes<00:02:11.170> so<00:02:12.170> this<00:02:12.470> is<00:02:12.500> the<00:02:13.040> both<00:02:13.520> sides<00:02:13.940> and<00:02:15.280> we

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
goes so this is the both sides and we

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.570 
goes so this is the both sides and we
slowly<00:02:16.760> gonna<00:02:17.209> work<00:02:17.540> our<00:02:17.780> way<00:02:17.810> up<00:02:17.959> to<00:02:18.740> do<00:02:19.370> the

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
slowly gonna work our way up to do the

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:31.990 
slowly gonna work our way up to do the
changes<00:02:20.450> its<00:02:21.430> frequencies<00:02:29.830> so<00:02:30.830> now<00:02:31.370> we<00:02:31.430> got<00:02:31.790> to

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
changes its frequencies so now we got to

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.990 
changes its frequencies so now we got to
a<00:02:32.030> diagonal<00:02:32.690> gonna<00:02:33.560> do<00:02:33.739> it<00:02:33.860> every<00:02:34.280> four

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
a diagonal gonna do it every four

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.600 
a diagonal gonna do it every four
strides<00:02:38.320> at<00:02:39.320> least<00:02:39.500> that's<00:02:39.770> the<00:02:39.890> plan<00:02:39.980> let's

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
strides at least that's the plan let's

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:58.090 
strides at least that's the plan let's
see<00:02:40.820> what<00:02:40.940> we<00:02:41.090> get<00:02:52.930> okay<00:02:56.650> let's<00:02:57.650> see<00:02:57.800> if<00:02:57.860> we<00:02:57.950> can

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
see what we get okay let's see if we can

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:17.759 
see what we get okay let's see if we can
do<00:02:58.220> every<00:02:58.520> three<00:02:58.790> spots<00:03:15.549> just<00:03:16.549> keep<00:03:16.940> going

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
do every three spots just keep going

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:20.350 
do every three spots just keep going
we'll<00:03:18.769> work<00:03:18.980> our<00:03:19.220> way<00:03:19.250> down<00:03:19.400> so<00:03:19.790> you<00:03:20.000> can<00:03:20.239> do

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360 
we'll work our way down so you can do

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.560 
we'll work our way down so you can do
late<00:03:20.540> on<00:03:20.920> fri<00:03:21.920> chick<00:03:22.250> is<00:03:22.430> every<00:03:22.730> stride<00:03:23.000> but<00:03:23.390> we

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
late on fri chick is every stride but we

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:45.680 
late on fri chick is every stride but we
