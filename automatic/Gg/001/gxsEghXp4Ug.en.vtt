00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.220 
player with an eligible number report
ineligible<00:00:29.010> but<00:00:29.820> then<00:00:30.000> line<00:00:30.240> up<00:00:30.420> as<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:30.869> slot

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230

receiver<00:00:31.260> a<00:00:31.740> regular<00:00:32.099> receiver<00:00:32.430> and<00:00:32.730> sort<00:00:32.940> of

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
receiver a regular receiver and sort of

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.430 
receiver a regular receiver and sort of
trick<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.360> defense<00:00:33.719> into<00:00:33.930> covering<00:00:34.290> them

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
trick the defense into covering them

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.110 
trick the defense into covering them
when<00:00:34.890> they<00:00:35.100> couldn't<00:00:35.280> in<00:00:35.430> fact<00:00:35.640> catch<00:00:35.880> a<00:00:35.969> pass

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
when they couldn't in fact catch a pass

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.600 
when they couldn't in fact catch a pass
legally<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:36.989> so<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.649> new<00:00:37.800> rule<00:00:38.040> says<00:00:38.340> you<00:00:38.460> can

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
legally and so the new rule says you can

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.760 
legally and so the new rule says you can
still<00:00:38.850> have<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:39.149> guy<00:00:39.390> who's<00:00:39.780> eligible<00:00:40.170> report

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
still have a guy who's eligible report

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.010 
still have a guy who's eligible report
ineligible<00:00:41.190> but<00:00:41.940> he<00:00:42.180> has<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.450> line<00:00:42.660> up<00:00:42.840> inside

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
ineligible but he has to line up inside

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.229 
ineligible but he has to line up inside
the<00:00:43.320> tackle<00:00:43.680> box<00:00:43.800> which<00:00:44.340> is<00:00:44.610> an<00:00:44.789> area<00:00:45.059> where

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
the tackle box which is an area where

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.700 
the tackle box which is an area where
the<00:00:45.420> defense<00:00:45.719> would<00:00:46.140> probably<00:00:46.440> would<00:00:46.559> not

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
the defense would probably would not

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.400 
the defense would probably would not
need<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.579> assign<00:00:48.480> somebody<00:00:48.899> they've<00:00:49.050> realized

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
need to assign somebody they've realized

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.810 
need to assign somebody they've realized
he<00:00:49.559> was<00:00:49.680> an<00:00:49.739> ineligible<00:00:50.100> receiver<00:00:50.309> and

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
he was an ineligible receiver and

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.549 
he was an ineligible receiver and
therefore<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.780> sort<00:00:52.020> of<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.140> trickeration

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
therefore the sort of the trickeration

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.970 
therefore the sort of the trickeration
of<00:00:53.070> that<00:00:53.309> of<00:00:53.910> that<00:00:54.449> scheme<00:00:54.870> is<00:00:55.559> no<00:00:55.770> longer

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
of that of that scheme is no longer

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.920 
of that of that scheme is no longer
available<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:57.149> Patriots<00:00:57.570> or<00:00:57.629> anybody

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
available to the Patriots or anybody

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.000 
available to the Patriots or anybody
else<00:00:58.050> but<00:00:58.199> I<00:00:58.289> kind<00:00:58.500> of<00:00:58.559> thought<00:00:58.680> I<00:00:58.739> don't<00:00:58.920> know

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
else but I kind of thought I don't know

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.560 
else but I kind of thought I don't know
about<00:00:59.100> you<00:00:59.280> I<00:00:59.309> kind<00:00:59.640> of<00:00:59.670> thought<00:00:59.850> it<00:01:00.090> was<00:01:00.539> a

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
about you I kind of thought it was a

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.510 
about you I kind of thought it was a
one-shot<00:01:00.989> deal<00:01:01.050> you<00:01:02.039> know<00:01:02.129> as<00:01:02.190> soon<00:01:02.340> as<00:01:02.430> they

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
one-shot deal you know as soon as they

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.250 
one-shot deal you know as soon as they
got<00:01:02.670> exposed<00:01:03.090> as<00:01:03.449> something<00:01:03.780> that's<00:01:03.870> legal

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
got exposed as something that's legal

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.840 
got exposed as something that's legal
but<00:01:04.290> not<00:01:04.559> really<00:01:04.769> within<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.129> spirit<00:01:05.519> of<00:01:05.729> the

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
but not really within the spirit of the

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.399 
but not really within the spirit of the
rules<00:01:06.030> that<00:01:06.180> would<00:01:06.450> be<00:01:06.510> closed<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:07.200> that

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
rules that would be closed and that

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.719 
rules that would be closed and that
loophole<00:01:07.590> now<00:01:07.950> is<00:01:08.130> closed<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:08.610> the

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
loophole now is closed and the

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.580 
loophole now is closed and the
motivation<00:01:09.240> for<00:01:09.360> making<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.689> change<00:01:09.900> is<00:01:10.170> to

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
motivation for making the change is to

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.410 
motivation for making the change is to
ease<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:11.189> pressure<00:01:11.490> on<00:01:11.610> officials<00:01:12.150> give<00:01:12.299> them

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
ease the pressure on officials give them

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.120 
ease the pressure on officials give them
one<00:01:12.540> less<00:01:12.689> thing<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:12.960> have<00:01:13.110> to<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:13.650> wonder<00:01:13.979> what

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
one less thing to have to to wonder what

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.310 
one less thing to have to to wonder what
to<00:01:14.250> do<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:15.030> little<00:01:15.240> bit<00:01:15.360> I<00:01:15.390> think<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.840> NFL

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
to do and a little bit I think the NFL

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.840 
to do and a little bit I think the NFL
is<00:01:16.409> really<00:01:16.619> sensitive<00:01:17.009> it<00:01:17.220> seems<00:01:17.610> like

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
is really sensitive it seems like

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.520 
is really sensitive it seems like
sometimes<00:01:18.630> with<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:18.780> competition<00:01:19.290> committee

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
sometimes with a competition committee

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.999 
sometimes with a competition committee
to<00:01:19.860> not<00:01:20.520> allow<00:01:20.909> teams<00:01:21.299> to<00:01:21.509> sort<00:01:22.320> of<00:01:22.409> manipulate

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
to not allow teams to sort of manipulate

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.530 
to not allow teams to sort of manipulate
the<00:01:23.189> rules<00:01:23.340> to<00:01:23.670> their<00:01:23.790> advantage<00:01:24.000> they<00:01:24.330> want

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
the rules to their advantage they want

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.570 
the rules to their advantage they want
you<00:01:25.080> know<00:01:25.170> obviously<00:01:26.100> there's<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.369> rules

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
you know obviously there's the rules

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:27.920 
you know obviously there's the rules
things<00:01:26.790> you<00:01:26.970> can't<00:01:27.210> do<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:27.600> then<00:01:27.689> there's<00:01:27.840> a

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
things you can't do and then there's a

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.630 
things you can't do and then there's a
spirit<00:01:28.350> of<00:01:28.530> things<00:01:28.860> they<00:01:29.040> don't<00:01:29.130> want<00:01:29.400> you<00:01:29.549> to

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
spirit of things they don't want you to

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.460 
spirit of things they don't want you to
