or probably most likely was available

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.340 
or probably most likely was available
exclusively<00:03:05.490> at<00:03:05.910> Target<00:03:06.090> so<00:03:06.600> goes<00:03:07.110> right

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
exclusively at Target so goes right

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:08.270

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
them for you may find the whole set for

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:17.780 
them for you may find the whole set for
a<00:03:16.110> cheaper<00:03:16.320> price<00:03:16.470> if<00:03:16.800> they<00:03:17.250> still<00:03:17.459> have<00:03:17.610> them

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
a cheaper price if they still have them

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.759 
a cheaper price if they still have them
alright<00:03:18.720> so<00:03:18.870> clone<00:03:19.110> trooper<00:03:19.350> boost<00:03:19.560> I

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
alright so clone trooper boost I

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:22.040 
alright so clone trooper boost I
definitely<00:03:20.220> give<00:03:20.340> them<00:03:20.400> a<00:03:20.519> rating<00:03:20.880> of<00:03:21.030> a<00:03:21.360> solid

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
definitely give them a rating of a solid

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:23.960 
definitely give them a rating of a solid
10<00:03:22.290> out<00:03:22.530> of<00:03:22.590> 10<00:03:22.950> calling<00:03:23.400> for<00:03:23.610> helmets

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970
