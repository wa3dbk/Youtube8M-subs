00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
of the potion we'll see in a second but

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.600 
of the potion we'll see in a second but
I<00:01:03.180> think<00:01:04.170> it's<00:01:04.290> one<00:01:04.470> of<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.650> harming<00:01:05.129> potions

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.880 
I think it's one of the harming potions
but<00:01:05.670> basically<00:01:06.240> what<00:01:06.450> it<00:01:06.479> does<00:01:06.570> is<00:01:06.900> it<00:01:06.960> deals

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890
