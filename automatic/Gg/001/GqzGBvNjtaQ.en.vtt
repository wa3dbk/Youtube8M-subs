00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.970
 then strips the photos 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.229
 2 do as 

00:00:09.229 --> 00:00:13.509
 This area was preserved to learn the accident before and after when 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:16.059
 Endesa to buy them perfect 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.119
 basking in, let's start, you know what the correct exposure is 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:21.869
 yes yes yes yes yes I know 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.960
 the correct exposure for the subject that these photographs is not the one you 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.730
 allows you to capture all the particulars 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.530
 it is possible but it measures the amount of light in the scene and that suggests the 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.860
 diaphragm combination and the city true 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.500
 it is a perfect exhibition of manual 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.930
 vertele be perfectly but look if you want to improve a bit you need is 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.790
 trying to move forward prevents interpreting the exhibition not so much in terms of 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.060
 correct exposure but in a slightly more creative sense that means 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.890
 creative is not a numerical data 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.940
 do not look at many manuals on how to get a correct exposure 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.350
 in reality there is no correct exposure every subject can be 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.780
 interpreted there are virtually immense possibilities of exhibitions 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.630
 correct because it depends on the photographer 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.740
 that interprets the subject according to the value of their tones 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.500
 I thought there was a correct exposure and that all the others were 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.270
 wrong 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.470
 does not look depend on the situation imagines that you are in a forest 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.470
 where a strong light through the foliage of the trees and will draw 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.610
 field strong light designs 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.580
 neither the film nor the digital sensor have the ability to capture these 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.560
 strong changes in hue between brightly lit areas on the ground and 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.710
 the areas in the darkest shadows under the trees consequently 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.040
 you need to arrive at an interpretation exposes correctly for areas in 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.630
 light by dropping all the shaded parts on the black or exposing 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.830
 correctly the shadow parts burning all the areas that are in 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:49.670
 the light 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.040
 I wanted that in these cases it will be enough to make a half hahahaha 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.460
 gibbs is not good the measure is more or less like saying 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.700
 if I put the head to the freezer and those who managed to have a temperature 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.590
 optimal media for my body you really need to understand that the values 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.060
 means very often 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.720
 are not enough to cover the entire gamut of shades present at dinner is 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.930
 like a short blanket that is pulled on one side and the other and not enough to cover 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.640
 all therefore that is the photographer who interprets without moving towards the 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.140
 shadow colors the bidasoa of the lights opposing the exhibition 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.790
 correct in the light values ​​missing forgetting the shadows yes 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.340
 periods if I can not correctly expose the shadow areas and the 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.419
 areas of the altars that I can do 

00:02:30.419 --> 00:02:33.719
 well then exactly where the creativity photographer intervenes 

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:37.340
 learn to evaluate your images these approaches in expository terms 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:41.909
 if in the case of the forest with strong lights and very clear shadows of fides give 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:44.689
 in the correct exposure for the lights 

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:49.180
 surely in your composition you will give greater importance to the parties of the dinner 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.259
 which is very bright 

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:53.019
 and Arabs 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:56.780
 bring in less important areas to do less 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.030
 the shadow areas on the contrary if you decide to expose for the shadows will be 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.970
 the high light areas burned will have to occupy a lower place in your 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.169
 frame or at least not in significant areas 

00:03:08.169 --> 00:03:11.480
 in short the concept is that the correct exposure is not worth saying 

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:15.429
 yes but you do not find this position a bit extreme 

00:03:15.429 --> 00:03:16.560
 Could appeared 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.300
 considers that the explosimeter is in any way an instrument a 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.869
 mechanical instrument that gives us data 

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:26.600
 but that sensitivity of the photographer who should filter this data 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.260
 and through his sensitivity he must interpret the use of the best 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.260
 way to give the image the final result that I want to have 

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:37.039
 and here among the theme of creativity 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:41.300
 e is exactly what the photographer's creativity comes up with 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.370
 interpret the data that these metro give us through their own 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.230
 sensitivity to get to an image where there is a new tonal exposure 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.110
 of the image you want and therefore the final question 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:54.209
 which the correct exposure but where do I want the middle to fall 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:55.110
 that act 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.439
 the medium gray theme 

00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:00.879
 can you explain me the best you are a clarification and thanks is fine 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:01.769
 then now we will talk
