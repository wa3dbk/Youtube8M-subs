00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
and I'm pulling it towards the middle

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.469 
and I'm pulling it towards the middle
there<00:01:42.079> and<00:01:43.079> now<00:01:43.680> what<00:01:43.890> I<00:01:43.950> would<00:01:44.070> do<00:01:44.369> in<00:01:44.610> this

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
there and now what I would do in this

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.560 
there and now what I would do in this
case<00:01:45.840> would<00:01:46.079> be<00:01:46.170> take<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.439> tail<00:01:47.270> bring<00:01:48.270> it<00:01:48.390> up

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
case would be take the tail bring it up

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.139 
case would be take the tail bring it up
against<00:01:49.229> making<00:01:50.100> sure<00:01:50.310> I'm<00:01:50.430> not<00:01:50.579> creating<00:01:51.119> new

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
against making sure I'm not creating new

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.010 
against making sure I'm not creating new
creases<00:01:52.020> I<00:01:53.240> pull<00:01:54.240> it<00:01:54.360> all<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.509> way<00:01:54.659> up<00:01:54.689> to<00:01:54.899> the

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
creases I pull it all the way up to the

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.620 
creases I pull it all the way up to the
collar<00:01:55.549> so<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.579> collar<00:01:56.909> has<00:01:57.180> something<00:01:57.600> to

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
collar so the collar has something to

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.870 
collar so the collar has something to
protect<00:01:57.840> it<00:01:58.259> it's<00:01:58.439> not<00:01:58.590> just<00:01:58.829> hanging<00:01:59.759> out

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
protect it it's not just hanging out

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.590 
protect it it's not just hanging out
there<00:01:59.939> in<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.390> breeze<00:02:00.659> by<00:02:00.930> itself<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:02.600> there

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
there in the breeze by itself and there

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.450 
there in the breeze by itself and there
are<00:02:03.750> different<00:02:04.079> ways<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:04.259> do<00:02:04.619> this<00:02:04.890> in<00:02:05.219> this

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
are different ways to do this in this

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.809 
are different ways to do this in this
case<00:02:05.759> this<00:02:06.000> is<00:02:06.180> a<00:02:06.210> very<00:02:06.509> thin<00:02:07.580> material<00:02:08.580> and

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
case this is a very thin material and

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.110 
case this is a very thin material and
it's<00:02:08.940> making<00:02:09.420> a<00:02:09.599> nice<00:02:09.780> flat<00:02:10.140> little<00:02:10.379> package

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
it's making a nice flat little package

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.259 
it's making a nice flat little package
and<00:02:12.750> it<00:02:13.560> could<00:02:13.800> be<00:02:13.980> done<00:02:14.220> just<00:02:15.209> like<00:02:15.390> this

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:17.269 
and it could be done just like this

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:19.790 
and it could be done just like this
