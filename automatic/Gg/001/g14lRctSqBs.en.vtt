for<00:00:00.149> today's<00:00:00.420> am<00:00:00.690> in<00:00:00.840> five<00:00:01.020> we're<00:00:01.199> going<00:00:01.319> to

00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:01.380 
for today's am in five we're going to

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:03.260 
for today's am in five we're going to
talk<00:00:01.530> about<00:00:01.560> atomic<00:00:02.399> medication

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270 
talk about atomic medication

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.749 
talk about atomic medication
specifically<00:00:03.870> topical<00:00:04.529> ones<00:00:04.710> now<00:00:05.520> there's<00:00:05.700> a

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
specifically topical ones now there's a

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:07.309 
specifically topical ones now there's a
lot<00:00:05.940> of<00:00:06.060> different<00:00:06.299> kind<00:00:06.480> of<00:00:06.540> medications<00:00:07.170> we

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
lot of different kind of medications we

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:08.720 
lot of different kind of medications we
can<00:00:07.440> apply<00:00:07.710> to<00:00:07.740> the<00:00:08.069> eye<00:00:08.099> and<00:00:08.550> there<00:00:08.639> was

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
can apply to the eye and there was

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.520 
can apply to the eye and there was
actually<00:00:09.000> this<00:00:09.090> coding<00:00:09.540> system<00:00:09.960> developed

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
actually this coding system developed

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.440 
actually this coding system developed
that<00:00:11.070> color<00:00:11.550> codes<00:00:11.940> the<00:00:12.179> different

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
that color codes the different

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.270 
that color codes the different
medication<00:00:12.960> classes<00:00:13.440> so<00:00:13.620> it's<00:00:13.769> just<00:00:13.920> a<00:00:14.070> little

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
medication classes so it's just a little

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.730 
medication classes so it's just a little
bit<00:00:14.429> safer<00:00:14.759> to<00:00:15.630> apply<00:00:15.839> these<00:00:16.020> medications<00:00:16.410> so

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
bit safer to apply these medications so

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:17.830 
bit safer to apply these medications so
we're<00:00:16.830> going<00:00:16.920> to<00:00:17.010> go<00:00:17.100> through<00:00:17.340> each<00:00:17.369> of<00:00:17.670> these

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:17.840 
we're going to go through each of these

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.269 
we're going to go through each of these
color<00:00:18.840> schemes<00:00:19.050> and<00:00:19.470> then<00:00:19.650> talk<00:00:19.980> about<00:00:20.010> a

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
color schemes and then talk about a

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:21.529 
color schemes and then talk about a
couple<00:00:20.490> of<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:20.939> ones<00:00:21.029> that<00:00:21.150> we<00:00:21.300> use<00:00:21.330> most

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
couple of the ones that we use most

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.359 
couple of the ones that we use most
commonly<00:00:21.769> so<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:22.859> first<00:00:23.010> one<00:00:23.130> we'll<00:00:23.250> talk

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
commonly so the first one we'll talk

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.279 
commonly so the first one we'll talk
about<00:00:23.430> is<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.939> white<00:00:24.330> or<00:00:24.510> clear<00:00:24.689> caps<00:00:25.050> these

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
about is the white or clear caps these

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:26.900 
about is the white or clear caps these
are<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.529> topical<00:00:25.980> anaesthetics<00:00:26.490> and<00:00:26.670> we<00:00:26.760> use

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
are the topical anaesthetics and we use

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.509 
are the topical anaesthetics and we use
these<00:00:27.119> all<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.869> time<00:00:28.080> in<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.320> ER<00:00:28.500> this<00:00:29.099> helps

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
these all the time in the ER this helps

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.400 
these all the time in the ER this helps
us<00:00:29.640> do<00:00:29.849> a<00:00:29.880> good<00:00:30.210> exam<00:00:30.570> for<00:00:30.869> a<00:00:30.900> patient<00:00:31.199> that<00:00:31.230> has

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
us do a good exam for a patient that has

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.470 
us do a good exam for a patient that has
a<00:00:31.439> lot<00:00:31.650> of<00:00:31.740> eye<00:00:31.859> pain<00:00:32.160> we<00:00:32.430> use<00:00:32.850> it<00:00:33.030> for<00:00:33.239> doing

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
a lot of eye pain we use it for doing

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.389 
a lot of eye pain we use it for doing
the<00:00:33.690> tonopen<00:00:34.110> exam<00:00:34.500> to<00:00:34.710> get<00:00:34.860> into<00:00:35.100> ocular

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
the tonopen exam to get into ocular

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.459 
the tonopen exam to get into ocular
pressure<00:00:35.640> it's<00:00:36.090> good<00:00:36.630> pain<00:00:36.899> relief<00:00:36.930> whether

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
pressure it's good pain relief whether

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:38.990 
pressure it's good pain relief whether
in<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:37.890> ER<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:38.309> we<00:00:38.399> can<00:00:38.550> also<00:00:38.670> use<00:00:38.850> it<00:00:38.910> for

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
in the ER and we can also use it for

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.880 
in the ER and we can also use it for
foreign<00:00:39.420> body<00:00:39.629> removal<00:00:39.840> this<00:00:40.559> is<00:00:40.739> not

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
foreign body removal this is not

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.500 
foreign body removal this is not
something<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:41.309> prescribe<00:00:41.700> though<00:00:41.940> it's<00:00:42.210> just

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
something to prescribe though it's just

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.750 
something to prescribe though it's just
for<00:00:42.719> use<00:00:42.870> in<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.170> ER<00:00:43.469> so<00:00:43.860> there's<00:00:44.309> two<00:00:44.579> classes

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
for use in the ER so there's two classes

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.790 
for use in the ER so there's two classes
the<00:00:45.090> esters<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.629> M<00:00:45.750> is<00:00:45.960> probably<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.680> one

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
the esters and the M is probably the one

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.470 
the esters and the M is probably the one
that<00:00:46.920> we<00:00:46.980> have<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.309> most<00:00:47.460> commonly<00:00:47.910> in<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.210> ER

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
that we have the most commonly in the ER

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.290 
that we have the most commonly in the ER
leaves<00:00:48.780> all<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.170> time<00:00:49.320> is<00:00:49.469> tetra<00:00:49.980> cane<00:00:50.190> it<00:00:51.120> is

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
leaves all the time is tetra cane it is

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.729 
leaves all the time is tetra cane it is
a<00:00:51.329> little<00:00:51.629> more<00:00:51.780> irritating<00:00:52.350> you<00:00:52.440> always<00:00:52.620> have

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
a little more irritating you always have

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:53.900 
a little more irritating you always have
to<00:00:52.829> tell<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.070> patients<00:00:53.489> that<00:00:53.579> it's<00:00:53.699> going<00:00:53.850> to

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
to tell the patients that it's going to

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.060 
to tell the patients that it's going to
burn<00:00:54.090> just<00:00:54.420> for<00:00:54.660> about<00:00:55.020> five<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.500> ten<00:00:55.620> seconds

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
burn just for about five to ten seconds

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.130 
burn just for about five to ten seconds
before<00:00:56.309> it<00:00:56.550> feels<00:00:56.760> better<00:00:57.000> but<00:00:57.719> it<00:00:57.809> does<00:00:57.960> last

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
before it feels better but it does last

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.689 
before it feels better but it does last
up<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.379> thirty<00:00:58.680> minutes<00:00:58.890> with<00:00:59.160> so<00:00:59.250> allows<00:00:59.460> you

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
up to thirty minutes with so allows you

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.049 
up to thirty minutes with so allows you
to<00:00:59.910> do<00:01:00.270> a<00:01:00.300> full<00:01:00.539> exam<00:01:00.739> next<00:01:01.739> up<00:01:01.859> is<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.250> red<00:01:02.760> cap

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
to do a full exam next up is the red cap

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.210 
to do a full exam next up is the red cap
so<00:01:03.359> these<00:01:03.510> are<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.899> micro<00:01:04.619> addicts<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.129> the

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
so these are the micro addicts and the

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.670 
so these are the micro addicts and the
cyclop<00:01:05.670> lyrics<00:01:06.180> so<00:01:07.049> let's<00:01:07.200> talk<00:01:07.320> a<00:01:07.380> little<00:01:07.470> bit

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
cyclop lyrics so let's talk a little bit

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.020 
cyclop lyrics so let's talk a little bit
about<00:01:07.770> what<00:01:08.070> these<00:01:08.189> two<00:01:08.369> basically<00:01:08.820> it's

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
about what these two basically it's

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.580 
about what these two basically it's
going<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:09.360> dilate<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:09.900> eye<00:01:10.049> that's<00:01:10.409> how<00:01:10.530> you

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
going to dilate the eye that's how you

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.350 
going to dilate the eye that's how you
can<00:01:10.770> remember<00:01:11.010> these<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.490> red<00:01:11.670> caps<00:01:11.939> dilate

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
can remember these the red caps dilate

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.120 
can remember these the red caps dilate
the<00:01:12.390> eye<00:01:12.510> so<00:01:13.140> first<00:01:13.350> let's<00:01:13.560> talk<00:01:13.680> about<00:01:13.740> the

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
the eye so first let's talk about the

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.399 
the eye so first let's talk about the
mido<00:01:14.549> attic<00:01:15.030> so<00:01:15.119> these<00:01:15.270> are<00:01:15.479> some<00:01:15.930> paths<00:01:16.140> of

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
mido attic so these are some paths of

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:16.999 
mido attic so these are some paths of
memetics

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
memetics

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.460 
memetics
it's<00:01:17.490> going<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:17.820> paralyze<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.689> IRA<00:01:18.869> sphincter

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
it's going to paralyze the IRA sphincter

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.960 
it's going to paralyze the IRA sphincter
which<00:01:19.650> causes<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.220> eye<00:01:20.250> to<00:01:20.369> die<00:01:20.700> early

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
which causes the eye to die early

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.789 
which causes the eye to die early
one<00:01:21.720> of<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.869> common<00:01:22.110> ones<00:01:22.290> that<00:01:22.439> we<00:01:22.500> use<00:01:22.619> is

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
one of the common ones that we use is

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.830 
one of the common ones that we use is

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.200 
might not actually use them in the ER
too<00:01:28.290> often<00:01:28.650> these<00:01:28.799> are<00:01:28.979> more<00:01:29.130> for<00:01:29.210> diagnostic

the whole my atropine is a little

generic I'm just listing the dollar
amounts<00:02:31.540> here<00:02:31.660> because<00:02:31.930> some<00:02:32.140> of<00:02:32.170> these<00:02:32.320> can

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
amounts here because some of these can

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:33.960 
amounts here because some of these can
be<00:02:32.620> very<00:02:32.800> expensive<00:02:33.400> and<00:02:33.459> you<00:02:33.550> have<00:02:33.580> to<00:02:33.820> be<00:02:33.940> a

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
be very expensive and you have to be a

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.280 
be very expensive and you have to be a
little<00:02:34.090> careful<00:02:34.300> when<00:02:34.570> prescribing<00:02:35.020> them

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
little careful when prescribing them

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:36.810 
little careful when prescribing them
that<00:02:35.770> your<00:02:35.860> patients<00:02:36.250> are<00:02:36.370> actually<00:02:36.459> going<00:02:36.730> to

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
that your patients are actually going to

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.210 
that your patients are actually going to
be<00:02:36.910> able<00:02:37.000> to<00:02:37.180> fill<00:02:37.420> the<00:02:37.510> prescriptions<00:02:38.220> all

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
be able to fill the prescriptions all

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.470 
be able to fill the prescriptions all
right<00:02:39.340> now<00:02:39.520> let's<00:02:39.670> talk<00:02:39.790> about<00:02:39.910> the<00:02:40.120> mitotic

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
right now let's talk about the mitotic

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.180 
right now let's talk about the mitotic
so<00:02:40.840> these<00:02:40.990> are<00:02:41.080> going<00:02:41.170> to<00:02:41.230> be<00:02:41.350> the<00:02:41.470> green<00:02:41.770> caps

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
so these are going to be the green caps

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.130 
so these are going to be the green caps
there's<00:02:42.760> really<00:02:42.970> only<00:02:43.060> one<00:02:43.300> use<00:02:43.870> some

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
there's really only one use some

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.930 
there's really only one use some
thinking<00:02:44.620> that<00:02:44.740> we'll<00:02:44.860> really<00:02:45.280> see<00:02:45.550> using<00:02:45.760> it

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
thinking that we'll really see using it

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.180 
thinking that we'll really see using it
in<00:02:46.030> the<00:02:46.090> ER<00:02:46.390> next<00:02:46.810> treatment<00:02:47.230> for<00:02:47.410> acute<00:02:47.680> angle

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190

closure glaucoma and your main one here
you're<00:02:50.650> going<00:02:50.770> to<00:02:50.860> use<00:02:50.980> it's<00:02:51.130> a<00:02:51.220> pilocarpine

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
you're going to use it's a pilocarpine

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.780 
you're going to use it's a pilocarpine
2%<00:02:52.450> so<00:02:52.810> just<00:02:53.020> as<00:02:53.110> a<00:02:53.140> quick<00:02:53.380> review<00:02:53.800> it's<00:02:54.489> going

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
2% so just as a quick review it's going

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.479 
2% so just as a quick review it's going
to<00:02:55.000> constrict<00:02:55.810> the<00:02:55.959> pupil<00:02:55.989> the<00:02:56.470> iris<00:02:57.310> is<00:02:57.430> going

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
to constrict the pupil the iris is going

00:02:57.489 --> 00:02:59.280 
to constrict the pupil the iris is going
to<00:02:57.670> pull<00:02:57.850> over<00:02:57.970> into<00:02:58.180> the<00:02:58.330> center<00:02:58.600> and<00:02:58.750> that's

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
to pull over into the center and that's

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.130 
to pull over into the center and that's
going<00:02:59.650> to<00:02:59.770> open<00:03:00.400> up<00:03:00.580> the<00:03:00.790> angle<00:03:01.300> here<00:03:01.510> allowing

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
going to open up the angle here allowing

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.020 
going to open up the angle here allowing
in<00:03:02.320> the<00:03:02.470> schlemm's<00:03:02.739> canal<00:03:02.860> and<00:03:03.310> allows<00:03:03.610> the

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
tan caps these are the anti-infective

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.320 
tan caps these are the anti-infective
and<00:03:08.739> one<00:03:09.220> quick<00:03:09.400> mention<00:03:09.640> here<00:03:10.000> is<00:03:10.090> that<00:03:10.209> you

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
and one quick mention here is that you

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:11.670 
and one quick mention here is that you
have<00:03:10.360> the<00:03:10.630> option<00:03:10.989> when<00:03:11.110> prescribing<00:03:11.500> to

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
have the option when prescribing to

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.130 
have the option when prescribing to
either<00:03:11.980> prescribe<00:03:12.850> drops<00:03:13.209> or<00:03:13.450> pointment

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
either prescribe drops or pointment

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.440 
either prescribe drops or pointment
as<00:03:14.410> far<00:03:14.680> as<00:03:14.770> the<00:03:14.920> drops<00:03:15.250> u10<00:03:15.970> have<00:03:16.180> to

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
as far as the drops u10 have to

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.090 
as far as the drops u10 have to
administer<00:03:17.080> these<00:03:17.260> more<00:03:17.560> frequently

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
administer these more frequently

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.380 
administer these more frequently
throughout<00:03:18.280> the<00:03:18.459> day<00:03:18.610> of<00:03:18.880> a<00:03:18.940> couple<00:03:19.269> hours

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
throughout the day of a couple hours

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.120 
throughout the day of a couple hours
because<00:03:19.810> they're<00:03:20.080> absorbed<00:03:20.440> more<00:03:20.560> quickly<00:03:20.830> so

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
because they're absorbed more quickly so

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.580 
because they're absorbed more quickly so
that's<00:03:21.190> one<00:03:21.430> drawback<00:03:21.930> but<00:03:22.930> the<00:03:23.049> positive<00:03:23.500> is

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
that's one drawback but the positive is

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:24.900 
that's one drawback but the positive is
that<00:03:23.620> there's<00:03:23.890> a<00:03:23.950> little<00:03:24.160> bit<00:03:24.310> less<00:03:24.549> blurred

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
that there's a little bit less blurred

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:26.520 
that there's a little bit less blurred
vision<00:03:25.120> they<00:03:25.360> don't<00:03:25.510> coat<00:03:25.750> the<00:03:25.959> eye<00:03:25.989> as<00:03:26.290> much

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
vision they don't coat the eye as much

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.170 
vision they don't coat the eye as much
as<00:03:26.709> joint<00:03:26.980> meant<00:03:27.130> as<00:03:27.370> so<00:03:27.850> it<00:03:27.910> might<00:03:28.000> be<00:03:28.060> a

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
as joint meant as so it might be a

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.789 
as joint meant as so it might be a
little<00:03:28.330> bit<00:03:28.480> better<00:03:28.630> for<00:03:28.900> say<00:03:29.110> an<00:03:29.230> adult<00:03:29.530> to

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799 
little bit better for say an adult to

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:31.830 
little bit better for say an adult to
use<00:03:30.090> appointments<00:03:31.090> lasts<00:03:31.360> a<00:03:31.540> little<00:03:31.690> longer

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
use appointments lasts a little longer

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.539 
use appointments lasts a little longer
so<00:03:32.410> that<00:03:32.530> you<00:03:32.590> don't<00:03:32.769> have<00:03:32.920> to<00:03:33.070> apply<00:03:33.310> them<00:03:33.370> as

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:33.549 
so that you don't have to apply them as

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:35.160 
so that you don't have to apply them as
frequently<00:03:34.030> sometimes<00:03:34.840> they<00:03:34.900> can<00:03:35.049> be<00:03:35.080> pretty

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
frequently sometimes they can be pretty

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.140 
frequently sometimes they can be pretty
useful<00:03:35.410> in<00:03:35.860> kids<00:03:36.100> or<00:03:36.280> infants<00:03:36.760> who<00:03:36.880> it's<00:03:37.000> going

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
useful in kids or infants who it's going

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.520 
useful in kids or infants who it's going
to<00:03:37.209> be<00:03:37.299> hard<00:03:37.480> to<00:03:37.540> get<00:03:37.720> the<00:03:37.810> drops<00:03:38.019> into<00:03:38.320> the<00:03:38.440> eye

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
to be hard to get the drops into the eye

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.470 
to be hard to get the drops into the eye
because<00:03:39.280> you<00:03:39.310> just<00:03:39.580> pull<00:03:39.790> the<00:03:39.940> eyelid<00:03:40.090> down<00:03:40.450> a

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
because you just pull the eyelid down a

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.900 
because you just pull the eyelid down a
little<00:03:40.750> bit<00:03:41.019> smear<00:03:41.709> it<00:03:41.739> on<00:03:41.980> the<00:03:42.160> lower<00:03:42.340> lid<00:03:42.700> as

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
little bit smear it on the lower lid as

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.340 
little bit smear it on the lower lid as
you<00:03:43.030> can<00:03:43.180> see<00:03:43.329> in<00:03:43.420> this<00:03:43.510> lower<00:03:43.750> picture<00:03:44.019> and

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
you can see in this lower picture and

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.350 
you can see in this lower picture and
then<00:03:44.680> when<00:03:44.860> a<00:03:44.890> kid<00:03:45.100> blinks<00:03:45.610> basically<00:03:46.090> spreads

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 
then when a kid blinks basically spreads

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.850 
then when a kid blinks basically spreads
the<00:03:46.480> ointment<00:03:46.840> around<00:03:47.079> and<00:03:47.260> again<00:03:47.410> it<00:03:47.560> lasts<00:03:47.799> a

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:47.860 
the ointment around and again it lasts a

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.500 
the ointment around and again it lasts a
little<00:03:47.950> longer<00:03:48.100> so<00:03:48.850> here's<00:03:49.150> different

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
little longer so here's different

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.259 
little longer so here's different
options<00:03:49.989> for<00:03:50.200> antibiotics<00:03:50.920> for<00:03:51.310> your<00:03:51.850> basic
