00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:09.570
 Welcome to the driver and we will analyze 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.190
 they are also the error and that imposes 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.010
 the beginning of the game this is called 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.570
 driver and welcome to the car 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:18.700
 good people let's talk about their 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.920
 skills we'll start with the passive to 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.240
 which is called sinister attacks 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.520
 Critics of housing including 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.200
 additional for four seconds if not 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.320
 everything will continue to be in use it does not matter if 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.730
 do not be critical to produce this additional 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.550
 how can we see our percentage 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.260
 critical we press the letters since 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:39.250
 critical probability will appear 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:41.590
 we have a 10% we hit it we have a 10% 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:44.160
 of the critical affiliate ok 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:46.320
 Then let's talk about itself 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.810
 we will talk about the migratory condition 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.239
 the next king attacks bonus 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:53.430
 a percentage of physical damage and the 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.070
 unification is 75 percent of the damage 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.260
 total also if we receive again 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.330
 Our h have in availability to use 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.129
 this ax in which I mean if we 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:04.530
 we give in boats this chabÃ¡n will go 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.290
 through the air and if we catch it we have 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:14.509
 possibility of returning to the sun 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:14.509
 yes we can with the mechanics 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:22.170
 at this moment you have a bug that makes 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.259
 that is much faster in getting the 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.180
 h 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:30.119
 once we have we are going to launch and 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.750
 before he hit and found 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.750
 cadillacs 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.290
 A) Yes 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.680
 we do not move he works in the 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.750
 traditions 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.480
 bloody impulse this is the skill 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.520
 that we activate with the w 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:01.640
 40% of floors moving during 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.680
 1.5 seconds and 20% of attack 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.210
 for three seconds that we caught from 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.860
 ax after using stability the 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.560
 cold yet cooling will be seen 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.980
 reduced does what I mean by that 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.250
 we'll see 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.150
 if we press ours it is not 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.150
 w 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.830
 to 0 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:30.530
 the jobs I have available 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:32.930
 City Hall will be reduced to zero 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.480
 get away stability we will act with 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.730
 and what it produces is that it separates 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.890
 They give them enemies following damage 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:43.540
 physical and moves us to the sides 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.540
 how are we going now continuously 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.750
 and finally we will talk about his last wave 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.660
 that we will activate with the rave in throwing 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.370
 his two giant antlers to inflict 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:58.310
 175 damage plus the damage percentage 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:01.310
 physical you have at this time 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.349
 we can make a stay until the 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.610
 distance that we want taking in 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:06.580
 realize that this will reach the 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.019
 final so deserved with these 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.760
 we can re-activate with adr for 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:13.010
 that is returned at the moment 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:16.020
 we want like 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:18.620
 we enjoyed the time 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.620
 good 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.600
 we have the disposition ours h if 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.580
 we at some point move 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:28.200
 sideways is made will change 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.200
 of address and will dilate us 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.019
 and good people in the matter of runes and 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.400
 more than those we know were fifths with 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:44.040
 all day and with extraction of 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.900
 armor marks with penetration of 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.269
 armor and we will use stamps to 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.980
 armor and magical resistance flow 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:51.360
 by level 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.909
 in question and expertise what 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.379
 we will use will be 21 54 giving it 

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:57.540
 offensive priority against our 

00:03:55.379 --> 00:04:01.490
 movement revolution on the way 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:03.860
 level and in hand regeneration utility 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:05.990
 and the invoked what we have now 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.770
 barriers with our I am a hawk 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:09.750
 I am 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:12.990
 our abilities our 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:14.700
 skills maximize our q for 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:21.980
 have in Asia as fast as possible 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:24.980
 maximize our levels of our 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.980
 movement 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.860
 we'll start with some very basic 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.870
 any of any exam with the 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.690
 new pac and movement speed 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:42.960
 using our google during the 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:45.450
 childhood and finally we will have 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.820
 our infiniti of fashion mall in the 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:50.490
 whisper phantom dance 2 sad diversey 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:53.020
 with perfect boots and finally if 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:55.090
 you want to win could improve level 3 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:58.620
 our contractors in the supports 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:58.620
 they could be fiscal or evenings 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.660
 in a next
