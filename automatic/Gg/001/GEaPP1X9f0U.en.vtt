00:00:08.209 --> 00:00:11.209
 the victory that is in our hands 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:15.549
 but nothing worked 

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:23.390
 more than ever the dakar wants to make sure the race is mostly for the 

00:00:23.389 --> 00:00:27.189
 public the danger to fight with the growing interest for Argentina 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:30.189
 and this year the security has been enhanced with 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.590
 we have already made a precise identification to detect atoms of spectators 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.280
 that can be installed on the special 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.280
 so according to the specials in Morocco where troy davis 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.160
 his list is replaced by the gendarmerie 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.470
 about 25,000 representatives of local law enforcement and 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.470
 authorities who are mobilized just for security 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.220
 Reunionese 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.870
 the mayor we are working here since April almost a year and we broadcast 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.060
 permanence in the media messages to warn the public and 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.930
 the artist with the national gallery the ball 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.070
 at no time in a van 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:13.500
 looking at him 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.650
 so associated canadian pulls 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.630
 so inconceivable without going through the past there is the most important 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.240
 to inform people about prohibited areas 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.380
 there are so many people who really make me really a job in the 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.430
 material 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:28.840
 and the word of the end 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.710
 about 130 hectares of forest 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.080
 French organizers came to South America for meetings 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.110
 about security with local law enforcement and at the same time they 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.850
 did simulations in their qg in paris 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.850
 purpose manage and anticipate any surprises that may occur on the 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.850
 dakar 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.999
 cars and helicopters 

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:55.220
 at the opening of this special 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.250
 to make sure that the clean systems estimated as they say at home 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.200
 apart from people who came out of the security perimeter 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.600
 so we have cars passing before the first photos 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.030
 we have cars 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.369
 before the first pictures and so we found the media 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.379
 an immediate perception 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:16.329
 the dakar maintains a great interest in the rally is one of 

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:19.469
 most important events in the world with 4 million viewers 

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:21.440
 expected in argentine and chile
