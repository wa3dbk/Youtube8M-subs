00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
like maybe a couple of millimeters in

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.959 
like maybe a couple of millimeters in
from<00:00:42.019> and<00:00:42.799> from<00:00:42.979> the<00:00:43.070> edge<00:00:43.190> there<00:00:44.000> so<00:00:45.909> what<00:00:46.909> you

00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:46.969 
from and from the edge there so what you

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:51.910 
from and from the edge there so what you
first<00:00:47.199> firstly<00:00:49.600> you<00:00:50.600> can<00:00:50.659> do<00:00:50.869> it<00:00:50.989> this<00:00:51.439> way<00:00:51.680> or

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
first firstly you can do it this way or

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.340 
first firstly you can do it this way or
put<00:00:52.159> it<00:00:52.250> onto<00:00:52.369> real<00:00:52.640> and<00:00:52.850> feed<00:00:53.000> it<00:00:53.119> up<00:00:53.239> but<00:00:54.079> we

put it onto real and feed it up but we

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.740 
put it onto real and feed it up but we
reckon<00:00:54.649> the<00:00:54.739> best<00:00:54.769> way<00:00:55.210> is<00:00:56.210> to<00:00:56.269> do<00:00:56.539> it<00:00:56.659> like

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
reckon the best way is to do it like

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:03.329 
reckon the best way is to do it like
this<00:00:56.869> so<00:01:00.280> just<00:01:01.280> put<00:01:01.460> it<00:01:01.549> into<00:01:01.670> the<00:01:01.759> first<00:01:01.969> I

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
definitely have to have this clipped

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.849 
definitely have to have this clipped
over<00:02:30.430> because<00:02:31.090> if<00:02:31.209> you<00:02:31.269> don't<00:02:31.530> the<00:02:32.530> line<00:02:32.709> will

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:32.859 
over because if you don't the line will

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:36.210 
over because if you don't the line will
just<00:02:33.040> be<00:02:34.109> just<00:02:35.109> free<00:02:35.349> it<00:02:35.620> won't<00:02:35.799> actually<00:02:36.010> be

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
just be just free it won't actually be

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.039 
just be just free it won't actually be
locked<00:02:36.519> into<00:02:36.700> the<00:02:36.849> reel<00:02:37.030> so<00:02:37.599> when<00:02:37.750> you<00:02:37.840> reel

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:38.049 
locked into the reel so when you reel

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:42.330 
locked into the reel so when you reel
nothing<00:02:38.680> will<00:02:38.799> actually<00:02:39.130> a<00:02:39.160> real<00:02:40.000> up<00:02:41.280> so<00:02:42.280> you

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
nothing will actually a real up so you

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.759 
nothing will actually a real up so you
just<00:02:42.519> twist<00:02:43.090> it<00:02:43.150> over<00:02:43.239> like<00:02:43.389> this<00:02:43.769> there's

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
just twist it over like this there's

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:48.500 
just twist it over like this there's
multiple<00:02:45.540> not<00:02:46.540> one<00:02:46.660> not<00:02:46.810> you<00:02:46.989> can<00:02:47.169> use<00:02:47.349> but<00:02:48.160> I

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
multiple not one not you can use but I

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.750 
multiple not one not you can use but I
reckon<00:02:49.510> one<00:02:50.319> of<00:02:50.410> the<00:02:50.500> easiest<00:02:50.709> ones<00:02:50.919> to<00:02:51.010> do<00:02:51.190> is

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
reckon one of the easiest ones to do is

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.199 
reckon one of the easiest ones to do is
just<00:02:52.090> the<00:02:52.209> plain<00:02:52.389> leaf<00:02:52.930> not<00:02:53.940> then<00:02:54.940> I'll<00:02:55.060> show

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
just the plain leaf not then I'll show

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:00.030 
just the plain leaf not then I'll show
you<00:02:55.239> how<00:02:55.359> to<00:02:55.450> do<00:02:55.540> that<00:02:55.660> now

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.489 

so<00:03:01.040> you<00:03:01.129> get<00:03:01.249> your<00:03:01.370> loose<00:03:01.519> end<00:03:02.200> so<00:03:03.200> that<00:03:03.349> should

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:03.499 
so you get your loose end so that should

00:03:03.499 --> 00:03:07.110 
so you get your loose end so that should
be<00:03:03.530> on<00:03:03.650> the<00:03:03.739> left<00:03:05.049> bring<00:03:06.049> it<00:03:06.139> over<00:03:06.349> the<00:03:06.439> rice

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
be on the left bring it over the rice

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:17.199 
be on the left bring it over the rice
and<00:03:08.120> under<00:03:14.139> pull<00:03:15.139> tight

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
and under pull tight

and under pull tight
and<00:03:17.750> then<00:03:18.099> the<00:03:19.099> loose<00:03:19.250> ends<00:03:19.609> which<00:03:19.790> is<00:03:19.909> on<00:03:20.030> the

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
and then the loose ends which is on the

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:26.770 
and then the loose ends which is on the
right<00:03:20.239> now<00:03:20.390> or<00:03:21.579> the<00:03:22.579> left<00:03:23.620> that's<00:03:24.620> right<00:03:25.780> over

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
right now or the left that's right over

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.979 
right now or the left that's right over
the<00:03:26.870> left<00:03:26.959> which<00:03:27.170> is<00:03:27.319> the<00:03:27.439> main<00:03:27.590> line<00:03:27.799> and

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
the left which is the main line and

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:33.759 
the left which is the main line and
under<00:03:29.989> again<00:03:30.049> a<00:03:31.359> way<00:03:32.359> to<00:03:32.420> remember<00:03:32.719> this<00:03:32.959> is<00:03:33.140> L

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:33.769 
under again a way to remember this is L

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:36.990 
under again a way to remember this is L
or<00:03:34.099> R<00:03:34.340> Oh

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.069 

leftover<00:03:38.000> rice<00:03:38.260> right<00:03:39.260> over<00:03:39.469> left<00:03:40.900> so<00:03:41.900> then

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:42.079 
leftover rice right over left so then

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:47.530 
leftover rice right over left so then
you<00:03:43.359> get<00:03:44.359> out<00:03:44.420> your<00:03:45.639> ass<00:03:46.639> disarm<00:03:47.030> a<00:03:47.120> knife<00:03:47.329> or

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
you get out your ass disarm a knife or

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.729 
you get out your ass disarm a knife or
scissors<00:03:48.019> or<00:03:48.290> whatever<00:03:48.939> and<00:03:49.939> just<00:03:49.970> cut<00:03:50.239> off

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739 
scissors or whatever and just cut off

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:57.059 
scissors or whatever and just cut off
the<00:03:51.739> excess<00:03:53.650> two<00:03:54.650> valves<00:03:54.980> a<00:03:55.329> half<00:03:56.329> centimeter

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:57.069 
the excess two valves a half centimeter

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:02.920 
the excess two valves a half centimeter
after<00:03:59.560> so<00:04:00.560> what<00:04:01.489> you've<00:04:01.609> got<00:04:01.639> now<00:04:01.930> essentially

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
after so what you've got now essentially

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:10.000 
after so what you've got now essentially
is<00:04:03.819> a<00:04:05.560> full<00:04:06.560> fully<00:04:07.069> lined<00:04:07.340> up<00:04:07.489> rod<00:04:08.530> but<00:04:09.530> all<00:04:09.620> you

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 
is a full fully lined up rod but all you

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:16.060 
is a full fully lined up rod but all you
have<00:04:10.099> to<00:04:10.189> do<00:04:10.450> is<00:04:11.450> reel<00:04:11.989> up<00:04:12.459> all<00:04:13.459> the<00:04:13.760> line<00:04:15.070> from

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
have to do is reel up all the line from

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:20.920 
have to do is reel up all the line from
your<00:04:16.220> from<00:04:16.639> your<00:04:16.699> spoon<00:04:16.970> or<00:04:17.090> just<00:04:17.269> show<00:04:19.930> the

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
your from your spoon or just show the

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.830 
your from your spoon or just show the
base<00:04:21.079> is<00:04:21.260> going<00:04:21.440> to<00:04:21.590> reel<00:04:21.799> all<00:04:21.949> this<00:04:22.130> up<00:04:23.090> into

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
base is going to reel all this up into

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:29.129 
base is going to reel all this up into
this<00:04:24.020> reel<00:04:24.370> because<00:04:25.370> the<00:04:25.699> way<00:04:25.820> we've<00:04:26.000> done<00:04:26.150> it

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:29.139 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:33.120 

we've<00:04:30.139> done<00:04:30.169> it<00:04:30.320> so<00:04:30.440> that<00:04:30.800> uh<00:04:30.909> we<00:04:31.909> just<00:04:31.940> need<00:04:32.150> to

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
we've done it so that uh we just need to

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.490 
we've done it so that uh we just need to
read<00:04:34.130> it<00:04:34.220> up<00:04:34.340> like<00:04:34.490> this<00:04:34.870> I'm<00:04:35.870> going<00:04:36.349> to<00:04:36.409> get

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 
read it up like this I'm going to get

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:51.730 
read it up like this I'm going to get
part<00:04:36.770> of<00:04:36.830> it<00:04:36.949> just<00:04:37.990> pull<00:04:38.990> it<00:04:39.110> out<00:04:39.169> real<00:04:39.830> up

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.180 

so<00:04:52.400> yeah<00:04:52.520> that's<00:04:52.640> basically<00:04:52.820> it<00:04:53.980> that's<00:04:54.980> as

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:55.190 
so yeah that's basically it that's as

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:58.300 
so yeah that's basically it that's as
you<00:04:55.310> can<00:04:55.400> see<00:04:55.630> this<00:04:56.630> is<00:04:56.690> a<00:04:56.750> good<00:04:56.960> maybe<00:04:57.560> two

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310 
you can see this is a good maybe two

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:59.560 
you can see this is a good maybe two
three<00:04:58.670> millimeters<00:04:59.090> of<00:04:59.180> land<00:04:59.360> on<00:04:59.450> there

00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.570 
three millimeters of land on there

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:01.720 
three millimeters of land on there
already<00:04:59.800> after<00:05:00.800> about<00:05:00.920> twenty<00:05:01.280> to<00:05:01.370> twenty<00:05:01.610> six

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:01.730 
already after about twenty to twenty six

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:05.080 
already after about twenty to twenty six
twenty<00:05:02.120> to<00:05:02.780> thirty<00:05:02.930> seconds<00:05:03.350> of<00:05:03.500> reading<00:05:04.090> to

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
twenty to thirty seconds of reading to

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:06.730 
twenty to thirty seconds of reading to
get<00:05:05.150> this<00:05:05.270> fully<00:05:05.540> done<00:05:05.720> just<00:05:06.320> have<00:05:06.440> to<00:05:06.560> keep

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:06.740 
get this fully done just have to keep

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.710 
get this fully done just have to keep
doing<00:05:07.040> this<00:05:07.070> maybe<00:05:07.760> a<00:05:07.880> minute<00:05:08.270> two<00:05:08.390> minutes<00:05:08.660> a

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720 
doing this maybe a minute two minutes a

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.200 
doing this maybe a minute two minutes a
half<00:05:08.900> and<00:05:09.170> it's<00:05:10.160> really<00:05:10.400> easy<00:05:10.520> just<00:05:11.030> the<00:05:11.120> way

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 
half and it's really easy just the way

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:13.390 
half and it's really easy just the way
we've<00:05:11.390> done<00:05:11.540> it<00:05:11.600> it's<00:05:12.410> the<00:05:12.560> easiest<00:05:12.800> process

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 
we've done it it's the easiest process

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.020 
we've done it it's the easiest process
it's<00:05:13.760> easy<00:05:13.910> this<00:05:14.000> way<00:05:14.210> of<00:05:14.450> doing<00:05:14.660> it<00:05:14.780> and<00:05:16.030> it's

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:17.030 
it's easy this way of doing it and it's

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:18.640 
it's easy this way of doing it and it's
like<00:05:17.180> I<00:05:17.270> said<00:05:17.300> if<00:05:17.660> you're<00:05:18.020> done<00:05:18.230> it<00:05:18.320> this<00:05:18.470> way

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.650 
like I said if you're done it this way

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:20.500 
like I said if you're done it this way
if<00:05:18.800> you<00:05:18.890> turn<00:05:19.160> it<00:05:19.280> on<00:05:19.340> to<00:05:19.490> the<00:05:19.580> real<00:05:19.730> and<00:05:19.970> then

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:20.510 
if you turn it on to the real and then

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:21.580 
if you turn it on to the real and then
gone<00:05:20.720> up<00:05:20.840> through<00:05:21.050> it<00:05:21.230> just<00:05:21.350> would<00:05:21.470> have<00:05:21.530> been

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:21.590 
gone up through it just would have been

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:24.520 
gone up through it just would have been
a<00:05:21.680> hell<00:05:22.040> of<00:05:22.070> a<00:05:22.220> job<00:05:22.370> um<00:05:23.110> so<00:05:24.110> this<00:05:24.200> is<00:05:24.350> definitely

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:24.530 
a hell of a job um so this is definitely

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:27.070 
a hell of a job um so this is definitely
the<00:05:24.680> easiest<00:05:24.860> way<00:05:25.510> all<00:05:26.510> right<00:05:26.600> so<00:05:26.720> that's<00:05:26.870> what

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:27.080 
the easiest way all right so that's what

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.830 
the easiest way all right so that's what
it<00:05:27.200> should<00:05:27.350> look<00:05:27.380> like<00:05:27.530> after<00:05:27.830> about<00:05:28.720> men<00:05:29.720> and

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:29.840 
it should look like after about men and

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.920 
it should look like after about men and
a<00:05:29.900> half<00:05:30.080> to<00:05:30.290> about<00:05:30.440> two<00:05:30.590> minutes<00:05:30.740> of<00:05:30.890> reading

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:31.930 
a half to about two minutes of reading

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.410 
a half to about two minutes of reading
like<00:05:32.930> I<00:05:33.020> said<00:05:33.520> it's<00:05:34.520> about<00:05:34.670> three<00:05:35.150> to<00:05:35.240> four

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:35.420 
like I said it's about three to four

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:39.460 
like I said it's about three to four
millimeters<00:05:36.700> from<00:05:37.700> the<00:05:37.880> end<00:05:38.200> right<00:05:39.200> from<00:05:39.350> the

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:39.470 
millimeters from the end right from the

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:40.960 
millimeters from the end right from the
edge<00:05:39.590> of<00:05:39.710> the<00:05:39.920> copies

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:40.970 
edge of the copies

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:43.980 
edge of the copies
so<00:05:41.780> I'm<00:05:42.050> we're<00:05:42.350> not<00:05:42.470> fully<00:05:42.860> done<00:05:43.010> yet<00:05:43.190> though

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:43.990 
so I'm we're not fully done yet though

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:46.750 
so I'm we're not fully done yet though
the<00:05:44.990> clip<00:05:45.170> is<00:05:45.560> still<00:05:46.010> pulled<00:05:46.310> over<00:05:46.490> like<00:05:46.580> this

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:46.760 
the clip is still pulled over like this

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:49.090 
the clip is still pulled over like this
so<00:05:47.140> we<00:05:48.140> have<00:05:48.230> to<00:05:48.320> just<00:05:48.350> clip<00:05:48.620> back<00:05:48.800> like<00:05:48.980> that

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:49.100 
so we have to just clip back like that

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:52.120 
so we have to just clip back like that
slowly<00:05:50.030> reel<00:05:50.270> it<00:05:50.360> down<00:05:50.800> select<00:05:51.800> the<00:05:51.890> end<00:05:52.010> is

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:52.130 
slowly reel it down select the end is

00:05:52.130 --> 00:06:02.200 
slowly reel it down select the end is
right<00:05:52.280> here<00:05:56.770> up<00:05:57.770> detangle<00:06:01.000> that's<00:06:02.000> why<00:06:02.090> I<00:06:02.120> have

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:02.210 
right here up detangle that's why I have

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:02.680 
right here up detangle that's why I have
to<00:06:02.270> do<00:06:02.390> this

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:02.690 
to do this

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:04.480 
to do this
a<00:06:02.720> bit<00:06:02.990> quite<00:06:03.200> carefully<00:06:03.680> because<00:06:03.770> the<00:06:04.100> lines

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:04.490 
a bit quite carefully because the lines

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:11.130 
a bit quite carefully because the lines
read<00:06:04.730> loose

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:11.140 

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:14.930 

all<00:06:11.620> right<00:06:11.740> so<00:06:11.890> just<00:06:12.630> read<00:06:13.630> it<00:06:13.750> up<00:06:13.870> like<00:06:14.020> that

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:14.940 
all right so just read it up like that

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:17.970 
all right so just read it up like that
so<00:06:15.940> you<00:06:16.000> have<00:06:16.120> the<00:06:16.210> very<00:06:16.330> end<00:06:16.570> a<00:06:16.840> lot<00:06:17.800> more

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:17.980 
so you have the very end a lot more

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:23.850 
so you have the very end a lot more
seals<00:06:18.750> have<00:06:19.750> is<00:06:19.990> this<00:06:20.170> set<00:06:22.800> this<00:06:23.800> little

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:23.860 
seals have is this set this little

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:28.680 
seals have is this set this little
triangle<00:06:24.580> thing<00:06:25.170> to<00:06:26.170> hold<00:06:27.270> can<00:06:28.270> actually<00:06:28.540> put

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:28.690 
triangle thing to hold can actually put

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:31.860 
triangle thing to hold can actually put
it<00:06:28.780> on<00:06:28.870> to<00:06:28.960> the<00:06:28.990> clip<00:06:29.230> like<00:06:29.320> that<00:06:30.540> to<00:06:31.540> hold<00:06:31.720> the

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:31.870 
it on to the clip like that to hold the

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:38.230 
it on to the clip like that to hold the
gut<00:06:32.020> like<00:06:32.170> this

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:38.240 

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:42.590 

and<00:06:39.240> I'm<00:06:40.139> failing<00:06:40.500> at<00:06:40.800> getting<00:06:40.830> in<00:06:41.250> on<00:06:41.370> it<00:06:41.600> but

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:42.600 
and I'm failing at getting in on it but

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.920 
and I'm failing at getting in on it but
I<00:06:42.630> haven't<00:06:42.840> shaken<00:06:43.050> it<00:06:43.230> like<00:06:43.320> that<00:06:43.440> all<00:06:43.590> right

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:44.930 
I haven't shaken it like that all right

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:47.120 
I haven't shaken it like that all right
so<00:06:45.930> that's<00:06:46.080> the<00:06:46.290> way<00:06:46.380> you<00:06:46.440> should<00:06:46.530> transport

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:47.130 
so that's the way you should transport

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:48.500 
so that's the way you should transport
your<00:06:47.310> reel<00:06:47.460> as<00:06:47.610> well<00:06:47.760> so<00:06:47.940> if<00:06:48.060> you<00:06:48.150> just<00:06:48.300> take<00:06:48.450> it

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:48.510 
your reel as well so if you just take it

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:56.720 
your reel as well so if you just take it
off<00:06:54.830> take<00:06:55.830> it<00:06:55.860> off<00:06:55.980> like<00:06:56.130> that<00:06:56.310> that's<00:06:56.550> just

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:56.730 
off take it off like that that's just

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:59.030 
off take it off like that that's just
the<00:06:56.850> way<00:06:57.000> are<00:06:57.389> you<00:06:57.480> transporting<00:06:57.750> it<00:06:58.080> don't<00:06:58.919> be

00:06:59.030 --> 00:06:59.040 
the way are you transporting it don't be
