cumbersome<00:01:12.420> quite<00:01:12.750> troublesome<00:01:13.170> because<00:01:13.439> you

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
cumbersome quite troublesome because you

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.649 
cumbersome quite troublesome because you
won't<00:01:13.830> be<00:01:13.890> able<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.189> field<00:01:14.430> enough<00:01:14.640> troops<00:01:14.970> but

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
won't be able to field enough troops but

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:16.789 
won't be able to field enough troops but
then<00:01:15.780> when<00:01:15.900> you<00:01:15.930> play<00:01:16.200> higher<00:01:16.439> level<00:01:16.770> of

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
then when you play higher level of

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.609 
then when you play higher level of
people<00:01:17.130> it's<00:01:17.549> like<00:01:17.670> you<00:01:17.930> you<00:01:18.930> almost<00:01:19.080> have<00:01:19.409> the

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
people it's like you you almost have the

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.100 
people it's like you you almost have the
same<00:01:19.950> sort<00:01:20.400> of<00:01:20.460> cost<00:01:21.060> efficiency<00:01:21.720> as<00:01:21.869> they<00:01:22.049> do

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
same sort of cost efficiency as they do

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.840 
same sort of cost efficiency as they do
but<00:01:22.860> their<00:01:23.009> troops<00:01:23.250> are<00:01:23.400> a<00:01:23.430> little<00:01:23.580> bit<00:01:23.759> better

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
but their troops are a little bit better

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.690 
but their troops are a little bit better
so<00:01:24.119> you<00:01:24.150> have<00:01:24.360> to<00:01:24.509> sort<00:01:24.689> of<00:01:24.840> outplay<00:01:25.590> them<00:01:25.700> but

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
so you have to sort of outplay them but

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:27.980 
so you have to sort of outplay them but
that'll<00:01:27.180> be<00:01:27.270> interesting<00:01:27.420> two<00:01:27.720> or<00:01:27.780> three
