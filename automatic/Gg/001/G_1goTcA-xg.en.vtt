00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:07.890
 hello together I am from giga and 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.910
 that's the sony smart watch co and the 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.670
 I'll get together with you first 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.769
 unpack so there is the good piece 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.450
 finally with us in the editorial 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.789
 Of course, I have it all at once 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.210
 provocative times the other smartphones the 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.769
 currently on market is turned down but 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.170
 We go first to the smart watch 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.210
 Two smart watch 1 was not like that 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:31.740
 especially great there was still there 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:33.710
 some rather negative last year 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.270
 or rather lame points in the device that 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.980
 second looks a little better 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.079
 packaging is ever far from 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.879
 higher quality than you would expect from one 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.170
 device knows here you have to go on top 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.860
 then you can press the whole thing 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.239
 do not take off 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.250
 I've been in the last few years 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.070
 two days wish something for the last one 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.840
 but I can play around a bit 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.800
 I wanted you again in original packaging 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.989
 demonstrate 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:59.210
 it is very beautiful you can 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:07.439
 Things are flying and then you have something 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:10.140
 firmer foam like that and that's the one 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.869
 very high quality smart watch two that 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.939
 everything is thick metal here 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.540
 It is really hard to get a hand and there 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.549
 Feels that the galaxy wants something 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.990
 I am quite against that 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.640
 interesting the display is not 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:28.759
 abonnent how to recognize this here 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:30.900
 you can tell by that first off that 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:32.990
 I 'm looking for a bit closer 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.540
 ran with it is better see 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:38.700
 so you can tell by the fact that that 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.040
 Display is not as easy as this 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.299
 here of greed there 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.409
 but that's not wild anymore 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:48.600
 lasts just under one and a half to two days 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:51.090
 and the thing keeps loose four to five 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.280
 anyway, so the statement 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.509
 in the back you have the nfc-chip on it 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.540
 You have to call the smartphone here 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:00.270
 once can push through the phone 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.000
 the clock with it can and then runs 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.580
 that also quite fluid there is also 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.040
 fewer 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.570
 you stand what I think a pity 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:11.140
 you get used to it very quickly 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:14.950
 where we make everything with gestures 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:17.770
 here on the left right down below 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.750
 that is not very practical here 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.190
 you have the whole waiting below 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.410
 on the whole side touch buttons 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:28.030
 Push up the side and have 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:31.120
 because here's how you get that from the sony 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.380
 smart watch scans the display 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.680
 also right now here you can see 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:38.440
 really very bright in the light 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:42.370
 not very much a bike 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:44.020
 bit and it's also a bit 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.250
 volunteered for all these little ones 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:48.040
 buttons impose 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:51.160
 Moreover, the functionality of the 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.720
 clock is not so good 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.400
 among other things, that I am here now 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.930
 quite a few notifications about 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.360
 I have an example up here and I can do it 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.790
 wipe away again 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.530
 I can still say about the menu 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.650
 to read everything 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.840
 okay that did not work or tabs 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.580
 not found anyway 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.310
 i have tastic here now i have 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.920
 facebook and twitter here on it off 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.600
 small a small part and others 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.280
 notifications directly from the 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.010
 phone come in this case 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.390
 currently the note 3 is one 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.070
 flashlight function probably just 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.500
 the display gets very bright and otherwise 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.970
 You can over the phone, of course, too 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.680
 still download other apps 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.950
 they come directly from the place you like 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:35.620
 not from a dedicated app store 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.930
 but from your own if you look at yourself 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.430
 now show apps from the app store 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.320
 you would like to let that be the easiest 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.940
 by following the notification 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.519
 bottom pulls on the smart watch two 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.800
 Just press under here 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:49.870
 a little bit of applications then looks for 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.610
 You can directly enter a one category 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.709
 choose or just join everyone 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.840
 display and directly in the place gate 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:58.380
 is then looking for applications the 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.799
 right after this smart extensions 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.150
 were declared 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:02.799
 unfortunately they are not very special 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.220
 many, or if they are 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:07.110
 would be interesting for example for 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.810
 whatsapp notification or similar 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:12.200
 then they almost always cost money clearly 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.640
 because whatsapp is a very popular and 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.620
 very common topic i find 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.600
 but that's a pity that 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.430
 just the interesting apps or 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.500
 Extensions, for example, with the 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.060
 camera or with whatsapp or other 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.100
 either to take advantage of disadvantage 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.540
 very hard to find or money 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.480
 costs in the settings you can 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:34.910
 blood and vibration watch faces what 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.910
 actually only the watches are set 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:39.780
 apps are listed here 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:41.400
 can do everything and what not yes and 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.500
 that was almost it 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.040
 For the time being, there is not more about the EU 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.360
 to be 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.210
 Of course , I 'll be a little bit more 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.360
 first impression after a few days 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.710
 publish 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.350
 you will be in front of you in any case 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:54.750
 to see christmas time around 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:56.430
 yes to say if you can do that 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.860
 can give away or not 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:01.620
 that was my first impression of 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:03.570
 the sony smart watch 2 and i hope 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.190
 that you like if you ask 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.450
 you then please write down times 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:12.030
 in the comments then I can 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:13.470
 Do not tell this what with long 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:17.340
 It could be a bit difficult 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:19.860
 so that was the unboxing of the 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:22.320
 sony smart watch two the good piece 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:25.050
 By the way, comes with a year of standards 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:27.180
 with a standard size that means you 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:29.880
 definitely needs something important 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:31.940
 tool around you to the right size 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:34.110
 screw down 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:36.419
 if you do not have them then it hangs 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:39.000
 of course, so poor 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:41.280
 pity what do you like better? 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.620
 At first impression the samsung 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.120
 galaxy gio or the sony smart watch 2 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.080
 Write something like that too 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.870
 below in the comments 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.340
 and you still have links here and 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:51.419
 right so very great videos you 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:53.850
 you can watch them too 

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:55.770
 on the canal and here we still have 

00:05:53.850 --> 00:06:00.050
 the other channels of giga and da have 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:00.050
 we still facebook and the whole thing
