foundation so let me start going through

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.870

some<00:00:15.900> points<00:00:16.350> I<00:00:16.560> have<00:00:17.190> anything<00:00:17.430> written<00:00:17.760> down

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
some points I have anything written down

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.679 
some points I have anything written down
so<00:00:18.210> it's<00:00:18.330> not<00:00:18.449> for<00:00:18.600> me<00:00:18.630> super<00:00:19.199> organized<00:00:19.619> but

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:20.689 
so it's not for me super organized but

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:25.040 
so it's not for me super organized but
first<00:00:21.689> off<00:00:22.189> this<00:00:23.189> is<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.490> bottle<00:00:23.820> and<00:00:24.050> it's

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
first off this is the bottle and it's

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.120 
first off this is the bottle and it's
kind<00:00:25.320> of<00:00:25.410> like<00:00:25.590> a<00:00:26.599> soggy<00:00:27.710> glass<00:00:28.710> thought<00:00:29.099> I

feel like when I'm super super matte I
tend<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.150> look<00:01:33.270> a<00:01:33.360> little<00:01:33.479> more<00:01:33.600> cakey<00:01:33.990> ER<00:01:34.200> so

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
tend to look a little more cakey ER so

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.330 
tend to look a little more cakey ER so
it<00:01:35.430> wasn't<00:01:35.820> horrible<00:01:36.180> but<00:01:36.869> as<00:01:37.740> far<00:01:37.920> as<00:01:38.009> staying

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
it wasn't horrible but as far as staying

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.370

Matt<00:01:38.729> all<00:01:38.970> day<00:01:39.329> and<00:01:39.750> with<00:01:39.900> oil<00:01:40.259> control<00:01:40.860> I

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
Matt all day and with oil control I

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.170 
Matt all day and with oil control I
don't<00:01:43.380> think<00:01:43.409> it<00:01:43.680> does<00:01:43.860> a<00:01:44.159> better<00:01:44.610> job<00:01:44.759> than

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
don't think it does a better job than

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.120 
don't think it does a better job than
any<00:01:45.420> other<00:01:45.630> foundation<00:01:46.259> so<00:01:46.439> far<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.920> best

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
any other foundation so far the best

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.120 
any other foundation so far the best
foundation<00:01:47.490> that<00:01:48.030> controls<00:01:48.450> my<00:01:48.630> oil<00:01:48.960> is<00:01:49.259> the

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
foundation that controls my oil is the

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.569 
foundation that controls my oil is the
make<00:01:50.280> up<00:01:50.430> for<00:01:50.460> ever<00:01:50.610> met<00:01:51.000> but<00:01:51.869> I<00:01:52.259> do<00:01:52.439> like<00:01:53.250> this

make up for ever met but I do like this
one<00:01:53.790> just<00:01:54.030> because<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.689> color<00:01:54.930> match<00:01:55.229> is<00:01:55.439> very

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
one just because the color match is very

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.749 
one just because the color match is very
nice<00:01:55.890> like<00:01:56.520> I<00:01:56.549> said<00:01:56.729> it<00:01:56.880> keeps<00:01:57.060> you<00:01:58.130> okay<00:01:59.130> with

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
have a pump now that's not that big a

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.140 
have a pump now that's not that big a
deal<00:03:23.090> for<00:03:23.419> me<00:03:23.569> too<00:03:24.349> because<00:03:24.829> I<00:03:25.010> mean<00:03:25.190> you<00:03:25.970> went

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
deal for me too because I mean you went

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:27.099 
deal for me too because I mean you went
about<00:03:26.329> in<00:03:26.449> the<00:03:26.540> first<00:03:26.659> place<00:03:26.780> what<00:03:27.019> the

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:27.109 
about in the first place what the

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:28.689 
about in the first place what the
samples<00:03:27.500> do<00:03:27.620> have<00:03:27.799> a<00:03:27.829> pump<00:03:28.129> so<00:03:28.310> I<00:03:28.340> guess<00:03:28.519> it

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:28.699 
samples do have a pump so I guess it

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:31.059 
samples do have a pump so I guess it
might<00:03:28.970> can<00:03:29.180> be<00:03:29.269> a<00:03:29.299> little<00:03:29.480> misleading<00:03:30.069> but

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:31.069 
might can be a little misleading but

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:34.390 
might can be a little misleading but
yeah<00:03:31.669> so<00:03:32.090> that's<00:03:32.480> not<00:03:32.810> super<00:03:33.530> out<00:03:33.889> the<00:03:34.099> window

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
yeah so that's not super out the window

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.800 
yeah so that's not super out the window
but<00:03:34.699> yes<00:03:34.879> and<00:03:35.090> they<00:03:35.180> if<00:03:35.269> you<00:03:35.359> want<00:03:35.510> to<00:03:35.569> pump<00:03:35.690> you

kind<00:04:49.530> of<00:04:49.590> patchy<00:04:50.040> and<00:04:50.490> I<00:04:51.410> don't<00:04:52.410> know<00:04:52.470> it

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
kind of patchy and I don't know it

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.270 
kind of patchy and I don't know it
wasn't<00:04:52.830> horrible<00:04:53.070> but<00:04:53.780> when<00:04:54.780> I<00:04:54.810> use<00:04:55.110> my

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 
wasn't horrible but when I use my

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.180 
wasn't horrible but when I use my
fingers<00:04:56.280> I<00:04:56.790> will<00:04:57.330> send<00:04:57.510> it<00:04:57.660> look<00:04:57.920> much<00:04:58.920> much

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190 
fingers I will send it look much much

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:00.770 
fingers I will send it look much much
better<00:04:59.430> so<00:04:59.880> that's<00:05:00.060> why<00:05:00.150> I<00:05:00.180> thought<00:05:00.360> a<00:05:00.420> lot<00:05:00.600> of

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
better so that's why I thought a lot of

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.780 
better so that's why I thought a lot of
reviews<00:05:01.140> people<00:05:01.380> like<00:05:01.710> what<00:05:01.980> you<00:05:02.460> know<00:05:02.610> this

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:02.790 
reviews people like what you know this

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:04.250 
reviews people like what you know this
doesn't<00:05:02.940> even<00:05:03.120> look<00:05:03.270> good<00:05:03.390> on<00:05:03.660> my<00:05:03.780> face<00:05:04.020> that<00:05:04.050> I

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:04.260 
doesn't even look good on my face that I

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.620 
doesn't even look good on my face that I
think<00:05:05.010> the<00:05:05.100> thing<00:05:05.130> is<00:05:05.430> make<00:05:06.270> sure<00:05:06.300> you<00:05:06.510> wash

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:06.630 
think the thing is make sure you wash

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:08.060 
think the thing is make sure you wash
your<00:05:06.840> hands<00:05:07.290> make<00:05:07.530> sure<00:05:07.560> they're<00:05:07.830> clean<00:05:07.860> and
