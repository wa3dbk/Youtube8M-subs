00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
normally on media stream this would take

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.670 
normally on media stream this would take
probably<00:01:20.790> 15<00:01:21.299> seconds<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:21.990> this<00:01:22.110> takes<00:01:22.350> boom

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
probably 15 seconds and this takes boom

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.740 
probably 15 seconds and this takes boom
just<00:01:22.979> you<00:01:23.729> know<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.000> you<00:01:24.090> can<00:01:24.210> scroll<00:01:24.540> right

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
through everything no problem I mean if

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.910 
through everything no problem I mean if
you<00:01:28.770> go<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:29.960> I'm<00:01:30.960> alright<00:01:31.229> I'm<00:01:31.320> on<00:01:31.409> eater<00:01:31.740> net

pretty much 1080p so let me play this

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:50.469 
pretty much 1080p so let me play this
tarzan<00:01:42.840> here<00:01:45.079> and<00:01:46.079> this<00:01:46.259> is<00:01:46.530> just<00:01:48.680> regular

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
tarzan here and this is just regular

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:55.639 
tarzan here and this is just regular
1080p<00:01:51.979> no<00:01:52.979> DTS<00:01:53.460> audio<00:01:53.729> but<00:01:54.329> all<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.960> DTS<00:01:55.409> audio

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
thing I am I have a dual HD tuner

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.250 
thing I am I have a dual HD tuner
upstairs<00:02:10.280> for<00:02:11.030> all<00:02:11.180> my<00:02:11.330> recordings<00:02:11.959> and<00:02:12.200> I

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
upstairs for all my recordings and I

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.990 
upstairs for all my recordings and I
just<00:02:12.440> basically<00:02:12.560> put<00:02:13.099> them<00:02:13.220> in<00:02:13.310> a<00:02:13.340> folder<00:02:13.610> and

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
just basically put them in a folder and

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.400 
just basically put them in a folder and
the<00:02:14.810> server<00:02:15.050> finds<00:02:15.560> them<00:02:15.819> um<00:02:16.819> is<00:02:17.090> that<00:02:17.410> you're

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
the server finds them um is that you're

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.650 
the server finds them um is that you're
gonna<00:02:18.590> get<00:02:18.770> audio<00:02:19.100> with<00:02:19.370> no<00:02:19.489> video<00:02:19.790> so<00:02:20.330> you<00:02:20.390> got

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
gonna get audio with no video so you got
