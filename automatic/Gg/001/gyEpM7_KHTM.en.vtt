00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
girl Hitler and towards the front of the

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:35.280 
girl Hitler and towards the front of the
hair<00:02:28.250> outward<00:02:29.150> easily

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:51.059 

just<00:02:35.560> keep<00:02:35.739> repeating<00:02:49.500> right<00:02:50.500> now<00:02:50.650> my<00:02:50.829> hair<00:02:51.040> is

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:51.069 
just keep repeating right now my hair is

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:53.690 
just keep repeating right now my hair is
one<00:02:51.400> day<00:02:51.549> old<00:02:51.760> and<00:02:52.060> I<00:02:52.180> typically<00:02:52.569> think<00:02:52.900> that

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
one day old and I typically think that

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.069 
one day old and I typically think that
having<00:02:54.700> a<00:02:54.849> little<00:02:55.060> bit<00:02:55.150> of<00:02:55.269> that<00:02:55.299> dirt<00:02:55.689> oil

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:56.079 
having a little bit of that dirt oil

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:58.619 
having a little bit of that dirt oil
your<00:02:56.470> hair<00:02:56.500> would<00:02:57.489> be<00:02:57.609> more<00:02:57.790> beneficial<00:02:57.939> for

00:02:58.619 --> 00:02:58.629 
your hair would be more beneficial for

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:00.179 
your hair would be more beneficial for
your<00:02:58.720> curls<00:02:59.140> because<00:02:59.319> it'll<00:02:59.709> just<00:02:59.920> hold

00:03:00.179 --> 00:03:00.189 
your curls because it'll just hold

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:04.849 
your curls because it'll just hold
tighter<00:03:00.549> rather<00:03:01.450> than<00:03:01.950> freshly<00:03:02.950> washing<00:03:03.340> hair

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:04.859 
tighter rather than freshly washing hair

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:08.160 
tighter rather than freshly washing hair
so<00:03:05.859> I'm<00:03:06.069> just<00:03:06.280> going<00:03:06.489> to<00:03:06.639> be<00:03:06.819> repeating<00:03:07.359> the

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
so I'm just going to be repeating the
