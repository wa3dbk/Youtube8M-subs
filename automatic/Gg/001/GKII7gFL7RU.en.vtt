00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.319
 but something that were shared 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:10.090
 so if it's for the post of 

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.590
 archer no but 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:13.070
 but good hard to play every time 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:15.889
 good 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:18.130
 they did not tie and it's a good result 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:28.470
 this one yes 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:28.470
 but we had that we had space 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.409
 in short Argentina is very close 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.409
 of the world 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.110
 thanks marcelito 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:55.510
 sergio sergio cortito which meant this 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:57.129
 tie for Argentina that the tie us 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.110
 it served a lot obviously we wanted to win 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:01.089
 but but the tie I think is very 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.490
 well criminal it seemed you can go balls 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:04.920
 they are the criminal 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.630
 for what 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.490
 on the site I am for you now it is me 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.939
 is doing well but the most important thing 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.590
 it was that it was goal and good luckily as 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.600
 you finished the game I was sore in 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.200
 the first the Colombian does not end well 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.750
 the truth is that it's fine but so 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.310
 I was drowning fast but hey nothing 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.149
 true that it ends well but they suffered 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.149
 the height or not at the end 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.680
 I thought it was that I was more fucked but 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:35.860
 the time that I did not hold up well so 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:38.050
 happy because sergio aguero the author 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.120
 of the goal already there the truth that they came 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.710
 everything and suffered enough how did you see it 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.229
 I say to the party more than not 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.830
 are today in the world they drew a point 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:46.830
 In the height 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.200
 we tried to look for the wheat could not 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.990
 but I think that 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.820
 the draw is not bad a field 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.649
 historically difficult sergio point in 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.869
 the bed as I said does not approach every time 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:02.630
 more to the world, if that is what we are dealing with 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:05.179
 look to try to classify the most before 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.970
 possible and I think today the tie did not come 

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:11.480
 well obviously it's always nice to win 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:13.220
 but but nothing I think that every time we're 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.019
 Objective closer to the glass half 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.489
 empty has to do with who suffered the 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:19.040
 half full glass with which they continue without 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:20.959
 lose the only one who have fallen the only 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.150
 the only defeat is with venezuela in that 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:24.830
 atypical party yes good the truth that a 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.140
 see how important it is to try not to 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:30.079
 lose I think we were very good was 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.390
 good way but but you have to continue not 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:34.250
 is so close the tie are all 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:37.190
 difficult and you have to be the middle glass 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.540
 full again here had not won all 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.000
 the matches you block so 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.370
 least get a draw is not bad good 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.349
 the truth that as follows to see the picture 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.510
 it's a local one is quite difficult 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:49.280
 and as you say the tie is nothing more 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.170
 a the last one does that is not the context 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.819
 but he has suffered all week so 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:56.460
 what's happening with independent some 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:58.590
 message for fans for the people 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.480
 going through a bad time but as 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.970
 I always say you have to have hope and 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:06.180
 I hope it's good that we try 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:09.830
 save us but but obviously you have to 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.830
 have faith and hope nothing more thanks
