psychiatrist and for a number of years

psychiatrist and for a number of years
I've<00:00:32.519> been<00:00:32.790> studying<00:00:33.589> schizophrenia<00:00:34.589> in

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
I've been studying schizophrenia in

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.799 
I've been studying schizophrenia in
older<00:00:35.760> patients<00:00:36.980> the<00:00:37.980> usual<00:00:38.460> notion<00:00:38.809> about

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
older patients the usual notion about

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.790 
older patients the usual notion about
schizophrenia<00:00:40.170> and<00:00:40.830> aging<00:00:41.309> is<00:00:41.670> that<00:00:42.450> as

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
schizophrenia and aging is that as

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.369 
schizophrenia and aging is that as
people<00:00:43.800> with<00:00:43.950> schizophrenia<00:00:44.160> get<00:00:45.090> older<00:00:45.420> they

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
people with schizophrenia get older they

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.810 
people with schizophrenia get older they
become<00:00:46.789> cognitively<00:00:47.789> and<00:00:47.820> physically<00:00:48.420> worse

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
become cognitively and physically worse

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.689 
become cognitively and physically worse
we<00:00:50.820> found<00:00:51.180> that<00:00:51.449> that<00:00:51.510> was<00:00:51.660> only<00:00:51.930> half<00:00:52.320> true

00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:52.699 
we found that that was only half true

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:56.470 
we found that that was only half true
they<00:00:53.699> do<00:00:53.940> get<00:00:54.120> physically<00:00:54.719> was<00:00:55.020> however

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
they do get physically was however

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.510 
they do get physically was however
cognitively<00:00:57.480> they<00:00:57.690> do<00:00:57.960> not<00:00:58.170> get<00:00:58.379> impaired<00:00:59.280> any

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
cognitively they do not get impaired any

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.619 
cognitively they do not get impaired any
faster<00:01:00.180> than<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.899> population<00:01:01.440> at<00:01:01.530> large

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 
faster than the population at large

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:07.430 
faster than the population at large
more<00:01:03.629> importantly<00:01:04.229> we<00:01:05.220> found<00:01:05.640> that<00:01:06.360> as<00:01:06.720> people

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:07.440 
more importantly we found that as people

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.520 
more importantly we found that as people
with<00:01:07.590> schizophrenia<00:01:07.830> get<00:01:08.429> older<00:01:09.229> they<00:01:10.229> begin

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
with schizophrenia get older they begin

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.830 
with schizophrenia get older they begin
doing<00:01:10.710> better<00:01:11.250> from<00:01:12.149> the<00:01:12.570> psychiatric

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
doing better from the psychiatric

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.960 
doing better from the psychiatric
perspective<00:01:14.240> they<00:01:15.240> are<00:01:15.360> fun<00:01:15.830> know<00:01:16.830> that<00:01:17.580> if

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
perspective they are fun know that if

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.580 
perspective they are fun know that if
they<00:01:18.090> stop<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.509> medication<00:01:18.750> they<00:01:19.320> would<00:01:19.470> have

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
they stop the medication they would have

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.800 
they stop the medication they would have
relapse<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.250> when<00:01:21.060> in<00:01:21.240> order<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.630> avoid

relapse and when in order to avoid
relapse<00:01:22.140> they<00:01:22.470> are<00:01:22.560> more<00:01:22.830> adherent<00:01:23.340> with

relapse they are more adherent with

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
schizophrenia are less likely to be

schizophrenia are less likely to be

hospitalized for medical reasons

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.420

so<00:01:41.250> we<00:01:42.119> consistently<00:01:42.720> found<00:01:43.170> that<00:01:43.430> contrary

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
so we consistently found that contrary

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.010 
so we consistently found that contrary
to<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.850> notion<00:01:45.119> of<00:01:45.979> dementia<00:01:46.979> praecox<00:01:47.250> as

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
to the notion of dementia praecox as

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.780 
to the notion of dementia praecox as
schizophrenia<00:01:49.020> being<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.680> disease<00:01:50.070> that

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
schizophrenia being the disease that

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.340 
schizophrenia being the disease that
progressively<00:01:51.479> gets<00:01:51.780> worse

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
progressively gets worse

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.940 
progressively gets worse
we<00:01:52.740> found<00:01:53.159> that<00:01:53.880> psychosocial<00:01:55.020> people<00:01:55.860> with

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
we found that psychosocial people with

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.100 
we found that psychosocial people with
schizophrenia<00:01:56.270> actually<00:01:57.270> did<00:01:57.450> better<00:01:57.750> as

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
schizophrenia actually did better as

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.789 
schizophrenia actually did better as
they<00:01:58.380> got<00:01:58.530> older<00:01:59.450> so<00:02:00.450> one<00:02:00.630> question<00:02:00.840> was<00:02:01.320> is

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
they got older so one question was is

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.920 
they got older so one question was is
this<00:02:02.310> something<00:02:02.759> unique<00:02:03.149> to<00:02:03.180> this<00:02:03.479> population

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
this something unique to this population

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.180 
this something unique to this population
or<00:02:04.799> is<00:02:05.009> this<00:02:05.130> a<00:02:05.310> more<00:02:05.549> generalized<00:02:06.030> finding<00:02:07.190> so

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
or is this a more generalized finding so

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.259 
or is this a more generalized finding so
we<00:02:08.610> began<00:02:08.880> a<00:02:08.940> study<00:02:09.239> of<00:02:10.850> average<00:02:11.850> errors

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:12.269 
we began a study of average errors

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:15.920 
we began a study of average errors
living<00:02:12.810> in<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:13.019> community<00:02:14.150> today<00:02:15.150> we<00:02:15.720> have

living in the community today we have

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.009 
living in the community today we have
studied<00:02:16.320> several<00:02:16.799> thousand<00:02:17.579> people<00:02:18.019> between

San Diego community what we find is what

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.480 
San Diego community what we find is what
I<00:02:27.810> call<00:02:28.050> a<00:02:28.080> paradox<00:02:28.620> of<00:02:28.800> aging<00:02:29.630> with<00:02:30.630> aging<00:02:31.490> the

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
I call a paradox of aging with aging the

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:36.860 
I call a paradox of aging with aging the
physical<00:02:33.030> health<00:02:33.560> declines<00:02:35.510> some<00:02:36.510> cognitive

however psychosocial functioning

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.160 
however psychosocial functioning
improves<00:02:44.540> people<00:02:45.540> feel<00:02:45.780> better<00:02:45.990> about

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
improves people feel better about

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.210 
improves people feel better about

who are happier and contributing more to
