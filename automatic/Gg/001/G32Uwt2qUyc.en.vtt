00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 Hi, people, I only have Teresa, and today I go. 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.750
 show you how I did the 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.880
 paper politics and the kitchen for 2 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.880
 using video in which we participated 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:15.660
 I'll show you the milk carton here. 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:21.380
 the leads champion and my preferred 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.380
 wine first I counted the egg white 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:27.990
 Fried is not it seems a little fried egg but 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.240
 it's actually a broken egg after I 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.910
 I cut another piece just like a 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.559
 slightly smaller in another tone and in the middle I 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.820
 I put a panama paper to give a 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:42.559
 little volume 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:45.539
 I used double-sided tape then I cut the gem 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:47.250
 but they as small then cortez new 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.760
 there you do not like doing things two 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:53.190
 Sometimes I'm too lazy. 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.360
 It gets better there so I cut a 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:03.239
 bright to give a certain 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:05.580
 deep, ready, cute wolf 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.200
 then I did the box of milk it 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.659
 seems a bit more complicated but 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.790
 come on, I was using the reference 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.740
 in that coca cola american box 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.990
 cola that is on the blog 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.820
 then I find it unfair with our 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.460
 little boxes because they are so 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.170
 Beautiful windows, a Brazilian box . 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.860
 to see and late 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:28.380
 Brazil then I cut off various forces 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.909
 paper and I was putting 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.020
 multiple layers 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:35.790
 the milk here has much more 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.700
 personality and judged 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:42.390
 for no one doubts that it is 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:45.660
 I'm going to make a people taxpayer cup. 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.780
 be careful when the scissors are 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.280
 military 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:55.050
 Who wants to make paper food raises 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:02:01.920
 hand to mouth I can not see you, right? 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:04.110
 want and now the cac played a part with the 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.380
 body of dulce de leche and I remembered 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.209
 coverage here is also this scheme of 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.090
 paper overlap 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:14.310
 I cut the silhouette of the cap and then I 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.340
 I put that cover in the color of the candy 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:20.390
 milk and has the forminha the field 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:23.280

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:26.220
 the goal is ready 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.620
 It was really cool and before you left. 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.830
 I still made a present for them, it's a 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.910

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.590
