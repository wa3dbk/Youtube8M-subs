00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:14.809
 then we are here with vincenzo 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:18.930
 pizzamiglio preparer of the engines of 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:21.119
 daniele agostinelli engines that together with 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.670
 those of crossbows are those that 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.810
 exceed 100 times at the bottom of 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.730
 straight therefore a preparer 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:33.360
 exceptional though now a little 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:36.780
 seasoned tell us something about these 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:41.250
 engines that I see are on a bad basis 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:47.010
 red with the capricorn head l01 della 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:52.410
 capri days and already processed but I them 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:53.550
 I change the phase of the face motor 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.120
 work on the cylinder 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:00.140
 I practically do things 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:03.570
 small but substantial 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:08.240
 so here are already prepared engines 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:14.000
 from capricorn but pizzamiglio 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:17.549
 reworks on the phase on the cylinder 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.100
 we are here because as I repeat these 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:23.220
 engines are a bit scaring everyone 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.130
 how many are on the track here 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.220
 which are engines that have a big one 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.490
 hit below on the straight they exceed 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.250
 steadily 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:39.340
 the hundred per hour secret mascot here quickly 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:41.659
 no secret is no secret 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:45.950
 needed for 20 of the value 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:50.600
 no secret says anything about itself 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:52.640
 they are engines that are fine but says that 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.220
 great driver 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:59.470
 the pilot and engine coupling 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:04.490
 We thank fundamental Vincenzo 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:07.190
 another historical person around the 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:10.130
 our tracks and we thank you again for 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.519
 new for giving us this little one 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.519
 interview
