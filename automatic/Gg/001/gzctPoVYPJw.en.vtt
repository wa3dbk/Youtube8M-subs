awesome little preview of what their

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.260 
awesome little preview of what their
whole<00:01:12.119> material<00:01:12.360> design<00:01:12.720> is<00:01:12.869> about<00:01:14.119> so<00:01:15.119> they

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
whole material design is about so they

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.749 
whole material design is about so they
purposely<00:01:15.750> have<00:01:15.990> um<00:01:16.340> when<00:01:17.340> it<00:01:17.430> opens<00:01:17.700> up

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
purposely have um when it opens up

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.640 
purposely have um when it opens up
finally<00:01:18.119> purposely<00:01:19.110> has<00:01:19.259> white<00:01:20.250> areas<00:01:20.759> it's

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
finally purposely has white areas it's

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.530 
finally purposely has white areas it's
supposed<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:22.680> be<00:01:22.830> bolder<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.340> make<00:01:23.520> you<00:01:23.850> feel

a<00:01:24.600> little<00:01:24.689> bit<00:01:24.869> more<00:01:24.930> immersed<00:01:25.650> I<00:01:25.950> mean<00:01:26.100> the

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
a little bit more immersed I mean the

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.649 
a little bit more immersed I mean the
colors<00:01:26.549> change<00:01:26.880> it's<00:01:27.150> kind<00:01:27.390> of<00:01:27.420> denied

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
colors change it's kind of denied

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.010 
colors change it's kind of denied
dynamic<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:28.439> it<00:01:28.530> does<00:01:28.650> kind<00:01:28.890> of<00:01:28.979> get<00:01:29.970> you<00:01:30.240> into

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
dynamic and it does kind of get you into

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.020 
dynamic and it does kind of get you into
the<00:01:31.140> application<00:01:31.680> I<00:01:31.740> guess<00:01:31.950> so<00:01:32.250> right<00:01:32.909> now

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
the application I guess so right now

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.490 
the application I guess so right now
it's<00:01:33.180> just<00:01:33.329> blank<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:33.960> then<00:01:34.049> you<00:01:34.259> do<00:01:34.470> a

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
it's just blank and then you do a

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.789 
it's just blank and then you do a
function<00:01:35.189> or<00:01:35.579> an<00:01:35.880> equation<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.689> um<00:01:36.869> when<00:01:37.680> you

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
function or an equation and um when you

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.800 
function or an equation and um when you
actually<00:01:38.159> do<00:01:38.340> it<00:01:38.490> equals<00:01:38.820> it<00:01:39.090> changes<00:01:39.509> to<00:01:39.659> this

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
actually do it equals it changes to this

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.590 
actually do it equals it changes to this
bright<00:01:40.170> turquoise<00:01:40.799> which<00:01:41.430> is<00:01:41.640> which<00:01:42.240> is<00:01:42.270> cool

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
bright turquoise which is which is cool

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.870 
bright turquoise which is which is cool
I<00:01:42.630> guess<00:01:43.009> and<00:01:44.009> then<00:01:44.100> right<00:01:44.220> here<00:01:44.250> down<00:01:44.640> on<00:01:44.700> the

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
I guess and then right here down on the

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.700 
I guess and then right here down on the
number<00:01:45.149> pad<00:01:45.329> you<00:01:45.960> pull<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.259> dry<00:01:46.409> you<00:01:46.470> have

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
number pad you pull the dry you have

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.210 
number pad you pull the dry you have
your<00:01:46.860> added<00:01:47.189> functions<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:48.119> special<00:01:48.780> signs

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
your added functions and special signs

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.929 
your added functions and special signs
for<00:01:50.220> those<00:01:50.369> advanced<00:01:50.909> users<00:01:51.270> I<00:01:51.450> guess<00:01:52.939> but

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
for those advanced users I guess but

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.639 
for those advanced users I guess but
definitely<00:01:54.299> try<00:01:54.450> it<00:01:54.479> out<00:01:54.630> it's<00:01:54.899> cool<00:01:55.200> if<00:01:55.409> you

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
definitely try it out it's cool if you

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.889 
definitely try it out it's cool if you
want<00:01:56.159> to<00:01:56.250> get<00:01:56.340> a<00:01:56.369> little<00:01:56.579> preview<00:01:56.759> of<00:01:57.030> what

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
want to get a little preview of what
