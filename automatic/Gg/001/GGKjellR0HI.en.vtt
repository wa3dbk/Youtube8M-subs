00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.970 

my<00:01:31.180> strengths<00:01:31.720> and<00:01:31.870> definitely<00:01:32.260> my<00:01:32.440> starts<00:01:32.860> I

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:32.980 
my strengths and definitely my starts I

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:34.920 
my strengths and definitely my starts I
always<00:01:33.280> seem<00:01:33.460> to<00:01:33.610> pull<00:01:34.210> a<00:01:34.240> pretty<00:01:34.660> good<00:01:34.780> hole

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930 
always seem to pull a pretty good hole

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.780 
always seem to pull a pretty good hole
shot<00:01:35.220> but<00:01:36.220> my<00:01:36.970> weaknesses<00:01:37.480> would<00:01:37.660> probably<00:01:37.990> be

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
shot but my weaknesses would probably be

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.040 
shot but my weaknesses would probably be
finding<00:01:39.790> the<00:01:39.850> confidence<00:01:40.330> to<00:01:40.390> jump<00:01:40.690> those<00:01:40.870> big

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.050 
finding the confidence to jump those big

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.890 
finding the confidence to jump those big
jumps<00:01:41.440> it<00:01:41.560> just<00:01:41.830> has<00:01:42.640> to<00:01:42.820> have<00:01:43.450> to<00:01:43.570> like<00:01:43.690> get

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:43.900 
jumps it just has to have to like get

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.500 
jumps it just has to have to like get
used<00:01:44.080> to<00:01:44.260> it<00:01:44.410> and<00:01:44.619> ride<00:01:45.040> a<00:01:45.340> few<00:01:45.910> laps<00:01:46.150> before<00:01:46.360> I

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:46.510 
used to it and ride a few laps before I

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:47.820 
used to it and ride a few laps before I
actually<00:01:46.660> start<00:01:47.020> getting<00:01:47.229> stuff<00:01:47.440> down<00:01:47.650> and

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:47.830 
actually start getting stuff down and

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:49.830 
actually start getting stuff down and
put<00:01:47.950> it<00:01:48.040> together<00:01:48.160> but<00:01:48.670> my<00:01:49.450> strengths<00:01:49.780> are

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
put it together but my strengths are

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.170 
put it together but my strengths are
definitely<00:01:50.200> my<00:01:50.290> starts<00:01:50.619> I<00:01:50.910> was<00:01:51.910> sitting<00:01:52.150> on
