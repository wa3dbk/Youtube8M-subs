00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:50.150
 to the enemy champion which streets of 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:53.960
 take with an adc so with a 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:55.400
 addition will take the marks but a 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.770
 offers a mark in full attack damage 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:01.550
 that disdain for brands is the 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:04.089
 maran after with the ruins so we go

 in full magic resistance and only one 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.670
 light bulb tkd attack 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.860
 if to have sixteen physical damage in 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.740
 done after the three quintessence you 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.479
 take them in full attack damage 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.610
 that's a total of sixteen of 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.460
 galas des cats attack 11 years resistance 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:31.580
 magical and very honest but that's it 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.930
 was not if you need it without 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.170
 delay we will watch the Masters 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.970
 what mastery to take with an adc 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:43.240

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:45.799
 attacked defense nave did not put her 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.150
 you look there that's all that can 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:48.799
 improve the attack 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.659
 do not come right-handed that's the 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:55.430
 power it serves completely nothing with 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:57.680
 an adc to provide the nine in defense on 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:00.770
 will take them alive in magic resistance 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:04.340
 in armor so the device was pausing 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:06.790
 you have to watch and that's it 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.790
