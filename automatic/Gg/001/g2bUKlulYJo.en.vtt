 guitarist Creek and is to be 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:29.740
 project here today to show you 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:33.280
 a video where we did an impromptu and 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.870
 a composition using agents in order to 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.470
 make this video we invited two 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.410
 beasts 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:40.000
 fernando nunes who is a bass player 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.520
 superexperiente has already recorded cassia eller 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.070
 with Caetano Veloso today plays with zeca 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.530
 and also a drummer from the new 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:50.320
 gabriel guilherme generation he won 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.700
 the Brazilian stage of the roland 20 contest 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.890
 and went to represent brazil in the 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:56.260
 united states by fourth place 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.300
 in the video we used some of the 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.329
 versatility the suingue of fernando 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.489
 nunes and also the characteristics of the 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:05.139
 gabriel guilherme's style that combines 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:09.969
 the electronic and the drum sounds 

00:01:05.139 --> 00:01:11.889
 to make it heavier as it is 

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:14.350
 I use the GT3 in every time 

00:01:11.889 --> 00:01:16.270
 I'm writing I like you the 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.700
 resources that are the ones I use the most 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.560
 both in lei hotel here the time of 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.490
 music I'll put according to music 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.490
 it happens then 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.560
 at the moment I found the time of the song already 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.710
 I usually give the delay 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.100
 I'll call you Disney right away. 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.100
 from music 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:51.580
 the delay is very discreet 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:56.260
 just for so long the music 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.260
 here in the hand is too lupi 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:15.590
 profit is always nice for you to have 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.590
 ideas and themes, and in soils and soils 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.560
 the text overdrive also a pedal for 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:43.820
 turn on and off overdrive when I 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:48.130
 I want a little more weight then 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:48.130
 which started already has a bit of drive 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:54.520
 I put a truth a little bit to 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:58.750
 add a very interesting thing here 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:00.370
 in gt without is that you can create both the 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.610
 amplifiers the simulators of 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:08.200
 amplifiers as much as the workers 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:09.310
 you can customize or leave the 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.900
 your way 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.730
 it has a huge range of 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.220
 amplifiers you can use inspired 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.560
 in the male or even bug all cases 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.710
 Who knows the Finns and such? 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:23.500
 also they have they have a picador 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:27.070
 castan that it has no parameters 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.959
 you assemble all the features of the 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:30.790
 The pain is always from your 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:32.890
 I like what you're listening to. 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.980
 Are you looking for the same thing with 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:40.630
 overdrive one thing i like is 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:42.820
 as the overdrive can point out 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:45.520
 a little there was through the computer without 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:49.570
 change the characteristics of this sound to 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:50.560
 that we needed to customize then 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:52.120
 this overdrive 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:56.320
 so that he would simply be a 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:58.840
 amplifier booster and is a bust of 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.040
 the seeker overdrive and it worked 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.530
 perfectly 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.660
 I'll leave it here also in the scheme in 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:08.010
 pedal zinho so it's very easy too 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.010
 for us to create this composition 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:26.960
 the travel agent starts exchanging 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:29.410
 So let's seize the opportunity. 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:32.410
 now an idea has a health system 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.410
 started 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.030
 was cool
