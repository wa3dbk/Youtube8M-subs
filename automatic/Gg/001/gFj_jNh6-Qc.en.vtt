00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:10.880
 paper production begins with 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.350
 the arrival of wood the establishment la 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.900
 paper is made from a paste 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:17.930
 made up of a mix of 65 percent of 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.970
 25 percent maple of birch and 10 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.740
 percent of poplar takes two 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.080
 tons of wood to produce one 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.880
 ton of pasta everything starts from 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.890
 this barked drum that re 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.720
 removes the bark from the trunks is 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.210
 an operation that lasts 20 minutes 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.600
 bark will be burned to produce the 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.280
 steam necessary for the work of the drum 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:41.290
 the bark- free trunks come 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.290
 transferred by this transporter 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.370
 now the trunks are reduced to 

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:57.780
 also called bits about these 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.640
 they are stacked and left 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.640
 outside in both winter and summer 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:07.409
 these five stacks constitute a 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.390
 total of about 30 thousand tons of 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.880
 wood the next phase is to 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.060
 reduce the chips in a paste you start 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.060
 front 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.420
 this screen verifies that the washing machine 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:23.720
 is loaded correctly 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.490
 then it is the time of the future alkaline 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.350
 this huge cylinder is the container 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.140
 in which the pieces of wood are cooked 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:34.040
 for several hours at a temperature of 158 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.180
 grades centers and this is the boiler of 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.190
 recovery 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.960
 burn lignite at a thousand degrees 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.210
 some substances are recovered 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.880
 chemicals leak out in the form of 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.770
 wash this black liquid a residue of the 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.760
 cooked wood will be burned to produce 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.560
 steam coming out of the washing machine pasta 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.440
 brown is rinsed sent to 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.240
 thin with this spatula yes 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.140
 check the washing quality of the 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.440
 pasta 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.580
 the pasta must be bleached 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.930
 extraction lender in the kalina 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.960
 position in contact with substances 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.270
 chemical paste is a candidate with 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.380
 chlorine dioxide and gradually becomes 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:16.320
 more legs then the water comes partially 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.820
 eliminated this life and breaks the dough 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:22.260
 so you can insert it in 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:23.970
 storage containers the water comes 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.210
 extracted with this machine the 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:30.960
 paper machine for working sail 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:32.640
 at a speed of 1,060 meters per minute 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.260
 between entry and exit la 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:38.780
 concentration of water in the dough 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.780
 drops from 95 to 5 percent 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.540
 here we see the sheet of paper coming out 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.830
 from the presses 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.360
 analyzers check the parameters of 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.050
 paper quality and signal 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.050
 any anomalies 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:04.849
 the paper is then rolled up this 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:04.849
 roller produces huge main coils 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.420
 with this transport arm one 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.030
 reel is replaced with a good one 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:18.570
 one roller weighs more than 35 tons 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:20.400
 contains 60 km of machinery paper 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:22.380
 cutting to the main roller coils more 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.600
 small to less wide some will come 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:28.400
 distributed thus while others will come 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.400
 sent to the paper cutter 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:39.930
 the rollers are moved to a warehouse 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:42.150
 question 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:45.769
 those roles are kept in the warehouse 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.769
 which will then be cut 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.370
 robots guided by rails on the floor 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.740
 feeding the opener ABI 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:55.680
 romantic it is here that paper is produced 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:04:00.080
 from printing the robots are controlled by a 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.080
 central computer run by workers 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:14.209
 production reaches 55 thousand sheets per 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:16.669
 minute 4 automatic separators and four 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:20.019
 workers verify the quality of the paper 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:20.019
 before packing 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:27.819
 in one hour this establishment produced 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.819
 6,600 packs of printing paper
