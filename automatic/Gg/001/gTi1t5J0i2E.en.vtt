00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
sterile technique and I but what I

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.910 
sterile technique and I but what I

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
think that's a that nature has kind of

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.389 
think that's a that nature has kind of
carried<00:00:55.110> on<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.440> I<00:00:55.559> see<00:00:55.739> that<00:00:55.860> paralleled<00:00:56.280> in

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
carried on and I see that paralleled in

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.569 
carried on and I see that paralleled in
a<00:00:56.460> lot<00:00:56.579> of<00:00:56.670> our<00:00:56.789> staff<00:00:57.059> here<00:00:57.390> I<00:00:58.100> think<00:00:59.100> Nursing

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
a lot of our staff here I think Nursing

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.979 
a lot of our staff here I think Nursing
is<00:00:59.699> a<00:00:59.730> field<00:01:00.090> that<00:01:00.329> enables<00:01:01.230> people<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:01.890> really

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
is a field that enables people to really

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:08.480 
is a field that enables people to really
impact<00:01:03.989> other<00:01:04.619> people's<00:01:05.010> lives<00:01:05.900> to<00:01:07.490> really
