was going to be but the paperwork load
is<00:02:21.340> probably<00:02:21.660> the<00:02:22.660> one<00:02:22.810> thing<00:02:23.050> I<00:02:23.170> wish<00:02:23.380> they

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
is probably the one thing I wish they

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.850 
is probably the one thing I wish they
did<00:02:23.770> a<00:02:23.800> told<00:02:24.130> me<00:02:24.340> I<00:02:24.580> think<00:02:25.450> that's<00:02:25.990> probably<00:02:26.410> I

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
did a told me I think that's probably I

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.450 
did a told me I think that's probably I
mean<00:02:27.760> and<00:02:28.120> teaching<00:02:29.050> is<00:02:29.200> not<00:02:29.230> I<00:02:29.770> don't<00:02:30.340> know

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:30.460 
mean and teaching is not I don't know

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.580 
mean and teaching is not I don't know
it's<00:02:30.730> different<00:02:31.030> every<00:02:31.750> day<00:02:31.780> it's<00:02:32.140> not<00:02:32.290> like

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
it's different every day it's not like

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.140 
it's different every day it's not like
you<00:02:32.830> just<00:02:32.860> plan<00:02:33.460> something<00:02:33.850> and<00:02:34.030> that's

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
you just plan something and that's

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.390 
you just plan something and that's
exactly<00:02:34.390> what's<00:02:34.750> gonna<00:02:34.930> happen<00:02:35.350> it's<00:02:35.950> kind<00:02:36.370> of

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
exactly what's gonna happen it's kind of

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.900 
exactly what's gonna happen it's kind of
different

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
different

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.580 
different
every<00:02:37.120> day<00:02:37.300> you<00:02:37.360> have<00:02:37.450> to<00:02:37.570> be<00:02:37.750> very<00:02:37.960> flexible

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
every day you have to be very flexible

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.840 
every day you have to be very flexible
and<00:02:39.100> willing<00:02:39.580> to<00:02:39.730> change<00:02:40.090> it<00:02:40.360> a<00:02:40.600> drop<00:02:41.260> of<00:02:41.410> a<00:02:41.500> hat

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
and willing to change it a drop of a hat

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.560 
and willing to change it a drop of a hat
but<00:02:42.900> it's<00:02:43.900> basically<00:02:44.350> like<00:02:44.590> a<00:02:44.650> life<00:02:45.040> job<00:02:46.000> it's

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
but it's basically like a life job it's

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.690 
but it's basically like a life job it's
like<00:02:46.840> 24/7<00:02:47.770> you<00:02:47.920> could<00:02:48.040> always<00:02:48.280> be<00:02:48.550> doing

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
like 24/7 you could always be doing

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.699 
like 24/7 you could always be doing
something<00:02:49.050> and<00:02:50.050> you'll<00:02:50.140> never<00:02:50.320> finish

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
something and you'll never finish

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:52.229 
something and you'll never finish
everything<00:02:51.220> you<00:02:51.430> need<00:02:51.580> to<00:02:51.670> get<00:02:51.760> done<00:02:52.000> ever

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
everything you need to get done ever

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:57.750 
everything you need to get done ever
never<00:02:54.750> other<00:02:55.750> than<00:02:56.020> that<00:02:56.170> I<00:02:56.200> think<00:02:56.760> that's

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
never other than that I think that's

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.250 
never other than that I think that's
probably<00:02:58.090> the<00:02:58.360> one<00:02:58.510> thing<00:02:58.660> I<00:02:58.780> wasn't<00:02:59.110> ready

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
probably the one thing I wasn't ready

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.350 
probably the one thing I wasn't ready
for<00:02:59.350> it's<00:02:59.709> just<00:02:59.920> that<00:03:00.130> it's<00:03:00.340> to<00:03:00.640> be<00:03:00.790> effective

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
for it's just that it's to be effective

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.680 
for it's just that it's to be effective
you<00:03:01.570> need<00:03:01.780> to<00:03:01.840> be<00:03:02.140> putting<00:03:02.770> in<00:03:03.070> your<00:03:04.060> all<00:03:04.330> and

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
you need to be putting in your all and

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.150 
you need to be putting in your all and
sometimes<00:03:05.290> it's<00:03:05.620> straining<00:03:06.340> and<00:03:06.880> tiring
