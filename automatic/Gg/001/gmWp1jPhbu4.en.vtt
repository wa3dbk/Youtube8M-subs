know sort of like an allure for a road
car<00:01:01.469> engine<00:01:01.859> it's<00:01:01.979> tiny<00:01:02.719> with<00:01:03.719> so<00:01:03.960> much<00:01:04.140> more

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
car engine it's tiny with so much more

power being developed by energy recovery

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.789 
power being developed by energy recovery
and<00:01:06.720> with<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.080> reintroduction<00:01:07.380> of<00:01:07.710> a

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
and with the reintroduction of a

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.860 
and with the reintroduction of a
turbocharger<00:01:08.190> you've<00:01:09.090> now<00:01:09.299> got<00:01:09.540> much<00:01:09.720> more

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:09.870 
turbocharger you've now got much more

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.600 
turbocharger you've now got much more
cooling<00:01:10.290> for<00:01:10.440> the<00:01:10.500> energy<00:01:10.740> recovery<00:01:11.010> systems

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
cooling for the energy recovery systems

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.820 
cooling for the energy recovery systems
and<00:01:11.850> that<00:01:12.390> will<00:01:12.510> be<00:01:12.630> probably<00:01:13.110> water<00:01:13.350> cooling

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
and that will be probably water cooling

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.350 
and that will be probably water cooling
mainly<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.160> battery<00:01:14.520> pack<00:01:14.730> and<00:01:14.940> the<00:01:15.060> power

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
mainly the battery pack and the power

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.030 
mainly the battery pack and the power
controllers<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.140> then<00:01:16.740> you've<00:01:16.950> obviously

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
controllers and then you've obviously

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.560 
controllers and then you've obviously
got<00:01:17.370> the<00:01:17.430> air<00:01:17.640> that's<00:01:17.880> being<00:01:18.060> compressed<00:01:18.450> by

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
got the air that's being compressed by

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.570 
got the air that's being compressed by
the<00:01:18.690> turbocharger<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:19.620> in<00:01:19.800> the<00:01:19.890> action<00:01:20.520> of

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
the turbocharger and in the action of

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.330 
the turbocharger and in the action of
doing<00:01:20.760> that<00:01:21.060> that<00:01:21.600> air<00:01:21.960> becomes<00:01:22.470> P<00:01:22.860> Cydia

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
doing that that air becomes P Cydia

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.950 
doing that that air becomes P Cydia
which<00:01:23.640> will<00:01:23.820> cost<00:01:24.030> you<00:01:24.210> horsepower<00:01:24.720> so<00:01:24.900> you

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
which will cost you horsepower so you

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.600 
which will cost you horsepower so you
run<00:01:25.290> a<00:01:25.470> charge<00:01:25.770> air<00:01:26.010> cooler<00:01:26.040> or<00:01:26.490> an

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
run a charge air cooler or an

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.000 
run a charge air cooler or an
intercooler<00:01:27.000> to<00:01:27.750> again<00:01:28.140> reduce<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.620> air<00:01:28.770> temp

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.010 
intercooler to again reduce the air temp

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.260 
intercooler to again reduce the air temp
which<00:01:29.100> before<00:01:29.310> it<00:01:29.400> goes<00:01:29.490> into<00:01:29.730> the<00:01:29.880> engine<00:01:30.000> to

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
which before it goes into the engine to

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.540 
which before it goes into the engine to
get<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.480> maximum<00:01:30.840> horsepower<00:01:31.050> so<00:01:32.010> all<00:01:32.250> of<00:01:32.490> a

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:32.550 
get the maximum horsepower so all of a

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:33.980 
get the maximum horsepower so all of a
sudden<00:01:32.880> you've<00:01:33.000> got<00:01:33.030> lots<00:01:33.390> more<00:01:33.540> bits<00:01:33.870> and

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
sudden you've got lots more bits and

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.550 
sudden you've got lots more bits and
pieces<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.410> package<00:01:34.940> so<00:01:35.940> what<00:01:36.060> we<00:01:36.150> have<00:01:36.300> here

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
pieces to package so what we have here

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.650 
pieces to package so what we have here
in<00:01:37.560> blue<00:01:37.860> nearest<00:01:38.610> towards<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.510> bottom

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:39.660 
in blue nearest towards the bottom

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.480 
in blue nearest towards the bottom
that's<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.050> water<00:01:40.260> radiator<00:01:40.770> for<00:01:41.010> the<00:01:41.100> engine

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
that's the water radiator for the engine

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.340 
that's the water radiator for the engine
now<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.030> good<00:01:42.210> thing<00:01:42.360> with<00:01:42.510> actual<00:01:42.870> a<00:01:43.020> the

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
now the good thing with actual a the

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.140 
now the good thing with actual a the
petrol<00:01:43.710> engine<00:01:43.740> itself<00:01:44.190> is<00:01:44.430> produces<00:01:45.000> far

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.150 
petrol engine itself is produces far

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.610 
petrol engine itself is produces far
less<00:01:45.360> heat<00:01:45.540> than<00:01:45.570> it<00:01:45.840> did<00:01:45.960> previously

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:46.620 
less heat than it did previously

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.440 
less heat than it did previously
so<00:01:47.040> those<00:01:47.190> radiator<00:01:47.670> is<00:01:47.850> it<00:01:47.940> and<00:01:48.060> far<00:01:48.210> smaller

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
so those radiator is it and far smaller

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.720 
so those radiator is it and far smaller
probably<00:01:48.900> lest<00:01:49.320> it<00:01:49.470> not<00:01:49.920> quite<00:01:50.130> half<00:01:50.430> of<00:01:50.610> what

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:50.730 
probably lest it not quite half of what

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.240 
probably lest it not quite half of what
they<00:01:50.820> were<00:01:50.850> certainly<00:01:51.840> a<00:01:51.900> lot<00:01:52.020> less<00:01:52.230> and<00:01:53.100> then

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
they were certainly a lot less and then

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.280 
they were certainly a lot less and then
the<00:01:53.400> oil<00:01:53.430> which<00:01:54.060> is<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.300> radiators<00:01:54.960> plural

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
the oil which is the radiators plural

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.200 
the oil which is the radiators plural
you<00:01:55.320> actually<00:01:55.770> it's<00:01:56.100> it's<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:57.060> water

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
you actually it's it's the water

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.000 
you actually it's it's the water
radiator<00:01:57.720> now<00:01:57.930> just<00:01:58.170> probably<00:01:58.320> well<00:01:58.680> it<00:01:58.800> the

00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.010 
radiator now just probably well it the

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:00.200 
radiator now just probably well it the
teams<00:01:59.250> have<00:01:59.460> different<00:01:59.730> options<00:02:00.000> but<00:02:00.090> they

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
teams have different options but they

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.700 
teams have different options but they
probably<00:02:00.330> run<00:02:00.570> a<00:02:00.600> single<00:02:00.990> water<00:02:01.140> radiator

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
probably run a single water radiator

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.920 
probably run a single water radiator
they'll<00:02:02.400> run<00:02:02.580> a<00:02:02.610> single<00:02:02.880> oil<00:02:03.210> radiator<00:02:03.480> for

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
they'll run a single oil radiator for

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.060 
they'll run a single oil radiator for
the<00:02:03.990> engine<00:02:04.230> which<00:02:04.350> is<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.530> red<00:02:04.710> one<00:02:04.890> that<00:02:04.920> we

they'll split the intercooler into two
slightly<00:03:05.970> smaller<00:03:06.209> ones<00:03:06.510> and<00:03:06.900> because<00:03:07.349> it's

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
slightly smaller ones and because it's

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:09.110 
slightly smaller ones and because it's
so<00:03:07.950> much<00:03:08.160> thicker<00:03:08.430> it's<00:03:08.640> quite<00:03:08.819> hard<00:03:09.000> to

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
so much thicker it's quite hard to

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.520 
so much thicker it's quite hard to
package<00:03:09.480> it's<00:03:09.660> also<00:03:09.810> hard<00:03:10.079> to<00:03:10.140> get<00:03:10.290> the<00:03:10.410> air

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530

was<00:04:31.900> going<00:04:31.960> to<00:04:32.080> be<00:04:32.169> my<00:04:32.289> next<00:04:32.470> question<00:04:32.560> the

00:04:32.999 --> 00:04:33.009 
was going to be my next question the

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:35.040 
was going to be my next question the
radiators<00:04:33.580> themselves<00:04:34.449> they<00:04:34.720> still

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
radiators themselves they still

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:36.839 
radiators themselves they still
basically<00:04:35.560> made<00:04:35.919> the<00:04:35.949> same<00:04:36.370> way<00:04:36.580> same

00:04:36.839 --> 00:04:36.849 
basically made the same way same

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:39.270 
basically made the same way same
materials<00:04:37.389> I<00:04:37.599> think<00:04:37.990> you<00:04:38.500> could<00:04:38.740> describe<00:04:39.069> as

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
materials I think you could describe as

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.309 
materials I think you could describe as
an<00:04:39.520> f-1<00:04:39.669> radiator<00:04:40.180> as<00:04:40.360> a<00:04:40.389> pretty<00:04:40.720> conventional

00:04:41.309 --> 00:04:41.319 
an f-1 radiator as a pretty conventional

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:44.490 
an f-1 radiator as a pretty conventional
in<00:04:41.409> terms<00:04:41.620> of<00:04:41.860> its<00:04:42.690> aluminium<00:04:43.690> tubing<00:04:44.110> okay

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500 
in terms of its aluminium tubing okay

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:45.839 
in terms of its aluminium tubing okay
it's<00:04:44.620> a<00:04:44.650> very<00:04:44.770> complicated<00:04:45.129> shape<00:04:45.669> with

00:04:45.839 --> 00:04:45.849 
it's a very complicated shape with

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:48.180 
it's a very complicated shape with
internal<00:04:46.509> turbulences<00:04:47.289> I<00:04:47.680> think<00:04:47.860> they<00:04:47.949> call

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.190 
internal turbulences I think they call

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:50.460 
internal turbulences I think they call
them<00:04:48.430> but<00:04:49.270> pretty<00:04:49.509> much<00:04:49.569> it's<00:04:50.020> you<00:04:50.379> know

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
them but pretty much it's you know

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:52.950 
them but pretty much it's you know
they're<00:04:50.710> all<00:04:50.830> welded<00:04:51.220> up<00:04:51.310> to<00:04:51.720> rows<00:04:52.720> and<00:04:52.930> rows

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
they're all welded up to rows and rows

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.730 
they're all welded up to rows and rows

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:56.740 
of these cause to side tanks so it's all

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.800 
of these cause to side tanks so it's all
very<00:04:56.949> conventional<00:04:57.220> there's<00:04:58.060> yet<00:04:58.360> to<00:04:58.509> be<00:04:58.630> that

big breakthrough of you know carbon

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.330 
big breakthrough of you know carbon
nanotechnology<00:05:02.020> or<00:05:02.050> something<00:05:02.560> clever<00:05:02.770> to

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:05.889 
really improve cooling beyond the next

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:07.320 
really improve cooling beyond the next
step<00:05:06.159> if<00:05:06.340> someone<00:05:06.610> could<00:05:06.759> do<00:05:06.880> that<00:05:06.909> would<00:05:07.180> be<00:05:07.300> a

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:07.330 
step if someone could do that would be a

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.180 
step if someone could do that would be a
massive<00:05:07.870> benefit<00:05:08.349> and<00:05:08.770> there's<00:05:09.099> no

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:09.190 
massive benefit and there's no

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:10.920 
massive benefit and there's no
regulation<00:05:09.759> in<00:05:09.909> place<00:05:09.940> to<00:05:10.539> prevent<00:05:10.810> that

happening

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:13.320 
happening
so<00:05:11.800> there's<00:05:12.009> a<00:05:12.069> tunnel<00:05:12.340> that<00:05:12.610> can<00:05:12.759> be<00:05:12.849> -<00:05:13.210> if

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.330 
so there's a tunnel that can be - if

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.120 
so there's a tunnel that can be - if
there's<00:05:13.479> any<00:05:13.599> specification<00:05:14.289> sawn<00:05:14.500> radiators

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.130 
there's any specification sawn radiators

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.100 
there's any specification sawn radiators
I'm<00:05:15.250> sure<00:05:15.430> if<00:05:16.030> someone<00:05:16.389> suddenly<00:05:16.569> found<00:05:16.870> a

I'm sure if someone suddenly found a

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:18.839 
I'm sure if someone suddenly found a
half<00:05:17.530> million<00:05:17.860> pound<00:05:18.039> radiator<00:05:18.430> that<00:05:18.669> would

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:18.849 
half million pound radiator that would

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:20.700 
half million pound radiator that would
make<00:05:19.360> their<00:05:19.539> side<00:05:19.719> pods<00:05:19.960> half<00:05:20.169> the<00:05:20.319> size<00:05:20.500> and

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710 
make their side pods half the size and

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:22.920 
make their side pods half the size and
the<00:05:20.800> rules<00:05:21.190> would<00:05:21.340> soon<00:05:21.550> change<00:05:21.629> and<00:05:22.629> scarves

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:22.930 
the rules would soon change and scarves

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:24.180 
the rules would soon change and scarves
you<00:05:23.020> got<00:05:23.169> me<00:05:23.289> into<00:05:23.440> cooler<00:05:23.680> on<00:05:23.770> the<00:05:23.800> left<00:05:24.009> is

you got me into cooler on the left is

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:25.589 
you got me into cooler on the left is
that<00:05:24.310> just<00:05:24.550> you<00:05:24.699> thinking<00:05:25.090> that<00:05:25.240> or<00:05:25.389> do<00:05:25.539> you

00:05:25.589 --> 00:05:25.599 
that just you thinking that or do you

that just you thinking that or do you
think<00:05:25.659> that's<00:05:25.960> the<00:05:26.169> way<00:05:27.210> it<00:05:28.210> will<00:05:28.360> be<00:05:28.419> very

00:05:29.249 --> 00:05:29.259 
think that's the way it will be very

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:32.219 
think that's the way it will be very

much down to what teams in an energy
manufacturers<00:05:32.800> want<00:05:33.039> to<00:05:33.159> do<00:05:33.900> even<00:05:34.900> teams<00:05:35.139> with

the same engine manufacturer may decide

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:39.310 
to run slightly different layouts it's

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:40.620 
to run slightly different layouts it's
all<00:05:39.460> pretty<00:05:39.639> much<00:05:39.729> just<00:05:40.000> a<00:05:40.060> case<00:05:40.240> of<00:05:40.389> where<00:05:40.539> you

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:40.630 
all pretty much just a case of where you

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:42.209 
all pretty much just a case of where you
run<00:05:40.779> your<00:05:40.930> ductwork<00:05:41.259> and<00:05:41.620> now<00:05:41.860> you<00:05:41.919> want<00:05:42.190> to

00:05:42.209 --> 00:05:42.219 
run your ductwork and now you want to

00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:44.370 
run your ductwork and now you want to
know<00:05:42.279> your<00:05:42.460> iPod's<00:05:43.000> out<00:05:43.180> but<00:05:43.539> is<00:05:43.659> that<00:05:43.810> is<00:05:44.110> the

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:44.380 
know your iPod's out but is that is the

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:46.260 
know your iPod's out but is that is the
left-hand<00:05:44.860> intercooler<00:05:45.669> section<00:05:46.120> that

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:46.270 
left-hand intercooler section that

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:46.920 
left-hand intercooler section that
you've<00:05:46.389> got<00:05:46.539> there

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:46.930 
you've got there

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:48.269 
you've got there
and<00:05:47.020> the<00:05:47.259> right-hand<00:05:47.469> Raider<00:05:47.800> is<00:05:48.009> one

00:05:48.269 --> 00:05:48.279 
and the right-hand Raider is one

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:49.680 
and the right-hand Raider is one
actually<00:05:48.819> heavier<00:05:49.150> than<00:05:49.270> the<00:05:49.330> other<00:05:49.479> the

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:49.690 
actually heavier than the other the

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:50.790 
actually heavier than the other the
intercooler<00:05:50.020> because<00:05:50.380> it's<00:05:50.529> a<00:05:50.620> bigger

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:50.800 
intercooler because it's a bigger

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.529 
intercooler because it's a bigger
radiator<00:05:51.250> and<00:05:51.520> would<00:05:51.699> you<00:05:51.819> would<00:05:52.330> you<00:05:52.389> be

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:52.539 
radiator and would you would you be

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:55.100 
radiator and would you would you be
thinking<00:05:52.690> in<00:05:52.930> terms<00:05:53.199> of<00:05:53.610> Interlagos<00:05:54.610> is

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:55.110 
thinking in terms of Interlagos is

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:57.420 
thinking in terms of Interlagos is
anti-clockwise<00:05:56.110> you<00:05:56.800> might<00:05:56.949> want<00:05:57.159> to<00:05:57.190> put<00:05:57.340> the

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:57.430 
anti-clockwise you might want to put the

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:00.240 
anti-clockwise you might want to put the
weight<00:05:57.610> on<00:05:57.639> the<00:05:58.090> inside<00:05:58.469> as<00:05:59.469> I<00:05:59.680> understand<00:06:00.069> the

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:00.250 
weight on the inside as I understand the

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:02.550 
weight on the inside as I understand the
teams<00:06:00.520> aren't<00:06:00.759> that<00:06:00.940> much<00:06:01.330> optically<00:06:02.169> worried

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:02.560 
teams aren't that much optically worried

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.769 
teams aren't that much optically worried
about<00:06:02.770> left<00:06:03.039> to<00:06:03.190> right<00:06:03.370> they<00:06:04.120> can<00:06:04.300> balanced<00:06:04.659> up

00:06:04.769 --> 00:06:04.779 
about left to right they can balanced up

00:06:04.779 --> 00:06:05.939 
about left to right they can balanced up
in<00:06:04.900> other<00:06:04.990> areas<00:06:05.080> of<00:06:05.469> the<00:06:05.529> chassis

00:06:05.939 --> 00:06:05.949 
in other areas of the chassis

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:08.100 
in other areas of the chassis
so<00:06:06.550> is<00:06:06.819> but<00:06:07.300> if<00:06:07.360> they've<00:06:07.509> got<00:06:07.719> that<00:06:07.870> weight

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:08.110 
so is but if they've got that weight

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:10.170 
so is but if they've got that weight
difference<00:06:08.650> would<00:06:09.430> it<00:06:09.580> be<00:06:09.669> something<00:06:10.060> they

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:10.180 
difference would it be something they

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:11.939 
difference would it be something they
would<00:06:10.330> use<00:06:10.630> I<00:06:10.870> don't<00:06:11.409> think<00:06:11.620> so

00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:11.949 
would use I don't think so

00:06:11.949 --> 00:06:13.920 
would use I don't think so
I<00:06:11.979> don't<00:06:12.669> I<00:06:12.819> don't<00:06:12.849> think<00:06:13.180> it's<00:06:13.330> it's<00:06:13.599> one<00:06:13.810> of

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:13.930 
I don't I don't think it's it's one of

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:15.360 
I don't I don't think it's it's one of
the<00:06:13.990> primary<00:06:14.169> considerations<00:06:15.099> it's<00:06:15.219> been

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:15.370 
the primary considerations it's been

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:17.070 
the primary considerations it's been
much<00:06:15.520> more<00:06:15.699> arid<00:06:15.909> I<00:06:16.000> mean<00:06:16.120> you<00:06:16.180> driven<00:06:16.479> they've

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:17.080 
much more arid I mean you driven they've

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:18.659 
much more arid I mean you driven they've
got<00:06:17.259> lots<00:06:17.500> of<00:06:17.620> electronic<00:06:18.069> boxes<00:06:18.430> in<00:06:18.580> the

got lots of electronic boxes in the

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:20.490 
got lots of electronic boxes in the
chassis<00:06:18.849> and<00:06:19.150> if<00:06:19.240> they<00:06:19.360> find<00:06:19.599> one<00:06:19.870> side<00:06:20.110> it<00:06:20.319> is

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:20.500 
chassis and if they find one side it is

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.279 
chassis and if they find one side it is
unduly<00:06:21.250> heavy<00:06:21.580> just<00:06:22.360> moving<00:06:22.779> like<00:06:22.990> the<00:06:23.110> power

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:23.289 
unduly heavy just moving like the power

00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:25.620 
unduly heavy just moving like the power
box<00:06:23.620> or<00:06:23.979> even<00:06:24.880> shifting<00:06:25.210> the<00:06:25.270> batteries

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:25.630 
box or even shifting the batteries

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:27.209 
box or even shifting the batteries
inside<00:06:25.930> underneath<00:06:26.289> the<00:06:26.440> fuel<00:06:26.620> tank<00:06:26.860> slightly

00:06:27.209 --> 00:06:27.219 
inside underneath the fuel tank slightly

00:06:27.219 --> 00:06:29.159 
inside underneath the fuel tank slightly
would<00:06:27.370> be<00:06:27.490> enough<00:06:27.699> to<00:06:27.880> balance<00:06:28.569> the<00:06:28.810> car<00:06:28.990> off

00:06:29.159 --> 00:06:29.169 
would be enough to balance the car off

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:32.070 
would be enough to balance the car off
now<00:06:29.800> I<00:06:29.830> was<00:06:29.949> talking<00:06:30.069> to<00:06:30.310> one<00:06:30.580> of<00:06:30.610> the<00:06:31.080> racecar

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:32.080 
now I was talking to one of the racecar

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:35.279 
now I was talking to one of the racecar
suit<00:06:32.529> manufacturers<00:06:33.460> just<00:06:34.330> yesterday

00:06:35.279 --> 00:06:35.289 
suit manufacturers just yesterday

00:06:35.289 --> 00:06:36.989 
suit manufacturers just yesterday
about<00:06:35.469> whether<00:06:35.889> or<00:06:36.099> not<00:06:36.189> they're<00:06:36.430> looking<00:06:36.819> at

00:06:36.989 --> 00:06:36.999 
about whether or not they're looking at

00:06:36.999 --> 00:06:39.980 
about whether or not they're looking at
race<00:06:37.990> suits<00:06:38.289> that<00:06:38.409> are<00:06:38.559> more<00:06:38.969> thermally

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:39.990 
race suits that are more thermally

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:43.170 
race suits that are more thermally
protective<00:06:40.990> than<00:06:41.349> in<00:06:41.710> the<00:06:41.889> past<00:06:42.069> and<00:06:42.460> they<00:06:42.610> had

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:43.180 
protective than in the past and they had

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:45.089 
protective than in the past and they had
to<00:06:43.389> confess<00:06:44.110> that<00:06:44.289> they<00:06:44.439> were<00:06:44.499> that<00:06:45.039> they

00:06:45.089 --> 00:06:45.099 
to confess that they were that they

00:06:45.099 --> 00:06:46.649 
to confess that they were that they
hadn't<00:06:45.490> got<00:06:45.610> that<00:06:45.639> far<00:06:45.969> yet<00:06:46.029> but<00:06:46.330> it's

00:06:46.649 --> 00:06:46.659 
hadn't got that far yet but it's

00:06:46.659 --> 00:06:48.149 
hadn't got that far yet but it's
definitely<00:06:46.749> something<00:06:47.469> on<00:06:47.559> the<00:06:47.649> agenda<00:06:47.680> but

00:06:48.149 --> 00:06:48.159 
definitely something on the agenda but

00:06:48.159 --> 00:06:50.249 
definitely something on the agenda but
they<00:06:48.639> may<00:06:48.819> have<00:06:48.849> to<00:06:49.089> look<00:06:49.330> at<00:06:49.509> but<00:06:49.659> the<00:06:49.779> drivers

00:06:50.249 --> 00:06:50.259 
they may have to look at but the drivers

00:06:50.259 --> 00:06:52.049 
they may have to look at but the drivers
are<00:06:50.409> going<00:06:50.529> to<00:06:50.619> be<00:06:50.770> in<00:06:51.399> a<00:06:51.550> hotter<00:06:51.789> environment

00:06:52.049 --> 00:06:52.059 
are going to be in a hotter environment

00:06:52.059 --> 00:06:55.079 
are going to be in a hotter environment
they'd<00:06:52.960> ever<00:06:53.460> absolutely<00:06:54.460> yeah<00:06:54.819> I<00:06:54.849> mean

00:06:55.079 --> 00:06:55.089 
they'd ever absolutely yeah I mean

00:06:55.089 --> 00:06:56.309 
they'd ever absolutely yeah I mean
they're<00:06:55.240> gonna<00:06:55.330> have<00:06:55.509> a<00:06:55.539> very<00:06:55.719> hot<00:06:55.960> battery

00:06:56.309 --> 00:06:56.319 
they're gonna have a very hot battery

00:06:56.319 --> 00:06:58.170 
they're gonna have a very hot battery
pack<00:06:56.529> which<00:06:57.039> is<00:06:57.159> much<00:06:57.339> larger<00:06:57.610> and<00:06:57.939> that<00:06:57.999> will

00:06:58.170 --> 00:06:58.180 
pack which is much larger and that will

00:06:58.180 --> 00:06:59.670 
pack which is much larger and that will
be<00:06:58.300> internal<00:06:58.809> heating<00:06:58.960> the<00:06:59.139> fuel<00:06:59.349> lock<00:06:59.499> which

00:06:59.670 --> 00:06:59.680 
be internal heating the fuel lock which

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.980 
be internal heating the fuel lock which
is<00:06:59.800> all<00:06:59.919> very<00:07:00.699> close<00:07:01.059> to<00:07:01.240> their<00:07:01.389> backs<00:07:01.659> and

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:01.990 
is all very close to their backs and

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:03.899 
is all very close to their backs and
because<00:07:02.800> the<00:07:02.919> side<00:07:03.129> pods<00:07:03.399> are<00:07:03.490> gonna<00:07:03.580> be<00:07:03.729> so

00:07:03.899 --> 00:07:03.909 
because the side pods are gonna be so

00:07:03.909 --> 00:07:05.189 
because the side pods are gonna be so
crowded<00:07:04.240> they're<00:07:04.629> going<00:07:04.749> to<00:07:04.809> be<00:07:04.899> starting<00:07:05.139> to

00:07:05.189 --> 00:07:05.199 
crowded they're going to be starting to

00:07:05.199 --> 00:07:06.359 
crowded they're going to be starting to
move<00:07:05.289> some<00:07:05.559> of<00:07:05.589> the<00:07:05.710> smaller<00:07:05.949> electronic

00:07:06.359 --> 00:07:06.369 
move some of the smaller electronic

00:07:06.369 --> 00:07:08.159 
move some of the smaller electronic
boxes<00:07:06.759> into<00:07:07.330> the<00:07:07.539> cockpit<00:07:07.930> because<00:07:08.080> it's

00:07:08.159 --> 00:07:08.169 
boxes into the cockpit because it's

00:07:08.169 --> 00:07:09.540 
boxes into the cockpit because it's
actually<00:07:08.289> a<00:07:08.559> surprising<00:07:09.009> amount<00:07:09.099> of<00:07:09.309> space

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:09.550 
actually a surprising amount of space

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:11.040 
actually a surprising amount of space
inside<00:07:09.909> the<00:07:10.089> cockpit<00:07:10.240> as<00:07:10.509> much<00:07:10.689> as<00:07:10.839> everyone

inside the cockpit as much as everyone

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:13.260 
inside the cockpit as much as everyone
thinks<00:07:11.289> an<00:07:11.559> f1<00:07:12.189> car<00:07:12.219> is<00:07:12.580> cramped<00:07:12.969> there<00:07:13.119> will

thinks an f1 car is cramped there will

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:15.449 
thinks an f1 car is cramped there will
be<00:07:13.300> sort<00:07:14.050> of<00:07:14.080> that<00:07:14.139> much<00:07:14.529> space<00:07:14.860> to<00:07:14.919> the<00:07:15.249> side

00:07:15.449 --> 00:07:15.459 
be sort of that much space to the side
