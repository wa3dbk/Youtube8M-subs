00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:11.480
 dear media representatives warmly 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.039
 Welcome to our press conference 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.170
 after the match against borussia dortmund 

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:16.460
 we welcome our guests jürgen klopp 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.050
 and his coach Frank Kramer 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.050
 mr klopp have the first word that 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:32.509
 would have a hairy affair today 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:36.170
 it is not possible 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:37.610
 become because we from the beginning 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.900
 my team was highly concentrated 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.170
 has a great a great first half 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:46.790
 played 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:48.799
 outstanding playful very very strong 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.989
 in counterpressing that was actually like that 

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:54.500
 the key to almost everyone 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:56.390
 to tell honestly in the back but if 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.150
 one very often after ball losses because 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:02.900
 she directly conquers then almost 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:04.460
 again had a hard account and you 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.110
 the great end played and 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.700
 Highly deserved I think led to 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.390
 half 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:17.960
 the second half was then as it was 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:19.399
 when it became clearly yes again 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.780
 Back in the fight I believe that 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:22.159
 can be really impressive 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.270
 impressive as the team mean 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:24.859
 Teams first half occurred 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.490
 is that one has noticed then synonymous with 

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:30.229
 opponent at half time could colleague then 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.719
 to readjust the video and then know 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:34.039
 it was a normal game we still have 

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:35.420
 one or the other possibility, there was 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:38.270
 It was nice that Robert Lewandowski that 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.280
 because also has made opponents 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:44.090
 Centro tells it is in the frame 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:46.640
 I stayed in front of it 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.479
 when we say win then say 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:52.520
 me that the place is really bad 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:54.319
 So the 16 already made it but it 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.969
 let's assume that herbs 

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:58.310
 leads next also plays soccer and 

00:01:55.969 --> 00:02:01.069
 again as always a past one 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.200
 playfully good team have senses 

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:03.920
 of football 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.749
 maybe think about it 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.700
 want to replace these cash registers 

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:10.130
 because that is unique in the world 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.180
 Bundesliga in a negative sense 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.710
 all good 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:19.750
 yes, see you soon 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:22.930
 thank you thank your frank Conclusion 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:25.720
 Of course, good day first , of course, does not fall 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.200
 quite so easy after such a game 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.220
 to find correct words 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.200
 I think in the first half always 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.090
 according to all rules of the art vermöbelt 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.350
 become 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.410
 It does not take long to talk 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:40.000
 we have no phase of the first 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.200
 half-time access to our opponent 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.930
 were always too far away 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.670
 that already has something in part 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.320
 looked despondent and helpless 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.950
 Of course, dortmund has it very well 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:56.490
 made that is clear though 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:59.830
 Nonetheless , you have to be there, of course 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:01.930
 his attitude to try differently 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:06.130
 offer and have my first 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:08.590
 halfway in no way done and 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:12.390
 are therefore very clear 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.390
 result of half-time gone 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:19.410
 Two things were good this day 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:21.490
 one was that the spectator 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:27.040
 But it was really sensational 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:27.970
 sensational though the team 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.530
 have supported 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.020
 that was really total for me 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.220
 I really have to say impressive 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.030
 and for that I would like to completely 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.190
 thank you 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:40.090
 that was so fair and I know 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:41.140
 not if you are so in shape so me 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.030
 at least have not seen it yet 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.640
 So it was a guarantee and the second point 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:48.520
 was that dortmund in the second 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:52.180
 halfway down a proper gang 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:53.320
 has switched since you have the positive 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.130
 things are summarized 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.130
 Thank you very much
