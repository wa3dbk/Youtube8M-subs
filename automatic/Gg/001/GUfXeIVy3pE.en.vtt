00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.609 
now I think this was released for Xbox

and PlayStation if you preorder it
however<00:00:23.160> it's<00:00:23.310> just<00:00:23.369> appeared<00:00:23.730> on<00:00:23.820> Steam<00:00:24.150> in

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
however it's just appeared on Steam in

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.790 
however it's just appeared on Steam in
the<00:00:24.359> last<00:00:24.539> couple<00:00:24.810> of<00:00:24.840> days<00:00:25.019> so<00:00:25.080> I<00:00:25.260> decided<00:00:25.619> to

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
the last couple of days so I decided to

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.380 
the last couple of days so I decided to
buy<00:00:25.920> it<00:00:25.949> and<00:00:26.130> give<00:00:26.279> it<00:00:26.369> a<00:00:26.430> go<00:00:26.550> now<00:00:26.730> did<00:00:27.060> take<00:00:27.210> me

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
buy it and give it a go now did take me

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.730 
buy it and give it a go now did take me
quite<00:00:27.510> a<00:00:27.599> bit<00:00:27.689> to<00:00:27.810> buy<00:00:27.990> this<00:00:28.050> even<00:00:28.500> though<00:00:28.590> it

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
quite a bit to buy this even though it

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.070 
quite a bit to buy this even though it
is<00:00:28.890> only<00:00:29.189> five<00:00:29.519> dollars<00:00:29.789> on<00:00:29.939> Steam<00:00:30.330> because

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
is only five dollars on Steam because

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.540 
is only five dollars on Steam because
the<00:00:31.320> game<00:00:31.500> itself<00:00:31.859> wasn't<00:00:32.099> really<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.520> best

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
the game itself wasn't really the best

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.220 
the game itself wasn't really the best
but<00:00:32.940> I<00:00:32.969> decided<00:00:33.360> to<00:00:33.540> give<00:00:33.660> it<00:00:33.750> a<00:00:33.780> go<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:33.930> I<00:00:34.110> was

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
but I decided to give it a go and I was

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.840 
but I decided to give it a go and I was
actually<00:00:34.380> kind<00:00:34.739> of<00:00:34.829> surprised<00:00:35.160> how<00:00:35.399> fun<00:00:35.640> it<00:00:35.760> is

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
actually kind of surprised how fun it is

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.910 
actually kind of surprised how fun it is

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
just to have a herd mode instead of

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.530 
just to have a herd mode instead of
having<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.309> go<00:00:38.430> around<00:00:38.730> and<00:00:38.879> play<00:00:39.059> all<00:00:39.390> the

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
don't really serve a purpose in this for

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.209 
don't really serve a purpose in this for
the<00:00:55.230> most<00:00:55.379> part<00:00:55.620> you're<00:00:55.710> just<00:00:55.829> gonna<00:00:55.920> want<00:00:56.160> to

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
the most part you're just gonna want to

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.099 
the most part you're just gonna want to
drop<00:00:56.399> them<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:56.850> pick<00:00:57.180> up<00:00:57.270> more<00:00:57.420> guns<00:00:57.690> now<00:00:58.020> the

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
drop them and pick up more guns now the

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.720 
drop them and pick up more guns now the
way<00:00:58.230> herd<00:00:58.469> mode<00:00:58.710> works<00:00:58.949> is<00:00:59.190> there's<00:00:59.340> only<00:00:59.489> one

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
way herd mode works is there's only one

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.849 
way herd mode works is there's only one
map<00:00:59.969> and<00:01:00.180> this<00:01:00.390> map<00:01:00.449> opens<00:01:01.109> up<00:01:01.320> depending<00:01:01.710> on

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
map and this map opens up depending on

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.349 
map and this map opens up depending on
how<00:01:01.949> many<00:01:02.010> waves<00:01:02.309> you've<00:01:02.520> done<00:01:02.730> so<00:01:02.910> I<00:01:02.940> think<00:01:03.059> it

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
how many waves you've done so I think it

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.420 
how many waves you've done so I think it
likes<00:01:03.539> five<00:01:03.989> waves<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.470> certain<00:01:04.769> area<00:01:04.920> opens<00:01:05.280> up

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
likes five waves a certain area opens up

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.130 
likes five waves a certain area opens up
and<00:01:05.640> you<00:01:05.670> can<00:01:05.970> access<00:01:06.360> different<00:01:06.570> guns<00:01:06.960> in

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
and you can access different guns in

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.170 
and you can access different guns in
that<00:01:07.200> area<00:01:07.560> now<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.070> guns<00:01:08.340> spawned<00:01:08.729> randomly

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
that area now the guns spawned randomly

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.490 
that area now the guns spawned randomly
throughout<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.570> map<00:01:09.720> sometimes<00:01:10.049> they'll

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
throughout the map sometimes they'll

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.929 
throughout the map sometimes they'll
spawn<00:01:10.770> in<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:10.950> same<00:01:11.130> areas<00:01:11.460> other<00:01:11.640> times

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
spawn in the same areas other times

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.070 
spawn in the same areas other times
they'll<00:01:12.090> spawn<00:01:12.299> in<00:01:12.390> different<00:01:12.689> areas<00:01:12.930> so<00:01:13.020> you

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
they'll spawn in different areas so you

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.390 
they'll spawn in different areas so you
need<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:13.380> go<00:01:13.500> around<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:13.830> look<00:01:13.979> for<00:01:14.159> them<00:01:14.250> and

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
need to go around and look for them and

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.219 
need to go around and look for them and
so<00:01:14.909> for<00:01:15.119> example<00:01:15.210> you<00:01:15.600> can<00:01:15.750> find<00:01:16.020> like<00:01:16.170> a

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
so for example you can find like a

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.050 
so for example you can find like a
semi-auto<00:01:16.830> rifle<00:01:17.369> around<00:01:17.610> there<00:01:17.759> you<00:01:17.909> can

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
semi-auto rifle around there you can

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.789 
semi-auto rifle around there you can
actually<00:01:18.390> sometimes<00:01:18.630> spawn<00:01:19.110> with<00:01:19.259> that<00:01:19.439> as

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
actually sometimes spawn with that as

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.530 
actually sometimes spawn with that as
well<00:01:20.009> as<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.250> assault<00:01:20.520> rifle<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.270> sniper

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
well as the assault rifle and the sniper

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.820 
well as the assault rifle and the sniper
but<00:01:21.869> yeah<00:01:21.990> it<00:01:22.080> seems<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.380> little<00:01:22.500> bit<00:01:22.710> odd<00:01:22.799> that

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
but yeah it seems a little bit odd that

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.740 
but yeah it seems a little bit odd that
there<00:01:23.130> are<00:01:23.220> so<00:01:23.369> many<00:01:23.430> melee<00:01:23.939> weapons<00:01:24.299> in<00:01:24.509> this

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
there are so many melee weapons in this

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.719 
there are so many melee weapons in this
mode<00:01:25.140> considering<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:25.920> fact<00:01:26.159> is<00:01:26.369> you<00:01:26.549> don't

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
mode considering the fact is you don't

so<00:01:50.820> I<00:01:51.030> personally<00:01:51.600> find<00:01:51.810> this<00:01:51.990> DLC<00:01:52.500> more<00:01:52.740> fun

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
so I personally find this DLC more fun

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.260 
so I personally find this DLC more fun
than<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.250> actual<00:01:53.520> game<00:01:53.610> of<00:01:53.909> survival

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
than the actual game of survival

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.940 
than the actual game of survival
instinct<00:01:54.810> so<00:01:55.170> I<00:01:55.200> kind<00:01:55.560> of<00:01:55.649> wished<00:01:55.829> that

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
instinct so I kind of wished that

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.100 
instinct so I kind of wished that
instead<00:01:56.340> of<00:01:56.399> making<00:01:56.610> a<00:01:56.850> full<00:01:57.119> survival

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
instead of making a full survival

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.810 
instead of making a full survival
instinct<00:01:58.530> game<00:01:58.740> with<00:01:58.979> a<00:01:59.009> storyline<00:01:59.579> that

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
instinct game with a storyline that

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.639 
instinct game with a storyline that
didn't<00:02:00.360> really<00:02:00.659> matter<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:01.170> didn't<00:02:01.409> really

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
didn't really matter and didn't really

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.440 
didn't really matter and didn't really
make<00:02:01.799> any<00:02:02.009> sense<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:02.430> begin<00:02:02.579> with<00:02:02.850> it<00:02:03.090> probably

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
make any sense to begin with it probably

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.789 
make any sense to begin with it probably
would<00:02:03.570> have<00:02:03.600> been<00:02:03.689> better<00:02:03.810> if<00:02:04.110> they<00:02:04.229> put<00:02:04.469> more

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
would have been better if they put more

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.530 
would have been better if they put more
of<00:02:04.860> their<00:02:05.130> team<00:02:05.399> on<00:02:05.549> making<00:02:05.880> this<00:02:06.000> survival

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.510 
of their team on making this survival
mode<00:02:06.750> and<00:02:06.960> basically<00:02:07.590> had<00:02:07.770> made<00:02:07.950> it<00:02:08.099> like<00:02:08.220> a<00:02:08.250> 4

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
mode and basically had made it like a 4

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.160

so<00:02:13.500> kind<00:02:13.709> of<00:02:13.800> like<00:02:14.010> what<00:02:14.459> you<00:02:14.580> see<00:02:14.790> in<00:02:14.880> college

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
so kind of like what you see in college

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.580 
so kind of like what you see in college

itself more seriously like this because

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:19.820 
itself more seriously like this because
for<00:02:18.599> the<00:02:18.690> most<00:02:18.870> part<00:02:19.140> it's<00:02:19.230> kind<00:02:19.290> of<00:02:19.590> hard<00:02:19.739> to

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
for the most part it's kind of hard to

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.100 
for the most part it's kind of hard to
find<00:02:20.069> a<00:02:20.310> first<00:02:20.700> person<00:02:20.910> zombie<00:02:21.480> game<00:02:21.690> that<00:02:21.989> is

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
kind of serious so for example we do

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.430 
kind of serious so for example we do
have<00:02:23.940> the<00:02:24.120> call<00:02:24.300> of<00:02:24.420> duty<00:02:24.450> zombies<00:02:24.660> but<00:02:25.140> I<00:02:25.170> kind

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
have the call of duty zombies but I kind

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.930 
have the call of duty zombies but I kind
of<00:02:25.530> find<00:02:25.739> that<00:02:25.860> that's<00:02:26.010> kind<00:02:26.430> of<00:02:26.489> a<00:02:26.580> bit<00:02:26.730> silly

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
of find that that's kind of a bit silly

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.490 
of find that that's kind of a bit silly

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
whereas The Walking Dead survival

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.440 
whereas The Walking Dead survival
instinct<00:02:32.190> does<00:02:32.370> so<00:02:32.880> we'll<00:02:33.060> think<00:02:33.209> it<00:02:33.330> would

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
instinct does so we'll think it would

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:34.820 
instinct does so we'll think it would
have<00:02:33.569> been<00:02:33.600> better<00:02:33.840> for<00:02:33.959> them<00:02:34.200> to<00:02:34.230> put<00:02:34.709> their

have been better for them to put their

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.320 
have been better for them to put their
effort<00:02:35.069> into<00:02:35.250> this<00:02:35.340> and<00:02:35.520> maybe<00:02:35.970> they<00:02:36.270> could

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
effort into this and maybe they could

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:37.760 
effort into this and maybe they could
have<00:02:36.510> released<00:02:36.810> it<00:02:36.989> for<00:02:37.110> a<00:02:37.170> lot<00:02:37.319> cheaper<00:02:37.590> and

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
have released it for a lot cheaper and

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:38.960 
have released it for a lot cheaper and
it<00:02:37.890> would<00:02:37.980> have<00:02:38.100> received<00:02:38.310> a<00:02:38.580> lot<00:02:38.760> better

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
it would have received a lot better

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.850

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
that this would be more pre playable
