 drive your montenbike safely and efficiently 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.829
 it is important to know some indispensable subjects such as physiology 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:27.439
 mechanical athletic preparation cartography 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.819
 specific technique of the vehicle 

00:00:30.819 --> 00:00:34.980
 in this video we recorded during a first level course of the 

00:00:34.979 --> 00:00:36.570
 montebike italian schools 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.510
 the subjects that can be useful for learning are summarized 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.510
 modern fontecchio techniques 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.620
 let's start our journey 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.250
 starting from fulgheri in Trentino 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.720
 excellent company of the aspiring stones point I love the course for the qualification of 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.650

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:04.450
 organized by the msp italia body for sports promotion of the body

 italian school about a boy 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.350
 many come from distant Italian regions 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.170
 and for the first time they will know the routes at high altitude 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.700
 tracks of the plateaus of Folgaria Lavarone TV7 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.920
 the evocative landscapes of the dolomites 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.119
 with the palatine ideal places for the mouse to dance 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.470
 they accompany us on our itinerary that takes us to the school camp 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.470
 located 1200 meters 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.340
 course at the liaison state 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.030
 we can learn the first behavioral rules that allow us to 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.510
 transit in physics 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:49.530
 itaco been on the roadway 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.530
 without hindrance to circulation 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:20.590
 Once at the school camp, the under selection will be carried out dividing the participants 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:21.279

 second level mosÃ¨ minutes athletic preparation and hold 

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:30.909
 many of these changes are already in place in various Italian regions 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:35.129
 such as. for practice and departure for specific tracks for mountain bikes 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:40.519
 the various skill tests included in the course studied by the mayor 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:45.040
 they allow to bring back in a small space all the features that we will find again 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.119

00:03:24.169 --> 00:03:28.309
 now we are ready to approach the different zones selected for 

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:31.309
 learning the specific technique 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:47.029
 let's see what the most suitable techniques are 

00:03:47.029 --> 00:03:48.819
 to ride in the plains 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:52.449
 the behavioral rules for correct use from the sforno montanbike 

00:03:52.999 --> 00:03:57.349

 earth you can 77 idaten as a few sentences the backpack to carry objects of

 spare in how many land 

00:04:05.619 --> 00:04:08.619
 protect hands and to hold terabithia 

00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:13.969
 on the provincial roads you must always go in single file behind the other 

00:04:13.969 --> 00:04:16.390
 it seems it would have been above all 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:17.380
 where do you do 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:18.799
 in the woods 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:22.300
 you must always follow the marked paths that make and forest 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:27.110
 must respect the animals look for it contracted life turin knows me give the 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:28.740
 priority 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.370
 and above all if you want in nature and respect it 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.370
 we must not leave waste for any reason 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:40.259
 the first outings in montanbike would be wise performed in the plains 

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:43.680
 i pedaling over not very challenging terrain 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.960
 to become familiar with the weather 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.300
 first of all it is advisable to take care of the foot support of the fetal shoe 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:56.150
 it is the so-called round pedal that allows the push and pull 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.270
 of complacency ignore the ways 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.749
 without waste of mechanical energy 

00:05:01.749 --> 00:05:05.969
 the pedaling must be uniformly prolonged linear 

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:09.279
 without tearing and with the foot always parallel to the ground 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:12.139
 soft arms on the handlebar 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:15.139
 with two fingers always above the lines of the file 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.840
 it is important to proceed using the muscles that are indispensable for movement 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.689
 i keep the other contracts 

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:27.009
 so that the body can softly support itself 

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:28.279
 bike times 

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:30.509
 which will almost result 

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:33.759
 from our travels 

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:36.599
 you have to train yourself to change correctly 

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:40.240
 to acquire the practice and identify very quickly 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.689
 what is the right ratio in relation to the slope 

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:45.400
 to the psychophysical state 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.400
 and at individual athletic preparation level 

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:53.050
 the technical routes as continuous curved ups and downs 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:57.490
 they represent a test bench for the gearbox and all the mechanisms now 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:59.180
 accompanied 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:00.550
 the recommendation 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:03.309
 is to never change under strain 

00:06:03.309 --> 00:06:07.909
 trying to work very early on gradual scaling relationships 

00:06:10.569 --> 00:06:14.330
 the transition from a more sustained pace to a slower one 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:18.349
 3 surely asks for the intervention of an escalated photo report 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:22.809
 it is however advisable to lose a few moments during the deceleration phase 

00:06:23.789 --> 00:06:28.529
 rather than resuming the ride with the malpositioning chain the pinion 

00:06:28.529 --> 00:06:33.759
 the curves must be able to evaluate a series of variables as per 

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:38.289
 example the travel speed the trajectory the inclination of the 

00:06:38.289 --> 00:06:41.240
 mountanbike &amp; b fund conditions 

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.749
 therefore in the presence of a tight curve 

00:06:43.749 --> 00:06:48.199
 it is advisable to carry out the gearshift already in the setting phase of the 

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:48.990
 itself 

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:51.990
 when the maple town by the main position for dogs 

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:56.430
 ebay indicating the use of relatively agility relationships 

00:06:56.430 --> 00:07:01.030
 with which to make quick trips and never stop pedaling for non 

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:04.030
 lose stability and grip with anyone 

00:07:05.599 --> 00:07:10.409
 there are different ways of changing. depending on the situation you are in 

00:07:10.409 --> 00:07:11.659
 find to operate 

00:07:11.659 --> 00:07:17.139
 ascent downhill under braking buttered under effort webmail teletu 

00:07:18.349 --> 00:07:22.989
 in this context we will analyze the main situations very simply
