00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:11.350
Hey, everybody.

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:12.530
This is Todrick Hall.

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:13.930
Thank you so much
for coming back.

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:18.210
This week's episode has got to
be one of the best episodes of

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.480
Dance Moms ever, of all time,
that I've ever seen.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.490
First of all, at the beginning
of the episode, Abby Lee

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:27.620
announces to the girls that
they are going to Ohio.

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.410
Do you know what that
means when you go to

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:31.440
Ohio on Dance Moms?

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.970
That means that somewhere in
that state, somewhere in that

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.770
episode, there's going
to be Cathy Lee.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.905
And when there is a Cathy
Lee, come on somebody.

00:00:39.905 --> 00:00:40.220
[SINGING]

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.160
There's gonna be some drama.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.200
There's gonna be laughs.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.940
Cause Cathy Lee's a little
cuckoo, and she

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.740
likes to show her a--

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:52.030
Cathy is crazy.

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.730
She is my favorite character
on Dance Moms, hands down.

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.090
So Abby Lee decides to
be really witty.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.400
And all of her routines that she
takes to competition all

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.550
have an apple theme to them,
which is just kind of like a

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.030
thing to say, twist the knife.

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.349
[SINGING]

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:09.185
La, la, la, la, nanny,
nanny, boo, boo.

00:01:09.185 --> 00:01:13.910
We're with Cathy Lee, and
we are gonna beat you.

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:14.940
So we move on.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.490
We get to the competition.

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.230
Abby Lee's kids come out and
they do their apple number.

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:20.090
Of course, they did great.

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.570
And then Cathy Lee's people
take the stage.

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.650
Cathy Lee came to win
this competition.

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.620
Her girls came out there and
were giving you conquistador

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.780
stuff and ai, ai, ai!

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.460
I personally think that
they should have won.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.650
Abby Lee's kids won
the competition.

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.000
Not only did Cathy lose the
competition, but one of her

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.710
other dancers got disqualified
because she entered a girl

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.180
that was about to be in college
or something in a

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.960
competition that's supposed to
be for 8 and 9-year-olds or

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.120
10-year-old.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.450
I don't even remember what
the age limit was.

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.350
But this girl was out
of the age limit.

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.320
That's all I have to say
about Dance Moms.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.860
It was great.

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.810
I can't wait to see next
week's episode.

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:57.390
Peace out.

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.100
This is Todrick Hall
saying, [SINGING]

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.440
you're watching FYI.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:05.590
Peace.
