hey it's Oscar from the coding universe

00:00:02.919 --> 00:00:06.330 
hey it's Oscar from the coding universe
here<00:00:03.220> and<00:00:04.019> this<00:00:05.019> is<00:00:05.319> the<00:00:05.559> second<00:00:05.920> episode<00:00:06.309> of

in this series we're going to take a

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.150 
in this series we're going to take a
look<00:00:11.469> at<00:00:11.620> the<00:00:11.769> display<00:00:12.040> class<00:00:12.870> so<00:00:13.870> let's<00:00:14.620> head

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:15.160 
look at the display class so let's head

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.730 
look at the display class so let's head
over<00:00:15.190> to<00:00:15.490> eclipse<00:00:15.700> and<00:00:16.349> create<00:00:17.349> a<00:00:17.380> new<00:00:17.529> class

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:17.740 
over to eclipse and create a new class

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:23.310 
over to eclipse and create a new class
and<00:00:19.380> call<00:00:20.380> it<00:00:21.449> lightweight<00:00:22.449> Java<00:00:22.869> gave<00:00:23.109> my

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:11.850 

so<00:01:10.040> now<00:01:10.189> we<00:01:10.280> go<00:01:10.430> to<00:01:10.640> the<00:01:10.909> main<00:01:11.090> method<00:01:11.299> and

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
so now we go to the main method and

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.550 
so now we go to the main method and
we're<00:01:12.860> going<00:01:13.100> to<00:01:13.189> instantiate<00:01:13.610> a<00:01:13.909> new

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
we're going to instantiate a new

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:23.289 
we're going to instantiate a new
instance<00:01:15.560> of<00:01:15.829> this<00:01:16.189> class<00:01:21.939> so<00:01:22.939> we're<00:01:23.090> going<00:01:23.210> to

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:23.299 
instance of this class so we're going to

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:32.980 
instance of this class so we're going to
create<00:01:23.450> that<00:01:23.600> constructor<00:01:28.569> and<00:01:31.810> we're<00:01:32.810> going

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
create that constructor and we're going

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.800 
create that constructor and we're going
to<00:01:33.140> create<00:01:33.319> a<00:01:33.380> try<00:01:33.770> loop<00:01:34.119> then<00:01:35.119> that<00:01:35.299> try<00:01:35.569> loop

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
to create a try loop then that try loop

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.800 
to create a try loop then that try loop
we're<00:01:36.020> going<00:01:36.049> to<00:01:36.350> set<00:01:36.619> the<00:01:36.890> display<00:01:37.450> so<00:01:38.450> invoke

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
we're going to set the display so invoke

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.870 
we're going to set the display so invoke
the<00:01:39.020> display<00:01:39.380> class<00:01:39.619> and<00:01:39.920> use<00:01:40.220> the<00:01:40.250> static

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
the display class and use the static

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.929 
the display class and use the static
method<00:01:41.060> set<00:01:42.049> display<00:01:42.530> mode<00:01:42.830> create<00:01:43.759> a<00:01:43.819> new

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:43.939 
method set display mode create a new

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:48.370 
method set display mode create a new
display<00:01:44.270> mode<00:01:45.849> which<00:01:46.849> takes<00:01:47.299> two<00:01:47.780> parameters

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
display mode which takes two parameters

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.699 
display mode which takes two parameters
you<00:01:49.369> width<00:01:49.580> from<00:01:49.700> the<00:01:49.789> height<00:01:50.409> so<00:01:51.409> I'm<00:01:51.500> going

00:01:51.699 --> 00:01:51.709 
you width from the height so I'm going

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:56.639 
you width from the height so I'm going
to<00:01:51.830> specify<00:01:52.640> is<00:01:52.970> 640<00:01:53.959> pixels<00:01:54.380> as<00:01:54.530> width<00:01:54.890> and

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:56.649 
to specify is 640 pixels as width and

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:02.710 
to specify is 640 pixels as width and
480<00:01:57.649> as<00:01:57.979> height<00:02:00.220> I'm<00:02:01.220> also<00:02:01.490> going<00:02:01.789> to<00:02:01.909> set<00:02:02.240> the

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
480 as height I'm also going to set the

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:08.979 
480 as height I'm also going to set the
title<00:02:04.179> to<00:02:05.179> hello<00:02:07.479> language<00:02:08.479> are<00:02:08.690> the<00:02:08.810> game

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
title to hello language are the game

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:13.720 
title to hello language are the game
library<00:02:09.940> and<00:02:10.940> I'm<00:02:11.599> going<00:02:11.780> to<00:02:11.900> create<00:02:12.730> the

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
library and I'm going to create the

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.130 
library and I'm going to create the
display<00:02:15.819> so<00:02:16.819> let's<00:02:17.000> catch<00:02:17.359> that<00:02:17.390> lightweight

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
display so let's catch that lightweight

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.170 
display so let's catch that lightweight
java<00:02:18.620> game<00:02:18.890> my<00:02:19.069> very<00:02:19.340> exception<00:02:20.090> and<00:02:22.180> just

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
java game my very exception and just

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.360 
java game my very exception and just
print<00:02:23.540> the<00:02:23.690> stack<00:02:23.900> trace<00:02:26.650> so<00:02:27.650> this<00:02:27.950> is<00:02:28.190> where

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
print the stack trace so this is where

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.150 
print the stack trace so this is where
we<00:02:28.459> would<00:02:28.609> actually<00:02:28.819> put<00:02:29.150> our<00:02:30.160> initialization

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
we would actually put our initialization

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:38.890 
we would actually put our initialization
code<00:02:34.269> for<00:02:35.269> our<00:02:35.299> opengl<00:02:36.170> stuff<00:02:37.690> but<00:02:38.690> since

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
code for our opengl stuff but since

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.599 
code for our opengl stuff but since
we're<00:02:39.049> not<00:02:39.079> going<00:02:39.319> to<00:02:39.410> do<00:02:39.560> any<00:02:39.739> with<00:02:39.980> anything

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:40.609 
we're not going to do any with anything

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:44.620 
we're not going to do any with anything

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
with opengl in this tutorial i'm not

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.220 
with opengl in this tutorial i'm not
going<00:02:44.810> to<00:02:44.930> bother<00:02:45.079> you<00:02:45.410> with<00:02:45.829> that<00:02:47.079> let's<00:02:48.079> get

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
going to bother you with that let's get

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.420 
going to bother you with that let's get
