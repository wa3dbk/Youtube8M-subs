in classrooms to teach ensembles and
also<00:00:27.000> to<00:00:27.060> see<00:00:27.780> something<00:00:28.050> yeah

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:39.909 

00:00:39.909 --> 00:00:42.849 

what<00:00:40.909> the<00:00:41.000> curriculum<00:00:41.210> supports<00:00:42.019> because

00:00:42.849 --> 00:00:42.859 
what the curriculum supports because

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:44.079 
what the curriculum supports because
he's<00:00:43.100> got<00:00:43.249> all<00:00:43.370> these<00:00:43.519> combined<00:00:43.909> elements

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:44.089 
he's got all these combined elements

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:46.119 
he's got all these combined elements
where<00:00:44.539> students<00:00:44.989> are<00:00:45.049> bundle<00:00:45.409> them<00:00:45.559> together

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129 
where students are bundle them together

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:47.829 
where students are bundle them together
and<00:00:46.429> I<00:00:46.549> think<00:00:46.609> that's<00:00:46.909> what's<00:00:47.179> different<00:00:47.420> you

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:50.079 
and I think that's what's different you
know<00:00:47.960> it<00:00:48.409> is<00:00:48.859> about<00:00:49.100> the<00:00:49.219> hard<00:00:49.429> core<00:00:49.729> it<00:00:50.000> is

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:50.089 
know it is about the hard core it is
