I<00:01:25.290> realized<00:01:25.830> that<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.670> get<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.030> desired<00:01:27.420> width

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630

of the stand these pieces are too short

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.600 
of the stand these pieces are too short
moving<00:01:30.510> two<00:01:30.690> together<00:01:30.869> would<00:01:31.260> work<00:01:31.470> so<00:01:32.400> I<00:01:32.430> use

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
moving two together would work so I use

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.670 
moving two together would work so I use

then it looked to be I clue two of these

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.950 
then it looked to be I clue two of these
pieces<00:01:44.460> together<00:01:44.760> and<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.450> prevent<00:01:45.780> the

them in place using my trusty water
container<00:02:28.730> is<00:02:28.909> a<00:02:28.939> crude<00:02:29.239> clamping<00:02:29.689> device

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
container is a crude clamping device

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.699 
container is a crude clamping device
until<00:02:30.500> I<00:02:30.620> have<00:02:30.739> the<00:02:30.890> first<00:02:31.099> floor<00:02:31.459> done<00:02:32.709> and

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
until I have the first floor done and

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.069 
until I have the first floor done and
then<00:02:33.980> use<00:02:34.159> that<00:02:34.189> to<00:02:34.760> make<00:02:35.000> the<00:02:35.269> second<00:02:35.659> one<00:02:35.870> a

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:36.079 
then use that to make the second one a

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:40.569 
then use that to make the second one a
little<00:02:36.829> less<00:02:37.040> deep<00:02:39.010> here<00:02:40.010> I<00:02:40.040> use<00:02:40.280> what<00:02:40.549> I

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:40.579 
little less deep here I use what I

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:42.429 
little less deep here I use what I
thought<00:02:40.879> were<00:02:41.090> cut<00:02:41.329> offs<00:02:41.510> because<00:02:41.989> I<00:02:42.019> found

00:02:42.429 --> 00:02:42.439 
thought were cut offs because I found

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:46.509 
thought were cut offs because I found
that<00:02:43.040> I<00:02:43.099> did<00:02:43.310> not<00:02:43.459> have<00:02:43.639> enough<00:02:43.670> slits<00:02:44.180> to<00:02:45.519> draw

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 
that I did not have enough slits to draw

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:48.789 
that I did not have enough slits to draw
up<00:02:46.609> the<00:02:46.790> edges<00:02:47.209> I<00:02:47.510> use<00:02:47.750> the<00:02:47.989> table<00:02:48.349> saw<00:02:48.379> again

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:48.799 
up the edges I use the table saw again

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:50.830 
up the edges I use the table saw again
with<00:02:49.370> a<00:02:49.489> piece<00:02:49.669> of<00:02:49.700> wood<00:02:50.030> between<00:02:50.209> fans<00:02:50.689> and

long piece to offset the untrue ends of
the<00:02:53.480> short<00:02:53.720> pieces<00:02:54.430> then<00:02:55.430> I<00:02:55.459> add<00:02:55.730> the<00:02:55.909> vertical

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
the short pieces then I add the vertical

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.550 
the short pieces then I add the vertical
strips<00:02:56.750> and<00:02:58.150> use<00:02:59.150> one<00:02:59.389> of<00:02:59.419> sec<00:02:59.750> Higgins<00:03:00.230> cool

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560

cast pen turning planks as a spacer it

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:05.530 
cast pen turning planks as a spacer it
really<00:03:04.099> does<00:03:04.220> a<00:03:04.250> great<00:03:04.579> shop<00:03:04.849> and<00:03:05.120> I<00:03:05.239> can't

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
really does a great shop and I can't

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.720 
really does a great shop and I can't
imagine<00:03:05.689> how<00:03:06.260> much<00:03:06.439> better<00:03:06.680> it<00:03:06.980> will<00:03:07.099> do<00:03:07.280> once

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
imagine how much better it will do once

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.170 
imagine how much better it will do once
I<00:03:07.939> start<00:03:08.209> turning<00:03:08.389> it<00:03:09.519> once<00:03:10.519> the<00:03:10.730> upper<00:03:10.970> tray

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
I start turning it once the upper tray

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.839 
I start turning it once the upper tray
is<00:03:11.239> in<00:03:11.329> place<00:03:11.659> I<00:03:12.019> realize<00:03:12.620> that<00:03:12.950> it<00:03:13.310> already<00:03:13.519> is

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:13.849 
is in place I realize that it already is

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:16.330 
is in place I realize that it already is
pretty<00:03:14.060> strong<00:03:14.480> so<00:03:15.349> instead<00:03:15.680> of<00:03:15.739> adding<00:03:16.040> two

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
pretty strong so instead of adding two

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.699 
pretty strong so instead of adding two
more<00:03:16.519> vertical<00:03:17.000> support<00:03:17.359> pieces<00:03:17.810> I<00:03:17.989> decide<00:03:18.680> to

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
more vertical support pieces I decide to

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:25.050 
more vertical support pieces I decide to
go<00:03:19.010> for<00:03:19.040> angled<00:03:19.669> supports<00:03:20.150> for<00:03:20.389> added<00:03:20.690> style

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.000 

so<00:03:26.060> let's<00:03:26.269> try<00:03:26.540> the<00:03:26.599> new<00:03:26.840> fruit<00:03:27.079> holder<00:03:27.500> have

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
so let's try the new fruit holder have

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:43.800 
so let's try the new fruit holder have
sensed<00:03:28.370> the<00:03:28.519> change<00:03:29.079> here<00:03:30.079> they<00:03:30.260> come
