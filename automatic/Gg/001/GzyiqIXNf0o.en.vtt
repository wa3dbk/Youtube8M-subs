00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
hey guys i rly neil actor i just want to

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.510 
hey guys i rly neil actor i just want to
show<00:00:03.929> you<00:00:04.020> one<00:00:04.140> of<00:00:04.170> our<00:00:04.350> generator<00:00:05.009> insults<00:00:05.430> we

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
show you one of our generator insults we

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.030 
show you one of our generator insults we
just<00:00:05.700> got<00:00:05.850> done<00:00:06.029> today<00:00:06.259> this<00:00:07.259> is<00:00:07.379> a<00:00:07.440> 20<00:00:07.799> kW

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
just got done today this is a 20 kW

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.390 
just got done today this is a 20 kW
Generac<00:00:08.910> generator<00:00:09.389> and<00:00:10.010> it's<00:00:11.010> a<00:00:11.070> whole<00:00:11.219> house

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
Generac generator and it's a whole house

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.009 
Generac generator and it's a whole house
system<00:00:11.910> so<00:00:12.120> it's<00:00:12.330> a<00:00:12.360> little<00:00:12.540> different<00:00:12.690> from<00:00:12.870> a

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
system so it's a little different from a

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.049 
system so it's a little different from a
portable<00:00:13.349> one<00:00:13.620> this<00:00:14.099> one<00:00:14.340> actually<00:00:14.490> starts

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
portable one this one actually starts

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.960 
portable one this one actually starts
itself<00:00:15.450> up<00:00:15.859> if<00:00:16.859> there's<00:00:17.130> a<00:00:17.190> power<00:00:17.400> outage<00:00:17.520> so

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
itself up if there's a power outage so

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.630 
itself up if there's a power outage so
you<00:00:18.029> don't<00:00:18.270> have<00:00:18.390> to<00:00:18.510> plug<00:00:18.660> in<00:00:18.840> any<00:00:18.990> cords

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:19.640 
you don't have to plug in any cords

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.830 
you don't have to plug in any cords
worried<00:00:20.640> about<00:00:20.789> any<00:00:20.970> gasoline<00:00:21.390> or<00:00:21.689> anything

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
worried about any gasoline or anything

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.160 
worried about any gasoline or anything
like<00:00:22.050> that<00:00:22.080> it<00:00:22.470> runs<00:00:22.710> off<00:00:22.920> of<00:00:23.130> natural<00:00:23.490> gas<00:00:23.640> and

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:24.170 
like that it runs off of natural gas and

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.420 
like that it runs off of natural gas and
here's<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.289> gas<00:00:25.500> line<00:00:25.769> we<00:00:25.920> have<00:00:26.039> in<00:00:26.250> right

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
here's the gas line we have in right

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.370 
here's the gas line we have in right
here<00:00:26.609> and<00:00:28.609> again<00:00:29.609> it's<00:00:29.910> 20<00:00:30.210> kW<00:00:30.420> so<00:00:30.960> puts<00:00:31.230> out

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
here and again it's 20 kW so puts out

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.549 
here and again it's 20 kW so puts out
about<00:00:31.560> eighty<00:00:31.769> three<00:00:32.099> amps<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:33.380> we've<00:00:34.380> got<00:00:34.530> a

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
about eighty three amps and we've got a

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.040 
about eighty three amps and we've got a
couple<00:00:34.739> nice<00:00:35.040> features<00:00:35.460> here<00:00:35.670> on<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.690> side<00:00:36.899> of

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
couple nice features here on the side of

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.540 
couple nice features here on the side of
the<00:00:37.110> door<00:00:37.320> here<00:00:37.590> you<00:00:37.770> have<00:00:37.950> a<00:00:37.980> hundred<00:00:38.399> amp

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
the door here you have a hundred amp

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:39.950 
the door here you have a hundred amp
disconnect<00:00:39.059> for<00:00:39.149> your<00:00:39.300> power<00:00:39.450> coming<00:00:39.690> off<00:00:39.870> the

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
disconnect for your power coming off the

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.110 
disconnect for your power coming off the
generator<00:00:40.379> and<00:00:40.710> you<00:00:41.129> have<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:41.309> little<00:00:41.489> 15<00:00:41.879> amp

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
generator and you have a little 15 amp

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.080 
generator and you have a little 15 amp
that's<00:00:42.750> for<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.079> GFI<00:00:43.730> so<00:00:44.730> you<00:00:44.789> can<00:00:44.910> plug

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
that's for a GFI so you can plug

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.459 
that's for a GFI so you can plug
something<00:00:45.360> in<00:00:45.600> out<00:00:45.750> on<00:00:45.899> this<00:00:46.020> side<00:00:46.260> of<00:00:46.379> the

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
something in out on this side of the

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:47.930 
something in out on this side of the
house<00:00:46.620> outside<00:00:47.129> if<00:00:47.340> you<00:00:47.460> have<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.579> power<00:00:47.789> outage

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
house outside if you have a power outage

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.119 
house outside if you have a power outage
which<00:00:48.270> is<00:00:48.420> really<00:00:48.629> nice<00:00:48.809> it<00:00:49.110> has<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.590> lockable

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
which is really nice it has a lockable

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.410 
which is really nice it has a lockable
hood<00:00:50.340> there's<00:00:50.700> another<00:00:50.940> lock<00:00:51.120> on<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.360> other

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
hood there's another lock on the other

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.540 
hood there's another lock on the other
side<00:00:51.600> of<00:00:51.930> this<00:00:52.050> so<00:00:52.770> it<00:00:52.920> can<00:00:53.039> keep<00:00:53.190> lock<00:00:53.399> from

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
side of this so it can keep lock from

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.389 
side of this so it can keep lock from
the<00:00:53.670> kids<00:00:53.879> getting<00:00:54.120> into<00:00:54.300> it<00:00:54.449> and<00:00:55.399> underneath

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
the kids getting into it and underneath

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.599 
the kids getting into it and underneath
the<00:00:56.550> hood<00:00:56.670> here<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:57.199> couple<00:00:58.199> things<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:59.280> notice

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
the hood here a couple things to notice

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.639 
the hood here a couple things to notice
one<00:01:00.000> is<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.210> generator<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:01.079> generator<00:01:01.109> down

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
one is the generator the generator down

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.950 
one is the generator the generator down
in<00:01:01.800> there<00:01:01.949> which<00:01:02.190> is<00:01:02.370> hot<00:01:02.719> underneath<00:01:03.719> there

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
in there which is hot underneath there

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.450 
in there which is hot underneath there
it<00:01:04.080> is<00:01:04.670> this<00:01:05.670> is<00:01:05.729> an<00:01:05.850> OHA<00:01:06.350> motor<00:01:07.350> it's<00:01:08.100> made<00:01:08.310> by

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
it is this is an OHA motor it's made by

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.610 
it is this is an OHA motor it's made by
Generac

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:12.620 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.750 

okay<00:01:13.400> and<00:01:13.820> it<00:01:13.940> does<00:01:14.060> take<00:01:14.270> oil<00:01:15.490> so<00:01:16.490> it<00:01:16.610> does

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:16.760 
okay and it does take oil so it does

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.490 
okay and it does take oil so it does
need<00:01:16.910> servicing<00:01:17.360> once<00:01:17.540> a<00:01:17.660> year<00:01:17.840> it<00:01:18.110> has<00:01:18.140> an<00:01:18.380> air

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
need servicing once a year it has an air

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.310 
need servicing once a year it has an air
filter<00:01:18.680> in<00:01:19.010> it<00:01:19.130> and<00:01:19.280> oil<00:01:20.050> things<00:01:21.050> of<00:01:21.200> that

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
filter in it and oil things of that

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.170 
filter in it and oil things of that
nature<00:01:21.380> to<00:01:21.680> look<00:01:21.950> into<00:01:22.310> and<00:01:22.610> it<00:01:23.000> has<00:01:23.150> a

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
nature to look into and it has a

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.510 
nature to look into and it has a
programmer<00:01:23.720> what<00:01:24.530> this<00:01:24.680> program<00:01:25.070> does<00:01:25.100> is

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
programmer what this program does is

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.670 
programmer what this program does is
that<00:01:25.640> you<00:01:26.060> program<00:01:26.300> this<00:01:26.660> to<00:01:26.870> exercise<00:01:27.530> the

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
that you program this to exercise the

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.310 
that you program this to exercise the
generator<00:01:28.130> meaning<00:01:28.430> we'll<00:01:28.520> start<00:01:28.880> I<00:01:29.200> have<00:01:30.200> it

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
generator meaning we'll start I have it

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.160 
generator meaning we'll start I have it
set<00:01:30.530> for<00:01:30.560> once<00:01:31.070> a<00:01:31.190> week<00:01:31.390> to<00:01:32.390> clock<00:01:32.630> on<00:01:32.780> Monday

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
set for once a week to clock on Monday

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.620 
set for once a week to clock on Monday
and<00:01:33.380> we'll<00:01:33.920> start<00:01:34.220> once<00:01:34.430> a<00:01:34.520> week<00:01:34.700> and<00:01:35.210> what<00:01:35.540> it

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
and we'll start once a week and what it

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.480 
and we'll start once a week and what it
does<00:01:35.750> is<00:01:35.930> it<00:01:36.050> just<00:01:36.200> keeps<00:01:36.830> new<00:01:37.010> oil<00:01:37.220> flowing

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
does is it just keeps new oil flowing

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.760 
does is it just keeps new oil flowing
keeps<00:01:37.910> itself<00:01:38.180> working<00:01:38.690> real<00:01:38.900> well

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
keeps itself working real well

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.200 
keeps itself working real well
you<00:01:40.100> know<00:01:40.190> it's<00:01:40.310> like<00:01:40.400> a<00:01:40.460> car<00:01:40.760> if<00:01:40.880> you<00:01:40.940> leave<00:01:41.120> it

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
you know it's like a car if you leave it

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:42.520 
you know it's like a car if you leave it
sit<00:01:41.360> for<00:01:41.390> a<00:01:41.540> long<00:01:41.660> time<00:01:41.900> things<00:01:42.200> to<00:01:42.320> start

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
sit for a long time things to start

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.290 
sit for a long time things to start
breaking<00:01:42.740> it<00:01:42.890> down<00:01:43.040> so<00:01:43.340> these<00:01:43.850> things<00:01:44.090> need<00:01:44.210> to

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:44.300 
breaking it down so these things need to

why we ran a comet like we did on the
window<00:03:35.900> and<00:03:36.680> said<00:03:36.860> you<00:03:36.950> can<00:03:37.100> open<00:03:37.310> the<00:03:37.370> window

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
window and said you can open the window

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:38.770 
window and said you can open the window
we<00:03:37.730> were<00:03:37.850> actually<00:03:38.120> going<00:03:38.240> to<00:03:38.300> take<00:03:38.420> a<00:03:38.480> pane<00:03:38.750> of

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
we were actually going to take a pane of

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.440 
we were actually going to take a pane of
glass<00:03:38.900> out<00:03:39.640> but<00:03:40.640> that<00:03:40.790> wouldn't<00:03:40.970> work<00:03:41.060> out<00:03:41.270> too

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
glass out but that wouldn't work out too

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.470 
glass out but that wouldn't work out too
good<00:03:41.480> because<00:03:42.050> the<00:03:42.290> gas<00:03:42.500> guys<00:03:42.800> and<00:03:43.250> me<00:03:43.490> were

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
good because the gas guys and me were

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.080 
good because the gas guys and me were
working<00:03:44.630> different<00:03:45.080> times<00:03:45.260> so<00:03:46.000> whoever<00:03:47.000> was

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
working different times so whoever was

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:48.400 
working different times so whoever was
thrown<00:03:47.270> first<00:03:47.540> would<00:03:47.750> have<00:03:47.870> to<00:03:47.960> closed<00:03:48.170> off

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
thrown first would have to closed off

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:49.510 
thrown first would have to closed off
and<00:03:48.590> one<00:03:48.710> was<00:03:48.830> couldn't<00:03:49.040> get<00:03:49.190> back<00:03:49.310> in<00:03:49.370> that

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:49.520 
and one was couldn't get back in that

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:50.860 
and one was couldn't get back in that
little<00:03:49.670> window<00:03:49.940> while<00:03:50.300> you<00:03:50.390> snapped<00:03:50.660> and<00:03:50.810> we

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
little window while you snapped and we

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:51.970 
little window while you snapped and we
had<00:03:50.990> to<00:03:51.080> actually<00:03:51.170> get<00:03:51.440> out<00:03:51.560> there<00:03:51.770> and<00:03:51.860> run

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
had to actually get out there and run

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.710 
had to actually get out there and run
the<00:03:52.010> pipe<00:03:52.250> as<00:03:52.400> well<00:03:52.430> sneak<00:03:53.360> it<00:03:53.480> up<00:03:53.570> through

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
the pipe as well sneak it up through

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.950 
the pipe as well sneak it up through
that<00:03:53.750> grate<00:03:54.110> up<00:03:54.350> there<00:03:55.330> so<00:03:56.330> he<00:03:56.510> did<00:03:56.690> the<00:03:56.780> same

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:56.960 
that grate up there so he did the same

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:00.550 
that grate up there so he did the same
thing<00:03:57.140> on<00:03:57.170> his<00:03:57.440> side<00:03:57.650> and<00:03:59.020> now<00:04:00.020> the<00:04:00.080> window<00:04:00.380> can

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
thing on his side and now the window can

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.050 
thing on his side and now the window can
be<00:04:00.590> open<00:04:00.980> if<00:04:01.130> we<00:04:01.250> have<00:04:01.400> to<00:04:01.490> get<00:04:01.610> in<00:04:01.730> there<00:04:01.880> for

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
be open if we have to get in there for

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.550 
be open if we have to get in there for
any<00:04:02.210> reason<00:04:02.240> here's<00:04:03.170> the<00:04:03.290> gas<00:04:03.440> line<00:04:03.680> here<00:04:04.360> and

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
any reason here's the gas line here and

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.650 
any reason here's the gas line here and
it's<00:04:06.560> tapped<00:04:06.800> off<00:04:07.010> right<00:04:08.000> close<00:04:08.240> to<00:04:08.270> the<00:04:08.480> main
