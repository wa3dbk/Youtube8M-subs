00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:09.990
 Tell me, folks, do you think this is for you? 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.700
 has already been commented on, but 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.950
 they saw the title today is day of myths 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.120
 mw3 of the sixth episode tempted me 3 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.680
 we are lifting with the series 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.320
 channel after this 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.330
 troubled and full of news 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.340
 about which of the two rumors is not 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.869
 training training coming out and now I'm going 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.730
 then take a look back now that it gave a 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.960
 calmed in the news and such but of course 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.060
 that whenever relevant news comes out 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.710
 and interesting, I'll bring it to 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.170
 You here on bancoop 2 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.670
 but then today admiring 30 you like 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.620
 enough were asking already tasted in the 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.540
 channel all 3,000 today have been 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.620
 moments that have been much 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.750
 episodes is that you leave a comment 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.399
 and the comment is quite young then 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.430
 select three of those comments there 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.840
 so if you have a myth and comment 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.850
 down here for me to train too 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.050
 appear in future episodes and come on 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.050
 then for the 3 thousand episodes 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.870
 and as you can see, it is not possible 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.630
 Kill six opponents at once with 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.740
 just a shot of snape is that test I 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.150
 I did it with the people who follow me at 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.040
 twitter put there that I needed 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.479
 six volunteers in the middle of the area in the myth 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.450
 and then the top six and get 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.310
 enter participated then we tested 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.860
 several times we have the impact 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.150
 with robes on pecs rolled bridges all 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.220
 sometimes the most we got 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.660
 it was 3 kills had it once I moved it 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.340
 opera people thought it had been 4 in the 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.600
 truth was 13 there were even three in the 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.460
 first and three in the second as I shot 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.690
 very fast it appeared very useful but in the 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.250
 It was only three 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.840
 then the maximum you can kill more 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.770
 at the time at least one test that did in 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.149
 shock or not 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.750
 There are three of us, we are going to 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.750
 next video 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.220
 and's there this is an obvious myth but through 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.860
 I'm very much asked for who does not know 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.720
 software function to delay the explosion 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.310
 the activation of enemy equipment 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.500
 so they could see that he did not 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.910
 works with trump anderson for 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.910
 last myth of this episode 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.120
 because it is incredible that it seems like 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.640
 you could check the ranking with 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.709
 jonny does not die for an explosion of 10 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.600
 - income is the most surprising ever 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:25.640
 that you owe less income and kills people there 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.900
 a very considerable distance to the burning 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.180
 clothing and do not get the triumph and 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.500
 control but the code is accustomed 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.000
 With that, I hope you have 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.739
 I liked the most this episode me 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.390
 retired three as I said go 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:37.370
 comment below leaving much futures 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.050
 What would you like to see here in the name? 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.700
 mw 3 if they do not appear in the 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:41.750
 next episode may appear in other 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.120
 because as I said in other episodes 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.800
 I recording the best videos here guys 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.750

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.250
 which favorite is your type of video gives 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.959
 enough work to record and edit 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.350
 You already know all this so this is it. 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:56.000
