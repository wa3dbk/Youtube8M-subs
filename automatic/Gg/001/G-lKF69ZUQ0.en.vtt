00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:11.370
 awesome because really 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:15.450
 what a headache is happening 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.520
 when you start to look like 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.730
 familiar things completely different 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.100
 eyes you look around and see 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.560
 completely different things seen before 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:29.179
 of how i came here and this 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:32.640
 really amazing that is it 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:37.190
 discovery and yourself and the world what is it 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.190
 really totally different like 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.910
 Well, how can you explain you always 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.890
 walked in your arms and it seemed to you that you 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.649
 walk right there once got to your feet 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.010
 and it turns out for life and 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.899
 walked like something wrong yes 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:57.659
 really that's it that's probably by 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:00.360
 it is not difficult to explain to another 

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:02.870
 but differently, that is, since it is not 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.870
 was before 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:14.000
 emotion 1 absolute and happiness because 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:18.110
 that we relaxed we rested we 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:23.300
 received a charge a huge charge of emotions 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:25.370
 and impressions sea and but it 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:29.630
 really this is awesome because 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:32.450
 that in our life you can give people everything 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:35.690
 anything yes but very complicated 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.400
 give people emotions impressions what 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.500
 here they will remember this is something not 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.600
 really felt 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:47.320
 and it will always be remembered here on 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:47.320
 lifelong family like yourself 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.720
 I came here with my family 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:57.979
 I was trained and also with us 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:00.260
 were our see two daughters enter and 14 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:05.240
 years of course they did not participate in the very 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:08.300
 training but they are some of our forays 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:11.470
 they were there too and now 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:14.530
 I feel that our family has become even 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:17.980
 stronger still really better 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:20.959
 mutual understanding for example now feel 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:23.269
 more unity with their children because 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:25.790
 that in the beginning of the training is not terrible that 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:28.010
 what are you doing there but i can't 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.319
 understand in the morning already leave in the evening 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.209
 Well what happens when they 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:37.310
 us went here a couple of times a couple 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:39.769
 There are such stunning sorties because 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.600
 I do not even know how to characterize because 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:44.120
 what is this this is not lez course this is not 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:47.060
 event this here is some sort of foray into 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:50.150
 completely different world today when we 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:52.850
 stood under this waterfall so I saw 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.560
 absolute happiness on their faces and they 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.970
 spoke class that we have such 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.970
 parents are awesome 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:08.129
 I think that a person should want 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.689
 exactly to attend this training if 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:12.719
 something does not suit him in this life 

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:15.389
 if he think about some things about 

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:17.010
 meaning of life and he does not find them answers 

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:18.299
 only or his present life is not 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.389
 satisfied he has some problems 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:23.280
 but he himself cannot sew it 

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:25.620
 people, I definitely would recommend 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.040
 really visitor training because 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:31.370
 that it allows in another way just 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.370
 look at your life 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:41.560
 but it is certainly the most important discovery 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:44.470
 yesterday and this sage who once 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:48.100
 put you know how you put the main 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:50.710
 the accents are likely this training but his 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.780
 the words they fell exactly prepared 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:54.370
 fertile soil because 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.930
 if we met him the first day 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:59.110
 my training is absolutely nothing 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:01.660
 understood and five days after 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.790
 we worked ourselves we thought about ourselves about 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:08.080
 your life and here are the words of this 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:10.300
 sage they like accents the 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:13.440
 what did we do throughout this 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:16.270
 training bear 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:19.450
 I want an idea very much 

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:21.910
 and I really think that unfortunately 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:26.040
 I must get on earlier to leave 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:30.250
 than but everyone is leaving here but I'm going to 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:32.050
 work with i'm going now for a big 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:35.020
 conference which is really me 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:37.210
 I think that there is a rest and 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.610
 really plucking some 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.890
 absolutely other emotions I have 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:46.270
 even more some creative ideas and 

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:48.460
 plans and indeed besides work still 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.260
 also very, very much what I want 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:51.820
 do maybe something you put off 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:56.050
 maybe something new got divorced 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:58.180
 really plans a lot of it 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.699
 how much does it get you 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:04.030
 Coy it seems to me that this was a month 

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:07.060
 because it is well full of such a gap 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:08.110
 complete disconnection from the life that 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:12.520
 we will introduce 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:14.350
 but everyone in their own city and really 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.930
 we are like we all have lived our lives 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:19.360
 recalled in childhood and and recalled their 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:21.550
 youth and thought about what we do in 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.860
 110 years old but it was awesome to me 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:26.100
 it seems we lived we lived small 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.100
 a life 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:32.940
 because it will become more saturated 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.470
 exactly 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:38.020
 emotions positive emotions because 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:40.680
 first of all we studied here 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:42.880
 enjoy life enjoy life and 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:46.630
 to invest in this joy in this 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:52.290
 this life and your life and your life 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:52.290
 families and that's awesome 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:06:02.460
 This means that you need to invest in yourself and 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:10.020
 then the more you invest in 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:12.350
 more you get dividends thanks 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.350
 huge
