the transfer I take it back that was a
really<00:00:02.610> intelligent<00:00:02.879> attack<00:00:03.360> because<00:00:03.689> he

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
really intelligent attack because he

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
know I did a lot of damage so let me

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.919 
know I did a lot of damage so let me
push<00:00:07.680> up<00:00:07.919> right<00:00:08.130> now<00:00:08.340> kill<00:00:09.330> all<00:00:09.480> those<00:00:09.599> units

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
push up right now kill all those units

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.299 
push up right now kill all those units
out<00:00:10.050> in<00:00:10.110> the<00:00:10.170> field<00:00:10.380> and<00:00:10.590> I<00:00:10.679> know<00:00:10.740> that<00:00:10.950> genuine

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
out in the field and I know that genuine

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.070 
out in the field and I know that genuine
is<00:00:11.400> not<00:00:11.550> going<00:00:11.700> to<00:00:11.759> be<00:00:11.849> able<00:00:11.880> to<00:00:12.179> basically<00:00:12.660> try

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
is not going to be able to basically try

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.379 
is not going to be able to basically try
to<00:00:13.170> force<00:00:13.440> him<00:00:13.590> to<00:00:13.679> recommit<00:00:14.070> and<00:00:14.280> build<00:00:14.759> a<00:00:14.880> ton

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
to force him to recommit and build a ton

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.060 
to force him to recommit and build a ton
of<00:00:15.420> troops<00:00:15.750> right<00:00:15.929> there<00:00:16.170> I<00:00:16.320> can<00:00:16.560> sacrifice<00:00:16.770> my

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
of troops right there I can sacrifice my

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.429 
of troops right there I can sacrifice my
army<00:00:17.490> he<00:00:17.670> can't<00:00:17.970> so<00:00:18.539> basically<00:00:18.869> he<00:00:19.050> runs<00:00:19.260> up

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
army he can't so basically he runs up

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.349 
army he can't so basically he runs up
builds<00:00:20.100> a<00:00:20.160> lot<00:00:20.310> of<00:00:20.400> troops<00:00:20.609> sacrifices<00:00:21.270> his

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
builds a lot of troops sacrifices his

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:22.790 
builds a lot of troops sacrifices his
army<00:00:21.660> and<00:00:21.840> then<00:00:21.930> he<00:00:22.050> can't<00:00:22.260> replenish<00:00:22.529> his

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
army and then he can't replenish his

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.560 
army and then he can't replenish his
economy<00:00:23.369> as<00:00:23.640> quickly<00:00:23.850> as<00:00:24.000> we<00:00:24.150> would<00:00:24.180> want<00:00:24.390> to

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
economy as quickly as we would want to

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.179 
economy as quickly as we would want to
he's<00:00:25.050> not<00:00:25.230> going<00:00:25.350> to<00:00:25.380> have<00:00:25.529> basically<00:00:25.920> all

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
he's not going to have basically all

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.250 
he's not going to have basically all
those<00:00:26.400> larvae<00:00:26.699> to<00:00:26.820> spend<00:00:27.060> first<00:00:27.300> of<00:00:27.449> all<00:00:27.570> to

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
those larvae to spend first of all to

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.839 
those larvae to spend first of all to
just<00:00:28.349> kind<00:00:28.560> of<00:00:28.619> cycle<00:00:28.920> around<00:00:29.130> and<00:00:29.519> just

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
just kind of cycle around and just

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.099 
just kind of cycle around and just
immediately<00:00:30.060> build<00:00:30.420> a<00:00:30.480> ton<00:00:30.660> of<00:00:30.689> drone<00:00:30.929> so

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
immediately build a ton of drone so

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.229 
immediately build a ton of drone so
really<00:00:31.380> clever<00:00:31.650> kind<00:00:32.640> of<00:00:32.730> follow-up<00:00:33.120> attack

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
really clever kind of follow-up attack

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.970 
really clever kind of follow-up attack
there<00:00:33.630> by<00:00:33.780> xirrus<00:00:34.140> and<00:00:34.290> I<00:00:34.320> really<00:00:34.559> like<00:00:34.739> it<00:00:34.920> and

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
there by xirrus and I really like it and

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.030 
there by xirrus and I really like it and
I<00:00:35.040> think<00:00:35.100> that<00:00:35.370> is<00:00:35.460> actually<00:00:35.610> very<00:00:35.820> strategic

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:37.040 
I think that is actually very strategic

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.220 
I think that is actually very strategic
not<00:00:38.040> you<00:00:38.399> know<00:00:38.489> super<00:00:38.820> safe<00:00:39.090> but<00:00:39.300> still<00:00:39.570> pretty

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
not you know super safe but still pretty

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.889 
not you know super safe but still pretty
solid<00:00:40.680> in<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:40.800> High<00:00:40.950> Templar<00:00:41.190> right<00:00:41.610> there<00:00:41.969> so

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
solid in the High Templar right there so

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.959 
solid in the High Templar right there so
that's<00:00:43.050> I<00:00:43.200> storm<00:00:43.469> that<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.430> protective<00:00:44.789> site

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
that's I storm that the protective site

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.310 
that's I storm that the protective site
storm<00:00:45.210> should<00:00:45.360> be<00:00:45.480> able<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:45.750> take<00:00:45.930> care<00:00:46.079> of<00:00:46.140> all

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
storm should be able to take care of all

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.020 
storm should be able to take care of all
of<00:00:46.350> that<00:00:46.469> Jam<00:00:46.829> still<00:00:47.340> not<00:00:47.460> able<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:47.760> get<00:00:47.879> in

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
of that Jam still not able to get in

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.209 
of that Jam still not able to get in
looks<00:00:48.539> like<00:00:48.719> that<00:00:48.899> Wow<00:00:49.350> every<00:00:49.980> single

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
looks like that Wow every single

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.610 
looks like that Wow every single
zergling<00:00:50.520> taken<00:00:50.760> out<00:00:50.850> by<00:00:50.969> that<00:00:51.120> storm

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
zergling taken out by that storm

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.630 
zergling taken out by that storm
actually<00:00:52.620> almost<00:00:52.860> thought<00:00:53.070> I<00:00:53.100> saw<00:00:53.399> that<00:00:53.520> high

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
actually almost thought I saw that high

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.500 
actually almost thought I saw that high
templar<00:00:53.969> attack<00:00:54.149> right<00:00:54.329> there

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
templar attack right there

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:55.850 
templar attack right there
upper-left-hand<00:00:55.170> base<00:00:55.440> is<00:00:55.590> going<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.800> be

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
upper-left-hand base is going to be

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.610 
upper-left-hand base is going to be
taken<00:00:56.610> but<00:00:56.730> critically<00:00:57.239> just<00:00:57.930> because<00:00:58.170> of<00:00:58.350> the

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
taken but critically just because of the

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.439 
taken but critically just because of the
production<00:00:59.160> problem<00:00:59.699> i<00:00:59.789> think<00:00:59.969> james<00:01:00.180> it's

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
production problem i think james it's

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:01.490 
production problem i think james it's
going<00:01:00.629> to<00:01:00.690> be<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:00.809> really<00:01:00.930> long<00:01:01.140> time<00:01:01.170> before

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
going to be a really long time before

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.779 
going to be a really long time before
you<00:01:01.649> can<00:01:01.739> really<00:01:01.829> populate<00:01:02.430> it<00:01:02.550> all<00:01:02.640> that

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
you can really populate it all that

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.100 
you can really populate it all that
effectively<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.329> right<00:01:03.449> now<00:01:03.539> he's<00:01:03.690> very<00:01:03.960> low

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
effectively and right now he's very low

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.870 
effectively and right now he's very low
on<00:01:04.229> troops<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:04.860> serious<00:01:05.159> has<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.309> gigantic

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
on troops and serious has a gigantic

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.090 
on troops and serious has a gigantic
army<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.600> very<00:01:07.110> large<00:01:07.320> ball<00:01:07.619> starting<00:01:08.010> to

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
army a very large ball starting to

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.100 
army a very large ball starting to
wander<00:01:08.310> out<00:01:08.549> you<00:01:08.939> should<00:01:09.270> be<00:01:09.420> able<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.750> just

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
wander out you should be able to just

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.020 
wander out you should be able to just
run<00:01:10.500> over<00:01:10.530> this<00:01:10.860> twelve<00:01:11.100> o'clock<00:01:11.340> base<00:01:11.549> looks

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
run over this twelve o'clock base looks

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.310 
run over this twelve o'clock base looks
like<00:01:12.150> some<00:01:12.299> Sun<00:01:12.450> callings<00:01:12.780> being<00:01:12.930> placed<00:01:13.110> but

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
like some Sun callings being placed but

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.859 
like some Sun callings being placed but
these<00:01:13.470> are<00:01:13.590> additional<00:01:14.189> drones<00:01:14.490> that

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
these are additional drones that

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:16.910 
these are additional drones that
essentially<00:01:15.869> Jane<00:01:16.080> cannot<00:01:16.470> afford<00:01:16.770> to

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
essentially Jane cannot afford to

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.010 
essentially Jane cannot afford to
continue<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.400> spend<00:01:17.700> looks<00:01:18.299> like<00:01:18.479> still<00:01:18.780> level

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
continue to spend looks like still level

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.840 
continue to spend looks like still level
two<00:01:19.140> weapons<00:01:19.500> a<00:01:19.680> very<00:01:19.920> low<00:01:20.100> upgrade<00:01:20.460> game<00:01:20.700> at

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
two weapons a very low upgrade game at

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.219 
two weapons a very low upgrade game at
this<00:01:20.970> stage<00:01:21.210> it<00:01:21.450> looks<00:01:21.600> like<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.840> evolution

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
this stage it looks like the evolution

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.510 
this stage it looks like the evolution
chambers<00:01:22.470> I<00:01:22.560> believe<00:01:22.860> being<00:01:23.040> halted<00:01:23.220> just

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
chambers I believe being halted just

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.620 
chambers I believe being halted just
being<00:01:23.700> concerned<00:01:23.970> about<00:01:24.030> other<00:01:24.299> things<00:01:24.509> I

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
being concerned about other things I

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.690 
being concerned about other things I
guess<00:01:24.810> up<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:25.740> this<00:01:25.890> stage<00:01:26.130> but<00:01:26.310> just<00:01:26.520> going<00:01:26.640> to

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
guess up to this stage but just going to

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.120 
guess up to this stage but just going to
barrel<00:01:27.150> in<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:27.540> these<00:01:28.259> couples<00:01:28.680> Earthlings

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
barrel in and these couples Earthlings

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.190 
barrel in and these couples Earthlings
first<00:01:29.790> of<00:01:29.909> all<00:01:30.030> that's<00:01:30.210> just<00:01:30.390> one<00:01:30.570> storm<00:01:30.960> worth

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
first of all that's just one storm worth

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.859 
first of all that's just one storm worth
of<00:01:31.380> zerglings<00:01:31.619> look<00:01:32.189> at<00:01:32.369> that<00:01:32.520> yeah<00:01:32.880> and

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
of zerglings look at that yeah and

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.990 
of zerglings look at that yeah and
additionally<00:01:34.409> yeah<00:01:34.740> just<00:01:35.220> zerglings<00:01:35.670> is<00:01:35.850> not

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
additionally yeah just zerglings is not

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.880 
additionally yeah just zerglings is not
going<00:01:36.150> to<00:01:36.210> cut<00:01:36.360> it<00:01:36.390> against<00:01:36.869> this<00:01:37.079> many<00:01:37.530> troops

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
going to cut it against this many troops

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.550 
going to cut it against this many troops
that<00:01:38.400> are<00:01:38.460> starting<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:38.850> press<00:01:39.090> up<00:01:39.329> so<00:01:39.810> at<00:01:40.439> the

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
that are starting to press up so at the

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.960 
that are starting to press up so at the
very<00:01:40.590> least<00:01:40.890> you<00:01:41.070> can<00:01:41.220> move<00:01:41.369> up<00:01:41.549> to<00:01:41.640> this<00:01:41.729> upper

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
very least you can move up to this upper

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.850 
very least you can move up to this upper
left-hand<00:01:42.180> corner<00:01:42.299> take<00:01:42.630> out<00:01:42.750> that<00:01:42.899> base<00:01:43.110> but

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
left-hand corner take out that base but

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.350 
left-hand corner take out that base but
honestly<00:01:44.310> I<00:01:44.399> think<00:01:44.520> he<00:01:44.759> can<00:01:44.909> just<00:01:45.060> turn<00:01:45.210> around

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
honestly I think he can just turn around

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.179 
honestly I think he can just turn around
just<00:01:45.720> a<00:01:45.840> second<00:01:46.110> once<00:01:46.259> all<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.530> swarm<00:01:46.860> is<00:01:47.009> down

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
just a second once all the swarm is down

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.149 
just a second once all the swarm is down
and<00:01:47.850> just<00:01:48.090> press<00:01:48.479> right<00:01:48.720> through<00:01:49.159> nowhere

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
and just press right through nowhere

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.950 
and just press right through nowhere
near<00:01:50.340> ultralisks<00:01:50.880> which<00:01:51.210> is<00:01:51.390> essentially

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
near ultralisks which is essentially

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.179 
near ultralisks which is essentially
where<00:01:52.079> Jane<00:01:52.229> wanted<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:52.619> really<00:01:52.770> be<00:01:52.979> at<00:01:53.070> this

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
where Jane wanted to really be at this

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.910 
where Jane wanted to really be at this
stage<00:01:54.049> but<00:01:55.049> I<00:01:55.110> think<00:01:55.409> that's<00:01:55.530> going<00:01:55.619> to<00:01:55.680> be<00:01:55.829> it

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
stage but I think that's going to be it

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.069 
stage but I think that's going to be it
i<00:01:56.009> think<00:01:56.070> we're<00:01:56.280> going<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.460> see<00:01:56.520> one<00:01:56.759> last<00:01:57.079> all

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
i think we're going to see one last all

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.690 
i think we're going to see one last all
an<00:01:58.290> attack<00:01:58.560> from<00:01:58.590> jane<00:01:59.009> it<00:01:59.219> looks<00:01:59.460> like<00:01:59.579> he's

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
an attack from jane it looks like he's

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.100 
an attack from jane it looks like he's
going<00:01:59.850> to<00:01:59.909> send<00:02:00.030> it<00:02:00.149> to<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.360> six<00:02:00.600> o'clock<00:02:00.780> base

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
going to send it to the six o'clock base

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.260 
going to send it to the six o'clock base
where<00:02:01.649> you<00:02:01.740> see<00:02:01.920> a<00:02:01.950> lot<00:02:02.159> of<00:02:02.189> dark<00:02:02.430> templar<00:02:02.850> the

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
where you see a lot of dark templar the

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.510 
where you see a lot of dark templar the
the<00:02:03.630> kind<00:02:03.960> of<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.110> counter<00:02:04.500> standard<00:02:05.189> Protoss

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
the kind of the counter standard Protoss

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.039 
the kind of the counter standard Protoss
defense<00:02:05.880> this<00:02:06.000> is<00:02:06.149> like<00:02:06.329> old-school<00:02:06.659> style

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
defense this is like old-school style

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.690 
defense this is like old-school style
you<00:02:07.619> get<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:07.799> Dark<00:02:07.979> Templar<00:02:08.129> in<00:02:08.399> front<00:02:08.550> of<00:02:08.640> the

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
you get the Dark Templar in front of the

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.400 
you get the Dark Templar in front of the
cannons<00:02:09.030> and<00:02:09.179> psystorm<00:02:09.569> behind<00:02:09.929> it's<00:02:10.110> really

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
cannons and psystorm behind it's really

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.350 
cannons and psystorm behind it's really
hard<00:02:10.590> to<00:02:10.739> break<00:02:10.920> that<00:02:11.129> not<00:02:11.640> as<00:02:11.790> hard<00:02:11.970> as<00:02:12.150> I

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
hard to break that not as hard as I

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.500 
hard to break that not as hard as I
would<00:02:12.480> say<00:02:12.660> the<00:02:12.870> the<00:02:13.050> river

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
would say the the river

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.589 
would say the the river
but<00:02:13.989> still<00:02:14.290> very<00:02:14.830> very<00:02:15.489> difficult<00:02:15.670> to<00:02:16.000> counter

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599 
but still very very difficult to counter

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:19.050 
but still very very difficult to counter
I'd<00:02:16.720> say<00:02:17.069> just<00:02:18.069> very<00:02:18.310> frustrating<00:02:18.790> for<00:02:18.819> Zerg

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
I'd say just very frustrating for Zerg

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.759 
I'd say just very frustrating for Zerg
players<00:02:19.329> it's<00:02:19.659> kind<00:02:19.840> of<00:02:19.870> the<00:02:19.989> same<00:02:20.230> thing<00:02:20.680> as

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
players it's kind of the same thing as

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:22.050 
players it's kind of the same thing as
the<00:02:20.860> spore<00:02:21.159> sunken<00:02:21.519> lurker<00:02:21.700> defense

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
the spore sunken lurker defense

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.000 
the spore sunken lurker defense
comparatively<00:02:22.629> but<00:02:23.110> anyway<00:02:23.349> moving<00:02:23.590> in<00:02:23.829> now

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
comparatively but anyway moving in now

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.860 
comparatively but anyway moving in now
we<00:02:24.069> see<00:02:24.310> the<00:02:24.430> big<00:02:24.549> attack<00:02:24.849> starting<00:02:25.540> to<00:02:25.629> barrel

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
we see the big attack starting to barrel

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.300 
we see the big attack starting to barrel
in<00:02:25.989> at<00:02:26.110> the<00:02:26.200> same<00:02:26.379> time<00:02:26.590> Jane<00:02:26.860> committing

he doesn't have detection Dark Templar
running<00:02:30.849> in<00:02:30.940> there<00:02:31.170> really<00:02:32.170> perfect<00:02:32.560> to<00:02:32.650> tack

running in there really perfect to tack
there<00:02:33.010> by<00:02:33.159> zeros<00:02:33.430> there's<00:02:33.610> actually<00:02:33.909> backing

there by zeros there's actually backing
up<00:02:34.510> though<00:02:35.099> looks<00:02:36.099> like<00:02:36.220> he<00:02:36.370> ended<00:02:36.700> up<00:02:36.790> losing

well<00:02:37.840> now<00:02:37.959> we<00:02:38.019> still<00:02:38.079> got<00:02:38.379> and<00:02:38.500> reserve<00:02:38.739> it

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.809 
up now a main base has been emptied but

still it's three base versus three and
even<00:03:55.299> bases<00:03:55.660> that<00:03:55.930> means<00:03:56.109> Protoss<00:03:56.530> is<00:03:56.739> winning

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
a little bit more difficulty and that's

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.770 
a little bit more difficulty and that's
just<00:04:02.620> kind<00:04:02.859> of<00:04:02.889> a<00:04:02.949> testament<00:04:03.370> to<00:04:03.519> the<00:04:04.000> skill<00:04:04.750> of

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
just kind of a testament to the skill of

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.949 
just kind of a testament to the skill of
Jane<00:04:05.079> here<00:04:05.579> backing<00:04:06.579> out<00:04:06.819> of<00:04:06.849> the<00:04:07.000> storm<00:04:07.299> doing

leaving those Earthlings out I think one

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:13.439 
leaving those Earthlings out I think one
of<00:04:12.190> the<00:04:12.370> factors<00:04:12.729> might<00:04:12.879> have<00:04:13.030> just<00:04:13.150> been<00:04:13.329> the

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:13.449 
of the factors might have just been the

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:15.659 
of the factors might have just been the
lack<00:04:14.049> of<00:04:14.079> upgrades<00:04:14.590> he's<00:04:15.069> just<00:04:15.250> now<00:04:15.430> getting

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:15.669

in<00:04:17.530> oh<00:04:17.709> maybe<00:04:17.949> not<00:04:18.159> I<00:04:18.220> thought<00:04:18.489> he's<00:04:18.609> going<00:04:18.729> to

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019

despite<00:05:47.230> their<00:05:47.470> numbers<00:05:47.890> without<00:05:48.550> some

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:48.970 
despite their numbers without some

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:50.370 
despite their numbers without some
absolutely<00:05:49.450> excellent<00:05:49.630> storm<00:05:49.960> you<00:05:50.080> can<00:05:50.200> see

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:50.380 
absolutely excellent storm you can see

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:51.720 
absolutely excellent storm you can see
how<00:05:50.500> they<00:05:50.650> just<00:05:50.800> keep<00:05:50.980> end<00:05:51.190> up<00:05:51.280> getting<00:05:51.520> killed

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:51.730 
how they just keep end up getting killed

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:53.790 
how they just keep end up getting killed
but<00:05:52.330> but<00:05:52.900> looks<00:05:53.110> like<00:05:53.170> actually<00:05:53.500> just<00:05:53.740> the

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:53.800 
but but looks like actually just the

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.530 
but but looks like actually just the
pier<00:05:54.430> number<00:05:54.610> they're<00:05:54.880> going<00:05:55.000> to<00:05:55.060> builder<00:05:55.300> to

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:55.540 
pier number they're going to builder to

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:57.900 
pier number they're going to builder to
work<00:05:55.840> through<00:05:56.200> that<00:05:56.380> but<00:05:57.100> still<00:05:57.430> all<00:05:57.730> an

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:57.910 
work through that but still all an

00:05:57.910 --> 00:05:59.550 
work through that but still all an
inordinate<00:05:58.270> amount<00:05:58.300> dying<00:05:58.870> there<00:05:59.080> and<00:05:59.170> you

00:05:59.550 --> 00:05:59.560 
inordinate amount dying there and you

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:00.960 
inordinate amount dying there and you
can<00:05:59.650> just<00:05:59.830> see<00:05:59.920> them<00:06:00.070> popping<00:06:00.460> left<00:06:00.640> and<00:06:00.790> right

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:00.970 
can just see them popping left and right

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:03.150 
can just see them popping left and right
so<00:06:01.420> not<00:06:01.660> the<00:06:01.780> best<00:06:01.960> resource<00:06:02.440> kind<00:06:03.100> of

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:03.160 
so not the best resource kind of

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:04.080 
so not the best resource kind of
investment<00:06:03.550> there<00:06:03.670> looks<00:06:03.850> like<00:06:03.880> some

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:04.090 
investment there looks like some

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:05.790 
investment there looks like some
hydraulics<00:06:04.480> pressing<00:06:04.870> up<00:06:04.960> as<00:06:05.080> well<00:06:05.200> get<00:06:05.680> to<00:06:05.740> be

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:05.800 
hydraulics pressing up as well get to be

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.200 
hydraulics pressing up as well get to be
able<00:06:05.950> to<00:06:06.040> stop<00:06:06.190> this<00:06:06.340> middle<00:06:06.610> base<00:06:06.730> from<00:06:06.940> going

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:24.400 
minerals in the bank not a lot of gas

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.240 
minerals in the bank not a lot of gas
maybe<00:06:24.670> a<00:06:24.760> little<00:06:24.880> bit<00:06:25.030> gas<00:06:25.180> capped<00:06:25.510> here<00:06:26.250> looks

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:27.250

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:30.790 
together this should be depleted yet

actually<00:06:37.090> doing<00:06:37.630> pretty<00:06:37.720> solidly<00:06:38.320> his<00:06:38.980> main

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:39.280 
actually doing pretty solidly his main

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:40.740 
actually doing pretty solidly his main
is<00:06:39.490> mined<00:06:39.700> out<00:06:39.880> but<00:06:40.060> his<00:06:40.150> natural<00:06:40.450> second

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:40.750 
is mined out but his natural second

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:42.450 
is mined out but his natural second
because<00:06:41.170> it<00:06:41.320> was<00:06:41.440> just<00:06:41.470> not<00:06:41.890> filled<00:06:42.160> up<00:06:42.310> for

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:42.460 
because it was just not filled up for

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:44.100 
because it was just not filled up for
quite<00:06:42.640> some<00:06:42.820> time<00:06:42.850> still<00:06:43.240> rolling<00:06:43.540> he's<00:06:43.960> got

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:44.110 
quite some time still rolling he's got

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:45.390 
quite some time still rolling he's got
the<00:06:44.230> twelve<00:06:44.470> o'clock<00:06:44.740> so<00:06:44.950> he's<00:06:45.070> running<00:06:45.280> off

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:45.400 
the twelve o'clock so he's running off

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:47.580 
the twelve o'clock so he's running off
two<00:06:45.580> bases<00:06:45.970> soon<00:06:46.180> to<00:06:46.270> be<00:06:46.390> three<00:06:46.470> then<00:06:47.470> he's

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:47.590 
two bases soon to be three then he's

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:48.630 
two bases soon to be three then he's
going<00:06:47.680> to<00:06:47.740> have<00:06:47.860> the<00:06:47.980> fourth<00:06:48.250> in<00:06:48.370> the<00:06:48.460> upper

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:48.640 
going to have the fourth in the upper

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:50.040 
going to have the fourth in the upper
left<00:06:48.820> hand<00:06:48.880> corner<00:06:49.000> and<00:06:49.330> currently<00:06:49.750> he's<00:06:49.900> just

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:50.050 
left hand corner and currently he's just

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:52.520 
left hand corner and currently he's just
going<00:06:50.170> up<00:06:50.350> against<00:06:50.560> the<00:06:50.770> two<00:06:51.010> base<00:06:51.220> xirrus<00:06:51.700> who

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:52.530 
going up against the two base xirrus who

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:54.450 
going up against the two base xirrus who
really<00:06:53.530> all<00:06:53.650> I<00:06:53.680> think<00:06:53.950> he<00:06:54.040> needs<00:06:54.190> to<00:06:54.250> do<00:06:54.370> is

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:54.460 
really all I think he needs to do is

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:56.100 
really all I think he needs to do is
just<00:06:54.520> make<00:06:54.880> sure<00:06:55.150> he<00:06:55.240> is<00:06:55.270> a<00:06:55.360> mix<00:06:55.690> of<00:06:55.810> units

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:56.110 
just make sure he is a mix of units

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:57.600 
just make sure he is a mix of units
rather<00:06:56.290> than<00:06:56.530> just<00:06:56.680> all<00:06:56.920> one<00:06:57.250> or<00:06:57.460> the<00:06:57.580> other

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:57.610 
rather than just all one or the other

00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:59.280 
rather than just all one or the other
and<00:06:58.000> he'll<00:06:58.540> be<00:06:58.660> in<00:06:58.750> a<00:06:58.810> really<00:06:59.020> good<00:06:59.110> position

00:06:59.280 --> 00:06:59.290 
and he'll be in a really good position

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:01.800 
and he'll be in a really good position
to<00:06:59.560> kind<00:07:00.160> of<00:07:00.220> work<00:07:00.730> this<00:07:00.880> out<00:07:01.060> looks<00:07:01.540> like<00:07:01.690> you

be pretty good for him actually overall
I<00:07:10.480> still<00:07:10.780> feel<00:07:10.930> like<00:07:10.960> xerosis<00:07:11.530> in<00:07:11.650> the

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:11.770 
I still feel like xerosis in the

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:13.080 
I still feel like xerosis in the
overwhelming<00:07:12.100> position<00:07:12.610> just<00:07:12.790> because<00:07:13.000> of

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:13.090 
overwhelming position just because of

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:15.480 
overwhelming position just because of
the<00:07:13.180> money<00:07:13.360> in<00:07:13.600> his<00:07:13.780> bank<00:07:13.810> and<00:07:14.490> additionally

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:15.490 
the money in his bank and additionally

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:16.890 
the money in his bank and additionally
the<00:07:15.610> troops<00:07:15.880> he's<00:07:16.030> got<00:07:16.180> on<00:07:16.300> the<00:07:16.419> ground<00:07:16.630> but

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:16.900 
the troops he's got on the ground but

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:18.330 
the troops he's got on the ground but
right<00:07:17.470> now<00:07:17.620> it<00:07:17.740> looks<00:07:17.800> like<00:07:17.950> he's<00:07:18.130> going<00:07:18.250> to

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:18.340 
right now it looks like he's going to

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:19.950 
right now it looks like he's going to
end<00:07:18.430> up<00:07:18.460> losing<00:07:18.820> these<00:07:18.940> results<00:07:19.660> just<00:07:19.810> trying

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:19.960 
end up losing these results just trying

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:21.000 
end up losing these results just trying
to<00:07:20.020> power<00:07:20.230> down<00:07:20.380> the<00:07:20.440> hatch<00:07:20.650> rain<00:07:20.860> they're

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:21.010 
to power down the hatch rain they're

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:23.850 
to power down the hatch rain they're
nowhere<00:07:21.340> near<00:07:21.490> killing<00:07:22.030> it<00:07:22.150> so<00:07:22.600> gonna<00:07:23.050> die

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:23.860 
nowhere near killing it so gonna die

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:26.610 
nowhere near killing it so gonna die
pretty<00:07:24.160> rapidly<00:07:24.550> right<00:07:24.820> there<00:07:25.500> still<00:07:26.500> these

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:26.620 
pretty rapidly right there still these

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:29.460 
pretty rapidly right there still these
shuttles<00:07:27.120> those<00:07:28.120> shuttles<00:07:28.360> were<00:07:28.540> around<00:07:28.810> kind

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:29.470 
shuttles those shuttles were around kind

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:30.540 
shuttles those shuttles were around kind
of<00:07:29.530> curious<00:07:29.710> if<00:07:29.800> we<00:07:29.860> can<00:07:29.980> do<00:07:30.070> something<00:07:30.310> else

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:30.550 
of curious if we can do something else

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:32.130 
of curious if we can do something else
turning<00:07:31.120> around<00:07:31.180> looks<00:07:31.480> like<00:07:31.600> another<00:07:31.810> attack

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:32.140 
turning around looks like another attack

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:33.690 
turning around looks like another attack
grouping<00:07:32.530> and<00:07:32.650> see<00:07:32.800> I<00:07:32.830> wish<00:07:32.980> results<00:07:33.400> were<00:07:33.550> in

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:33.700 
grouping and see I wish results were in

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:35.580 
grouping and see I wish results were in
with<00:07:33.880> this<00:07:34.090> attack<00:07:34.390> group<00:07:34.600> and<00:07:34.810> all<00:07:35.350> of<00:07:35.470> this

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:35.590 
with this attack group and all of this

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:37.380 
with this attack group and all of this
was<00:07:35.770> going<00:07:35.919> into<00:07:36.160> that<00:07:36.220> natural<00:07:36.669> secondary<00:07:37.150> so

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:37.390 
was going into that natural secondary so

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:38.909 
was going into that natural secondary so
it<00:07:37.630> looks<00:07:37.780> like<00:07:37.840> James<00:07:38.110> journey<00:07:38.350> to<00:07:38.530> push<00:07:38.680> back
