00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 Mexico has a lot of legends that yes 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.420
 the naval ones that if the weeper that if the 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.519
 girl of the pantheon that if elba esther 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.469
 Gordillo is a zombie that is the owl 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.150
 and well among the many that we have in 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.980
 the last stream there was one that called me 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:18.000
 attention thanks a subscriber this 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:20.100
 is the legend of the house of the aunt toña 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.110
 the legend says that in the forest of 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.520
 chapultepec the largest urban park 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.650
 of all Latin America and more 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.020
 specifically in the section next to 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.300
 pantheon of sorrows there is a house or 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.220
 good a mansion that belonged to a 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.800
 Mexican old woman everyone knew 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.960
 as Aunt Antonia was a widow and possessed 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.270
 great riches but they did not have any 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.370
 son or family so he decided that 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.989
 so as not to be alone, she would shelter children from 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.059
 street since the house was quite 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.949
 great and her vast wealth aunt doña 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.360
 was considered for a long time a 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:50.520
 symbol of kindness and good 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.440
 intentions but unfortunately the 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.239
 greed of some was greater and one of 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.460
 so many nights a group of young people 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.500
 decided to launch and seek the assumption 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.059
 treasure of aunt antonia so that she can 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.190
 steal it but the only thing that they got 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.350
 it was that the aunt found them the woman 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.330
 I was just going to scold them but the 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.190
 fear and paranoia of young people the 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.409
 forced to beat the woman until the 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.929
 death and then 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.880
 and from there the house was emptied of all 

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:16.439
 its inhabitants including children who 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.509
 they were good with her they claimed that in 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.549
 the night they were scared they threw the 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.530
 bed and even claimed to have seen her in 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.509
 the reflections of the windows and with the 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.450
 time in the house there was no other inhabitant 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.530
 more than Aunt Antonia herself 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.030
 supposedly to get to the house there 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.520
 to go through a ravine of several 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.750
 meters of depth and two bridges 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.119
 dangerously undone those who have 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.039
 entered the house they assure that only 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.349
 when entering the events begin 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:41.039
 paranormal the light does not penetrate the 

00:01:40.349 --> 00:01:42.629
 home 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:45.030
 Intruders feel that someone 

00:01:42.629 --> 00:01:47.129
 observe at all times but the more 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.469
 lacking the most hostile mansion it 

00:01:47.129 --> 00:01:51.509
 the apparitions return to the point that 

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:53.009
 to the aunt's room supposedly 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.530
 located at the top of the mansion 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.750
 nobody has been able to arrive and those who have 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.020
 never got to talk about what 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.020
 they saw 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.470
 Well the truth is that this legend is 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.119
 very good and it makes us want to get in 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.310
 our indiana jones costume to go by 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.259
 this house but not all as it is told 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.239
 the reality is that first in the park 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.670
 de chapultepec and in its third section 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.650
 if there are two bridges but these do not 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.959
 belong to the house of aunt tonya ni 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.640
 they head towards there are only vestiges of 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.650
 many years ago maybe for some 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.750
 project that did not materialize if you go up 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.239
 to the bridge you will only waste your time because 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.340
 does not lead to the house of the earth second 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:31.980
 Aunt's house plays the pinnacle of 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.360
 this legend the central axis of terror to 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.760
 the one that supposedly nobody can access 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.920
 it is inhabited and not by ghosts but 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.660
 for normal people and to finally kill 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.600
 this legend the third point is that the 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.069
 house is in a residential area 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.959
 highly inhabited part of the house to 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:48.000
 the one we all know is the part 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.340
 back the entrance is on the street 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.739
 summits of acultzingo and I repeat is a 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.510
 residential area the guards of said 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:56.430
 zone they always go to people 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.980
 asking if it's the supposed home of the 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.390
 Aunt Dona and never has anyone lived there 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.670
 that name has not had much 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.799
 place some paranormal event but for 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.510
 every fake legend comes out a lot that 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:08.670
 they could be true you want 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.409
 subscribe to the dimension that you open for 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.150
 day to day to be able to hear about them 

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:13.650
 meanwhile I leave the question 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.270
 this week where they would like 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.330

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:21.210
 it is for 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:23.190
 where would you like to send Murdock if 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:27.150
 they could send him to make a video of 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:30.960
 Terror option to a graveyard option 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:34.290

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:37.260
