I<00:03:42.810> feel<00:03:43.170> like<00:03:43.460> another<00:03:44.460> EA<00:03:44.700> franchise<00:03:45.390> that

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
I feel like another EA franchise that

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.010 
I feel like another EA franchise that
has<00:03:46.320> been<00:03:46.560> struggling<00:03:46.920> is<00:03:47.280> men<00:03:47.940> and<00:03:48.300> I<00:03:48.750> feel

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:49.020 
has been struggling is men and I feel

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.320 
has been struggling is men and I feel
like<00:03:49.290> they<00:03:49.860> have<00:03:50.130> a<00:03:50.340> House<00:03:50.640> bill<00:03:50.670> and<00:03:51.210> they're

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
like they have a House bill and they're

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:52.940 
like they have a House bill and they're
trying<00:03:51.570> to<00:03:51.630> put<00:03:51.750> a<00:03:51.780> foundation<00:03:52.320> underneath<00:03:52.590> it

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
trying to put a foundation underneath it

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.350 
trying to put a foundation underneath it
and<00:03:53.310> that's<00:03:53.460> not<00:03:53.670> the<00:03:53.820> way<00:03:53.940> you<00:03:54.000> approach

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
and that's not the way you approach

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.390 
and that's not the way you approach
things<00:03:54.570> you<00:03:54.780> start<00:03:54.840> with<00:03:55.080> the<00:03:55.170> foundation

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
things you start with the foundation

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.600 
things you start with the foundation
first<00:03:56.400> then<00:03:57.000> you<00:03:57.030> build<00:03:57.450> up<00:03:57.710> Matt<00:03:58.710> and<00:03:58.920> decided

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
first then you build up Matt and decided

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.250 
first then you build up Matt and decided
to<00:03:59.670> do<00:03:59.760> a<00:03:59.790> backwards<00:04:00.330> and<00:04:00.540> that's<00:04:00.810> making<00:04:01.080> the

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
to do a backwards and that's making the

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.830 
to do a backwards and that's making the
process<00:04:01.500> of<00:04:01.980> making<00:04:02.490> it<00:04:02.580> a<00:04:02.670> great<00:04:02.700> game<00:04:03.180> take

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
process of making it a great game take

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.530 
process of making it a great game take
that<00:04:04.080> much<00:04:04.320> longer<00:04:04.350> with<00:04:05.280> EA<00:04:05.580> sports<00:04:06.120> UFC<00:04:06.210> I

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
hope they build the foundation the

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.910 
hope they build the foundation the
