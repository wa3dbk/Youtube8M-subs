00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.050
 hello friends welcome to a new 

00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:06.990
 chess match 

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:09.780
 this time I present a trap 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.930
 another in paris age in the dc in the 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:18.390
 Sicilian defense in the Hungarian variant 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:24.950
 the black begin in 4 11 5 horse efe 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.950
 3 of 6 of 4 cx of 4 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.560
 Lady x of 4 entering the variant 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.560
 Hungarian 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:40.070
 c6 horse threaten the lady but good 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:42.920
 this is studying is studied by 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.860
 the theory and the white simply what 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.560
 they avoid nailing the horse with the king 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:52.510
 OK 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:58.890
 to the movie 5 to 6 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:58.890
 and finally by c 6 bc 6 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:06.510
 c4 horse efe 6 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.510
 caballÃ© c3 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:14.010
 finally g5 at the end is 7 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.750
 rock the tree 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:25.890
 here and Black play bishop of 7 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:28.770
 and they make the mistake 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.860
 in which they will see themselves in a position 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.200
 lost is worth 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:37.670
 the right thing would be 5 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:41.150
 to avoid the advance 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:47.030
 5 of the white 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:49.520
 they decide to make bishop of 7 and commit 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.320
 decisive mistake because they give you the 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:55.180
 opportunity to the white to advance the 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.180
 pawn 5 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:04.350
 they threaten the horse and if now 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.350
 of poor 5 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:12.200
 Well, horse for 5 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:19.130
 and we see how three white pieces are 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:23.390
 threatening 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:27.050
 to the bishop the more to the lady is 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.900
 in the open column that the tower can 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:32.450
 control 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:35.090
 the sea that the tower controls 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.270
 c 5 to threaten the lady the lady 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:42.250
 remove there are 3 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:45.930
 and now yes tower to 7 to defend his 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:52.440
 Bishop, we just see how 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:52.440
 bishop by efe 6 bishop by efe 6 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:03.340
 Black people eat a fork of 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:07.300
 white horse with c6 are you 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:10.300
 threatening the lady and the tower 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:12.280
 and the bishop does not forgive the horse 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:17.080
 can be captured because the action of the 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:19.390
 tower that dominates the open column 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.920
 capture the lady and they would lose the 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:24.210
 undergrowth 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.210
 we return to the position 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:27.960
 previous 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:44.069
 and if the black woman decides to leave the action 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:47.650
 of the tower is worth as a lady c7 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:50.310
 example comes horse by 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.310
 c7 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:58.190
 horse x 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:04:03.250
 c7 forgiveness of 7 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:03.250
 at last for 7 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:11.570
 king for 7 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:17.060
 and we see now instead of being the 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:20.269
 horse of before is the horse of c3 the 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:22.170
 that goes into action as 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:24.660
 horse 

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:30.690
 of 5 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:32.370
 double fork to king lady and this horse 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.940
 can not be captured because 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:39.940
 simply the king is nailed by the 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:42.190
 lady and they would lose their die 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.170
 good if you liked it is 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:48.610
 trap or mistake as you want to call it 

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:52.600
 Tactical error then nothing to do 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:54.610
 like to subscribe if you are not and we 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:57.060
 we see in the next video greetings 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.060
