00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:09.030
 Welcome dear audience to 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.830
 a new episode my ship tv today 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.799
 directly from board my ship three 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.780
 know in turku on the stx shipyard where the 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.699
 my ship is just being built and three 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.640
 I stand on deck 12 the pool deck 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.769
 behind me is the 25 meter long 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.630
 outside pool has since agree on 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.430
 some time passed and we 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.199
 would like to show you today how 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.199
 The new feel-good ship currently looks like 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.360
 I'm still on deck 12 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.460
 and they are working hard here 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.470
 because it is not just an outdoor pool 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.770
 on board but also an indoor pool 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.940
 and that arises right here 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.700
 Also belong to the area too 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.620
 a grotto and a whirlpool 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.660
 you can already guess it here arises 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.320
 the indispensable right between inside 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.320
 and outside 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:16.510
 here on the 14 arose one of 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.790
 a total of ten sky and sea â€‹â€‹offer 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:21.850
 they will be 40 square meters and big 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.500
 have up there a 29 square meters 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.950
 large roof terrace partially 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.950
 is covered 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.290
 here on deck four and five arises 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.010
 Theater where the big shows take place 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.990
 become 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.790
 behind me is just eagerly at the 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.140
 So it worked too soon 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.140
 Curtain on hot can 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:58.729
 Also the tui was my ship three 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:00.530
 slowly takes shape 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:02.359
 there you can already read the front 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.289
 recognize and behind me is just the 

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:05.289
 laid floor 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.160
 we are now in the screw on deck 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.230
 5 Here you can overlook the 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.420
 main restaurant atlantic evenings 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.310
 Enjoy live music and delicious drinks 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.780
 a little bit has to be done here 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.550
 But I can have a look 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.330
 Throw on the chandelier 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.330
 because he is already hanging 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:44.489
 You can already see him here at the stern 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.560

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:48.810
 the landmark of my ship 3 of the 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.459
 diamond until the completion of the new 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.349
 feel-good ship and therefore also the 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.640
 Unveiling the diamond still has to be one 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:55.379
 be worked a bit 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.330
 but I hope you have our little one 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:58.560

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.299
