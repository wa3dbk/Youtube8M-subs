in<00:00:39.600> this<00:00:39.690> record<00:00:39.930> was<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.980> issue<00:00:41.370> of<00:00:41.870> you<00:00:42.870> know

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:42.900 
in this record was the issue of you know

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.100 
in this record was the issue of you know
of<00:00:43.320> fear<00:00:43.620> driving<00:00:44.070> us<00:00:44.190> towards<00:00:44.489> faith<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:45.239> and

it's kind of outside more of a
temperatures<00:02:39.500> in<00:02:39.680> the<00:02:39.910> scenario<00:02:40.910> and<00:02:41.239> and

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
temperatures in the scenario and and

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.069 
temperatures in the scenario and and
just<00:02:42.580> just<00:02:43.580> really<00:02:43.760> talks<00:02:44.480> a<00:02:44.630> lot<00:02:44.720> about<00:02:44.780> the

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:45.079 
just just really talks a lot about the

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:46.930 
just just really talks a lot about the
mind<00:02:45.319> of<00:02:45.530> what<00:02:45.890> a<00:02:45.920> person<00:02:46.160> might<00:02:46.489> go<00:02:46.700> through

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
mind of what a person might go through

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.500 
mind of what a person might go through
in<00:02:47.180> the<00:02:47.660> midst<00:02:48.019> of<00:02:48.049> an<00:02:48.200> affair<00:02:48.620> or<00:02:49.239> the<00:02:50.239> midst

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
in the midst of an affair or the midst

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.390 
in the midst of an affair or the midst
of<00:02:50.569> struggling<00:02:51.049> through<00:02:51.319> difficulties<00:02:52.190> in<00:02:52.340> a

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
of struggling through difficulties in a

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.390 
of struggling through difficulties in a
relationship<00:02:53.060> so<00:02:53.560> yeah<00:02:54.560> I<00:02:54.860> think<00:02:55.040> it<00:02:55.220> really

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
relationship so yeah I think it really

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.339 
relationship so yeah I think it really
speaks<00:02:55.549> well<00:02:55.910> of<00:02:55.940> how<00:02:56.209> a<00:02:56.239> seed<00:02:57.170> in

00:02:57.339 --> 00:02:57.349 
speaks well of how a seed in

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:00.640 
speaks well of how a seed in
relationship<00:02:58.069> can<00:02:58.280> confessor<00:02:59.209> and<00:02:59.590> grow<00:03:00.590> to

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
relationship can confessor and grow to

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.740 
relationship can confessor and grow to
such<00:03:00.920> proportions<00:03:01.280> that<00:03:01.579> although<00:03:02.239> wasn't

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
such proportions that although wasn't

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.979 
such proportions that although wasn't
significant<00:03:03.440> at<00:03:04.099> the<00:03:04.280> time<00:03:04.569> it<00:03:05.569> can<00:03:05.690> become

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
significant at the time it can become

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:08.979 
significant at the time it can become
something<00:03:06.019> so<00:03:06.829> much<00:03:07.010> more<00:03:07.780> troubling<00:03:08.780> in<00:03:08.900> the

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
something so much more troubling in the

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:34.949 
something so much more troubling in the
end

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:37.600 

well<00:03:35.959> let's<00:03:36.830> say<00:03:37.010> let's<00:03:37.250> see<00:03:37.370> what<00:03:37.520> the

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
well let's say let's see what the

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:46.809 
well let's say let's see what the
audience<00:03:37.730> thinks<00:03:43.720> I'll<00:03:44.720> just<00:03:44.930> no<00:03:45.170> no<00:03:45.700> no<00:03:46.700> in
