it really seems like it's bigger than a
regular<00:01:06.240> paga<00:01:06.659> additional<00:01:07.110> world<00:01:07.290> just<00:01:07.530> how

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
regular paga additional world just how

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.550

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
high it goes it's crazy but somehow it's

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.980 
high it goes it's crazy but somehow it's
all<00:01:10.740> fit<00:01:11.100> into<00:01:11.280> into<00:01:12.210> one<00:01:12.390> world<00:01:12.570> so<00:01:12.840> it's

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
all fit into into one world so it's

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.440 
all fit into into one world so it's
pretty<00:01:13.290> pretty<00:01:13.650> crazy<00:01:14.100> here<00:01:14.850> we<00:01:14.939> have<00:01:15.090> a<00:01:15.119> super

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
pretty pretty crazy here we have a super

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.219 
pretty pretty crazy here we have a super
like<00:01:16.009> super<00:01:17.009> highly<00:01:17.549> populated<00:01:18.540> part<00:01:18.930> of<00:01:19.020> it<00:01:19.110> I
