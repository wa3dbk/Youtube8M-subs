00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.710

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:32.710
 a little bit these dragon ball movies 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:35.199

 they are also a full edition without censorship 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:12.290
 all so the parties that were 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:14.450
 censured because here in Spain they have 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.910
 got the teacher in Japanese in the 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.460
 piece of film that maybe in 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:22.520
 some is two seconds and in others, 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:25.190
 can reach 30 seconds and well 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:29.750
 As you can see here we have the titles of 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:33.980

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:41.390
 here they do not come numbered here they come 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:44.810
 simply because 1 2 3 about dragon ball 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:47.380
 a special and then a dragon ball 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:52.659
 the movie 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:55.210

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:58.840

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:03.399
 Spanish Japanese Catalan Euskera in Dolby 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:05.380
 stereo 2.0 in extras because the extras are 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:07.689
 they could have worked harder or they could 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.149
 have waited since just then 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:12.340
 they come 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.239
 technical sheet artistic sheet and others 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.480
 Titles 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:17.560
 that is, they advertise other series other 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.360
 films 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.959
 Well, another manga or another anime that 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:26.590
