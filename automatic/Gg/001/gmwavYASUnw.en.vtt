00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
make the move so I was I was trying to

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.340 
make the move so I was I was trying to
push<00:01:13.950> him<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.340> make<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.640> mistake<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.350> to

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
push him to make the mistake and and to

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.539 
push him to make the mistake and and to
be<00:01:16.439> honest<00:01:16.650> those<00:01:16.770> corners<00:01:17.159> that<00:01:17.340> the

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
be honest those corners that the

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.270 
be honest those corners that the
Becket's<00:01:18.000> complex<00:01:18.509> than<00:01:18.689> 45<00:01:19.380> it's<00:01:19.619> relatively

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
Becket's complex than 45 it's relatively

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.859 
Becket's complex than 45 it's relatively
straightforward<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.240> it<00:01:21.360> was<00:01:21.509> quite<00:01:21.630> gusty

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
straightforward and it was quite gusty

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.260 
straightforward and it was quite gusty
today<00:01:22.259> I<00:01:22.290> think<00:01:22.500> probably<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.610> wind<00:01:23.790> called

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
today I think probably the wind called

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.330 
today I think probably the wind called
him<00:01:24.450> out<00:01:24.600> today<00:01:24.840> but<00:01:24.900> I<00:01:25.259> mean<00:01:25.439> as<00:01:25.619> soon<00:01:25.770> as<00:01:25.950> he

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
him out today but I mean as soon as he

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.359 
him out today but I mean as soon as he
was<00:01:26.520> off<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.759> line<00:01:26.909> i<00:01:26.939> was<00:01:27.240> i<00:01:27.450> was<00:01:27.750> there<00:01:27.990> and

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
was off the line i was i was there and

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:31.130 
was off the line i was i was there and
and<00:01:29.369> that's<00:01:29.549> for<00:01:29.850> you<00:01:29.970> what<00:01:30.150> he<00:01:30.210> gotta<00:01:30.360> do<00:01:30.540> and

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
and that's for you what he gotta do and

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.780 
and that's for you what he gotta do and
i<00:01:31.290> was<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.740> blue<00:01:31.950> flags<00:01:32.280> i<00:01:32.430> know<00:01:32.490> something

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
i was the blue flags i know something

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
really difficult especially after the

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.120 
really difficult especially after the
safety<00:01:38.670> car<00:01:38.850> I<00:01:39.659> mean<00:01:40.320> I<00:01:40.409> was<00:01:40.560> just<00:01:40.740> looking<00:01:41.040> in

the murrells tried to let all the guys
you<00:01:43.500> know<00:01:43.530> by<00:01:44.159> butt<00:01:44.490> heads<00:01:45.479> up<00:01:45.630> as<00:01:45.810> well<00:01:45.990> a<00:01:46.020> look

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
you know by butt heads up as well a look

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.410 
you know by butt heads up as well a look
where<00:01:46.380> were<00:01:46.619> hi<00:01:46.740> kids<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:47.399> it<00:01:48.210> was<00:01:48.390> a

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
where were hi kids and it was a

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.999 
where were hi kids and it was a
difficult<00:01:48.630> situation<00:01:48.930> and<00:01:49.500> I<00:01:49.680> think<00:01:49.890> they

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
difficult situation and I think they

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.240 
difficult situation and I think they
have<00:01:50.100> to<00:01:50.250> really<00:01:50.490> think<00:01:50.670> about<00:01:52.070> the<00:01:53.070> safety

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
have to really think about the safety

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.590 
have to really think about the safety
car<00:01:53.490> situation<00:01:53.880> again<00:01:54.119> I<00:01:54.210> mean<00:01:54.329> this<00:01:54.420> is<00:01:54.479> just

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
car situation again I mean this is just

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.780 
car situation again I mean this is just
on<00:01:55.320> one<00:01:55.619> part<00:01:55.860> it's<00:01:56.009> dangerous<00:01:56.490> i<00:01:56.520> think

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
on one part it's dangerous i think

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.510 
on one part it's dangerous i think
because<00:01:57.320> you<00:01:58.320> have<00:01:58.409> to<00:01:58.530> let<00:01:58.619> so<00:01:58.799> many<00:01:58.950> cars<00:01:59.280> by

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
because you have to let so many cars by

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.469 
because you have to let so many cars by
and<00:01:59.790> it<00:01:59.909> was<00:02:00.719> a<00:02:00.750> tricky<00:02:01.079> moment<00:02:01.380> and

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
and it was a tricky moment and

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:04.310 
and it was a tricky moment and
