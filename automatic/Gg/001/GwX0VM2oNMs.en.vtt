00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
good actually I expected it to be

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.800 
good actually I expected it to be
a little<00:02:20.630> bit<00:02:20.750> scarier<00:02:21.230> and<00:02:21.500> I<00:02:22.160> I<00:02:22.750> don't<00:02:23.750> know

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
a little bit scarier and I I don't know

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.300 
a little bit scarier and I I don't know
how<00:02:23.930> I<00:02:23.960> feel<00:02:24.110> about<00:02:24.170> the<00:02:24.440> ending<00:02:24.710> it<00:02:24.830> was<00:02:24.950> a

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
how I feel about the ending it was a

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.400 
how I feel about the ending it was a
little<00:02:25.490> bit<00:02:25.730> ended<00:02:26.060> so<00:02:26.240> maybe<00:02:26.540> they're<00:02:27.080> kind

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
little bit ended so maybe they're kind

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.880 
little bit ended so maybe they're kind
of<00:02:27.440> prepping<00:02:27.920> you<00:02:28.040> for<00:02:28.070> a<00:02:28.580> possible<00:02:29.000> sequel

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
of prepping you for a possible sequel

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.200 
of prepping you for a possible sequel
but<00:02:30.890> I<00:02:30.950> also<00:02:31.250> like<00:02:31.520> the<00:02:31.550> fact<00:02:31.670> that<00:02:31.910> it<00:02:32.090> was

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.210 
but I also like the fact that it was

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:33.580 
but I also like the fact that it was
open-ended<00:02:32.630> and<00:02:32.900> you<00:02:32.960> can<00:02:33.110> kind<00:02:33.260> of<00:02:33.380> make<00:02:33.530> up

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
open-ended and you can kind of make up

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.920 
open-ended and you can kind of make up
