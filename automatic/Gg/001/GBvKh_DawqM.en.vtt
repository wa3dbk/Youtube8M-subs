00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.990 
certainly for the first 45 minutes I'm
disgusted<00:00:39.100> at<00:00:39.190> the<00:00:39.220> effort<00:00:39.549> a<00:00:39.640> player's<00:00:39.940> a

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.000 
disgusted at the effort a player's a

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.910 
disgusted at the effort a player's a
bullet<00:00:40.330> tonight<00:00:43.229> every<00:00:44.229> single<00:00:44.559> one<00:00:44.680> of<00:00:44.710> them

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:44.920 
bullet tonight every single one of them

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.789 
bullet tonight every single one of them
maybe<00:00:45.100> Kieran<00:00:45.519> Bernard<00:00:45.989> who<00:00:46.989> hasn't<00:00:47.320> given

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:47.799 
maybe Kieran Bernard who hasn't given

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:49.799 
maybe Kieran Bernard who hasn't given
Bernard<00:00:48.250> has<00:00:48.879> probably<00:00:49.150> had<00:00:49.269> more<00:00:49.390> stick<00:00:49.659> off

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:49.809 
Bernard has probably had more stick off

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:51.390 
Bernard has probably had more stick off
me<00:00:49.989> and<00:00:50.140> the<00:00:50.199> last<00:00:50.320> couple<00:00:50.559> using<00:00:50.830> anybody<00:00:51.159> I

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:51.400 
me and the last couple using anybody I

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.060 
me and the last couple using anybody I
thought<00:00:51.790> tonight<00:00:51.970> it<00:00:52.239> was<00:00:52.440> it<00:00:53.440> epitomized

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 
thought tonight it was it epitomized

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:55.979 
thought tonight it was it epitomized
what<00:00:54.190> we<00:00:54.430> we<00:00:54.699> think<00:00:54.879> we're<00:00:55.059> about<00:00:55.269> not<00:00:55.809> what

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
what we we think we're about not what

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:57.869 
what we we think we're about not what
the<00:00:56.080> others<00:00:56.290> showed<00:00:56.500> well<00:00:57.430> we'll<00:00:57.610> see<00:00:57.760> what

00:00:57.869 --> 00:00:57.879 
the others showed well we'll see what

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:00.450 
the others showed well we'll see what
changes<00:00:58.210> I<00:00:58.330> can<00:00:58.360> do<00:00:59.070> because<00:01:00.070> I'm<00:01:00.309> not

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
changes I can do because I'm not

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:01.590 
changes I can do because I'm not
watching<00:01:00.790> that<00:01:00.970> I'm<00:01:01.150> not<00:01:01.299> watching<00:01:01.570> that

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
watching that I'm not watching that

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.590 
watching that I'm not watching that
first<00:01:01.839> our<00:01:02.110> performance<00:01:02.589> again<00:01:03.360> and<00:01:04.360> if<00:01:04.449> they

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
first our performance again and if they

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:05.670 
first our performance again and if they
think<00:01:04.659> that's<00:01:04.989> going<00:01:05.199> to<00:01:05.260> be<00:01:05.350> good<00:01:05.470> enough

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
think that's going to be good enough

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:06.660 
think that's going to be good enough
then<00:01:05.890> they<00:01:06.010> may<00:01:06.130> as<00:01:06.189> well<00:01:06.250> go<00:01:06.430> play<00:01:06.610> for

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 
then they may as well go play for

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:07.380 
then they may as well go play for
somebody<00:01:06.880> else

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
somebody else

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:08.640 
somebody else

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.650 
cuz they ain't gonna be good enough for

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:13.590 
cuz they ain't gonna be good enough for
me<00:01:10.439> well<00:01:11.439> now<00:01:11.560> look<00:01:11.740> at<00:01:11.920> the<00:01:12.509> performance<00:01:13.509> of

that<00:01:21.100> bad<00:01:21.399> players<00:01:22.890> we<00:01:23.890> just<00:01:24.159> came<00:01:24.490> out<00:01:24.640> very

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:24.909 
that bad players we just came out very

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:27.749 
that bad players we just came out very
flat<00:01:25.210> first<00:01:25.780> half<00:01:26.130> we<00:01:27.130> didn't<00:01:27.340> look<00:01:27.429> like<00:01:27.490> our

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:27.759 
flat first half we didn't look like our

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:31.200 
flat first half we didn't look like our
selves<00:01:28.679> we<00:01:29.679> weren't<00:01:29.950> high<00:01:30.249> pressing<00:01:30.789> we

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
selves we weren't high pressing we

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:32.730 
selves we weren't high pressing we
always<00:01:31.600> high<00:01:32.020> price<00:01:32.259> because<00:01:32.350> we<00:01:32.560> know<00:01:32.710> that

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
always high price because we know that

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.770 
always high price because we know that
we<00:01:33.460> have<00:01:33.700> to<00:01:33.820> win<00:01:33.909> the<00:01:34.030> ball<00:01:34.210> every<00:01:34.420> single

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
we have to win the ball every single

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.239 
we have to win the ball every single
time<00:01:34.960> because<00:01:35.200> it<00:01:35.350> gives<00:01:35.679> them<00:01:35.770> a<00:01:35.920> chance<00:01:36.189> to

00:01:36.239 --> 00:01:36.249 
time because it gives them a chance to

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:37.950 
time because it gives them a chance to
play<00:01:36.490> and<00:01:36.609> let's<00:01:36.759> transfer<00:01:37.270> them<00:01:37.420> to<00:01:37.450> get<00:01:37.630> in

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
play and let's transfer them to get in

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.279 
play and let's transfer them to get in
behind<00:01:38.560> of<00:01:38.859> us<00:01:38.979> so<00:01:39.249> it<00:01:39.670> was<00:01:39.850> just<00:01:40.140> really<00:01:41.140> bad

00:01:41.279 --> 00:01:41.289 
behind of us so it was just really bad

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:43.950 
behind of us so it was just really bad
first<00:01:41.560> half<00:01:41.829> for<00:01:42.039> us<00:01:42.100> and<00:01:42.399> and<00:01:42.670> coach<00:01:43.539> agent

came<00:01:44.109> in<00:01:44.319> and<00:01:44.560> just<00:01:44.890> swab<00:01:45.390> going<00:01:46.390> into<00:01:46.630> us<00:01:46.749> and

00:01:46.919 --> 00:01:46.929 
came in and just swab going into us and

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:48.450 
came in and just swab going into us and
said<00:01:47.109> this<00:01:47.289> is<00:01:47.469> not<00:01:47.619> this<00:01:47.950> is<00:01:48.009> not<00:01:48.189> how<00:01:48.399> we

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 
said this is not this is not how we

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.599 
said this is not this is not how we
should<00:01:48.549> be<00:01:48.729> playing<00:01:48.939> and<00:01:49.179> I<00:01:50.170> feel<00:01:50.619> like<00:01:50.710> it<00:01:50.920> it

00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:51.609 
should be playing and I feel like it it

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:53.639 
should be playing and I feel like it it
shouldn't<00:01:52.210> take<00:01:52.270> that<00:01:52.539> for<00:01:53.049> us<00:01:53.139> to<00:01:53.409> you<00:01:53.499> know

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:53.649 
shouldn't take that for us to you know

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.940 
I mean that's we don't get balls like
that<00:03:06.910> then<00:03:07.120> you<00:03:07.480> know<00:03:07.570> myself<00:03:07.750> Chinni<00:03:08.260> max
