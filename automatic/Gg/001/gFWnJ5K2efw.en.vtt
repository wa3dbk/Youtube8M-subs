to take this apart and put it back

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.000 
to take this apart and put it back
together<00:00:47.690> is<00:00:48.079> actually<00:00:48.230> just<00:00:48.530> take<00:00:48.739> it<00:00:48.920> apart

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
together is actually just take it apart

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.400 
together is actually just take it apart
piece<00:00:49.910> by<00:00:49.969> piece<00:00:50.180> and<00:00:50.750> put<00:00:51.020> it<00:00:51.050> back<00:00:51.230> together

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
piece by piece and put it back together

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.529 
piece by piece and put it back together
a<00:00:51.710> couple<00:00:51.949> times<00:00:52.340> and<00:00:52.670> maybe<00:00:53.359> I'll<00:00:53.510> even

00:00:53.529 --> 00:00:53.539 
a couple times and maybe I'll even

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:56.500 
a couple times and maybe I'll even
number<00:00:54.109> the<00:00:54.230> pieces<00:00:54.710> to<00:00:55.399> make<00:00:55.879> it<00:00:56.000> like<00:00:56.149> make<00:00:56.480> a

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
number the pieces to make it like make a

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.259 
number the pieces to make it like make a
little<00:00:56.600> more<00:00:56.899> sense<00:00:57.199> and<00:00:57.379> then<00:00:57.500> I<00:00:57.590> can<00:00:58.239> put<00:00:59.239> a

00:00:59.259 --> 00:00:59.269 
little more sense and then I can put a

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:00.910 
little more sense and then I can put a
graphic<00:00:59.600> with<00:00:59.929> the<00:00:59.960> number<00:01:00.320> of<00:01:00.410> pieces<00:01:00.590> on<00:01:00.859> it

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
graphic with the number of pieces on it

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.430 
graphic with the number of pieces on it
also<00:01:01.179> okay<00:01:02.179> with<00:01:02.449> the<00:01:02.600> cube<00:01:02.870> setting<00:01:03.230> here

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:03.440 
also okay with the cube setting here

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.170 
also okay with the cube setting here
I'll<00:01:03.890> show<00:01:04.190> you<00:01:04.250> what<00:01:04.460> the<00:01:04.580> top<00:01:04.759> looks<00:01:05.089> like

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
I'll show you what the top looks like

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.620 
I'll show you what the top looks like
and<00:01:05.600> you<00:01:06.140> can<00:01:06.170> see<00:01:06.530> that<00:01:06.799> this<00:01:07.040> piece<00:01:07.340> is<00:01:07.670> like

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
and you can see that this piece is like

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.090 
and you can see that this piece is like
this<00:01:08.869> and<00:01:09.140> then<00:01:09.229> you've<00:01:09.350> got<00:01:09.500> a<00:01:09.530> u-shaped

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
this and then you've got a u-shaped

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.800 
this and then you've got a u-shaped
piece<00:01:10.310> behind<00:01:10.820> it<00:01:10.970> which<00:01:11.090> is<00:01:11.240> all<00:01:11.390> one<00:01:11.600> piece

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
piece behind it which is all one piece

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.870 
piece behind it which is all one piece
so<00:01:12.110> I'm<00:01:12.680> going<00:01:12.860> to<00:01:12.920> take<00:01:13.070> piece<00:01:13.310> number<00:01:13.340> one

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
so I'm going to take piece number one

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.969 
so I'm going to take piece number one
out<00:01:14.090> and<00:01:14.330> show<00:01:14.390> you<00:01:14.930> what<00:01:15.170> it<00:01:15.259> looks<00:01:15.470> like

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
out and show you what it looks like

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:19.420 
out and show you what it looks like
it's<00:01:16.729> the<00:01:16.970> l-shaped<00:01:17.540> piece<00:01:17.950> with<00:01:18.950> the<00:01:19.130> cube

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
it's the l-shaped piece with the cube

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.899 
it's the l-shaped piece with the cube
glued<00:01:19.759> onto<00:01:20.060> the<00:01:20.720> top<00:01:21.130> so<00:01:22.130> it<00:01:22.280> looks<00:01:22.490> like<00:01:22.549> that

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 
glued onto the top so it looks like that

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:26.380 
glued onto the top so it looks like that
and<00:01:23.240> again<00:01:23.990> it<00:01:24.170> goes<00:01:24.350> in<00:01:24.650> like<00:01:25.159> this<00:01:25.490> with<00:01:26.240> the

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
and again it goes in like this with the

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.370 
and again it goes in like this with the
L<00:01:26.540> in<00:01:26.930> in<00:01:27.650> my<00:01:28.009> case<00:01:28.280> towards<00:01:29.000> the<00:01:29.180> front<00:01:29.479> down

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
L in in my case towards the front down

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.020 
L in in my case towards the front down
like<00:01:30.649> that<00:01:30.829> so<00:01:31.100> we'll<00:01:31.250> take<00:01:31.430> that<00:01:31.610> piece<00:01:31.820> off

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
like that so we'll take that piece off

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.859 
like that so we'll take that piece off
and<00:01:32.270> set<00:01:32.450> it<00:01:32.479> aside

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
and set it aside

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:35.319 
and set it aside
piece<00:01:33.799> number<00:01:33.829> two<00:01:34.430> because<00:01:34.850> we're<00:01:35.119> going<00:01:35.270> to

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:35.329 
piece number two because we're going to

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:38.020 
piece number two because we're going to
call<00:01:35.509> this<00:01:35.720> one<00:01:35.960> and<00:01:36.200> it<00:01:36.829> is<00:01:36.860> the<00:01:37.280> u-shaped

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
call this one and it is the u-shaped

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.670 
call this one and it is the u-shaped
piece<00:01:38.380> with<00:01:39.380> the<00:01:40.060> extra<00:01:41.060> cube<00:01:41.329> glued<00:01:41.750> on<00:01:42.020> to

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
piece with the extra cube glued on to

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.190 
piece with the extra cube glued on to
this<00:01:42.829> end<00:01:43.189> of<00:01:43.369> it<00:01:43.490> so<00:01:43.670> this<00:01:44.240> is<00:01:44.420> the<00:01:44.540> extra<00:01:44.899> cube

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
this end of it so this is the extra cube

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.719 
this end of it so this is the extra cube
that's<00:01:45.350> glued<00:01:45.649> on<00:01:45.890> and<00:01:46.100> this<00:01:46.189> is<00:01:46.399> the<00:01:46.520> flat

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
that's glued on and this is the flat

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:48.819 
that's glued on and this is the flat
shape<00:01:47.030> you<00:01:47.240> and<00:01:47.479> it<00:01:48.079> sets<00:01:48.290> in<00:01:48.439> there<00:01:48.590> just<00:01:48.710> like

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:48.829 
shape you and it sets in there just like

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:51.940 
shape you and it sets in there just like
that<00:01:49.869> okay<00:01:50.869> we'll<00:01:51.079> take<00:01:51.229> that<00:01:51.439> off<00:01:51.590> and<00:01:51.619> set<00:01:51.890> it

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
that okay we'll take that off and set it

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.670 
that okay we'll take that off and set it
aside<00:01:52.420> the<00:01:53.420> next<00:01:53.750> piece<00:01:53.930> that<00:01:53.960> I'll<00:01:54.229> take<00:01:54.469> out

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
aside the next piece that I'll take out

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.190 
aside the next piece that I'll take out
is<00:01:54.890> actually<00:01:55.070> in<00:01:55.399> the<00:01:55.549> back<00:01:55.820> and<00:01:56.210> I'll<00:01:56.780> rotate

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
is actually in the back and I'll rotate

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.840 
is actually in the back and I'll rotate
it<00:01:57.380> one<00:01:57.590> time<00:01:57.799> to<00:01:58.039> show<00:01:58.219> you<00:01:58.280> then<00:01:58.579> I'll<00:01:58.670> bring

three I'm pulling out from the bottom

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:12.920 
three I'm pulling out from the bottom
closest<00:04:12.299> to<00:04:12.480> me

closest to me

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:18.259

it's<00:04:13.680> the<00:04:13.799> l-shaped<00:04:14.370> piece

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:22.969 

he's<00:04:18.870> number<00:04:19.620> four<00:04:20.989> is<00:04:21.989> what<00:04:22.229> I<00:04:22.259> call<00:04:22.560> the<00:04:22.740> Z

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
he's number four is what I call the Z

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:27.980 
he's number four is what I call the Z
piece<00:04:24.289> and<00:04:25.289> piece<00:04:25.919> number<00:04:26.280> five<00:04:26.550> is<00:04:26.940> the<00:04:27.509> only

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
piece and piece number five is the only

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.089 
piece and piece number five is the only
piece<00:04:28.349> that<00:04:28.410> has<00:04:28.919> the<00:04:29.340> two<00:04:29.940> cubes<00:04:30.900> glued<00:04:31.680> to<00:04:31.919> it

00:04:32.089 --> 00:04:32.099 
piece that has the two cubes glued to it

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:34.670 
piece that has the two cubes glued to it
so<00:04:32.699> I<00:04:32.729> always<00:04:33.120> consider<00:04:33.810> that<00:04:33.870> the<00:04:34.139> base<00:04:34.319> piece

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
so I always consider that the base piece

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.960 
so I always consider that the base piece
I<00:04:35.009> put<00:04:35.759> it<00:04:35.910> down<00:04:36.030> first<00:04:37.160> then<00:04:38.160> I<00:04:38.520> come<00:04:38.789> back

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
I put it down first then I come back

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.020 
I put it down first then I come back
with<00:04:39.300> the<00:04:39.479> Z<00:04:39.690> safe<00:04:39.960> shape<00:04:40.349> piece<00:04:40.759> put<00:04:41.759> it<00:04:41.789> right

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
there I take the first l-shaped piece

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:52.159 
there I take the first l-shaped piece
slide<00:04:47.130> it<00:04:47.310> under<00:04:48.259> the<00:04:49.259> u-shaped<00:04:49.860> piece<00:04:51.139> put<00:04:52.139> it
