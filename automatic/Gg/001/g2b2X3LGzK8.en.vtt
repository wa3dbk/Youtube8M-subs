 Brazilian national of the national

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.549
 stress it is already blocking soon 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.830
 Brazilian players and putting it 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.170

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.119
 Brazilian players I can not play 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.780
 the closed beta that starts today 30 of 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.670
 April 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.430
 of course the players who are 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:30.750
 able to play was because they got a 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:33.540
 key is public on a site that has 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:38.909
 key south seven own or do not know 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:40.920
 of a very large layer but is not 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.049
 Good, I do not even know anyone. 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.880
 Could you think I could not think it? 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.950
 A lot of people I know do not 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.590
 got a key and it's already rolling 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.329
 That's where the exclusion is going. 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.479
 of Brazilian players does not 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:56.250
 North American with force because 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.040
 definitely they do not want it 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:02.070
 like it or not it is not thorough player is 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:06.390
 you playing online ball from ebay already 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:08.630
 deceased the next that the devil is right 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.870
 gets closer to the monitor 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:14.570
 The ball rolls in the ugly mahana not one serves 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:17.330
 of the Brazilian of the online cabal that gives 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:22.430
 which suffers now in the roll a raise 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:25.930
 back here with the engineer on the lap 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:28.460
 this is what you gain consult each 20 right 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:31.990
 were not invited to the party of 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:35.570
 closed beta of the trash though 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:37.670
 it turned out 2 does not deserve this hype turno that 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.290
 Brazilian players are giving 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.230
 My opinion does not deserve it. 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.690
 practically a lyon one only with 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.930
 much nicer graphics and style 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:50.180
 half full the shit chapels sos next 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.700
 in forest mutant points iron by 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.500
 least my face in these two maps do not 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.240
 will have because will not have pv have a 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.890
 open world of two factions 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.870
 unless they put in a day 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.420
 think he is but he will not roll 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.790
 debut test everything you've learned 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:08.090
 from online one will be redone for 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:12.080
 a much more based on ip game is that the 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:15.260
 tv channel 2 will be cheaper degrees 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:17.060
 are not you going to fund there the always pt 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.430
 will attend and period 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:22.790
 so I think most of the fans of 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:25.220
 cabal online a sound pvp world fans 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:28.010
 open you're there the ox plan from here 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.330
 the little capella comes to speak of the whore and 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.820
 A gay for her, right? 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:34.790
 I got there I want sport, you never 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:38.470
 I know that this hypothesis is yours and that the 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:41.060
 bang and that's going to be soon 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:46.990
 ask on the side ts do not know my 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:50.030
 brother has an arcane swordsman 17 such 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:52.640
 fiddle in the shoe with know someone 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.140
 my friend, time is on the question and 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.540
 demand to know what liquid the guy 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:59.000
 pass on this mistake then understood 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.980
 because it's bullshit 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.830
 It's no use with her. 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:06.800
 nothing put understood the unique zilÃ¡ todo 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:10.070
 uÃ© is full of symbols that she comes behind 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:12.080
 me but I was're out the right wars 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:14.660
 that had that also does not have 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:17.060
 interesting things you will not have until now 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:18.350
 It seems like it does not and it's been a long time. 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:22.290
 that the game is being published in 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:24.690
 Korea then she is careful 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:27.780
 work with disappoint with channel 2 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:29.700
 do not bother with that hype right 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.710
 in a good pat on the face the idea of 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:34.020
 software you who are seeing this hype 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.930
 all to see that the pump coughs and 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:41.910
 to play even without 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:44.340
 need to stress with is to cross 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:47.190
 beta that is going to have to ballots 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:52.170
 wait for the national version of channel 2 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:55.050
 there is already almost certainly a certainty 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:57.870
 absolute that is going to be released one day who 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:00.330
 Do you know, maybe next year, three 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:02.580
 years in the North American version took 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:06.270
 a time case to now release the version 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:08.670
 of the magic of the face are 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:10.080
 Paul, that's the fucking hell you saw. 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:12.510
 squares play 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:15.090
 I think they're leaving soon after I 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:17.220
 I think they know that the Brazilians 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:20.100
 They want to play that, so they want to spend. 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:21.750
 money a complete online two then 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:24.810
 they have a minimum of intelligence 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:26.850
 they should be releasing the br 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.990
 soon after the official launch of the 

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:29.220
 North American version 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:32.670
 So you're going to have to wait a few 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:35.910
 months there then well that's it 

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:38.300
 khabaronline on 2 is software giving a 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:41.550
 way and easy the Brazilian players 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:44.250
 well the anime honors us today was more 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:46.950
 A heartbreak even because I'm feeling 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:48.930
 in this stop because I wanted to play the 

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:50.520
 club beto is on 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:53.130
 we do it by making the first 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:55.110
 impressions and such but could not find a key 

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:57.540
 No way did I search there for 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:59.790
 see it seems that no one 

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:01.920
 get so if you're playing 

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:03.930
