00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.120
 hello good as you are you 

00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:08.630
 I will teach to play in this kind of 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:11.230
 piano fifth interval 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:14.370
 both the just and increased and 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:16.650
 diminished well 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.840
 At the end of the class I'll tell you how 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.740
 you can get my piano course 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:25.800
 free now we go with this interval if 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.890
 you do not know what a good interval is 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:34.200
 I say that is the distance between 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:37.890
 a musical sound and another technically is 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:40.200
 the tonal distance of one sound and another and 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:45.440
 this translates to the piano in the 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:49.109
 distance between one key to another 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:51.510
 and concretely how in the piano we have 

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:54.660
 from left to right the sounds of 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.839
 serious acute because this results in the 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.659
 distance between a note to the left 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:04.110
 and another to the right then you're going to 

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:07.970
 see more graphically here this is the 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.970
 just fifth interval 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:16.010
 this is a fifth joint interval 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:18.190
 here we have another and here another 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:21.160
 all right 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:24.270
 let's see the just fifth interval 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.270
 of two sun 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.899
 what is that 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:33.710
 being fifth means there are five 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:35.780
 notes between the opening note or the 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:40.689
 opening key on the closing key 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:45.759
 both included then we have a two 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:45.759
 three four and five 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:55.080
 then in terms of tones and halftones 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.790
 tell you that a fair fifth has three 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:05.330
 tones and a half then we have a tone 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:11.210
 another two tone tone not now half tone 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:11.210
 two and a half tones and finally a tone 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:20.880
 three and a half shades well this is fifth 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:24.570
 fair and if we raise the closing note that 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:29.130
 is this in our case sun and we raise it 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:32.100
 medium tone to sustained sun we have a 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.620
 fifth augmented 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:37.580
 two 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:40.760
 that's a fifth augmented now if the 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:44.230
 closing note of the fifth just you 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.230
 we go down half tone 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:51.990
 we have a fifth diminished 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:56.280
 ah 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:58.530
 well you can build that from 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.680
 any piano key just stay 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:04.590
 with that from the opening note the 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.680
 close there are three and a half shades and that 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.840
 going up the closing half tone we have 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:13.620
 increased and lowering half tone we have 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:16.890
 diminished and nothing 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.989
 You can use this link to get off 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.870
