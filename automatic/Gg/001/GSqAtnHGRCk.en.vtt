 robotic arm project 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:25.630
 a robotic arm is a type of arm 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.670
 mechanically normally programmable with 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.370
 functions similar to those of an arm 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:33.040
 human this can be the sum total of 

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:35.980
 mechanism or can be part of a robot 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.800
 more complex the parts of these 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.489
 manipulators or arms are 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.550
 interconnected through 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:45.250
 joints that allow both a 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:47.590
 rotational movement such as those of 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.830
 an articulated robot as a movement 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:52.930
 transnational or linear displacement in 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:55.150
 the case of this arm the source of 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.760
 movement in your joints is a 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:00.579
 through servomotors a servomotor 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:03.460
 also called servo is a device 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:05.710
 similar to a DC motor 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.170
 that has the ability to be located in 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:11.050
 any position within its range of 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.790
 operation and stay stable in said 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.670
 position 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.440
 A servomotor is an electric motor that 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.750
 It has the ability to be 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.180
 controlled both in speed and in 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:26.140
 position 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:28.900
 the microcontroller at mega 328 in the 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.580
 Arduino card is responsible for 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.770
 feed the signals for 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.930
 servomotors while they are 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.540
 powered with a voltage source 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.729
 externally, each servomotor has a 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.930
 current consumption which can not 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:45.750
 feed alone in harbin 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.150
 when using servomotors you have a great 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.910
 control in the robot with movements 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.880
 pretty constant and soft to say it 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:55.159
 somehow 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.229
 it was decided to make the frame of the arm 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:00.510
 of wood since it is a material 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:03.630
 lightweight and easy to maneuver 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:06.210
 going back to the trees every servo has 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:09.479
 certain torque capacity this is the 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:12.000
 force that this ability can apply 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.750
 is based on the type of gear that 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.750
 has the servomotor 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:22.840
 at its base it has a servomotor of 11 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.970
 kilograms per square centimeter 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.450
 is the one who has to support the weight of 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:31.420
 the entire arm the adjoining servomotor of 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:34.180
 bottom up shoulder is 6 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.040
 kilograms per centimeter squared as 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.200
 although it will not carry so much weight so 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.390
 remaining arm if you have to endure 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.450
 certain torque when holding in position 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.310
 horizontal the arm after there is a 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.070
 servomotor of 4 kilograms per 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.110
 square centimeter this the only thing that 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:53.080
 is to position the earl grip on a 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.760
 determined place and finally a 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.250
 servomotor one kilogram per 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.800
 square centimeter that makes certain 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:03.270
 pressure between the clamp or flu element 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.270
 end to take objects 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:10.459
 there are many utilities that can be 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:12.890
 give an arm of this style since 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:15.290
 allows to replace the maneuver with 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:18.230
 dangerous objects with the hands of a 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:22.269
 human, speeding up work and 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.269
 keeping a lot of safety margin 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:29.440
 this is the industrial future in the 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:31.960
 already present chains of 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:35.050
 fully automated production 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:37.930
 for this kind of robots apart from being 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:41.070
 an interesting subject is an excellent 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:44.840
 work bet so much for the design 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:47.810
 installation and constant maintenance 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:50.680
 with the law encouraging development 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.680
 technological
