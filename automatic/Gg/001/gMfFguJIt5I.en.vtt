to<00:02:36.390> the<00:02:36.569> point<00:02:36.810> where<00:02:36.930> they<00:02:37.019> were<00:02:37.079> in<00:02:37.200> the

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
to the point where they were in the

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.050 
to the point where they were in the
negatives<00:02:37.769> and<00:02:37.950> then<00:02:38.310> they<00:02:38.430> would<00:02:38.579> party<00:02:38.970> up

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
negatives and then they would party up

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.789 
negatives and then they would party up
with<00:02:39.209> less<00:02:39.450> talented<00:02:39.930> players<00:02:40.230> and<00:02:40.349> begin<00:02:40.769> to

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
with less talented players and begin to

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:42.470 
with less talented players and begin to
win<00:02:41.129> therefore<00:02:41.849> the<00:02:41.970> game<00:02:42.120> would<00:02:42.209> think<00:02:42.420> that

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
win therefore the game would think that

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.449 
win therefore the game would think that
the<00:02:42.629> less<00:02:43.079> talented<00:02:43.530> players<00:02:43.769> were<00:02:44.040> carrying

the less talented players were carrying

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.220 
the less talented players were carrying
the<00:02:44.549> talented<00:02:45.090> players<00:02:45.329> and<00:02:45.450> they<00:02:45.959> would<00:02:46.109> give

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
the talented players and they would give

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.800 
the talented players and they would give
them<00:02:46.410> ranks<00:02:46.709> easier<00:02:47.069> so<00:02:48.000> my<00:02:48.239> question<00:02:48.599> for<00:02:48.629> you

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
them ranks easier so my question for you

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.059 
them ranks easier so my question for you
guys<00:02:48.959> is<00:02:49.140> what<00:02:49.170> do<00:02:49.410> you<00:02:49.470> think<00:02:49.709> about<00:02:49.829> all<00:02:49.950> this

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
guys is what do you think about all this

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:51.319 
guys is what do you think about all this
do<00:02:50.340> you<00:02:50.430> think<00:02:50.640> that<00:02:50.730> there<00:02:50.849> should<00:02:51.120> be<00:02:51.299> a

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
do you think that there should be a

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:53.690 
do you think that there should be a
skill-based<00:02:51.750> ranking<00:02:52.410> system<00:02:52.769> in<00:02:52.950> Halo<00:02:53.430> 5

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
skill-based ranking system in Halo 5

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.789 
skill-based ranking system in Halo 5
where<00:02:54.000> we<00:02:54.150> can<00:02:54.390> see<00:02:54.720> people's<00:02:55.170> skill<00:02:55.470> ratings

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
where we can see people's skill ratings

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:57.199 
where we can see people's skill ratings
in<00:02:55.950> game<00:02:56.280> and<00:02:56.459> we<00:02:56.549> don't<00:02:56.640> have<00:02:56.760> to<00:02:56.879> visit<00:02:56.910> a

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
in game and we don't have to visit a

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:58.789 
in game and we don't have to visit a
website<00:02:57.420> to<00:02:57.750> see<00:02:57.900> it<00:02:58.019> or<00:02:58.349> do<00:02:58.530> you<00:02:58.590> think<00:02:58.739> we

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
website to see it or do you think we

00:02:58.799 --> 00:02:59.930 
website to see it or do you think we
should<00:02:58.920> just<00:02:58.950> stick<00:02:59.220> with<00:02:59.400> the<00:02:59.489> halo<00:02:59.670> 4

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
should just stick with the halo 4

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.339 
should just stick with the halo 4
approach<00:03:00.239> where<00:03:00.480> you<00:03:00.569> just<00:03:00.720> get<00:03:00.900> experience

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
approach where you just get experience

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:03.470 
approach where you just get experience
and<00:03:01.500> that's<00:03:01.620> it<00:03:01.799> as<00:03:02.459> always<00:03:02.879> let<00:03:03.090> me<00:03:03.120> know<00:03:03.329> in
