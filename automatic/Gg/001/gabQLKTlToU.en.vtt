and it's great experience and then the

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:05.340 
and it's great experience and then the
curtain<00:02:04.540> comes<00:02:04.720> down<00:02:04.810> and<00:02:05.050> you're<00:02:05.140> still

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
curtain comes down and you're still

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:06.630
