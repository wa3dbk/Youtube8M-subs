00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.840 
you don't need a really really long
cable<00:02:00.119> on<00:02:00.240> this<00:02:00.930> one<00:02:01.140> is<00:02:01.380> a<00:02:01.409> four<00:02:01.920> foot<00:02:02.130> cable

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
cable on this one is a four foot cable

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.060 
cable on this one is a four foot cable
so<00:02:03.000> it's<00:02:03.119> not<00:02:03.240> too<00:02:03.450> long<00:02:03.600> I'm<00:02:03.840> it's<00:02:04.320> just<00:02:04.530> long

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
so it's not too long I'm it's just long

so it's not too long I'm it's just long
enough<00:02:05.130> I<00:02:05.610> mean<00:02:06.149> it's<00:02:06.299> thin<00:02:06.479> it's<00:02:06.659> smaller

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
enough I mean it's thin it's smaller

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.190
