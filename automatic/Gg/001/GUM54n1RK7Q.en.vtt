all<00:00:24.090> anymore<00:00:24.390> but<00:00:25.019> I<00:00:25.050> thought<00:00:25.410> it<00:00:25.529> would<00:00:25.650> be<00:00:25.800> a

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
all anymore but I thought it would be a

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.160 
all anymore but I thought it would be a
good<00:00:25.980> idea<00:00:26.070> to<00:00:26.250> share<00:00:26.519> it<00:00:26.670> anyway<00:00:27.060> and<00:00:27.210> well

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
good idea to share it anyway and well

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.589 
good idea to share it anyway and well
you<00:00:28.439> can<00:00:28.680> use<00:00:29.429> a<00:00:29.460> little<00:00:29.599> transformation

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
you can use a little transformation

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.900
