so<00:01:30.390> you<00:01:31.260> know<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.500> idea<00:01:31.530> is<00:01:31.860> you<00:01:31.950> stock

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:32.160 
so you know the idea is you stock

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.280 
so you know the idea is you stock
millions<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.820> get<00:01:33.000> you<00:01:33.480> know<00:01:33.570> thousands<00:01:34.050> back
