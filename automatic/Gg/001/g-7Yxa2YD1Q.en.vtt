hold<00:00:44.190> W<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:44.969> get<00:00:45.090> into<00:00:45.300> place<00:00:45.510> where<00:00:45.750> this

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
hold W to get into place where this

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.209 
hold W to get into place where this
appears<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.379> it<00:00:46.469> becomes<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.770> clean<00:00:46.980> line<00:00:47.190> a

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
appears and it becomes a clean line a

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.540 
appears and it becomes a clean line a
bit<00:00:47.460> like<00:00:47.610> this<00:00:48.649> we<00:00:49.649> do<00:00:49.770> is<00:00:49.890> you<00:00:50.070> rotate<00:00:50.250> around

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
bit like this we do is you rotate around

will<00:00:56.309> get<00:00:56.610> a<00:00:56.640> dart<00:00:57.239> because<00:00:57.600> all<00:00:57.840> to<00:00:58.559> see<00:01:01.190> you

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
will get a dart because all to see you

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.650 
will get a dart because all to see you
want<00:01:02.340> to<00:01:02.399> imagine<00:01:02.640> you<00:01:02.699> have<00:01:02.789> a<00:01:02.820> dart<00:01:03.149> or<00:01:03.300> even

easier<00:01:05.100> you're<00:01:05.519> in<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:05.640> place<00:01:05.850> to<00:01:06.030> smoke<00:01:06.360> above

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
easier you're in a place to smoke above

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.310 
easier you're in a place to smoke above
this<00:01:07.229> like<00:01:07.530> dark<00:01:07.920> pixel<00:01:08.460> here<00:01:09.020> there's<00:01:10.020> no<00:01:10.200> if

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
this like dark pixel here there's no if

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.140 
this like dark pixel here there's no if
you<00:01:10.380> can<00:01:10.500> see<00:01:10.619> old<00:01:10.770> shooter<00:01:11.070> there's<00:01:11.729> a<00:01:11.820> few

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
you can see old shooter there's a few

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.690 
you can see old shooter there's a few
pixels<00:01:12.510> here<00:01:12.780> this<00:01:13.409> is<00:01:13.530> about<00:01:13.650> abouts<00:01:14.310> in<00:01:14.549> the

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
pixels here this is about abouts in the

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.330 
pixels here this is about abouts in the
middle<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:15.470> above<00:01:16.470> this<00:01:16.740> you<00:01:17.040> want<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.220> hold

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
middle and above this you want to hold

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.850 
middle and above this you want to hold
your<00:01:17.549> crosshair<00:01:17.939> on<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.180> tip<00:01:18.590> when<00:01:19.590> I<00:01:19.650> pull

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
your crosshair on the tip when I pull

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.590 
your crosshair on the tip when I pull
the<00:01:19.979> grenade<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.520> you<00:01:20.880> simply<00:01:21.119> throw<00:01:21.479> it

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
the grenade and you simply throw it

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.080 
the grenade and you simply throw it
without<00:01:22.110> jumping<00:01:22.409> or<00:01:22.830> anything<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.820> smoke

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
without jumping or anything the smoke

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.200 
without jumping or anything the smoke
will<00:01:24.299> take<00:01:24.509> a<00:01:24.689> bounce<00:01:25.020> off<00:01:25.320> this<00:01:25.619> wall<00:01:25.890> here

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
will take a bounce off this wall here

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.200 
will take a bounce off this wall here
and<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:27.570> will<00:01:27.720> land<00:01:27.930> straight<00:01:28.650> over<00:01:28.829> here

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
and it will land straight over here

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.190 
and it will land straight over here
covering<00:01:30.210> off<00:01:30.420> all<00:01:30.750> almost<00:01:31.140> all<00:01:31.530> of<00:01:31.799> this<00:01:31.920> area

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
covering off all almost all of this area

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.380 
covering off all almost all of this area
um<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.829> only<00:01:34.950> bad<00:01:35.130> thing<00:01:35.159> is<00:01:35.369> that<00:01:35.490> need<00:01:36.119> this

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
um the only bad thing is that need this

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.149 
um the only bad thing is that need this
but<00:01:36.689> this<00:01:36.900> is<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.170> only<00:01:37.290> spot<00:01:37.619> that<00:01:37.860> a<00:01:37.890> sniper

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
but this is the only spot that a sniper

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.910 
but this is the only spot that a sniper
can<00:01:38.490> peek<00:01:38.759> through<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.810> possibly<00:01:40.320> get<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:40.560> peek

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
can peek through to possibly get a peek

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.010 
can peek through to possibly get a peek
if<00:01:41.159> he's<00:01:41.400> playing<00:01:41.610> jungle<00:01:42.090> after<00:01:42.270> a<00:01:42.450> rotation

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
if he's playing jungle after a rotation

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.990 
if he's playing jungle after a rotation
and<00:01:43.200> it's<00:01:43.530> been<00:01:43.740> caught<00:01:43.920> up<00:01:43.950> if<00:01:44.340> it's<00:01:44.460> assisted

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
and it's been caught up if it's assisted

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.749 
and it's been caught up if it's assisted
this<00:01:45.119> mode<00:01:45.390> by<00:01:45.750> a<00:01:45.780> jungle<00:01:46.290> smoke<00:01:46.500> it's<00:01:47.369> not<00:01:47.579> the

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
this mode by a jungle smoke it's not the

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.850 
this mode by a jungle smoke it's not the
slipper<00:01:48.240> will<00:01:48.720> probably<00:01:49.079> not<00:01:49.200> be<00:01:49.229> able<00:01:49.439> to<00:01:49.590> see

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.800 
slipper will probably not be able to see
I<00:01:50.159> suppose<00:01:50.579> he'll<00:01:50.759> be<00:01:50.880> in<00:01:51.149> an<00:01:51.240> uncomfortable

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
I suppose he'll be in an uncomfortable
