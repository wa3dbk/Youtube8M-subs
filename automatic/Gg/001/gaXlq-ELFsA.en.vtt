00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
two devices yes so the the first thing

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.740 
two devices yes so the the first thing
to<00:00:13.259> notice<00:00:13.469> is<00:00:13.769> that<00:00:13.830> the<00:00:14.759> picture<00:00:15.450> is<00:00:15.480> much

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
to notice is that the picture is much

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.990 
to notice is that the picture is much
more<00:00:15.990> vivid<00:00:16.289> and<00:00:16.710> there's<00:00:17.160> a<00:00:17.220> higher<00:00:17.430> contrast

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
more vivid and there's a higher contrast

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.390 
more vivid and there's a higher contrast
on<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.600> actual<00:00:18.869> EVO<00:00:19.199> 4G<00:00:19.770> so<00:00:20.130> here<00:00:20.279> in<00:00:20.340> the

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
on the actual EVO 4G so here in the

on the actual EVO 4G so here in the
center<00:00:20.640> we've<00:00:20.789> got<00:00:21.029> the<00:00:21.300> droid<00:00:21.539> we<00:00:21.930> can

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
center we've got the droid we can

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.510 
center we've got the droid we can
standard<00:00:22.380> definition<00:00:22.890> then<00:00:23.189> on<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.340> other

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:24.520

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.040 
we've got the higher quality video and
if<00:00:27.640> you<00:00:27.700> do<00:00:27.880> a<00:00:27.910> side-by-side<00:00:28.240> you<00:00:28.750> can<00:00:28.900> really

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:29.050 
if you do a side-by-side you can really

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.700 
if you do a side-by-side you can really
tell<00:00:29.290> the<00:00:29.440> difference

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.010 

we<00:00:32.250> notice<00:00:32.610> there's<00:00:32.820> a<00:00:32.910> big<00:00:33.480> quality

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
we notice there's a big quality

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.630 
we notice there's a big quality
difference<00:00:34.170> between<00:00:34.739> high<00:00:34.950> quality<00:00:35.430> content

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
difference between high quality content

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.479 
difference between high quality content
and<00:00:36.360> standard<00:00:36.750> quality<00:00:36.960> content<00:00:37.770> typically

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
and standard quality content typically

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:39.650 
and standard quality content typically
the<00:00:38.670> only<00:00:38.879> way<00:00:38.969> that<00:00:39.120> you<00:00:39.210> can<00:00:39.239> take<00:00:39.540> advantage

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
the only way that you can take advantage

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.509 
the only way that you can take advantage
