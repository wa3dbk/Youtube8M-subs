two<00:00:45.930> rounds<00:00:47.120> that's<00:00:48.120> well<00:00:48.650> self<00:00:49.650> interact

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
two rounds that's well self interact

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.750 
two rounds that's well self interact
with<00:00:50.250> myself<00:00:50.930> using<00:00:51.930> my<00:00:52.230> own<00:00:52.560> key<00:00:53.310> which<00:00:53.730> she

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
with myself using my own key which she

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.930 
with myself using my own key which she
can<00:00:54.360> be<00:00:54.510> defined<00:00:54.810> by<00:00:55.020> a<00:00:55.140> settings<00:00:55.940> originally

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
can be defined by a settings originally

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.850 
can be defined by a settings originally
I<00:00:56.970> think<00:00:57.240> it's<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.510> application<00:00:58.110> key<00:00:58.260> it's<00:00:58.740> on

00:00:58.850 --> 00:00:58.860 
I think it's the application key it's on

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.450 
I think it's the application key it's on
a<00:00:59.190> right<00:00:59.850> side<00:01:00.150> of<00:01:00.390> your<00:01:00.570> spacebar<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:01.460> let's

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
a right side of your spacebar and let's

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.219 
a right side of your spacebar and let's
confirm<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.030> deployment<00:01:03.480> speed<00:01:03.810> up<00:01:03.960> and

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
confirm the deployment speed up and

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:10.249 
confirm the deployment speed up and
basically<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.500> 50<00:01:07.920> Cal<00:01:08.130> is<00:01:08.659> machine-gun<00:01:09.659> very

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:10.259 
basically the 50 Cal is machine-gun very

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:12.800 
basically the 50 Cal is machine-gun very
heavy<00:01:10.500> machine<00:01:10.859> gun<00:01:11.009> and<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.759> breaks<00:01:12.659> through

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
heavy machine gun and it breaks through

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.179 
heavy machine gun and it breaks through
most<00:01:13.229> things<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:14.899> it's<00:01:15.899> a<00:01:15.990> very<00:01:16.259> very<00:01:16.590> nice

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
most things and it's a very very nice

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.819 
most things and it's a very very nice
gun<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.670> shoot<00:01:17.700> so<00:01:18.509> mount<00:01:18.810> a<00:01:18.990> weapon<00:01:19.289> using<00:01:19.740> the

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:19.829 
gun to shoot so mount a weapon using the

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:24.679 
gun to shoot so mount a weapon using the
same<00:01:20.009> interaction<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:22.340> Lego<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.969> m2's<00:01:24.450> up

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
same interaction and Lego the m2's up

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.989 
same interaction and Lego the m2's up

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:41.539 
way we get more amble to shoot with and
I'm<00:01:39.869> gonna<00:01:40.020> fire<00:01:40.350> at<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.710> suitable<00:01:41.310> target

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
I'm gonna fire at the suitable target

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.410 
I'm gonna fire at the suitable target
downrange<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:43.549> we<00:01:44.549> have<00:01:44.670> three<00:01:44.880> targets<00:01:45.299> we

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
downrange and we have three targets we

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.469 
downrange and we have three targets we
have<00:01:45.569> a<00:01:45.600> gas<00:01:45.840> which<00:01:46.319> is<00:01:46.350> an<00:01:46.759> armored<00:01:47.759> likely

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
have a gas which is an armored likely

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.719 
have a gas which is an armored likely
very<00:01:48.749> likely<00:01:49.079> armed<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:49.679> PC<00:01:50.189> type<00:01:50.520> of

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
very likely armed and a PC type of

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.169 
very likely armed and a PC type of
vehicle<00:01:51.539> it's<00:01:51.929> not<00:01:52.170> a<00:01:52.229> car<00:01:52.619> it<00:01:53.310> is<00:01:53.460> armed<00:01:53.939> and

00:01:54.169 --> 00:01:54.179 
vehicle it's not a car it is armed and

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:56.779 
vehicle it's not a car it is armed and
that's<00:01:54.929> why<00:01:55.170> it's<00:01:55.409> not<00:01:55.859> fit<00:01:56.100> for<00:01:56.130> that<00:01:56.429> but

00:01:56.779 --> 00:01:56.789 
that's why it's not fit for that but

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:59.149 
that's why it's not fit for that but
there's<00:01:57.030> a<00:01:57.119> truck<00:01:57.539> down<00:01:57.780> there<00:01:57.990> and<00:01:58.200> that's<00:01:58.859> a

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
there's a truck down there and that's a

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:04.129 
there's a truck down there and that's a
perfect<00:01:59.880> target<00:02:00.030> for<00:02:00.420> our<00:02:01.249> m2<00:02:02.249> machine<00:02:02.429> gun<00:02:03.139> so

00:02:04.129 --> 00:02:04.139 
perfect target for our m2 machine gun so

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:21.210 
perfect target for our m2 machine gun so
let's<00:02:04.619> have<00:02:04.979> fun

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.280 

and<00:02:22.220> there<00:02:22.370> you<00:02:22.459> go<00:02:22.580> it's<00:02:22.760> burning<00:02:23.120> that's<00:02:24.110> the

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
and there you go it's burning that's the

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.520 
and there you go it's burning that's the
m2<00:02:24.620> and<00:02:24.650> how<00:02:25.040> to<00:02:25.099> use<00:02:25.519> it<00:02:25.700> with<00:02:26.360> crew<00:02:26.989> bug

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
m2 and how to use it with crew bug

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.220 
m2 and how to use it with crew bug
caused<00:02:27.860> one<00:02:28.250> crew<00:02:28.550> member<00:02:28.580> would<00:02:29.060> be<00:02:29.330> say

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
caused one crew member would be say

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.259 
caused one crew member would be say
shooting<00:02:30.860> one<00:02:31.130> would<00:02:31.310> reloading<00:02:31.880> so<00:02:32.120> it's

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:32.269 
shooting one would reloading so it's

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:34.630 
shooting one would reloading so it's
quicker<00:02:32.989> than<00:02:33.230> me<00:02:33.590> just<00:02:34.040> running<00:02:34.459> around

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
quicker than me just running around

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.660 
quicker than me just running around
trying<00:02:35.000> to<00:02:35.180> do<00:02:35.420> this<00:02:35.569> myself<00:02:35.840> and<00:02:36.590> they're<00:02:37.519> the

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
trying to do this myself and they're the

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.500 
trying to do this myself and they're the
same<00:02:37.819> thing<00:02:37.880> I'll<00:02:38.239> deploy<00:02:38.660> detroit<00:02:39.110> border

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
same thing I'll deploy detroit border

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.100 
same thing I'll deploy detroit border
with<00:02:41.510> the<00:02:41.630> mark-19<00:02:42.080> and<00:02:43.239> basically<00:02:44.239> its<00:02:44.450> exact

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
with the mark-19 and basically its exact

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.580 
with the mark-19 and basically its exact
same<00:02:45.349> thing<00:02:45.650> except<00:02:46.310> it's<00:02:46.489> well<00:02:47.590> another

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
same thing except it's well another

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.420 
same thing except it's well another
weapon<00:02:48.830> and<00:02:49.160> all<00:02:50.090> these<00:02:50.299> things<00:02:50.360> are<00:02:51.430> exact

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
weapon and all these things are exact

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.789 
weapon and all these things are exact
same<00:02:52.670> they<00:02:52.910> csw<00:02:53.569> is<00:02:53.660> pretty<00:02:53.870> simple<00:02:54.170> when<00:02:54.739> you

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:54.799 
same they csw is pretty simple when you

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:57.430 
same they csw is pretty simple when you
load<00:02:55.040> one<00:02:55.069> side<00:02:55.580> the<00:02:56.150> other<00:02:56.180> side<00:02:56.390> you<00:02:57.290> can

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
load one side the other side you can

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.710 
load one side the other side you can
learn<00:02:57.620> the<00:02:58.340> other<00:02:58.459> stuff<00:02:58.700> but<00:02:59.360> it's

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
learn the other stuff but it's

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.630 
learn the other stuff but it's
difference<00:03:00.200> in<00:03:00.349> the<00:03:00.470> 60<00:03:00.860> millimeter<00:03:01.190> mortars

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
difference in the 60 millimeter mortars

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.120 
difference in the 60 millimeter mortars
and<00:03:01.880> then<00:03:02.120> those<00:03:02.540> weapons<00:03:02.780> and<00:03:03.200> that's<00:03:03.920> not

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
and then those weapons and that's not

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:05.170 
and then those weapons and that's not
something<00:03:04.549> I'm<00:03:04.819> going<00:03:04.910> to<00:03:05.030> walk<00:03:05.150> through

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
something I'm going to walk through

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.979 
something I'm going to walk through
today<00:03:05.569> but<00:03:06.349> i<00:03:06.380> will<00:03:06.739> add<00:03:07.670> it<00:03:07.730> eventually<00:03:08.480> and

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
today but i will add it eventually and

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:12.400 
today but i will add it eventually and

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
my editing or my tutorials here on

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.229 
my editing or my tutorials here on
youtube<00:03:12.799> and<00:03:13.150> link<00:03:14.150> again<00:03:14.600> to<00:03:14.930> bounce<00:03:16.239> and

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:20.800 
youtube and link again to bounce and
we're<00:03:17.329> going<00:03:17.450> to<00:03:17.480> fire<00:03:17.660> on<00:03:17.780> that<00:03:17.870> gas<00:03:18.370> so<00:03:19.810> no

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
we're going to fire on that gas so no

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.629 
we're going to fire on that gas so no
wait<00:03:21.019> it's<00:03:21.200> not<00:03:21.319> gas<00:03:21.530> it's<00:03:21.799> from<00:03:21.980> vodník<00:03:22.430> i

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:22.639 
wait it's not gas it's from vodník i

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:26.410 
wait it's not gas it's from vodník i
think<00:03:22.910> yeah<00:03:23.720> it's<00:03:23.900> a<00:03:23.959> vodník<00:03:25.120> right<00:03:26.120> so<00:03:26.299> we

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
think yeah it's a vodník right so we

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.099 
think yeah it's a vodník right so we
have<00:03:28.060> target<00:03:29.060> downrange<00:03:29.239> so<00:03:29.569> that's<00:03:29.690> fire<00:03:29.930> off

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:30.109 
have target downrange so that's fire off

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:43.920 
have target downrange so that's fire off
one<00:03:30.319> run<00:03:33.130> pretty<00:03:34.130> accurate

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:51.410 

oh<00:03:47.730> it<00:03:48.730> was<00:03:48.909> enough<00:03:49.209> firepower<00:03:49.510> to<00:03:49.870> blow<00:03:50.260> that

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
oh it was enough firepower to blow that

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.679 
oh it was enough firepower to blow that
leather<00:03:52.420> armored<00:03:53.349> car<00:03:53.650> up<00:03:53.890> that's<00:03:54.760> nice<00:03:55.000> so

00:03:55.679 --> 00:03:55.689 
leather armored car up that's nice so

00:03:55.689 --> 00:03:58.170 
leather armored car up that's nice so
lost<00:03:56.049> but<00:03:56.290> not<00:03:56.439> least<00:03:56.829> well<00:03:57.430> it's<00:03:57.670> lasting

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
lost but not least well it's lasting

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.229 
lost but not least well it's lasting
biggest<00:03:58.629> the<00:03:58.989> top<00:03:59.170> launcher<00:03:59.530> itself<00:03:59.969> this<00:04:00.969> is

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
biggest the top launcher itself this is

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:05.280 
biggest the top launcher itself this is
something<00:04:01.629> that<00:04:01.870> waits<00:04:02.799> a<00:04:02.980> lot<00:04:03.549> and<00:04:04.290> it's

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
something that waits a lot and it's

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:06.780 
something that waits a lot and it's
going<00:04:05.439> to<00:04:05.560> be<00:04:05.650> a<00:04:05.680> pain<00:04:06.040> in<00:04:06.219> the<00:04:06.250> ass<00:04:06.430> from<00:04:06.639> the

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
going to be a pain in the ass from the

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.500 
going to be a pain in the ass from the
one<00:04:06.969> has<00:04:07.900> Kari<00:04:08.379> it<00:04:08.819> you<00:04:09.819> of<00:04:09.909> course<00:04:10.060> split<00:04:10.389> this

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
one has Kari it you of course split this

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.369 
one has Kari it you of course split this
up<00:04:10.569> into<00:04:10.750> teams<00:04:11.409> a<00:04:11.709> one<00:04:12.430> carrying<00:04:12.909> ammo<00:04:13.379> one

00:04:14.369 --> 00:04:14.379 
up into teams a one carrying ammo one

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:18.150 
up into teams a one carrying ammo one
carrying<00:04:14.950> the<00:04:15.539> m3<00:04:16.539> tripod<00:04:17.320> and<00:04:17.560> one<00:04:17.769> carrying

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
carrying the m3 tripod and one carrying

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.439 
carrying the m3 tripod and one carrying
the<00:04:18.220> actual<00:04:18.849> toe<00:04:19.060> and<00:04:19.299> then<00:04:20.229> well<00:04:21.160> it<00:04:22.030> takes<00:04:22.270> a

00:04:22.439 --> 00:04:22.449 
the actual toe and then well it takes a

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:25.080 
the actual toe and then well it takes a
lot<00:04:22.720> to<00:04:22.990> actually<00:04:23.979> use<00:04:24.160> this<00:04:24.370> thing<00:04:24.610> but<00:04:24.910> it's

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
lot to actually use this thing but it's

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:29.159 
lot to actually use this thing but it's
very<00:04:25.210> accurate<00:04:25.479> and<00:04:25.750> take<00:04:25.900> down<00:04:26.080> tanks<00:04:27.990> it<00:04:28.990> is

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:29.169 
very accurate and take down tanks it is

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:31.290 
very accurate and take down tanks it is
a<00:04:29.199> toll<00:04:29.500> launcher<00:04:29.919> so<00:04:30.430> it's<00:04:30.699> kind<00:04:30.940> of<00:04:31.000> accurate

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
a toll launcher so it's kind of accurate

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.510 
a toll launcher so it's kind of accurate
and<00:04:31.479> then<00:04:31.690> I<00:04:31.930> recommend<00:04:32.889> using<00:04:33.039> this<00:04:33.310> for

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
and then I recommend using this for

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.360 
and then I recommend using this for
defensive<00:04:34.090> purposes<00:04:34.120> it's<00:04:35.050> not<00:04:35.199> very<00:04:35.259> fast<00:04:35.979> as

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
defensive purposes it's not very fast as

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:37.800 
defensive purposes it's not very fast as
you<00:04:36.789> can<00:04:36.910> see<00:04:37.060> right<00:04:37.090> now<00:04:37.270> i'm<00:04:37.419> speeding<00:04:37.660> up

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
you can see right now i'm speeding up

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.270 
you can see right now i'm speeding up
with<00:04:37.990> four<00:04:38.289> times<00:04:38.620> and<00:04:38.949> it<00:04:39.190> takes<00:04:39.400> while<00:04:40.300> still

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
with four times and it takes while still

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.920 
with four times and it takes while still
right<00:04:42.280> so<00:04:42.430> let's<00:04:42.610> load<00:04:42.820> it<00:04:42.849> this<00:04:43.509> time<00:04:43.539> we

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
right so let's load it this time we

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:46.740 
right so let's load it this time we
cannot<00:04:44.139> link<00:04:44.530> the<00:04:45.190> and<00:04:46.030> we're<00:04:46.240> together<00:04:46.389> of

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750 
cannot link the and we're together of

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.260 
cannot link the and we're together of
course<00:04:46.930> because<00:04:47.229> it's<00:04:47.380> two<00:04:47.650> different

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
course because it's two different

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.600 
course because it's two different
missiles<00:04:49.270> and<00:04:49.650> let's<00:04:50.650> speed<00:04:50.919> this<00:04:50.949> up<00:04:51.340> and

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610 
missiles and let's speed this up and

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.379 
missiles and let's speed this up and
we'll<00:04:52.030> use<00:04:52.090> this<00:04:52.510> and<00:04:53.460> have<00:04:54.460> some<00:04:54.699> fun<00:04:54.909> the<00:04:55.240> tow

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:55.389 
we'll use this and have some fun the tow

00:04:55.389 --> 00:05:00.360 
we'll use this and have some fun the tow
launcher<00:04:55.750> is<00:04:55.930> a<00:04:56.430> guided<00:04:57.430> by<00:04:57.550> wires<00:04:57.849> so<00:04:59.099> the<00:05:00.099> yet

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
launcher is a guided by wires so the yet

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.110 
launcher is a guided by wires so the yet
missile<00:05:01.180> will<00:05:01.360> go<00:05:01.510> where<00:05:01.780> we<00:05:01.900> point<00:05:02.169> it<00:05:03.120> look

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
missile will go where we point it look

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.689 
missile will go where we point it look
down<00:05:04.270> the<00:05:04.419> sides<00:05:04.740> zoom<00:05:05.740> in<00:05:05.979> a<00:05:06.010> little<00:05:06.190> bit<00:05:06.370> that

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:06.699 
down the sides zoom in a little bit that

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:11.850 
down the sides zoom in a little bit that
doesn't<00:05:07.090> work<00:05:08.280> we<00:05:09.280> can<00:05:09.310> use<00:05:10.320> white<00:05:11.320> hots<00:05:11.680> on

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 
doesn't work we can use white hots on

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:23.470 
a target eyes on we'll fire it where the

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:28.379 
a target eyes on we'll fire it where the
turret<00:05:23.830> any<00:05:23.979> body<00:05:24.400> is<00:05:24.699> a<00:05:26.610> apart<00:05:27.610> the<00:05:27.820> wedded

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:28.389 
turret any body is a apart the wedded

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:31.050 
turret any body is a apart the wedded
turret<00:05:28.750> meets<00:05:28.960> the<00:05:29.169> body<00:05:29.349> there<00:05:29.889> we<00:05:30.009> go<00:05:30.099> fire

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:31.060 
turret meets the body there we go fire

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:36.060 
turret meets the body there we go fire
fire<00:05:31.960> fire

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:36.070 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:41.580 

BAM<00:05:36.820> I<00:05:38.520> think<00:05:39.520> we<00:05:39.640> hit<00:05:39.760> it<00:05:39.820> right<00:05:40.030> on<00:05:40.350> so<00:05:41.350> let's

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:41.590 
BAM I think we hit it right on so let's

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:45.810 
BAM I think we hit it right on so let's
take<00:05:41.770> it<00:05:41.950> for<00:05:42.400> another<00:05:42.580> spin<00:05:44.190> will<00:05:45.190> load<00:05:45.790> it

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:45.820 
take it for another spin will load it

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:51.240 
take it for another spin will load it
quickly<00:05:46.150> and<00:05:48.840> oh<00:05:49.840> well<00:05:50.320> not<00:05:50.500> quickly<00:05:50.770> I<00:05:50.920> guess

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:51.250 
quickly and oh well not quickly I guess

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:55.280 
quickly and oh well not quickly I guess
it<00:05:51.640> takes<00:05:51.790> a<00:05:52.200> take<00:05:53.200> some<00:05:53.380> time<00:05:53.590> that<00:05:54.340> tank<00:05:54.820> is

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:55.290 
it takes a take some time that tank is

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:57.720 
it takes a take some time that tank is
disabled<00:05:56.290> it<00:05:56.410> does<00:05:56.560> not<00:05:56.710> have<00:05:56.920> to<00:05:56.950> explode<00:05:57.490> to

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:57.730 
disabled it does not have to explode to

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:01.700 
disabled it does not have to explode to
you<00:05:58.600> know<00:05:58.750> be<00:05:59.230> ineffective<00:05:59.830> it<00:06:00.310> just<00:06:00.970> stopped

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:01.710 
you know be ineffective it just stopped

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:04.710 
you know be ineffective it just stopped
most<00:06:02.710> tank<00:06:02.980> doesn't<00:06:03.220> really<00:06:03.580> explode<00:06:04.000> I'm

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:04.720 
most tank doesn't really explode I'm

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:06.330 
most tank doesn't really explode I'm
happy<00:06:05.140> to<00:06:05.320> see<00:06:05.470> that<00:06:05.500> it's<00:06:05.800> actually<00:06:06.010> not

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:06.340 
happy to see that it's actually not

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:09.870 
happy to see that it's actually not
exploding<00:06:06.940> but<00:06:07.600> right<00:06:07.750> now<00:06:08.490> that<00:06:09.490> tank<00:06:09.730> is

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:09.880 
exploding but right now that tank is

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:13.050 
exploding but right now that tank is
very<00:06:10.270> much<00:06:10.510> dead<00:06:11.250> so<00:06:12.250> we<00:06:12.400> can<00:06:12.550> actually<00:06:12.670> carry

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:13.060 
very much dead so we can actually carry

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:17.030 
very much dead so we can actually carry
this<00:06:14.520> and<00:06:15.520> move<00:06:15.700> it<00:06:15.850> around<00:06:15.970> like<00:06:16.300> this<00:06:16.510> for

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:17.040 
this and move it around like this for

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:21.300 
this and move it around like this for
small<00:06:18.040> again<00:06:19.200> adjustments<00:06:20.200> that's<00:06:20.860> good<00:06:21.100> I

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:21.310 
small again adjustments that's good I

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:24.900 
small again adjustments that's good I
wouldn't<00:06:22.180> do<00:06:22.360> that<00:06:22.390> for<00:06:23.320> too<00:06:23.590> long<00:06:23.910> probably

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:24.910 
wouldn't do that for too long probably

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:29.250 
wouldn't do that for too long probably
not<00:06:25.090> gonna<00:06:25.690> drag<00:06:26.020> these<00:06:26.490> miles<00:06:27.540> and<00:06:28.540> miles<00:06:28.780> but

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:29.260 
not gonna drag these miles and miles but

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.380 
not gonna drag these miles and miles but
it's<00:06:29.830> very<00:06:30.010> good<00:06:30.250> function<00:06:30.670> that<00:06:30.970> allows<00:06:31.150> you

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:31.390
