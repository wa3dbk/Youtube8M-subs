00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
the color block and it's using different

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.880

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
bold pops of color and putting it all

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.040 
bold pops of color and putting it all
together<00:02:38.069> is<00:02:38.640> a<00:02:39.390> wonderful<00:02:39.540> way<00:02:40.019> of

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
together is a wonderful way of

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.930 
together is a wonderful way of
experimenting<00:02:40.650> and<00:02:40.950> trying<00:02:41.099> new<00:02:41.459> things<00:02:41.489> out

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
experimenting and trying new things out

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.390 
experimenting and trying new things out
but<00:02:42.480> I<00:02:42.840> think<00:02:43.440> this<00:02:43.560> is<00:02:43.739> quite<00:02:43.980> a<00:02:44.069> powerful

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
but I think this is quite a powerful

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.550 
but I think this is quite a powerful
combination<00:02:44.910> what<00:02:45.420> do<00:02:45.480> you<00:02:45.540> think<00:02:45.720> it<00:02:45.959> is<00:02:45.989> very

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
combination what do you think it is very

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.020 
combination what do you think it is very
strong<00:02:48.230> so<00:02:49.230> if<00:02:49.410> color<00:02:49.890> blocking<00:02:50.459> is<00:02:50.640> too

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
strong so if color blocking is too

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.180 
strong so if color blocking is too
strong<00:02:51.360> or<00:02:51.540> too<00:02:51.690> bold<00:02:51.959> for<00:02:52.170> you<00:02:52.260> another<00:02:52.950> way

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
strong or too bold for you another way

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.910 
strong or too bold for you another way
to<00:02:53.250> get<00:02:53.430> your<00:02:53.610> color<00:02:53.880> in<00:02:54.209> is<00:02:54.420> by<00:02:54.959> dressing<00:02:55.319> in<00:02:55.680> a
