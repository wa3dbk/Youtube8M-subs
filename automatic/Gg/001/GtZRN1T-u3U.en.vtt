into<00:00:51.449> it<00:00:51.649> I<00:00:52.850> asked<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.629> Muslim<00:00:55.020> about<00:00:55.230> a

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
into it I asked the Muslim about a

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.930 
into it I asked the Muslim about a
strategy<00:00:55.739> but<00:00:55.829> I<00:00:55.890> didn't<00:00:56.219> get<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.670> Builder

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
strategy but I didn't get the Builder

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.939 
strategy but I didn't get the Builder
right<00:00:57.239> I<00:00:57.449> I<00:00:57.719> don't<00:00:58.140> know<00:00:58.199> it's<00:00:58.350> just<00:00:58.500> so<00:00:58.739> it's

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
right I I don't know it's just so it's

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.439 
right I I don't know it's just so it's
so<00:00:59.250> it's<00:00:59.609> nothing<00:01:00.180> like<00:01:00.390> a<00:01:00.739> ladder<00:01:01.739> at<00:01:02.100> all

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:02.449 
so it's nothing like a ladder at all

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:06.380 
so it's nothing like a ladder at all
it's<00:01:03.449> you<00:01:04.049> can't<00:01:04.470> really<00:01:05.000> adapt<00:01:06.000> it<00:01:06.180> on<00:01:06.299> the

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
it's you can't really adapt it on the

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.940 
it's you can't really adapt it on the
fly<00:01:06.600> if<00:01:06.659> you<00:01:06.840> don't<00:01:06.990> have<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.229> practice<00:01:07.710> of<00:01:07.830> a

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950
