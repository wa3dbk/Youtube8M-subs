00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:03.629
 here we are going to go to bercy 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.040
 for the tennis game forget becker 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:06.450
 forget plays very well he hangs 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.309
 becker we are in the third set people 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.389
 my mother exactly my dear hervé us 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.250
 let's go right back to the 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.330
 central where guy forget and service he 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.099
 is conducted 15 30 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.420
 the players are five everywhere it's 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.410
 a pretty fantastic part especially 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.180
 in this third set 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.210
 guy forget indeed to four everywhere 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.609
 had lost his service so boris 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.199
 Becker in stride served for gain 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.119
 of the match but frank and did not crack 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.070
 under the eyes of jean claude perrin and 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.349
 forget has taken over the service of boris 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.210
 becker he's led now on his 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.000
 service then you know it gold if joe 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.440
 dassin he is led even 15 40 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.570
 she is cracking it's up to 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.250
 that you change and lose 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.260
 this part plays of course everything 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.730
 certainly why it is useful to save 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.300
 in the first circle allowed him to 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.400
 win it in the tie break 7 2 to 6 and in 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.630
 however, it has weakened a little 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.980
 second set that she lost six games 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.290
 to attacks but he found himself well 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.420
 in the third alas next boris 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.610
 becker who today displays first 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.739
 a small form but also a bad one 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.170
 character in the image of his shirt 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.810
 bad taste for now anyway 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.320
 forget holds well it would have to 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.619
 find his service if he wants to save 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.910
 seven break balls 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:17.310
 here you see kills and come back 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:19.710
 but 40 security purse 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.340
 30 40 guy forget is really 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.149
 cling dying escape no point 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.149
 today, however, it is that we 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:28.440
 surface that he is good at boris becker 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:29.850
 we remind that for shows 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.130
 eminem was the first winner of 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.450
 the open of bercy but which changes is in 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.100
 constant progress you know we say 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.520
 always it's the great hope of tennis 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.530
 French is good every time he gets 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.330
 find that we did not lie to him 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.740
 and he's progressing regularly he's coming 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.820
 at the level of the greatest proof 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.330
 today it is that he worries the 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.330
 number two worldwide 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.150
 this is because there is equality 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.500
 we will see the qualifiers of the day with garlic 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.390
 and the onion comes right back to 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.640
 match forget becker absolutely let's go 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.470
 so the pictures please and you 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.650
 go find out who is our 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.750
 Review the hero of the day is willy masure 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.670
 where the mazures the Australian who eliminates 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.740
 argentinian mansi or mazes from 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.360
 qualifications allowed himself to go out in 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.560
 three sets the city scorer towards 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.190
 yesterday and it's not a thin 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.800
 performance 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.020
 yes the mazures in the quarterfinals will be 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.520
 opposite or to boris becker or to guy forget 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.880
 who are currently splitting it on the 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.680
 central as to john mcenroe he continues 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.390
 on its momentum little quiz on the move 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.800
 little rumblings facing this poor one 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.350
 dream tie-break and a second set 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.030
 concluded on a brilliant 6-0 mcenroe a 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.250
 completely disappointed destroys what offers 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.989
 this afternoon will maintain the turn 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.820
 next are sat at michael chang i 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:43.350
 virais this is the format of the nervous against 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.239
 calm it will probably be enough 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.370
 detonating then my dear hervé we 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:49.380
 now back to the central where 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.640
 I told you boris becker poster 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.130
 since the beginning of this part has 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.930
 bad character obvious he tried by 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.030
 all the means to deconcentrate his 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.799
 adversary he continues besides to 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.420
 whenever it goes wrong for 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:01.890
 he always finds a way to 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.080
 challenge these had the ball or a 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.300
 spectator 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.950
 rain is deviated advantage sliced 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.960
 it's true that guy forget trouble in this 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.400
 moment on his service he tries by 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.680
 all the ways to deconcentrate it 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:17.030
 is true that if guy forget wins there 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:19.480
 his service the two players will go in 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.480
 tie break 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.060
 she did not lose everything 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.920
 tennis for effector you see it I 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.480
 offers you is a little hair 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.680
 it's a shame yes no power 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.150
 having this match point is a match 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.310
 they finished the quarter hour 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.020
 just like we are part of the 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.830
 last topic is cinema and everything to 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.830
