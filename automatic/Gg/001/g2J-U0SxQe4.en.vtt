00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
over listen fully digital clocks you can

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.580 
over listen fully digital clocks you can
see<00:02:43.600> ABS<00:02:44.020> light<00:02:44.260> there<00:02:44.650> and<00:02:45.180> I've<00:02:46.180> done<00:02:46.590> 357

miles on it so far so still running in
just<00:02:50.709> over<00:02:50.800> halfway<00:02:53.130> I'll<00:02:54.130> start<00:02:54.400> up<00:02:58.590> you

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
just over halfway I'll start up you

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.110 
just over halfway I'll start up you
probably<00:02:59.950> won't<00:03:00.130> hear<00:03:01.000> the<00:03:01.750> actual<00:03:01.900> sound<00:03:03.120> of

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
probably won't hear the actual sound of

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.180 
probably won't hear the actual sound of
the<00:03:04.300> stock<00:03:04.540> exhaust<00:03:05.130> it<00:03:06.130> don't<00:03:06.400> sort<00:03:06.700> of<00:03:08.190> play

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
the stock exhaust it don't sort of play

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:10.050 
the stock exhaust it don't sort of play
it<00:03:09.220> back<00:03:09.489> properly
