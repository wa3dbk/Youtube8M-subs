that we've been seeing many many times
now<00:00:27.439> but<00:00:28.439> it's<00:00:28.680> actually<00:00:28.859> now<00:00:29.160> been<00:00:29.400> leaking

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
now but it's actually now been leaking

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.299 
now but it's actually now been leaking

next-generation iphone and it's the same
kind<00:00:33.960> of<00:00:34.170> prototypes<00:00:34.649> that<00:00:34.920> I<00:00:35.489> have<00:00:35.670> been

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
kind of prototypes that I have been

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.090 
kind of prototypes that I have been
checking<00:00:36.030> out<00:00:36.469> earlier<00:00:37.790> and<00:00:38.790> then<00:00:39.510> I<00:00:40.100> didn't

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.910 
checking out earlier and then I didn't
get<00:00:41.250> actually<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:42.059> M<00:00:42.300> I<00:00:43.010> didn't<00:00:44.010> get<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:45.920> this

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
get actually the M I didn't get the this

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.889 
get actually the M I didn't get the this
other<00:00:47.370> iphone<00:00:47.850> here<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.270> bigger<00:00:48.450> iphone<00:00:48.780> is

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
other iphone here the bigger iphone is

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.090

because he here the five min five ish

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.610 
because he here the five min five ish
variant<00:00:50.520> I<00:00:50.760> didn't<00:00:51.660> get<00:00:51.719> a<00:00:51.780> prototype<00:00:52.260> of<00:00:52.410> that

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
variant I didn't get a prototype of that

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.220 
variant I didn't get a prototype of that
I<00:00:52.949> might<00:00:53.309> be<00:00:53.489> able<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.789> get<00:00:53.969> it<00:00:54.000> though<00:00:54.270> but<00:00:55.199> I

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.550 
toys on the front side I know that
that's<00:01:16.890> because<00:01:17.280> probably<00:01:18.150> use<00:01:19.049> prototypes

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
that's because probably use prototypes

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.920

good stuff sack over 4.7 inch at the
bottom<00:01:36.930> I<00:01:37.079> mean<00:01:37.680> this<00:01:37.829> is<00:01:37.890> going<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.220> be<00:01:38.340> a

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
bottom I mean this is going to be a

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.370 
bottom I mean this is going to be a
because<00:01:38.790> this<00:01:38.939> could<00:01:39.090> be<00:01:39.210> a<00:01:39.240> very<00:01:39.299> major<00:01:39.869> year

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
because this could be a very major year

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.310 
because this could be a very major year
for<00:01:40.590> Apple<00:01:40.979> if<00:01:41.790> they're<00:01:42.060> both<00:01:42.329> going<00:01:42.960> to<00:01:43.079> bump

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
for Apple if they're both going to bump

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.050 
for Apple if they're both going to bump
up<00:01:43.470> everything<00:01:44.100> from<00:01:44.520> four<00:01:44.850> inch<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:46.250> 2<00:01:47.250> /<00:01:47.759> 5

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
up everything from four inch to 2 / 5

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.050 
up everything from four inch to 2 / 5
inch<00:01:48.329> this<00:01:48.780> year<00:01:49.170> that's<00:01:50.070> a<00:01:50.189> major<00:01:50.369> major<00:01:50.700> bump

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
inch this year that's a major major bump

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.910 
inch this year that's a major major bump
because<00:01:51.420> usually<00:01:51.720> Android<00:01:52.200> devices<00:01:52.439> has<00:01:52.770> been

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
because usually Android devices has been

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.539 
because usually Android devices has been
going<00:01:53.189> up<00:01:53.280> like<00:01:53.670> dot<00:01:54.090> 3<00:01:54.540> inches<00:01:54.930> every<00:01:55.860> year<00:01:56.310> so

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
going up like dot 3 inches every year so

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.789 
going up like dot 3 inches every year so
I<00:01:56.899> think<00:01:57.899> it<00:01:58.079> seems<00:01:58.229> to<00:01:58.320> be<00:01:58.409> slowing<00:01:58.560> down

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799

I think it seems to be slowing down
right<00:01:59.009> now<00:01:59.189> because<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.670> galaxy<00:01:59.969> note<00:02:00.119> 4

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329
