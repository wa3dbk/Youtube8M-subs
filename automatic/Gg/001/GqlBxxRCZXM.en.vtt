 Hi, Today I am making 3-element not a green tea machine ice cream. 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:20.440
 First, mix 4 ملعقة teaspoons of green tea powder into 3 tablespoons of hot water 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.040
 Let cool. 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:33.040
 Then whip 1 cup of heavy cold cream until stiffened. 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:39.240
 Heavy cream contains more than 36% of milk fat, should be harsh skin without sugar. 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:50.540
 Now mix the green tea mixture with كوب cup of condensed cold sweetened milk. 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.560
 Add in green tea and (sweetened) condensed milk mixture to heavy cream 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:04.560
 Folds carefully until combined. 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:13.370
 Now transfer to a bowl of plastic container or bread. 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.970
 Cover with plastic wrap. 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:27.470
 Then freeze for at least 6 hours or overnight. 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:28.670
 Voila, 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.570
 Homemade 3-element is not a green tea machine ice cream. 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.560
 Just like all other cream does not frost the ice, it's a little fatty. 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.260
 But this is easy and very serious and good. 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.170
 Bon appetite. 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.560
 The ice cream is green enough but the bitterness of green tea is not overwhelming. 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:56.270
 Having a taste is fine because it is just just sweet. 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.660
 You can add this ice cream in my iced green tea latte. 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:06.660
 I have more recipes for the summer: rainbow suckers, watermelon suckers, cookies and cream popsicles. 

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:16.870
 thanks for watching. Bye for now.
