00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:08.209
 description of the fastest page 

00:00:04.109 --> 00:00:08.209
 reliable and cheap soccer market 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.140
 who I am 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.400
 very good guys welcome to a 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.439
 new wilder of the channel this time the 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.689
 filippo inzaghi I will show you the 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:30.980
 team with whom I used it and asked for forgiveness 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:32.780
 because the truth that the capture dies 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.030
 serious failure the quad builder but the 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.710
 audio was cut in half did not return to 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:40.100
 connect 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:42.199
 the video is also fine and good 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.600
 ask your forgiveness because good we 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:47.059
 Youtubers are always at the expense of 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.649
 that all this does not fail but when it fails 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:50.600
 the truth that there is no we can not do 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:52.370
 nothing and the equipment is already sold so 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.260
 nothing shall I will teach through the 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.110
 football page let's start with 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.760
 gianluigi buffon is a porterazo is a 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.280
 porterazo I love the best 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.680
 goalkeepers come from the best goalkeepers 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.449
 who has seen the world and not really 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.520
 they play very well plays very well has two 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.380
 great stops but if there are any for 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.300
 there but good from the right side 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.800
 we have konko I like more than abate 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.770
 the truth because it's more complete about 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:18.500
 all the war rate does not have the attack 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:21.229
 so high and it shows a lot the couple of 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.929
 Central are CÃ¡ceres and who line as 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:25.610
 you can see reliable is more can not be 

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:27.380
 really quick to do is it has 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.080
 surprised every time I am surprised more 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.090
 I always have the doubt of home bona juan 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.119
 Jesus Caceres and I prefer CÃ¡ceres 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.170
 this time and really really good the 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:39.110
 left side 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.899
 radu de la lazio a lateral equal very 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.130
 very defensive very never loses the 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:44.180
 position and good 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.700
 of the defensive line I liked 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.420
 quite let's start with the line of 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.420
 three 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.520
 first of all, well, let's go to vidal 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:55.430
 tell you that I love the 433 to play 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:58.789
 by boat and well let's start with 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:00.579
 vidal brutal non- vidal does everything and the 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:03.229
 true that to have three midfielders 

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:06.020
 it's very good that they know how to defend 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:08.209
 how to attack and vidal is that is attack and 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.910
 defense in a single player because 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:13.160
 we also have a pirlo pirlo lento 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.840
 in quotes because the truth that 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.099
 then he manages very well with the ball is 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.630
 a player that I really like to have in 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:20.569
 the teams but not all the leagues 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.849
 they are worth as xavi iniesta pirlo that 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:25.370
 The ball sleeps a lot and they always wait 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:27.170
 to the best pass and the truth that I 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.760
 entertained a lot with pirlo I think that by 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.890
 there a good goal 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.849
 and then finally hernandez that appears 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:36.230
 the center the midfielder more 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:37.879
 underestimated of the game at least as 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.840
 plays because in reality it's a bit 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:43.610
 irregular and I do not like it that much but 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.959
 in the game always meets has five 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.760
 bad standing stars which comes 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.010
 great because it has a shot apart 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.159
 incredible and good the truth is that it is 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:54.200
 fine cinnamon cinnamon is not hernandez and 

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:56.840
 let's see there the lateral forgiveness the 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.329
 right end that andrew is going to be 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:02.180
 girl andrÃ© masson very very similar 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:03.799
 but I've used enough to do if this year 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.019
 so I wanted to prove to candreva that 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:08.480
 It also has a better shot and is more 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:09.590
 defensive and I put it and the truth that no 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.810
 I was disappointed I think there is no 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.930
 no clip of it but it has really 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:17.030
 fulfilled very well left end a 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.159
 damn legend my god what good is 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.530
 francesco totti slow vale if it is very 

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:23.599
 slow but that shot has over 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.819
 is 5 is standing bad I was surprised 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:27.290
 quite the truth because the leg that 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:29.750
 also dominate the left with the right hand 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.830
 I do not see it but hey welcome are 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.330
 true 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.320
 the truth that I liked a lot 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.780
 He liked it a lot and it entertains me 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:38.330
 a lot with totti there are good goals 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.290
 with totti and center forward 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:43.450
 filippo inzaghi 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:46.040
 ss this Italian striker is great and 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.330
 good the truth that good the equipment me 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.240
 I really like the team is a team 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:52.580
 really that can be used for use 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:55.010
 competitive or valuable many times what 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:58.130
 I mention in other wilder spots that I say 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:00.410
 no not trying to use the matches that 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.930
 you want to win and such not this team 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:07.010
 I think that won all the matches with 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:09.350
 he and really is is great is great 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.630
 how does he play how dog moves by 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:13.790
 the field the ends I love the 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:15.830
 defense always well placed swollen and 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.739
 putting everything they have some for 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:20.120
 inzaghi I really tell you what you try 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:22.910
 this team because you're going to like it a lot 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.530

 they are finishing but little by little little to 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.510
 little are running out and good 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.950
 they have not been bad, I do not expect that 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.510
