00:00:00.559 --> 00:00:07.500
 Typing and processing texts on the Samsung Galaxy Tab is quite different from processing texts on the computer. 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.700
 I will show you some tricks so that you can process text more smoothly in the future. 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:18.300
 I do this in the Note app but you can also apply these tips in many other apps. 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:25.000
 First we turn off the spelling correction to prevent words from being automatically corrected in something you don't want. 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.700
 I tap the blocks at the top right and then I tap Settings. 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 Then I choose Language and input. 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.000
 Next to Samsung keyboard, I tap the sliders. 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.400
 I choose predictive text. 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:54.700
 I uncheck Spelling Correction and I also check Next word predict. 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.500
 I'm going back to the Start screen. 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.500
 Now I open the Note app via the blocks at the top right. 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:12.000
 Here I have all the notes in which I want to type text. 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.100
 I tap at the end of the text and start typing the word. 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.900
 Word suggestions appear as you type. 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.900
 If you already see what you want, tap that word. 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.300
 The word is directly in your text. 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.400
 However, you do not necessarily have to take a word in this way. 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.500
 You can also type the word yourself. 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.300
 Then ignore the words that the tablet itself makes of it and just type in. 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.300
 This was one tip about word processing. 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.900
 The following is just as useful. 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:01.600
 You can insert text somewhere by tapping where you want to put the new text. 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.800
 But sometimes you do not find out exactly where you want to be. 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:12.800
 A word is written together in this note, but that word actually consists of two separate words. 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.800
 So there must be a space in between. 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.800
 Tap the screen briefly, near where the space should be. 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.700
 A sort of mouse pointer appears. 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.500
 You can drag the pointer to the right place with your finger. 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:32.300
 By tilting your finger, you can determine the location very precisely. 

00:02:32.389 --> 00:02:40.200
 Release the screen and with a tap on the space bar there is now a space. 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:46.600
 It is also useful if you know how to select, copy and paste text. 

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:54.900
 When you hold your finger on the text for a little longer, two selection blocks appear around a word. 

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:59.500
 You can move it to select more or less text. 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:04.300
 At the top there are several options at that time. 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:10.000
 For example, you can cut or copy text. I tap Copy. 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.300
 I then tap the screen at the end of the text. 

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:19.600
 And the option to paste the text appears. 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.000
 I tap that and the text is pasted. 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:30.000
 With these tips you can easily type and edit texts on the Samsung Galaxy Tab. Good luck!
