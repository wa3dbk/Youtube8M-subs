00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:12.969
 well we are ready ready more than 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:14.619
 ready to make the cactus that is going to 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:16.240
 serve to put our 

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:18.850
 pins our needles and that is not 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.900
 they lose us and we go on biting very 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:21.970
 all right 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:25.330
 before we start let's see the list of 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:28.300
 materials and we come back in a two by three 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:31.180
 for the cactus for pins you need 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:34.739
 felt green yarn to tackle color 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:38.170
 green stuffed small clay pots 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:41.310
 little pebbles small gun pins and 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:43.710
 silicon bars clay 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:46.280
 Well, let's start with the 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.740
 principle so we 're going to dial with 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.870
 clarity at trial the truth is that it is 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:56.280
 very easy because they are simply two 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:01:00.720
 rectangles with the rounded tip and 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.880
 also a kind of a relationship 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:09.330
 little chubby there is and if they want nothing 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:12.230
 we recorded it and the truth is that the 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.230
 bill 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:26.450
 that muscle me stapler that here 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:30.380
 without change I had it in the basement here 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:32.990
 I hope Martin Martin team not if I'm going to 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.899
 wait and well we are gathering all the 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:38.409
 material we have the pot the filling 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:41.619
 the thread to tackle 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:43.179
 false kingfisher will not give where to bring 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:45.729
 because this is very underground in 

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:47.670
 our basement so well why 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:49.960
 true 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.560
 Well, well, let's start it 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.560
 cut yes no 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:59.130
 and look as if there is that is the 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.210
 magic of television we are going to 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.460
 record already know that whenever 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.610
 we need to do something double that's the 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:08.830
 option to fold the fabric in engrave it and 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:11.360
 after we cut it 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:14.200
 and facilitated 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:17.069
 and what we are going to do is 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.069
 You can start 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.000
 to own it 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.650
 is 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:32.360
 this and apart the good thing is that we can 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.750
 make a contrast with two types of 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.750
 green 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:41.390
 and maybe we can leave one or another 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.750
 apart release an appointment to make it look like 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:48.230
 are the thorns we can make it more wave 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:50.680
 nopal with the little hands the sticks 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.680
 as well 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.310
 Well once we have finished 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.260
 sew the main part of our 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.600
 cactus let's start to put the 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:03.350
 filling on the bottom that 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:05.530
 So we leave without sewing with the help of 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.530
 scissors 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:15.420
 and we can put them in and then we 'll go 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.860
 taking it and a part joins it because it is not 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.240
 is thinking that it may be easier 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:22.500
 that later and they put it to see how 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.080
 let's test the two ways to 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.450
 see what 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.760
 that suits us more for this part I 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:33.800
 I cut it as in strips so that it was 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:35.940
 easier to put her of an eternal life 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.430
 is 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:43.400
 the main part is already left and we are going to 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.400
 have the other two as the little arms 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:50.620
 this father of this idea of ​​doing the 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:54.670
 arm in green dark green felt 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:57.040
 military and the thread to embroider that is a 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.230
 little brighter or change the 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.569
 hue of a lemon green gives you a 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.579
 good contrast 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:05.710
 and then we will need to sew the 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:07.960
 little arms 

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:10.170
 the little arms to the main channel 

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:12.270
 principal 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:15.180
 1 part we also have the stones 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:17.459
 what can you get out of that 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.709
 previously we made that we also 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:24.860
 done if they want to have one then a little 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:27.840
 we can leave it like this without the 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:30.780
 little arms I say they are now to add them 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:34.790
 several but then the cactus family does not 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:37.849
 then you have it here ready with your 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:40.459
 with your needles 

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:45.279
 and here we are going to show you what is already 

00:04:40.459 --> 00:04:45.279
 we have done that is dad 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.580
 Super original is decorative and very 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:52.860
 practical and many and the truth is that 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:55.830
 we thought it was going to be more complicated 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:59.909
 if it's not like that then I tried at home 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:03.210
 and apart it's cheap and again you can 

00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:06.150
 then use it for gifts for your 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:08.039
 home or to do a business and or a 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:11.569
 little gift so what do you think if we go 

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:14.089
 to see the elaboration mode and we go back 

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:15.740
 new process with the help of the 

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:18.679
 greda back in the double felt and has 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:20.959
 engraved two eles and a rectangle with the 

00:05:18.679 --> 00:05:22.699
 rounded corners then the by the 

00:05:20.959 --> 00:05:25.249
 shore with the thread and fill them by a 

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:26.839
 end a link between each other and by the 

00:05:25.249 --> 00:05:29.149
 cactus in the pot by sticking it with 

00:05:26.839 --> 00:05:30.979
 coca silicone with the pebbles for 

00:05:29.149 --> 00:05:34.029
 give more naturalness and will be ready 

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:34.029
 to put your pins 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:38.040
 Well, we have finished this first 

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:40.920
 craftsmanship that enters with us because 

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:44.930
 the next two come so 

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:44.930
 let's go a cut and then
