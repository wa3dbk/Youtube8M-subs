00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:13.010
 The human body is composed of about 60 trillion cells 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:14.200
 All tissues and organs are aggregates of cells 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:19.119
 Masu have Tei 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:24.970
 In the beginning, only one fertilized egg repeats division 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:28.390
 We will continue to change in the cells that form the nerves and organs muscle 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:34.190
 The process by which such a cell's role is determined 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:38.180
 Cells that once differentiated in the body call back to undifferentiated state 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:43.160
 There is no limit on the ability to grow 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:47.050
 Therefore , there are many cases where organs and tissues lost due to accidents or illnesses 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.050
 Can not play 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:53.820
 But this common sense was overturned by ips cells 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:01:00.720
 Hmm 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:02.200
 Successful return to undifferentiated state by delivering four genes to differentiated cells 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:07.490
 It is 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:15.229
 The ability of ips cells to differentiate into all cells throughout the body 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:18.390
 Because it has high proliferation ability, it is possible to realize regenerative medicine that creates and documents alternative tissues and organs 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:25.850
 Sex came out 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:25.850
 For this purpose, it is necessary to cultivate large amounts of ips cells 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:41.470
 For example, treatment of heart disease requires approximately 1 billion cells or more 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:41.470
 If you cultivate this manually, you will need a lot of culture solution and time as you can see 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:54.600
 We research team to solve this task 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:54.600
 We tried a technique called three-dimensional floating stirring using a reactor 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:07.430
 Each roll in the reactor is often closed to expand sales of the plum king role in three dimensions 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:11.080
 Undifferentiated cells with high proliferative capacity increase in number by division 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.080
 It will increase to acknowledge 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:19.870
 However, human ips cells are vulnerable to physical stress 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:25.069
 When the flow of by O_eki is disturbed between cells Ya 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:30.720
 It collides with a stirring wing and can not multiply well 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:36.720
 So the research team corrects the shape of the sales force of the reactor 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:41.660
 As a result, the culture fluid will flow laterally at a constant rate. 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.660
 Agitator wings and cells have gone out of collision 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:51.680
 When human ips cells were cultured, it was possible to culture 50 culture dishes in one reactor. 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.280
 success 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.580
 me 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:03:03.520
 Compared to conventional manual work 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:03.520
 Space saving, high efficiency, low cost has realized mass culture 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:15.290
 In addition, we administer specific protein and drug 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:15.290
 We also succeeded in differentiating into fungal cells 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:24.810
 Necessary for research on regenerative medicine in the future 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:29.690
 Also Ya increase in the size of the reactor to a large number of ips cells 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.690
 We plan to respond by increasing the number 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:39.320
 And with the large supply of ips cells, regenerative medicine will reach your stage 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:50.920
 Research and development in the use of made in ips cells instead of the experimental animal organization in the field of drug discovery 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:54.190
 Will accelerate 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:59.920
 Also for people in various organizations 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:04:07.930
 Clinical application using ips cells is about to begin 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:16.500
 We further aim to organ creation in the village destination to operate in total the technology of regenerative medicine 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:16.500
 Complete the organ factory and open the way to treatment for many patients
