00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:17.949

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.970
 You have already looked at it diligently 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:24.609
 in the sony user forum and the pictures 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.800
 you just have to do it in the 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:28.990
 Picture sequence so not in the menu but 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.390
 there are these four things and 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:33.610
 on the left side at the sony can 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.160
 your set remote control is that 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.650
 at the bottom of the box and then it is 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:41.020
 a kid 's game with it's button or 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:43.780

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:47.260
 Delay pictures to make the cost 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.670
 18 euro still something with amazon and me 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.010
 Link this again down in the 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.420
 infobox I think the dinger class 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.280
 you do not have to do all that 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.950
 original remote control or the original 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:00.430
 buy remote from sony because it 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:01.990
 that's just how awesome and me 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.509
 had slight problems with the 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:07.930
 attitude at the beginning but at the moment 

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:10.240
 I have found now and something else to me 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.310
 that was provided now 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.350
 kindly from the same seller 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.480
 they are not yet on the market 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.070
 but I have in the sony user forum already 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.770
 a question found 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.690
 in the simple was asked if it 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.930
 such small remote release or 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:28.030
 Remote controls are available for cameras 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.580
 wanted to be for cameras so either 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.979
 the sony or other cameras with those 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.780
 you can then film live and that 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:35.800
 it is possible with this here is still 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.010
 not in trade 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.790
 but as soon as they exist, I will give you 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.550
 I'll show you the video 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:45.490
 also online in the sony user forum because I 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.900
 because just totally ingenious super information 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.270
 received within and within 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.580
 I would not be the shortest time otherwise 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.340
 video can rotate and here with can 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.049
 Do her a lot in any case 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.180
 Remote control works for the 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:00.520
 Video mode of the camera and that has just 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.680
 someone had asked why with 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.380
 this button you can the video mode 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.060
 of course trigger on your triggering advice 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.200
 above you also have the video mode 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.200
 have set 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:14.280
 He then switches to pictures 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:16.200
 Just take pictures on your bike 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.610
 and then takes the camera so I do 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.830
 I think it's great for sales 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.840
 practically because i do not like each one 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.370
 take a shot behind the camera 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.110
 to make the settings and so on 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.880
 I only really need it then 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.340
 Turning and using my wheel up 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.840
 these two remote control together i 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.940
 could imagine that too 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.239
 not much more expensive will be like 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.150
 click this to take pictures 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:39.420
 Video feature is wonderful here 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.610
 usable 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.920
 So I find awesome and after the part 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.890
 I have been visiting sony for some time 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.590
 costs around 50 euros but I guess 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.630
 will probably be around 28 euros 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.640
 cost why you have to spend more then 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.470

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.910

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.620
