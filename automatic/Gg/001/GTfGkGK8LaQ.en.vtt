on the right-hand Lane Lane 26 the

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.830 
on the right-hand Lane Lane 26 the
reason<00:00:55.890> being<00:00:56.070> is<00:00:56.489> that<00:00:56.760> if<00:00:57.239> you<00:00:57.449> pull<00:00:57.690> the

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
reason being is that if you pull the

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.200 
reason being is that if you pull the
ball<00:00:57.989> you<00:00:58.500> can<00:00:58.649> get<00:00:58.800> away<00:00:58.890> with<00:00:59.219> it<00:00:59.309> online<00:00:59.430> 26

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
ball you can get away with it online 26

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.150 
ball you can get away with it online 26
and<00:01:00.480> that's<00:01:00.629> what<00:01:00.780> normally<00:01:01.109> happens<00:01:01.170> under

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
and that's what normally happens under

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.039 
and that's what normally happens under
extreme<00:01:02.520> pressure<00:01:02.550> so<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.390> players<00:01:03.660> are

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
extreme pressure so the players are
