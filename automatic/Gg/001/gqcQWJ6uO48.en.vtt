00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.760 
but in the act of uncovering the crime
with<00:03:31.319> her<00:03:32.900> he's<00:03:33.900> able<00:03:34.050> to<00:03:34.230> overcome<00:03:34.709> that

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:34.770 
with her he's able to overcome that

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:38.420 
with her he's able to overcome that
weakness<00:03:35.160> and<00:03:35.610> they<00:03:36.120> end<00:03:36.330> up<00:03:37.220> if<00:03:38.220> they're

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
weakness and they end up if they're

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:45.980 
weakness and they end up if they're
married<00:03:38.700> yet<00:03:38.910> but<00:03:39.800> they're<00:03:40.800> on<00:03:40.950> the<00:03:41.069> way

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:45.990 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:48.290 

so<00:03:46.590> when<00:03:46.710> it<00:03:46.800> essentially<00:03:47.460> is<00:03:47.670> happening<00:03:47.880> is

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:48.300 
so when it essentially is happening is

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.200 
so when it essentially is happening is
that<00:03:48.630> the<00:03:49.350> hero<00:03:49.710> is<00:03:49.980> accomplishing<00:03:50.820> two

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:51.210 
that the hero is accomplishing two

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:53.420 
that the hero is accomplishing two
tracks<00:03:51.600> plugging<00:03:52.200> into<00:03:52.290> the<00:03:52.440> story<00:03:52.740> they're

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
tracks plugging into the story they're

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.670 
tracks plugging into the story they're
solving<00:03:53.850> the<00:03:54.000> personal<00:03:54.600> problem<00:03:55.050> and<00:03:55.260> they're

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
solving the personal problem and they're

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:01.220 
solving the personal problem and they're
solving<00:03:56.070> the<00:03:56.190> car

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.820 

what<00:04:01.830> to<00:04:02.730> structure<00:04:03.239> steps<00:04:03.569> you<00:04:04.500> think

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 
what to structure steps you think

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:12.330 
what to structure steps you think
through<00:04:05.129> our<00:04:05.160> emphasizes

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.900 

we<00:04:12.849> experience<00:04:13.599> level<00:04:14.640> weakness<00:04:15.640> e<00:04:15.790> is

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910 
we experience level weakness e is

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.140 
we experience level weakness e is
correct

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
correct

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:23.100

pump exactly one mystery person first
ones<00:04:30.100> need
