00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.360
 an even different sea framework is different is different personal despite 

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:08.359
 the action brother was changing with the purchase and portela 

00:00:08.959 --> 00:00:11.359
 a generation below the line 

00:00:11.359 --> 00:00:15.819
 then I get there often with the transcanada of June I saw all of them and 

00:00:15.819 --> 00:00:19.820
 this will give me another you up the river poti older than they then do not 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.820
 It was this and six months that colored players 

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:27.169
 to revive a dead a golden age of Flemish promises to be the most important 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:30.279
 in terms of quality and potential 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:33.279
 so I prayed a lot for winning because why 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.740
 is I think we have example is the same dunga said that I twisted a lot 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:41.900
 although we will not have much affinity with it and as the common as 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.200
 common person with many never pmdb despite having played together with him 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.170
 but I was too overwhelmed because 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.310
 new professionals have here have to arise I think being expelled hall 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:54.540
 crucial of griffin 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.730
 it's a sea that terrain 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.000
 It's here I hope to have a pilot commented taking truth. 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.539
 service contracted this season what is the guy that arrived I won 

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:10.249
 I won I won it First world is absolutely nothing the coach wants 

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:11.170
 player 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.619
 the leader who arrived was champion in the escalation 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.570
 the place to celebrate the world 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.650
 in this type is that I'm crazy political balance and at the time your 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.470
 so this is something that bothers me during which it twists by the wave of 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:27.730
 prosperity 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.430
 is a person who deserves this title 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.870
 will have a boost in his career will be a guy who earned more credit with 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:35.710
 his title 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.860
 and even for admiration that had a team play with terms more lenient to the 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.860
 sertanense is the organ will change 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.270
 the relationship is not related 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.370
 as the best accountant the process of choosing a coach from that 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:52.480
 title may change 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.159
 or was it a political event 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:59.170
 the ada outgoing interim on the Flemish in winning the championship walks 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.170
 by the operators group d and the leader 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.050
 it works 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.180
 in the time of fashion since fashion and 6 7 

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:13.849
 the singer is a guy who has no logical conviction that he has air sessions 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:16.199
 but most have no conviction 

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:19.689
 he is pressured by the press and by the biased pressure that staff and 

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:25.009
 twisted then by the press he does not have he does not have to be sure 

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:29.499
 of which but it was these players to be technical headquarters and that it goes of the right and only 

00:02:29.499 --> 00:02:33.459
 I was there from above is more comfort of the moment the speech stressed 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:37.489
 now I when I arrived decision is much more political policy I arrived 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:38.949
 now 

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:42.760
 to keep looking at me through it will be that this guy has potential with security 

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:44.059
 of the place 

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:47.809
 and it was the fla gradually was taking this advantage of 63% 

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:51.919
 no one can question 

00:02:51.919 --> 00:02:57.109
 began to respect me from the middle to the end much more completely 

00:02:57.109 --> 00:02:59.829
 skeptics with regard to the retired 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:02.139
 if you were a designer 

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:05.229
 the hypothesis is unfortunate to satisfy this press 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:08.979
 the supporter 

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:09.729
 to parents
