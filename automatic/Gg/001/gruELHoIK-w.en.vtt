 I'll do it . 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.649
 There's a hormone in our body called the luteal hormone. 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.210

 But when you are stressed, there are two things you can do to relieve stress . 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:51.809
 I bought one by raising my blood sugar or by raising blood pressure. 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.860
 Because when you are suddenly in a hurry situation it would have been retaining the fast blood sugar edaga 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.760
 I have to send it out. 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.390

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.050

 Oh, it's an estrogen. I know you guys know. 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:35.070
 Talking about stopping stress 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:39.240
 It means not to be a woman. 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:43.140
 Because I use this stress to raise blood pressure and blood pressure. 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:48.590
 So, my lieutenant Lee Kyung- jae has been good to talk and keep stressing. 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:50.399
 This hormone keeps getting stressed , so the blood sugar goes up. 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.280
 Diabetes can also be 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:58.950

 There are three kinds of islands in the world. 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:34.129
 There are three things: animals, plants and microbes . 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:38.680
 My human being is a man and woman, and now I want to have an island like this.

 I talk so much stress Giving to raise my blood pressure and blood glucose 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:52.680
 A typical male who uses anxiety because he uses up all his hormones.

 A man and a woman, so a testosterone that will not last a year after giving birth 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:14.930
 It's falling so suddenly, so I can not recover within a year .
