on the front wheel could
you<00:02:12.000> fix<00:02:12.390> clocks<00:02:12.930> so<00:02:13.680> you<00:02:13.740> then<00:02:14.010> go<00:02:14.250> to<00:02:14.310> the

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
you fix clocks so you then go to the

you fix clocks so you then go to the

front wheel you strip it down look at

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.790

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
you kind of replace it if you can fix it

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.490 
you kind of replace it if you can fix it
you<00:02:26.640> try<00:02:26.910> and<00:02:27.060> fix<00:02:27.270> it<00:02:27.450> if<00:02:27.600> you<00:02:27.720> can't<00:02:27.990> fix<00:02:28.320> it

you<00:02:28.680> replace<00:02:29.160> the<00:02:29.400> bit<00:02:29.580> and<00:02:29.790> that's<00:02:30.360> it<00:02:30.630> it<00:02:30.840> put

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
you replace the bit and that's it it put

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.560 
you replace the bit and that's it it put
it<00:02:31.140> back<00:02:31.170> together<00:02:31.500> jobs<00:02:32.130> are<00:02:32.340> good<00:02:32.520> I<00:02:32.850> mean

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
it back together jobs are good I mean

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.780 
it back together jobs are good I mean
that's<00:02:34.170> about<00:02:34.320> as<00:02:34.590> exciting<00:02:35.250> as<00:02:35.370> this<00:02:35.520> game

second-hand market and try and find one

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.240 
second-hand market and try and find one
a<00:02:44.490> bit<00:02:44.730> cheaper<00:02:45.090> and<00:02:45.240> then<00:02:45.720> maybe<00:02:46.410> you<00:02:47.130> know

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
a bit cheaper and then maybe you know

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.220 
a bit cheaper and then maybe you know
fix<00:02:47.640> it<00:02:47.790> up<00:02:47.880> a<00:02:47.970> little<00:02:48.060> bit<00:02:48.330> if<00:02:48.420> it's<00:02:48.600> a<00:02:48.690> bit<00:02:48.870> bit

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
fix it up a little bit if it's a bit bit

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.830 
fix it up a little bit if it's a bit bit
 and<00:02:49.820> you<00:02:50.820> can<00:02:51.000> then<00:02:51.120> put<00:02:51.330> that<00:02:51.450> on<00:02:51.510> to<00:02:51.720> the

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
 and you can then put that on to the

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.870 
 and you can then put that on to the
car<00:02:52.020> the<00:02:52.350> only<00:02:52.920> trouble<00:02:53.250> is<00:02:53.430> it's<00:02:53.610> not<00:02:53.820> a

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
car the only trouble is it's not a

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.940 
car the only trouble is it's not a
realistic<00:02:54.480> simulator<00:02:55.200> and<00:02:55.410> simulating<00:02:55.920> it

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
realistic simulator and simulating it

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.510 
realistic simulator and simulating it
should<00:02:56.190> be<00:02:56.280> realistic<00:02:56.760> I<00:02:56.850> mean<00:02:57.000> I<00:02:57.180> tried<00:02:58.020> to

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:58.520 
should be realistic I mean I tried to

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:03.710 
should be realistic I mean I tried to
smash<00:02:59.520> parts<00:03:00.120> of<00:03:00.240> a<00:03:00.330> car<00:03:01.550> to<00:03:02.550> then<00:03:02.790> claim<00:03:03.210> it

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
smash parts of a car to then claim it

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.300 
smash parts of a car to then claim it
was<00:03:03.840> already<00:03:04.260> like<00:03:04.530> that<00:03:04.560> and<00:03:04.950> you<00:03:05.100> should

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
was already like that and you should

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.130 
was already like that and you should
have<00:03:05.460> it<00:03:05.580> replaced<00:03:05.820> like<00:03:06.240> what<00:03:06.630> you<00:03:06.780> do<00:03:06.930> in<00:03:06.960> a

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
have it replaced like what you do in a

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.500 
have it replaced like what you do in a
normal<00:03:07.320> garage<00:03:07.800> but<00:03:07.980> I<00:03:08.070> couldn't<00:03:08.460> do<00:03:08.580> it<00:03:08.700> I<00:03:08.910> try

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
normal garage but I couldn't do it I try

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.800 
normal garage but I couldn't do it I try
to<00:03:09.570> replace<00:03:10.850> parts<00:03:11.850> with<00:03:12.060> second-hand

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
to replace parts with second-hand

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.410 
to replace parts with second-hand
worn-out<00:03:13.590> parts<00:03:13.950> and<00:03:14.310> fob<00:03:14.700> it<00:03:14.850> off<00:03:14.940> as<00:03:15.120> a<00:03:15.150> new

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
worn-out parts and fob it off as a new

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.840 
worn-out parts and fob it off as a new
bit<00:03:15.660> which<00:03:16.320> obviously<00:03:16.890> is<00:03:17.190> again<00:03:17.640> what

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
bit which obviously is again what

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.370 
bit which obviously is again what
happens<00:03:18.180> in<00:03:18.330> a<00:03:18.420> garage<00:03:18.720> and<00:03:18.900> I<00:03:18.989> couldn't<00:03:19.260> do

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
happens in a garage and I couldn't do

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.020 
happens in a garage and I couldn't do
that<00:03:19.530> so<00:03:19.709> it's<00:03:19.830> not<00:03:19.980> exactly<00:03:20.130> a<00:03:20.520> frickin

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
that so it's not exactly a frickin

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.660 
that so it's not exactly a frickin
simulator<00:03:21.540> it's<00:03:22.140> like<00:03:22.410> an<00:03:22.590> honest<00:03:22.950> garage<00:03:23.400> and

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
simulator it's like an honest garage and

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.310 
simulator it's like an honest garage and
you<00:03:23.850> know<00:03:23.970> there<00:03:24.180> is<00:03:24.330> no<00:03:24.510> such<00:03:24.780> thing<00:03:25.050> as<00:03:25.080> an

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
you know there is no such thing as an

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.949 
you know there is no such thing as an
honest<00:03:25.590> garage<00:03:25.890> the<00:03:26.130> role<00:03:26.310> crooked<00:03:26.820> it's<00:03:27.300> it's

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
honest garage the role crooked it's it's

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.590 
honest garage the role crooked it's it's
almost<00:03:28.320> like<00:03:28.940> that<00:03:29.940> doesn't<00:03:30.209> have<00:03:30.360> to<00:03:30.480> be<00:03:30.570> a

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
almost like that doesn't have to be a

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.240 
almost like that doesn't have to be a
car<00:03:30.900> there<00:03:30.930> or<00:03:31.290> a<00:03:31.320> vehicle<00:03:31.680> it<00:03:31.770> could<00:03:31.920> just<00:03:32.130> be

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
car there or a vehicle it could just be

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.370 
car there or a vehicle it could just be
a<00:03:32.280> number<00:03:32.670> of<00:03:32.760> blocks<00:03:33.090> and<00:03:33.390> you<00:03:33.780> look<00:03:34.020> for<00:03:34.260> the

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
a number of blocks and you look for the

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.650 
a number of blocks and you look for the
the<00:03:34.640> broken<00:03:35.640> blocks<00:03:35.940> and<00:03:36.180> replace<00:03:36.480> it<00:03:36.630> with

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
the broken blocks and replace it with

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.270 
the broken blocks and replace it with
new<00:03:36.780> blocks<00:03:37.260> it<00:03:37.470> just<00:03:37.680> happens<00:03:38.040> that<00:03:38.100> the

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
new blocks it just happens that the

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.660 
new blocks it just happens that the
blocks<00:03:38.550> are<00:03:38.700> the<00:03:39.420> we<00:03:40.290> are<00:03:40.890> an<00:03:41.040> engine<00:03:41.370> you<00:03:41.489> know

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
blocks are the we are an engine you know

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.130 
blocks are the we are an engine you know
a<00:03:41.700> full<00:03:42.030> engine<00:03:42.180> that<00:03:42.450> you<00:03:42.510> can<00:03:42.660> strip<00:03:42.959> down

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
a full engine that you can strip down

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.199 
a full engine that you can strip down
and<00:03:43.200> put<00:03:43.530> back<00:03:43.680> together<00:03:43.860> but<00:03:44.190> it<00:03:44.700> just<00:03:44.730> kind

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
and put back together but it just kind

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:46.850 
and put back together but it just kind
of<00:03:45.300> hold<00:03:45.510> the<00:03:45.630> mouse<00:03:45.810> button<00:03:46.170> down<00:03:46.350> and<00:03:46.620> it

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
of hold the mouse button down and it

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.820 
of hold the mouse button down and it
unscrews<00:03:47.640> stuff<00:03:48.030> and<00:03:48.239> then<00:03:48.360> it's<00:03:48.570> you<00:03:49.320> know

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
unscrews stuff and then it's you know

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:51.560
