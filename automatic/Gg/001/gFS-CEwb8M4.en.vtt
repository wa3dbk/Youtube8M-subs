 grated of a large lemon and an orange 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.540
 to decorate it we are going to need fruits 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.520
 discarded to taste an egg sugar 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.020
 milkshake and an orange also the 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.199
 figurines that we use inside the 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:46.090
 roscón we mix a part of the 250 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:47.620
 milliliters of warm milk with 2 or 3 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.230
 Scoops of the strength flour 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.210
 we also add 25-30 grams of 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:55.839
 fresh yeast crumbled and what 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:57.670
 we remove everything it covers and it leaves about 15 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:00:59.140
 or 20 minutes in a warm place so that 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.790
 ferment 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.130
 once the starting mass has 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.600
 fermented in a large bowl we add the 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:06.190
 rest of the flour and we are adding 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.979
 little by little also the rest of 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:12.520
 Ingredients sugar lemon zest and 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:14.020
 orange salt milk two eggs the dough 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.360
 boot that we had in another container 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.670
 fermented orange blossom water and by 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.170
 last the melted butter 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.150
 stir until there is a dough 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.070
 homogeneous then we analyze a 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.930
 smooth surface and knead for about 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.700
 minutes with our hands if it is 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.360
 necessary we add a little more 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.820
 flour to be able to work well the dough 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.470
 once well kneaded we give it shape to 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.690
 ball and we keep it in a container 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.400
 hermetic or covered with one or two cloths 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.680
 wet for a couple of hours in a 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.420
 warm place and no currents after 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.430
 let it rest the dough should have 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.020
 grown about twice the 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.940
 we take out of the container and in a 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.710
 smooth floured surface we had 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.610
 new and little by little we are giving it shape 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.610
 to our pons 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.810
 with this mass we have made two 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:58.400
 Roscón is one bigger and one more 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:02.110
 small but you can make a bigger one 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.110
 or make two medium 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.000
 if we are going to make the roscones we separate 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.009
 the dough and we knead each of them 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.319
 shaping it and making the hole with 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.239
 the fingers 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.769
 keep in mind that the hole will be made 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.870
 smaller when baking it so it's 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:17.579
 convenient to make it bigger 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.620
 we must let it rest again during 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:22.360
 approximately one hour well covered 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.310
 and in a hot place 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.650
 a good trick is to light the oven 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.780
 previously at 50 degrees centigrade and 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.340
 turn it off then put the roscones in 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.190
 the oven turned off so they stay 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.540
 hot we can finally paint 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.550
 our the roscones with egg and 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.020
 decorate them to our liking we can 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.690
 use the classic frosty fruit 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.910
 candied oranges sugar almonds 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.680
 glas or what we like most is also 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.980
 the moment you hide the little figurine 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:50.020
 well inside the mass once our 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.060
 roscones are decorated the get into 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.340
 the oven preheated to 180 degrees 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.320
 for about 20 minutes if we have a 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.780
 small roscón is probably ready 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.790
 at 15 minutes we take them out we leave them 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.950
 cool a little and if we like we can 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:06.690
 cut them in half and fill them 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:08.520
 cream truffle or our favorite stuffing 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.890

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:13.200
