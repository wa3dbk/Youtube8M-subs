 we were patting as if for me 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.030

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.310
 reflection because you did not laugh because 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:51.780

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.290
 and for all the excess to all this excess 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.550
 when you get the oil it's going to start 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:36.340

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.960
 at the end to rectify with freedom 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.789

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:24.010
 in a dish like this we're going to bathe 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:25.450

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.630

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:48.889
 this as it is that she does not always 

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:50.930

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:54.220
 al is soft the baths with sauce and 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:57.220
