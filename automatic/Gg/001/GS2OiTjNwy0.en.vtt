first<00:00:41.160> I<00:00:41.399> was<00:00:41.550> slightly<00:00:41.790> skeptical<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.809> whole

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
first I was slightly skeptical the whole

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
thing I didn't I didn't I guess I was

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.619 
thing I didn't I didn't I guess I was
even<00:00:48.300> a<00:00:48.450> little<00:00:48.690> disappointed<00:00:49.260> but<00:00:50.449> that<00:00:51.449> was

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
even a little disappointed but that was

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.779 
even a little disappointed but that was
you<00:00:51.809> know<00:00:51.870> before<00:00:52.020> I<00:00:52.260> saw<00:00:53.010> what<00:00:53.250> happened<00:00:53.460> with

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
you know before I saw what happened with

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.290 
you know before I saw what happened with
it<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.440> within<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.590> few<00:00:56.010> rehearsals<00:00:56.940> I<00:00:57.059> mean<00:00:57.210> it

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
it and within a few rehearsals I mean it

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.880 
it and within a few rehearsals I mean it
was<00:00:57.390> obvious<00:00:57.809> that<00:00:57.840> it<00:00:58.109> was<00:00:58.170> an<00:00:58.500> interesting

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
was obvious that it was an interesting

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.840 
was obvious that it was an interesting
sound<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.670> be<00:00:59.820> a<00:00:59.850> part<00:01:00.149> of<00:01:01.219> for<00:01:02.219> this<00:01:02.370> group<00:01:02.609> I

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
sound to be a part of for this group I

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.700 
sound to be a part of for this group I
could<00:01:03.149> come<00:01:03.510> up<00:01:03.660> with<00:01:03.780> arrangements<00:01:04.229> and

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
could come up with arrangements and

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.679 
could come up with arrangements and
since<00:01:05.070> most<00:01:05.640> of<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:05.909> other<00:01:06.119> people<00:01:06.210> weren't

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
since most of the other people weren't

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.530 
since most of the other people weren't
into<00:01:07.140> arranging<00:01:07.530> they<00:01:08.430> were<00:01:08.490> thrilled<00:01:09.299> just

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
into arranging they were thrilled just

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.910 
into arranging they were thrilled just
to<00:01:09.689> have<00:01:09.869> anything<00:01:10.080> that<00:01:10.380> made<00:01:10.530> us<00:01:10.680> sound

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
to have anything that made us sound

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.710 
to have anything that made us sound
better<00:01:11.369> than<00:01:11.520> just<00:01:11.880> playing<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.240> melodies

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
better than just playing the melodies

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.810 
better than just playing the melodies
together<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:13.439> yes<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:13.860> so<00:01:14.310> it<00:01:14.430> gave<00:01:14.520> me<00:01:14.729> an

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
together and yes and so it gave me an

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.899 
together and yes and so it gave me an
outlet<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.180> try<00:01:15.479> things<00:01:15.540> with<00:01:16.700> people<00:01:17.700> that<00:01:17.820> I

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
outlet to try things with people that I

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.670 
outlet to try things with people that I
was<00:01:18.030> comfortable<00:01:18.270> with<00:01:18.570> I<00:01:18.840> wrote<00:01:19.229> my<00:01:19.439> first

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
was comfortable with I wrote my first

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.130 
was comfortable with I wrote my first
piece<00:01:19.979> for<00:01:20.729> them<00:01:20.880> probably<00:01:21.600> in<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.720> course<00:01:21.990> of

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
piece for them probably in the course of

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.280 
piece for them probably in the course of
three<00:01:22.380> days<00:01:22.500> of<00:01:22.979> just<00:01:23.670> doing<00:01:24.509> nothing<00:01:24.840> but

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
three days of just doing nothing but

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.039 
three days of just doing nothing but
that<00:01:25.560> we<00:01:25.890> performed<00:01:26.460> it<00:01:26.700> at<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.270> that<00:01:27.840> went

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
that we performed it at the that went

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.359 
that we performed it at the that went
over<00:01:28.200> fine<00:01:28.700> no<00:01:29.700> great<00:01:30.119> mistakes<00:01:31.369> ironically

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
over fine no great mistakes ironically

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.050 
over fine no great mistakes ironically
with<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.759> lab<00:01:32.939> end<00:01:33.439> my<00:01:34.439> writing<00:01:35.009> has<00:01:35.189> kind<00:01:35.970> of

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
with the lab end my writing has kind of

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.630 
with the lab end my writing has kind of
brought<00:01:36.540> me<00:01:36.570> to<00:01:36.960> a<00:01:36.990> more<00:01:37.320> central<00:01:37.890> role<00:01:37.920> than<00:01:38.610> I

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
brought me to a more central role than I

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.999 
brought me to a more central role than I
might<00:01:38.970> have<00:01:39.240> otherwise<00:01:39.540> but<00:01:40.320> it<00:01:40.470> does<00:01:40.829> allow

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
might have otherwise but it does allow

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.990 
might have otherwise but it does allow
me<00:01:41.630> to<00:01:42.630> express<00:01:43.439> my<00:01:43.799> ideas<00:01:43.829> in<00:01:44.399> my<00:01:44.520> creativity

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
me to express my ideas in my creativity

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.800 
me to express my ideas in my creativity
without<00:01:46.340> having<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.520> be<00:01:49.189> so<00:01:50.450> much<00:01:51.450> in<00:01:51.689> the

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
without having to be so much in the

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.440 
without having to be so much in the
spotlight<00:01:52.079> I<00:01:52.500> tend<00:01:53.490> to<00:01:53.549> think<00:01:53.640> that<00:01:54.060> when

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
spotlight I tend to think that when

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.690 
spotlight I tend to think that when
writing<00:01:54.780> music<00:01:55.290> I'm<00:01:55.470> almost<00:01:55.860> writing<00:01:56.340> the

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
writing music I'm almost writing the

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.550 
writing music I'm almost writing the
same<00:01:56.909> piece<00:01:57.180> over<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:57.689> over<00:01:57.780> again<00:01:57.960> trying<00:01:58.439> to

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
same piece over and over again trying to

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.100 
same piece over and over again trying to
get<00:01:58.680> it<00:01:58.740> right
