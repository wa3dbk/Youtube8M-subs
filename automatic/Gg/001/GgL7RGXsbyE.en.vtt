00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:10.960
 Up to now the case was clear 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.940
 Floor heating is complicated to assemble 

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:16.720
 it is impossible to warm up the entire office or flat 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.240
 and certainly it can not be combined with the simultaneous muting of the floor. 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.280
 Now, however, everything has changed 

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:27.740
 you will find out if you give me just 2.5 minutes of your valuable time. 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.960
 See how to install the Profi Acoustic System. 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.320
 What do you need to do first? 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.680
 Prepare the room, choose tools and design work. 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.940
 Yes! But it's obvious to all of you professionals. 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.020
 Installation of edge tape and dilatation is usually the last facility 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.100
 and then only torment. 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.200
 Not this time! 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.920
 Everything is simple here. 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.080
 We start the installation of underfloor heating. 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:54.880
 Remember this name 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.900
 Profi Acoustic System. 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.400
 In the west, they talk about him weekend 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.840
 and that's because if you start installing underfloor heating on a Friday afternoon 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.380
 On Monday the investor can move into his warm apartment. 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.900
 First, we arrange the elements of the floating floor 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.700
 profiled wood fiber panels 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.140
 which not only isolate 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.840
 but also perfectly dampen any noises. 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.300
 We can also stick them permanently. 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.260
 For gluing we can use adhesive glue companies 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.540
 Sopro, Mapei, Atlas. 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.600
 What is important, we glue the panels full-surface. 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.320
 Now we are assembling transmission elements made of aluminum sheet. 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.900
 We achieve this by pressing the omega element 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.120
 in milling the system board. 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.720
 Piping installation. 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.840
 The next stage, as simple as before and after. 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:54.100
 The pipes are assembled by pressing the cable into the omega hole of the transmission sheet. 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.440
 I said well? 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:56.660
 Very good! 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.340
 And now the cabinet 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:04.940
 and a distributor in it. 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.220
 Distribution cabinets can be surface-mounted and flush-mounted like this. 

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:13.280
 In addition to the manifold equipped with a separating valve 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.060
 and regulating valves 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.040
 the cabinet should be located. 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.780
 Power bar 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.060
 and return 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.420
 equipped with vents and flow meters. 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.380
 In the sub-distributor area, we install a sheet of transmission sheet. 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.900
 The divider and cabinet are already on the wall. 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.240
 Once the manifold is in place, it must be connected to the system. 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.440
 We make approaches and then connect individual loops to them 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:46.940
 and the matter settled. 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.560
 Floor heating Profi Acoustic system is properly installed. 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.440
 But before we fill it 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.280
 The entire pipeline must be rinsed with clean water and a pressure test. 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.200
 It is absolutely necessary. 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.640
 And from all this, the floor that will warm up our whole house begins to emerge. 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.440
 For this to happen under the target layer of the floor, we put a foundation 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.700
 it can be a top plate like in this case. 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.960
 Or on adhesive mortar reinforced with a mat armed with fiberglass mesh. 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.580
 A floor covering will be placed here 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.820
 however, I exchanged two types of undercoat, because our system works well for all types of floors. 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:35.740
 With ceramic tiles, stone panels, parquets, and even as in this case carpets. 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:42.620
 The floor in the Profi System The Acoustic system is very warm 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.680
 and very quiet. 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.780
 That you would expect from a woman, what? 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:59.880
 It's really that simple? 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:00.440
 Sure! 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.960
 Is it really so quiet? 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:02.860
 Really! 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:04.880
 And why are we whispering? 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.680
 I do not know, I really have no idea.
