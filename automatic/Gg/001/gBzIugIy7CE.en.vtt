00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.140
 just a normal complete moment 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.579
 I've been running of course lately 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.869

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:29.340

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.930
 anyway youtube to do 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.969
 I pull out about another half a day 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.379

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.850
 to bring out 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.160

 the must comes take on the computer and that 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.840
 is quite a lot of work what I am up to 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.920
 computer a big zero but anyways me 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.079
 try a lot comes the fire 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.610
 bring out and complete at life 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.560
 that is fairly easy because you play 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.820
 take a pot that one leg or 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.960
 you go well or badly 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.640
 and you bring that out you give one 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.049
 few tips and tricks and that's where I want it 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.670
 also quickly about because my 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.240
 channel is all about tips and 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.860
 tricks 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.299
 I mainly try to get you from p 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.189
 make in call of duty and 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.930
 so far it works that follow me pretty well 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.610
 well what the last one gets I so 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.900
 many comments in from jan i have my 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.430

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.700
 jan i have my very first boxset you 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.620
 achieved and that's commons, I think 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.150
 nice to read and on the abyss 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.010
 Depression in it's work is also in Lucca 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.140
 this me and use the fall at the w 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.010
 osb with flexchair scoop thomas 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.659
 expert team 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.280
 reset your over or is it and 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.860
 the escort red again and he scored 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.150
 is according to me 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.229
 7212 or something so it's not really one 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.430
 special game 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.600
 but just nice gameplay to go to 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.490
 to watch but so my turns there 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.990
 channel actually to roon those tips 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.369
 and tricks to keep you better 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.409
 make in collar shirt and according to me 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.210
 that works pretty well at the moment because 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.680
 I actually give each video a different one 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.850
 tips and tricks sometimes repeat queer 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.439
 just a little and then just 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.000
 to read animal actions from you that is 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.619
 really just cool and then the get over 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.060
 boys' motivation we just make 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.560
 a live complete that is unevenly complete 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.390
 you have another live you complete and try 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.220
 to bring a little variation into it 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.570
 a lot of steam just with sometimes this one 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.860
 marry again for multi-tier now on the 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.329
 background game praises tries so much 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.950
 possible variation 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.989
 account other call again or 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.430
 duty last means edgar was purchased 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.900
 just the complete you come online 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.620
 very first pot is also in the 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.970
 put description 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.069
 and I hope you just still 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.630
 always like it and how big 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.400
 to like their song and has true 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.480
 Jan I'm gonna watch me watch your channel 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.890
 I also think it's best what I do 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.290
 just for fun I also stay ahead 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.549
 the mole 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.049
 and then it will be fine 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:27.700
 but the idea of abyss is therefore an u 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:30.219
 clear cache again from me and atmosphere in one 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.379
 party with russian jesse and back still there 

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:34.420
 someone that other roger who worked after 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:36.280
 my mind forgotten leftover 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.810
 basically little pain now stand at the bottom 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.370
 it was just a shot 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.980
 and you see it here what i am a 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.390
 a little bit out of the sponge I remain praising 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.819
 of course play with the fll 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.530
 and fael is a long-range weapon and 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:49.030
 of course it kind of him at studios 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.379
 distance folder so you really need it 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.069
 just remote leader of the and you 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:52.299
 biesbosch 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:53.590
 you shouldn't run for it 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:55.389
 And you also need if you have one and one mission 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.129
 are not entitled to the enemy or run 

00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:58.629
 but actually a try of the long 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:59.889
 to shoot off distances 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:01.180
 you can simply mention that you do that 

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:03.280
 easy and you learn how to get in 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.750
 because the fll is a super chill weapon 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.250
 just use two bullets in on it 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.989
 wisbecq a hypothesis are immediately dead 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.700
 three bullets on very long distances 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:11.319
 in a place and they are dead because of how 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.939
 further away you are going to shoot with the 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:14.200
 weapon the less damage is with 

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:15.730
 Some of them seem like singers to me 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.319
 just that the term is just the same 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.939
 stops racing 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:20.530
 shirt race and or his long race but that 

00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:22.090
 just something special in place or two 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.590
 usually so that the further you go 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.700
 shoot the more cores you need to 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.109
 to kill enemy 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.459
 especially with the search engines what on the 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:29.290
 Search engines can of course also be long 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:31.000
 when setting up and long barrel means that 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.379
 the damage remains about the same 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.129
 the long distances for the master then 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:34.329
 didn't know yet 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:36.040
 but i have here the now color i am making 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:37.419
 on this they give a pill and 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.949
 then I unfortunately die by tapping 

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:40.840
 file that power that guy up here 

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:42.340
 state cam with the claim there was already dead 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.840
 can only be seen on a taste jumpstart and 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.069
 so i searched a bit of oh guys 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.690
 he is still alive and then one shot 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:48.639
 all mission that and miss miss smith more 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.720
 Miss Junk shot was to bring a fish but 

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:50.859
 once you get the final kill i allowed him again 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.180
