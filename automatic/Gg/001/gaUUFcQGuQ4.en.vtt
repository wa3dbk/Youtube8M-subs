00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:02.180 
well different um get a close-up of the
two<00:04:58.590> of<00:04:58.740> them<00:04:58.890> together<00:05:00.590> Ironhide<00:05:01.590> as<00:05:01.740> a<00:05:01.770> much

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
two of them together Ironhide as a much

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:05.150 
two of them together Ironhide as a much
smaller<00:05:02.580> head<00:05:03.290> compelled<00:05:04.290> it<00:05:04.470> compared<00:05:05.070> to

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 
smaller head compelled it compared to

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.330 
smaller head compelled it compared to
trail<00:05:05.400> cutter<00:05:05.640> and<00:05:06.410> I<00:05:07.410> don't<00:05:07.770> know<00:05:07.860> I'm<00:05:08.130> just

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 
trail cutter and I don't know I'm just

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.130 
trail cutter and I don't know I'm just
really<00:05:08.790> diggin<00:05:09.180> on<00:05:09.270> trail<00:05:09.570> cutter<00:05:09.840> here<00:05:10.080> I

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:10.140 
really diggin on trail cutter here I

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.590 
really diggin on trail cutter here I
think<00:05:10.350> it's<00:05:10.470> easy<00:05:10.710> to<00:05:10.919> really<00:05:11.430> nice<00:05:11.669> nicely

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:12.600 
think it's easy to really nice nicely

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:17.390 
think it's easy to really nice nicely
done<00:05:13.460> update<00:05:14.460> to<00:05:15.000> the<00:05:15.210> Ironhide<00:05:15.630> mold<00:05:15.990> I<00:05:16.830> think

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
done update to the Ironhide mold I think

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.310

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:57.570 
red on the Autobot symbol on the chest

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:59.620 
red on the Autobot symbol on the chest
is<00:05:57.810> a<00:05:57.840> lot<00:05:58.080> brighter<00:05:58.380> a<00:05:58.560> lot<00:05:58.770> easier<00:05:58.950> to<00:05:59.220> see

00:05:59.620 --> 00:05:59.630 
is a lot brighter a lot easier to see

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:04.520 
is a lot brighter a lot easier to see
I'm<00:06:00.630> same<00:06:01.080> articulation<00:06:02.360> you<00:06:03.360> got<00:06:03.480> the<00:06:03.660> arm<00:06:04.290> on

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:04.530 
I'm same articulation you got the arm on

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:07.100 
I'm same articulation you got the arm on
a<00:06:04.590> ball<00:06:04.860> joint<00:06:04.890> or<00:06:05.630> believe<00:06:06.630> it's<00:06:06.780> a<00:06:06.900> ball

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:07.110 
a ball joint or believe it's a ball

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:08.390 
a ball joint or believe it's a ball
joint<00:06:07.289> yes<00:06:07.560> yes<00:06:07.950> it<00:06:08.070> is

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400 
joint yes yes it is

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:12.800 
joint yes yes it is
and<00:06:09.120> then<00:06:09.740> the<00:06:10.740> this<00:06:11.460> part<00:06:12.060> of<00:06:12.180> the<00:06:12.270> arm<00:06:12.449> is<00:06:12.720> on

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:12.810 
and then the this part of the arm is on

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:17.210 
and then the this part of the arm is on
a<00:06:12.870> swivel<00:06:13.669> um<00:06:14.669> the<00:06:15.330> elbow<00:06:15.750> can<00:06:16.020> go<00:06:16.199> up<00:06:16.889> and<00:06:17.100> down

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:17.220 
a swivel um the elbow can go up and down

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:18.770 
a swivel um the elbow can go up and down
that's<00:06:17.460> not<00:06:17.520> the<00:06:17.729> elbows<00:06:18.030> a<00:06:18.180> bulge<00:06:18.419> might<00:06:18.630> as

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:18.780 
that's not the elbows a bulge might as

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:20.810 
that's not the elbows a bulge might as
well<00:06:18.990> so<00:06:19.289> you<00:06:19.350> can<00:06:19.530> get<00:06:20.070> some<00:06:20.220> twist<00:06:20.550> out<00:06:20.789> of

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:20.820 
well so you can get some twist out of

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:27.310 
well so you can get some twist out of
that<00:06:21.120> um<00:06:23.449> the<00:06:24.449> head<00:06:24.660> I<00:06:24.900> believe<00:06:25.350> actually<00:06:25.830> is

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:27.320 
that um the head I believe actually is

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:30.469 
that um the head I believe actually is
now<00:06:28.320> the<00:06:28.380> head<00:06:28.530> doesn't<00:06:28.770> move<00:06:28.919> but<00:06:29.490> that's

00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:30.479 
now the head doesn't move but that's

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:33.790 
now the head doesn't move but that's
fine<00:06:30.780> it's<00:06:31.080> not<00:06:31.289> really<00:06:31.500> a<00:06:31.530> big<00:06:31.560> deal<00:06:32.300> no<00:06:33.300> waste

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:33.800 
fine it's not really a big deal no waste

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.890 
fine it's not really a big deal no waste
articulation<00:06:34.800> the<00:06:35.340> hips<00:06:36.060> are<00:06:36.270> ball<00:06:36.449> joints

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:36.900 
articulation the hips are ball joints

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:41.750 
articulation the hips are ball joints
and<00:06:37.160> then<00:06:38.160> he<00:06:38.250> has<00:06:38.430> a<00:06:38.460> hip<00:06:40.370> the<00:06:41.370> knee<00:06:41.430> joint

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:41.760 
and then he has a hip the knee joint

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:45.580 
and then he has a hip the knee joint
there<00:06:43.100> you<00:06:44.100> get<00:06:44.250> a<00:06:44.280> little<00:06:44.490> bit<00:06:44.699> of<00:06:44.729> ankle<00:06:44.970> tilt

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:45.590 
there you get a little bit of ankle tilt

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:49.129 
there you get a little bit of ankle tilt
because<00:06:46.590> of<00:06:46.919> the<00:06:47.039> transformation<00:06:47.639> and<00:06:48.360> he's

00:06:49.129 --> 00:06:49.139 
because of the transformation and he's

00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:52.400 
because of the transformation and he's
got<00:06:49.410> some<00:06:49.620> toe<00:06:49.979> toe<00:06:50.760> movement<00:06:51.300> as<00:06:51.419> well<00:06:51.660> so<00:06:52.320> you

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:52.410 
got some toe toe movement as well so you

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:54.350 
got some toe toe movement as well so you
definitely<00:06:52.650> get<00:06:53.130> some<00:06:53.310> decent<00:06:53.490> poses<00:06:54.060> out<00:06:54.240> of

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:54.360 
definitely get some decent poses out of

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:59.240 
definitely get some decent poses out of
this<00:06:54.449> guy<00:06:54.720> um<00:06:56.780> absolutely<00:06:57.780> you<00:06:58.410> can<00:06:58.650> take<00:06:59.100> his

different<00:07:27.389> toy<00:07:28.250> just<00:07:29.250> because<00:07:29.490> of<00:07:29.580> the

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:29.610 
different toy just because of the

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:32.089 
different toy just because of the
contrast<00:07:30.180> in<00:07:30.360> color<00:07:30.740> even<00:07:31.740> though<00:07:31.830> it's<00:07:31.949> still

00:07:32.089 --> 00:07:32.099 
contrast in color even though it's still

00:07:32.099 --> 00:07:34.850 
contrast in color even though it's still
mainly<00:07:32.940> black<00:07:33.270> and<00:07:33.630> red<00:07:33.810> where<00:07:34.139> Ironhide<00:07:34.740> is

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:34.860 
mainly black and red where Ironhide is

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:37.370 
mainly black and red where Ironhide is
black<00:07:35.130> and<00:07:35.310> red<00:07:35.520> it's<00:07:35.729> just<00:07:35.940> the<00:07:36.090> the<00:07:36.449> the

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:37.380 
black and red it's just the the the

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:40.460 
black and red it's just the the the
inverse<00:07:37.770> of<00:07:37.979> the<00:07:38.099> colors<00:07:38.490> really<00:07:39.479> really<00:07:40.289> does

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:40.470
