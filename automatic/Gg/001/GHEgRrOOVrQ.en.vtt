okie<00:00:16.110> dokie<00:00:17.240> Sam<00:00:18.240> I<00:00:19.160> I<00:00:20.160> was<00:00:20.790> asked<00:00:21.029> a<00:00:21.060> question

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
okie dokie Sam I I was asked a question

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.210 
okie dokie Sam I I was asked a question
through<00:00:21.510> Facebook<00:00:21.900> and<00:00:22.110> this<00:00:22.470> question<00:00:22.980> was

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
through Facebook and this question was

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.760 
through Facebook and this question was
should<00:00:23.700> I<00:00:24.240> use<00:00:24.390> a<00:00:24.420> juicer<00:00:24.660> or<00:00:25.290> should<00:00:25.560> I<00:00:25.619> use<00:00:25.740> a

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:25.770 
should I use a juicer or should I use a

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.210 
should I use a juicer or should I use a
blender<00:00:26.660> I<00:00:27.680> personally<00:00:28.680> think<00:00:28.949> this<00:00:29.130> is<00:00:29.190> a

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
blender I personally think this is a

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.790 
blender I personally think this is a
fabulous<00:00:29.490> question<00:00:30.180> I<00:00:30.420> think<00:00:30.840> even<00:00:31.380> a<00:00:31.529> lot<00:00:31.680> of

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
fabulous question I think even a lot of

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.090 
fabulous question I think even a lot of
the<00:00:32.449> experts<00:00:33.449> in<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.600> field<00:00:33.920> failed<00:00:34.920> to

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
the experts in the field failed to

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.049 
the experts in the field failed to
understand<00:00:35.519> the<00:00:35.670> difference<00:00:35.970> between

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
understand the difference between

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.900 
understand the difference between
juicing<00:00:36.570> and<00:00:36.720> blending<00:00:36.809> I<00:00:37.370> think<00:00:38.370> in<00:00:38.460> order<00:00:38.640> to

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
juicing and blending I think in order to

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.100 
juicing and blending I think in order to
really<00:00:39.030> understand<00:00:39.570> what<00:00:39.660> juicing<00:00:39.960> can

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
really understand what juicing can

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.570 
really understand what juicing can
accomplish<00:00:40.379> you<00:00:40.920> have<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.160> understand<00:00:41.489> a

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:41.580 
accomplish you have to understand a

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.120 
accomplish you have to understand a
little<00:00:41.760> bit<00:00:41.970> about<00:00:42.330> the<00:00:43.110> human<00:00:43.380> anatomy<00:00:43.800> so

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:44.130 
little bit about the human anatomy so

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:46.370 
little bit about the human anatomy so
we're<00:00:44.460> going<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:44.640> start<00:00:44.820> their<00:00:45.200> majority<00:00:46.200> of

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:46.380 
we're going to start their majority of

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.380 
we're going to start their majority of
America's<00:00:46.920> intestinal<00:00:47.340> tracts<00:00:47.640> have<00:00:47.880> adapted

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
America's intestinal tracts have adapted

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.540 
America's intestinal tracts have adapted
to<00:00:48.420> their<00:00:48.570> environment<00:00:49.050> because<00:00:50.040> most<00:00:50.340> of<00:00:50.460> the

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
to their environment because most of the

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.090 
to their environment because most of the
food<00:00:50.700> that<00:00:50.760> we<00:00:51.000> eat<00:00:51.350> tends<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.440> create<00:00:52.620> damaged

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
food that we eat tends to create damaged

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.310 
food that we eat tends to create damaged
lining<00:00:53.489> of<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.579> intestines<00:00:54.090> so<00:00:54.840> what<00:00:55.079> the

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
lining of the intestines so what the

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.380 
lining of the intestines so what the
intestines<00:00:55.829> have<00:00:55.980> done<00:00:56.250> is<00:00:56.610> they've<00:00:57.239> created

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
intestines have done is they've created

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.610 
intestines have done is they've created
like<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:58.039> thick<00:00:59.039> coating<00:01:00.170> to<00:01:01.170> surround<00:01:01.500> the

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
like a thick coating to surround the

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.439 
like a thick coating to surround the
lining<00:01:01.949> of<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.039> intestines<00:01:02.520> this<00:01:02.940> is<00:01:03.120> great

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
lining of the intestines this is great

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:04.850 
lining of the intestines this is great
because<00:01:03.750> it<00:01:03.960> keeps<00:01:04.110> us<00:01:04.259> from<00:01:04.379> toxic<00:01:04.739> overload

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
because it keeps us from toxic overload

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.270 
because it keeps us from toxic overload
at<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:06.030> same<00:01:06.300> time<00:01:06.619> what<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.649> large<00:01:07.979> amount<00:01:08.220> of

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
at the same time what a large amount of

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.920 
at the same time what a large amount of
people<00:01:08.490> fail<00:01:08.700> to<00:01:08.729> understand<00:01:09.300> is<00:01:09.450> that<00:01:09.509> a<00:01:09.690> lot

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
people fail to understand is that a lot

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.660 
people fail to understand is that a lot
of<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.170> absorption<00:01:10.530> of<00:01:10.710> nutrients<00:01:11.250> happens

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
of the absorption of nutrients happens

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.880 
of the absorption of nutrients happens
in<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.180> lining<00:01:12.390> of<00:01:12.509> the<00:01:12.570> intestines<00:01:13.110> so<00:01:13.740> when

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
in the lining of the intestines so when

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.620 
in the lining of the intestines so when
there's<00:01:14.039> a<00:01:14.100> thick<00:01:14.549> coating<00:01:15.030> around<00:01:15.390> the

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
there's a thick coating around the

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.210 
there's a thick coating around the
lining<00:01:15.930> of<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.020> intestines<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.650> lot<00:01:16.890> of<00:01:16.920> the

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
lining of the intestines a lot of the

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.440 
lining of the intestines a lot of the
nutrition<00:01:17.580> is<00:01:17.850> not<00:01:18.000> getting<00:01:18.270> absorbed

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
nutrition is not getting absorbed

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.780 
nutrition is not getting absorbed
through<00:01:18.960> our<00:01:19.080> foods<00:01:19.350> so<00:01:19.860> when<00:01:20.490> you<00:01:20.580> pull<00:01:20.760> out

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
through our foods so when you pull out

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.179 
through our foods so when you pull out
an<00:01:21.000> apple<00:01:21.360> eat<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.990> apple<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:22.680> expect<00:01:23.010> to<00:01:23.100> get

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
an apple eat the apple you expect to get

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.010 
an apple eat the apple you expect to get
what's<00:01:23.340> in<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.549> Apple<00:01:23.909> but<00:01:24.479> a<00:01:24.510> lot<00:01:24.689> of<00:01:24.750> times

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
what's in the Apple but a lot of times

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.980 
what's in the Apple but a lot of times
you're<00:01:25.200> not<00:01:26.090> that's<00:01:27.090> just<00:01:27.330> that's<00:01:27.720> how<00:01:27.900> it

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
you're not that's just that's how it

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.870 
you're not that's just that's how it
works<00:01:28.200> that's<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:29.040> big<00:01:29.189> part<00:01:29.340> of<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.520> price<00:01:29.729> for

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
works that's a big part of the price for

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.399 
works that's a big part of the price for
that<00:01:29.970> we<00:01:30.119> pay<00:01:30.420> for<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.869> types<00:01:31.049> of<00:01:31.170> foods<00:01:31.350> that

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
that we pay for the types of foods that

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.100 
that we pay for the types of foods that
we've<00:01:31.560> been<00:01:31.680> eating<00:01:32.070> I<00:01:32.900> personally<00:01:33.900> believe

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
we've been eating I personally believe

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.520 
we've been eating I personally believe
that<00:01:34.439> this<00:01:34.560> malnutrition<00:01:35.490> is<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:36.720> big<00:01:37.290> reason

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
that this malnutrition is a big reason

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.200 
that this malnutrition is a big reason
for<00:01:37.710> disease<00:01:38.220> I<00:01:38.250> think<00:01:38.670> it's<00:01:38.790> actually<00:01:39.090> the

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
for disease I think it's actually the

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.710 
for disease I think it's actually the
number<00:01:39.600> one<00:01:39.750> cause<00:01:39.960> for<00:01:40.020> disease<00:01:41.659> from<00:01:42.659> the

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
number one cause for disease from the

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.080 
number one cause for disease from the
day<00:01:42.960> you<00:01:43.020> stop<00:01:43.409> absorbing<00:01:43.950> nutrition<00:01:44.670> your

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
day you stop absorbing nutrition your

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.270 
day you stop absorbing nutrition your
body<00:01:45.329> will<00:01:45.570> only<00:01:45.750> break<00:01:45.990> down<00:01:46.229> now<00:01:47.040> that<00:01:47.189> you

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
body will only break down now that you

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.370 
body will only break down now that you
understand<00:01:47.670> how<00:01:48.030> that<00:01:48.509> works<00:01:48.869> a<00:01:49.049> little<00:01:49.170> bit

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
understand how that works a little bit

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.499 
understand how that works a little bit
we<00:01:49.710> can<00:01:49.799> get<00:01:49.920> back<00:01:50.070> to<00:01:50.189> juicing<00:01:50.520> so<00:01:51.299> what

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
we can get back to juicing so what

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.120 
we can get back to juicing so what
juicing<00:01:51.869> does<00:01:52.049> is<00:01:52.320> it<00:01:52.409> removes<00:01:52.650> the<00:01:52.770> fibers

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
juicing does is it removes the fibers

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.889 
juicing does is it removes the fibers
when<00:01:53.549> it<00:01:53.640> removes<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.030> fibers<00:01:54.390> it's<00:01:54.600> also

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
when it removes the fibers it's also

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.960 
when it removes the fibers it's also
removing<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.470> calories<00:01:55.860> what<00:01:56.460> remains<00:01:56.790> in

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
removing the calories what remains in

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.550 
removing the calories what remains in
the<00:01:57.060> juices<00:01:57.390> of<00:01:57.420> carbohydrates<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.350> water

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
the juices of carbohydrates the water

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.800 
the juices of carbohydrates the water
the<00:01:59.040> vitamins<00:01:59.490> and<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.640> minerals<00:01:59.820> because

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
the vitamins and the minerals because

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.830

that fast absorption is that if your

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.860 
that fast absorption is that if your

from fruit

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.030 
from fruit
you're<00:02:23.900> going<00:02:24.019> to<00:02:24.079> be<00:02:24.200> getting<00:02:24.319> those<00:02:24.620> spikes

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
you're going to be getting those spikes

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.740 
you're going to be getting those spikes
in<00:02:25.430> your<00:02:25.579> blood<00:02:25.790> sugar<00:02:26.030> and<00:02:26.269> that's<00:02:26.569> not

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
in your blood sugar and that's not

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.399 
in your blood sugar and that's not
necessarily<00:02:27.110> a<00:02:27.230> good<00:02:27.439> thing<00:02:27.500> so<00:02:27.909> the<00:02:28.909> primary

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:29.409 
necessarily a good thing so the primary

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:31.630 
necessarily a good thing so the primary
benefit<00:02:30.409> from<00:02:30.560> juicing<00:02:30.980> comes<00:02:31.250> from<00:02:31.430> when<00:02:31.549> you

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
benefit from juicing comes from when you

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.690 
benefit from juicing comes from when you
juice<00:02:31.909> large<00:02:32.900> amounts<00:02:33.260> of<00:02:33.349> veggies<00:02:33.769> dark

leafy greens and a little bit of fruit

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:39.929 
leafy greens and a little bit of fruit
to<00:02:37.099> mask<00:02:37.310> the<00:02:37.459> taste<00:02:37.609> I<00:02:38.379> would<00:02:39.379> consider

00:02:39.929 --> 00:02:39.939 
to mask the taste I would consider

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:42.759 
to mask the taste I would consider
juicing<00:02:40.939> a<00:02:41.150> source<00:02:41.569> from<00:02:41.900> micro<00:02:42.230> nutrients<00:02:42.650> so

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
juicing a source from micro nutrients so

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:44.250 
juicing a source from micro nutrients so
those<00:02:42.920> are<00:02:43.069> the<00:02:43.099> vitamins<00:02:43.430> of<00:02:43.640> the<00:02:43.700> minerals

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
those are the vitamins of the minerals

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.229 
those are the vitamins of the minerals
now<00:02:45.260> using<00:02:46.040> a<00:02:46.099> blender<00:02:46.430> to<00:02:46.519> make<00:02:46.670> smoothies<00:02:47.090> on

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
now using a blender to make smoothies on

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:49.690 
now using a blender to make smoothies on
the<00:02:47.329> other<00:02:47.450> hand<00:02:47.859> serves<00:02:48.859> another<00:02:49.400> unique

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
the other hand serves another unique

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.330 
the other hand serves another unique
purpose<00:02:50.349> by<00:02:51.349> using<00:02:51.530> a<00:02:51.739> blender<00:02:52.159> you've

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
purpose by using a blender you've

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.339 
purpose by using a blender you've
already<00:02:52.760> made<00:02:52.879> the<00:02:53.030> digestion<00:02:53.359> process<00:02:53.689> so

00:02:54.339 --> 00:02:54.349 
already made the digestion process so

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:56.770 
already made the digestion process so
much<00:02:54.379> easier<00:02:54.939> but<00:02:55.939> because<00:02:56.209> the<00:02:56.329> fibers<00:02:56.659> are

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
much easier but because the fibers are

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.390 
much easier but because the fibers are
still<00:02:56.989> intact<00:02:57.319> you're<00:02:57.829> still<00:02:58.069> getting<00:02:58.189> the

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
still intact you're still getting the

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.729 
still intact you're still getting the
calories<00:02:58.849> and<00:02:59.120> it<00:02:59.810> also<00:02:59.959> asked<00:03:00.290> a<00:03:00.349> complete

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
calories and it also asked a complete

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:02.740 
calories and it also asked a complete
digestion<00:03:01.159> so<00:03:01.879> it's<00:03:02.000> not<00:03:02.120> being<00:03:02.269> absorbed<00:03:02.569> in

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
digestion so it's not being absorbed in

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.270 
digestion so it's not being absorbed in
the<00:03:02.870> stomach<00:03:03.200> it<00:03:03.349> actually<00:03:03.530> has<00:03:03.799> to<00:03:03.980> pass

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
the stomach it actually has to pass

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.220 
the stomach it actually has to pass
through<00:03:04.579> the<00:03:04.730> lining<00:03:05.000> of<00:03:05.060> the<00:03:05.090> intestines<00:03:05.599> so

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
through the lining of the intestines so

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:07.720 
through the lining of the intestines so
because<00:03:06.650> of<00:03:06.680> that<00:03:06.829> instance<00:03:07.489> with<00:03:07.700> the

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
because of that instance with the

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.190 
because of that instance with the
damaged<00:03:08.090> intestines<00:03:08.569> I<00:03:08.780> wouldn't<00:03:09.079> assume

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
damaged intestines I wouldn't assume

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.599 
damaged intestines I wouldn't assume
that<00:03:09.620> you're<00:03:09.739> getting<00:03:09.829> the<00:03:10.129> vitamins<00:03:10.489> and

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:10.609 
that you're getting the vitamins and

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:13.360 
that you're getting the vitamins and
minerals<00:03:10.939> but<00:03:11.930> you<00:03:12.439> are<00:03:12.650> getting<00:03:13.099> a<00:03:13.159> large

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
minerals but you are getting a large

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:14.800 
minerals but you are getting a large
part<00:03:13.639> of<00:03:13.669> carbohydrates<00:03:14.329> from<00:03:14.540> the<00:03:14.629> fructose

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
part of carbohydrates from the fructose

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.830 
part of carbohydrates from the fructose
from<00:03:15.290> the<00:03:15.379> fruit<00:03:15.849> so<00:03:16.849> the<00:03:16.970> real<00:03:17.150> benefit<00:03:17.659> from

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
from the fruit so the real benefit from

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.629 
from the fruit so the real benefit from
smoothies<00:03:18.290> comes<00:03:18.560> from<00:03:18.739> the<00:03:18.829> calories<00:03:19.310> and

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:19.639 
smoothies comes from the calories and

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:22.780 
smoothies comes from the calories and
the<00:03:20.480> energy<00:03:20.659> fruit<00:03:21.500> is<00:03:21.709> a<00:03:21.739> perfect<00:03:22.370> source<00:03:22.579> for

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
the energy fruit is a perfect source for

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.729 
the energy fruit is a perfect source for
energy<00:03:23.120> and<00:03:23.329> it's<00:03:23.900> also<00:03:24.049> a<00:03:24.169> great<00:03:24.319> way<00:03:24.409> to<00:03:24.590> make

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
energy and it's also a great way to make

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:25.690 
energy and it's also a great way to make
sure<00:03:24.769> that<00:03:25.010> you're<00:03:25.040> meeting<00:03:25.280> your<00:03:25.459> caloric

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
sure that you're meeting your caloric

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.159 
sure that you're meeting your caloric
needs<00:03:25.819> for<00:03:26.090> the<00:03:26.150> day<00:03:26.269> when<00:03:26.750> the<00:03:26.840> body<00:03:27.049> is

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:27.169 
needs for the day when the body is

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:29.559 
needs for the day when the body is
either<00:03:27.560> deficient<00:03:28.129> in<00:03:28.250> glucose<00:03:28.669> or<00:03:28.970> calories

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:29.569 
either deficient in glucose or calories

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:32.080 
either deficient in glucose or calories
it<00:03:29.900> tends<00:03:30.139> to<00:03:30.229> go<00:03:30.470> towards<00:03:30.949> starvation<00:03:31.549> so

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
it tends to go towards starvation so

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.300 
it tends to go towards starvation so
symptoms<00:03:32.510> of<00:03:32.659> starvation<00:03:33.139> range<00:03:33.979> anywhere

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
symptoms of starvation range anywhere

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.449 
symptoms of starvation range anywhere
from<00:03:34.370> depression<00:03:35.090> lack<00:03:35.540> of<00:03:35.690> motivation<00:03:36.459> food

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
from depression lack of motivation food

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:40.420 
from depression lack of motivation food
cravings<00:03:38.239> and<00:03:38.540> lack<00:03:38.870> of<00:03:38.900> sex<00:03:39.290> drive<00:03:39.379> which<00:03:40.310> I

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
cravings and lack of sex drive which I

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.009 
cravings and lack of sex drive which I
know<00:03:40.489> is<00:03:40.790> something<00:03:41.209> that<00:03:41.299> I've<00:03:41.479> suffered

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
know is something that I've suffered

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:45.129 
know is something that I've suffered
from<00:03:42.169> in<00:03:42.409> the<00:03:42.500> past<00:03:43.299> also<00:03:44.299> another<00:03:44.479> cool<00:03:44.810> fact

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:45.139 
from in the past also another cool fact

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:47.500 
from in the past also another cool fact
about<00:03:45.260> fruit<00:03:45.620> is<00:03:45.829> fructose<00:03:46.609> doesn't<00:03:47.299> trigger

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
about fruit is fructose doesn't trigger

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.599 
about fruit is fructose doesn't trigger
insulin<00:03:47.989> response<00:03:48.229> so<00:03:48.680> it's<00:03:48.829> also<00:03:48.979> a<00:03:49.099> diabetic
