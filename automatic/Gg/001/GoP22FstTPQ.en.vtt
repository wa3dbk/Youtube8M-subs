00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.120
 well these come to a new video 

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:06.890
 good it seems that a web called 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.330
 micro trend that basically is a 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:11.570
 security company software 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:14.269
 Japanese antivirus has released a recent 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.940
 study about whether we are safe or not 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:18.950
 about online games in our 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:20.660
 console and others that many times then 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:23.540
 we share data that we do not give 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.610
 account in the first piece of the image 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:27.340
 that they have published according to the studies and 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:29.510
 So, basically , then piano comes out 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.460
 company and is four when we use it to 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:34.410
 the augmented reality and such the 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:37.110
 device this like him 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.580
 the play room this we are 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.160
 teaching our room we could 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:43.230
 say then with the kinect 2.0 and its 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.540
 function always on as it can be 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.200
 recognize the audio and other little things not 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.820
 basically, there are no studies to 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.650
 that we are safer or to load 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.930
 more above but good basically 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:57.300
 they share this data they also tell us 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.470
 that we use more than games not ours 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.910
 devices have lately been 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:03.239
 become multimedia devices 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.430
 more than in consoles and we have as 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.470
 device we have like last fm in 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.180
 videos we have leds netflix amazon 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.770
 instant video hd or low youtube in the 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:17.720
 social section facebook twitter and skype 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.850
 and in web internet explorer and sspm 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:23.970
 then they also remind us what happened 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:27.110
 record compression in 2011 70 million d 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:30.210
 accounts were hacked we could say 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:32.610
 committed then also 23,000 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.920
 nintendo club accounts in July 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.740
 2013 were also committed and 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.050
 apart from those 4 million accounts 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.840
 They were also involved in the 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:44.310
 konami then in July 2013 something 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.800
 totally therefore also scandalous 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.900
 especially the precision that were 70 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.910
 million was a bitch there will be variety the 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.720
 I still remember that and mother 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.130
 mine 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.420
 then in the car removed because no no 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.850
 I understand very well what he says I do not know if 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.130
 is that with the eu and the pressure 3 pressure 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:03.119
 4 and then we get in four thousand 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.500
 696 bad pages or is the total of 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.140
 pages that we have put them I do not understand 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.610
 very well in that section that he wants 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.860
 say good if you know it by is to put it 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.630
 in the comments and others then also 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.370
 They remind us that we share 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.220
 too much information more information 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.240
 what we ourselves think 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.580
 logically then the name in the 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.280
 address the last names the email the 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.650
 payment method geolocation 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.080
 and the avatar many times we put our 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.060
 image I include myself in those things 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.620
 many times because we do things 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.209
 without thinking thinking that it does not happen 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.220
 absolutely nothing and always there is 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:37.160
 to be careful who we talk to 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.209
 they also tell us then in the stage save 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.580
 be sure since they tell us that 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.050
 let's take good care with whom 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.910
 we talk where we share the 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.680
 information and others I know it's difficult 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.810
 always read the conditions of use 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.450
 I do not do it they are very long 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:54.050
 Sometimes the vast majority do not read them and 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.820
 then what happens to us happens to us so 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:03:01.550
 well nothing more kids this has been 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.550
 everything and until next time
