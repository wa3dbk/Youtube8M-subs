00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.320
 You can see at first glance that this is urgently water filtering system 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.609
 Water provides the magic of fresh wood is clear 

00:00:11.609 --> 00:00:15.179
 This is the first household water purifier system on the market 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.960
 Combination of patented activated carbon block filter and gets completely 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.169
 Technology based thus it can increase the content of events Palin their drinking water 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:27.529
 Significantly reduce the presence of harmful substances and 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:29.349
 Kill microorganisms 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:33.030
 It's easy to demonstrate how Ispringen the clarity of the water 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.949
 Improves unpleasant odors, eliminates items removed and 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:39.949
 kills potentially dangerous microorganisms 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.030
 so they can see exactly how Dennis brings water filters to work 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.470
 like the various demonstrations with this test unit the one 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.430
 transparent housing has perform 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.500
 "It's not even in Italy 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.840
 the pesticides and disinfectants that are water soluble or themselves 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.590
 completely connect with water so you can see them in tap water again 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.650
 taste can still judge 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.190
 for the following demonstrations, we use a harmless organic 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.240
 Chemicals red food coloring representative of hundreds of 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.980
 tasteless invisible chemicals that may be in 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:19.130
 Tap water will first feel like a glass with the water he previously had 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.300
 contaminated with red food coloring this glass becomes and later to 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.600
 Serve comparison 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.920
 after that they pushed the rest of the contaminated water into it 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.640
 brings water filter system, the device is back together from Stetten's 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:32.440
 on 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.330
 And as they give them plenty of time this brings the organic pollutants right away 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:37.030
 out 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.360
 there he is again 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:39.460
 for glass 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.460
 the result fresh this brings water 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.700
 Frequently, tap water is treated with chlorine. Chlorine is generally not 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.550
 hazardous to health but it contributes to the development of disinfectants 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.090
 Products ready the tap water events wave an unpleasant odor 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.130
 to lend 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.189
 For the most part, the treated water contains only a small amount of gloor for the purpose of ours 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.360
 The demonstration will add chlorine to the bleacher so it smells really strong 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.729
 also Tirol is a sensitive Kührer proof chemical 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.980
 By clear money you have time if chlorine is present 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.980
 «We will now provide this country as a reference 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:21.459
 in the next step we add the chlorine contaminated water in the city 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.479
 Slang water filter system 

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:26.669
 this will clear the chlorine immediately clear 

00:02:26.669 --> 00:02:28.249
 for glass for glass 

00:02:28.249 --> 00:02:31.789
 the unpleasant smell is effectively eliminated 

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:35.919
 Now we take the Rothosen solutions and check if there are still traces of Florent 

00:02:35.919 --> 00:02:37.039
 are holding 

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:39.449
 not even a hint of color 

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:42.359
 and that from the first to the last glass 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:46.299
 This brings us as just clean drinking water with you 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:48.079
 pleasant fresh smell 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:52.150
 In this demonstration, we use dust specifically for laboratory tests 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.689
 This dust was supposed to be the tiny particles in tap water 

00:02:55.689 --> 00:02:59.809
 represent a variety of health risks mountains can 

00:02:59.809 --> 00:03:03.509
 For comparison, we will fill a glass with the contaminated water 

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:06.859
 and pour the rest of the water into Kies Reinfeldt 

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:11.029
 we see how the particles with which this brings activated carbon block fathers efficiently 

00:03:11.029 --> 00:03:12.109
 be removed 

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:15.659
 perfectly clear water thanks Istria 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:20.529
 And most importantly, thanks to the mature technology, staying valuable will remain valuable 

00:03:20.529 --> 00:03:23.659
 Minerals such as calcium and magnesium are obtained 

00:03:24.249 --> 00:03:28.670
 both well water and treated tap water in the waterworks 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:33.130
 Unwanted living organisms can contain bacteria and viruses 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:37.709
 They have now seen how Dennis Rink activated carbon block fathers impurities 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:41.659
 Effectively removed from drinking water in combination with reputation too 

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:46.089
 not in him now this brings over 99% command in 91% of the water 

00:03:46.089 --> 00:03:49.309
 potentially pathogenic bacteria and viruses 

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:53.069
 and gives them and their family is clear and fresh water 

00:03:53.749 --> 00:03:56.869
 it's easy to recognize and demonstrate 

00:03:56.869 --> 00:04:01.459
 that this time in the water filter systems this is justified and clear water 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:02.039
 provides
