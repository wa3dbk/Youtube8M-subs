00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.840
 ld 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.889
 09 series ld is quite old series 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.719
 phoenix company 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:18.090
 she appeared maybe second after 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:20.250
 tactical series and today 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.880
 she is somewhat muffled by others 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.789
 models 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.250
 but nevertheless it is very interesting 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.160
 lights which as a rule 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:31.080
 work from finger batteries although in 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.890
 near future should appear 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:39.660
 new lg 50 and it will already work 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.370
 under two elements 18 650 and in quality 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.480
 light sources use two 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:50.899
 LED and so supplied 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:56.690
 instruction warranty card and 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:01:01.020
 leveled advertising bracelet booklet 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:02.359
 thats simple not all the models in it on 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.549
 indicated 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:08.060
 warranty card store flashlight 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:12.409
 who provided a flashlight not a review 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:18.180
 cream kit and lanyard included 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:24.570
 strong ring cheholchik going to 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:28.560
 the battery pack is already inserted 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.890
 by the manufacturer itself 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.060
 flashlight 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.000
 he eats from one finger 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:39.600
 batteries 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.790
 LED hl5 clip as you understand 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.420
 can be taken unfortunately turn over 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.369
 her and try to hand the heads of us 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:51.270
 impossible also we see that the button 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:55.530
 slightly protrudes from the side of the tail and 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:58.740
 what could be a little bit worse with us 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:01.880
 give the stability of the lantern on the table 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.880
 tail up 

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:08.450
 carving head rectangular profile 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:10.940
 almost no rezinochka 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:16.430
 oiled phoenix in this plan are 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:20.209
 worse in the head there is mechanical protection 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.580
 accidental switch on the tail as I understand it 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:24.410
 not folding 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.420
 the roof inside the lantern can be disassembled 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:32.410
 complete even one positive 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:34.640
 rezinochka only install battery 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.680
 select medi spa how many threads we have 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.180
 an annotated contact is made 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.549
 only on the butt of the hull 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:44.140
 mechanical protection against accidental 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:47.290
 inclusions in the bag during transportation and 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:52.040
 So turn on the flashlight button with us 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:55.160
 tactical and so particular to this 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:57.920
 the button is what it turns on easy 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:03.290
 pushing without clicking and releasing we 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:04.519
 return to the off state to 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.500
 choose the desired mode not to go 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:10.930
 you need to immediately click the desired 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:14.510
 We then fix the modes 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:17.150
 final press to change mode 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.049
 need to turn off the flashlight and re 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:25.540
 click through 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:25.540
 all modes and so should be control 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:30.769
 control of turning his head here 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.400
 already removed canceled because we are not 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:35.989
 anodized carving 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:39.049
 such a cute little lantern and 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:40.900
 phoenix model ld 09 new 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:43.849
 On the market 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:47.750
 nice in the hand and ally 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:50.120
 Jelly Small Pocket Flashlight 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:53.079
 which is quite possible to hang on the key chain 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:56.060
 like keychain on a date chinese keys 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:58.700
 always be at hand and use 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:01.090
 one finger-operated battery to us calmly 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.660
 will give the opportunity to use it 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.430
 quite a long time 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:07.940
 manufacturer claims hryvnia 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:10.699
 maximum brightness of 130 two 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.440
 one and a half hours on nickel metal hydride 

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:16.070
 batteries 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:17.600
 and maximum operating time on brightness 8 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:20.720
 lumen 40 hours 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:23.990
 which is quite enough for such a baby 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:26.680
 it will shine brighter than the key 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:29.360
 type 05 I put steel 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.400
 Well, certainly less bright than other models 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.680
 who use more powerful items 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:38.750
 supply but here we are winning in 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:40.610
 sizes for comparison e25 it uses 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:44.750
 two finger batteries are significantly 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:47.590
 larger and even diameter of its reflector 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.820
 more for more focused light 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:55.460
 those that we get enough 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:58.300
 focused light due to narrow 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.300
 reflector 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:04.280
 minimum brightness eight feet than 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:06.740
 Session to transmit light LEDs such 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:09.080
 tepid little text even in 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:11.330
 leaving a greenish hue as well, not to 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:13.910
 this perception of all flashlight 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:15.860
 nice little and high quality 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:17.810
