00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
talking about the bike now he's got

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.980 
talking about the bike now he's got
quite<00:00:20.789> a<00:00:20.880> group<00:00:21.060> of<00:00:21.210> people<00:00:21.480> down<00:00:21.630> there<00:00:21.660> this

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.330 
quite a group of people down there this
is<00:00:22.109> I<00:00:22.199> guess<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.380> only<00:00:22.680> bike<00:00:22.859> to<00:00:22.980> get<00:00:23.100> to<00:00:23.189> show

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
is I guess the only bike to get to show

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.730 
is I guess the only bike to get to show
off<00:00:23.519> so<00:00:23.789> let's<00:00:24.779> do<00:00:24.869> a<00:00:24.900> little<00:00:25.080> riding<00:00:25.320> and<00:00:25.619> I'll

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
off so let's do a little riding and I'll

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.250 
off so let's do a little riding and I'll
talk<00:00:25.980> about<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.340> way<00:00:26.460> it<00:00:26.550> works<00:00:26.760> now<00:00:27.109> it<00:00:28.109> does

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
talk about the way it works now it does

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.550 
talk about the way it works now it does
have<00:00:28.439> a<00:00:28.470> charge<00:00:28.800> port<00:00:29.189> right<00:00:29.519> there<00:00:30.380> and<00:00:31.380> so

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
have a charge port right there and so

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.139 
have a charge port right there and so
it's<00:00:31.710> all<00:00:31.830> automatic<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.489> bike<00:00:32.669> falls<00:00:32.969> asleep

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
it's all automatic the bike falls asleep

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.569 
it's all automatic the bike falls asleep
on<00:00:33.570> its<00:00:33.719> own<00:00:36.680> in<00:00:37.680> fact<00:00:37.950> it<00:00:38.070> actually<00:00:38.100> looks

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
on its own in fact it actually looks

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.940
