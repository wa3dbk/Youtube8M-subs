00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 Look who's following our channel 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.960
 vision care today our 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.610
 first ask the doctor you send 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.040
 your questions through our website 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.019
 eye clinic dot com 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.059
 As they come, we will 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.060
 recording these videos with the answers 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.070
 of aaaa doctors on top of what they 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.080
 you asked ok 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.330
 in today's video we will respond to 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:28.170
 bruno's first question he asks 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:30.330
 doctor why my eye itches and it hurts 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.489
 both sometimes ne 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.160
 It's a question halfway to the 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:38.790
 Ball here is a question 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.770
 very broad, I think it's a lot 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:45.000
 difficult to answer this is a question of 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:47.039
 internet there are 1 n factors thousands of 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.989
 factors are going to say so that 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.309
 with leave from changes 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:55.289
 as viral conjunctivitis 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:59.789
 allergic conjunctivitis sensitivity to 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:02.280
 light to dust wind depends on air climate 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:05.460
 conditioning sometimes small degrees 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.830
 He has and this can pass is also 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.340
 So I guess that's what I'm going to answer. 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.689
 It really is only through consultation 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.650
 ophthalmologic nÃ© 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:18.119
 he sought an ophthalmologist dn such is 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.369
 make an appointment to know for sure 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.960
 Cause is too broad this question I think 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:26.790
 that he should go through the consultation with 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.950
 The perfect ophthalmologist is 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.500
 another question that ana sheila asks 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.329
 I have a vision problem, I can not 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.990
 look at the light because the brightness 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:39.540
 very strong and the headlight of cars and motorcycles 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.210
 Then a terror is the brightness is very 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.710
 big I was even blind it gets to stay 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.200
 troubled blind 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.360
 I went to an ophthalmologist did it is said 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.460
 which has no degree in the eyes but 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:55.380
 said he has a deviation of the eyes of 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:57.350
 take a test is test etc is help me 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.530
 what could I do 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.119
 this is it if she was already the hospital does not have 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.310
 degree ne 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:06.710
 is sometimes simply a 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.360
 already observed 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:13.459
 that she has a particular patient 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:15.770
 in people who demand sensitivity 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:20.150
 I also think that nothing prevents her 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:23.030
 do another other query back 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.100
 at the ophthalmologist who makes this appointment 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.560
 of tinned pupil instead has greater power of 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.580
 small astigmatism can cause 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.050
 this is not it 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:34.880
 there is the deviation is that it speaks that has in the 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:38.600
 her question 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.550
 I do not think this is a cause in this photo. 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.720
 intense hunger for light sensitivity 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.400
 intense 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.910
 Of course she has a slight detour 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:49.420
 You have to deal with doing these tests is 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.920
 gymnastics physiotherapists 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.799
 physiotherapies are not appropriate for this 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.989
 deviation from her is more often than not people 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:59.920
 unfortunately has a sensitivity to light 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:03.140
 in the same week there is a matter of learning 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:06.170
 to look away when they see the car 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:08.420
 I detour looking at the time for the track. 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.459
 track does not look directly at the 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.260
 truck headlight is it going to 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:14.359
 to bother her so I have to have 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.660
 used subterfuge when you are 

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:20.540
 driving to minimize this bit 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:23.450
 perfect symptomatology 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.220
 good this is this video zinho have wind of 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.320
 answer these two questions as 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.180
 next managements keep sending as 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:31.340
