00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
the tricky part you're going to get your

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.410 
the tricky part you're going to get your
flour<00:01:51.990> mixture<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:52.829> you're<00:01:53.369> going<00:01:53.729> to<00:01:54.000> very

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
flour mixture and you're going to very

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.740 
flour mixture and you're going to very
quickly<00:01:54.950> but<00:01:55.950> neatly<00:01:56.930> unlike<00:01:57.930> I<00:01:58.259> am<00:01:59.119> swirl<00:02:00.119> it

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
quickly but neatly unlike I am swirl it

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.130 
quickly but neatly unlike I am swirl it
around<00:02:00.869> quite<00:02:01.740> thinly<00:02:02.549> you<00:02:02.939> want<00:02:03.450> to<00:02:03.540> try<00:02:03.960> and

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
around quite thinly you want to try and

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.660 
around quite thinly you want to try and
cover<00:02:04.380> up<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.770> holes<00:02:04.979> as<00:02:05.189> quickly<00:02:05.430> as

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
cover up the holes as quickly as

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.779 
cover up the holes as quickly as
possible<00:02:05.700> because<00:02:06.320> it's<00:02:07.320> so<00:02:07.649> thin<00:02:08.069> that

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
possible because it's so thin that

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.759 
possible because it's so thin that
you<00:02:08.819> need<00:02:09.000> to<00:02:09.299> get<00:02:09.719> in<00:02:09.869> there<00:02:10.049> before<00:02:10.349> it

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:10.769 
you need to get in there before it

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:14.240 
you need to get in there before it
starts<00:02:11.159> to<00:02:11.250> dry<00:02:11.879> out<00:02:11.909> but<00:02:12.900> you<00:02:13.379> can<00:02:13.650> do<00:02:13.890> what<00:02:14.219> I

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
starts to dry out but you can do what I

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.580 
starts to dry out but you can do what I
want<00:02:14.549> Li<00:02:15.060> do<00:02:15.269> when<00:02:15.569> I've<00:02:15.719> been<00:02:15.750> sloppy<00:02:16.230> which

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
want Li do when I've been sloppy which

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.110 
want Li do when I've been sloppy which
