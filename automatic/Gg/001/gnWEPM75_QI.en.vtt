00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
6500 you know getting you know roughly

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.209 
6500 you know getting you know roughly
three<00:00:46.620> four<00:00:46.860> hundred<00:00:47.129> views<00:00:47.250> of<00:00:47.430> video<00:00:47.670> uh<00:00:49.219> how

three four hundred views of video uh how

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.369 
three four hundred views of video uh how
you<00:00:50.670> know<00:00:50.879> how<00:00:51.090> could<00:00:51.270> I<00:00:51.329> use<00:00:51.539> that<00:00:51.570> so<00:00:51.930> I'm

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
you know how could I use that so I'm

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.340 
you know how could I use that so I'm
creating<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:53.789> new<00:00:54.120> series<00:00:54.539> and<00:00:54.930> this<00:00:55.050> is<00:00:55.230> all

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
creating a new series and this is all

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.590 
creating a new series and this is all
based<00:00:55.530> on<00:00:55.770> you<00:00:56.370> guys<00:00:56.579> so<00:00:56.910> if<00:00:57.030> I<00:00:57.120> don't<00:00:57.300> get<00:00:57.390> some

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
based on you guys so if I don't get some

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.619 
based on you guys so if I don't get some
missions<00:00:58.280> it<00:00:59.280> probably<00:00:59.609> won't<00:00:59.730> be<00:00:59.789> around<00:01:00.390> for

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
missions it probably won't be around for

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:01.939 
missions it probably won't be around for
so<00:01:00.750> long<00:01:00.870> I'll<00:01:01.079> just<00:01:01.260> kind<00:01:01.469> of<00:01:01.500> have<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:01.649> judge

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949
