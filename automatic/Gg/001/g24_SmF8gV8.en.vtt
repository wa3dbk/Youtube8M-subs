00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:33.419 
still real hard to get ahold of them if
you<00:01:31.659> can<00:01:31.869> there<00:01:32.170> are<00:01:32.229> only<00:01:32.289> 2<00:01:32.649> 50<00:01:33.100> which<00:01:33.280> is

00:01:33.419 --> 00:01:33.429 
you can there are only 2 50 which is

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:35.340 
you can there are only 2 50 which is
cheaper<00:01:33.759> than<00:01:33.789> the<00:01:33.909> rest<00:01:34.179> but<00:01:35.079> you<00:01:35.200> have<00:01:35.289> a

system<00:01:50.259> to<00:01:50.799> get<00:01:50.950> out<00:01:51.100> there<00:01:51.310> well<00:01:51.640> as<00:01:51.789> you<00:01:51.909> said

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
system to get out there well as you said
