00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
need to make this quick let's go wait

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:25.510 
need to make this quick let's go wait
wait<00:00:17.460> I'm<00:00:17.760> not<00:00:17.970> buckled<00:00:18.390> in

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:25.520 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.760 

introducing<00:00:26.520> pointers<00:00:27.350> basically<00:00:28.350> their

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:28.770 
introducing pointers basically their

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.470 
introducing pointers basically their
values<00:00:29.310> which<00:00:29.520> point<00:00:29.880> at<00:00:30.029> things<00:00:30.240> like

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
values which point at things like

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.960 
values which point at things like
characters<00:00:31.140> or<00:00:31.439> enemies<00:00:31.800> you<00:00:32.520> might<00:00:32.730> remember

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:32.970 
characters or enemies you might remember

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:33.979 
characters or enemies you might remember
in<00:00:33.210> visibility

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
in visibility

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.680 
in visibility
that<00:00:34.559> was<00:00:34.739> a<00:00:34.770> pointer<00:00:35.250> anyway<00:00:35.790> I<00:00:35.970> found<00:00:36.480> the

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
that was a pointer anyway I found the

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.140 
that was a pointer anyway I found the
main<00:00:36.870> character<00:00:37.320> pointers<00:00:37.970> basically<00:00:38.970> the

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:39.150 
main character pointers basically the

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:40.400 
main character pointers basically the
ones<00:00:39.300> that<00:00:39.449> make<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.720> game<00:00:39.870> think<00:00:40.199> which

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
ones that make the game think which

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.619 
ones that make the game think which
object<00:00:40.800> is<00:00:40.949> crash<00:00:41.250> which<00:00:41.790> is<00:00:41.940> cord<00:00:42.210> eggs<00:00:42.420> and

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
object is crash which is cord eggs and

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.799 
object is crash which is cord eggs and
so<00:00:42.780> on<00:00:43.340> if<00:00:44.340> you<00:00:44.520> direct<00:00:44.790> two<00:00:45.059> pointers<00:00:45.540> at<00:00:45.690> the

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
so on if you direct two pointers at the

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.170 
so on if you direct two pointers at the
same<00:00:46.019> character<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:46.680> enter<00:00:47.220> a<00:00:47.250> cutscene<00:00:47.519> you

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
same character and enter a cutscene you

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.000 
same character and enter a cutscene you
may<00:00:48.360> end<00:00:48.540> up<00:00:48.690> gaining<00:00:49.019> control<00:00:49.260> of<00:00:49.470> two<00:00:49.739> at<00:00:49.890> the

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
may end up gaining control of two at the

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.790 
may end up gaining control of two at the
same<00:00:50.190> time<00:00:50.900> I've<00:00:51.900> also<00:00:52.110> found<00:00:52.350> camera

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
same time I've also found camera

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.259 
same time I've also found camera
pointers<00:00:53.190> more<00:00:53.580> on<00:00:53.670> that<00:00:53.790> later

00:00:54.259 --> 00:00:54.269 
pointers more on that later

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:55.970 
pointers more on that later
here's<00:00:55.110> what<00:00:55.290> I've<00:00:55.410> done<00:00:55.590> by<00:00:55.739> swapping

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
here's what I've done by swapping

00:00:55.980 --> 00:02:13.970 
here's what I've done by swapping
pointers<00:00:56.520> in<00:00:57.480> cortex<00:00:58.290> thing
