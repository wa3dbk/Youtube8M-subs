00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
know why i just think that you play

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.020 
know why i just think that you play
through<00:02:27.470> every<00:02:27.650> plays<00:02:27.890> the<00:02:28.459> the<00:02:28.849> right

the theme of the day is get back get

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.940 
the theme of the day is get back get
back<00:02:55.190> on<00:02:55.519> defense<00:02:55.700> to<00:02:56.120> stop<00:02:56.359> them<00:02:56.889> to<00:02:57.889> stop

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
their fast break in early how do you

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.289 
their fast break in early how do you
accomplish<00:03:00.230> that<00:03:00.500> when<00:03:01.459> they<00:03:01.670> are<00:03:01.819> faster

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:02.299 
accomplish that when they are faster

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:08.309 
accomplish that when they are faster
than<00:03:02.510> you<00:03:03.730> I<00:03:05.980> think<00:03:06.980> you<00:03:07.190> know<00:03:07.280> you<00:03:07.340> have<00:03:07.519> to<00:03:07.579> be

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
than you I think you know you have to be

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:10.809 
than you I think you know you have to be
efficient<00:03:09.319> offensively<00:03:09.799> which<00:03:10.459> doesn't

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:10.819 
efficient offensively which doesn't

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:12.729 
efficient offensively which doesn't
necessarily<00:03:10.880> mean<00:03:11.299> you're<00:03:11.510> going<00:03:12.440> to<00:03:12.530> score

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
necessarily mean you're going to score

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:15.069 
necessarily mean you're going to score
every<00:03:12.980> time<00:03:13.010> down<00:03:13.370> but<00:03:13.790> you<00:03:14.239> have<00:03:14.840> to<00:03:14.959> take

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:15.079 
every time down but you have to take

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:16.809 
every time down but you have to take
smart<00:03:15.410> shots<00:03:15.680> and<00:03:16.040> you<00:03:16.190> have<00:03:16.310> to<00:03:16.430> take<00:03:16.609> shots

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:16.819
