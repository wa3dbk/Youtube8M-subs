 other inferior rivals what you need is what you need is a 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.450
 low calorie exercise because you probably have too much fat 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:44.910
 body covering his other inferior rivals the truth is that if you train 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.400
 a your lower abdominals appropriately extras using them all 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.790
 together even when you're doing leg lifts hanging and others 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.000
 minerals are involved use dominate lower abdominals 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.700
 wired squats with ball anything if they are well 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:01.900

 committed to your goals if you really want 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:07.460
 a laundry then you probably need is a meal plan that 

00:01:07.459 --> 00:01:10.840
 put you in caloric deficit in addition to a training program with 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.060
 high intensity weights which will create the right hormones in your 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.530
 body this last thing is what will eventually disappear the fat from your body 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.860
 I am going to be nice to you and you teach one of the exercises that 

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:24.130
 specializes in the lower abdominals that will be highlighted 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.350
 can three exercises I do not like much to be more than three or four exercises 

00:01:27.349 --> 00:01:28.710
 together because you have 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.510
 There are many things to think that causes you to lose the intensity of the exercise 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:36.159
 then we are going to do 15 or 25 repetitions of each of them and 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:39.700
 We will be between three or six series depending on your condition 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.700
 physical 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.520
 ace 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.200
 acp 

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:18.850
 let's do an exercise that combines stretching and contraction 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.650
 Now we are going to do some landslides and you have a wheel to dominate them 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.089
 You can also do them with her 

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:28.029
 now let's do a stretching exercise 

00:02:28.029 --> 00:02:31.029
 start with your hands in the middle of the ball 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:17.639
 I lost count of how many repetitions and being 

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:20.789
 That's one of the things that they teach you, you have a robot when 

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:24.389
 you train them the slave the program the repetitions and the series 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:26.040
 focus on the experience 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.849
 focus on sweating in flooding your muscles with blood and increasing the pace 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:33.750
 cardiac that's what gets the results not counting following 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.750
 Exercise like this is how it should look when you get to the end 

00:04:09.179 --> 00:04:12.269
 I'm not pretending 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:15.269
 this is a real workout 

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:21.269
 typically for a guy my size does not want a ball bigger than 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.759
 this one but this gym does not have a 

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:26.759
 sometimes you have one that improvises and be creative 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:30.039
 Most of you are watching this 

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:33.209
 they will be pressuring themselves to release lactic toilet and their bodies 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.069
 they have to create that growth hormone response and keep those 

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:39.590
 short rest periods 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.509
 let me ask you a question 

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:44.740
 do you think that someone who can be my dominates them have more condition 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.409
 physical that someone who makes a circuit like it is in short rest periods 

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:52.659
 that it was much its duration and a lot of oxygen deficit remember if you want 

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:56.759
