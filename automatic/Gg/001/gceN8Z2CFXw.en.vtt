00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:04.930
 Hi, guys, I hope you're very 

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:07.630
 welcome to a new video in this 

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:10.930
 video and let's see how to put the block 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:13.090
 screen lock screen hiv lg 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:14.500
 I have searched for youtube and for 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.460
 internet and found nothing that 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:20.590
 will correctly explain how to put this 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:24.279
 in the background I will find a 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:27.939
 way how bad this form has is 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:30.039
 that only serves for lg g2 with which 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:31.710
 I'm very sorry for people who do not 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:33.990
 have they can not do this 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.940
 process 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:38.620
 simply what we would need would be 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.440
 something that already mentioned in a video 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:47.080
 earlier we would be talking about a 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:51.280
 module x for being called axis 2 world box 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:54.150
 would be that there is and has been the module 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:57.060
 with which we have spoken previously 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:01:00.340
 just select it and restart 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:02.290
 once they have done it they go to 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.770
 section of your settings and go where you put 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:07.840
 Lock screen lock setting 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:12.190
 they will do those seem different 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:16.690
 options and we will give the fund 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:19.720
 lock screen once there where 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.850
 it puts enable the flex theme would be 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.880
 all this is enabled you 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:27.250
 it is enabled by the top part of 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.840
 below is not obligatory suppose adding 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.420
 an option to the screen settings of 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.810
 blockage to enable the subject of law or 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:37.660
 be the lg flare just go after 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.950
 to screen settings and blocking 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:43.750
 screen 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:47.770
 and this puts an option that would 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:50.679
 hide or provide auxiliary screen 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:53.829
 lock pre or use flex themes like 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:55.420
 target paper of treats you give it a 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:58.659
 Once they have done it, they leave for 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.460
 back and they lock the device and what 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:02.819
 they unlock again and as you see 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.819
 they have 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.160
 screen lock a moment when what 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.500
 you are watching 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.210
 so you can see it better 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.350
 and would have in the screen block and 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:16.600
 you know that for the part above 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:19.090
 it would be the icon and from the bottom 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.310
 the water 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.620
 and so can some 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.180
 how many times since they have and without doubt this 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:29.019
 I really like what I was trying to do 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.790
 search by various options and we have not 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:32.319
 found nothing and so it is 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.170
 living here because we would have the 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:39.810
 Famous screen lock 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.810
 device the lg reflex 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.500
