00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 hello everybody then the video of today I came 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.270
 bring you the review of a 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.830
 super cool hair product that 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.719
 call sudden death 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.849
 I think it's about a month ago 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.500
 a so-called virtual shop and cosmetics 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.780
 Brazil contacted me 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.449
 offering this product for me to test and 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.949
 tell you my opinion and it's 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.789
 that's exactly what I'm here to do 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.590
 today 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.779
 talking a little about the brand I 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.109
 I found her pack to start a lot. 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:32.189
 Cute donor this button is super easy to 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:35.160
 open the handle of her scent is a 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.710
 wonderful man 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.989
 without counting the quality is not only 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.340
 I really liked the look and feel 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.410
 From this mask I thought she had a 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.600
 effect - it had a very 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.789
 good in my hair I had an experience 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.230
 very very good actually 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.910
 So, what were my first 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.649
 impressions 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.360
 the first time I tested this 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.239
 mask I already noticed a difference 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:01.230
 so well in the application without it letting 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:03.510
 smooth and easy hair 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.100
 blur because it has that difference 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.820
 among those more that you need 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.220
 pass 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.170
 it seems like so practically half a pot 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.180
 to make a good effect if you 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.640
 get hair tousled with finger 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.460
 even and there are those that you use a 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.080
 A little you just pass it in the hair and you 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.119
 it is no longer that easy for 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.479
 untangle leaving your hair soft and 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.670
 very light and that's what this mask did 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.619
 so I was super excited, right? 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.939
 so you really embarrassment then 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.759
 it was a plus 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.250
 Her smell is incredible and it is not 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.950
 from those smells like that for example 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:41.880
 you make your game or your accountant and 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.740
 everything is you get out of the bath you do not have 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.869
 no smell so the player suffered 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.149
 Your hair smells like hair and it's 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.180
 Boring it is not that smell that 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:53.579
 stays the whole day and the next day and is 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.930
 very tasty the smell of bullet but the 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.540
 same time it's a little bit citric 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.119
 However, do not worry, it's still very tasty. 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.640
 and as I said to you and only in this 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.009
 which is an intense moisturizing mask 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.380
 It's only fair that she is cool. 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.929
 free of parabens because they would be 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.730
 Parabens are the class of 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.920
 chemical compounds that are very 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.959
 found in cosmetic products 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.819
 important aspects of a computer and this 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.459
 tetra and they are even considered 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:22.319
 toxic to human cells then it is 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.330
 It's very good that this mask does not 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:28.500
 It feels good about my father, so 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.610
 everything a little super positive and is a 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.170
 plan more right 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.239
 Like I told you first time. 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.030
 I had liked the mask I found that 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:39.360
 she let super hair moisturize the 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.790
 soft and everything but in the long run she 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.950
 It still improves but I still felt that 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.890
 she gave more strength to my hair so 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.599
 She helped him get treated well. 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.940
 especially in winter, so the 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:53.670
 My hair tips were super super 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:56.910
 resected and she helped a lot 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:03:01.530
 even take off this dryness and give 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:02.849
 Shine on him, yes, much better, and I'm 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.290
 really in love 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:06.090
 It's been a month or so since I've been 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.730
 wearing this mask and here in the box 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.440
 they suggest that you use her at 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.379
 least once a week 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.810
 I'm just a little crazy, right? 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:17.760
 I like to use at least some of it. 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.739
 two three times a week so I kind of 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.440
 which intercalates so one day I use a 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:24.870
 normal control and another of this or 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.879
 two days in the normal context and another day 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.200
 before or two days and if one day the 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:30.120
 no advice 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.129
 It all depends on my mood and how I find it 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:35.490
 that the hair is that day but I 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:38.850
 I think she's super efficient. 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:42.680
 very good even and does not believe in me 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:44.480
 have used it for almost a month 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:48.180
 all 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:50.370
 She's still super full, you can see. 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.170
 I used it very little because really 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.120
 you do not need much to achieve 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.890
 to treat your real hair she is 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.690
 of those you do not need to play half 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.490
 pot of all moisturizer in your hair 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.400
 to take effect 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:04.800
 so it's the new real darling 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.390
 Is it in the shower like technology? 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.650
