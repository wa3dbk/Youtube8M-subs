question<00:01:02.450> like<00:01:02.960> I<00:01:03.079> said<00:01:03.290> before<00:01:03.440> there's<00:01:03.800> no

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:03.950 
question like I said before there's no

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.460 
question like I said before there's no
true<00:01:04.220> leader<00:01:04.489> here<00:01:04.790> and<00:01:05.119> no<00:01:05.810> one's<00:01:06.020> taking<00:01:06.380> it

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
true leader here and no one's taking it

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.020 
true leader here and no one's taking it
so<00:01:06.590> that's<00:01:06.740> 30<00:01:07.100> 31

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
so that's 30 31

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.630 
so that's 30 31
remember<00:01:08.899> the<00:01:08.990> unseating<00:01:09.440> he<00:01:09.530> was<00:01:09.680> 1<00:01:09.860> for<00:01:09.890> 17

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
remember the unseating he was 1 for 17

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.630 
remember the unseating he was 1 for 17
so<00:01:11.060> but<00:01:11.270> play<00:01:11.450> around<00:01:11.690> too<00:01:11.990> much<00:01:12.610> they<00:01:13.610> might

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
so but play around too much they might

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.490 
so but play around too much they might
find<00:01:14.119> themselves<00:01:14.570> and<00:01:14.869> we<00:01:14.990> can<00:01:15.020> get<00:01:15.350> him

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
find themselves and we can get him

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:26.410 
find themselves and we can get him
