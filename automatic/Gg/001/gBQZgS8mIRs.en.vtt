00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.060
 chapter 11 

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:03.790
 rhythm 

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:08.740
 everything flows and ebbs everything ascends and descends the pendular oscillation 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.110
 manifests in all things the measure of the movement to the right is the 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.390
 same as that of the oscillation on the left 

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:17.689
 the rhythm is the compensation 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:19.849
 what they were worth 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:24.550
 the fifth great hermetic principle the principle of rhythm holds the truth 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.539
 that a measured oscillation manifests itself in all 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.319
 back and forth movement 

00:00:29.319 --> 00:00:30.909
 a ebb and flow 

00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:33.230
 a movement similar to that of the pendulum 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.090
 a tide with ups and downs always manifesting between the two 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.640
 poles 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.700
 in the mental and spiritual physical planes 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.910
 the principle of rhythm is closely related to the 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.910
 polarity principle described in the previous chapter 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.480
 the rhythm manifests itself between the two poles established by the principle of 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.410
 polarity 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.850
 This does not mean 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.030
 however, the rhythmic oscillation goes to the ends of each pole 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.520
 well this happens very rare 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.850
 it is actually very difficult to establish extreme polar opposites in the 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.320
 most cases 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.380
 but the oscillation is always towards one pole first and then towards the other 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.310
 there is always an action and a reaction 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:14.930
 an advance and a setback 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.789
 an elevation and a fall 

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:20.470
 manifesting in all things and phenomena of the universe 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:21.890
 molÃ©s 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:23.440
 men animals 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:24.340
 vegetables 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:25.090
 minerals 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.900
 energies 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.090
 forces mind if matter and even the same spirit manifest this 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.040
 beginning 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.820
 the principle manifests itself in the creation and destruction of the worlds 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.680
 in the rise and fall of the nations in the history of the life of 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:39.940
 everything 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.100
 and finally in the mental states of man 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.440
 starting with the manifestations of the spirit the whole will be that there is always 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:51.850
 an emanation followed by absorption breathing and brahma aspiration 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.890
 according to the brawn innes 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.440
 the universes are created reach the lowest point of maternity and then 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.660
 they begin the swing back 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:05.050
 two suns are born reach the summit of his power begins the progress of his 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.000
 retrovision and after a month without a story become dead masses of 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.970
 matter waiting for another impulse that imparts in them new energies 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.079
 internal and that leads to a new solar life cycle 

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:18.300
 and so it is with all the worlds 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.040
 are born 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.029
 they grow and die only to be reborn again 

00:02:22.029 --> 00:02:26.489
 and equally happens with all body shape things oscillate from the action to 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:30.769
 the reaction from birth to death of activity to inactivity and 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:32.479
 new cycle begins 

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:36.719
 the same goes for all the great philosophical movements creeds of 

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:37.640
 any class 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.709
 nations governments etcetera doha do 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.599
 they grow they reach maturity 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:44.029
 they decay and die 

00:02:44.029 --> 00:02:45.869
 only to be reborn again 

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:48.899
 pendular oscillation evident everywhere 

00:02:48.899 --> 00:02:51.439
 the night follows the day and the day to the night 

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:55.119
 the pendulum swings from summer to winter and from there to 

00:02:55.119 --> 00:02:59.939
 the corpuscles atoms and molecules and all the masses of matter oscillate in 

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:02.769
 Circle wheel that corresponds to its nature 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:06.209
 there is no such absolute rest cessation of movement 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.819
 all movement participates in the rhythm 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:11.669
 this principle is universally applicable 

00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:15.519
 can be applied to any question or phenomenon of the many phases of the 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:16.269
 lifetime 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:19.739
 can be applied to all phases of human activity 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.819
 there is always the rhythmic oscillation from one pole to another 

00:03:23.399 --> 00:03:26.509
 the universal pendulum is always in motion 

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:29.659
 the tides of life flows nor reflows in accordance with the law 

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:34.669
 modern science recognizes the principle of rhythm and considers it of application 

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:37.879
 universal as far as material things are concerned 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:41.519
 but the Hermeticists take the principle much further and know that their 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:45.329
 manifestations extend to the mental activities of man and that 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:48.449
 he only explains the great succession of its modalities 

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:52.109
 feelings and other forceful changes that we notice in us 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:53.029
 same 

00:03:53.029 --> 00:03:56.999
 but the Hermeticists studying the operation of this principle have 

00:03:56.999 --> 00:04:00.429
 discovered the supposed way to activities through the 

00:04:00.429 --> 00:04:01.649
 transmutation 

00:04:01.649 --> 00:04:05.729
 the hermetic teachers discovered that while the beginning of the rhythm 

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:06.609
 it was invariable 

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:10.159
 and evident in all mental phenomena there were two planes of 

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:13.599
 manifestation as far as mental phenomena concerned 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:17.979
 they discovered that there were two general planes of consciousness the inferior and the 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:18.640
 higher 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:22.900
 and this discovery allowed them to take to the upper plane escaping 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.600
 the oscillation of the rhythmic pendulum that manifested in the lower plane 

00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:28.449
 in other words 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:32.100
 the oscillation of the pendulum occurs in the unconscious plane 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.729
 and consciousness is not therefore accepted 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:38.889
 to this law and they called it a law of neutralization 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:42.539
 your operation consists of elevating claimed about the vibrations of the plan or 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:44.669
 unconscious of mental activity 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:48.389
 so that the negative oscillation of the pendulum does not manifest itself in the 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:51.050
 conscience and not be affected by it 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:55.370
 it's the same as getting up above a thing and letting it pass is by 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:56.550
 below 1 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.669
 the hermetic instructor or disciples is also polarized at the pole 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:04.630
 required and by a procedure similar to refusing to participate in the 

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:08.990
 retrograde oscillation or if you prefer denying its influence on him 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.430
 it remains firmly in its polarized position and allows the mental pendulum 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:16.169
 harass backward in the unconscious plane 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:20.669
 every man who to a greater or lesser degree acquired a certain self-control 

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:24.320
 he does this more or less consciously preventing his 

00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:28.879
 Negative mental conditions or states and do not affect through the application of 

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:30.599
 the law of neutralization 

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:35.459
 the teacher however carries this to a much greater degree of effectiveness and 

00:05:35.459 --> 00:05:38.060
 profession of society inc through his will 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:42.180
 reaches a degree of mental balance and inflexibility almost impossible to 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.860
 conceive by those who let themselves be carried and brought by the mental pendulum of 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:48.039
 your feelings and modalities 

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:52.129
 every thinker will duly appreciate the great importance of the matter with only 

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:56.460
 consider him a slave that most people are from their own state of 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.719
 encourage feelings and emotions 

00:05:58.719 --> 00:06:01.360
 and the little self-control they have 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.169
 If the issue is meditated, it will be understood how much they have affected us in 

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:09.600
 our life those oscillations of rhythm as to a period of enthusiasm has 

00:06:09.599 --> 00:06:12.520
 followed a corresponding period of depression 

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:13.479
 equally 

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:17.319
 we have periods of value that are followed by periods of discouragement and 

00:06:17.319 --> 00:06:18.080
 fear 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.759
 and so it is with all or most at least
