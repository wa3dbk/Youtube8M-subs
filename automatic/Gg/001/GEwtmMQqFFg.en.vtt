 maslopress auger 3 new spin 3 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:18.410
 camera reviews 1 turned out to be 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:21.330
 There is an oil 2 camera and 3 pressing costs 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:24.119
 of the novel which is the file reducer below 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.939
 belt motor installed 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:32.450
 broadcast 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:35.489
 top is heated for raw materials 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:41.520
 the device was given a seed 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:48.170
 shuffled gearmotor also 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:54.930
 install oil pressure control has 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:57.109
 digital temperature indicator in this 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:02.730
 moment temperature is shown 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:06.659
 thermocouple is installed on the plate below 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:09.229
 which installed teny you do not heat 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:13.110
 the stove the stove conveys the heat of the seed 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:14.330
 the seed warms up to temperature 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:19.439
 given 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:21.210
 by this electronic sensor to see 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.869
 bottom temperature 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:28.200
 the pan I press a button to show 75 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.479
 degrees now temperature 21 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.540
 degree it will rise to 75 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.540
 degrees 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:42.650
 For example, in the summer season you can temperature 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.650
 set 50 to 60 degrees 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:52.440
 as the temperature is above the incoming 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:54.810
 it should be 30 40 degrees 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:58.900
 temperature sensor 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:02.320
 seeds are installed on top of the heater 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:04.740
 he himself is down to the very days now 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.740
 goods 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:12.160
 normal operation oil press when 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:19.070
 temperature seeds 30 40 grams 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:21.320
 winter period where my translation breaks 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:23.420
 absolutely whether your temperature will be 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:26.209
 jaw can be brought here to walk 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:30.290
 so cold rooms cold raw 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:30.940
 so you need to guess and temperature on 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.170
 bottom 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:40.130
 to semashko respectively 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:42.320
 thirty to forty picking method here on 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.470
 control panel three light bulbs on 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:48.190
 show three phases 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:55.900
 also the start button the reverse button and 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:55.900
 turning on gearmotor to the pan 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.620
 under the oil press installed tank for 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:05.590
 reception 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:12.290
 dirty oil on the tank is mesh 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:13.930
 catch large particles of dirt now we 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:17.469
 will smell 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:20.340
 initially we fill the griddle on 

00:03:17.469 --> 00:03:26.700
 two thirds of the volume 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:30.579
 we will heat for 20 minutes to a temperature 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:32.769
 seeds 30 40 g and then continuous 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:34.319
 semashko flow will go out 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:37.120
 bunker 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:39.450
 just enter the oil before the screw 3 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.450
 fuck 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.800
 yes the barrier when forget the first 20 is closed 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:50.830
 when the whole seed is passed through 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:53.560
 then the flap opens a seed 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:58.410
 the mas-address comes in the snow takes all the bags 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.410
 as much as it is calculated 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.060
 before the time of heating the seeds it all depends on 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.310
 season work 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.430
 it could be 15 rubles and 30 may be 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.430
 days 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:20.620
 but during work it is daily subsistence 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:21.640
 more butter will be heated now 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.720
 baby market or 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:30.690
 with the second a little less and even leftovers 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:33.880
 oil occurs with 3 males if through 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.570
 50 70 tons oil output with 1 camera 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.180
 decreased 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.260
 or stopped altogether 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:45.700
 replace 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:48.120
 washers found well disassembly of the screw and from what 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:52.620
 it consists we show next 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:55.330
 cake comes from the butt 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:59.070
 this working part 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:02.700
 compressed by the room tip and 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:02.700
 lock nuts are fixed 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:15.120
 as the press oil warmed it up 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:20.140
 the first 10 5-10 minutes we will reduce 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:21.250
 the gap between the working parts here 

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:23.980
 us doors or feet 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:27.990
 1 adjustment of the figure to the second camera and 

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:27.990
 final adjustment 3 Kabbalah 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:40.900
 to replace the helix in the pan 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:45.110
 provided for 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:46.700
 for the sake of a removable cap fold shortly 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:50.350
 on hinges or can be lifted 

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:55.850
 put the lock removed 

00:05:50.350 --> 00:06:00.350
 bottom bottom cap and going on 

00:05:55.850 --> 00:06:02.150
 free access to the coils when 

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:04.780
 need pan can be removed at all 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:04.780
 with 100 microns
