he gets the nuclear I'm gonna talk over

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.400 
he gets the nuclear I'm gonna talk over
it<00:00:27.330> because<00:00:27.449> I<00:00:27.539> don't<00:00:27.689> really<00:00:27.779> want<00:00:28.109> to<00:00:28.140> steal

it because I don't really want to steal

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.290 
it because I don't really want to steal
his<00:00:28.590> video<00:00:28.890> or<00:00:29.010> anything<00:00:29.369> I<00:00:29.490> was<00:00:29.699> gonna<00:00:30.060> just

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
his video or anything I was gonna just

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.269 
his video or anything I was gonna just
talk<00:00:30.570> over<00:00:30.929> his<00:00:31.080> video<00:00:31.380> but<00:00:31.619> I<00:00:31.650> don't<00:00:32.070> want<00:00:32.219> to

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
talk over his video but I don't want to

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:33.500 
talk over his video but I don't want to
do<00:00:32.369> that<00:00:32.399> he<00:00:32.700> has<00:00:32.820> his<00:00:32.969> face<00:00:33.180> cam<00:00:33.390> and

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
do that he has his face cam and

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:34.729 
do that he has his face cam and
everything<00:00:33.780> I<00:00:33.930> think<00:00:34.320> it's<00:00:34.410> better<00:00:34.530> if<00:00:34.620> you

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
everything I think it's better if you

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.620 
everything I think it's better if you
just<00:00:34.770> see<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.070> 15<00:00:35.399> seconds<00:00:35.730> so<00:00:35.790> right<00:00:36.000> now<00:00:36.030> you

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
just see the 15 seconds so right now you

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.060 
just see the 15 seconds so right now you
should<00:00:36.899> be<00:00:36.930> looking<00:00:37.170> at<00:00:37.380> him<00:00:37.620> getting<00:00:37.980> the

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
should be looking at him getting the

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.740 
should be looking at him getting the
nuclear<00:00:38.489> and<00:00:38.730> this<00:00:39.090> is<00:00:39.210> what<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.420> nuclear

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
nuclear and this is what the nuclear

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.780 
nuclear and this is what the nuclear
matter<00:00:39.899> looks<00:00:40.200> like<00:00:40.469> he<00:00:41.190> gets<00:00:41.370> on<00:00:41.460> 30

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
matter looks like he gets on 30

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.340 
matter looks like he gets on 30
killstreak<00:00:42.239> he's<00:00:42.450> getting<00:00:42.660> a<00:00:42.719> ton<00:00:42.960> of<00:00:42.989> crazy

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
killstreak he's getting a ton of crazy

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.680 
killstreak he's getting a ton of crazy
stuff<00:00:43.649> it's<00:00:44.040> absolutely<00:00:44.730> insane<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.300> we're

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
stuff it's absolutely insane and we're

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:46.910 
stuff it's absolutely insane and we're
basically<00:00:45.899> we're<00:00:46.350> gonna<00:00:46.440> talk<00:00:46.680> about<00:00:46.829> the

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
basically we're gonna talk about the

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.709 
basically we're gonna talk about the
nuclear<00:00:47.100> in<00:00:47.340> general<00:00:47.700> any<00:00:47.820> other<00:00:48.030> streaks<00:00:48.510> and

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
nuclear in general any other streaks and

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.170 
nuclear in general any other streaks and
anything<00:00:49.469> else<00:00:49.649> that<00:00:49.860> would<00:00:50.100> guess<00:00:50.640> count<00:00:50.969> as

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
anything else that would guess count as

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.450 
anything else that would guess count as
a<00:00:51.210> huge<00:00:51.660> accomplishment<00:00:51.960> in<00:00:52.410> black<00:00:52.649> ops<00:00:52.860> 3<00:00:52.980> now

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
a huge accomplishment in black ops 3 now

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.369 
a huge accomplishment in black ops 3 now
obviously<00:00:53.879> that<00:00:54.480> was<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.899> world's<00:00:55.320> first

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
obviously that was the world's first

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.410 
obviously that was the world's first
nuclear<00:00:56.070> gameplay<00:00:56.610> there<00:00:56.789> hasn't<00:00:57.090> been<00:00:57.120> any

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
nuclear gameplay there hasn't been any

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.810 
nuclear gameplay there hasn't been any
other<00:00:57.660> sightings<00:00:58.230> of<00:00:58.410> nuclear's<00:00:58.920> so<00:00:59.219> far<00:00:59.460> I'm

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
other sightings of nuclear's so far I'm

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.029

description if you want to check out the

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.969 
description if you want to check out the
full<00:01:14.970> thing<00:01:15.210> I'm<00:01:15.540> he<00:01:15.869> is<00:01:15.930> talking<00:01:16.200> in<00:01:16.560> German

like what's going on but if you're just
there<00:01:21.180> for<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.390> gameplay<00:01:21.780> you<00:01:22.200> can<00:01:22.350> just<00:01:22.500> you

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
there for the gameplay you can just you

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.770 
there for the gameplay you can just you
know<00:01:23.070> ignore<00:01:23.400> what<00:01:23.610> he's<00:01:23.700> saying<00:01:23.970> and<00:01:24.270> just

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
nuclear i just had to show you just a

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.650 
nuclear i just had to show you just a
couple<00:02:55.890> seconds<00:02:56.489> of<00:02:56.640> a<00:02:56.730> 10<00:02:56.910> seconds<00:02:57.269> probably

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
couple seconds of a 10 seconds probably

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.110 
couple seconds of a 10 seconds probably
of<00:02:57.810> what<00:02:58.709> it<00:02:58.829> actually<00:02:59.040> is<00:02:59.280> because<00:02:59.700> it's<00:02:59.849> so

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
of what it actually is because it's so

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.119 
of what it actually is because it's so
cool<00:03:00.420> just<00:03:00.840> seeing<00:03:01.109> the<00:03:01.230> nuclear<00:03:01.650> pop<00:03:01.829> up<00:03:02.010> on

00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:02.129 
cool just seeing the nuclear pop up on

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:03.619 
cool just seeing the nuclear pop up on
the<00:03:02.159> screen<00:03:02.280> I<00:03:02.700> think<00:03:03.090> that's<00:03:03.209> really<00:03:03.510> all

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:03.629 
the screen I think that's really all

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:04.580 
the screen I think that's really all
that<00:03:03.659> matters<00:03:03.810> because<00:03:04.170> the<00:03:04.290> rest<00:03:04.440> of<00:03:04.530> the

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
that matters because the rest of the

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.289 
that matters because the rest of the
gameplay<00:03:04.950> really<00:03:05.340> is<00:03:05.459> just<00:03:05.640> him<00:03:05.879> shooting

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
gameplay really is just him shooting

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:07.880 
gameplay really is just him shooting
