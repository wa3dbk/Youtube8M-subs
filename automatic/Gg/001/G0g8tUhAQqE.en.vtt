have to do that let's see so I could
sandbag<00:01:01.039> it<00:01:01.309> now<00:01:01.550> there's<00:01:01.940> really<00:01:02.270> no<00:01:02.480> way<00:01:02.510> to

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660 
sandbag it now there's really no way to

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.650 
sandbag it now there's really no way to
do<00:01:02.870> it<00:01:03.220> other<00:01:04.220> than<00:01:04.580> to<00:01:04.640> just<00:01:04.850> play<00:01:05.330> it<00:01:05.360> and

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:05.660 
do it other than to just play it and

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.520 
do it other than to just play it and
suck<00:01:06.380> it<00:01:06.410> up<00:01:06.619> the<00:01:07.280> other<00:01:07.399> option<00:01:07.850> is<00:01:07.970> to<00:01:08.530> take

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
suck it up the other option is to take

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:15.880 
suck it up the other option is to take
five<00:01:09.920> more<00:01:11.080> and<00:01:12.640> then<00:01:13.640> so<00:01:14.180> go<00:01:14.899> to<00:01:14.960> ten<00:01:15.350> here

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
which is the plan here man how

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:59.220 
which is the plan here man how
am<00:02:48.430> I<00:02:48.489> supposed<00:02:48.760> to<00:02:48.819> deal<00:02:49.030> with<00:02:49.209> this<00:02:51.300> well

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.339 

or<00:02:59.769> did<00:03:00.069> to<00:03:00.250> anything<00:03:00.580> so<00:03:01.060> we<00:03:01.180> just<00:03:01.360> have<00:03:01.450> to<00:03:01.840> go

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:02.349 
or did to anything so we just have to go

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:05.460 
or did to anything so we just have to go
into<00:03:02.560> chump<00:03:03.040> and<00:03:03.220> pray<00:03:03.640> so<00:03:03.700> I<00:03:03.940> think<00:03:04.319> think<00:03:05.319> the

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
into chump and pray so I think think the

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:11.430 
into chump and pray so I think think the
play<00:03:05.830> is<00:03:08.940> flip<00:03:09.940> it<00:03:10.150> if<00:03:10.390> he<00:03:10.599> attacks<00:03:10.900> with<00:03:11.200> just

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
play is flip it if he attacks with just

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.050 
play is flip it if he attacks with just
the<00:03:11.560> bellringer<00:03:11.890> we<00:03:12.129> block<00:03:12.459> with<00:03:12.760> the

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
the bellringer we block with the

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.630 
the bellringer we block with the
deranged<00:03:13.900> assistant<00:03:14.409> get<00:03:14.650> this<00:03:14.799> to<00:03:14.950> be<00:03:15.069> a<00:03:15.099> 22

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
deranged assistant get this to be a 22

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.039 
deranged assistant get this to be a 22

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:22.410 
and then hopefully we draw like another
to<00:03:20.349> drop<00:03:20.590> next<00:03:20.860> turn<00:03:21.069> or<00:03:21.280> something<00:03:21.700> I'm<00:03:22.209> not

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:28.329 
chump enough times to get this guy to be

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:31.380 
chump enough times to get this guy to be
a<00:03:28.360> 44<00:03:28.959> and<00:03:29.260> he's<00:03:29.470> just<00:03:29.739> on<00:03:29.890> stone<00:03:30.430> nothing<00:03:31.150> for

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
a 44 and he's just on stone nothing for

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.100 
a 44 and he's just on stone nothing for
the<00:03:31.450> rest<00:03:31.480> of<00:03:31.720> the<00:03:31.810> game<00:03:33.420> yeah<00:03:34.420> pretty<00:03:34.959> sure<00:03:35.019> I

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110 
the rest of the game yeah pretty sure I

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:36.990 
the rest of the game yeah pretty sure I
can't<00:03:35.410> go<00:03:35.500> to<00:03:35.530> one<00:03:35.829> here<00:03:36.250> I<00:03:36.370> mean<00:03:36.610> I'm<00:03:36.700> dead<00:03:36.879> to

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
can't go to one here I mean I'm dead to

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.720 
can't go to one here I mean I'm dead to
brimstone<00:03:37.420> volley<00:03:37.450> either<00:03:37.870> way<00:03:38.140> but<00:03:38.200> I<00:03:38.739> think

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
brimstone volley either way but I think

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.960 
brimstone volley either way but I think
that<00:03:39.790> growing<00:03:40.780> the<00:03:41.459> deranged<00:03:42.459> assistant<00:03:42.879> is

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
that growing the deranged assistant is

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:49.410 
that growing the deranged assistant is
going<00:03:43.120> to<00:03:43.180> be<00:03:43.359> pretty<00:03:44.170> pretty<00:03:44.739> nice

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.960 

so<00:03:50.420> I'm<00:03:50.480> good<00:03:51.160> planes<00:03:52.160> is<00:03:52.400> not<00:03:52.580> really<00:03:52.940> that

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
so I'm good planes is not really that

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:59.170 
so I'm good planes is not really that
good<00:03:53.420> as<00:03:54.110> it<00:03:54.800> turns<00:03:55.040> out<00:03:56.260> so<00:03:57.640> looks<00:03:58.640> like<00:03:58.790> we're

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
good as it turns out so looks like we're

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.570

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
guy stand chump with it it's not even

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:12.910 
guy stand chump with it it's not even
really<00:04:05.630> that<00:04:05.750> good<00:04:11.560> then<00:04:12.560> we're<00:04:12.650> going<00:04:12.740> to<00:04:12.830> go

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
and then now I guess we just have to

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:24.010 
and then now I guess we just have to
trade<00:04:18.920> and<00:04:19.660> take<00:04:20.660> it<00:04:20.900> and<00:04:21.049> then<00:04:22.540> hope<00:04:23.540> to<00:04:23.720> draw

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
trade and take it and then hope to draw
