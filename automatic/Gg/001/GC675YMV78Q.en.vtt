00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
first off the blade steel is a

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:03.500 
first off the blade steel is a
combination<00:00:57.300> of<00:00:58.219> zdp<00:00:59.219> 189<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:00.710> 420<00:01:01.710> +<00:01:01.949> j<00:01:02.129> to<00:01:02.510> 2

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
combination of zdp 189 and 420 + j to 2

combination of zdp 189 and 420 + j to 2
different<00:01:03.600> place<00:01:03.870> deals<00:01:04.080> like<00:01:04.289> this<00:01:04.440> that

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
different place deals like this that

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.440 
different place deals like this that
little<00:01:04.860> bit<00:01:04.949> lighter<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.940> blade<00:01:06.240> thickness

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
little bit lighter the blade thickness

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.139 
little bit lighter the blade thickness
is<00:01:06.869> 1/8<00:01:07.680> of<00:01:07.890> an<00:01:08.009> inch<00:01:08.390> the<00:01:09.390> whole<00:01:10.020> diameter<00:01:10.500> is

00:01:11.139 --> 00:01:11.149 
is 1/8 of an inch the whole diameter is

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:12.650 
is 1/8 of an inch the whole diameter is
7/16<00:01:12.149> of<00:01:12.330> an<00:01:12.390> inch

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:12.660 
7/16 of an inch

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.590 
7/16 of an inch
Hannah<00:01:13.530> material<00:01:13.950> is<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.130> FRN<00:01:15.030> fiberglass

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
Hannah material is a FRN fiberglass

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.910 
Hannah material is a FRN fiberglass
reinforced<00:01:16.170> nylon<00:01:16.610> the<00:01:17.610> blade<00:01:18.600> length<00:01:18.810> is<00:01:18.990> 2

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
reinforced nylon the blade length is 2

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.230 
reinforced nylon the blade length is 2
and<00:01:20.280> 7/8

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
and 7/8

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.540 
and 7/8
so<00:01:21.420> essentially<00:01:21.780> three<00:01:22.140> inches<00:01:22.440> close<00:01:23.310> length

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:23.550 
so essentially three inches close length

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.060 
so essentially three inches close length
or<00:01:23.729> handle<00:01:24.000> length<00:01:24.179> is<00:01:24.390> four<00:01:25.200> inches<00:01:25.320> the

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
or handle length is four inches the

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.039 
or handle length is four inches the
actual<00:01:26.369> cutting<00:01:26.640> edge<00:01:26.909> is<00:01:27.330> two<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:27.900> half

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
actual cutting edge is two and a half

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:34.280 
actual cutting edge is two and a half
and<00:01:28.939> weight<00:01:29.939> is<00:01:30.680> 1.9<00:01:31.680> ounces<00:01:32.360> so<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:34.080> little

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
in a vg10 this is well if you're gonna

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.060 
in a vg10 this is well if you're gonna
be<00:02:08.940> I'll<00:02:09.060> see<00:02:09.329> it<00:02:09.479> doesn't<00:02:10.470> have<00:02:10.590> a<00:02:10.619> good<00:02:10.829> zoom

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.070 
be I'll see it doesn't have a good zoom

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.009 
be I'll see it doesn't have a good zoom
on<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.310> camera<00:02:11.610> so<00:02:12.150> Spyderco<00:02:12.630> in<00:02:12.780> and<00:02:12.900> below

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:13.019 
on the camera so Spyderco in and below

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:19.430 
on the camera so Spyderco in and below
it<00:02:13.170> says<00:02:13.350> zdp<00:02:13.739> 189<00:02:14.810> backslash<00:02:16.280> 420<00:02:17.280> j2<00:02:18.440> so

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
it says zdp 189 backslash 420 j2 so

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.860 
it says zdp 189 backslash 420 j2 so
essentially<00:02:20.040> this<00:02:20.160> is<00:02:20.269> like<00:02:21.269> I<00:02:21.299> stand<00:02:21.630> my

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
essentially this is like I stand my

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.910 
essentially this is like I stand my
steel<00:02:22.410> where<00:02:23.190> you<00:02:23.340> have<00:02:23.549> the<00:02:24.269> CDP<00:02:24.660> 189<00:02:25.410> as<00:02:25.739> the

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
steel where you have the CDP 189 as the

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.259 
steel where you have the CDP 189 as the
core<00:02:26.209> and<00:02:27.209> then<00:02:27.450> 420<00:02:28.380> and<00:02:28.889> j2<00:02:29.160> sandwiched<00:02:30.120> on

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
core and then 420 and j2 sandwiched on

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:32.150 
core and then 420 and j2 sandwiched on
either<00:02:30.480> side<00:02:30.810> is<00:02:30.959> Dale<00:02:31.230> steel<00:02:31.680> so<00:02:31.889> you<00:02:31.980> have

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
either side is Dale steel so you have

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.550 
either side is Dale steel so you have
the<00:02:32.370> harder<00:02:33.239> steel<00:02:34.049> on<00:02:34.169> the<00:02:34.199> core

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
the harder steel on the core

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.800 
the harder steel on the core
as<00:02:35.069> well<00:02:35.400> as<00:02:35.520> the<00:02:35.670> cutting<00:02:35.849> edge<00:02:36.090> and<00:02:36.300> then<00:02:36.630> the

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
texturing on the scales it's kind of

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.840

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.990 
to but nice forward trial on here I'm
one<00:04:56.550> of<00:04:56.610> the<00:04:56.700> reasons<00:04:57.000> why<00:04:57.150> you<00:04:57.210> have<00:04:57.600> a<00:04:59.000> t1

one of the reasons why you have a t1

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.080 
one of the reasons why you have a t1
17th<00:05:00.510> inch<00:05:00.660> blade<00:05:01.100> but<00:05:02.100> actually<00:05:02.520> only<00:05:02.550> two

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.100 
and a half inch cutting surface allows

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:08.210 
and a half inch cutting surface allows
you<00:05:05.340> to<00:05:05.580> grip<00:05:06.480> up<00:05:06.660> and<00:05:07.530> get<00:05:07.800> your<00:05:07.889> finger<00:05:08.160> in

little bit a little bit of added grip

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.140 
little bit a little bit of added grip

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:25.320 
about this where I understand why it

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:28.070 
about this where I understand why it
don't<00:06:26.090> do<00:06:27.090> it<00:06:27.210> for<00:06:27.330> all<00:06:27.389> the<00:06:27.419> knives<00:06:27.660> like<00:06:27.960> the

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:28.080 
don't do it for all the knives like the

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:31.450 
don't do it for all the knives like the

screws on to open up the knife on the

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:36.180 
back here as well as the pivot these are

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:38.930 
back here as well as the pivot these are
riveted<00:06:36.510> on<00:06:36.630> there<00:06:37.039> there<00:06:38.039> is<00:06:38.250> no<00:06:38.460> blade<00:06:38.910> play

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:38.940 
riveted on there there is no blade play

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:42.140 
riveted on there there is no blade play

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:42.150 
up or down side to side but if you use

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:44.480 
up or down side to side but if you use
this<00:06:42.360> knife<00:06:42.570> for<00:06:42.750> heavy<00:06:42.900> use<00:06:43.340> you<00:06:44.340> can

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:44.490 
this knife for heavy use you can

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:46.790 
this knife for heavy use you can
definitely<00:06:45.380> predict<00:06:46.380> that<00:06:46.500> there<00:06:46.680> would<00:06:46.770> be

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:46.800 
definitely predict that there would be

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:50.600 
definitely predict that there would be
some<00:06:48.110> some<00:06:49.110> loosening<00:06:49.680> of<00:06:50.010> that<00:06:50.190> of<00:06:50.430> that

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:50.610 
some some loosening of that of that

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:51.950 
some some loosening of that of that
pivot<00:06:50.970> and<00:06:51.090> there's<00:06:51.300> no<00:06:51.419> way<00:06:51.570> to<00:06:51.600> address<00:06:51.780> that

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:51.960 
pivot and there's no way to address that

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:53.900 
pivot and there's no way to address that
unless<00:06:52.289> you<00:06:52.410> sent<00:06:52.590> it<00:06:52.650> back<00:06:52.740> just<00:06:52.860> right<00:06:52.950> ok<00:06:53.280> so

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:53.910 
unless you sent it back just right ok so

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:56.600
