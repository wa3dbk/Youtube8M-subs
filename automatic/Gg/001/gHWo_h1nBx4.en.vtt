Scott this whole interview is a result
of<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:55.260> fact<00:00:55.470> that<00:00:55.680> when<00:00:55.950> I<00:00:55.980> was<00:00:56.250> a<00:00:56.280> sophomore

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
of the fact that when I was a sophomore

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.070 
of the fact that when I was a sophomore
in<00:00:56.850> college<00:00:56.970> long<00:00:57.660> ago<00:00:58.020> 19<00:00:58.730> 52<00:00:59.730> and<00:00:59.940> 53<00:01:00.330> in<00:01:00.750> fact

in college long ago 19 52 and 53 in fact

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.549 
in college long ago 19 52 and 53 in fact
I<00:01:01.380> got<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.070> idea<00:01:02.550> of<00:01:02.930> seeing<00:01:03.930> what<00:01:04.080> I<00:01:04.110> could<00:01:04.350> do

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
I got the idea of seeing what I could do

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.910 
I got the idea of seeing what I could do
to<00:01:04.589> build<00:01:04.949> a<00:01:05.100> bicycle<00:01:05.670> that<00:01:06.300> would<00:01:06.630> be<00:01:07.080> fairly

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
to build a bicycle that would be fairly

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.280 
to build a bicycle that would be fairly
well<00:01:08.220> adapted<00:01:08.730> to<00:01:08.790> operation<00:01:09.480> on<00:01:09.660> dirt<00:01:10.260> roads

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
well adapted to operation on dirt roads

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.920 
well adapted to operation on dirt roads
and<00:01:11.010> slowly<00:01:11.550> knock<00:01:11.730> all<00:01:11.910> single<00:01:12.330> tracks<00:01:12.660> and

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
and slowly knock all single tracks and

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.360 
and slowly knock all single tracks and
trails

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:17.370 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:21.260 

so<00:01:18.270> I<00:01:18.300> started<00:01:18.900> with<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.250> single<00:01:20.250> tube<00:01:20.820> I

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
so I started with a single tube I

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.820 
so I started with a single tube I
believe<00:01:21.720> it<00:01:21.840> was<00:01:21.900> a<00:01:21.960> Schwinn<00:01:22.350> but<00:01:22.590> I'm<00:01:22.680> not

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:54.870 
in those days the tires they weren't too

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:56.540 
in those days the tires they weren't too
bad<00:01:55.050> because<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.980> kids<00:01:56.190> would<00:01:56.400> get

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
mean-looking tires to make their bike

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.990 
mean-looking tires to make their bike
look<00:01:58.650> tough<00:01:58.980> so<00:01:59.220> you<00:01:59.280> had<00:01:59.550> an<00:01:59.730> aggressive

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
look tough so you had an aggressive

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.690 
look tough so you had an aggressive
off-road<00:02:00.960> tread<00:02:01.380> with<00:02:01.650> without<00:02:02.250> going<00:02:02.520> to<00:02:02.670> any

off-road tread with without going to any
great<00:02:02.970> trouble<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:05.090> trickier<00:02:06.090> problems<00:02:06.570> had

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
great trouble the trickier problems had

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.690 
great trouble the trickier problems had
to<00:02:06.870> do<00:02:07.050> with<00:02:07.230> the<00:02:07.320> gearing<00:02:07.650> so<00:02:08.100> I<00:02:08.130> decided<00:02:08.520> to

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
to do with the gearing so I decided to

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.790 
to do with the gearing so I decided to
see<00:02:08.850> what<00:02:08.880> I<00:02:09.060> could<00:02:09.149> do<00:02:09.540> with<00:02:09.810> a<00:02:10.260> sturmey

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
see what I could do with a sturmey

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.390 
see what I could do with a sturmey
archer for<00:02:11.490> speed<00:02:11.850> hub<00:02:12.240> i<00:02:12.540> promptly<00:02:13.400> screwed

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
archer for speed hub i promptly screwed

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.030 
archer for speed hub i promptly screwed
a<00:02:14.640> freewheel<00:02:15.570> onto<00:02:16.110> it<00:02:16.260> pound<00:02:16.530> it<00:02:16.650> down<00:02:16.830> to

there<00:02:19.320> was<00:02:19.470> a<00:02:19.500> design<00:02:19.890> problem<00:02:20.220> sturmey<00:02:20.910> hubs

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
there was a design problem sturmey hubs

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.390 
there was a design problem sturmey hubs

balloon<00:02:35.670> tire<00:02:36.030> bike<00:02:36.390> was<00:02:36.750> that<00:02:36.900> it<00:02:36.989> was<00:02:37.380> best

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
balloon tire bike was that it was best

balloon tire bike was that it was best
regard<00:02:37.980> as<00:02:38.100> a<00:02:38.190> proof<00:02:38.459> of<00:02:38.610> concept<00:02:38.880> idea<00:02:40.370> it

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
regard as a proof of concept idea it

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.460 
regard as a proof of concept idea it
showed<00:02:41.670> that<00:02:41.700> the<00:02:41.970> big<00:02:42.120> tires<00:02:42.420> worked<00:02:42.780> it

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
showed that the big tires worked it

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.470 
showed that the big tires worked it
showed<00:02:43.770> that<00:02:43.950> low<00:02:44.100> gears<00:02:44.489> really<00:02:45.209> paid<00:02:45.450> off
