that's<00:00:47.370> what's<00:00:47.640> got<00:00:47.850> my<00:00:48.059> attention<00:00:48.289> how<00:00:49.289> do

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
that's what's got my attention how do

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.290 
that's what's got my attention how do
you<00:00:49.530> do<00:00:49.680> that<00:00:49.710> what<00:00:50.070> is<00:00:50.250> that<00:00:50.280> all<00:00:50.579> about<00:00:50.610> so

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
you do that what is that all about so

becomes<00:01:37.920> okay<00:01:38.579> now<00:01:38.729> Michael<00:01:39.119> this<00:01:39.360> almost

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
becomes okay now Michael this almost

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.609 
becomes okay now Michael this almost
sounds<00:01:40.290> too<00:01:40.770> good<00:01:41.009> to<00:01:41.280> be<00:01:41.430> true<00:01:41.549> so<00:01:42.119> I<00:01:42.689> mean

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
sounds too good to be true so I mean

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.289 
sounds too good to be true so I mean
what<00:01:43.979> type<00:01:44.159> of<00:01:44.189> scientists<00:01:44.820> has<00:01:44.909> cooked<00:01:45.149> this

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
what type of scientists has cooked this

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.069 
what type of scientists has cooked this
thing<00:01:45.540> up<00:01:45.750> so<00:01:46.500> our<00:01:46.829> inventor<00:01:47.689> this<00:01:48.689> is<00:01:48.869> his

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
thing up so our inventor this is his

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.160 
thing up so our inventor this is his
sixth<00:01:49.530> successful<00:01:50.009> startup<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:51.030> he<00:01:51.720> has<00:01:51.840> put

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
sixth successful startup and he has put

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.920 
sixth successful startup and he has put
things<00:01:52.740> together<00:01:53.009> from<00:01:53.610> cellulosic<00:01:54.420> world

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
things together from cellulosic world

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.889 
things together from cellulosic world
he's<00:01:55.290> put<00:01:55.560> things<00:01:55.829> together<00:01:56.719> from<00:01:57.719> the

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
he's put things together from the

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.190 
he's put things together from the
combustion<00:01:58.469> internal<00:01:59.130> combustion<00:01:59.759> world<00:02:00.200> and

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
combustion internal combustion world and

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.260 
combustion internal combustion world and
then<00:02:01.409> we've<00:02:01.560> got<00:02:01.590> catalytic<00:02:02.460> scientists<00:02:03.149> and

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
then we've got catalytic scientists and

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.929 
then we've got catalytic scientists and
help<00:02:03.479> us<00:02:03.659> to<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.229> catalysis<00:02:04.590> process<00:02:05.399> to

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
help us to the catalysis process to

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.020 
help us to the catalysis process to
build<00:02:06.240> this<00:02:06.420> fuel<00:02:06.799> we're<00:02:07.799> making<00:02:08.129> fuel<00:02:08.459> today

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
build this fuel we're making fuel today

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.690 
build this fuel we're making fuel today
making<00:02:09.840> gallons<00:02:10.200> of<00:02:10.590> it<00:02:10.770> we<00:02:11.190> have<00:02:11.280> cars<00:02:11.580> that

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
making gallons of it we have cars that

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.790 
making gallons of it we have cars that
run<00:02:12.150> that's<00:02:12.660> why<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:12.959> two

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
run that's why the two

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.590
