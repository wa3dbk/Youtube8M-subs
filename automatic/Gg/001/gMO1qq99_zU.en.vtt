are going to do a quick review and also
a<00:00:23.609> compression<00:00:24.150> of<00:00:24.210> both<00:00:24.390> of<00:00:24.420> these<00:00:25.789> when

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
a compression of both of these when

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.169 
a compression of both of these when
talking<00:00:27.029> about<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:28.699> action<00:00:29.699> point<00:00:29.939> of<00:00:30.029> view

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
talking about the action point of view

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.179 
talking about the action point of view
you<00:00:30.570> can<00:00:30.750> find<00:00:31.050> that<00:00:31.260> both<00:00:31.439> of<00:00:31.470> them<00:00:31.859> have

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
you can find that both of them have

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.139 
you can find that both of them have
almost<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.850> same<00:00:33.649> thickness<00:00:34.880> both<00:00:35.880> almost

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
almost the same thickness both almost

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.040 
almost the same thickness both almost
look<00:00:36.510> similar<00:00:37.010> except<00:00:38.010> that<00:00:38.210> on<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.510> micromax

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
look similar except that on the micromax

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.100 
look similar except that on the micromax
funbook<00:00:40.140> you<00:00:40.590> get<00:00:40.800> a<00:00:40.829> few<00:00:41.660> physical<00:00:42.660> buttons

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
funbook you get a few physical buttons

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.000 
funbook you get a few physical buttons
for<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.590> poem<00:00:44.399> a<00:00:45.140> back<00:00:46.140> button<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.860> menu

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.080 
for the poem a back button and the menu
key<00:00:47.309> so<00:00:48.120> that<00:00:48.149> is<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.780> difference<00:00:50.030> at<00:00:51.030> least

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
key so that is the difference at least

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.689 
key so that is the difference at least
in<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.510> front<00:00:51.750> part<00:00:52.020> on<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.739> sides<00:00:52.980> as<00:00:53.340> you

you<00:02:27.130> keep<00:02:27.610> both<00:02:27.850> of<00:02:27.970> the<00:02:28.060> tablets<00:02:28.420> on<00:02:28.630> the

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
you keep both of the tablets on the

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.750 
you keep both of the tablets on the
table<00:02:30.540> the<00:02:31.540> viewing<00:02:31.870> angle<00:02:32.230> for<00:02:32.500> the<00:02:33.430> fun<00:02:33.610> book

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
table the viewing angle for the fun book

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.430 
table the viewing angle for the fun book
is<00:02:33.880> quite<00:02:34.180> better<00:02:34.390> because<00:02:34.720> you<00:02:34.870> can<00:02:34.900> directly

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
is quite better because you can directly

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.080 
is quite better because you can directly
watch<00:02:35.709> what's<00:02:36.010> happening<00:02:36.250> on<00:02:36.610> to<00:02:36.760> the<00:02:36.850> screen

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
watch what's happening on to the screen

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.240 
watch what's happening on to the screen
even<00:02:37.840> though<00:02:37.959> the<00:02:38.140> icons<00:02:38.709> which<00:02:38.950> you<00:02:39.100> will<00:02:39.220> see

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
even though the icons which you will see

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.220 
even though the icons which you will see
are<00:02:39.730> actually<00:02:40.030> black<00:02:40.630> route<00:02:40.840> but<00:02:41.019> at<00:02:41.110> least

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
are actually black route but at least

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.050 
are actually black route but at least
there<00:02:41.440> is<00:02:41.500> some<00:02:41.709> display<00:02:42.340> and<00:02:42.610> when<00:02:42.970> you

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
there is some display and when you

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.250 
there is some display and when you
directly<00:02:44.100> see<00:02:45.100> it<00:02:45.780> then<00:02:46.780> it's<00:02:46.959> clearly

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
directly see it then it's clearly

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.190 
directly see it then it's clearly
visible<00:02:47.470> but<00:02:47.769> in<00:02:47.890> case<00:02:48.040> of<00:02:48.070> the<00:02:48.550> enoli<00:02:49.090> LF<00:02:49.330> the

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
visible but in case of the enoli LF the

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.100 
visible but in case of the enoli LF the
viewing<00:02:50.950> angle<00:02:51.220> is<00:02:51.400> not<00:02:52.090> perfect<00:02:52.540> and<00:02:52.720> you

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
viewing angle is not perfect and you

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:54.809 
viewing angle is not perfect and you
need<00:02:53.260> to<00:02:53.380> keep<00:02:53.590> the<00:02:53.680> tablet<00:02:54.040> just<00:02:54.250> before<00:02:54.640> your

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:54.819 
need to keep the tablet just before your

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:58.710 
need to keep the tablet just before your
face<00:02:55.650> so<00:02:56.650> anyway<00:02:56.980> that's<00:02:57.850> another<00:02:58.540> difference

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
face so anyway that's another difference

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.110 
face so anyway that's another difference

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
but there is a huge difference in the

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.670 
but there is a huge difference in the
campus<00:03:37.269> even<00:03:37.959> though<00:03:38.019> there<00:03:38.140> is<00:03:38.200> no<00:03:38.290> camera<00:03:38.620> in

the<00:03:38.859> back<00:03:39.040> on<00:03:39.310> both<00:03:39.519> of<00:03:39.670> this<00:03:39.820> so<00:03:40.269> if<00:03:41.230> you<00:03:41.410> are

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
the back on both of this so if you are

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.289 
the back on both of this so if you are
looking<00:03:41.560> for<00:03:41.890> tablet<00:03:42.340> with<00:03:42.489> a<00:03:42.519> camera<00:03:42.910> for

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:43.299 
looking for tablet with a camera for

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:45.180 
looking for tablet with a camera for
video<00:03:43.630> chat<00:03:43.840> then<00:03:44.320> we<00:03:44.530> would<00:03:44.650> say<00:03:44.769> sure<00:03:44.950> to<00:03:45.070> go

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
video chat then we would say sure to go

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.330 
video chat then we would say sure to go
4lf<00:03:45.760> because<00:03:46.150> of<00:03:46.450> the<00:03:47.109> two<00:03:47.260> megapixel<00:03:47.530> quality

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
4lf because of the two megapixel quality

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.120 
4lf because of the two megapixel quality
so<00:03:49.090> that's<00:03:49.299> one<00:03:49.480> another<00:03:49.900> difference<00:03:50.290> apart

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
so that's one another difference apart

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.370 
so that's one another difference apart
from<00:03:51.220> that<00:03:51.310> both<00:03:51.609> of<00:03:51.640> these<00:03:51.910> comes<00:03:52.239> with<00:03:52.690> a<00:03:52.989> lot
