00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.370
 if you like the design of iphone 6 are 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:14.170
 sure you also like to tell you blake if 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:16.539
 in many it puts us that if information on 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:19.289
 this smartphone is finally here 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:21.490
 here as you have enough box 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:26.249
 anonymous 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:29.489
 behind it are the data with the various 

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:32.800
 device features 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:36.309
 we opened the box there were seals 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:39.489
 which I have already removed to facilitate 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:42.699
 the opening here is the phone like 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:48.870
 see with plastic cover both 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:48.870
 in front of which I make the guarantee behind 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:01:00.910
 below we have on one side the 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:10.990
 usb charger with which the little one 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:12.520
 small has come out of an ample fury from 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:19.540
 this one instead breaks out a little more 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:22.810
 we have large manuals on one side 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.140
 for which they explain the picture already on the phone 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.240
 etc. etc 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:30.399
 the accident that we leave it aside 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:34.869
 here we enter instead we have from one 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:39.270
 part this contraption that I would be for 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:41.680
 pull out drawers of the sim and the 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:46.560
 micro sd card here instead we have a 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:50.229
 normal micro usb cable on the phone 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:53.530
 here it is as you can see it's enough 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:57.219
 great and I compared to a 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:02:02.829
 nexus 4 as you can see slightly more 

00:01:57.219 --> 00:02:05.710
 big but not too much then one 

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:08.560
 5 inch screen with HD resolution 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:11.410
 then 1280 x 720 points 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.600
 then we have a 5 in front 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.630
 megapixel 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.010
 on the back we have one from thirteen 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:21.990
 the other that looks like candles but in reality it is 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:24.180
 plastic and absolutely plastic and not 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:26.280
 unfortunately a bit more noble but 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.250
 that goes well stop because here the 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.420
 discussion of what is best we have 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.420
 inside a qualcomm processor 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.740
 room was with 615 2gb of ram 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.540
 internal number among other things 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:46.070
 expandable because if we take the 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:46.070
 our very useful accessory we can 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:56.550
 we have some drawers open 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:59.100
 plug for the sims are two nano a 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:03.630
 sim that can be put inside 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:05.910
 together after which they have the here 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.980
 drawer for the micro sd I already have 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.080
 put in a micro sd 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.600
 among other things it is very easy to do it 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:16.500
 come back but I guess it's also 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:18.300
 question of habit than to say the 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:23.010
 phone looks really very much 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:24.720
 cute and has a very nice design 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.660
 quite like that of iphone 6 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:31.050
 although not the same but already already 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:34.380
 blade name s6 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:40.170
 how to say, imagine what it is 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:42.990
 of inspiration we remove this newsstand 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:45.590
 let's put it aside let's proceed with the 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:45.590
 first ignition 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:55.650
 I put the new zte logo recently 

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:57.629
 so become a bit simpler like 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.219
 they say a little more playful 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:02.670
 personally I find it simply a 

00:03:59.219 --> 00:04:04.680
 more modern and more stylized than others 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:07.319
 the previous one has lost the characters 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:14.639
 Chinese in the international market 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:17.070
 was not very successful in 

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:23.360
 meanwhile, as you can see, one thing 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:26.580
 is that here the edges are continuous so 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:29.940
 the glass is practically curved too 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:32.370
 above and there is no solution of continuity 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.500
 between the curve of the plastic is that of the 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:37.080
 glass for which practically the effect is 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.810
 really interesting 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:44.780
 they now look for Italian ahead 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:51.960
 android 5.0 lollipop another lady 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:53.940
 Madam okay by you now we are a 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:58.889
 london we are on the time zone of 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:05:05.840
 brussels is definitely not the 1970s for 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:05.840
 referred to 2015 

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:19.039
 and we are at the 19th of February 

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:19.039
 here we are now the time is 18 12 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.400
 we are the 13 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:40.940
 ok as you can see while there is the 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:40.940
 touch keyboard and card surname 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:48.970
 forward 

00:05:49.939 --> 00:06:06.990
 the first one is perfect 

00:05:54.719 --> 00:06:13.379
 configuration ok taking out a little 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:16.020
 those who are notifications 

00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:18.629
 in short, however , the tests without 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:20.520
 custom must say is not 

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:23.789
 the stop interface 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:27.719
 here we got used to google we have this 

00:06:23.789 --> 00:06:30.330
 slightly revised interface from da 

00:06:27.719 --> 00:06:32.189
 zte actually yesterday was without 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:34.199
 heavily we don't have the drawer 

00:06:32.189 --> 00:06:35.819
 applications as we are used to 

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:37.740
 see it on android we have these 

00:06:35.819 --> 00:06:39.900
 screenshots that remember will go a lot 

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:41.520
 very closely those of vaio s always 

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:45.599
 for precisely highlighting the 

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:48.120
 similarity to the apple phone 

00:06:45.599 --> 00:06:51.479
 applications think enough though 

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:54.060
 since there are mostly things I would say 

00:06:51.479 --> 00:06:59.550
 useful the notepad for example the 

00:06:54.060 --> 00:07:00.589
 torch people lollipop radio music e 

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:03.150
 etc 

00:07:00.589 --> 00:07:09.060
 there is also a backup function e 

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:12.870
 restore closed browser 

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:16.409
 vv ps office which is the old kingsoft 

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:20.210
 office clean master and facebook and twitter 

00:07:16.409 --> 00:07:24.149
 for it we then have the whole lot 

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:28.860
 google and little application collection 

00:07:24.149 --> 00:07:33.569
 other than to say for the moment I would say that 

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:36.360
 he concluded here I refer you to the article 

00:07:33.569 --> 00:07:40.889
 which will be published on the blog together with 

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:42.839
 this video and then to the review more 

00:07:40.889 --> 00:07:44.610
 complete will arrive in a few days for 

00:07:42.839 --> 00:07:47.300
 the moment is everything from riccardo pro
