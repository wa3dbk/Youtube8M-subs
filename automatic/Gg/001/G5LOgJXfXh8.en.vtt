00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
important during the starvation period

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.210 
important during the starvation period

and during the bland diet period is that

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.610

you cat hasn't access to any other food

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.710 
you cat hasn't access to any other food

so if you can't normally goes outside

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.410 
so if you can't normally goes outside
this<00:03:04.319> means<00:03:04.560> it<00:03:04.709> needs<00:03:04.920> to<00:03:05.100> be<00:03:05.220> kept<00:03:05.459> in<00:03:05.700> now

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
this means it needs to be kept in now

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.180 
this means it needs to be kept in now
cats<00:03:06.750> that<00:03:06.900> go<00:03:07.080> outside<00:03:07.290> will<00:03:07.799> normally

cats that go outside will normally
toilet<00:03:08.640> outside<00:03:09.239> so<00:03:09.959> you<00:03:10.019> will<00:03:10.230> need<00:03:10.410> to

days of bland diet you can then slowly

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.020 
days of bland diet you can then slowly
reintroduce<00:03:22.200> its<00:03:22.470> normal<00:03:23.010> diet<00:03:23.040> providing

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
its remained well and how we do that is

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.539 
its remained well and how we do that is
to<00:03:27.030> make<00:03:27.359> some<00:03:27.570> of<00:03:27.690> its<00:03:27.810> normal<00:03:28.170> diet<00:03:28.380> in<00:03:29.280> with

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
three to four days we would hope that

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:35.990 
three to four days we would hope that
things<00:03:34.500> would<00:03:34.709> settle<00:03:34.980> down<00:03:35.310> but<00:03:35.609> at<00:03:35.700> any

things would settle down but at any

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.840 
things would settle down but at any
period<00:03:36.470> should<00:03:37.470> the<00:03:37.590> cat<00:03:37.769> become<00:03:38.130> unwell<00:03:38.549> or
