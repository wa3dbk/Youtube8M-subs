but<00:02:58.720> the<00:02:58.840> fact<00:02:58.959> is<00:02:59.140> they<00:02:59.260> did<00:02:59.410> go<00:02:59.530> 11<00:02:59.890> and<00:03:00.010> 2

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
but the fact is they did go 11 and 2

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.400 
but the fact is they did go 11 and 2
against<00:03:00.370> the<00:03:00.489> number<00:03:00.760> last<00:03:01.300> year<00:03:01.750> so<00:03:02.140> here's<00:03:02.350> a

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
against the number last year so here's a

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.650 
against the number last year so here's a
team<00:03:02.680> that<00:03:03.100> the<00:03:03.280> bookmakers<00:03:03.910> and<00:03:03.940> the<00:03:04.300> betters

team that the bookmakers and the betters
I<00:03:04.870> think<00:03:05.110> have<00:03:05.230> consistently<00:03:06.000> undervalue

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
I think have consistently undervalue

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.580 
I think have consistently undervalue
what<00:03:07.150> Malzahn<00:03:07.420> has<00:03:07.870> been<00:03:08.020> able<00:03:08.140> to<00:03:08.260> do<00:03:08.440> there

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
what Malzahn has been able to do there

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.080 
what Malzahn has been able to do there
and<00:03:08.770> we<00:03:09.130> might<00:03:09.280> go<00:03:09.400> look<00:03:09.520> back<00:03:09.700> in<00:03:09.820> this<00:03:09.940> and

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
and we might go look back in this and

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.310 
and we might go look back in this and
say<00:03:10.209> wow<00:03:10.360> they<00:03:10.570> didn't<00:03:10.840> pick<00:03:10.959> up<00:03:11.050> on<00:03:11.170> the<00:03:11.290> fact

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
things of that nature i saw him out here

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:25.830 
things of that nature i saw him out here
a<00:03:24.100> couple<00:03:24.280> of<00:03:24.489> years<00:03:24.549> before<00:03:25.510> he<00:03:25.570> took<00:03:25.690> the

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
a couple of years before he took the

a couple of years before he took the
auburn<00:03:26.170> job<00:03:26.380> or<00:03:26.590> I<00:03:26.620> guess<00:03:26.860> the<00:03:27.010> year<00:03:27.190> before

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
auburn job or I guess the year before

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.710 
auburn job or I guess the year before
because<00:03:27.640> he<00:03:27.700> was<00:03:27.820> only<00:03:28.000> at<00:03:28.090> Iowa<00:03:28.269> State<00:03:28.299> for<00:03:28.690> a

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
because he was only at Iowa State for a

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.680 
because he was only at Iowa State for a
cup<00:03:28.959> of<00:03:29.049> coffee<00:03:29.110> and<00:03:30.000> his<00:03:31.000> team<00:03:31.269> was<00:03:31.420> the<00:03:31.540> most

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
cup of coffee and his team was the most

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.030 
cup of coffee and his team was the most
undisciplined<00:03:31.989> football<00:03:32.590> team<00:03:32.799> that<00:03:32.950> I've

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
undisciplined football team that I've

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.100 
undisciplined football team that I've
ever<00:03:33.220> seen<00:03:33.489> I<00:03:33.760> used<00:03:34.269> to<00:03:34.330> go<00:03:34.420> to<00:03:34.480> every<00:03:34.690> UNLV

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.050 
ever seen I used to go to every UNLV
home<00:03:35.260> game<00:03:35.500> so<00:03:35.920> if<00:03:36.070> I<00:03:36.190> say<00:03:36.400> that<00:03:36.580> another<00:03:36.790> team

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
home game so if I say that another team

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.580 
home game so if I say that another team
besides<00:03:37.239> UNLV<00:03:37.900> was<00:03:38.019> the<00:03:38.110> most<00:03:38.260> undisciplined

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
how bad it was we SAT back then when I

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:45.960 
how bad it was we SAT back then when I
used<00:03:44.590> to<00:03:44.680> go<00:03:44.739> to<00:03:44.890> the<00:03:44.980> games<00:03:45.190> usually<00:03:45.880> around

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
my whole point was making a short story

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
appreciate what Gus Malzahn has done

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.080 
appreciate what Gus Malzahn has done
because<00:04:16.359> under<00:04:16.630> Chizik<00:04:17.079> this<00:04:17.859> program<00:04:18.760> was<00:04:18.940> in

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
because under Chizik this program was in

away from all the hoopla all the hype

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:04.339 
away from all the hoopla all the hype
and<00:05:02.590> the<00:05:03.039> fans<00:05:03.340> and<00:05:03.550> everything<00:05:03.849> else<00:05:04.029> that

00:05:04.339 --> 00:05:04.349 
and the fans and everything else that

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:06.689 
and the fans and everything else that
might<00:05:05.349> play<00:05:05.590> a<00:05:05.620> small<00:05:05.889> part<00:05:05.949> of<00:05:06.340> this<00:05:06.400> but<00:05:06.610> what

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:06.699 
might play a small part of this but what

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:07.709 
might play a small part of this but what
it<00:05:06.789> really<00:05:06.819> comes<00:05:07.090> down<00:05:07.210> to<00:05:07.360> is<00:05:07.599> I<00:05:07.659> think

00:05:07.709 --> 00:05:07.719 
it really comes down to is I think

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:09.809 
it really comes down to is I think
Auburn<00:05:08.110> is<00:05:08.169> just<00:05:08.289> better<00:05:08.529> at<00:05:08.860> what<00:05:09.610> they<00:05:09.639> do

00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:09.819 
Auburn is just better at what they do

00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:11.459 
Auburn is just better at what they do
then<00:05:10.240> Mississippi<00:05:10.750> State<00:05:10.930> is<00:05:11.050> theirs<00:05:11.259> to<00:05:11.349> a
