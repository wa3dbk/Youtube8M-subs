00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:34.510 
power-ups we got rainbow of doom and

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.040 
power-ups we got rainbow of doom and
tempest<00:00:34.930> cloud<00:00:35.550> rainbow<00:00:36.550> chain<00:00:37.050> triple

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:43.930 
then some of the advanced leveling up so

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.079 
then some of the advanced leveling up so
I<00:00:43.960> got<00:00:44.140> double<00:00:44.409> dose<00:00:44.650> of<00:00:44.829> doom<00:00:45.040> which<00:00:45.909> will

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:46.089 
I got double dose of doom which will

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:48.299 
I got double dose of doom which will
toss<00:00:46.300> out<00:00:46.540> more<00:00:46.780> rainbows<00:00:47.320> and<00:00:47.800> then<00:00:48.100> this

rainbow singularity is kind of like this

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.490 
rainbow singularity is kind of like this
large<00:00:51.210> heavy-duty<00:00:52.210> powerup

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:53.500 
large heavy-duty powerup

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.380 
large heavy-duty powerup
let<00:00:53.829> me<00:00:53.920> show<00:00:54.100> you<00:00:54.190> so<00:00:54.370> here's<00:00:54.519> the<00:00:54.609> AAA<00:00:54.760> attack

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:55.390 
let me show you so here's the AAA attack

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.299 
let me show you so here's the AAA attack
I<00:00:55.600> could<00:00:55.750> I<00:00:55.930> could<00:00:56.170> do<00:00:56.260> two<00:00:56.469> rainbows<00:00:56.920> at<00:00:57.100> once

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:57.309 
I could I could do two rainbows at once

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:00.689 
I could I could do two rainbows at once
and<00:00:57.670> one<00:00:58.059> goes<00:00:58.300> kind<00:00:58.539> of<00:00:58.629> short<00:00:58.989> and<00:00:59.920> one<00:01:00.489> goes

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:00.699 
and one goes kind of short and one goes

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:02.759 
and one goes kind of short and one goes
kind<00:01:00.969> of<00:01:01.030> far<00:01:01.329> and<00:01:01.600> it's<00:01:02.140> useful<00:01:02.320> if<00:01:02.620> you<00:01:02.739> have

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:28.329 

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:32.550 

it's<00:01:28.810> a<00:01:28.869> little<00:01:29.079> overkill<00:01:29.530> here<00:01:29.859> with<00:01:31.560> these

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560

guys

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
guys

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.510 
guys
alright<00:01:34.600> so<00:01:34.810> I<00:01:34.869> opened<00:01:35.229> up<00:01:35.289> the<00:01:35.500> door<00:01:35.710> by

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
alright so I opened up the door by

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:42.029 
alright so I opened up the door by
hitting<00:01:36.700> the<00:01:36.880> two<00:01:37.090> eyes<00:01:40.469> so<00:01:41.469> let's<00:01:41.649> see<00:01:41.860> the

00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:42.039 
hitting the two eyes so let's see the

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:45.149 
hitting the two eyes so let's see the
other<00:01:42.159> power<00:01:42.460> up<00:01:42.610> is<00:01:42.819> the<00:01:43.710> thing<00:01:44.710> called<00:01:44.950> the

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:45.159 
other power up is the thing called the

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:50.910 
other power up is the thing called the
rainbow<00:01:45.460> singularity<00:01:49.409> so<00:01:50.409> if<00:01:50.530> you<00:01:50.590> hold<00:01:50.799> down

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
rainbow singularity so if you hold down

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.149 
rainbow singularity so if you hold down
a<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:53.020> you<00:01:53.140> can<00:01:53.319> kind<00:01:53.469> of<00:01:53.530> walk<00:01:53.709> a<00:01:53.770> little<00:01:54.009> bit

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
a and you can kind of walk a little bit

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:56.609 
a and you can kind of walk a little bit
as<00:01:54.429> you<00:01:54.579> see<00:01:54.759> this<00:01:54.909> it's<00:01:55.179> a<00:01:55.270> black<00:01:56.229> ball

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 
as you see this it's a black ball

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:59.609 
as you see this it's a black ball
forming<00:01:57.310> in<00:01:57.399> front<00:01:57.429> of<00:01:57.729> me<00:01:57.850> and<00:01:58.200> I<00:01:59.200> can<00:01:59.409> walk

00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619 
forming in front of me and I can walk

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:01.699 
forming in front of me and I can walk
and<00:02:00.009> hold<00:02:00.159> that<00:02:00.340> down<00:02:00.640> and<00:02:00.700> when<00:02:00.970> I<00:02:01.000> let<00:02:01.239> go<00:02:01.270> it

00:02:01.699 --> 00:02:01.709 
and hold that down and when I let go it

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:07.699 
and hold that down and when I let go it
shoots<00:02:02.709> out<00:02:02.890> this<00:02:03.159> like<00:02:03.399> slow<00:02:04.619> little<00:02:05.619> magic

00:02:07.699 --> 00:02:07.709 
shoots out this like slow little magic

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:11.490 
shoots out this like slow little magic
magic<00:02:08.709> drink<00:02:09.130> Oh<00:02:09.280> for<00:02:09.640> texting<00:02:10.260> let's<00:02:11.260> see<00:02:11.410> if

singularity<00:02:30.130> thing<00:02:30.730> is<00:02:31.800> that<00:02:32.800> because<00:02:33.130> it

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
singularity thing is that because it

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.400 
singularity thing is that because it
uses<00:02:33.640> the<00:02:33.760> first<00:02:34.270> attack<00:02:34.570> Day<00:02:34.780> button
