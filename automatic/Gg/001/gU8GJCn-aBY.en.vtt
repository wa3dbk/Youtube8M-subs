00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:05.360
 Hello, how are you all today? 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.890
 I will teach how to tie a tie knot 

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:10.170
 new elegant tie that is going to 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.260
 see well that it will serve you for all 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.260
 chance 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.010
 and they're going to see what's going to be the knot type 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.200
 that you will like more user is the 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.790
 what else I use then the first thing that 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.640
 let's do is pass our tie 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:26.250
 by our neck and we are going to place the 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.260
 thicker part on our right side 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.310
 and the thinnest part of our side 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.759
 left 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.700
 and we are going to cross the longest part and 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.580
 thick of 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.430
 in front of the smallest part 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:41.750
 approximately at this distance 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.850
 do not worry about this part 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.410
 it is very small 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.510
 will be approximately this 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.699
 distance so that when closing 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.769
 the knot has the shape of the distance 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:55.280
 correct then what are we going to do 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:59.640
 is to spend our tie in the most 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:03.000
 thick across and back 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.519
 let's go through here back and then 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.570
 forward and we will load it towards 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.570
 our left side 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.790
 once we do this we're going to 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.009
 go backwards from behind and we're going to 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.390
 change direction either never release 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.610
 in this part of here the most 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.700
 thin so we saw the shanghai 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.619
 knot and they will move to this side 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.080
 right and the right side are going to 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:32.920
 move from front to back 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:36.820
 squeezing either not exaggerating how 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:39.610
 it's staying like that and then again what 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.900
 we charge towards our right side 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.180
 and we're going to move on our side 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.650
 right in front of our side 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.410
 left 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:50.170
 see how the turn covers the knot if 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:53.350
 both below and above 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.420
 and good the right side 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.720
 the frog do not release in this part of here 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:02.909
 below and what we are going to do now is 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:04.710
 move from our left side 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:10.170
 backward 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:11.640
 and we're not going to move to the tip of here and 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.970
 we're going to go through the egg that we 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.210
 it is when we pass the tie by 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.220
 ahead 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:20.910
 and very careful 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:24.000
 let's move on 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:26.100
 when it is necessary if we go here 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.110
 to tighten 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.390
 and here is a very important part we are going to 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.980
 do so let's put a little bit there 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.630
 you see in the mirror how it goes 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:39.060
 staying etcetera always and also and 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.470
 notice that here sometimes you go back to the 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.720
 back but it's not a matter of 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.060
 turn around notice that I have 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.940
 problem that many shirts is not 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:51.600
 mention the collar and if I buy shirt 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:53.400
 bigger is not too big in 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.819
 this part of here yes then it 's like 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.099
 a shirt that looks great 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:00.079
 corresponds to my body but the problem 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:01.180
 is that I have a hard time closing the 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:02.709
 button 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.750
 and well you're not supposed to 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:06.969
 close the button to be able to wear a tie 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.409
 but we are going to do a little 

00:03:06.969 --> 00:03:10.659
 of trap 

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:13.420
 and we're going to adjust the tie and to 

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:18.740
 that is the knot that is bigger 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:22.120
 let's push a little yes well 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:22.120
 what a millionately knot 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:30.590
 as the tie 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:33.940
 and the correct distance that you put in 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:38.210
 rights the correct distance is not like that 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:40.490
 not like that but the tip of the tie 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:44.030
 really just in the buckle of 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:46.070
 belt if you should not cover it you can 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:49.740
 it seems a little bit etcetera but what 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:56.130
 correct is that it is not left like this 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:58.650
 but deposit the distance level 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.420
 of the tie and depending on your 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.600
 stature of his body the 7 was you 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:05.010
 can go through the tie to the 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.540
 principle as I told them I told them a 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.300
 certain distance from you according to 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:13.730
 his collection so his body is going 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:13.730
 changing worse since you already know the process 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:21.449
 we do not need to take advantage of the shirt 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:24.930
 If you need to tighten a little more 

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:28.800
 because they shout us more but this one is 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:30.930
 the knot that I think is the best is more 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.990
 elegant looks good does not look like 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:37.350
 high school boy with a single turn 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:39.900
 that's the two-turn knot and good 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:44.310
 I hope you have served this good 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:47.360
 comment on the video this blog 7 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:50.400
 and they want to know something else 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:54.200
 they write I try to solve them 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.200
 the chao thank you very much
