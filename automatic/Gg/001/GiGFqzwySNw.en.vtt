and as I come come up on those I'm
putting<00:02:27.120> them<00:02:27.180> on<00:02:27.360> the<00:02:27.450> shelf<00:02:27.780> some<00:02:28.590> point<00:02:28.830> in

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
putting them on the shelf some point in

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.410 
putting them on the shelf some point in
time<00:02:28.950> I<00:02:29.100> think<00:02:29.250> I'm<00:02:29.490> going<00:02:29.640> to<00:02:29.670> run<00:02:29.790> out<00:02:29.850> of<00:02:30.000> 20

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
time I think I'm going to run out of 20

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.870 
time I think I'm going to run out of 20
so<00:02:30.800> 21<00:02:31.800> is<00:02:32.040> going<00:02:32.220> to<00:02:32.280> be<00:02:32.370> set<00:02:32.580> up<00:02:32.610> for<00:02:32.820> the

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
so 21 is going to be set up for the

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.330 
so 21 is going to be set up for the
front<00:02:33.180> and<00:02:33.390> I<00:02:33.570> made<00:02:33.840> you<00:02:33.990> a<00:02:34.020> 17<00:02:34.770> rear<00:02:35.100> on<00:02:35.310> a

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
front and I made you a 17 rear on a

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.690 
front and I made you a 17 rear on a
tubeless<00:02:36.290> run<00:02:37.290> the<00:02:37.440> big<00:02:37.650> taro<00:02:38.100> flex<00:02:38.459> on<00:02:38.670> it

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.610 
tubeless run the big taro flex on it
that<00:02:39.060> would<00:02:39.150> be<00:02:39.300> good<00:02:39.540> for<00:02:39.840> like<00:02:39.900> off-road

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
that would be good for like off-road

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.430 
that would be good for like off-road

so<00:03:52.380> I've<00:03:52.739> machined<00:03:53.130> some<00:03:53.340> bugs<00:03:53.790> I<00:03:54.140> bowled

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
so I've machined some bugs I bowled

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.050 
so I've machined some bugs I bowled
about<00:03:55.380> where<00:03:55.530> they<00:03:55.680> went<00:03:56.040> and<00:03:56.250> welded<00:03:56.790> them<00:03:56.910> in

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
about where they went and welded them in

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.479 
about where they went and welded them in
and<00:03:57.390> that<00:03:57.810> turned<00:03:58.260> out<00:03:58.380> really<00:03:58.590> nice<00:03:58.860> but<00:03:59.310> with

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
and that turned out really nice but with
