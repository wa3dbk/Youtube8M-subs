00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.950
 Adams family is one of the most 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:08.749
 unpretentious boarding them 

00:00:08.749 --> 00:00:10.349
 no one among my friends either 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:11.219
 explored 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.240
 I do not know how the rest but for me 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.330
 the atmosphere was very mysterious games 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.529
 It was believed that fascinating that 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:19.500
 put up printing time after time the facade 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.660
 uncomfortable despite the difficulty 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.980
 control some points that are soft 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.349
 say fires but no one 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:29.069
 I was also surprised after the introduction of the tax 

00:00:29.069 --> 00:00:31.279
 we are free to go anywhere before 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:33.390
 I have not seen anything like this for me 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.580
 Very unusual 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.900
 the goal of the game is to save all members 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.020
 families besides that we need to gather 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:40.730
 million which scattered supposedly 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:41.679
 the whole house 

00:00:41.679 --> 00:00:44.129
 and without which it is impossible to pass 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.009
 extremely difficult firstly because 

00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:47.499
 some needed for 

00:00:47.499 --> 00:00:49.420
 passing the secret is so sophisticated 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:50.989
 hidden what to discover simply 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:53.449
 unreal secondly on you constantly what 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:55.089
 then falls literally on each 

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:57.409
 Grimaldi's success step is so much so that with interest 

00:00:57.409 --> 00:00:59.609
 would be enough for a few games 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.170
 horrible things that are never clear 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.389
 what will fall and what does not 

00:01:03.389 --> 00:01:05.560
 cliche the days to as a child I spent 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.390
 a million nerve cells in this place 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.270
 because until then 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.950
 just takes away health and take off 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.509
 supply of two evils therefore 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:13.590
 had to move 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.849
 small steps weapons of them 

00:01:15.849 --> 00:01:17.579
 stipulated dare not fear 

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:19.659
 jump on the head but some so 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:21.179
 reception is not a secret that something is required 

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:23.140
 more effective person like 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:24.390
 ambush 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.200
 the policy of the capital of the Tatars 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.700
 I believe with pleasure 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.940
 distract music that crying will play 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.510
 after he writes 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.920
 in general, it is unusual to take the action day 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.140
 without a car you have to decide 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.010
 all sorts of puzzles to collect 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:40.190
 things and objects 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.370
 we have this opportunity for 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:44.310
 that did not have time to collect for this will require 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.860
 for the monument to be blown up 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.860
 in turn, will help writing edition 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.700
 in particular, the message says 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.520
 and then will be needed when flying 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:55.240
 in Moscow 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.090
 also have to look for ingredients 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.799
 for the drug that will provide grandmother 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.430
 hedgehog which will help release the party this 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.079
 the game is really very interesting 

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:04.880
 original and timely best 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.979
 every pebble every inch of this house but 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:08.739
 despite all my efforts got 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:10.759
 the concert itself stopping in front 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:12.849
 the last period I consider collected 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:13.390
 money 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.240
 lacked quite a bit 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.270
 but until I know what my brother has 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:18.600
 pictures can be closed 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.859
 in Stavropol Dostoevsky 

00:02:20.859 --> 00:02:22.189
 why do the necessary 

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:22.869
 documents for passage 

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:24.119
 secret 

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:26.149
 I am sure that only a few have passed this 

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:28.389
 the rest of the game as well as I dream to know 

00:02:28.389 --> 00:02:29.499
 what is behind this door 

00:02:29.499 --> 00:02:31.589
 comes up imagining different 

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:32.229
 options 

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:34.289
 today all those who studied in the end 

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:35.559
 just games 

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:37.739
 the last room is waiting for you so 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:39.619
 tied marquish which by the way 

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:40.709
 spikes 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.889
 since by nature i am philanthropy moreover 

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:44.969
 waited until they multiply done on 

00:02:44.969 --> 00:02:46.780
 the ending didn't affect it 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.060
 but as if nothing is a reason for jokes 21.15 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:52.809
 but for me personally, one question is whether those who are 

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:55.319
 remained unresolved yet since here 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:58.129
 there are questions maybe he never opened 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:02:58.950
 therefore not worth it
