HTC One m8 and the Sony Xperia z2 to see

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.010 
HTC One m8 and the Sony Xperia z2 to see
which<00:00:14.519> one<00:00:14.759> can<00:00:15.120> handle<00:00:15.450> poor<00:00:15.809> lighting

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
which one can handle poor lighting

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:22.220 
which one can handle poor lighting
conditions<00:00:16.500> best<00:00:20.689> so<00:00:21.689> here<00:00:21.869> we<00:00:21.900> have<00:00:22.020> the

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
conditions best so here we have the

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.099 
conditions best so here we have the
Xperia<00:00:22.769> z2<00:00:23.070> so<00:00:23.580> you<00:00:23.640> can<00:00:23.789> see<00:00:23.970> how<00:00:24.000> it<00:00:24.660> handles

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
Xperia z2 so you can see how it handles

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.450 
Xperia z2 so you can see how it handles
the<00:00:25.260> backlight<00:00:25.680> when<00:00:25.859> you<00:00:25.920> move<00:00:26.070> it<00:00:26.189> up<00:00:26.310> and

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
the backlight when you move it up and

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.759 
the backlight when you move it up and
down<00:00:26.869> it's<00:00:27.869> not<00:00:27.990> an<00:00:28.109> excessive<00:00:28.529> amount<00:00:28.560> of

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
down it's not an excessive amount of

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.380 
down it's not an excessive amount of
bleeding<00:00:29.039> and<00:00:29.250> it's<00:00:29.550> actually<00:00:29.670> pretty<00:00:30.060> quick

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
bleeding and it's actually pretty quick

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.799 
bleeding and it's actually pretty quick
so<00:00:30.900> this<00:00:31.019> is<00:00:31.170> just<00:00:31.289> on<00:00:31.820> intelligent<00:00:32.820> auto<00:00:33.030> so

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
so this is just on intelligent auto so

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.030 
so this is just on intelligent auto so
let's<00:00:33.960> take<00:00:34.050> a<00:00:34.110> couple<00:00:34.260> pictures<00:00:34.350> you<00:00:34.829> can<00:00:34.920> get

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
let's take a couple pictures you can get

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:43.830 
let's take a couple pictures you can get
a<00:00:35.070> closer<00:00:35.309> look

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:43.840 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:58.500 

Millis<00:00:44.620> is<00:00:44.710> it<00:00:44.860> a<00:00:44.950> short<00:00:45.130> video<00:00:57.300> so<00:00:58.300> here<00:00:58.480> we

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510 
Millis is it a short video so here we

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.020 
Millis is it a short video so here we
have<00:00:58.600> the<00:00:58.870> HTC<00:00:59.020> and<00:00:59.680> they<00:00:59.830> see<00:01:00.550> that<00:01:00.699> it's<00:01:00.820> not

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
have the HTC and they see that it's not

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.900 
have the HTC and they see that it's not
handling<00:01:01.629> the<00:01:02.199> backlight<00:01:02.739> very<00:01:03.280> well<00:01:03.610> at<00:01:03.760> all

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:03.910 
handling the backlight very well at all

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.359 
handling the backlight very well at all
it<00:01:04.600> does<00:01:04.900> have<00:01:05.080> some<00:01:05.290> really<00:01:05.530> great<00:01:05.800> features

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:06.369 
it does have some really great features

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:08.670 
it does have some really great features
though<00:01:06.580> for<00:01:06.880> adjusting<00:01:07.270> the<00:01:07.390> ISO<00:01:07.869> and<00:01:08.140> pulling

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
though for adjusting the ISO and pulling

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.290 
though for adjusting the ISO and pulling
down<00:01:08.830> the<00:01:08.860> exposure<00:01:09.430> so<00:01:09.820> we're<00:01:09.970> just<00:01:10.000> going<00:01:10.240> to

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:10.300 
down the exposure so we're just going to

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.820 
down the exposure so we're just going to
do<00:01:10.479> that<00:01:10.690> when<00:01:10.900> I<00:01:10.990> drop<00:01:11.200> the<00:01:11.350> exposure<00:01:11.680> a

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830 
do that when I drop the exposure a

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.530 
do that when I drop the exposure a
little<00:01:12.100> bit<00:01:12.220> see<00:01:12.850> how<00:01:12.970> that<00:01:13.119> handles<00:01:13.510> the

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 
little bit see how that handles the

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.020 
little bit see how that handles the
backlight<00:01:14.160> definitely<00:01:15.160> definitely<00:01:15.580> has

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
backlight definitely definitely has

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.180 
backlight definitely definitely has
handled<00:01:16.600> it<00:01:16.720> a<00:01:16.750> lot<00:01:16.810> better<00:01:16.930> but<00:01:17.590> everything's

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.190 
handled it a lot better but everything's

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.310 
handled it a lot better but everything's
white<00:01:18.700> guard<00:01:19.060> let's<00:01:19.899> just<00:01:19.960> take<00:01:20.170> a<00:01:20.200> couple

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.320 
white guard let's just take a couple

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:30.290 
white guard let's just take a couple
pictures<00:01:20.470> you<00:01:20.950> can<00:01:21.040> get<00:01:21.190> a<00:01:21.220> 90

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:30.300 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.490 

and<00:01:30.780> then<00:01:30.930> let's<00:01:31.110> just<00:01:31.170> take<00:01:31.410> a<00:01:31.470> short<00:01:31.710> video

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
and then let's just take a short video

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.020 
and then let's just take a short video
so<00:01:34.500> in<00:01:34.590> even<00:01:34.740> into<00:01:34.950> video<00:01:35.160> you<00:01:35.370> have<00:01:35.550> the<00:01:35.700> same

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
so in even into video you have the same

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.870 
so in even into video you have the same
settings<00:01:36.540> with<00:01:36.720> iso<00:01:37.110> exposure<00:01:37.680> white<00:01:38.460> balance

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
settings with iso exposure white balance

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.670 
settings with iso exposure white balance
which<00:01:38.970> is<00:01:39.120> all<00:01:39.270> really<00:01:39.450> great<00:01:42.440> so<00:01:43.440> here<00:01:43.590> we

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
which is all really great so here we

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.710 
which is all really great so here we
have<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:44.010> samsung<00:01:44.220> galaxy<00:01:44.790> s5<00:01:45.180> you<00:01:45.420> can<00:01:45.540> see

have the samsung galaxy s5 you can see
its<00:01:45.840> handling<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.320> backlight<00:01:46.830> really<00:01:47.580> really

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:47.940 
its handling the backlight really really

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.540
