00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.550 

I'm<00:00:00.390> about<00:00:00.630> to<00:00:00.840> show<00:00:01.020> you<00:00:01.050> something

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:01.560 
I'm about to show you something

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.740 
I'm about to show you something
wonderful<00:00:01.829> something<00:00:02.310> that<00:00:03.030> will<00:00:03.120> change<00:00:03.419> in

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
wonderful something that will change in

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.070 
wonderful something that will change in
one<00:00:04.290> second<00:00:04.890> the<00:00:05.460> way<00:00:05.670> that<00:00:06.180> you<00:00:06.359> look<00:00:06.629> at

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
one second the way that you look at

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.070 
one second the way that you look at
yourself<00:00:07.680> a<00:00:07.950> perspective<00:00:08.790> that<00:00:09.510> will<00:00:09.660> change

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
yourself a perspective that will change

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.379 
yourself a perspective that will change
what<00:00:10.679> you<00:00:10.889> see<00:00:10.950> when<00:00:11.460> you<00:00:11.580> look<00:00:11.759> up<00:00:11.910> in<00:00:12.030> the<00:00:12.059> sky

that's<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:22.080> Sun<00:00:22.320> that's<00:00:22.949> the<00:00:23.130> bright<00:00:23.400> one

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
currently traveling toward it as fast as

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.819 
currently traveling toward it as fast as
it's<00:00:48.360> possible<00:00:48.840> for<00:00:48.960> physical<00:00:49.410> objects<00:00:49.710> to

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
travel in our universe and through all

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.619 
travel in our universe and through all
the<00:00:52.710> simulations<00:00:52.920> however<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:54.149> laws<00:00:54.360> of

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
the simulations however the laws of

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.979 
the simulations however the laws of
physics<00:00:54.780> become<00:00:55.320> a<00:00:55.350> little<00:00:55.500> more<00:00:56.360> plastic<00:00:57.360> you

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
physics become a little more plastic you

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.170 
physics become a little more plastic you
just<00:00:58.230> have<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:58.530> free<00:00:58.920> your<00:00:59.520> mind

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
just have to free your mind

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.049 
just have to free your mind
so<00:01:01.079> let's<00:01:01.260> accelerate<00:01:01.590> 10<00:01:02.399> times<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.910> speed

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
so let's accelerate 10 times the speed

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.679 
so let's accelerate 10 times the speed
of<00:01:03.210> light<00:01:03.500> 100<00:01:04.500> times<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.920> speed<00:01:05.189> of<00:01:05.220> light

00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:05.689 
of light 100 times the speed of light

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:10.490 
of light 100 times the speed of light
1000<00:01:06.689> times<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.830> speed<00:01:08.159> of<00:01:08.340> light<00:01:09.500> 10,000

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
1000 times the speed of light 10,000

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.289 
1000 times the speed of light 10,000
times<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.979> speed<00:01:11.220> of<00:01:11.310> light<00:01:11.460> at<00:01:11.729> this<00:01:12.030> speed

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
times the speed of light at this speed

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.510 
times the speed of light at this speed
it<00:01:12.479> would<00:01:12.750> only<00:01:12.990> take<00:01:13.140> you<00:01:13.470> about<00:01:13.619> 10<00:01:13.979> seconds

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
it would only take you about 10 seconds

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.880 
it would only take you about 10 seconds
to<00:01:14.670> fly<00:01:15.119> across<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.479> whole<00:01:15.930> of<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.590> solar

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
to fly across the whole of the solar

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.280 
to fly across the whole of the solar
system<00:01:17.310> so<00:01:17.850> right<00:01:18.060> let's<00:01:18.299> slow<00:01:18.750> this<00:01:18.780> down<00:01:18.960> for

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
system so right let's slow this down for

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.280 
system so right let's slow this down for
a<00:01:19.500> Lightspeed<00:01:20.280> flyby<00:01:20.909> of<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.180> largest<00:01:21.930> planet

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
a Lightspeed flyby of the largest planet

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.660 
a Lightspeed flyby of the largest planet
Jupiter<00:01:23.090> just<00:01:24.090> for<00:01:24.299> perspective<00:01:25.369> so<00:01:26.369> it<00:01:26.460> takes

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
Jupiter just for perspective so it takes

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.730 
Jupiter just for perspective so it takes
a<00:01:26.790> few<00:01:27.090> seconds<00:01:27.570> to<00:01:27.750> fly<00:01:27.900> across<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.200> Jovian

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
a few seconds to fly across the Jovian

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.060 
a few seconds to fly across the Jovian
system<00:01:28.890> at<00:01:29.280> light<00:01:29.820> speed<00:01:30.409> yep<00:01:31.409> that's<00:01:31.860> it

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
system at light speed yep that's it

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.130 
system at light speed yep that's it
that's<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.670> biggest<00:01:32.909> planet<00:01:33.210> in<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.869> Solar

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
that's the biggest planet in the Solar

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.280 
that's the biggest planet in the Solar
System<00:01:34.280> all<00:01:35.280> light<00:01:35.520> speed<00:01:35.930> now<00:01:36.930> let's<00:01:37.110> take<00:01:37.259> a

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
System all light speed now let's take a

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.170 
System all light speed now let's take a
look<00:01:37.439> at<00:01:37.560> this<00:01:37.650> Sun<00:01:37.920> now<00:01:38.820> we're<00:01:39.000> currently

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
look at this Sun now we're currently

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.600 
look at this Sun now we're currently
about<00:01:39.570> one<00:01:39.869> light<00:01:40.140> hours<00:01:40.500> travel<00:01:40.950> away<00:01:41.400> from

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
about one light hours travel away from

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.219 
about one light hours travel away from
the<00:01:41.700> Sun<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:42.270> as<00:01:42.450> you<00:01:42.570> can<00:01:42.720> see<00:01:42.869> we've<00:01:43.020> flown

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
the Sun and as you can see we've flown

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.660 
the Sun and as you can see we've flown
down<00:01:43.439> into<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.799> plane<00:01:44.040> of<00:01:44.070> all<00:01:44.369> of<00:01:44.579> the

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
down into the plane of all of the

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.609 
down into the plane of all of the
planets<00:01:45.000> orbit<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.390> summit<00:01:45.869> now<00:01:46.290> let's<00:01:46.500> get

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
planets orbit the summit now let's get

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.469 
planets orbit the summit now let's get
up<00:01:46.740> to<00:01:46.860> about<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:47.280> hundred<00:01:47.369> times<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.119> speed<00:01:48.360> of

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
up to about a hundred times the speed of

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
oh that's one hot meatball hey but what

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.830 
oh that's one hot meatball hey but what
about<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.129> earth<00:02:08.220> let's<00:02:08.729> go<00:02:08.970> home<00:02:09.209> let's<00:02:09.450> do<00:02:09.810> a

oh<00:02:11.970> okay<00:02:12.840> we're<00:02:13.260> currently<00:02:13.470> about<00:02:13.770> ten<00:02:14.070> light

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
oh okay we're currently about ten light

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.100 
oh okay we're currently about ten light
minutes<00:02:14.670> away<00:02:14.790> from<00:02:14.880> Earth<00:02:15.180> but<00:02:15.510> we<00:02:15.870> can<00:02:15.960> cover

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
minutes away from Earth but we can cover

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.150 
minutes away from Earth but we can cover
that<00:02:16.200> quickly<00:02:16.740> enough

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
that quickly enough

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.100 
that quickly enough
now<00:02:17.520> just<00:02:17.790> for<00:02:17.910> perspective<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:18.660> distance

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
now just for perspective the distance

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.560 
now just for perspective the distance
the<00:02:19.350> moon<00:02:19.560> is<00:02:19.800> only<00:02:20.160> about<00:02:20.400> one<00:02:20.730> light-second

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.840 
the moon is only about one light-second
away<00:02:21.780> so<00:02:22.200> so<00:02:22.380> we<00:02:22.470> approach<00:02:22.830> earth<00:02:23.100> we<00:02:23.520> slow

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
away so so we approach earth we slow

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.660 
away so so we approach earth we slow
down<00:02:24.090> to<00:02:24.570> about<00:02:24.750> the<00:02:24.990> speed<00:02:25.260> of<00:02:25.290> light<00:02:25.670> boom
