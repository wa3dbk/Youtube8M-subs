Neil Young's greatest hits it's a really
great<00:00:21.510> book<00:00:21.750> I<00:00:21.900> recommend<00:00:22.320> it<00:00:22.410> but<00:00:24.619> one<00:00:25.619> of<00:00:25.710> the

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
great book I recommend it but one of the

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.960 
great book I recommend it but one of the
things<00:00:26.010> that<00:00:26.279> that<00:00:27.140> Neil<00:00:28.140> does<00:00:28.470> a<00:00:28.500> lot<00:00:28.970> from

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
things that that Neil does a lot from

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.209 
things that that Neil does a lot from
what<00:00:30.150> I<00:00:30.179> sing<00:00:30.539> is<00:00:30.779> of<00:00:31.289> course<00:00:31.500> he<00:00:31.619> uses<00:00:31.920> a<00:00:32.009> palm

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
what I sing is of course he uses a palm

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:38.660 
what I sing is of course he uses a palm
mute<00:00:35.870> but<00:00:36.870> I<00:00:36.899> think<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.860> most<00:00:38.070> distinct<00:00:38.520> thing

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
mute but I think the most distinct thing

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.350 
mute but I think the most distinct thing
he<00:00:38.820> does<00:00:39.030> is<00:00:39.059> he<00:00:39.510> does<00:00:40.170> a<00:00:40.200> violent<00:00:41.360> violent

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
he does is he does a violent violent

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.270 
he does is he does a violent violent
upstroke<00:00:43.140> after<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.739> downstroke<00:00:46.100> which<00:00:47.100> is

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
upstroke after the downstroke which is

00:00:47.280 --> 00:01:06.990 
upstroke after the downstroke which is
kind<00:00:47.520> of<00:00:47.550> like<00:00:47.670> this

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:25.570 

so<00:01:08.000> that's<00:01:08.210> what<00:01:23.350> and<00:01:24.350> so<00:01:24.560> that<00:01:24.770> that's<00:01:25.369> the

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580
