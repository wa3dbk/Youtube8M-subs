00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:19.269
 next guys good this is a map is 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:22.300
 a map of command blocks created by 

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:23.980
 the very network in gamer he is the 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.779
 creator and good guys, well, if we give him 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.519
 click here as you realize then 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:29.349
 we go down to what has been all 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:31.390
 these commands words are very many 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:33.360
 many blocks of command and good 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.649

 no motorcycles no guys and well we're going to 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.350
 start testing it first thing 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.070
 you need to do logically is to put yourself 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.180
 the 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:48.280
 in your rival not because the server or the 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.469
 map puts you in what is interactive 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:54.250
 then you put in your rival you give 

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:56.469
 click and these that you see here are come 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.390

 then we basically do this 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.300
 who is coming here and says he says touch me 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.730
 please 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.530
 do not break blocks inside the red area 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:47.050
 what would it be like, we can not 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.460
 break what he pulls but almost everyone like that 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.130
 how good are we going to see and see how 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:55.510
 activated fund you realize I'm going to die or 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:57.400
 I am immediately dying or has been 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.979
 That's how fast we fell the trap of 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.080
 the children blocks and good fire 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:03.310
 wait for love and we do not wait no longer 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.649
 there is another 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.509
 I do not have another one ok, I'm already dying 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:08.970
 destroying and destroying another one 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:11.800
 another plus another plus and good and die 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.750
 after this this is basically the 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.330
 lucky blogs as I am telling you 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.489
 well simply these blocks of 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.230
 gold are immediately transformed into 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:23.260
 blogs or we put it achieved 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.700
 break and now it comes out in others but you 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.319
 you say hear but I want to see how it 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.330
 it's blogging and I do not want to be 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:29.920
 far from being in a 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.959
 open world and put them blogs and 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.880
 break them do not you do not want that what you 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:36.730
 you want is to have the maps done and 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:39.790
 well I think it's that ans to the egg 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:42.040
 then also this map this map will 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.930
 bring her a career be a map 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.490
 manufactured for look careers and blogs 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:50.180
 and good says here 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:52.670
 that is a crater for an explosion says 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.850
 Hey, boy, what do you see here? 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:58.220

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.620
 be you come in pisagua what blogs and 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:03.140
 suddenly rob and gypsies are 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.150
 when with your friends and this is a 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:08.860
 exponent of diamond and eggs 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.860
 games and diamonds seriously 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:18.260
 and so and I think here 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:22.430
 I do not know what happens but good is something else

 but you have to break the 108 as well 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:39.650
 it's how you're seeing you'll have to go 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:44.810
 going one by one 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:46.880
 basically from cook I would have to put 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:52.370
