blinking<00:02:54.019> like<00:02:54.200> that<00:02:54.440> but<00:02:55.280> because<00:02:55.730> we<00:02:55.879> have

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
blinking like that but because we have

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:01.589 
blinking like that but because we have
the<00:02:57.670> Tektronix<00:02:58.670> CM<00:02:58.970> dat<00:02:59.299> we<00:02:59.840> can<00:03:00.109> actually

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:01.599 
the Tektronix CM dat we can actually

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:06.009 
the Tektronix CM dat we can actually
show<00:03:02.599> the<00:03:03.049> phone<00:03:03.290> actually<00:03:03.680> function<00:03:04.069> so<00:03:05.019> what

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
show the phone actually function so what

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.740 
show the phone actually function so what
I'm<00:03:06.139> going<00:03:06.319> to<00:03:06.349> do<00:03:06.470> now<00:03:06.680> is<00:03:07.450> go<00:03:08.450> ahead<00:03:08.480> and

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
I'm going to do now is go ahead and

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:15.879 
I'm going to do now is go ahead and
select<00:03:09.730> the<00:03:10.730> manual<00:03:11.329> test<00:03:11.720> mode<00:03:12.340> and<00:03:14.739> now<00:03:15.739> if

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:15.889 
select the manual test mode and now if

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:23.039 
select the manual test mode and now if
we<00:03:16.010> look<00:03:16.129> at<00:03:16.310> the<00:03:16.430> phone<00:03:18.730> we<00:03:19.730> should<00:03:20.120> see<00:03:20.569> the

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
we look at the phone we should see the

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:26.409 
we look at the phone we should see the
roam<00:03:24.049> light<00:03:24.290> come<00:03:24.590> on<00:03:24.620> what<00:03:25.400> you<00:03:25.579> just<00:03:25.819> did<00:03:26.090> so

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:26.419 
roam light come on what you just did so

00:03:26.419 --> 00:03:28.479 
roam light come on what you just did so
you<00:03:26.510> can<00:03:26.660> see<00:03:26.870> on<00:03:27.230> the<00:03:27.590> right<00:03:27.769> hand<00:03:27.889> side<00:03:28.190> there

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
you can see on the right hand side there

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:31.809 
you can see on the right hand side there
so<00:03:29.239> the<00:03:29.690> cell<00:03:30.049> phone<00:03:30.319> now<00:03:31.190> thinks<00:03:31.639> it's

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:31.819 
so the cell phone now thinks it's

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:38.879 
so the cell phone now thinks it's
talking<00:03:32.120> to<00:03:32.510> a<00:03:33.579> cell<00:03:34.579> tower<00:03:36.340> which<00:03:37.340> the

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:38.889 
talking to a cell tower which the

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:44.050 
talking to a cell tower which the
Tektronix<00:03:39.889> CM<00:03:40.790> dat<00:03:41.180> is<00:03:41.510> emulating<00:03:42.430> so<00:03:43.430> there's

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
Tektronix CM dat is emulating so there's

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.409 
Tektronix CM dat is emulating so there's
some<00:03:44.299> cool<00:03:44.479> things<00:03:44.540> we<00:03:44.900> can<00:03:45.109> do<00:03:45.290> with<00:03:45.799> the<00:03:46.419> test

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:47.419 
some cool things we can do with the test

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:49.930 
some cool things we can do with the test
monitor<00:03:47.959> now<00:03:48.139> let<00:03:49.069> me<00:03:49.190> move<00:03:49.340> the<00:03:49.489> phone<00:03:49.669> over

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
monitor now let me move the phone over

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:54.159 
monitor now let me move the phone over
to<00:03:50.120> the<00:03:50.180> side<00:03:50.419> a<00:03:50.449> little<00:03:50.569> bit<00:03:50.829> and<00:03:53.139> we<00:03:54.139> can

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:54.169 
to the side a little bit and we can

00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:56.490 
to the side a little bit and we can
actually<00:03:54.919> place<00:03:55.310> a<00:03:55.340> call<00:03:55.729> to<00:03:56.000> the<00:03:56.030> phone

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
actually place a call to the phone

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.050 
actually place a call to the phone
there's<00:03:57.500> a<00:03:57.590> couple<00:03:57.799> options<00:03:58.069> for<00:03:58.400> that<00:03:58.729> so<00:03:58.970> I'm

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
there's a couple options for that so I'm

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:04.170 
there's a couple options for that so I'm
going<00:03:59.180> to<00:03:59.269> choose<00:03:59.629> the<00:04:00.220> bottom<00:04:01.220> most<00:04:01.370> one<00:04:01.729> and

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
going to choose the bottom most one and

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.839 
going to choose the bottom most one and
so<00:04:05.180> that<00:04:05.569> should<00:04:05.810> be<00:04:06.190> ringing<00:04:07.190> the<00:04:07.310> phone<00:04:07.639> you

00:04:07.839 --> 00:04:07.849 
so that should be ringing the phone you

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:11.949 
so that should be ringing the phone you
can<00:04:08.000> hear<00:04:08.180> it<00:04:08.269> ring<00:04:08.449> and<00:04:10.449> so<00:04:11.449> we'll<00:04:11.840> go<00:04:11.930> ahead

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 
can hear it ring and so we'll go ahead

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:15.250 
can hear it ring and so we'll go ahead
and<00:04:12.199> answer<00:04:12.319> that<00:04:13.510> so<00:04:14.510> to<00:04:14.569> do<00:04:14.720> that<00:04:14.750> by<00:04:15.019> pushing

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
and answer that so to do that by pushing

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.509 
and answer that so to do that by pushing
the<00:04:15.560> red<00:04:15.949> send<00:04:16.430> button<00:04:16.729> and<00:04:17.979> you<00:04:18.979> can<00:04:19.099> see<00:04:19.310> now

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 
the red send button and you can see now

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:22.500 
the red send button and you can see now
that<00:04:19.549> the

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.560 
placed to the phone were at 834 point 36
megahertz<00:04:36.340> we<00:04:37.340> go<00:04:37.520> back<00:04:37.820> at<00:04:38.000> the<00:04:38.120> phone<00:04:38.330> you

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
megahertz we go back at the phone you

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:43.500 
megahertz we go back at the phone you
can<00:04:38.720> see<00:04:38.750> now<00:04:39.380> that<00:04:39.410> we<00:04:39.860> have<00:04:40.389> the<00:04:41.950> green

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:43.510 
can see now that we have the green

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:47.530 
can see now that we have the green
indicator<00:04:44.510> on<00:04:44.840> the<00:04:45.200> left<00:04:45.500> is<00:04:45.740> flashing<00:04:46.130> in<00:04:46.639> use

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:47.540 
indicator on the left is flashing in use

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:52.750 
indicator on the left is flashing in use
and<00:04:48.910> also<00:04:49.910> what<00:04:50.360> I<00:04:50.389> have<00:04:50.630> is<00:04:51.320> up<00:04:52.040> here<00:04:52.340> is<00:04:52.520> a

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:52.760 
and also what I have is up here is a

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.390 
and also what I have is up here is a
frequency<00:04:53.330> counter<00:04:53.840> and<00:04:54.080> we<00:04:54.200> can<00:04:54.380> see<00:04:54.620> that<00:04:54.919> it

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
frequency counter and we can see that it

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:00.700 
frequency counter and we can see that it
is<00:04:55.430> picking<00:04:55.880> up<00:04:56.120> the<00:04:57.760> 834<00:04:58.760> megahertz<00:04:59.710> carrier

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
is picking up the 834 megahertz carrier

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:04.600 
is picking up the 834 megahertz carrier
signal<00:05:01.100> and<00:05:01.330> also<00:05:03.100> over<00:05:04.100> here<00:05:04.130> on<00:05:04.490> the

right-hand side the signal from the from
the<00:05:22.430> phone<00:05:23.229> so<00:05:24.229> let's<00:05:24.350> go<00:05:24.530> back<00:05:24.770> to<00:05:25.729> the<00:05:26.000> phone

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 
the phone so let's go back to the phone

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:32.770 
the phone so let's go back to the phone
and<00:05:27.850> one<00:05:28.850> of<00:05:29.000> the<00:05:29.860> tests<00:05:30.860> that<00:05:30.890> the<00:05:31.780> service

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:32.780 
and one of the tests that the service

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:34.990 
and one of the tests that the service
planner<00:05:32.990> will<00:05:33.229> let<00:05:33.410> us<00:05:33.500> do<00:05:33.740> is<00:05:34.010> a<00:05:34.039> we<00:05:34.970> can

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.000 
planner will let us do is a we can

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.990 
planner will let us do is a we can
actually<00:05:35.240> send<00:05:35.539> some<00:05:36.070> audio<00:05:37.070> to<00:05:37.310> the<00:05:37.340> phone<00:05:37.610> so

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.000 
actually send some audio to the phone so

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.990 
actually send some audio to the phone so
let's<00:05:38.270> go<00:05:38.479> ahead<00:05:38.690> and<00:05:38.840> do<00:05:39.110> that<00:05:39.490> I'll<00:05:40.490> push<00:05:40.760> the

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.000 
let's go ahead and do that I'll push the

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.050 
let's go ahead and do that I'll push the
receiver<00:05:41.360> test<00:05:41.690> and<00:05:41.990> then<00:05:42.950> audio<00:05:43.400> frequency

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:44.060 
receiver test and then audio frequency

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:46.900
