what<00:02:28.980> I<00:02:29.040> want<00:02:29.160> to<00:02:29.280> do<00:02:29.430> is<00:02:29.460> I<00:02:29.640> want<00:02:29.670> to<00:02:29.850> listen<00:02:30.000> to

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
what I want to do is I want to listen to

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.860 
what I want to do is I want to listen to
it<00:02:30.270> back<00:02:31.250> so<00:02:32.250> if<00:02:32.340> i<00:02:32.430> plug<00:02:32.640> it<00:02:32.790> into<00:02:32.970> a<00:02:33.120> USB<00:02:33.420> cable

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
it back so if i plug it into a USB cable

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.780 
it back so if i plug it into a USB cable
linked<00:02:34.320> up<00:02:34.440> to<00:02:34.470> my<00:02:34.680> laptop<00:02:34.890> computer<00:02:35.730> whatever

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
linked up to my laptop computer whatever

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.050 
linked up to my laptop computer whatever
then<00:02:38.790> we<00:02:38.850> should<00:02:39.060> find<00:02:39.710> that<00:02:40.710> I'll

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
then we should find that I'll

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:47.870 
then we should find that I'll
instantaneously<00:02:42.060> load<00:02:42.660> up<00:02:46.610> and<00:02:47.610> have<00:02:47.730> a<00:02:47.760> look

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
instantaneously load up and have a look

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:55.510 
instantaneously load up and have a look
at<00:02:48.090> the<00:02:48.180> laptop<00:02:50.690> we<00:02:51.690> want<00:02:51.840> to<00:02:51.960> open<00:02:51.990> the<00:02:52.290> folder

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:15.970 

there<00:02:56.520> we<00:02:56.610> see<00:02:56.760> our<00:02:56.880> recordings<00:02:57.330> there

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.470 

it<00:03:16.980> really<00:03:17.160> is<00:03:17.280> a<00:03:17.370> simple<00:03:17.700> examiner's<00:03:18.150> that's

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
it really is a simple examiner's that's

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.180 
it really is a simple examiner's that's
