okay<00:00:01.680> welcome<00:00:01.979> to<00:00:02.399> today's<00:00:02.760> video<00:00:02.970> everyone

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
okay welcome to today's video everyone

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:05.960 
okay welcome to today's video everyone
so<00:00:04.080> today<00:00:04.319> this<00:00:04.620> video<00:00:04.920> will<00:00:05.130> be<00:00:05.160> an

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
so today this video will be an

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.709 
so today this video will be an
introduction<00:00:06.450> to<00:00:07.130> complex<00:00:08.130> numbers<00:00:08.280> so<00:00:08.790> most

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
introduction to complex numbers so most

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.780 
introduction to complex numbers so most
schools<00:00:10.230> usually<00:00:10.469> do<00:00:10.769> complex<00:00:11.219> on<00:00:11.429> this<00:00:11.550> as

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
schools usually do complex on this as

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.310 
schools usually do complex on this as
first<00:00:12.750> topic<00:00:13.110> in<00:00:13.290> their<00:00:13.799> extension<00:00:14.580> to<00:00:14.700> maths

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:15.320 
first topic in their extension to maths

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.859 
first topic in their extension to maths
so<00:00:16.580> we're<00:00:17.580> going<00:00:17.760> through<00:00:17.940> Columbus<00:00:18.600> in<00:00:18.750> this

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
so we're going through Columbus in this

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.250 
so we're going through Columbus in this
series<00:00:19.230> so<00:00:20.220> let's<00:00:20.609> have<00:00:20.699> a<00:00:20.840> have<00:00:21.840> a<00:00:21.869> look<00:00:22.080> at<00:00:22.199> a

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
series so let's have a have a look at a

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.460 
series so let's have a have a look at a
bit<00:00:22.380> of<00:00:22.470> a<00:00:22.590> history<00:00:23.580> of<00:00:23.609> numbers<00:00:24.109> so<00:00:25.109> we

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
bit of a history of numbers so we

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.200 
bit of a history of numbers so we
originally<00:00:25.800> started<00:00:26.189> off<00:00:26.340> with<00:00:26.519> natural

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
originally started off with natural

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.310 
originally started off with natural
numbers<00:00:28.070> okay<00:00:29.070> so<00:00:29.099> a<00:00:29.279> natural<00:00:29.460> number

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
numbers okay so a natural number

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.319 
numbers okay so a natural number
some<00:00:31.949> people<00:00:32.219> include<00:00:32.550> zero<00:00:32.820> as<00:00:33.000> a<00:00:33.030> natural

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
some people include zero as a natural

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.810 
some people include zero as a natural
number<00:00:33.570> some<00:00:33.780> don't<00:00:34.309> just<00:00:35.309> include<00:00:35.460> it<00:00:35.700> for

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
number some don't just include it for

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.420 
number some don't just include it for
the<00:00:36.120> sake<00:00:36.300> of<00:00:36.480> simplicity<00:00:36.750> in<00:00:37.200> this<00:00:37.320> video<00:00:37.559> so

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
the sake of simplicity in this video so

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.080 
the sake of simplicity in this video so
natural<00:00:39.210> numbers<00:00:39.559> were<00:00:40.559> originally<00:00:40.980> used<00:00:41.700> for

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
natural numbers were originally used for

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.930 
natural numbers were originally used for
things<00:00:42.450> such<00:00:42.690> as<00:00:43.050> counting<00:00:43.500> so<00:00:43.800> for<00:00:44.550> example

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
things such as counting so for example

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.459 
things such as counting so for example
counting<00:00:45.300> how<00:00:45.510> many<00:00:45.660> apples<00:00:46.020> we<00:00:46.140> have<00:00:46.289> in<00:00:46.410> a

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
counting how many apples we have in a

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.660 
counting how many apples we have in a
basket<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.219> so<00:00:48.090> we<00:00:48.870> can<00:00:49.020> have<00:00:49.200> zero<00:00:50.100> apples<00:00:50.460> so

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
basket and so we can have zero apples so

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.540 
basket and so we can have zero apples so
that's<00:00:50.930> zero<00:00:51.930> there<00:00:52.170> we<00:00:52.860> could<00:00:53.010> have<00:00:53.039> one<00:00:53.309> two

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
that's zero there we could have one two

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.729 
that's zero there we could have one two
three<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:54.059> we<00:00:54.149> can<00:00:54.270> only<00:00:54.390> have<00:00:54.739> integer

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
three and we can only have integer

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.599 
three and we can only have integer
values<00:00:56.129> or<00:00:56.430> fixed<00:00:57.030> values<00:00:57.449> of<00:00:57.660> numbers<00:00:58.489> so<00:00:59.489> we

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
values or fixed values of numbers so we

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.910 
values or fixed values of numbers so we
wouldn't<00:01:00.510> have<00:01:00.660> half<00:01:00.930> an<00:01:01.050> apple<00:01:01.199> so<00:01:01.770> they

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
wouldn't have half an apple so they

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.759 
wouldn't have half an apple so they
didn't<00:01:02.190> think<00:01:02.370> about<00:01:02.579> that<00:01:03.559> then<00:01:04.559> they

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
didn't think about that then they

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.750 
didn't think about that then they
introduced<00:01:05.670> water<00:01:06.270> known<00:01:06.450> as<00:01:06.479> integers<00:01:07.760> so

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
introduced water known as integers so

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.609 
introduced water known as integers so
integers<00:01:09.330> are<00:01:09.540> all<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.049> natural<00:01:10.350> numbers

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
integers are all the natural numbers

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.590 
integers are all the natural numbers
with<00:01:11.010> their<00:01:11.130> negative<00:01:11.549> values<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:12.240> this<00:01:12.479> is

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
with their negative values and this is

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.660 
with their negative values and this is
also<00:01:12.750> used<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.140> accounting<00:01:13.560> so<00:01:14.250> for<00:01:14.340> example

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
also used to accounting so for example

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.550 
also used to accounting so for example
if<00:01:14.729> I<00:01:14.790> had<00:01:14.970> five<00:01:15.270> apples<00:01:15.630> in<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:15.840> basket<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.409> I

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
if I had five apples in a basket and I

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.249 
if I had five apples in a basket and I
took<00:01:16.619> away<00:01:17.009> two<00:01:17.040> apples<00:01:17.700> so<00:01:18.689> that's<00:01:18.869> that's

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
took away two apples so that's that's

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.440 
took away two apples so that's that's
where<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.710> need<00:01:19.860> for<00:01:19.890> a<00:01:20.159> negative<00:01:20.520> two<00:01:21.150> years

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
where the need for a negative two years

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.609 
where the need for a negative two years
so<00:01:21.900> negative<00:01:22.320> values<00:01:22.850> were<00:01:23.850> also<00:01:24.619> deemed

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
so negative values were also deemed

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.429 
so negative values were also deemed
important<00:01:26.360> then<00:01:27.360> mathematicians<00:01:28.020> asked

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
important then mathematicians asked

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.700 
important then mathematicians asked
themselves<00:01:28.799> this<00:01:29.189> question<00:01:30.259> how<00:01:31.259> do<00:01:31.320> we<00:01:31.470> solve

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
themselves this question how do we solve

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.270 
themselves this question how do we solve
equations<00:01:31.860> of<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.579> form<00:01:32.780> Q<00:01:33.780> X<00:01:34.020> minus<00:01:34.530> P<00:01:34.799> equals

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
equations of the form Q X minus P equals

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.130 
equations of the form Q X minus P equals
zero<00:01:35.460> for<00:01:35.729> some<00:01:36.630> integers<00:01:37.200> P<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:37.770> Q<00:01:38.960> okay<00:01:39.960> and

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
zero for some integers P and Q okay and

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.719 
zero for some integers P and Q okay and
the<00:01:40.229> way<00:01:40.320> that<00:01:40.500> they<00:01:40.590> do<00:01:40.799> this<00:01:40.920> is<00:01:41.130> by

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
the way that they do this is by

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.030 
the way that they do this is by
inventing<00:01:42.240> what<00:01:42.990> are<00:01:43.079> known<00:01:43.200> as<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.470> rational

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
inventing what are known as the rational

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.139 
inventing what are known as the rational
numbers<00:01:44.869> so<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:45.990> rational<00:01:46.350> numbers<00:01:47.000> now<00:01:48.000> in

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
numbers so the rational numbers now in

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.190 
numbers so the rational numbers now in
set<00:01:48.360> notation<00:01:48.479> this<00:01:48.930> is<00:01:48.990> how<00:01:49.200> you<00:01:49.259> read<00:01:49.500> this

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
set notation this is how you read this

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.310 
set notation this is how you read this
it<00:01:52.200> is<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.470> set<00:01:52.680> of<00:01:53.210> numbers<00:01:54.210> P<00:01:54.689> in<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.079> form

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
it is the set of numbers P in the form

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.580 
it is the set of numbers P in the form
of<00:01:55.380> P<00:01:55.649> over<00:01:55.680> Q<00:01:56.479> such<00:01:57.479> that<00:01:57.509> so<00:01:58.049> this<00:01:58.140> vertical

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
of P over Q such that so this vertical

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.399 
of P over Q such that so this vertical
line<00:01:58.619> means<00:01:58.950> such<00:01:59.310> that<00:01:59.750> so<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.960> set<00:02:01.320> of

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
line means such that so the set of

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.219 
line means such that so the set of
numbers<00:02:01.560> P<00:02:02.159> over<00:02:02.369> Q<00:02:02.399> such<00:02:02.939> that<00:02:02.969> P<00:02:03.570> and<00:02:03.750> Q<00:02:04.020> are

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
numbers P over Q such that P and Q are

be expressed as a ratio of two integers

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.760 
be expressed as a ratio of two integers
and<00:02:16.440> this<00:02:17.190> fact<00:02:17.490> is<00:02:17.730> important<00:02:18.630> improving<00:02:18.990> the

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
and this fact is important improving the

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.340 
and this fact is important improving the
irrationality<00:02:20.460> of<00:02:20.490> numbers<00:02:21.360> so<00:02:21.720> if<00:02:21.900> we<00:02:22.020> wanted

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
irrationality of numbers so if we wanted

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.050 
irrationality of numbers so if we wanted
to<00:02:22.440> prove<00:02:22.770> the<00:02:22.920> irrationality<00:02:23.460> of<00:02:23.490> a<00:02:23.820> for

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
to prove the irrationality of a for

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.940 
to prove the irrationality of a for
example<00:02:24.410> we<00:02:25.410> would<00:02:25.500> have<00:02:25.560> to<00:02:25.800> use<00:02:25.920> this<00:02:26.100> fact

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
example we would have to use this fact

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:34.430 
example we would have to use this fact
okay<00:02:31.940> so<00:02:32.940> now<00:02:33.600> that<00:02:33.660> we<00:02:33.840> have<00:02:33.870> those<00:02:34.200> three

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
okay so now that we have those three

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.990 
okay so now that we have those three
mathematicians<00:02:35.280> asked<00:02:35.460> themselves<00:02:35.640> this

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
mathematicians asked themselves this

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.390 
mathematicians asked themselves this
question<00:02:36.450> how<00:02:37.290> do<00:02:37.350> we<00:02:37.410> solve<00:02:37.710> equations<00:02:37.830> of

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
question how do we solve equations of

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.470 
question how do we solve equations of
the<00:02:38.520> form<00:02:39.350> x<00:02:40.350> squared<00:02:40.530> equals<00:02:41.190> b<00:02:41.370> for<00:02:42.030> positive

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
the form x squared equals b for positive

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.640 
the form x squared equals b for positive
rational<00:02:43.260> B<00:02:43.410> M<00:02:44.390> B<00:02:45.390> is<00:02:45.600> also<00:02:45.930> not<00:02:46.140> a<00:02:46.170> perfect

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
rational B M B is also not a perfect

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.820 
rational B M B is also not a perfect
square<00:02:47.390> so<00:02:48.390> if<00:02:48.540> B<00:02:48.720> was<00:02:48.960> a<00:02:48.990> perfect<00:02:49.470> square<00:02:49.620> and

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
square so if B was a perfect square and

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.130 
square so if B was a perfect square and
we<00:02:50.040> had<00:02:50.220> for<00:02:50.550> example<00:02:50.580> x<00:02:51.180> squared<00:02:51.570> equals<00:02:51.870> 4

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
we had for example x squared equals 4

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.830 
we had for example x squared equals 4
then<00:02:53.070> we<00:02:53.220> already<00:02:53.730> have<00:02:54.090> solutions<00:02:54.540> to<00:02:54.630> that

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
then we already have solutions to that

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.080 
then we already have solutions to that
in<00:02:54.990> the<00:02:55.110> fields<00:02:55.440> or<00:02:55.650> the<00:02:56.400> sets<00:02:56.640> of<00:02:56.790> numbers

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
in the fields or the sets of numbers

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.540 
in the fields or the sets of numbers
that<00:02:57.180> we<00:02:57.300> already<00:02:57.480> have<00:02:57.660> so<00:02:58.380> x<00:02:58.680> equals<00:02:59.040> 2<00:02:59.250> and<00:02:59.400> x

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
that we already have so x equals 2 and x

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.220 
that we already have so x equals 2 and x
equals<00:02:59.850> -2<00:03:00.150> it<00:03:00.300> would<00:03:00.420> be<00:03:00.540> solutions<00:03:00.960> to<00:03:01.110> that

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
equals -2 it would be solutions to that

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.850 
equals -2 it would be solutions to that
but<00:03:01.740> what<00:03:01.860> if<00:03:01.950> a<00:03:02.010> B<00:03:02.160> was<00:03:02.370> not<00:03:02.580> a<00:03:02.610> perfect<00:03:02.880> square

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
but what if a B was not a perfect square

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.740 
but what if a B was not a perfect square
well<00:03:04.860> then<00:03:05.150> mathematicians<00:03:06.150> invented<00:03:06.600> what

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
well then mathematicians invented what

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.980 
well then mathematicians invented what
are<00:03:06.870> known<00:03:06.960> as<00:03:07.020> the<00:03:07.740> irrational<00:03:08.010> numbers<00:03:08.990> so

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:09.990 
are known as the irrational numbers so

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:12.080 
are known as the irrational numbers so
all<00:03:10.410> numbers<00:03:10.890> which<00:03:11.100> are<00:03:11.220> not<00:03:11.400> rational<00:03:11.670> are

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
all numbers which are not rational are

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.890 
all numbers which are not rational are
irrational<00:03:12.780> numbers<00:03:13.110> and<00:03:13.380> there's<00:03:14.220> no<00:03:14.900> symbol

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
irrational numbers and there's no symbol

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.570 
irrational numbers and there's no symbol
for<00:03:16.020> this<00:03:16.170> sort<00:03:16.470> of<00:03:16.530> sometimes<00:03:16.950> we<00:03:17.130> see<00:03:17.370> a

of 18 and in fact there's infinitely
many<00:03:40.770> irrational<00:03:41.700> numbers<00:03:43.130> okay<00:03:44.130> then

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
many irrational numbers okay then

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.490 
many irrational numbers okay then
mathematicians<00:03:45.480> ask<00:03:45.810> themselves<00:03:46.200> another

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
mathematicians ask themselves another

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.550 
mathematicians ask themselves another
question<00:03:47.300> how<00:03:48.300> do<00:03:48.360> we<00:03:48.450> solve<00:03:48.810> equations<00:03:48.989> of

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
question how do we solve equations of

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.300 
question how do we solve equations of
the<00:03:49.680> form<00:03:49.709> x<00:03:50.220> squared<00:03:50.989> equals<00:03:51.989> B<00:03:52.019> for<00:03:52.830> negative

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
the form x squared equals B for negative

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.479 
the form x squared equals B for negative
values<00:03:53.340> of<00:03:53.700> B<00:03:54.000> so<00:03:54.810> here<00:03:55.050> we<00:03:55.200> had<00:03:55.590> positive<00:03:56.250> B

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
values of B so here we had positive B

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:00.410 
values of B so here we had positive B
but<00:03:57.420> now<00:03:57.600> we<00:03:57.660> want<00:03:57.930> negative<00:03:58.410> B<00:03:58.830> and<00:03:59.180> so<00:04:00.180> they

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
but now we want negative B and so they

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.210 
but now we want negative B and so they
invented<00:04:00.900> what<00:04:01.410> are<00:04:01.500> known<00:04:01.590> as<00:04:01.860> complex

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
invented what are known as complex

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.360 
invented what are known as complex
numbers<00:04:03.080> and<00:04:04.080> so<00:04:04.260> complex<00:04:04.530> numbers<00:04:05.130> are

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
numbers and so complex numbers are

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:11.660 
numbers and so complex numbers are
numbers<00:04:06.180> of<00:04:06.269> the<00:04:06.390> form<00:04:07.519> X<00:04:08.519> plus<00:04:08.940> iy<00:04:10.400> such<00:04:11.400> that

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
numbers of the form X plus iy such that

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.320 
numbers of the form X plus iy such that
x<00:04:12.000> and<00:04:12.330> y<00:04:12.480> are<00:04:12.510> real<00:04:12.870> numbers<00:04:13.260> and<00:04:14.010> we<00:04:14.730> defined

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
x and y are real numbers and we defined

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.710 
x and y are real numbers and we defined
I<00:04:15.660> to<00:04:16.019> be<00:04:16.169> the<00:04:16.200> square<00:04:16.650> root<00:04:16.769> of<00:04:17.130> -1<00:04:17.580> and<00:04:18.570> we'll

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
I to be the square root of -1 and we'll

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.690 
I to be the square root of -1 and we'll
see<00:04:18.930> how<00:04:19.109> we<00:04:19.169> use<00:04:19.440> this<00:04:19.940> in<00:04:20.940> a<00:04:21.060> later<00:04:21.180> video<00:04:22.700> now

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
see how we use this in a later video now

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.830 
see how we use this in a later video now
it's<00:04:24.060> important<00:04:24.600> to<00:04:24.660> note<00:04:24.930> that

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
it's important to note that

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.870 
it's important to note that
all<00:04:27.840> these<00:04:28.080> numbers<00:04:28.560> all<00:04:29.160> numbers<00:04:29.730> are

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
all these numbers all numbers are

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.880 
all these numbers all numbers are
complex<00:04:30.270> numbers<00:04:30.870> so<00:04:31.140> we<00:04:31.260> have<00:04:31.470> that<00:04:31.710> the

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:31.890 
complex numbers so we have that the

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:34.700 
complex numbers so we have that the
natural<00:04:32.280> numbers<00:04:32.640> are<00:04:32.880> a<00:04:33.510> subset<00:04:33.630> so<00:04:34.530> this

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
natural numbers are a subset so this

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.190 
natural numbers are a subset so this
symbol<00:04:34.920> here<00:04:35.190> means<00:04:35.220> subset<00:04:35.940> so<00:04:36.750> natural

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.200 
symbol here means subset so natural

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:41.270 
symbol here means subset so natural
numbers<00:04:37.470> are<00:04:37.620> a<00:04:37.680> subset<00:04:37.770> of<00:04:38.340> the<00:04:39.200> integers<00:04:40.280> the

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
numbers are a subset of the integers the

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.610 
numbers are a subset of the integers the
integers<00:04:41.700> are<00:04:41.850> a<00:04:41.880> subset<00:04:42.330> of<00:04:42.390> the<00:04:42.840> rationals

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
integers are a subset of the rationals

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.830 
integers are a subset of the rationals
the<00:04:44.280> rationals<00:04:44.700> are<00:04:44.820> a<00:04:44.880> subset<00:04:45.300> of<00:04:45.360> the<00:04:45.600> reals

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
the rationals are a subset of the reals

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.700 
the rationals are a subset of the reals
and<00:04:46.280> all<00:04:47.280> real<00:04:47.640> numbers<00:04:48.000> are<00:04:48.180> a<00:04:48.210> subset<00:04:48.300> of<00:04:48.840> the

and all real numbers are a subset of the
complex<00:04:50.190> numbers<00:04:51.050> so<00:04:52.050> the<00:04:52.890> complex<00:04:53.340> numbers

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:53.730 
complex numbers so the complex numbers

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:55.580 
complex numbers so the complex numbers
another<00:04:54.090> important<00:04:54.570> fact<00:04:54.870> about<00:04:54.990> complex

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
another important fact about complex

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.610 
another important fact about complex
numbers<00:04:55.890> is<00:04:56.310> that<00:04:56.550> they<00:04:56.700> are<00:04:56.820> not<00:04:57.030> ordered

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620 
numbers is that they are not ordered

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.010 
numbers is that they are not ordered
it's<00:04:58.620> not<00:04:58.890> possible<00:04:59.490> for<00:04:59.700> us<00:04:59.790> to<00:05:00.060> define<00:05:00.960> a

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
it's not possible for us to define a

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:05.300 
it's not possible for us to define a
relationship<00:05:01.530> of<00:05:01.980> the<00:05:02.580> z1<00:05:03.000> less<00:05:03.840> than<00:05:04.050> z2<00:05:04.560> for

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
relationship of the z1 less than z2 for

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.880 
relationship of the z1 less than z2 for
two<00:05:05.460> complex<00:05:05.940> numbers<00:05:06.030> z1<00:05:06.480> and<00:05:06.780> z2<00:05:06.810> so<00:05:07.770> we

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:07.890 
two complex numbers z1 and z2 so we

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:11.450 
two complex numbers z1 and z2 so we
can't<00:05:08.160> find<00:05:08.570> we<00:05:09.570> can't<00:05:09.840> write<00:05:10.710> complex

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 
can't find we can't write complex

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.030 
can't find we can't write complex
numbers<00:05:11.820> in<00:05:12.000> a<00:05:12.120> in<00:05:12.720> an<00:05:12.900> increasing<00:05:13.530> order<00:05:13.710> for

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:14.040 
numbers in a in an increasing order for

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.450 
numbers in a in an increasing order for
example<00:05:14.460> and<00:05:15.080> the<00:05:16.080> reason<00:05:16.410> of<00:05:16.530> for<00:05:17.190> this<00:05:17.280> is

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 
example and the reason of for this is

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:18.650 
example and the reason of for this is
because<00:05:17.610> complex<00:05:18.210> numbers<00:05:18.510> are

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:18.660 
because complex numbers are

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.720 
because complex numbers are
two-dimensional<00:05:19.130> so<00:05:20.130> if<00:05:20.190> you<00:05:20.310> have<00:05:20.490> a<00:05:20.520> look

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:20.730 
two-dimensional so if you have a look

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:24.080 
two-dimensional so if you have a look
back<00:05:21.000> it<00:05:21.620> over<00:05:22.620> here<00:05:22.950> we<00:05:23.430> see<00:05:23.580> that<00:05:23.730> complex

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.090 
back it over here we see that complex

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:27.290 
back it over here we see that complex
numbers<00:05:24.480> are<00:05:24.600> X<00:05:24.810> plus<00:05:25.140> iy<00:05:25.440> so<00:05:26.370> they<00:05:26.490> have<00:05:26.670> two

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.300 
numbers are X plus iy so they have two

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:28.940 
numbers are X plus iy so they have two
dimensions<00:05:27.870> there's<00:05:28.170> two<00:05:28.440> pieces<00:05:28.680> of

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:28.950 
dimensions there's two pieces of

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:31.250 
dimensions there's two pieces of
information<00:05:29.160> we<00:05:29.520> need<00:05:29.730> to<00:05:29.940> have<00:05:30.900> a<00:05:30.930> complex

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:31.260 
information we need to have a complex

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.320 
information we need to have a complex
number<00:05:31.410> so<00:05:31.890> you<00:05:31.950> might<00:05:32.100> ask<00:05:32.280> yourself<00:05:32.430> what

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:33.330 
number so you might ask yourself what

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.630 
number so you might ask yourself what
about<00:05:33.570> looking<00:05:34.380> at<00:05:34.560> just<00:05:34.800> the<00:05:34.920> magnitude<00:05:35.430> of<00:05:35.520> a

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:35.640 
about looking at just the magnitude of a

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:36.980 
about looking at just the magnitude of a
complex<00:05:35.940> number<00:05:36.060> which<00:05:36.450> we'll<00:05:36.600> learn<00:05:36.720> about

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:36.990 
complex number which we'll learn about

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:40.130 
complex number which we'll learn about
more<00:05:37.230> in<00:05:37.470> the<00:05:38.100> next<00:05:38.340> video<00:05:38.550> so<00:05:39.360> if<00:05:39.480> we<00:05:39.660> had<00:05:39.810> if

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:40.140 
more in the next video so if we had if

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.140 
more in the next video so if we had if
we<00:05:40.290> have<00:05:40.410> a<00:05:40.440> look<00:05:40.650> at<00:05:40.680> the<00:05:40.800> magnitude<00:05:41.250> surely

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:42.150 
we have a look at the magnitude surely

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:45.200 
we have a look at the magnitude surely
we'd<00:05:42.300> be<00:05:42.420> able<00:05:42.510> to<00:05:42.980> find<00:05:43.980> an<00:05:44.250> increasing<00:05:44.970> order

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.210 
we'd be able to find an increasing order

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:46.940 
we'd be able to find an increasing order
to<00:05:45.690> write<00:05:45.870> them<00:05:46.020> in<00:05:46.110> an<00:05:46.230> increasing<00:05:46.680> order<00:05:46.860> of

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:46.950 
to write them in an increasing order of

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:50.720 
to write them in an increasing order of
all<00:05:47.310> I<00:05:47.840> wrap<00:05:48.840> our<00:05:49.080> complex<00:05:49.650> numbers<00:05:50.070> but<00:05:50.640> if

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:50.730 
all I wrap our complex numbers but if

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:52.280 
all I wrap our complex numbers but if
you<00:05:50.820> have<00:05:50.970> a<00:05:51.000> look<00:05:51.120> at<00:05:51.210> these<00:05:51.360> two<00:05:51.630> numbers<00:05:51.660> z1

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:52.290 
you have a look at these two numbers z1

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:56.000 
you have a look at these two numbers z1
equals<00:05:52.920> 2t<00:05:53.280> plus<00:05:53.490> 3i<00:05:53.790> and<00:05:54.270> dead<00:05:55.020> 2<00:05:55.260> equals<00:05:55.650> 2<00:05:55.770> 3

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:56.010 
equals 2t plus 3i and dead 2 equals 2 3

00:05:56.010 --> 00:06:00.230 
equals 2t plus 3i and dead 2 equals 2 3
plus<00:05:56.250> 2i<00:05:56.930> then<00:05:57.930> their<00:05:58.820> magnitude<00:05:59.820> so<00:06:00.060> if<00:06:00.120> we

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 
plus 2i then their magnitude so if we

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.550 
plus 2i then their magnitude so if we
take<00:06:00.420> the<00:06:00.600> modulus<00:06:00.780> and<00:06:01.290> we'll<00:06:01.380> learn<00:06:01.500> more

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:01.560 
take the modulus and we'll learn more

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.710 
take the modulus and we'll learn more
about<00:06:01.770> modulus<00:06:02.340> later<00:06:02.640> on<00:06:02.880> but<00:06:03.330> if<00:06:03.450> we<00:06:03.570> take

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:03.720 
about modulus later on but if we take

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.170 
about modulus later on but if we take
the<00:06:03.870> modulus<00:06:04.260> of<00:06:04.520> these<00:06:05.520> two<00:06:05.730> complex<00:06:06.000> numbers

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:06.180 
the modulus of these two complex numbers

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:07.510 
the modulus of these two complex numbers
they're<00:06:06.570> equal

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:07.520 
they're equal

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.190 
they're equal
now<00:06:08.520> we'll<00:06:08.850> also<00:06:09.030> learn<00:06:09.300> later<00:06:09.510> on<00:06:09.720> that<00:06:09.870> these

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:10.200 
now we'll also learn later on that these

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:11.990 
now we'll also learn later on that these
two<00:06:10.470> complex<00:06:11.100> numbers<00:06:11.130> are<00:06:11.460> not<00:06:11.610> equal

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:12.000 
two complex numbers are not equal

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.240 
two complex numbers are not equal
because<00:06:12.210> their<00:06:12.540> parts<00:06:12.900> are<00:06:13.020> not<00:06:13.110> equal<00:06:13.410> here<00:06:13.920> x

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:14.250 
because their parts are not equal here x

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:16.940 
because their parts are not equal here x
and<00:06:14.550> y<00:06:14.910> are<00:06:14.940> not<00:06:15.300> equal<00:06:15.660> so<00:06:15.780> therefore<00:06:16.230> these

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:16.950 
and y are not equal so therefore these

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:19.700 
and y are not equal so therefore these
two<00:06:17.130> complex<00:06:17.550> numbers<00:06:17.610> are<00:06:17.910> not<00:06:18.030> equal<00:06:18.360> so<00:06:18.710> we

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:19.710 
two complex numbers are not equal so we

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:23.270 
two complex numbers are not equal so we
can't<00:06:20.750> list<00:06:21.750> the<00:06:22.050> complex<00:06:22.650> numbers<00:06:22.950> in<00:06:23.130> an

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:23.280 
can't list the complex numbers in an

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.250 
can't list the complex numbers in an
increasing<00:06:23.850> order<00:06:24.000> or<00:06:24.330> in<00:06:24.660> a<00:06:24.750> decreasing

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:25.260 
increasing order or in a decreasing

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.560 
increasing order or in a decreasing
order<00:06:25.410> and<00:06:25.530> so<00:06:25.890> the<00:06:26.550> complex<00:06:26.910> numbers<00:06:27.180> are<00:06:27.330> not

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:27.570 
order and so the complex numbers are not

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:31.910 
order and so the complex numbers are not
ordered<00:06:28.790> okay<00:06:29.790> so<00:06:29.850> next<00:06:30.750> video<00:06:31.110> will<00:06:31.350> be<00:06:31.380> more

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:31.920 
ordered okay so next video will be more

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:33.650 
ordered okay so next video will be more
about<00:06:32.160> complex<00:06:32.580> numbers<00:06:32.970> and<00:06:33.150> a<00:06:33.330> couple<00:06:33.510> of

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:33.660 
about complex numbers and a couple of

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:35.750 
about complex numbers and a couple of
their<00:06:33.810> properties<00:06:34.200> so<00:06:35.100> I<00:06:35.310> hope<00:06:35.400> you<00:06:35.520> enjoyed

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:35.760 
their properties so I hope you enjoyed
