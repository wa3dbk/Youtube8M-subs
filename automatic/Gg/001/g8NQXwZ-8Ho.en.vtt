can't say look when you close it down

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.050 
can't say look when you close it down
looks<00:01:56.740> a<00:01:56.890> bit<00:01:56.920> thicker<00:01:57.250> than<00:01:57.340> other<00:01:57.670> devices

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
looks a bit thicker than other devices

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.420 
looks a bit thicker than other devices
but<00:01:58.650> it<00:01:59.650> should<00:02:00.280> be<00:02:00.970> pretty<00:02:01.500> rugged<00:02:02.500> and<00:02:02.830> be

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
but it should be pretty rugged and be

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.910 
but it should be pretty rugged and be
able<00:02:04.300> to<00:02:04.420> use<00:02:04.570> in<00:02:04.810> the<00:02:05.080> education<00:02:05.710> market

without being abused too much so this

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.820
