00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.500
Here we are on a basic bend, fairly typical,

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.500
changing direction on a mountain bike is very important

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.000
obviously to follow the track but also to avoid obstacles.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.500
It is important to completely understand the position and techniques to adopt 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.000
to do that as easily as possible.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.500
You need to know that, when riding a bike

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.000
you should have the pedals horizontal.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.500
It is important to understand that each time you tilt the machine

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.500
to change direction

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.500
you need to alter the position of your feet

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.000
and make sure that your outside pedal is always at the bottom.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
So when you turn, the pedal is at the bottom

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
so you can tilt the bike 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
without adjusting your body wieght and so maintain as much traction as possible.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.000
To do that, it is very important to raise your outside elbow

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
to really tilt the machine

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
and keep your body weight perpendicular to the ground.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Once you have got these techniques

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
it is equally important to be able to read the characteristics of the bend.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Here, on a bend like this, you can see the start, a part which is slightly raised

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.500
..and a part at the end which is less raised.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.000
So position the bike, on the outside

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
to really lower your outside pedal,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:58.000
lift your outside elbow and lean the machine to control your speed through to the end of the bend.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
To start with, try to understand and feel the curve

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
and then try adding momentum and speed.
