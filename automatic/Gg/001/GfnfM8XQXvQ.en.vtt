simple<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:13.439> you<00:01:13.950> wanna<00:01:14.070> put<00:01:14.189> that<00:01:14.250> there<00:01:14.610> and

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
simple and you wanna put that there and

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.640 
simple and you wanna put that there and
then<00:01:14.970> some<00:01:15.330> number<00:01:15.689> so<00:01:15.930> depending<00:01:16.500> on<00:01:16.560> what

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
then some number so depending on what

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:17.899 
then some number so depending on what
number<00:01:16.680> you<00:01:17.009> put<00:01:17.130> in<00:01:17.250> front<00:01:17.400> of<00:01:17.520> that<00:01:17.670> will

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
number you put in front of that will

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.789 
number you put in front of that will
determine<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.840> color<00:01:18.990> so<00:01:19.229> if<00:01:19.350> you<00:01:19.409> put<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.590> zero

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
determine the color so if you put a zero

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.440 
determine the color so if you put a zero
there<00:01:19.860> it'll<00:01:20.189> be<00:01:20.310> color<00:01:20.490> black<00:01:20.790> if<00:01:21.150> you<00:01:21.270> pull

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
there it'll be color black if you pull

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.270 
there it'll be color black if you pull
one<00:01:21.479> there<00:01:21.900> it'll<00:01:22.080> be<00:01:22.140> dark<00:01:22.380> blue<00:01:22.680> if<00:01:23.009> you<00:01:23.100> put

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
one there it'll be dark blue if you put

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.190 
one there it'll be dark blue if you put
two<00:01:23.460> will<00:01:23.610> be<00:01:23.670> dark<00:01:23.909> green<00:01:24.119> I'll<00:01:24.330> put<00:01:24.630> that<00:01:24.750> on

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
two will be dark green I'll put that on

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.990 
two will be dark green I'll put that on
the<00:01:25.320> screen<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:25.770> hopefully<00:01:26.040> in<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.580> comments

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
the screen and hopefully in the comments

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.219 
the screen and hopefully in the comments
down<00:01:27.090> below<00:01:27.150> in<00:01:27.420> case<00:01:27.570> you<00:01:27.630> want<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:27.869> find<00:01:28.020> that

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
down below in case you want to find that

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.260 
down below in case you want to find that
basically<00:01:28.890> as<00:01:29.130> you<00:01:29.280> can<00:01:29.400> see<00:01:29.579> this<00:01:29.850> means<00:01:30.090> all

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
basically as you can see this means all

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.420 
basically as you can see this means all
of<00:01:30.360> that<00:01:30.479> would<00:01:30.630> black<00:01:30.920> then<00:01:31.920> if<00:01:32.009> I<00:01:32.100> go<00:01:32.250> over<00:01:32.280> to

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
of that would black then if I go over to

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.620 
of that would black then if I go over to
the<00:01:32.549> brew<00:01:32.729> so<00:01:32.909> I<00:01:32.970> want<00:01:33.119> a<00:01:33.150> route<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.479> be

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
the brew so I want a route to be

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.300 
the brew so I want a route to be
different<00:01:33.900> color<00:01:34.079> what<00:01:34.680> I'll<00:01:34.770> do<00:01:34.920> is<00:01:35.040> I'll<00:01:35.159> go

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
different color what I'll do is I'll go

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.800 
different color what I'll do is I'll go
over<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.490> here<00:01:35.700> I'll<00:01:35.820> make<00:01:36.000> this<00:01:36.210> thing<00:01:36.659> just

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
over to here I'll make this thing just

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.539 
over to here I'll make this thing just
here<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.320> let's<00:01:37.560> say<00:01:37.740> this<00:01:37.920> time<00:01:38.159> for<00:01:38.400> this

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
here and let's say this time for this

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.010 
here and let's say this time for this
part<00:01:38.790> we'll<00:01:38.970> use<00:01:39.090> gold<00:01:39.450> because<00:01:39.689> gold<00:01:39.720> is<00:01:39.960> a

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
part we'll use gold because gold is a

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.899 
part we'll use gold because gold is a
nice<00:01:40.170> color<00:01:40.380> so<00:01:40.590> gold<00:01:40.860> is<00:01:41.009> six<00:01:41.340> on<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.640> scale

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
nice color so gold is six on the scale

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.810 
nice color so gold is six on the scale
so<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.689> and<00:01:43.079> will<00:01:43.290> be<00:01:43.439> black<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:44.040> these<00:01:44.310> the

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
so the and will be black and these the

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.609 
so the and will be black and these the
brew<00:01:44.970> will<00:01:45.119> be<00:01:45.210> gold<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:45.689> that<00:01:45.960> should<00:01:46.259> it

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
brew will be gold and that should it

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:47.780 
brew will be gold and that should it
will<00:01:46.710> look<00:01:46.799> like<00:01:46.920> this<00:01:47.130> when<00:01:47.310> it's<00:01:47.430> done<00:01:47.610> which

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
will look like this when it's done which

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:48.800 
will look like this when it's done which
you<00:01:47.820> might<00:01:47.970> be<00:01:48.060> like<00:01:48.210> wait<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:48.450> minute<00:01:48.659> so<00:01:48.780> I

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
you might be like wait a minute so I

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.600 
you might be like wait a minute so I
can't<00:01:49.049> that's<00:01:49.079> not<00:01:49.409> a<00:01:49.439> colored<00:01:49.710> nametag<00:01:50.100> but

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
can't that's not a colored nametag but

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.749 
can't that's not a colored nametag but
if<00:01:50.850> you<00:01:50.970> then<00:01:51.119> use<00:01:51.180> this<00:01:51.659> colored<00:01:51.899> name<00:01:52.049> tag<00:01:52.259> so

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
if you then use this colored name tag so

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:55.429 
if you then use this colored name tag so
let's<00:01:53.759> use<00:01:53.880> on<00:01:54.000> this<00:01:54.180> horse<00:01:54.390> just<00:01:54.659> here<00:01:54.869> as<00:01:55.110> you

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
let's use on this horse just here as you

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.260 
let's use on this horse just here as you
can<00:01:55.590> see<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:56.070> end<00:01:56.219> is<00:01:56.399> black<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.000> Ruis

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
can see the end is black and the Ruis

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.120 
can see the end is black and the Ruis
code<00:01:57.540> you<00:01:57.750> can<00:01:57.869> get<00:01:58.020> some<00:01:58.200> really<00:01:58.590> really<00:01:58.799> cool

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:24.549 
in the cropping table you find this

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:27.509 
in the cropping table you find this
symbol<00:02:24.819> just<00:02:25.480> here<00:02:26.319> and<00:02:26.560> then<00:02:27.310> you<00:02:27.370> put

something<00:02:27.670> in<00:02:27.790> front<00:02:27.819> of<00:02:28.000> it<00:02:28.150> so<00:02:28.269> for<00:02:28.900> this<00:02:28.989> one

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
something in front of it so for this one

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.110 
something in front of it so for this one
we're<00:02:29.470> gonna<00:02:29.620> be<00:02:29.890> a<00:02:29.920> wheeze<00:02:30.340> of<00:02:30.519> white<00:02:30.700> nametag

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
we're gonna be a wheeze of white nametag

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.640 
we're gonna be a wheeze of white nametag
which<00:02:31.359> might<00:02:31.599> actually<00:02:31.629> not<00:02:31.959> be<00:02:32.019> up<00:02:32.170> shop<00:02:32.409> but

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
which might actually not be up shop but

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.399 
which might actually not be up shop but
we<00:02:32.709> use<00:02:32.799> f<00:02:33.040> and<00:02:33.280> then<00:02:33.700> we'll<00:02:33.819> go<00:02:34.030> why<00:02:34.569> it's<00:02:34.870> just

00:02:35.399 --> 00:02:35.409 
we use f and then we'll go why it's just

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:37.110 
we use f and then we'll go why it's just
just<00:02:35.680> to<00:02:35.739> be<00:02:35.799> weird<00:02:36.129> and<00:02:36.370> strange<00:02:36.640> like<00:02:36.909> that

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
just to be weird and strange like that

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.149 
just to be weird and strange like that
and<00:02:37.299> as<00:02:37.780> you<00:02:37.870> can<00:02:37.989> see<00:02:38.200> it<00:02:38.349> will<00:02:38.799> show<00:02:38.980> like

00:02:39.149 --> 00:02:39.159 
and as you can see it will show like

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:41.429 
and as you can see it will show like
this<00:02:39.750> but<00:02:40.750> that<00:02:40.780> should<00:02:41.049> mean<00:02:41.170> when<00:02:41.379> we

00:02:41.429 --> 00:02:41.439 
this but that should mean when we

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:42.780 
this but that should mean when we
complete<00:02:41.739> it<00:02:41.769> and<00:02:42.040> I'm<00:02:42.129> use<00:02:42.280> it<00:02:42.370> on<00:02:42.430> something

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
complete it and I'm use it on something

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.789 
complete it and I'm use it on something
let's<00:02:43.420> use<00:02:43.599> on<00:02:43.720> this<00:02:43.810> horse<00:02:44.049> just<00:02:44.260> here<00:02:44.439> it'll

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:44.799 
let's use on this horse just here it'll

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:46.259 
let's use on this horse just here it'll
be<00:02:44.890> in<00:02:44.980> white<00:02:45.220> then<00:02:45.459> instead<00:02:45.849> of<00:02:45.909> all<00:02:46.150> these

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
be in white then instead of all these

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:48.030 
be in white then instead of all these
other<00:02:46.450> colors<00:02:46.659> so<00:02:46.840> just<00:02:47.470> in<00:02:47.560> case<00:02:47.680> that<00:02:47.859> is

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
other colors so just in case that is

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.860 
other colors so just in case that is
something<00:02:48.430> you<00:02:48.579> want<00:02:48.790> this<00:02:49.269> that<00:02:49.540> sound

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
something you want this that sound

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
nametags working for Minecraft or the

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.910 
nametags working for Minecraft or the
Xbox<00:02:52.299> you<00:02:52.599> can<00:02:52.720> actually<00:02:52.810> combine<00:02:53.079> a<00:02:53.290> random

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
Xbox you can actually combine a random

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.199 
Xbox you can actually combine a random
and<00:02:54.069> a<00:02:54.099> different<00:02:54.370> color<00:02:54.489> if<00:02:54.579> you<00:02:54.639> want<00:02:54.879> by<00:02:55.180> the

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
and a different color if you want by the

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:56.280 
and a different color if you want by the
way<00:02:55.299> white<00:02:55.510> it<00:02:55.629> seems<00:02:55.840> to<00:02:55.900> be<00:02:55.959> the<00:02:56.019> default

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
way white it seems to be the default

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.050 
way white it seems to be the default
color<00:02:56.590> so<00:02:56.799> look<00:02:56.980> it<00:02:57.310> looks<00:02:57.489> just<00:02:57.670> fine<00:02:57.879> like

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
color so look it looks just fine like

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.550 
color so look it looks just fine like
the<00:02:58.180> other<00:02:58.299> ones<00:02:58.420> it's<00:02:58.599> very<00:02:58.989> slightly<00:02:59.470> off

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
the other ones it's very slightly off

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.170 
the other ones it's very slightly off
but<00:02:59.829> you<00:02:59.920> can't<00:03:00.189> even<00:03:00.370> really<00:03:00.609> notice<00:03:00.909> it<00:03:01.000> so

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
but you can't even really notice it so

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.550 
but you can't even really notice it so
