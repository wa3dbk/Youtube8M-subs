00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
were like three or four games that could

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.270 
were like three or four games that could
have<00:02:51.360> gone<00:02:51.450> either<00:02:51.510> way<00:02:51.920> we<00:02:52.920> could<00:02:53.100> have<00:02:53.190> been

staring<00:02:53.700> I<00:02:53.790> told<00:02:53.970> the<00:02:54.060> guy<00:02:54.209> back<00:02:54.630> there

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
staring I told the guy back there

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.510 
staring I told the guy back there
because<00:02:55.140> it's<00:02:55.230> been<00:02:55.260> staring<00:02:55.800> at<00:02:55.890> a<00:02:55.950> 1/3

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
because it's been staring at a 1/3

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.330 
because it's been staring at a 1/3
deficit<00:02:57.090> instead<00:02:57.930> of<00:02:58.020> being<00:02:58.230> up<00:02:58.350> 3-1<00:02:58.560> and

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
deficit instead of being up 3-1 and

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.449 
deficit instead of being up 3-1 and
that's<00:02:59.490> how<00:02:59.640> close<00:02:59.880> to<00:03:00.030> what<00:03:00.709> then<00:03:01.709> we<00:03:01.860> I'll
