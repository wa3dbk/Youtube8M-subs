00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:17.130
 people today the computer machines 620 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:18.920
 you have a problem with the button 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:28.019
 switched on 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:32.130
 this charro button needs to disarm the 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:34.290
 to be able to make it work 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.870
 correctly 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:41.340
 we will see with disarmament and later 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:44.040
 we will continue with the cleaning while 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:48.629
 you have to take special care in the 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:52.129
 Disassemble carefully with the screws and do not 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:56.850
 It has good memory for screws 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:01:00.449
 you need to group them in sizes 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:04.170
 This computer does most of its 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:06.570
 screws are of the same size 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.260
 so there's no problem in some 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:14.310
 other computers while different 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:21.299
 measurements and it is important to know the size 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:24.810
 correct since if it is wrong it can 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.580
 traverse the casing and if you dedicate yourself 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.159
 to work this the client can be 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.610
 bother a lot for that little edge 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.610
 what went out 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:40.430
 try to avoid taking things away with 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.960
 be careful here I am doing it in 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.130
 fast camera 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:47.409
 also defends the machine very 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.409
 fast I already have experience with stu 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:57.399
 but you have to be careful because there 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:57.399
 certain components that are fragile 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:04.250
 good to be broken or flexible worse 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.670
 if we do not have it at hand and we do not have 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.670
 a spare 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:28.130
 so we continue with the video of 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:28.130
 moment we are all screws 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.890
 with experience one learns 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:45.180
 identify them quickly and not 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:51.859
 you need to group them in groups by 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:51.859
 sizes and you know where you are going 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:01.290
 the idea was the engine turned on but in 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.599
 this case yes I have that machine 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.969
 Full there are machines that 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:09.480
 can disarm simply remove the 

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:15.810
 cover panel on and 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:18.389
 Button is easy to assemble this case 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:27.419
 the case covered the button and we 

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:28.739
 We occupied a small door that leads is very 

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:33.150
 important that when that is not a 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:35.790
 machine very well where is 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.680
 Exercising the pressure points is 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.299
 good to use a bad company nail for 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.010
 example here is exerting a point 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:44.459
 of pressure and tells me that this one had 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:46.560
 a screw that was bothering and I think 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:50.310
 that we are and here we are the top 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:53.579
 front easily the button 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:55.739
 on this one you just have to 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:58.459
 remove the conversation he has on him 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:02.510
 you can vote the commune signed is very 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:02.510
 thin and thin blade 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:17.300
 with a knife he mistreated him a lot 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.300
 because we have to put it back 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:23.910
 these little flaquitas that leads that 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:29.120
 they are like ballads 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:33.330
 It is usually generated by the use 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:37.290
 car and you have to clean them 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:38.940
 as well as the part of the engine those that what 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:41.250
 that only the part you should do 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.310
 Contact 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:46.410
 here you can use isopropyl alcohol 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:51.990
 good to announce also put already 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:55.640
 with a screwdriver try to guitar everything 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:58.640
 whatever it is to cook or 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:58.640
 society 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:12.850
 isopropyl alcohol is that it is a 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:14.830
 alcohol a very high percentage of 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:17.530
 alcohol and it evaporates quickly like that 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:21.630
 there is no problem which also 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.630
 It is used for navarro motherboards 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:31.030
 quickly with the air gun or what 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:34.540
 can leave a while and evaporate area not 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:47.950
 leave water waste like alcohol like 

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:56.590
 of the small pharmacy box if the 

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:59.650
 we place the half protecting 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:03.250
 the vote to be very careful because 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:09.100
 As they are very small pieces they can 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:12.730
 get lost and get what you can get 

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:16.990
 disarming a motherboard a laptop 

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:21.760
 that you have out there and functional that 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:27.250
 we use the components as the key 

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:29.830
 on the button 'enter pressure has 

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:34.840
 insurance secured in some cases 

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:37.210
 can stop the crazy where the 

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:42.910
 sure that you hit with the vote so that 

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:46.980
 we have not been pressured and we proceed to 

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:46.980
 solder these small parts 

00:06:50.979 --> 00:06:55.519
 once finished 

00:06:53.029 --> 00:06:58.369
 we tried the machine I recommend 

00:06:55.519 --> 00:07:02.119
 Always test the machine before 

00:06:58.369 --> 00:07:05.689
 sign it so there are no faults and the 

00:07:02.119 --> 00:07:10.909
 The charged battery can place there 

00:07:05.689 --> 00:07:12.529
 to be very careful not to leave something 

00:07:10.909 --> 00:07:14.329
 that is going to touch by the components of 

00:07:12.529 --> 00:07:17.419
 the machine while it has some kind 

00:07:14.329 --> 00:07:20.389
 of current energy because this 

00:07:17.419 --> 00:07:24.799
 machine is estimated live already learned 

00:07:20.389 --> 00:07:25.879
 quickly once proven that the 

00:07:24.799 --> 00:07:32.029
 machine works 

00:07:25.879 --> 00:07:34.689
 we proceed weapons we have the part of the 

00:07:32.029 --> 00:07:40.819
 armed and we'll see if to the armed machine 

00:07:34.689 --> 00:07:42.289
 and running has recorded the video if it has 

00:07:40.819 --> 00:07:47.919
 been used for you 

00:07:42.289 --> 00:07:47.919
 the aic subscribe other channels 

00:07:48.049 --> 00:07:53.409
 we see in the next tutorial more 

00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:59.420
 two
