00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
now I'm not going to keep zooming in and

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:07.620 
now I'm not going to keep zooming in and
out<00:02:00.040> because<00:02:00.369> you<00:02:01.030> get<00:02:01.360> seasick<00:02:01.990> and<00:02:06.509> it<00:02:07.509> was

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
out because you get seasick and it was

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.410 
out because you get seasick and it was
just<00:02:07.869> so<00:02:08.080> you<00:02:08.140> could<00:02:08.380> actually<00:02:08.560> see<00:02:09.420> those

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
just so you could actually see those

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:30.330 
just so you could actually see those
starting<00:02:11.110> max<00:02:28.410> I've<00:02:29.410> worked<00:02:29.680> out<00:02:29.950> that<00:02:30.160> for

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
starting max I've worked out that for

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.309 
starting max I've worked out that for
myself

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
myself

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:34.410 
myself
when<00:02:32.319> I<00:02:32.350> do<00:02:32.530> the<00:02:32.800> impression<00:02:33.340> in<00:02:33.459> three

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
when I do the impression in three

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.860 
when I do the impression in three
strokes<00:02:34.720> of<00:02:34.989> the<00:02:35.080> file<00:02:35.319> is<00:02:35.769> roughly<00:02:36.870> each

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
strokes of the file is roughly each

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.490 
strokes of the file is roughly each
depth<00:02:38.260> on<00:02:38.500> a<00:02:38.530> key<00:02:38.860> obviously<00:02:39.459> different<00:02:40.090> keys

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
depth on a key obviously different keys

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.559 
depth on a key obviously different keys
of<00:02:41.500> different<00:02:42.130> depths<00:02:42.790> and<00:02:43.000> what-have-you

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569 
of different depths and what-have-you

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:47.580 
of different depths and what-have-you
but<00:02:43.950> when<00:02:44.950> it<00:02:45.130> comes<00:02:45.340> to<00:02:45.900> most<00:02:46.900> of<00:02:47.110> them<00:02:47.260> if<00:02:47.410> I

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
but when it comes to most of them if I

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.410 
but when it comes to most of them if I
do<00:02:47.799> three<00:02:48.070> strokes<00:02:48.310> it<00:02:48.640> tends<00:02:48.880> to<00:02:48.970> be<00:02:49.150> fairly

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
do three strokes it tends to be fairly

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.300 
do three strokes it tends to be fairly
accurate<00:02:49.570> to<00:02:50.140> the<00:02:50.230> next<00:02:50.530> depth<00:02:50.739> which<00:02:51.100> is

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
accurate to the next depth which is

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.490 
accurate to the next depth which is
where<00:02:51.489> you<00:02:51.610> want<00:02:51.790> to<00:02:51.910> be<00:02:52.170> obviously<00:02:53.170> if<00:02:53.320> you're

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
where you want to be obviously if you're

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.830 
where you want to be obviously if you're
brand<00:02:53.709> new<00:02:53.769> to<00:02:53.890> impression<00:02:54.610> and<00:02:54.760> only<00:02:55.600> file

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
brand new to impression and only file

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.970 
brand new to impression and only file
away<00:02:56.049> the<00:02:56.709> max<00:02:56.980> that<00:02:57.280> you<00:02:57.400> can<00:02:57.579> definitely<00:02:57.820> see

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
away the max that you can definitely see

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.039 
away the max that you can definitely see
see<00:02:59.980> your<00:03:00.100> Mac<00:03:00.280> on<00:03:00.519> off<00:03:00.670> over<00:03:01.180> them<00:03:01.360> just<00:03:01.750> zoom

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
see your Mac on off over them just zoom

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:04.830 
see your Mac on off over them just zoom
in<00:03:02.260> again<00:03:02.380> on<00:03:02.769> this<00:03:03.670> one<00:03:03.730> while<00:03:04.209> the<00:03:04.390> fairly

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
in again on this one while the fairly

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.550 
in again on this one while the fairly
clear<00:03:05.140> fear<00:03:06.000> and<00:03:07.000> as<00:03:07.150> you<00:03:07.269> can<00:03:07.420> see<00:03:07.480> there<00:03:08.019> it's

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
clear fear and as you can see there it's

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:15.030 
clear fear and as you can see there it's
a<00:03:08.650> Mac<00:03:08.890> on<00:03:09.160> each<00:03:09.340> one<00:03:09.579> of<00:03:09.640> them<00:03:09.910> again<00:03:13.950> right<00:03:14.950> so

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
a Mac on each one of them again right so

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.680 
a Mac on each one of them again right so
I'm<00:03:15.100> going<00:03:15.220> to<00:03:15.310> crack<00:03:15.519> on<00:03:15.730> now<00:03:15.970> on<00:03:16.090> impression

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
I'm going to crack on now on impression

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:31.429 
I'm going to crack on now on impression
this

00:03:31.429 --> 00:03:31.439 

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:33.899 

so<00:03:32.439> basically<00:03:32.950> now<00:03:33.189> all<00:03:33.400> I'm<00:03:33.549> doing<00:03:33.579> is

00:03:33.899 --> 00:03:33.909 
so basically now all I'm doing is

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:36.720 
so basically now all I'm doing is
repeating<00:03:34.480> that<00:03:34.659> formula<00:03:35.319> for<00:03:36.250> you<00:03:36.400> to<00:03:36.610> this

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
repeating that formula for you to this

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.780 
repeating that formula for you to this
as<00:03:36.939> I<00:03:36.970> say<00:03:37.299> only<00:03:37.930> file<00:03:38.170> away<00:03:38.379> the<00:03:39.340> dot<00:03:39.549> that<00:03:39.760> you

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
as I say only file away the dot that you

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.149 
as I say only file away the dot that you
see<00:03:39.879> if<00:03:40.780> this<00:03:41.019> is<00:03:41.140> one<00:03:41.379> then<00:03:41.590> you're<00:03:41.769> not<00:03:41.890> sure

00:03:42.149 --> 00:03:42.159 
see if this is one then you're not sure

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:43.020 
see if this is one then you're not sure
of<00:03:42.310> is<00:03:42.430> that<00:03:42.610> a<00:03:42.640> dot

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
of is that a dot

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.880 
of is that a dot
isn't<00:03:43.269> that<00:03:43.329> a<00:03:43.450> dart<00:03:43.810> unless<00:03:44.439> you're<00:03:44.620> hundred

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
isn't that a dart unless you're hundred

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.420 
isn't that a dart unless you're hundred
percent<00:03:45.220> sure<00:03:45.340> it<00:03:46.269> is<00:03:46.390> a<00:03:46.420> marking<00:03:47.430> an

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
percent sure it is a marking an

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.809 
percent sure it is a marking an
impression<00:03:49.060> that's<00:03:49.269> been<00:03:49.450> left<00:03:49.720> on<00:03:49.930> the<00:03:50.140> key

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:50.819 
impression that's been left on the key

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:56.039 
impression that's been left on the key
don't<00:03:51.819> touch<00:03:52.090> it<00:03:52.590> just<00:03:53.590> leave<00:03:53.859> it<00:03:54.810> again<00:03:55.810> I've

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:56.049 
don't touch it just leave it again I've

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:58.259 
don't touch it just leave it again I've
got<00:03:56.200> one<00:03:56.409> on<00:03:56.439> each<00:03:56.739> again<00:03:57.189> so<00:03:57.670> we'll<00:03:57.819> take<00:03:58.030> them

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
got one on each again so we'll take them

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:27.970 
got one on each again so we'll take them
off

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:27.980 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:31.060 

so<00:04:28.730> this<00:04:28.970> time<00:04:29.330> I<00:04:29.660> can<00:04:30.080> only<00:04:30.230> see<00:04:30.470> a<00:04:30.500> marking<00:04:30.950> on

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070 
so this time I can only see a marking on

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:41.620 
so this time I can only see a marking on
number<00:04:31.430> one<00:04:31.610> and<00:04:31.790> number<00:04:31.940> four<00:04:40.180> the<00:04:41.180> only<00:04:41.450> ones

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 
number one and number four the only ones

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:43.210 
number one and number four the only ones
we're<00:04:41.840> going<00:04:41.960> to<00:04:42.050> do<00:04:42.230> there<00:04:42.500> is<00:04:42.590> a<00:04:42.620> possible

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
we're going to do there is a possible

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.730 
we're going to do there is a possible
one<00:04:43.400> on<00:04:43.550> number<00:04:43.940> three<00:04:44.210> but<00:04:45.140> we're<00:04:45.530> going<00:04:45.650> to

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740 
one on number three but we're going to

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:55.200 
one on number three but we're going to
leave<00:04:45.920> that<00:04:45.980> until<00:04:46.730> that<00:04:46.970> becomes<00:04:47.090> a<00:04:47.450> definite

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.210 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.880 

so<00:04:56.210> looking<00:04:56.630> now<00:04:57.040> number<00:04:58.040> one's<00:04:58.250> a<00:04:58.460> definite

00:04:59.880 --> 00:04:59.890 
so looking now number one's a definite

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:19.710 
so looking now number one's a definite
number<00:05:00.890> two<00:05:16.690> it's<00:05:17.690> gone<00:05:17.930> already<00:05:18.500> man

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:19.720 
number two it's gone already man

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.330 
number two it's gone already man
not<00:05:20.720> surprised<00:05:21.110> it's<00:05:21.350> a<00:05:21.410> master<00:05:21.710> padlock<00:05:22.100> as<00:05:22.250> I

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:22.340 
not surprised it's a master padlock as I

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:23.710 
not surprised it's a master padlock as I
said<00:05:22.520> in<00:05:22.640> the<00:05:22.760> beginning<00:05:22.880> the<00:05:23.300> normally

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:23.720 
said in the beginning the normally

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.140 
said in the beginning the normally
straightforward<00:05:24.470> to<00:05:24.620> impression<00:05:25.070> you<00:05:25.910> can

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.150 
straightforward to impression you can

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:29.820 
straightforward to impression you can
hear<00:05:26.570> just<00:05:27.010> a<00:05:28.010> very<00:05:28.220> slight<00:05:28.550> click<00:05:29.060> in<00:05:29.270> there

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:29.830 
hear just a very slight click in there

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.790 
hear just a very slight click in there
that<00:05:30.830> tells<00:05:31.130> me<00:05:31.310> it's<00:05:31.430> not<00:05:31.490> a<00:05:31.700> perfect<00:05:32.330> key<00:05:32.800> I'm

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:33.800 
that tells me it's not a perfect key I'm

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.270 
that tells me it's not a perfect key I'm
probably<00:05:34.190> nearly<00:05:34.730> there<00:05:34.970> but<00:05:35.570> just<00:05:36.040> tiny<00:05:37.040> bit

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:37.280 
probably nearly there but just tiny bit

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:38.980 
probably nearly there but just tiny bit
a<00:05:37.310> file<00:05:37.640> and<00:05:37.850> what<00:05:37.970> I<00:05:38.000> tend<00:05:38.210> to<00:05:38.360> find<00:05:38.630> if<00:05:38.870> you
