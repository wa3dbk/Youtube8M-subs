and<00:02:19.830> 46<00:02:20.610> years<00:02:20.850> also<00:02:21.150> we<00:02:21.870> see<00:02:22.050> tremendous

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
and 46 years also we see tremendous

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.890 
and 46 years also we see tremendous

that<00:02:24.960> monument<00:02:25.500> just<00:02:25.650> rains<00:02:26.310> and<00:02:26.730> melting

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
that monument just rains and melting

going<00:03:47.489> on<00:03:47.610> about<00:03:47.850> oil<00:03:48.150> yeah<00:03:48.510> it's<00:03:48.690> also<00:03:48.840> about

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
going on about oil yeah it's also about

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:51.020 
going on about oil yeah it's also about
religion<00:03:49.470> oil<00:03:50.010> is<00:03:50.310> so<00:03:50.459> much<00:03:50.610> bigger<00:03:50.850> than

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
religion oil is so much bigger than

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.540 
religion oil is so much bigger than
religion<00:03:51.750> we<00:03:51.959> if<00:03:52.140> they<00:03:52.290> can<00:03:52.470> actually<00:03:52.980> make

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:53.550 
religion we if they can actually make

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.120 
religion we if they can actually make
oil<00:03:53.970> in<00:03:54.450> a<00:03:54.540> factory<00:03:55.050> then<00:03:55.410> why<00:03:55.830> don't<00:03:55.890> they<00:03:56.070> do

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
oil in a factory then why don't they do

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.010 
oil in a factory then why don't they do
it<00:03:56.370> and<00:03:56.580> you<00:03:56.730> know<00:03:57.060> what<00:03:57.239> weather<00:03:57.480> just<00:03:57.780> one<00:03:57.930> of

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:58.020 
it and you know what weather just one of

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.320 
it and you know what weather just one of
the<00:03:58.110> Americans<00:03:58.560> just<00:03:58.770> make<00:03:59.100> oil<00:03:59.400> themselves

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
the Americans just make oil themselves

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.750 
the Americans just make oil themselves
and<00:04:00.570> you<00:04:00.900> know<00:04:01.050> stop<00:04:01.560> the<00:04:01.770> wars<00:04:02.040> stop<00:04:02.610> with

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
and you know stop the wars stop with

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.300 
and you know stop the wars stop with
this<00:04:02.850> off<00:04:03.140> offshore<00:04:04.140> I<00:04:04.320> mean<00:04:04.590> I<00:04:04.800> mean<00:04:04.920> if<00:04:05.190> they

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
this off offshore I mean I mean if they

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:06.979 
this off offshore I mean I mean if they
can<00:04:05.459> make<00:04:05.489> oil<00:04:05.880> themselves<00:04:06.390> then<00:04:06.540> offshore

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
can make oil themselves then offshore

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:08.570 
can make oil themselves then offshore
