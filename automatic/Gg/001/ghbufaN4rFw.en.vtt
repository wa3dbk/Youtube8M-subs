rest because I want him to remember what

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:12.420 
rest because I want him to remember what
he<00:02:10.360> just<00:02:10.660> did<00:02:10.840> so<00:02:11.590> then<00:02:11.739> we<00:02:11.829> continue<00:02:12.310> that

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
he just did so then we continue that

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:18.260 
he just did so then we continue that
process

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.340 

step<00:02:19.270> one<00:02:19.420> is<00:02:19.510> always<00:02:19.750> just<00:02:19.900> to<00:02:20.020> get<00:02:20.170> him

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
step one is always just to get him

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.080 
step one is always just to get him
comfortable<00:02:20.560> with<00:02:21.190> putting<00:02:21.400> his<00:02:21.610> face<00:02:21.760> in<00:02:21.820> the

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
comfortable with putting his face in the

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.820 
comfortable with putting his face in the
water<00:02:22.210> and<00:02:22.510> then<00:02:23.050> learning<00:02:23.260> to<00:02:23.380> breathe<00:02:23.590> out

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
water and then learning to breathe out

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.560 
water and then learning to breathe out
underwater<00:02:24.400> and<00:02:24.880> then<00:02:24.970> taking<00:02:25.210> a<00:02:25.270> breath<00:02:25.390> when

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
underwater and then taking a breath when

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.050 
underwater and then taking a breath when
he<00:02:25.630> comes<00:02:25.840> up<00:02:26.050> then<00:02:26.380> from<00:02:26.620> there<00:02:26.800> the<00:02:27.520> job<00:02:27.820> is

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
he comes up then from there the job is

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.330 
he comes up then from there the job is
to<00:02:28.330> establish<00:02:28.540> his<00:02:28.990> kick<00:02:29.260> and<00:02:29.710> teach<00:02:29.980> him<00:02:30.160> to

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
to establish his kick and teach him to

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.950 
to establish his kick and teach him to
kick<00:02:30.520> from<00:02:30.700> their<00:02:30.820> hips<00:02:31.030> not<00:02:31.660> from<00:02:31.840> their

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:31.960 
kick from their hips not from their

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.480 
kick from their hips not from their
needs<00:02:32.140> so<00:02:32.350> what<00:02:32.470> that<00:02:32.590> does<00:02:32.800> is<00:02:32.860> it<00:02:33.160> helps<00:02:33.190> them

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
needs so what that does is it helps them

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.670 
needs so what that does is it helps them
to<00:02:33.520> float<00:02:33.910> so<00:02:34.540> it<00:02:34.630> makes<00:02:34.810> it<00:02:34.900> a<00:02:34.960> lot<00:02:35.110> easier<00:02:35.590> for

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
to float so it makes it a lot easier for

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.440 
to float so it makes it a lot easier for
them<00:02:35.920> to<00:02:36.010> swim<00:02:36.280> once<00:02:36.790> they<00:02:36.910> incorporate<00:02:37.330> the

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
them to swim once they incorporate the

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.420 
them to swim once they incorporate the
stroke<00:02:37.750> and<00:02:37.990> once<00:02:38.560> he<00:02:38.650> got<00:02:38.770> that<00:02:38.980> which<00:02:39.160> he<00:02:39.280> did

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
stroke and once he got that which he did

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.370 
stroke and once he got that which he did
very<00:02:39.670> well<00:02:39.760> and<00:02:40.240> you<00:02:40.300> got<00:02:40.420> very<00:02:40.630> quickly<00:02:40.870> then

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
very well and you got very quickly then

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.380 
very well and you got very quickly then
I<00:02:41.500> could<00:02:41.740> incorporate<00:02:42.070> the<00:02:42.400> stroke<00:02:42.670> and<00:02:43.150> move

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
I could incorporate the stroke and move

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.070 
I could incorporate the stroke and move
from<00:02:43.510> there<00:02:44.730> the<00:02:45.730> hardest<00:02:46.180> part<00:02:46.450> is<00:02:46.600> where<00:02:47.050> I

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
from there the hardest part is where I

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.460 
from there the hardest part is where I
am<00:02:47.200> now<00:02:47.530> I<00:02:47.800> can<00:02:48.370> swim<00:02:48.750> but<00:02:49.750> learning<00:02:50.020> to<00:02:50.230> tread

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
am now I can swim but learning to tread

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.220 
am now I can swim but learning to tread
water<00:02:50.730> is<00:02:51.730> where<00:02:51.970> we<00:02:52.120> are<00:02:52.150> now<00:02:52.480> and<00:02:52.810> that's

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
water is where we are now and that's

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.140 
water is where we are now and that's
been<00:02:53.440> the<00:02:53.530> hardest<00:02:53.830> part<00:02:54.100> for<00:02:54.130> me<00:02:54.250> just<00:02:54.580> where

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
been the hardest part for me just where

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.730 
been the hardest part for me just where
you<00:02:55.270> get<00:02:55.390> your<00:02:55.420> body<00:02:55.660> totally<00:02:55.990> relaxed<00:02:56.470> in<00:02:56.650> the

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:56.740 
you get your body totally relaxed in the

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.530 
you get your body totally relaxed in the
pool<00:02:56.950> and<00:02:57.220> you<00:02:57.310> can<00:02:57.460> just<00:02:57.670> float<00:02:57.910> and<00:02:58.240> tread

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
pool and you can just float and tread

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.950 
pool and you can just float and tread
water<00:02:58.570> and<00:02:58.990> stay<00:02:59.140> afloat<00:02:59.440> as<00:02:59.830> a<00:03:00.370> swimmer<00:03:00.700> now

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:00.960 
water and stay afloat as a swimmer now

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.870 
water and stay afloat as a swimmer now
it's<00:03:01.960> something<00:03:02.350> that<00:03:02.770> is<00:03:02.890> fun<00:03:03.160> I<00:03:03.190> see<00:03:03.490> it's

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
it's something that is fun I see it's

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.670 
it's something that is fun I see it's
being<00:03:04.240> something<00:03:04.630> that<00:03:04.780> I<00:03:04.810> will<00:03:05.140> continue<00:03:05.530> to

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
being something that I will continue to

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.000 
being something that I will continue to
do<00:03:05.830> so<00:03:06.520> when<00:03:07.120> we<00:03:07.210> go<00:03:07.330> on<00:03:07.420> vacation<00:03:07.900> and<00:03:08.470> there's

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
do so when we go on vacation and there's

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.340 
do so when we go on vacation and there's
the<00:03:09.160> pool<00:03:09.370> I<00:03:09.700> won't<00:03:10.120> be<00:03:10.240> afraid<00:03:10.480> to<00:03:10.810> get<00:03:11.170> in<00:03:11.290> the

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
the pool I won't be afraid to get in the

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.710 
the pool I won't be afraid to get in the
pool<00:03:11.530> so<00:03:11.740> I<00:03:11.800> have<00:03:11.980> that<00:03:12.100> confidence<00:03:12.430> now<00:03:12.790> and

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
pool so I have that confidence now and

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.770 
pool so I have that confidence now and
it's<00:03:14.320> a<00:03:14.470> workout<00:03:14.860> so<00:03:15.550> it's<00:03:16.180> good<00:03:16.330> exercise<00:03:16.750> and

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
it's a workout so it's good exercise and

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.150 
it's a workout so it's good exercise and
I<00:03:17.080> think<00:03:17.290> this<00:03:17.440> is<00:03:17.560> something<00:03:17.740> that<00:03:17.950> I<00:03:18.010> will

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
I think this is something that I will

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.830 
I think this is something that I will
continue<00:03:18.370> to<00:03:18.520> do<00:03:18.700> now<00:03:18.910> that<00:03:19.120> I've<00:03:19.540> learned<00:03:19.720> to

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
continue to do now that I've learned to

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:34.620 
continue to do now that I've learned to
