00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
to fool around with the game and then

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.450 
to fool around with the game and then
after<00:01:07.080> that<00:01:07.229> they're<00:01:07.590> going<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:07.860> release<00:01:08.070> the

thinking<00:01:12.270> it<00:01:12.390> must<00:01:12.510> be<00:01:12.720> really<00:01:12.960> big<00:01:13.409> for<00:01:13.770> them

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
thinking it must be really big for them

whole<00:01:25.020> new<00:01:26.570> redesign<00:01:27.570> of<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.869> game<00:01:28.080> maybe<00:01:29.040> we

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
whole new redesign of the game maybe we

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.609 
whole new redesign of the game maybe we
might<00:01:29.400> be<00:01:29.579> able<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:29.909> travel<00:01:30.210> you<00:01:31.140> know<00:01:31.259> through
