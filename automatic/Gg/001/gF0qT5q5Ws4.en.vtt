and it worked fine and missing by me so
cook<00:04:44.479> food<00:04:44.780> is<00:04:45.110> not<00:04:45.650> as<00:04:45.710> bad<00:04:46.039> as<00:04:46.099> people<00:04:46.520> think

cook food is not as bad as people think

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:49.300 
cook food is not as bad as people think
it<00:04:46.789> is<00:04:46.910> raw<00:04:47.389> food<00:04:47.660> is<00:04:47.780> the<00:04:47.870> best<00:04:48.050> but<00:04:49.039> I<00:04:49.069> also

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
it is raw food is the best but I also

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.909

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:51.919 
did some juicing some juices but

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:54.520 
did some juicing some juices but
basically<00:04:52.130> I<00:04:53.020> had<00:04:54.020> a<00:04:54.050> learning<00:04:54.229> experience

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
basically I had a learning experience

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:56.650 
basically I had a learning experience
here<00:04:55.130> on<00:04:55.250> his<00:04:55.370> tour<00:04:55.610> I<00:04:55.639> was<00:04:55.849> traveling<00:04:56.419> it<00:04:56.570> a

here on his tour I was traveling it a

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.390 
here on his tour I was traveling it a
little<00:04:56.840> bit<00:04:57.050> more<00:04:57.620> often<00:04:58.009> than<00:04:58.130> I<00:04:58.190> would<00:04:58.370> like

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
little bit more often than I would like

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.430 
little bit more often than I would like
but<00:04:58.759> still<00:04:58.970> during<00:04:59.240> the<00:04:59.300> daytime<00:04:59.660> hours<00:04:59.690> but

loved one of the days along over from a

loved one of the days along over from a
diet<00:05:13.610> stamp<00:05:13.970> on<00:05:14.210> it<00:05:14.449> sounds<00:05:15.199> backwards<00:05:15.770> but<00:05:15.919> if

diet stamp on it sounds backwards but if

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:17.290

daylight diet successfully you can

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:21.580 
daylight diet successfully you can
probably<00:05:20.120> appreciate<00:05:20.690> what<00:05:20.840> I'm<00:05:20.930> saying<00:05:21.259> here

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:21.590 
probably appreciate what I'm saying here

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:23.649 
probably appreciate what I'm saying here
is<00:05:21.620> even<00:05:22.580> though<00:05:22.699> the<00:05:22.849> sun's<00:05:23.090> coming<00:05:23.389> down<00:05:23.419> at

00:05:23.649 --> 00:05:23.659 
is even though the sun's coming down at

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:26.020 
is even though the sun's coming down at
five<00:05:23.900> o'clock<00:05:24.050> in<00:05:24.440> a<00:05:24.530> winter<00:05:24.740> time<00:05:25.069> it's<00:05:25.370> more

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.030 
five o'clock in a winter time it's more

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:28.420 
five o'clock in a winter time it's more
easier<00:05:26.569> to<00:05:26.720> do<00:05:26.840> it<00:05:26.960> now<00:05:27.139> than<00:05:27.860> to<00:05:28.039> do<00:05:28.159> it<00:05:28.190> in<00:05:28.370> the

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:28.430 
easier to do it now than to do it in the

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:30.969 
easier to do it now than to do it in the
summertime<00:05:29.050> so<00:05:30.050> question<00:05:30.530> I<00:05:30.620> get<00:05:30.770> all<00:05:30.889> the

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:30.979 
summertime so question I get all the

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:32.649 
summertime so question I get all the
time<00:05:31.159> is<00:05:31.220> well<00:05:31.820> I<00:05:31.849> can<00:05:32.120> do<00:05:32.180> it<00:05:32.300> in<00:05:32.389> the<00:05:32.449> summer

00:05:32.649 --> 00:05:32.659 
time is well I can do it in the summer

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:33.999 
time is well I can do it in the summer
but<00:05:32.870> you<00:05:32.960> mean<00:05:33.080> I<00:05:33.110> got<00:05:33.349> to<00:05:33.440> stop<00:05:33.620> eating<00:05:33.919> at

00:05:33.999 --> 00:05:34.009 
but you mean I got to stop eating at

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:36.550 
but you mean I got to stop eating at
five<00:05:34.190> o'clock<00:05:34.340> in<00:05:34.639> the<00:05:34.669> winter<00:05:34.970> exactly<00:05:35.659> you

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.560 
five o'clock in the winter exactly you

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.279 
five o'clock in the winter exactly you
see<00:05:36.800> in<00:05:37.039> the<00:05:37.490> summertime<00:05:37.849> the<00:05:38.599> food<00:05:38.840> up<00:05:39.050> rolls

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:39.289 
see in the summertime the food up rolls

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:41.080 
see in the summertime the food up rolls
locally<00:05:39.800> which<00:05:39.979> we<00:05:40.130> should<00:05:40.310> be<00:05:40.430> eating<00:05:40.460> if<00:05:40.940> we

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.090 
locally which we should be eating if we

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:43.990 
locally which we should be eating if we
can<00:05:41.270> help<00:05:41.389> it<00:05:41.599> is<00:05:41.800> food<00:05:42.800> that<00:05:42.830> digests<00:05:43.490> pretty

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.000 
can help it is food that digests pretty

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.420 
can help it is food that digests pretty
easy<00:05:44.270> but<00:05:44.870> it's<00:05:45.020> very<00:05:45.169> light<00:05:45.469> so<00:05:46.039> we<00:05:46.159> can<00:05:46.280> eat<00:05:46.370> a

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:46.430 
easy but it's very light so we can eat a

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:48.070 
easy but it's very light so we can eat a
little<00:05:46.550> bit<00:05:46.699> longer<00:05:46.940> it's<00:05:47.270> light<00:05:47.449> outside<00:05:47.659> the

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:48.080 
little bit longer it's light outside the

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:49.659 
little bit longer it's light outside the
food's<00:05:48.320> light<00:05:48.560> if<00:05:48.770> who's<00:05:48.919> not<00:05:49.099> as<00:05:49.219> heavy<00:05:49.430> but

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:49.669 
food's light if who's not as heavy but

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:51.820 
food's light if who's not as heavy but
in<00:05:50.030> the<00:05:50.090> wintertime<00:05:50.449> the<00:05:50.930> foods<00:05:51.169> that<00:05:51.440> grow

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:51.830 
in the wintertime the foods that grow

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:53.589 
in the wintertime the foods that grow
locally<00:05:52.280> should<00:05:52.460> be<00:05:52.580> heavier<00:05:52.969> so<00:05:53.479> they

00:05:53.589 --> 00:05:53.599 
locally should be heavier so they

00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:56.680 
locally should be heavier so they
sustain<00:05:54.050> us<00:05:54.080> longer<00:05:55.000> see<00:05:56.000> y'all<00:05:56.210> created<00:05:56.599> and

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:56.690 
sustain us longer see y'all created and

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:57.999 
sustain us longer see y'all created and
make<00:05:56.780> any<00:05:56.930> mistakes<00:05:57.320> when<00:05:57.530> he<00:05:57.620> made<00:05:57.860> the

00:05:57.999 --> 00:05:58.009 
make any mistakes when he made the

00:05:58.009 --> 00:05:59.379 
make any mistakes when he made the
seasons<00:05:58.430> of<00:05:58.520> the<00:05:58.610> food<00:05:58.789> that<00:05:58.940> grows<00:05:59.090> and

00:05:59.379 --> 00:05:59.389 
seasons of the food that grows and

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:01.270 
seasons of the food that grows and
certain<00:05:59.630> areas<00:05:59.840> of<00:05:59.870> everything<00:06:00.199> else<00:06:00.349> so<00:06:00.949> the

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:01.280 
certain areas of everything else so the

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.070 
certain areas of everything else so the
food<00:06:01.490> is<00:06:01.639> heavier<00:06:01.969> so<00:06:02.240> it<00:06:02.270> sustains<00:06:02.659> us<00:06:02.780> longer

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:03.080 
food is heavier so it sustains us longer

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.920 
food is heavier so it sustains us longer
so<00:06:03.320> we<00:06:03.440> can<00:06:03.560> eat<00:06:03.650> less<00:06:03.889> and<00:06:04.789> be<00:06:05.000> better<00:06:05.210> off<00:06:05.449> you

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:05.930 
so we can eat less and be better off you

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:07.510 
so we can eat less and be better off you
see<00:06:06.110> in<00:06:06.169> the<00:06:06.259> wintertime<00:06:06.590> it's<00:06:06.979> better<00:06:07.219> to<00:06:07.400> get

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:07.520 
see in the wintertime it's better to get

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.490 
see in the wintertime it's better to get
to<00:06:07.639> sleep<00:06:07.849> earlier<00:06:08.270> because<00:06:08.810> it's<00:06:09.110> darker

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:09.500 
to sleep earlier because it's darker

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.980 
to sleep earlier because it's darker
earlier<00:06:09.789> and<00:06:10.789> we're<00:06:11.030> working<00:06:11.210> harder<00:06:11.780> and<00:06:11.810> it

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:11.990 
earlier and we're working harder and it

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:13.270 
earlier and we're working harder and it
winter<00:06:12.229> time<00:06:12.409> there's<00:06:12.620> more<00:06:12.770> stress<00:06:13.070> in<00:06:13.099> our

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:13.280 
winter time there's more stress in our

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:14.800
