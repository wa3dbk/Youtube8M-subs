00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
braid to the floral like what's the

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.050 
braid to the floral like what's the
whole<00:02:08.220> deal<00:02:08.459> with<00:02:08.610> that<00:02:09.110> for<00:02:10.110> me<00:02:10.259> personally<00:02:10.500> I

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
whole deal with that for me personally I

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.300 
whole deal with that for me personally I
like<00:02:12.060> having<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.540> power<00:02:12.750> of<00:02:13.140> the<00:02:13.410> braid<00:02:13.680> when

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
like having the power of the braid when

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.040 
like having the power of the braid when
you<00:02:14.400> make<00:02:14.550> a<00:02:14.580> really<00:02:14.849> really<00:02:14.940> long<00:02:15.330> cast<00:02:15.690> and

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
you make a really really long cast and

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.199 
you make a really really long cast and
that<00:02:16.379> fish<00:02:16.620> by<00:02:16.860> its<00:02:17.010> long<00:02:17.220> ways<00:02:17.459> out<00:02:17.640> you<00:02:18.000> set

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
that fish by its long ways out you set

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.300 
that fish by its long ways out you set
the<00:02:18.330> hook<00:02:18.540> you<00:02:18.840> got<00:02:19.050> them<00:02:19.200> that<00:02:19.620> braid<00:02:19.890> has<00:02:20.069> no

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
the hook you got them that braid has no

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.190 
the hook you got them that braid has no
stretch<00:02:20.640> and<00:02:20.879> it<00:02:21.209> allows<00:02:21.420> you<00:02:21.569> to<00:02:21.690> penetrate

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
stretch and it allows you to penetrate

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.990 
stretch and it allows you to penetrate
that<00:02:22.319> hook<00:02:22.590> really<00:02:23.010> quickly<00:02:23.489> as<00:02:23.640> those<00:02:23.790> fish

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
that hook really quickly as those fish

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.130 
that hook really quickly as those fish
are<00:02:24.120> swimming<00:02:24.239> towards<00:02:24.629> the<00:02:24.720> boat<00:02:24.870> and<00:02:24.989> that's

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
are swimming towards the boat and that's

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.020 
are swimming towards the boat and that's
key<00:02:25.440> for<00:02:25.470> me<00:02:25.770> and<00:02:25.980> then<00:02:26.520> of<00:02:26.700> course<00:02:26.879> the

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
key for me and then of course the

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.330 
key for me and then of course the
fluorocarbon<00:02:27.629> eight<00:02:28.319> pound<00:02:28.620> line<00:02:28.920> you<00:02:29.220> got

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
fluorocarbon eight pound line you got

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.750 
fluorocarbon eight pound line you got
the<00:02:29.520> stealthiness<00:02:30.950> with<00:02:31.950> the<00:02:32.040> light<00:02:32.220> line<00:02:32.459> and

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
the stealthiness with the light line and

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.699 
the stealthiness with the light line and
of<00:02:33.540> course<00:02:33.750> light<00:02:34.019> line<00:02:34.230> is<00:02:34.349> key<00:02:34.500> to<00:02:34.620> getting

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
of course light line is key to getting

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.229 
of course light line is key to getting
strikes<00:02:35.040> and<00:02:35.220> so<00:02:35.310> that<00:02:35.459> was<00:02:35.550> my<00:02:35.580> setup<00:02:36.000> for<00:02:36.120> my

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
strikes and so that was my setup for my

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:40.100 
strikes and so that was my setup for my
swimming<00:02:36.709> as<00:02:37.709> the<00:02:37.920> day<00:02:38.069> progressed<00:02:38.870> the<00:02:39.870> wind

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
swimming as the day progressed the wind

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.839 
swimming as the day progressed the wind
would<00:02:40.319> kind<00:02:40.530> of<00:02:40.590> taper<00:02:40.830> down<00:02:40.950> and<00:02:41.459> was<00:02:41.580> slicked

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
would kind of taper down and was slicked

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:44.390 
would kind of taper down and was slicked
off<00:02:42.060> and<00:02:42.360> then<00:02:43.019> I<00:02:43.379> would<00:02:43.890> do<00:02:44.099> a<00:02:44.129> similar

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
off and then I would do a similar

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.860 
off and then I would do a similar
technique<00:02:44.819> but<00:02:45.000> then<00:02:45.120> I<00:02:45.209> would<00:02:45.330> skip<00:02:45.510> a<00:02:45.629> sink

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
technique but then I would skip a sink

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.740 
technique but then I would skip a sink

it free line free float down and then
all<00:03:05.159> of<00:03:05.190> a<00:03:05.280> sudden<00:03:05.550> you<00:03:05.610> see<00:03:05.760> that<00:03:05.909> line<00:03:06.120> jerk

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
all of a sudden you see that line jerk

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:07.880 
all of a sudden you see that line jerk
and<00:03:06.599> start<00:03:06.870> taking<00:03:07.019> off<00:03:07.260> kind<00:03:07.470> of<00:03:07.560> fast<00:03:07.739> and

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
and start taking off kind of fast and

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.890 
and start taking off kind of fast and
you<00:03:08.040> know<00:03:08.159> once<00:03:08.400> took<00:03:08.610> it<00:03:08.790> and<00:03:09.000> I<00:03:09.420> caught<00:03:09.659> two

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
you know once took it and I caught two

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.399 
you know once took it and I caught two
really<00:03:10.319> good<00:03:10.440> ones<00:03:10.500> on<00:03:10.890> day<00:03:11.250> one<00:03:11.489> doing<00:03:11.909> that

00:03:12.399 --> 00:03:12.409 
really good ones on day one doing that

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:14.390 
really good ones on day one doing that
and<00:03:13.409> this<00:03:13.590> is<00:03:13.680> just<00:03:13.800> a<00:03:13.890> great<00:03:14.069> technique

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
and this is just a great technique

suspended<00:03:28.799> under<00:03:28.950> docks<00:03:29.190> were<00:03:29.340> actually

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
suspended under docks were actually

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.309 
suspended under docks were actually
spawning<00:03:29.970> and<00:03:30.269> so<00:03:30.629> I<00:03:30.659> would<00:03:30.840> throw<00:03:30.959> this<00:03:31.140> on

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319
