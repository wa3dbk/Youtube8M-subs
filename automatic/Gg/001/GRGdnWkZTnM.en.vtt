00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:12.379
 hello friends as said svetlana 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:15.019
 see that they don't let me in the head there 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:15.910
 I'll think about some kind of helmet with the inscription 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:23.539
 press 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:28.189
 so so for security so here 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:30.849
 guys work here i think which one 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:30.849
 dirty trick 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:53.570
 cut the boards stack there you already 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:58.390
 see here so the ceiling will work 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:01:10.820
 T-shirts until they get there 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:14.290
 literally without nuts and without pistol 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.290
 here he is right now this is the enemy 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:33.410
 beats and I showed you this beam comes 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:37.660
 I have already driven there 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:44.290
 here is another vertical support 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:44.290
 let's see another vertical 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:17.510
 acquires . look at the rest 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:22.400
 strictly well there will be these two 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:24.799
 holes you see there too will be me too 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:29.860
 bend the concrete a long time ago 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:29.860
 So I said that in this place will be 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.500
 the veranda will go there 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.660
 home see it go to the end of the house and 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.790
 then there will be a step that is grandees 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:44.140
 such will be enough 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.140
 this is a big 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.140
 that's all for it . 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:04.769
 almost no plywood left there 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:11.659
 wet nurse and all there cubic meters killed 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:15.870
 materials become less well we look 

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:18.290
 yeah i mean maybe others 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.290
 the boards 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:27.379
 closed suddenly saw that she was like that a 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:32.569
 others seem like just nails yet 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:44.329
 so what about 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:04:02.880
 it is interesting here there will be windows apparently there is more 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:04:05.500
 would be in front of this plywood and this window 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:09.090
 it is unclear how it might cut out for 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.090
 parts of a billion was immediately incomplete 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:21.430
 so I'm trying to present you with a trial 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:22.750
 it will all be in finished form but in 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:27.280
 general outlines 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:31.260
 outlines everything is all friends for today 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.260
 we are finishing
