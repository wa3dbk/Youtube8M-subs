00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.480
 what do you want? 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.740
 Wondering how I can come to the ship States 

00:00:10.859 --> 00:00:13.859
 you do not have a clue what 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:20.669
 our new crew members are only in it in the near future 

00:00:23.159 --> 00:00:24.310
 year 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.310
 our people who bet me 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:30.169
 Robben 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:32.810
 from the small Domhof 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:35.910
 the feeling 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.230
 clear 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.950
 before she roses 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:40.530
 completed 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.020
 but so Sirko can now managed the Challenger but not managed 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.570
 that is the question 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.440
 Efron "I do not know, I'm so uncertain towards the end 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.680
 become because I have taken a damn lot of time at some places 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.460
 and then so much has been tasted here and there 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.500
 I do not know 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.500
 maybe something scarce or just barely done 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:07.020
 No 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.100
 van Gaal can run during the dismissals so is still saying something 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:12.590
 he will be there anyway 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:13.900
 I love the playing field 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.270
 Favorite topic with 5 4 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.370
 closely followed by super with fake cheese butter mom in the game and had 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:21.300
 fallen before 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.890
 Bad Vilbel lives 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.370
 Gabe Newell 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.350
 that say it does not bother me as played out in Arxes escape 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:31.350
 finally 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.650
 Thousands of times 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.250
 I've been swinging for less than two hours I also played 4% 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.470
 on through pictures Thunder 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.470
 between two and four hours there's Lanvin for 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.570
 and I tried once on fudder percent and under two hours 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.180
 it was hard 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.320
 and I'm very close now 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.810
 is not done 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.240
 to the last memory point at which I 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.130
 before that was before the Asterix 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.130
 Wollitz has already at one hour and 50 minutes because I thought so 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.610
 what did not do damage 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.610
 well then i can only say there 

00:02:08.189 --> 00:02:10.179
 Donkey Kong is still running 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:12.279
 the Oberglatt also soon to end 

00:02:12.279 --> 00:02:15.939
 and once and for all, honestly, there is another song in the style of the genre 

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:16.959
 States 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.419
 what you can do on Molnar 

00:02:19.419 --> 00:02:22.299
 and 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:25.299
 Farmer is also a few days and until then 

00:02:26.279 --> 00:02:29.129
 Northern Swabians welcome back the two girls from the troop of 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:32.129
 Users of the young mother Wolters Reisen j 

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:34.480
 but for Demag I have no idea 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.179
 were represented 

00:02:37.179 --> 00:02:38.999
 will be implemented immediately 

00:02:38.999 --> 00:02:41.529
 Please, please please please please please please please 

00:02:41.529 --> 00:02:42.829
 undress yourself 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:44.929
 she dodged 

00:02:44.929 --> 00:02:47.929
 looks good 

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:52.419
 I did it and that in 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.189
 I had more time than expected 

00:02:55.189 --> 00:02:58.189
 as well as the 20 brown 

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:02.499
 WIP Sound 20 percent of the shops on it 

00:03:02.499 --> 00:03:04.259
 0 not 

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:07.259
 I no longer what I have more than half an hour for it 

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:17.349
 Bokel with it to disappear at the moment but sweaty for good 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:22.809
 yes, but that's the hottest 

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:25.809
 the hottest race go 

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:29.209
 that has to beautify 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.629
 Gutermann Marko to victory over Thurner 

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:33.869
 per hundredweight 

00:03:33.869 --> 00:03:35.689
 Books Panel rather harms their livestock 

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:37.229
 not over the ones 

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:40.259
 Both girls should call the food suggestions 

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:43.259
 that's easy too 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:45.219
 that was 

00:03:45.219 --> 00:03:47.099
 with the Czech Republic 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:50.099
 1 the outliers hurry for ten minutes in the open 

00:03:50.999 --> 00:03:54.279
 by the craft animal the Cell arise under two hours 

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:56.719
 and I would say 

00:03:56.719 --> 00:03:59.949
 even if I have to put some down 

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:04.669
 Do not put too much time on some others 

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:06.869
 say no problem area 

00:04:06.869 --> 00:04:10.119
 as the examiner from another provider who can pick up as well 

00:04:10.119 --> 00:04:12.959
 If I'm sure I'm needed with me but it still has good 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:14.719
 been sufficient 

00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:16.509
 but 

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:19.509
 Hoppegarten MÃ¼ller said paper 

00:04:21.749 --> 00:04:23.439
 what did that mean with funds 

00:04:23.439 --> 00:04:24.680
 See you then 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.009
 but the competition was sleeping or at 2 to Maradona percent at one 

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:29.479
 another project
