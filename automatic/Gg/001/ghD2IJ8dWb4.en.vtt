00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
LED up top now let's begin with the

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.190 
LED up top now let's begin with the
benchmarks<00:01:48.119> first<00:01:48.420> we<00:01:48.570> are<00:01:48.600> going<00:01:48.689> to<00:01:48.930> run<00:01:49.079> the

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
benchmarks first we are going to run the

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.130 
benchmarks first we are going to run the
antutu<00:01:49.619> benchmark<00:01:50.390> we<00:01:51.390> have<00:01:51.509> fast<00:01:51.720> forward<00:01:52.020> of

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
antutu benchmark we have fast forward of

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.600 
antutu benchmark we have fast forward of
the<00:01:52.170> benchmarks<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:52.920> get<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.280> final

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
the benchmarks to get to the final

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.240 
the benchmarks to get to the final
results<00:01:53.970> quickly<00:01:57.530> the<00:01:58.530> scores<00:01:58.829> i<00:01:58.979> have<00:01:59.100> no

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
results quickly the scores i have no

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.930

so<00:02:01.940> we<00:02:02.030> got<00:02:02.150> a<00:02:02.180> score<00:02:02.480> of<00:02:02.630> ten<00:02:02.840> thousand<00:02:03.230> 738

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
so we got a score of ten thousand 738

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.280 
so we got a score of ten thousand 738
which<00:02:04.880> is<00:02:05.000> actually<00:02:05.150> not<00:02:05.510> that<00:02:05.570> bad<00:02:05.810> it's

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
which is actually not that bad it's

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.980 
which is actually not that bad it's
quite<00:02:06.740> close<00:02:07.070> your<00:02:07.940> scores<00:02:08.240> of<00:02:08.450> the<00:02:08.570> micromax

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
but 512mb of ram now we are going to run

but 512mb of ram now we are going to run
the<00:02:15.170> quadrant<00:02:15.590> benchmark<00:02:20.440> let's<00:02:21.440> summit<00:02:21.800> the

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
the quadrant benchmark let's summit the

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.610 
the quadrant benchmark let's summit the
scores<00:02:22.190> to<00:02:22.370> get<00:02:22.490> a<00:02:22.520> comparison<00:02:22.850> chart<00:02:23.270> going

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
scores to get a comparison chart going

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.560 
scores to get a comparison chart going
so<00:02:24.620> we've<00:02:24.740> got<00:02:24.890> a<00:02:24.920> score<00:02:25.220> of<00:02:25.400> 3<00:02:25.670> to<00:02:25.700> 13<00:02:26.060> it's

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
so we've got a score of 3 to 13 it's

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.990 
so we've got a score of 3 to 13 it's
quite<00:02:27.500> compatible<00:02:27.920> to<00:02:28.310> the<00:02:28.370> scores<00:02:28.670> of<00:02:28.910> the

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.330 
micromax canvas fun a74 but if we talk
about<00:02:32.209> price<00:02:32.720> point<00:02:32.750> it's<00:02:33.470> quite<00:02:33.830> a<00:02:33.860> bit<00:02:34.100> lower

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
about price point it's quite a bit lower

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.449 
about price point it's quite a bit lower

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
quad-core processor now we will run the

quad-core processor now we will run the

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
graphics progress of the device and give

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.830 
graphics progress of the device and give
us<00:02:44.450> a<00:02:44.540> frame<00:02:44.780> rate<00:02:45.160> so<00:02:46.160> you<00:02:46.220> got<00:02:46.370> a<00:02:46.400> score<00:02:46.640> of

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
us a frame rate so you got a score of

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.510 
us a frame rate so you got a score of
25.7<00:02:47.840> FPS<00:02:48.230> which<00:02:48.890> is<00:02:49.010> actually<00:02:49.190> quite

25.7 FPS which is actually quite

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.090 
25.7 FPS which is actually quite

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
metal chapter of villamor it basically

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.449 
metal chapter of villamor it basically
tests<00:03:58.730> the<00:03:58.820> cpu<00:03:59.269> of<00:03:59.390> the<00:03:59.540> device<00:04:00.280> so<00:04:01.280> got<00:04:01.430> a
