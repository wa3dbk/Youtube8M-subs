00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:06.720
 Wesel 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.149
 taken picture PD with 

00:00:10.149 --> 00:00:11.239
 were 

00:00:11.239 --> 00:00:14.239
 because of the reason that's a little bit different 4 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.900
 keep your fingers straight 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.900
 and try to stay in that position 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.400
 to play chords 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.400
 the first chord in need of this exercise 

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:30.649
 is a c major chord 

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:33.649
 C major Play the pensions we the ring finger 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.570
 also the a-side in the third and fourth 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:38.910
 pay attention 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.540
 thereon 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.700
 Percent that the tree stays in the middle of the circle 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.700
 and do not go upstairs 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.230
 and 2 that they lack that of the ring finger 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.950
 not in some but outward 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.570
 the middle finger comes on the second colorful de page 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.090
 He plays with me 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:05.670
 Explain cheese in Seoul 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.000
 and households in the first and 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.770
 gripped with the index finger gives a CT 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.590
 and ten minutes should go together and make a victory 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.520
 Picture dapd 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:29.370
 and now again 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.010
 Also make sure that he does not block other pages with both fingers 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.990
 so that all five sides we need him since I'm up here 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.590
 I played with 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:44.710
 Percent 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.710
 that all sides sound the same 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.280
 Since we have morning from 4 years and their 80 we go 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.810
 in order we 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.579
 Index finger and middle finger 

00:02:08.579 --> 00:02:11.329
 also put a few pages and b-side 

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:14.329
 so there are each and West 

00:02:19.029 --> 00:02:20.739
 and green thumbs 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.159
 on the a-side 

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:26.369
 TNT post theirs and then make them straight away 

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:37.689
 the only thing that exists here is what figure 

00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:41.929
 which starts with the thumb on the a-side 

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:44.499
 the pages 

00:02:44.499 --> 00:02:46.060
 the page 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.959
 and then on the 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.959
 the page 

00:03:00.249 --> 00:03:03.039
 the second chord we need for it 

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:05.399
 is a the 7th 

00:03:05.399 --> 00:03:07.919
 but that's a bit easier 

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:10.879
 which was perhaps the first Kurd to be too difficult and the tour too 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:13.879
 grab three for the pure g7 like this 

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:16.869
 is next to 

00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:19.049
 t rapeseed 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:23.249
 the top of the second fret on the a-side, that's HR 

00:03:23.249 --> 00:03:24.450
 with the middle finger 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.450
 in the second fret on the a-side 

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:32.629
 the pages and the page remain empty 

00:03:34.619 --> 00:03:37.499
 small fingers 

00:03:37.499 --> 00:03:40.499
 attacks the Hasert in the third covenant 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:53.539
 the remaining saline swimming instructors with now I the depth of their side 

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:56.699
 not enough 

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:59.699
 on 

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:03.849
 the 16th 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:06.849
 then turn to make it full 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:31.169
 on the 9th 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:42.360
 it can work that way 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.360
 seven children like that 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:50.139
 and 18 

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:11.659
 Pay attention to it right away 

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:14.749
 mam this could play for the first time 

00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:17.370
 that affects the movement patterns 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.509
 as a whole make no 

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:21.250
 So he does not say much 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.669
 new to relocate 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:26.159
 to think about which finger 

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:27.639
 like hiking 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:30.639
 and at the same time translate all fingers 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.830
 That ensures that you will later 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:38.210
 because every step in the game does not have to take a break 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:39.750
 Flat tire liquid 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:42.900
 we want to see 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.900
 you see the meaning 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:53.650
 means 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:55.090
 that the middle finger off 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:56.819
 at the c4 

00:05:56.819 --> 00:05:59.819
 located on the it side in the second fret 

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:03.729
 migrates to the a-side in the second fret 

00:06:05.259 --> 00:06:07.469
 for life 

00:06:07.469 --> 00:06:09.499
 while the little finger 

00:06:09.499 --> 00:06:12.499
 nevertheless not playing at C major 

00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:16.009
 on the third covenant of hate old enemies 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:17.869
 that means 

00:06:17.869 --> 00:06:22.919
 all other fingers go up but only marginally from the handle soon way all the way 

00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:24.509
 only a little 

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:27.389
 and that works 

00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:30.710
 Percent then only includes middle finger and small find 

00:06:43.979 --> 00:06:46.979
 "So and because everything did me right then it sounds like that 

00:06:52.389 --> 00:06:53.259
 the young
