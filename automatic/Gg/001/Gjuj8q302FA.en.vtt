00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
they were the same at home we were never

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.230

where the fun was and so I think what

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.360 
where the fun was and so I think what
Victoria<00:02:48.170> was<00:02:48.380> saying<00:02:48.590> was<00:02:48.709> so<00:02:48.860> right<00:02:49.010> on<00:02:49.070> is

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
Victoria was saying was so right on is

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.190 
Victoria was saying was so right on is
is<00:02:49.580> that<00:02:49.820> that<00:02:49.850> example<00:02:50.450> that<00:02:50.810> said<00:02:51.050> in<00:02:51.170> the

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
is that that example that said in the

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.920 
is that that example that said in the
home<00:02:51.440> sometimes<00:02:51.980> you<00:02:52.730> know<00:02:52.850> I<00:02:53.150> just<00:02:53.540> I<00:02:53.660> really

home sometimes you know I just I really

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.420
