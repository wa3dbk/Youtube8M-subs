00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 three gates templates is not optimal 

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:08.130
 also came here 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.960
 sometimes try to call and with the 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:14.040
 nature templates nature 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:16.590
 I'm very happy with it today 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:20.240
 own stadium beat the champion 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:23.760
 is of course an extra year more 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.560
 Games are usually a great team 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.750
 and 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:31.009
 as we said today we are right 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:32.840
 fought without end and in the end the so 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:35.449
 then it can be a good one 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.050
 season but as I said it is only 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:38.180
 a game 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.610
 I do not score three more points, I have that 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.930
 said that she had the newspaper yesterday 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.540
 I said that we have that too 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:47.210
 then you lose , yes you have seen 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:50.409
 wanted to win neutral and have there 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:53.540
 we made good and meet them 

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:54.710
 that's better yet i think we are 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.519
 just do not stop with that much 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.140
 pressure gone in 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:01:00.019
 because you would have to take it yourself 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.190
 just good to lose had there has 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:02.229
 I do not think anyone will survive on us 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.369
 given 

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:05.570
 that's just that the most beautiful 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:06.380
 then you can surprise in the games 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.760
 own stadium 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.340
 I hope that it will exist and 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.630
 ignition for the company is certainly 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.119
 I am relieved , I already felt 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.799
 before and how the marmot greets daily 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:16.970
 because I always went there and we 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:19.009
 have a league defeat again 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.200
 plugged in 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:23.180
 But as I said we have hard work 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.250
 meticulously worked on these mistakes 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.140
 which we have done as I said 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.579
 everything worked out today have it good 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.840
 The team has made it easy today 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:30.710
 I did not lose that before 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.909
 they are supposed to be the spectators 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.579
 take them to play a cowboy 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:35.780
 yes and a great performance to bring 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:38.689
 play in the front and that's what she got from 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.789
 done at the beginning is so easy that it 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:43.119
 was okay at the front and too many behind 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:43.119
 error 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:48.930
 too many mistakes so six shots 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.250
 as I just learned to admit 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.840
 it is now okay 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:56.340
 away game right and have easy 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.700
 had a very bad start 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.679
 So we have a front somehow 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.170
 last moment and himself by lying on 

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:06.079
 shot right foot and got behind 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.039
 By contrast, almost 10 ball shot in 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:08.970
 I just said so 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.739
 long series probably needs 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.290
 spectacular game to finish and 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:15.510
 not with a nasty 0 1 while we are 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.600
 not here today the headmistress recently 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.130
 We are even happy that we have a great club 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.900
 as well as that they found the track 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.630
 has a passion anyway 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.280
 imagination but for us today you have to 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.900
 say is annoying so right 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.730
 annoying and equal to do a series 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.720
 or if the question comes up 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.190
 point distances to others 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.459
 football teams should stand out for 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.930
 us because I just want that 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.660
 we in a situation like this today 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.440
 It was different than playing 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.420
 ans stop 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:46.140
 renÃ© eagle has held up well 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:48.780
 a lot of time i also heard 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.239
 that somehow we shoot 25,620 shots 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.079
 Tor had a lot to lose 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:54.000
 I think we did that well 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:56.280
 have the opportunities were played out 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.579
 also banal alone before goal and exactly 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:02.420
 losing so because we really him 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:02.420
 the chances of being
