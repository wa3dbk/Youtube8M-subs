00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
it just dies quickly but um it's not

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.010 
it just dies quickly but um it's not
really<00:02:02.780> putting<00:02:03.259> it<00:02:03.440> the<00:02:03.530> same<00:02:03.710> just<00:02:03.950> consists

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
really putting it the same just consists

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.660 
really putting it the same just consists
consistency<00:02:06.020> as<00:02:06.229> it<00:02:06.409> used<00:02:06.619> to<00:02:06.740> like<00:02:07.520> when<00:02:07.610> i

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
consistency as it used to like when i

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.810 
consistency as it used to like when i
first<00:02:07.909> got<00:02:08.119> it<00:02:08.239> like<00:02:08.950> that's<00:02:09.950> just<00:02:10.250> one<00:02:10.459> swipe

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:10.820 
first got it like that's just one swipe

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.750 
first got it like that's just one swipe
there<00:02:11.440> so<00:02:12.440> you<00:02:12.530> have<00:02:12.680> to<00:02:12.830> go<00:02:12.920> over<00:02:13.430> it<00:02:13.550> like

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
there so you have to go over it like

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:21.039 
there so you have to go over it like
once<00:02:14.090> or<00:02:14.239> twice<00:02:15.100> to<00:02:16.100> actually<00:02:16.580> get<00:02:16.790> good<00:02:20.049> light

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:21.049 
once or twice to actually get good light

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:23.660 
once or twice to actually get good light
right<00:02:21.470> there

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.440 

hmm<00:02:25.980> and<00:02:26.980> then<00:02:27.190> like<00:02:27.340> as<00:02:27.550> you<00:02:27.730> use<00:02:27.760> it<00:02:27.940> the<00:02:28.090> tips

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
hmm and then like as you use it the tips

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.990 
hmm and then like as you use it the tips
are<00:02:28.690> stiff<00:02:28.959> like<00:02:29.230> fea<00:02:30.190> Sh<00:02:30.640> it<00:02:31.300> starts<00:02:31.720> to<00:02:31.840> like

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
are stiff like fea Sh it starts to like

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.100 
are stiff like fea Sh it starts to like
come<00:02:34.000> apart<00:02:34.360> but<00:02:34.540> I<00:02:34.599> think<00:02:34.870> that's<00:02:35.019> just

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
come apart but I think that's just

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.640 
come apart but I think that's just
because<00:02:35.349> it's<00:02:35.860> getting<00:02:36.730> old<00:02:37.440> it's<00:02:38.440> not<00:02:38.560> really

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
because it's getting old it's not really

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.890 
because it's getting old it's not really
old<00:02:38.920> it's<00:02:39.040> phone<00:02:39.250> like<00:02:39.430> I'm<00:02:39.580> month<00:02:39.790> old<00:02:40.000> so<00:02:40.840> I'm

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
old it's phone like I'm month old so I'm

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.119 
old it's phone like I'm month old so I'm

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.020 

ma'am<00:03:17.960> it<00:03:18.230> stays<00:03:18.830> there<00:03:19.190> like<00:03:19.430> all<00:03:19.670> day

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.470 
ma'am it stays there like all day
because<00:03:21.020> it's<00:03:21.200> really<00:03:21.920> good<00:03:22.250> like<00:03:22.520> see<00:03:23.330> if<00:03:23.390> I

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
because it's really good like see if I

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.820 
because it's really good like see if I
can<00:03:23.630> I<00:03:24.190> get<00:03:25.190> blends<00:03:25.670> if<00:03:25.880> you<00:03:26.030> rub<00:03:26.360> it<00:03:26.830> but

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:27.830 
can I get blends if you rub it but

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.060 
can I get blends if you rub it but
that's<00:03:27.950> also<00:03:28.190> because<00:03:28.580> this<00:03:28.880> one<00:03:29.090> was<00:03:29.210> wet<00:03:29.540> so

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
that's also because this one was wet so

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.700 
that's also because this one was wet so
if<00:03:31.070> you<00:03:31.160> go<00:03:31.250> to<00:03:31.310> one<00:03:31.550> that<00:03:31.640> I<00:03:31.700> did<00:03:31.880> earlier<00:03:32.710> well

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:33.710 
if you go to one that I did earlier well

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:37.630 
if you go to one that I did earlier well
still<00:03:33.980> blends<00:03:34.900> like<00:03:35.900> it<00:03:36.020> still<00:03:36.230> smears<00:03:36.950> but

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
still blends like it still smears but

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.960 
still blends like it still smears but
it's<00:03:37.850> not<00:03:38.120> nearly<00:03:39.020> as<00:03:39.230> bad<00:03:39.470> as<00:03:39.620> something<00:03:39.980> and

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
it's not nearly as bad as something and

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.090 
it's not nearly as bad as something and
then<00:03:41.300> there's<00:03:41.540> another<00:03:41.800> eyeliner<00:03:42.800> that<00:03:42.890> I

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
then there's another eyeliner that I

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:58.270 
then there's another eyeliner that I
have<00:03:55.180> and<00:03:56.180> it's<00:03:56.270> it's<00:03:56.720> by<00:03:56.930> the<00:03:56.989> same<00:03:57.080> brand<00:03:57.770> so

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.990 
like brown black so i don't know if that
but<00:04:44.120> didn't<00:04:44.479> really<00:04:44.950> but<00:04:45.950> like<00:04:46.010> you<00:04:46.550> did<00:04:46.880> like

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
but didn't really but like you did like

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.350 
but didn't really but like you did like
twist<00:04:47.390> it<00:04:47.750> to<00:04:48.140> get<00:04:48.290> out<00:04:48.530> and<00:04:49.030> then<00:04:50.030> once<00:04:50.240> you

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
twist it to get out and then once you

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.090 
twist it to get out and then once you
get<00:04:50.600> it<00:04:50.720> out<00:04:50.840> it<00:04:51.050> looks<00:04:51.290> like<00:04:51.380> that<00:04:51.710> so<00:04:51.979> it's

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:52.100 
get it out it looks like that so it's

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:58.630 
get it out it looks like that so it's
like<00:04:52.250> really<00:04:52.430> clumpy<00:04:53.000> messy<00:04:56.590> and<00:04:57.590> then<00:04:57.770> the

00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:58.640 
like really clumpy messy and then the

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.750 
like really clumpy messy and then the
line<00:04:58.880> doesn't<00:04:59.530> like<00:05:00.530> it<00:05:00.680> gets<00:05:00.860> clumpy<00:05:01.310> and

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:01.760 
line doesn't like it gets clumpy and

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.120 
line doesn't like it gets clumpy and
then<00:05:02.720> like<00:05:02.900> this<00:05:03.050> one<00:05:03.229> if<00:05:03.350> you<00:05:03.470> get<00:05:03.890> on<00:05:04.100> your
