so<00:00:38.550> therefore<00:00:38.879> we<00:00:39.000> we<00:00:39.420> don't<00:00:39.629> really<00:00:39.719> have<00:00:39.930> any

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
so therefore we we don't really have any

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.410 
so therefore we we don't really have any
sky<00:00:40.559> although<00:00:41.460> there<00:00:41.670> might<00:00:41.760> be<00:00:41.879> a<00:00:42.000> little<00:00:42.149> bit

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
booming through and we are making it up

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.770 
booming through and we are making it up
as<00:00:44.550> we<00:00:44.579> go<00:00:44.760> along<00:00:45.289> so<00:00:46.289> that's<00:00:46.440> our<00:00:46.680> background

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
as we go along so that's our background

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.360
