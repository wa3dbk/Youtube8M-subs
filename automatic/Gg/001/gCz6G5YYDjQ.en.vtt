00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
have to tie these in and train them just

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.560 
have to tie these in and train them just
looking<00:03:15.050> at<00:03:15.170> my<00:03:15.260> black<00:03:15.560> currants<00:03:16.130> here<00:03:16.570> that's

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
looking at my black currants here that's

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.979 
looking at my black currants here that's
a<00:03:17.660> lot<00:03:17.930> that's<00:03:18.860> all<00:03:19.010> ready<00:03:19.340> for<00:03:19.489> picking<00:03:20.060> but

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
a lot that's all ready for picking but

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:23.920 
a lot that's all ready for picking but
there's<00:03:21.170> a<00:03:21.230> lot<00:03:21.410> that<00:03:21.440> aren't<00:03:22.040> quite<00:03:22.900> so<00:03:23.900> I

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
there's a lot that aren't quite so I

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.650 
there's a lot that aren't quite so I
reckon<00:03:24.350> in<00:03:24.470> another<00:03:25.030> four<00:03:26.030> or<00:03:26.060> five<00:03:26.209> days

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
reckon in another four or five days

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.560 
reckon in another four or five days
before<00:03:26.989> I<00:03:27.170> pick<00:03:27.410> these<00:03:28.180> as<00:03:29.180> far<00:03:29.360> as<00:03:29.480> the

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 
before I pick these as far as the

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:31.090 
before I pick these as far as the
blueberries<00:03:29.989> are<00:03:30.110> concerned<00:03:30.530> the<00:03:30.709> plant<00:03:30.950> on

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
blueberries are concerned the plant on

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:32.979 
blueberries are concerned the plant on
the<00:03:31.220> left<00:03:31.459> has<00:03:31.700> already<00:03:32.000> finished<00:03:32.239> fruiting

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 
the left has already finished fruiting

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:35.140 
the left has already finished fruiting
and<00:03:33.079> I've<00:03:33.230> had<00:03:33.410> some<00:03:33.680> blueberries<00:03:34.130> offer<00:03:34.310> but

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
and I've had some blueberries offer but

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:36.490 
and I've had some blueberries offer but
you<00:03:35.299> can<00:03:35.450> see<00:03:35.690> it's<00:03:35.900> already<00:03:36.049> gone<00:03:36.320> into

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
you can see it's already gone into

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.310 
you can see it's already gone into
autumn<00:03:37.010> mode<00:03:37.510> whereas<00:03:38.510> the<00:03:38.630> one<00:03:38.780> on<00:03:38.900> the<00:03:39.049> right

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:39.320 
autumn mode whereas the one on the right

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.650 
autumn mode whereas the one on the right
well<00:03:39.980> it<00:03:40.100> still<00:03:40.340> has<00:03:40.549> some<00:03:40.579> developing<00:03:41.329> fruit

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
well it still has some developing fruit

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:42.280 
well it still has some developing fruit
on<00:03:41.900> it

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
on it

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.770 
on it
I<00:03:42.320> think<00:03:43.130> the<00:03:43.280> dry<00:03:43.549> conditions<00:03:44.209> are<00:03:44.390> making<00:03:44.660> it

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
I think the dry conditions are making it

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.949 
I think the dry conditions are making it
very<00:03:44.959> hard<00:03:45.110> for<00:03:45.500> these<00:03:45.739> blueberries<00:03:46.340> a

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
very hard for these blueberries a

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:49.750 
very hard for these blueberries a
strawberry<00:03:47.959> just<00:03:48.290> about<00:03:48.650> finished<00:03:49.190> fruiting

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
strawberry just about finished fruiting

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.620 
strawberry just about finished fruiting
so<00:03:50.540> I<00:03:50.600> might<00:03:50.840> as<00:03:50.959> well<00:03:51.110> take<00:03:51.320> the<00:03:51.500> nettle

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
so I might as well take the nettle

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:56.890 
so I might as well take the nettle
that's<00:03:54.040> one<00:03:55.040> decent<00:03:55.579> crop<00:03:56.090> of<00:03:56.299> strawberries

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
that's one decent crop of strawberries

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.280 
that's one decent crop of strawberries
of<00:03:57.049> these<00:03:57.850> but<00:03:58.850> I<00:03:58.880> think<00:03:59.180> they<00:03:59.329> were<00:03:59.390> hit<00:03:59.989> quite

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
of these but I think they were hit quite

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.610 
of these but I think they were hit quite
hard<00:04:00.350> by<00:04:01.160> the<00:04:01.220> late<00:04:01.519> snow<00:04:02.500> but<00:04:03.500> they're

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
hard by the late snow but they're

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.470 
hard by the late snow but they're
looking<00:04:03.709> healthy<00:04:04.250> enough<00:04:04.870> so<00:04:05.870> next<00:04:06.860> year<00:04:07.480> he's

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
looking healthy enough so next year he's

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.300 
looking healthy enough so next year he's
hoping<00:04:08.810> I<00:04:08.930> get<00:04:09.079> some<00:04:09.260> wrong

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
hoping I get some wrong

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:18.849 
hoping I get some wrong
oh<00:04:12.920> I<00:04:13.920> can<00:04:14.190> keep<00:04:14.400> this<00:04:14.610> net<00:04:14.849> for<00:04:15.030> next<00:04:15.300> year<00:04:15.450> now

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:18.859 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:21.319 

one<00:04:19.859> of<00:04:19.889> the<00:04:20.070> many<00:04:20.340> challenges<00:04:20.639> I'm<00:04:21.060> having

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
one of the many challenges I'm having

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:23.540

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
that all this continued spell of dry hot

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.440

weather<00:04:23.820> is<00:04:24.360> keeping<00:04:24.960> the<00:04:25.080> plants<00:04:25.500> watered

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450 
weather is keeping the plants watered

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:28.909

make<00:04:54.960> my<00:04:55.169> own<00:04:55.200> tamales<00:04:56.100> don't<00:04:56.970> take<00:04:57.720> away<00:04:58.970> the

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400 
make my own tamales don't take away the

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:06.260 
make my own tamales don't take away the
music<00:05:02.419> nope<00:05:03.419> that's<00:05:03.810> too<00:05:04.080> far<00:05:04.260> is<00:05:04.530> tamales<00:05:05.280> but

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
music nope that's too far is tamales but

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.800 
music nope that's too far is tamales but
Mexican<00:05:06.780> food<00:05:07.050> wrapped<00:05:07.440> in<00:05:07.620> corn<00:05:07.919> leaves<00:05:08.810> John

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:09.810 
Mexican food wrapped in corn leaves John

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.170 
Mexican food wrapped in corn leaves John
and<00:05:10.050> John<00:05:10.350> Michaels<00:05:10.860> yet<00:05:11.040> and<00:05:11.250> squash<00:05:11.639> get<00:05:12.150> a

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 
and John Michaels yet and squash get a

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:16.219 
and John Michaels yet and squash get a
daily<00:05:12.660> water<00:05:12.930> as<00:05:13.290> well<00:05:13.639> and<00:05:14.639> I<00:05:14.760> think<00:05:14.790> I<00:05:15.570> might

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:16.229 
daily water as well and I think I might

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:19.000 
daily water as well and I think I might
be<00:05:16.740> having<00:05:16.919> some<00:05:17.190> pumpkins<00:05:17.760> this<00:05:17.970> year<00:05:18.030> I

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:19.010 
be having some pumpkins this year I

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:21.920 
be having some pumpkins this year I
think<00:05:20.010> Anita<00:05:20.400> weed<00:05:20.610> might<00:05:20.940> be<00:05:21.180> true<00:05:21.450> though<00:05:21.690> so

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:21.930 
think Anita weed might be true though so

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:26.719 
think Anita weed might be true though so
I<00:05:21.960> can<00:05:22.050> see<00:05:22.440> it<00:05:22.590> better<00:05:23.690> it's<00:05:24.690> better<00:05:24.780> I<00:05:25.729> can

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:26.729 
I can see it better it's better I can

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:29.480 
I can see it better it's better I can
see<00:05:26.910> what's<00:05:27.090> going<00:05:27.510> on<00:05:27.660> now<00:05:28.039> which<00:05:29.039> means<00:05:29.250> I'd

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:29.490 
see what's going on now which means I'd

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:32.870 
see what's going on now which means I'd
give<00:05:29.700> them<00:05:29.820> a<00:05:29.940> good<00:05:30.090> watering<00:05:31.789> watering<00:05:32.789> the

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:32.880 
give them a good watering watering the

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.690 
give them a good watering watering the
things<00:05:33.150> outside<00:05:33.390> isn't<00:05:34.289> so<00:05:34.500> bad<00:05:34.830> and<00:05:35.280> once<00:05:35.550> a

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:35.700 
things outside isn't so bad and once a

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.029 
things outside isn't so bad and once a
day<00:05:35.729> you<00:05:36.210> kind<00:05:36.390> of<00:05:36.479> get<00:05:36.630> into<00:05:36.780> a<00:05:36.870> routine<00:05:37.110> but

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:38.039 
day you kind of get into a routine but

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:40.129 
day you kind of get into a routine but
where<00:05:38.220> I<00:05:38.250> have<00:05:38.460> real<00:05:38.820> challenges<00:05:39.510> is<00:05:39.870> in<00:05:40.020> the

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:40.139 
where I have real challenges is in the

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:42.409 
where I have real challenges is in the
greenhouse<00:05:40.620> but<00:05:41.090> don't<00:05:42.090> think<00:05:42.300> this

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:42.419 
greenhouse but don't think this

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:44.360 
greenhouse but don't think this
greenhouse<00:05:42.840> doors<00:05:43.229> been<00:05:43.500> shut<00:05:43.860> for<00:05:43.889> the<00:05:44.130> past

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:44.370 
greenhouse doors been shut for the past

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:45.110 
greenhouse doors been shut for the past
two<00:05:44.639> weeks

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 
two weeks

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.450 
two weeks
but<00:05:45.330> even<00:05:45.810> so<00:05:46.050> during<00:05:46.530> the<00:05:46.650> day<00:05:46.830> can<00:05:47.070> get<00:05:47.190> up<00:05:47.340> to

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.460 
but even so during the day can get up to

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.270 
but even so during the day can get up to
40<00:05:47.910> degrees<00:05:48.030> in<00:05:48.630> here<00:05:48.930> I<00:05:49.139> need<00:05:49.830> to<00:05:49.979> real

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:50.280 
40 degrees in here I need to real

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.040 
40 degrees in here I need to real
challenge<00:05:50.910> keeping<00:05:51.180> these<00:05:51.539> plants

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.050 
challenge keeping these plants

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:53.990 
challenge keeping these plants
particularly<00:05:52.590> the<00:05:52.830> tomatoes<00:05:53.400> adequately

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 
particularly the tomatoes adequately

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.870 
particularly the tomatoes adequately
hydrated<00:05:54.470> I've<00:05:55.470> lost<00:05:55.680> a<00:05:55.889> few<00:05:56.130> Tomatoes<00:05:56.700> to

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:56.880 
hydrated I've lost a few Tomatoes to

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.610 
hydrated I've lost a few Tomatoes to
blossom<00:05:57.150> end<00:05:57.510> rot<00:05:57.690> where<00:05:58.080> there's<00:05:58.260> not<00:05:58.410> enough

00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:58.620 
blossom end rot where there's not enough

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:00.860 
blossom end rot where there's not enough
calcium<00:05:59.000> getting<00:06:00.000> up<00:06:00.150> to<00:06:00.300> the<00:06:00.419> flower<00:06:00.660> at<00:06:00.840> the

calcium getting up to the flower at the

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:03.140 
calcium getting up to the flower at the
time<00:06:01.139> of<00:06:01.289> pollination<00:06:01.740> what<00:06:02.610> that<00:06:02.760> means<00:06:03.000> is

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:03.150 
time of pollination what that means is

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:04.700 
time of pollination what that means is
he's<00:06:03.270> not<00:06:03.419> getting<00:06:03.690> enough<00:06:03.870> water<00:06:03.900> basically

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:04.710 
he's not getting enough water basically

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:07.550 
he's not getting enough water basically
what<00:06:05.639> I've<00:06:05.760> been<00:06:05.910> doing<00:06:06.330> is<00:06:06.990> pulling<00:06:07.260> these

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:07.560 
what I've been doing is pulling these

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.279 
what I've been doing is pulling these
off<00:06:07.770> I<00:06:08.300> don't<00:06:09.300> love<00:06:09.419> the<00:06:09.570> plant<00:06:09.810> by<00:06:10.020> putting

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:10.289 
off I don't love the plant by putting

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:13.070 
off I don't love the plant by putting
energy<00:06:10.440> into<00:06:11.010> creating<00:06:11.310> fruit<00:06:12.030> but<00:06:12.870> I'm<00:06:12.960> not

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:13.080 
energy into creating fruit but I'm not

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.420 
energy into creating fruit but I'm not
going<00:06:13.260> to<00:06:13.320> be<00:06:13.410> able<00:06:13.470> to<00:06:13.680> eat<00:06:13.800> anyway<00:06:14.220> because

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:14.430 
going to be able to eat anyway because

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:17.150 
going to be able to eat anyway because
it<00:06:14.639> just<00:06:14.910> ends<00:06:15.120> up<00:06:15.210> with<00:06:15.330> a<00:06:15.360> rotten<00:06:15.750> bottom<00:06:16.160> so

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:17.160 
it just ends up with a rotten bottom so

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.730 
it just ends up with a rotten bottom so
at<00:06:17.250> the<00:06:17.400> moment<00:06:17.550> I'm<00:06:17.940> in<00:06:17.970> here<00:06:18.389> twice<00:06:19.260> a<00:06:19.320> day

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:19.740 
at the moment I'm in here twice a day

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:21.640 
at the moment I'm in here twice a day
sometimes<00:06:20.430> three<00:06:20.760> times

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:21.650 
sometimes three times

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:25.650 
sometimes three times
day<00:06:22.150> giving<00:06:23.150> these<00:06:23.330> a<00:06:23.360> good<00:06:23.800> soaking<00:06:24.800> of<00:06:24.919> water

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:25.660 
day giving these a good soaking of water

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:29.070 
day giving these a good soaking of water
because<00:06:26.660> they<00:06:26.810> really<00:06:27.229> need<00:06:27.259> it<00:06:27.650> in<00:06:27.830> this<00:06:27.979> heat

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:29.080 
because they really need it in this heat

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:30.939 
because they really need it in this heat
but<00:06:30.080> to<00:06:30.229> come<00:06:30.380> out<00:06:30.500> of<00:06:30.650> the<00:06:30.710> greenhouse

00:06:30.939 --> 00:06:30.949 
but to come out of the greenhouse

00:06:30.949 --> 00:06:33.730 
but to come out of the greenhouse
because<00:06:31.220> it's<00:06:31.430> absolutely<00:06:32.150> sweltering<00:06:32.740> since
