00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:58.370 
color or you can set patterns to it like

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.430 
color or you can set patterns to it like
blinking<00:01:58.700> flashing<00:01:59.090> then<00:01:59.720> small<00:01:59.990> maybe<00:02:00.230> even

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
blinking flashing then small maybe even

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.250 
blinking flashing then small maybe even
random<00:02:00.680> color<00:02:00.860> so<00:02:01.130> on<00:02:01.190> and<00:02:01.310> so<00:02:01.370> forth<00:02:01.780> okay

choose<00:02:13.910> from<00:02:14.120> there's<00:02:14.300> a<00:02:14.360> physical<00:02:14.540> amplifier

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
choose from there's a physical amplifier

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:16.390 
choose from there's a physical amplifier
and<00:02:15.380> it<00:02:15.500> will<00:02:15.590> increase<00:02:15.770> the<00:02:15.950> output<00:02:16.040> to<00:02:16.280> your

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
and it will increase the output to your

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.700

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
with so that pretty much sums it up for

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:55.960 
with so that pretty much sums it up for
the<00:02:54.800> Titan<00:02:55.010> we<00:02:55.190> also<00:02:55.310> be<00:02:55.490> doing<00:02:55.610> some<00:02:55.670> gaming

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.530 
the Titan we also be doing some gaming
videos<00:02:57.880> so<00:02:58.880> now<00:02:58.910> we're<00:02:59.120> going<00:02:59.209> to<00:02:59.270> do<00:02:59.390> some

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
videos so now we're going to do some

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.060 
videos so now we're going to do some
gaming<00:02:59.720> benchmarks<00:02:59.930> of<00:03:00.380> the<00:03:00.470> aftershock<00:03:00.770> item

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
gaming benchmarks of the aftershock item

gaming benchmarks of the aftershock item
v2<00:03:01.400> with<00:03:01.880> two<00:03:02.090> ATMs<00:03:02.510> in<00:03:02.840> SLI<00:03:03.230> and<00:03:03.440> we<00:03:04.040> have<00:03:04.160> this

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
v2 with two ATMs in SLI and we have this

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.930 
v2 with two ATMs in SLI and we have this
running<00:03:04.870> bffe<00:03:05.870> for<00:03:06.080> at<00:03:06.620> 1080p<00:03:07.040> at<00:03:07.400> Ultra

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
running bffe for at 1080p at Ultra

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.150 
running bffe for at 1080p at Ultra
settings<00:03:08.090> as<00:03:08.300> you<00:03:08.360> can<00:03:08.510> see

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.150 

and<00:03:12.200> basically<00:03:13.200> we're<00:03:13.830> getting<00:03:13.890> really

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
and basically we're getting really

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.950 
and basically we're getting really
really<00:03:14.370> good<00:03:14.460> pyramids<00:03:14.910> actually<00:03:15.750> getting

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:15.960 
really good pyramids actually getting

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:21.490 
really good pyramids actually getting
dreams<00:03:16.170> in<00:03:16.320> the<00:03:16.440> range<00:03:16.740> of

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.960 

money<00:03:22.500> gives<00:03:22.680> on<00:03:22.769> the<00:03:22.829> market<00:03:23.129> as<00:03:23.579> you<00:03:23.640> can<00:03:23.819> see

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
money gives on the market as you can see

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:56.690 
money gives on the market as you can see
the<00:03:24.230> perimeter

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.430 

so<00:03:57.700> we<00:03:57.760> actually<00:03:58.030> see<00:03:58.210> an<00:03:58.600> FPS<00:03:59.020> increase<00:03:59.290> of

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
so we actually see an FPS increase of

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.160 
so we actually see an FPS increase of
more<00:03:59.560> than<00:03:59.620> 50%<00:04:00.090> from<00:04:01.090> a<00:04:01.270> single<00:04:01.570> ad<00:04:01.810> which<00:04:02.140> is

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
more than 50% from a single ad which is

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:43.050 
more than 50% from a single ad which is
phenomenal<00:04:02.650> for<00:04:03.040> adolescent<00:04:03.700> up

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.120
