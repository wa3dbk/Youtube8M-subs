00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690 
by Joel on that one then overall the

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:46.870 
by Joel on that one then overall the
lapses<00:04:45.110> aren't<00:04:45.380> a<00:04:45.440> huge<00:04:45.800> buzz<00:04:46.130> kill<00:04:46.460> because

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 
lapses aren't a huge buzz kill because

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.240 
lapses aren't a huge buzz kill because
he<00:04:47.090> still<00:04:47.360> has<00:04:47.690> no<00:04:47.930> experience<00:04:48.440> so<00:04:48.890> the<00:04:49.040> real

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
he still has no experience so the real

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.070 
he still has no experience so the real
question<00:04:49.340> is<00:04:49.790> this<00:04:49.940> how<00:04:50.120> fast<00:04:50.450> can<00:04:50.660> he<00:04:50.720> learn

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 
question is this how fast can he learn

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.640 
question is this how fast can he learn
and<00:04:52.030> right<00:04:53.030> here<00:04:53.060> this<00:04:53.600> is<00:04:53.660> after<00:04:54.020> he<00:04:54.320> got<00:04:54.500> his

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:54.650
