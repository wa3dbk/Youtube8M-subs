00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.719

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.130
 the initiative 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.820
 we started doing some 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:41.940
 sick thanks anyway have a 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:45.329
 technical mastery ok it's all right 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.879
 the course instead of a new 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.739
 classic to open the unclassified patient 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.980
 small opening the advantages of 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.680
 seti of course hold the lp of sight sick 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.820
 only economical first because 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.980
 does not require much time 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.590
 of hospitalization only ammonia alopecia areata 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:05.729
 but the same day volunteers be the 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.080
 evening the same day after 6 o'clock he can 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.700
 reach home 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.080
 so it usually takes a job 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.159
 of equipped surgery all that can not 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.600
 work a night surgeon 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.210
 the facilitator can not exercise 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.030
 so it takes a job to equip it 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.460
 what we will find here we had 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.560
 a few months and a few months sometimes 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.909
 that we had to hang so it's for this 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.490
 reason we stayed we spent our 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:30.689
 civil service and we stayed 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:33.180
 still stay long here hospital de 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.520
 80 beds for a population of 40 thousand 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.350
 locals the facility hosts 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.770
 also the patients of the localities 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:43.110
 while still presenting a 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:47.100
 missing a specialized doctor 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.680
 if all the building she so a little bit 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.720
 rare who told me 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.720
 kim has the nose floch 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:02:03.210
 interniste six lists and especially in this 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.520
 concerning the rights of the sick 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.190
 we try to argue its 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.070
 claims including asking 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.800
 the assignment of certain specialty 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:16.440
 for beauty hospital rips such 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.440
 that cardiology and surgery 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.510
 infant atfal among pathologies 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.000
 the most prevalent in this commune and 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:28.020
 daÃ¯ra located southwest of bayonne on 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.930
 has identified 2 in particular it's mostly 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:33.750
 the pressure the bone we find a lot of 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.420
 hospitalized cases with us or 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.940
 hospitalization for a few days in 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.290
 evolution gives improvement and so 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.140
 a healing 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.660
 we also find among the diseases the 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.730
 more frequent at home is dedicated to 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.670
 diabetes is diabetes cases 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.320
 an imbalance and especially the summer 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.530
 and the bites of scorpions that are 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:58.370
 quite common but there is a very good 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.370
 supported
