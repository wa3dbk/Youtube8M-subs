00:04:02.429 --> 00:04:02.439 
that again we're in two and three F is

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:07.170 
that again we're in two and three F is
the<00:04:02.620> rhythm<00:04:02.769> I'm<00:04:04.260> 3m<00:04:05.310> comes<00:04:06.310> to<00:04:06.549> all<00:04:06.730> four

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
the rhythm I'm 3m comes to all four

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:19.080 
the rhythm I'm 3m comes to all four
measures<00:04:07.599> ready<00:04:08.290> go

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.390 

okay<00:04:20.290> now<00:04:21.290> we're<00:04:21.410> going<00:04:21.500> to<00:04:21.590> go<00:04:21.709> to<00:04:21.739> an<00:04:22.010> E<00:04:22.190> minor

one measure put this one and then play
that<00:06:10.400> okay<00:06:11.400> let's<00:06:12.030> look<00:06:12.120> at<00:06:12.240> the<00:06:12.300> next<00:06:12.420> measure

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:15.200 

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:19.100 

that's<00:06:16.200> going<00:06:16.350> to<00:06:16.410> be<00:06:16.500> F<00:06:16.740> and<00:06:17.100> C<00:06:17.130> together<00:06:18.110> and

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:19.110 
that's going to be F and C together and

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:23.450 
that's going to be F and C together and
to<00:06:19.350> an<00:06:19.470> A<00:06:19.560> and<00:06:20.150> then<00:06:21.150> down<00:06:21.360> to<00:06:21.510> an<00:06:21.630> effort<00:06:22.460> left

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:23.460 
to an A and then down to an effort left

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:26.330 
to an A and then down to an effort left
hands<00:06:23.700> on<00:06:23.850> the<00:06:23.940> feet<00:06:24.150> below<00:06:24.510> middle<00:06:24.960> C<00:06:25.200> then<00:06:26.190> up

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:26.340 
hands on the feet below middle C then up

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:29.210 
hands on the feet below middle C then up
to<00:06:26.490> an<00:06:26.610> egg<00:06:26.760> up<00:06:27.060> to<00:06:27.510> a<00:06:27.540> seat<00:06:27.840> and<00:06:28.080> back<00:06:28.740> down<00:06:28.980> to

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:29.220 
to an egg up to a seat and back down to

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:33.050 
to an egg up to a seat and back down to
a<00:06:30.590> bar<00:06:31.590> some<00:06:32.100> hands<00:06:32.280> together<00:06:32.490> on<00:06:32.880> that

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:33.060 
a bar some hands together on that

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:36.150 
a bar some hands together on that
measure

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:36.160 

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.360 

yep

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:39.370 

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:40.950 

i'm<00:06:39.639> going<00:06:39.820> to<00:06:39.940> start<00:06:40.180> back<00:06:40.510> here<00:06:40.540> and<00:06:40.900> then

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:40.960 
i'm going to start back here and then

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.480 
i'm going to start back here and then
right<00:06:41.229> there<00:06:41.440> and<00:06:41.530> play<00:06:41.680> three<00:06:41.949> measures<00:06:42.280> for

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:42.490 
right there and play three measures for

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:51.810 
right there and play three measures for
you<00:06:42.639> ready<00:06:43.360> and<00:06:43.630> go

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:51.820 

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:55.110 

one<00:06:52.630> more<00:06:52.870> measure<00:06:53.110> in<00:06:53.350> this<00:06:53.470> free<00:06:53.680> part<00:06:53.950> 1<00:06:54.130> ACF

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:55.120 
one more measure in this free part 1 ACF

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:59.310 
one more measure in this free part 1 ACF
on<00:06:55.300> the<00:06:55.390> right<00:06:55.570> hand<00:06:56.850> and<00:06:57.850> another<00:06:57.970> effort<00:06:58.450> and

00:06:59.310 --> 00:06:59.320 
on the right hand and another effort and

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:02.820 
on the right hand and another effort and
then<00:06:59.530> B<00:06:59.770> and<00:06:59.920> G<00:07:00.100> together<00:07:01.440> lefty<00:07:02.440> is<00:07:02.560> going<00:07:02.770> to

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:02.830 
then B and G together lefty is going to

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:07.410 
then B and G together lefty is going to
play<00:07:02.980> a<00:07:03.010> low<00:07:03.310> G<00:07:03.640> up<00:07:04.420> to<00:07:04.660> F<00:07:04.780> up<00:07:05.530> today<00:07:06.150> back<00:07:07.150> down

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:07.420 
play a low G up to F up today back down

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:15.950 
play a low G up to F up today back down
to<00:07:07.660> F<00:07:08.040> and<00:07:09.040> then<00:07:09.280> the<00:07:09.580> logic

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:15.960 

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:21.149 

so<00:07:16.960> plans<00:07:17.139> together<00:07:17.530> here<00:07:19.949> so<00:07:20.949> there's

00:07:21.149 --> 00:07:21.159 
so plans together here so there's

00:07:21.159 --> 00:07:23.300 
so plans together here so there's
something<00:07:21.580> going<00:07:21.849> on<00:07:22.000> eighth<00:07:22.360> note<00:07:22.720> wise

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:23.310 
something going on eighth note wise

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:29.119 
something going on eighth note wise
throughout<00:07:24.310> and<00:07:24.610> then<00:07:24.699> measure<00:07:24.909> one<00:07:25.270> and<00:07:25.509> two

00:07:29.119 --> 00:07:29.129 

00:07:29.129 --> 00:07:32.430 

let's<00:07:30.129> start<00:07:30.250> right<00:07:30.580> here<00:07:30.639> and<00:07:31.150> put<00:07:32.110> that<00:07:32.259> all

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:32.440 
let's start right here and put that all

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:42.420 
let's start right here and put that all
together

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:42.430 

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:45.399 

okay<00:07:43.430> the<00:07:43.879> verse<00:07:44.029> starts<00:07:44.270> here<00:07:44.629> I<00:07:44.809> hope<00:07:45.259> you
