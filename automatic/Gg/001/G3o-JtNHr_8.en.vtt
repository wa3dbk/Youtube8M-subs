00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
facing outwards so we always know what

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.249 
facing outwards so we always know what
we<00:01:50.070> have<00:01:50.220> on<00:01:50.399> hand<00:01:50.640> before<00:01:51.479> we<00:01:52.049> had<00:01:52.229> a

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
different system and it never worked I

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.789 
different system and it never worked I
always<00:01:54.509> ended<00:01:54.869> up<00:01:55.020> with<00:01:55.200> like<00:01:55.350> two<00:01:55.590> or<00:01:55.770> three

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
always ended up with like two or three

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.010 
always ended up with like two or three
of<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.369> same<00:01:56.549> kind<00:01:56.790> of<00:01:56.969> spices<00:01:57.210> or<00:01:57.630> I'd<00:01:57.780> be<00:01:57.930> at
