it's<00:02:40.900> always<00:02:41.379> impossible

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:08.680 

so<00:03:03.320> the<00:03:03.650> selection<00:03:04.040> page<00:03:04.790> design<00:03:07.510> this<00:03:08.510> is

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
so the selection page design this is

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.970 
so the selection page design this is
