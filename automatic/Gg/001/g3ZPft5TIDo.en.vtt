00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:51.660 
just a quick test okay so this one is
just<00:02:49.600> little<00:02:50.440> quicker<00:02:50.740> it's<00:02:51.280> probably

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
just little quicker it's probably

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.650 
just little quicker it's probably
because<00:02:51.880> the<00:02:52.330> battery<00:02:52.630> maybe<00:02:52.920> I<00:02:54.000> don't<00:02:55.000> drain

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
because the battery maybe I don't drain

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.170 
because the battery maybe I don't drain
the<00:02:55.840> little<00:02:56.140> anyway<00:02:57.130> now<00:02:57.400> I'm<00:02:57.610> now<00:02:57.850> going<00:02:58.090> to

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
the little anyway now I'm now going to

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:06.150 
the little anyway now I'm now going to
plug<00:02:58.480> the<00:02:59.610> pixel<00:03:00.610> TD<00:03:01.270> 380<00:03:01.750> to<00:03:02.410> that<00:03:02.980> one<00:03:05.160> the

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
plug the pixel TD 380 to that one the

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.550 
plug the pixel TD 380 to that one the
way<00:03:06.370> you<00:03:06.430> plug<00:03:06.760> it<00:03:06.910> is<00:03:07.150> you<00:03:08.020> plug<00:03:08.200> it<00:03:08.350> at<00:03:08.470> the

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
way you plug it is you plug it at the

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.530 
way you plug it is you plug it at the
front<00:03:08.770> here<00:03:09.010> as<00:03:09.310> you<00:03:09.910> can<00:03:09.940> see<00:03:10.090> you<00:03:10.360> have<00:03:10.510> a

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
front here as you can see you have a

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.520 
front here as you can see you have a
little<00:03:10.630> socket<00:03:11.110> here<00:03:11.440> and<00:03:12.060> this<00:03:13.060> will<00:03:13.530> just

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
little socket here and this will just

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:20.190 
little socket here and this will just
fit<00:03:14.860> like<00:03:15.250> that<00:03:17.100> so<00:03:18.100> very<00:03:18.610> simple<00:03:19.120> there<00:03:19.810> is<00:03:19.930> no

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
fit like that so very simple there is no

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.490 
fit like that so very simple there is no
button<00:03:20.950> to<00:03:21.160> turn<00:03:21.459> on<00:03:21.640> or<00:03:22.060> off<00:03:22.270> on<00:03:22.870> the<00:03:23.050> pixel

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
button to turn on or off on the pixel

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:31.770 
button to turn on or off on the pixel
and<00:03:24.340> what<00:03:24.850> you<00:03:25.000> will<00:03:25.180> get<00:03:25.540> is<00:03:30.570> what<00:03:31.570> you<00:03:31.660> would

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
and what you will get is what you would

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:37.110 
and what you will get is what you would
get<00:03:31.959> is<00:03:32.230> a<00:03:32.620> couple<00:03:33.070> of<00:03:33.160> lights<00:03:33.310> will<00:03:33.850> come<00:03:36.120> when

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
get is a couple of lights will come when

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.710 
get is a couple of lights will come when
it<00:03:37.299> is<00:03:37.810> the<00:03:37.959> battery<00:03:38.080> to<00:03:38.440> go<00:03:38.700> to<00:03:39.700> the<00:03:39.820> flash<00:03:40.090> so

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
it is the battery to go to the flash so

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.890 
it is the battery to go to the flash so
let<00:03:41.049> me<00:03:41.110> just<00:03:41.260> do<00:03:41.440> a<00:03:41.650> test<00:03:42.340> so<00:03:43.120> same<00:03:43.360> power<00:03:43.540> full

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
let me just do a test so same power full

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:50.130 
let me just do a test so same power full
power<00:03:44.140> here<00:03:45.930> okay<00:03:46.930> is<00:03:47.140> back<00:03:47.790> so<00:03:49.140> extremely

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
power here okay is back so extremely

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.229 
power here okay is back so extremely
quick<00:03:50.410> so<00:03:50.709> let's<00:03:51.040> do<00:03:51.190> a<00:03:51.250> few<00:03:51.640> tests<00:03:51.910> and<00:03:52.120> tell

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
exactly how many photos you can check

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.440 
exactly how many photos you can check
using<00:04:38.860> it<00:04:39.130> because<00:04:39.310> another<00:04:39.790> money<00:04:40.090> kind<00:04:40.389> of

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:40.450 
using it because another money kind of

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:46.200 
using it because another money kind of
charge<00:04:41.110> after<00:04:41.470> each<00:04:42.150> each<00:04:43.150> photo<00:04:43.540> shoot<00:04:44.880> but<00:04:45.880> I

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 
charge after each each photo shoot but I

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.920 
charge after each each photo shoot but I
mean<00:04:46.540> it<00:04:47.290> lasts<00:04:47.710> two<00:04:47.860> quite<00:04:48.100> a<00:04:48.130> while<00:04:48.600> you<00:04:49.600> have

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930

a compartment inside with eight patratu

00:04:53.919 --> 00:05:00.690 
a compartment inside with eight patratu
normally<00:04:54.310> use<00:04:54.580> eight<00:04:55.410> energizer<00:04:57.120> 2050<00:04:59.490> now<00:05:00.490> I

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:00.700 
normally use eight energizer 2050 now I

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.580 
normally use eight energizer 2050 now I
had<00:05:00.880> a<00:05:00.940> question<00:05:01.090> about<00:05:01.330> the<00:05:01.690> the<00:05:02.110> quality<00:05:02.560> of

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
had a question about the the quality of

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:06.930 
had a question about the the quality of
