00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.490
 espasa kids I'm bought the 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.230
 new friends for new ones can 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.959
 have to be very careful because 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.789
 I was hoping this lemon to the leaves 

00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:14.650
 here then imagine good parenteral for 

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:17.050
 divide them and then pass them to the big one 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.539
 as you see here another sulcata more 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.429
 big that the one that had 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:23.859
 if you want to escape from the rock you see that 

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:25.359
 he does not like that place but I do not think 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:26.550
 that you get to move because there is the 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:29.400
 sand 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.189
 it's going to be difficult to move around 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.220
 sand the anemone as you see is very 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.129
 I'd like to remove it from there but 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:40.290
 well the increase is going to stay there 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:42.600
 then here you can see a cute bubble 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.640
 colored water or as I like to call it 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.079
 the lemonade of the tits is still a 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.989
 little closed because he just arrived is 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.519
 very very big and as you can see it is 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.199
 Precious is one of the most anemones 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:54.340
 pretty there are and clowns do 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.290
 symbiosis with her 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.270
 above we have there is a soft corral 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.580
 that looks like a broccoli is a bit 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:03.790
 sad now for the trip we'll see 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:05.379
 tomorrow how it opens since we are here 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.330
 let's see also the other the tomato 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.979
 they fixed the big ones that are there and what 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:12.750
 beautiful is after having given 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:12.750
 so three or four mussels 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.600
 this is how it is still in the period 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.100
 of adaptation today I'm not going to give you 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.860
 eat these anemones will feed him 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:23.590
 within three days a thing like that 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.570
 I will give you a mussel ct a curious thing 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.120
 where I see the prawn the prawn touches 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.130
 hello I'm tasting and a little more islands 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.650
 located the prawn is eaten less badly than 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.510
 the prawn has been a little deft 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.870
 he has managed to escape by donate 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:39.700
 with the antennas and today as it has happened 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.560
 but that I also never like to have it 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.880
 here because clowns like rice and 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.610
 the problem is that when they sleep 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.340
 clowns are floating down the bottom and 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:51.420
 It can be dangerous and then here as 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:54.509
 to finish the job one I remembered 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.400
 it's pretty pretty it's still a little 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.460
 shy will open a little more 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:02.270
 ahead 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.650
 and we have to zoom in with the 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.370
 mouth 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.690
 we will reproduce it 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.119
 it's still good enough 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.410
 full this aquarium I'm filling the 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.830
 truth that in the end is going to petar 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.290
 things 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.640
 curious, this is curious, the coral 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.620
 this one that was made a mess 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.630
 it's still a mess but 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.100
 eye is recovering I 've never seen 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.870
 it's a recovery of a coral 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.580
 but this apparently is 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.730
 recovering 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:33.670
 weird things the other not the other so 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.380
 you can see that he has little but good 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.080
 we will leave it there 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:41.680
 hopefully you can throw a part of 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:43.300
 he does not know and the grass the first I've 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.850
 put up here will be closed 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.230
 cleaned the wall a little bit because what 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.330
 I want to fill the wall with 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.760
 they saw what is the lawn in the coral 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.290
 this lawn the truth that would be very 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.420
 pretty the back full of this 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.940
 coral does not happen as you see now is 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.710
 closed because nothing will open then as 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.069
 better within a day or two days when 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:04.260
 I will appear 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:06.220
 but I'm telling you, this is what's left 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.530
 pretty cool 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.940
 when it divides the anemones I'm going to 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.990
 take some big because you're 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.880
 Anemones are not very aggressive 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:16.440
 and they are very difficult to find besides 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.500
 quite expensive, so it has come well 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.720
 the power to get them 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:24.100
 to make a general plan for you to see 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.100
 how the aquarium goes 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.040
 the truth is pretty cool 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.790
 and tomorrow we will see all displayed upload 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:36.620
 a video 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.849
 let's hope that all the clowns follow 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.980
 I say the blue here is the idea is 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:41.410
 put it in the sum of the big aquarium 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.530
 big 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:46.240
 but we'll see how the record is already 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.620
 I do not want to be fiddling too much 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.560
 but I do not want to keep 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:53.690
 much the sub letter below is not going to be 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.850
 that some clown in the end ends up inside 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.040
 well nothing good guys I will teach the 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:00.490
 esqueje missed is tiny says it's 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.620
 perfect 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:04.600
 and little by little if you see and eventually with the 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.250
 line also goes through here colonizing a 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.500
 bit of rocks to see if I get the same 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:11.680
 color that in the big one I do not think that 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.269
 take longer to expand 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.340
 Well, there you have the truth that it's a 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:18.720
 taste in which he is already he will be marin 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.720
 it's pretty beautiful 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:23.680
 Well nothing guys, hello to all
