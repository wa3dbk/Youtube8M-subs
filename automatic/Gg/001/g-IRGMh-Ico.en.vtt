 You always change as possible sideways because if he has this hurdle 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.560
 otherwise 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.740

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.880
 Peter Ratchuk had to be treated that way 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.560

 "He is not someone 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.710
 this would have supported Schulz 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.470
 and if I'm not sure 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.490
 the planner wants to meet next one to five 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.670

 to give the Campbell puts a bit 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:47.549
 but I know how about my percent hit rate of 

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:54.289
 and Silvio Heinevetter is made without a hitch and my team know 

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:57.549
 to support 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:00.909
 when the tunnel is often underestimated 

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:02.830
 actually very useful finish 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:04.659
 percent 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:07.969
 because you could also take it as three only you have to think 

00:04:07.969 --> 00:04:10.519
 most of the dead were 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:13.589
 it is also the area but well 

00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:15.219
 still go 

00:04:15.219 --> 00:04:17.849

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:33.409
 are really it contained 

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:35.889
 and how many points you never get 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:38.460
 Percent goes like that or fly 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:45.970
 Thus, compared to others, the judge is less than 30 grams 38 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.970
 Chairman of the German ring and already taken over

 Prémat 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:04.040
 then you went and that's why not APA and it went into the grain 

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.210
 nevertheless correct 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:06.789
 the weekend 

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:09.039
 Zossen cash flow impact 

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:12.039

 2 in our life are playing off 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.900
 and set it right in the pedigrees

 Goldstone of what could interest them he was now approaching 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.909
 in the expired 

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:30.020
 Percentage points so 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:31.979
 must be replaced

 it is called 0 30 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:57.330
 Team does not condemn the extreme » 

00:05:57.879 --> 00:06:01.439
 The structural change is very often that they do not lie or year 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.360
 the Graz 30 that is not so Fr 

00:06:06.969 --> 00:06:10.430
 Of course he does not have we are heroes and Swiss TXT and 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:12.029
 percent 

00:06:12.029 --> 00:06:15.039
 took on his chair 

00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:17.360
 and could die 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.360
 And one thing I feel almost over him 

00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:24.469
 not much is missing 

00:06:28.119 --> 00:06:31.469

00:06:38.729 --> 00:06:41.520
 affected just happened that way 

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:44.639
 the outskirts formally cheer up 

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:47.789
 these places ready 

00:06:47.789 --> 00:06:50.169
 Hanau 

00:06:50.169 --> 00:06:51.830
 that's it too 

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:55.819
