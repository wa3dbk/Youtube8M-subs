00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
but this idea that chance could play

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.350 
but this idea that chance could play
that<00:03:48.950> one<00:03:49.130> did<00:03:49.340> not<00:03:49.370> have<00:03:49.580> to<00:03:49.940> rigidly

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
that one did not have to rigidly

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.510 
that one did not have to rigidly
organize<00:03:50.990> anything<00:03:51.560> was<00:03:52.040> immensely

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:52.520 
organize anything was immensely

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.070 
organize anything was immensely
appealing<00:03:53.060> for<00:03:53.240> him<00:03:53.360> and<00:03:53.540> it<00:03:53.600> was<00:03:53.720> like<00:03:53.930> it

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 
appealing for him and it was like it

00:03:54.080 --> 00:04:00.450 
appealing for him and it was like it
opened<00:03:54.500> a<00:03:54.680> window<00:03:55.430> in<00:03:55.580> his<00:03:55.730> brain

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:00.460 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:04.270 

yuuta<00:04:01.460> suave<00:04:01.730> ski<00:04:01.970> had<00:04:02.150> this<00:04:02.270> idea<00:04:03.040> that<00:04:04.040> you

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
yuuta suave ski had this idea that you

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.640 
yuuta suave ski had this idea that you
could<00:04:04.490> create<00:04:04.790> great<00:04:05.390> layers<00:04:06.050> of<00:04:06.410> very

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
could create great layers of very

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.760 
could create great layers of very
sophisticated<00:04:07.300> complexity<00:04:08.300> by<00:04:08.960> not<00:04:09.260> telling

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:09.770 
sophisticated complexity by not telling

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:11.380 
sophisticated complexity by not telling
people<00:04:09.800> exactly<00:04:10.250> where<00:04:10.880> they<00:04:11.060> were<00:04:11.150> going<00:04:11.300> to

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:11.390 
people exactly where they were going to

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:28.190 
people exactly where they were going to
play

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:28.200 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.450 

now<00:04:29.200> this<00:04:29.320> is<00:04:29.410> actually<00:04:29.500> very<00:04:29.740> difficult<00:04:30.070> for

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
now this is actually very difficult for

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.100 
now this is actually very difficult for
orchestral<00:04:30.970> musicians<00:04:31.120> because<00:04:31.750> we<00:04:31.840> spent

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
orchestral musicians because we spent

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.020 
orchestral musicians because we spent
our<00:04:32.230> whole<00:04:32.470> life<00:04:32.770> being<00:04:33.070> told<00:04:33.280> you<00:04:33.460> must<00:04:33.760> play

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
our whole life being told you must play

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.630 
our whole life being told you must play
exactly<00:04:34.270> this<00:04:34.990> there<00:04:35.410> the<00:04:36.070> idea<00:04:36.190> of<00:04:36.460> being

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:36.640 
exactly this there the idea of being

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.610 
exactly this there the idea of being
together<00:04:37.090> with<00:04:37.330> another<00:04:37.540> musician<00:04:38.140> is

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:38.620 
together with another musician is

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.070 
together with another musician is
something<00:04:39.160> we<00:04:39.310> imbibe<00:04:39.640> with<00:04:40.090> our<00:04:40.750> mother's

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
something we imbibe with our mother's

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.610 
something we imbibe with our mother's
milk

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
milk

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.710 
milk
so<00:04:42.190> actually<00:04:42.520> four<00:04:42.820> musicians<00:04:43.000> coming<00:04:43.540> to

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:43.720 
so actually four musicians coming to

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.720 
so actually four musicians coming to
loot<00:04:43.840> us<00:04:43.990> Walski<00:04:44.380> the<00:04:44.500> first<00:04:44.740> time<00:04:45.010> it's<00:04:45.430> quite

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:45.730 
loot us Walski the first time it's quite

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:48.000 
loot us Walski the first time it's quite
hard<00:04:46.030> because<00:04:46.870> instead<00:04:47.410> of<00:04:47.470> this<00:04:47.650> sound<00:04:47.920> of

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.010 
hard because instead of this sound of

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:49.980 
hard because instead of this sound of
something<00:04:48.190> going<00:04:48.460> crunch<00:04:48.910> there's<00:04:49.480> often<00:04:49.810> the

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 
something going crunch there's often the

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:51.630 
something going crunch there's often the
sound<00:04:50.230> of<00:04:50.380> a<00:04:50.440> lot<00:04:50.530> of<00:04:50.650> change<00:04:50.980> falling<00:04:51.490> out<00:04:51.610> of

to<00:07:25.940> remember<00:07:26.060> this<00:07:26.330> was<00:07:26.389> in<00:07:26.660> the<00:07:26.750> early<00:07:27.020> 80s

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:27.050 
to remember this was in the early 80s

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:28.930 
to remember this was in the early 80s
and<00:07:27.380> the<00:07:27.650> time<00:07:27.830> of<00:07:27.860> year<00:07:28.070> assault<00:07:28.580> ski<00:07:28.820> and

and the time of year assault ski and
martial<00:07:29.360> law<00:07:30.010> and<00:07:31.010> this<00:07:33.039> very<00:07:34.039> soft-spoken

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:34.460 
martial law and this very soft-spoken

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:38.290 
martial law and this very soft-spoken
man<00:07:35.620> suddenly<00:07:36.620> became<00:07:37.070> very<00:07:37.520> forceful<00:07:38.180> and

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:38.300 
man suddenly became very forceful and

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:41.279 
man suddenly became very forceful and
was<00:07:38.479> saying<00:07:38.750> how<00:07:38.900> he<00:07:39.169> just<00:07:39.710> things<00:07:39.979> about<00:07:40.460> the

00:07:41.279 --> 00:07:41.289

00:07:41.289 --> 00:07:44.589 
was saying how he just things about the
politicians<00:07:42.289> and<00:07:42.590> indeed<00:07:42.940> other<00:07:43.940> composers

00:07:44.589 --> 00:07:44.599 
politicians and indeed other composers

00:07:44.599 --> 00:07:47.170 
politicians and indeed other composers
of<00:07:44.630> his<00:07:44.810> time<00:07:45.080> who<00:07:45.260> he<00:07:45.380> felt<00:07:45.620> were<00:07:46.030> servile<00:07:47.030> and

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:47.180 
of his time who he felt were servile and

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:51.279 
of his time who he felt were servile and
lackeys<00:07:47.660> and<00:07:48.039> I<00:07:49.039> started<00:07:49.610> looking<00:07:50.030> around<00:07:50.300> in

00:07:51.279 --> 00:07:51.289 
lackeys and I started looking around in

00:07:51.289 --> 00:07:53.950 
lackeys and I started looking around in
case<00:07:51.500> this<00:07:51.710> was<00:07:51.979> being<00:07:52.190> recorded<00:07:52.669> in<00:07:53.240> any<00:07:53.720> way

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:53.960 
case this was being recorded in any way

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:56.290 
case this was being recorded in any way
that<00:07:54.320> in<00:07:54.740> fact<00:07:54.979> he<00:07:55.099> had<00:07:55.250> none<00:07:55.490> of<00:07:55.520> the<00:07:55.760> paranoia

00:07:56.290 --> 00:07:56.300 
that in fact he had none of the paranoia

00:07:56.300 --> 00:08:01.779 
that in fact he had none of the paranoia
of<00:07:56.840> the<00:07:57.830> rest<00:07:58.010> of<00:07:58.190> us<00:07:58.310> and<00:07:59.830> he<00:08:00.830> again<00:08:01.220> he<00:08:01.520> always

00:08:01.779 --> 00:08:01.789 
of the rest of us and he again he always

00:08:01.789 --> 00:08:05.969 
of the rest of us and he again he always
somehow<00:08:02.419> managed<00:08:03.110> to<00:08:03.260> follow<00:08:03.470> his<00:08:03.710> own<00:08:03.889> course

00:08:05.969 --> 00:08:05.979 
somehow managed to follow his own course

00:08:05.979 --> 00:08:08.650 
somehow managed to follow his own course
