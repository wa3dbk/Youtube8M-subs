7 so I'm going to call this a C 9 sharp

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:44.290 
7 so I'm going to call this a C 9 sharp
5<00:02:39.370> here<00:02:40.370> is<00:02:40.690> the<00:02:41.690> root<00:02:41.870> ok<00:02:42.830> and<00:02:43.250> so<00:02:43.910> we're<00:02:44.060> still

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
5 here is the root ok and so we're still

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.420 
5 here is the root ok and so we're still
see<00:02:44.630> dominant<00:02:45.140> chords<00:02:45.440> here<00:02:45.650> let's<00:02:46.130> move<00:02:46.310> it

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
see dominant chords here let's move it

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.310 
see dominant chords here let's move it
up<00:02:46.490> again<00:02:46.820> now<00:02:47.080> we<00:02:48.080> have<00:02:48.410> flat<00:02:48.950> 7<00:02:49.430> 3<00:02:50.000> flat<00:02:50.690> 5<00:02:50.720> and

up again now we have flat 7 3 flat 5 and

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.480 
up again now we have flat 7 3 flat 5 and
root<00:02:51.800> so<00:02:52.280> we're<00:02:52.430> back<00:02:52.550> to<00:02:52.610> a<00:02:52.760> c7<00:02:53.360> flat<00:02:53.540> 5<00:02:53.930> again

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:54.490 
root so we're back to a c7 flat 5 again

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:56.560 
root so we're back to a c7 flat 5 again
I'm<00:02:55.490> going<00:02:55.670> to<00:02:55.730> move<00:02:55.820> it<00:02:56.000> up<00:02:56.060> another<00:02:56.360> whole

I'm going to move it up another whole

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.979 
I'm going to move it up another whole
step<00:02:57.190> now<00:02:58.190> I've<00:02:58.340> got<00:02:58.520> the<00:02:58.670> roots<00:02:58.970> I've<00:02:59.630> got<00:02:59.870> the

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989 
step now I've got the roots I've got the

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:02.530 
step now I've got the roots I've got the
flat<00:03:00.260> 5<00:03:00.560> I've<00:03:00.920> got<00:03:01.340> the<00:03:01.459> sharp<00:03:01.760> 5<00:03:02.060> but<00:03:02.420> we'll

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
flat 5 I've got the sharp 5 but we'll

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.440 
flat 5 I've got the sharp 5 but we'll
call<00:03:02.720> it<00:03:02.870> flat<00:03:03.140> 13<00:03:03.620> and<00:03:03.920> the<00:03:04.340> 9<00:03:04.550> so<00:03:05.090> once<00:03:05.300> again

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
call it flat 13 and the 9 so once again

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.910 
call it flat 13 and the 9 so once again
I<00:03:05.840> have<00:03:06.050> AC<00:03:06.520> dominant<00:03:07.630> with<00:03:08.630> a<00:03:08.750> flat<00:03:08.959> 5<00:03:09.200> &amp;<00:03:09.530> a

time<00:03:26.600> a<00:03:26.840> whole<00:03:27.110> step<00:03:27.380> we're<00:03:27.709> back<00:03:27.920> to<00:03:28.100> the

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
time a whole step we're back to the

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.120 
time a whole step we're back to the
original<00:03:28.310> chord<00:03:29.209> the<00:03:29.570> C<00:03:29.600> 7<00:03:30.080> flat<00:03:30.320> 5<00:03:30.350> an<00:03:30.830> octave

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
original chord the C 7 flat 5 an octave

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:33.340 
original chord the C 7 flat 5 an octave
higher<00:03:31.160> than<00:03:32.120> this

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
higher than this

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.040 
higher than this
okay<00:03:33.650> now<00:03:34.340> it's<00:03:34.790> very<00:03:35.150> useful<00:03:35.540> for<00:03:35.570> a<00:03:35.780> lot<00:03:35.840> of

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.050 
okay now it's very useful for a lot of

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:38.470 
okay now it's very useful for a lot of
reasons<00:03:36.380> so<00:03:36.950> now<00:03:37.070> some<00:03:37.700> people<00:03:37.820> think<00:03:38.180> well

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
reasons so now some people think well

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.600 
reasons so now some people think well
okay<00:03:38.840> this<00:03:38.960> is<00:03:39.080> theoretically<00:03:39.650> correct<00:03:39.920> but

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610 
okay this is theoretically correct but

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:42.670 
okay this is theoretically correct but
does<00:03:40.760> it<00:03:40.910> sound<00:03:41.210> good<00:03:41.390> yes<00:03:42.110> they<00:03:42.350> sound<00:03:42.590> really

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
does it sound good yes they sound really

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.320 
does it sound good yes they sound really
good<00:03:42.920> actually

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.330 
good actually

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.480 
good actually
if<00:03:44.510> I<00:03:44.690> considered<00:03:45.530> each<00:03:45.710> one<00:03:45.920> of<00:03:46.010> these<00:03:46.070> chords

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:46.490 
if I considered each one of these chords

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:47.620 
if I considered each one of these chords
a<00:03:46.610> five<00:03:46.970> chord

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 
a five chord

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.630 
a five chord
meaning<00:03:47.900> the<00:03:47.990> five<00:03:48.200> chord<00:03:48.560> in<00:03:48.740> the<00:03:48.830> key<00:03:48.860> of<00:03:49.040> F<00:03:49.370> I

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
meaning the five chord in the key of F I

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.910 
meaning the five chord in the key of F I
could<00:03:50.180> use<00:03:50.390> these<00:03:50.600> four<00:03:51.110> two<00:03:51.560> five<00:03:51.710> one

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
could use these four two five one

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.710 
could use these four two five one
progressions<00:03:52.490> so<00:03:52.910> I'll<00:03:53.030> use<00:03:53.210> each<00:03:53.390> one<00:03:53.420> of

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
progressions so I'll use each one of

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:54.940 
progressions so I'll use each one of
them<00:03:53.840> here<00:03:53.990> for<00:03:54.200> you<00:03:54.320> to<00:03:54.410> show<00:03:54.590> you<00:03:54.650> what<00:03:54.830> they

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
them here for you to show you what they

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:56.470 
them here for you to show you what they
look<00:03:55.100> like<00:03:55.160> and<00:03:55.490> what<00:03:55.550> they<00:03:55.760> sound<00:03:56.000> like

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
look like and what they sound like

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.580 
look like and what they sound like
so<00:03:56.930> the<00:03:57.170> two<00:03:57.320> chord<00:03:57.620> and<00:03:57.800> F<00:03:58.010> is<00:03:58.280> G<00:03:58.670> minor<00:03:58.880> 7<00:03:59.590> is

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
so the two chord and F is G minor 7 is

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.830 
so the two chord and F is G minor 7 is
Mike<00:04:00.740> -<00:04:00.950> here's<00:04:01.760> my<00:04:01.940> five<00:04:02.210> and<00:04:03.220> here's<00:04:04.220> my<00:04:04.460> one

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.230 
Mike - here's my five and here's my one

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:08.240 
F major six okay so that sounds good

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:12.370 
F major six okay so that sounds good
okay<00:04:10.420> now<00:04:11.420> I'm<00:04:11.660> going<00:04:11.750> to<00:04:11.840> take<00:04:11.990> that<00:04:12.140> five

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:02.639 
okay so that was okay and if I go one

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:08.149 
okay so that was okay and if I go one
more<00:05:02.879> here<00:05:03.150> I<00:05:03.419> can<00:05:03.870> go<00:05:04.020> to<00:05:05.539> five

00:05:08.149 --> 00:05:08.159 
more here I can go to five

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:10.790 
more here I can go to five
okay<00:05:09.029> so<00:05:09.330> it's<00:05:09.419> quite<00:05:09.569> useful<00:05:09.629> now<00:05:10.409> is<00:05:10.589> one

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
okay so it's quite useful now is one

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.919 
okay so it's quite useful now is one
more<00:05:10.919> thing<00:05:11.159> you<00:05:11.309> want<00:05:11.489> to<00:05:11.580> think<00:05:11.669> about<00:05:12.089> and

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:12.929 
more thing you want to think about and

00:05:12.929 --> 00:05:16.369 
more thing you want to think about and
that<00:05:13.110> is<00:05:13.169> in<00:05:14.069> any<00:05:14.309> of<00:05:14.429> these<00:05:14.639> cords<00:05:15.239> any<00:05:16.050> of<00:05:16.259> the

00:05:16.369 --> 00:05:16.379 
that is in any of these cords any of the

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:18.439 
that is in any of these cords any of the
notes<00:05:16.589> in<00:05:16.800> the<00:05:16.830> chord<00:05:17.129> can<00:05:17.459> be<00:05:17.729> considered<00:05:18.269> the

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:18.449 
notes in the chord can be considered the

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:20.749 
notes in the chord can be considered the
root<00:05:18.689> and<00:05:19.159> then<00:05:20.159> guess<00:05:20.399> what

00:05:20.749 --> 00:05:20.759 
root and then guess what

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:23.119 
root and then guess what
they<00:05:20.969> become<00:05:21.389> other<00:05:21.659> ultra<00:05:22.319> dominant<00:05:22.800> chords

00:05:23.119 --> 00:05:23.129 
they become other ultra dominant chords

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:25.929 
they become other ultra dominant chords
and<00:05:23.249> you<00:05:23.639> can<00:05:23.789> move<00:05:23.969> those<00:05:24.300> around<00:05:24.599> again<00:05:25.529> in

00:05:25.929 --> 00:05:25.939 
and you can move those around again in

00:05:25.939 --> 00:05:28.879 
and you can move those around again in
whole<00:05:26.939> steps<00:05:27.209> so<00:05:27.839> this<00:05:28.169> time<00:05:28.439> I'm<00:05:28.679> going<00:05:28.830> to

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:28.889 
whole steps so this time I'm going to

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:29.389 
whole steps so this time I'm going to
stay

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:29.399 
stay

00:05:29.399 --> 00:05:31.969 
stay
using<00:05:30.179> this<00:05:30.300> shape<00:05:30.599> right<00:05:30.629> here<00:05:30.899> see<00:05:31.709> seven

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:31.979 
using this shape right here see seven

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:33.829 
using this shape right here see seven
five<00:05:32.159> five<00:05:32.339> but<00:05:32.909> I'm<00:05:32.999> going<00:05:33.179> to<00:05:33.239> consider<00:05:33.599> the

00:05:33.829 --> 00:05:33.839 
five five but I'm going to consider the

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:36.229 
five five but I'm going to consider the
b-flat<00:05:34.289> the<00:05:34.679> root<00:05:34.830> this<00:05:35.039> time<00:05:35.309> so<00:05:35.849> this<00:05:36.059> puts

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:36.239 
b-flat the root this time so this puts

00:05:36.239 --> 00:05:38.809 
b-flat the root this time so this puts
me<00:05:36.389> in<00:05:36.599> the<00:05:36.689> key<00:05:36.839> of<00:05:36.869> E<00:05:37.199> flat<00:05:37.459> that's<00:05:38.459> the<00:05:38.580> five

00:05:38.809 --> 00:05:38.819 
me in the key of E flat that's the five

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:42.199 
me in the key of E flat that's the five
chord<00:05:39.209> in<00:05:39.809> E<00:05:39.899> flat<00:05:40.019> so<00:05:40.979> my<00:05:41.099> 2<00:05:41.159> chord<00:05:41.580> is<00:05:41.789> f<00:05:41.969> minor

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:42.209 
chord in E flat so my 2 chord is f minor

00:05:42.209 --> 00:05:48.499 
chord in E flat so my 2 chord is f minor
7<00:05:42.659> and<00:05:43.369> here's<00:05:44.369> my<00:05:44.610> five<00:05:44.909> and<00:05:45.619> then<00:05:46.619> one<00:05:47.240> B<00:05:48.240> flat

00:05:48.499 --> 00:05:48.509 
7 and here's my five and then one B flat

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:51.320 
7 and here's my five and then one B flat
okay<00:05:49.469> now<00:05:50.159> I'm<00:05:50.279> going<00:05:50.399> to<00:05:50.490> take<00:05:50.669> the<00:05:50.819> E<00:05:50.849> and

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:51.330 
okay now I'm going to take the E and

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.199 
okay now I'm going to take the E and
consider<00:05:51.869> that<00:05:52.139> the<00:05:52.409> root<00:05:52.589> now<00:05:53.159> E<00:05:53.459> is<00:05:53.789> the<00:05:54.029> five

00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:54.209 
consider that the root now E is the five

00:05:54.209 --> 00:05:56.899 
consider that the root now E is the five
chord<00:05:54.539> in<00:05:54.659> the<00:05:54.749> key<00:05:54.779> of<00:05:54.899> a<00:05:55.139> so<00:05:55.649> a<00:05:56.129> two<00:05:56.369> five<00:05:56.610> one

00:05:56.899 --> 00:05:56.909 
chord in the key of a so a two five one

00:05:56.909 --> 00:06:00.949 
chord in the key of a so a two five one
and<00:05:56.969> that<00:05:57.389> key<00:05:57.659> would<00:05:57.839> be<00:05:58.019> B<00:05:58.469> minor<00:05:58.709> 7<00:05:59.539> and<00:06:00.539> then

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:00.959 
and that key would be B minor 7 and then

00:06:00.959 --> 00:06:05.180 
and that key would be B minor 7 and then
our<00:06:01.079> five<00:06:02.029> predominant<00:06:03.089> and<00:06:03.509> then<00:06:03.809> a

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:05.190 
our five predominant and then a

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:07.670 
our five predominant and then a
sounded<00:06:05.580> pretty<00:06:05.730> good<00:06:05.970> too<00:06:06.390> alright<00:06:07.320> let's

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:07.680 
sounded pretty good too alright let's

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:11.120 
sounded pretty good too alright let's
try<00:06:08.010> the<00:06:08.070> G<00:06:08.580> flat<00:06:08.910> G<00:06:09.540> flat<00:06:09.660> is<00:06:09.900> the<00:06:10.380> five<00:06:10.680> chord

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.130 
try the G flat G flat is the five chord

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:14.660 
try the G flat G flat is the five chord
in<00:06:11.340> the<00:06:11.460> key<00:06:11.490> of<00:06:11.640> B<00:06:12.020> and<00:06:13.020> so<00:06:13.740> our<00:06:14.160> two<00:06:14.370> chords

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:14.670 
in the key of B and so our two chords

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:18.290 
in the key of B and so our two chords
going<00:06:14.790> to<00:06:14.880> be<00:06:14.940> C<00:06:15.180> sharp<00:06:15.450> minor<00:06:15.600> 7<00:06:16.100> and<00:06:17.150> then<00:06:18.150> our

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:18.300 
going to be C sharp minor 7 and then our

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:23.870 
going to be C sharp minor 7 and then our
five<00:06:18.770> and<00:06:19.770> then<00:06:20.670> B<00:06:21.000> flat<00:06:21.030> or<00:06:21.780> B<00:06:21.990> natural<00:06:22.880> okay

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:23.880 
five and then B flat or B natural okay

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:24.710 
five and then B flat or B natural okay
there<00:06:24.360> you<00:06:24.390> go

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:24.720 
there you go

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:27.770 
there you go
so<00:06:25.260> it<00:06:25.590> has<00:06:25.770> multiple<00:06:26.400> uses<00:06:26.610> and<00:06:27.060> this<00:06:27.540> works

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:27.780 
so it has multiple uses and this works

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:31.280 
so it has multiple uses and this works
for<00:06:27.900> every<00:06:28.740> 7<00:06:29.490> flat<00:06:29.730> 5<00:06:29.760> chord<00:06:30.030> and<00:06:30.570> if<00:06:31.170> you

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:31.290 
for every 7 flat 5 chord and if you

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:32.720 
for every 7 flat 5 chord and if you
experiment<00:06:31.800> further<00:06:32.010> you're<00:06:32.280> going<00:06:32.400> to<00:06:32.460> find

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:32.730 
experiment further you're going to find

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:34.790 
experiment further you're going to find
it<00:06:32.910> works<00:06:33.090> for<00:06:33.300> seven<00:06:33.660> sharp<00:06:34.020> five<00:06:34.320> chords

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:34.800 
it works for seven sharp five chords

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.040 
it works for seven sharp five chords
just<00:06:35.190> as<00:06:35.430> well<00:06:35.610> and<00:06:35.880> if<00:06:36.510> you<00:06:36.630> want<00:06:36.810> to<00:06:36.870> take
