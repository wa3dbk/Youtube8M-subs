this<00:00:00.599> is<00:00:00.780> what<00:00:00.930> we<00:00:01.079> sort<00:00:01.319> of<00:00:01.410> typically<00:00:01.920> do<00:00:02.129> we

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:03.000 
this is what we sort of typically do we

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.150 
this is what we sort of typically do we
go<00:00:03.179> along<00:00:03.480> this<00:00:03.659> is<00:00:03.810> the<00:00:03.929> first<00:00:04.259> pass<00:00:04.650> with<00:00:05.069> the

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
go along this is the first pass with the

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.960 
go along this is the first pass with the
player<00:00:05.460> and<00:00:06.319> in<00:00:07.319> a<00:00:07.470> paddock<00:00:07.919> that<00:00:08.099> hasn't<00:00:08.760> been

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
player and in a paddock that hasn't been

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.839 
player and in a paddock that hasn't been
touched<00:00:09.800> with<00:00:10.800> a<00:00:10.830> player<00:00:11.190> for<00:00:11.490> maybe<00:00:11.730> a

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
touched with a player for maybe a

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.110 
touched with a player for maybe a
hundred<00:00:12.120> years<00:00:12.690> when<00:00:13.380> it<00:00:13.469> was<00:00:13.590> first<00:00:14.120> turned

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
hundred years when it was first turned

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.010 
hundred years when it was first turned
into<00:00:15.450> agriculture<00:00:16.139> from<00:00:16.230> first<00:00:16.619> and<00:00:17.869> you<00:00:18.869> get

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
into agriculture from first and you get

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.529 
into agriculture from first and you get
a<00:00:19.050> bit<00:00:19.199> of<00:00:19.230> a<00:00:19.350> release<00:00:20.029> you<00:00:21.029> get<00:00:21.210> a<00:00:21.240> bit<00:00:21.390> more

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
a bit of a release you get a bit more

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.509 
a bit of a release you get a bit more
land<00:00:21.840> actually<00:00:22.490> straightaway<00:00:25.340> get<00:00:26.340> a<00:00:26.369> bit

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
land actually straightaway get a bit

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.089 
land actually straightaway get a bit
more<00:00:26.609> surface<00:00:27.180> area<00:00:27.359> all<00:00:28.140> of<00:00:28.349> can<00:00:28.529> you<00:00:28.619> see<00:00:28.830> how

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
more surface area all of can you see how

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.800 
more surface area all of can you see how
there's<00:00:29.340> a<00:00:29.400> bit<00:00:29.580> of<00:00:29.670> a<00:00:29.760> flat<00:00:30.060> area<00:00:30.300> in<00:00:30.689> between

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
there's a bit of a flat area in between

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.040 
there's a bit of a flat area in between
there<00:00:31.470> and<00:00:32.149> so<00:00:33.149> you<00:00:33.210> can<00:00:33.360> imagine<00:00:33.450> if<00:00:33.840> we're

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
there and so you can imagine if we're

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.940 
there and so you can imagine if we're
still<00:00:34.559> a<00:00:34.620> bit<00:00:34.920> compacted<00:00:35.700> and<00:00:35.850> so<00:00:36.840> if<00:00:37.530> we<00:00:37.590> get<00:00:37.890> a

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
still a bit compacted and so if we get a

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.040 
still a bit compacted and so if we get a
bit<00:00:38.129> of<00:00:38.219> a<00:00:38.280> rain<00:00:38.520> burst<00:00:38.969> what<00:00:39.390> water<00:00:39.690> doesn't

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
bit of a rain burst what water doesn't

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.380 
bit of a rain burst what water doesn't
infiltrate<00:00:40.890> down<00:00:41.160> that<00:00:41.399> groove<00:00:41.730> actually

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
infiltrate down that groove actually

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.810 
infiltrate down that groove actually
runs<00:00:42.719> along<00:00:43.710> there<00:00:44.010> because<00:00:44.399> now<00:00:44.610> we've

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
runs along there because now we've

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.569 
runs along there because now we've
actually<00:00:45.000> started<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.989> create<00:00:46.920> these<00:00:47.250> little

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
actually started to create these little

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.880 
actually started to create these little
earth<00:00:47.789> banks<00:00:48.329> that<00:00:48.539> guide<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.289> movement<00:00:49.829> of

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
earth banks that guide the movement of

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.729 
earth banks that guide the movement of
runoff<00:00:50.190> water<00:00:50.550> over<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.090> site<00:00:51.390> now<00:00:52.320> we<00:00:52.379> do<00:00:52.620> it

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
runoff water over the site now we do it

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.459 
runoff water over the site now we do it
in<00:00:52.829> such<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.070> pattern<00:00:53.460> that<00:00:53.660> falls<00:00:54.660> towards<00:00:55.320> the

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
in such a pattern that falls towards the

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.830 
in such a pattern that falls towards the
ridge<00:00:55.710> from<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.160> valley<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:56.760> in<00:00:57.449> doing<00:00:57.660> so

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
ridge from the valley and in doing so

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.060 
ridge from the valley and in doing so
actually<00:00:58.710> moves<00:00:59.629> what<00:01:00.629> moves<00:01:01.170> away<00:01:01.379> from<00:01:01.920> what

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
actually moves what moves away from what

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.969 
actually moves what moves away from what
nature<00:01:02.550> would<00:01:02.670> have<00:01:02.910> it<00:01:03.030> which<00:01:03.210> is<00:01:03.239> where

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:03.979 
nature would have it which is where

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:06.500 
nature would have it which is where
waterfalls<00:01:04.979> at<00:01:05.189> 90<00:01:05.460> degrees<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.820> a<00:01:06.030> contour

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
waterfalls at 90 degrees to a contour

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.620 
waterfalls at 90 degrees to a contour
and<00:01:06.689> always<00:01:06.930> makes<00:01:07.229> its<00:01:07.470> way<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:07.710> a<00:01:08.369> valley<00:01:08.670> and

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
and always makes its way to a valley and

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.649 
and always makes its way to a valley and
creates<00:01:10.080> deep<00:01:10.380> soils<00:01:10.950> there<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.549> puts<00:01:12.510> all

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
creates deep soils there and puts all

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.410 
creates deep soils there and puts all
the<00:01:12.780> water<00:01:12.990> then<00:01:13.260> at<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.920> cost<00:01:14.159> of<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.430> the

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
the water then at the cost of the the

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.469 
the water then at the cost of the the
water<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:15.869> soil<00:01:16.170> of<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.470> ridges<00:01:17.000> so<00:01:18.000> we<00:01:18.299> do

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
water and soil of the ridges so we do

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.420 
water and soil of the ridges so we do
the<00:01:18.509> opposite<00:01:19.110> we<00:01:19.290> actually<00:01:19.680> send<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.189> water

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
the opposite we actually send the water

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.820 
the opposite we actually send the water
from<00:01:20.970> that<00:01:21.000> would<00:01:21.509> normally<00:01:21.750> go<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.500> the

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
from that would normally go to the

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.010 
from that would normally go to the
valley<00:01:23.009> out<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.729> reach<00:01:23.939> just<00:01:24.810> by<00:01:24.990> the

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
valley out to the reach just by the

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.310 
valley out to the reach just by the
angle<00:01:25.590> of<00:01:25.710> plowing<00:01:26.540> it's<00:01:27.540> pretty<00:01:27.720> easy<00:01:27.960> I

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
angle of plowing it's pretty easy I

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.109 
angle of plowing it's pretty easy I
don't<00:01:28.680> why<00:01:28.890> what<00:01:29.159> i<00:01:29.189> call<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.610> seat<00:01:29.850> of<00:01:30.000> the

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
don't why what i call the seat of the

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.490 
don't why what i call the seat of the
pants<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:31.009> i<00:01:32.009> just<00:01:32.759> all<00:01:33.540> of<00:01:33.840> you<00:01:33.960> here<00:01:34.320> on

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
pants and i just all of you here on

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.370 
pants and i just all of you here on
shore<00:01:34.829> could<00:01:35.130> manage<00:01:35.490> it<00:01:35.700> because<00:01:36.509> i'm<00:01:36.869> pretty

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
shore could manage it because i'm pretty

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.980 
shore could manage it because i'm pretty
sure<00:01:37.710> that<00:01:37.740> you're<00:01:38.159> all<00:01:38.430> of<00:01:38.610> your<00:01:38.990> internal

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
sure that you're all of your internal

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.620 
sure that you're all of your internal
gyroscopes<00:01:40.860> are<00:01:41.189> calibrated<00:01:41.939> such<00:01:42.210> that<00:01:42.509> you

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
gyroscopes are calibrated such that you

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.420 
gyroscopes are calibrated such that you
know<00:01:42.810> when<00:01:43.020> you're<00:01:43.200> going<00:01:43.350> up<00:01:43.619> a<00:01:43.799> hill<00:01:43.829> or<00:01:44.070> down

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
know when you're going up a hill or down

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.560 
know when you're going up a hill or down
a<00:01:44.460> hill<00:01:44.820> am<00:01:44.970> I<00:01:45.119> correct<00:01:45.509> in<00:01:45.869> assuming<00:01:45.990> that

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
a hill am I correct in assuming that

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.389 
a hill am I correct in assuming that
well<00:01:48.570> it's<00:01:48.750> basically<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.380> technique<00:01:49.950> we<00:01:50.159> use

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
well it's basically the technique we use

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.730 
well it's basically the technique we use
here<00:01:50.850> when<00:01:51.450> we're<00:01:51.689> driving<00:01:51.960> we<00:01:52.320> get<00:01:52.500> in<00:01:52.649> a

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
here when we're driving we get in a

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.010 
here when we're driving we get in a
valley<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:53.220> then<00:01:53.369> we<00:01:53.490> feel<00:01:53.880> like<00:01:54.240> we've<00:01:54.570> sort

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
valley and then we feel like we've sort

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.899 
valley and then we feel like we've sort
of<00:01:55.079> touch<00:01:55.380> this<00:01:55.619> is<00:01:55.770> as<00:01:55.920> touchy<00:01:56.159> feely<00:01:56.579> as<00:01:56.759> i

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
of touch this is as touchy feely as i

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.209 
of touch this is as touchy feely as i
get<00:01:57.290> if<00:01:58.430> you<00:01:59.430> feel<00:02:00.060> like<00:02:00.090> you're<00:02:00.689> falling

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:01.219 
get if you feel like you're falling

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:04.999

what happens and you sort of get this

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.220 
what happens and you sort of get this
around<00:04:07.760> the<00:04:07.940> point<00:04:08.150> of<00:04:08.360> the<00:04:08.510> player<00:04:08.780> you<00:04:09.019> get<00:04:09.200> a

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
around the point of the player you get a

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.330 
around the point of the player you get a
lot<00:04:09.440> of<00:04:09.470> release<00:04:09.980> of<00:04:10.280> the<00:04:10.519> compaction<00:04:11.030> and

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
lot of release of the compaction and

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.240 
lot of release of the compaction and
what<00:04:13.340> it<00:04:13.459> does<00:04:13.640> is<00:04:14.030> it<00:04:14.060> if<00:04:14.810> we've<00:04:15.440> got<00:04:15.620> any<00:04:15.680> soil

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
what it does is it if we've got any soil

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.640 
what it does is it if we've got any soil
life<00:04:16.580> in<00:04:16.880> that<00:04:17.030> top<00:04:17.539> part<00:04:17.810> of<00:04:17.989> the<00:04:18.049> soil<00:04:18.440> it

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 
life in that top part of the soil it

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:20.229 
life in that top part of the soil it
actually<00:04:19.039> will<00:04:19.220> fall<00:04:19.520> down<00:04:19.549> the

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
actually will fall down the

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.370 
actually will fall down the
almost<00:04:21.139> inoculate<00:04:21.949> the<00:04:22.250> inert<00:04:22.580> subsoil<00:04:23.380> after

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
almost inoculate the inert subsoil after

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.969 
almost inoculate the inert subsoil after
the<00:04:24.710> only<00:04:25.009> difference<00:04:25.490> is<00:04:25.639> I<00:04:25.759> say<00:04:25.970> between

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:26.979 
the only difference is I say between

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:31.800 
the only difference is I say between
between<00:04:27.979> subsoil<00:04:28.729> and<00:04:28.940> topsoil<00:04:29.419> is<00:04:29.690> life

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
between subsoil and topsoil is life

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.790 
between subsoil and topsoil is life
subsoil<00:04:33.759> is<00:04:34.759> inert<00:04:35.270> material<00:04:35.930> it's<00:04:36.080> a<00:04:36.229> it

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
subsoil is inert material it's a it

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.159 
subsoil is inert material it's a it
doesn't<00:04:37.160> have<00:04:37.280> any<00:04:37.460> life<00:04:37.699> so<00:04:38.509> all<00:04:38.690> we<00:04:38.840> have<00:04:38.870> to

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:39.169 
doesn't have any life so all we have to

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:42.520 
doesn't have any life so all we have to
do<00:04:39.349> is<00:04:39.380> just<00:04:39.889> use<00:04:40.220> that<00:04:40.599> that<00:04:41.599> mineral<00:04:42.139> soil

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:42.530 
do is just use that that mineral soil

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:46.210 
do is just use that that mineral soil
and<00:04:42.889> add<00:04:43.009> some<00:04:43.250> life<00:04:43.520> to<00:04:43.550> it<00:04:43.940> aka<00:04:45.220> organic

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220 
and add some life to it aka organic

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.330 
and add some life to it aka organic
matter<00:04:46.490> or<00:04:46.819> or<00:04:47.389> get<00:04:47.810> organisms<00:04:48.770> and<00:04:49.039> then

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 
matter or or get organisms and then

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.670 
matter or or get organisms and then
convert<00:04:49.880> material<00:04:50.630> into<00:04:50.870> organic<00:04:51.229> matter<00:04:51.560> and

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
convert material into organic matter and

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.430 
convert material into organic matter and
now<00:04:51.979> we've<00:04:52.220> got<00:04:52.460> a<00:04:52.490> living<00:04:52.789> soil<00:04:53.229> and<00:04:54.229> now

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 
now we've got a living soil and now

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:55.719 
now we've got a living soil and now
we've<00:04:54.590> got<00:04:54.770> something<00:04:55.099> that's<00:04:55.250> pretty<00:04:55.490> good

00:04:55.719 --> 00:04:55.729 
we've got something that's pretty good

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:59.050 
we've got something that's pretty good
and<00:04:56.620> that<00:04:57.620> stores<00:04:57.949> carbon<00:04:58.580> and<00:04:58.729> is<00:04:58.849> a<00:04:58.880> very

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 
and that stores carbon and is a very

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.659 
and that stores carbon and is a very
very<00:04:59.569> very<00:04:59.750> stable<00:05:00.560> source<00:05:01.069> of<00:05:01.250> carbon<00:05:01.610> you

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:01.669 
very very stable source of carbon you

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:05.879 
very very stable source of carbon you
know<00:05:01.789> hereís<00:05:02.720> humise<00:05:03.349> molecules<00:05:03.979> will<00:05:04.870> last

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:05.889 
know hereís humise molecules will last

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:10.450 
know hereís humise molecules will last
5,000<00:05:06.889> years<00:05:07.840> now<00:05:08.979> think<00:05:09.979> about<00:05:10.069> that

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.460 
5,000 years now think about that

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:13.300 
5,000 years now think about that
compared<00:05:11.030> to<00:05:11.150> so-called<00:05:11.900> geo<00:05:12.560> sequestration

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310 
compared to so-called geo sequestration

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:18.309 
compared to so-called geo sequestration
as<00:05:14.090> a<00:05:14.150> means<00:05:15.080> of<00:05:15.699> injecting<00:05:16.699> carbon<00:05:17.630> dioxide

00:05:18.309 --> 00:05:18.319 
as a means of injecting carbon dioxide

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:23.879 
as a means of injecting carbon dioxide
from<00:05:18.620> coal<00:05:19.039> powered<00:05:21.009> or<00:05:22.009> cold<00:05:22.370> power<00:05:22.639> stations

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:23.889 
from coal powered or cold power stations

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:26.499 
from coal powered or cold power stations
you<00:05:24.889> put<00:05:25.070> that<00:05:25.250> stuff<00:05:25.490> in<00:05:25.639> the<00:05:25.699> in<00:05:26.060> the<00:05:26.090> ground

00:05:26.499 --> 00:05:26.509 
you put that stuff in the in the ground

00:05:26.509 --> 00:05:29.820 
you put that stuff in the in the ground
I<00:05:26.630> mean<00:05:26.780> how<00:05:26.990> stable<00:05:27.320> is<00:05:27.650> that<00:05:27.830> going<00:05:28.039> to<00:05:28.190> be

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:29.830 
I mean how stable is that going to be

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:32.499 
I mean how stable is that going to be
yeah<00:05:30.830> it's<00:05:30.979> a<00:05:31.039> lot<00:05:31.130> it's<00:05:31.159> just<00:05:31.699> it's<00:05:32.210> just<00:05:32.300> a

00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:32.509 
yeah it's a lot it's just it's just a

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:34.899 
yeah it's a lot it's just it's just a
no-brainer<00:05:32.780> to<00:05:33.320> make<00:05:33.650> soil<00:05:34.009> to<00:05:34.219> do<00:05:34.400> this<00:05:34.580> stuff

00:05:34.899 --> 00:05:34.909 
no-brainer to make soil to do this stuff

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:38.490 
no-brainer to make soil to do this stuff
it's<00:05:35.120> it's<00:05:35.690> all<00:05:35.900> there<00:05:36.169> it's<00:05:36.380> very<00:05:36.469> good

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:38.500 
it's it's all there it's very good

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.080 
it's it's all there it's very good
anyway<00:05:39.500> I've<00:05:40.099> got<00:05:40.159> a<00:05:40.340> few<00:05:40.550> other<00:05:40.669> bits<00:05:40.759> and

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.090 
anyway I've got a few other bits and

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:42.969 
anyway I've got a few other bits and
pieces<00:05:41.599> just<00:05:41.780> to<00:05:41.990> convince<00:05:42.199> you<00:05:42.620> further

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:42.979 
pieces just to convince you further

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:46.180 
pieces just to convince you further
about<00:05:43.370> the<00:05:43.789> need<00:05:44.030> to<00:05:44.060> act<00:05:44.599> just<00:05:45.289> aside<00:05:45.949> from

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:46.190 
about the need to act just aside from

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:49.510 
about the need to act just aside from
everything<00:05:46.430> else<00:05:47.139> as<00:05:48.139> far<00:05:48.469> as<00:05:48.620> agriculture<00:05:49.430> is

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:49.520 
everything else as far as agriculture is

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.060 
everything else as far as agriculture is
concerned
