00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 hello I am pascasio from tube a dot com and 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.629
 this time I come to make a 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.420
 small review of the latest development 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:13.860
 made for the legend in this case has 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.509
 caught the base of cyanogenmod 10.1 and it 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.560
 would have adapted so that you can 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.560
 execute in law 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.280
 as you can see very similar to the version 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.200
 previous that is m 10 

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:29.100
 I'm going to teach you a complication that 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.100
 alpha 3 for now 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.490
 good 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:50.410
 you can not see is before 4.2.1 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:53.130
 and in the compilation is this 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.590
 of acebal of 15 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:57.930
 how it can work pretty fluid 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.550
 but it has bay are various errors to 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.410
 try are alpha 3 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.380
 for example the wifi we have to put 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.030
 Manually name so that 

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:07.890
 they bring it to you, it does not find you 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.990
 reduce but only from the name 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.830
 of wifi network I'm going to put what the 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.040
 key 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.630
 also the manda thing works the 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.780
 it works for example the acceleration 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:23.910
 graphic in videos the official camera of 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.910
 this version is not this either 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.580
 can not miss nations 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.460
 good 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:38.960
 I want you to improve this version of the 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.960
 living first 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.360
 are the widgets this is the screen of 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:49.050
 blocking 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:49.050
 move your calendar more messages 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:57.570
 and second this we can use here we have 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:00.210
 the notifications 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.610
 and some shortcuts in this case have 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.110
 gone more than the nexus version does not 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.810
 official 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.280
 but also if you click directly you 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:13.080
 turn off do not have a shortcut 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:15.240
 Simplification as it happens in the nexus and good 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.270
 as you can see there is one when it is 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:21.569
 quite pretty well and little more not and 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:24.239
 there are not many improvements yes 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:27.689
 Regarding the living the only camera has 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:30.550
 improved the theme this from photo 760 a 

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:33.790
 chicken is not activated 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:36.820
 and it 's the blocking part and the bar 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.500
 dosages the rest is everything is very 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.570
 Similary 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.120
 this network is not made for use in the 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.470
 day by day it has various errors as it 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.760
 commented 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.080
 but good to do a test and 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.690
 teach it by itself that is worth so that 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.480
 you have a little development as 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.310
 you will know the ones with that terminal 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.410
 head that official bearing for 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.350
 approximately two years but thanks to 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:01.270
 people as well as we have the term 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.910
 updated much earlier than others 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:06.100
 jonas terminals right now that ends 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.410
 is updating this version of him and 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:11.260
 member I believe that still unless 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.910
 be a nexus no updated so 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.720
 nothing a greeting of pasta and see you in 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.720
 your point dot
