00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:10.250
 good afternoon dear friends today 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.990
 I will try to make my first video review 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:15.960
 let's start developing the channel there further 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.369
 Let's see in general today a trial review 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.609
 on headphones 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:25.980
 Now I have such headphones 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:28.500
 Akagi k 518 in my DJ here in brief 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.619
 I will tell about them and tell you what I don’t 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.860
 like will be like a short review 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:38.399
 In general, there is a box in my box 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.980
 there is no longer a long time in 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.860
 The bundle includes such a case in the main 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:49.829
 nobody uses here we go with 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:53.850
 Jack 35 35 5 5 here and the headphones themselves that 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:57.059
 I can fuck k 518 DJ that's what I can 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:03.329
 say on the headphones themselves here are the headphones 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:04.850
 chic they are durable and don't break well 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:11.790
 of course looking in what conditions 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:13.890
 use on that cuss here and me 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.100
 specifically, this is also not like when 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:20.670
 long wearing there for more than an hour or a half 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:23.400
 listening to music they start crushing something 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.250
 there is a very strong mechanism 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.530
 Well, that's starting to push frankly 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.600
 ears 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.369
 but I don't think you're too big 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:38.010
 problem for people who do not sit 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:41.610
 headphones no longer know three o'clock here 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:47.220
 so minus and I don’t know the main ones 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:50.720
 A chic headphone here was a cable here 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:54.150
 groan I was 2 in my somewhat meters 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.860
 but after a year and a half he's here 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:02:00.270
 wipe you know this standard 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:03.840
 the problem well and the cable was put it 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:06.540
 replacement so I updated them for literally 200 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.060
 120g hryvnia for our money is not set 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:12.410
 cable but not adige already from ordinary on 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:15.120
 meter twenty here and 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.580
 new ambyushurs set me 40 each 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.670
 hryvnia apiece and update this way 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.650
 every 2 years headphones and walk with 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:26.310
 good headphones rather than buying 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.330
 always cheap 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.750
 trial release 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:33.660
 my reviews are all here subscribe 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:36.630
 while on the channel I will try to do better 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.820
 more better if some cons 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.190

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:43.790
