problems<00:03:05.340> if<00:03:05.609> you<00:03:06.150> get<00:03:06.299> SLI<00:03:06.659> we<00:03:07.290> fixed<00:03:07.859> that

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
problems if you get SLI we fixed that

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.610 
problems if you get SLI we fixed that
and<00:03:08.340> I<00:03:08.819> was<00:03:09.030> so<00:03:09.299> excited<00:03:09.510> for<00:03:10.109> it<00:03:10.230> and<00:03:10.319> then<00:03:10.590> i

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
and I was so excited for it and then i

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:16.670 
and I was so excited for it and then i
buy<00:03:10.950> the<00:03:11.430> card<00:03:11.760> and<00:03:12.150> I'm<00:03:12.930> like<00:03:13.620> no<00:03:15.319> back<00:03:16.319> plate

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
buy the card and I'm like no back plate

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.530 
buy the card and I'm like no back plate
okay<00:03:17.310> and<00:03:18.650> finally<00:03:19.650> the<00:03:20.040> logo<00:03:20.729> itself<00:03:21.180> does

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
okay and finally the logo itself does

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.240 
okay and finally the logo itself does
not<00:03:21.569> light<00:03:22.079> up<00:03:22.109> uh<00:03:22.940> it's<00:03:23.940> a<00:03:24.419> minor<00:03:24.840> issue<00:03:25.709> and

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250

I'm<00:03:27.090> not<00:03:27.239> really<00:03:27.419> too<00:03:27.690> concerned<00:03:27.720> with<00:03:28.229> it<00:03:28.440> but

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
I'm not really too concerned with it but

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.429 
I'm not really too concerned with it but
I<00:03:29.069> would<00:03:29.340> liked<00:03:29.729> it<00:03:29.970> to<00:03:30.269> be<00:03:30.299> lit<00:03:30.750> up<00:03:30.900> like<00:03:31.169> all

00:03:31.429 --> 00:03:31.439 
I would liked it to be lit up like all

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:35.089 
I would liked it to be lit up like all
the<00:03:31.799> other<00:03:31.979> nine<00:03:32.280> 70s<00:03:33.349> now<00:03:34.349> I<00:03:34.379> understand<00:03:34.829> yes

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:35.099 
the other nine 70s now I understand yes

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:37.250 
the other nine 70s now I understand yes
this<00:03:35.430> is<00:03:35.579> a<00:03:35.609> lower<00:03:35.819> price<00:03:36.060> GPU<00:03:36.569> in<00:03:36.810> order<00:03:37.169> to

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
this is a lower price GPU in order to

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.439 
this is a lower price GPU in order to
achieve<00:03:37.379> the<00:03:38.280> price<00:03:38.519> that<00:03:38.669> they<00:03:38.790> had<00:03:39.000> to<00:03:39.030> cut

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:39.449

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
noticeable and it's a better experience

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.730 
noticeable and it's a better experience
but<00:04:47.220> it's<00:04:47.430> not<00:04:47.699> as<00:04:47.970> if<00:04:48.000> you<00:04:48.449> cannot<00:04:48.990> play<00:04:49.349> on

frame<00:05:15.659> rates<00:05:15.930> I'm<00:05:16.610> more<00:05:17.610> skeptical<00:05:18.270> about

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:18.479 
frame rates I'm more skeptical about

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:21.580 
frame rates I'm more skeptical about
that<00:05:18.780> because<00:05:19.620> there<00:05:20.190> are<00:05:20.219> way<00:05:20.819> better

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:21.590 
that because there are way better

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:25.520 
that because there are way better
options<00:05:22.759> to<00:05:23.759> get<00:05:23.969> better<00:05:24.180> performance<00:05:24.530> for

options to get better performance for

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:29.899 
options to get better performance for
the<00:05:25.620> price<00:05:25.889> of<00:05:26.240> 399<00:05:28.340> but<00:05:29.340> again<00:05:29.520> it's<00:05:29.669> your<00:05:29.819> own

00:05:29.899 --> 00:05:29.909 
the price of 399 but again it's your own
