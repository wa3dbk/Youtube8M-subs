more comfortable than the crate did to

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.140 
more comfortable than the crate did to
me<00:00:18.990> really<00:00:19.650> its<00:00:19.770> main<00:00:20.039> issues<00:00:20.580> come<00:00:20.850> from<00:00:21.060> the

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
me really its main issues come from the

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.029 
me really its main issues come from the
choice<00:00:21.420> of<00:00:21.630> sensor<00:00:22.050> which<00:00:22.199> was<00:00:22.410> used<00:00:22.650> in<00:00:22.890> this

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
choice of sensor which was used in this

choice of sensor which was used in this
mouse<00:00:23.279> this<00:00:23.820> mouse<00:00:24.060> is<00:00:24.090> plagued<00:00:24.600> with

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
mouse this mouse is plagued with

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.330 
mouse this mouse is plagued with
positive<00:00:25.260> acceleration<00:00:25.529> and<00:00:26.130> mouse

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
positive acceleration and mouse

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.920 
positive acceleration and mouse
smoothing<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.060> smoothing<00:00:27.390> seems<00:00:27.599> to<00:00:27.750> cause<00:00:27.900> a

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
smoothing the smoothing seems to cause a

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.779 
smoothing the smoothing seems to cause a
slight<00:00:28.230> delay<00:00:28.710> so<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.099> faster<00:00:29.429> you<00:00:29.550> flick

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
slight delay so the faster you flick

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.429 
slight delay so the faster you flick
your<00:00:29.820> mouse<00:00:30.090> around<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.720> more<00:00:30.900> you'll<00:00:31.080> notice

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
your mouse around the more you'll notice

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.229 
your mouse around the more you'll notice
this<00:00:31.830> combined<00:00:32.340> with<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.579> acceleration

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
this combined with the acceleration

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.910 
this combined with the acceleration
causes<00:00:33.510> your<00:00:33.870> fast<00:00:34.140> movements<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:34.739> feel

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
causes your fast movements to feel

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.740 
causes your fast movements to feel
sloppy<00:00:35.280> and<00:00:35.550> inaccurate<00:00:36.149> which<00:00:36.480> is<00:00:36.630> a<00:00:36.660> shame

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
sloppy and inaccurate which is a shame

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.660 
sloppy and inaccurate which is a shame
because<00:00:37.050> I<00:00:37.440> could<00:00:37.590> easily<00:00:37.800> get<00:00:38.129> this<00:00:38.309> mouse<00:00:38.489> to

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
distance is actually quite good due to

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.380

sensor is dead center I believe this is
the<00:01:35.549> reason<00:01:35.790> this<00:01:36.090> mouse<00:01:36.299> performs<00:01:36.780> better<00:01:36.960> on

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
the reason this mouse performs better on

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.200 
the reason this mouse performs better on
cloth<00:01:37.500> than<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.920> sensei<00:01:38.250> does<00:01:38.460> other<00:01:39.090> than

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
cloth than the sensei does other than

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.940 
cloth than the sensei does other than
the<00:01:39.299> tracking<00:01:39.689> issues<00:01:39.990> previously<00:01:40.500> stated<00:01:40.710> I

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
the tracking issues previously stated I

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.770 
the tracking issues previously stated I
did<00:01:41.100> not<00:01:41.250> have<00:01:41.430> any<00:01:41.579> mousepad<00:01:42.119> specific

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
did not have any mousepad specific

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.020 
did not have any mousepad specific
tracking<00:01:43.229> issues<00:01:43.560> so<00:01:44.280> in<00:01:44.399> conclusion<00:01:44.430> even

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
tracking issues so in conclusion even

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.700 
tracking issues so in conclusion even
those<00:01:45.299> mouth<00:01:45.570> feels<00:01:45.840> a<00:01:46.020> bit<00:01:46.170> more<00:01:46.350> comfortable

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
those mouth feels a bit more comfortable

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.859 
those mouth feels a bit more comfortable
