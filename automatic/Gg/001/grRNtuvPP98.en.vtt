00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.920
 hello everybody name, eduardo reis 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:32.619
 I'm a sports nutritionist and we're going 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.750
 do a series of movies here for you 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:37.900
 the purpose of clarifying some doubts 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:40.540
 regarding supplementation of part of 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.190
 sports nutrition people go 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.620
 possibly put some athletes 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.449
 We'll talk to you a little more later. 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.379
 practice what happens with what 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:51.519
 it all happens in the world of who 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.290
 practice physical activity of those who 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:55.659
 survive this within some sport 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:59.080
 is the bar that is building it in 

00:00:55.659 --> 00:01:02.799
 cycling in the bodybuilding itself for some 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:05.799
 goal and I work in nutrition 

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:07.479
 has been working since 2006 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:09.040
 several planet laboratories are 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:10.630
 optional 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.299
 even on account of that we will go 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:16.570
 talk about several different stories that 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:18.700
 happened in the course of time and 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.909
 today what we decided to say was 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:25.300
 on the theme that has surfaced 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:27.070
 now that oea itself directly 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.240
 from the bonfim fex that has made some 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.610
 reviews 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.770
 currently on the pro and has one thing 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:36.190
 which should have been done since 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:38.200
 time and now we got the boy 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.760
 called félix to whom all the videos that 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.190
 the bag man pulls the guy who 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.110
 really brought to the surface the truth about 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:48.640
 these protein supplements in Brazil 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:52.330
 Good, I remember very well how. 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.040
 how all this began in the 2000s there 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.080
 we started up from the 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:59.440
 Bombing implementation in Brazil 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:02.920
 the main brands were tim optimum web 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:06.370
 and at that time in Brazil who arrived 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:08.800
 with full support and in that in the matter 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:11.319
 national media and had the 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.900
 hypothesis of a pound 319 to the banknotes 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:15.519
 of the integral medical era had 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.610
 some calcium proteins then we 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:20.409
 was very poor of a prosthesis with the 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.290
 over time and staff felt that 

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:24.909
 it was the money mine to make to the market 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.730
 of supplements and among them the 

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:30.610
 used and for us to get 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.770
 have a diet protein adequacy 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.960
 It is good to point out that it is not only 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.270
 the athlete who uses his own is not only the 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.700
 sea ​​a fireman bodybuilding the taker 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:41.650
 of a steroid that uses a prosthesis in 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.610
 proves in fact not one of the proteins 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.500
 of milk 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.110
 we can separate the milk with 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.150
 two cancerous proteins which is what 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.640
 gives the white color the milk is what makes the 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.710
 cheese making curd pits o ias 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.890
 speak the folders of petitions that are 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:59.440
 curry, among others , and 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:02.230
 whey protein that is our 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:05.740
 and pro has after he already tried 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:07.510
 units in weight of water is worth 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.640
 noting that the used himself in 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.390
 dog ration is used because of 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.920
 Public is for who is 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.660
 there are hospitalized children 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.430
 Who uses pta mil? 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:22.720
 there is one and the own fla has caffeine 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:24.430
 also then there is a very large myth 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.610
 on the hypothesis as to whether 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:30.280
 wait for steroid people is this hero 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:32.739
 Anabolic steroids are compressed and 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.750
 the intramuscular application has nothing to do with 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:37.930
 with the province itself has created a 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:40.090
 myth generations after generations and this niche 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.250
 It's been passed on, no one cares. 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.410
 study and we have today in society 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.900
 this prejudice with this plan is super 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.640
 important 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.680
 then it is of the utmost importance 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.330
 félix bonfim make these analyzes for 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.790
 we can highlight in the market who 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:58.420
 really deserves the highlight with the 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:00.910
 The main components in Brazil are me 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:03.610
 I remember very well that in 2005 I 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:06.430
 worked on a national brand and 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:09.850
 during a distribution meeting at 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:12.160
 meeting of the vendors of a trademark in the 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:14.799
 My boss came inside the room 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.359
 and if you did not know very well entered the 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:19.330
 room and spoke like this if it were just me 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:22.660
 I need one and 35% and we got everything 

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:24.729
 world half lost because it teaches import 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.650
 Why do I just have to do it? 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:28.840
 worries about selling that sold 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:32.080
 So, yes, I'm talking about the 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:35.260
 2005 market in 2005 I'm already talking about 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:38.560
 for you in this company that I 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.850
 I worked and soon after that I left already 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.020
 had 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:43.910
 in the market for supplements 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:47.270
 especially in the area of 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:49.460
 merit of proteins and because the pro 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.740
 People in Brazil can get malta. 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.600
 destination a very affordable price 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:56.150
 the box is one of the main producers 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:59.240
 of marijuana in Brazil is passed on the price 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:01.400
 of 34 50 reais, the kilo was 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.260
 in Brazil there is no production of 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.090
 raw material then this raw material 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.620
 coming from outside it generates a very 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.810
 high 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.490
 the company can make fun of it, it earns a 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:11.990
 slightly more raw material. 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:14.510
 cheap talking that is a raw material 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:16.940
 good quality and this year I got a 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:18.199
 little more money so much

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:21.620
 national 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:23.810
