00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 will eat all so today we get 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:07.710
 found for some dupe of varnish 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:10.769
 I found dupes and I wanted you 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.090
 to talk about it because there are polishes that I 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.309
 might be introduced to you 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.870
 and here is this varnish that is not done 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.390
 higher than it is difficult to find or 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.160
 which are expensive and so it is I have you 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.130
 found alternatives to these little ones 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.980
 varnish so at the color level this 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.119
 still enough colors 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.580
 spring and summer there is no 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.810
 too much dark color so I showed 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.399
 all right now 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.250
 so we go right away with that 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:40.230
 from revlon who's the pitch here it is 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:43.350
 the 23 the pcci so there is a very pretty 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.879
 fishing nor too bright us too dark and 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.239
 so this one I found on the site 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.530
 of live frags so my opinion we can 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.510
 find that there down 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.730
 so if you just want this one and 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.059
 you do not want you a kiss you have 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.800
 this one from Claire who is the same 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.620
 end it's the same it's exactly the 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.140
 same thing and that of chez claire is 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.159
 the light choir so that's good because 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.510
 that now they have names 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:12.659
 so if you're interested here and for 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.220
 info it costs two euros 99 am here I 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.330
 say pay one euro and so what is it 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.280
 is cheaper but it is more 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.210
 easily findable so for you 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.390
 it may be easier 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:24.000
 so that's it for the first one then we have 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.810
 a varnish from orly so it's not 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.960
 quite the same 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:31.200
 there we have a fishing time finally pictures going 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:34.890
 really about oranges and here we have a 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.049
 pink rose species with cubs 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.030
 orange and other souto is very light 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.590
 this is audi the same I have 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.479
 found on the site 3 live I 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:49.350
 did not want to show on video and that's the 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:52.909
 cotton candy here and for a crazy with 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:55.259
 2.8 so one that are really alike 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:58.369
 it's a dice I do not know if you 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:02.189
 can find them so watch it here 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:04.950
 still substantially the same and 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.090
 this one is going to find them on the 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.459
 markets or 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:12.030
 I think on discount websites and it's 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:14.580
 the 160 points info here for that otherwise 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:21.060
 you have that Czech Republic it's a 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:26.360
 quick drive is the 303 here but who 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:28.230
 a little bit more at mans I therefore disappoint 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.780
 it's a bit the same color but a 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.760
 more orange and so with the dahlia he 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.819
 do a little more do it at the level of 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.900
 fooled but they are less 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:38.160
 I think we can less easily 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.440
 find them they are not dear to me I 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.900
 pay them less than one euro 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.489
 then we have a cost I love I 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.370
 find is beautiful and I thought that 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:49.019
 I would have never found a due and if I 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.660
 found a goal so it's an orly 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:55.530
 always so it's a rising flow and a 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:57.450
 neon pink pretty dark last night no I 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.519
 do not think it looks great, we're going 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.190
 pretty much anyway I'll put some 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:03.540
 delusions towards the most swatch 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.519
 resemblances of what I think 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.900
 a bar of information like that you can 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.920
 to go to see directly because in 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.350
 video is always a little 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:15.180
 catastrophic colors and so I 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:17.430
 found this one from home semic so here 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.709
 can be found on the site of smic and 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:25.370
 it's number 14 is this one wanted 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:27.870
 not said it's the patient fruit here 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.920
 so it's the same am here I do not have 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.540
 still tested but that one 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.660
 see I put a small nail 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.760
 is it a matte effect so if you take 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:37.370
 past 1 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.930
 a top coat over it if you want a 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.060
 shiny effect otherwise it is matt 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.069
 so here I think it has to be 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.980
 the same often flows to the cemat no 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:49.459
 then we have a limited edition 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:52.220
 of checchi co which is the celebration I 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:58.400
 do not know which collection and this is 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:04:01.099
 the 422 and I found pretty much the duel 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:04.700
 in a little lighter that is the same 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:06.790
 checchi co so here's the world on 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:13.090
 sides it will be simpler 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:13.090
 that's what it gives and here it's 389 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:17.900
 that's it if you want this edition 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.350
 limited the you see it in videos 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.669
 etc. 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.430
 you do not have the opportunity to 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:25.669
 find and well this one makes it widely 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:27.400
 to do for a chouÃ¯a we will not 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:31.100
 quibble 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:33.350
 then we have a mini colorama of 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.970
 at maybelline so this one is a 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.710
 blue sky so I do not know if we can 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:39.770
 still found them that and that's the 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:41.389
 blue party the 96 I do not know at all if 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.740
 you can still find them for me I 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:47.330
 found at home it seems to me and so 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:53.380
 for exactly the same color you 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:55.960
 have the clear sky 2 at claire's lo 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:58.430
 he's perfect dupe 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:00.500
 Here it here by pretending to 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:03.199
 videos I do not care I actually 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.479
 really what you need in varnish and I 

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:07.490
 continue to buy 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:08.510
 and still a limited edition this is the 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:10.070
 last to nice is an edition 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:11.780
 kiko limited of the same collection 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:14.830
 that you present them before the green 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:18.680
 it's the 419 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:21.110
 that's what is like this is probably 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:23.449
 that I found it was this one of 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:28.659
 at yves rocher it's coral coral 

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:31.069
 lively and so it gives this 

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:35.659
 so there we camera I feel that 

00:05:31.069 --> 00:05:36.829
 clearer the ricoh mewes when 

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:38.689
 I had done the swatch late was coming out 

00:05:36.829 --> 00:05:39.879
 really the same so I think it's 

00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:45.259
 a flask 

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:48.109
 so here it is for his doubts so if 

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:49.939
 it interests you others duped on the 

00:05:48.109 --> 00:05:50.479
 varnish off maybe even on 

00:05:49.939 --> 00:05:52.609
 lipstick 

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:54.679
 do not hesitate to tell me because 

00:05:52.609 --> 00:05:56.599
 still, I have a lot of products and 

00:05:54.679 --> 00:05:59.149
 I'm sure I have perfect dupes 

00:05:56.599 --> 00:06:01.849
 some lighthouses not found or very 

00:05:59.149 --> 00:06:04.279
 dear so do not hesitate to tell me that if 

00:06:01.849 --> 00:06:05.449
 I like that I wanted to do this kind 

00:06:04.279 --> 00:06:05.839
 video because I think it can 

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:07.279
 help 

00:06:05.839 --> 00:06:09.169
 so the little me is in the 

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:10.909
 comments and for info I think we 

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:11.360
 will ask me about house because I 

00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:12.739
 door 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.229
 we do not care there I have a 

00:06:12.739 --> 00:06:17.929
 small disaster but he also has 

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:21.349
 it's the new checchi co so in 

00:06:17.929 --> 00:06:24.139
 that age and basic I most 

00:06:21.349 --> 00:06:26.689
 clear of the cupcakes collection so 

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:29.509
 it's sugar mast species not 

00:06:26.689 --> 00:06:34.039
 take like that it's kind of 

00:06:29.509 --> 00:06:35.539
 sugar mate a little sugar effect etc and by 

00:06:34.039 --> 00:06:39.829
 on it so I could give you the 

00:06:35.539 --> 00:06:40.999
 exact numbers of the orders of 

00:06:39.829 --> 00:06:42.829
 varnish because I do not know them by 

00:06:40.999 --> 00:06:44.239
 heart but here it is the clearest of 

00:06:42.829 --> 00:06:48.319
 the collection and by two subjects of the 

00:06:44.239 --> 00:06:51.110
 sequins glitter is easy 

00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:52.339
 top cops and see top what i finally believe 

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:54.439
 these two collections that come from 

00:06:52.339 --> 00:06:56.659
 go out very recently at whom this is 

00:06:54.439 --> 00:06:58.309
 really super nice so if that you 

00:06:56.659 --> 00:06:59.749
 interest this is what it looks like so on 

00:06:58.309 --> 00:07:01.129
 this I tell you very soon in a 

00:06:59.749 --> 00:07:04.299
 next video I make you kisses 

00:07:01.129 --> 00:07:04.299
 and value
