up a little swatch and see how you like

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.680 
up a little swatch and see how you like
it<00:01:27.950> with<00:01:28.280> the<00:01:28.430> type<00:01:28.640> of<00:01:28.670> yarn<00:01:29.150> you've<00:01:29.390> picked

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:29.690 
it with the type of yarn you've picked

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.230 
it with the type of yarn you've picked
it<00:01:29.960> really<00:01:30.260> depends<00:01:30.650> up<00:01:30.740> on<00:01:30.890> the<00:01:31.040> yarn<00:01:31.280> I<00:01:31.520> think

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
it really depends up on the yarn I think

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.270 
it really depends up on the yarn I think
on<00:01:32.390> average<00:01:32.570> five<00:01:33.110> is<00:01:33.350> fine<00:01:33.620> so<00:01:33.950> if<00:01:34.010> you<00:01:34.100> want

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
on average five is fine so if you want

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.200 
on average five is fine so if you want
to<00:01:34.340> do<00:01:34.430> four<00:01:34.670> or<00:01:34.880> five<00:01:35.120> that's<00:01:35.930> great

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
to do four or five that's great

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.480 
to do four or five that's great
you<00:01:38.210> might<00:01:38.390> try<00:01:38.600> four<00:01:38.990> or<00:01:39.110> five<00:01:39.320> and<00:01:39.710> see<00:01:39.980> if<00:01:40.280> it

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
you might try four or five and see if it

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.720 
you might try four or five and see if it
works<00:01:41.090> for<00:01:41.240> you<00:01:41.600> so<00:01:41.870> this<00:01:42.680> is<00:01:42.740> four<00:01:43.250> you've

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:43.730

we get to five

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.740 
we get to five
it's<00:01:48.080> barely<00:01:49.000> sticking<00:01:50.000> on<00:01:50.300> there<00:01:50.480> so<00:01:50.720> you

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
it's barely sticking on there so you

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.560 
it's barely sticking on there so you
have<00:01:51.050> to<00:01:51.230> really<00:01:51.380> kind<00:01:51.710> of<00:01:51.830> hold<00:01:52.070> it<00:01:52.220> down

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
have to really kind of hold it down

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.600

these<00:01:53.570> are<00:01:53.630> shorter<00:01:54.140> pegs<00:01:54.410> if<00:01:54.740> you're<00:01:54.920> on<00:01:55.070> one

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
these are shorter pegs if you're on one

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.380 
these are shorter pegs if you're on one
of<00:01:55.670> the<00:01:55.790> looms<00:01:55.970> it<00:01:56.180> has<00:01:56.330> some<00:01:56.510> longer<00:01:56.840> pegs

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
of the looms it has some longer pegs

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.900 
of the looms it has some longer pegs
then<00:01:59.390> you<00:01:59.540> may<00:01:59.830> you<00:02:00.830> may<00:02:00.890> find<00:02:01.220> that<00:02:01.340> five<00:02:01.670> is

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:01.910 
then you may you may find that five is

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:03.880 
then you may you may find that five is
no<00:02:02.060> not<00:02:02.360> a<00:02:02.390> problem<00:02:02.600> so<00:02:03.320> now<00:02:03.500> that<00:02:03.590> I've<00:02:03.740> got

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:05.300

all these extra little fibers in this
one<00:03:03.410> string<00:03:03.860> and<00:03:04.010> so<00:03:04.310> that's<00:03:05.120> why<00:03:05.300> I<00:03:05.330> say<00:03:05.570> don't

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
one string and so that's why I say don't

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.810 
one string and so that's why I say don't
start<00:03:06.140> with<00:03:06.290> this<00:03:06.410> one<00:03:06.650> okay<00:03:07.310> we're<00:03:07.489> on<00:03:07.610> to<00:03:07.790> our

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
next bobble so it's it's really good to

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:11.920 
next bobble so it's it's really good to
have<00:03:10.130> the<00:03:10.310> spacing<00:03:10.880> in<00:03:11.000> here<00:03:11.270> in<00:03:11.420> order<00:03:11.570> to<00:03:11.660> get

have the spacing in here in order to get
a<00:03:11.989> nice<00:03:12.230> little<00:03:12.530> pattern<00:03:12.860> if<00:03:13.250> I<00:03:13.730> tried<00:03:13.970> to<00:03:14.120> put

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
look the same okay so we're going to

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:27.130 
look the same okay so we're going to
wrap<00:03:19.700> this<00:03:19.730> next<00:03:20.270> peg<00:03:20.510> here<00:03:20.930> one<00:03:21.230> time<00:03:26.140> two

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
wrap this next peg here one time two

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.880 
wrap this next peg here one time two
times

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:40.110 

three<00:03:32.890> times

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:49.860 

get<00:03:40.660> all<00:03:40.900> those<00:03:41.170> fibers

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.470 

so<00:03:50.500> you<00:03:50.800> can<00:03:50.980> try<00:03:51.220> for<00:03:51.280> you<00:03:51.819> can<00:03:51.970> try<00:03:52.180> five
