 to be buried we were 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.569
 make a mixture 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.990
 location of this material 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.660

 You can mix this up. 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:13.150
 the use of these materials 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:13.150
 and turn it into some useful piece 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.230

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:22.009
 it will take away 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:36.449
 now this mass is put on 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:44.659
 the mold in the case here we are going to manufacture 

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:44.659
 the fair a hydraulic press food 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.770

00:05:05.589 --> 00:05:20.619
 array press was empty 

00:05:11.859 --> 00:05:22.599
 then that mold that used the one that 

00:05:20.619 --> 00:05:24.069
 That residue then I used to go to 

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:28.539
 have one all that stuff 

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:32.919
 blended has become law may 

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:36.459
 serve for a sidewalk own streets 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:41.799
 even a different concrete tire a 

00:05:36.459 --> 00:05:44.979
 Recycled plastic panel then
