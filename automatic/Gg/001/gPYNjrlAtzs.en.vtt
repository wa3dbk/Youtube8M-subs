00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
procedure when I drink this I want to

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.100 
procedure when I drink this I want to
keep<00:00:50.039> my<00:00:50.219> hands<00:00:50.430> protected<00:00:51.120> because<00:00:51.600> that<00:00:51.960> is

keep my hands protected because that is

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.189 
keep my hands protected because that is
not<00:00:52.260> sterile<00:00:52.770> yet<00:00:52.980> so<00:00:53.730> I<00:00:53.820> step<00:00:54.149> up<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:54.660> I<00:00:54.780> slide

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
not sterile yet so I step up and I slide

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.330 
not sterile yet so I step up and I slide
this<00:00:55.410> on<00:00:56.750> now<00:00:57.750> this<00:00:57.960> is<00:00:58.170> sterile<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:58.980> I<00:00:59.160> can

this on now this is sterile and I can

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.180 
this on now this is sterile and I can
pull<00:00:59.609> it<00:00:59.640> into<00:00:59.910> my<00:01:00.239> field<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:01.440> next<00:01:01.800> step<00:01:02.010> is

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
pull it into my field the next step is

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.030 
pull it into my field the next step is
to<00:01:02.370> add<00:01:02.489> an<00:01:02.640> extra<00:01:03.059> layer<00:01:03.149> of<00:01:03.359> protection<00:01:04.040> this

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
to add an extra layer of protection this

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.160

prevents<00:01:05.580> contamination<00:01:08.030> so<00:01:09.030> after<00:01:09.570> I<00:01:09.840> have

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
prevents contamination so after I have

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.640 
prevents contamination so after I have
added<00:01:10.770> this<00:01:11.070> layer<00:01:11.400> I<00:01:11.760> can<00:01:12.030> move<00:01:12.420> my

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
the surgeon so at this point they would

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.490 
the surgeon so at this point they would
come<00:02:47.129> in<00:02:47.390> you<00:02:48.390> would<00:02:48.540> down<00:02:48.720> them<00:02:48.930> sterile<00:02:49.379> II

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500

so if there's a lot of blood in the area

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:06.379 
so if there's a lot of blood in the area
it<00:04:04.260> is<00:04:04.620> their<00:04:04.859> not<00:04:05.010> job<00:04:05.400> to<00:04:05.609> suction<00:04:05.970> it<00:04:06.269> so

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:06.389 
it is their not job to suction it so

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:07.909 
it is their not job to suction it so
that<00:04:06.510> the<00:04:06.599> surgeon<00:04:06.900> can<00:04:07.230> see<00:04:07.530> what<00:04:07.769> they're
