00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
in the middle securely you're going to

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.540 
in the middle securely you're going to
try<00:02:58.110> and<00:02:58.230> push<00:02:58.440> down<00:02:58.620> on<00:02:58.680> that<00:02:58.890> so<00:02:59.280> that<00:02:59.430> it

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
try and push down on that so that it

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.040 
try and push down on that so that it
doesn't<00:02:59.819> break<00:02:59.940> those<00:03:00.239> clips<00:03:00.540> off<00:03:00.720> while<00:03:00.959> you

it to the front head of your bike they
are<00:03:19.950> very<00:03:20.280> tiny<00:03:20.610> and<00:03:20.880> they<00:03:20.940> can<00:03:21.090> snap<00:03:21.360> off<00:03:21.570> real

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
are very tiny and they can snap off real

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:27.069 
are very tiny and they can snap off real
easy<00:03:22.200> so<00:03:23.160> just<00:03:23.489> take<00:03:23.760> your<00:03:23.940> time<00:03:24.120> do<00:03:24.810> it<00:03:24.959> slow

easy so just take your time do it slow

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:30.620 
easy so just take your time do it slow
and<00:03:28.100> you're<00:03:29.100> going<00:03:29.250> to<00:03:29.280> slowly<00:03:30.000> work<00:03:30.299> your<00:03:30.510> way

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
and you're going to slowly work your way

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.920 
and you're going to slowly work your way
around<00:03:30.829> until<00:03:31.829> it<00:03:31.950> snaps<00:03:32.190> off<00:03:32.459> make<00:03:33.450> sure<00:03:33.480> not

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
around until it snaps off make sure not

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.990 
around until it snaps off make sure not
to<00:03:34.170> pull<00:03:34.620> directly<00:03:34.829> out<00:03:35.310> because<00:03:35.760> there<00:03:35.880> are

to pull directly out because there are
two<00:03:36.209> clips<00:03:36.510> on<00:03:36.660> the<00:03:36.870> side<00:03:37.110> there<00:03:37.350> that<00:03:37.380> can

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
two clips on the side there that can

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:40.340 
two clips on the side there that can
snap<00:03:38.040> you<00:03:38.790> want<00:03:38.970> to<00:03:39.090> try<00:03:39.329> and<00:03:39.480> put<00:03:39.690> it<00:03:39.810> at<00:03:40.019> a<00:03:40.049> 90

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
snap you want to try and put it at a 90

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.759 
snap you want to try and put it at a 90
degree<00:03:40.709> angle<00:03:40.739> as<00:03:41.160> much<00:03:41.970> as<00:03:42.150> you<00:03:42.209> can<00:03:42.420> and
