00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
their levels by one so at the very least

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.410 
their levels by one so at the very least
you<00:01:43.229> can<00:01:43.500> overlay<00:01:44.040> these<00:01:44.250> two<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.850> summon<00:01:45.210> gig

you can overlay these two to summon gig

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.109 
you can overlay these two to summon gig
and<00:01:45.750> eggs<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.170> just<00:01:47.159> get<00:01:47.340> search<00:01:47.640> so<00:01:48.000> it

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
and eggs and just get search so it

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.149 
and eggs and just get search so it
basically<00:01:48.210> replaces<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.500> gay<00:01:49.710> gear<00:01:49.950> gear

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
basically replaces the the gay gear gear

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.859 
basically replaces the the gay gear gear
that<00:01:50.310> you<00:01:50.340> use<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.670> summon<00:01:51.119> these<00:01:51.270> two<00:01:51.479> Giggy

that you use to summon these two Giggy

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.649 
that you use to summon these two Giggy
honors<00:01:52.340> however<00:01:53.340> that's<00:01:53.729> that's<00:01:54.210> like<00:01:54.479> the

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
honors however that's that's like the

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.719 
honors however that's that's like the
least<00:01:54.840> you<00:01:55.140> could<00:01:55.320> do<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.890> deck<00:01:56.070> actually<00:01:56.520> has

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
least you could do the deck actually has

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.539 
least you could do the deck actually has
a<00:01:56.969> massive<00:01:57.390> potential<00:01:57.899> to<00:01:58.229> pull<00:01:58.409> out<00:01:58.560> massive

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
a massive potential to pull out massive

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.429 
a massive potential to pull out massive
amounts<00:01:59.610> of<00:01:59.850> synchros<00:02:00.329> at<00:02:00.570> any<00:02:00.810> moment<00:02:01.079> notice

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
amounts of synchros at any moment notice

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.010 
amounts of synchros at any moment notice
so<00:02:02.070> basically<00:02:02.520> we<00:02:02.729> know<00:02:02.850> that<00:02:03.030> gig<00:02:03.240> is<00:02:03.689> is<00:02:03.960> a

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
so basically we know that gig is is a

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.319 
so basically we know that gig is is a
deck<00:02:04.740> that<00:02:04.770> builds<00:02:05.250> an<00:02:05.340> advantage<00:02:05.820> so<00:02:06.270> you

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
deck that builds an advantage so you

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.660 
deck that builds an advantage so you

if<00:03:35.820> you're<00:03:36.030> building<00:03:36.420> so<00:03:36.570> much<00:03:36.750> advantage

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
if you're building so much advantage

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.680 
if you're building so much advantage
with<00:03:37.500> a<00:03:37.530> deck<00:03:37.709> like<00:03:37.740> this<00:03:38.100> then<00:03:38.790> being<00:03:39.330> able<00:03:39.420> to

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
with a deck like this then being able to

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.320 
with a deck like this then being able to
just<00:03:39.720> go<00:03:40.050> off<00:03:40.230> into<00:03:40.530> clouds<00:03:40.920> is<00:03:41.330> something

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
just go off into clouds is something

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.620 
just go off into clouds is something
that<00:03:42.630> makes<00:03:43.140> the<00:03:43.350> deck<00:03:43.560> tier<00:03:44.160> one<00:03:44.400> worthy<00:03:44.640> if

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
that makes the deck tier one worthy if

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.870 
that makes the deck tier one worthy if
you<00:03:45.840> have<00:03:46.020> to<00:03:46.200> build<00:03:46.500> up<00:03:46.680> an<00:03:46.800> advantage<00:03:47.340> to<00:03:47.580> a

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
you have to build up an advantage to a

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.310 
you have to build up an advantage to a
point<00:03:48.120> where<00:03:48.209> you<00:03:48.360> need<00:03:48.510> to<00:03:48.600> do<00:03:48.720> a<00:03:48.750> four-card

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
point where you need to do a four-card

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.620 
point where you need to do a four-card
otk<00:03:49.830> then<00:03:50.310> it's<00:03:50.610> as<00:03:50.790> if<00:03:51.120> you're<00:03:51.300> doing<00:03:51.510> an

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
otk then it's as if you're doing an

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.630 
otk then it's as if you're doing an
all-or-nothing<00:03:52.020> gamble<00:03:52.680> and<00:03:53.100> you're

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
all-or-nothing gamble and you're

all-or-nothing gamble and you're
pointing<00:03:53.760> all<00:03:54.030> that<00:03:54.150> advantage<00:03:54.450> for<00:03:54.780> all

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
pointing all that advantage for all

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.030 
pointing all that advantage for all
those<00:03:55.020> turns<00:03:55.350> and<00:03:55.650> then<00:03:55.740> you<00:03:55.830> suddenly

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
those turns and then you suddenly

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.949 
those turns and then you suddenly
realize<00:03:56.580> that<00:03:56.760> you<00:03:56.820> do<00:03:56.970> this<00:03:57.120> IDK<00:03:57.390> and<00:03:57.840> it

realize that you do this IDK and it
doesn't<00:03:58.230> go<00:03:58.320> off<00:03:58.500> and<00:03:58.770> it's<00:03:58.830> a<00:03:58.980> fail<00:03:59.160> and<00:03:59.459> you

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:00.240 
doesn't go off and it's a fail and you

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.580 
doesn't go off and it's a fail and you
realize<00:04:00.540> that<00:04:00.570> you've<00:04:00.840> lost<00:04:00.990> everything<00:04:01.200> just

realize that you've lost everything just

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.560 
realize that you've lost everything just
because<00:04:01.890> you<00:04:02.070> the<00:04:02.640> deck<00:04:02.850> that's<00:04:03.180> how<00:04:03.300> the<00:04:03.360> deck

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
because you the deck that's how the deck

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:06.020 
because you the deck that's how the deck
works<00:04:03.810> but<00:04:04.320> actually<00:04:04.860> in<00:04:05.100> this<00:04:05.310> case<00:04:05.370> you

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
works but actually in this case you

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.360 
works but actually in this case you
actually<00:04:06.240> are<00:04:06.630> just<00:04:06.930> simply<00:04:07.200> summoning<00:04:08.130> all

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
actually are just simply summoning all

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
already gained like tons of cause of

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.660 
already gained like tons of cause of
advantage<00:04:12.959> so<00:04:13.440> that's<00:04:13.709> why<00:04:13.890> it's<00:04:13.920> so<00:04:14.250> good<00:04:14.489> and

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670

could use our gig

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.270

Apache and then you do the whole thing
again<00:04:31.310> and<00:04:31.460> then<00:04:31.760> when<00:04:31.940> you<00:04:32.060> leave<00:04:32.270> when<00:04:32.510> you
