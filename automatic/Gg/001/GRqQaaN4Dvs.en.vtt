00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:09.179
 hello to all happy to meet you 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.000
 on paris turf tv for your show 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.980
 daily devoted to the quinté plus and 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.260
 at 5.5 today to accompany me 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.480
 I'm getting damien bazerque hello damien 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.160
 hello lucie hello everyone so what 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.439
 Wednesday is an event in 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.840
 Fontainebleau on the 2000 meters 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.760
 did the numbers to the rope have 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.199
 a particular incidence in rule 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.699
 general bombard but maybe to 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.689
 clairefontaine it's this summer because 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.279
 that they end up outside or 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.420
 holy cloud a broken ground when he 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.140
 must when they end up outside it's 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.120
 true that it's still important 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.530
 to have a good rope number there it's 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.600
 a rather selective route that is to say that 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.100
 the horses will go fast enough 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.020
 departure it is an important turning point of 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.430
 find his place but hey it's also a 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.840
 plot that is a little bit particular 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.370
 because in the end we think that the 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.780
 last straight line is long but 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.640
 not at all because in the end there is a 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.379
 the airlock to turn a little bit goes up 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.969
 so it's true it's a course 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.260
 which is very particular and it is rather 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.370
 the horses going to 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.690
 the front who are advantaged compared 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.640
 to wait-and-see who really needs to 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.320
 become very very early if he wants to be able to 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.789
 to make the finish very well so I imagine 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.460
 that you took that into account for 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.320
 make your prediction it's me I you 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.790
 leave to give your selection 8.6 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.409
 a lot then in mind I spent the 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.990
 number 12 5 singles without suite the number 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.299
 7 golden criss the 8th remember salsa the 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.340
 10 years at azur the number 3 blackrock 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.220
 the number 13 walk monsters the 16 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.650
 iluv wolf and number 6 e ben ward very 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.570
 alright so the number 12 are finielz 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.549
 your favorite that of lack and very 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.330
 late that started only at 6 years old 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.220
 exactly 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.119
 exactly she started at age 6 on 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.200
 last time I do not know if you have 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.710
 the opportunity to see the race was at 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.240
 marsan mount 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.799
 that day she started in the 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.450
 handicaps unfortunately for her 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.100
 bomb at the stele of his jockey turned 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.540
 that day I think that if the scene 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.710
 had not turned she would have 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.570
 maybe gilbert maybe because 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.250
 it was not safe to impose in any case 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.720
 wind it was catanzaro a horse of 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.860
 Charles Gourdain who confirmed in the 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.720
 handicap which is very regular so 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.009
 it's not anyone here I think 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.659
 we've seen it a c for me it's a 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.950
 third test handicap so at the 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.689
 largely all at home without all his 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.829
 chances and if she was a non- starter 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.119
 this Sunday is simply because 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.950
 that the truck that was to bring him to 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.030
 races broke down so you tell me 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.140
 say it's a lot of bad luck for 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.310
 the same judgment but as we say in 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.390
 life luck it turns out so I 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.130
 really think that luck will turn 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.329
 and this mare who in addition to that can 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.229
 get ahead as was the case 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.819
 in mont-de-marsan I see it all 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.990
 simply imposed himself in in this 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.520
 quarter quarter 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.840
 for me it's just against 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.580
 it looks like late gallons of earnings she 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.110
 fact of going from progress to progress and I 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.650
 think it's going to be her day very well she 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.720
 discover fountainbleau as many of 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.070
 names if it goes ahead is the selva 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.630
 from the front it will not be a big problem 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.040
 to pull him number 10 his look and go 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.020
 can put it pretty much where it 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.800
 wants that's okay so behind 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:33.210
 you rank the number 7 golden criss 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.350
 so before you tell us why 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.940
 we will listen right now 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.770
 emmanuel richon who speaks to us about 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:41.550
 chances of this number 7 it's the minute 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:43.050
 field I have long discussed with 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.550
 nicot patrick who introduces the young 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.990
 tristan the quinté of Wednesday at 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.000
 fontainebleau the man from the island of reem 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.260
 appeared the very confident with the 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.160
 golden criss it must be said that she 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.050
 is experiencing a crisis remains on a 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.490
 excellent performance in deauville this 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.140
 day there he has long galloped in 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.730
 platoon thickness and yet golden 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.260
 criss ended up fighting for the 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.330
 victory was beaten in the 100 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.070
 last meters by c10 sand patrick 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.200
 remy just coordinates somewhat that the 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.970
 because is not flexible enough for his 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.290
 boarder but the bottom ground of the 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.880
 blue will still not necessarily 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.260
 embarrassed al golden criss 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.610
 as for his number in the stalls of 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.650
 starting patrick nicot is not at all 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.900
 worries indeed a golden criss and a 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.470
 horse with big actions he will only be 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.270
 no worse 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.430
 by going outside rather than 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.440
 find locked in a platoon 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.430
 so many reasons to see a good 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.630
 Luck at this golden criss in this quinté 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.830
 it will be understood it is a little 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.780
 trust in the environment 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.190
 what do you think about it I think 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.150
 that's logical and his last two 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.320
 exits in lots that was 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.340
 maybe a little bit higher 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.170
 last two strokes the horse gets 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.520
 behaved very well this is an excellent 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.410
 seasonal that can be mounted close to 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.580
 the head for the about the numbers 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.720
 body that is the case fabrice veron 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.000
 those favoring one can make him 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.320
 trust for to best manage his 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.670
 horse now it's true that there is 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.020
 always a risk with this number to the 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.950
 rope but trust fabrice 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.480
 veron to give him better 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.680
 course and if so I think 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.910
 that without speaking of victory it is 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.590
 really the basis of the race because 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:57.330
 I do not see him coming out of 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.790
 first five this horse very well 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:02.310
 then you rank number 8 remember 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.080
 salsa that stays on two successful yeah 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.280
 actually it's in the good old days 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.450
 summer at stéphane ratel it was a 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.770
 mare that I loved is a 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.450
 wait-and-see is often the note 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:10.680
 besides after that she left 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.910
 at romain le gall she just arrived 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.330
 at Patrice Châtelain for whom she is 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.220
 unbeaten 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.240
 first to claim a nice victory on 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.680
 last move I found that it affects 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.000
 a lot of margin was set up by a 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.620
 rider who was inexperienced 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.299
 there we change rudy it's mickaël 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.109
 barzalona we do not have to prove his 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:23.189
 genius 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:25.409
 because for them it's really a 

00:04:23.189 --> 00:04:26.849
 rider who is awesome certainly y'a de 

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:28.199
 quillan worst of the success the 

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:30.000
 last blow is there they did not hesitate 

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:31.319
 to be offensive I really think there 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.490
 that it's going to be a bullet without a time of 

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:34.500
 Advent I do not think it's 2 kg 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.370
 that will stop him from repeating so there 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.590
 still all the lights are green 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.969
 in my opinion very well and then in 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:42.539
 fourth position you rank the 

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:43.530
 number 10 azure angel who hears 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:45.960
 well with maxime guyon 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.949
 exactly this is an element that has for 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.509
 him to be manageable what is always 

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:49.710
 very important in a course in a 

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:51.569
 quinté who are races a little bit 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.099
 stock because of times when there are a lot of 

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:54.599
 movement and a lot of shock 

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:56.009
 this horse there I find that both 

00:04:54.599 --> 00:04:57.029
 last shots the handicaps were a 

00:04:56.009 --> 00:04:58.860
 little bit higher at either 

00:04:57.029 --> 00:04:59.969
 vichy like a mill so down according to 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.349
 I really see a whole 

00:04:59.969 --> 00:05:02.610
 first chance maxime guyon knows him 

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:04.500
 is confidence because we 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.610
 reassures it's an element that vernet to 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.830
 leicester coming from germany 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:10.259
 so we can trust them 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.490
 but what really matters is that 

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:12.990
 two years old disability was a lot 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.400
 more to dream than there I could have placed in 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.779
 head I will go in 4 times 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.430
 make choices but if either 

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:20.189
 the future win it would not surprise me 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:23.610
 ok and finally in fifth position you 

00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:25.560
 classify the number 3 blackrock which has 100% 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:28.110
 of success at fountain a win a 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:29.669
 race a win that ask for more 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:31.620
 so that's an element that I love 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:33.120
 horse that I like a lot since his 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.680
 beginnings again it's a horse 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.000
 late but it's a horse when 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.500
 launches everything in the battle that is very 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.969
 brave and fountainbleau 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:41.310
 it's very important because it's 

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:42.210
 true that compared to this water so that's 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:43.710
 something that is who is very 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:47.639
 important delphine santiago it was

00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:57.180
 he has already won at fontainebleau he is 

00:05:56.039 --> 00:05:59.099
 in great shape and last sprout and and 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:00.210
 the note being a little more offensive this 

00:05:59.099 --> 00:06:01.469

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:03.029

 due to the start it may be 

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:17.669
 in my opinion it will still be possible 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:19.050
 a third test handicap this is 

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:19.979
