hi<00:00:07.240> this<00:00:07.540> is<00:00:07.569> a<00:00:07.779> hakuouki<00:00:08.530> from<00:00:08.769> gigabyte<00:00:09.040> and

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:09.490 
hi this is a hakuouki from gigabyte and

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:12.810 
hi this is a hakuouki from gigabyte and
the<00:00:09.849> today<00:00:10.150> i<00:00:10.389> will<00:00:10.809> show<00:00:10.930> you<00:00:11.289> our<00:00:11.680> new<00:00:12.400> launch

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:12.820 
the today i will show you our new launch

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.370 
the today i will show you our new launch
a<00:00:13.710> utility<00:00:14.710> we<00:00:15.129> call<00:00:15.400> you<00:00:15.549> a<00:00:15.730> CD<00:00:15.969> power<00:00:16.360> so<00:00:17.169> it's

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:17.380 
a utility we call you a CD power so it's

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.940 
a utility we call you a CD power so it's
a<00:00:17.470> very<00:00:17.560> useful<00:00:17.980> utility<00:00:19.140> for<00:00:20.140> you<00:00:20.320> thinking

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:20.950 
a very useful utility for you thinking

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:24.210 
a very useful utility for you thinking
and<00:00:21.250> the<00:00:21.460> pw<00:00:22.140> something<00:00:23.140> if<00:00:23.320> you<00:00:23.529> help<00:00:23.739> you<00:00:23.980> to

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:24.220 
and the pw something if you help you to

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.970 
and the pw something if you help you to
overclocking<00:00:24.730> so<00:00:25.570> now<00:00:25.779> i<00:00:26.020> can<00:00:26.050> i<00:00:26.259> use<00:00:26.470> the<00:00:26.710> CD

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:26.980 
overclocking so now i can i use the CD

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.790 
overclocking so now i can i use the CD

revolution and the sea and now my cpu is
learning<00:00:34.149> for<00:00:34.300> kickers<00:00:34.600> and<00:00:35.110> you<00:00:35.800> can<00:00:35.980> Morton

00:00:36.389 --> 00:00:36.399 
learning for kickers and you can Morton

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:39.960 
learning for kickers and you can Morton
the<00:00:36.850> voltage<00:00:37.180> is<00:00:37.450> 1.29<00:00:38.190> also<00:00:39.190> i<00:00:39.220> have<00:00:39.580> a<00:00:39.610> seat

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:39.970 
the voltage is 1.29 also i have a seat

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:44.700 
the voltage is 1.29 also i have a seat
in<00:00:40.120> 620<00:00:40.780> here<00:00:41.200> you<00:00:42.160> can<00:00:42.690> you<00:00:43.690> can<00:00:43.840> open<00:00:44.230> it<00:00:44.350> to

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.710 
in 620 here you can you can open it to

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.710 
in 620 here you can you can open it to
see<00:00:44.740> the<00:00:45.370> voltage<00:00:45.520> and<00:00:46.140> frequency<00:00:47.140> i<00:00:48.690> have<00:00:49.690> a

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:49.720 
see the voltage and frequency i have a

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:55.170 
see the voltage and frequency i have a
stress<00:00:50.380> to<00:00:50.650> here<00:00:51.040> for<00:00:51.400> links<00:00:52.560> now<00:00:53.560> I'm<00:00:53.970> put<00:00:54.970> on

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.180 
stress to here for links now I'm put on

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.970 
stress to here for links now I'm put on
the<00:00:55.989> loric<00:00:56.350> revolution<00:00:57.070> in<00:00:57.220> the<00:00:58.060> treaty<00:00:58.420> power

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
the loric revolution in the treaty power

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.139 
the loric revolution in the treaty power
and<00:00:59.980> I<00:01:00.070> change<00:01:00.640> to<00:01:00.820> the<00:01:00.940> CPU<00:01:01.560> now<00:01:02.940> now<00:01:03.940> can

00:01:04.139 --> 00:01:04.149 
and I change to the CPU now now can

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:06.929 
and I change to the CPU now now can
start<00:01:04.449> with<00:01:04.600> the<00:01:04.780> RT<00:01:05.290> phone<00:01:05.530> and<00:01:06.100> it<00:01:06.579> keeps<00:01:06.759> on

00:01:06.929 --> 00:01:06.939 
start with the RT phone and it keeps on

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:12.330 
start with the RT phone and it keeps on
stress<00:01:07.270> and<00:01:07.509> see<00:01:07.780> all<00:01:08.350> the<00:01:08.409> voltage<00:01:11.130> now<00:01:12.130> it's

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
stress and see all the voltage now it's

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.599 
stress and see all the voltage now it's
it's<00:01:12.999> 1.2<00:01:13.749> phone<00:01:14.049> chopped<00:01:14.409> 2<00:01:14.590> 112<00:01:14.950> 40<00:01:15.369> ready

00:01:15.599 --> 00:01:15.609 
it's 1.2 phone chopped 2 112 40 ready

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:19.109 
it's 1.2 phone chopped 2 112 40 ready
right<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:17.590> same<00:01:17.889> way<00:01:18.009> the<00:01:18.069> egt<00:01:18.429> of<00:01:18.609> six<00:01:18.850> shows

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.119 
right the same way the egt of six shows

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:22.859 
right the same way the egt of six shows
and<00:01:20.280> then<00:01:21.280> I<00:01:21.490> can<00:01:21.670> change<00:01:21.880> the<00:01:22.119> cpu<00:01:22.630> laura

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869 
and then I can change the cpu laura

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:25.859 
and then I can change the cpu laura
collaboration<00:01:23.619> and<00:01:24.579> I<00:01:24.850> can<00:01:25.329> make<00:01:25.450> it<00:01:25.719> more

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:25.869 
collaboration and I can make it more

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:31.120 
collaboration and I can make it more
freight<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:27.670> confirm

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.980 

so<00:01:31.640> now<00:01:31.820> the<00:01:32.810> voltage<00:01:33.170> is<00:01:33.200> lost<00:01:33.770> to<00:01:34.039> 143<00:01:34.990> okay

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
so now the voltage is lost to 143 okay

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.310 
so now the voltage is lost to 143 okay
if<00:01:36.289> you<00:01:36.530> don't<00:01:36.740> like<00:01:36.890> it<00:01:37.390> the<00:01:38.390> voltage<00:01:38.840> lack<00:01:39.140> of

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
if you don't like it the voltage lack of

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.090 
if you don't like it the voltage lack of
awkward<00:01:39.680> sweet<00:01:40.000> you<00:01:41.000> can<00:01:41.289> you<00:01:42.289> can<00:01:42.320> change<00:01:42.770> the

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
awkward sweet you can you can change the

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.819 
awkward sweet you can you can change the
different<00:01:44.060> don't<00:01:44.360> like<00:01:44.539> preparation<00:01:45.470> labels

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:45.829 
different don't like preparation labels

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:50.499 
different don't like preparation labels
on<00:01:46.520> the<00:01:46.729> fly<00:01:47.710> and<00:01:48.710> also<00:01:49.130> you<00:01:49.189> can<00:01:49.460> use<00:01:49.729> the

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
on the fly and also you can use the

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:57.010 
on the fly and also you can use the
different<00:01:51.140> voltage<00:01:55.509> you<00:01:56.509> can<00:01:56.539> use<00:01:56.840> the

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
different voltage you can use the

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.149 
different voltage you can use the
different<00:01:57.460> HepB<00:01:58.460> code<00:01:59.439> then<00:02:00.439> in<00:02:00.649> the<00:02:00.740> end<00:02:00.829> you

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:01.159 
different HepB code then in the end you

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:21.270 
different HepB code then in the end you
will<00:02:01.310> find<00:02:01.549> the<00:02:01.970> bastard<00:02:02.420> voltage<00:02:02.840> for<00:02:03.830> us<00:02:04.069> CPU

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.340
