00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:33.309 
first time what I recommend is just
reboot<00:06:29.030> your<00:06:30.069> reboot<00:06:31.069> your<00:06:31.159> iPhone<00:06:31.520> and<00:06:32.319> make

00:06:33.309 --> 00:06:33.319 
reboot your reboot your iPhone and make

00:06:33.319 --> 00:06:36.249 
reboot your reboot your iPhone and make
sure<00:06:33.530> you<00:06:33.740> have<00:06:33.949> your<00:06:34.720> 3g<00:06:35.720> settings<00:06:36.080> off

00:06:36.249 --> 00:06:36.259 
sure you have your 3g settings off

00:06:36.259 --> 00:06:38.770 
sure you have your 3g settings off

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:38.780 
because when you're running t-mobile

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:40.869 
because when you're running t-mobile
you're<00:06:38.990> not<00:06:39.110> going<00:06:39.259> to<00:06:39.319> be<00:06:39.409> able<00:06:39.440> to<00:06:39.770> use<00:06:40.729> the

00:06:40.869 --> 00:06:40.879 
you're not going to be able to use the

3g<00:06:41.120> network<00:06:41.690> so<00:06:42.470> this<00:06:42.560> is<00:06:42.590> going<00:06:42.770> to<00:06:42.830> network

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:43.220 
3g network so this is going to network

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:47.890
