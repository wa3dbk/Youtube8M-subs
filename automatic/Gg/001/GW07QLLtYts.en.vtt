 with a vocation focused mainly on freight transportation 

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:21.970
 during practically 20 years of operation 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:23.960
 it was underutilized 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.380

 the air terminal 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:50.130
 reached a historic growth 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.600
 thanks to the support of the state government 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.370

 the puebla international airport has grown close to 300 percent in the 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.740
 number of passengers transferred to and from this air terminal 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.550
 this growth has allowed for the first time 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.220
 utilities and operations are recorded and resources exist to support the 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:26.550
 expansion works focused on improving quality and safety in the service to 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.430

 already offers a flight with connection asia and europe 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.780
 the presence of new airlines as well as the increase in the number of 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.400
 frequencies and dress lines that were already established 

00:02:16.109 --> 00:02:17.040
 last years 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.770
 To date, more than two hundred and thirty operations have been registered 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.570
 week on a regular basis in terms of air cargo the volume handled in 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:30.369
 the terminal has grown 224% since 2005 

00:02:30.369 --> 00:02:34.209
 for the next few years the growth in the load volume is expected 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.839
 be much greater due to the start of operations of the aero logistics center 

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:43.869
 port that obtained its certification as a fiscal area and control 

00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:47.150
 in addition to cargo handling and storage services 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.389
 commercial and value-added services are offered for companies 

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:52.379
 thus 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:54.739
 the aero port logistics center 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:58.470
 is currently the most modern efficient charging center 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.689
 and equipped of the country 

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:04.529
 efficient movement of goods will be facilitated by allowing 

00:03:04.529 --> 00:03:08.869
 Convergence of load carriers and consolidators with the actors 

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:11.619
 involved in foreign trade 

00:03:11.619 --> 00:03:16.419
 With the Port Aide Logistics Center we are looking to develop a cargo market 

00:03:16.419 --> 00:03:21.479
 domestic through connections to the various states that comprise the arch 

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.799
 south 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:24.179
 this epicenter of the country goes up 

00:03:24.179 --> 00:03:28.619
 At the same time they are developing direct cargo humala puebla with 

00:03:28.619 --> 00:03:30.549
 U.S 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:32.589
 South America and in Europe 

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:36.269
 additionally you can get benefits from commercial flights 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:37.439
 current 

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:42.079
 which can serve as a means to transport cargo so actives de puebla 

00:03:42.649 --> 00:03:46.209
 not only has commercial aviation developed significantly 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:50.069
 also the private aviation ccoo private has shown an increase 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:53.069
 important in the number of registered operations 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.030
 in the last three years the general aviation operations 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.379
 they increased 49 percent 

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:04.670
 this growth has made it possible to make modifications times by asen 

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:05.499
 walk 

00:04:05.499 --> 00:04:08.719

 rest for pilots internet connection among others 

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:21.669
 recent modifications 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:24.380
 before the growth observed in recent years 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.500
 it was necessary to make immediate modifications to meet the needs 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.650
 urgent before carrying out the major expansion work 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.460
 from the international airport of puebla 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.300
 For airport security, the airport has all kinds of 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.290
 surveillance 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:44.030
 and a computed tomography machine for review and 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:47.090
 detection of explosives in checked baggage 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:51.070
 being one of the few airports in the country that offers this type of security 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.180
 of high technology 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.719
 expansion and modernization project 

00:04:55.719 --> 00:04:58.539
 from the international airport of puebla 

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:02.819
 In the international airport of Puebla there is a new life 

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:06.659
 serve more than one million passengers per year before three years 

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:11.300
 achieving in this way to be a good option as a complementary airport 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.210
 for in the city of mexico 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:17.910
 To reach this goal, we already have the executive project but what will be the 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:21.199
 2008 2000 expansion program 11 

00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:26.539
 the expansion program was designed under the following parameters count 

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:30.409
 with an uncomfortable functional terminal building for our passengers 

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:34.759
 adopt know the current conditions of global aviation 

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:38.090
 and comply with international safety standards and 

00:05:38.089 --> 00:05:39.069
 operation 

00:05:39.069 --> 00:05:43.819
 It was sought to have a building in which it is possible to clearly separate the flows of 

00:05:43.819 --> 00:05:46.810
 national passengers of the international 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:50.479
 optimize the use of spaces to offer a commercial area 

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:51.670
 that will attend a year 

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:55.390
 this demand from our users and achieve a design that allows a 

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:58.510
 gradual future growth according to our needs 

00:05:59.689 --> 00:06:02.309
 the proposal is modern and innovative 

00:06:02.309 --> 00:06:05.909
 which sought to make the most of the current structure to 

00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:09.209
 minimize construction costs and to facilitate the operation 

00:06:09.209 --> 00:06:13.959
 uninterrupted airport is sought through design and finishes 

00:06:13.959 --> 00:06:18.719
 give a new identity to the terminal an aspect that allows its easy 

00:06:18.719 --> 00:06:21.719
 relationship with the environment of the region 

00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:26.729
 the wide territorial extension available to the international airport of 

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:26.960
