00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
that same kind of coloring I say that

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.700 
that same kind of coloring I say that
because<00:02:40.240> it's<00:02:40.480> long<00:02:40.660> has<00:02:40.810> a<00:02:40.840> calico<00:02:41.290> cat

off-camera<00:02:43.660> here<00:02:43.930> is<00:02:44.050> penny<00:02:44.770> so<00:02:45.069> you<00:02:45.100> can<00:02:45.280> see

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
off-camera here is penny so you can see

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.600 
off-camera here is penny so you can see
the<00:02:45.520> difference<00:02:45.760> between<00:02:45.910> the<00:02:46.209> two<00:02:47.459> you<00:02:48.459> can

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
the difference between the two you can

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.640 
the difference between the two you can
really<00:02:48.819> see<00:02:49.030> where<00:02:49.240> NECA<00:02:49.840> can<00:02:50.080> take<00:02:50.260> something

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
really see where NECA can take something

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.970 
really see where NECA can take something
like<00:02:50.830> the<00:02:51.160> body<00:02:51.459> the<00:02:51.730> limbs<00:02:52.030> and<00:02:52.390> just<00:02:53.380> by<00:02:53.500> some

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
like the body the limbs and just by some

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.340 
like the body the limbs and just by some
tweaking<00:02:54.700> here<00:02:55.030> and<00:02:55.090> there<00:02:55.240> they<00:02:55.870> can<00:02:56.020> give<00:02:56.200> us

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
tweaking here and there they can give us

moving penny off camera the the same

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.650 
moving penny off camera the the same
problem<00:03:14.800> however<00:03:14.950> with<00:03:15.310> Penny<00:03:15.550> same<00:03:16.360> problem

that<00:03:16.720> brownie<00:03:17.170> has<00:03:17.410> his<00:03:17.920> trackball<00:03:18.430> is

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
that brownie has his trackball is

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.330 
that brownie has his trackball is
extremely<00:03:19.480> loose<00:03:19.930> what<00:03:20.920> that<00:03:21.070> ends<00:03:21.280> up

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
extremely loose what that ends up

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.130 
extremely loose what that ends up
meaning<00:03:21.580> is<00:03:21.820> that<00:03:21.850> the<00:03:22.180> eyes<00:03:22.450> aren't<00:03:22.870> the

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
meaning is that the eyes aren't the

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.410 
meaning is that the eyes aren't the
easiest<00:03:23.170> to<00:03:24.130> move<00:03:24.310> in<00:03:24.580> fact<00:03:24.850> you<00:03:25.000> can<00:03:25.150> start

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
easiest to move in fact you can start

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:26.490 
easiest to move in fact you can start
kind<00:03:25.600> of<00:03:25.660> seeing<00:03:25.900> what<00:03:26.170> ends<00:03:26.380> up<00:03:26.440> happening

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
kind of seeing what ends up happening

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.759 
kind of seeing what ends up happening
these<00:03:27.430> trackball<00:03:28.120> eyes<00:03:28.330> start<00:03:29.019> just<00:03:29.320> kind<00:03:29.650> of

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
these trackball eyes start just kind of

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:33.000 
these trackball eyes start just kind of
going<00:03:30.100> all<00:03:30.250> over<00:03:30.280> the<00:03:30.610> place<00:03:30.790> I<00:03:31.030> would<00:03:31.780> say<00:03:32.170> how

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
going all over the place I would say how

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.830 
going all over the place I would say how
I<00:03:33.280> had<00:03:33.730> it<00:03:35.040> kind<00:03:36.040> of<00:03:36.160> just<00:03:36.370> get<00:03:36.550> them<00:03:36.640> off<00:03:37.000> there

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
I had it kind of just get them off there

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.759 
I had it kind of just get them off there
we<00:03:38.580> go<00:03:39.580> I<00:03:40.360> would<00:03:40.959> just<00:03:41.080> kind<00:03:41.200> of<00:03:41.290> keep<00:03:41.500> them<00:03:41.650> in

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769 
we go I would just kind of keep them in

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:46.050 
we go I would just kind of keep them in
one<00:03:42.040> area<00:03:42.280> and<00:03:42.459> just<00:03:42.880> like<00:03:43.060> leave<00:03:43.480> them<00:03:43.900> be<00:03:45.060> or

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
one area and just like leave them be or

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.960 
one area and just like leave them be or
perhaps<00:03:46.630> what<00:03:46.959> you<00:03:47.049> could<00:03:47.230> also<00:03:47.410> do<00:03:47.709> is<00:03:47.980> put

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
perhaps what you could also do is put

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.630 
perhaps what you could also do is put
them<00:03:49.120> in<00:03:49.239> one<00:03:49.480> area<00:03:49.810> and<00:03:50.340> then<00:03:51.340> reach

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 
them in one area and then reach

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.030 
them in one area and then reach
off-camera<00:03:52.209> I<00:03:52.540> say<00:03:53.290> reach<00:03:53.470> off-camera<00:03:53.829> but

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
off-camera I say reach off-camera but

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.920 
off-camera I say reach off-camera but
reach<00:03:54.190> off<00:03:54.370> to<00:03:54.489> where<00:03:54.640> you<00:03:54.790> you<00:03:55.180> kept<00:03:55.480> this<00:03:55.720> and

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
reach off to where you you kept this and

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:01.050 
reach off to where you you kept this and
just<00:03:56.560> take<00:03:56.829> the<00:03:57.870> take<00:03:58.870> the<00:03:59.190> tag<00:04:00.190> not<00:04:00.760> that<00:04:00.940> you

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
just take the take the tag not that you

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.580 
just take the take the tag not that you
would<00:04:01.180> want<00:04:01.420> to<00:04:01.510> see<00:04:01.690> this<00:04:01.840> but<00:04:01.989> if<00:04:02.260> it's

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
would want to see this but if it's

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.380 
would want to see this but if it's
technically<00:04:02.980> not<00:04:03.280> if<00:04:03.700> it's<00:04:03.850> on<00:04:03.940> your<00:04:04.090> shelf
