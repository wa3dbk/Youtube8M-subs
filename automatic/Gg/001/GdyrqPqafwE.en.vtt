00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.819
 Hello everyone, I'm glad to see you on my own 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:10.230
 the channel recently came to save got 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:18.180
 finally your package from china here 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:19.380
 strings of 447 flowers I want to show what 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:25.710
 the way she made 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:28.970
 I made the order on March 18, but here it is indicated 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.710
 that the reception was the very package apparently on 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.920
 Chinese Post April 27 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.610
 Well, almost 10 days for some reason not 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.210
 sent to the parcel went very quickly 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:43.760
 so here is the century 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:49.770
 Ekaterinburg she was Rostov-on-Don 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:51.660
 then in Stavropol on March 14 it was already 15 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.230
 April 4 took Article 4 in April 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.449
 April 15th I was already in Pyatigorsk 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:01.890
 I live in Pyatigorsk but this is the main page 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:04.220
 there is the main post office further it 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:11.790
 should have come to the village post office 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:14.760
 but not 15 and 16 not 17 even at 18 was not 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.430
 no information about what went 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:21.150
 I watched the package by track number 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:26.440
 only the 19th information appeared 15 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:29.150
 she was our friend, and that's 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:32.210
 just today and and took twenty 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:34.460
 The first number is exactly one month. 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:38.500
 after i did zakart but myself 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:42.080
 the package went less than 20 days 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:45.670
 Now I will unpack it and show that 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:50.690
 there itself is no longer impatient 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:52.640
 I'll show you hello again next day 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.729
 I wouldn't be able to shoot yesterday 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:58.940
 This video until the end and so I opened 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:04.070
 the package there lay 1c of such pieces with 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:04.670
 Threads and 4 more motki I put in 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.369
 present 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:10.640
 but I was a little upset because I 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:13.700
 I thought I would also put rods for 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.739
 markup that showed Sasha 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:19.850
 kirichenko as I did the order exactly 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:23.090
 on the link here where I ordered on but me 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:25.489
 they did not put them beef greedy like 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:29.300
 my daughter says but young you need to start 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:31.190
 and here are these kulёchki numbered 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:35.450
 as well as 123 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:38.060
 until 11 unity pike and this is probably 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:42.500
 become 7 laid out in order 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:45.500
 increasing 150 150 g so here is 3 st it 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.269
 so on so on that is i will them 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:51.320
 lay out most likely as I will 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:54.350
 organize ascending here i am 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:57.260
 Already, in principle, I figured out how I can 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:59.230
 do as I want to do but do not know yet 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.980
 whether it is looking for water or not 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:06.140
 prepared such a box of shoes 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:12.019
 that's all good bye in these 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:18.769
 bags fit well what I want to say 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:21.590
 strings to soft they shine less than 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:24.950
 day sit si smoother these more 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:28.910
 fluffy and according to my feelings though 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:30.820
 wrote that it is a polyester I think it 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.960
 acrylic 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:39.720
 well look 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:42.810
 but as if for this price I am not very much 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:47.820
 what I expected of course I hoped for 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:51.150
 best but ready and worst well, nothing 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:53.870
 I will fit them I will use them to embroider 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.870
 maybe it will say fu china but why 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:04:00.210
 buy dense dense but certainly better 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:03.420
 But at that time there was no such impulse 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:06.030
 I wanted to order of course I understand that 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:09.270
 I could order this money and 1 de 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:12.780
 Malcevsky set and I can map flowers 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:14.940
 not one of either a color card or a set 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.310
 nice but i wanted you to order 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.780
 These threads I ordered all I allowed 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:23.880
 I rarely repent and allow 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:26.220
 and here I always decided for the way here by the way 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:31.890
 all such hanker with two fall 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:34.440
 it was here that the labels came across 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:42.230
 eyes so basically it's with one 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:45.270
 the label is not focused 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:51.420
 so here are the things I will show 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:56.070
 so how do i arrange strings bye 

00:04:51.420 --> 00:05:00.050
 I have not tried them as embroidery yet 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:02.930
 I want to make a lively color map of them 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:11.640
 so basically i 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:12.180
 while at the moment I am happy and will be 

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:15.750
 embroider 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:17.910
 I will try here so big 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:21.660
 I am unlikely to order in lots 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:23.790
 but then of course not to the idea of ​​msi I will also 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:26.730
 order most likely for some 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:30.240
 individual projects well, and I will embroider and 

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:33.870
 this thread is also why not why am I 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:36.870
 not such a big fan of ya 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:40.950
 I embroider with different threads therefore everything to me 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:43.070
 will fit thank you all very much for 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:43.070
 Attention
