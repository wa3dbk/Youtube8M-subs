done in that situation I said yes yes
they<00:00:47.219> are<00:00:47.399> so<00:00:47.670> now<00:00:47.820> that<00:00:48.059> guy<00:00:48.239> thinks<00:00:48.570> we<00:00:48.690> have

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
they are so now that guy thinks we have

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.600 
they are so now that guy thinks we have
awesome<00:00:49.379> names<00:00:49.649> unless<00:00:49.890> he's<00:00:50.190> watching<00:00:50.520> this

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
awesome names unless he's watching this

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.479 
awesome names unless he's watching this
video<00:00:50.879> but<00:00:51.570> I'm<00:00:51.770> this<00:00:52.770> guy<00:00:52.949> thinks<00:00:53.280> we<00:00:53.370> have

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
video but I'm this guy thinks we have

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.209 
video but I'm this guy thinks we have
the<00:00:53.670> most<00:00:53.820> awesome<00:00:54.120> names<00:00:54.660> in<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:55.289> history<00:00:55.890> of

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
the most awesome names in the history of

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.610 
the most awesome names in the history of
names<00:00:56.579> I<00:00:56.850> guess<00:00:57.030> is<00:00:57.270> if<00:00:57.480> there's<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:57.809> history<00:00:58.410> of

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
names I guess is if there's a history of

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.709 
names I guess is if there's a history of
names<00:00:58.920> a<00:00:59.070> hall<00:00:59.250> of<00:00:59.399> fame<00:00:59.670> of<00:00:59.699> names<00:01:00.210> somewhere

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
names a hall of fame of names somewhere

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.439

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
probably but I'm in my mind I guess but

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.750

um so that's pretty awesome but no

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.550 
um so that's pretty awesome but no
obviously<00:01:06.270> our<00:01:06.479> real<00:01:06.750> names<00:01:06.960> are<00:01:07.110> not<00:01:07.200> gold

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
like that I hate it but maybe it's just

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.309 
like that I hate it but maybe it's just
call<00:02:23.700> duty<00:02:23.940> being<00:02:24.270> getting<00:02:24.810> boring<00:02:25.020> for<00:02:25.260> me

call duty being getting boring for me
but<00:02:25.590> black<00:02:25.830> ops<00:02:26.099> isn't<00:02:26.370> because<00:02:26.580> I've<00:02:26.700> always

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
but black ops isn't because I've always

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.520 
but black ops isn't because I've always
loved<00:02:27.239> black<00:02:27.450> ops<00:02:27.750> I<00:02:27.930> think<00:02:28.170> it's<00:02:28.290> a<00:02:28.380> really

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
loved black ops I think it's a really

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.410 
loved black ops I think it's a really
fun<00:02:28.620> game<00:02:28.800> and<00:02:29.160> loudly<00:02:29.760> because<00:02:29.940> I<00:02:30.120> can<00:02:30.270> do

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
fun game and loudly because I can do

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.390 
fun game and loudly because I can do
really<00:02:30.780> well<00:02:30.900> on<00:02:30.959> it<00:02:31.260> it's<00:02:31.410> relatively<00:02:32.250> easy

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
really well on it it's relatively easy

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.010 
really well on it it's relatively easy
i'm<00:02:32.790> not<00:02:32.940> going<00:02:33.120> to<00:02:33.150> say<00:02:33.330> it's<00:02:33.450> really<00:02:33.780> easy

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
i'm not going to say it's really easy

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.870 
i'm not going to say it's really easy
but<00:02:34.319> in<00:02:34.410> comparison<00:02:34.560> to<00:02:35.010> modern<00:02:35.250> warfare<00:02:35.280> 3<00:02:35.489> it

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
but in comparison to modern warfare 3 it

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.940 
but in comparison to modern warfare 3 it
is<00:02:36.209> really<00:02:36.480> and<00:02:36.840> it's<00:02:37.140> relatively<00:02:37.560> easy<00:02:37.770> to

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
is really and it's relatively easy to

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.800 
is really and it's relatively easy to
get<00:02:38.160> 50<00:02:38.550> kills<00:02:38.760> in<00:02:38.910> TDM<00:02:39.239> and<00:02:39.390> all<00:02:39.450> that<00:02:39.630> stuff

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
get 50 kills in TDM and all that stuff

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.320 
get 50 kills in TDM and all that stuff
and<00:02:40.080> 100<00:02:40.739> kills<00:02:40.920> and<00:02:41.069> domination<00:02:41.400> so<00:02:42.090> on

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
and 100 kills and domination so on

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.360 
and 100 kills and domination so on
that's<00:02:42.599> possibly<00:02:43.349> why<00:02:43.620> I<00:02:43.650> like<00:02:43.920> black<00:02:44.130> ops

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
that's possibly why I like black ops

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.699 
that's possibly why I like black ops
more<00:02:44.640> than<00:02:44.760> modern<00:02:45.030> warfare<00:02:45.209> 3<00:02:45.390> but<00:02:46.260> um<00:02:46.410> yeah

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
more than modern warfare 3 but um yeah

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.020 
more than modern warfare 3 but um yeah
I've<00:02:46.800> been<00:02:46.950> playing<00:02:47.160> some<00:02:47.370> of<00:02:47.489> that<00:02:47.640> I<00:02:47.819> don't

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
I've been playing some of that I don't

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.490 
I've been playing some of that I don't
feel<00:02:48.180> like<00:02:48.330> uploading<00:02:48.660> black<00:02:48.989> ops<00:02:49.230> gameplay

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
feel like uploading black ops gameplay

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.559 
feel like uploading black ops gameplay
although<00:02:50.310> I<00:02:50.340> have<00:02:50.640> gotten<00:02:50.910> some<00:02:51.150> good<00:02:51.269> scores

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
although I have gotten some good scores

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:53.330 
although I have gotten some good scores
I<00:02:51.810> really<00:02:52.319> don't<00:02:52.440> feel<00:02:52.680> like<00:02:52.739> doing<00:02:53.010> that

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
I really don't feel like doing that

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.430 
I really don't feel like doing that

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.370 
sure modern warfare 3 it's the new game
obviously<00:03:02.160> people<00:03:02.190> want<00:03:02.640> to<00:03:02.730> see<00:03:02.880> it<00:03:03.000> and<00:03:03.380> so

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
obviously people want to see it and so

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:05.870 
obviously people want to see it and so
that's<00:03:04.530> why<00:03:04.739> I'm<00:03:04.799> not<00:03:04.980> uploading<00:03:05.459> black<00:03:05.670> ops

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
that's why I'm not uploading black ops

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.490 
that's why I'm not uploading black ops
but<00:03:06.000> I<00:03:06.060> haven't<00:03:06.330> played<00:03:06.600> it<00:03:06.870> so<00:03:07.080> I<00:03:07.110> haven't

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
but I haven't played it so I haven't

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:08.930 
but I haven't played it so I haven't
playing<00:03:07.650> some<00:03:07.860> modern<00:03:08.069> warfare<00:03:08.190> 3<00:03:08.340> 2<00:03:08.700> for

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
playing some modern warfare 3 2 for

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.229 
playing some modern warfare 3 2 for
example<00:03:09.269> this<00:03:09.390> gameplay<00:03:09.769> but<00:03:10.769> I<00:03:11.100> I'm<00:03:11.760> going<00:03:12.120> to

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
example this gameplay but I I'm going to

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:13.520 
example this gameplay but I I'm going to
put<00:03:12.390> some<00:03:12.420> more<00:03:12.630> time<00:03:12.840> in<00:03:13.019> modern<00:03:13.230> warfare<00:03:13.260> 3

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
put some more time in modern warfare 3

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.020 
put some more time in modern warfare 3
to<00:03:13.830> get<00:03:13.890> better<00:03:14.069> game<00:03:14.310> plays<00:03:14.549> because<00:03:14.730> I

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
to get better game plays because I

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.569 
to get better game plays because I
figured<00:03:15.090> out<00:03:15.600> that<00:03:15.660> i<00:03:16.140> only<00:03:16.890> play<00:03:17.160> call<00:03:17.370> duty

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
figured out that i only play call duty

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:19.340 
figured out that i only play call duty
for<00:03:17.820> youtube<00:03:18.180> really<00:03:18.450> if<00:03:18.600> i<00:03:18.750> were<00:03:18.930> to<00:03:19.170> be

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
for youtube really if i were to be

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.289 
for youtube really if i were to be
making<00:03:20.070> these<00:03:20.190> videos<00:03:20.250> with<00:03:20.850> us<00:03:21.030> where<00:03:21.269> I

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
making these videos with us where I

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:22.430 
making these videos with us where I
probably<00:03:21.570> wouldn't<00:03:21.930> be<00:03:21.989> playing<00:03:22.170> call<00:03:22.410> of

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
probably wouldn't be playing call of

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.860 
probably wouldn't be playing call of
duty<00:03:22.530> because<00:03:22.890> it's<00:03:23.220> not<00:03:23.670> well<00:03:24.060> I<00:03:24.090> like<00:03:24.420> games

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
duty because it's not well I like games

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.750 
duty because it's not well I like games
like<00:03:25.170> fifa<00:03:25.440> more<00:03:25.829> so<00:03:26.660> so<00:03:27.660> that's<00:03:27.840> I<00:03:28.079> mean<00:03:29.010> maybe

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
like fifa more so so that's I mean maybe

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.140

something<00:04:19.470> about<00:04:19.560> this<00:04:19.829> game<00:04:20.039> is<00:04:20.220> not<00:04:20.400> as<00:04:20.549> fun

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:20.729 
something about this game is not as fun

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:22.760 
something about this game is not as fun
as<00:04:20.820> blackouts<00:04:21.299> partially<00:04:21.870> because<00:04:22.019> it<00:04:22.320> is

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
as blackouts partially because it is

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:25.229 
really really difficult in comparison to

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:25.770 
really really difficult in comparison to
black<00:04:25.440> ops

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
black ops

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.780

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:27.790 
to get really good scores and black ops

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.879 
to get really good scores and black ops
going<00:04:28.270> 40<00:04:28.570> in<00:04:28.600> owen<00:04:28.840> TDM<00:04:29.139> was<00:04:29.290> relatively<00:04:29.770> easy

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:29.889 
going 40 in owen TDM was relatively easy

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:32.129 
going 40 in owen TDM was relatively easy
with<00:04:30.280> in<00:04:30.370> this<00:04:30.550> game<00:04:30.790> it's<00:04:31.030> almost<00:04:31.450> well

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:32.139 
with in this game it's almost well

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 
unless you're really really good it's

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.670

almost impossible that's why some of
your<00:04:35.919> favorite<00:04:36.400> youtubers<00:04:37.000> probably<00:04:37.540> don't

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
your favorite youtubers probably don't

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.930 
your favorite youtubers probably don't
upload<00:04:38.050> their<00:04:38.410> 40<00:04:38.800> plus<00:04:39.010> 2<00:04:39.160> games<00:04:39.340> anymore<00:04:39.669> and

upload their 40 plus 2 games anymore and

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.870 
upload their 40 plus 2 games anymore and
stuff<00:04:40.150> like<00:04:40.300> that<00:04:40.360> because<00:04:41.080> not<00:04:41.770> well<00:04:42.010> let's

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 
stuff like that because not well let's

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.690 
stuff like that because not well let's
say<00:04:43.060> a<00:04:43.090> 30-plus<00:04:43.870> TDM<00:04:44.290> is<00:04:44.520> almost<00:04:45.520> the<00:04:45.669> same

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:45.700 
say a 30-plus TDM is almost the same

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:48.960 
say a 30-plus TDM is almost the same
thing<00:04:45.880> as<00:04:46.270> a<00:04:46.450> 40<00:04:46.750> plus<00:04:46.930> 2<00:04:47.050> game<00:04:47.230> in<00:04:47.760> black<00:04:48.760> ops

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
thing as a 40 plus 2 game in black ops

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.330 
thing as a 40 plus 2 game in black ops
so<00:04:49.270> that's<00:04:49.930> kind<00:04:50.350> of<00:04:50.440> how<00:04:50.530> it<00:04:50.560> is<00:04:50.710> now<00:04:50.980> it's<00:04:51.220> a

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340 
so that's kind of how it is now it's a

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.370 
so that's kind of how it is now it's a
shame<00:04:51.639> but<00:04:51.880> I'm<00:04:52.360> still<00:04:52.600> going<00:04:52.750> to<00:04:52.870> try<00:04:53.020> my<00:04:53.139> ass

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.380

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:02.200 
that I have I am working on series I

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.780 
that I have I am working on series I
kind<00:05:02.500> of<00:05:02.650> touched<00:05:02.950> on<00:05:03.130> it<00:05:03.310> in<00:05:03.430> the<00:05:03.520> last<00:05:03.640> video

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:03.790 
kind of touched on it in the last video

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:05.250 
kind of touched on it in the last video
but<00:05:03.970> I<00:05:04.120> don't<00:05:04.300> want<00:05:04.419> to<00:05:04.480> spoil<00:05:04.690> anything<00:05:04.810> so

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:05.260 
but I don't want to spoil anything so

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:06.659 
but I don't want to spoil anything so
I'm<00:05:05.380> not<00:05:05.500> going<00:05:05.650> to<00:05:05.740> talk<00:05:05.980> about<00:05:06.130> it<00:05:06.400> it's

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:06.669 
I'm not going to talk about it it's

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:09.330 
I'm not going to talk about it it's
going<00:05:06.880> to<00:05:06.910> be<00:05:07.030> awesome<00:05:07.150> though<00:05:07.360> and<00:05:07.660> um<00:05:08.340> so

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:09.340 
going to be awesome though and um so

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:10.860 
going to be awesome though and um so
yeah<00:05:09.580> I<00:05:09.610> think<00:05:09.730> the<00:05:10.000> gameplay<00:05:10.330> is<00:05:10.390> wrapping<00:05:10.780> up

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:10.870 
yeah I think the gameplay is wrapping up

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:14.430 
yeah I think the gameplay is wrapping up
right<00:05:11.140> here<00:05:11.320> I<00:05:11.620> have<00:05:11.950> 27<00:05:12.430> kills<00:05:12.790> 28<00:05:13.570> kills<00:05:13.840> so<00:05:14.200> I

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.440 
right here I have 27 kills 28 kills so I

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.110 
right here I have 27 kills 28 kills so I
guess<00:05:14.919> two<00:05:15.100> more<00:05:15.250> kills<00:05:15.400> and<00:05:15.610> games<00:05:15.820> over

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.120 
guess two more kills and games over

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.210 
guess two more kills and games over
although<00:05:16.330> I<00:05:16.570> did<00:05:17.290> take<00:05:17.500> me<00:05:17.530> awhile<00:05:17.800> to<00:05:17.979> find
