actually<00:01:07.640> scientists<00:01:08.640> discovered<00:01:09.060> that<00:01:09.090> this

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
actually scientists discovered that this

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.289 
actually scientists discovered that this
parot<00:01:10.680> or<00:01:10.890> this<00:01:11.040> specific<00:01:11.460> ingredient

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
parot or this specific ingredient

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.770 
parot or this specific ingredient
improved<00:01:13.700> metabolism<00:01:14.700> by<00:01:14.790> 5%<00:01:15.000> full<00:01:15.689> an
