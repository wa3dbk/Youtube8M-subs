00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
coming down the pipe and from what I

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:20.599 
coming down the pipe and from what I
understand<00:02:19.469> some<00:02:19.650> of<00:02:19.680> the<00:02:19.799> recordings<00:02:20.370> or

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:20.609 
understand some of the recordings or

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:23.330 
understand some of the recordings or
writing<00:02:21.060> on<00:02:21.239> this<00:02:21.510> new<00:02:21.750> LP<00:02:22.140> here<00:02:22.500> might<00:02:23.040> date

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
writing on this new LP here might date

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.910 
writing on this new LP here might date
back<00:02:23.609> as<00:02:23.849> far<00:02:23.879> as<00:02:24.150> the<00:02:24.450> early<00:02:24.780> 2000s<00:02:25.590> but<00:02:25.709> the

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
back as far as the early 2000s but the

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.649 
back as far as the early 2000s but the
time<00:02:26.219> frame<00:02:26.609> of<00:02:26.640> the<00:02:26.819> creation<00:02:27.420> of<00:02:27.510> this

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:27.659 
time frame of the creation of this

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:31.280 
time frame of the creation of this
record<00:02:27.930> really<00:02:28.590> seems<00:02:29.599> kind<00:02:30.599> of<00:02:30.750> meaningless

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
record really seems kind of meaningless

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.740 
record really seems kind of meaningless
because<00:02:31.829> the<00:02:32.069> music<00:02:32.670> itself<00:02:33.209> just<00:02:33.450> feels<00:02:33.629> like

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
because the music itself just feels like

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.240 
because the music itself just feels like
it's<00:02:33.900> coming<00:02:34.139> from<00:02:34.170> such<00:02:34.560> a<00:02:34.590> different<00:02:34.859> place

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
it's coming from such a different place

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.780 
it's coming from such a different place
than<00:02:35.549> voodoo<00:02:36.389> and<00:02:36.629> consistently<00:02:37.560> so<00:02:37.920> there<00:02:38.579> is

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
than voodoo and consistently so there is

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.729 
than voodoo and consistently so there is
a<00:02:38.969> lot<00:02:39.239> more<00:02:39.420> live<00:02:39.689> instrumentation<00:02:40.319> on<00:02:40.590> this

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
a lot more live instrumentation on this

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.309 
a lot more live instrumentation on this
record<00:02:40.950> the<00:02:41.269> instrumentation<00:02:42.269> feels<00:02:42.780> really

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
record the instrumentation feels really

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:46.250 
record the instrumentation feels really
loose<00:02:44.010> the<00:02:44.519> vocals<00:02:45.030> are<00:02:45.359> way<00:02:45.510> freakier<00:02:46.049> on

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
loose the vocals are way freakier on

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.110 
loose the vocals are way freakier on
D'Angelo's<00:02:46.590> previous<00:02:47.280> stuff<00:02:47.519> especially<00:02:47.730> his

D'Angelo's previous stuff especially his
first<00:02:48.389> full-length<00:02:48.689> LP<00:02:49.019> I<00:02:49.260> saw<00:02:49.590> his<00:02:49.769> singing

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
first full-length LP I saw his singing

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:52.309 
first full-length LP I saw his singing
style<00:02:50.459> very<00:02:50.730> much<00:02:50.819> as<00:02:51.090> being<00:02:51.329> in<00:02:51.599> the

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
style very much as being in the

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:55.460 
style very much as being in the
archetype<00:02:52.950> of<00:02:52.980> 90s<00:02:53.609> R&amp;B<00:02:53.849> but<00:02:54.629> on<00:02:54.780> this<00:02:54.930> new<00:02:55.139> LP

worth<00:06:47.560> the<00:06:47.860> wait

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:48.130 
worth the wait

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:50.100 
worth the wait
I<00:06:48.400> wish<00:06:48.880> we<00:06:49.030> didn't<00:06:49.240> have<00:06:49.360> to<00:06:49.510> wait<00:06:49.630> for<00:06:49.870> it<00:06:49.900> as

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:50.110 
I wish we didn't have to wait for it as

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:52.710 
I wish we didn't have to wait for it as
long<00:06:50.139> as<00:06:50.380> we<00:06:50.860> did<00:06:51.190> I<00:06:51.460> wish<00:06:51.729> there<00:06:52.000> were<00:06:52.180> people

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:52.720 
long as we did I wish there were people

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:55.020 
long as we did I wish there were people
like<00:06:52.960> D'Angelo<00:06:53.560> people<00:06:54.220> who<00:06:54.340> are<00:06:54.430> as<00:06:54.550> artful

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:55.030

active in the current state of R&amp;B and I

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:06.060 
active in the current state of R&amp;B and I
think<00:07:04.570> the<00:07:04.690> fact<00:07:04.900> that<00:07:04.990> people<00:07:05.290> respond<00:07:05.800> to

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:06.070 
think the fact that people respond to

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:08.610 
think the fact that people respond to
this<00:07:06.190> record<00:07:06.460> so<00:07:06.729> positively<00:07:07.419> once<00:07:08.229> it<00:07:08.410> just

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:08.620 
this record so positively once it just
