00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640
 good is arriving pateras kilometer 18 

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:06.009
 first reference for Alberto insurance counter of the car to great lagoon 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.819
 but for us 23 well 

00:00:08.819 --> 00:00:10.959
 the time you have done 

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:13.569
 there at that point 

00:00:13.569 --> 00:00:15.379
 Andy is slow 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:17.050
 barbarian 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.130
 we'll see 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.039
 he went through that point 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:23.349
 a future son 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:27.249
 23 12 two seconds worse than here is lethal 

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:30.869
 like them a surprise later but it is undoubted at the moment it is a surprise 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:34.750
 now they would be separated by only six seconds in the standings 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.650
 general 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.560
 other dances pedro the tour is the race that are suffered until the last moment 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.850
 until the last open moment seems to me prudent above all and to all that 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.420
 before leaving from there all the content of his writing the comptroller 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.160
 you could not expect him but I think with everything is a little bit below 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.670
 Islam already loses a minute more than a minute about cancellara and in that 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.440
 yes that can be said for me that it is a very static surprise 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.670
 the against what has us accustomed after times 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.870
 two seconds just to the side 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.480
 takes six seconds from andy schleck alberto contador 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.480
 Obviously, as Pedro says, things are not coming out 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.130
 that reflection that is hair that is complicated to say that a broker has 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.240
 caught his rhythm and change it a lot 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.550
 it is difficult it is difficult four seconds passes away a little 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.550
 but to have emotion until the last meter is against the clock 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.060
 pesic it's as if we tell you about the salty river of the organizer that is played 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.180
 in the race two riders in eight seconds in the last time trial and 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.350
 that being clearly favorite the one that already goes first 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.850
 we did in those motion quotas that we are seeing right now 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.100
 3 seconds of difference 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.960
 and the athletic but also very important others as retransmitted by 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:47.789
 runner no 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:49.320
 11 seconds 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.290
 11 seconds this is important 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.180
 we are entering the second part the 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.670
 and that is very important to see that he has recovered a little bit of good time 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.680
 good what emotion until the end 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.930
 Between these two runners Alberto Alberto and Andy Schleck 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.160
 now it would be two seconds better the 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.960
 what are not seeing andy is law jian 17 kilometers a little less still 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.469
 to finish the race 

00:02:13.469 --> 00:02:18.839
 let's see record of 46 and 52 here is that I had spent two seconds better 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:24.209
 kilometer 18 now in theory it has to happen better and nine seconds in 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:24.599
 the time trial 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:25.449
 maybe 

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:27.909
 ibar that reference that they indicated to us 

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:31.210
 besides the id the leader the yellow bayern of this tour of france 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:35.290
 and grabbing to pass this jump that there was for the head cars 

00:02:36.429 --> 00:02:38.129
 in this locality 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:41.299
 we are going to see there where it stops by the notice what is the attention 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:44.699
 media of the leader the best runner of this tour of france 

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:48.149
 This year is Alberto Counter 

00:02:48.149 --> 00:02:51.149
 forty six 46 

00:02:53.169 --> 00:02:54.050
 6 7 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.050
 two best only six seconds better there 

00:02:57.669 --> 00:03:00.549
 emotion to the end without a doubt 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:02.539
 would operate the classification 

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:06.040
 15 seconds ahead now Alberto Alberto 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.450
 He lost two seconds with respect to the last reference they gave us and 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.259
 I noticed that it will be fine 

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:16.489
 more and more time every time there is a final of the race with Alberto 8 58 49 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:17.959
 there 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.959
 seven kilometers to the end of the andy schleck extension 

00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:31.459
 I'm not going to go up globally, we've already said that I expected a clear step 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:33.159
 that the Turk had given the mountain 

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:34.540
 now he is giving the contra 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.090
 to what was going to be a tough opponent 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.969
 very hard in the future by Alberto 

00:03:37.969 --> 00:03:40.159
 then the 8 32 

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:43.159
 for Alberto eight seconds 

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:51.779
 the second one does not forgive him 58 49 58 32 

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:55.229
 they are 17 seconds better 

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:58.229
 and there at 26 seconds of the general classification 

00:03:58.999 --> 00:04:04.019
 what you say about being a specialist to have references is 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:06.449
 always being the last one is important 

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:09.569
 pippa be key for victory victory 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:14.239
 Suffering from suffering and silva now to see these last 400 meters too 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:17.120
 must tianguis touch for everything exactly 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.079
 the Luxembourgian runner 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:22.330
 we are seeing without a doubt the time trial of his life 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.860
 It will not help you to win this tour of France but probably it will 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.050
 can serve to return even more confident next year 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.650
 make that new team where he's going to run with his brother and they continue 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.530
 third as director gesture of rage gesture of effort airs 2 final meters 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:42.069
 also for you is read that you will cross the finish line for one hour 

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:46.659
 seven minutes and you know how many seconds separate prohibiting seconds 

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:52.029
 one hour 0 7 good big bull great bull undoubtedly for me it is light of the tour 

00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:55.529
 you should ten days was going to be enough for him to overcome 

00:04:55.529 --> 00:05:00.900
 alberto counter yes yes yes in the end to win with a certain margin r40 made a 

00:05:00.899 --> 00:05:03.499
 hour seven minutes and 10 seconds to andy schleck 

00:05:03.499 --> 00:05:06.789
 and full of plethoric is finishing the Alberto time trial 

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:07.759
 counter 

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:11.699
 and he had to suffer here what he demanded to the fullest 

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:14.930
 he will not be able to win old 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.990
 among other things because of the very strong wind that has blown for the 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:19.860
 last runners of this time trial 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.999
 opponent has passed the crisis 

00:05:21.999 --> 00:05:24.110
 but will win the tour of france 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:27.249
 2010 

00:05:27.249 --> 00:05:29.949
 Now 6 minutes have arrived yet 

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:32.330
 thirty seconds one way 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:36.319
 the Madrid rider arrives at the car detour and the team car we go to 

00:05:36.319 --> 00:05:40.150
 see where to separate protexa lacking priísta to win the tour of france 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:42.419
 one hour 6 39 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:46.919
 Alberto Cortez much suffering will win the tour of France 2010 Pedro go 

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:51.249
 carrerón we have seen from the same to the historical historic corralón with the 

00:05:51.249 --> 00:05:55.060
 heart beating today as if it were the heart of Alberto contador 

00:05:56.509 --> 00:05:59.509
 bush not only lost 1 hour and 6 minutes of 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:02.770
 of course put an hour of suffering
