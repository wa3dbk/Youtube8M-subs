00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.930
 together and can is much more 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.369

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.890
 nobody moves 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:45.330
 the breasts were not burned and the 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:48.970
 lettuces are not in a few 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:50.660

 There's nothing left when I'm alone in this 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.610
 kitchen 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:03.159

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:06.690

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:06.690
 very good to remove them from cooling 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.740
 to this and I will continue to consider I think 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:17.090
 what is that we were 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:20.410
 in the pepper of the salt pill 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.410

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:28.070
 you have already included everything we are going to put 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.529

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.900
 To the mix 

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:36.190

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:39.000
 we raise our kitchen 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.000
 we mix 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:44.830
 the rest of the adherent we passed through 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.250
 apart for our diners from 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.250
 our family 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.730
 I think here the other artichokes of 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.730
 once 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:00.380
 are hearts or artichoke backgrounds 

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:05.119

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.440
 and cherry tomatoes 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.650
 and on top we are going to put 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.900

 a very rich salad very very fresh and 

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:43.919
