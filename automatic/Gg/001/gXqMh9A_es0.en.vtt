om HID LED headlamps what I'm about to
show<00:00:10.170> you<00:00:10.230> is<00:00:10.620> a<00:00:10.650> conversion<00:00:11.190> harness<00:00:11.490> that<00:00:12.059> I

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
show you is a conversion harness that I

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.230 
show you is a conversion harness that I
created<00:00:12.719> to<00:00:14.150> accept<00:00:15.150> these<00:00:15.500> headlamps<00:00:17.240> into

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.970 

as<00:00:57.150> you<00:00:57.300> can<00:00:57.450> see<00:00:57.600> here's<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:58.110> daytime<00:00:58.800> red

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
as you can see here's the daytime red

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.350 
as you can see here's the daytime red
lights<00:00:59.190> in<00:00:59.460> the<00:01:00.390> full<00:01:00.630> power<00:01:00.900> mode<00:01:02.360> when

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:03.360 
lights in the full power mode when

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.300 
lights in the full power mode when
you're<00:01:03.510> running<00:01:03.660> around<00:01:03.870> during<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.410> day

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.210 

whenever<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.610> turn<00:01:09.390> signal<00:01:09.960> is<00:01:10.220> initialized

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
whenever the turn signal is initialized

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.120 
whenever the turn signal is initialized
on<00:01:11.610> these<00:01:11.970> headlamps<00:01:12.690> the<00:01:13.650> daytime<00:01:14.100> running

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
on these headlamps the daytime running

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.890 
on these headlamps the daytime running
light<00:01:14.580> will<00:01:15.000> go<00:01:15.180> off<00:01:16.850> making<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.180> turn<00:01:18.479> signal

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
light will go off making the turn signal

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.310 
light will go off making the turn signal
more<00:01:19.080> visible<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:20.010> oncoming<00:01:20.130> traffic<00:01:20.850> so<00:01:21.320> what

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
more visible to oncoming traffic so what

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.850 
more visible to oncoming traffic so what
I<00:01:22.350> did<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:23.240> make<00:01:24.240> this<00:01:24.570> work<00:01:24.900> was<00:01:25.440> build<00:01:25.710> a

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
I did to make this work was build a

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.660 
I did to make this work was build a
control<00:01:26.370> board<00:01:26.640> that<00:01:27.530> turns<00:01:28.530> off<00:01:28.830> the<00:01:29.270> DRL<00:01:30.270> and

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
control board that turns off the DRL and

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.370 
control board that turns off the DRL and
keeps<00:01:32.670> it<00:01:32.850> off<00:01:33.030> for<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.570> duration<00:01:33.900> of<00:01:34.229> the

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
keeps it off for the duration of the

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.960 
keeps it off for the duration of the
turn<00:01:34.590> signal<00:01:35.330> now<00:01:36.330> this<00:01:36.630> is<00:01:36.900> all<00:01:37.080> built<00:01:37.350> in<00:01:37.970> to

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
turn signal now this is all built in to

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.840 
turn signal now this is all built in to
the<00:01:39.119> body<00:01:39.300> control<00:01:39.810> module<00:01:39.990> on<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.850> higher

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
the body control module on the higher

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.639 
the body control module on the higher
end<00:01:42.149> jeeps<00:01:42.420> with<00:01:42.630> these<00:01:42.840> headlights<00:01:43.229> equipped

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
end jeeps with these headlights equipped

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.130 
end jeeps with these headlights equipped
so<00:01:44.220> I<00:01:44.250> had<00:01:44.729> to<00:01:44.850> build<00:01:45.000> this<00:01:45.210> externally<00:01:45.930> and

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
so I had to build this externally and

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.370 
so I had to build this externally and
incorporate<00:01:46.890> it<00:01:47.040> into<00:01:47.250> this<00:01:47.520> harness<00:01:48.380> so

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
incorporate it into this harness so

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:56.840 
incorporate it into this harness so
here's<00:01:49.649> what<00:01:49.920> it<00:01:50.040> looks<00:01:50.790> like<00:01:54.020> and<00:01:55.520> as<00:01:56.520> soon<00:01:56.700> as

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
here's what it looks like and as soon as

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.050 
here's what it looks like and as soon as
the<00:01:57.030> turn<00:01:57.240> signal<00:01:57.660> is<00:01:57.810> done<00:01:58.670> the<00:01:59.670> daytime

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
the turn signal is done the daytime

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.930 
the turn signal is done the daytime
running<00:02:00.090> light<00:02:00.420> will<00:02:00.540> come<00:02:00.720> back<00:02:00.930> on<00:02:01.580> it<00:02:02.580> is

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 
running light will come back on it is

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:08.080 
running light will come back on it is
all<00:02:03.120> solid-state<00:02:03.720> circuitry<00:02:05.120> now<00:02:06.120> when<00:02:06.540> the

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
all solid-state circuitry now when the

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.940 
all solid-state circuitry now when the
automatic<00:02:09.090> headlights<00:02:09.660> or<00:02:10.410> automatic

automatic headlights or automatic
headlight<00:02:11.430> function<00:02:12.150> on<00:02:12.360> your<00:02:12.690> Jeep<00:02:13.590> turns<00:02:14.160> on

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
headlight function on your Jeep turns on

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.570 
headlight function on your Jeep turns on
the<00:02:14.640> low<00:02:15.000> beam<00:02:15.239> and<00:02:15.540> the<00:02:15.720> parking<00:02:16.110> lights<00:02:16.580> for

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
the low beam and the parking lights for

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.140 
the low beam and the parking lights for
when<00:02:18.450> it<00:02:18.570> gets<00:02:18.690> dark<00:02:19.049> out<00:02:19.320> the<00:02:19.739> LEDs<00:02:20.730> will<00:02:20.970> dim

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
when it gets dark out the LEDs will dim

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:28.220 
when it gets dark out the LEDs will dim
down<00:02:25.580> so<00:02:26.580> that's<00:02:27.330> what<00:02:27.540> they<00:02:27.660> look<00:02:27.690> like<00:02:27.840> when

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
down so that's what they look like when

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.199 
down so that's what they look like when
they're<00:02:28.320> dimmed<00:02:28.590> out<00:02:28.799> at<00:02:28.980> night<00:02:29.160> and<00:02:30.049> the<00:02:32.209> low

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
they're dimmed out at night and the low

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:37.030 
they're dimmed out at night and the low
beams<00:02:33.510> for<00:02:33.930> the<00:02:34.549> HIDs<00:02:35.549> will<00:02:35.790> power<00:02:36.000> up<00:02:36.120> as<00:02:36.420> well

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040
