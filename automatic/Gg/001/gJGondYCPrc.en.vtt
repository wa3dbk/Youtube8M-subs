00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 Recently, I began to notice that 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.350
 the market has somehow become less youth 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.630
 no smartphones 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.330
 smart phones with stylish looks 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.019
 the same colorful and bright microsoft or 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.960
 lenovo 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:19.170
 but somehow they all look alike 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.199
 sometimes I want something that stands out 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.130
 not just acid colors well 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.130
 sweetie though 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.090
 Hello everyone, she caught in this review 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.460
 from hello company i will tell you about 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.829
 stylish and youth smartphone htc 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.320
 desire 500 26 g 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:40.850
 well, or as it is called look for sit 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.960
 for i 526 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:47.420
 $ 7 there is also version 526 j + 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.339
 it and on the 8-core processor and 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:53.059
 more colors 

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:55.070
 but our 526 g is much more affordable that 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:57.949
 now as relevant as ever 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.350
 about colors and and options 2 stealth 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:02.199
 black matte black needle sirbu 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.000
 I got exactly the second option 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:07.939
 notice that in this color coating 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.010
 glossy color can be described as white with 

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:11.030
 dark turquoise edging she 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.390
 dark blue 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.960
 yes no she is dark turquoise dark blue 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:20.000
 and the dresses under you were white and gold 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.920
 smartphone looks unusual display like 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.380
 be slightly raised above the body 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.189
 plastic case with pleasant to the touch 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.590
 and seemingly 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:30.770
 roundness on the front panel two 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:34.100
 dynamics is the most recognizable feature of htc 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:36.740
 like clay uh-60 speaker is actually 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.109
 only one upper and the second lower one 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.630
 little designer trick between 

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:43.909
 display speakers and front camera 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.490
 all controls are as much as whole 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:49.100
 two on the right side of the smartphone this button 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.530
 turning on and locking the smartphone as well 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.079
 volume rocker left side device 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.630
 empty on the top butt minijack and on 

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:58.999
 bottom microusb and microphone on the cover 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.770
 devices camera with flash microphone 

00:01:58.999 --> 00:02:03.109
 for video and manufacturer logo 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.729
 under it is a removable battery 

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:07.729
 and also slots for two simok and 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:10.039
 microdisks like a little design for me 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:12.050
 gives retro futurism especially in this 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:15.020
 colors but it can not not like 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:17.180
 this is his main external zest 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.760
 device size allows you to manage with 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.790
 one hand without difficulty design 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.550
 526 g powerful enough to handle 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:28.400
 with most of the tasks 4 nuclear processor 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:30.800
 with a frequency of 1 and 3 gigahertz can be 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.420
 this is not the most powerful percent but lack of 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.819
 performance you hardly 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.680
 feel the ram too 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:38.410
 enough for comfortable work 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.300
 with the device internally 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.700
 memory a bit but for most 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:46.000
 users and that's enough there and 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:48.640
 micro sd support up to 32 GB 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.220
 in terms of communication and navigation protocols, everything 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.560
 standard anything supernatural you 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.020
 here you will not find a smartphone powered by 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.880
 removable battery of its capacity is quite 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.980
 enough for two days of moderate 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.020
 use the display of this smartphone 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.570
 ideal for those who want 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.430
 change an old dialer to a modern one 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:09.340
 smartphone but scared of devices with 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:11.770
 diagonals 5 inches and higher it has to and 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.600
 hd resolution is enough for 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:16.660
 such a diagonal color is pretty 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.790
 good viewing angles 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.070
 brightness, in principle, enough for the sun 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.170
 the display remains relatively readable 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:25.390
 low resolution may be noticeable 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.820
 only when watching a video and even then 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:30.730
 detailed very close examination 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:34.210
 maybe a display and not a record holder 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:36.700
 made as a camera htc desire is 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:39.040
 a 26 g confident average 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.900
 remarkably good flash performance and 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.030
 pictures and videos are quite 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.980
 Decent front camera is quite 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.170
 come down for selfies and video calls 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.390
 look at these very selfies 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:52.510
 and video calls you will be quality 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:55.360

 running android 4 4 2 kit kat with 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.720
 brand interface sense 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.850
 more familiar with the interface 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.700
 you can here it is this video 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:06.310
