00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:12.509
 d 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:14.790
 if from here the coconut fiber is very cheap 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.890
 you can because there is also microlite only 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.130
 that if you can see miccoli was medium 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.810
 cup I also put half a cup of 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.310
 coconut fiber 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.570
 I cut her a little bit more than I 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:32.450
 it was too long so it was a glass of 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:34.170
 ground vegetable half cup of coconut fiber 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:38.460
 right 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:43.320
 I also put a glass of manure 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:49.559
 and put some of the flour 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:57.360
 bone and a spoonful of 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:01:01.289
 castor and a spoon of one and I'll do 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:04.460
 then my plantation 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:11.490
 to make it germinate in the case that I'm going to use 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:16.710
 Pepper seeds finger girl gets 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:18.430
 more or less so, it 's more fun than this 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.960
 way here 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:25.570
 the future well exposed here at home that I 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:29.260
 I put the little spoon of each one of them 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:31.780
 because there's a safe here of manure 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.880
 corral in the short time and another three 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:37.110
 spoonful of a June was not because 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.110
 I had it here but it's optional 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:45.490
 So I prepare packaging can be 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.770
 anyone can not use varzim can 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.020
 To use plastic body is just to make the hole. 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:54.340
 cut it down then the muse goes 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:56.380
 being transplanted can also use the 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.590
 ice cream carton packaging 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:04.110
 yogurt a low bottle of water what 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.110
 you want you make the cut 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.790
 my finger is dry but you can 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.050
 Doing this with any pepper can 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.660
 do this to me and chili 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:30.980
 complemented any kind of yellow 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:35.690
 chili can not bc do not need 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:39.250
 let fall and fall because the seed 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.250
 needs to stay together 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:50.740
 share comments if you want 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:54.110
 watching my friends videos on a 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:57.590
 video with friends and my friends 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.910

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.630

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:12.070
 light and I'm going to plant my people 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:17.360
 somewhat Akron a good planting and to all 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:23.660
 now the fish the cup and went singing the 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:27.260
 Very easy seedlings only you get the 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:31.010
 and put there where you want it 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:36.440
 buy water for three because it 's easy there 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:40.270
 but weak 20 always discards last 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:43.690
 the weakest is only with the strong 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:45.130
 by 3 votes to 3 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:49.750
 now I come with a little more 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:51.550
 days of vegetable soil and only plays on top 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:56.140
 and not only is the 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:58.540
 cover was ready 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:01.240
 I'll get it and put some water in it. 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:04.680
 to obey and I will cover only that as 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.680
 I'll collect it here, I can use it 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.820
 our arlington 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.530
 so I can use a plastic like 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:17.080
 that 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:21.760
 right after using a cap I can use 

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:24.340
 also the leaf of the morning 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:27.610
 Anyway, I'll cover for 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:32.140
 leave the land there warm 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:34.180
 seed and that 's only because she needs 

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:37.000
 only getting a descent to germinate does not 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:40.690
 need to look over and when they 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.840
 are germinated then I put 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:47.200
 belluf can be a solar indirect light 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:49.810
 may be an artificial indirect light in 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:55.600
 The rest you know, do not wait to grow up. 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:58.770
 15-day old lady put it on the 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:03.060
 place with plenty of light 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:07.800
 and then wait there for 90 or 100 days and 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:09.930
 depending on the peppercorns welcomed people 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.520
 leaving is planted this way 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:15.270
 You can plant any time then. 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:17.610
 anybody first remembering that they 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:19.409
 may take from seven to thirty days page 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:23.310
 more adidas experiments take more 

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:25.259
