I'm<00:00:32.730> going<00:00:32.940> to<00:00:33.000> use<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.329> SEM<00:00:33.600> coat<00:00:33.870> on<00:00:34.050> this

I'm going to use the SEM coat on this

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.840 
I'm going to use the SEM coat on this
slab<00:00:34.590> because<00:00:34.890> it<00:00:35.130> has<00:00:35.250> a<00:00:35.280> much<00:00:35.579> lighter

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
slab because it has a much lighter

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
to be applied very thinly so when you're

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.069 
to be applied very thinly so when you're
applying<00:00:41.129> it<00:00:41.489> you<00:00:41.910> have<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.210> take<00:00:42.360> a<00:00:42.420> ruler<00:00:42.750> and

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
applying it you have to take a ruler and

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.410 
applying it you have to take a ruler and
we're<00:00:43.890> going<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.040> roll<00:00:44.340> this<00:00:44.550> product<00:00:44.969> out<00:00:45.120> and

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
we're going to roll this product out and

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.360 
we're going to roll this product out and
continue<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.379> make<00:00:46.530> sure<00:00:46.770> that<00:00:46.980> it's<00:00:47.160> then

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
continue to make sure that it's then

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.729 
continue to make sure that it's then
throughout<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.760> entire<00:00:48.239> project<00:00:48.570> now<00:00:49.530> on<00:00:49.710> a

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
throughout the entire project now on a

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.470 
throughout the entire project now on a
slab<00:00:50.070> like<00:00:50.309> this<00:00:50.579> where<00:00:50.820> we<00:00:50.969> actually<00:00:51.120> have<00:00:51.449> a

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
slab like this where we actually have a

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.869 
slab like this where we actually have a
pattern<00:00:51.989> it's<00:00:52.440> best<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.890> use<00:00:53.129> our<00:00:53.309> freestyle

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
pattern it's best to use our freestyle

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.209 
pattern it's best to use our freestyle
simply<00:00:54.690> because<00:00:55.020> in<00:00:55.260> these<00:00:55.440> deeper<00:00:55.890> grooves

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
simply because in these deeper grooves

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.520 
simply because in these deeper grooves
it's<00:00:56.760> harder<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.329> get<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.660> SEM<00:00:57.899> coat<00:00:58.170> out<00:00:58.350> of

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
it's harder to get the SEM coat out of

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.010 
it's harder to get the SEM coat out of
there<00:00:58.680> SEM<00:00:59.399> coat<00:00:59.670> if<00:00:59.789> it's<00:00:59.969> left<00:01:00.210> thick<00:01:00.570> it

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
there SEM coat if it's left thick it

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.460 
there SEM coat if it's left thick it
will<00:01:01.199> actually<00:01:01.410> shrink<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.480> dust<00:01:03.480> off<00:01:03.780> so

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
will actually shrink and dust off so

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.870 
will actually shrink and dust off so
when<00:01:04.650> you<00:01:04.769> apply<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.129> sim<00:01:05.519> coat

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
when you apply the sim coat

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.969 
when you apply the sim coat
always<00:01:06.180> remember<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.689> keep<00:01:06.840> it<00:01:07.020> very<00:01:07.350> thin<00:01:07.710> and

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
always remember to keep it very thin and

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.370 
always remember to keep it very thin and
use<00:01:08.520> it<00:01:08.670> only<00:01:08.820> on<00:01:09.000> lightly<00:01:09.360> textured<00:01:09.900> slapped

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
use it only on lightly textured slapped

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.429 
use it only on lightly textured slapped
like<00:01:11.130> this<00:01:11.369> textured<00:01:11.850> skin<00:01:12.119> slab<00:01:12.900> that<00:01:13.140> we<00:01:13.260> did

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
like this textured skin slab that we did

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.179 
like this textured skin slab that we did
with<00:01:13.590> our<00:01:13.740> blue<00:01:14.010> stone

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:15.189

-<00:01:15.310> on<00:01:15.609> this<00:01:16.270> slab<00:01:16.509> I<00:01:16.929> use<00:01:17.380> two<00:01:17.770> applications<00:01:18.039> of

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
- on this slab I use two applications of

- on this slab I use two applications of
our<00:01:18.819> eh<00:01:19.210> to<00:01:19.509> really<00:01:19.840> make<00:01:20.049> sure<00:01:20.079> that<00:01:20.289> I<00:01:20.499> open

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
our eh to really make sure that I open
