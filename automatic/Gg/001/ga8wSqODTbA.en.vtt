00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
tabs into one iPad and you know that's

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.030 
tabs into one iPad and you know that's
one<00:01:09.180> thing<00:01:09.360> that<00:01:09.570> I<00:01:09.600> have<00:01:10.049> to<00:01:10.080> go<00:01:10.590> with<00:01:10.740> apple

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
one thing that I have to go with apple

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.710 
one thing that I have to go with apple
on<00:01:11.159> for<00:01:11.430> me<00:01:11.520> personally<00:01:11.729> if<00:01:12.240> you're<00:01:12.390> going<00:01:12.600> to

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
on for me personally if you're going to

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.270 
on for me personally if you're going to
that<00:01:12.990> this<00:01:13.110> isn't<00:01:13.439> small<00:01:13.619> enough<00:01:13.860> to<00:01:13.920> carry

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
that this isn't small enough to carry

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.550 
that this isn't small enough to carry
around<00:01:14.369> so<00:01:15.180> I<00:01:15.210> think<00:01:15.479> that<00:01:15.720> if<00:01:15.900> you<00:01:15.960> get<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.140> pack

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
around so I think that if you get a pack

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.719 
around so I think that if you get a pack
something<00:01:16.799> with<00:01:17.040> you<00:01:17.189> might<00:01:17.400> as<00:01:17.490> well<00:01:17.610> go<00:01:17.700> with

something with you might as well go with
a<00:01:17.850> bigger<00:01:17.909> screen<00:01:18.119> well<00:01:18.570> if<00:01:18.750> you've<00:01:18.869> got<00:01:19.020> big

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
a bigger screen well if you've got big

kind<00:01:34.920> of<00:01:35.009> liking<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.460> size<00:01:35.700> I<00:01:35.939> find<00:01:36.210> it<00:01:36.360> a<00:01:36.420> lot

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
kind of liking the size I find it a lot

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.210 
kind of liking the size I find it a lot
easier<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:37.259> carry<00:01:37.500> around<00:01:37.619> you<00:01:37.860> can<00:01:38.009> see<00:01:38.040> that

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
easier to carry around you can see that

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.980 
easier to carry around you can see that
fits<00:01:38.430> right<00:01:38.579> in<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.790> palm<00:01:38.970> of<00:01:39.030> my<00:01:39.270> hand<00:01:39.509> so

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
fits right in the palm of my hand so

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.870 
fits right in the palm of my hand so
when<00:01:40.290> I'm<00:01:40.409> reading<00:01:40.680> things<00:01:41.040> like<00:01:41.250> books<00:01:41.520> or

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
when I'm reading things like books or

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.899 
when I'm reading things like books or
websites<00:01:42.390> is<00:01:42.930> it's<00:01:43.470> easy<00:01:43.829> to<00:01:44.130> just<00:01:44.430> just<00:01:44.790> to

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
websites is it's easy to just just to

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.280 
websites is it's easy to just just to
have<00:01:45.060> that<00:01:45.210> there<00:01:45.420> I<00:01:45.540> think<00:01:45.840> that<00:01:45.869> one<00:01:46.110> thing

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
have that there I think that one thing

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.630 
have that there I think that one thing
about<00:01:46.500> being<00:01:46.740> a<00:01:46.829> little<00:01:47.070> bit<00:01:47.159> bigger<00:01:47.340> in<00:01:47.490> size

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
about being a little bit bigger in size

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.190 
about being a little bit bigger in size
is<00:01:47.939> we're<00:01:48.090> definitely<00:01:48.270> a<00:01:48.659> longer<00:01:49.020> battery

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
is we're definitely a longer battery

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.740 
is we're definitely a longer battery
life<00:01:49.470> than<00:01:50.430> in<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.670> galaxy<00:01:51.060> tab<00:01:51.270> because

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
life than in the galaxy tab because

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.300 
life than in the galaxy tab because
obviously<00:01:52.079> we<00:01:52.380> can<00:01:52.500> fit<00:01:52.680> a<00:01:52.710> bigger<00:01:52.950> battery

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
obviously we can fit a bigger battery

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.920 
obviously we can fit a bigger battery
inside<00:01:53.549> of<00:01:53.700> it<00:01:53.790> expand<00:01:54.210> abilities<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:54.810> other

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
factor here is well the galaxy tab right

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.290 
factor here is well the galaxy tab right
out<00:03:04.140> of<00:03:04.170> the<00:03:04.320> gates<00:03:04.530> their<00:03:05.130> model<00:03:05.370> has<00:03:05.550> 3g<00:03:06.120> and

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
out of the gates their model has 3g and

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.940 
out of the gates their model has 3g and
Wi-Fi<00:03:06.360> built<00:03:06.930> in<00:03:07.110> so<00:03:07.470> they<00:03:07.590> don't<00:03:07.740> have<00:03:07.890> a

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
Wi-Fi built in so they don't have a

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.950 
Wi-Fi built in so they don't have a
Wi-Fi<00:03:08.400> only<00:03:08.430> model<00:03:08.760> yet<00:03:09.150> apparently<00:03:09.750> it<00:03:09.840> is

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:09.960 
Wi-Fi only model yet apparently it is

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.440 
Wi-Fi only model yet apparently it is
coming<00:03:10.230> there<00:03:10.500> you<00:03:10.560> go<00:03:10.680> so<00:03:11.160> I<00:03:11.190> hands<00:03:11.910> down<00:03:12.180> for

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
coming there you go so I hands down for

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.290 
coming there you go so I hands down for
me<00:03:12.510> I<00:03:12.810> think<00:03:13.380> bigger<00:03:13.530> is<00:03:13.620> better<00:03:13.830> I'm<00:03:14.790> like<00:03:15.180> in

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
me I think bigger is better I'm like in

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:16.550 
me I think bigger is better I'm like in
the<00:03:15.390> smaller<00:03:15.630> form<00:03:15.930> factor<00:03:15.990> here<00:03:16.410> and<00:03:16.500> I'm

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
the smaller form factor here and I'm

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.290 
the smaller form factor here and I'm
going<00:03:16.650> to<00:03:16.710> keep<00:03:16.920> trying<00:03:17.430> this<00:03:17.640> out<00:03:17.820> and<00:03:18.000> see

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
going to keep trying this out and see

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:19.790 
going to keep trying this out and see
how<00:03:18.420> it<00:03:18.600> works<00:03:18.630> for<00:03:18.900> me<00:03:18.990> but<00:03:19.020> you<00:03:19.440> know<00:03:19.560> we'll

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
how it works for me but you know we'll

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:25.640 
how it works for me but you know we'll
let<00:03:19.920> you<00:03:20.040> be<00:03:20.070> the<00:03:20.250> judge

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.709
