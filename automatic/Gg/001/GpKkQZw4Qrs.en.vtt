and<00:00:50.670> why<00:00:51.539> use<00:00:51.780> gas<00:00:52.140> when<00:00:52.559> you<00:00:52.649> can<00:00:52.860> go<00:00:53.100> electric

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
and why use gas when you can go electric

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.420 
and why use gas when you can go electric
you<00:00:54.480> can<00:00:54.719> juice<00:00:54.960> up<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.260> tango<00:00:55.710> in<00:00:55.890> as<00:00:56.039> little<00:00:56.219> as

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
you can juice up a tango in as little as

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.490 
you can juice up a tango in as little as
10<00:00:56.699> minutes<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.449> facts<00:00:57.690> that<00:00:57.840> make<00:00:58.079> electric

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
10 minutes the facts that make electric

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.560 
10 minutes the facts that make electric
work<00:00:58.710> in<00:00:58.920> this<00:00:59.039> case<00:00:59.280> or<00:00:59.579> one<00:00:59.760> that<00:01:00.300> the

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
work in this case or one that the

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.360 
work in this case or one that the
average<00:01:00.719> commutes<00:01:01.199> only<00:01:01.440> 20<00:01:01.770> miles<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.309> this

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
average commutes only 20 miles and this

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.100 
average commutes only 20 miles and this
will<00:01:02.550> go<00:01:02.640> four<00:01:02.850> times<00:01:03.120> at<00:01:03.390> 80<00:01:03.629> miles

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
will go four times at 80 miles

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
not beat me I love to meet him at a

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.200 
not beat me I love to meet him at a
stoplight<00:01:25.220> 0-60<00:01:26.220> out<00:01:26.340> fast<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:26.970> of<00:01:27.030> course

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
stoplight 0-60 out fast and of course

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.620 
stoplight 0-60 out fast and of course
that<00:01:27.420> comes<00:01:28.700> the<00:01:29.700> way<00:01:29.820> it's<00:01:30.000> geared<00:01:30.240> it'll<00:01:30.479> do

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
that comes the way it's geared it'll do

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.990 
that comes the way it's geared it'll do
130<00:01:31.439> miles<00:01:31.710> an<00:01:31.890> hour<00:01:32.070> and<00:01:32.430> we<00:01:32.520> figured<00:01:32.850> it's

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
130 miles an hour and we figured it's

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.580 
130 miles an hour and we figured it's
very<00:01:33.210> important<00:01:33.630> that<00:01:33.780> it<00:01:33.900> doesn't<00:01:34.200> have<00:01:34.320> any

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
very important that it doesn't have any

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.590 
very important that it doesn't have any
tendency<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.250> tip<00:01:35.430> over<00:01:35.610> at<00:01:35.880> all<00:01:36.000> so<00:01:36.299> we<00:01:36.420> went

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
tendency to tip over at all so we went

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.450 
tendency to tip over at all so we went
to<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.750> extreme<00:01:37.020> putting<00:01:37.470> in<00:01:37.560> 25<00:01:38.009> batteries

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
to the extreme putting in 25 batteries

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.010 
to the extreme putting in 25 batteries
and<00:01:38.610> that's<00:01:38.729> a<00:01:38.850> 2,000<00:01:39.420> pounds<00:01:39.720> under<00:01:39.900> the

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
and that's a 2,000 pounds under the

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.749 
and that's a 2,000 pounds under the
floor<00:01:40.259> so<00:01:40.950> that<00:01:41.070> it<00:01:41.159> would<00:01:41.250> corner<00:01:41.549> like<00:01:41.729> a

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
floor so that it would corner like a

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.500 
floor so that it would corner like a
Porsche<00:01:42.180> as<00:01:42.360> well

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:43.510 
Porsche as well

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.260 
Porsche as well
as<00:01:43.780> fun<00:01:44.620> as<00:01:44.740> it<00:01:44.770> is<00:01:44.920> to<00:01:45.040> watch<00:01:45.400> the<00:01:45.430> car<00:01:45.940> it's

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
as fun as it is to watch the car it's
