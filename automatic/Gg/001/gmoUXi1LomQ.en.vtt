00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:28.910 
the thing we only had two cups left all

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.200 
the thing we only had two cups left all
right<00:01:29.060> there<00:01:29.240> we<00:01:29.360> have<00:01:29.540> it<00:01:29.690> guys

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
right there we have it guys

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.820 
right there we have it guys
not<00:01:32.210> too<00:01:32.450> bad<00:01:32.630> for<00:01:32.690> all<00:01:33.020> the<00:01:33.140> problems<00:01:33.530> we<00:01:33.650> have

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 
not too bad for all the problems we have

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.200 
not too bad for all the problems we have
we<00:01:34.040> did<00:01:34.220> over<00:01:34.550> cut<00:01:35.290> right<00:01:36.290> here<00:01:37.030> with<00:01:38.030> the

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
we did over cut right here with the

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.740 
we did over cut right here with the
Metabo<00:01:38.960> I<00:01:39.970> think<00:01:40.970> that<00:01:41.150> should<00:01:41.330> be<00:01:41.360> helping<00:01:41.690> to

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
Metabo I think that should be helping to

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.980 
Metabo I think that should be helping to
file<00:01:41.960> that<00:01:42.200> out<00:01:42.410> and<00:01:42.680> I<00:01:43.540> think<00:01:44.540> we<00:01:44.750> can<00:01:44.840> cover

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
file that out and I think we can cover

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.540 
file that out and I think we can cover
that<00:01:45.110> up<00:01:45.260> especially<00:01:45.620> when<00:01:45.890> we<00:01:46.040> clicked<00:01:46.310> our

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:46.550 
that up especially when we clicked our

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:47.980 
that up especially when we clicked our
new<00:01:47.000> channel<00:01:47.330> on<00:01:47.540> here

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
new channel on here

imperfections but what we need to do now
is<00:01:54.430> taking<00:01:55.430> the<00:01:55.580> file<00:01:55.900> and<00:01:56.900> clean<00:01:57.350> up<00:01:57.470> some<00:01:57.500> of

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
is taking the file and clean up some of

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:05.410 
is taking the file and clean up some of
these<00:01:57.860> holes<00:01:59.950> so<00:02:00.950> you<00:02:01.130> can<00:02:01.280> see<00:02:01.520> Oh<00:02:04.270> bring<00:02:05.270> this

these holes so you can see Oh bring this

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.249 
these holes so you can see Oh bring this
closer<00:02:05.660> for<00:02:06.050> you<00:02:06.400> you<00:02:07.400> can<00:02:07.580> see<00:02:07.820> that<00:02:08.259> it

closer for you you can see that it

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.020 
closer for you you can see that it
leaves<00:02:09.440> like<00:02:09.649> a<00:02:09.679> little<00:02:09.979> bird<00:02:10.190> now<00:02:10.729> on<00:02:10.910> the

side so we need to file this down a

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:53.890 
side so we need to file this down a
little<00:02:16.040> bit

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:03:12.460

went<00:03:30.810> ahead<00:03:30.870> and<00:03:31.110> cleaned<00:03:31.290> up<00:03:31.380> all<00:03:31.560> the<00:03:31.590> holes

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:32.240 
went ahead and cleaned up all the holes

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.520 
went ahead and cleaned up all the holes
as<00:03:33.240> you<00:03:33.300> can<00:03:33.540> see<00:03:33.750> they<00:03:33.930> they<00:03:34.230> look<00:03:34.380> pretty

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
as you can see they they look pretty

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.220 
as you can see they they look pretty
good<00:03:35.090> there's<00:03:36.090> one<00:03:36.270> spot<00:03:36.540> right<00:03:36.720> here<00:03:36.780> where<00:03:37.200> I

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
good there's one spot right here where I

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.620 
good there's one spot right here where I
had<00:03:37.380> over<00:03:37.590> shot<00:03:37.860> with<00:03:38.040> the<00:03:38.130> Metabo<00:03:38.630> but

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
had over shot with the Metabo but

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.090 
had over shot with the Metabo but
that'll<00:03:39.900> be<00:03:39.930> covered<00:03:40.290> up<00:03:40.410> so<00:03:40.680> I<00:03:40.710> don't<00:03:40.830> think

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
that'll be covered up so I don't think

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.550 
that'll be covered up so I don't think
I'm<00:03:41.220> too<00:03:41.460> concerned<00:03:41.820> with<00:03:41.910> that<00:03:42.200> but<00:03:43.200> overall

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
I'm too concerned with that but overall

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.210 
I'm too concerned with that but overall
the<00:03:44.180> holes<00:03:45.180> turned<00:03:45.420> out<00:03:45.540> pretty<00:03:45.660> good<00:03:46.220> anyway

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
the holes turned out pretty good anyway

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.730 
the holes turned out pretty good anyway
I<00:03:47.250> did<00:03:47.520> give<00:03:47.730> it<00:03:47.760> a<00:03:47.940> quick<00:03:48.210> sanding<00:03:48.660> and<00:03:48.870> then<00:03:49.650> I

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:49.740 
I did give it a quick sanding and then I

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.140 
I did give it a quick sanding and then I
did<00:03:49.890> a<00:03:49.920> once-over<00:03:50.370> with<00:03:50.550> some<00:03:50.880> rubbing

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
did a once-over with some rubbing

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.170 
did a once-over with some rubbing
alcohol<00:03:51.270> and<00:03:52.190> it<00:03:53.190> turned<00:03:53.400> out<00:03:53.490> pretty<00:03:53.550> good<00:03:53.880> so

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
alcohol and it turned out pretty good so

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.330 
alcohol and it turned out pretty good so
let<00:03:54.990> me<00:03:55.080> put<00:03:55.260> down<00:03:55.440> the<00:03:55.620> camera<00:03:56.010> and<00:03:56.220> we'll

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
let me put down the camera and we'll

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.370 
let me put down the camera and we'll
throw<00:03:56.580> the<00:03:56.700> motherboard<00:03:57.060> on<00:03:57.210> see<00:03:58.110> how<00:03:58.140> that

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
throw the motherboard on see how that

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:22.189 
throw the motherboard on see how that
looks

00:04:22.189 --> 00:04:22.199 

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:25.189 

if<00:04:23.199> you<00:04:23.349> can<00:04:23.500> see<00:04:23.680> it<00:04:23.830> looks<00:04:23.979> pretty<00:04:24.129> good

00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:25.199 
if you can see it looks pretty good

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:29.610 
if you can see it looks pretty good
let's<00:04:26.199> take<00:04:26.469> it<00:04:26.680> a<00:04:26.710> closer<00:04:27.009> look<00:04:27.310> at<00:04:28.500> that<00:04:29.500> I'll

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
let's take it a closer look at that I'll

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:35.429 
let's take it a closer look at that I'll
be<00:04:29.740> for<00:04:29.979> the<00:04:30.870> 24<00:04:31.870> pin<00:04:32.310> power<00:04:33.310> supply<00:04:34.439> that'll

00:04:35.429 --> 00:04:35.439 
be for the 24 pin power supply that'll

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:38.159 
be for the 24 pin power supply that'll
be<00:04:35.560> for<00:04:35.860> the<00:04:36.599> cables<00:04:37.599> that<00:04:37.689> are<00:04:37.719> coming<00:04:38.050> from

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:38.169 
be for the cables that are coming from

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:42.300 
be for the cables that are coming from
