the right trigger 2 or a shoot button to

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.429 
the right trigger 2 or a shoot button to
smash<00:01:23.549> is<00:01:24.299> if<00:01:24.540> you<00:01:24.659> smash<00:01:24.869> on<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.110> ground<00:01:25.290> you

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
smash is if you smash on the ground you

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:26.630 
smash is if you smash on the ground you
do<00:01:25.530> lunch<00:01:25.710> forward<00:01:26.100> if<00:01:26.159> you<00:01:26.220> smash<00:01:26.430> in<00:01:26.549> there

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
do lunch forward if you smash in there

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.920 
do lunch forward if you smash in there
you<00:01:26.820> go<00:01:26.909> straight<00:01:27.180> down<00:01:27.210> i<00:01:27.360> really<00:01:27.689> think<00:01:27.810> that

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
you go straight down i really think that

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.899 
you go straight down i really think that
the<00:01:28.110> air<00:01:28.259> smash<00:01:28.619> should<00:01:29.130> keep<00:01:29.640> your<00:01:29.820> momentum

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
the air smash should keep your momentum

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.340 
the air smash should keep your momentum
going<00:01:30.360> in<00:01:30.479> that<00:01:30.540> direction<00:01:30.600> because<00:01:31.020> it<00:01:31.229> is

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
going in that direction because it is

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.410 
going in that direction because it is
not<00:01:31.530> really<00:01:31.740> that<00:01:31.860> effective<00:01:32.490> smashing<00:01:33.329> in

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
not really that effective smashing in

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.969 
not really that effective smashing in
there<00:01:33.509> but<00:01:33.720> is<00:01:33.840> a<00:01:33.869> really<00:01:34.439> really<00:01:34.470> cool<00:01:34.680> thing

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
there but is a really really cool thing

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.100 
there but is a really really cool thing
if<00:01:35.100> you<00:01:35.220> guys<00:01:35.369> want<00:01:36.150> to<00:01:36.270> go<00:01:36.540> check<00:01:36.570> that<00:01:36.930> all

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
you really have to do is just go down to

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.370

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
it just takes a little bit of time it

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.260 
it just takes a little bit of time it
took<00:01:43.860> me<00:01:44.009> about<00:01:44.159> like<00:01:44.369> 20<00:01:44.759> minutes<00:01:45.030> for<00:01:45.119> the

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
took me about like 20 minutes for the

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.389 
took me about like 20 minutes for the
spawn<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:46.079> again<00:01:46.320> it<00:01:46.619> works<00:01:46.829> everywhere<00:01:47.340> I

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
spawn and again it works everywhere I

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.130 
spawn and again it works everywhere I
went<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.790> sky<00:01:48.060> watch<00:01:48.329> I<00:01:48.540> went<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.899> moon

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
went to the sky watch I went to the moon

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.719 
went to the sky watch I went to the moon
I<00:01:49.380> started<00:01:49.710> on<00:01:49.799> earth<00:01:50.070> it<00:01:50.340> pretty<00:01:50.549> much<00:01:50.700> is

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
I started on earth it pretty much is

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.580 
I started on earth it pretty much is
everywhere<00:01:51.210> sometimes<00:01:52.079> it<00:01:52.200> takes<00:01:52.290> five

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
everywhere sometimes it takes five

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.200 
everywhere sometimes it takes five
minutes<00:01:52.829> sometimes<00:01:53.250> it<00:01:53.369> takes<00:01:53.520> maybe<00:01:54.000> up<00:01:54.180> to

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
minutes sometimes it takes maybe up to

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.149 
minutes sometimes it takes maybe up to
30<00:01:54.540> minutes<00:01:54.780> I'm<00:01:54.960> not<00:01:55.079> too<00:01:55.229> sure<00:01:55.409> kind<00:01:55.950> of<00:01:56.009> like

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
30 minutes I'm not too sure kind of like

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.190 
30 minutes I'm not too sure kind of like
the<00:01:56.310> public<00:01:56.460> event<00:01:56.790> may<00:01:56.909> be<00:01:56.969> a<00:01:57.030> bit<00:01:57.180> faster<00:01:57.570> but

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
the public event may be a bit faster but

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.249 
the public event may be a bit faster but
I<00:01:58.229> actually<00:01:58.560> I<00:01:58.799> saw<00:01:59.130> in<00:01:59.790> intervals<00:02:00.299> of<00:02:00.420> like<00:02:00.600> 10

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
I actually I saw in intervals of like 10

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.590 
I actually I saw in intervals of like 10
to<00:02:01.380> 15<00:02:01.770> minutes<00:02:01.979> so<00:02:02.130> I<00:02:02.219> got<00:02:02.399> it<00:02:02.520> I'm<00:02:02.610> twice<00:02:02.939> a<00:02:03.000> 15

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
to 15 minutes so I got it I'm twice a 15

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.060
