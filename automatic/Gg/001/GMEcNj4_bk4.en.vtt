00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:34.360
 waka city ​​is a chile or 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:37.050
 like little more than hatton and close nothing 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.050
 shy 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:47.559
 and here is a saga of videogames created 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:52.720
 by white 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:55.150
 valkyrie novocaine launched in 1986 in 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.269
 a land called sea ​​of lang no 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:00.089
 confuse with the publishing house of stalin and 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:03.300
 an old man decomposes the tower of a clock 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:06.280
 and ends up invoking a dark magician 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.050
 Valkyrie will come down from heaven and 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.320
 will try to put an end to that dark magician of 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:13.420
 time the game mode we could say 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.060
 which is an improved version of zelda 2 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.130
 of link adventure since the enemies 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.270
 they come out like this at random walking the style 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:23.830
 Celtic 2 and the game mode is rpg type 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.399
 just that they are here it is not cansinos 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.399
 that the laterals 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.480
 i 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.910
 and luckily the video game is not very 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:36.660
 linear although that would change for the 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.660
 remix of play station 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:47.820
 in 1989 it arose for near the sequel 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:50.520
 the legend of valkyrie the legend of 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:54.080
 Valkyrie in this version for the 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.790
 second player we will have here 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.130
 a kind of green lizard while 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:02.360
 the version of pérez engine would have 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.360
 a system of passwords 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.980
 in 1992 the last title of the 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:20.540
 saga 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:24.500
 sandra no dybbuk in valkyrie all do not you 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:27.260
 there is good but as I do not know Japanese the 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:30.110
 European name is queer it since in 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.549
 this game is the protagonist and is the 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.400
 only game in the saga that came to 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:38.360
 west but this is a victim of 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.920
 cell 211 sorcerer syndrome 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.140
 erupt a volcano near the 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.269
 village of here law and these that the 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.970
 inhabitants fall sick among them 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:47.290
 the son say it 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.710
 now he has to undertake an adventure 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:53.350
 in search of a medicine the control of 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:54.970
 game is quite complex if it is not done 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.500
 damage any enemy at any time 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.770
 we have to go back to the beginning of 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.770
 level 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.170
 and the controls are quite complex 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:07.170
 always very high concept 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.450
 or dive into a dive then you have to 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.610
 recover or if it hits a wall 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.069
 or falls to the ground I lose consciousness 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:16.380
 for a while giving time to the 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:17.940
 enemy to attack you there is also 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.530
 to do a run so that the 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.849
 movements are stronger 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.040
 the video game has several endings 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:24.890
 sad depending on the phase that you have 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.720
 dead 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:30.200
 from this title they did not return to 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.700
 do more and it does not surprise me as much 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.780
 they did a remake of the first title 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.780
 but this one is more linear 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.970
 i 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.950
 although it's a bit late I'd like to give 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:54.040
 my congratulations to Latin America 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:56.830
 especially Argentina because now 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:59.440
 they have a dad from their roots and that 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:01.540
 it's pretty good since most of 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.819
 Prejudices in Latin America tend to 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.550
 be Christian and this may end 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:09.489
 with prejudice is also not a 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:12.130
 religious anyone this made vows of 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:13.300
 poverty all a good example for the 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:15.730
 catholic church 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:18.269
 after all Jesus was born poor and 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.269
 he died poor
