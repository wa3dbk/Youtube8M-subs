00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
came because of that aspect even though

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.960 
came because of that aspect even though
there's<00:01:26.820> one<00:01:27.150> Batman<00:01:27.630> game<00:01:28.049> that<00:01:28.380> I<00:01:28.579> did<00:01:29.579> enjoy

know it wasn't an actual batman game but

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.230 
know it wasn't an actual batman game but
it<00:01:36.780> was<00:01:36.930> basically<00:01:37.320> like<00:01:37.759> kind<00:01:38.759> of<00:01:38.820> like<00:01:38.880> Team

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240

Fortress<00:01:39.509> 2<00:01:39.720> except<00:01:40.500> team<00:01:41.490> fortress<00:01:41.850> 2<00:01:42.000> was

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
Fortress 2 except team fortress 2 was

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.859 
Fortress 2 except team fortress 2 was
bad<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:42.770> art<00:01:43.770> of<00:01:44.040> Gotham<00:01:44.909> City<00:01:45.149> Impostors<00:01:45.240> was

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
bad and art of Gotham City Impostors was

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.710 
bad and art of Gotham City Impostors was
a<00:01:45.899> good<00:01:46.110> game<00:01:46.340> so<00:01:47.340> yeah<00:01:48.090> I<00:01:48.119> mean<00:01:49.670> the<00:01:50.720> that's

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
a good game so yeah I mean the that's

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.050 
a good game so yeah I mean the that's
really<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.140> only<00:01:52.170> Batman<00:01:52.530> game<00:01:52.829> I<00:01:52.979> liked<00:01:53.250> but

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
really the only Batman game I liked but

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.670 
really the only Batman game I liked but
it<00:01:54.270> didn't<00:01:54.509> have<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.780> terrible<00:01:55.200> monotone

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
it didn't have the terrible monotone

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.980 
it didn't have the terrible monotone
Batman<00:01:56.189> voice<00:01:56.399> that<00:01:56.790> we<00:01:57.149> all<00:01:57.270> know<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:57.780> love

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
Batman voice that we all know and love

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.319 
Batman voice that we all know and love
and<00:01:59.270> it's<00:02:00.270> just<00:02:00.360> horrible<00:02:00.780> but<00:02:01.680> I<00:02:02.100> guess<00:02:03.090> that

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
and it's just horrible but I guess that

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:04.910 
and it's just horrible but I guess that
covers<00:02:03.540> a<00:02:03.719> story<00:02:04.049> pretty<00:02:04.290> much<00:02:04.530> because

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
covers a story pretty much because

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.499 
covers a story pretty much because
anything<00:02:05.250> with<00:02:05.340> Batman<00:02:05.729> is<00:02:05.880> boring<00:02:06.299> so

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
anything with Batman is boring so

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.400 
anything with Batman is boring so
obviously<00:02:06.840> a<00:02:06.930> story<00:02:07.229> in<00:02:07.350> this<00:02:07.439> game<00:02:07.649> is<00:02:07.740> boring

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
obviously a story in this game is boring

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.450 
obviously a story in this game is boring
then<00:02:10.410> I<00:02:10.440> discussed<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.160> gameplay

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460 
then I discussed the gameplay

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.360 
then I discussed the gameplay
and<00:02:12.580> wrap<00:02:13.420> up<00:02:13.600> this<00:02:13.750> review<00:02:14.200> because<00:02:14.470> it's

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
and wrap up this review because it's

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.760 
and wrap up this review because it's
pretty<00:02:15.640> self-explanatory<00:02:16.350> the<00:02:17.350> combat

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
pretty self-explanatory the combat

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.620 
pretty self-explanatory the combat
system<00:02:17.980> is<00:02:18.370> so<00:02:18.520> boring<00:02:18.880> it's<00:02:19.240> nothing

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
system is so boring it's nothing

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.440 
system is so boring it's nothing
innovative<00:02:19.870> at<00:02:20.260> all<00:02:20.440> it's<00:02:21.000> your<00:02:22.000> typical

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
innovative at all it's your typical

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.680 
innovative at all it's your typical
beat-'em-up<00:02:23.140> game<00:02:23.470> and<00:02:24.420> it's<00:02:25.420> really<00:02:25.570> not

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
beat-'em-up game and it's really not

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.110 
beat-'em-up game and it's really not
that<00:02:25.810> innovative<00:02:26.320> you<00:02:27.250> know<00:02:27.370> it's<00:02:27.670> really<00:02:27.910> it

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
controls to feel sloppy and broken I

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.490 
controls to feel sloppy and broken I
mean<00:02:39.910> at<00:02:40.150> least<00:02:40.180> on<00:02:40.480> the<00:02:40.570> xbox<00:02:40.960> I<00:02:41.260> don't<00:02:41.440> know

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500

that any other platform but whatever so

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:47.970 
that any other platform but whatever so
if<00:02:46.630> I<00:02:46.750> had<00:02:46.870> to<00:02:46.960> give<00:02:47.080> this<00:02:47.230> game<00:02:47.500> a<00:02:47.740> letter

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
if I had to give this game a letter

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.670 
if I had to give this game a letter
score<00:02:48.220> I<00:02:48.750> would<00:02:49.750> definitely<00:02:49.900> give<00:02:50.320> this<00:02:50.350> a

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
score I would definitely give this a

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.300 
score I would definitely give this a
total<00:02:51.160> F<00:02:51.310> because<00:02:52.150> the<00:02:52.630> game<00:02:52.840> so<00:02:53.140> boring<00:02:53.680> the

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
total F because the game so boring the

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.370 
total F because the game so boring the
game<00:02:54.490> plays<00:02:54.790> in<00:02:55.000> bad<00:02:55.240> and<00:02:55.450> it's<00:02:55.810> stolen<00:02:56.080> from

game plays in bad and it's stolen from
other<00:02:56.560> games<00:02:57.210> if<00:02:58.210> I<00:02:58.360> can<00:02:58.540> think<00:02:58.690> of<00:02:58.840> a<00:02:58.900> game

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
other games if I can think of a game

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.350 
other games if I can think of a game
from<00:02:59.200> the<00:02:59.320> top<00:02:59.500> of<00:02:59.620> my<00:02:59.710> head<00:02:59.890> that<00:03:00.160> this<00:03:01.090> game

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
from the top of my head that this game

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.180 
from the top of my head that this game
reminds<00:03:01.690> me<00:03:01.870> of<00:03:02.050> it<00:03:02.350> would<00:03:03.310> probably<00:03:03.520> be<00:03:03.790> like

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
reminds me of it would probably be like

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.800 
reminds me of it would probably be like
just<00:03:06.190> your<00:03:06.370> typical<00:03:06.520> beat-'em-up<00:03:07.210> really<00:03:07.660> is

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
just your typical beat-'em-up really is

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.980 
just your typical beat-'em-up really is
it's<00:03:08.440> a<00:03:08.560> beat<00:03:08.740> em<00:03:08.830> up<00:03:08.950> game<00:03:09.420> and<00:03:10.420> there's

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:10.990 
it's a beat em up game and there's

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:12.710 
it's a beat em up game and there's
really<00:03:11.110> nothing<00:03:11.500> unique<00:03:11.740> to<00:03:11.920> the<00:03:12.040> game<00:03:12.190> at<00:03:12.340> all

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
really nothing unique to the game at all

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.980 
really nothing unique to the game at all
the<00:03:13.720> graphics<00:03:13.930> are<00:03:14.290> okay<00:03:15.540> it<00:03:16.540> seems<00:03:16.750> like<00:03:16.900> they

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:16.990 
the graphics are okay it seems like they

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:18.390 
the graphics are okay it seems like they
focus<00:03:17.350> more<00:03:17.380> on<00:03:17.560> the<00:03:17.680> graphics<00:03:18.130> than<00:03:18.250> any

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
focus more on the graphics than any

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.400 
focus more on the graphics than any
other<00:03:18.520> game<00:03:18.820> or<00:03:19.210> than<00:03:19.840> been<00:03:19.990> the<00:03:20.140> actual
