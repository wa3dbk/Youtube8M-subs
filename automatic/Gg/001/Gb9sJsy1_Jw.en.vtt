00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:23.080
 it's better than having two pots hello and 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.930
 welcome again I'm cc and today I 'm going 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:28.530
 Attract 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.810
 here on playstation3 that has taken a 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:34.610
 new update does quite a bit 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:37.410
 a few days and nothing just tell you that 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.920
 this is like the xbox 360 that you can 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.530
 take and take or is the titan 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.130
 and well, if some have seen it 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.860
 I 'm going to show you how to do it now 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:49.579
 it came to me the second time I think 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.010
 what was it 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:53.600
 and nothing just very easy just 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:57.589
 we have to let it hit us 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:01.820
 I host a zombie after moving away 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:04.939
 hit us another two others kill us but 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:07.729
 first having bought the quiz 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:10.250
 rival that would be the blue drink of 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:12.200
 revive and also to do this there are 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.020
 to do it alone as you are seeing me 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.479
 the personalized game started only 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.909
 If you give will not work locally has 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:24.369
 to be in private like that 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:24.369
 with that phoenix bye 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.020
 you leave with a stick a host now leave 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:32.350
 that you order hosts and supposedly 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.140
 I should already be there but apparently I do not 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.020
 he left 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.680
 so I do it one more time it seems to me 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.680
 single 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.430
 diverse 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:50.700
 well now have to make points because if 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:53.460
 it did not come to me for what life is 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.330
 but really this is how this is like 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.070
 the xbox is basically the same 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.600
 but good I bring it again in case 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.090
 some did not see the video because as it was 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.500
 already from xbox and all that not no interest or 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.930
 whatever is 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.060
 and nothing here you have it but 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.580
 to make it good what you have to 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:14.120
 do this let me hit you a host 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.470
 gives a zombie away is dark is and os 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.460
 Let with paste two wafers 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.460
 approaching him 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:24.240
 now when I re anime will be when I 

00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:27.290
 it comes out and without wanting to 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.290
 because we have something 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:37.870
 just as you see the flash has skipped 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.970
 that means it has come out as you see 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.870
 now start again the game to 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.870
 that you see it well 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:48.810
 and nothing just that 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.860
 this what happens that has a lot of time 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.860
 wait sorry 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:57.709
 but good to show you the best 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:03:01.040
 possible so that you can enjoy it and 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:02.689
 use that is clear apperti what this 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.370
 many times it comes and goes when 

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:05.900
 you want because it has happened to me that 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.060
 I'm in a game suddenly I do not have 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.790
 the titan this permanent that would be a 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:13.370
 permanent drink as explained in the 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:16.790
 previous video 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:19.760
 and nothing now what I'm going to do now is 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.170
 show us how I have already taken it as 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.330
 you have seen the light of before bright 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.950
 green the flash that means rich that 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.840
 they have already given it to you 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.060
 if you see the green flash 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.830
 It would also be that they gave it to you to 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.230
 that you see that they have given me what you are 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:36.760
 to see now that I hit the zombie 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.760
 first a host of posts in a row 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.959
 that I already have the permanent titan once 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.430
 has hit two hosts in a row is the 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:47.860
 third that would already leave me red and 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:51.340
 fourth would kill me 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.900
 and nothing this is the video itself so that 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.690
 see that I am in play trailer to the button 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.730
 ps even though the event menus press 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.930
 square or press triangle and all that 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.510
 nothing 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.670
 I hope these tricks serve as you see 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.439
 hit me and I'm there alive but of course 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.120
 attachment to the fourth and he has killed good this 

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:08.790
 it's all I hope you liked to give 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:12.030
