00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:50.419 
flywheel in it so maybe that'll give out

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:52.839

but<00:04:51.289> maybe<00:04:51.500> it<00:04:51.680> won't<00:04:51.830> maybe<00:04:52.400> it's<00:04:52.580> just<00:04:52.639> going

00:04:52.839 --> 00:04:52.849 
but maybe it won't maybe it's just going

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:55.990 
but maybe it won't maybe it's just going
