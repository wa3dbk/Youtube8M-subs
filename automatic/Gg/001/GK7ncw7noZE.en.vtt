00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.540
 Welcome to a new connection with the 

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:12.220
 baseball your link with the big leagues 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.950
 Felix Hernandez is still news 

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:17.170
 for his performance on the mound at 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.690
 that goes of year Felix has achieved marks 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.160
 important for Venezuelan pitchers 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.470
 and aware of his experience and his 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.780
 strengths is getting better and better 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:28.720
 between seasons with a special plan that 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:31.480
 helps it to a better performance of the year 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.890
 happened when I personally hired 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.800
 the new program that he had shown 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:38.769
 but many many many many many 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.449
 voices of many physicists weighs in three 

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:42.489
 physical pieces that we run to run on 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:44.829
 the morning we borrowed in the afternoon 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:47.620
 and after being a little pool and it's 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:49.319
 this as I say until I have to restore 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.730
 actually nothing where he has added 

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:53.400
 much faster flexibility the 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:57.000
 mound 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.990
 of the normal mouse the same after ten years 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.210
 in big leagues 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:02.490
 Felix recognizes that what has been studied 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.890
 enough for his opponents as to 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:07.500
 confront him with more information about 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.300
 of its resources for this during the 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.740
 preseason was working on the 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.830
 perfecting a new 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.540
 launch the core to add elements 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.470
 that allow him to surprise the contrary 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:23.880
 and fulfill their job of putting them out 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:27.930
 He is trying and trying and had a lot of good 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.210
 I really had to see how it 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:38.390
 save more 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:41.770
 according to another tool 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.770
 truth to nobody 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.680
 in the year 2007 the Felix Straight 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.410
 hernandez averages a speed of 90 and 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.150
 6.3 miles per hour and in 2015 already its 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:55.370
 straight is located at an average speed 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:57.380
 90 and 16 miles per hour 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:00.130
