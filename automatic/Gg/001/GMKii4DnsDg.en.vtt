of<00:01:43.200> it

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
of it

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.190 
of it
that's<00:01:44.640> great<00:01:45.000> okay<00:01:45.390> I<00:01:45.509> didn't<00:01:45.960> make<00:01:46.049> it

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
that's great okay I didn't make it

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.539 
that's great okay I didn't make it
everybody<00:01:46.409> be<00:01:46.619> like<00:01:46.740> of<00:01:46.860> course<00:01:46.920> he<00:01:47.369> didn't

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
everybody be like of course he didn't

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.289 
everybody be like of course he didn't
make<00:01:47.640> it<00:01:47.820> so<00:01:48.540> I<00:01:49.280> think<00:01:50.280> that<00:01:50.490> this<00:01:50.640> is<00:01:50.880> terrible

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
make it so I think that this is terrible

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.200 
make it so I think that this is terrible
I<00:01:51.869> don't<00:01:52.649> agree<00:01:52.829> with<00:01:52.890> it<00:01:53.159> I<00:01:53.340> wouldn't<00:01:53.729> get

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
I don't agree with it I wouldn't get

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.120 
I don't agree with it I wouldn't get
involved<00:01:54.750> and<00:01:54.869> try<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.079> ban<00:01:55.380> it<00:01:55.619> you<00:01:55.890> know<00:01:56.009> if

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
involved and try to ban it you know if

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.319 
involved and try to ban it you know if
this<00:01:56.250> is<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.549> way<00:01:56.640> that<00:01:56.790> they<00:01:56.909> want<00:01:57.119> to<00:01:57.180> run

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
this is the way that they want to run

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.670 
this is the way that they want to run
their<00:01:57.479> business<00:01:57.899> go<00:01:58.110> ahead<00:01:58.350> and<00:01:58.469> run<00:01:58.590> your

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
their business go ahead and run your

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.080 
their business go ahead and run your
business<00:01:58.740> this<00:01:59.189> way<00:01:59.369> but<00:01:59.729> I<00:01:59.759> think<00:01:59.850> it's

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
business this way but I think it's

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.450 
business this way but I think it's
pathetic<00:02:00.240> but<00:02:00.750> then<00:02:01.290> I<00:02:01.320> also<00:02:01.530> kind<00:02:02.009> of<00:02:02.100> reflect

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
pathetic but then I also kind of reflect

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.980 
pathetic but then I also kind of reflect
on<00:02:02.610> certain<00:02:02.969> businesses<00:02:03.390> in<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:03.630> United

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
on certain businesses in the United

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.370 
on certain businesses in the United
States<00:02:04.259> right<00:02:04.560> and<00:02:05.509> we<00:02:06.509> have<00:02:06.659> businesses<00:02:07.170> here

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
States right and we have businesses here

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.339 
States right and we have businesses here
that<00:02:07.409> might<00:02:07.740> not<00:02:07.920> be<00:02:08.160> as<00:02:08.479> explicit<00:02:09.479> or<00:02:09.840> overt

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
that might not be as explicit or overt

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.280 
that might not be as explicit or overt
about<00:02:11.069> their<00:02:11.489> superficial<00:02:12.030> nature<00:02:12.690> but<00:02:13.170> they

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
about their superficial nature but they

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.910 
about their superficial nature but they
exist

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
exist

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.680 
exist
I<00:02:13.950> mean<00:02:14.099> think<00:02:14.280> about<00:02:14.310> how<00:02:14.490> many<00:02:14.690> attractive

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
I mean think about how many attractive

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.080 
I mean think about how many attractive
women<00:02:16.200> get<00:02:16.500> to<00:02:16.620> bypass<00:02:17.040> a<00:02:17.099> line<00:02:17.459> and<00:02:17.760> get<00:02:17.880> into

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
women get to bypass a line and get into

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.420 
women get to bypass a line and get into
a<00:02:18.120> club<00:02:18.420> with<00:02:18.599> no<00:02:18.780> cover<00:02:19.020> charge<00:02:19.140> it<00:02:19.980> happens

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
makes sense but I mean different strokes

for<00:03:11.130> different<00:03:11.280> folks<00:03:11.549> like<00:03:12.030> how<00:03:12.780> do<00:03:12.840> you

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
determine whether or not someone is

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.940 
determine whether or not someone is
attractive<00:03:15.239> like<00:03:15.420> a<00:03:15.600> really<00:03:16.170> really<00:03:16.290> hot<00:03:16.650> guy

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
attractive like a really really hot guy

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.400 
attractive like a really really hot guy
-<00:03:17.370> most<00:03:17.580> people<00:03:17.790> might<00:03:18.269> be<00:03:18.450> unattractive<00:03:19.109> to

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
- most people might be unattractive to

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.670 
- most people might be unattractive to
me<00:03:19.560> right<00:03:20.280> so<00:03:20.579> you<00:03:21.120> shouldn't<00:03:21.480> rely<00:03:21.870> on<00:03:22.079> three
