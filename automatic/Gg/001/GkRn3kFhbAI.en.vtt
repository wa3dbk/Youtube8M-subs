a<00:00:04.380> spirit<00:00:04.799> world<00:00:05.009> episode<00:00:05.460> I<00:00:05.700> mean<00:00:06.180> I<00:00:06.240> really

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
a spirit world episode I mean I really

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.909 
a spirit world episode I mean I really
loved<00:00:06.629> beginnings<00:00:07.140> but<00:00:07.379> that<00:00:07.500> was<00:00:07.649> more<00:00:07.770> of<00:00:07.859> a

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
loved beginnings but that was more of a

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:09.890 
loved beginnings but that was more of a
focus<00:00:08.099> on<00:00:08.429> the<00:00:08.610> first<00:00:09.090> avatar<00:00:09.360> and<00:00:09.780> how<00:00:09.840> the

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
focus on the first avatar and how the

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.620 
focus on the first avatar and how the
avatar<00:00:10.349> came<00:00:10.530> to<00:00:10.710> be<00:00:10.889> but<00:00:11.490> this<00:00:11.700> time<00:00:11.910> I<00:00:12.150> think

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
avatar came to be but this time I think

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:13.879 
avatar came to be but this time I think
we<00:00:12.719> took<00:00:12.840> a<00:00:12.900> really<00:00:13.080> close<00:00:13.440> look<00:00:13.590> at<00:00:13.830> the

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
we took a really close look at the

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.709 
we took a really close look at the
spirit<00:00:14.340> world<00:00:14.429> not<00:00:14.849> only<00:00:14.880> within<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:15.420> world

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
spirit world not only within the world

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.599 
spirit world not only within the world
of<00:00:15.839> the<00:00:15.960> show<00:00:16.199> but<00:00:16.710> also<00:00:16.830> I<00:00:17.010> think<00:00:17.190> we<00:00:17.460> got<00:00:17.490> a

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
of the show but also I think we got a

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.460 
of the show but also I think we got a
very<00:00:18.060> clear<00:00:18.240> picture<00:00:18.359> of<00:00:18.720> what<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:19.020> creators

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
very clear picture of what the creators

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.070 
very clear picture of what the creators
of<00:00:19.500> avatar<00:00:20.369> what<00:00:21.180> were<00:00:21.270> they<00:00:21.359> trying<00:00:21.510> to<00:00:21.689> do<00:00:21.900> by

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
of avatar what were they trying to do by

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.630 
of avatar what were they trying to do by
introducing<00:00:22.650> this<00:00:22.769> element<00:00:23.130> into<00:00:23.369> their

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
introducing this element into their

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.130 
introducing this element into their
series<00:00:24.060> and<00:00:24.510> I<00:00:24.600> think<00:00:24.779> it's<00:00:24.900> commendable

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
series and I think it's commendable

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.339 
series and I think it's commendable
because<00:00:25.949> not<00:00:26.160> only<00:00:26.449> were<00:00:27.449> there<00:00:27.599> some<00:00:27.779> there's

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
because not only were there some there's

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.259 
because not only were there some there's
some<00:00:28.500> great<00:00:28.619> advice<00:00:28.890> shared<00:00:29.429> for<00:00:29.699> Korra<00:00:29.939> but<00:00:30.240> I

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
some great advice shared for Korra but I

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.580 
some great advice shared for Korra but I
thought<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.630> advice<00:00:30.900> that<00:00:30.929> was<00:00:31.170> given<00:00:31.230> was

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
thought the advice that was given was

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.740 
thought the advice that was given was
applicable<00:00:31.859> to<00:00:32.219> anybody<00:00:32.610> and<00:00:32.820> I<00:00:33.420> think<00:00:33.630> it's

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
applicable to anybody and I think it's

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.870 
applicable to anybody and I think it's
so<00:00:33.930> wonderful<00:00:34.469> when<00:00:34.559> an<00:00:34.710> all-ages<00:00:35.399> show<00:00:35.610> like

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
so wonderful when an all-ages show like

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.209 
so wonderful when an all-ages show like
this<00:00:36.120> can<00:00:36.750> not<00:00:36.899> only<00:00:37.050> entertain<00:00:37.590> but<00:00:37.920> teach

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
this can not only entertain but teach

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.600 
this can not only entertain but teach
and<00:00:38.899> especially<00:00:39.899> um<00:00:40.290> Eastern<00:00:40.920> philosophies

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
and especially um Eastern philosophies

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.010 
and especially um Eastern philosophies
so<00:00:42.149> I<00:00:42.180> thought<00:00:42.390> that<00:00:42.450> was<00:00:42.690> really

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
so I thought that was really

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.350 
so I thought that was really
sophisticated<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:44.070> fascinating<00:00:44.610> I<00:00:44.760> so<00:00:45.329> I

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
sophisticated and fascinating I so I

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.630 
sophisticated and fascinating I so I
really<00:00:45.660> was<00:00:45.780> happy<00:00:46.079> with<00:00:46.170> this<00:00:46.289> episode<00:00:46.739> now

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.430 
really was happy with this episode now
of<00:00:47.789> course<00:00:47.969> I<00:00:48.210> thought<00:00:48.510> at<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.750> end<00:00:48.899> it<00:00:49.200> kind

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
of course I thought at the end it kind

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.740 
of course I thought at the end it kind
of<00:00:49.500> went<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:49.950> typical<00:00:50.370> problems<00:00:51.120> for<00:00:51.390> this

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
of went to typical problems for this

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.479 
of went to typical problems for this
season<00:00:52.170> but<00:00:52.710> I'll<00:00:52.890> get<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.039> that<00:00:53.129> in<00:00:53.250> a<00:00:53.370> moment

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
season but I'll get to that in a moment

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.119

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
but I really liked the very I say the

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.529 
but I really liked the very I say the
first<00:00:56.370> two<00:00:56.550> thirds<00:00:56.820> of<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.059> show<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.390> how

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
first two thirds of the show and how

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.720 
first two thirds of the show and how
great<00:00:57.719> was<00:00:57.899> it<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.199> see<00:00:58.350> ero<00:00:58.620> return<00:00:59.129> I<00:00:59.370> thought

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
great was it to see ero return I thought

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.639 
great was it to see ero return I thought
that<00:00:59.850> was<00:00:59.940> wonderful<00:01:00.270> now<00:01:00.510> sadly<00:01:00.809> obviously<00:01:01.469> I

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
that was wonderful now sadly obviously I

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.080 
that was wonderful now sadly obviously I
think<00:01:01.829> this<00:01:02.070> was<00:01:02.250> either<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.579> second<00:01:02.940> voice

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
think this was either the second voice

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.820 
think this was either the second voice
actor<00:01:03.480> who<00:01:03.600> did<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.899> character<00:01:04.290> or<00:01:04.530> a<00:01:04.559> new<00:01:04.799> one

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
actor who did the character or a new one

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.340 
actor who did the character or a new one
but<00:01:05.820> it<00:01:05.909> didn't<00:01:06.180> sound<00:01:06.330> like<00:01:06.510> euro<00:01:06.869> of<00:01:07.110> course

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
but it didn't sound like euro of course

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.920 
but it didn't sound like euro of course
but<00:01:07.560> unfortunately<00:01:08.070> ma<00:01:08.520> co<00:01:08.729> not<00:01:09.420> Marco<00:01:09.750> from

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
but unfortunately ma co not Marco from

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.600 
but unfortunately ma co not Marco from
the<00:01:10.049> show<00:01:10.260> but<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.680> voice<00:01:10.860> actor<00:01:11.220> maka<00:01:11.400> who

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
the show but the voice actor maka who

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.109 
the show but the voice actor maka who
who<00:01:12.320> did<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.470> original<00:01:13.500> voice<00:01:13.979> 40<00:01:14.520> passed

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
who did the original voice 40 passed

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.600 
who did the original voice 40 passed
away<00:01:15.450> so<00:01:16.140> this<00:01:16.740> I<00:01:16.920> think<00:01:16.979> just<00:01:17.220> kind<00:01:17.400> of<00:01:17.430> I

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
away so this I think just kind of I

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.760 
away so this I think just kind of I
think<00:01:17.939> it<00:01:18.180> it's<00:01:18.450> nice<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:18.990> see<00:01:19.110> what<00:01:19.259> an<00:01:19.590> impact

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
think it it's nice to see what an impact

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.410 
think it it's nice to see what an impact
he<00:01:20.189> had<00:01:20.310> with<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.549> character<00:01:20.880> that<00:01:20.909> you<00:01:21.150> still

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
he had with the character that you still

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.200 
he had with the character that you still
III<00:01:22.170> at<00:01:22.530> least<00:01:22.740> so<00:01:23.070> closely<00:01:23.369> associate<00:01:24.000> his

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
III at least so closely associate his

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.420 
III at least so closely associate his
voice<00:01:24.479> with<00:01:24.780> this<00:01:25.200> character<00:01:25.409> but<00:01:25.799> still

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
voice with this character but still

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.010 
voice with this character but still
obviously<00:01:26.759> he<00:01:26.909> can't<00:01:27.060> reprise<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.659> role<00:01:27.689> so

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
obviously he can't reprise the role so

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.480 
obviously he can't reprise the role so
it<00:01:28.110> was<00:01:28.229> great<00:01:28.470> to<00:01:28.619> see<00:01:28.770> him<00:01:28.799> brought<00:01:29.100> back<00:01:29.130> in

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
it was great to see him brought back in

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.969 
it was great to see him brought back in
here<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:29.939> I<00:01:30.240> hope<00:01:30.420> that<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:31.200> real<00:01:31.350> life<00:01:31.560> ma<00:01:31.770> co

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
that was a really good metaphor from

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.030 
that was a really good metaphor from
what<00:01:42.600> Cora<00:01:42.810> is<00:01:42.899> still<00:01:43.229> like<00:01:43.380> emotionally

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
what Cora is still like emotionally

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.039 
what Cora is still like emotionally
she's<00:01:44.520> still<00:01:44.729> this<00:01:44.909> young<00:01:45.090> child<00:01:45.450> who<00:01:45.659> hasn't

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
she's still this young child who hasn't

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.120 
she's still this young child who hasn't
matured<00:01:46.530> at<00:01:46.890> all<00:01:47.009> so<00:01:47.640> that<00:01:48.119> was<00:01:48.329> very<00:01:48.390> telling

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
matured at all so that was very telling

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.380 
matured at all so that was very telling
but<00:01:50.130> I<00:01:50.159> think<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.460> standout<00:01:50.880> character<00:01:51.240> by

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
but I think the standout character by

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.319 
but I think the standout character by
far<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:51.720> away<00:01:51.750> in<00:01:51.899> this<00:01:52.020> episode<00:01:52.290> was<00:01:52.590> Jinora

happens to her is totally on Cora's head
I<00:02:39.390> think<00:02:39.630> Korra<00:02:39.810> was<00:02:39.930> very<00:02:40.110> irresponsible<00:02:40.260> it

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
I think Korra was very irresponsible it

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.160 
I think Korra was very irresponsible it
was<00:02:41.250> Korres<00:02:41.700> attitude<00:02:42.240> problems<00:02:42.780> and<00:02:42.990> you

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
was Korres attitude problems and you

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.570 
was Korres attitude problems and you
know<00:02:43.410> inability<00:02:43.980> to<00:02:44.070> control<00:02:44.220> her<00:02:44.490> emotions

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
know inability to control her emotions

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:45.980 
know inability to control her emotions
which<00:02:45.060> got<00:02:45.240> them<00:02:45.390> into<00:02:45.540> trouble<00:02:45.810> in<00:02:45.870> the<00:02:45.930> first

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
which got them into trouble in the first

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.240 
which got them into trouble in the first
place<00:02:46.260> when<00:02:46.470> they<00:02:46.560> entered<00:02:46.830> the<00:02:46.920> spirit<00:02:47.100> world

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
place when they entered the spirit world

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.610 
place when they entered the spirit world
and<00:02:47.700> that's<00:02:48.030> why<00:02:48.210> they<00:02:48.330> were<00:02:48.420> separated<00:02:48.990> and<00:02:49.170> I

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
and that's why they were separated and I

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.130 
and that's why they were separated and I
think<00:02:49.860> Korra<00:02:50.100> I<00:02:50.310> hope<00:02:50.520> that<00:02:50.700> coral<00:02:51.630> core<00:02:51.870> takes

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
think Korra I hope that coral core takes

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.630 
think Korra I hope that coral core takes
on<00:02:52.320> the<00:02:52.410> responsibility<00:02:52.500> of<00:02:53.100> what<00:02:53.280> she's<00:02:53.460> done

thought<00:03:04.110> maybe<00:03:04.350> she<00:03:04.530> was<00:03:04.620> heading<00:03:04.860> in<00:03:04.950> that

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
thought maybe she was heading in that

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.290 
thought maybe she was heading in that
direction<00:03:05.100> at<00:03:05.700> the<00:03:05.760> beginning<00:03:06.060> of<00:03:06.210> this

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
direction at the beginning of this

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.930 
direction at the beginning of this
episode<00:03:06.450> when<00:03:06.870> arrow<00:03:07.080> was<00:03:07.260> giving<00:03:07.530> her<00:03:07.680> advice

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
episode when arrow was giving her advice

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
but she just makes the exact same

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.660 
but she just makes the exact same
mistakes<00:03:10.620> again<00:03:10.740> at<00:03:10.950> the<00:03:11.070> end<00:03:11.100> it<00:03:11.370> was<00:03:11.460> so

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
mistakes again at the end it was so

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.120 
mistakes again at the end it was so
disappointing<00:03:12.060> to<00:03:12.600> see<00:03:12.810> uh<00:03:13.050> and<00:03:13.740> also<00:03:13.980> when

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
disappointing to see uh and also when

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:15.170 
disappointing to see uh and also when
they<00:03:14.490> were<00:03:14.550> like<00:03:14.730> why<00:03:14.850> don't<00:03:14.910> you<00:03:15.030> enter

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
they were like why don't you enter

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.580 
they were like why don't you enter
through<00:03:15.510> the<00:03:15.570> spirit<00:03:16.020> you<00:03:16.200> know<00:03:16.290> through<00:03:16.530> the

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
through the spirit you know through the

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.590 
through the spirit you know through the
portal<00:03:17.040> I<00:03:17.220> was<00:03:17.670> thinking<00:03:17.970> too<00:03:18.060> i<00:03:18.210> was<00:03:18.330> thinking

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
portal I was thinking too i was thinking

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.120 
portal I was thinking too i was thinking
to<00:03:18.630> myself<00:03:18.810> yeah<00:03:19.290> why<00:03:19.440> didn't<00:03:19.770> they<00:03:19.830> enter

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
to myself yeah why didn't they enter

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.440 
to myself yeah why didn't they enter
through<00:03:20.340> the<00:03:20.370> portal<00:03:20.820> they<00:03:20.940> know<00:03:21.090> where<00:03:21.240> it<00:03:21.330> is

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
through the portal they know where it is

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.230 
through the portal they know where it is
Cora<00:03:21.960> opened<00:03:22.380> it<00:03:22.470> up<00:03:22.590> and<00:03:22.890> then<00:03:23.640> maybe<00:03:24.120> they

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:24.240 
Cora opened it up and then maybe they

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.340 
Cora opened it up and then maybe they
would<00:03:24.360> have<00:03:24.450> had<00:03:24.540> a<00:03:24.570> better<00:03:24.690> chance<00:03:24.810> you<00:03:25.200> would

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
would have had a better chance you would

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.100 
would have had a better chance you would
have<00:03:25.470> a<00:03:25.500> better<00:03:25.620> chance<00:03:25.710> of<00:03:26.010> defending<00:03:26.250> Jinora

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 
have a better chance of defending Jinora

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.140 
have a better chance of defending Jinora
but<00:03:28.110> despite<00:03:28.980> my<00:03:29.160> problems<00:03:29.640> i<00:03:29.790> mean<00:03:29.910> i<00:03:29.970> guess

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
but despite my problems i mean i guess

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.700 
but despite my problems i mean i guess
that<00:03:30.330> those<00:03:30.570> are<00:03:30.720> problems<00:03:30.990> that<00:03:31.290> our<00:03:31.410> story

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:31.710 
that those are problems that our story

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:33.620 
that those are problems that our story
problems<00:03:32.220> that<00:03:32.400> are<00:03:32.550> part<00:03:33.240> of<00:03:33.300> the<00:03:33.420> character

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
problems that are part of the character

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.080 
problems that are part of the character
i<00:03:33.780> hope<00:03:34.110> as<00:03:34.320> I<00:03:34.680> said<00:03:35.130> many<00:03:35.280> times<00:03:35.430> this<00:03:35.940> is

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
i hope as I said many times this is

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.330 
i hope as I said many times this is
going<00:03:36.390> somewhere<00:03:36.620> but<00:03:37.620> overall<00:03:38.010> I'm<00:03:38.220> not

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
going somewhere but overall I'm not

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:39.620 
going somewhere but overall I'm not
going<00:03:38.460> to<00:03:38.550> let<00:03:38.640> that<00:03:38.670> ruin<00:03:38.880> the<00:03:39.060> episode<00:03:39.420> for

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
going to let that ruin the episode for

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.180 
going to let that ruin the episode for
me<00:03:39.720> I<00:03:39.900> really<00:03:40.290> liked<00:03:40.500> it<00:03:40.650> I<00:03:40.800> thought<00:03:40.980> it<00:03:41.100> was

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
me I really liked it I thought it was

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.490

very<00:03:41.280> strong<00:03:41.880> across<00:03:42.180> the<00:03:42.480> board<00:03:42.690> it<00:03:43.170> reminded

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
very strong across the board it reminded

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.930 
very strong across the board it reminded
me<00:03:43.590> of<00:03:43.680> actually<00:03:44.570> original<00:03:46.640> episodes<00:03:47.640> with

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
me of actually original episodes with

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.610 
me of actually original episodes with
the<00:03:48.030> way<00:03:48.150> with<00:03:48.390> the<00:03:48.480> quality<00:03:48.870> of<00:03:48.900> it<00:03:49.110> but<00:03:49.590> I

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
the way with the quality of it but I

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.290 
the way with the quality of it but I
thought<00:03:49.860> it<00:03:50.040> was<00:03:50.130> great<00:03:50.310> from<00:03:50.520> the<00:03:50.640> script<00:03:51.030> to

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:51.300
