00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:12.030
 So to the hole complain about the fact that gigabyte 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:15.350
 Bismarck rio r1 incorrectly reproduces 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:19.609
 country music 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:21.900
 I personally personally do not listen to music 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:27.000
 manufacturer claims saves 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:29.539
 flashing to version 108 here 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.680
 installed version 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:38.969
 103 if the problem is really 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:41.570
 There is as I say it will be 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:45.050
 we play with interruption 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.050
 let's try 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.590
 aaaaaa 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.590
 but 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:16.420
 all makes your way wonderfully try 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:20.710
 what will happen if you connect hands-free 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.710
 original this which years complete 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.399
 I do not know whether you will hear 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:17.880
 you may need to look for something on the menu 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:21.290
 Now let's see well, so far nothing 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.290
 shed everything works fine 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:30.500
 let's try let's turn on the camera 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:43.430
 video camera audio playback 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.430
 ended shooting started 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:03:05.660
 but playing plays great 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:05.660
 I can probably hear the noise in the wire 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.920
 but 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:21.360
 Larissa is not up to turn on the cable then 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.360
 low frequencies disappear 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:35.140
 but still the playback is stable 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:37.810
 another problem literally right now 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.220
 Headphone out and play mode, but I have 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.989
 anyway when adding it is obvious 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.989
 the connector has become wrong 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:04:03.319
 here it is stereo mode everything works well 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:04:04.370
 you are convinced that there is no problem 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:06.700
 obvious problem 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:12.110
 perhaps in some third-party application 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:14.180
 either we were lucky with the test apparatus but 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:17.030
 unfortunately help sally problem 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:22.820
 determine if it is a flashing but 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:27.910
 this stage we can not its was the tone 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:27.910
