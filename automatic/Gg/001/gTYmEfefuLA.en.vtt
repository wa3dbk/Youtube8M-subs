00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:07.259
 maran is very angry maybe 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.780
 especially with bellusci he has 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.480
 determined a useless foul that he then has 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.330
 determined the goal of palermo 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.699
 true i 'm angry because it's not because 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.300
 they saw us vanish a victory that 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.640
 we deserved 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.640
 The were really getting is 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.050
 unfortunately arrived in the manner way 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.480
 rocambolesco 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.000
 we were in control even in the final 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.340
 unfortunately this did not come 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.620
 question we cared about a lot 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.260
 kept a lot for the ranking for i 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.879
 our fans because today anyway 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.940
 we have equaled the points record 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.160
 I could not overcome it there was a thousand things 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.980
 to be able to have it now 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.420
 this after game because I repeat for 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.170
 like we did for what we had 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:55.260
 disputed the race had worth consuming 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.789
 more but bellusci scolded him but 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.309
 I never speak, and after the game some 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.239
 no there is no peace of mind for 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.039
 to be able to do it 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.549
 It was a final fight 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.350
 explain but I saw very little there was 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.940
 much anger in the body aside 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.590
 our 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:14.670
 what happened I was far because 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.350
 then at that moment it was now more 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.840
 focused on my anger because 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.870
 they took with that way that others 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.520
 enrico the only thing i wanted to tell you but 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:25.590
 it's just an aspect we say 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.750
 statistician you still fail a 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.030
 exceed this quota 48 that the record 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.560
 let's say historian of Catania in series a Ã¨ 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.000
 in short it is true that five are missing 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.650
 matches but since he is at the beginning he has 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.080
 built this goal and that 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.060
 statisticians find that you are not successful 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.190
 to give us to get there now we are and 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.730
 five games are missing at this point if 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.050
 it is also true if today if you see the 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.670
 match seeing what we did 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:51.510
 a field seeing what we have today 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:54.330
 It was never arrived at 50 to the merger 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:55.950
 squad that's struggling it's pulling 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.180
 out everything he has and today has it 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.860
 proved proven great 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.360
 great desire attachment 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.910
 I repeat unfortunately in the final we have 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:07.040
 seen a victory we would have deserved 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:07.040
 graziani and all thanks to a maran
