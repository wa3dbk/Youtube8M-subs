PlayStation<00:01:41.220> however<00:01:41.729> what<00:01:41.939> if<00:01:42.030> there<00:01:42.180> was<00:01:42.270> a

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
PlayStation however what if there was a

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.730 
PlayStation however what if there was a
different<00:01:42.810> version<00:01:42.840> of<00:01:43.079> it<00:01:43.200> that<00:01:43.229> was<00:01:43.409> smaller

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
different version of it that was smaller

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.499 
different version of it that was smaller
and<00:01:43.829> cheaper<00:01:44.009> that<00:01:44.700> they<00:01:44.820> had<00:01:44.939> always<00:01:45.329> only

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
and cheaper that they had always only

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.510 
and cheaper that they had always only
download<00:01:45.960> only<00:01:46.290> personally<00:01:46.829> I<00:01:46.890> think<00:01:47.250> even

download only personally I think even

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.249 
download only personally I think even
though<00:01:47.700> I<00:01:47.729> love<00:01:48.119> actually<00:01:48.390> owning<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:49.049> disc

signers<00:01:49.530> thing<00:01:49.649> I<00:01:49.770> think<00:01:50.040> I<00:01:50.130> actually<00:01:50.250> might

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
signers thing I think I actually might

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.310 
signers thing I think I actually might
go<00:01:50.700> for<00:01:50.909> that<00:01:51.000> because<00:01:51.299> like<00:01:51.689> I<00:01:51.810> said<00:01:51.990> I<00:01:52.140> like

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
go for that because like I said I like

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.690 
go for that because like I said I like
just<00:01:52.530> downloading<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.070> games<00:01:53.310> I<00:01:53.460> don't<00:01:53.520> like

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
just downloading the games I don't like

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.100 
just downloading the games I don't like
to<00:01:53.820> have<00:01:53.909> to<00:01:54.060> you<00:01:54.450> know<00:01:54.479> fumble<00:01:54.840> through<00:01:54.990> the

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
to have to you know fumble through the

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.630 
to have to you know fumble through the
discs<00:01:55.439> and<00:01:55.530> I<00:01:55.619> think<00:01:55.770> I<00:01:55.829> just<00:01:55.950> like<00:01:56.040> had<00:01:56.340> it<00:01:56.369> on

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
discs and I think I just like had it on

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.160 
discs and I think I just like had it on
there<00:01:56.880> especially<00:01:57.119> bad<00:01:57.360> a<00:01:57.390> decent<00:01:57.750> sized<00:01:57.930> hard

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
there especially bad a decent sized hard

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.630 
there especially bad a decent sized hard
drive<00:01:58.350> that<00:01:58.469> I<00:01:58.500> wouldn't<00:01:58.710> have<00:01:58.829> to<00:01:58.950> worry<00:01:59.100> so

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
drive that I wouldn't have to worry so

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.950 
drive that I wouldn't have to worry so
it's<00:01:59.759> kind<00:01:59.909> of<00:01:59.969> my<00:02:00.060> question<00:02:00.119> you<00:02:00.509> guys<00:02:00.630> that's

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
it's kind of my question you guys that's

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.539 
it's kind of my question you guys that's
kind<00:02:01.200> of<00:02:01.229> what<00:02:01.380> my<00:02:01.560> dream<00:02:01.890> console<00:02:02.310> would<00:02:02.399> be

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
kind of what my dream console would be

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.789 
kind of what my dream console would be
if<00:02:02.790> they<00:02:03.240> had<00:02:03.270> well<00:02:03.600> make<00:02:03.750> that<00:02:03.780> dream<00:02:04.259> console

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
if they had well make that dream console

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.080 
if they had well make that dream console
but<00:02:05.009> I<00:02:05.219> think<00:02:05.460> that<00:02:05.549> would<00:02:05.640> be<00:02:05.729> a<00:02:05.759> really<00:02:05.939> good

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
but I think that would be a really good

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.150 
but I think that would be a really good
idea<00:02:06.149> but<00:02:06.689> enough<00:02:07.229> about<00:02:07.439> what<00:02:07.619> I<00:02:07.649> think<00:02:08.009> let's

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
idea but enough about what I think let's

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.499 
idea but enough about what I think let's
go<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:08.429> take<00:02:08.489> a<00:02:08.550> look<00:02:08.670> at<00:02:08.759> what<00:02:08.970> everyone<00:02:09.270> else

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
go and take a look at what everyone else

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.160 
go and take a look at what everyone else
has<00:02:09.750> to<00:02:09.780> say

not<00:02:40.680> familiar<00:02:40.859> with<00:02:41.069> what<00:02:41.159> it<00:02:41.400> is<00:02:41.459> basically

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
not familiar with what it is basically

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.300 
not familiar with what it is basically
it<00:02:42.209> is<00:02:42.390> a<00:02:42.420> streaming<00:02:43.109> service<00:02:43.439> so<00:02:44.010> instead<00:02:44.250> of

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
it is a streaming service so instead of

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.250 
it is a streaming service so instead of
having<00:02:44.430> to<00:02:44.579> download<00:02:45.120> the<00:02:45.239> games<00:02:45.450> or<00:02:45.780> you<00:02:46.170> know

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
having to download the games or you know

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.930 
having to download the games or you know
buy<00:02:46.409> the<00:02:46.470> discs<00:02:46.829> whatever<00:02:47.129> it<00:02:47.280> just<00:02:47.640> strains

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
buy the discs whatever it just strains

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.550 
buy the discs whatever it just strains
it<00:02:48.090> so<00:02:48.239> the<00:02:48.359> game<00:02:48.540> runs<00:02:48.840> on<00:02:48.959> a<00:02:49.019> server<00:02:49.260> and

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
it so the game runs on a server and

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.199 
it so the game runs on a server and
basically<00:02:50.129> what<00:02:50.370> you<00:02:50.489> see<00:02:50.519> on<00:02:50.730> your<00:02:50.849> TV<00:02:51.000> is

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
basically what you see on your TV is

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:52.940 
basically what you see on your TV is
like<00:02:51.389> video<00:02:51.810> and<00:02:52.109> and<00:02:52.470> when<00:02:52.620> you<00:02:52.709> do<00:02:52.829> the

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
like video and and when you do the

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.280 
like video and and when you do the
controller<00:02:53.310> that<00:02:53.489> sends<00:02:53.760> it<00:02:53.849> back<00:02:53.879> so<00:02:54.840> pretty

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
controller that sends it back so pretty

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:56.479 
controller that sends it back so pretty
much<00:02:55.379> there's<00:02:55.560> nothing<00:02:55.799> to<00:02:55.889> download<00:02:56.069> there's

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
much there's nothing to download there's

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.099 
much there's nothing to download there's
nothing<00:02:56.730> to<00:02:56.819> install<00:02:56.940> all<00:02:57.480> you<00:02:57.690> see<00:02:57.900> as<00:02:58.049> long

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:58.109 
nothing to install all you see as long

00:02:58.109 --> 00:02:58.910 
nothing to install all you see as long
as<00:02:58.290> you<00:02:58.349> have<00:02:58.440> a<00:02:58.470> good<00:02:58.500> internet<00:02:58.799> connection

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
as you have a good internet connection

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.849 
as you have a good internet connection
is<00:02:59.400> just<00:02:59.430> the<00:02:59.730> game<00:03:00.230> personally<00:03:01.230> I<00:03:01.440> think<00:03:01.590> in

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:01.859 
is just the game personally I think in

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:03.319 
is just the game personally I think in
that<00:03:01.980> connections<00:03:02.340> aren't<00:03:02.549> quite<00:03:03.060> good

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
that connections aren't quite good

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:05.720 
that connections aren't quite good
enough<00:03:03.480> for<00:03:03.629> online<00:03:03.959> I<00:03:04.170> know<00:03:04.230> there's<00:03:04.440> oh<00:03:04.730> I

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
enough for online I know there's oh I

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:06.979 
enough for online I know there's oh I
would<00:03:05.909> say<00:03:06.090> a<00:03:06.120> lot<00:03:06.389> of<00:03:06.450> live<00:03:06.569> but<00:03:06.750> there<00:03:06.870> is

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
would say a lot of live but there is

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:09.080 
would say a lot of live but there is
some<00:03:07.200> lag<00:03:07.440> involved<00:03:08.370> in<00:03:08.459> that<00:03:08.549> that's<00:03:08.879> that's

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
some lag involved in that that's that's

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.190 
some lag involved in that that's that's
a<00:03:09.239> little<00:03:09.359> bit<00:03:09.480> of<00:03:09.540> a<00:03:09.569> turn-off<00:03:09.750> for<00:03:09.900> me<00:03:10.019> but

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
a little bit of a turn-off for me but

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.229 
a little bit of a turn-off for me but
yeah<00:03:10.349> absolutely<00:03:11.040> on<00:03:11.129> live<00:03:11.310> has<00:03:11.519> a<00:03:11.549> lot<00:03:11.970> of

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
yeah absolutely on live has a lot of

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.210 
yeah absolutely on live has a lot of
capabilities<00:03:13.019> and<00:03:13.230> I<00:03:13.440> think<00:03:13.650> it<00:03:13.739> could<00:03:13.980> really

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
capabilities and I think it could really

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.550 
capabilities and I think it could really
do<00:03:14.370> well<00:03:14.549> in<00:03:14.639> the<00:03:14.730> future<00:03:14.879> a<00:03:15.319> touch<00:03:16.319> screen

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
do well in the future a touch screen

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.439 
do well in the future a touch screen

console um again since this is all for

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.710 
console um again since this is all for
fun<00:04:25.009> I'll<00:04:25.280> see<00:04:25.580> what<00:04:25.759> would<00:04:25.850> that<00:04:25.910> be<00:04:26.150> I<00:04:26.180> mean<00:04:26.479> I

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
fun I'll see what would that be I mean I

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.540 
fun I'll see what would that be I mean I
guess<00:04:27.199> for<00:04:27.440> that<00:04:27.590> you<00:04:27.830> obviously<00:04:28.009> have<00:04:28.370> all

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
guess for that you obviously have all

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.610 
guess for that you obviously have all
the<00:04:28.699> consoles<00:04:29.210> I've<00:04:29.509> been<00:04:29.660> all<00:04:29.960> the<00:04:30.110> games<00:04:30.350> on

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070 
talk throughout you know the years that

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:35.590 
talk throughout you know the years that
you<00:04:34.250> know<00:04:34.310> what<00:04:34.699> if<00:04:34.789> they<00:04:34.910> just<00:04:35.150> quit<00:04:35.240> making

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600 
you know what if they just quit making

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.659 
you know what if they just quit making
individual<00:04:36.110> consoles<00:04:36.650> and<00:04:36.889> have<00:04:37.250> to<00:04:37.370> spend

individual consoles and have to spend

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:40.600 
individual consoles and have to spend
$300<00:04:38.180> here<00:04:38.479> and<00:04:38.660> $300<00:04:39.229> here<00:04:39.470> and<00:04:39.590> $300<00:04:40.430> here

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:42.889 
and just mold it into one console that

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:45.070 
and just mold it into one console that
you<00:04:43.009> buy<00:04:43.130> that<00:04:43.340> plays<00:04:43.550> all<00:04:43.699> the<00:04:43.820> games<00:04:44.060> um<00:04:44.479> I

you buy that plays all the games um I
can<00:04:45.440> let<00:04:45.620> that<00:04:45.650> idea<00:04:46.010> I<00:04:46.070> mean<00:04:46.220> like<00:04:46.460> the<00:04:46.610> PC<00:04:47.000> for

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
can let that idea I mean like the PC for

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.090 
can let that idea I mean like the PC for
example<00:04:47.570> you<00:04:47.870> know<00:04:47.960> unlike<00:04:48.289> an<00:04:48.470> Xbox<00:04:48.889> or

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:49.100 
example you know unlike an Xbox or

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:50.860 
example you know unlike an Xbox or
Playstation<00:04:49.160> it's<00:04:50.090> not<00:04:50.270> like<00:04:50.449> you<00:04:50.690> can<00:04:50.840> just

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
Playstation it's not like you can just

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:52.420 
Playstation it's not like you can just
go<00:04:51.020> well<00:04:51.440> the<00:04:51.620> PlayStation<00:04:52.010> plays<00:04:52.190> pretty

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
go well the PlayStation plays pretty

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:53.620 
go well the PlayStation plays pretty
close<00:04:52.639> but<00:04:52.820> it's<00:04:53.060> not<00:04:53.090> like<00:04:53.270> you<00:04:53.360> can<00:04:53.449> take<00:04:53.600> a

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:53.630 
close but it's not like you can take a

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:55.810 
close but it's not like you can take a
Super<00:04:54.199> Nintendo<00:04:54.289> game<00:04:54.770> and<00:04:55.010> just<00:04:55.130> plug<00:04:55.460> it<00:04:55.639> in

perfect but really good backwards

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:07.750 
perfect but really good backwards
compatibility<00:05:06.050> with<00:05:06.260> PC<00:05:06.680> games<00:05:06.919> and<00:05:07.490> if<00:05:07.639> they

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 
were able to do something that with the

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.379 
were able to do something that with the
console<00:05:09.289> Sony<00:05:10.130> and<00:05:10.550> Microsoft<00:05:10.970> a<00:05:11.060> Nintendo

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:11.389 
console Sony and Microsoft a Nintendo

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:12.700 
console Sony and Microsoft a Nintendo
just<00:05:11.449> got<00:05:11.750> together<00:05:11.930> to<00:05:12.169> go<00:05:12.259> you<00:05:12.470> know<00:05:12.560> what

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:12.710 
just got together to go you know what

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:14.499 
just got together to go you know what
let's<00:05:13.250> just<00:05:13.280> make<00:05:13.490> one<00:05:13.520> console<00:05:14.090> that'd<00:05:14.389> be

00:05:14.499 --> 00:05:14.509 
let's just make one console that'd be

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:16.689 
let's just make one console that'd be
pretty<00:05:14.630> cool<00:05:14.870> although<00:05:15.410> I<00:05:15.830> don't<00:05:16.460> think

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:16.699 
pretty cool although I don't think

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:18.129 
pretty cool although I don't think
that's<00:05:16.820> ever<00:05:16.880> gonna<00:05:17.000> happen<00:05:17.090> just<00:05:17.930> saying

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:18.139 
that's ever gonna happen just saying

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:19.300 
that's ever gonna happen just saying
that<00:05:18.260> but<00:05:18.500> I<00:05:18.680> think<00:05:18.740> it<00:05:18.949> would<00:05:19.010> be<00:05:19.099> a<00:05:19.130> pretty

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.310 
that but I think it would be a pretty

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:21.670 
that but I think it would be a pretty
cool<00:05:19.400> idea<00:05:19.580> an<00:05:20.360> alliance<00:05:20.720> of<00:05:20.960> Apple<00:05:21.530> with

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680 
cool idea an alliance of Apple with

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.800 
cool idea an alliance of Apple with
Playstation<00:05:22.370> so<00:05:22.490> we<00:05:22.699> can<00:05:22.820> play<00:05:22.970> iOS<00:05:23.449> simple

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:23.810 
Playstation so we can play iOS simple

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:26.589 
Playstation so we can play iOS simple
games<00:05:23.990> but<00:05:24.199> also<00:05:24.289> hardcore<00:05:25.039> ps3<00:05:25.610> games<00:05:25.820> that's

00:05:26.589 --> 00:05:26.599 
games but also hardcore ps3 games that's

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:28.719 
games but also hardcore ps3 games that's
such<00:05:26.720> a<00:05:26.750> great<00:05:27.050> idea<00:05:27.199> I<00:05:27.560> think<00:05:27.680> I<00:05:27.949> mean<00:05:28.099> a<00:05:28.250> lot

00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:28.729 
such a great idea I think I mean a lot

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:29.950 
such a great idea I think I mean a lot
of<00:05:28.880> it<00:05:29.000> especially<00:05:29.120> when<00:05:29.510> you<00:05:29.630> look<00:05:29.780> at<00:05:29.870> the

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:29.960 
of it especially when you look at the

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.050 
of it especially when you look at the
3ds<00:05:30.320> which<00:05:30.650> isn't<00:05:30.830> been<00:05:31.039> doing<00:05:31.310> quite<00:05:31.760> as<00:05:31.909> well

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:32.060 
3ds which isn't been doing quite as well

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:33.760 
3ds which isn't been doing quite as well
as<00:05:32.180> a<00:05:32.210> lot<00:05:32.360> of<00:05:32.419> people<00:05:32.659> thought<00:05:33.139> they<00:05:33.349> would<00:05:33.590> I

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:33.770 
as a lot of people thought they would I

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:35.560 
as a lot of people thought they would I
think<00:05:34.340> a<00:05:34.400> lot<00:05:34.520> of<00:05:34.550> that<00:05:34.699> is<00:05:34.909> due<00:05:35.150> to<00:05:35.180> the<00:05:35.449> fact

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:35.570 
think a lot of that is due to the fact
