00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:06.220
 Protocol is me

 unfortunately we also went to Germany 

00:00:09.109 --> 00:00:11.979
 Finds a pity except to make 

00:00:11.979 --> 00:00:15.459

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.960
 Percent interest also self-same interesting but we come to 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.210

 and sends with the results and if not complains of criticism and praise too 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.720
