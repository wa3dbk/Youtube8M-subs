hello folks well again in my quest to

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.150 
hello folks well again in my quest to
find<00:00:07.470> the<00:00:07.710> most<00:00:08.010> unusual<00:00:09.889> quadcopters<00:00:10.920> and

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
find the most unusual quadcopters and

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.650 
find the most unusual quadcopters and
show<00:00:11.910> you<00:00:11.969> what<00:00:12.389> they<00:00:12.599> are<00:00:12.630> I<00:00:13.969> recently<00:00:14.969> did<00:00:15.599> a

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
show you what they are I recently did a

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:23.480 
show you what they are I recently did a
video<00:00:16.139> on<00:00:16.940> the<00:00:17.940> tiny<00:00:18.869> tiny<00:00:20.330> proto<00:00:21.330> X<00:00:21.890> from<00:00:22.890> s<00:00:23.160> DS

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
and tower hobbies this is the pocket

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.939 
and tower hobbies this is the pocket
quad<00:00:27.150> that<00:00:27.390> used<00:00:27.660> to<00:00:27.840> be<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.170> smallest<00:00:28.470> in<00:00:28.859> the

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
quad that used to be the smallest in the

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.999 
quad that used to be the smallest in the
world<00:00:29.269> anyway<00:00:30.269> in<00:00:30.570> looking<00:00:31.289> at<00:00:31.410> all<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.740> quads

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
world anyway in looking at all the quads

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.810 
world anyway in looking at all the quads
I<00:00:32.309> saw<00:00:32.700> this<00:00:33.290> one<00:00:34.290> from<00:00:34.680> Radio<00:00:35.100> Shack<00:00:35.160> called

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
I saw this one from Radio Shack called

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.490 
I saw this one from Radio Shack called
robot<00:00:38.570> while<00:00:39.570> I<00:00:39.600> was<00:00:39.930> looking<00:00:40.110> for

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
robot while I was looking for

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.190 
robot while I was looking for
high-intensity<00:00:41.280> white<00:00:41.670> LEDs<00:00:42.329> from<00:00:42.629> my<00:00:42.870> proto

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
high-intensity white LEDs from my proto

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.830 
high-intensity white LEDs from my proto
X<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:43.800> Radio<00:00:44.129> Shack<00:00:44.520> they<00:00:45.180> had<00:00:45.360> done<00:00:45.570> by<00:00:45.780> the

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
X and Radio Shack they had done by the

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.709 
X and Radio Shack they had done by the
way<00:00:46.079> so<00:00:46.140> I<00:00:46.440> simply<00:00:46.800> removed<00:00:47.370> one<00:00:47.670> from<00:00:48.030> an<00:00:48.180> LED

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
way so I simply removed one from an LED

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.560 
way so I simply removed one from an LED
flashlight<00:00:49.820> well<00:00:50.820> I'm<00:00:51.120> going<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.390> show<00:00:51.539> you

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
flashlight well I'm going to show you

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.660 
flashlight well I'm going to show you
actually<00:00:52.140> here<00:00:52.379> where<00:00:52.620> I<00:00:52.649> switched<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.460> power

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
actually here where I switched the power

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.229 
actually here where I switched the power
tabs<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.390> add<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.840> LED<00:00:55.289> of<00:00:55.320> this<00:00:55.620> type<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.239> so

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
tabs to add the LED of this type and so

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.439 
tabs to add the LED of this type and so
it<00:00:57.360> stays<00:00:57.629> all<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.050> time<00:00:58.289> on<00:00:58.890> now<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.820> with

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
it stays all the time on now and with

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.599 
it stays all the time on now and with
full<00:01:00.600> brightness<00:01:00.949> you<00:01:01.949> know<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.219> red<00:01:02.399> one<00:01:02.579> I

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
full brightness you know the red one I

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.640 
full brightness you know the red one I
had<00:01:02.910> before<00:01:03.149> simply<00:01:03.809> blended<00:01:04.320> in<00:01:04.470> with<00:01:04.589> the

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
had before simply blended in with the

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.469 
had before simply blended in with the
four<00:01:04.949> rear<00:01:05.280> ones<00:01:05.519> so<00:01:05.760> it<00:01:05.939> was<00:01:06.090> still<00:01:06.330> not

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
four rear ones so it was still not

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.750 
four rear ones so it was still not
optimal<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.170> see<00:01:07.590> at<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:07.979> distance<00:01:08.130> so<00:01:08.700> I

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
optimal to see at a distance so I

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.590 
optimal to see at a distance so I
changed<00:01:09.210> them<00:01:09.360> out<00:01:10.939> so<00:01:11.939> as<00:01:12.030> you<00:01:12.180> can<00:01:12.270> see<00:01:12.360> it

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
changed them out so as you can see it

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.990 
changed them out so as you can see it
really<00:01:12.840> helps<00:01:13.140> with<00:01:13.290> orientation<00:01:13.500> in<00:01:14.460> fact<00:01:14.880> it

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
really helps with orientation in fact it

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.999 
really helps with orientation in fact it
was<00:01:15.090> so<00:01:15.299> bright<00:01:15.630> I<00:01:15.689> had<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.200> put<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:16.409> yellow<00:01:16.650> lens

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
was so bright I had to put a yellow lens

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.340 
was so bright I had to put a yellow lens
over<00:01:17.310> it<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:17.729> even<00:01:18.240> put<00:01:18.509> some<00:01:18.540> black<00:01:18.869> paint<00:01:19.200> on

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
over it and even put some black paint on

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.620 
over it and even put some black paint on
that<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.860> dim<00:01:20.100> it<00:01:20.310> but<00:01:20.970> it's<00:01:21.119> working<00:01:21.479> pretty

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
that to dim it but it's working pretty

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.410 
that to dim it but it's working pretty
good<00:01:21.750> for<00:01:22.140> me<00:01:22.259> now<00:01:22.439> as<00:01:22.619> you<00:01:22.770> can<00:01:22.920> see

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.670 

while<00:01:26.420> many<00:01:26.630> of<00:01:26.750> you<00:01:26.840> suggested<00:01:27.410> in<00:01:27.530> the

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
while many of you suggested in the

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.120 
while many of you suggested in the
comments<00:01:28.130> of<00:01:28.250> my<00:01:28.370> last<00:01:28.610> video<00:01:29.000> on<00:01:29.300> the<00:01:29.480> proto<00:01:29.720> X

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
comments of my last video on the proto X

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.830 
comments of my last video on the proto X
about<00:01:31.130> the<00:01:31.430> transmitter<00:01:32.090> so<00:01:32.360> I<00:01:32.390> went<00:01:32.720> ahead

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
about the transmitter so I went ahead

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.220 
about the transmitter so I went ahead
and<00:01:32.960> ordered<00:01:33.080> the<00:01:33.530> hubsan<00:01:33.770> x4<00:01:34.600> overnight<00:01:35.600> to

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:36.230 
and ordered the hubsan x4 overnight to

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:37.990 
and ordered the hubsan x4 overnight to
try<00:01:36.440> the<00:01:36.500> transmitter<00:01:37.250> on<00:01:37.490> see<00:01:37.760> if<00:01:37.850> will

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
try the transmitter on see if will

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.060 
try the transmitter on see if will
actually<00:01:38.480> work<00:01:38.690> with<00:01:38.960> this<00:01:39.140> bird<00:01:39.440> and<00:01:39.650> if

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
actually work with this bird and if

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:56.609 
actually work with this bird and if
it'll<00:01:40.250> flip<00:01:40.640> -<00:01:40.880> so<00:01:41.570> stay<00:01:41.780> tuned<00:01:42.020> for<00:01:42.050> that

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:02.789 

I<00:02:00.479> like<00:02:01.479> everything<00:02:02.079> getting<00:02:02.289> it<00:02:02.439> out<00:02:02.590> of<00:02:02.740> the

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 
I like everything getting it out of the

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:13.160 
I like everything getting it out of the
fall<00:02:03.039> boys<00:02:07.739> there<00:02:10.050> once<00:02:11.050> there<00:02:11.319> he<00:02:11.440> is

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
fall boys there once there he is

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.990 
fall boys there once there he is
right<00:02:14.170> away<00:02:14.290> I<00:02:14.769> figured<00:02:15.310> they<00:02:15.459> were<00:02:15.519> somehow

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
right away I figured they were somehow

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.600 
right away I figured they were somehow
using<00:02:16.420> one<00:02:16.660> motor<00:02:16.959> as<00:02:17.290> some<00:02:17.590> of<00:02:17.769> the<00:02:17.860> 3d<00:02:18.160> quads

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
using one motor as some of the 3d quads

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.150 
using one motor as some of the 3d quads
are<00:02:18.879> now<00:02:19.060> using<00:02:19.360> and<00:02:19.690> then<00:02:20.200> intrigued<00:02:20.650> me<00:02:20.739> so<00:02:21.010> I

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
are now using and then intrigued me so I

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.699 
are now using and then intrigued me so I
went<00:02:21.340> ahead<00:02:21.489> and<00:02:21.640> bought<00:02:21.879> it<00:02:22.090> for<00:02:22.239> 2995

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
went ahead and bought it for 2995

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:26.280 
went ahead and bought it for 2995
but<00:02:24.069> upon<00:02:24.340> opening<00:02:24.730> it<00:02:24.940> I<00:02:25.120> find<00:02:25.480> four<00:02:25.959> geared

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
but upon opening it I find four geared

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.530 
but upon opening it I find four geared
motors<00:02:26.709> like<00:02:26.980> the<00:02:27.129> rest<00:02:27.370> on<00:02:27.760> a<00:02:27.849> fairly<00:02:28.090> strong

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
motors like the rest on a fairly strong

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.440 
motors like the rest on a fairly strong
EPP<00:02:29.200> foam<00:02:29.470> body<00:02:29.829> though<00:02:30.130> so<00:02:31.030> let's<00:02:31.209> take<00:02:31.420> a

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
EPP foam body though so let's take a

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.110 
EPP foam body though so let's take a
look<00:02:31.720> at<00:02:31.870> it<00:02:31.989> working<00:02:32.230> and<00:02:32.680> I'll<00:02:33.549> tell<00:02:33.880> you<00:02:33.970> my

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
look at it working and I'll tell you my

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.490 
look at it working and I'll tell you my
comments<00:02:34.569> at<00:02:34.690> the<00:02:34.840> end<00:02:34.870> yeah

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500

comments at the end yeah
not<00:02:36.069> being<00:02:36.280> able<00:02:36.400> to<00:02:36.549> move<00:02:36.790> that<00:02:37.030> -<00:02:37.329> bummer<00:02:37.950> I'm

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
not being able to move that - bummer I'm

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.420 
not being able to move that - bummer I'm
gonna<00:02:39.190> put<00:02:39.430> a<00:02:39.459> mark<00:02:39.940> on<00:02:40.150> the<00:02:41.190> somewhere<00:02:42.190> here

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
gonna put a mark on the somewhere here

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.880 
gonna put a mark on the somewhere here
so<00:02:42.670> I<00:02:42.700> can<00:02:42.970> see<00:02:43.239> the<00:02:43.420> front<00:02:44.110> of<00:02:44.230> this<00:02:44.319> no<00:02:44.620> where

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
so I can see the front of this no where

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.339 
so I can see the front of this no where
did<00:02:45.069> I<00:02:45.220> find<00:02:45.519> out<00:02:45.819> what<00:02:46.120> the<00:02:46.299> front<00:02:46.629> is<00:02:46.840> on<00:02:46.870> this

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:47.349 
did I find out what the front is on this

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:49.500 
did I find out what the front is on this
thing<00:02:47.620> until<00:02:47.860> I<00:02:48.099> started<00:02:48.730> looking<00:02:48.849> I<00:02:49.060> thought

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
thing until I started looking I thought

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.430 
thing until I started looking I thought
this<00:02:49.750> was<00:02:50.019> the<00:02:50.049> front<00:02:50.440> this<00:02:51.129> is<00:02:51.190> the<00:02:51.370> back<00:02:51.780> ok

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
this was the front this is the back ok

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.949 
this was the front this is the back ok
there<00:02:54.220> is<00:02:54.370> no<00:02:54.579> distinguishing<00:02:55.360> colors<00:02:55.720> on<00:02:55.930> it

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
there is no distinguishing colors on it

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:01.830 
there is no distinguishing colors on it
and<00:02:56.530> I<00:02:56.739> am<00:02:57.040> going<00:02:57.400> to<00:02:57.700> because<00:02:58.379> this<00:02:59.379> this<00:03:00.840> is

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
and I am going to because this this is

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.809 
and I am going to because this this is
wrong<00:03:02.230> now<00:03:02.590> if<00:03:02.889> you<00:03:03.069> have<00:03:03.250> to<00:03:03.370> hold<00:03:03.609> this

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:03.819 
wrong now if you have to hold this

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:06.599 
wrong now if you have to hold this
transmitter<00:03:04.510> like<00:03:05.230> this<00:03:05.590> with<00:03:06.130> the<00:03:06.280> spring

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:06.609 
transmitter like this with the spring

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:09.809 
transmitter like this with the spring
tension<00:03:06.880> and<00:03:07.299> try<00:03:08.139> to<00:03:08.200> reach<00:03:08.709> this<00:03:09.549> which

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:09.819 
tension and try to reach this which

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:11.759 
tension and try to reach this which
forces<00:03:10.209> you<00:03:10.480> to<00:03:10.510> fly<00:03:10.810> with<00:03:11.019> the<00:03:11.170> thumb<00:03:11.350> I<00:03:11.380> don't

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:11.769 
forces you to fly with the thumb I don't

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:16.319 
forces you to fly with the thumb I don't
fly<00:03:12.069> with<00:03:12.130> the<00:03:12.430> thumb<00:03:12.670> okay<00:03:13.480> so<00:03:14.109> I<00:03:14.500> can't<00:03:15.329> you

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:16.329 
fly with the thumb okay so I can't you

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:18.900 
fly with the thumb okay so I can't you
have<00:03:16.480> to<00:03:16.599> turn<00:03:16.750> left<00:03:16.810> to<00:03:17.349> do<00:03:17.500> this<00:03:17.739> you<00:03:18.639> have<00:03:18.670> to

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
have to turn left to do this you have to

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.530 
have to turn left to do this you have to
fly<00:03:19.269> and<00:03:19.599> turn<00:03:19.900> right<00:03:20.170> to<00:03:20.380> do<00:03:20.560> this<00:03:21.060> and<00:03:22.060> at<00:03:22.420> the

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
fly and turn right to do this and at the

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.390 
fly and turn right to do this and at the
same<00:03:22.720> time<00:03:23.079> do<00:03:23.290> this<00:03:23.530> which<00:03:23.859> is<00:03:23.889> spring-loaded

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
same time do this which is spring-loaded

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.809 
same time do this which is spring-loaded
I'm<00:03:25.389> taking<00:03:25.810> the<00:03:25.870> spring<00:03:26.230> out<00:03:26.380> right<00:03:26.620> now<00:03:26.829> okay

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:27.819 
I'm taking the spring out right now okay

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:30.409 
I'm taking the spring out right now okay
right<00:03:27.849> here<00:03:28.540> is<00:03:28.750> the<00:03:29.290> spring

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:30.419 
right here is the spring

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:32.970 
right here is the spring
let's<00:03:31.419> see<00:03:31.599> it<00:03:31.660> in<00:03:31.810> there<00:03:31.989> so<00:03:32.200> I'm<00:03:32.410> hoping<00:03:32.919> that

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
let's see it in there so I'm hoping that

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:38.309 
let's see it in there so I'm hoping that
if<00:03:33.220> I<00:03:33.370> pull<00:03:33.639> this<00:03:33.849> off<00:03:34.180> of<00:03:34.419> here<00:03:35.250> like<00:03:36.250> that

00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:38.319 
if I pull this off of here like that

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:43.319 
if I pull this off of here like that
there's<00:03:39.069> the<00:03:39.310> spring<00:03:39.670> I've<00:03:40.239> let<00:03:40.480> go<00:03:40.689> of<00:03:40.840> it<00:03:42.329> as

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:43.329 
there's the spring I've let go of it as

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:47.130 
there's the spring I've let go of it as
you<00:03:43.599> can<00:03:43.629> see<00:03:43.840> this<00:03:44.379> is<00:03:44.650> a<00:03:44.890> lot<00:03:45.579> less<00:03:45.909> so<00:03:46.750> I<00:03:46.780> can

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
you can see this is a lot less so I can

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.580 
you can see this is a lot less so I can
actually<00:03:47.379> try<00:03:47.860> to<00:03:47.890> hold<00:03:48.159> all<00:03:48.430> this<00:03:49.290> to<00:03:50.290> fly<00:03:50.530> it

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
actually try to hold all this to fly it

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.199 
actually try to hold all this to fly it
like<00:03:50.709> this<00:03:51.040> because<00:03:51.250> this<00:03:51.519> is<00:03:51.700> how<00:03:51.849> you<00:03:51.879> turn

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
like this because this is how you turn

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:55.140 
like this because this is how you turn
so<00:03:52.629> you<00:03:52.689> have<00:03:52.959> to<00:03:53.310> really<00:03:54.310> have<00:03:54.519> a<00:03:54.579> hold<00:03:54.879> of<00:03:55.030> it

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
so you have to really have a hold of it

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:22.350 
so you have to really have a hold of it
to<00:03:55.510> make<00:03:55.720> this<00:03:55.930> happen

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.880 

alright<00:04:23.360> I've<00:04:23.540> taped<00:04:23.780> this<00:04:24.050> thing<00:04:24.290> on<00:04:24.500> here

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:24.890 
alright I've taped this thing on here

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:26.740 
alright I've taped this thing on here
let's<00:04:25.220> go<00:04:25.370> ahead<00:04:25.580> and<00:04:25.670> turn<00:04:25.820> that<00:04:25.850> on<00:04:26.240> I<00:04:26.510> just

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
let's go ahead and turn that on I just

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.440 
let's go ahead and turn that on I just
taped<00:04:26.960> that<00:04:27.170> on<00:04:27.350> the<00:04:27.470> front<00:04:27.880> my<00:04:28.880> little<00:04:29.210> knot

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:29.450 
taped that on the front my little knot

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:34.260 
taped that on the front my little knot
and<00:04:29.480> those<00:04:30.050> novel<00:04:30.740> here<00:04:30.950> so<00:04:31.280> I<00:04:31.310> can<00:04:31.640> see<00:04:32.030> it<00:04:32.320> and

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
and those novel here so I can see it and

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:40.990 
and those novel here so I can see it and
turn<00:04:35.270> this<00:04:35.480> on<00:04:37.000> and<00:04:38.000> let's<00:04:38.810> see<00:04:39.580> what<00:04:40.580> happens

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
turn this on and let's see what happens

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.880 
turn this on and let's see what happens
you<00:04:41.240> have<00:04:41.330> to<00:04:41.480> be<00:04:41.750> able<00:04:41.840> to<00:04:42.220> push<00:04:43.220> this<00:04:44.560> turn<00:04:45.560> it

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:45.890 
you have to be able to push this turn it

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:54.790 
you have to be able to push this turn it
on<00:04:46.460> the<00:04:46.610> throttle<00:04:47.180> with<00:04:47.330> this<00:04:48.370> ok<00:04:53.500> optim-r<00:04:54.500> MIT

down

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:18.380 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:25.000 

it's<00:05:19.380> trimmed

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:25.010 

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:33.540 

there<00:05:25.580> is<00:05:25.760> no<00:05:25.970> trim<00:05:27.910> probably<00:05:28.910> this<00:05:29.090> thing<00:05:29.420> I

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:33.550 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:51.210 

need<00:05:34.550> to<00:05:34.670> push<00:05:34.850> that<00:05:35.060> off

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:51.220 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:06:05.790 

it's<00:05:51.790> a<00:05:51.910> handful

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:05.800 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:11.740 

that<00:06:06.800> is<00:06:07.130> a<00:06:07.699> handful<00:06:10.330> sorry<00:06:11.330> folks

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:11.750

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:17.710 
that is a handful sorry folks
I<00:06:12.940> recommend<00:06:13.940> that<00:06:14.000> instead<00:06:14.660> 10<00:06:15.169> bucks<00:06:15.410> more
