other<00:02:12.610> plane<00:02:12.880> I'll<00:02:13.120> tell<00:02:13.360> anybody<00:02:13.780> oh<00:02:14.470> you

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
other plane I'll tell anybody oh you

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.840 
other plane I'll tell anybody oh you
just<00:02:15.250> pull<00:02:15.490> straight<00:02:15.520> off<00:02:16.000> the<00:02:17.550> other<00:02:18.550> train

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
just pull straight off the other train

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.050 
just pull straight off the other train
is<00:02:19.150> about<00:02:19.600> 50<00:02:20.500> times<00:02:20.770> harder<00:02:21.370> than<00:02:21.400> that<00:02:21.580> cream

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
is about 50 times harder than that cream

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.690 
is about 50 times harder than that cream
to<00:02:22.420> actually<00:02:22.900> get<00:02:23.110> out<00:02:23.200> of<00:02:23.410> the<00:02:23.470> glitch<00:02:23.680> but<00:02:24.070> it

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
to actually get out of the glitch but it

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.370 
to actually get out of the glitch but it
was<00:02:24.910> the<00:02:25.210> one<00:02:25.390> where<00:02:25.600> I<00:02:25.660> actually<00:02:25.870> found<00:02:26.200> out

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
was the one where I actually found out

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:32.400 
was the one where I actually found out
to<00:02:26.530> split<00:02:26.800> with<00:02:30.540> piece<00:02:31.540> of<00:02:31.720> myself<00:02:31.840> about<00:02:32.260> it

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
to split with piece of myself about it

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.650 
to split with piece of myself about it
been<00:02:32.590> hard<00:02:32.800> I<00:02:33.220> know<00:02:33.970> that<00:02:34.120> this<00:02:34.210> is<00:02:34.270> little

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
been hard I know that this is little

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.490 
been hard I know that this is little
part<00:02:35.110> as<00:02:35.950> you<00:02:36.100> can<00:02:36.280> see<00:02:36.520> it's<00:02:36.730> these<00:02:37.120> little

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
part as you can see it's these little

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.470 
part as you can see it's these little
silo<00:02:38.500> type<00:02:38.770> thing<00:02:39.070> with<00:02:39.400> fire<00:02:39.670> at<00:02:39.880> thought<00:02:40.120> I

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
silo type thing with fire at thought I

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.750 
silo type thing with fire at thought I
was<00:02:41.110> for<00:02:41.530> example<00:02:41.980> you<00:02:42.040> just<00:02:42.220> get<00:02:42.370> on<00:02:42.459> the<00:02:42.550> same

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
was for example you just get on the same

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.479 
was for example you just get on the same
bitmap<00:02:43.209> as<00:02:43.390> well<00:02:43.600> and<00:02:43.900> you<00:02:44.709> do<00:02:44.830> the<00:02:44.950> same<00:02:44.980> thing

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
bitmap as well and you do the same thing

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:50.520 
bitmap as well and you do the same thing
this<00:02:47.550> fun<00:02:48.550> and<00:02:48.850> jump<00:02:49.239> and<00:02:49.450> your<00:02:49.900> hopefully

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
this fun and jump and your hopefully

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.840 
this fun and jump and your hopefully
view<00:02:50.860> stand<00:02:51.400> on<00:02:51.550> that<00:02:51.670> if<00:02:51.970> this<00:02:52.270> one<00:02:52.480> is<00:02:53.430> a<00:02:54.430> lot

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
view stand on that if this one is a lot

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:56.850 
view stand on that if this one is a lot
lot<00:02:55.090> harder<00:02:55.450> so<00:02:55.810> i'll<00:02:56.020> probably<00:02:56.260> end<00:02:56.440> up<00:02:56.590> and

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
lot harder so i'll probably end up and

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.979 
lot harder so i'll probably end up and
in<00:02:57.070> the<00:02:57.220> video<00:02:57.489> would<00:02:57.790> write<00:02:58.180> bak<00:02:58.600> second

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
in the video would write bak second

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:02.760 
in the video would write bak second
behind<00:02:59.110> either<00:03:00.840> but<00:03:01.840> saved<00:03:02.260> i'm<00:03:02.530> probably

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:02.770 
behind either but saved i'm probably

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:04.229 
behind either but saved i'm probably
going<00:03:02.950> to<00:03:03.040> end<00:03:03.070> up<00:03:03.220> ending<00:03:03.580> the<00:03:03.700> video<00:03:03.940> for

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
going to end up ending the video for

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:07.170 
going to end up ending the video for
sure<00:03:04.270> to<00:03:04.720> get<00:03:04.840> up<00:03:04.930> on<00:03:04.989> this<00:03:05.110> one<00:03:05.320> yeah<00:03:06.100> as<00:03:07.030> you

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180
