more mods to this helmet I decided I

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:14.509 
more mods to this helmet I decided I

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
solution so I got myself one of these

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.510 
solution so I got myself one of these
headlamps<00:00:19.020> well<00:00:19.710> I've<00:00:19.830> had<00:00:19.980> this<00:00:20.160> headlamp

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
headlamps well I've had this headlamp

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.849 
headlamps well I've had this headlamp
for<00:00:20.640> about<00:00:20.939> a<00:00:20.970> couple<00:00:21.300> of<00:00:21.359> years<00:00:21.570> now<00:00:21.750> and<00:00:22.020> it's

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
for about a couple of years now and it's

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.859 
for about a couple of years now and it's
it's<00:00:23.160> just<00:00:23.400> something<00:00:24.210> you<00:00:24.300> just<00:00:24.330> wear<00:00:24.660> around

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
it's just something you just wear around

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.240 
it's just something you just wear around
your<00:00:24.990> head<00:00:25.230> and<00:00:25.279> you<00:00:26.279> know<00:00:26.369> it<00:00:26.490> lights<00:00:26.730> up

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:28.250 
your head and you know it lights up

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.759 
your head and you know it lights up
that's<00:00:29.250> it<00:00:29.490> it's<00:00:29.640> simple<00:00:30.080> but<00:00:31.080> I<00:00:31.109> decided<00:00:31.500> I

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
that's it it's simple but I decided I

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.770 
that's it it's simple but I decided I
wanted<00:00:32.040> to<00:00:32.219> mount<00:00:32.610> this<00:00:32.820> to<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.059> help<00:00:33.360> to<00:00:33.660> the

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
wanted to mount this to the help to the

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.160 
wanted to mount this to the help to the
helmet<00:00:34.130> ideally<00:00:35.130> it<00:00:35.250> feels<00:00:35.430> mounted<00:00:35.820> here

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
helmet ideally it feels mounted here

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.709 
helmet ideally it feels mounted here
you'd<00:00:37.170> be<00:00:37.410> it'd<00:00:37.680> be<00:00:37.890> perfect<00:00:38.160> but<00:00:38.640> I<00:00:38.910> can't

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
you'd be it'd be perfect but I can't

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.260 
you'd be it'd be perfect but I can't
open<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:40.079> visor<00:00:40.520> if<00:00:41.520> I<00:00:41.700> mount<00:00:41.910> it<00:00:41.969> all<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.210> way

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
open the visor if I mount it all the way

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.580 
open the visor if I mount it all the way
back<00:00:42.420> there<00:00:42.719> then<00:00:42.930> it<00:00:43.050> doesn't<00:00:43.320> give<00:00:43.440> me<00:00:43.469> the

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
back there then it doesn't give me the

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.470 
back there then it doesn't give me the
angle<00:00:43.980> that<00:00:44.100> I<00:00:44.160> want<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.789> it's<00:00:44.910> kind<00:00:45.450> of

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
angle that I want and it's kind of

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.990 
angle that I want and it's kind of
awkward<00:00:46.879> so<00:00:47.879> what<00:00:48.090> I<00:00:48.120> decided<00:00:48.539> to<00:00:48.629> do<00:00:48.840> was

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000 
awkward so what I decided to do was

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.330 
awkward so what I decided to do was
Mahmut<00:00:51.260> mount<00:00:52.260> it<00:00:52.379> as<00:00:52.530> a<00:00:52.559> chin<00:00:52.920> mount<00:00:53.160> right

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
Mahmut mount it as a chin mount right

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.970 
Mahmut mount it as a chin mount right
here<00:00:53.399> right<00:00:53.789> at<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:53.969> right<00:00:54.390> at<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.600> chin<00:00:54.980> so

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
here right at the right at the chin so

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.520 
here right at the right at the chin so
hopefully<00:00:56.969> when<00:00:57.750> I'm<00:00:57.870> riding<00:00:58.079> like<00:00:58.350> that<00:00:58.500> I

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
hopefully when I'm riding like that I

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.069 
hopefully when I'm riding like that I
can<00:00:58.829> adjust<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.280> angle<00:00:59.309> here<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.780> get<00:01:00.989> it

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
can adjust the angle here and get it

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.840 
can adjust the angle here and get it
just<00:01:01.260> right<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:01.739> point<00:01:02.250> it<00:01:02.340> to<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.579> direction

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
just right and point it to the direction

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.300 
just right and point it to the direction
I<00:01:03.030> want<00:01:03.270> it<00:01:03.559> like<00:01:04.559> that<00:01:05.240> so<00:01:06.830> and<00:01:07.830> this<00:01:07.950> is<00:01:08.010> I

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
I want it like that so and this is I

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.980 
I want it like that so and this is I
mean<00:01:08.970> I<00:01:09.060> was<00:01:09.210> thinking<00:01:09.240> of<00:01:09.540> all<00:01:09.659> kinds<00:01:09.930> of

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
mean I was thinking of all kinds of

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.240 
mean I was thinking of all kinds of
fancy<00:01:10.320> mouths

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
fancy mouths

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.630 
fancy mouths
custom-made<00:01:12.000> LEDs<00:01:12.750> but<00:01:13.369> when<00:01:14.369> it<00:01:14.460> came<00:01:14.580> down

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
custom-made LEDs but when it came down

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.740 
custom-made LEDs but when it came down
to<00:01:15.030> it<00:01:15.590> this<00:01:16.590> was<00:01:16.799> like<00:01:17.119> the<00:01:18.119> easiest<00:01:18.540> solution

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
to it this was like the easiest solution

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.260 
to it this was like the easiest solution
just<00:01:19.409> just<00:01:20.280> getting<00:01:20.430> one<00:01:20.640> of<00:01:20.670> these<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.240> just

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
just just getting one of these and just

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.890 
just just getting one of these and just
begin<00:01:21.960> taping<00:01:22.530> it<00:01:22.799> on<00:01:22.950> forget<00:01:23.880> velcro<00:01:24.450> or<00:01:24.630> glue

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
begin taping it on forget velcro or glue

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.260 
begin taping it on forget velcro or glue
or<00:01:25.049> whatever<00:01:25.409> just<00:01:25.619> just<00:01:26.520> put<00:01:26.729> it<00:01:26.820> on<00:01:26.909> there<00:01:27.150> as

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
or whatever just just put it on there as

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.660 
or whatever just just put it on there as
a<00:01:27.299> temporary<00:01:27.720> solution<00:01:28.080> a<00:01:28.560> lot<00:01:29.310> of<00:01:29.430> times

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
a temporary solution a lot of times

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.480 
a temporary solution a lot of times
there's<00:01:30.390> um<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:32.540> lot<00:01:33.540> of<00:01:33.570> times<00:01:33.689> there's<00:01:34.490> like

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
there's um a lot of times there's like

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.719 
there's um a lot of times there's like
the<00:01:36.000> ultimate<00:01:36.659> solution<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.439> then<00:01:38.340> there's

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
the ultimate solution and then there's

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.539 
the ultimate solution and then there's
great<00:01:39.450> solutions<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:40.350> then<00:01:41.070> there's<00:01:41.280> good

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
great solutions and then there's good

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.499 
great solutions and then there's good
solutions<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.649> then<00:01:43.649> there's<00:01:44.509> crappy

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
solutions and then there's crappy

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.780 
solutions and then there's crappy
solutions<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:46.399> then<00:01:47.399> there's<00:01:47.729> um<00:01:48.860> like<00:01:49.860> no

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
solutions and then there's um like no

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.719 
solutions and then there's um like no
solution<00:01:51.360> just<00:01:51.570> do<00:01:51.689> nothing<00:01:51.869> and<00:01:52.490> I<00:01:53.490> think

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
solution just do nothing and I think

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.359 
solution just do nothing and I think
this<00:01:53.880> is<00:01:54.030> a<00:01:54.060> good<00:01:54.390> solution<00:01:54.950> with<00:01:55.950> minimum

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
this is a good solution with minimum

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.260 
this is a good solution with minimum
effort<00:01:56.610> so<00:01:58.070> hot<00:01:59.070> shoot<00:01:59.700> this<00:01:59.880> is<00:01:59.969> gonna<00:02:00.090> be

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
effort so hot shoot this is gonna be

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.389 
effort so hot shoot this is gonna be
sold<00:02:00.509> like<00:02:01.500> such<00:02:01.890> a<00:02:03.290> like<00:02:04.290> I<00:02:04.590> guess<00:02:05.159> you<00:02:05.189> would

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
sold like such a like I guess you would

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.089 
sold like such a like I guess you would
call<00:02:05.430> it<00:02:05.579> a<00:02:05.759> ghetto<00:02:06.030> mod<00:02:06.360> I<00:02:06.659> did<00:02:07.560> I<00:02:07.740> think<00:02:08.009> this

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
call it a ghetto mod I did I think this

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:13.690 
call it a ghetto mod I did I think this
is<00:02:08.160> gonna<00:02:08.280> work

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.520 

and<00:02:14.700> there<00:02:14.999> it<00:02:15.090> is<00:02:15.980> Wow

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
and there it is Wow

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900
