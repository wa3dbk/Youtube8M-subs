for example when Randy Grimes came to
passed<00:02:25.019> for<00:02:25.379> a<00:02:25.410> knee<00:02:25.680> replacement

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
passed for a knee replacement

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:29.390 
passed for a knee replacement
he<00:02:26.910> was<00:02:27.030> also<00:02:27.330> addicted<00:02:27.810> to<00:02:28.440> painkillers<00:02:28.680> at

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
he was also addicted to painkillers at

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.610 
he was also addicted to painkillers at
the<00:02:29.550> level<00:02:29.879> of<00:02:30.000> thousand<00:02:30.540> plus<00:02:30.690> pills<00:02:31.080> a<00:02:31.319> month

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
the level of thousand plus pills a month

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.920 
the level of thousand plus pills a month
and<00:02:31.950> he's<00:02:32.670> a<00:02:32.700> full-blown<00:02:33.180> addict<00:02:33.540> and<00:02:33.780> that

and he's a full-blown addict and that

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.540 
and he's a full-blown addict and that
makes<00:02:34.170> it<00:02:34.290> very<00:02:34.680> difficult<00:02:35.010> to<00:02:35.340> troubleshoot

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
makes it very difficult to troubleshoot

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.650 
makes it very difficult to troubleshoot
pain<00:02:36.319> I<00:02:37.370> actually<00:02:38.370> was<00:02:38.819> in<00:02:38.970> the<00:02:39.000> ER<00:02:39.209> for<00:02:39.390> the
