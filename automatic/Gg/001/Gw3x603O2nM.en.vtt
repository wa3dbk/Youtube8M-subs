ways of like rolling it back bringing a
foot<00:00:32.219> in<00:00:32.369> and<00:00:32.790> then<00:00:33.000> you<00:00:33.210> just<00:00:33.450> forget<00:00:33.719> about

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
foot in and then you just forget about

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.260 
foot in and then you just forget about
the<00:00:34.079> entire<00:00:34.440> move<00:00:34.710> itself<00:00:35.100> so<00:00:35.910> I'm<00:00:36.059> going<00:00:36.210> to

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
the entire move itself so I'm going to

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.880 
the entire move itself so I'm going to
break<00:00:36.420> it<00:00:36.510> down<00:00:36.630> into<00:00:36.840> three<00:00:36.960> parts<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.770> way

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
break it down into three parts the way

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.889 
break it down into three parts the way
to<00:00:37.950> get<00:00:38.160> in<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.969> wedgie<00:00:39.329> and<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.600> way<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:39.750> get

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
to get in the wedgie and the way to get

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.020 
to get in the wedgie and the way to get
out<00:00:39.960> so<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:40.950> way<00:00:41.040> that<00:00:41.250> I<00:00:41.280> get<00:00:41.399> in<00:00:41.640> this<00:00:41.820> is<00:00:41.910> my

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
out so the way that I get in this is my

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:49.040 
out so the way that I get in this is my
right<00:00:42.239> hand<00:00:46.100> my<00:00:47.100> right<00:00:47.129> leg<00:00:47.690> lift<00:00:48.690> my<00:00:48.870> right

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
right hand my right leg lift my right

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:59.150 
right hand my right leg lift my right
leg<00:00:55.760> and<00:00:56.760> I<00:00:57.420> stop<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:57.870> get<00:00:58.379> stuck<00:00:58.890> like<00:00:58.920> this

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
leg and I stop and get stuck like this

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.729 
leg and I stop and get stuck like this
so<00:01:00.090> when<00:01:00.239> I<00:01:00.270> do<00:01:00.420> move<00:01:00.859> it's<00:01:01.859> in<00:01:02.190> my<00:01:02.370> body<00:01:02.640> like

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
so when I do move it's in my body like

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:24.710 
so when I do move it's in my body like
so<00:01:04.739> it's<00:01:05.280> right<00:01:05.580> here<00:01:22.850> it's<00:01:23.850> all<00:01:24.180> in<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.509> hips
