00:06:33.839 --> 00:06:33.849 
battery into this battery and then

00:06:33.849 --> 00:06:35.610 
battery into this battery and then
putting<00:06:34.090> it<00:06:34.180> into<00:06:34.360> the<00:06:34.510> phone<00:06:34.690> so<00:06:35.440> you're<00:06:35.560> not

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:35.620 
putting it into the phone so you're not

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:36.629 
putting it into the phone so you're not
going<00:06:35.770> to<00:06:35.860> have<00:06:35.949> to<00:06:36.039> worry<00:06:36.159> about<00:06:36.250> the<00:06:36.460> case

00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:36.639 
going to have to worry about the case

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:39.180 
going to have to worry about the case
overheating<00:06:37.539> not<00:06:38.260> to<00:06:38.380> mention<00:06:38.560> the<00:06:38.770> case<00:06:38.979> just

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:39.190 
overheating not to mention the case just

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:41.550 
overheating not to mention the case just
looks<00:06:39.639> and<00:06:39.880> feels<00:06:40.090> really<00:06:40.389> nice<00:06:40.599> you<00:06:41.260> see<00:06:41.440> that

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:41.560 
looks and feels really nice you see that

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:43.649 
looks and feels really nice you see that
silver<00:06:41.830> trim<00:06:42.190> that<00:06:42.639> makes<00:06:42.970> it<00:06:43.030> look<00:06:43.210> like<00:06:43.389> the

00:06:43.649 --> 00:06:43.659 
silver trim that makes it look like the

00:06:43.659 --> 00:06:46.680 
silver trim that makes it look like the
stock<00:06:43.900> phone<00:06:44.820> so<00:06:45.820> it<00:06:45.909> doesn't<00:06:46.180> add<00:06:46.300> that<00:06:46.510> much

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:46.690 
stock phone so it doesn't add that much

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:48.390 
stock phone so it doesn't add that much
thickness<00:06:46.960> to<00:06:47.199> the<00:06:47.229> phone<00:06:47.470> and<00:06:47.740> it<00:06:48.190> gives<00:06:48.340> you

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:48.400 
thickness to the phone and it gives you

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.469 
thickness to the phone and it gives you
that<00:06:48.490> stock<00:06:48.820> look<00:06:49.530> protection<00:06:50.530> camera<00:06:50.919> and

00:06:51.469 --> 00:06:51.479 
that stock look protection camera and

00:06:51.479 --> 00:06:54.420 
that stock look protection camera and
the<00:06:52.479> phone<00:06:52.690> is<00:06:52.720> still<00:06:52.930> light<00:06:53.289> so<00:06:54.220> I<00:06:54.250> had<00:06:54.400> to

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:54.430 
the phone is still light so I had to

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:55.800 
the phone is still light so I had to
mention<00:06:54.729> that<00:06:54.849> I<00:06:55.000> normally<00:06:55.120> don't<00:06:55.479> do<00:06:55.659> this

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:55.810 
mention that I normally don't do this

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:56.969
