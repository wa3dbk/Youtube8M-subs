gonna<00:00:29.160> go<00:00:29.279> over<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.519> build<00:00:29.760> in<00:00:29.939> this<00:00:30.150> video

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
gonna go over the build in this video

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.630 
gonna go over the build in this video
but<00:00:31.109> I'm<00:00:31.320> this<00:00:31.650> is<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:31.890> first<00:00:32.099> time<00:00:32.279> I'm<00:00:32.460> gonna

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
but I'm this is the first time I'm gonna

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.270 
but I'm this is the first time I'm gonna
play<00:00:32.969> it<00:00:33.000> so<00:00:33.480> I'm<00:00:33.809> gonna<00:00:34.140> see<00:00:34.350> how<00:00:34.590> effective

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
play it so I'm gonna see how effective

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.310 
play it so I'm gonna see how effective
it<00:00:35.399> is<00:00:35.430> I<00:00:35.820> have<00:00:36.540> some<00:00:36.690> pretty<00:00:36.870> beastly

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
it is I have some pretty beastly

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.660 
it is I have some pretty beastly
cooldown<00:00:38.309> macros<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:39.710> the<00:00:40.710> damage<00:00:40.950> from<00:00:41.399> what

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
cooldown macros and the damage from what

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.850 
cooldown macros and the damage from what
I<00:00:41.700> tested<00:00:42.180> so<00:00:42.420> far<00:00:42.450> at<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.290> end<00:00:43.469> of<00:00:43.559> that<00:00:43.710> last

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
I tested so far at the end of that last

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.119 
I tested so far at the end of that last
conquest<00:00:44.489> just<00:00:44.670> attacking<00:00:45.090> a<00:00:45.450> folk<00:00:46.110> I<00:00:46.289> was

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
conquest just attacking a folk I was

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.450 
conquest just attacking a folk I was
pretty<00:00:47.340> decent<00:00:47.579> so<00:00:48.059> I<00:00:48.300> was<00:00:48.989> figuring<00:00:49.649> out<00:00:49.710> how

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
pretty decent so I was figuring out how

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.680 
pretty decent so I was figuring out how
good<00:00:50.640> this<00:00:50.760> is<00:00:50.820> going<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.120> be<00:00:51.210> now<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.449> best

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
good this is going to be now the best

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.600 
good this is going to be now the best
way<00:00:51.809> for<00:00:52.020> me<00:00:52.050> to<00:00:52.140> test<00:00:52.410> this<00:00:52.559> is<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:52.920> see<00:00:53.460> if<00:00:53.489> I

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
way for me to test this is to see if I

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.580 
way for me to test this is to see if I
can<00:00:53.789> find<00:00:54.030> someone<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.629> single<00:00:55.020> them<00:00:55.170> out<00:00:55.320> and

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
can find someone and single them out and

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.810 
can find someone and single them out and
do<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.309> one-on-one<00:00:56.670> against<00:00:57.300> them<00:00:57.449> but<00:00:58.820> we're

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
do a one-on-one against them but we're

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.630 
do a one-on-one against them but we're
gonna<00:00:59.940> go<00:01:00.600> find<00:01:00.899> out<00:01:01.109> really<00:01:01.260> quick<00:01:01.649> how<00:01:02.399> good

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
gonna go find out really quick how good

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.859 
gonna go find out really quick how good
this<00:01:02.789> spec<00:01:03.120> is<00:01:03.329> so<00:01:03.799> and<00:01:04.799> we<00:01:05.220> have<00:01:05.519> one<00:01:06.000> humor<00:01:06.570> so

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
this spec is so and we have one humor so

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.570 
this spec is so and we have one humor so
I'm<00:01:07.020> gonna<00:01:07.170> have<00:01:07.260> to<00:01:07.350> keep<00:01:07.530> that<00:01:07.710> in<00:01:07.860> mind<00:01:08.040> as<00:01:08.400> I

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.420 

I<00:01:47.539> mean<00:01:48.079> I'm<00:01:48.229> holding<00:01:48.619> my<00:01:48.649> own<00:01:48.799> for<00:01:49.219> the<00:01:49.280> most

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
I mean I'm holding my own for the most

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.190 
I mean I'm holding my own for the most
part<00:01:49.549> and<00:01:49.969> I<00:01:50.090> got<00:01:50.240> my<00:01:50.329> big<00:01:50.509> cooldown<00:01:50.719> I<00:01:50.899> just

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
part and I got my big cooldown I just

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.319 
part and I got my big cooldown I just
hit<00:01:51.320> so<00:01:51.560> I'm<00:01:51.950> gonna<00:01:52.399> be<00:01:52.610> dodging<00:01:53.030> pretty<00:01:53.240> much

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:53.329 
hit so I'm gonna be dodging pretty much

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:56.950 
hit so I'm gonna be dodging pretty much
every<00:01:53.630> attack<00:01:53.960> here<00:01:54.259> and<00:01:55.299> you're<00:01:56.299> dead<00:01:56.479> all

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
every attack here and you're dead all

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.200 
every attack here and you're dead all
right<00:02:00.219> it<00:02:01.219> seems<00:02:01.490> to<00:02:01.610> be<00:02:01.729> doing<00:02:01.850> quite<00:02:02.090> a<00:02:02.149> bit

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
right it seems to be doing quite a bit

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.359 
right it seems to be doing quite a bit
damaged<00:02:02.570> i<00:02:02.719> am<00:02:02.810> doing<00:02:03.110> more<00:02:03.350> dps<00:02:03.799> anyone<00:02:04.220> if

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
damaged i am doing more dps anyone if

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:05.529 
damaged i am doing more dps anyone if
i'm<00:02:04.460> looking<00:02:04.579> at<00:02:04.729> my<00:02:04.850> parser<00:02:05.179> right<00:02:05.299> now<00:02:05.479> and

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:05.539 
i'm looking at my parser right now and

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:07.660 
i'm looking at my parser right now and
for<00:02:05.810> everyone<00:02:06.200> in<00:02:06.319> the<00:02:06.409> area<00:02:06.439> i'm<00:02:07.100> doing<00:02:07.520> the

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
for everyone in the area i'm doing the

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.779 
for everyone in the area i'm doing the
most<00:02:07.819> dps<00:02:08.209> by<00:02:08.450> like<00:02:08.599> almost<00:02:08.810> 500<00:02:09.470> so<00:02:09.709> it<00:02:10.580> is

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
most dps by like almost 500 so it is

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:16.530 
most dps by like almost 500 so it is
pretty<00:02:11.000> effective<00:02:11.599> so<00:02:11.840> far

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.929 

so<00:02:17.140> damage<00:02:17.530> wise<00:02:17.709> isn't<00:02:18.129> really<00:02:18.280> an<00:02:18.370> issue<00:02:18.549> the

00:02:18.929 --> 00:02:18.939 
so damage wise isn't really an issue the

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:20.399 
so damage wise isn't really an issue the
mobility<00:02:19.420> is<00:02:19.480> good<00:02:19.689> because<00:02:19.900> of<00:02:20.140> the<00:02:20.230> run

big<00:02:34.659> he'll<00:02:34.870> cool<00:02:35.109> down<00:02:35.140> which<00:02:35.439> i<00:02:35.560> already<00:02:35.680> had

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
big he'll cool down which i already had

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.860 
big he'll cool down which i already had
to<00:02:36.159> use<00:02:36.400> and<00:02:36.730> it<00:02:37.120> came<00:02:37.299> in<00:02:37.450> handy<00:02:37.480> so<00:02:39.870> it's

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
to use and it came in handy so it's

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.289 
to use and it came in handy so it's
working<00:02:41.079> out<00:02:41.260> really<00:02:41.319> well<00:02:41.909> I'm<00:02:42.909> not<00:02:43.090> getting

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:43.299 
working out really well I'm not getting

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:44.940 
working out really well I'm not getting
a<00:02:43.329> lot<00:02:43.450> of<00:02:43.480> killing<00:02:43.870> blows<00:02:44.109> right<00:02:44.349> now<00:02:44.560> because

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
a lot of killing blows right now because

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.559 
a lot of killing blows right now because
everybody<00:02:45.489> seems<00:02:45.670> to<00:02:45.819> be<00:02:45.879> stealing<00:02:46.420> like

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569 
everybody seems to be stealing like

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:50.520 
everybody seems to be stealing like
Hills<00:02:46.870> but

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.670 

I<00:02:51.870> think<00:02:52.870> this<00:02:52.990> is<00:02:53.110> going<00:02:53.200> to<00:02:53.290> be<00:02:53.410> a<00:02:53.440> good

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
I think this is going to be a good

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.580 
I think this is going to be a good
candidate<00:02:54.190> for<00:02:54.250> a<00:02:54.430> hyper<00:02:54.640> inspect<00:02:55.240> so<00:02:55.590> this

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
candidate for a hyper inspect so this

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.309 
candidate for a hyper inspect so this
might<00:02:56.770> be<00:02:56.800> the<00:02:57.130> new<00:02:57.450> hybrid<00:02:58.450> pvp<00:02:59.020> spec<00:02:59.170> that

00:02:59.309 --> 00:02:59.319 
might be the new hybrid pvp spec that

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:02.580 
might be the new hybrid pvp spec that
robes<00:03:00.069> are<00:03:00.250> going<00:03:00.400> to<00:03:00.459> be<00:03:00.550> using<00:03:00.760> so<00:03:01.590> stay

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
robes are going to be using so stay

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.140 
robes are going to be using so stay
tuned<00:03:02.800> for<00:03:03.010> the<00:03:03.040> build<00:03:03.280> on<00:03:03.430> this<00:03:03.550> video<00:03:03.910> I'm

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
tuned for the build on this video I'm

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.120 
tuned for the build on this video I'm
gonna<00:03:04.330> do<00:03:04.990> this<00:03:05.110> entire<00:03:05.380> war<00:03:05.620> front<00:03:05.860> here<00:03:06.040> in

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
gonna do this entire war front here in

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:07.770 
gonna do this entire war front here in
the<00:03:06.220> video<00:03:06.459> just<00:03:06.790> so<00:03:06.880> I<00:03:06.940> can<00:03:07.030> get<00:03:07.209> a<00:03:07.270> little

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
the video just so I can get a little

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.080 
the video just so I can get a little
more<00:03:07.900> practice<00:03:08.350> with<00:03:08.590> the<00:03:08.800> spec<00:03:09.040> here<00:03:09.250> so<00:03:09.489> when

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
more practice with the spec here so when

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.090 
more practice with the spec here so when
I<00:03:10.120> make<00:03:10.300> the<00:03:10.420> build<00:03:10.630> video<00:03:10.959> I<00:03:10.989> can<00:03:11.290> be<00:03:11.440> a<00:03:11.470> more

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
I make the build video I can be a more

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:31.530 
I make the build video I can be a more
informative<00:03:12.610> so

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.240 

you<00:03:32.019> can't<00:03:32.230> catch<00:03:32.409> me<00:03:32.439> because<00:03:32.860> I'm<00:03:32.980> a<00:03:33.010> rogue

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
you can't catch me because I'm a rogue

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:40.970 
you can't catch me because I'm a rogue
and<00:03:33.579> I<00:03:33.610> run<00:03:33.819> faster

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:50.020 

a<00:03:41.069> nomadic<00:03:41.970> killing<00:03:42.360> spree<00:03:42.690> Oh<00:03:46.099> kill<00:03:47.099> him<00:03:47.280> too

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:51.900 

and<00:03:50.569> the<00:03:50.720> range<00:03:50.990> on<00:03:51.140> the<00:03:51.290> spec<00:03:51.560> is

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
and the range on the spec is

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.670 
and the range on the spec is
astronomical<00:03:52.910> because<00:03:53.240> of<00:03:53.390> marksmen<00:03:53.870> I'm<00:03:54.470> an

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:56.600 
extra five meters of range i can do so i

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.300
