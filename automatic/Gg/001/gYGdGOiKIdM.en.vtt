it<00:02:03.909> was<00:02:03.969> 99<00:02:04.299> which<00:02:04.960> again<00:02:05.710> is<00:02:05.770> insane<00:02:06.310> you<00:02:06.490> can

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
it was 99 which again is insane you can

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.800 
it was 99 which again is insane you can
do<00:02:06.820> you<00:02:07.509> can<00:02:07.630> do<00:02:07.750> laced<00:02:08.320> shots<00:02:08.739> you<00:02:09.070> can<00:02:09.100> do

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
do you can do laced shots you can do

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.449 
do you can do laced shots you can do
finesse<00:02:10.810> shots<00:02:11.079> and<00:02:11.320> he<00:02:11.709> will<00:02:11.890> basically<00:02:12.280> get

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.900 
know if that's going to influence how I
feel<00:03:02.740> about<00:03:02.770> this<00:03:03.160> guy<00:03:03.310> towards<00:03:03.640> the<00:03:03.790> end

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
feel about this guy towards the end

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.000 
feel about this guy towards the end
you're<00:03:04.060> gonna<00:03:04.120> have<00:03:04.300> to<00:03:04.390> see<00:03:04.540> and<00:03:04.900> you<00:03:05.800> could

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
you're gonna have to see and you could

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.200 
you're gonna have to see and you could
potentially<00:03:06.520> play<00:03:06.640> him<00:03:06.760> in<00:03:06.820> the<00:03:06.880> right<00:03:07.060> wing

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:07.210 
potentially play him in the right wing

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:08.640 
potentially play him in the right wing
position<00:03:07.480> you<00:03:07.990> could<00:03:08.110> potentially<00:03:08.560> play

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
position you could potentially play

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.470 
position you could potentially play
right<00:03:09.070> forward<00:03:09.460> position<00:03:09.760> I<00:03:09.970> personally

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
right forward position I personally

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.120 
right forward position I personally
think<00:03:10.900> it<00:03:11.080> would<00:03:11.170> work<00:03:11.200> it<00:03:11.590> right<00:03:11.740> forward

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
think it would work it right forward

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.850 
think it would work it right forward
quite<00:03:12.400> well<00:03:12.580> because<00:03:13.090> he's<00:03:13.690> quite<00:03:13.960> physical

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
quite well because he's quite physical

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.680 
quite well because he's quite physical
as<00:03:14.980> well<00:03:15.010> he's<00:03:15.400> not<00:03:15.580> he's<00:03:16.180> not<00:03:16.210> a<00:03:16.390> little

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
as well he's not he's not a little

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.260 
as well he's not he's not a little
weakling<00:03:17.080> like<00:03:17.160> if<00:03:18.160> I<00:03:18.340> compared<00:03:18.820> to<00:03:18.970> our<00:03:19.120> and

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
Leonard someone like that on the wing

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.200 
Leonard someone like that on the wing
would<00:03:20.620> the<00:03:20.980> quite<00:03:21.220> weak<00:03:21.490> and<00:03:21.730> you<00:03:21.820> won't<00:03:21.970> see

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:22.210
