00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.780 

I'm<00:01:49.990> leaving<00:01:50.440> my<00:01:50.590> pinky<00:01:50.920> finger<00:01:50.950> free<00:01:51.460> so<00:01:51.730> I

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
I'm leaving my pinky finger free so I

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.300 
I'm leaving my pinky finger free so I
can<00:01:51.940> grab<00:01:52.090> some<00:01:52.330> melody<00:01:52.690> notes<00:01:52.930> later<00:01:53.200> on<00:01:53.440> so

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
can grab some melody notes later on so

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:55.830 
can grab some melody notes later on so
basically<00:01:54.520> just<00:01:54.880> keep<00:01:55.240> in<00:01:55.390> mind<00:01:55.420> that<00:01:55.660> we're

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
basically just keep in mind that we're

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.960 
basically just keep in mind that we're
playing<00:01:56.050> an<00:01:56.290> F<00:01:56.440> chord<00:01:56.800> but<00:01:57.340> we're<00:01:57.550> never<00:01:57.730> gonna

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
playing an F chord but we're never gonna

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:59.970 
playing an F chord but we're never gonna
hit<00:01:58.210> string<00:01:58.570> five<00:01:58.840> so<00:01:59.200> I'm<00:01:59.320> not<00:01:59.470> gonna<00:01:59.650> fret

00:01:59.970 --> 00:01:59.980 
hit string five so I'm not gonna fret

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:05.100 
hit string five so I'm not gonna fret
that<00:02:00.130> normal<00:02:00.580> note<00:02:01.080> so<00:02:02.080> now<00:02:03.630> I'm<00:02:04.630> gonna<00:02:04.780> get<00:02:04.960> my

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
that normal note so now I'm gonna get my

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.550 
that normal note so now I'm gonna get my
octave<00:02:05.560> movement<00:02:06.190> with<00:02:07.150> my<00:02:07.330> thumb<00:02:07.570> we're

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
octave movement with my thumb we're

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:09.960 
octave movement with my thumb we're
gonna<00:02:08.649> be<00:02:08.830> doing<00:02:09.070> a<00:02:09.160> lot<00:02:09.369> of<00:02:09.430> back<00:02:09.700> and<00:02:09.880> forth

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
gonna be doing a lot of back and forth

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.720 
gonna be doing a lot of back and forth
between<00:02:10.180> C<00:02:10.869> and<00:02:10.899> F<00:02:11.320> so<00:02:12.010> it's<00:02:12.130> a<00:02:12.190> good<00:02:12.340> idea<00:02:12.490> to

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
between C and F so it's a good idea to

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.760 
between C and F so it's a good idea to
get<00:02:13.150> comfortable<00:02:13.510> just<00:02:13.990> rocking<00:02:14.380> that<00:02:14.560> bass

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
get comfortable just rocking that bass

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:26.150 
get comfortable just rocking that bass
note<00:02:15.040> back<00:02:15.490> and<00:02:15.700> forth<00:02:15.970> on<00:02:16.180> those<00:02:16.690> two<00:02:16.930> ports

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.220 

now<00:02:27.160> we're<00:02:27.400> going<00:02:27.550> to<00:02:27.670> add<00:02:27.940> some<00:02:28.870> finger

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
now we're going to add some finger

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.050 
now we're going to add some finger
picking<00:02:29.440> in<00:02:29.800> the<00:02:29.860> higher<00:02:30.280> register<00:02:30.880> of<00:02:31.030> the

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
picking in the higher register of the

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.030 
picking in the higher register of the
chord<00:02:31.420> so<00:02:32.080> we're<00:02:32.260> gonna<00:02:32.350> play<00:02:32.620> our<00:02:32.650> bass<00:02:33.010> note

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
chord so we're gonna play our bass note

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.610 
chord so we're gonna play our bass note
at<00:02:33.520> first<00:02:33.820> and<00:02:34.150> then<00:02:34.959> when<00:02:35.110> we<00:02:35.230> play<00:02:35.380> our

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
at first and then when we play our

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.520 
at first and then when we play our
second<00:02:36.070> bass<00:02:36.250> note<00:02:36.520> on<00:02:36.700> b2<00:02:37.270> we're<00:02:38.200> going<00:02:38.410> to

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
second bass note on b2 we're going to

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.120 
second bass note on b2 we're going to
come<00:02:38.770> in<00:02:39.010> and<00:02:39.280> play<00:02:40.260> string<00:02:41.260> 1<00:02:41.530> with<00:02:41.770> your<00:02:41.950> ring

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
come in and play string 1 with your ring

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.970 
come in and play string 1 with your ring
finger<00:02:42.160> also

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.399 

then<00:02:46.980> I'm<00:02:47.190> going<00:02:47.430> to<00:02:47.459> play<00:02:47.840> the<00:02:48.840> second<00:02:49.230> string

00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:49.409 
then I'm going to play the second string

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:51.500 
then I'm going to play the second string
with<00:02:49.560> my<00:02:49.590> middle<00:02:49.890> finger<00:02:50.340> and<00:02:50.549> notice<00:02:51.330> that

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
with my middle finger and notice that

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.320 
with my middle finger and notice that
that<00:02:51.690> happens<00:02:52.170> in<00:02:53.099> between<00:02:53.640> the<00:02:53.819> bass<00:02:54.000> notes

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
that happens in between the bass notes

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.750 
that happens in between the bass notes
so<00:02:55.049> we're<00:02:55.260> starting<00:02:55.470> the<00:02:55.799> syncopate<00:02:56.340> a<00:02:56.370> little

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
so we're starting the syncopate a little

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:04.410 
so we're starting the syncopate a little
bit<00:02:56.879> more

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.420 

together<00:03:05.420> and<00:03:06.379> that<00:03:06.590> middle<00:03:06.920> finger

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
together and that middle finger

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.570 
together and that middle finger
adding<00:03:08.390> on<00:03:08.540> now

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.390 

so<00:03:13.090> we<00:03:13.690> have<00:03:13.930> now<00:03:14.170> a<00:03:14.200> base<00:03:14.710> now<00:03:14.980> remember<00:03:15.370> our

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
so we have now a base now remember our

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.220 
so we have now a base now remember our
base<00:03:15.760> note<00:03:16.030> is<00:03:16.180> just<00:03:16.330> keeping<00:03:16.660> quarter<00:03:17.050> notes

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
base note is just keeping quarter notes

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.770 
base note is just keeping quarter notes
we're<00:03:17.440> keeping<00:03:17.830> time<00:03:18.100> and<00:03:18.450> we're<00:03:19.450> staggering

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
we're keeping time and we're staggering

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:26.080 
we're keeping time and we're staggering
the<00:03:20.140> melody<00:03:20.800> as<00:03:21.040> we<00:03:21.730> build<00:03:21.940> this<00:03:22.120> up

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.210 

that's<00:03:26.630> a<00:03:26.810> good<00:03:26.989> first<00:03:27.230> move<00:03:27.560> to<00:03:27.770> try<00:03:27.950> to<00:03:28.010> get

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
that's a good first move to try to get

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.190 
that's a good first move to try to get
down<00:03:28.459> that<00:03:29.120> takes<00:03:29.330> you<00:03:29.480> through<00:03:29.510> four<00:03:29.989> beats

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
down that takes you through four beats

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.530 
down that takes you through four beats
of<00:03:30.319> your<00:03:30.380> pattern<00:03:30.830> one<00:03:31.310> two<00:03:31.750> three<00:03:33.849> two<00:03:34.849> three

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
of your pattern one two three two three

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.620 
of your pattern one two three two three
four<00:03:36.340> one<00:03:37.340> two<00:03:38.470> three

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
four one two three

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:46.410

one<00:03:41.460> two<00:03:42.460> three<00:03:43.450> four<00:03:44.850> let's<00:03:45.850> add<00:03:46.030> on<00:03:46.240> to<00:03:46.390> that

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
one two three four let's add on to that

00:03:46.420 --> 00:04:08.630 
one two three four let's add on to that
now

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.980 

that<00:04:09.640> could<00:04:09.790> take<00:04:09.910> a<00:04:09.970> little<00:04:10.300> bit<00:04:10.480> of<00:04:10.540> finger

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:10.990 
that could take a little bit of finger

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:13.440 
that could take a little bit of finger
juggling<00:04:11.620> as<00:04:11.800> you<00:04:11.980> can<00:04:12.130> see<00:04:12.400> but<00:04:13.090> the<00:04:13.240> best

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
juggling as you can see but the best

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.630 
juggling as you can see but the best
advice<00:04:13.780> I<00:04:13.960> can<00:04:14.020> give<00:04:14.290> you<00:04:14.410> on<00:04:14.500> that<00:04:14.830> is<00:04:15.160> to<00:04:15.400> make

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:15.640 
advice I can give you on that is to make

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:16.979 
advice I can give you on that is to make
sure<00:04:15.670> that<00:04:16.030> you<00:04:16.150> just<00:04:16.360> keep<00:04:16.540> your<00:04:16.750> thumb

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
sure that you just keep your thumb

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.830 
sure that you just keep your thumb
consistent<00:04:17.830> and<00:04:18.040> played<00:04:18.760> a<00:04:18.790> steady<00:04:19.570> speed

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
consistent and played a steady speed

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.900 
consistent and played a steady speed
played<00:04:20.410> a<00:04:20.440> nice<00:04:20.709> slow<00:04:21.130> speed<00:04:21.519> that<00:04:21.760> you<00:04:21.880> can

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
played a nice slow speed that you can

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.270 
played a nice slow speed that you can
get<00:04:22.240> those<00:04:22.420> other<00:04:22.750> fingers<00:04:23.230> involved<00:04:23.620> so<00:04:24.070> now

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
get those other fingers involved so now

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.250 
get those other fingers involved so now
let's<00:04:24.550> take<00:04:24.730> a<00:04:24.760> look<00:04:25.000> at<00:04:25.300> another<00:04:25.600> pattern

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260 
let's take a look at another pattern

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260 
let's take a look at another pattern
that<00:04:26.410> we<00:04:26.560> can<00:04:26.740> use<00:04:27.010> when<00:04:27.340> we<00:04:27.490> change<00:04:27.760> to<00:04:27.940> our<00:04:27.970> F

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
that we can use when we change to our F

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:30.990 
that we can use when we change to our F
chord<00:04:28.600> now<00:04:29.140> once<00:04:29.440> again<00:04:29.590> I'm<00:04:30.040> not<00:04:30.490> playing<00:04:30.820> my

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
chord now once again I'm not playing my

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.820 
chord now once again I'm not playing my
F<00:04:31.120> chord<00:04:31.390> like<00:04:31.540> this<00:04:31.810> this<00:04:32.110> is<00:04:32.290> probably<00:04:32.620> how<00:04:32.800> a

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
F chord like this this is probably how a

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.960 
F chord like this this is probably how a
lot<00:04:33.070> of<00:04:33.220> us<00:04:33.310> learned<00:04:33.640> it<00:04:35.400> I'm<00:04:36.400> actually<00:04:36.550> going

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
lot of us learned it I'm actually going

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:38.820 
lot of us learned it I'm actually going
to<00:04:37.030> take<00:04:37.300> that<00:04:37.450> ring<00:04:37.780> finger<00:04:38.140> off<00:04:38.440> of<00:04:38.650> there

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
to take that ring finger off of there

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.580 
to take that ring finger off of there
and<00:04:39.040> put<00:04:39.130> it<00:04:39.790> where<00:04:39.940> my<00:04:40.090> pinkie<00:04:40.450> used<00:04:40.690> to<00:04:40.900> be<00:04:41.080> so

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
and put it where my pinkie used to be so

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.130 
and put it where my pinkie used to be so
that<00:04:41.770> I'm<00:04:41.890> free<00:04:42.190> to<00:04:42.370> add<00:04:42.520> a<00:04:42.550> note<00:04:42.880> up<00:04:43.030> here<00:04:43.140> so

that I'm free to add a note up here so

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:48.060 
that I'm free to add a note up here so
get<00:04:44.350> comfortable<00:04:44.620> with<00:04:45.010> this<00:04:45.190> move<00:04:47.070> adding

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
get comfortable with this move adding

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:49.680 
get comfortable with this move adding
your<00:04:48.160> pinkie<00:04:48.520> here<00:04:48.700> to<00:04:48.910> the<00:04:49.060> third<00:04:49.090> fret

your pinkie here to the third fret
that's<00:04:50.680> going<00:04:50.950> to<00:04:51.010> be<00:04:51.160> another<00:04:51.580> part<00:04:51.910> that

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970 
that's going to be another part that

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:53.970 
that's going to be another part that
will<00:04:52.240> add<00:04:52.450> into<00:04:52.960> our<00:04:52.990> next<00:04:53.380> finger<00:04:53.740> style

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:53.980 
will add into our next finger style

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:58.360 
will add into our next finger style
pattern

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:00.730 

so<00:04:59.060> here<00:04:59.389> on<00:04:59.540> our<00:04:59.690> F<00:04:59.870> chord<00:05:00.199> what<00:05:00.500> we're<00:05:00.620> gonna

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740 
so here on our F chord what we're gonna

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.810 
so here on our F chord what we're gonna
do<00:05:00.980> is<00:05:01.130> again<00:05:01.430> start<00:05:01.850> with<00:05:02.030> just<00:05:02.240> a<00:05:02.360> bass<00:05:02.540> note
