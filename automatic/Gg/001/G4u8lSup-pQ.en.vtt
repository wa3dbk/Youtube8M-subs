really<00:03:31.730> simple<00:03:32.090> we're<00:03:32.209> doing<00:03:32.450> this<00:03:32.540> but<00:03:32.690> you

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
really simple we're doing this but you

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.460 
really simple we're doing this but you
know<00:03:32.900> whatever<00:03:33.970> manual<00:03:34.970> I'm<00:03:35.750> guessing<00:03:36.320> this

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
know whatever manual I'm guessing this

glossy<00:03:42.290> headphones<00:03:42.860> and<00:03:46.000> two<00:03:47.000> cables<00:03:47.450> looks

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
glossy headphones and two cables looks

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.020 
glossy headphones and two cables looks
like<00:03:47.870> here<00:03:48.140> I<00:03:48.350> wonder<00:03:49.160> if<00:03:49.250> one<00:03:49.489> is<00:03:49.640> like<00:03:49.820> with<00:03:50.000> a

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
like here I wonder if one is like with a

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.440 
like here I wonder if one is like with a
mic<00:03:50.269> on<00:03:50.450> if<00:03:50.570> the<00:03:50.690> cell<00:03:50.930> phones<00:03:52.060> not<00:03:53.060> too<00:03:53.269> sure

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
mic on if the cell phones not too sure

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:54.940 
mic on if the cell phones not too sure
it<00:03:53.660> looks<00:03:53.870> like<00:03:54.049> to<00:03:54.170> take<00:03:54.350> their<00:03:54.500> kale<00:03:54.680> out<00:03:54.860> of

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
it looks like to take their kale out of

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.280 
it looks like to take their kale out of
the<00:03:55.070> out<00:03:55.220> of<00:03:55.340> the<00:03:55.430> bag<00:03:55.670> here

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.660 

so<00:04:00.290> it<00:04:00.380> is<00:04:00.410> like<00:04:00.530> a<00:04:00.620> flat<00:04:00.920> cable<00:04:01.370> i<00:04:01.400> think<00:04:01.580> it's

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
so it is like a flat cable i think it's

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:04.090 
so it is like a flat cable i think it's
an<00:04:01.760> anti<00:04:02.090> tangle<00:04:02.390> kind<00:04:03.350> of<00:04:03.440> cable<00:04:03.710> that's<00:04:03.860> very

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:04.100 
an anti tangle kind of cable that's very

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.250 
an anti tangle kind of cable that's very
cool<00:04:04.370> feels<00:04:05.180> very<00:04:05.420> high<00:04:05.540> quality<00:04:05.750> check<00:04:06.140> out

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:24.200 
long time they would kind of start to

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.840 
long time they would kind of start to
hurt<00:05:24.380> a<00:05:24.470> little<00:05:24.590> bit<00:05:24.770> that<00:05:25.280> the<00:05:25.310> problem<00:05:25.700> I<00:05:25.729> had
