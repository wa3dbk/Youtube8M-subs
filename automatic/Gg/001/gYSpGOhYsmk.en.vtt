and<00:00:04.710> today<00:00:05.339> we're<00:00:05.580> going<00:00:05.670> to<00:00:05.730> discuss<00:00:06.120> the

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
and today we're going to discuss the

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.140 
and today we're going to discuss the
role<00:00:06.480> of<00:00:06.529> protozoans<00:00:07.639> so<00:00:08.639> it's<00:00:08.790> important<00:00:09.090> to

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
role of protozoans so it's important to

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.089 
role of protozoans so it's important to
understand<00:00:09.570> what<00:00:09.780> a<00:00:09.840> protozoan<00:00:10.320> is<00:00:10.679> before

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
understand what a protozoan is before

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.820 
understand what a protozoan is before
you<00:00:11.160> can<00:00:11.190> discuss<00:00:11.610> its<00:00:11.880> role<00:00:12.620> protozoan<00:00:13.620> is

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
you can discuss its role protozoan is

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.369 
you can discuss its role protozoan is
actually<00:00:14.280> a<00:00:14.309> pretty<00:00:14.549> vague<00:00:14.910> term<00:00:15.389> it's<00:00:16.199> not<00:00:16.350> a

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
actually a pretty vague term it's not a

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.080 
actually a pretty vague term it's not a
real<00:00:16.710> distinct<00:00:17.160> group<00:00:17.490> it's<00:00:17.699> an<00:00:17.789> extremely

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
real distinct group it's an extremely

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.710 
real distinct group it's an extremely
diverse<00:00:18.330> group<00:00:18.720> actually<00:00:19.010> what<00:00:20.010> a<00:00:20.039> protozoan

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:20.720 
diverse group actually what a protozoan

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.560 
diverse group actually what a protozoan
usually<00:00:21.720> refers<00:00:22.080> to<00:00:22.109> is<00:00:22.560> a<00:00:23.570> unicellular

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
usually refers to is a unicellular

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.000 
usually refers to is a unicellular
eukaryotes<00:00:26.029> so<00:00:27.029> that<00:00:27.180> means<00:00:27.359> that<00:00:27.480> they<00:00:27.630> have

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:28.010 
eukaryotes so that means that they have

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.410 
eukaryotes so that means that they have
separate<00:00:29.010> organelles<00:00:29.490> in<00:00:29.760> their<00:00:29.880> cells<00:00:30.150> and

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
separate organelles in their cells and

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.120 
separate organelles in their cells and
all<00:00:30.510> that<00:00:30.660> sort<00:00:30.840> of<00:00:30.900> thing<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.349> usually<00:00:31.980> there

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
all that sort of thing and usually there

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.690 
all that sort of thing and usually there
are<00:00:32.160> only<00:00:32.279> one<00:00:32.610> cell<00:00:32.969> but<00:00:33.960> beyond<00:00:34.290> this

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:34.700 
are only one cell but beyond this

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.970 
are only one cell but beyond this
there's<00:00:35.700> really<00:00:36.030> not<00:00:36.989> a<00:00:37.290> clear<00:00:37.649> distinction

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
there's really not a clear distinction

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.979 
there's really not a clear distinction
of<00:00:38.160> what<00:00:38.340> makes<00:00:38.579> a<00:00:38.670> protozoan<00:00:39.270> some<00:00:39.510> of<00:00:39.660> them

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
of what makes a protozoan some of them

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.350 
of what makes a protozoan some of them
sort<00:00:40.530> of<00:00:40.620> resemble<00:00:41.010> animals<00:00:41.399> some<00:00:42.120> of<00:00:42.149> them

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
sort of resemble animals some of them

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.410 
sort of resemble animals some of them
resemble<00:00:42.600> plants<00:00:43.200> and<00:00:43.489> others<00:00:44.489> resemble

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
resemble plants and others resemble

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.400 
resemble plants and others resemble
fungi<00:00:46.160> so<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.460> role<00:00:47.730> as<00:00:48.450> you<00:00:48.660> may<00:00:48.809> be<00:00:48.870> able<00:00:49.260> to

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
fungi so the role as you may be able to

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.569 
fungi so the role as you may be able to
tell<00:00:49.920> from<00:00:50.850> their<00:00:51.840> diverse<00:00:52.230> nature<00:00:52.469> is<00:00:52.770> also

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
tell from their diverse nature is also

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.630 
tell from their diverse nature is also
very<00:00:53.820> diverse<00:00:54.500> some<00:00:55.500> protozoans<00:00:56.840> eat<00:00:58.640> or

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
very diverse some protozoans eat or

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.420 
very diverse some protozoans eat or
consume<00:01:02.210> bacteria<00:01:03.409> fungi<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:04.739> micro

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
consume bacteria fungi and micro

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.420 
consume bacteria fungi and micro
invertebrates<00:01:06.000> so<00:01:06.600> they<00:01:06.810> serve<00:01:07.229> as<00:01:07.439> consumers

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
invertebrates so they serve as consumers

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.580 
invertebrates so they serve as consumers
and<00:01:08.640> predators<00:01:09.439> they<00:01:10.439> also<00:01:10.770> are<00:01:11.640> major<00:01:12.090> decomp

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
and predators they also are major decomp

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.350 
and predators they also are major decomp
decomposers<00:01:13.590> when<00:01:13.860> things<00:01:14.040> die<00:01:14.310> so<00:01:14.700> they<00:01:14.909> they

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
decomposers when things die so they they

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.260 
decomposers when things die so they they
serve<00:01:16.400> ecosystem<00:01:17.400> functions<00:01:17.729> in<00:01:17.850> terms<00:01:18.060> of

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
serve ecosystem functions in terms of

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.820 
serve ecosystem functions in terms of
recycling<00:01:18.810> nutrients<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.409> breaking<00:01:19.680> things

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
recycling nutrients and breaking things

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.080 
recycling nutrients and breaking things
down<00:01:20.509> they<00:01:21.509> tend<00:01:21.900> to<00:01:22.020> control<00:01:22.740> bacteria<00:01:23.640> and

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
down they tend to control bacteria and

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.850 
down they tend to control bacteria and
sort<00:01:24.330> of<00:01:24.390> keep<00:01:24.600> them<00:01:24.900> from<00:01:25.229> getting<00:01:25.590> out<00:01:25.799> of

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
sort of keep them from getting out of

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.920 
sort of keep them from getting out of
hand<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:26.670> gaining<00:01:27.119> a<00:01:27.210> foothold<00:01:27.360> in<00:01:27.750> some

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
hand and and gaining a foothold in some

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.810 
hand and and gaining a foothold in some
environments<00:01:28.470> so<00:01:29.040> they're<00:01:29.280> important<00:01:29.610> there

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
environments so they're important there

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.719 
environments so they're important there
they<00:01:30.659> also<00:01:30.840> serve<00:01:31.259> as<00:01:31.500> food<00:01:31.890> so<00:01:32.340> they<00:01:32.549> get

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
they also serve as food so they get

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.580 
they also serve as food so they get
eaten<00:01:33.350> by<00:01:35.270> different<00:01:36.270> micro<00:01:37.049> invertebrates

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
eaten by different micro invertebrates

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.149 
eaten by different micro invertebrates
and<00:01:37.890> those<00:01:38.610> sorts<00:01:38.850> of<00:01:38.909> things<00:01:39.119> so<00:01:39.890> they<00:01:40.890> serve

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
and those sorts of things so they serve

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.280 
and those sorts of things so they serve
sort<00:01:41.850> of<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:42.060> one<00:01:42.689> of<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.869> functions<00:01:43.170> they

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
sort of a one of the functions they

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.370 
sort of a one of the functions they
serve<00:01:43.500> is<00:01:44.450> passing<00:01:45.450> nutrients<00:01:45.960> from<00:01:46.200> the

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.260 
bacteria and fungus and sorts of things
that<00:01:48.960> they<00:01:49.229> eat<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:49.790> then<00:01:50.790> passing<00:01:51.149> them

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
that they eat and then passing them

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.969 
that they eat and then passing them
along<00:01:51.570> to<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:51.930> micro<00:01:52.200> invertebrates<00:01:52.740> and

along to the micro invertebrates and

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.700 
along to the micro invertebrates and
other<00:01:53.340> really<00:01:54.149> small<00:01:54.420> consumers<00:01:55.140> that<00:01:55.439> eat

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
other really small consumers that eat

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.850 
other really small consumers that eat
them<00:01:56.009> in<00:01:57.229> addition<00:01:58.490> protozoans<00:01:59.490> also

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
them in addition protozoans also

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.870 
them in addition protozoans also
transmit<00:02:01.860> some<00:02:02.070> some<00:02:02.490> pretty<00:02:02.640> serious

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
transmit some some pretty serious

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.749 
transmit some some pretty serious
diseases<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:04.320> humans<00:02:04.350> and<00:02:04.860> other<00:02:05.219> organisms

diseases to humans and other organisms

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.210 
diseases to humans and other organisms
so<00:02:06.420> one<00:02:07.049> disease<00:02:07.409> that<00:02:07.560> you<00:02:07.649> may<00:02:07.799> be<00:02:07.860> extremely

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
so one disease that you may be extremely

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.609 
so one disease that you may be extremely
familiar<00:02:08.429> with<00:02:08.929> hopefully<00:02:09.929> not<00:02:10.080> personally

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.710 
that results from protozoa

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:15.520 
that results from protozoa

is malaria malaria is passed through

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.700 
is malaria malaria is passed through
mosquitoes<00:02:16.310> but<00:02:16.550> it's<00:02:16.670> really<00:02:16.820> a<00:02:16.910> protozoan

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710 
mosquitoes but it's really a protozoan

sleeping<00:02:21.410> sickness<00:02:21.710> is<00:02:22.100> another<00:02:22.400> one<00:02:22.580> that's

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670
