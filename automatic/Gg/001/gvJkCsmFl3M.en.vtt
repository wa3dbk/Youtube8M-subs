so<00:00:08.760> I've<00:00:08.970> moved<00:00:09.679> so<00:00:10.679> hadn't<00:00:12.170> made<00:00:13.170> any<00:00:13.290> videos

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
so I've moved so hadn't made any videos

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:20.510 
so I've moved so hadn't made any videos
in<00:00:13.769> a<00:00:14.009> while<00:00:16.460> this<00:00:17.460> is<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:18.380> 1983<00:00:19.380> Mako<00:00:19.710> 490

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
in a while this is the 1983 Mako 490

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.650 
in a while this is the 1983 Mako 490
that<00:00:21.180> I<00:00:21.270> have<00:00:21.510> and<00:00:22.350> what<00:00:22.890> I<00:00:22.920> want<00:00:23.160> to<00:00:23.279> do<00:00:23.490> is<00:00:23.939> I

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
that I have and what I want to do is I

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.380 
that I have and what I want to do is I
want<00:00:24.869> to<00:00:24.960> put<00:00:25.320> this<00:00:25.590> brakes<00:00:25.980> on<00:00:26.310> to<00:00:26.550> it<00:00:26.699> so<00:00:29.390> what

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
want to put this brakes on to it so what

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.330 
want to put this brakes on to it so what
I'm<00:00:30.480> going<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:30.660> try<00:00:31.140> and<00:00:31.289> do<00:00:31.410> is<00:00:31.800> I'm<00:00:32.250> gonna

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
I'm going to try and do is I'm gonna

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:38.569 
I'm going to try and do is I'm gonna
have<00:00:32.780> these<00:00:33.780> front<00:00:35.090> triple<00:00:36.090> trees<00:00:37.579> enlarged

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
have these front triple trees enlarged

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.490 
have these front triple trees enlarged
to<00:00:39.059> support<00:00:39.660> 43<00:00:40.559> millimeter<00:00:42.170> tubes

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
to support 43 millimeter tubes

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.639 
to support 43 millimeter tubes
so<00:00:43.950> I'm<00:00:44.129> looking<00:00:44.250> into<00:00:44.520> having<00:00:44.940> that<00:00:45.480> done<00:00:45.870> so

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
so I'm looking into having that done so

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.819 
so I'm looking into having that done so
we<00:00:46.920> have<00:00:47.039> here<00:00:47.399> is<00:00:47.489> I<00:00:47.579> have<00:00:48.379> these<00:00:49.379> need<00:00:49.620> new

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
we have here is I have these need new

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.340 
we have here is I have these need new
seals<00:00:50.329> so<00:00:51.329> I've<00:00:51.420> ordered<00:00:51.660> new<00:00:51.809> seals<00:00:52.110> we'll

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
seals so I've ordered new seals we'll

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.900 
seals so I've ordered new seals we'll
put<00:00:52.500> in<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:53.100> other<00:00:53.280> kind<00:00:53.489> of<00:00:53.550> leaking<00:00:53.879> a

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
put in the other kind of leaking a

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.389 
put in the other kind of leaking a
little<00:00:54.000> bit<00:00:54.239> but<00:00:54.750> these<00:00:55.410> are<00:00:56.510> this<00:00:57.510> is<00:00:57.629> from<00:00:57.899> a

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 
little bit but these are this is from a

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:03.080 
little bit but these are this is from a
1987<00:00:59.870> conventional<00:01:00.870> forks<00:01:01.170> from<00:01:01.289> a<00:01:01.430> cr125<00:01:02.430> and

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
1987 conventional forks from a cr125 and

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.090 
1987 conventional forks from a cr125 and
so<00:01:03.719> this<00:01:03.870> would<00:01:04.019> give<00:01:04.049> me<00:01:04.170> front<00:01:04.530> disc<00:01:04.799> brakes

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
so this would give me front disc brakes

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.250 
so this would give me front disc brakes
and<00:01:05.990> so<00:01:06.990> hopefully<00:01:07.710> that'll<00:01:08.130> be<00:01:08.250> an<00:01:08.430> easy<00:01:09.260> fix

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
and so hopefully that'll be an easy fix

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.490 
and so hopefully that'll be an easy fix
these<00:01:10.650> are<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:11.180> 42<00:01:12.180> millimeter<00:01:12.630> Forks<00:01:13.380> that

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
these are the 42 millimeter Forks that

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.740 
these are the 42 millimeter Forks that
raw<00:01:14.010> tomato<00:01:16.460> initially<00:01:17.460> these<00:01:18.299> ones<00:01:18.600> are

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
raw tomato initially these ones are

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.429 
raw tomato initially these ones are
actually<00:01:18.869> in<00:01:20.330> pretty<00:01:21.330> good<00:01:21.390> shape<00:01:21.540> since<00:01:22.320> I

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
actually in pretty good shape since I

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.289 
actually in pretty good shape since I
had<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:22.770> replace<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.549> seals<00:01:23.939> on<00:01:24.150> I<00:01:24.180> won't

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
had to replace the seals on I won't

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.700 
had to replace the seals on I won't
probably<00:01:24.509> do<00:01:24.720> is<00:01:24.780> put<00:01:24.990> those<00:01:25.200> on<00:01:25.770> my<00:01:26.720> 82<00:01:27.720> here's

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
probably do is put those on my 82 here's

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:37.929 
probably do is put those on my 82 here's
my<00:01:28.860> 82<00:01:29.369> as<00:01:30.119> you<00:01:30.240> can<00:01:30.390> see<00:01:31.460> is<00:01:32.460> leaking<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:36.560> oil

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:37.939 
my 82 as you can see is leaking the oil

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:42.980 
my 82 as you can see is leaking the oil
so<00:01:38.939> I<00:01:39.900> probably<00:01:40.970> take<00:01:41.970> these<00:01:42.180> Forks<00:01:42.540> out<00:01:42.659> but

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
so I probably take these Forks out but

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.469 
so I probably take these Forks out but
the<00:01:43.500> other<00:01:43.530> ones<00:01:43.799> on<00:01:44.780> the<00:01:47.149> so<00:01:48.149> if<00:01:48.210> I<00:01:48.270> can<00:01:48.390> get

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
the other ones on the so if I can get

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.560 
the other ones on the so if I can get
that<00:01:48.630> done<00:01:48.899> then<00:01:49.200> this<00:01:49.680> bike<00:01:49.890> here<00:01:50.329> will<00:01:51.329> have

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
that done then this bike here will have

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.870 
that done then this bike here will have
front<00:01:52.500> forks<00:01:52.829> now<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.040> reason<00:01:53.369> I<00:01:53.430> can't<00:01:53.640> use

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
front forks now the reason I can't use

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.219 
front forks now the reason I can't use
the<00:01:54.000> triple<00:01:54.180> trees<00:01:54.540> from<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:56.060> CR<00:01:57.060> as<00:01:57.990> you<00:01:58.079> can

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
the triple trees from the CR as you can

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.990 
the triple trees from the CR as you can
see<00:01:58.409> over<00:01:58.560> here<00:01:58.590> is<00:01:59.040> these<00:01:59.250> are<00:01:59.549> this<00:01:59.820> is<00:01:59.880> the

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
see over here is these are this is the

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.639 
see over here is these are this is the
mako<00:02:00.420> one<00:02:01.009> the<00:02:02.009> mako<00:02:03.049> are<00:02:04.049> first<00:02:04.290> of<00:02:04.439> all<00:02:04.500> this

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
mako one the mako are first of all this

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.069 
mako one the mako are first of all this
is<00:02:04.829> much<00:02:05.040> much<00:02:05.759> thicker<00:02:06.030> tube<00:02:06.360> than<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.719> CR

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
is much much thicker tube than the CR

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:11.510 
is much much thicker tube than the CR
and<00:02:08.009> this<00:02:09.000> is<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.450> outer<00:02:10.080> ring<00:02:10.530> bearing<00:02:11.370> that

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
and this is the outer ring bearing that

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.830 
and this is the outer ring bearing that
goes<00:02:11.670> into<00:02:11.849> the<00:02:12.000> frame

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
goes into the frame

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.770 
goes into the frame
as<00:02:14.200> you<00:02:14.380> can<00:02:14.500> see<00:02:18.030> on<00:02:19.030> this<00:02:19.180> one

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
as you can see on this one

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.970 
as you can see on this one
so<00:02:20.110> I<00:02:20.590> would<00:02:20.860> have<00:02:20.980> needed<00:02:21.190> to<00:02:21.310> figure<00:02:22.210> out<00:02:22.360> is

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
so I would have needed to figure out is

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.910 
so I would have needed to figure out is
getting<00:02:23.980> a<00:02:24.250> bearing<00:02:24.850> and<00:02:25.620> bearing<00:02:26.620> that<00:02:26.680> has

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
getting a bearing and bearing that has

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.240 
getting a bearing and bearing that has
the<00:02:27.100> same<00:02:27.280> inner<00:02:27.520> diameter<00:02:28.030> but<00:02:28.570> the<00:02:28.720> same<00:02:28.900> as

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
the same inner diameter but the same as

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.040 
the same inner diameter but the same as
this<00:02:30.250> one<00:02:30.310> but<00:02:30.640> same<00:02:31.090> outer<00:02:31.270> diameter<00:02:31.840> as<00:02:32.020> the

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
this one but same outer diameter as the

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.760 
this one but same outer diameter as the
maker<00:02:32.890> does<00:02:33.160> now<00:02:34.080> they<00:02:35.080> are<00:02:35.200> the<00:02:35.320> same<00:02:35.560> width

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
maker does now they are the same width

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.150 
maker does now they are the same width
apart<00:02:35.920> though<00:02:36.430> so<00:02:37.590> you<00:02:38.590> kind<00:02:38.830> of<00:02:38.860> see<00:02:39.040> that

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
apart though so you kind of see that

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.090 
apart though so you kind of see that
there's<00:02:39.700> a<00:02:39.760> little<00:02:40.240> bigger<00:02:40.500> but<00:02:41.500> it's<00:02:41.890> one

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
there's a little bigger but it's one

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.460 
there's a little bigger but it's one
millimeter<00:02:42.310> bigger<00:02:42.820> so<00:02:43.150> I'm<00:02:43.810> thinking<00:02:44.260> that

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
millimeter bigger so I'm thinking that

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.530 
millimeter bigger so I'm thinking that
instead<00:02:44.850> of<00:02:45.850> trying<00:02:46.030> to<00:02:46.180> do<00:02:46.240> something<00:02:46.420> like

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
instead of trying to do something like

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.580 
instead of trying to do something like
that<00:02:46.630> I<00:02:47.230> can<00:02:47.620> just<00:02:47.820> make<00:02:48.820> these<00:02:49.030> bigger<00:02:49.590> so

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
that I can just make these bigger so

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.400 
that I can just make these bigger so
that<00:02:50.800> would<00:02:51.040> help<00:02:51.280> get<00:02:51.790> front<00:02:52.750> disc<00:02:53.050> brakes

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
that would help get front disc brakes

00:02:53.410 --> 00:03:00.570 
that would help get front disc brakes
this<00:02:54.400> here<00:02:54.700> is<00:02:54.850> a<00:02:55.890> new<00:02:57.000> newer<00:02:58.260> yz250<00:02:59.400> front<00:03:00.400> end

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
this here is a new newer yz250 front end

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.760 
this here is a new newer yz250 front end
up<00:03:01.060> set<00:03:01.300> out<00:03:01.420> forks<00:03:01.780> that<00:03:02.020> was<00:03:02.260> gonna<00:03:02.500> put

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:02.770 
up set out forks that was gonna put

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.090 
up set out forks that was gonna put
these<00:03:02.920> ones<00:03:03.100> on<00:03:03.450> but<00:03:04.450> in<00:03:05.110> order<00:03:05.350> to<00:03:05.380> do<00:03:05.530> that<00:03:05.740> it

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
these ones on but in order to do that it

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.420 
these ones on but in order to do that it
would<00:03:06.630> take<00:03:07.630> a<00:03:07.690> big<00:03:08.140> modification<00:03:09.070> to<00:03:09.250> get

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
would take a big modification to get

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.900 
would take a big modification to get
this<00:03:10.060> to<00:03:10.270> work<00:03:10.450> and<00:03:10.810> then<00:03:11.680> since<00:03:11.950> I<00:03:12.280> was<00:03:12.700> kind

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
this to work and then since I was kind

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:14.190 
this to work and then since I was kind
of<00:03:12.970> worried<00:03:13.270> a<00:03:13.330> little<00:03:13.450> bit<00:03:13.570> about<00:03:13.660> the<00:03:13.870> frame

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
of worried a little bit about the frame

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.440 
of worried a little bit about the frame
how<00:03:15.130> it<00:03:15.250> would<00:03:15.370> handle<00:03:15.670> upside<00:03:16.000> down<00:03:16.120> forks

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
how it would handle upside down forks

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.949 
how it would handle upside down forks
and<00:03:17.040> I<00:03:18.040> really<00:03:18.370> don't<00:03:18.459> need<00:03:18.700> them<00:03:18.910> so<00:03:20.190> my<00:03:21.190> um

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
and I really don't need them so my um

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:23.820 
and I really don't need them so my um
another<00:03:22.959> reason<00:03:23.230> I<00:03:23.290> was<00:03:23.410> thinking<00:03:23.440> this<00:03:23.680> would

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
another reason I was thinking this would

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:25.770 
another reason I was thinking this would
work<00:03:24.120> just<00:03:25.120> because<00:03:25.209> if<00:03:25.360> you<00:03:25.420> look<00:03:25.570> over<00:03:25.750> here

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
work just because if you look over here

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:31.560 
work just because if you look over here
this<00:03:26.769> is<00:03:26.830> my<00:03:27.040> 86<00:03:27.790> Mako<00:03:29.700> 580<00:03:30.700> you<00:03:30.820> can<00:03:30.940> see<00:03:31.239> it

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
this is my 86 Mako 580 you can see it

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:36.630 
this is my 86 Mako 580 you can see it
has<00:03:31.780> the<00:03:32.050> exact<00:03:32.410> same<00:03:33.239> cr125<00:03:34.830> front<00:03:35.830> forks<00:03:36.220> and

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
has the exact same cr125 front forks and

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.030 
has the exact same cr125 front forks and
it<00:03:36.820> has<00:03:36.940> the<00:03:37.180> Mako<00:03:37.450> triple<00:03:37.840> trees<00:03:38.050> so<00:03:38.620> I<00:03:38.650> should

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
it has the Mako triple trees so I should

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.590 
it has the Mako triple trees so I should
be<00:03:39.220> able<00:03:39.340> to<00:03:39.459> have<00:03:39.640> that<00:03:39.820> work<00:03:40.030> I'm<00:03:40.269> not<00:03:40.300> sure

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.600 
be able to have that work I'm not sure

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.100 
be able to have that work I'm not sure
if<00:03:40.750> this<00:03:41.220> 86<00:03:42.220> came<00:03:42.430> stock<00:03:42.880> with<00:03:43.299> the<00:03:43.540> 43

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.110 
if this 86 came stock with the 43

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:45.900 
if this 86 came stock with the 43
millimeter<00:03:44.500> or<00:03:44.680> if<00:03:44.769> there<00:03:44.950> was<00:03:45.160> that<00:03:45.670> these

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
millimeter or if there was that these

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:47.820 
millimeter or if there was that these
were<00:03:45.970> modded<00:03:46.480> to<00:03:46.870> put<00:03:47.049> in<00:03:47.230> the<00:03:47.410> fourth<00:03:47.650> through

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:47.830 
were modded to put in the fourth through

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:50.729 
were modded to put in the fourth through
millimeter<00:03:48.160> but<00:03:48.600> since<00:03:49.600> that<00:03:49.750> has<00:03:49.989> it<00:03:50.260> I'm

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739 
millimeter but since that has it I'm

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:55.140 
millimeter but since that has it I'm
sure<00:03:50.980> I<00:03:51.010> can<00:03:51.220> get<00:03:51.310> that<00:03:51.489> one<00:03:51.640> to<00:03:51.760> have<00:03:51.940> it<00:03:54.150> the

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
sure I can get that one to have it the

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.850 
sure I can get that one to have it the
other<00:03:55.180> thing<00:03:55.450> that<00:03:56.019> I<00:03:56.290> was<00:03:56.470> going<00:03:56.560> to<00:03:56.680> try<00:03:56.799> to

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
other thing that I was going to try to

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.340 
other thing that I was going to try to
do<00:03:58.140> is<00:03:59.140> a<00:03:59.260> little<00:03:59.380> bit<00:03:59.530> more<00:03:59.799> of<00:03:59.890> a<00:03:59.950> stretch<00:04:00.250> is

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
do is a little bit more of a stretch is

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:07.860 
do is a little bit more of a stretch is
rear<00:04:02.350> disc<00:04:02.680> brakes<00:04:03.299> now<00:04:04.299> for<00:04:04.720> that<00:04:04.900> one<00:04:05.459> I<00:04:06.870> am

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
rear disc brakes now for that one I am

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.949 
rear disc brakes now for that one I am
actually<00:04:08.140> going<00:04:08.650> to<00:04:09.510> see<00:04:10.510> if<00:04:10.600> I<00:04:10.660> can<00:04:10.750> find

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 
actually going to see if I can find

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:14.340 
actually going to see if I can find
someone<00:04:11.320> to<00:04:11.380> fabricate<00:04:12.040> me<00:04:12.250> a<00:04:12.489> swing<00:04:13.060> arm<00:04:13.350> so

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.350 
someone to fabricate me a swing arm so

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:20.610 
someone to fabricate me a swing arm so
we'll<00:04:15.010> have<00:04:15.160> to<00:04:15.780> see<00:04:18.900> if<00:04:19.900> I<00:04:19.959> can<00:04:20.080> find<00:04:20.229> someone

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
we'll have to see if I can find someone

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.360 
we'll have to see if I can find someone
so<00:04:20.830> we'll<00:04:20.950> see<00:04:21.160> about<00:04:21.280> that<00:04:21.430> but<00:04:23.280> in<00:04:24.280> the

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
so we'll see about that but in the

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.060 
so we'll see about that but in the
meantime<00:04:24.580> I'm<00:04:24.849> looking<00:04:25.150> at<00:04:25.680> seeing<00:04:26.680> if<00:04:26.830> I<00:04:26.950> can

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
meantime I'm looking at seeing if I can

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.640 
meantime I'm looking at seeing if I can
get<00:04:27.250> this<00:04:27.400> front<00:04:27.760> work<00:04:28.270> done<00:04:28.599> how<00:04:29.530> these

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
get this front work done how these

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.650 
get this front work done how these
enlarged<00:04:30.160> and<00:04:32.970> see<00:04:33.970> if<00:04:34.030> I<00:04:34.090> get<00:04:34.210> front<00:04:34.479> disc

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
enlarged and see if I get front disc

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:43.310 
enlarged and see if I get front disc
brakes

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.380
