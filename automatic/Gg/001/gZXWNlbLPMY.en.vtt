there<00:01:46.390> are<00:01:46.750> a<00:01:46.810> lot<00:01:47.710> of<00:01:47.829> new<00:01:48.240> processes<00:01:49.240> and<00:01:50.200> a

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:50.439 
there are a lot of new processes and a

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:52.440 
there are a lot of new processes and a
lot<00:01:50.619> of<00:01:50.649> the<00:01:50.829> new<00:01:51.009> technology<00:01:51.700> and<00:01:51.970> what<00:01:52.270> have

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
lot of the new technology and what have

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.569 
lot of the new technology and what have
you<00:01:52.600> about<00:01:52.840> they've<00:01:53.110> gone<00:01:53.320> computerized<00:01:54.009> for

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:54.579 
you about they've gone computerized for

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:56.069 
you about they've gone computerized for
everything<00:01:54.970> where<00:01:55.149> I<00:01:55.179> started<00:01:55.720> back<00:01:55.869> in<00:01:55.899> the

at my age you know for my older
generation<00:02:10.780> came<00:02:11.530> back<00:02:11.769> in<00:02:12.010> and<00:02:12.250> I'm<00:02:12.459> learning

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
generation came back in and I'm learning

an awful lot that was not you know
talked<00:02:16.840> to<00:02:17.019> me<00:02:17.230> when<00:02:17.590> I<00:02:17.620> first<00:02:17.920> started<00:02:18.250> out<00:02:18.400> in

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
talked to me when I first started out in

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.550 
talked to me when I first started out in
the<00:02:18.700> welding<00:02:19.060> field<00:02:19.360> so<00:02:19.720> it's<00:02:20.049> an<00:02:20.349> amazing

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
the welding field so it's an amazing

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.770 
the welding field so it's an amazing
program<00:02:21.069> all<00:02:21.760> the<00:02:21.940> teachers<00:02:22.330> have<00:02:22.450> a<00:02:22.510> lot<00:02:22.569> of

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
program all the teachers have a lot of

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.930 
program all the teachers have a lot of
experience<00:02:23.349> they<00:02:23.650> know<00:02:24.010> a<00:02:24.040> lot<00:02:24.310> they're

really good at explaining things and

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.520 
really good at explaining things and
clear<00:02:27.819> on<00:02:27.970> understanding<00:02:28.750> way<00:02:28.900> we've<00:02:29.319> got

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
clear on understanding way we've got

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.880 
clear on understanding way we've got
several<00:02:30.489> simulations<00:02:30.880> and<00:02:31.540> a<00:02:32.140> few<00:02:32.470> virtual

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890

machines
what<00:02:34.239> virtual<00:02:34.720> gives<00:02:34.959> you<00:02:35.110> is<00:02:35.230> it<00:02:35.260> gives<00:02:35.380> you

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
what virtual gives you is it gives you

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.710 
what virtual gives you is it gives you
the<00:02:35.680> ability<00:02:36.069> to<00:02:36.280> teach<00:02:37.150> somebody<00:02:37.420> how<00:02:37.630> to

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
the ability to teach somebody how to

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.839 
the ability to teach somebody how to
weld<00:02:38.079> without<00:02:38.739> him<00:02:38.860> ever<00:02:38.980> striking<00:02:39.610> and<00:02:39.730> on

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:39.849 
weld without him ever striking and on

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:42.089 
weld without him ever striking and on
they<00:02:40.540> earn<00:02:40.780> their<00:02:41.079> money<00:02:41.140> when<00:02:41.530> they<00:02:41.680> work<00:02:41.950> in

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:42.099 
they earn their money when they work in

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:44.280 
they earn their money when they work in
this<00:02:42.220> field<00:02:42.489> there's<00:02:43.299> no<00:02:43.540> doubt<00:02:43.780> about<00:02:43.930> that

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
this field there's no doubt about that

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.160 
this field there's no doubt about that
and<00:02:44.709> the<00:02:45.069> virtual<00:02:45.459> pieces<00:02:45.819> are<00:02:45.970> just<00:02:46.390> it's

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
and the virtual pieces are just it's

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.020 
and the virtual pieces are just it's
another<00:02:47.440> tool<00:02:47.769> we<00:02:47.980> have<00:02:48.010> in<00:02:48.310> the<00:02:48.400> toolbox<00:02:48.819> to

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
another tool we have in the toolbox to

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.360 
another tool we have in the toolbox to
be<00:02:49.090> able<00:02:49.180> to<00:02:49.299> train<00:02:49.620> someone<00:02:50.620> he<00:02:50.799> said<00:02:51.069> that

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
be able to train someone he said that

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.860 
be able to train someone he said that
the<00:02:51.489> average<00:02:51.670> age<00:02:52.090> for<00:02:52.150> a<00:02:52.569> welder<00:02:52.959> is<00:02:53.230> 56

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
the average age for a welder is 56

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.150 
the average age for a welder is 56
meaning<00:02:55.870> they're<00:02:56.410> gonna<00:02:56.530> start<00:02:56.799> retiring

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
meaning they're gonna start retiring

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.530 
meaning they're gonna start retiring
here<00:02:57.459> soon<00:02:57.700> and<00:02:57.910> they're<00:02:58.000> gonna<00:02:58.090> need<00:02:58.299> more

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
here soon and they're gonna need more

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:59.970 
here soon and they're gonna need more
welders<00:02:58.780> and<00:02:58.989> more<00:02:59.260> well<00:02:59.470> there's<00:02:59.680> as<00:02:59.799> time

welders and more well there's as time
goes<00:03:00.220> on<00:03:00.370> you've<00:03:01.000> got<00:03:01.239> huge<00:03:01.950> construction

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
goes on you've got huge construction

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.530 
goes on you've got huge construction
projects<00:03:03.370> in<00:03:03.459> this<00:03:03.609> region<00:03:04.000> that<00:03:04.120> are<00:03:04.180> going

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
projects in this region that are going

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.379 
projects in this region that are going
crazy<00:03:04.959> when<00:03:05.950> I<00:03:05.980> first<00:03:06.310> started<00:03:06.760> out<00:03:06.940> they<00:03:07.150> said

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:07.389 
crazy when I first started out they said

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:09.300 
crazy when I first started out they said
we're<00:03:07.540> gonna<00:03:07.660> get<00:03:07.930> replaced<00:03:08.380> by<00:03:08.590> robots<00:03:08.859> well

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
we're gonna get replaced by robots well

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:10.770 
we're gonna get replaced by robots well
we<00:03:09.459> still<00:03:09.700> haven't<00:03:09.940> found<00:03:10.120> a<00:03:10.269> robot<00:03:10.540> that<00:03:10.630> can

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
we still haven't found a robot that can

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.860 
we still haven't found a robot that can
weld<00:03:11.019> in<00:03:11.139> a<00:03:11.230> ditch<00:03:11.470> climb<00:03:12.310> a<00:03:12.340> ladder<00:03:12.630> or<00:03:13.630> lay

weld in a ditch climb a ladder or lay

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.420 
weld in a ditch climb a ladder or lay
underneath<00:03:14.170> something<00:03:14.560> them<00:03:14.799> well<00:03:14.950> this<00:03:15.250> is

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
underneath something them well this is

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:16.860 
underneath something them well this is
one<00:03:15.579> of<00:03:15.609> a<00:03:15.730> few<00:03:15.850> places<00:03:16.120> where<00:03:16.329> you<00:03:16.420> can<00:03:16.600> get

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
one of a few places where you can get

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.629 
one of a few places where you can get
those<00:03:17.079> skills<00:03:17.470> to<00:03:17.829> be<00:03:17.920> able<00:03:17.980> to<00:03:18.160> get<00:03:18.400> those

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:18.639 
those skills to be able to get those

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:21.150 
those skills to be able to get those
jobs<00:03:18.940> and<00:03:19.299> that's<00:03:20.019> the<00:03:20.319> important<00:03:20.799> part<00:03:20.920> we

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
jobs and that's the important part we

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.490 
jobs and that's the important part we
take<00:03:21.340> pride<00:03:21.579> blowing<00:03:21.970> and<00:03:22.209> that's<00:03:22.600> the

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
take pride blowing and that's the

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.110 
take pride blowing and that's the
program<00:03:23.739> reflects<00:03:24.489> that<00:03:24.730> and<00:03:24.940> I<00:03:25.060> think

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
program reflects that and I think

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.780 
program reflects that and I think
welding<00:03:25.630> in<00:03:25.720> general<00:03:26.230> flexes<00:03:26.799> you<00:03:27.430> know<00:03:27.519> if

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
welding in general flexes you know if

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.670 
welding in general flexes you know if
there's<00:03:28.120> if<00:03:28.540> you<00:03:28.750> talk<00:03:29.019> to<00:03:29.200> anybody<00:03:29.350> that's

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
there's if you talk to anybody that's

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.220 
there's if you talk to anybody that's
been<00:03:29.859> a<00:03:30.069> welder<00:03:30.489> it's<00:03:31.329> probably<00:03:31.750> the<00:03:32.019> most

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
been a welder it's probably the most

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.250
