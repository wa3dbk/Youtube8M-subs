00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:06.899
 hello citizens gardeners 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.990
 surely each of you somewhere in 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.870
 barn lying around some old 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.809
 sprayers like this 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:19.470
 I have this too 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:26.099
 representative a dad 211 who 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:26.670
 the pump body broke down the whole tube too 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.640
 whole 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:33.180
 and what will they do to brass pipes 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:37.530
 plastic is not the only truth that i 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.920
 did as you see i took an epoxy 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:44.460
 medical bandage resin 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.440
 wrapped how I strengthened these 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.840
 parts 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:54.840
 but now it is not on the sides of speech on speech 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:59.719
 will go but that's about this pump in this 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.930
 the pump here in this place was 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:04.559
 cuff 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:09.150
 but this cuff flew over time 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:14.420
 Naturally the weakest point is not erased 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:19.110
 swill here and it was necessary 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:21.390
 I went to the market to look for the rod to me 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.200
 They said that it was useless that 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.520
 at the rods 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:30.420
 that these cuffs are no longer produced, and 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:34.130
 pumping who would be able to enter this 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:37.920
 the hole is unlikely I will find too so I 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:42.270
 thought thought that such came to me 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:44.960
 and what if you use another pump and in 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.520
 particular car pump 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.890
 Here's a hand car pump 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.189
 you know that you can rock perfectly 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:56.729
 a wheel for a balloon 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:59.190
 but it remains only to think of it 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:02.640
 to make 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:09.500
 need some valve here you come 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:14.240
 such an idea in the head to buy a nipple for 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:18.530
 car cam up to no cameras 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.530
 By the way, 5 hryvnia costs only 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:30.150
 the nipple I put in here he came over 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:33.540
 size handle here I was free 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.930
 glue smeared moment yes you can scientific 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.890
 any kind of rubber somehow 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.830
 assistant to warm here not 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.470
 came in although it is not fundamental 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:47.100
 But in order for the nipple not to jump out 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:51.570
 I screwed it with two screws 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:55.470
 until found by i put shaybochki 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:03:01.160
 rubber ventil excess 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:01.160
 snapped well that's all ready 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:13.230
 now you can fasten it and 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:17.480
 enjoy but I thought that here 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:22.950
 will get a chemical solution and 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:27.650
 well is it not but we have old 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:28.950
 old cylinder so it stands 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:34.080
 to wind 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:37.010
 and use as is to 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:40.470
 he also has the second valve 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:44.480
 which will help us here for what but if 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:49.080
 do you remember when we screwed on 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:54.660
 nipple pump fitting then at some point 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:57.239
 we hear the air puff out if 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:02.519
 will stand here as the second valve here 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:04.630
 then this step will not be fine here 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:08.290
 everything 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:17.800
 it was left just to fasten it 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:21.090
 one moment I took this pen because 

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:30.250
 we needed it in order to tight 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:32.530
 twist this part here but it was necessary 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:35.940
 fit in general i drilled here 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:39.670
 the hole is a little bit thicker 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:45.640
 drill 10 that's about to that size 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:48.240
 Well, at this height a little sawed here 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:56.190
 these parts so that they do not rest 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:58.930
 my soups 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:05.010
 I wind up like this I end up and 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:10.170
 That's how I answer but that's all 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:10.170
 can try and you have
