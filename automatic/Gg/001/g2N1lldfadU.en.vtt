00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
like Sam Claflin are taking those roles

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.710 
like Sam Claflin are taking those roles
you<00:03:47.400> know<00:03:47.519> what's<00:03:48.030> that<00:03:48.180> going<00:03:48.359> to<00:03:48.450> mean<00:03:48.660> for

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
you know what's that going to mean for

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.660 
you know what's that going to mean for
diversity<00:03:49.410> going<00:03:49.709> forward<00:03:50.069> but<00:03:50.160> anyway<00:03:50.459> back

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
diversity going forward but anyway back

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.150 
diversity going forward but anyway back
to<00:03:50.700> the<00:03:50.910> quiet<00:03:51.180> ones<00:03:51.450> the<00:03:52.440> film<00:03:52.680> that<00:03:52.950> takes

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
to the quiet ones the film that takes

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.339 
to the quiet ones the film that takes
place<00:03:53.400> during<00:03:53.670> the<00:03:53.880> 70's<00:03:54.389> and<00:03:54.660> I<00:03:54.900> think<00:03:55.109> a<00:03:55.170> big

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:55.349 
place during the 70's and I think a big

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:57.349 
place during the 70's and I think a big
problem<00:03:55.769> is<00:03:55.950> that<00:03:55.980> the<00:03:56.190> film<00:03:56.430> kind<00:03:56.940> of<00:03:57.090> seems

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:57.359 
problem is that the film kind of seems

00:03:57.359 --> 00:03:59.330 
problem is that the film kind of seems
like<00:03:57.540> it<00:03:57.660> was<00:03:57.810> made<00:03:58.049> in<00:03:58.230> the<00:03:58.349> 70s<00:03:58.859> and<00:03:59.040> has<00:03:59.160> some

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
like it was made in the 70s and has some

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:00.680 
like it was made in the 70s and has some
of<00:03:59.430> the<00:03:59.489> problems<00:03:59.880> from<00:04:00.000> that<00:04:00.209> era<00:04:00.450> of

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
of the problems from that era of

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.659 
of the problems from that era of
moviemaking<00:04:01.139> of<00:04:01.349> course<00:04:01.560> for<00:04:02.069> horror<00:04:02.280> film

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:02.669 
moviemaking of course for horror film

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:04.460 
moviemaking of course for horror film
there<00:04:03.030> was<00:04:03.150> some<00:04:03.359> fantastic<00:04:03.989> films<00:04:04.230> that<00:04:04.319> came

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
there was some fantastic films that came

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.710 
there was some fantastic films that came
out<00:04:04.620> at<00:04:04.709> that<00:04:04.859> period<00:04:05.250> right<00:04:05.880> before<00:04:06.239> the<00:04:06.329> 70s

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
out at that period right before the 70s

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:07.849 
out at that period right before the 70s
of<00:04:06.840> course<00:04:07.019> there<00:04:07.169> was<00:04:07.230> the<00:04:07.380> shining<00:04:07.799> I

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:07.859 
of course there was the shining I

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:10.069 
of course there was the shining I
believe<00:04:08.099> 1968<00:04:09.060> I<00:04:09.090> think<00:04:09.419> that<00:04:09.540> was<00:04:09.660> that<00:04:09.690> year

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:10.079 
believe 1968 I think that was that year

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:11.839 
believe 1968 I think that was that year
on<00:04:10.290> the<00:04:10.709> United<00:04:11.130> the<00:04:11.160> Living<00:04:11.430> Dead<00:04:11.609> also

on the United the Living Dead also

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:13.940 
on the United the Living Dead also
coming<00:04:12.239> out<00:04:12.359> right<00:04:12.510> before<00:04:12.780> the<00:04:12.900> 70s<00:04:13.349> but

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
coming out right before the 70s but

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:15.530 
coming out right before the 70s but
there<00:04:14.099> was<00:04:14.220> a<00:04:14.250> period<00:04:14.549> of<00:04:14.730> time<00:04:14.940> a<00:04:15.239> Rocky

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
there was a period of time a Rocky

Horror Picture Show you know there was a
period<00:04:18.299> of<00:04:18.419> time<00:04:18.660> in<00:04:18.870> the<00:04:19.229> 70s<00:04:19.680> where<00:04:19.769> they

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
period of time in the 70s where they

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.379 
period of time in the 70s where they
were<00:04:19.919> churning<00:04:20.430> out<00:04:20.669> kind<00:04:21.060> of<00:04:21.090> like<00:04:21.209> these

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:21.389

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
Hyde was one of those films but those

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.040 
Hyde was one of those films but those

direction true to form to a lot of
college<00:04:41.340> experiments<00:04:42.210> there's<00:04:42.479> some<00:04:42.719> other

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
college experiments there's some other

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.230 
college experiments there's some other
kind<00:04:43.169> of<00:04:43.229> experimenting<00:04:43.979> going<00:04:44.250> on<00:04:44.430> and

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
kind of experimenting going on and

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.360 
kind of experimenting going on and
people<00:04:45.390> are<00:04:45.599> really

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370 
people are really

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.040 
people are really
saying<00:04:46.610> on<00:04:46.699> much<00:04:46.850> on<00:04:47.060> their<00:04:47.270> studies<00:04:47.690> as<00:04:47.870> they

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
saying on much on their studies as they

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.530 
saying on much on their studies as they
should<00:04:48.310> but<00:04:49.310> the<00:04:49.430> film<00:04:49.639> never<00:04:49.820> really<00:04:50.090> goes<00:04:50.270> in

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:50.540 
should but the film never really goes in

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.180 
should but the film never really goes in
that<00:04:50.810> direction<00:04:50.990> either<00:04:51.410> perhaps<00:04:51.650> because<00:04:52.070> it

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.190 
that direction either perhaps because it

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:54.370 
that direction either perhaps because it
wants<00:04:52.430> to<00:04:52.490> have<00:04:52.669> you<00:04:53.030> know<00:04:53.120> a<00:04:53.150> more<00:04:53.360> age<00:04:53.870> all

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:54.380 
wants to have you know a more age all

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.670 
wants to have you know a more age all
age-friendly<00:04:54.590> rating<00:04:55.600> but<00:04:56.600> I<00:04:56.930> think<00:04:57.410> that<00:04:57.560> if

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
age-friendly rating but I think that if

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:58.870 
age-friendly rating but I think that if
you're<00:04:57.830> not<00:04:58.010> going<00:04:58.220> to<00:04:58.370> go<00:04:58.490> in<00:04:58.639> that<00:04:58.729> direction

00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:58.880 
you're not going to go in that direction

00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:59.980 
you're not going to go in that direction
I<00:04:59.210> don't<00:04:59.240> understand<00:04:59.690> why<00:04:59.780> you<00:04:59.840> would

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
I don't understand why you would

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:02.890 
I don't understand why you would
introduce<00:05:00.639> that<00:05:01.639> aspect<00:05:02.330> to<00:05:02.479> the<00:05:02.570> film

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:02.900 
introduce that aspect to the film

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.500 
introduce that aspect to the film
anyway<00:05:03.350> the<00:05:04.130> film<00:05:04.340> never<00:05:04.490> really<00:05:04.820> goes<00:05:05.180> in<00:05:05.389> any

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:05.510 
anyway the film never really goes in any

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:07.150 
anyway the film never really goes in any
direction<00:05:05.750> it<00:05:06.080> has<00:05:06.139> a<00:05:06.229> whole<00:05:06.440> bunch<00:05:06.470> of<00:05:06.800> ideas

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 
direction it has a whole bunch of ideas

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.920 
direction it has a whole bunch of ideas
that<00:05:07.340> it<00:05:07.430> kind<00:05:07.610> of<00:05:07.699> touches<00:05:08.120> on<00:05:08.240> but<00:05:08.660> it<00:05:08.780> never

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.930 
that it kind of touches on but it never

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.350 
that it kind of touches on but it never
picks<00:05:09.229> one<00:05:09.500> and<00:05:09.740> really<00:05:10.130> embraces<00:05:10.760> it<00:05:10.940> it's<00:05:11.210> a

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:11.360 
picks one and really embraces it it's a

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:12.909 
picks one and really embraces it it's a
very<00:05:11.479> simple<00:05:11.990> script<00:05:12.199> and<00:05:12.440> I<00:05:12.470> think<00:05:12.680> today's

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:12.919 
very simple script and I think today's

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:15.250 
very simple script and I think today's
audiences<00:05:13.460> expect<00:05:13.850> smarter<00:05:14.570> horror<00:05:14.810> films

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:15.260 
audiences expect smarter horror films

University and I think they could have

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:35.560 
University and I think they could have
done<00:05:34.190> something<00:05:34.400> with<00:05:34.669> that<00:05:34.760> as<00:05:34.940> well<00:05:35.180> you

done something with that as well you

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:37.240 
done something with that as well you
know<00:05:35.660> he's<00:05:35.810> an<00:05:35.930> outcast<00:05:36.139> he<00:05:36.620> said<00:05:37.010> he<00:05:37.130> has<00:05:37.220> a

know he's an outcast he said he has a

know he's an outcast he said he has a
line<00:05:37.490> at<00:05:37.610> the<00:05:37.639> beginning<00:05:38.000> of<00:05:38.120> the<00:05:38.180> film<00:05:38.389> where

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:38.539 
line at the beginning of the film where

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:40.330 
line at the beginning of the film where
he<00:05:38.630> says<00:05:38.810> oh<00:05:38.990> you<00:05:39.289> know<00:05:39.440> I<00:05:39.530> could<00:05:39.949> never<00:05:40.130> get

into this school and later on he goes to

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.810 
into this school and later on he goes to
do<00:05:42.199> some<00:05:42.380> research<00:05:42.800> and<00:05:43.130> I<00:05:43.310> think<00:05:43.520> they<00:05:43.580> kind

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:43.820 
do some research and I think they kind

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:45.279 
do some research and I think they kind
of<00:05:43.880> show<00:05:44.150> that<00:05:44.389> he<00:05:44.660> feels<00:05:44.840> a<00:05:44.930> little<00:05:45.050> out<00:05:45.260> of

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:45.289 
of show that he feels a little out of

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:47.200 
of show that he feels a little out of
his<00:05:45.470> element<00:05:45.770> and<00:05:46.010> I<00:05:46.130> think<00:05:46.340> that's<00:05:46.820> a<00:05:46.910> lot<00:05:47.090> to

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:47.210 
his element and I think that's a lot to

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:48.790 
his element and I think that's a lot to
the<00:05:47.300> credit<00:05:47.570> of<00:05:47.630> sam<00:05:47.810> claflin<00:05:48.080> it's<00:05:48.440> an<00:05:48.500> actor

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:48.800 
the credit of sam claflin it's an actor

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:49.990 
the credit of sam claflin it's an actor
who<00:05:48.919> makes<00:05:49.130> you<00:05:49.250> feel<00:05:49.280> that<00:05:49.669> even<00:05:49.820> though<00:05:49.910> the

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:50.000 
who makes you feel that even though the

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.270 
who makes you feel that even though the
script<00:05:50.330> doesn't<00:05:50.510> really<00:05:50.750> introduce<00:05:51.169> that<00:05:51.440> and

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:52.280 
script doesn't really introduce that and

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.200 
script doesn't really introduce that and
I<00:05:52.310> think<00:05:52.370> that<00:05:52.639> could<00:05:52.789> have<00:05:52.880> been<00:05:53.000> played<00:05:53.180> with

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:53.210 
I think that could have been played with

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:54.400 
I think that could have been played with
his<00:05:53.479> well<00:05:53.630> kind<00:05:53.870> of<00:05:53.930> almost<00:05:54.050> like<00:05:54.289> an

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:54.410 
his well kind of almost like an

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:57.129 
his well kind of almost like an
educational<00:05:55.190> class<00:05:55.400> system<00:05:55.880> but<00:05:56.720> anyway<00:05:56.960> he's

00:05:57.129 --> 00:05:57.139 
educational class system but anyway he's

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:00.640 
educational class system but anyway he's
a<00:05:57.169> navy<00:05:57.650> suit<00:05:57.889> a<00:05:58.070> navy<00:05:58.900> assistant<00:05:59.900> who<00:06:00.110> helps

out<00:06:00.800> this<00:06:01.010> experiment<00:06:01.370> and<00:06:01.970> I<00:06:02.060> saw<00:06:02.240> no<00:06:02.419> reason

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:02.450 
out this experiment and I saw no reason

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:03.909 
out this experiment and I saw no reason
for<00:06:02.870> him<00:06:02.960> to<00:06:03.020> be<00:06:03.110> there<00:06:03.320> filming<00:06:03.590> things

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:03.919 
for him to be there filming things

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:05.350 
for him to be there filming things
because<00:06:04.190> they<00:06:04.280> never<00:06:04.430> really<00:06:04.520> utilized<00:06:05.180> that

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:05.360 
because they never really utilized that

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.150 
because they never really utilized that
he<00:06:05.510> never<00:06:05.630> was<00:06:06.169> I<00:06:06.200> mean<00:06:06.650> he<00:06:06.770> would<00:06:06.889> sometimes

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:07.160 
he never was I mean he would sometimes

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.560 
he never was I mean he would sometimes
review<00:06:07.639> the<00:06:07.760> footage<00:06:07.940> but<00:06:08.210> he<00:06:08.300> didn't<00:06:08.450> really

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:08.570 
review the footage but he didn't really

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:10.390 
review the footage but he didn't really
discover<00:06:09.260> anything<00:06:09.500> we<00:06:09.740> didn't<00:06:09.979> see<00:06:10.130> while<00:06:10.280> he

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:10.400 
discover anything we didn't see while he

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.370 
discover anything we didn't see while he
was<00:06:10.520> filming<00:06:10.760> and<00:06:11.630> sometimes<00:06:12.050> there<00:06:12.289> were

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:12.380 
was filming and sometimes there were

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:13.839 
was filming and sometimes there were
things<00:06:12.590> would<00:06:12.740> be<00:06:12.830> happening<00:06:13.039> on<00:06:13.430> that<00:06:13.729> he

00:06:13.839 --> 00:06:13.849 
things would be happening on that he

00:06:13.849 --> 00:06:15.250 
things would be happening on that he
filmed<00:06:14.240> and<00:06:14.389> that<00:06:14.479> he<00:06:14.570> wasn't<00:06:14.750> aware<00:06:14.930> of<00:06:15.080> that

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:15.260 
filmed and that he wasn't aware of that

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:16.629 
filmed and that he wasn't aware of that
he<00:06:15.440> never<00:06:15.590> apparently<00:06:16.160> went<00:06:16.310> back<00:06:16.490> and

00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:16.639 
he never apparently went back and

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:18.339 
he never apparently went back and
reviewed<00:06:17.000> he's<00:06:17.750> like<00:06:17.870> I<00:06:17.930> really<00:06:18.020> should<00:06:18.320> have

00:06:18.339 --> 00:06:18.349 
reviewed he's like I really should have

00:06:18.349 --> 00:06:19.659 
reviewed he's like I really should have
been<00:06:18.500> checking<00:06:18.830> this<00:06:18.889> footage<00:06:19.220> every<00:06:19.490> day<00:06:19.639> I

00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:19.669 
been checking this footage every day I

00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:22.210 
been checking this footage every day I
guess<00:06:20.060> so<00:06:21.020> I<00:06:21.260> think<00:06:21.440> the<00:06:21.680> only<00:06:21.710> reason<00:06:22.190> that

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:22.220 
guess so I think the only reason that

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:23.379 
guess so I think the only reason that
element<00:06:22.639> was<00:06:22.760> there<00:06:22.940> is<00:06:23.090> to<00:06:23.150> try<00:06:23.270> and

00:06:23.379 --> 00:06:23.389 
element was there is to try and

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:25.000 
element was there is to try and
capitalize<00:06:23.960> on<00:06:23.990> the<00:06:24.229> trend<00:06:24.530> the<00:06:24.710> current

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:25.010 
capitalize on the trend the current

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:27.040 
capitalize on the trend the current
trend<00:06:25.280> to<00:06:25.400> found<00:06:25.669> footage<00:06:26.000> but<00:06:26.720> I<00:06:26.810> think<00:06:26.990> the

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:27.050 
trend to found footage but I think the

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:28.779 
trend to found footage but I think the
movie<00:06:27.260> would<00:06:27.410> have<00:06:27.440> been<00:06:27.530> better<00:06:28.250> without<00:06:28.460> it

00:06:28.779 --> 00:06:28.789 
movie would have been better without it

00:06:28.789 --> 00:06:30.400 
movie would have been better without it
to<00:06:28.880> having<00:06:29.030> to<00:06:29.210> remove<00:06:29.539> that<00:06:29.810> aspect<00:06:30.229> and

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:30.410 
to having to remove that aspect and

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:31.300 
to having to remove that aspect and
maybe<00:06:30.590> he<00:06:30.740> could<00:06:30.860> have<00:06:30.949> just<00:06:31.130> been<00:06:31.190> an

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:31.310 
maybe he could have just been an

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:34.390 
maybe he could have just been an
assistant<00:06:31.789> to<00:06:31.880> Jared<00:06:32.180> Harris<00:06:32.740> also<00:06:33.740> yeah<00:06:33.889> as<00:06:34.280> I

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:34.400 
assistant to Jared Harris also yeah as I

at least it's the first time I've seen
it<00:06:59.240> and<00:06:59.540> it'd<00:06:59.780> take<00:06:59.990> a<00:07:00.110> borrows<00:07:00.470> a<00:07:00.530> little<00:07:00.680> bit

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:00.830 
it and it'd take a borrows a little bit

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:03.190 
it and it'd take a borrows a little bit
from<00:07:00.980> Marvel<00:07:01.970> Studios<00:07:02.300> logo<00:07:02.600> but<00:07:02.930> it<00:07:03.020> shows

some stills from horror comics and old
horror<00:07:05.210> movies<00:07:05.330> and<00:07:05.990> it<00:07:06.200> really<00:07:06.320> did<00:07:06.530> great

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:06.740 
horror movies and it really did great

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:09.220 
horror movies and it really did great
job<00:07:06.919> of<00:07:07.010> putting<00:07:07.220> you<00:07:07.430> in<00:07:07.580> the<00:07:07.700> mood<00:07:07.960> and<00:07:08.960> it's

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:09.230 
job of putting you in the mood and it's

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:11.110 
job of putting you in the mood and it's
just<00:07:09.410> too<00:07:09.590> bad<00:07:09.740> that<00:07:09.980> this<00:07:10.070> film<00:07:10.310> just<00:07:10.850> didn't

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:11.120 
just too bad that this film just didn't

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:13.659 
just too bad that this film just didn't
quite<00:07:11.480> deliver<00:07:11.990> ah<00:07:12.290> just<00:07:13.100> like<00:07:13.250> I<00:07:13.340> think<00:07:13.400> that

00:07:13.659 --> 00:07:13.669 
quite deliver ah just like I think that

00:07:13.669 --> 00:07:15.190 
quite deliver ah just like I think that
their<00:07:14.060> experiment<00:07:14.690> should<00:07:14.840> get<00:07:15.020> like<00:07:15.169> a

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:15.200 
their experiment should get like a

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.900 
their experiment should get like a
c-minus<00:07:15.919> I<00:07:16.100> think<00:07:16.280> the<00:07:16.370> film<00:07:16.550> should<00:07:16.760> get

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:16.910 
c-minus I think the film should get

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:18.340 
c-minus I think the film should get
around<00:07:17.150> there<00:07:17.360> too<00:07:17.570> not<00:07:17.780> enough<00:07:18.110> though

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:18.350 
around there too not enough though

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:19.840 
around there too not enough though
because<00:07:18.800> again<00:07:19.160> I<00:07:19.190> think<00:07:19.310> the<00:07:19.520> work<00:07:19.639> from

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:19.850 
because again I think the work from

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:21.730 
because again I think the work from
Claflin<00:07:20.570> and<00:07:20.720> Harris<00:07:20.930> is<00:07:21.110> quite<00:07:21.320> good<00:07:21.530> and<00:07:21.650> the

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:21.740 
Claflin and Harris is quite good and the

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:22.900 
Claflin and Harris is quite good and the
directing<00:07:22.130> is<00:07:22.220> gonna<00:07:22.370> that<00:07:22.520> the<00:07:22.610> real<00:07:22.760> problem

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:22.910 
directing is gonna that the real problem

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:25.600 
directing is gonna that the real problem
is<00:07:23.720> just<00:07:23.960> the<00:07:24.139> script<00:07:24.470> I<00:07:24.800> think<00:07:25.280> the<00:07:25.340> script

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:25.610 
is just the script I think the script

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:27.490 
is just the script I think the script
just<00:07:25.730> doesn't<00:07:26.120> go<00:07:26.510> far<00:07:27.200> enough

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:27.500 
just doesn't go far enough

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:29.740 
just doesn't go far enough
in<00:07:28.040> any<00:07:28.280> in<00:07:28.550> any<00:07:28.669> direction<00:07:29.060> and<00:07:29.270> I<00:07:29.360> had<00:07:29.720> a

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:29.750 
in any in any direction and I had a

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:32.080 
in any in any direction and I had a
problem<00:07:30.260> with<00:07:30.440> her<00:07:30.500> a<00:07:30.530> recent<00:07:31.040> phone<00:07:31.220> for<00:07:32.000> the

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:32.090 
problem with her a recent phone for the

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:34.300 
problem with her a recent phone for the
same<00:07:32.300> for<00:07:32.750> the<00:07:32.810> same<00:07:32.960> reasons<00:07:33.410> it's<00:07:33.620> it's<00:07:33.860> it's

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:34.310 
same for the same reasons it's it's it's

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:36.670 
same for the same reasons it's it's it's
unfortunate<00:07:34.490> that<00:07:34.940> they<00:07:35.260> Hollywood<00:07:36.260> you<00:07:36.560> know
