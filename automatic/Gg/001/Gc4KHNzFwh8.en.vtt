00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
feature is removed from the sl1

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.850 
feature is removed from the sl1
so<00:01:27.570> I<00:01:27.600> think<00:01:27.720> I've<00:01:28.020> already<00:01:28.290> you<00:01:28.619> know<00:01:28.740> I've

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
so I think I've already you know I've

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.950 
so I think I've already you know I've
just<00:01:29.009> had<00:01:29.159> this<00:01:29.310> in<00:01:29.460> my<00:01:29.610> hands<00:01:29.939> for<00:01:30.000> just<00:01:30.570> a<00:01:30.659> few

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
just had this in my hands for just a few

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.569 
just had this in my hands for just a few
hours<00:01:31.110> so<00:01:31.439> this<00:01:31.560> is<00:01:31.650> really<00:01:31.950> just<00:01:31.979> some<00:01:32.250> early

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
hours so this is really just some early

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:33.980 
hours so this is really just some early
thoughts<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.150> things<00:01:33.570> that<00:01:33.689> I've<00:01:33.869> discovered

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
thoughts and things that I've discovered

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.640 
thoughts and things that I've discovered
I'm<00:01:34.530> pretty<00:01:34.979> sure<00:01:35.100> sl1<00:01:35.939> stands<00:01:36.450> for<00:01:36.869> sneaky

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
I'm pretty sure sl1 stands for sneaky

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.420 
I'm pretty sure sl1 stands for sneaky
little<00:01:38.009> one<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:38.810> for<00:01:39.810> two<00:01:39.930> reasons<00:01:40.350> one<00:01:40.860> it

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
little one and for two reasons one it

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.039 
little one and for two reasons one it
has<00:01:41.670> a<00:01:41.700> silent<00:01:42.420> mode

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
has a silent mode

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.469 
has a silent mode
let's<00:01:43.409> listen<00:01:43.619> to<00:01:43.770> that<00:01:44.040> for<00:01:44.250> a<00:01:44.280> second<00:01:44.790> the

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
let's listen to that for a second the

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:51.260 
let's listen to that for a second the
silent<00:01:45.899> shutter<00:01:49.130> it's<00:01:50.130> pretty<00:01:50.369> quiet<00:01:50.610> let's

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
silent shutter it's pretty quiet let's

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:58.940 
silent shutter it's pretty quiet let's
listen<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:51.899> it<00:01:51.930> not<00:01:52.350> silent<00:01:52.979> now<00:01:57.350> and<00:01:58.350> just<00:01:58.799> to

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
listen to it not silent now and just to

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.340 
listen to it not silent now and just to
compare<00:01:59.250> real<00:01:59.460> quick<00:01:59.670> here's<00:01:59.909> what<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.350> t5i

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
compare real quick here's what the t5i

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.080 
compare real quick here's what the t5i
sounds<00:02:01.920> like<00:02:02.100> when<00:02:02.310> you're<00:02:02.430> taking<00:02:02.759> pictures

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
sounds like when you're taking pictures

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.490 
sounds like when you're taking pictures
a<00:02:04.790> pretty<00:02:05.790> significant<00:02:06.420> difference<00:02:06.570> so

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
a pretty significant difference so

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.010 
a pretty significant difference so
another<00:02:08.099> reason<00:02:08.340> why<00:02:08.610> this<00:02:08.670> camera<00:02:09.390> is<00:02:09.569> on<00:02:09.869> the

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
another reason why this camera is on the

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.540 
another reason why this camera is on the
sneaky<00:02:10.349> side<00:02:10.560> is<00:02:10.739> it<00:02:10.890> has<00:02:11.009> a<00:02:11.039> couple<00:02:11.310> of

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
sneaky side is it has a couple of

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.040 
sneaky side is it has a couple of
features<00:02:11.610> that<00:02:12.060> I<00:02:12.330> am

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
features that I am

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.410 
features that I am
or<00:02:13.290> seen<00:02:13.560> anybody<00:02:14.010> talked<00:02:14.250> about<00:02:14.520> yet<00:02:14.790> and<00:02:14.970> are

or seen anybody talked about yet and are

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
t5i which t4i i understand you know

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:21.920 
t5i which t4i i understand you know
that's<00:02:20.610> an<00:02:20.700> older<00:02:20.970> camera<00:02:21.300> came<00:02:21.570> out<00:02:21.720> a<00:02:21.750> year

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
that's an older camera came out a year

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.050 
that's an older camera came out a year
ago<00:02:21.990> but<00:02:22.230> the<00:02:22.320> t5<00:02:22.650> I<00:02:22.680> just<00:02:23.250> came<00:02:23.430> out<00:02:23.670> in<00:02:23.850> fact

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
ago but the t5 I just came out in fact

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.450 
ago but the t5 I just came out in fact
just<00:02:24.390> before<00:02:24.720> that<00:02:24.900> so<00:02:25.110> one<00:02:25.320> and<00:02:25.530> I'm<00:02:26.250> just

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
just before that so one and I'm just

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:27.830 
just before that so one and I'm just
kind<00:02:26.670> of<00:02:26.730> surprised<00:02:27.330> that<00:02:27.510> they<00:02:27.600> didn't

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
kind of surprised that they didn't

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.510 
kind of surprised that they didn't
include<00:02:27.930> these<00:02:28.290> features<00:02:28.650> one<00:02:28.950> of<00:02:28.980> which<00:02:29.220> I

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
include these features one of which I

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.760 
include these features one of which I
wish<00:02:30.330> they<00:02:30.510> had<00:02:30.690> because<00:02:30.930> it's<00:02:31.080> a<00:02:31.140> fun<00:02:31.350> feature

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
wish they had because it's a fun feature

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.950 
wish they had because it's a fun feature
but<00:02:32.160> that's<00:02:32.340> alright<00:02:32.550> so<00:02:33.480> they<00:02:34.050> are<00:02:35.720> kids<00:02:36.720> and

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
but that's alright so they are kids and

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.160 
but that's alright so they are kids and
food<00:02:37.440> scene<00:02:38.310> mode<00:02:38.670> so<00:02:39.090> you<00:02:39.150> have<00:02:39.420> seen<00:02:39.750> on<00:02:40.020> the

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
food scene mode so you have seen on the

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.260 
food scene mode so you have seen on the
dial<00:02:40.410> and<00:02:40.560> the<00:02:40.710> dial<00:02:40.920> rotates<00:02:41.340> 360<00:02:41.640> like<00:02:42.120> the

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
dial and the dial rotates 360 like the

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.930 
dial and the dial rotates 360 like the
t5i<00:02:42.660> and<00:02:43.110> it<00:02:43.200> feels<00:02:43.410> very<00:02:43.530> similar<00:02:44.130> except<00:02:44.430> it

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
t5i and it feels very similar except it

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.610 
t5i and it feels very similar except it
doesn't<00:02:45.150> have<00:02:45.270> the<00:02:45.510> raised<00:02:45.810> bumps<00:02:46.350> it's<00:02:46.500> not

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
doesn't have the raised bumps it's not

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.560 
doesn't have the raised bumps it's not
the<00:02:46.800> exact<00:02:47.190> same<00:02:47.310> dial<00:02:47.760> not<00:02:48.270> that<00:02:48.420> that<00:02:48.510> really

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
the exact same dial not that that really

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.260 
the exact same dial not that that really
matters<00:02:49.170> but<00:02:49.620> now<00:02:49.800> on<00:02:50.100> the<00:02:50.430> scene<00:02:50.700> mode<00:02:50.940> you

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
matters but now on the scene mode you

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:56.120 
matters but now on the scene mode you
have<00:02:51.570> kids<00:02:52.440> food<00:02:53.990> candlelight<00:02:54.990> and<00:02:55.260> then

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
have kids food candlelight and then

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.500 
have kids food candlelight and then

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
actually that's three isn't it because

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.240 
actually that's three isn't it because
candlelight<00:02:58.020> isn't<00:02:58.320> present<00:02:58.560> in<00:02:58.620> the<00:02:58.710> t5i

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
candlelight isn't present in the t5i

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.520 
candlelight isn't present in the t5i
then<00:02:59.640> you<00:02:59.760> have<00:02:59.880> night<00:03:00.120> portrait<00:03:00.600> hand-held
