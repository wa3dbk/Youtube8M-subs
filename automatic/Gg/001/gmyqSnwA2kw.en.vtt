spawns flip and i have to rush over in

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.780 
spawns flip and i have to rush over in
that<00:00:36.840> area<00:00:36.899> and<00:00:37.350> i<00:00:37.710> won't<00:00:37.890> be<00:00:37.980> too<00:00:38.340> surprised

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
that area and i won't be too surprised

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.069 
that area and i won't be too surprised
even<00:00:39.149> though<00:00:39.239> they<00:00:39.360> look<00:00:39.540> like<00:00:39.660> there<00:00:39.780> was<00:00:39.840> two

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
even though they look like there was two

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.840 
even though they look like there was two
or<00:00:40.200> three<00:00:40.350> tiers<00:00:40.680> in<00:00:40.800> that<00:00:41.010> building<00:00:41.370> so<00:00:41.820> i

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
or three tiers in that building so i

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.470 
or three tiers in that building so i
think<00:00:42.809> i<00:00:43.110> would<00:00:43.290> definitely<00:00:44.000> avoid<00:00:45.000> going<00:00:45.210> in

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
think i would definitely avoid going in

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.110 
think i would definitely avoid going in
that<00:00:45.600> building<00:00:45.989> so<00:00:46.500> as<00:00:47.340> your<00:00:47.520> eyeballs<00:00:47.879> are

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
that building so as your eyeballs are

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.220 
that building so as your eyeballs are
telling<00:00:48.510> you<00:00:48.600> where<00:00:48.719> as<00:00:48.809> what<00:00:48.960> i<00:00:48.989> just<00:00:49.079> told

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
that run around in here I thought cod4

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.990

was<00:01:17.850> infested<00:01:18.750> with<00:01:18.960> new<00:01:19.530> tubers<00:01:19.920> in<00:01:20.670> which<00:01:20.850> it

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
was infested with new tubers in which it

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.420 
was infested with new tubers in which it
is<00:01:21.030> you<00:01:21.360> know<00:01:21.509> but<00:01:21.990> modern<00:01:22.470> warfare<00:01:22.619> 2<00:01:22.979> can
