this case to the tale of y2 so this

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.210 
this case to the tale of y2 so this
connection<00:02:32.970> is<00:02:33.330> not<00:02:33.930> this<00:02:34.170> one<00:02:34.470> let's<00:02:35.040> try

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
connection is not this one let's try

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.750 
connection is not this one let's try
again<00:02:35.550> the<00:02:36.120> tip<00:02:36.420> of<00:02:36.630> x2<00:02:37.080> is<00:02:37.500> connected<00:02:38.400> to<00:02:38.430> the

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
again the tip of x2 is connected to the

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.800 
again the tip of x2 is connected to the
tale<00:02:39.060> of<00:02:39.300> z2<00:02:39.950> this<00:02:40.950> is<00:02:41.160> a<00:02:41.190> connection<00:02:41.880> so<00:02:42.540> this

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
tale of z2 this is a connection so this

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.949 
tale of z2 this is a connection so this
is<00:02:43.020> the<00:02:43.170> primary<00:02:43.440> and<00:02:44.130> this<00:02:45.030> is<00:02:45.209> the<00:02:45.360> secondary

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
is the primary and this is the secondary

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:51.250 
is the primary and this is the secondary
now<00:02:47.120> where<00:02:48.120> is<00:02:48.440> face<00:02:49.440> a<00:02:49.739> of<00:02:50.190> the<00:02:50.520> secondary

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
now where is face a of the secondary

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.220 
now where is face a of the secondary
observe<00:02:52.260> at<00:02:52.500> the<00:02:53.040> tip<00:02:53.310> of<00:02:53.459> x2<00:02:53.970> at<00:02:54.239> the<00:02:54.840> tip<00:02:55.080> of

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
observe at the tip of x2 at the tip of

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.850 
observe at the tip of x2 at the tip of
x2<00:02:55.620> so<00:02:56.190> this<00:02:56.430> is<00:02:56.670> phase<00:02:56.940> a<00:02:57.300> of<00:02:57.780> the<00:02:58.260> secondary

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
x2 so this is phase a of the secondary

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.750 
x2 so this is phase a of the secondary
and<00:02:59.190> this<00:02:59.760> has<00:03:00.030> to<00:03:00.209> be<00:03:00.239> phase<00:03:01.200> B<00:03:01.560> and<00:03:01.769> phase<00:03:02.430> C

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
and this has to be phase B and phase C

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.300 
and this has to be phase B and phase C
of<00:03:02.910> the<00:03:03.060> secondary<00:03:03.750> and<00:03:04.319> they<00:03:04.470> comply<00:03:04.920> why<00:03:05.250> to

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
of the secondary and they comply why to

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.979 
of the secondary and they comply why to
tip<00:03:05.850> why<00:03:06.660> to<00:03:06.720> tip<00:03:07.110> is<00:03:07.290> way<00:03:07.500> to<00:03:07.640> Z<00:03:08.640> to<00:03:08.910> tip<00:03:09.180> is<00:03:09.450> Z

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
tip why to tip is way to Z to tip is Z

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:13.880 
tip why to tip is way to Z to tip is Z
to<00:03:10.819> immediately<00:03:11.819> we<00:03:12.269> realize<00:03:12.810> this<00:03:13.470> is<00:03:13.650> not<00:03:13.830> a

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
to immediately we realize this is not a

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.199 
to immediately we realize this is not a
standard<00:03:14.569> convention<00:03:15.569> so<00:03:15.900> this<00:03:16.170> is<00:03:16.440> a<00:03:16.940> yd1

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
standard convention so this is a yd1

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.559 
standard convention so this is a yd1
hmm<00:03:18.930> that<00:03:19.410> is<00:03:19.440> not<00:03:19.739> compliant<00:03:20.280> anymore<00:03:21.000> so

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:21.569 
hmm that is not compliant anymore so

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:24.229 
hmm that is not compliant anymore so
without<00:03:22.049> doing<00:03:22.350> anything<00:03:23.130> to<00:03:23.580> the<00:03:23.700> connection

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
without doing anything to the connection

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.870 
without doing anything to the connection
proper<00:03:24.780> just<00:03:25.230> by<00:03:25.440> relabeling<00:03:26.220> them<00:03:26.580> and

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
proper just by relabeling them and

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.229 
proper just by relabeling them and
saying<00:03:27.540> this<00:03:28.019> is<00:03:28.319> going<00:03:28.560> to<00:03:28.860> be<00:03:29.040> base<00:03:29.580> a<00:03:29.880> of<00:03:30.060> the

saying this is going to be base a of the

saying this is going to be base a of the

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
Phase II of the secondary we have with

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.120 
Phase II of the secondary we have with
the<00:03:37.680> same<00:03:38.040> wiring<00:03:38.459> a<00:03:38.900> compliant<00:03:40.130> connection

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
the same wiring a compliant connection

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:47.090 
the same wiring a compliant connection
which<00:03:41.700> is<00:03:41.730> y<00:03:42.799> d5<00:03:44.060> y<00:03:45.060> t5<00:03:45.590> just<00:03:46.590> by<00:03:46.739> doing<00:03:46.799> that

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
which is y d5 y t5 just by doing that

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.180 
which is y d5 y t5 just by doing that
just<00:03:47.940> relabeling<00:03:48.630> let's<00:03:49.320> do<00:03:49.500> the<00:03:49.680> relabeling

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
just relabeling let's do the relabeling

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.030 
just relabeling let's do the relabeling
in<00:03:50.370> here<00:03:50.700> so<00:03:51.120> this<00:03:51.359> would<00:03:51.630> be<00:03:51.810> instead<00:03:52.380> of<00:03:52.440> B<00:03:52.769> 2

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
in here so this would be instead of B 2

00:03:53.040 --> 00:04:00.550 
in here so this would be instead of B 2
would<00:03:53.640> be<00:03:53.670> a<00:03:53.970> 2<00:03:54.090> C<00:03:55.019> 2<00:03:55.579> would<00:03:56.579> be<00:03:56.840> B<00:03:57.840> 2<00:03:58.140> and<00:03:59.120> a<00:04:00.120> 2

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
would be a 2 C 2 would be B 2 and a 2

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:06.349 
would be a 2 C 2 would be B 2 and a 2
would<00:04:01.560> be<00:04:01.590> C<00:04:02.040> 2<00:04:02.450> just<00:04:03.450> buy<00:04:03.630> that<00:04:03.870> relabeling<00:04:05.359> we

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:06.359 
would be C 2 just buy that relabeling we

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:09.620 
would be C 2 just buy that relabeling we

00:07:24.659 --> 00:07:24.669 
of this transformer this value was

00:07:24.669 --> 00:07:26.909 
of this transformer this value was
measured<00:07:25.060> from<00:07:25.210> the<00:07:25.389> high<00:07:25.600> voltage<00:07:26.080> side<00:07:26.320> so

00:07:26.909 --> 00:07:26.919 
measured from the high voltage side so

00:07:26.919 --> 00:07:32.520 
measured from the high voltage side so
we<00:07:27.100> use<00:07:27.370> this<00:07:27.970> voltage<00:07:28.960> on<00:07:29.139> the<00:07:29.229> high<00:07:29.380> side<00:07:31.530> 0.1

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:32.530 
we use this voltage on the high side 0.1

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:35.520 
we use this voltage on the high side 0.1
