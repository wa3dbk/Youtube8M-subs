00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.860

 We're really worried. 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.360
 because the puppies never had 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:09.130
 contact with any child and they 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.540
 They are the only right 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.240

 happen and worried, huh? 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.880

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.570
 so does my family like the baby 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.240
 it will also be in fact you are a 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.490

 good for animals how much good for us 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.729
 child who is watching there we invite 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:40.810
 a dog trainer to get to know the 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:42.970
 sugar house 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.009
 it is important to stimulate the 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.610
 puppies so that they receive the 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:48.039
 drink 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.440
 all have some sort of obligation 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:52.869
 this animal is simply to discard it 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:56.410
 because the baby arrived and yes and there are rules 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:58.810
 that the dog understands is not excluding him and 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:01.300
 yes showing him that when the baby 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.940
 his life will come, he will continue to be 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.020
 same thing but not that one for example 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.140
 I said earlier 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.310
 that life of leadership dominance I 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.290
 I usually work a lot of dogs 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.410
 Baby Strollers on Baby Stroller 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.690
 then the little dog he associates the ride 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.069
 to the baby 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.770
 now I 'm not going to leave with a dog 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:22.710
 who never went outside and never went 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.330
 Put it on the baby 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:27.600
 and he has to learn first 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.760
 walk on the street and in which controlled 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.160
 Maria Cristina also gives valuable tips 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.570
 how to behave at the moment of 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.790
 arrival of the child 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:38.460
 I always suggest to my clients that 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.960
 they are when that is how baby is born and 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.990
 there is this possibility 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.100
 they take a little cloth a blanket 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:46.530
 something that might happen in the 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.110
 Baby's body is the one that catches the smell 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.900
 baby or a little outfit that he is 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.970
 bring someone home from the 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.250
 family bring home and put 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.020
 under the food pot and the water of the 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.450
 puppy this dog is already 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:03.300
 getting used to the car smell 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:06.330
 You 're not making a nest. 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:09.600
 positive association with the presence of 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.860
 baby smell the second tip is 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.860
 never enter 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:16.170
 mother with baby on her lap as she is 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:19.170
 absent the dogs will seek attention 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.820
 of her, and if she is busy she does not 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.290
 will pay attention to the dog deliver 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.960
 the baby for grandma 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.970
 her to come and do it and do what 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:29.250
 She always did with her dogs, right? 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.950
 those do not feel that's the shock 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.870
 impact that she is with something new and that 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.890
 she will not listen to her all 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.680
 life to them 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:40.110
 I let the foot praise until I associate 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.330
 compete Quinho something positive 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:44.730
 but the dog has to be smelling so 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:48.210
 very submissive quiet showing that 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:52.320
 is happy ever force the animal there is nothing 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:55.200
 if the dog showed no interest in the 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:58.070
 Do not take the dog and do the 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.060
 dog smell the handle and mail and go 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:02.100
 cornering the animal until it arrives 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.960
 because then you will create a 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:07.650
 immediate terrorism between the animal 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.650
 and I drink 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:26.150
 the world pet the royal offer the carnÃ© 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.530

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.240

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.910
 pet at home we love these 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.920
 little pets, and when is the woman coming? 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:36.710
 being pregnant you will get a new one 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:38.630
 baby at home can generate jealousy box 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:43.030
