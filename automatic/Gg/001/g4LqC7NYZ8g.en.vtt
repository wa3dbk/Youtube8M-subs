what<00:03:09.920> I<00:03:09.950> do<00:03:10.100> when<00:03:10.610> I<00:03:10.640> put<00:03:10.940> it<00:03:11.030> in<00:03:11.120> the<00:03:11.210> oven<00:03:11.300> is<00:03:11.540> I

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
what I do when I put it in the oven is I

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.590 
what I do when I put it in the oven is I
just<00:03:11.720> set<00:03:12.080> a<00:03:12.110> timer<00:03:12.440> for<00:03:12.590> an<00:03:12.860> hour<00:03:13.270> which<00:03:14.270> it

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
just set a timer for an hour which it

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.330 
just set a timer for an hour which it
usually<00:03:14.960> takes<00:03:15.230> slightly<00:03:15.710> shorter<00:03:16.130> an<00:03:16.220> hour

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
usually takes slightly shorter an hour

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:17.980 
usually takes slightly shorter an hour
but<00:03:16.610> I<00:03:16.700> won't<00:03:16.880> forget<00:03:17.240> it's<00:03:17.420> in<00:03:17.570> there

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:17.990 
but I won't forget it's in there

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:21.340 
but I won't forget it's in there
