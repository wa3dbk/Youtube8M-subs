and<00:00:31.230> create<00:00:32.230> some<00:00:32.380> snow<00:00:32.680> effects<00:00:33.070> on<00:00:33.280> the

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:33.430 
and create some snow effects on the

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.479 
and create some snow effects on the
trees<00:00:34.050> so<00:00:35.050> anyways<00:00:35.500> to<00:00:35.770> get<00:00:35.890> started<00:00:36.370> we're

00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:36.489 
trees so anyways to get started we're

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:38.040 
trees so anyways to get started we're
going<00:00:36.579> to<00:00:36.640> lay<00:00:36.850> down<00:00:36.880> a<00:00:37.030> nice<00:00:37.300> wash<00:00:37.629> for<00:00:37.960> the

going to lay down a nice wash for the
sky<00:00:38.969> and<00:00:39.969> what<00:00:40.090> I'm<00:00:40.210> going<00:00:40.329> to<00:00:40.390> do<00:00:40.570> is<00:00:42.269> wet<00:00:43.269> the

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:43.420 
sky and what I'm going to do is wet the

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:51.569 
sky and what I'm going to do is wet the
paper<00:00:44.789> just<00:00:45.789> with<00:00:46.000> some<00:00:46.180> water<00:00:50.399> I'm<00:00:51.399> gonna

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:51.579 
paper just with some water I'm gonna

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:57.110 
paper just with some water I'm gonna
start<00:00:51.850> with<00:00:52.030> some<00:00:52.090> ultramarine<00:00:52.899> blue<00:00:52.929> and

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.369 

then<00:00:58.120> make<00:00:58.480> it<00:00:58.570> always<00:00:58.750> make<00:00:59.019> the<00:00:59.109> sky<00:00:59.350> a

00:00:59.369 --> 00:00:59.379 
then make it always make the sky a

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:01.169 
then make it always make the sky a
little<00:00:59.559> bit<00:00:59.769> darker<00:01:00.250> at<00:01:00.370> the<00:01:00.399> top<00:01:00.519> so<00:01:00.910> I<00:01:00.940> have<00:01:01.120> a

00:01:01.169 --> 00:01:01.179 
little bit darker at the top so I have a

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:04.500 
little bit darker at the top so I have a
little<00:01:01.300> bit<00:01:01.480> of<00:01:01.510> dye<00:01:01.780> accessing<00:01:02.260> purple<00:01:03.510> to

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:04.510 
little bit of dye accessing purple to

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:10.440 
little bit of dye accessing purple to
that<00:01:05.910> back<00:01:06.910> in<00:01:07.060> with<00:01:07.210> the<00:01:07.300> blue<00:01:07.570> and<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:10.090> little

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
that back in with the blue and a little

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.539 
that back in with the blue and a little
bit<00:01:10.540> of<00:01:10.630> water<00:01:10.840> I<00:01:11.970> get<00:01:12.970> a<00:01:13.000> little<00:01:13.390> bit<00:01:14.549> softer

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:15.549 
bit of water I get a little bit softer

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:21.630 
bit of water I get a little bit softer
down<00:01:15.729> at<00:01:15.909> the<00:01:16.090> end<00:01:16.270> here

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:27.190 

that<00:01:22.640> is<00:01:22.760> harsh<00:01:23.350> okay

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.230 

then<00:01:28.570> I'm<00:01:29.570> going<00:01:29.719> to<00:01:29.750> put<00:01:29.960> in<00:01:30.110> a<00:01:31.030> little<00:01:32.030> bit<00:01:32.210> of

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
then I'm going to put in a little bit of

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.880 
then I'm going to put in a little bit of
mountains<00:01:32.719> even<00:01:33.170> though<00:01:33.439> it's<00:01:33.560> a<00:01:33.590> little<00:01:33.770> bit

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
mountains even though it's a little bit

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.490 
mountains even though it's a little bit
wet<00:01:34.039> it'll<00:01:34.219> kind<00:01:34.610> of<00:01:34.780> give<00:01:35.780> the<00:01:35.929> effect<00:01:36.350> of

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
wet it'll kind of give the effect of

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:47.550 
wet it'll kind of give the effect of
some<00:01:36.710> mountains<00:01:37.100> in<00:01:37.219> the<00:01:37.250> sky<00:01:37.610> there

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:56.219 

and<00:01:48.070> off<00:01:48.310> in<00:01:48.520> the<00:01:48.640> distance<00:01:48.820> there

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:02.340 

over<00:01:56.950> here<00:01:57.219> basically

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
some winter blue ones are green and some

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:14.270 
some winter blue ones are green and some
quinacridone<00:03:12.020> start<00:03:13.020> off<00:03:13.200> by<00:03:13.440> making<00:03:13.620> a<00:03:13.920> tree

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
quinacridone start off by making a tree

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:23.300 
quinacridone start off by making a tree
over<00:03:14.640> here

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.970 

there's<00:03:23.880> a<00:03:24.000> little<00:03:24.240> tree

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
there's a little tree

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:32.010 
there's a little tree
I'll<00:03:26.310> make<00:03:26.490> a<00:03:26.520> big<00:03:26.730> one<00:03:26.790> over<00:03:27.150> here

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:32.020 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.470 

like<00:03:32.200> that<00:03:32.440> you<00:03:33.280> just<00:03:33.430> use<00:03:33.580> the<00:03:33.730> texture<00:03:34.120> of

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
like that you just use the texture of

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.960 
like that you just use the texture of
that<00:03:34.510> sponge<00:03:35.520> to<00:03:36.520> make<00:03:36.700> the<00:03:36.850> tree<00:03:38.730> and<00:03:39.730> we're

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
that sponge to make the tree and we're
