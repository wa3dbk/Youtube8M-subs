to apartment for long-term use for

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.500 
to apartment for long-term use for
someone<00:00:45.030> of<00:00:45.210> my<00:00:45.239> size<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:45.930> weight<00:00:46.309> but

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
someone of my size and weight but

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.389 
someone of my size and weight but
certainly<00:00:48.510> for<00:00:49.379> last<00:00:49.829> few<00:00:50.010> days<00:00:50.160> has<00:00:50.370> been

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
certainly for last few days has been

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.880 
certainly for last few days has been
really<00:00:50.910> really<00:00:51.059> good<00:00:51.300> so<00:00:52.110> if<00:00:52.170> we<00:00:52.260> think<00:00:52.440> closer

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
really really good so if we think closer

00:00:52.890 --> 00:01:00.740 
really really good so if we think closer
look<00:00:53.250> at<00:00:53.460> its<00:00:56.539> we<00:00:57.539> can<00:00:57.719> see<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.109> base<00:00:59.660> is<00:01:00.660> just

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
look at its we can see the base is just

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.549 
look at its we can see the base is just
a<00:01:01.140> very<00:01:01.500> basic<00:01:02.420> sort<00:01:03.420> metal<00:01:03.840> structure<00:01:04.350> very

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
a very basic sort metal structure very

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.859 
a very basic sort metal structure very
firm<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:05.930> the<00:01:06.930> mattress<00:01:07.590> it's<00:01:08.189> probably<00:01:08.869> 25

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
firm and the mattress it's probably 25

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.760 
firm and the mattress it's probably 25
to<00:01:10.380> 26<00:01:11.040> centimeters<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:12.180> debt<00:01:12.540> it's<00:01:13.470> very

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
to 26 centimeters and debt it's very

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.980 
to 26 centimeters and debt it's very
strong<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:16.009> as<00:01:17.009> I<00:01:17.040> said<00:01:17.369> it's<00:01:17.580> very<00:01:17.729> firm<00:01:18.060> this

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
strong and as I said it's very firm this

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.210 
strong and as I said it's very firm this
is<00:01:19.049> probably<00:01:19.650> a<00:01:20.540> contract<00:01:21.540> made<00:01:21.869> bed

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
is probably a contract made bed

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.350 
is probably a contract made bed
specifically<00:01:23.220> for<00:01:23.520> very<00:01:23.850> good<00:01:24.150> quality

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
specifically for very good quality

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:31.609 
specifically for very good quality
hotels<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.320> that<00:01:26.159> some<00:01:27.380> pocket<00:01:28.380> strings<00:01:30.619> the

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
hotels and that some pocket strings the

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:37.580 
hotels and that some pocket strings the
pit<00:01:31.920> is<00:01:32.299> actually<00:01:33.299> a<00:01:33.390> zip<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:33.869> Link<00:01:33.930> it<00:01:36.590> you

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
pit is actually a zip and Link it you

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.280 
pit is actually a zip and Link it you
