camera so heavily loaded on solar damage
let's<00:01:31.320> go<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:32.390> let's<00:01:33.390> see<00:01:33.600> we'll<00:01:33.780> be<00:01:33.900> keeping

let's go to let's see we'll be keeping

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.530 
let's go to let's see we'll be keeping
this<00:01:34.320> mission<00:01:34.710> so<00:01:34.860> this<00:01:35.009> is<00:01:35.159> a<00:01:35.189> kill<00:01:35.579> these<00:01:35.759> $25

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
this mission so this is a kill these $25

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.140 
this mission so this is a kill these $25
I<00:01:36.600> think<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.869> best<00:01:37.110> way<00:01:37.229> to<00:01:37.380> do<00:01:37.740> this<00:01:37.860> one

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150 
I think the best way to do this one

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.660 
I think the best way to do this one
would<00:01:39.150> be<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.420> do<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:39.960> in<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.500> awakening<00:01:41.430> and

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
would be to do it in the awakening and

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.240 
would be to do it in the awakening and
as<00:01:42.390> long<00:01:42.540> as<00:01:42.659> we<00:01:42.780> keep<00:01:42.990> one<00:01:43.409> of<00:01:43.439> these<00:01:43.680> wizards

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
as long as we keep one of these wizards

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.590 
as long as we keep one of these wizards
or<00:01:44.369> like<00:01:44.490> I<00:01:44.610> think<00:01:44.820> we<00:01:44.880> should<00:01:44.909> be<00:01:45.210> good<00:01:45.329> i

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
or like I think we should be good i

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.270 
or like I think we should be good i
believe<00:01:46.369> we<00:01:47.369> get<00:01:47.520> a<00:01:47.579> bunch<00:01:47.880> of<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:49.280> Thrall

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
believe we get a bunch of a Thrall

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.800 
believe we get a bunch of a Thrall

right so we're good I had to do is go to
our<00:02:18.240> plane<00:02:18.600> replace<00:02:18.960> the<00:02:19.200> moon<00:02:19.410> again<00:02:19.800> and<00:02:20.090> we

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
our plane replace the moon again and we

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.410 
our plane replace the moon again and we
will<00:02:21.270> go<00:02:21.420> to<00:02:21.510> the<00:02:21.750> dark<00:02:22.080> beyond<00:02:23.150> launch<00:02:24.150> that

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
will go to the dark beyond launch that

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.780 
will go to the dark beyond launch that
and<00:02:24.690> just<00:02:25.380> get<00:02:25.560> the<00:02:25.620> 25th<00:02:26.250> at<00:02:26.370> all<00:02:26.430> right<00:02:26.610> there

that<00:02:26.940> should<00:02:27.180> be<00:02:27.330> relatively<00:02:27.780> easy<00:02:27.990> and<00:02:28.550> we

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
that should be relatively easy and we

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:30.950 
that should be relatively easy and we
should<00:02:29.790> be<00:02:29.940> able<00:02:30.120> to<00:02:30.300> complete<00:02:30.660> this<00:02:30.780> one

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
should be able to complete this one

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.200 
should be able to complete this one
really<00:02:31.140> really<00:02:31.440> quickly<00:02:31.650> so<00:02:32.210> definitely

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 
really really quickly so definitely

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.170 
really really quickly so definitely
something<00:02:33.720> to<00:02:34.320> get<00:02:35.250> to<00:02:35.460> really<00:02:35.640> clean<00:02:35.880> this<00:02:36.000> up

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
something to get to really clean this up

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.790 
something to get to really clean this up
but<00:02:36.660> we're<00:02:36.780> going<00:02:36.900> to<00:02:36.960> want<00:02:37.080> to<00:02:37.140> do<00:02:37.230> cases<00:02:37.620> make

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
but we're going to want to do cases make

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.400 
but we're going to want to do cases make

to<00:02:40.590> keep<00:02:40.740> will<00:02:41.100> just<00:02:41.280> automatically<00:02:41.790> die<00:02:42.060> i'm

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
to keep will just automatically die i'm

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.000 
to keep will just automatically die i'm
pretty<00:02:42.630> sure<00:02:42.870> the<00:02:43.140> droppings<00:02:43.590> will<00:02:43.770> still

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
pretty sure the droppings will still

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.040 
pretty sure the droppings will still
remain<00:02:44.310> active<00:02:44.850> and<00:02:45.030> then<00:02:45.600> we'll<00:02:45.780> go<00:02:45.960> ahead

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
remain active and then we'll go ahead

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.330 
remain active and then we'll go ahead
and<00:02:47.270> get<00:02:48.270> that<00:02:48.330> started<00:02:48.780> and<00:02:49.140> we<00:02:49.920> should<00:02:50.190> be

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
and get that started and we should be

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.280 
and get that started and we should be
really<00:02:51.090> really<00:02:51.210> good<00:02:51.480> you<00:02:51.840> should<00:02:52.050> we

really really good you should we

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:53.690 
really really good you should we
shouldn't<00:02:52.650> have<00:02:52.740> any<00:02:52.770> problems<00:02:53.310> just<00:02:53.340> getting

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
shouldn't have any problems just getting

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.610 
shouldn't have any problems just getting
the<00:02:53.790> 25<00:02:54.150> Willie<00:02:54.390> there's<00:02:54.600> more<00:02:54.780> than<00:02:54.930> 25<00:02:55.440> that

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
the 25 Willie there's more than 25 that

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.310 
the 25 Willie there's more than 25 that
spawned<00:02:56.090> within<00:02:57.090> this<00:02:57.270> portion<00:02:57.780> so<00:02:58.110> we

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
spawned within this portion so we

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.260 
spawned within this portion so we
shouldn't<00:02:58.950> have<00:02:59.070> any<00:02:59.190> problem<00:02:59.700> with<00:02:59.820> that<00:02:59.880> so
