00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.200 
you the hand of the king
eventually<00:04:31.699> that's<00:04:32.699> what<00:04:32.849> you<00:04:32.970> tell<00:04:33.120> your

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:40.139 
always savored all the calls and I guess

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:41.779 
always savored all the calls and I guess
we<00:04:40.289> should<00:04:40.470> show<00:04:40.740> this<00:04:40.979> one<00:04:41.220> right<00:04:41.430> away<00:04:41.580> yeah

00:04:41.779 --> 00:04:41.789 
we should show this one right away yeah

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:43.309 
we should show this one right away yeah
what<00:04:42.060> for<00:04:42.180> so<00:04:42.360> well<00:04:42.900> yeah<00:04:43.080> we<00:04:43.199> should

00:04:43.309 --> 00:04:43.319 
what for so well yeah we should

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:44.719 
what for so well yeah we should
absolutely<00:04:43.409> smothers<00:04:43.979> episode<00:04:44.340> and<00:04:44.460> I<00:04:44.490> think

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:44.729 
absolutely smothers episode and I think

here's the thing that's just what HBO

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.020 
here's the thing that's just what HBO
