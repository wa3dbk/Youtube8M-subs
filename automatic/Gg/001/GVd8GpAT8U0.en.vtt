00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:08.519
 online banknotes 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.340
 today our video lesson will open the 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.969
 make a leash 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:17.130
 I'm going to put a camera phone. 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:21.720
 photograph or any day you want 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:23.789
 currency or to save earrings rg theories 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.710
 other things you wanted 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.199
 I'll be there first or if it's 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.260
 little baby will satisfy for 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.969
 then we make a bigger one because 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.280
 there we will start our video lesson 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.690
 I hope you like any doubt. 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.690
 Was it you ask yourself? 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:44.090
 so I'll use the cell phone here 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.650
 as support 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.920
 this is a fabric or velvet like that of 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.020
 leopard 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.260
 but you can use any kind of 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:58.370
 fabric that you prefer is both in the 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:00.290
 satin and roquefort crepe or do not 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.989
 you see this is a retail if you arrive at 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:05.990
 store of fabric and talk like I want 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:08.870
 shred them to show the details you have 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.700
 in the lenk store in the width that I will leave 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:13.580
 three centimeters on each side 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.310
 Cynthia is already here and so do silva 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.380
 because I'm going to use it too. 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.050
 to save the camera is the camera is larger 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.030
 so you have to make it louder 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.400
 hungry the fire you're going to put 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.410
 inside let it higher if it is so 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.259
 avoiding that my god is always and 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:31.940
 already goes well here and I will let 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:33.229
 A little bit bigger I'm going to leave about four 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:37.270
 centimeters in me 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:37.270
 ok so I'm going to cut it now 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.220
 so here I already cut with the part 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.630
 I put it on top of the text again 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.980
 Let's cut the other so now we 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.520
 let's think the machine seamstress 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:51.740
 straight away , leaving only the only side 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.820
 pass that will be where the 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.820
 object you want 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:27.030
 I'm going to leave the body now more than later. 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.849
 I'm cutting the excesses. 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:33.150
 I'm not going to the place if you have 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:36.900
 overlocks is a good location otherwise you 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:39.090
 only uses the straight machine like me because it is 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:43.890
 will not shred if it is a fabric that 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:47.130
 reels off much then yes you need there the 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:50.810
 How will you stay inside and I 'll go 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.810
 put nothing that pulls the wire 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:54.290
 so I'll leave it that way 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.190
 let's breath 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.670
 the corners 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:20.400
 so here is good feel now we 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:21.870
 Let's do this top part to do. 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.379
 your part if you will do this 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:29.220
 It's true here just the size of 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:31.019
 string inside you can leave the 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.470
 Space to sew for you, yes. 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:36.000
 taking care of you you can sew after 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.439
 sewing felt some difficulty then 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:43.890
 now I'll do it like this, I'll move on 

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:46.879
 machine straight if good touch is had 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:53.670
 got pins and puts them 

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:56.400
 close and in this battle that stayed here we 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.470
 let's go 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:03.120
 if you want to make a ribbon teach 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:05.750
 How do you buy those already pro 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.750
 do it 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.360
 know here on the other side 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.979
 I will not leave the size I want 

00:04:30.459 --> 00:04:40.360
 It's raining net here, it's very raw here. 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:52.530
 also the little thing for god excesses in the 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:53.730
 only very edge and is ready to pull the 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:59.960
 our pocket 

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:59.960
 I'll put it in there. 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:11.010
 Okay, it's okay, if not here in the bag. 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.680
 you can do to choose the 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:16.590
 forgotten and I only used the machine 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:18.900
 straight good but if you want to overlock 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:22.680
 It's even better if you do the 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:25.200
 What have you been writers kissing? 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.430
 stay with god watching the others 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.160

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:34.110
 this dress even for those who have not seen 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:36.150
