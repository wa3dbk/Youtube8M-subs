00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
hey guys welcome to another end game set

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:03.800 
hey guys welcome to another end game set
up<00:00:02.700> so<00:00:02.850> this<00:00:02.939> is<00:00:03.120> pretty<00:00:03.270> much<00:00:03.449> like<00:00:03.510> my

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
up so this is pretty much like my

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.660 
up so this is pretty much like my
version<00:00:04.020> 3<00:00:04.380> but<00:00:04.560> I<00:00:04.589> added<00:00:04.890> some<00:00:04.920> things<00:00:05.250> to<00:00:05.490> it

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
version 3 but I added some things to it

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.760 
version 3 but I added some things to it
so<00:00:06.600> if<00:00:06.720> you<00:00:06.810> guys<00:00:06.960> can<00:00:07.140> give<00:00:07.259> me<00:00:07.290> feedback<00:00:07.560> on

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
so if you guys can give me feedback on

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.799 
so if you guys can give me feedback on
like<00:00:08.370> how<00:00:08.639> to<00:00:08.700> prevent<00:00:09.059> these<00:00:09.420> orders<00:00:09.719> from

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
like how to prevent these orders from

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.440 
like how to prevent these orders from
shooting<00:00:10.139> Elks<00:00:10.320> they<00:00:10.440> often<00:00:10.769> shoot<00:00:11.070> out<00:00:11.450> over

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
shooting Elks they often shoot out over

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.289 
shooting Elks they often shoot out over
here<00:00:12.719> and<00:00:12.929> it<00:00:13.170> ends<00:00:13.530> up<00:00:13.620> clogging<00:00:13.950> and<00:00:14.340> getting

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
here and it ends up clogging and getting

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:16.760 
here and it ends up clogging and getting
over<00:00:15.599> the<00:00:15.660> place<00:00:15.839> on<00:00:15.990> the<00:00:16.049> server<00:00:16.260> and<00:00:16.379> also

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
over the place on the server and also

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.380 
over the place on the server and also
ends<00:00:17.130> up<00:00:17.220> around<00:00:17.430> here<00:00:17.609> I<00:00:17.789> believe<00:00:18.270> it's

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
ends up around here I believe it's

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.359 
ends up around here I believe it's
mainly<00:00:18.570> because<00:00:18.869> of<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.170> explosion<00:00:19.439> see<00:00:19.980> if

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
mainly because of the explosion see if

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:21.890 
mainly because of the explosion see if
you<00:00:20.609> saw<00:00:20.760> that<00:00:20.939> one<00:00:21.119> did<00:00:21.270> another<00:00:21.570> one<00:00:21.750> just

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
you saw that one did another one just

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.750 
you saw that one did another one just
flew<00:00:22.050> out<00:00:22.140> you<00:00:22.769> just<00:00:22.920> keep<00:00:23.039> flying<00:00:23.250> out<00:00:23.550> and

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
flew out you just keep flying out and

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.240 
flew out you just keep flying out and
literally<00:00:24.720> into<00:00:24.900> place<00:00:25.109> but<00:00:25.710> anyways<00:00:25.980> some

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
literally into place but anyways some

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.679 
literally into place but anyways some
improvements<00:00:26.820> with<00:00:26.939> this<00:00:27.060> system<00:00:27.420> is<00:00:27.510> that<00:00:27.570> I

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
improvements with this system is that I

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.179 
improvements with this system is that I
added<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.080> side<00:00:28.320> compared<00:00:28.680> so<00:00:28.890> if<00:00:28.980> they<00:00:29.130> do

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
added the side compared so if they do

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.859 
added the side compared so if they do
blow<00:00:29.550> up<00:00:29.699> it's<00:00:29.910> going<00:00:30.029> to<00:00:30.119> go<00:00:30.240> down<00:00:30.269> here<00:00:30.779> and

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
blow up it's going to go down here and

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.659 
blow up it's going to go down here and
it's<00:00:31.529> going<00:00:31.650> to<00:00:31.740> end<00:00:31.830> up<00:00:31.980> going<00:00:32.250> down<00:00:32.369> here

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
it's going to end up going down here

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.420 
it's going to end up going down here
just<00:00:32.969> as<00:00:33.120> normal<00:00:33.510> so<00:00:33.920> that<00:00:34.920> helps<00:00:35.130> things<00:00:35.340> a

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
just as normal so that helps things a

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.950 
just as normal so that helps things a
little<00:00:35.550> bit<00:00:35.760> I<00:00:36.000> also<00:00:36.329> add<00:00:36.510> to<00:00:36.630> this<00:00:36.719> pink

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
little bit I also add to this pink

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.139 
little bit I also add to this pink
teleporter<00:00:37.500> so<00:00:37.680> if<00:00:38.070> one<00:00:38.550> of<00:00:38.610> them<00:00:38.730> flies<00:00:38.910> out

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
teleporter so if one of them flies out

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.880 
teleporter so if one of them flies out
here<00:00:39.360> as<00:00:39.450> well<00:00:39.600> it<00:00:39.960> will<00:00:40.140> go<00:00:40.290> over<00:00:40.379> here<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:40.710> go

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
here as well it will go over here and go

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.680 
here as well it will go over here and go
into<00:00:41.010> this<00:00:41.190> pink<00:00:41.550> teleporter<00:00:42.090> the

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
into this pink teleporter the

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:43.819 
into this pink teleporter the
disadvantage<00:00:43.170> with<00:00:43.260> that<00:00:43.410> is<00:00:43.559> that<00:00:43.590> either

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
disadvantage with that is that either

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.229 
disadvantage with that is that either
get<00:00:44.129> rid<00:00:44.219> of<00:00:44.280> like<00:00:44.460> two<00:00:44.610> or<00:00:44.700> three<00:00:44.760> upgraders

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
get rid of like two or three upgraders

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.190 
get rid of like two or three upgraders
but<00:00:45.390> you<00:00:45.450> can<00:00:45.570> always<00:00:45.660> make<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.020> system

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
but you can always make the system

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.160 
but you can always make the system
longer<00:00:46.829> and<00:00:47.450> another<00:00:48.450> thing<00:00:48.600> about<00:00:48.750> this<00:00:48.870> end

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
longer and another thing about this end

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.600 
longer and another thing about this end
gain<00:00:49.320> setup<00:00:49.649> is<00:00:49.770> that<00:00:49.920> if<00:00:50.010> you<00:00:50.100> use<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:50.280> lot<00:00:50.550> of

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
gain setup is that if you use a lot of

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.209 
gain setup is that if you use a lot of
or<00:00:50.940> it's<00:00:51.930> going<00:00:52.079> to<00:00:52.170> miss<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.530> fair<00:00:53.190> on

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
or it's going to miss the fair on

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.100 
or it's going to miss the fair on
blasters<00:00:53.940> which<00:00:54.390> are<00:00:54.539> these<00:00:54.660> things<00:00:54.690> these

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
blasters which are these things these

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.049 
blasters which are these things these
all<00:00:55.350> burnt<00:00:55.559> up<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:55.890> 500<00:00:56.309> million<00:00:56.460> so<00:00:56.850> there's

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
all burnt up to 500 million so there's

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.569 
all burnt up to 500 million so there's
really<00:00:57.149> no<00:00:57.420> reason<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.829> say<00:00:59.039> that<00:00:59.280> I<00:00:59.309> should

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
really no reason to say that I should

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.720 
really no reason to say that I should
use<00:00:59.730> a<00:00:59.760> bigger<00:01:00.149> or<00:01:01.039> because<00:01:02.039> it's<00:01:02.250> upgraded<00:01:02.430> in

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
use a bigger or because it's upgraded in

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.270 
use a bigger or because it's upgraded in
regardless<00:01:03.120> I<00:01:03.420> mean<00:01:03.739> this<00:01:04.739> is<00:01:04.799> really<00:01:05.040> no

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
regardless I mean this is really no

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.120 
regardless I mean this is really no
point<00:01:05.460> but<00:01:06.090> um<00:01:06.619> so<00:01:07.619> that<00:01:07.710> works<00:01:07.890> out<00:01:08.010> pretty

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
point but um so that works out pretty

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.789 
point but um so that works out pretty
well<00:01:08.360> so<00:01:09.360> if<00:01:09.450> you<00:01:09.540> use<00:01:09.659> about<00:01:10.049> maybe<00:01:10.290> one<00:01:10.560> third

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
well so if you use about maybe one third

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.710 
well so if you use about maybe one third
to<00:01:10.950> half<00:01:11.220> of<00:01:11.430> what<00:01:11.549> i'm<00:01:11.640> using<00:01:11.820> it<00:01:12.119> should<00:01:12.330> hit

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
to half of what i'm using it should hit

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.740 
to half of what i'm using it should hit
most<00:01:12.990> of<00:01:13.080> these<00:01:13.229> pretty<00:01:14.189> well<00:01:14.430> be<00:01:14.700> but<00:01:15.090> mine's

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
most of these pretty well be but mine's

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.410 
most of these pretty well be but mine's
about<00:01:15.930> probably<00:01:16.560> half<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.740> accuracy<00:01:17.420> because

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
about probably half the accuracy because

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.539 
about probably half the accuracy because
you<00:01:19.110> know<00:01:19.229> i<00:01:19.259> got<00:01:19.590> a<00:01:19.650> bunch<00:01:19.979> of<00:01:20.070> or<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.369> then<00:01:20.460> it

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
you know i got a bunch of or and then it

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.039 
you know i got a bunch of or and then it
clogs<00:01:20.820> up<00:01:21.030> right<00:01:21.210> here<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.659> it<00:01:21.810> starts

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
clogs up right here and it starts

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.679 
clogs up right here and it starts
missing<00:01:22.380> it<00:01:22.500> a<00:01:22.530> bit<00:01:22.740> I<00:01:23.450> don't<00:01:24.450> know<00:01:24.509> why<00:01:24.630> this

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
missing it a bit I don't know why this

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.060 
missing it a bit I don't know why this
teleporter<00:01:25.290> isn't<00:01:25.500> working<00:01:25.740> right<00:01:25.770> here

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
teleporter isn't working right here

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.679 
teleporter isn't working right here
that's<00:01:26.520> weird<00:01:26.790> even<00:01:27.180> though<00:01:27.270> it's<00:01:27.390> over<00:01:27.540> there

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
that's weird even though it's over there

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.060 
that's weird even though it's over there
as<00:01:27.780> well<00:01:27.930> but<00:01:29.990> what<00:01:30.990> else<00:01:31.140> did<00:01:31.320> I<00:01:31.439> improve<00:01:31.860> I

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
as well but what else did I improve I

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.130 
as well but what else did I improve I
got<00:01:32.430> rid<00:01:32.579> of<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.759> frozen<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.390> injustice

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
got rid of the frozen and injustice

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.170 
got rid of the frozen and injustice
because<00:01:34.560> it<00:01:34.680> was<00:01:34.770> too<00:01:34.979> big<00:01:35.250> you<00:01:35.670> know<00:01:35.790> it's

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
because it was too big you know it's

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.270 
because it was too big you know it's
just<00:01:36.210> a<00:01:36.450> huge<00:01:36.689> thing<00:01:37.049> I<00:01:37.259> mean<00:01:37.650> it's<00:01:37.799> only<00:01:37.890> a

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
just a huge thing I mean it's only a

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.330 
just a huge thing I mean it's only a
three<00:01:39.180> times<00:01:39.420> difference<00:01:39.900> you<00:01:40.710> know<00:01:40.740> so<00:01:41.189> it's

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
three times difference you know so it's

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.600 
three times difference you know so it's
not<00:01:41.490> that<00:01:41.549> much<00:01:42.860> so<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:43.979> setup<00:01:44.250> does<00:01:44.430> work

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
not that much so the setup does work

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.550 
not that much so the setup does work
pretty<00:01:44.640> well<00:01:44.909> you<00:01:45.240> can<00:01:45.390> use<00:01:45.420> more<00:01:45.869> evaluators

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
pretty well you can use more evaluators

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.910 
pretty well you can use more evaluators
if<00:01:46.860> you<00:01:46.979> want<00:01:47.250> I<00:01:48.210> have<00:01:48.659> 13<00:01:49.110> right<00:01:49.320> now<00:01:49.470> so

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
if you want I have 13 right now so

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.109 
if you want I have 13 right now so
you're<00:01:50.100> gonna<00:01:50.220> have<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.490> create<00:01:50.670> another<00:01:50.820> lane

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
you're gonna have to create another lane

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.690 
you're gonna have to create another lane
or<00:01:51.409> get<00:01:52.409> rid<00:01:52.560> of<00:01:52.590> some<00:01:52.680> plasters<00:01:53.399> but

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
or get rid of some plasters but

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.399 
or get rid of some plasters but
otherwise<00:01:54.060> it<00:01:54.299> won't<00:01:54.450> probably<00:01:54.570> go<00:01:54.780> up<00:01:54.899> to<00:01:54.990> 500

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
otherwise it won't probably go up to 500

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.780 
otherwise it won't probably go up to 500
million

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
million

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.050 
million
I<00:01:57.710> probably<00:01:58.710> recommend<00:01:59.040> like<00:01:59.280> 15<00:01:59.640> to<00:01:59.760> 20<00:02:00.030> of

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
I probably recommend like 15 to 20 of

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.520 
I probably recommend like 15 to 20 of
them<00:02:00.240> that's<00:02:00.540> what<00:02:00.720> most<00:02:00.870> people<00:02:01.200> use<00:02:01.350> at

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
them that's what most people use at

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.010 
them that's what most people use at
least<00:02:01.560> but<00:02:02.490> I<00:02:02.520> hope<00:02:02.730> you<00:02:02.850> guys<00:02:02.970> enjoyed<00:02:03.390> my<00:02:03.690> new

ending<00:02:04.350> set<00:02:04.620> up<00:02:04.710> leave<00:02:04.860> some<00:02:05.040> feedback<00:02:05.190> on<00:02:05.460> it

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
ending set up leave some feedback on it

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.650 
ending set up leave some feedback on it
I<00:02:07.520> think<00:02:08.520> it's<00:02:08.640> better<00:02:08.759> than<00:02:08.940> my<00:02:09.090> other<00:02:09.119> setups

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
I think it's better than my other setups

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.840 
I think it's better than my other setups
especially<00:02:10.080> when<00:02:10.200> it<00:02:10.290> comes<00:02:10.410> to<00:02:10.530> or<00:02:10.740> limit<00:02:11.040> but

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
especially when it comes to or limit but

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.490 
especially when it comes to or limit but
at<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:11.940> same<00:02:12.210> time<00:02:12.450> you<00:02:12.720> know<00:02:12.870> it<00:02:13.140> misses<00:02:13.470> the

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
at the same time you know it misses the

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.410 
at the same time you know it misses the
fair<00:02:13.770> and<00:02:13.800> blasters<00:02:14.370> because<00:02:14.730> i'm<00:02:14.850> using<00:02:14.880> so

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
fair and blasters because i'm using so

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.930 
fair and blasters because i'm using so
much<00:02:15.570> or<00:02:15.810> I<00:02:16.050> mean<00:02:16.230> let's<00:02:16.890> see<00:02:17.070> here<00:02:17.310> I<00:02:17.340> got<00:02:17.610> 20
