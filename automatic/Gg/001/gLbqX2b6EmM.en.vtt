00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:14.920 

I<00:00:05.290> believe<00:00:06.290> it's<00:00:06.470> only<00:00:06.590> two<00:00:06.920> lanes<00:00:07.160> here<00:00:13.930> there

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:14.930 
I believe it's only two lanes here there

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:17.589 
I believe it's only two lanes here there
is<00:00:15.490> something<00:00:16.490> weird<00:00:16.760> that's<00:00:17.150> been<00:00:17.330> happened

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:17.599 
is something weird that's been happened

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:19.160 
is something weird that's been happened
to<00:00:17.720> me<00:00:17.779> recently

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
to me recently

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:26.229 
to me recently
so<00:00:19.890> I<00:00:19.920> think<00:00:20.070> it's<00:00:20.340> weird<00:00:20.519> anyway<00:00:22.070> and<00:00:23.070> that<00:00:23.310> is

00:00:26.229 --> 00:00:26.239 

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:28.490 

whenever<00:00:27.239> I<00:00:27.300> look<00:00:27.509> at<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.689> clock<00:00:27.960> when<00:00:28.289> I'm<00:00:28.380> in

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
whenever I look at the clock when I'm in

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.159 
whenever I look at the clock when I'm in
bed<00:00:28.680> so<00:00:29.640> you<00:00:29.699> know<00:00:29.910> wake<00:00:30.359> up<00:00:30.660> sort<00:00:30.960> of<00:00:31.020> thing

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:31.169 
bed so you know wake up sort of thing

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:36.860 
bed so you know wake up sort of thing
I'm<00:00:31.320> thinking<00:00:31.680> Oh<00:00:31.890> what<00:00:32.610> time<00:00:32.790> is<00:00:32.940> it<00:00:35.870> I'm

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
I'm thinking Oh what time is it I'm

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.869 
I'm thinking Oh what time is it I'm
finding<00:00:37.290> it's<00:00:37.620> usually<00:00:37.830> like<00:00:38.220> three<00:00:38.640> three

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
finding it's usually like three three

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.030 
finding it's usually like three three
three<00:00:38.910> or<00:00:39.449> four<00:00:39.720> four<00:00:39.989> four<00:00:40.230> or<00:00:40.500> five<00:00:40.800> five

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
three or four four four or five five

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.850 
three or four four four or five five
five<00:00:41.339> or<00:00:42.559> one<00:00:43.559> one<00:00:43.710> one<00:00:44.629> so<00:00:45.629> all<00:00:45.900> the<00:00:46.739> numbers

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
five or one one one so all the numbers

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.860 
five or one one one so all the numbers
seems<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.400> be<00:00:47.489> matching<00:00:47.730> up<00:00:48.000> it's<00:00:48.540> a<00:00:48.659> bit

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
seems to be matching up it's a bit

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.599 
seems to be matching up it's a bit
freaky<00:00:49.559> right<00:00:50.190> then<00:00:50.430> no<00:00:50.610> idea<00:00:51.000> why

00:00:54.599 --> 00:00:54.609 

00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:56.390 

and

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:56.400 
and
