something that I'm trying to deliver a

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.160 
something that I'm trying to deliver a
client<00:00:47.250> in<00:00:47.399> this<00:00:47.700> case<00:00:47.760> I'll<00:00:48.360> just<00:00:48.420> use<00:00:48.960> the

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
client in this case I'll just use the

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.889 
client in this case I'll just use the
enhanced<00:00:49.530> matte<00:00:50.070> paper<00:00:50.399> and<00:00:50.760> because<00:00:51.629> this<00:00:51.780> is

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
enhanced matte paper and because this is

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.830 
enhanced matte paper and because this is
just<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:52.140> contact<00:00:52.590> sheet<00:00:52.680> fine<00:00:53.460> at<00:00:53.730> 720<00:00:54.480> dpi

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
just a contact sheet fine at 720 dpi

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.049 
just a contact sheet fine at 720 dpi
will<00:00:55.260> be<00:00:55.379> perfect<00:00:55.800> now<00:00:56.370> you<00:00:56.430> might<00:00:56.730> be<00:00:56.760> seeing

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
will be perfect now you might be seeing

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.240 
will be perfect now you might be seeing
different<00:00:57.510> options<00:00:57.930> here<00:00:58.230> because<00:00:58.890> we<00:00:59.219> are

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
different options here because we are

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.389 
different options here because we are
accessing<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.420> printer<00:01:01.230> driver<00:01:01.770> so<00:01:02.160> we're<00:01:02.309> no

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
accessing the printer driver so we're no

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.950 
accessing the printer driver so we're no
longer<00:01:02.579> in<00:01:02.850> Lightroom<00:01:03.180> so<00:01:03.390> what<00:01:03.539> you<00:01:03.629> see<00:01:03.870> is

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
longer in Lightroom so what you see is

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.450 
longer in Lightroom so what you see is
dependent<00:01:04.530> on<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.890> printer<00:01:05.189> that<00:01:05.339> you're

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
dependent on the printer that you're

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.460 
dependent on the printer that you're
printing<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:06.030> but<00:01:06.600> once<00:01:06.780> you<00:01:06.900> have<00:01:07.080> this<00:01:07.229> set

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
printing to but once you have this set

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.070 
printing to but once you have this set
up<00:01:07.619> you<00:01:08.159> want<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.430> click<00:01:08.760> Save<00:01:09.180> in<00:01:09.540> order<00:01:09.960> to

up you want to click Save in order to

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.620 
up you want to click Save in order to
save<00:01:10.350> those<00:01:10.650> settings<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.369> then<00:01:11.820> over<00:01:12.600> here

I<00:01:22.619> do<00:01:22.890> that<00:01:23.100> by<00:01:23.220> just<00:01:23.250> moving<00:01:23.729> all<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:23.970> sliders

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
I do that by just moving all the sliders

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.830 
I do that by just moving all the sliders
to<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.689> far<00:01:24.960> left<00:01:25.490> then<00:01:26.490> I<00:01:26.729> can<00:01:27.060> determine<00:01:27.390> how

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
to the far left then I can determine how

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.859 
to the far left then I can determine how
many<00:01:28.080> rows<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:28.860> how<00:01:29.310> many<00:01:29.520> columns<00:01:29.909> of<00:01:30.390> images

draft<00:02:59.910> mode<00:03:00.180> printing<00:03:00.720> it<00:03:01.260> will<00:03:01.470> take<00:03:01.740> less

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
draft mode printing it will take less

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.770 
draft mode printing it will take less
time<00:03:02.400> but<00:03:02.700> it<00:03:02.820> won't<00:03:02.970> be<00:03:03.090> quite<00:03:03.330> as<00:03:03.360> high<00:03:03.660> of

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
time but it won't be quite as high of

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.020 
time but it won't be quite as high of
quality<00:03:04.290> so<00:03:04.530> it<00:03:04.680> depends<00:03:05.070> on<00:03:05.190> what<00:03:05.850> you're

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030

quality so it depends on what you're
after<00:03:06.210> for<00:03:07.140> print<00:03:07.380> resolution<00:03:07.560> I'll<00:03:08.100> leave

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
after for print resolution I'll leave

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.110 
after for print resolution I'll leave
that<00:03:08.430> unchecked

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
that unchecked

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.490 
that unchecked
I'll<00:03:09.210> let<00:03:09.420> Lightroom<00:03:09.810> and<00:03:09.960> the<00:03:10.050> printer

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
I'll let Lightroom and the printer

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.680 
I'll let Lightroom and the printer
driver<00:03:10.740> determine<00:03:11.550> the<00:03:11.670> printer<00:03:12.060> resolution

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
driver determine the printer resolution

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.410 
driver determine the printer resolution
then<00:03:13.080> I<00:03:13.260> want<00:03:13.470> Lightroom<00:03:14.010> to<00:03:14.280> convert<00:03:14.940> the

then I want Lightroom to convert the
