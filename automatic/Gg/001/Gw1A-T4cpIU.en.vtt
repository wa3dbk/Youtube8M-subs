00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.440 
can ladder and i'm not willing to lose
20<00:00:06.810> points<00:00:07.700> because<00:00:08.700> obviously<00:00:08.940> when<00:00:09.330> you're

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
20 points because obviously when you're

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.570 
20 points because obviously when you're
at<00:00:09.570> a<00:00:09.599> high<00:00:09.780> level<00:00:09.809> the<00:00:10.530> way<00:00:10.710> the<00:00:10.830> ELO<00:00:11.219> system

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
at a high level the way the ELO system

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.490 
at a high level the way the ELO system
works<00:00:11.759> is<00:00:11.969> if<00:00:12.090> you<00:00:12.210> lose<00:00:12.389> a<00:00:12.660> game<00:00:13.019> at<00:00:13.170> all<00:00:13.259> you

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
works is if you lose a game at all you

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.440 
works is if you lose a game at all you
lose<00:00:13.650> a<00:00:13.679> bunch<00:00:13.980> of<00:00:14.130> points<00:00:14.280> and<00:00:14.670> i<00:00:15.179> guess<00:00:15.330> these

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
lose a bunch of points and i guess these

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:16.790 
lose a bunch of points and i guess these
players<00:00:15.750> met<00:00:16.049> each<00:00:16.170> other<00:00:16.289> on<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:16.619> ladder

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
players met each other on the ladder

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.849 
players met each other on the ladder
which<00:00:17.039> is<00:00:17.190> really<00:00:17.430> funny<00:00:18.619> yeah<00:00:19.619> we're<00:00:19.830> just

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.529 
which is really funny yeah we're just
going<00:00:20.100> to<00:00:20.130> fast<00:00:20.369> forward<00:00:20.490> at<00:00:20.880> the<00:00:21.060> maximum

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
going to fast forward at the maximum

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.929 
going to fast forward at the maximum
speed<00:00:21.750> here<00:00:22.260> and<00:00:22.439> as<00:00:23.010> we<00:00:23.250> wait<00:00:23.490> to<00:00:23.640> see<00:00:23.789> what
