starting<00:00:06.930> with<00:00:07.020> a<00:00:07.080> square<00:00:07.350> fold<00:00:07.710> up<00:00:07.890> in<00:00:08.040> half

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
starting with a square fold up in half

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.730 
starting with a square fold up in half
day<00:00:08.429> akali<00:00:08.730> if<00:00:09.540> you're<00:00:09.750> using<00:00:09.929> origami<00:00:10.500> paper

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
day akali if you're using origami paper

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.350 
day akali if you're using origami paper
then<00:00:11.130> you<00:00:11.219> use<00:00:11.370> the<00:00:11.550> colored<00:00:11.820> side<00:00:12.000> on<00:00:12.240> the

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
then you use the colored side on the

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.369 
then you use the colored side on the
inside<00:00:12.719> so<00:00:13.110> fold<00:00:13.500> it<00:00:13.590> up<00:00:13.710> in<00:00:13.860> half<00:00:14.040> diagonally

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:15.379 
inside so fold it up in half diagonally

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:19.370 
inside so fold it up in half diagonally
door<00:00:16.379> them<00:00:16.560> half<00:00:16.710> again<00:00:17.510> and<00:00:18.510> fold<00:00:19.050> in<00:00:19.230> half

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
door them half again and fold in half

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:34.310 
door them half again and fold in half
again<00:00:19.970> unfold<00:00:21.890> in<00:00:22.890> open<00:00:23.279> and<00:00:23.430> squash<00:00:33.320> then

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
again unfold in open and squash then

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.720 
again unfold in open and squash then
open<00:00:34.649> and<00:00:34.770> squash<00:00:35.040> again<00:00:37.190> so<00:00:38.190> this<00:00:38.430> is<00:00:38.610> the

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
open and squash again so this is the

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.709 
open and squash again so this is the
shortcut<00:00:39.000> way<00:00:40.550> and<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.790> proper<00:00:42.120> way<00:00:42.270> is<00:00:42.300> to

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
shortcut way and the proper way is to

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:55.310 
shortcut way and the proper way is to
fold<00:00:42.960> it<00:00:45.800> again<00:00:46.800> open<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.550> squash<00:00:53.989> so<00:00:54.989> do<00:00:55.199> that

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
fold it again open and squash so do that

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:06.920 
fold it again open and squash so do that
to<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.590> other<00:00:55.680> side<00:01:00.289> put<00:01:01.289> it<00:01:01.410> back<00:01:05.689> and<00:01:06.689> then

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
to the other side put it back and then

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.429 
to the other side put it back and then
put<00:01:07.140> that<00:01:07.320> back<00:01:08.420> then<00:01:09.420> turn<00:01:09.720> it<00:01:09.750> around<00:01:09.960> so

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
put that back then turn it around so

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.359 
put that back then turn it around so
you've<00:01:11.130> got<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.460> points<00:01:11.790> at<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:11.939> top<00:01:13.369> fold

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
you've got the points at the top fold

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:30.270 
you've got the points at the top fold
these<00:01:14.549> down<00:01:14.850> or<00:01:15.180> you<00:01:15.630> can<00:01:15.840> also<00:01:16.020> cut<00:01:16.439> these<00:01:16.590> off

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.880 

then<00:01:31.280> fold<00:01:31.549> this<00:01:31.820> up<00:01:32.170> so<00:01:33.170> that<00:01:33.409> this<00:01:33.530> point

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
then fold this up so that this point

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.530 
then fold this up so that this point
meets<00:01:34.130> this<00:01:34.400> edge<00:01:36.490> you<00:01:37.490> can<00:01:37.700> also<00:01:37.909> fold<00:01:38.360> this

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
meets this edge you can also fold this

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.030 
meets this edge you can also fold this
higher<00:01:38.750> if<00:01:38.990> you<00:01:39.020> want<00:01:39.320> if<00:01:39.530> you<00:01:39.650> want<00:01:39.800> to<00:01:39.890> bigger

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
higher if you want if you want to bigger

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.040 
higher if you want if you want to bigger
puff<00:01:40.280> or<00:01:40.610> you<00:01:41.030> can<00:01:41.240> fold<00:01:41.450> it<00:01:41.630> just<00:01:41.900> a<00:01:42.020> little

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
puff or you can fold it just a little

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.180 
puff or you can fold it just a little
bit<00:01:42.290> if<00:01:42.560> you're<00:01:42.710> on<00:01:42.770> a<00:01:42.799> small<00:01:43.100> puff<00:01:45.100> then<00:01:46.100> I

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190 
bit if you're on a small puff then I

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.219 
bit if you're on a small puff then I
fold<00:01:46.490> it<00:01:46.610> up<00:01:46.700> to<00:01:46.850> here<00:01:47.030> so<00:01:47.720> you<00:01:47.780> get<00:01:47.990> a<00:01:48.020> puff

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
fold it up to here so you get a puff

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:53.440 
fold it up to here so you get a puff
like<00:01:48.440> this<00:01:49.930> then<00:01:50.930> from<00:01:51.290> this<00:01:51.500> crease<00:01:51.860> to<00:01:52.450> this

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
like this then from this crease to this

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.510 
like this then from this crease to this
corner<00:01:53.720> you're<00:01:54.080> going<00:01:54.290> to<00:01:54.409> fold<00:01:54.680> a<00:01:54.860> diagonal

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
corner you're going to fold a diagonal

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:04.570 
corner you're going to fold a diagonal
line<00:02:00.190> on<00:02:01.190> the<00:02:01.520> side<00:02:01.789> and<00:02:02.060> that<00:02:02.300> side<00:02:03.520> so<00:02:04.520> you

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
line on the side and that side so you

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.880 
line on the side and that side so you
get<00:02:04.850> this<00:02:05.030> triangle<00:02:05.450> thing<00:02:05.780> but<00:02:06.560> you<00:02:06.649> can't

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
get this triangle thing but you can't

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.609 
get this triangle thing but you can't
fold<00:02:07.100> it<00:02:07.250> flat<00:02:07.369> or<00:02:07.640> a<00:02:07.700> little<00:02:07.850> lip<00:02:08.410> so<00:02:09.410> they've

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
fold it flat or a little lip so they've

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:16.180 
fold it flat or a little lip so they've
only<00:02:09.800> folds<00:02:10.369> when<00:02:10.550> you<00:02:10.759> fold<00:02:11.030> this<00:02:11.209> in<00:02:11.390> half<00:02:15.190> so

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
only folds when you fold this in half so

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.720 
only folds when you fold this in half so
do<00:02:16.430> that<00:02:16.640> to<00:02:16.820> all<00:02:17.030> eight<00:02:17.300> sides<00:02:18.400> once<00:02:19.400> you<00:02:19.550> do

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
do that to all eight sides once you do

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.350 
do that to all eight sides once you do
one<00:02:19.970> you<00:02:20.900> turn<00:02:21.140> the<00:02:21.320> page<00:02:21.530> to<00:02:21.860> the<00:02:21.890> lift<00:02:22.400> you

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
one you turn the page to the lift you

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.840 
one you turn the page to the lift you
turn<00:02:23.600> the<00:02:23.780> page<00:02:23.959> from<00:02:24.200> the<00:02:24.320> back<00:02:24.500> to<00:02:24.709> the<00:02:24.739> right

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
turn the page from the back to the right

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.630 
turn the page from the back to the right
so<00:02:25.850> that<00:02:26.030> you<00:02:26.120> keep<00:02:26.300> these<00:02:26.540> even<00:02:26.959> and<00:02:27.560> you<00:02:28.430> once

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
so that you keep these even and you once

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.070 
so that you keep these even and you once
you've<00:02:28.819> done<00:02:28.970> one<00:02:29.209> you<00:02:29.420> can<00:02:29.600> line<00:02:29.810> this<00:02:30.019> up

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
you've done one you can line this up

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:42.760 
you've done one you can line this up
with<00:02:30.440> the<00:02:30.590> one<00:02:30.709> you<00:02:30.860> just<00:02:30.890> did

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.470 

once<00:02:43.770> you've<00:02:43.920> done<00:02:44.100> all<00:02:44.160> of<00:02:44.310> them<00:02:44.580> just<00:02:45.209> crease

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
once you've done all of them just crease

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:52.180 
once you've done all of them just crease
them<00:02:47.480> then<00:02:48.480> you're<00:02:48.690> going<00:02:48.840> to<00:02:48.900> unfold<00:02:49.110> them

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.750 

then<00:02:53.190> you<00:02:53.340> open<00:02:53.700> this<00:02:53.790> up<00:02:55.130> and<00:02:56.130> you<00:02:56.340> fold<00:02:56.550> along

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
then you open this up and you fold along

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.330 
then you open this up and you fold along
this<00:02:57.060> crease<00:02:57.360> and<00:02:58.350> stop<00:02:58.740> when<00:02:58.980> you<00:02:59.010> get<00:02:59.280> to

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
this crease and stop when you get to

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.660 
this crease and stop when you get to
these<00:02:59.820> creases<00:03:00.920> so<00:03:01.920> if<00:03:01.980> you<00:03:02.100> put<00:03:02.280> your<00:03:02.430> thumb

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
these creases so if you put your thumb

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.870 
these creases so if you put your thumb
over<00:03:02.850> here<00:03:03.180> it'll<00:03:03.540> be<00:03:03.750> easier<00:03:04.170> to<00:03:04.200> crease<00:03:04.680> this

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:15.170 

and<00:03:08.880> fold<00:03:09.239> this<00:03:09.480> in<00:03:13.610> then<00:03:14.610> you're<00:03:14.790> going<00:03:14.970> to

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
and fold this in then you're going to

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.020 
and fold this in then you're going to
fold<00:03:15.390> up<00:03:15.690> this<00:03:15.900> corner<00:03:16.520> the<00:03:17.520> right<00:03:17.760> side

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
fold up this corner the right side

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:25.460 
fold up this corner the right side
corner<00:03:18.420> to<00:03:18.810> the<00:03:19.260> center<00:03:19.590> of<00:03:19.769> the<00:03:19.920> line<00:03:24.470> then

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
corner to the center of the line then

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.610 
corner to the center of the line then
unfold<00:03:26.070> turn<00:03:26.910> the<00:03:27.090> page<00:03:27.300> turn<00:03:28.170> the<00:03:28.260> page<00:03:28.410> at

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
unfold turn the page turn the page at

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.759 
unfold turn the page turn the page at
the<00:03:28.650> back<00:03:29.209> so<00:03:30.209> then<00:03:30.390> it's<00:03:30.510> even<00:03:30.720> then<00:03:31.530> you<00:03:31.560> do

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
the back so then it's even then you do

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:33.710 
the back so then it's even then you do
it<00:03:31.860> to<00:03:31.950> all<00:03:32.100> eight<00:03:32.310> sides<00:03:32.640> and<00:03:33.030> your<00:03:33.150> needle<00:03:33.570> on

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
it to all eight sides and your needle on

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:41.660 
it to all eight sides and your needle on
the<00:03:33.750> right<00:03:33.989> side<00:03:37.160> and<00:03:38.660> unfold<00:03:40.340> so<00:03:41.340> once<00:03:41.519> you've

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
the right side and unfold so once you've

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:42.949 
the right side and unfold so once you've
placed<00:03:41.820> all<00:03:42.120> the<00:03:42.239> corners<00:03:42.570> of<00:03:42.750> the<00:03:42.900> eight

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
placed all the corners of the eight

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:48.020 
placed all the corners of the eight
sides<00:03:44.239> pull<00:03:45.239> these<00:03:46.190> so<00:03:47.190> that<00:03:47.430> you<00:03:47.549> puff<00:03:47.820> out

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
sides pull these so that you puff out

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.699 
sides pull these so that you puff out
the<00:03:48.269> puff<00:03:48.480> evenly<00:03:51.019> so<00:03:52.019> just<00:03:52.290> pull<00:03:52.470> on<00:03:52.500> the

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
the puff evenly so just pull on the

00:03:52.709 --> 00:04:02.449 
the puff evenly so just pull on the
opposite<00:03:53.130> sides<00:04:00.769> so<00:04:01.769> the<00:04:01.799> puff<00:04:02.100> should<00:04:02.340> be

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
opposite sides so the puff should be

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:04.729 
opposite sides so the puff should be
even<00:04:02.790> like<00:04:02.940> that<00:04:03.150> so<00:04:03.989> once<00:04:04.260> you've<00:04:04.410> puffed<00:04:04.620> up

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
even like that so once you've puffed up

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:09.620 
even like that so once you've puffed up
the<00:04:04.890> middle<00:04:05.239> fold<00:04:06.239> up<00:04:06.420> the<00:04:06.540> corner<00:04:08.420> and<00:04:09.420> then

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
the middle fold up the corner and then

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:26.909 
the middle fold up the corner and then
just<00:04:09.810> flip<00:04:09.989> down<00:04:10.230> the<00:04:10.290> pedal

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:26.919 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:29.710 

you<00:04:27.919> can<00:04:28.100> also<00:04:28.280> use<00:04:28.430> tweezers<00:04:28.880> if<00:04:29.210> you<00:04:29.360> want<00:04:29.540> if

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
you can also use tweezers if you want if

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.810 
you can also use tweezers if you want if
this<00:04:29.960> is<00:04:30.139> too<00:04:30.320> small<00:04:33.040> so<00:04:34.040> as<00:04:34.250> you're<00:04:34.520> folding

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
this is too small so as you're folding

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.810 
this is too small so as you're folding
these<00:04:35.180> it's<00:04:35.600> closing<00:04:36.020> up<00:04:36.139> the<00:04:36.260> hole<00:04:36.440> so<00:04:36.820> this

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
these it's closing up the hole so this

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:57.879 
these it's closing up the hole so this
needs<00:04:38.000> to<00:04:38.150> be<00:04:38.210> priests<00:04:38.600> at<00:04:38.810> the<00:04:38.960> end<00:04:56.710> so<00:04:57.710> once

00:04:57.879 --> 00:04:57.889 
needs to be priests at the end so once

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:00.490 
needs to be priests at the end so once
you've<00:04:58.070> done<00:04:58.250> that<00:04:58.960> just<00:04:59.960> trying<00:05:00.260> to<00:05:00.320> shake

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:00.500 
you've done that just trying to shake

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.600 
you've done that just trying to shake
the<00:05:00.710> puff<00:05:00.860> again<00:05:01.010> by<00:05:01.400> pulling<00:05:01.700> on<00:05:01.820> it<00:05:03.610> then

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:04.610

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.779 
the puff again by pulling on it then
you're<00:05:04.760> going<00:05:04.910> to<00:05:05.000> shape<00:05:05.210> the<00:05:05.389> pedals<00:05:06.430> so<00:05:07.430> hold

index finger from the sides and then you
curve<00:05:20.510> the<00:05:20.720> pedal<00:05:20.960> out<00:05:24.460> so<00:05:25.460> when<00:05:25.639> you<00:05:25.760> put<00:05:25.940> your
