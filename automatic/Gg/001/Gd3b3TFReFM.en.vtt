00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.920
 hello to all guys and well found e 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.569
 this is a new weblog video 

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:08.160
 iphoneitalia.com in this video we go 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:12.059
 to review a product 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:14.519
 pure, very interesting for everyone 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.630
 those who play sports are talking about one 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.160
 pair of earphones with headband for 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.619
 keep firmly even during the 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.990
 race to physical activity and compatible 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.920
 with all the devices that have the 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.050
 port jack 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.369
 so let's start right away and go to 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.369
 see this product 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:46.140
 the pure earphones are distinguished by 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.030
 some special features 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.850
 first of all they are very easy from 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.700
 wear and also are very safe not 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.210
 they move once they are worn then they are 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:59.550
 resistant to splashes and sweat 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:02.660
 we can adjust the pavilion which 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:06.240
 go our old by rotating it 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:08.520
 we can decide to modify the 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.500
 greatness of the irinn pavilion 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.340
 what goes into the ear with various 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:17.550
 domains available in the box 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:20.100
 moreover the headphones are characterized by 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.890
 a passive reduction of noise from 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.100
 obviously the cable integrated in the ark 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.150
 of es directly only to enter the 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:32.220
 our device 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:36.720
 the cable is 120 cm long still the 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:39.290
 worse it is very light and certainly it is 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.550
 very interesting a back part 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.960
 These reflective earphones are very reflective 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.850
 interesting because they are above all 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.740
 very flexible so we can 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.710
 wear them without problems though 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.950
 a lot will remain firm to our body 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.720
 useful if we do sports or in any case if 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.090
 we run etc. 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.700
 in the box over the earphones 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:02.640
 we find as I have already told you the various 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.220
 domains you can change to change 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.500
 the size of yesterday's headset 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.179
 that enters our ear 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.180
 besides that we also find a 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.790
 simple instruction manual with the 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.340
 specific the specifications I go to 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.519
 report immediately then I can tell you 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:23.760
 that the frequency response of the 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:28.769
 earphones and 20 hearts to 20 kg 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:31.320
 hearts is that the jack is the 3.5 mm one 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:33.420
 in short, the classic little jack le 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:37.459
 earphone sizes are 10 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:40.110
 mm and also the jack is gold plated 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:43.230
 let's go ahead now I'll show you 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:45.750
 how smart remote works 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.630
 or how we can interact with 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.510
 our iphone directly 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:54.050
 from the button integrated in the earphone 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:56.120
 now you will not hear the music because I am 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:59.480
 recording the audio commentary separately 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.760
 but when we will start the 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.710
 playing any song 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.520
 we could go on or back 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:08.870
 simply by pressing our 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.640
 remote control we could also put in 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.880
 pause and resume playback 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:16.310
 or even more interesting to go 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.260
 directly to call Syrians 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:21.710
 now we try it and in fact we see that 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:23.870
 siri appears immediately to nor on 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:27.230
 our iphone so very useful though 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:29.690
 the iphone may be stuck in a band 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.280
 by the arm or in the pocket and we are 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.560
 using only the earphones 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.930
 maybe during a race and we want to 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.420
 reply a message or know 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.520
 something to be Syrians 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.920
 as I said the jack is compatible 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:45.020
 with all the audio devices therefore both 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.030
 with tablets both with smartphones and 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:49.250
 just with the ipods for example or 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:53.240
 with other media players 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:55.490
 the headphones are ergonomic and also i 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:57.200
 pavilions fit perfectly 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:01.010
 to our ears 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:04.250
 sure maybe the audio answer does not 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:06.620
 it is exceptional because i 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:09.470
 pavilions are tiny and maybe the 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.900
 highs are much more present in the bass 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:14.150
 but maybe equalize ndaw a little yes 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.870
 can we say solve some of 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.890
 these problems even if good or bad 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.350
 we know that from this kind of 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:24.800
 earphones we can not ask for 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:26.930
 an audio quality worthy of headphones well 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.480
 more professional so let's say there 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:33.040
 we can please without problems 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:36.040
 a classic a pair of earphones 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:38.080
 normal with the microphone and the 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:41.860
 characteristics more suitable for use 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:43.720
 sporty so do these earphones 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.520
 they already do so much respect 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.830
 to the use for which they were 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.020
 designed or those to make us 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.760
 company to help us during ours 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.620
 training sessions 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.440
 in any case, they are a good compromise 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:58.450
 also to replace the earphones of 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.640
 apple although of course the quality 

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:03.880
 audio for the original earphones is 

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:06.820
