00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
hub for the service I saw this back at

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.740 
hub for the service I saw this back at
CES<00:00:10.190> until<00:00:11.190> the<00:00:11.400> prototype<00:00:12.240> form

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
CES until the prototype form

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.349 
CES until the prototype form
yes<00:00:13.670> 2013<00:00:14.670> I've<00:00:15.269> got<00:00:15.450> my<00:00:15.599> surface<00:00:16.410> here<00:00:16.650> so

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:17.359 
yes 2013 I've got my surface here so

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:20.029 
yes 2013 I've got my surface here so
we're<00:00:18.359> going<00:00:18.449> to<00:00:18.510> do<00:00:18.630> is<00:00:19.230> that<00:00:19.470> I'll<00:00:19.859> we've

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
we're going to do is that I'll we've

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.320 
we're going to do is that I'll we've
come<00:00:20.250> around<00:00:20.460> so<00:00:20.640> we<00:00:20.699> can<00:00:20.789> have<00:00:20.910> a<00:00:20.970> closer<00:00:21.180> look

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
come around so we can have a closer look

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.099 
come around so we can have a closer look
at<00:00:21.570> it<00:00:21.720> I'm<00:00:21.960> going<00:00:22.410> to<00:00:22.470> see<00:00:22.680> how<00:00:22.980> this<00:00:23.310> little

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:24.109 
at it I'm going to see how this little

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:26.630 
at it I'm going to see how this little
expand<00:00:25.109> a<00:00:25.230> USB<00:00:25.680> expander<00:00:26.099> words<00:00:26.279> because<00:00:26.519> only

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
expand a USB expander words because only

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.150 
expand a USB expander words because only
wants<00:00:26.849> a<00:00:26.970> USB<00:00:27.720> port<00:00:27.990> on<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.140> surface<00:00:28.680> so<00:00:28.980> this

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
wants a USB port on the surface so this

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.200 
wants a USB port on the surface so this
gives<00:00:29.369> you<00:00:29.490> a<00:00:29.609> few<00:00:29.880> more<00:00:30.000> options<00:00:32.090> right<00:00:33.090> so

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
gives you a few more options right so

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.690 
gives you a few more options right so
here's<00:00:33.450> my<00:00:34.399> surface<00:00:35.399> and<00:00:35.969> here<00:00:36.450> is<00:00:36.690> the

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:37.700 
here's my surface and here is the

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.180 
here's my surface and here is the
adapter<00:00:38.719> works<00:00:39.719> for<00:00:40.050> with<00:00:40.230> surface<00:00:40.680> pro<00:00:40.950> and

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
adapter works for with surface pro and

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.400 
adapter works for with surface pro and
service<00:00:41.700> ICU<00:00:42.120> matter<00:00:42.329> with<00:00:42.600> any<00:00:42.870> USB<00:00:43.230> device

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
service ICU matter with any USB device

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.270 
service ICU matter with any USB device
it's<00:00:43.980> just<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.250> design<00:00:45.000> to<00:00:45.180> fit<00:00:46.250> with<00:00:47.250> the

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
it's just the design to fit with the

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.760 
it's just the design to fit with the
surface<00:00:47.879> so<00:00:48.870> actually<00:00:49.140> you<00:00:49.230> could<00:00:49.320> use<00:00:49.379> this

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
surface so actually you could use this

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.350 
surface so actually you could use this
on<00:00:50.059> anything

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
on anything

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.930 
on anything
it's<00:00:51.570> very<00:00:51.719> lightweight<00:00:52.640> ports<00:00:53.640> you've<00:00:53.760> got

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
it's very lightweight ports you've got

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.849 
it's very lightweight ports you've got
on<00:00:54.030> here<00:00:54.270> are<00:00:54.510> two<00:00:55.379> USB<00:00:55.800> ports<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:57.829> SD<00:00:58.829> card

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
on here are two USB ports a SD card

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.869 
on here are two USB ports a SD card
micro<00:00:59.730> SD<00:01:00.180> card<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:00.719> micro<00:01:01.379> USB<00:01:01.789> well<00:01:02.789> the

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
micro SD card and micro USB well the

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.590 
micro SD card and micro USB well the
idea<00:01:03.210> is<00:01:03.300> you<00:01:04.170> put<00:01:04.409> this<00:01:04.619> here<00:01:04.979> on<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:06.270> side<00:01:06.570> of

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
idea is you put this here on the side of

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.820 
idea is you put this here on the side of
your<00:01:06.869> surface<00:01:07.970> a<00:01:09.439> little<00:01:10.439> blue<00:01:10.590> light<00:01:10.799> on

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
your surface a little blue light on

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.590 
your surface a little blue light on
there<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:12.350> then<00:01:13.350> you've<00:01:13.560> got<00:01:13.770> your<00:01:14.600> extra

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
there and then you've got your extra

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.090 
there and then you've got your extra
port<00:01:15.900> so<00:01:16.049> you<00:01:16.080> can<00:01:16.170> plug<00:01:16.290> a<00:01:16.439> keyboard<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:17.009> a

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
port so you can plug a keyboard and a

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.310 
port so you can plug a keyboard and a
mouse<00:01:17.130> in<00:01:17.490> there<00:01:17.640> maybe<00:01:17.820> or<00:01:18.450> your<00:01:18.810> phone<00:01:19.049> in<00:01:19.259> a

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
mouse in there maybe or your phone in a

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:39.560 
mouse in there maybe or your phone in a
keyboard<00:01:19.830> or<00:01:20.369> any<00:01:20.939> combination

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.710 

so<00:01:40.570> example<00:01:41.170> here's<00:01:41.410> I've<00:01:41.620> got<00:01:41.770> an<00:01:41.890> SD<00:01:42.040> card<00:01:42.720> so

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
so example here's I've got an SD card so

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.210 
so example here's I've got an SD card so
put<00:01:43.900> that<00:01:44.050> straight<00:01:44.290> in<00:01:44.530> and<00:01:44.800> then<00:01:44.980> that's

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.220 
put that straight in and then that's

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:46.980 
put that straight in and then that's
ready<00:01:45.670> to<00:01:45.850> use<00:01:46.090> that's<00:01:46.420> quite<00:01:46.660> handy<00:01:46.780> if

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
ready to use that's quite handy if

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.170 
ready to use that's quite handy if
you've<00:01:47.230> got<00:01:47.440> your<00:01:47.620> digital<00:01:48.520> camera<00:01:48.910> you<00:01:49.060> can

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
you've got your digital camera you can

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:50.640 
you've got your digital camera you can
get<00:01:49.270> the<00:01:49.360> card<00:01:49.540> outside<00:01:49.990> put<00:01:50.200> it<00:01:50.290> straight<00:01:50.470> in

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:50.650 
get the card outside put it straight in

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.450 
get the card outside put it straight in
there<00:01:50.800> I<00:01:51.510> in<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:53.560> past<00:01:53.830> I've<00:01:54.070> use<00:01:54.280> one<00:01:54.400> of

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
there I in the past I've use one of

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.280 
there I in the past I've use one of
these<00:01:54.640> USB<00:01:55.830> SD<00:01:56.830> card<00:01:57.340> reader<00:01:57.790> which<00:01:58.180> goes<00:01:59.140> like

00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.290 
these USB SD card reader which goes like

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.010 
these USB SD card reader which goes like
that<00:01:59.470> which<00:02:00.070> I<00:02:00.370> can<00:02:00.880> still<00:02:01.090> use<00:02:01.300> because<00:02:01.900> I've

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
that which I can still use because I've

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.830 
that which I can still use because I've
now<00:02:02.200> got<00:02:02.440> two<00:02:03.340> USB<00:02:03.580> ports<00:02:04.119> on<00:02:04.270> there<00:02:04.510> rather

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
now got two USB ports on there rather

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.590 
now got two USB ports on there rather
than<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:06.070> one<00:02:06.220> that<00:02:06.250> the<00:02:06.460> surface<00:02:06.850> comes<00:02:07.300> with

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.150 

that's<00:02:10.600> the<00:02:10.660> other<00:02:10.810> thing<00:02:10.899> I<00:02:11.140> can<00:02:11.320> do<00:02:11.440> I<00:02:11.709> can

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
that's the other thing I can do I can

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.480 
that's the other thing I can do I can
plug<00:02:12.430> a<00:02:12.520> micro<00:02:12.880> SD<00:02:13.480> card<00:02:13.780> in<00:02:13.930> there<00:02:14.310> I've<00:02:15.310> got

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
plug a micro SD card in there I've got

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:16.850 
plug a micro SD card in there I've got
one<00:02:15.610> of<00:02:15.700> these<00:02:15.850> let's<00:02:16.209> try<00:02:16.420> that

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
one of these let's try that

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:27.060 
one of these let's try that
that's<00:02:17.860> my<00:02:18.010> micro<00:02:18.370> SD<00:02:18.730> card<00:02:25.740> so<00:02:26.740> I<00:02:26.770> put<00:02:26.980> the

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
that's my micro SD card so I put the

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.070 
that's my micro SD card so I put the
micro<00:02:27.400> SD<00:02:27.640> card<00:02:27.910> in<00:02:28.060> there<00:02:28.270> and<00:02:28.510> that's<00:02:28.690> shown

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
micro SD card in there and that's shown

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:37.890 
micro SD card in there and that's shown
up<00:02:30.120> there<00:02:31.120> in<00:02:31.420> my<00:02:31.739> in<00:02:32.739> my<00:02:32.800> surface<00:02:33.400> so<00:02:33.730> I<00:02:36.900> could

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
up there in my in my surface so I could

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.380 
up there in my in my surface so I could
also<00:02:38.550> same<00:02:39.550> time<00:02:41.370> stick<00:02:42.370> it<00:02:42.610> and<00:02:43.120> the<00:02:43.239> rest

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
also same time stick it and the rest

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.390 
also same time stick it and the rest
ecard<00:02:43.840> in<00:02:43.989> there<00:02:44.170> and<00:02:44.500> of<00:02:45.100> course<00:02:45.280> I've<00:02:45.370> got

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
ecard in there and of course I've got

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.770 
ecard in there and of course I've got
the<00:02:45.519> built-in<00:02:45.760> support<00:02:45.970> on<00:02:46.330> the<00:02:46.450> on<00:02:46.660> the

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
the built-in support on the on the

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:47.460 
the built-in support on the on the
surface<00:02:46.930> anyway

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
surface anyway

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.890 
surface anyway
so<00:02:47.920> I've<00:02:48.100> got<00:02:48.280> two<00:02:48.790> ports<00:02:49.090> in<00:02:49.239> there<00:02:49.420> I<00:02:49.600> could

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
so I've got two ports in there I could

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.820 
so I've got two ports in there I could
use<00:02:50.230> the<00:02:50.620> USB<00:02:51.250> port<00:02:51.640> so<00:02:52.060> I<00:02:52.989> could<00:02:53.140> use<00:02:53.290> this<00:02:53.380> USB

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
use the USB port so I could use this USB

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.590 
use the USB port so I could use this USB
port<00:02:54.160> and<00:02:54.550> they<00:02:54.820> could<00:02:55.000> plug<00:02:55.209> into<00:02:55.390> an

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
port and they could plug into an

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.259 
port and they could plug into an
external<00:02:55.840> hard<00:02:56.140> drive<00:02:56.230> something<00:02:56.830> like<00:02:56.980> that

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
external hard drive something like that

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:01.560 
external hard drive something like that
until<00:02:58.269> say<00:02:58.450> on<00:02:58.540> there<00:02:58.750> that<00:02:59.880> if<00:03:00.880> your<00:03:01.239> external

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
until say on there that if your external

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.630 
until say on there that if your external
hard<00:03:01.690> drive<00:03:02.049> needs<00:03:02.260> power<00:03:02.560> then<00:03:02.980> you<00:03:03.220> can<00:03:03.430> use

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
hard drive needs power then you can use

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.250 
hard drive needs power then you can use
one<00:03:03.850> port<00:03:04.090> from<00:03:04.269> this<00:03:04.420> and<00:03:04.600> one<00:03:04.780> port<00:03:05.019> from<00:03:05.110> an

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
one port from this and one port from an

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.710 
one port from this and one port from an
external<00:03:05.680> power<00:03:05.830> supply<00:03:06.010> for<00:03:06.250> the<00:03:06.489> USB<00:03:07.390> port

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
external power supply for the USB port

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.050 
external power supply for the USB port
so<00:03:07.959> I<00:03:08.410> can<00:03:08.560> plug<00:03:08.709> a<00:03:08.769> mouse<00:03:08.950> keyboard<00:03:09.400> in<00:03:09.850> there

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
so I can plug a mouse keyboard in there

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.759 
so I can plug a mouse keyboard in there
and<00:03:10.330> I<00:03:10.900> could<00:03:11.080> still<00:03:11.350> plug<00:03:11.890> in<00:03:12.070> my<00:03:13.769> other

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
and I could still plug in my other

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:18.690 
and I could still plug in my other
device<00:03:15.130> as<00:03:15.370> well<00:03:16.890> so<00:03:17.890> really<00:03:17.920> very
