was attending one of our free Ola

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.399 
was attending one of our free Ola
workshops<00:00:23.909> and<00:00:24.119> came<00:00:24.839> up<00:00:25.019> with<00:00:25.050> a<00:00:25.230> clever

00:00:25.399 --> 00:00:25.409 
workshops and came up with a clever

00:00:25.409 --> 00:00:27.349 
workshops and came up with a clever
design<00:00:25.650> for<00:00:26.099> one<00:00:26.249> of<00:00:26.339> our<00:00:26.460> other<00:00:26.519> outlets<00:00:27.149> and

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
design for one of our other outlets and

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.689 
design for one of our other outlets and
we<00:00:28.019> found<00:00:28.230> this<00:00:28.470> design<00:00:28.800> so<00:00:29.069> clever<00:00:29.339> that<00:00:29.460> we

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
we found this design so clever that we

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.290 
we found this design so clever that we
asked<00:00:30.089> him<00:00:30.359> to<00:00:30.560> redesign<00:00:31.560> this<00:00:32.550> design<00:00:33.000> with

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
asked him to redesign this design with

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.220 
asked him to redesign this design with

this<00:00:47.160> land<00:00:47.429> started<00:00:48.059> was<00:00:48.839> felt<00:00:49.829> of<00:00:50.039> spring

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
this land started was felt of spring

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.299 
this land started was felt of spring
steel<00:00:50.870> back<00:00:51.870> in<00:00:52.019> the<00:00:52.109> office<00:00:52.230> I<00:00:52.499> was<00:00:52.649> really

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
steel back in the office I was really

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.299 
steel back in the office I was really
fascinated<00:00:53.550> about<00:00:54.149> this<00:00:54.510> material<00:00:55.070> no<00:00:56.070> matter

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
fascinated about this material no matter

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.579 
fascinated about this material no matter
how<00:00:56.609> how<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:56.850> bend<00:00:57.239> it<00:00:57.420> it<00:00:58.019> always<00:00:58.199> goes<00:00:58.559> back

00:00:58.579 --> 00:00:58.589 
how how to bend it it always goes back

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:02.630 
how how to bend it it always goes back
in<00:00:59.039> its<00:00:59.159> entire<00:00:59.850> position<00:01:00.570> I<00:01:01.370> decided<00:01:02.370> to

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
in its entire position I decided to

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.290 
in its entire position I decided to
attend<00:01:03.080> Philips<00:01:04.080> Lumi<00:01:04.680> blade<00:01:04.890> reaction<00:01:05.370> we

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:06.300 
attend Philips Lumi blade reaction we

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.970 
attend Philips Lumi blade reaction we
saw<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.570> production<00:01:06.840> which<00:01:07.440> was<00:01:07.680> really

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:07.980 
saw the production which was really

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.820 
saw the production which was really
really<00:01:08.100> nice<00:01:08.720> they<00:01:09.720> told<00:01:10.260> us<00:01:10.440> about<00:01:10.470> the

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
really nice they told us about the

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
really nice they told us about the
technology<00:01:11.430> how<00:01:11.670> old<00:01:12.480> ads<00:01:12.780> are<00:01:13.080> made<00:01:13.800> what<00:01:14.670> the

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
technology how old ads are made what the

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.480 
technology how old ads are made what the
potential<00:01:15.450> only<00:01:16.050> the<00:01:16.380> technology<00:01:17.130> would<00:01:17.310> be

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
potential only the technology would be

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.970 
potential only the technology would be
and<00:01:17.670> what<00:01:17.790> what<00:01:18.300> will<00:01:18.570> come<00:01:18.870> in<00:01:19.230> the<00:01:19.350> future<00:01:19.530> I

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:19.980 
and what what will come in the future I

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.780 
and what what will come in the future I
knew<00:01:20.970> that<00:01:21.840> I<00:01:22.080> need<00:01:22.350> at<00:01:22.890> least<00:01:22.950> some<00:01:23.490> two

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
knew that I need at least some two

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.480 
knew that I need at least some two
panels<00:01:24.210> for<00:01:24.360> have<00:01:24.510> a<00:01:24.590> proper<00:01:25.590> light<00:01:25.770> for<00:01:26.400> the

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
panels for have a proper light for the

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.020 
panels for have a proper light for the
desk<00:01:26.730> so<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:27.900> when<00:01:28.110> I<00:01:28.140> put<00:01:28.950> those<00:01:29.160> two<00:01:29.640> outlets

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
desk so and when I put those two outlets

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.940 
desk so and when I put those two outlets
on<00:01:30.390> together<00:01:32.210> it<00:01:33.210> immediately<00:01:34.140> reminded<00:01:34.800> me

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
on together it immediately reminded me

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.680 
on together it immediately reminded me
on<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.190> old<00:01:35.340> code<00:01:35.580> bankers<00:01:36.180> land<00:01:36.420> the

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:36.690 
on the old code bankers land the

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.870 
on the old code bankers land the
proportions<00:01:37.320> it<00:01:37.530> was<00:01:37.680> long<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.220> quite<00:01:38.580> slim

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
proportions it was long and quite slim

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.300 
proportions it was long and quite slim
and<00:01:39.120> so<00:01:39.840> I<00:01:39.870> decided<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.440> do<00:01:40.650> a<00:01:40.680> new

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
and so I decided to do a new

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.890 
and so I decided to do a new
interpretation<00:01:41.880> of<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.470> bankers<00:01:43.470> land

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:44.900 
interpretation of the bankers land

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.590 
interpretation of the bankers land
pretty<00:01:45.900> simple<00:01:46.410> it's<00:01:46.560> based<00:01:46.860> on<00:01:47.160> a<00:01:47.600> thin

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
pretty simple it's based on a thin

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.630 
pretty simple it's based on a thin
stripe<00:01:49.470> of<00:01:49.740> spring<00:01:50.070> steel<00:01:50.960> on<00:01:51.960> a<00:01:52.130> rubber<00:01:53.130> cable

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
stripe of spring steel on a rubber cable

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.940 
stripe of spring steel on a rubber cable
which<00:01:53.880> is<00:01:54.060> resistant<00:01:54.720> against<00:01:55.290> mechanical

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
which is resistant against mechanical

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.940 
which is resistant against mechanical
friction<00:01:56.190> and<00:01:56.790> this<00:01:57.150> small<00:01:57.780> clamp<00:01:58.560> which

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
friction and this small clamp which

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.700 
friction and this small clamp which
comes<00:01:59.250> from<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.610> sailing<00:02:00.060> sports<00:02:00.360> and

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.980 

I<00:02:02.799> think<00:02:03.400> it's<00:02:03.520> pretty<00:02:03.880> self<00:02:04.330> evident<00:02:04.479> you

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
I think it's pretty self evident you

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.779 
I think it's pretty self evident you
release<00:02:05.890> the<00:02:06.130> cable<00:02:06.549> and<00:02:08.250> then<00:02:09.250> you<00:02:09.580> can

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
release the cable and then you can

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.540 
release the cable and then you can
adjust<00:02:10.690> the<00:02:10.840> angle<00:02:10.869> of<00:02:11.170> the<00:02:11.230> line<00:02:11.470> or<00:02:12.190> you<00:02:12.250> pull

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
adjust the angle of the line or you pull

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.710 
adjust the angle of the line or you pull
it<00:02:12.700> and<00:02:12.940> that's<00:02:13.780> it<00:02:14.670> it<00:02:15.670> will<00:02:15.880> hopefully<00:02:16.060> go

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
it and that's it it will hopefully go

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.260 
it and that's it it will hopefully go
into<00:02:16.930> production<00:02:17.170> next<00:02:17.590> year<00:02:17.740> summer<00:02:18.220> and<00:02:18.580> it

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
into production next year summer and it

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:24.870 
into production next year summer and it
will<00:02:19.480> be<00:02:19.780> the<00:02:19.959> first<00:02:20.760> proper<00:02:21.760> LED<00:02:22.270> desk<00:02:22.600> lamp
