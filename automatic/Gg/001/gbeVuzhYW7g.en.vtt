the<00:00:15.690> car<00:00:15.900> runs<00:00:16.170> like<00:00:16.320> it<00:00:16.859> should<00:00:17.160> and<00:00:17.460> there's

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
probably got it can take the pole we're

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.990 
probably got it can take the pole we're
fast<00:00:25.650> enough<00:00:26.039> they<00:00:26.220> got<00:00:26.369> to<00:00:26.460> get<00:00:26.550> enough<00:00:26.760> pit

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
new format what an advantage that can be

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.680 
new format what an advantage that can be
because<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.930> winner<00:00:34.230> of<00:00:34.350> segment<00:00:35.130> one<00:00:35.420> is<00:00:36.420> in

for the final ten lap - Oh car is
getting<00:00:42.540> it<00:00:42.750> in<00:00:42.870> there<00:00:42.989> let's<00:00:43.230> it<00:00:43.410> is<00:00:43.559> he's

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
getting it in there let's it is he's

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.069 
getting it in there let's it is he's
getting<00:00:43.980> off<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.430> corner<00:00:44.670> really<00:00:45.030> good<00:00:45.360> loses

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
getting off the corner really good loses

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.420 
getting off the corner really good loses
a<00:00:46.110> little<00:00:46.350> bit<00:00:46.590> in<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.739> middle<00:00:46.890> but<00:00:47.190> when<00:00:47.280> he

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
a little bit in the middle but when he

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.350 
a little bit in the middle but when he
nails<00:00:47.700> it<00:00:49.129> I<00:00:50.129> think<00:00:50.670> he<00:00:50.789> gets<00:00:50.969> a<00:00:51.090> little<00:00:51.270> bit

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
nails it I think he gets a little bit

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.580 
nails it I think he gets a little bit
loose<00:00:51.570> a<00:00:51.629> little<00:00:51.960> in<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.079> middle<00:00:52.110> cause<00:00:52.469> he's

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
loose a little in the middle cause he's

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.549 
loose a little in the middle cause he's

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.589 
he had a lot of spin on the get-go there
but<00:02:09.069> it<00:02:09.190> thing<00:02:09.369> hooked<00:02:09.640> up<00:02:09.849> once<00:02:10.090> it<00:02:10.239> took<00:02:10.390> off

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:10.599 
but it thing hooked up once it took off

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:11.520 
but it thing hooked up once it took off
it<00:02:10.810> was<00:02:10.869> gone

I<00:02:11.560> mean<00:02:12.099> just<00:02:12.280> look<00:02:12.700> at<00:02:12.940> how<00:02:13.150> much<00:02:13.360> faster<00:02:14.019> he

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
I mean just look at how much faster he

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.900 
I mean just look at how much faster he
