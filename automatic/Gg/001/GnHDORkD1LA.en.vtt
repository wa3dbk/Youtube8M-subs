00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:04.650
 hello everyone I'm power the we spend on 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.080
 the third day of consumer electronics 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.599
 Las Vegas show and today we are 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:13.110
 visiting kingston's boot here in 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.849
 las vegas in the compensation palace 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.470
 of the video that we are going to show you a 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.880
 thing called a micro duo that 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.220
 still not available in the market 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.890
 but that will be released in a few months 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.779
 probably at the end of the quarter 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:27.090
 of the first quarter of 2014 or 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.609
 beginning of the second quarter of 2014 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.550
 it is a very interesting gadget 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:36.719
 that we connect is tiny we connect to 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.190
 our device with android to the micro 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.750
 usb 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.309
 just plug it in let's see that 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.270
 I have two devices here right now 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.270
 I have on axis 2 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:53.410
 just plug it in you will see what 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.410
 if we turn on the device 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.370
 we have a password thank you.juan 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.920
 there we are, he recognizes it 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.619
 Y 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.869
 directly out the files that 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.360
 we have stored here because we can 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:19.979
 put files here either videos 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:22.259
 movies photos to expand the 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.240
 storage of our phone or 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.909
 tablet because it also works with 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.440
 Android tablet and then you see here that 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.390
 you can see all the files that we have 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.909
 previously loaded on computer and it's 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.500
 that this micro usb duo of kingston 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.530
 you can also connect directly 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.720
 to the computer's usb and so have the two 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.840
 loaded devices we're going to open by 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.140
 example a video here we have all the 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.140
 folders 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.220
 there we are 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.220
 as you see 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:00.280
 the avengers 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.280
 and we will have it 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.390
 and you see that it charges practically in a 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.270
 second what I liked the most about this 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.670
 is that you do not have to wait at all 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:16.210
 for example if we want to rewind the 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.210
 movie 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.970
 you do not see it does not take absolutely nothing is 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:23.940
 as if the file were 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:26.810
 directly on our device 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:30.380
 the same goes for example with music 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.380
 let's go back 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.209
 we go 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.610
 music 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.470
 in charge is that in less than two seconds 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.120
 and the same to rewind as you wish 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:55.299
 as if the files were here 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:57.370
 and well, the micro usb tube 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:03:00.250
 Kingston is going to come available with 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:03.790
 Various storage capacities 8GB 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.650
 16gb and 32gb I think also and as 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.110
 he said will be available by the end of 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.120
 this quarter or principles from which 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.239

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.239
