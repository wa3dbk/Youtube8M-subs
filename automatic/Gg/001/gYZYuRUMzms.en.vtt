of<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.480> defensive<00:02:21.870> players<00:02:22.050> would<00:02:22.200> be<00:02:22.290> to

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
of the defensive players would be to

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.810 
of the defensive players would be to
make<00:02:22.560> sure<00:02:22.590> that<00:02:22.740> the<00:02:23.040> lanes<00:02:23.340> in<00:02:23.520> front<00:02:23.700> of<00:02:23.760> the

make sure that the lanes in front of the
goal<00:02:24.000> are<00:02:24.150> clear<00:02:24.390> so<00:02:24.750> the<00:02:24.840> goalie<00:02:24.990> has<00:02:25.200> a<00:02:25.260> clear

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
goal are clear so the goalie has a clear

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.070 
goal are clear so the goalie has a clear
line<00:02:25.770> of<00:02:25.800> sight<00:02:25.920> for<00:02:26.220> where<00:02:26.310> the<00:02:26.400> puck<00:02:26.580> is<00:02:27.080> so

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
line of sight for where the puck is so

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.240 
line of sight for where the puck is so
now<00:02:28.170> taking<00:02:28.440> a<00:02:28.500> quick<00:02:28.650> look<00:02:28.680> at<00:02:28.890> the<00:02:28.950> different

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
physical game good examples of that

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.520 
physical game good examples of that
would<00:03:09.239> be<00:03:09.300> players<00:03:09.570> like<00:03:09.720> PK<00:03:09.989> Subban<00:03:10.320> of<00:03:10.440> the

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
would be players like PK Subban of the

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:16.670 
would be players like PK Subban of the
Montreal<00:03:10.890> Canadiens<00:03:15.170> so<00:03:16.170> this<00:03:16.320> brings<00:03:16.500> us<00:03:16.590> to

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680

the last position last but definitely

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.790

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
personally feel the goalies are going to

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:25.880 
personally feel the goalies are going to
be<00:03:24.540> one<00:03:24.720> in<00:03:24.900> one<00:03:25.020> of<00:03:25.110> the<00:03:25.170> most<00:03:25.290> toughest

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
simple but of course that comes with an

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.170 
simple but of course that comes with an
incredible<00:03:31.680> amount<00:03:31.920> of<00:03:32.040> pressure<00:03:32.280> now<00:03:33.090> the
