00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.840 
jumpstart a car using these things ah
okay<00:00:55.449> we're<00:00:55.600> going<00:00:55.719> to<00:00:55.780> start<00:00:56.170> by<00:00:56.610> getting<00:00:57.610> the

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
okay we're going to start by getting the

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.610 
okay we're going to start by getting the
two<00:00:57.969> cars<00:00:58.239> close<00:00:58.570> enough<00:00:58.839> to<00:00:58.960> one<00:00:59.079> another<00:00:59.379> so

00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.620 
two cars close enough to one another so

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.979 
two cars close enough to one another so
that<00:00:59.649> the<00:00:59.949> cable<00:01:00.100> reaches<00:01:00.519> between<00:01:00.670> both<00:01:01.059> cars

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.510 

for<00:01:04.989> the<00:01:05.049> next<00:01:05.289> trick<00:01:05.470> we<00:01:05.710> open<00:01:05.979> both<00:01:06.130> HUD's<00:01:06.369> on

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
for the next trick we open both HUD's on

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:14.550 
for the next trick we open both HUD's on
the<00:01:06.610> cars<00:01:12.630> Nellore<00:01:13.630> cut<00:01:13.899> the<00:01:14.020> hoods<00:01:14.170> open<00:01:14.319> on

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
the cars Nellore cut the hoods open on

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.630 
the cars Nellore cut the hoods open on
both<00:01:14.710> cars<00:01:15.690> battery<00:01:16.690> on<00:01:16.810> one<00:01:17.020> side<00:01:17.520> battery<00:01:18.520> on

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
both cars battery on one side battery on

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.450 
both cars battery on one side battery on
the<00:01:18.759> other<00:01:18.909> side<00:01:20.220> shouldn't<00:01:21.220> be<00:01:21.280> a<00:01:21.310> problem

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
the other side shouldn't be a problem

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:27.499 
the other side shouldn't be a problem
because<00:01:21.789> the<00:01:22.060> cables<00:01:22.420> will<00:01:22.509> be<00:01:22.630> long<00:01:22.780> enough

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.540 

this<00:01:28.509> is<00:01:28.780> the<00:01:28.869> good<00:01:29.170> car<00:01:29.409> I'm<00:01:29.890> going<00:01:30.130> to<00:01:30.250> start

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:30.550 
this is the good car I'm going to start

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.419 
this is the good car I'm going to start
with<00:01:30.880> the<00:01:31.149> good<00:01:31.270> car<00:01:31.539> and<00:01:31.830> you<00:01:32.830> always<00:01:33.069> start

00:01:33.419 --> 00:01:33.429 
with the good car and you always start

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:35.789 
with the good car and you always start
by<00:01:33.640> putting<00:01:34.360> on<00:01:34.479> the<00:01:34.509> positive<00:01:35.170> lead<00:01:35.319> first

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:35.799 
by putting on the positive lead first

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:38.039 
by putting on the positive lead first
but<00:01:36.700> here's<00:01:36.880> something<00:01:37.090> to<00:01:37.240> be<00:01:37.330> real<00:01:37.539> mindful

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:38.049 
but here's something to be real mindful

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:40.469 
but here's something to be real mindful
of<00:01:38.310> if<00:01:39.310> these<00:01:39.549> are<00:01:39.700> laying<00:01:39.850> on<00:01:39.970> the<00:01:40.060> ground<00:01:40.240> and

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
of if these are laying on the ground and

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:42.660 
of if these are laying on the ground and
they're<00:01:40.630> touching<00:01:41.020> my<00:01:41.979> little<00:01:42.220> incident

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
they're touching my little incident

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.090 
they're touching my little incident
earlier<00:01:43.170> was<00:01:44.170> because<00:01:44.500> I<00:01:44.530> had<00:01:44.770> it<00:01:44.860> hooked<00:01:45.009> up

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
earlier was because I had it hooked up

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.410 
earlier was because I had it hooked up
to<00:01:45.250> a<00:01:45.280> battery<00:01:45.549> and<00:01:45.759> I<00:01:45.789> touched<00:01:46.030> the<00:01:46.210> two<00:01:46.329> of

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
to a battery and I touched the two of

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:47.969 
to a battery and I touched the two of
these<00:01:46.509> things<00:01:46.780> together<00:01:47.020> you<00:01:47.680> don't<00:01:47.770> want

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979 
these things together you don't want

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:50.279 
these things together you don't want
these<00:01:48.100> touching<00:01:48.610> so<00:01:49.509> you<00:01:49.630> want<00:01:49.960> to<00:01:50.049> hook<00:01:50.140> these

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:50.289 
these touching so you want to hook these

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:52.770 
these touching so you want to hook these
up<00:01:50.350> one<00:01:50.950> at<00:01:51.100> a<00:01:51.189> time<00:01:51.430> so<00:01:51.820> that<00:01:51.850> both<00:01:52.390> are<00:01:52.630> not

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
up one at a time so that both are not

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.529 
up one at a time so that both are not
hooked<00:01:53.020> up<00:01:53.140> to<00:01:53.200> one<00:01:53.469> car<00:01:53.740> and<00:01:54.039> then<00:01:54.490> you're<00:01:55.030> got

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:55.539 
hooked up to one car and then you're got

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:56.819 
hooked up to one car and then you're got
these<00:01:55.689> other<00:01:55.930> two<00:01:56.140> laying<00:01:56.439> on<00:01:56.560> the<00:01:56.649> ground

00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:56.829 
these other two laying on the ground

00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:00.120 
these other two laying on the ground
that<00:01:57.130> could<00:01:57.250> potentially<00:01:57.820> arc<00:01:58.750> and<00:01:59.109> touch<00:01:59.350> so

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
that could potentially arc and touch so

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:05.359 
that could potentially arc and touch so
you<00:02:00.159> start<00:02:00.579> with<00:02:00.789> the<00:02:01.420> positive<00:02:01.899> battery<00:02:02.079> can

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.770 

just<00:02:06.369> give<00:02:06.490> it<00:02:06.609> a<00:02:06.640> little<00:02:06.789> wiggle<00:02:07.090> when<00:02:07.719> you

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
just give it a little wiggle when you

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.080 
just give it a little wiggle when you
put<00:02:08.049> it<00:02:08.140> on<00:02:08.229> that<00:02:08.560> way<00:02:08.739> the<00:02:09.489> teeth<00:02:09.789> from<00:02:10.030> the

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
put it on that way the teeth from the

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.330 
put it on that way the teeth from the
jumper<00:02:10.479> cables<00:02:10.509> will<00:02:10.989> bite<00:02:11.260> in<00:02:11.470> a<00:02:11.709> little<00:02:12.160> bit

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
jumper cables will bite in a little bit

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.490 
jumper cables will bite in a little bit
and<00:02:12.670> make<00:02:12.790> a<00:02:12.820> better<00:02:13.060> connection<00:02:13.390> okay<00:02:14.170> which

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
and make a better connection okay which

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.960 
and make a better connection okay which
one's<00:02:14.739> positive<00:02:15.220> and<00:02:15.370> which<00:02:15.489> one's<00:02:15.730> negative

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
one's positive and which one's negative

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.199 
one's positive and which one's negative
very<00:02:16.959> good<00:02:17.109> question<00:02:17.549> on<00:02:18.549> the<00:02:18.880> top<00:02:19.030> of<00:02:19.150> the

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
very good question on the top of the

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.770 
very good question on the top of the
battery<00:02:20.280> what<00:02:21.280> you'll<00:02:21.400> see<00:02:21.640> a<00:02:21.880> lot<00:02:22.450> of<00:02:22.540> times

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
battery what you'll see a lot of times

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.069 
battery what you'll see a lot of times
is<00:02:23.109> a<00:02:23.170> plus<00:02:23.890> sign<00:02:24.100> for<00:02:24.160> positive<00:02:24.850> and<00:02:25.090> a<00:02:25.720> minus

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:26.079 
is a plus sign for positive and a minus

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:28.080 
is a plus sign for positive and a minus
sign<00:02:26.290> for<00:02:26.560> negative<00:02:26.980> the<00:02:27.400> positive<00:02:27.910> cable

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
sign for negative the positive cable

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.490 
sign for negative the positive cable
will<00:02:28.390> have<00:02:28.600> like<00:02:28.870> something<00:02:29.440> red<00:02:29.769> on<00:02:29.920> it<00:02:30.040> I

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
will have like something red on it I

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.650 
will have like something red on it I
think<00:02:32.500> this<00:02:32.680> one's<00:02:32.890> red<00:02:33.160> and<00:02:34.150> then<00:02:34.390> a<00:02:34.420> negative

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
think this one's red and then a negative

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.319 
think this one's red and then a negative
cable<00:02:35.230> is<00:02:35.440> usually<00:02:35.950> black<00:02:36.190> but<00:02:36.820> say<00:02:36.970> in<00:02:37.090> a<00:02:37.150> case

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:37.329 
cable is usually black but say in a case

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:40.800 
cable is usually black but say in a case
like<00:02:37.510> this<00:02:37.840> you<00:02:38.250> don't<00:02:39.250> know<00:02:39.489> you<00:02:40.120> don't<00:02:40.299> see<00:02:40.569> a

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
like this you don't know you don't see a

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.170 
like this you don't know you don't see a
plus<00:02:41.319> sign<00:02:41.380> or<00:02:41.980> negative<00:02:42.340> sign<00:02:42.549> it's<00:02:42.819> kind<00:02:43.120> of

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
plus sign or negative sign it's kind of
