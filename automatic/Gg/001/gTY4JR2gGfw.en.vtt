up and turn around like so so that to

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.570 
up and turn around like so so that to
this<00:02:50.610> guy<00:02:50.910> who's<00:02:51.240> the<00:02:51.480> star<00:02:52.080> of<00:02:52.140> the<00:02:52.320> show<00:02:52.580> just

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
this guy who's the star of the show just

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.260 
this guy who's the star of the show just
give<00:02:53.760> you<00:02:53.850> example<00:02:54.390> how<00:02:55.230> big<00:02:55.470> is<00:02:56.090> that's<00:02:57.090> a

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
give you example how big is that's a

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.330 
give you example how big is that's a
q-tip<00:02:57.510> or<00:02:57.870> a<00:02:57.960> cotton<00:02:58.500> bud<00:02:58.650> depending<00:02:59.220> where

q-tip or a cotton bud depending where

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.190 
q-tip or a cotton bud depending where
you<00:02:59.370> are<00:02:59.490> and<00:03:01.130> nothing<00:03:02.130> shows<00:03:02.520> the<00:03:02.700> size<00:03:03.200> of

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
you are and nothing shows the size of

you are and nothing shows the size of
Soundwave<00:03:05.040> and<00:03:05.660> they<00:03:06.660> fully<00:03:06.900> transforms

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
Soundwave and they fully transforms

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.040 
Soundwave and they fully transforms
exactly<00:03:08.310> like<00:03:09.300> a<00:03:09.330> generation<00:03:09.930> one

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
exactly like a generation one

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.190 
exactly like a generation one

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200

their chemical twist around open his
feet<00:03:20.280> up<00:03:20.490> as<00:03:20.730> you<00:03:20.910> would<00:03:21.030> do<00:03:22.070> now<00:03:23.070> the<00:03:23.130> only

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
feet up as you would do now the only

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.330 
feet up as you would do now the only
downside<00:03:23.850> is<00:03:23.880> because<00:03:24.300> he<00:03:24.420> is<00:03:24.540> so<00:03:24.720> small<00:03:25.350> and

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
downside is because he is so small and

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:27.950 
downside is because he is so small and
probably<00:03:26.640> cuz<00:03:26.790> I<00:03:26.850> got<00:03:26.970> big<00:03:27.240> fingers<00:03:27.480> as<00:03:27.750> well

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:27.960 
probably cuz I got big fingers as well

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:38.460 
probably cuz I got big fingers as well
he's<00:03:28.140> not<00:03:28.970> that<00:03:29.970> easy<00:03:30.180> to<00:03:30.330> transform

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.759 

I'm<00:03:39.470> going<00:03:39.709> to<00:03:39.770> steal<00:03:40.010> that<00:03:40.040> anyway<00:03:41.769> open

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:42.769 
I'm going to steal that anyway open

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:48.280 
I'm going to steal that anyway open
those<00:03:42.860> arms<00:03:43.160> up<00:03:44.260> flip<00:03:45.260> is<00:03:45.379> that<00:03:45.500> open<00:03:46.959> and<00:03:47.959> then

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
those arms up flip is that open and then

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.270 
those arms up flip is that open and then
you<00:03:48.410> have<00:03:49.959> generation<00:03:50.959> one<00:03:51.349> sound<00:03:51.680> wave<00:03:51.920> and

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
you have generation one sound wave and

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.589 
you have generation one sound wave and
the<00:03:53.030> thing<00:03:53.450> that<00:03:53.720> I<00:03:53.750> love<00:03:54.170> about<00:03:54.410> the<00:03:54.800> sky<00:03:55.599> just

00:03:56.589 --> 00:03:56.599 
the thing that I love about the sky just

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:00.300 
the thing that I love about the sky just
gets<00:03:56.840> down<00:03:57.050> for<00:03:57.349> open<00:03:57.650> yep<00:03:58.040> there<00:03:58.370> it<00:03:58.459> is<00:03:58.580> is

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
gets down for open yep there it is is

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.539 
gets down for open yep there it is is
the<00:04:01.310> attention<00:04:01.670> to<00:04:01.700> detail<00:04:03.069> I'll<00:04:04.069> try<00:04:04.310> to<00:04:04.340> ship

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:04.549 
the attention to detail I'll try to ship

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:09.970 
the attention to detail I'll try to ship
out<00:04:04.670> the<00:04:04.790> way<00:04:04.970> so<00:04:05.239> you<00:04:05.480> can<00:04:05.630> see<00:04:06.040> and<00:04:07.040> close<00:04:08.980> I'm

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
out the way so you can see and close I'm

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:17.349 
out the way so you can see and close I'm
just<00:04:10.130> look<00:04:10.430> at<00:04:10.610> that<00:04:15.340> absolutely<00:04:16.340> amazing<00:04:16.850> and

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
just look at that absolutely amazing and

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:18.520 
just look at that absolutely amazing and
of<00:04:17.600> course<00:04:17.810> here's<00:04:17.989> the<00:04:18.019> exact<00:04:18.350> same

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
of course here's the exact same

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.750 
of course here's the exact same
articulation<00:04:19.930> as<00:04:20.930> here's<00:04:21.440> a<00:04:21.530> g1<00:04:22.190> counterpart

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760 
articulation as here's a g1 counterpart

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:27.250 
articulation as here's a g1 counterpart
if<00:04:23.510> you<00:04:23.720> can't<00:04:23.990> do<00:04:24.229> is<00:04:24.760> turn<00:04:25.760> his<00:04:25.940> head<00:04:26.260> now

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
if you can't do is turn his head now

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.060 
if you can't do is turn his head now
that<00:04:27.440> that's<00:04:27.740> fixed<00:04:29.740> now<00:04:30.740> if<00:04:30.889> I<00:04:31.010> could

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070 
that that's fixed now if I could

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:37.770 
that that's fixed now if I could
transform<00:04:32.000> is<00:04:32.270> a<00:04:35.470> the<00:04:36.470> original<00:04:36.889> sound<00:04:37.160> wave

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780

transform is a the original sound wave
has<00:04:38.780> a<00:04:38.810> comparison<00:04:39.680> you'll<00:04:40.550> see<00:04:40.790> exactly<00:04:40.880> what

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
has a comparison you'll see exactly what

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:52.779 
has a comparison you'll see exactly what
I<00:04:41.450> mean<00:04:50.380> that's<00:04:51.380> obviously<00:04:51.800> g1<00:04:52.280> sound<00:04:52.610> wave

00:04:52.779 --> 00:04:52.789 
I mean that's obviously g1 sound wave

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:57.180 
I mean that's obviously g1 sound wave
there<00:04:53.060> and<00:04:54.160> if<00:04:55.160> I<00:04:55.250> get<00:04:55.430> a<00:04:55.460> bit<00:04:55.580> of<00:04:55.610> trickery<00:04:56.000> on

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
there and if I get a bit of trickery on

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:06.640 
there and if I get a bit of trickery on
the<00:04:58.190> camera

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:06.650 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.650 

we<00:05:07.280> have<00:05:08.110> well<00:05:09.110> smallest<00:05:09.680> transformer

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:10.660 
we have well smallest transformer

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.860 
we have well smallest transformer
Soundwave<00:05:11.660> alongside<00:05:13.150> with<00:05:14.150> generation<00:05:14.720> one

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:14.870 
Soundwave alongside with generation one

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:18.730 
Soundwave alongside with generation one
sound<00:05:15.169> way<00:05:15.380> through<00:05:17.380> which<00:05:18.380> i<00:05:18.500> think<00:05:18.560> is

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
sound way through which i think is

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.249 
sound way through which i think is
pretty<00:05:18.889> cool<00:05:19.570> because<00:05:20.570> he<00:05:20.810> doesn't<00:05:20.960> have<00:05:21.050> all

00:05:21.249 --> 00:05:21.259 
pretty cool because he doesn't have all

00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:23.320 
pretty cool because he doesn't have all
the<00:05:21.289> stickers<00:05:21.680> and<00:05:21.979> so<00:05:22.130> forth<00:05:22.400> the<00:05:22.639> g<00:05:22.850> one<00:05:22.880> does

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:23.330 
the stickers and so forth the g one does

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.860 
the stickers and so forth the g one does
but<00:05:23.360> i<00:05:23.930> think<00:05:24.500> that's<00:05:24.620> pretty<00:05:24.860> pretty<00:05:25.490> good

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
but i think that's pretty pretty good

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:30.430 
but i think that's pretty pretty good
especially<00:05:26.870> something<00:05:27.229> so<00:05:27.500> small<00:05:28.300> now<00:05:29.300> if<00:05:30.259> i

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:30.440 
especially something so small now if i

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:33.640
