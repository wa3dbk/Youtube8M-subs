generally when we're shooting these hair
blowing<00:00:13.320> shots<00:00:13.740> with<00:00:14.040> fans<00:00:14.340> we<00:00:15.089> a<00:00:15.120> lot<00:00:15.360> of

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
blowing shots with fans we a lot of

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.260 
blowing shots with fans we a lot of
times<00:00:15.630> we'll<00:00:15.780> have<00:00:15.839> these<00:00:16.199> tiny<00:00:16.500> little<00:00:16.650> hairs

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:17.270 
times we'll have these tiny little hairs

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.210 
times we'll have these tiny little hairs
that<00:00:18.270> cross<00:00:19.020> over<00:00:19.199> the<00:00:19.439> eyes<00:00:19.590> and<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.039> face

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
that cross over the eyes and the face

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.040 
that cross over the eyes and the face
and<00:00:20.490> things<00:00:20.640> like<00:00:20.789> that<00:00:20.850> they're<00:00:21.779> pretty

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
and things like that they're pretty

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.109 
and things like that they're pretty
annoying<00:00:22.439> but<00:00:23.369> with<00:00:23.490> digital<00:00:23.609> it's<00:00:23.939> pretty

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
annoying but with digital it's pretty

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.480 
annoying but with digital it's pretty
easy<00:00:24.269> to<00:00:24.390> go<00:00:24.600> back<00:00:24.810> in<00:00:25.019> and<00:00:25.199> fix<00:00:25.410> it<00:00:25.619> and<00:00:25.769> sort

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
easy to go back in and fix it and sort

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.179 
easy to go back in and fix it and sort
of<00:00:26.580> save<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:26.880> image<00:00:27.210> so<00:00:27.990> what<00:00:28.800> we<00:00:28.920> start<00:00:29.099> off

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
of save the image so what we start off

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.800 
of save the image so what we start off
with<00:00:29.400> doing<00:00:29.550> is<00:00:29.820> basically<00:00:30.269> copying<00:00:30.630> the

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
with doing is basically copying the

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.420 
with doing is basically copying the
background<00:00:31.199> layer<00:00:31.439> and<00:00:31.740> you<00:00:32.130> can<00:00:32.160> do<00:00:32.279> that

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
background layer and you can do that

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.600 
background layer and you can do that
with<00:00:32.550> a<00:00:32.579> command<00:00:32.969> J<00:00:33.239> or<00:00:33.510> control<00:00:33.870> J<00:00:34.219> and<00:00:35.219> whoops

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
with a command J or control J and whoops

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.180 
with a command J or control J and whoops
one<00:00:35.880> too<00:00:36.030> many<00:00:36.180> times<00:00:36.420> so<00:00:37.079> command<00:00:37.800> J<00:00:37.950> will

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
one too many times so command J will

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.250 
one too many times so command J will
copy<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.940> actual<00:00:39.270> layer<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:39.750> basically

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
copy the the actual layer and basically

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.200 
copy the the actual layer and basically
what<00:00:40.440> we<00:00:40.530> want<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:40.770> do<00:00:40.860> is<00:00:40.980> grab<00:00:41.129> our<00:00:41.489> Healing

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
what we want to do is grab our Healing

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.790 
what we want to do is grab our Healing
Brush<00:00:42.239> tool<00:00:42.450> and<00:00:43.050> not<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.500> Spot<00:00:43.770> Healing

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
Brush tool and not the Spot Healing

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.560 
Brush tool and not the Spot Healing
Brush<00:00:44.160> but<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.579> actual<00:00:44.820> Healing<00:00:45.180> Brush<00:00:45.210> tool

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
Brush but the actual Healing Brush tool

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.440 
Brush but the actual Healing Brush tool
so<00:00:46.289> it<00:00:47.039> looks<00:00:47.190> like<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.340> band-aid<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.090> then

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
so it looks like a band-aid and then

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.760 
so it looks like a band-aid and then
what<00:00:48.539> we're<00:00:48.629> going<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:48.780> do<00:00:49.110> is<00:00:49.260> zoom<00:00:49.440> in<00:00:49.620> on<00:00:49.739> one

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
what we're going to do is zoom in on one

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.670 
what we're going to do is zoom in on one
of<00:00:49.950> these<00:00:50.129> hairs<00:00:50.840> we<00:00:51.840> have<00:00:52.020> these<00:00:52.140> hairs<00:00:52.440> that

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
of these hairs we have these hairs that

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.130 
of these hairs we have these hairs that
are<00:00:52.770> right<00:00:52.920> here<00:00:52.949> we<00:00:53.850> sample<00:00:54.329> typically<00:00:54.930> right

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
are right here we sample typically right

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.400 
are right here we sample typically right
next<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.620> hair<00:00:56.180> put<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.360> do<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:57.989> option

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
next to the hair put the do a option

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.819 
next to the hair put the do a option
click<00:00:58.940> put<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.289> little<00:01:01.289> circle<00:01:01.620> right<00:01:01.649> over

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
click put the little circle right over

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.100 
click put the little circle right over
the<00:01:02.129> hair<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.430> just<00:01:02.579> drag<00:01:02.940> down<00:01:03.019> it's<00:01:04.019> a

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
the hair and just drag down it's a

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.690 
the hair and just drag down it's a
pretty<00:01:04.379> simple<00:01:04.830> way<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:04.979> get<00:01:05.250> rid<00:01:05.400> of<00:01:05.430> hairs

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
pretty simple way to get rid of hairs

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.539 
pretty simple way to get rid of hairs
sometimes<00:01:06.630> I<00:01:06.780> miss<00:01:08.869> and<00:01:09.890> a<00:01:10.890> lot<00:01:11.340> of<00:01:11.400> times

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
sometimes I miss and a lot of times

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:12.620 
sometimes I miss and a lot of times
you'll<00:01:11.640> have<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:11.850> kind<00:01:12.000> of<00:01:12.090> go<00:01:12.180> in<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:12.420> clean

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
you'll have to kind of go in and clean

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:13.940 
you'll have to kind of go in and clean
up<00:01:12.810> but<00:01:13.020> basically<00:01:13.290> it's<00:01:13.470> it's<00:01:13.619> pretty<00:01:13.740> easy

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
up but basically it's it's pretty easy

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.810 
up but basically it's it's pretty easy
to<00:01:14.070> do<00:01:16.159> so<00:01:17.159> we're<00:01:17.250> going<00:01:17.340> to<00:01:17.400> option<00:01:17.790> click

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
to do so we're going to option click

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.520 
to do so we're going to option click
here<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.450> then<00:01:18.659> drag<00:01:19.080> across<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.770> hair<00:01:21.530> and

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
here and then drag across the hair and

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.770 
here and then drag across the hair and
it<00:01:22.770> gets<00:01:22.950> rid<00:01:23.189> of<00:01:23.220> it<00:01:23.400> really<00:01:23.670> nice<00:01:24.000> where

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
it gets rid of it really nice where

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.600 
it gets rid of it really nice where
you'll<00:01:24.930> run<00:01:25.140> into<00:01:25.290> a<00:01:25.439> problem<00:01:25.619> sometimes<00:01:26.400> is

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
you'll run into a problem sometimes is

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
where you're going to be sampling and

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.649 
where you're going to be sampling and
you<00:01:28.290> have<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.680> hair<00:01:28.950> where<00:01:29.759> it<00:01:29.909> crosses<00:01:30.180> from

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
you have the hair where it crosses from

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.810 
you have the hair where it crosses from
the<00:01:30.869> skin<00:01:31.229> to<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:31.590> darker<00:01:32.009> tone<00:01:32.159> or<00:01:32.490> vice-versa

from the dark tone to a light tone and

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.760 
from the dark tone to a light tone and
what<00:01:36.210> will<00:01:36.450> happen<00:01:36.630> so<00:01:37.079> for<00:01:37.229> instance<00:01:37.500> if<00:01:37.650> you

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
what will happen so for instance if you

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.280 
what will happen so for instance if you
will<00:01:37.950> do<00:01:38.520> an<00:01:38.670> option<00:01:39.060> click<00:01:39.299> sample<00:01:39.570> here<00:01:40.079> and

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
will do an option click sample here and

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.810 
will do an option click sample here and
then<00:01:40.439> start<00:01:40.710> dragging<00:01:41.040> here<00:01:41.520> right<00:01:41.700> up

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
then start dragging here right up

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.789 
then start dragging here right up
against<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.390> hair<00:01:42.600> when<00:01:43.170> you've<00:01:43.290> sampled<00:01:43.530> out

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
against the hair when you've sampled out

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.069 
against the hair when you've sampled out
here<00:01:44.070> away<00:01:44.250> from<00:01:44.460> there<00:01:44.610> what<00:01:45.360> will<00:01:45.509> happen<00:01:45.930> is

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
here away from there what will happen is

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.399 
here away from there what will happen is
you'll<00:01:46.350> you'll<00:01:47.159> create<00:01:47.579> sort<00:01:48.060> of<00:01:48.090> a<00:01:48.180> dark<00:01:48.570> spot

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
you'll you'll create sort of a dark spot

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.020 
you'll you'll create sort of a dark spot
where<00:01:49.680> it<00:01:49.799> pulls<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.250> color<00:01:50.460> out<00:01:50.729> a<00:01:50.759> little

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
where it pulls the color out a little

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.569 
where it pulls the color out a little
bit<00:01:51.380> so<00:01:52.380> what<00:01:52.530> you<00:01:52.680> want<00:01:52.920> to<00:01:53.009> do<00:01:53.100> is<00:01:53.220> actually

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
bit so what you want to do is actually

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.910 
bit so what you want to do is actually
come<00:01:53.759> in<00:01:53.880> here<00:01:54.240> along<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.780> edge<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.439> sample

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
come in here along the edge and sample

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.399 
come in here along the edge and sample
here<00:01:56.310> and<00:01:56.460> put<00:01:57.180> it<00:01:57.299> almost<00:01:57.719> in<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:57.930> exact<00:01:58.200> same

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
here and put it almost in the exact same

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:59.600 
here and put it almost in the exact same
spot<00:01:58.740> where<00:01:59.009> you're<00:01:59.100> going<00:01:59.219> to<00:01:59.280> be<00:01:59.399> dragging

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
spot where you're going to be dragging

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:00.950 
spot where you're going to be dragging
it<00:01:59.909> from<00:02:00.090> so<00:02:00.240> I'm<00:02:00.299> going<00:02:00.450> to<00:02:00.509> sample<00:02:00.719> right

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
it from so I'm going to sample right

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.490 
it from so I'm going to sample right
here<00:02:02.119> put<00:02:03.119> my<00:02:03.149> little<00:02:03.780> cursor<00:02:04.140> right<00:02:04.259> there

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
here put my little cursor right there

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.530 
here put my little cursor right there
and<00:02:04.560> just<00:02:04.740> drag<00:02:04.979> out<00:02:05.219> and<00:02:05.549> what<00:02:05.969> it<00:02:06.000> will<00:02:06.180> do<00:02:06.360> is

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
and just drag out and what it will do is

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.260 
and just drag out and what it will do is
give<00:02:06.719> me<00:02:06.869> a<00:02:06.899> lot<00:02:07.110> cleaner<00:02:07.640> line<00:02:08.640> up<00:02:08.910> here<00:02:09.149> and

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
give me a lot cleaner line up here and

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.969 
give me a lot cleaner line up here and
then<00:02:09.810> basically<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.319> same<00:02:10.470> thing<00:02:10.709> just<00:02:10.830> kind

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
then basically the same thing just kind

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.010 
then basically the same thing just kind
of<00:02:11.069> sample<00:02:11.489> along<00:02:11.700> as<00:02:11.910> you<00:02:12.030> go

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
of sample along as you go

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.080 
of sample along as you go
go<00:02:13.230> pretty<00:02:13.500> quick<00:02:13.770> I<00:02:14.040> want<00:02:14.280> you<00:02:14.370> to<00:02:14.490> do<00:02:14.820> this<00:02:14.970> a

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
go pretty quick I want you to do this a

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.490 
go pretty quick I want you to do this a
few<00:02:15.270> times<00:02:15.300> you<00:02:15.690> get<00:02:15.810> pretty<00:02:16.050> good<00:02:16.110> at<00:02:16.350> just

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
few times you get pretty good at just

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.920 
few times you get pretty good at just
kind<00:02:16.620> of<00:02:16.740> going<00:02:16.890> through<00:02:17.130> and<00:02:17.430> and<00:02:17.660> you<00:02:18.660> can<00:02:18.810> do

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
kind of going through and and you can do

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.830 
kind of going through and and you can do
it<00:02:19.050> fairly<00:02:19.350> fast<00:02:20.450> sometimes<00:02:21.450> you'll<00:02:21.570> screw<00:02:21.810> up

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
it fairly fast sometimes you'll screw up

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.300 
it fairly fast sometimes you'll screw up
a<00:02:22.050> little<00:02:22.230> bit<00:02:22.380> like<00:02:22.500> here<00:02:22.740> kind<00:02:23.040> of<00:02:23.070> change

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
a little bit like here kind of change

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.740 
a little bit like here kind of change
colors<00:02:23.670> you<00:02:23.760> can<00:02:23.910> kind<00:02:24.030> of<00:02:24.090> come<00:02:24.240> back<00:02:24.270> in<00:02:24.600> and

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
colors you can kind of come back in and

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.840 
colors you can kind of come back in and
fix<00:02:24.900> it<00:02:25.080> a<00:02:25.140> little<00:02:25.320> bit<00:02:25.530> which<00:02:26.340> takes<00:02:26.550> a<00:02:26.670> little

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
fix it a little bit which takes a little

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.240 
fix it a little bit which takes a little
practice<00:02:27.360> and<00:02:27.540> but<00:02:28.470> generally<00:02:28.830> the<00:02:29.070> biggest

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
practice and but generally the biggest

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.680 
practice and but generally the biggest
problem<00:02:29.640> people<00:02:29.670> have<00:02:29.910> had<00:02:30.180> is<00:02:30.420> where<00:02:30.570> the

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
problem people have had is where the

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.130 
problem people have had is where the
sample<00:02:31.250> against<00:02:32.250> two<00:02:32.400> colors<00:02:32.820> and<00:02:33.110> same<00:02:34.110> thing

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
sample against two colors and same thing

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.290 
sample against two colors and same thing
here<00:02:34.440> you'll<00:02:34.590> kind<00:02:34.800> of<00:02:34.860> go<00:02:35.070> between<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:35.550> dark

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
here you'll kind of go between the dark

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.480 
here you'll kind of go between the dark
and<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:36.540> light<00:02:36.740> sample<00:02:37.740> and<00:02:38.040> then<00:02:38.160> sort<00:02:38.370> of

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
and the light sample and then sort of

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.060 
and the light sample and then sort of
get<00:02:38.610> in<00:02:38.700> the<00:02:38.760> same<00:02:38.940> spot<00:02:39.300> and<00:02:39.480> pull<00:02:39.660> away

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
get in the same spot and pull away

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:41.840 
get in the same spot and pull away
there's<00:02:41.070> another<00:02:41.190> good<00:02:41.370> spot<00:02:41.640> down<00:02:41.820> here

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
there's another good spot down here

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.520 
there's another good spot down here
against<00:02:42.360> the<00:02:42.540> lips<00:02:42.780> where<00:02:43.050> you'll<00:02:43.200> see<00:02:43.410> the

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
against the lips where you'll see the

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.460 
against the lips where you'll see the
same<00:02:43.680> thing<00:02:44.630> basically<00:02:45.630> it<00:02:45.720> whoops<00:02:45.900> let<00:02:46.230> me<00:02:46.320> go

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
same thing basically it whoops let me go

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.120 
same thing basically it whoops let me go
back<00:02:46.620> out<00:02:46.770> a<00:02:46.800> little<00:02:47.100> bit<00:02:48.500> so<00:02:49.500> we'll<00:02:49.710> sample

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
back out a little bit so we'll sample

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.260 
back out a little bit so we'll sample
right<00:02:50.280> on<00:02:50.400> the<00:02:50.460> edge<00:02:50.580> of<00:02:50.730> the<00:02:50.820> lip<00:02:50.970> where<00:02:51.180> the

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
right on the edge of the lip where the

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.290 
right on the edge of the lip where the
color<00:02:51.480> is<00:02:52.010> sample<00:02:53.010> there<00:02:53.220> and<00:02:53.430> then<00:02:53.640> sort<00:02:54.210> of

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
color is sample there and then sort of

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.090 
color is sample there and then sort of
come<00:02:54.480> in<00:02:54.600> the<00:02:54.690> same<00:02:54.900> spot<00:02:55.320> over<00:02:55.350> here<00:02:55.620> and<00:02:56.010> then

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
come in the same spot over here and then

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.120 
come in the same spot over here and then
just<00:02:56.280> drag<00:02:56.520> up

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
just drag up

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.770 
just drag up
same<00:02:59.130> here<00:02:59.370> sample<00:02:59.880> on<00:03:00.000> the<00:03:00.030> edge<00:03:00.270> and<00:03:00.660> then

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
same here sample on the edge and then

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.740 
same here sample on the edge and then
kind<00:03:01.020> of<00:03:01.050> drag<00:03:01.290> up<00:03:01.470> from<00:03:01.680> there<00:03:02.480> so<00:03:03.480> it<00:03:03.540> works

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
kind of drag up from there so it works

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.110 
kind of drag up from there so it works
pretty<00:03:03.990> well<00:03:04.290> it<00:03:04.950> works<00:03:05.250> on<00:03:05.400> teeth<00:03:05.640> too<00:03:05.910> so

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
pretty well it works on teeth too so

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.340 
pretty well it works on teeth too so
kind<00:03:06.330> of<00:03:06.360> same<00:03:06.570> thing<00:03:06.600> where<00:03:06.960> you'll<00:03:07.080> kind<00:03:07.290> of

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
kind of same thing where you'll kind of

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:13.940 
kind of same thing where you'll kind of
come<00:03:07.500> in<00:03:07.710> and<00:03:07.970> then<00:03:08.970> drag<00:03:09.240> down<00:03:11.360> and<00:03:12.360> it's<00:03:13.020> kind

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
come in and then drag down and it's kind

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.200 
come in and then drag down and it's kind
of<00:03:14.010> fun<00:03:14.160> when<00:03:14.310> you<00:03:14.430> get<00:03:14.550> good<00:03:14.790> at<00:03:14.820> it<00:03:15.090> because

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:15.210 
of fun when you get good at it because

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:17.240 
of fun when you get good at it because
it<00:03:15.540> really<00:03:15.690> is<00:03:15.870> something<00:03:16.260> that<00:03:16.410> is<00:03:16.710> a<00:03:16.740> fairly

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
it really is something that is a fairly

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.330 
it really is something that is a fairly
easy<00:03:17.490> thing<00:03:17.850> to<00:03:18.350> handle<00:03:19.350> and<00:03:19.830> you<00:03:19.890> can<00:03:20.070> just

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
easy thing to handle and you can just

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:21.830 
easy thing to handle and you can just
kind<00:03:20.490> of<00:03:20.610> go<00:03:20.790> through<00:03:20.820> and<00:03:21.240> kind<00:03:21.420> of<00:03:21.480> clean<00:03:21.690> up

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
kind of go through and kind of clean up
