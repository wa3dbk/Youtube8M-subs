00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
the Windigo I guess that's what the

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:48.160

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
loosen but I guess you know when the

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.149 
loosen but I guess you know when the
games<00:01:51.049> come<00:01:51.290> down<00:01:51.470> to<00:01:51.619> like<00:01:51.710> the<00:01:51.830> last<00:01:51.979> ten

much<00:04:47.330> they<00:04:47.420> really<00:04:47.540> did<00:04:47.750> want<00:04:47.870> it<00:04:47.960> to<00:04:48.050> her<00:04:48.170> you

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
much they really did want it to her you

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.410 
much they really did want it to her you
seem<00:04:49.130> to<00:04:49.250> come<00:04:49.370> out<00:04:49.550> the<00:04:49.700> second<00:04:50.060> half<00:04:50.150> with<00:04:50.330> a

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:50.420 
seem to come out the second half with a

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:52.510 
seem to come out the second half with a
bit<00:04:50.540> more<00:04:50.570> purpose<00:04:51.200> was<00:04:51.380> was<00:04:51.680> that<00:04:51.830> a<00:04:51.890> quite<00:04:52.490> a

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
bit more purpose was was that a quite a

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.280 
bit more purpose was was that a quite a
strong<00:04:52.790> conversation<00:04:53.480> in<00:04:53.750> the<00:04:53.780> dressing<00:04:54.170> room

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:54.290 
strong conversation in the dressing room

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:55.930 
strong conversation in the dressing room
at<00:04:54.380> heart<00:04:54.530> attack<00:04:54.770> yeah<00:04:55.430> I<00:04:55.490> just<00:04:55.550> think<00:04:55.790> we

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:55.940 
at heart attack yeah I just think we

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.580 
at heart attack yeah I just think we
commit<00:04:56.360> the<00:04:56.450> stronger<00:04:56.750> the<00:04:56.870> two<00:04:57.050> you<00:04:57.170> know<00:04:57.290> I

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
commit the stronger the two you know I

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:59.410 
commit the stronger the two you know I
think<00:04:57.770> they<00:04:58.310> might<00:04:58.460> have<00:04:58.490> been<00:04:58.760> tired<00:04:58.970> of<00:04:59.150> an<00:04:59.270> R

00:04:59.410 --> 00:04:59.420 
think they might have been tired of an R

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:00.700 
think they might have been tired of an R
don't<00:04:59.690> know<00:04:59.750> why<00:04:59.810> was<00:04:59.990> what<00:05:00.140> we<00:05:00.230> quite<00:05:00.440> really

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
don't know why was what we quite really

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.130 
don't know why was what we quite really
fire<00:05:00.890> in<00:05:01.070> a<00:05:01.220> written<00:05:01.910> up<00:05:02.060> gained<00:05:02.240> quite<00:05:02.720> quite

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:03.140 
fire in a written up gained quite quite

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.999 
fire in a written up gained quite quite
front<00:05:03.380> in<00:05:03.500> front<00:05:03.590> on
