00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:07.760
 well hi it's cupertino I wanted 

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:11.660
 to share with you a discovery that 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:14.720
 I have seen on the internet and who 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:18.290
 trolling around Facebook on 

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.520
 sites etc which is pretty awesome so I 

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:21.529
 do not cheat I redid the experience 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.570
 so I will explain to you what I have 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:24.789
 done so I took I do not know the 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.660
 casino pub 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:28.960
 but I took the tablet the least 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.609
 dear and closest to my home 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:38.290
 they do not tamper with her whole 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:42.379
 here it is so I explain you 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:45.229
 I cut my tablet duo from the EU 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:46.940
 second of the second line to the waters to 

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:50.390
 the height of the third line in 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:54.019
 diagonal like that I cut in this 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.729
 dance in this the first row up 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:59.690
 precisely the diagonal of the second 

00:00:55.729 --> 00:01:01.909
 motor here and in fact I'm going to you 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.159
 show a tree magic tricks but 

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:05.570
 it's very funny I'll do it to you 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:06.950
 live so I'm close to cut it 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.090
 before I wanted to do it live I 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.460
 tried with a tablet I have everything 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.170
 screw up so I cut them and why 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.149
 to tell you everything with a cutter 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.509
 since with a knife it does not work and 

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:23.179
 so if we extract the square of chocolate 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:25.939
 here if we move the tablet I will you 

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:30.700
 watch here so i'm going to try the 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:39.109
 wedge and like that we reverse the two 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:45.380
 win because here I start again tac tac 

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:47.390
 tac state that we have an entire tablet 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.899
 it's great what the manufacturers are doing 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.329
 of chocolate 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:53.119
 they are smart enough I think that 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:53.630
 there we went to 100 g on the 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:55.219
 tablets 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.710
 I do not know if at the time she was 

00:01:55.219 --> 00:02:00.250
 friend 125 g 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:09.420
 so I start again I take off the little one 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:12.970
 square I'm shifting that side here I'm putting here 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:18.430
 and we always have the same number of cars 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:22.870
 and that's it well it was cupertino for 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:24.640
 a savings session here I am you 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.580
 wish a good day 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.840
 a good week and soon it was 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.230
 cupertino as usual 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.230
 ciao
