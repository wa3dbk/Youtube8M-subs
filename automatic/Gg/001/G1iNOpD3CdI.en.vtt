00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:29.330 
used to it I've played it a couple of

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.470 
used to it I've played it a couple of
times<00:00:29.420> it's<00:00:30.350> the<00:00:30.440> first<00:00:30.650> time<00:00:30.830> oh<00:00:31.100> I<00:00:31.460> don't<00:00:31.850> I

times it's the first time oh I don't I
think<00:00:32.840> it's<00:00:32.930> great<00:00:33.079> I<00:00:33.170> think<00:00:33.350> cows<00:00:33.649> masters

00:00:34.209 --> 00:00:34.219 
think it's great I think cows masters

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:37.049 
think it's great I think cows masters
have<00:00:34.489> done<00:00:34.790> a<00:00:35.000> super<00:00:35.360> job<00:00:35.390> actually<00:00:36.290> of<00:00:36.680> giving

00:00:37.049 --> 00:00:37.059 
have done a super job actually of giving

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:40.900 
have done a super job actually of giving
regular<00:00:38.059> people<00:00:38.449> a<00:00:38.600> proper<00:00:39.530> insight<00:00:39.949> into

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910 
regular people a proper insight into

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.160 
regular people a proper insight into
what<00:00:41.179> a<00:00:41.420> grand<00:00:41.780> prix<00:00:42.019> car<00:00:42.230> is<00:00:42.410> like<00:00:44.050> when<00:00:45.050> I<00:00:45.079> was

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
what a grand prix car is like when I was

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:46.810 
what a grand prix car is like when I was
practicing<00:00:45.649> on<00:00:45.739> the<00:00:45.829> sim<00:00:46.010> we<00:00:46.129> did<00:00:46.280> a<00:00:46.309> like<00:00:46.789> a

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
practicing on the sim we did a like a

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.750 
practicing on the sim we did a like a
full<00:00:47.179> full<00:00:47.809> loaded<00:00:48.199> fuel<00:00:48.469> car<00:00:48.769> and<00:00:49.070> then<00:00:49.579> went

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
full full loaded fuel car and then went

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.099 
full full loaded fuel car and then went
straight<00:00:49.909> to<00:00:50.120> a<00:00:50.210> qualifying<00:00:50.659> car<00:00:50.899> and<00:00:51.019> their

00:00:51.099 --> 00:00:51.109 
straight to a qualifying car and their

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:52.840 
straight to a qualifying car and their
differences<00:00:51.679> unbelievable<00:00:52.429> but<00:00:52.579> it's<00:00:52.730> the

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
differences unbelievable but it's the

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.369 
differences unbelievable but it's the
same<00:00:53.030> on<00:00:53.210> your<00:00:53.239> computer<00:00:53.749> games<00:00:53.929> I've<00:00:54.140> tried

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 
same on your computer games I've tried

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:56.380 
same on your computer games I've tried
it<00:00:54.530> I<00:00:54.769> went<00:00:55.190> from<00:00:55.249> a<00:00:55.429> road<00:00:55.640> card<00:00:55.909> at<00:00:56.089> a<00:00:56.120> hundred

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
it I went from a road card at a hundred

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.719 
it I went from a road card at a hundred
papers<00:00:56.690> about<00:00:56.989> to<00:00:57.140> 200<00:00:57.710> I<00:00:57.829> member<00:00:58.129> put<00:00:58.399> my<00:00:58.519> foot

00:00:58.719 --> 00:00:58.729 
papers about to 200 I member put my foot

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:59.979 
papers about to 200 I member put my foot
down<00:00:58.760> thinking<00:00:59.179> I'll<00:00:59.300> never<00:00:59.539> be<00:00:59.749> able<00:00:59.839> to

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
down thinking I'll never be able to

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:02.529 
down thinking I'll never be able to
control<00:01:00.260> this<00:01:00.440> amount<00:01:00.739> of<00:01:00.859> power<00:01:01.069> so<00:01:01.909> then<00:01:02.449> you

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:02.539 
control this amount of power so then you

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:04.299 
control this amount of power so then you
talk<00:01:02.659> about<00:01:02.749> are<00:01:03.019> you<00:01:03.109> hundreds<00:01:03.530> very<00:01:03.859> yeah

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
talk about are you hundreds very yeah

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.719 
talk about are you hundreds very yeah
okay<00:01:04.610> yes<00:01:05.300> it's<00:01:06.260> actually<00:01:06.470> more<00:01:06.920> difficult<00:01:07.520> to

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
okay yes it's actually more difficult to

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:10.030 
okay yes it's actually more difficult to
get<00:01:08.060> it<00:01:08.180> so<00:01:08.390> precise<00:01:08.810> when<00:01:09.470> you're<00:01:09.650> doing<00:01:09.920> it

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
get it so precise when you're doing it

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.590 
get it so precise when you're doing it
in<00:01:10.159> the<00:01:10.189> simulator<00:01:10.729> then<00:01:11.000> when<00:01:11.180> you're<00:01:11.329> doing

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
in the simulator then when you're doing

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.069 
in the simulator then when you're doing
it<00:01:11.689> in<00:01:11.869> the

00:01:15.069 --> 00:01:15.079 

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:18.560 

actually<00:01:16.079> I<00:01:16.140> playing<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:16.890> lot<00:01:17.310> of<00:01:18.030> former<00:01:18.420> one

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
actually I playing a lot of former one

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.480 
actually I playing a lot of former one
game<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:19.020> learn<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.409> tracks<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.979> get<00:01:20.159> a<00:01:20.189> little

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
game to learn the tracks to get a little

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:27.020 
game to learn the tracks to get a little
bit<00:01:20.700> yet<00:01:21.200> the<00:01:22.200> feeling<00:01:22.560> of<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.770> track<00:01:26.030> because

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
bit yet the feeling of the track because

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.330 
bit yet the feeling of the track because
the<00:01:27.149> circuit<00:01:27.630> surveys<00:01:28.140> are<00:01:28.649> so<00:01:28.829> accurate<00:01:29.009> now

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
the circuit surveys are so accurate now

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.190 
the circuit surveys are so accurate now
for<00:01:29.579> us<00:01:29.820> in<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.060> simulator<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:30.630> for<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.020> game

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
for us in the simulator and for the game

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.050 
for us in the simulator and for the game
as<00:01:31.380> well<00:01:31.530> you<00:01:31.799> can<00:01:31.829> just<00:01:32.070> drive<00:01:32.520> around<00:01:32.670> in<00:01:32.939> the

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
as well you can just drive around in the

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.789 
as well you can just drive around in the
game<00:01:33.210> on<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.780> same<00:01:33.990> circuit<00:01:34.470> you<00:01:34.530> won't<00:01:34.679> get

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
game on the same circuit you won't get

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.289 
game on the same circuit you won't get
any<00:01:34.890> surprises<00:01:35.250> when<00:01:35.429> you<00:01:35.670> turn<00:01:35.850> up<00:01:36.030> it<00:01:36.149> won't

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
any surprises when you turn up it won't

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.740 
any surprises when you turn up it won't
be<00:01:36.390> completely<00:01:36.750> different<00:01:38.479> house<00:01:39.479> it<00:01:39.630> will<00:01:39.689> be

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
be completely different house it will be

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.660 
be completely different house it will be

it's actually quite funny because when I
was<00:01:48.479> playing<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.869> game<00:01:49.080> and<00:01:49.110> I<00:01:49.380> wasn't<00:01:49.560> hot

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
was playing the game and I wasn't hot

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.289 
was playing the game and I wasn't hot
before<00:01:50.220> you<00:01:50.280> from<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.610> one<00:01:50.759> guy<00:01:50.909> I<00:01:51.060> really

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.309 
before you from the one guy I really
fought<00:01:51.450> it's<00:01:51.599> a<00:01:51.659> little<00:01:51.810> bit<00:01:51.899> too<00:01:52.020> much<00:01:52.140> like

00:01:52.309 --> 00:01:52.319 
fought it's a little bit too much like

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:54.230 
fought it's a little bit too much like
an<00:01:52.470> arcade<00:01:52.830> game<00:01:52.890> of<00:01:53.220> it<00:01:53.340> or<00:01:53.819> something<00:01:54.119> like

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
an arcade game of it or something like

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.699 
an arcade game of it or something like
that<00:01:54.299> but<00:01:54.630> now<00:01:54.810> I<00:01:54.840> really<00:01:55.140> have<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.289> say<00:01:55.380> it's

00:01:55.699 --> 00:01:55.709 
that but now I really have to say it's

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:58.470 
that but now I really have to say it's
really<00:01:56.009> good
