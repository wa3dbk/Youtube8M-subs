okay so this is what I've done so far
there's<00:00:05.759> my<00:00:05.879> house<00:00:06.089> and<00:00:06.390> the<00:00:06.450> observatory<00:00:07.080> if

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
there's my house and the observatory if

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.200 
there's my house and the observatory if
you<00:00:08.550> look<00:00:08.790> right<00:00:09.510> there<00:00:10.200> is<00:00:10.730> the<00:00:11.730> Delta

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
you look right there is the Delta

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.300 
you look right there is the Delta
section<00:00:14.990> so<00:00:15.990> that's<00:00:16.170> how<00:00:16.289> far<00:00:16.560> away<00:00:16.650> I<00:00:16.800> am<00:00:16.920> now

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
section so that's how far away I am now

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:25.870 
section so that's how far away I am now
and<00:00:18.289> then<00:00:19.289> we'll<00:00:19.529> keep<00:00:19.710> traveling<00:00:20.189> this<00:00:20.369> way

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:25.880 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.779 

I'm<00:00:26.880> also<00:00:27.119> going<00:00:27.420> to<00:00:27.480> do<00:00:27.800> periodic<00:00:28.800> updates<00:00:28.980> on

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
I'm also going to do periodic updates on

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.799 
I'm also going to do periodic updates on
my<00:00:30.679> world<00:00:31.679> map<00:00:31.920> so<00:00:32.790> if<00:00:33.090> you<00:00:33.300> still<00:00:33.570> have<00:00:33.690> the

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
my world map so if you still have the

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.410 
my world map so if you still have the
link<00:00:34.020> for<00:00:34.260> that<00:00:34.820> that'll<00:00:35.820> be<00:00:35.910> updated<00:00:36.360> every

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
link for that that'll be updated every

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:50.709 
link for that that'll be updated every
once<00:00:36.719> a<00:00:36.870> while<00:00:42.230> this<00:00:43.230> is<00:00:43.469> a<00:00:43.500> pretty<00:00:43.770> long<00:00:44.010> track

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:50.719 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:01:11.090 

see<00:00:51.719> I<00:00:55.489> like<00:00:56.489> thunder

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.530 

and<00:01:12.100> there<00:01:12.400> you<00:01:12.640> can<00:01:12.670> kind<00:01:13.030> of<00:01:13.120> see<00:01:13.180> what<00:01:13.420> I've

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 
and there you can kind of see what I've

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.610 
and there you can kind of see what I've
done<00:01:13.750> right<00:01:14.020> now<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:17.020> put<00:01:17.050> it<00:01:17.290> perspective

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:17.620 
done right now to put it perspective

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.880 
done right now to put it perspective
will<00:01:18.070> get<00:01:18.190> over<00:01:18.310> there<00:01:18.550> in<00:01:18.640> just<00:01:18.730> a<00:01:18.910> second

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
that is my new quarry that massive thing

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.110 
that is my new quarry that massive thing

video later with some other stuff that
I've<00:01:45.910> already<00:01:46.090> done<00:01:46.420> I'm<00:01:47.050> just<00:01:47.290> kind<00:01:47.500> of

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
I've already done I'm just kind of

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.120 
I've already done I'm just kind of
skipping<00:01:47.890> that<00:01:48.070> part<00:01:48.340> so<00:01:48.790> I'll<00:01:48.880> show<00:01:49.090> you<00:01:49.150> this

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
skipping that part so I'll show you this

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.700 
skipping that part so I'll show you this
now<00:01:51.130> that<00:01:51.840> right<00:01:52.840> there<00:01:52.869> that<00:01:53.140> is<00:01:53.350> awesome

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
now that right there that is awesome

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.770 
now that right there that is awesome
getting<00:01:54.280> them<00:01:54.400> spaced<00:01:54.700> like<00:01:55.000> that<00:01:55.210> was

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
getting them spaced like that was

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:01.320 
getting them spaced like that was
perfect<00:01:58.229> floating<00:01:59.229> in<00:01:59.350> mid-air<00:01:59.560> and<00:02:00.330> at

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
perfect floating in mid-air and at

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.690 
perfect floating in mid-air and at
nighttime<00:02:01.570> they<00:02:01.810> do<00:02:02.110> provide<00:02:02.700> adequate

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
nighttime they do provide adequate

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.290 
nighttime they do provide adequate
lighting<00:02:03.940> here<00:02:04.390> in<00:02:04.479> the<00:02:04.570> center<00:02:04.869> so<00:02:06.300> we're

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:07.300 
lighting here in the center so we're

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.570 
lighting here in the center so we're
pretty<00:02:07.479> safe<00:02:07.750> there<00:02:11.160> and<00:02:12.160> that's<00:02:12.310> basically

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
pretty safe there and that's basically

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.280 
pretty safe there and that's basically
it<00:02:12.940> this<00:02:13.269> Cape<00:02:13.510> doesn't<00:02:13.840> really<00:02:13.959> go<00:02:14.140> any

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
it this Cape doesn't really go any

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.680 
it this Cape doesn't really go any
further<00:02:14.560> than<00:02:14.830> that<00:02:15.100> that<00:02:16.060> cave<00:02:16.390> goes<00:02:16.660> a

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
further than that that cave goes a

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.479 
further than that that cave goes a
little<00:02:17.110> bit<00:02:17.290> further<00:02:17.530> and<00:02:17.769> then<00:02:17.890> opens<00:02:18.220> up<00:02:18.340> to

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
little bit further and then opens up to

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:19.710 
little bit further and then opens up to
the<00:02:18.610> surface<00:02:18.820> in<00:02:19.150> like<00:02:19.300> three<00:02:19.570> different

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
the surface in like three different

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.990 
the surface in like three different
spots<00:02:20.019> and<00:02:20.410> then<00:02:21.160> there's<00:02:21.340> this<00:02:21.580> one<00:02:21.820> which

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
spots and then there's this one which

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.620 
spots and then there's this one which
all<00:02:22.150> eventually<00:02:22.570> even<00:02:22.989> out<00:02:23.350> with<00:02:24.510> figure<00:02:25.510> out

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
all eventually even out with figure out

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.920 
all eventually even out with figure out
where<00:02:25.810> that<00:02:25.959> goes<00:02:27.600> but<00:02:28.600> other<00:02:28.690> than<00:02:28.810> that

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
where that goes but other than that

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.690 
where that goes but other than that
that's<00:02:29.200> it<00:02:29.440> I<00:02:29.500> haven't<00:02:29.769> really<00:02:29.980> dug<00:02:30.250> very<00:02:30.459> far

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
that's it I haven't really dug very far

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.229 
that's it I haven't really dug very far
yet<00:02:30.970> but<00:02:31.239> this<00:02:31.390> is<00:02:31.450> as<00:02:31.959> you<00:02:32.739> can<00:02:32.769> see<00:02:33.030> quite<00:02:34.030> a

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
yet but this is as you can see quite a

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:37.729 
yet but this is as you can see quite a
bit<00:02:34.330> larger<00:02:34.780> than<00:02:34.810> my<00:02:35.080> existing<00:02:35.560> ones<00:02:36.420> so

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
bit larger than my existing ones so

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:40.650 
bit larger than my existing ones so
anyway<00:02:38.739> more<00:02:39.310> official<00:02:39.610> one<00:02:39.730> later<00:02:39.910> and<00:02:40.180> my

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
anyway more official one later and my

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.449 
anyway more official one later and my
map<00:02:40.870> will<00:02:41.049> be<00:02:41.140> updated<00:02:41.590> so<00:02:41.860> i'll<00:02:42.130> send<00:02:42.340> you<00:02:42.430> a

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
map will be updated so i'll send you a

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:46.200 
map will be updated so i'll send you a
new<00:02:42.580> link<00:02:42.730> for<00:02:42.940> that<00:02:42.970> too<00:02:43.209> later
