success because all success is is

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.080 
success because all success is is
building<00:02:06.780> blocks<00:02:07.140> one<00:02:07.619> after<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.520> other<00:02:08.550> in

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
building blocks one after the other in

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.320 
building blocks one after the other in
the<00:02:09.750> right<00:02:10.020> order<00:02:11.030> repeated<00:02:12.030> and

the right order repeated and

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.440
