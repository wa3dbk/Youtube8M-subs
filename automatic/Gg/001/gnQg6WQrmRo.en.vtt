possible<00:00:04.110> way<00:00:04.350> to<00:00:04.500> move<00:00:04.799> in<00:00:05.009> Minecraft<00:00:05.520> for

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
possible way to move in Minecraft for

possible way to move in Minecraft for
Xbox<00:00:05.940> and<00:00:06.060> minecraft<00:00:06.779> for<00:00:06.930> Playstations

Xbox and minecraft for Playstations
so<00:00:07.859> I<00:00:08.099> figured<00:00:08.670> every<00:00:09.000> fun<00:00:09.210> exercise<00:00:09.540> to<00:00:09.570> show

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
so I figured every fun exercise to show

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.480 
so I figured every fun exercise to show
you<00:00:09.960> this<00:00:10.110> insane<00:00:10.650> movement<00:00:10.950> speed<00:00:11.130> would<00:00:11.429> be

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
you this insane movement speed would be

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.220 
you this insane movement speed would be
if<00:00:11.639> I<00:00:11.730> took<00:00:11.790> the<00:00:12.030> minecraft<00:00:12.450> Xbox<00:00:12.840> one<00:00:13.080> or

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
if I took the minecraft Xbox one or

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.499 
if I took the minecraft Xbox one or
minecraft<00:00:13.469> ps4<00:00:14.009> large<00:00:14.429> world<00:00:14.759> size<00:00:15.000> which<00:00:15.389> if

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
minecraft ps4 large world size which if

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:16.730 
minecraft ps4 large world size which if
you<00:00:15.570> don't<00:00:15.660> know<00:00:15.750> is<00:00:15.900> five<00:00:16.139> thousand<00:00:16.590> one

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
you don't know is five thousand one

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.439 
you don't know is five thousand one
hundred<00:00:16.890> and<00:00:17.160> twenty<00:00:17.670> blocks<00:00:17.850> across<00:00:18.150> from

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
hundred and twenty blocks across from

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.269 
hundred and twenty blocks across from
end<00:00:18.600> to<00:00:18.660> end<00:00:18.750> and<00:00:19.050> I'd<00:00:19.470> see<00:00:19.650> how<00:00:19.740> fast<00:00:19.980> I<00:00:20.100> get

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
end to end and I'd see how fast I get

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.099 
end to end and I'd see how fast I get
from<00:00:20.490> one<00:00:20.760> literal<00:00:21.240> edge<00:00:21.359> of<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.570> map<00:00:21.720> all<00:00:21.900> the

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
from one literal edge of the map all the

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.840 
from one literal edge of the map all the
way<00:00:22.230> to<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.470> other<00:00:22.560> so<00:00:22.890> that's<00:00:23.279> five<00:00:23.580> point

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
way to the other so that's five point

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.550 
way to the other so that's five point
one<00:00:24.000> kilometers<00:00:24.510> or<00:00:24.660> three<00:00:25.019> point<00:00:25.320> one

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
one kilometers or three point one

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.740 
one kilometers or three point one
something<00:00:26.099> miles<00:00:26.340> which<00:00:27.000> means<00:00:27.029> if<00:00:27.359> I<00:00:27.480> were<00:00:27.599> to

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
something miles which means if I were to

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.359 
something miles which means if I were to
do<00:00:27.900> that<00:00:28.080> on<00:00:28.170> foot<00:00:28.410> it<00:00:28.560> takes<00:00:28.769> me<00:00:28.890> about<00:00:28.920> 20

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
do that on foot it takes me about 20

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.130 
do that on foot it takes me about 20
minutes<00:00:29.400> if<00:00:29.789> I<00:00:30.029> were<00:00:30.150> to<00:00:30.300> sprint<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.750> entire

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
minutes if I were to sprint the entire

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.319 
minutes if I were to sprint the entire
way<00:00:31.380> it's<00:00:31.650> to<00:00:31.800> take<00:00:31.949> close<00:00:32.219> to<00:00:32.399> 15<00:00:32.910> minutes<00:00:33.270> to

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
way it's to take close to 15 minutes to

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:34.610 
way it's to take close to 15 minutes to
go<00:00:33.450> across<00:00:33.600> and<00:00:33.930> I'm<00:00:34.110> gonna<00:00:34.230> show<00:00:34.350> you<00:00:34.440> where

please do like it let me know this took

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.600 
please do like it let me know this took
a<00:00:40.230> while<00:00:40.500> to<00:00:40.530> get<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:40.980> app<00:00:41.100> hop<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:41.520> they've

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
a while to get the app hop and they've

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.430 
a while to get the app hop and they've
sorted<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.090> let's<00:00:42.510> get<00:00:42.660> straight<00:00:42.899> into<00:00:43.020> it<00:00:43.320> so

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
sorted and let's get straight into it so

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.690 
sorted and let's get straight into it so
the<00:00:43.530> first<00:00:43.559> thing<00:00:43.890> you're<00:00:44.100> gonna<00:00:44.309> want<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:44.550> do

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
the first thing you're gonna want to do

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.700 
the first thing you're gonna want to do
is<00:00:44.879> jump<00:00:45.329> into<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.780> never<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.230> never<00:00:46.440> is

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
is jump into the never the never is

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.889 
is jump into the never the never is
scaled<00:00:47.039> a<00:00:47.250> much<00:00:47.670> smaller<00:00:48.000> than<00:00:48.149> real<00:00:48.360> world<00:00:48.570> so

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
scaled a much smaller than real world so

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.090 
scaled a much smaller than real world so
if<00:00:48.960> every<00:00:49.230> one<00:00:49.440> block<00:00:49.620> you<00:00:49.649> traveling<00:00:50.039> the

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
if every one block you traveling the

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.040 
if every one block you traveling the
never<00:00:50.280> it<00:00:50.520> would<00:00:50.670> be<00:00:50.789> large<00:00:51.090> minecraft<00:00:51.809> little

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
never it would be large minecraft little

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.389 
never it would be large minecraft little
one<00:00:52.230> world<00:00:52.440> you're<00:00:52.770> gonna<00:00:52.829> travel<00:00:53.129> eight

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
one world you're gonna travel eight

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.100 
one world you're gonna travel eight
blocks<00:00:53.820> every<00:00:54.210> block<00:00:54.390> is<00:00:54.539> lick<00:00:54.690> one<00:00:54.809> of<00:00:54.930> eight

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
blocks every block is lick one of eight

speed on the Xbox one and ps4 and then

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.609 
speed on the Xbox one and ps4 and then
we've<00:01:09.150> if<00:01:09.360> you've<00:01:09.540> taken<00:01:09.750> top<00:01:10.049> this<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.229> horse

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
we've if you've taken top this a horse

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:11.570 
we've if you've taken top this a horse
which<00:01:10.830> by<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.070> way<00:01:11.130> you<00:01:11.220> can<00:01:11.369> get<00:01:11.460> in<00:01:11.520> the

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
which by the way you can get in the

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.250 
which by the way you can get in the
never<00:01:11.729> by<00:01:11.939> just<00:01:12.119> program<00:01:12.479> proven<00:01:12.810> of<00:01:12.930> bottle

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
never by just program proven of bottle

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.230 
never by just program proven of bottle
then<00:01:13.920> what<00:01:14.070> you<00:01:14.159> can<00:01:14.310> do<00:01:14.490> is<00:01:14.670> you'll<00:01:14.880> be<00:01:15.030> going

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
then what you can do is you'll be going

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.060 
then what you can do is you'll be going
about<00:01:15.450> eight<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:16.049> 15<00:01:16.409> meters<00:01:16.680> depending<00:01:16.799> how

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
about eight to 15 meters depending how

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.980 
about eight to 15 meters depending how
partial<00:01:17.310> horses<00:01:17.850> so<00:01:18.060> that's<00:01:18.420> quite<00:01:18.600> fast<00:01:18.840> by

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
partial horses so that's quite fast by

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.210 
partial horses so that's quite fast by
itself<00:01:19.200> but<00:01:19.380> for<00:01:19.530> a<00:01:19.590> splash<00:01:19.860> potion<00:01:20.159> of

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
itself but for a splash potion of

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.710 
itself but for a splash potion of
swiftness<00:01:20.310> on<00:01:20.670> there<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:20.970> you<00:01:21.270> increase<00:01:21.509> that

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
swiftness on there and you increase that

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.080 
swiftness on there and you increase that
speed<00:01:21.900> by<00:01:22.259> forty<00:01:22.920> percent<00:01:22.950> that's<00:01:23.670> right

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
speed by forty percent that's right

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.520 
speed by forty percent that's right
forty<00:01:24.479> percent<00:01:24.540> I<00:01:24.750> thought<00:01:24.900> that<00:01:25.080> so<00:01:25.259> if<00:01:25.439> we

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
forty percent I thought that so if we

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:26.719 
forty percent I thought that so if we
assume<00:01:25.740> we<00:01:25.830> have<00:01:25.920> an<00:01:26.070> average<00:01:26.189> horse<00:01:26.549> here

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
assume we have an average horse here

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.730 
assume we have an average horse here
which<00:01:26.880> is<00:01:27.030> about<00:01:27.270> ten<00:01:27.570> meters<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:27.930> second<00:01:28.350> then

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
which is about ten meters a second then

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.620 
which is about ten meters a second then
we're<00:01:28.890> now<00:01:29.009> going<00:01:29.220> fourteen<00:01:29.850> meters<00:01:30.000> a<00:01:30.180> second

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
we're now going fourteen meters a second

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.390 
we're now going fourteen meters a second
but<00:01:30.930> because<00:01:31.229> it's<00:01:31.350> also<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.890> nether<00:01:32.100> we're

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
but because it's also the nether we're

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.920 
but because it's also the nether we're
going<00:01:32.670> you<00:01:33.000> know<00:01:33.090> eight<00:01:33.299> times<00:01:33.540> on<00:01:33.689> normal

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
going you know eight times on normal

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.149 
going you know eight times on normal
speed<00:01:34.170> because<00:01:34.439> every<00:01:34.650> block<00:01:34.860> is<00:01:34.979> eight

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
speed because every block is eight

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.069 
speed because every block is eight
blocks<00:01:35.430> so<00:01:35.850> we're<00:01:36.030> going<00:01:36.270> a<00:01:36.360> hundred<00:01:36.689> and

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
blocks so we're going a hundred and

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.649 
blocks so we're going a hundred and
twenty<00:01:37.650> meters<00:01:38.250> a<00:01:38.400> second<00:01:39.090> which<00:01:39.479> is

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
twenty meters a second which is

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.149 
twenty meters a second which is
absolutely<00:01:40.170> ridiculous

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
absolutely ridiculous

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.370 
absolutely ridiculous
and<00:01:41.490> it<00:01:42.360> means<00:01:42.509> that<00:01:42.630> you<00:01:42.810> can<00:01:42.930> travel<00:01:43.170> from

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
and it means that you can travel from

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.410 
and it means that you can travel from

well size you can go from one side back

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.740 
well size you can go from one side back

which<00:01:52.110> is<00:01:52.259> absolutely<00:01:53.130> ridiculous<00:01:54.090> when<00:01:54.420> you

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
which is absolutely ridiculous when you

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:55.670 
which is absolutely ridiculous when you
even<00:01:54.750> begin<00:01:54.960> to<00:01:54.990> think<00:01:55.200> about<00:01:55.290> that<00:01:55.439> one

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
even begin to think about that one

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.709 
even begin to think about that one
because<00:01:56.070> you<00:01:56.430> know<00:01:56.460> that<00:01:56.850> this<00:01:57.030> world<00:01:57.270> size<00:01:57.509> is

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
because you know that this world size is

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.840 
because you know that this world size is
so<00:01:58.049> ridiculously<00:01:58.680> large<00:01:58.890> even<00:01:59.189> creative<00:01:59.729> it

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
so ridiculously large even creative it

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.819 
so ridiculously large even creative it
takes<00:02:00.030> a<00:02:00.119> long<00:02:00.299> time<00:02:00.329> to<00:02:00.600> see<00:02:00.750> and<00:02:00.930> if<00:02:01.409> you<00:02:01.740> use

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
takes a long time to see and if you use

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.200 
takes a long time to see and if you use
this<00:02:01.979> level<00:02:02.280> clever<00:02:02.460> little<00:02:02.579> movement<00:02:02.939> speed

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
this level clever little movement speed

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.999 
this level clever little movement speed
you<00:02:03.570> know<00:02:03.659> combination<00:02:04.200> of<00:02:04.290> things<00:02:04.500> then<00:02:04.920> you

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
you know combination of things then you

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.590 
you know combination of things then you
can<00:02:05.189> get<00:02:05.369> there<00:02:05.579> in<00:02:05.759> less<00:02:06.000> than<00:02:06.210> a<00:02:06.329> minute

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
can get there in less than a minute

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.930 
can get there in less than a minute
that's<00:02:07.590> just<00:02:07.860> insane<00:02:08.190> so<00:02:08.399> here<00:02:08.520> you<00:02:08.610> can<00:02:08.729> see

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
that's just insane so here you can see

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.639 
that's just insane so here you can see
just<00:02:09.239> in<00:02:09.660> case<00:02:09.840> you<00:02:09.929> didn't<00:02:10.080> believe<00:02:10.259> that<00:02:10.289> I

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
just in case you didn't believe that I

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.040
