00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
couple of top coats and that's it well I

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:51.749 
couple of top coats and that's it well I
would<00:01:50.619> have<00:01:50.710> been<00:01:50.799> overboard<00:01:51.220> and<00:01:51.430> modified

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:51.759 
would have been overboard and modified

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:54.149 
would have been overboard and modified
to<00:01:51.790> face<00:01:52.090> in<00:01:52.240> bricks<00:01:52.450> -<00:01:52.689> I<00:01:52.900> think<00:01:53.619> it<00:01:53.890> gives<00:01:54.070> a

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
to face in bricks - I think it gives a

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:55.270 
to face in bricks - I think it gives a
better<00:01:54.280> look

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
better look

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.050

construction<00:05:34.880> I<00:05:35.950> will<00:05:36.950> apply<00:05:37.160> an<00:05:37.370> aspect<00:05:37.670> of

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:37.820

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:39.880 
construction I will apply an aspect of
interpretation<00:05:38.600> to<00:05:38.780> the<00:05:38.900> ramp<00:05:39.110> scene<00:05:39.320> and

interpretation to the ramp scene and

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:41.740
