00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:13.070 

so<00:00:11.969> I've<00:00:12.059> got<00:00:12.210> the<00:00:12.330> motor<00:00:12.509> put<00:00:12.750> back<00:00:12.900> together

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
so I've got the motor put back together

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.230 
so I've got the motor put back together
and<00:00:13.530> I've<00:00:14.190> loaded<00:00:14.490> it<00:00:14.670> in<00:00:14.790> the<00:00:14.880> truck<00:00:15.059> it's

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
and I've loaded it in the truck it's

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.740 
and I've loaded it in the truck it's
pretty<00:00:15.450> heavy<00:00:15.660> it's<00:00:17.330> 120<00:00:18.330> pounds<00:00:18.660> or

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
pretty heavy it's 120 pounds or

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:19.910 
pretty heavy it's 120 pounds or
something<00:00:18.869> like<00:00:19.170> that<00:00:19.289> it's<00:00:19.439> pretty<00:00:19.650> much<00:00:19.740> as

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
something like that it's pretty much as

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.010 
something like that it's pretty much as
much<00:00:20.130> as<00:00:20.400> I<00:00:20.520> can<00:00:20.580> lift<00:00:20.939> but<00:00:21.689> I've<00:00:21.779> got<00:00:21.900> it

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
much as I can lift but I've got it

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.029 
much as I can lift but I've got it
loaded<00:00:22.289> in<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.500> truck

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
loaded in the truck

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.939 
loaded in the truck
so<00:00:23.939> that's<00:00:24.869> what<00:00:25.140> it<00:00:25.230> looks<00:00:25.410> like<00:00:25.590> when<00:00:25.830> it's

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
so that's what it looks like when it's

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.689 
so that's what it looks like when it's
put<00:00:26.130> back<00:00:26.160> together<00:00:26.990> you<00:00:27.990> can<00:00:28.140> see<00:00:28.349> here<00:00:28.699> the

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
put back together you can see here the

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.639 
put back together you can see here the
drive<00:00:30.000> shaft<00:00:30.710> the<00:00:31.710> motor<00:00:31.890> end<00:00:32.070> cap<00:00:32.870> the<00:00:33.870> main

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
drive shaft the motor end cap the main

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.970 
drive shaft the motor end cap the main
section<00:00:35.250> of<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.399> motor<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:36.170> cami<00:00:37.170> nadir<00:00:37.530> cam

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
section of the motor the cami nadir cam

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.530 
section of the motor the cami nadir cam
you<00:00:38.129> a<00:00:38.420> commutator<00:00:39.420> end<00:00:39.870> end<00:00:40.530> cap<00:00:41.520> and<00:00:41.820> tail

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
you a commutator end end cap and tail

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.610 
you a commutator end end cap and tail
shaft<00:00:44.510> so<00:00:45.510> now<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.690> important<00:00:46.320> number<00:00:46.590> to

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
shaft so now the important number to

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.340 
shaft so now the important number to
know<00:00:46.739> is<00:00:47.160> how<00:00:47.820> far<00:00:48.059> that<00:00:48.270> driveshaft<00:00:48.899> sticks

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
know is how far that driveshaft sticks

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.229 
know is how far that driveshaft sticks
out<00:00:49.559> from<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.010> faceplate<00:00:50.250> so<00:00:50.789> we'll<00:00:50.940> have<00:00:51.120> to

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
out from the faceplate so we'll have to

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.840 
out from the faceplate so we'll have to
take<00:00:51.420> a<00:00:51.449> measurement<00:00:51.840> here<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:53.340> see<00:00:53.489> exactly

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
take a measurement here to see exactly

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.389 
take a measurement here to see exactly
how<00:00:54.059> long<00:00:54.510> it<00:00:54.780> is<00:00:54.809> so<00:00:55.649> that<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.920> motor<00:00:56.100> can<00:00:56.370> be

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
how long it is so that the motor can be

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.279 
how long it is so that the motor can be
spaced<00:00:56.850> out<00:00:57.059> appropriately<00:00:57.870> from<00:00:58.109> the

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
spaced out appropriately from the

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.369 
spaced out appropriately from the
transmission<00:00:59.719> now<00:01:00.719> another<00:01:00.960> thing<00:01:01.109> about

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
transmission now another thing about

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.110 
transmission now another thing about
this<00:01:01.649> motor<00:01:01.890> is<00:01:02.010> that<00:01:02.070> it's<00:01:02.370> actually<00:01:02.609> pretty

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
this motor is that it's actually pretty

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.479 
this motor is that it's actually pretty
big<00:01:03.449> so<00:01:03.780> something<00:01:04.140> that's<00:01:04.170> important<00:01:04.769> is<00:01:05.040> to

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
big so something that's important is to

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.429 
big so something that's important is to
make<00:01:05.670> sure<00:01:05.820> that<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.360> motor<00:01:06.720> will<00:01:06.990> actually

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
make sure that the motor will actually

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.670 
make sure that the motor will actually
fit<00:01:07.740> into<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.400> Metro<00:01:08.790> so<00:01:09.540> let's<00:01:10.320> take<00:01:10.530> some

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
fit into the Metro so let's take some

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.000 
fit into the Metro so let's take some
measurements<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:11.280> really<00:01:11.970> hope<00:01:12.740> so<00:01:13.740> here's

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
measurements and really hope so here's

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.320 
measurements and really hope so here's
the<00:01:14.159> motor<00:01:14.340> and<00:01:14.580> where<00:01:14.729> we're<00:01:14.880> going<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:15.210> be

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
the motor and where we're going to be

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.999 
the motor and where we're going to be
measuring<00:01:15.540> from<00:01:15.780> is<00:01:16.140> this<00:01:16.380> surface<00:01:16.590> right

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
measuring from is this surface right

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.160 
measuring from is this surface right
here<00:01:17.369> that's<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.909> smooth<00:01:18.180> side<00:01:18.479> that<00:01:18.869> the

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
here that's the smooth side that the

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.050 
here that's the smooth side that the
motor<00:01:19.470> is<00:01:19.560> going<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:19.950> mount<00:01:20.070> directly<00:01:20.460> into

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
motor is going to mount directly into

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.999 
motor is going to mount directly into
from<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.450> adapter<00:01:21.900> plate<00:01:22.049> so<00:01:22.409> right<00:01:22.619> here

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
from the adapter plate so right here

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.010 
from the adapter plate so right here
that's<00:01:23.880> where<00:01:24.150> we're<00:01:24.270> gonna<00:01:24.330> take<00:01:24.600> our<00:01:24.780> start

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
that's where we're gonna take our start

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.289 
that's where we're gonna take our start
measurement<00:01:25.470> from<00:01:25.680> now<00:01:26.400> as<00:01:26.549> I<00:01:26.670> pull<00:01:26.909> this<00:01:27.090> out

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
measurement from now as I pull this out

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.010 
measurement from now as I pull this out
I<00:01:27.570> can<00:01:27.720> see<00:01:27.930> it's<00:01:28.140> just<00:01:29.090> just<00:01:30.090> under<00:01:30.360> 14<00:01:30.780> inches

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
I can see it's just just under 14 inches

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.260 
I can see it's just just under 14 inches
to<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.290> end<00:01:31.439> of<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.680> cap<00:01:31.890> it's<00:01:32.579> about<00:01:32.820> 15

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
to the end of the cap it's about 15

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.120 
to the end of the cap it's about 15
inches<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.810> end<00:01:33.990> of<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.259> cast-iron<00:01:34.710> piece

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
inches to the end of the cast-iron piece

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.319 
inches to the end of the cast-iron piece
here<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:36.180> it's<00:01:37.140> right<00:01:37.979> about<00:01:38.189> 18<00:01:38.850> inches<00:01:39.060> to

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
here and it's right about 18 inches to

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.950 
here and it's right about 18 inches to
the<00:01:39.540> very<00:01:39.869> end<00:01:40.140> of<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.470> tail<00:01:40.650> shaft<00:01:40.920> over<00:01:41.220> here

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
the very end of the tail shaft over here

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.330 
the very end of the tail shaft over here
now<00:01:42.960> here's<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.409> engine<00:01:43.680> compartment<00:01:44.220> of<00:01:44.280> the

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
now here's the engine compartment of the

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.700 
now here's the engine compartment of the
Geo<00:01:44.579> Metro<00:01:44.820> so<00:01:45.600> let's<00:01:46.079> take<00:01:46.259> a<00:01:46.290> look<00:01:46.439> inside

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
Geo Metro so let's take a look inside

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.149 
Geo Metro so let's take a look inside
see<00:01:46.950> how<00:01:47.009> those<00:01:47.189> measurements<00:01:47.700> work<00:01:47.850> out<00:01:49.159> okay

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
see how those measurements work out okay

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.149 
see how those measurements work out okay
so<00:01:50.189> now<00:01:50.430> what<00:01:50.820> we<00:01:51.000> have<00:01:51.030> here<00:01:51.570> is<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:52.159> the

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
so now what we have here is the the

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.980 
so now what we have here is the the
engine<00:01:53.610> in<00:01:53.759> this<00:01:53.850> car<00:01:53.909> was<00:01:54.360> originally<00:01:54.509> right

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
engine in this car was originally right

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.440 
engine in this car was originally right
about<00:01:55.229> here<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:56.100> transmission<00:01:56.579> was<00:01:57.149> over

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
about here and the transmission was over

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.750 
about here and the transmission was over
here<00:01:58.130> and<00:01:59.130> these<00:01:59.700> are<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:01.079> chef

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:01.760 
here and these are the the chef

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.920 
here and these are the the chef
that<00:02:02.120> connect<00:02:02.420> the<00:02:02.510> transmission<00:02:03.230> into<00:02:03.890> the

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
that connect the transmission into the

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
that connect the transmission into the
onto<00:02:05.930> the<00:02:06.050> wheels<00:02:06.230> it's<00:02:06.560> front-wheel<00:02:06.830> drive

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
onto the wheels it's front-wheel drive

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.820 
onto the wheels it's front-wheel drive
so<00:02:07.430> I<00:02:08.150> know<00:02:08.450> that<00:02:08.780> the<00:02:08.930> front<00:02:09.229> end<00:02:09.440> of<00:02:09.740> the

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
so I know that the front end of the

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.280 
so I know that the front end of the
transmission<00:02:10.490> was<00:02:10.700> right<00:02:10.880> about<00:02:11.090> here<00:02:11.480> and<00:02:11.660> it

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
transmission was right about here and it

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.340 
transmission was right about here and it
faced<00:02:12.560> this<00:02:12.950> way<00:02:13.160> the<00:02:13.640> engine<00:02:13.790> was<00:02:14.060> here<00:02:14.360> so<00:02:15.320> I

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
faced this way the engine was here so I

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.020 
faced this way the engine was here so I
need<00:02:15.620> to<00:02:15.710> measure<00:02:15.890> it<00:02:16.040> from<00:02:16.220> roughly<00:02:16.520> here

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
need to measure it from roughly here

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.430 
need to measure it from roughly here
this<00:02:17.810> way<00:02:18.050> and<00:02:18.350> I<00:02:18.620> found<00:02:18.890> that<00:02:19.070> that's<00:02:19.160> about

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
this way and I found that that's about

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.680 
this way and I found that that's about
16<00:02:21.440> inches<00:02:21.560> to<00:02:21.800> here<00:02:22.220> and<00:02:22.400> 15<00:02:23.000> inches<00:02:23.240> to<00:02:23.420> here

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
16 inches to here and 15 inches to here

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.350 
16 inches to here and 15 inches to here
now<00:02:24.020> this<00:02:24.200> is<00:02:24.380> hollow<00:02:24.710> so<00:02:25.220> if<00:02:25.760> I<00:02:25.880> had<00:02:26.120> to<00:02:26.330> I

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
now this is hollow so if I had to I

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.730 
now this is hollow so if I had to I
could<00:02:26.600> potentially<00:02:26.870> drill<00:02:27.380> a<00:02:27.410> hole<00:02:27.710> right

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
could potentially drill a hole right

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.300 
could potentially drill a hole right
here<00:02:28.060> otherwise<00:02:29.060> they<00:02:29.270> could<00:02:29.450> cut<00:02:29.780> me<00:02:29.960> up<00:02:30.310> that

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
here otherwise they could cut me up that

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.450 
here otherwise they could cut me up that
tail<00:02:31.640> shaft<00:02:32.030> off<00:02:32.450> of<00:02:32.720> the<00:02:32.870> motor<00:02:33.080> as<00:02:33.290> well<00:02:33.460> to

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:34.460 
tail shaft off of the motor as well to

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.190 
tail shaft off of the motor as well to
make<00:02:34.610> it<00:02:34.670> fit<00:02:35.000> but<00:02:35.270> as<00:02:35.420> it<00:02:35.600> is<00:02:35.690> it<00:02:35.870> looks<00:02:36.050> like

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
make it fit but as it is it looks like

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.780 
make it fit but as it is it looks like
it's<00:02:36.320> probably<00:02:36.500> gonna<00:02:36.770> be<00:02:36.860> really<00:02:37.370> close<00:02:37.580> I

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
it's probably gonna be really close I

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:38.680 
it's probably gonna be really close I
mean<00:02:37.850> they're<00:02:38.060> gonna<00:02:38.150> have<00:02:38.300> to<00:02:38.390> drill<00:02:38.600> a<00:02:38.630> hole

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
mean they're gonna have to drill a hole

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:44.020 
mean they're gonna have to drill a hole
or<00:02:39.140> cut<00:02:39.320> that<00:02:39.440> tail<00:02:39.680> shaft<00:02:39.920> off<00:02:42.730> okay<00:02:43.730> I<00:02:43.760> just

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
or cut that tail shaft off okay I just

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.480 
or cut that tail shaft off okay I just
called<00:02:44.210> up<00:02:44.330> a<00:02:44.390> machinist<00:02:44.960> he's<00:02:45.710> available<00:02:45.980> and

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.490 
called up a machinist he's available and

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:48.160 
called up a machinist he's available and
I'm<00:02:46.970> gonna<00:02:47.120> go<00:02:47.240> over<00:02:47.360> there<00:02:47.630> with<00:02:47.870> the<00:02:48.020> motor

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
I'm gonna go over there with the motor

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.020 
I'm gonna go over there with the motor
and<00:02:48.500> we're<00:02:48.680> going<00:02:48.920> to<00:02:48.950> take<00:02:49.490> the<00:02:49.640> measurement

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
and we're going to take the measurement

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.790 
and we're going to take the measurement
for<00:02:50.240> the<00:02:50.360> distance<00:02:51.110> between<00:02:51.290> the<00:02:51.530> motor<00:02:51.680> and

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
for the distance between the motor and

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.050 
for the distance between the motor and
the<00:02:51.920> adapter<00:02:52.370> plate<00:02:52.580> so<00:02:52.730> we<00:02:52.760> can<00:02:52.940> make

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
the adapter plate so we can make

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.260 
the adapter plate so we can make
everything<00:02:53.420> the<00:02:53.510> right<00:02:53.600> length<00:02:54.490> so<00:02:55.490> over<00:02:56.150> at

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270 
everything the right length so over at

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:58.630 
everything the right length so over at
the<00:02:56.390> machinist<00:02:56.930> we<00:02:57.260> put<00:02:58.010> the<00:02:58.130> adapter<00:02:58.340> plate

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
the machinist we put the adapter plate

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.880 
the machinist we put the adapter plate
onto<00:02:58.970> the<00:02:59.209> motor<00:02:59.450> then<00:03:00.110> we<00:03:00.260> stood<00:03:00.530> the<00:03:00.680> motor

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
onto the motor then we stood the motor

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.130 
onto the motor then we stood the motor
up<00:03:01.130> on<00:03:01.430> end<00:03:01.700> and<00:03:02.000> set<00:03:02.300> the<00:03:02.420> transmission<00:03:03.020> on

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
up on end and set the transmission on

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.130 
up on end and set the transmission on
top<00:03:03.380> of<00:03:03.590> it<00:03:03.709> to<00:03:03.980> see<00:03:04.160> how<00:03:04.310> the<00:03:04.690> the<00:03:05.690> two<00:03:05.840> shafts

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
top of it to see how the the two shafts

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:07.650 
top of it to see how the the two shafts
would<00:03:06.440> line<00:03:06.620> up<00:03:06.770> into<00:03:06.920> how<00:03:07.040> much<00:03:07.190> space

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
would line up into how much space

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.260 
would line up into how much space
there's<00:03:08.660> going<00:03:08.959> to<00:03:09.050> be<00:03:09.170> between<00:03:09.560> them<00:03:10.030> as<00:03:11.030> you

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:11.270 
there's going to be between them as you

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:15.490 
there's going to be between them as you
can<00:03:11.300> see<00:03:11.660> right<00:03:12.380> now<00:03:12.590> the<00:03:13.330> shafts<00:03:14.330> overlap<00:03:14.959> we

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
can see right now the shafts overlap we

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.380 
can see right now the shafts overlap we
have<00:03:15.650> too<00:03:15.860> much<00:03:16.010> space<00:03:16.340> what<00:03:16.730> that<00:03:16.910> space<00:03:17.180> you

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
have too much space what that space you

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.000 
have too much space what that space you
see<00:03:17.570> there<00:03:17.750> is<00:03:17.870> how<00:03:18.110> far<00:03:18.440> we<00:03:18.620> would<00:03:18.739> have<00:03:18.860> to

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
see there is how far we would have to

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:20.590 
see there is how far we would have to
space<00:03:19.250> the<00:03:19.489> motor<00:03:19.730> out<00:03:19.940> from<00:03:20.269> the<00:03:20.390> adapter

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
space the motor out from the adapter

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.110 
space the motor out from the adapter
plate<00:03:21.050> and<00:03:21.440> we<00:03:22.070> decided<00:03:22.400> what<00:03:22.670> would<00:03:22.790> look<00:03:22.940> the

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
plate and we decided what would look the

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.410 
plate and we decided what would look the
best<00:03:23.300> beef<00:03:23.810> sturdy<00:03:24.380> and<00:03:24.940> work<00:03:25.940> well<00:03:26.120> all

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
best beef sturdy and work well all

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.440 
best beef sturdy and work well all
around<00:03:26.720> is<00:03:26.959> to<00:03:27.140> shorten<00:03:27.560> the<00:03:27.680> shafts<00:03:28.300> to<00:03:29.300> make

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
around is to shorten the shafts to make

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.570 
around is to shorten the shafts to make
them<00:03:29.630> fit<00:03:30.040> without<00:03:31.040> having<00:03:31.370> to<00:03:31.430> use<00:03:31.550> any

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:31.580 
them fit without having to use any

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:49.100 
them fit without having to use any
spacers<00:03:32.300> otherwise

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:54.809 

that's<00:03:50.110> it<00:03:51.180> that<00:03:52.180> was<00:03:52.270> fast

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:54.819 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:59.550 

whoo<00:03:55.420> still<00:03:56.319> smokin<00:03:57.510> do<00:03:58.510> not<00:03:58.750> touch<00:03:59.049> that<00:03:59.349> with

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
whoo still smokin do not touch that with

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.699 
whoo still smokin do not touch that with
fingers<00:04:00.060> the<00:04:01.060> driveshaft<00:04:01.750> on<00:04:02.230> the<00:04:02.349> motor<00:04:02.500> is<00:04:02.680> a

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
fingers the driveshaft on the motor is a

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:04.649 
fingers the driveshaft on the motor is a
little<00:04:03.010> bit<00:04:03.129> too<00:04:03.400> long<00:04:03.700> for<00:04:04.000> what<00:04:04.150> we<00:04:04.269> need<00:04:04.450> for

00:04:04.649 --> 00:04:04.659 
little bit too long for what we need for

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:05.910 
little bit too long for what we need for
it<00:04:04.719> too<00:04:04.900> a<00:04:04.930> couple<00:04:05.260> up<00:04:05.500> against<00:04:05.859> the

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
it too a couple up against the

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.860 
it too a couple up against the
transmission<00:04:06.459> so<00:04:06.969> we're<00:04:07.090> gonna<00:04:07.180> take<00:04:07.840> a

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
transmission so we're gonna take a

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.089 
transmission so we're gonna take a
little<00:04:08.049> bit<00:04:08.230> of<00:04:08.379> it<00:04:08.620> off

00:04:09.089 --> 00:04:09.099 
little bit of it off

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:12.539 
little bit of it off
Jim<00:04:09.700> how<00:04:09.879> much<00:04:10.000> are<00:04:10.150> we<00:04:10.180> taking<00:04:10.450> off<00:04:10.540> there<00:04:11.549> I'm

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:12.549 
Jim how much are we taking off there I'm

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:14.190 
Jim how much are we taking off there I'm
gonna<00:04:12.730> take<00:04:12.939> about<00:04:13.030> half<00:04:13.359> an<00:04:13.510> inch<00:04:13.629> of<00:04:13.900> it<00:04:14.079> off

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
gonna take about half an inch of it off

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:31.529 
gonna take about half an inch of it off
with<00:04:14.439> this<00:04:14.620> uh<00:04:14.650> big<00:04:15.340> saw<00:04:15.579> we<00:04:15.909> got<00:04:16.090> down<00:04:16.269> here
