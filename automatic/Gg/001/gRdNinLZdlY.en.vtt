00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
hey guys so when you are restoring a

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.249 
hey guys so when you are restoring a
motorcycle<00:00:05.629> undoubtedly<00:00:06.629> the<00:00:06.960> biggest

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
motorcycle undoubtedly the biggest

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.320 
motorcycle undoubtedly the biggest
project<00:00:07.740> most<00:00:08.069> time-consuming<00:00:08.670> is<00:00:09.030> going<00:00:09.270> to

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
project most time-consuming is going to

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.049 
project most time-consuming is going to
be<00:00:09.389> the<00:00:09.480> engine<00:00:09.840> and<00:00:10.100> that's<00:00:11.100> only<00:00:11.730> going<00:00:12.000> to

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
be the engine and that's only going to

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.359 
be the engine and that's only going to
be<00:00:12.119> worse<00:00:12.389> if<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:13.139> Pistons<00:00:13.529> are<00:00:13.680> seized<00:00:13.920> so

00:00:14.359 --> 00:00:14.369 
be worse if the Pistons are seized so

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:16.490 
be worse if the Pistons are seized so
this<00:00:14.549> is<00:00:14.779> this<00:00:15.779> video<00:00:15.990> I'm<00:00:16.199> just<00:00:16.230> going<00:00:16.410> to

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
this is this video I'm just going to

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.900 
this is this video I'm just going to
talk<00:00:16.650> about<00:00:16.859> a<00:00:16.890> few<00:00:17.130> of<00:00:17.190> the<00:00:17.340> different<00:00:17.640> ways

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
talk about a few of the different ways

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.560 
talk about a few of the different ways
you<00:00:18.330> can<00:00:18.449> try<00:00:18.720> to<00:00:18.779> uncie's<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.980> Pistons<00:00:20.570> in

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
you can try to uncie's the Pistons in

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.099 
you can try to uncie's the Pistons in
this<00:00:21.749> engine<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.289> Pistons<00:00:22.650> are<00:00:22.800> seized<00:00:24.109> so

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
this engine the Pistons are seized so

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.710 
this engine the Pistons are seized so
it's<00:00:25.320> going<00:00:25.410> to<00:00:25.470> be<00:00:25.589> a<00:00:25.619> good<00:00:26.419> engine<00:00:27.419> to<00:00:27.539> show

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
it's going to be a good engine to show

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.589 
it's going to be a good engine to show
to<00:00:27.779> y'all<00:00:28.019> on<00:00:28.789> the<00:00:29.789> first<00:00:30.029> thing<00:00:30.179> I<00:00:30.300> like<00:00:30.449> to

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
to y'all on the first thing I like to

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.580 
to y'all on the first thing I like to
try<00:00:30.810> is<00:00:31.169> just<00:00:32.070> putting<00:00:32.579> some<00:00:32.990> wd-40<00:00:33.990> or<00:00:34.110> PB

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
try is just putting some wd-40 or PB

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.270 
try is just putting some wd-40 or PB
Blaster<00:00:35.100> in<00:00:35.310> each<00:00:36.030> of<00:00:36.240> the<00:00:36.680> cylinders<00:00:37.680> and

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
Blaster in each of the cylinders and

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.770 
Blaster in each of the cylinders and
letting<00:00:38.550> that<00:00:38.670> soak<00:00:38.940> for<00:00:39.270> a<00:00:39.300> while<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:39.960> then

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
letting that soak for a while and then

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.750 
letting that soak for a while and then
coming<00:00:42.780> back<00:00:42.810> and<00:00:43.230> trying<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:44.130> see<00:00:44.370> if<00:00:44.550> they'll

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
coming back and trying to see if they'll

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.420 
coming back and trying to see if they'll
move<00:00:44.910> it<00:00:45.060> all<00:00:45.180> also<00:00:45.630> you<00:00:45.690> can<00:00:45.990> use<00:00:46.430> Marvel

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
move it all also you can use Marvel

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.650 
move it all also you can use Marvel
Mystery<00:00:47.730> Oil<00:00:49.070> to<00:00:50.070> let<00:00:50.250> it<00:00:50.370> soak<00:00:50.580> and<00:00:50.940> then<00:00:51.420> once

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
Mystery Oil to let it soak and then once

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.110 
Mystery Oil to let it soak and then once
you've<00:00:51.840> let<00:00:51.990> it<00:00:52.020> soak<00:00:52.290> for<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:52.650> while<00:00:55.850> how<00:00:56.850> a

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
you've let it soak for a while how a

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.540 
you've let it soak for a while how a
good<00:00:57.360> way<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.720> try<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.140> break<00:00:59.010> them<00:00:59.130> loose<00:00:59.280> is

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
good way to try to break them loose is

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.329 
good way to try to break them loose is
to<00:00:59.700> put<00:00:59.880> one<00:00:59.910> hammer<00:01:00.330> on<00:01:01.140> it<00:01:01.200> and<00:01:01.950> then<00:01:04.309> try<00:01:05.309> to

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
to put one hammer on it and then try to

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.520 
to put one hammer on it and then try to
just<00:01:05.729> force<00:01:05.999> it<00:01:06.179> down<00:01:06.359> but<00:01:06.749> that's<00:01:07.289> not

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
just force it down but that's not

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.880 
just force it down but that's not
working<00:01:07.710> in<00:01:07.979> this<00:01:08.100> case<00:01:08.899> so<00:01:09.899> after<00:01:10.649> that

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
working in this case so after that

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.219 
working in this case so after that
that's<00:01:11.310> not<00:01:12.060> working

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
that's not working

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:19.489 
that's not working
the<00:01:13.740> next<00:01:14.539> thing<00:01:15.539> to<00:01:15.570> try<00:01:16.049> is<00:01:18.170> trying<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.259> heat

00:01:19.489 --> 00:01:19.499 
the next thing to try is trying to heat

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:23.389 
the next thing to try is trying to heat
up<00:01:19.729> the<00:01:20.840> cylinder<00:01:21.840> wall<00:01:22.140> in<00:01:22.469> the<00:01:23.069> hopes<00:01:23.249> that

00:01:23.389 --> 00:01:23.399 
up the cylinder wall in the hopes that

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:27.109 
up the cylinder wall in the hopes that
it'll<00:01:23.700> expand<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.630> then<00:01:25.819> it<00:01:26.819> will<00:01:26.939> break

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
it'll expand and then it will break

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.870 
it'll expand and then it will break
apart<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.719> seal<00:01:28.219> to<00:01:29.219> do<00:01:29.369> that<00:01:29.549> you're<00:01:29.759> going

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
apart the seal to do that you're going

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:36.129 
apart the seal to do that you're going
to<00:01:29.909> need<00:01:30.149> a<00:01:31.460> blowtorch<00:01:32.460> or<00:01:34.670> some<00:01:35.670> sort<00:01:35.939> of

00:01:36.129 --> 00:01:36.139 
to need a blowtorch or some sort of

00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:40.520 
to need a blowtorch or some sort of
flame<00:01:38.840> obviously<00:01:39.840> have<00:01:40.139> to<00:01:40.229> be<00:01:40.289> really

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
flame obviously have to be really

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.739 
flame obviously have to be really
careful<00:01:40.679> when<00:01:40.950> you're<00:01:41.039> using<00:01:41.069> one<00:01:41.460> but<00:01:42.149> use<00:01:42.600> it

00:01:42.739 --> 00:01:42.749 
careful when you're using one but use it

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:46.309 
careful when you're using one but use it
properly<00:01:42.990> it<00:01:43.609> shouldn't<00:01:44.609> be<00:01:44.789> too<00:01:45.319> dangerous

00:01:46.309 --> 00:01:46.319 
properly it shouldn't be too dangerous

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:50.419 
properly it shouldn't be too dangerous
so<00:01:48.139> whenever<00:01:49.139> you're<00:01:49.409> going<00:01:49.560> to<00:01:49.709> use<00:01:50.009> a

00:01:50.419 --> 00:01:50.429 
so whenever you're going to use a

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:52.609 
so whenever you're going to use a
blowtorch<00:01:51.060> you<00:01:51.359> always<00:01:51.600> want<00:01:51.749> to<00:01:51.810> have<00:01:52.109> gloves

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
blowtorch you always want to have gloves

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.359 
blowtorch you always want to have gloves
on<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:53.539> and<00:01:54.539> gloves<00:01:54.840> that<00:01:54.929> at<00:01:55.709> least<00:01:56.009> have

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
on and and gloves that at least have

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.779 
on and and gloves that at least have
some<00:01:56.670> sort<00:01:57.209> of<00:01:57.270> heat<00:01:57.450> protection<00:01:57.929> and<00:01:58.139> then<00:01:59.130> I

00:01:59.779 --> 00:01:59.789 
some sort of heat protection and then I

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:01.840 
some sort of heat protection and then I
was<00:02:00.329> like<00:02:00.420> to<00:02:00.539> wear<00:02:00.630> goggles<00:02:00.749> just<00:02:01.259> in<00:02:01.499> case

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
was like to wear goggles just in case

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.859 
was like to wear goggles just in case
something<00:02:02.850> were<00:02:03.029> to<00:02:03.149> fly<00:02:03.329> up<00:02:03.539> and

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:08.169 

so<00:02:06.409> you<00:02:06.679> can<00:02:06.799> protect<00:02:06.979> your<00:02:07.159> eyes<00:02:07.310> every

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
so you can protect your eyes every

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.180 
so you can protect your eyes every
blowtorch<00:02:08.599> is<00:02:08.780> different<00:02:09.200> but<00:02:09.440> this<00:02:09.709> one<00:02:09.920> has

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
blowtorch is different but this one has

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.820 
blowtorch is different but this one has
the<00:02:10.489> sparker<00:02:11.200> already<00:02:12.200> on<00:02:12.290> top<00:02:12.500> of<00:02:12.709> it

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
the sparker already on top of it

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.059 
the sparker already on top of it
otherwise<00:02:13.190> you<00:02:13.550> just<00:02:13.700> need<00:02:13.849> a<00:02:14.680> lighter<00:02:15.680> or

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
otherwise you just need a lighter or

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:20.350 
otherwise you just need a lighter or
something<00:02:16.519> to<00:02:18.250> provide<00:02:19.250> the<00:02:19.400> spark<00:02:19.640> but<00:02:20.120> you

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
something to provide the spark but you

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.539 
something to provide the spark but you
just<00:02:20.569> twist<00:02:21.410> it<00:02:21.560> until<00:02:21.769> you<00:02:22.040> hear<00:02:22.310> a<00:02:22.340> little

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:22.549 
just twist it until you hear a little

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:28.420 
just twist it until you hear a little
hissing<00:02:23.000> noise<00:02:26.349> and<00:02:27.349> then<00:02:27.530> hit<00:02:27.860> the<00:02:27.980> sparker

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
hissing noise and then hit the sparker

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.059 
hissing noise and then hit the sparker
and<00:02:29.060> you<00:02:30.049> should<00:02:30.170> be<00:02:30.260> good<00:02:30.349> to<00:02:30.410> go<00:02:30.530> and<00:02:30.920> then

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
and you should be good to go and then

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:33.640 
and you should be good to go and then
just<00:02:31.099> what<00:02:32.000> we're<00:02:32.150> going<00:02:32.269> to<00:02:32.330> do<00:02:32.450> is<00:02:32.720> put<00:02:33.500> this

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
just what we're going to do is put this

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.089 
just what we're going to do is put this
flame<00:02:34.040> on<00:02:34.810> the<00:02:35.810> outside<00:02:36.200> wall<00:02:36.379> the<00:02:36.680> cylinder

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:37.099 
flame on the outside wall the cylinder

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:46.270 
flame on the outside wall the cylinder
to<00:02:37.459> try<00:02:37.640> to<00:02:37.700> expand<00:02:38.090> it<00:02:38.299> and<00:02:45.040> then<00:02:46.040> we're<00:02:46.190> going

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
to try to expand it and then we're going

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.630 
to try to expand it and then we're going
to<00:02:46.340> do<00:02:46.430> the<00:02:46.549> same<00:02:46.790> on<00:02:47.030> the<00:02:47.120> other<00:02:47.150> side

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.790 

once<00:02:52.270> you've<00:02:52.390> heated<00:02:52.540> up<00:02:52.720> both<00:02:52.900> sides<00:02:53.140> you<00:02:53.620> can

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
once you've heated up both sides you can

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.160 
once you've heated up both sides you can
use<00:02:54.790> get<00:02:55.150> a<00:02:55.180> rubber<00:02:55.450> mallet<00:02:55.720> and<00:02:56.080> try<00:02:56.410> to<00:02:56.640> hit

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
use get a rubber mallet and try to hit

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.220 
use get a rubber mallet and try to hit
the<00:02:59.170> sides<00:02:59.470> of<00:02:59.800> it<00:02:59.890> to<00:03:00.070> try<00:03:00.310> to<00:03:00.690> break<00:03:01.690> the<00:03:01.750> seal

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
the sides of it to try to break the seal

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:10.920 
the sides of it to try to break the seal
loose<00:03:07.410> also<00:03:08.410> you<00:03:08.470> can<00:03:08.740> go<00:03:08.890> back<00:03:09.130> and<00:03:09.870> try<00:03:10.870> this

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
loose also you can go back and try this

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:21.540 
loose also you can go back and try this
will<00:03:11.380> work<00:03:19.380> this<00:03:20.380> is<00:03:20.560> the<00:03:20.710> kind<00:03:20.860> of<00:03:20.920> process<00:03:21.400> we

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:21.550 
will work this is the kind of process we

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:22.980 
will work this is the kind of process we
just<00:03:21.580> kind<00:03:21.850> of<00:03:21.910> have<00:03:22.030> to<00:03:22.150> keep<00:03:22.330> repeating<00:03:22.720> it

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:22.990 
just kind of have to keep repeating it

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:26.160 
just kind of have to keep repeating it
until<00:03:23.850> you<00:03:24.850> get<00:03:25.000> it<00:03:25.090> to<00:03:25.150> work<00:03:25.300> because<00:03:25.900> there's

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
until you get it to work because there's

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:31.199 
until you get it to work because there's
no<00:03:26.520> no<00:03:27.520> shortcuts<00:03:28.060> unfortunately<00:03:28.870> so<00:03:30.209> just

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
no no shortcuts unfortunately so just

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.260 
no no shortcuts unfortunately so just
keep<00:03:31.450> repeating<00:03:31.660> the<00:03:31.930> process<00:03:31.959> of<00:03:32.500> heating

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:33.270 
keep repeating the process of heating

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.580 
keep repeating the process of heating
using<00:03:34.270> the<00:03:34.420> rubber<00:03:34.600> mallet<00:03:34.840> and<00:03:35.140> the<00:03:35.380> two

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
using the rubber mallet and the two

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.790 
using the rubber mallet and the two
wooden<00:03:35.980> mallets<00:03:36.370> and<00:03:36.580> usually<00:03:37.360> that<00:03:38.080> works<00:03:38.440> to

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800 
wooden mallets and usually that works to

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:44.220 
wooden mallets and usually that works to
free<00:03:39.330> the<00:03:40.920> pistons<00:03:41.920> and<00:03:42.040> the<00:03:42.130> cylinders<00:03:43.230> if

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
free the pistons and the cylinders if

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.180 
free the pistons and the cylinders if
not<00:03:45.990> you<00:03:46.990> may<00:03:47.230> have<00:03:47.500> to<00:03:47.650> take<00:03:47.800> it<00:03:47.920> to<00:03:47.950> a<00:03:48.040> machine

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
not you may have to take it to a machine

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.490 
not you may have to take it to a machine
shop<00:03:48.400> and<00:03:48.670> get<00:03:49.000> them<00:03:49.150> to<00:03:49.330> punch<00:03:49.990> the<00:03:50.260> thing

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
shop and get them to punch the thing

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.940 
shop and get them to punch the thing
punch<00:03:51.040> the<00:03:52.350> cylinders<00:03:53.350> out<00:03:53.470> once<00:03:53.770> you

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
punch the cylinders out once you

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.660 
punch the cylinders out once you
completely<00:03:54.520> dismantle<00:03:55.120> the<00:03:55.270> lower<00:03:55.600> end<00:03:55.930> but

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
completely dismantle the lower end but

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.870 
completely dismantle the lower end but
hopefully<00:03:57.670> you<00:03:58.120> don't<00:03:58.269> get<00:03:58.360> to<00:03:58.480> that<00:03:58.510> point

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
hopefully you don't get to that point

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.400 
hopefully you don't get to that point
you<00:04:00.880> guys<00:04:01.030> just<00:04:01.269> wanted<00:04:01.420> to<00:04:01.480> show<00:04:01.690> you<00:04:01.720> that<00:04:01.959> if

you guys just wanted to show you that if
you<00:04:02.530> do<00:04:02.680> follow<00:04:02.920> those<00:04:03.190> steps<00:04:04.470> the<00:04:05.470> cylinders

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
you do follow those steps the cylinders

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.400 
you do follow those steps the cylinders
will<00:04:06.250> come<00:04:06.400> off<00:04:06.989> just<00:04:07.989> really<00:04:08.200> ought<00:04:08.290> to<00:04:08.350> be

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
will come off just really ought to be

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.400 
will come off just really ought to be
patient<00:04:08.800> because<00:04:08.950> it<00:04:08.980> does<00:04:09.190> take<00:04:09.400> a<00:04:09.459> while

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
patient because it does take a while

patient because it does take a while
especially<00:04:11.410> if<00:04:11.769> it's<00:04:11.890> been<00:04:12.040> sitting<00:04:12.310> for<00:04:12.340> a

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
especially if it's been sitting for a

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:15.030 
especially if it's been sitting for a
while<00:04:12.640> but<00:04:13.150> if<00:04:14.140> you<00:04:14.260> follow<00:04:14.440> these<00:04:14.560> steps<00:04:14.709> you

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
while but if you follow these steps you

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.159 
while but if you follow these steps you
shouldn't<00:04:15.519> have<00:04:15.730> too<00:04:15.970> much<00:04:16.150> of<00:04:16.269> a<00:04:16.330> problem<00:04:16.540> so

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:17.169 
shouldn't have too much of a problem so
