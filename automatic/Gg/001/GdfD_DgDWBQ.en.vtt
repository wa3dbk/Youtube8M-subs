00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.660
 to you too you look from the 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.429
 beginning because here and there we do not speak 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.559
 that naruto shippuden is also there 

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:35.180
 season 1 resource that needs to do more 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:38.059
 200 episodes so it's still 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.230
 plus six years it's pretty amazing I 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:42.620
 do not know how many episodes there are 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.210
 dragon ball a very good question but 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.860
 I believe my nose in the 400 a 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.949
 dragon ball if you know let in 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.629
 comments whatever what is it 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:52.040
 Anyway it's finally dragon 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:54.019
 all inclusive ball I speak of course a 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.940
 little just by volvo the help is talking about everything 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:57.680
 understood so there 400 episodes of naruto 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.659
 shippuden put me in the place of the 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.400
 person who will start the year auto who 

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:02.989
 said i'm going to watch the chains at 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.430
 the time I had watched the season one 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:08.299
 tree that I had and Chilean the 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.950
 guy he has 400 episodes of delay so I 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:11.510
 think the guy for six months he will 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.659
 to live like a hermit to catch up 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.520
 all this since 400 episodes an episode 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:20.500
 season minutes 400 times vance did 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:24.280
 8000 so 8000 minutes of 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:26.560
 the round naruto episode cetaceans e3 yabut 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.210
 in short, anyway we are on the 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.030
 out of series so you know one since 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.280
 Several weeks 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.979
 the tuning review that's not going on 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:38.659
 too much suna and konoha during the episode 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:41.340
 last we had seen chira finally 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:43.259
 to be updated let's say by lee who 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.270
 had understood that it was a shinobi 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:49.310
 like him only gifted at Tai Jutsu 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:52.350
 so no ninjutsu and no notes of 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.509
 panini jitsu and no ghinzu sorry and 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.409
 that's why it's 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.149
 take in this episode 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.409
 they were rejected from the village is 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.270
 rejected by his comrades 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.880
 so you will have notified it is a 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.229
 classic in the naruto the people who 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.550
 are rejected and finally who gets to 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.289
 take revenge on life 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.989
 it's a little bit of morality of naruto 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:12.180
 so him an umpteenth time is the same 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:15.569
 case since he too had 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.190
 known that he is therefore rejected he can not 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.720
 not even enroll in the academy since 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.610
 according to the laws of soumah a 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.130
 user only head at all 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.200
 can not become a shinobi 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.730
 so it's a bit complicated for him 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.350
 is really rejected by partner who 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.959
 trains alone until 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.700
 garaad becomes the kazekage here and 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:35.850
 change this law finally thanks 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.850
 acquired thanks to lee since it is necessary 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.540
 admit it gara was completely 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.579
 transformed by konoha 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.350
 not only the road we have 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:44.700
 completely changed mentally and in 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.590
 more so we learn in this episode 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.290
 that thanks to the fight against him that he 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.150
 had learned that he had who had it 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.820
 that he had done he just abolished the 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.160
 law just for chira since now 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:58.590
 he believes that one can become the shinobi 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.049
 using only tai jutsu 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.370
 see so that's why chira and if 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:03.750
 grateful to garat on 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.579
 did not understand why in the back two 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.829
 episodes and right now we understood 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:09.810
 since he simply accepted 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:12.110
 which unfortunately had an effect 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.180
 secondary to know that 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.700
 he harvested as it is called in my 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.380
 call him now haters ya not 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.110
 a lot of people who do not like it just 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.210
 because finally he went back into 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:25.610
 their entry into the business I tell him 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:28.460
 so the story of chira well 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:30.620
 obviously touches it more than ever 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:32.510
 and he's really a fan of chira this 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.670
 new bed he's so pissed off 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.410
 that he is going to face the shinobi 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.200
 tsuna that they attacked the episode 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.100
 last he absolutely wants to eat chira 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.810
 he wants to do him honor 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.900
 he will face them so it's a 6 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.550
 against 1 and obviously finally not obvious 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.380
 there is more power but 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:50.120
 unfortunately in any case it is 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.910
 still beat until the arrival of 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:55.220
 mega who saves a little who wants a little 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:58.610
 all the while doing it then what you do not 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:01.610
 see in this special issue is that 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:05.350
 well we will not lie the story 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:07.160
 the scenario is not super super huh 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:08.480
 it's all this time I think at 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.670
 level of the out of series we know that it is 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.810
 a little bit there to waste a 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.510
 little time to leave time 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:17.720
 to the cartoonists accompanied by the 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:19.220
 real episode so the story being 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.260
 not phenomenal I do not understand 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.420
 why the fights are the same level 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:26.060
 to know there so we see a fight with 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:27.830
 we see we see lille jx down and even 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.210
 tenten who is fighting the six 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.669
 people it is a fight which is null 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:34.220
 here we can say we see legitimate 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:35.870
 and 3 including emptiness we see tenten 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.410
 who launches a chain and then here is the 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.580
 fight is over 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.740
 so what I do not understand is 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.390
 that being given that the story is not 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.800
 super super why do not you 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:44.480
 enjoy to put us fighting 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.010
 really interesting why not 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.940
 to show us precisely because they are 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:49.340
 progressing 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:50.930
 at the time where we live this tournament you 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:53.690
 fawning why not show us 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:55.520
 the beds neji progress in beds 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:58.610
 beautiful fights beautiful fights as we 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.510
 could see in the rotunda even with them 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.090
 can be current they can be 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:03.530
 short and beautiful that of kakashi obito on 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:06.050
 is in is the perfect example 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:08.780
 kakashi vs hospitals around the world in 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:10.669
 the world in the world to hospitals 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.950
 during the spiritual world of toby 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:14.270
 when he does not fight that 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:14.690
 continues the episode is frankly it's 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.610
 serious 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:18.620
 steed and so what I got why at 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:20.150
 their series we do not have the right to 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.500
 fighting like this here it would do I 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.669
 think of living full of characters 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.680
 that we do not often see there in 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:26.030
 the occurrence reads we could have seen 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.229
 things much better than what we saw 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:29.150
 So that's a bit of a pity 

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:31.210
 for their series I find and 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:34.640
 finally at the end of the episode 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:36.800
 so we see lee who is so yes I 

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:39.200
 want so much talk we see chira so 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:42.080
 who absolutely forgives the forgiving 

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.800
 to tsuna yoga so that makes me think 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.419
 a little to naruto 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:47.120
 the guy he's never pissed off he forgives 

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:48.169
 everyone sees it all right 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.180
 world is beautiful everyone is there 

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:52.669
 so he is not and forgive them 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:54.650
 of then lee is even more fan of chira 

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:55.939
 but finally out of pride let the 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:58.430
 but not done though their bumpers 

00:05:55.939 --> 00:06:02.029
 and so that the sheikh team 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:03.770
 and the 2nd team of neusiedl 80 n is 

00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:04.999
 normally qualified with both 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:07.310
 parliaments so at the very end of 

00:06:04.999 --> 00:06:09.620
 the episode against lee launches a challenge 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:12.349
 so a fight against chira in all 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:13.969
 respect of course to face each other 

00:06:12.349 --> 00:06:16.849
 in respect as they are all 

00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:19.550
 two pretty impressed one and the other 

00:06:16.849 --> 00:06:22.520
 so here's the chiral fight i'll be 

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:24.020
 for the next week little small 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.729
 downside at the end of the episode when we 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:26.150
 talk about the road to the dancers in this 

00:06:25.729 --> 00:06:28.129
 out of series 

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:29.689
 there is an age gap that is not 

00:06:28.129 --> 00:06:31.849
 necessarily respected since he speaks of 

00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:33.080
 naruto and so we see it was retoked in 

00:06:31.849 --> 00:06:35.060
 eating ramen with jiraya 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:36.680
 and naruto is still in the background it is 

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:39.020
 always to the kids as we see 

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:40.400
 although tenten game animals have grown 

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:43.219
 and are downright dole and 

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:45.050
 overweight so that was not very much 

00:06:43.219 --> 00:06:45.560
 very well I save so eventually when 

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:47.479
 I'm thinking about it 

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:48.699
 what is possible is that when 

00:06:47.479 --> 00:06:51.020
 so talk about naruto 

00:06:48.699 --> 00:06:53.000
 finally when we see naruto it's 

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:54.949
 not currently it's just a memory 

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.330
 from what we saw of him at the time 

00:06:54.949 --> 00:06:56.779
 so in this case there others a little more 

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:59.599
 logic 

00:06:56.779 --> 00:07:01.460
 well in short just a little detail in the 

00:06:59.599 --> 00:07:05.089
 preview of the episode we can see 

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:06.589
 sure the beds fight and shira so that 

00:07:05.089 --> 00:07:08.659
 basically that's it and next week 

00:07:06.589 --> 00:07:10.009
 we will see a little more of this fight in 

00:07:08.659 --> 00:07:11.810
 hoping as I said just before
