00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
away from scopes and so because they'll

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.750 
away from scopes and so because they'll
kind<00:00:51.030> of<00:00:51.059> be<00:00:51.120> useless<00:00:51.800> select<00:00:52.800> fire<00:00:53.039> up<00:00:53.280> we're

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
kind of be useless select fire up we're

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.010 
kind of be useless select fire up we're
going<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:54.000> need<00:00:54.149> this<00:00:54.360> because<00:00:54.539> we're<00:00:54.899> going

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
going to need this because we're going

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.139 
going to need this because we're going
to<00:00:55.079> have<00:00:55.170> suppressor<00:00:55.739> on<00:00:55.890> and<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.640> reason<00:00:56.789> we

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
to have suppressor on and the reason we

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.639 
to have suppressor on and the reason we
can<00:00:57.329> have<00:00:57.449> select<00:00:57.780> fire<00:00:57.989> while<00:00:58.410> got

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
can have select fire while got

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.290 
can have select fire while got
suppressor<00:00:59.010> is<00:00:59.100> select<00:00:59.430> fire<00:00:59.579> kinda<00:00:59.969> sucks

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
suppressor is select fire kinda sucks

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.869 
suppressor is select fire kinda sucks
like<00:01:00.480> expressive<00:01:01.079> some<00:01:01.230> reason<00:01:01.670> yeah<00:01:02.670> that's

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
like expressive some reason yeah that's

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.000 
like expressive some reason yeah that's
right<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:03.210> trailer<00:01:03.539> suppressor<00:01:04.290> reduces<00:01:04.830> your

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
right a trailer suppressor reduces your

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.429 
right a trailer suppressor reduces your
range<00:01:05.220> a<00:01:05.400> little<00:01:05.519> so<00:01:06.180> stay<00:01:06.780> away<00:01:06.869> from<00:01:06.960> rapid

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
range a little so stay away from rapid

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.109 
range a little so stay away from rapid
fire<00:01:07.619> only<00:01:08.310> I'll<00:01:08.430> rapid<00:01:08.760> fire<00:01:08.909> without

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
fire only I'll rapid fire without

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.450 
fire only I'll rapid fire without
suppressor<00:01:09.720> because<00:01:10.170> PDW<00:01:11.100> as<00:01:11.159> a<00:01:11.189> pretty

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
suppressor because PDW as a pretty

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.580 
suppressor because PDW as a pretty
decent<00:01:11.939> range<00:01:12.119> as<00:01:12.270> it<00:01:12.390> is<00:01:12.510> and<00:01:12.750> if<00:01:13.260> you<00:01:13.409> put

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
decent range as it is and if you put

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:14.990 
decent range as it is and if you put
suppressor<00:01:13.920> and<00:01:14.100> rapid<00:01:14.430> fire<00:01:14.610> on<00:01:14.790> there

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
suppressor and rapid fire on there

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.219 
suppressor and rapid fire on there
that's<00:01:15.180> going<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.390> really<00:01:15.570> reduce<00:01:15.720> that<00:01:16.020> range

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
that's going to really reduce that range

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.350 
that's going to really reduce that range
and<00:01:16.500> now<00:01:17.369> you<00:01:17.430> can't<00:01:17.670> have<00:01:17.820> long<00:01:18.030> barrel

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
and now you can't have long barrel

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.039 
and now you can't have long barrel
because<00:01:18.509> obviously<00:01:18.630> you<00:01:18.900> can<00:01:19.020> have

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
because obviously you can have

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.320 
because obviously you can have
suppressor<00:01:19.590> on<00:01:19.650> there

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330 
suppressor on there

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.700 
suppressor on there
FMJ<00:01:21.330> is<00:01:21.600> okay<00:01:22.200> but<00:01:22.409> if<00:01:22.500> you've<00:01:22.590> got<00:01:22.680> a

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
FMJ is okay but if you've got a

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.950 
FMJ is okay but if you've got a
suppressor<00:01:23.040> on<00:01:23.280> scene<00:01:23.460> its<00:01:23.610> PDW<00:01:24.360> it<00:01:24.720> ain't

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
suppressor on scene its PDW it ain't

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.330 
suppressor on scene its PDW it ain't
really<00:01:25.140> gonna<00:01:25.229> penetrate<00:01:25.619> that<00:01:25.950> many<00:01:26.130> walls

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
really gonna penetrate that many walls

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.560 
really gonna penetrate that many walls
in<00:01:26.460> a<00:01:26.580> way<00:01:26.670> that's<00:01:26.880> kind<00:01:27.000> of<00:01:27.119> for<00:01:27.270> assault

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
in a way that's kind of for assault

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.340 
in a way that's kind of for assault
rifles<00:01:28.020> so<00:01:28.290> we'll<00:01:28.439> stay<00:01:28.619> away<00:01:28.770> from<00:01:28.829> that

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
rifles so we'll stay away from that

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.920 
rifles so we'll stay away from that
extended<00:01:31.350> clip<00:01:31.380> or<00:01:31.829> fast<00:01:32.460> mag<00:01:32.820> is<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.450> definite

firstly<00:03:26.730> i'm<00:03:26.820> going<00:03:26.940> to<00:03:27.000> go<00:03:27.060> for<00:03:27.269> lightweights

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
firstly i'm going to go for lightweights

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:28.819 
firstly i'm going to go for lightweights
and<00:03:27.900> more<00:03:28.019> of<00:03:28.079> a<00:03:28.110> rusher<00:03:28.410> let's<00:03:28.590> choose<00:03:28.799> that

I<00:03:34.230> think<00:03:34.590> can't<00:03:34.920> UAV<00:03:35.220> MP<00:03:35.519> don't<00:03:35.760> go<00:03:35.820> in<00:03:35.910> that

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
I think can't UAV MP don't go in that

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.880 
I think can't UAV MP don't go in that
often<00:03:36.390> so<00:03:36.570> stay<00:03:37.049> away<00:03:37.140> from<00:03:37.230> hard<00:03:37.620> wired

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890
