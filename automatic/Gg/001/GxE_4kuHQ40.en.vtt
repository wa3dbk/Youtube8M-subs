00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:23.019 
is the normal 320 x 480 pixels now if

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:25.920 
is the normal 320 x 480 pixels now if
you<00:02:23.230> were<00:02:23.349> designing<00:02:23.849> without<00:02:24.849> the<00:02:25.419> status

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
you were designing without the status

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:26.559 
you were designing without the status
bar

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
bar

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.569 
bar
should<00:02:26.749> be<00:02:26.870> the<00:02:27.019> size<00:02:27.200> however<00:02:27.980> if<00:02:28.189> you<00:02:28.340> do

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:28.579 
should be the size however if you do

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:31.959 
should be the size however if you do
have<00:02:28.819> a<00:02:28.849> status<00:02:29.420> bar<00:02:29.689> then<00:02:30.290> you<00:02:30.439> need<00:02:30.650> to<00:02:30.969> crop

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:31.969 
have a status bar then you need to crop

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:37.080 
have a status bar then you need to crop
20<00:02:32.870> pixels<00:02:33.290> off<00:02:33.620> the<00:02:34.280> top<00:02:34.670> of<00:02:34.730> the<00:02:35.599> screen<00:02:35.719> like

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
20 pixels off the top of the screen like

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.910 
20 pixels off the top of the screen like
so<00:02:38.090> that's<00:02:38.599> 20<00:02:38.930> pixels<00:02:39.319> off<00:02:39.469> the<00:02:39.590> top<00:02:39.739> of<00:02:39.829> the

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
so that's 20 pixels off the top of the

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.599 
so that's 20 pixels off the top of the
screen<00:02:40.069> and<00:02:40.340> that<00:02:41.329> will<00:02:41.739> then<00:02:42.739> be<00:02:43.159> and<00:02:43.280> that

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:43.609 
screen and that will then be and that

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:46.379 
screen and that will then be and that
will<00:02:43.730> be<00:02:43.849> the<00:02:43.879> size<00:02:44.209> of<00:02:44.359> your<00:02:44.420> screen<00:02:44.810> with<00:02:45.469> the

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:46.389 
will be the size of your screen with the

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:52.030 
will be the size of your screen with the
status<00:02:47.389> bar<00:02:47.420> there<00:02:47.870> like<00:02:48.829> that<00:02:50.500> so<00:02:51.500> yeah<00:02:51.829> and

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
status bar there like that so yeah and

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.089 
status bar there like that so yeah and
also<00:02:52.669> we<00:02:53.269> have<00:02:53.389> a<00:02:53.419> second<00:02:53.900> screen<00:02:54.109> which<00:02:55.069> is

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:55.099 
also we have a second screen which is

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:58.270 
also we have a second screen which is
called<00:02:55.609> the<00:02:56.450> retina<00:02:56.870> screen<00:02:57.079> and<00:02:57.349> that<00:02:57.859> is<00:02:58.010> for

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
called the retina screen and that is for

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.569 
called the retina screen and that is for
iphone<00:02:58.790> 4s<00:02:59.299> the<00:02:59.599> new<00:02:59.840> iphone<00:03:00.379> 4s<00:03:01.010> which<00:03:01.400> is

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:01.579 
iphone 4s the new iphone 4s which is

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:04.209 
iphone 4s the new iphone 4s which is
just<00:03:01.730> being<00:03:01.909> released<00:03:02.269> well<00:03:02.709> shown<00:03:03.709> which

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:04.219 
just being released well shown which

00:03:04.219 --> 00:03:07.360 
just being released well shown which
everyone's<00:03:04.819> excited<00:03:05.060> about<00:03:05.359> and<00:03:06.370> obviously

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
everyone's excited about and obviously

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.839 
everyone's excited about and obviously
ipod<00:03:07.760> touches<00:03:08.180> and<00:03:08.419> stuff<00:03:09.319> like<00:03:09.439> that<00:03:09.500> so<00:03:10.310> that

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:10.849 
ipod touches and stuff like that so that

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:13.929 
ipod touches and stuff like that so that
is<00:03:11.150> going<00:03:11.359> to<00:03:11.540> be<00:03:11.659> always<00:03:12.159> double<00:03:13.159> the<00:03:13.310> size<00:03:13.519> of

00:03:13.929 --> 00:03:13.939 
is going to be always double the size of

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:17.500 
is going to be always double the size of
the<00:03:14.449> normal<00:03:15.409> images<00:03:15.829> so<00:03:16.219> here<00:03:16.519> we<00:03:16.909> have<00:03:16.939> a

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
the normal images so here we have a

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.699 
the normal images so here we have a
Retina<00:03:18.349> size<00:03:18.769> image<00:03:19.129> now<00:03:19.639> this<00:03:19.819> is<00:03:19.879> ninth

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
Retina size image now this is ninth

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:25.179 
Retina size image now this is ninth
sorry<00:03:21.709> 640<00:03:22.549> x<00:03:22.760> 9<00:03:23.060> 40<00:03:23.629> pixels<00:03:23.989> again<00:03:24.889> you<00:03:25.069> would

00:03:25.179 --> 00:03:25.189 
sorry 640 x 9 40 pixels again you would

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:28.599 
sorry 640 x 9 40 pixels again you would
cut<00:03:25.459> 40<00:03:26.030> pixels<00:03:26.359> off<00:03:26.540> the<00:03:26.689> top<00:03:26.930> of<00:03:27.199> this<00:03:28.189> if<00:03:28.459> you

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:28.609 
cut 40 pixels off the top of this if you

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:32.020 
cut 40 pixels off the top of this if you
wanted<00:03:28.969> to<00:03:29.120> code<00:03:29.689> with<00:03:29.989> the<00:03:30.139> status<00:03:30.560> bar<00:03:31.030> so

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
wanted to code with the status bar so

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.110 
wanted to code with the status bar so
crop<00:03:32.959> 40<00:03:33.259> pixels<00:03:33.500> off<00:03:33.620> the<00:03:33.739> top<00:03:33.919> there<00:03:34.159> I<00:03:34.340> did

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
crop 40 pixels off the top there I did

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.399 
crop 40 pixels off the top there I did
41<00:03:35.540> bikes<00:03:35.750> then<00:03:36.519> yep<00:03:37.519> so<00:03:38.030> there<00:03:38.900> you<00:03:38.989> go<00:03:39.019> that's

00:03:39.399 --> 00:03:39.409 
41 bikes then yep so there you go that's

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:43.030 
41 bikes then yep so there you go that's
a<00:03:39.620> retina<00:03:40.400> image<00:03:41.139> now<00:03:42.139> remember<00:03:42.650> if<00:03:42.859> you're

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
a retina image now remember if you're

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.240 
a retina image now remember if you're
designing<00:03:43.959> every<00:03:44.959> retinal<00:03:45.470> images<00:03:45.859> always

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
designing every retinal images always

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.339 
designing every retinal images always
double<00:03:46.639> the<00:03:46.729> size<00:03:46.909> so<00:03:47.419> if<00:03:47.540> you<00:03:47.629> had<00:03:47.810> a<00:03:47.840> button

00:03:48.339 --> 00:03:48.349 
double the size so if you had a button

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:52.300 
double the size so if you had a button
that<00:03:48.560> is<00:03:49.040> 100<00:03:49.849> by<00:03:50.090> a<00:03:50.120> hundred<00:03:50.659> on<00:03:51.040> retina<00:03:52.040> size

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
that is 100 by a hundred on retina size

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.300 
that is 100 by a hundred on retina size
then<00:03:53.120> it's<00:03:53.299> going<00:03:53.479> to<00:03:53.569> be<00:03:53.750> 50<00:03:54.290> by<00:03:54.470> 50<00:03:54.530> on

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
then it's going to be 50 by 50 on

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.499 
then it's going to be 50 by 50 on
non-retina<00:03:56.269> size<00:03:56.780> so<00:03:57.620> always<00:03:58.579> design<00:03:59.299> with

00:03:59.499 --> 00:03:59.509 
non-retina size so always design with

00:03:59.509 --> 00:04:01.390 
non-retina size so always design with
the<00:03:59.540> retina<00:04:00.019> first<00:04:00.319> because<00:04:01.040> that<00:04:01.250> will<00:04:01.340> be

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
the retina first because that will be

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.920 
the retina first because that will be
your<00:04:01.549> biggest<00:04:01.790> resolutions<00:04:02.479> you<00:04:02.599> want<00:04:02.750> it<00:04:02.810> to

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
your biggest resolutions you want it to

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.719 
your biggest resolutions you want it to
look<00:04:03.019> at<00:04:03.169> very<00:04:03.439> nice<00:04:03.680> when<00:04:04.099> it's<00:04:04.220> so<00:04:04.489> it's<00:04:04.639> not

00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:04.729 
look at very nice when it's so it's not

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:06.640 
look at very nice when it's so it's not
pixelated<00:04:04.989> so<00:04:05.989> let's<00:04:06.169> say<00:04:06.290> this<00:04:06.319> is<00:04:06.560> our

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
pixelated so let's say this is our

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.729 
pixelated so let's say this is our
button<00:04:07.069> here<00:04:07.310> our<00:04:07.579> button<00:04:08.209> is<00:04:08.359> 200<00:04:09.109> by<00:04:09.259> 200

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:09.739 
button here our button is 200 by 200

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:12.099 
button here our button is 200 by 200
pixels<00:04:09.889> on<00:04:10.310> retina<00:04:10.790> so<00:04:11.359> when<00:04:11.540> we<00:04:11.659> shrink<00:04:11.900> it

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:12.109 
pixels on retina so when we shrink it

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:16.749 
pixels on retina so when we shrink it
down<00:04:12.139> it<00:04:12.590> will<00:04:12.859> be<00:04:13.150> 100<00:04:14.150> by<00:04:14.299> 100<00:04:14.540> pixels<00:04:15.759> like

00:04:16.749 --> 00:04:16.759 
down it will be 100 by 100 pixels like

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:18.909 
down it will be 100 by 100 pixels like
that<00:04:16.969> now<00:04:17.630> one<00:04:17.959> thing<00:04:17.989> other<00:04:18.530> thing<00:04:18.799> you'll

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:18.919 
that now one thing other thing you'll

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:21.430 
that now one thing other thing you'll
notice<00:04:19.099> about<00:04:19.370> these<00:04:19.849> graphics<00:04:20.419> is<00:04:20.659> the<00:04:21.229> one

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
notice about these graphics is the one

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.260 
notice about these graphics is the one
they<00:04:21.709> obviously<00:04:21.829> look<00:04:22.159> exactly<00:04:22.580> the<00:04:22.669> same<00:04:22.759> and

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
they obviously look exactly the same and

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.860 
they obviously look exactly the same and
their<00:04:24.020> name<00:04:24.409> is<00:04:24.800> exactly<00:04:25.490> the<00:04:25.880> same<00:04:26.120> apart

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
their name is exactly the same apart

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:31.120 
their name is exactly the same apart
from<00:04:27.169> the<00:04:27.949> retina<00:04:28.460> image<00:04:28.699> has<00:04:29.330> at<00:04:29.750> 2x<00:04:30.740> on<00:04:31.009> the

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 
from the retina image has at 2x on the

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:34.830 
from the retina image has at 2x on the
end<00:04:31.280> so<00:04:31.719> this<00:04:32.719> one<00:04:32.990> is<00:04:33.229> just<00:04:33.500> default<00:04:34.009> dot<00:04:34.219> PNG

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
end so this one is just default dot PNG

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.810 
end so this one is just default dot PNG
over<00:04:35.840> here<00:04:36.199> which<00:04:36.560> is<00:04:36.710> the<00:04:36.830> retina<00:04:37.219> one<00:04:37.430> we

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
over here which is the retina one we

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.420 
over here which is the retina one we
have<00:04:37.969> default<00:04:38.539> at<00:04:38.810> sign<00:04:39.560> too

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
have default at sign too

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.750 
have default at sign too
P&amp;G<00:04:41.330> it's<00:04:41.840> the<00:04:41.900> same<00:04:42.200> name<00:04:42.530> but<00:04:43.100> with<00:04:43.280> this<00:04:43.490> at

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:43.760 
P&amp;G it's the same name but with this at

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.260

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
that this is a retina image you don't

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.030 
that this is a retina image you don't
need<00:04:50.240> to<00:04:50.300> code<00:04:50.630> anything<00:04:51.080> in<00:04:51.200> Xcode<00:04:51.590> to<00:04:51.740> let<00:04:51.890> it

between the two you don't have to do
anything<00:04:56.180> you<00:04:56.360> just<00:04:56.450> need<00:04:56.720> to<00:04:56.840> make<00:04:56.960> sure<00:04:57.020> both

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:57.380 
anything you just need to make sure both

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.260 
anything you just need to make sure both
of<00:04:57.620> these<00:04:57.740> are<00:04:58.040> included<00:04:58.520> in<00:04:58.670> your<00:04:58.820> project

00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.270 
of these are included in your project

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:02.200 
of these are included in your project
and<00:04:59.560> when<00:05:00.560> you're<00:05:00.650> declaring<00:05:01.010> an<00:05:01.400> image<00:05:01.700> so

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
and when you're declaring an image so

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.330 
and when you're declaring an image so
say<00:05:02.390> if<00:05:02.480> you<00:05:02.540> wanted<00:05:02.780> to<00:05:02.900> set<00:05:03.140> your<00:05:03.290> image<00:05:03.650> you

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:04.340 
say if you wanted to set your image you

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.760 
say if you wanted to set your image you
will<00:05:04.460> always<00:05:04.790> use<00:05:05.090> the<00:05:05.120> low<00:05:06.080> resolution

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:06.770 
will always use the low resolution

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:08.860 
will always use the low resolution
version<00:05:07.220> and<00:05:07.430> Xcode<00:05:08.180> will<00:05:08.330> automatically

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:08.870 
version and Xcode will automatically

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.750 
version and Xcode will automatically
change<00:05:08.900> it<00:05:09.260> to<00:05:09.380> the<00:05:09.500> retina<00:05:09.890> version<00:05:10.460> if<00:05:10.610> you

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:10.760 
change it to the retina version if you

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:14.080 
change it to the retina version if you
have<00:05:10.940> one<00:05:11.180> and<00:05:11.770> so<00:05:12.770> they<00:05:12.980> go<00:05:13.280> that's<00:05:13.670> just<00:05:13.850> my

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090 
have one and so they go that's just my

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:17.620 
have one and so they go that's just my
little<00:05:14.150> kind<00:05:14.630> of<00:05:14.690> jargon<00:05:14.990> tutorial<00:05:15.710> on<00:05:16.090> my<00:05:17.090> you

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:21.710 
know my my graphic skills I can't make

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:24.040 
know my my graphic skills I can't make
graphics<00:05:22.010> very<00:05:22.430> well<00:05:22.670> but<00:05:23.270> that's<00:05:23.600> just<00:05:23.870> so

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
graphics very well but that's just so

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:25.510

about<00:05:25.820> in<00:05:26.120> my<00:05:26.300> other<00:05:26.510> tutorials<00:05:27.110> in<00:05:27.260> this

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:27.410 
about in my other tutorials in this

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:29.800 
about in my other tutorials in this
series<00:05:27.470> why<00:05:28.400> you<00:05:28.460> have<00:05:28.760> the<00:05:28.910> retina<00:05:29.360> versions

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:29.810 
series why you have the retina versions

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:31.720 
series why you have the retina versions
what<00:05:30.230> the<00:05:30.380> retina<00:05:30.740> versions<00:05:31.040> are<00:05:31.190> double<00:05:31.610> the

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:31.730 
what the retina versions are double the

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:36.400 
what the retina versions are double the
size<00:05:31.940> always<00:05:33.160> now<00:05:34.270> Yan<00:05:35.270> has<00:05:35.570> also<00:05:35.780> explained

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:36.410 
size always now Yan has also explained

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:38.290 
size always now Yan has also explained
this<00:05:36.560> in<00:05:36.620> his<00:05:36.920> tutorials<00:05:37.580> and<00:05:37.880> I<00:05:38.030> think<00:05:38.240> he

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:38.300 
this in his tutorials and I think he

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:39.970 
this in his tutorials and I think he
does<00:05:38.450> it<00:05:38.480> a<00:05:38.600> lot<00:05:38.900> better<00:05:39.230> than<00:05:39.500> I<00:05:39.560> have<00:05:39.770> just

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:39.980 
does it a lot better than I have just

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:41.980 
does it a lot better than I have just
done<00:05:40.160> so<00:05:40.640> if<00:05:40.760> you<00:05:40.880> want<00:05:41.090> to<00:05:41.180> go<00:05:41.300> watch<00:05:41.540> his

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:44.660 
first tutorial in making the graphics it

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:46.240 
first tutorial in making the graphics it
will<00:05:44.780> explain<00:05:45.140> everything<00:05:45.200> straight<00:05:46.010> away

clearer but all you need to know is

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:54.910 
clearer but all you need to know is
retina<00:05:53.030> size<00:05:53.270> is<00:05:53.600> always<00:05:53.930> double<00:05:54.320> the<00:05:54.440> size<00:05:54.620> of

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:54.920 
retina size is always double the size of

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:57.940 
retina size is always double the size of
the<00:05:55.100> normal<00:05:55.550> one<00:05:55.760> and<00:05:55.970> it<00:05:56.630> has<00:05:56.780> at<00:05:56.990> 2x<00:05:57.620> on<00:05:57.860> the

00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:57.950 
the normal one and it has at 2x on the

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:00.940 
the normal one and it has at 2x on the
end<00:05:58.100> so<00:05:58.460> simple<00:05:58.910> as<00:05:59.000> that<00:05:59.080> so<00:06:00.080> again<00:06:00.440> thanks
