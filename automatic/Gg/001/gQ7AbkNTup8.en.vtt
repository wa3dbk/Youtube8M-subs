00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.870
 sace I've seen so many go where it pulls 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.790
 the wind 

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.680
 I walked so hard I chose you 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.420

 shows each with feeling to many not 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.150
 like not live like I almost do 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.600
 given a hand and not shod all over the 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.250
 arm 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.050
 I am conscious the more it will seem to him 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.059
 consciousness is not the weight of science 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.950
 mind that oppresses patience call me 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.150
 straw because I play with your mind 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.470
 the chaste what I don't see 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.750
 connections absent out of the 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.460
 well lit outside the humans outside 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.320
 from your techniques from these times 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.090
 strange are out of the planet when 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.040
 puts a foot study often expenses of the 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.750
 sun circles the sun look June are 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.579
 the stranger who listens to the first one 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.890
 once at the end of the first track and the 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.750
 face upset and another time fall 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.030
 learning to dangerous is deep night 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.339
 as I write and know that I don't rest in gratitude 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.750
 site plan monoxide breath water in 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.580
 this way in turmoil in a while 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.110
 next in stop we can't not know 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.880
 they know us and you know there 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.009
 they control the places they then hide 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.140
 I move slowly beneath buildings 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:18.060
 where we do freestyle break for the 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.399
 I'm cackling my eyes, I'm 20 and I do 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.289
 well just these herons that are modest 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:24.450
 that i am honest man on how many hits he has 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:26.490
 imi inflicted much suffering because 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.050
 sail follows the wind from six open sea 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.149
 in the text are different writes in this 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.920
 way to not be like them I drink and 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:34.350
 while the water explodes I live a rhapsody 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.390
 the melody that I listen to varies 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.069
 games or made after paolo gave you the 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.140
 melancholy seeing votes at the Freemasons 

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:41.970
 and I'm still at the crossroads looking for the 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.250
 my away in my room in paranoia 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.050
 these little andria I amuse over the vice 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.420
 I bring you pure poetry half is good 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.740
 sinks I rest of my care you know that 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.780
 there is a flower that the night is 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.209
 the petals transform the whole moon 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.099
 and takes shape tried wide perhaps the 

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:58.229
 his smile returns and another time 

00:01:56.099 --> 00:02:00.209
 cadeau learns from dangerous is night 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.520
 founded as I write and know that I do not rest 

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:04.170
 doubles the oxide breath monoxide 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.270
 later in this way interlude between a 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.399
 next time you always smile lights up 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.259
 all this shadow gets strength if 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.180
 no one has you second remember you are a 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.860
 founded where evil surrounds you not 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.690
 move in quicksand or yes 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.250
 sinks we are all slaves of a cross 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.620
 looking for a voice we live below 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.090
 life control courteous fast my sweet 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.860
 a year today to write a pain 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.750
 atrocious for those who lived the night if a 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.460
 pray this darkness who 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.930
 advances when you lose hope does 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.160
 get your own concept which his wife 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.630
 of distance 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.670
 what shapes you inside sto 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.710
 Marasmus is a pale ghost planet 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.750
 anxiety attacks where love and command 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.670
 there is no capital no war at all 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.290
 hunger only art in the streets I'll be there 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.150
 together with the others in the rhymes you don't 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.340
 worry write bombs informally giving you 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.900
 eradicate evil the language of hatred in 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.490
 I wrote my own solitude 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.320
 for this I hate in a bin on one 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:51.480
 straight you are free to choose 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.730
 your decisions if you skilled palace 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.650
 even inside the sheds and once again 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.210
 happened and learns it is dangerous 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.490
 and deep night as I write and know that 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:01.560
 do not rest thankfully the oxide breath 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:03.510
 raco monoxide in this way intermezzo 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.220
 in a while mixed prose televisions in 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.080
 way from floria more colors osco into the 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.970
 calm study looking for better times 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.710
 now travel and strange ways without losing 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.880
 my way is that I see the aster genius 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:13.500
 inside attacks of madness 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.150
 I should believe in myself what 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.740
 everyone told me mike and I want to do it 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.360
 It is then start the project but 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.130
 this time, everything knows the void 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.780
 inside the chest between doing taxes with 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:23.520
 I want to make it perfect from mine 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.230
 first free style spit in a bar 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.970
 that apple laid the foundation 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.680
 in the architect's cabin he wants to fill 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.599
 the space between me and you with carmen foot 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.909
 make you feel my beat increase the 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:34.019
 my thirst and another time cadeau learns 

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:35.730
 and it's dangerous 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:37.860
 and deep night as he writes he knows not 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.670
 rest given away the oxide breath 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.170
 monoxide 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.980
 later in this way interlude between a 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.980
 next time
