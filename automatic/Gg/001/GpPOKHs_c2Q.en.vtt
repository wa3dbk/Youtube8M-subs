00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:05.770
 yes what a salad and seriously 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:13.280
 hello to all and now I hope 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:15.170
 you are well above today 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.550
 we find ourselves for a nice video in 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.949
 which I will show you a little 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.690
 glitch or rather a trick to boost 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:21.980
 your vehicles so that will not work with 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:24.740
 all vehicles 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.119
 so for this video I have a sports 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.220
 normal and my colleague at the 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:30.289
 supersportive so logically the 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.900
 superpole the supersportive will have to have 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:34.820
 an acceleration or even speed a 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.860
 little higher than a sportswoman and I 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.989
 will show you that this is pretty much 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.059
 almost the same so I explained to you 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:41.570
 the trick right after he's at small the 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:43.219
 little video 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.620
 so here I 'm going to show you what it's all about 

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:47.960
 so I look like I have the sporty and 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.090
 oil to the supersportive so like 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.210
 could see I still like the 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.210
 road 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.850
 so the manipulation to do is go 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.910
 really super basic is very simple to 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.910
 achieve 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:07.110
 so as you can see I the 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.820
 really like here so now I 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.750
 will show you how 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:15.119
 and how to do for this little click so 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.409
 you will normally wait for 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.649
 first gear you will hear it 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.030
 spent so that's going to make a slap and at 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:22.710
 level of the second gear you go 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.630
 press extra and you accelerate 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.399
 live so that's going to make a braking 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.229
 hand-held and you're going accelerated live 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:29.310
 between each speed you will do 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.100
 this manipulation 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.570
 so as soon as you go to hear that they 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.340
 pass the speed will make him believe and 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.350
 to speed up and you'll see that's going 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.780
 make a flashback and you go 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.240
 see that you are really going 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.760
 how to catch up with your colleague and 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.290
 frankly it really works so 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.540
 So thank you to rumor who was me 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.430
 for this video I thank you but who 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.930
 so has it so if you ever have any 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.220
 questions about this little trick 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.140
 do not hesitate to put it in 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.650
 comments or ask a friend about 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.270
 skype 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.250
 So here we are, do not hesitate to let go 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.840
 a little green thumb if this video you 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.740
 pleased me I tell you next time 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.740
 for new videos
