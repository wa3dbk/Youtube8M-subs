passes<00:02:35.540> and<00:02:35.720> that<00:02:35.870> something<00:02:36.080> is<00:02:36.380> noticeable

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
passes and that something is noticeable

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.370 
passes and that something is noticeable
or<00:02:37.370> is<00:02:37.580> that<00:02:37.670> hard<00:02:37.880> to<00:02:38.000> tell<00:02:38.450> what<00:02:38.750> use<00:02:38.900> it<00:02:39.080> from

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
or is that hard to tell what use it from

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.830 
or is that hard to tell what use it from
the<00:02:39.620> spring<00:02:39.920> yeah<00:02:40.489> like<00:02:41.060> he's<00:02:41.450> more<00:02:41.660> on<00:02:41.750> the

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
the spring yeah like he's more on the

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.460 
the spring yeah like he's more on the
ball<00:02:42.310> again<00:02:43.310> I<00:02:43.340> you<00:02:43.970> know<00:02:44.090> I<00:02:44.510> think<00:02:45.080> his<00:02:45.200> arm<00:02:45.319> is

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
ball again I you know I think his arm is

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.350 
ball again I you know I think his arm is
in<00:02:45.620> good<00:02:46.040> shape<00:02:46.100> I<00:02:46.489> think<00:02:46.819> he's<00:02:46.940> stronger<00:02:47.330> than

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
in good shape I think he's stronger than

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.030 
in good shape I think he's stronger than
he<00:02:47.480> has<00:02:47.690> been<00:02:47.870> I<00:02:47.959> know<00:02:48.019> it's<00:02:48.260> heavier<00:02:48.560> so<00:02:48.890> it

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
he has been I know it's heavier so it

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.830 
he has been I know it's heavier so it
might<00:02:49.310> be<00:02:49.340> some<00:02:49.640> merit<00:02:49.819> to<00:02:49.910> that<00:02:50.000> but<00:02:50.360> again

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
might be some merit to that but again

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.390 
might be some merit to that but again
we'll<00:02:50.959> find<00:02:51.200> out<00:02:51.350> once<00:02:51.500> we<00:02:51.650> get<00:02:51.799> going<00:02:51.860> here<00:02:52.100> oh

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
we'll find out once we get going here oh

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.820 
we'll find out once we get going here oh
you<00:02:52.700> guys<00:02:53.090> like<00:02:53.360> the<00:02:53.600> nation<00:02:53.989> last<00:02:54.170> year<00:02:54.470> and<00:02:54.680> I

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
you guys like the nation last year and I

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.759 
you guys like the nation last year and I
think<00:02:55.220> tackles-for-loss<00:02:55.989> pretty<00:02:56.989> well<00:02:57.170> Saxon

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:57.769 
think tackles-for-loss pretty well Saxon

00:02:57.769 --> 00:02:59.710 
think tackles-for-loss pretty well Saxon
obviously<00:02:58.760> it's<00:02:58.880> important<00:02:59.330> but<00:02:59.420> can<00:02:59.630> you

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
obviously it's important but can you

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.990 
obviously it's important but can you
tell<00:03:00.019> just<00:03:00.739> how<00:03:00.860> important<00:03:01.370> that<00:03:01.459> is<00:03:01.519> for<00:03:01.700> your

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
tell just how important that is for your

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.850 
tell just how important that is for your
defense<00:03:02.209> it<00:03:02.569> is<00:03:02.900> important<00:03:03.319> i<00:03:03.380> think<00:03:03.560> you<00:03:03.799> know

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
defense it is important i think you know

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.430 
defense it is important i think you know
but<00:03:04.220> more<00:03:04.610> focusing<00:03:05.120> on<00:03:05.269> is<00:03:05.450> is<00:03:05.660> eliminated

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
but more focusing on is is eliminated

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:07.750 
but more focusing on is is eliminated
that<00:03:06.590> you<00:03:06.680> know<00:03:06.799> the<00:03:06.920> explosive<00:03:07.370> plays<00:03:07.549> we

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
that you know the explosive plays we

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.289 
that you know the explosive plays we
gave<00:03:07.970> up<00:03:08.120> too<00:03:08.150> many<00:03:08.299> long<00:03:08.600> runs<00:03:09.220> and<00:03:10.220> we<00:03:11.090> can't

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:11.299 
gave up too many long runs and we can't

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:12.970 
gave up too many long runs and we can't
