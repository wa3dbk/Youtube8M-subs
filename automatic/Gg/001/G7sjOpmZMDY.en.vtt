00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
since its retired it's a going for

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.520

premium<00:00:33.239> on<00:00:33.420> ebay<00:00:33.780> and<00:00:34.020> I<00:00:34.110> didn't<00:00:34.320> want<00:00:34.440> to

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
premium on ebay and I didn't want to

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
spend that much money for it so I

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.630 
spend that much money for it so I
thought<00:00:36.540> I<00:00:36.600> could<00:00:36.980> kind<00:00:37.980> of<00:00:38.100> make<00:00:38.160> something

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
thought I could kind of make something

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.330 
thought I could kind of make something
myself<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:39.360> I<00:00:39.420> had<00:00:39.600> this<00:00:39.750> boat<00:00:40.320> from<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.890> Iron

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340

Man<00:00:41.700> set<00:00:42.210> and<00:00:42.510> I<00:00:42.780> thought<00:00:43.350> that<00:00:43.500> was<00:00:43.590> about<00:00:43.739> the

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
Man set and I thought that was about the

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.299 
Man set and I thought that was about the
perfect<00:00:44.280> size<00:00:44.520> for<00:00:45.379> what<00:00:46.379> I<00:00:46.410> wanted<00:00:46.890> in<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.100> boat

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.600 
obviously I put yellow wheels on here
and<00:01:36.659> this<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:37.439> Sun<00:01:37.680> hooks<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.250> then<00:01:38.340> I<00:01:38.430> have<00:01:38.579> a

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
and this the Sun hooks and then I have a

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.920 
and this the Sun hooks and then I have a
little<00:01:40.130> kickstand<00:01:41.130> you<00:01:41.369> can<00:01:41.549> bring<00:01:42.450> out<00:01:42.630> here

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
so we'll stand up on its own it's not

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.100 
so we'll stand up on its own it's not
perfect<00:01:45.930> but<00:01:46.020> it's<00:01:46.170> something<00:01:47.270> that<00:01:48.270> show<00:01:49.049> you

the blowing this all area here is a
little<00:02:01.380> different<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:02.640> kind<00:02:03.030> of<00:02:03.090> let's<00:02:03.329> put<00:02:03.479> a

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
little different and kind of let's put a

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.449 
little different and kind of let's put a
chain<00:02:03.780> there<00:02:04.140> to<00:02:04.320> give<00:02:04.469> some<00:02:04.680> detail<00:02:05.070> and

00:02:07.449 --> 00:02:07.459 

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:11.760 

shorten<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.550> wheelbase<00:02:08.970> and<00:02:09.679> made<00:02:10.679> it

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
shorten the wheelbase and made it

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.240 
shorten the wheelbase and made it
be<00:02:12.340> like<00:02:12.550> a<00:02:12.580> true<00:02:13.330> semi<00:02:13.810> with<00:02:14.050> the<00:02:14.200> dual<00:02:14.710> axles

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
be like a true semi with the dual axles

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.540 
be like a true semi with the dual axles
back<00:02:15.490> there<00:02:16.410> here's<00:02:17.410> a<00:02:17.530> little<00:02:17.740> comparison<00:02:18.100> to

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
back there here's a little comparison to

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.510 
back there here's a little comparison to
the<00:02:18.730> one<00:02:19.240> we<00:02:19.270> just<00:02:19.390> recently<00:02:19.780> got<00:02:20.310> with<00:02:21.310> the

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
the one we just recently got with the

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:27.510 
the one we just recently got with the
race<00:02:22.420> car<00:02:23.400> transporter<00:02:24.400> truck<00:02:25.090> I<00:02:26.340> really<00:02:27.340> like

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
race car transporter truck I really like

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.980 
race car transporter truck I really like
this<00:02:27.760> trying<00:02:28.060> to<00:02:28.120> like<00:02:28.270> the<00:02:28.420> way<00:02:28.450> they<00:02:28.690> did<00:02:28.750> the

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
this trying to like the way they did the

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.470 
this trying to like the way they did the
colors<00:02:29.350> but<00:02:29.650> I<00:02:29.950> don't<00:02:30.850> know<00:02:30.910> why<00:02:31.060> they<00:02:31.210> didn't

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
colors but I don't know why they didn't

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.230 
colors but I don't know why they didn't
give<00:02:31.600> it<00:02:31.980> dual<00:02:32.980> axles<00:02:33.580> in<00:02:33.700> the<00:02:33.760> back<00:02:33.970> like<00:02:34.210> a

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240 
give it dual axles in the back like a

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.320 
give it dual axles in the back like a
real<00:02:35.050> semi<00:02:35.320> would<00:02:35.620> have<00:02:35.830> so<00:02:36.280> pretty<00:02:37.000> happy

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
real semi would have so pretty happy

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:38.760 
real semi would have so pretty happy
with<00:02:37.420> that<00:02:37.480> let's<00:02:38.170> take<00:02:38.320> a<00:02:38.380> look<00:02:38.590> at<00:02:38.650> the

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
with that let's take a look at the

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.620 
with that let's take a look at the
trailer<00:02:39.040> this<00:02:39.370> is<00:02:39.550> pretty<00:02:40.240> basic<00:02:40.480> I<00:02:41.050> did<00:02:42.630> you

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
trailer this is pretty basic I did you

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.360 
trailer this is pretty basic I did you
just<00:02:43.900> see<00:02:44.020> here<00:02:44.230> if<00:02:44.380> I<00:02:44.440> can<00:02:44.530> get<00:02:44.590> this<00:02:44.770> off<00:02:44.980> I

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
just see here if I can get this off I

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.490 
just see here if I can get this off I
did<00:02:46.150> utilize<00:02:46.750> this<00:02:47.970> pulley<00:02:48.970> system<00:02:49.540> that<00:02:49.750> came

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
did utilize this pulley system that came

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.550 
did utilize this pulley system that came
with<00:02:50.680> that<00:02:50.710> set<00:02:51.190> the<00:02:51.550> tanker<00:02:52.150> truck<00:02:52.390> so<00:02:52.630> you

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
with that set the tanker truck so you

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:54.870 
with that set the tanker truck so you
know<00:02:53.680> when<00:02:53.860> you<00:02:53.920> pull<00:02:54.130> the<00:02:54.160> boat<00:02:54.400> up<00:02:54.430> on<00:02:54.760> the

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
know when you pull the boat up on the

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.720 
know when you pull the boat up on the
ramp<00:02:55.060> then<00:02:55.420> you<00:02:55.510> got<00:02:55.690> to<00:02:56.250> crank<00:02:57.250> it<00:02:57.400> up<00:02:57.550> the

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
ramp then you got to crank it up the

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.310 
ramp then you got to crank it up the
rest<00:02:57.910> of<00:02:58.030> the<00:02:58.090> way<00:02:58.240> so<00:02:58.300> i<00:02:58.510> got<00:02:58.690> the<00:02:58.870> pulley

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
rest of the way so i got the pulley

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.210 
rest of the way so i got the pulley
there<00:02:59.650> and<00:03:00.210> just<00:03:01.210> kind<00:03:01.420> of<00:03:01.450> did<00:03:01.920> 26<00:03:02.920> wide

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
there and just kind of did 26 wide

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.700 
there and just kind of did 26 wide
plates<00:03:03.880> and<00:03:04.300> then<00:03:04.390> I<00:03:04.570> did<00:03:04.750> a<00:03:05.020> wide<00:03:05.290> in<00:03:05.440> the<00:03:05.470> back

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:05.710 
plates and then I did a wide in the back

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:07.980 
plates and then I did a wide in the back
here<00:03:06.040> so<00:03:06.250> that<00:03:06.430> I<00:03:06.640> could<00:03:07.120> tuck<00:03:07.450> those<00:03:07.660> wheels

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:07.990 
here so that I could tuck those wheels

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:11.130 
here so that I could tuck those wheels
up<00:03:08.200> underneath<00:03:08.440> there<00:03:08.740> like<00:03:08.950> a<00:03:09.450> real<00:03:10.450> semi

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
up underneath there like a real semi

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.270 
up underneath there like a real semi
truck<00:03:11.170> would<00:03:11.560> have<00:03:11.590> I<00:03:11.920> got<00:03:12.070> these<00:03:13.080> wide<00:03:14.280> lights

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
truck would have I got these wide lights

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.750 
truck would have I got these wide lights
for<00:03:16.120> like<00:03:16.270> a<00:03:16.300> wide<00:03:16.600> load<00:03:16.630> coming<00:03:17.200> through<00:03:17.760> got

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
for like a wide load coming through got

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.480 
for like a wide load coming through got
some<00:03:19.240> lights<00:03:19.890> on<00:03:20.890> the<00:03:21.100> bottom<00:03:21.520> on<00:03:22.180> the<00:03:22.360> sides<00:03:22.630> I

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:23.490 
some lights on the bottom on the sides I

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:26.100 
some lights on the bottom on the sides I
just<00:03:24.490> kind<00:03:24.700> of<00:03:24.760> use<00:03:24.940> some<00:03:25.090> of<00:03:25.180> these<00:03:25.240> round<00:03:25.690> if

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
just kind of use some of these round if

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.180 
just kind of use some of these round if
you<00:03:26.140> can<00:03:26.320> see<00:03:26.500> that<00:03:26.650> round<00:03:27.810> plate<00:03:28.810> pieces<00:03:29.350> does

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
you can see that round plate pieces does

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.210 
you can see that round plate pieces does
this<00:03:30.370> hook<00:03:30.610> right<00:03:30.790> onto<00:03:31.180> that<00:03:32.070> piece<00:03:33.070> right

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
this hook right onto that piece right

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.420 
this hook right onto that piece right
there<00:03:33.450> works<00:03:34.450> pretty<00:03:34.630> good<00:03:35.250> sorry<00:03:36.250> about<00:03:36.400> that

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
there works pretty good sorry about that

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
cut there but anyways the boat really

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.630 
cut there but anyways the boat really
fits<00:03:39.550> on<00:03:39.730> there<00:03:39.940> really<00:03:40.300> good<00:03:40.740> it<00:03:41.740> just<00:03:42.040> sits

fits on there really good it just sits

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.780 
fits on there really good it just sits
in<00:03:42.850> there<00:03:43.030> just<00:03:43.270> perfectly<00:03:43.810> and<00:03:44.430> as<00:03:45.430> you<00:03:45.640> can

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
in there just perfectly and as you can

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.320 
in there just perfectly and as you can
see<00:03:46.320> and<00:03:47.320> then<00:03:47.590> you<00:03:47.709> just<00:03:47.920> put<00:03:48.790> that<00:03:48.820> right<00:03:49.180> on

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.330 
see and then you just put that right on

see and then you just put that right on
that<00:03:49.709> line<00:03:50.709> them<00:03:50.980> up<00:03:51.280> there<00:03:51.880> and<00:03:52.260> it<00:03:53.260> rolls

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
that line them up there and it rolls

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.870 
that line them up there and it rolls
really<00:03:53.890> well<00:03:54.250> it<00:03:54.520> doesn't<00:03:54.850> bind<00:03:55.120> and<00:03:55.980> I<00:03:56.980> had

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:57.880 
really well it doesn't bind and I had

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.430 
really well it doesn't bind and I had
these<00:03:58.030> wheels<00:03:58.600> that<00:03:58.810> came<00:03:58.959> in<00:03:59.140> with<00:03:59.290> those

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
these wheels that came in with those

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.949 
these wheels that came in with those
starter<00:04:00.160> kits<00:04:00.490> with<00:04:00.700> wheels<00:04:00.970> and<00:04:01.180> tires<00:04:01.390> and<00:04:01.540> I

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
starter kits with wheels and tires and I

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:03.720 
starter kits with wheels and tires and I
think<00:04:02.470> that<00:04:02.620> looks<00:04:02.830> really<00:04:03.010> good<00:04:03.160> it<00:04:03.430> makes<00:04:03.580> it

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
think that looks really good it makes it

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:08.130 
think that looks really good it makes it
look<00:04:03.910> like<00:04:04.120> a<00:04:04.980> double<00:04:05.980> tires<00:04:06.250> back<00:04:06.580> there<00:04:07.140> like

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.140 
look like a double tires back there like

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.979 
look like a double tires back there like
