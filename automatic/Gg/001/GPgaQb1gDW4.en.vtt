00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:45.319 
to SeaWorld in San Diego and a lot of
people<00:03:44.069> think<00:03:44.310> that<00:03:44.459> they<00:03:44.639> should<00:03:44.849> let<00:03:44.970> it<00:03:45.030> go

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.329 
people think that they should let it go

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:48.470 
people think that they should let it go
you<00:03:45.989> know<00:03:46.079> it's<00:03:46.230> had<00:03:46.440> a<00:03:46.769> free<00:03:47.280> life<00:03:47.459> out<00:03:47.730> out<00:03:48.269> in

you know it's had a free life out out in
the<00:03:48.690> wild<00:03:49.380> I<00:03:49.500> think<00:03:50.069> that<00:03:50.280> we<00:03:50.549> should<00:03:50.790> keep

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:51.049 
the wild I think that we should keep

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:53.880 
the wild I think that we should keep
messy<00:03:52.049> in<00:03:52.169> captivity

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
the Loch Ness monster is inhumane I mean

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.140 
the Loch Ness monster is inhumane I mean

if it's not harming anybody that
absolutely<00:04:22.690> I<00:04:22.840> think<00:04:22.930> that<00:04:23.320> it<00:04:23.440> should<00:04:23.650> be<00:04:23.680> in

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
absolutely I think that it should be in

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.320 
absolutely I think that it should be in
it<00:04:23.980> I<00:04:24.130> mean<00:04:24.340> even<00:04:24.580> if<00:04:24.640> it<00:04:24.760> is<00:04:24.880> harming<00:04:25.150> anybody

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
it I mean even if it is harming anybody

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.270 
it I mean even if it is harming anybody
you<00:04:25.570> don't<00:04:25.780> hear<00:04:26.110> of<00:04:26.200> any<00:04:26.350> obviously<00:04:27.190> you

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
you don't hear of any obviously you

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.880 
you don't hear of any obviously you
haven't<00:04:27.550> heard<00:04:27.640> of<00:04:27.730> anybody<00:04:27.910> give<00:04:28.180> me<00:04:28.210> my<00:04:28.660> line

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:28.890 
haven't heard of anybody give me my line

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:31.920 
haven't heard of anybody give me my line
yes<00:04:29.890> I<00:04:30.190> don't<00:04:30.669> really<00:04:31.000> agree<00:04:31.270> the<00:04:31.540> fact<00:04:31.750> that

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
yes I don't really agree the fact that

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.310

they<00:04:32.020> took<00:04:32.260> it<00:04:32.410> into<00:04:32.980> I<00:04:33.840> don't<00:04:34.840> know<00:04:34.900> I<00:04:34.930> think

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
they took it into I don't know I think

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.520

whatever it is
Nessie<00:05:07.330> you<00:05:07.840> think<00:05:08.020> it<00:05:08.110> should<00:05:08.229> be<00:05:08.260> set<00:05:08.560> free

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:08.830 
Nessie you think it should be set free

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:10.680 
Nessie you think it should be set free
into<00:05:09.220> the<00:05:09.340> wild<00:05:09.700> or<00:05:09.850> do<00:05:09.940> you<00:05:10.240> think<00:05:10.270> that<00:05:10.479> it's

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:10.690 
into the wild or do you think that it's

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:12.510 
into the wild or do you think that it's
right<00:05:10.930> to<00:05:11.169> keep<00:05:11.380> Nessie<00:05:11.830> kept<00:05:12.100> in<00:05:12.280> captivity

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
right to keep Nessie kept in captivity

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.790 
right to keep Nessie kept in captivity
like<00:05:13.240> oh<00:05:13.360> it's<00:05:13.540> not<00:05:13.690> right<00:05:13.900> it's<00:05:14.140> not<00:05:14.229> right

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 
like oh it's not right it's not right
