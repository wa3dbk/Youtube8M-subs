here<00:03:07.720> you<00:03:13.830> know<00:03:14.830> the<00:03:15.040> concepts<00:03:15.430> actually

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
here you know the concepts actually

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.130 
here you know the concepts actually
really<00:03:15.910> good<00:03:16.000> idea<00:03:16.270> uses<00:03:16.570> for<00:03:16.720> connect<00:03:16.960> it

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
really good idea uses for connect it

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.330 
really good idea uses for connect it
just<00:03:17.290> kind<00:03:17.470> of<00:03:17.500> makes<00:03:17.620> sense<00:03:17.800> that<00:03:18.070> we<00:03:18.160> drink

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
just kind of makes sense that we drink

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:28.470 
just kind of makes sense that we drink
