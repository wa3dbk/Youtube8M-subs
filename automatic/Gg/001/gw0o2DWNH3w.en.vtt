00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.210
 [Music] 

00:00:05.229 --> 00:00:09.410
 to prepare this cod 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.990
 Vicenza 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:16.850
 we need 400 grams of cod 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:20.780
 of norway 200 g of onions 3 anchovies 200 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:23.980
 ml of milk 100 g of flour 50 g of 

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:26.930
 chopped parsley Parmesan cheese 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:29.840
 extra virgin salt and of course love 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:33.350
 it is polenta then if you don't like it used 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:36.170
 the bread but I can give you no look is 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.610
 come decidedly to feel them inside me 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.399
 you put the polenta I put 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.320
 of oil in which you know alfano sail 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:46.610
 creamy and rices don't do it we understand 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:49.460
 however there is too much water it increases by 3 says 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.170
 want the valent to the pastis a little less 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.360
 ok by the time but in the 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.280
 sink I can play it open toh 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:01:02.690
 I look I move for a moment so you 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:04.820
 all by itself don't do it from museums or that 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.070
 they make a little soft as they do 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.630
 their own because their friuli 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:14.210
 they make polenta that are so hard 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:17.330
 by put on I'm counting for 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:20.650
 answer him I'm counting it's okay by 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:25.670
 in the meantime, mince the rizzo onion 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:29.450
 then he fears chopped onions instead 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:36.830
 because I saute with oil e 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:39.080
 the chopped onion is fine according to me it is 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:42.239
 little that water that does 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.239
 [Music] 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:48.899
 but you do n't have to do them for the regiment but 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.610
 look how many we are here today look at 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:55.500
 away where I make the polenta I mica in a 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:57.780
 so I know, though, eat it afterwards 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:02.670
 he already knows about josé here then there is always 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:04.590
 someone who remains frank 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.060
 I can put in the fire that so 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.860
 you don't see the whole pan from here 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.870
 naughty dog ​​much less extraordinary spy 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:14.370
 reason look with so much I have to give too 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.950
 in but you have not made all the flour 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:20.220
 wait a moment before because you have 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:23.370
 all stopped here that's why all 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.890
 this concern waits a moment because 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.540
 I like polenta vabbè is triggered 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.420
 maximum penalty I realize if it was 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:33.060
 enough that promise while well to 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.549
 reason meanwhile put the oil in the 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:41.670
 pan we also put the onion 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:43.860
 chopped to fry and together with 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:47.400
 Chopped school let's melt too 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:52.530
 free anchovies so we press a 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:55.470
 easy wooden spoon anchovies it 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:03:00.269
 stockfish and what is dried 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:02.609
 and it is not as salty cod and 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:04.739
 what is salty 

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:06.480
 in fact it says you are caring as our co is 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:09.510
 as hard as stockfish is that is 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.950
 dry dried from stock does not see it 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:15.420
 stick 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:17.040
 I have floured the cod instead and 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.959
 I put it in the sauce because it is 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.690
 off the fire under the cricket spain 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:23.910
 never pushed that my I am thinking of 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.250
 my stoves and so I think it is 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.400
 off that I may have but wait for that 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:31.680
 I'm doing the wrong one 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:34.120
 that's it done look at post party yes 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.220
 leave to the maximum 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:40.290
 now, yes, there is a fear that it will be 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.290
 let's fry well thanks 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.440
 here I am now when I did it 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.569
 actually fry well then not after 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:50.049
 it's that you have to continually mix it 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:53.140
 in fact you just have to just spin it 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:55.120
 the pan because otherwise it tends to unravel 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.680
 however it already tends to melt too much 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.500
 it is because it is a cooking that enough 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:02.170
 long this then at this point I 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:09.160
 you know what i add now a bit of 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:12.549
 chopped parsley a little big too 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:16.079
 here you see in the comments at the end a little 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:16.079
 yes it is a bit even now 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:30.850
 here is the milk in the meantime to cover it and the 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:32.410
 parmesan or grana and now we leave it 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.729
 cook and you naturally have 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:36.970
 prepared this bacalà alla vicentina 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:39.039
 today with this cod codfish that 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:41.410
 you have heard exists in two 

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:44.169
 so different forms that the stockfish 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:46.479
 which is the wrought dry one that launches 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:48.220
 hydrated for a few days is before 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:51.639
 be used therefore wet etc. 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:53.620
 or else there is the preserved one 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:55.539
 in salt that should be left in anyway 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:58.210
 water this too washed and let in 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:05:01.660
 cold water because it has to go up yes 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:02.770
 otherwise it's too salty here is one 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.479
 it is called another bacchanal 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:06.550
 stocafisso but in reality it is the same thing 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:08.650
 but there is the difference because yes 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:10.660
 presents and is preserved in a manner 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.039
 I try not to sell other than their own 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.060
 product that comes from norway 

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:16.520
 so surely 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:18.230
 the most guaranteed product this is one 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.700
 of the recipes we proposed but if 

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:23.810
 you want others, maybe there is 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:26.540
 same north which is the company that makes us 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:28.490
 get this good on the cod that you 

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:31.220
 I recommend going to a website www fior 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:33.410
 of flavors punto.it if I'm not mistaken 6 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:34.730
 point the disagreements point the pounds 

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:36.470
 you will find lots of other recipes from 

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:37.639
 prepare your own with baccalauro 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:38.350
 in short, capisso depends on 

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:41.300
 Preparation 

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:44.150
 look at how it can be presented to you 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:48.800
 table this this dish 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:52.990
 belongs to a long tradition of 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.990
 Venetian cuisine I will taste all together 

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:59.800
 I mean one must do a sin 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.800
 he must do it well
