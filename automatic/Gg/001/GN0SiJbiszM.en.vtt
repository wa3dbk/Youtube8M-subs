any given time it's kind of cool there's

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.020 
any given time it's kind of cool there's
this<00:04:59.560> info<00:04:59.980> tab<00:05:00.190> that<00:05:00.400> we've<00:05:00.550> already<00:05:00.700> kind<00:05:00.910> of

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:01.030 
this info tab that we've already kind of

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:02.160 
this info tab that we've already kind of
been<00:05:01.210> through<00:05:01.390> just<00:05:01.510> kind<00:05:01.750> of<00:05:01.780> show<00:05:01.930> let's<00:05:02.050> do

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:02.170 
been through just kind of show let's do

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:03.930 
been through just kind of show let's do
some<00:05:02.320> basic<00:05:02.590> information<00:05:03.040> and<00:05:03.520> then<00:05:03.730> there's

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:03.940 
some basic information and then there's

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:08.610 
some basic information and then there's
the<00:05:04.150> map<00:05:04.450> which<00:05:05.020> give<00:05:05.410> me<00:05:05.500> just

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:08.620

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:16.720 
bad um so here we go on the map feature

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.450 
bad um so here we go on the map feature
on<00:05:17.720> that<00:05:18.050> feature<00:05:18.259> these<00:05:18.590> are<00:05:18.710> actual<00:05:19.039> pins

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:19.460 
on that feature these are actual pins

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:21.730 
on that feature these are actual pins
that<00:05:19.820> are<00:05:19.880> people's<00:05:20.509> tags<00:05:20.780> from<00:05:21.080> all<00:05:21.320> over<00:05:21.530> the

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:42.889 
lot of tags that are there so what you

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:45.520 
lot of tags that are there so what you
want<00:05:43.220> to<00:05:43.280> do<00:05:43.370> is<00:05:43.490> pinch<00:05:43.669> to<00:05:43.759> zoom<00:05:43.789> this<00:05:44.330> I<00:05:44.720> had<00:05:45.500> a

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:45.530 
want to do is pinch to zoom this I had a

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:48.100 
want to do is pinch to zoom this I had a
lot<00:05:45.680> of<00:05:45.740> apps<00:05:45.979> that<00:05:46.190> have<00:05:46.900> GM<00:05:47.900> epping

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:48.110 
lot of apps that have GM epping

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:49.510 
lot of apps that have GM epping
functions<00:05:48.470> that<00:05:48.560> don't<00:05:48.830> work<00:05:49.099> this<00:05:49.220> bowl<00:05:49.430> in

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:49.520 
functions that don't work this bowl in

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.439 
functions that don't work this bowl in
them<00:05:49.639> so<00:05:49.759> I'm<00:05:49.880> really<00:05:50.690> impressed<00:05:51.110> by<00:05:51.410> the

00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:52.449 
them so I'm really impressed by the

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:56.080 
them so I'm really impressed by the
precision<00:05:53.449> and<00:05:53.750> by<00:05:54.229> the<00:05:54.830> ease<00:05:55.220> of<00:05:55.250> use<00:05:55.849> with

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:56.090 
precision and by the ease of use with

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:57.999 
precision and by the ease of use with
the<00:05:56.240> mapping<00:05:56.539> tool<00:05:56.720> just<00:05:57.020> saying<00:05:57.229> so<00:05:57.770> when<00:05:57.919> you

00:05:57.999 --> 00:05:58.009 
the mapping tool just saying so when you

00:05:58.009 --> 00:05:59.860 
the mapping tool just saying so when you
find<00:05:58.220> a<00:05:58.310> red<00:05:58.490> dot<00:05:58.699> it<00:05:58.940> means<00:05:59.180> you<00:05:59.300> can<00:05:59.419> stop<00:05:59.690> on

00:05:59.860 --> 00:05:59.870 
find a red dot it means you can stop on

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:01.250 
find a red dot it means you can stop on
to<00:05:59.990> see<00:06:00.169> it

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:01.260 
to see it

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.350 
to see it
you<00:06:02.010> give<00:06:02.220> it<00:06:02.310> a<00:06:02.370> second<00:06:02.700> and<00:06:02.850> there's<00:06:03.180> that

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.360 
you give it a second and there's that

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.870 
you give it a second and there's that
tag<00:06:03.630> so<00:06:04.470> they<00:06:04.620> made<00:06:04.830> that<00:06:05.010> tag<00:06:05.280> and<00:06:05.640> they<00:06:05.700> put

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:05.880 
tag so they made that tag and they put

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:06.980 
tag so they made that tag and they put
it<00:06:05.970> up<00:06:06.060> there<00:06:06.090> they<00:06:06.360> put<00:06:06.540> up<00:06:06.630> there<00:06:06.750> for<00:06:06.870> us<00:06:06.960> to

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:06.990 
it up there they put up there for us to

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:10.010 
it up there they put up there for us to
share<00:06:07.460> and<00:06:08.460> that's<00:06:08.730> how<00:06:08.970> yours<00:06:09.390> are<00:06:09.600> show<00:06:09.810> up

share and that's how yours are show up
wherever<00:06:10.530> you<00:06:10.950> tag<00:06:11.220> in<00:06:11.700> the<00:06:11.910> future<00:06:12.210> so<00:06:12.660> again

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:12.840 
wherever you tag in the future so again

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:13.850 
wherever you tag in the future so again
these<00:06:12.930> are<00:06:12.990> purple<00:06:13.380> ones<00:06:13.530> which<00:06:13.650> means

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:19.350 
zoom and we'll get in here and

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:21.710 
zoom and we'll get in here and
we'll<00:06:19.530> see<00:06:20.100> some<00:06:20.130> stuff<00:06:20.730> all<00:06:21.060> right<00:06:21.270> so<00:06:21.570> now<00:06:21.660> we
