one in after i did a water change
earlier<00:03:10.959> this<00:03:11.170> week<00:03:11.410> so<00:03:11.940> water<00:03:12.940> is<00:03:13.060> pretty

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
earlier this week so water is pretty

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.560 
earlier this week so water is pretty
clear<00:03:14.019> I<00:03:14.290> kind<00:03:14.800> of<00:03:14.890> like<00:03:15.070> it<00:03:15.100> this<00:03:15.400> way<00:03:15.610> not

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570 
clear I kind of like it this way not

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.289 
clear I kind of like it this way not
sure<00:03:16.780> if<00:03:16.900> I'm<00:03:17.050> going<00:03:17.110> to<00:03:17.320> go<00:03:17.410> back<00:03:18.299> using

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
sure if I'm going to go back using

mundian almond needs the pressurized
system<00:03:23.049> stone<00:03:23.470> well<00:03:23.739> I've<00:03:24.579> got<00:03:24.640> that<00:03:25.030> running

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
system stone well I've got that running

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:29.130 
system stone well I've got that running
and<00:03:25.600> a<00:03:25.840> decent<00:03:26.110> rate<00:03:27.480> scarlet<00:03:28.480> baddies<00:03:28.840> are

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
and a decent rate scarlet baddies are

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:35.780 
and a decent rate scarlet baddies are
doing<00:03:30.130> quite<00:03:30.250> well<00:03:30.630> got<00:03:31.630> some<00:03:31.810> great<00:03:31.989> colors

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.170 

we<00:03:36.790> talked<00:03:36.970> my<00:03:37.180> wallets<00:03:37.600> all<00:03:37.810> pinned<00:03:38.709> up<00:03:38.860> now

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
we talked my wallets all pinned up now

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.240 
we talked my wallets all pinned up now
not<00:03:40.180> sure<00:03:40.360> if<00:03:40.450> we<00:03:40.540> can<00:03:40.570> see<00:03:40.930> the<00:03:41.140> stream<00:03:42.100> of

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
not sure if we can see the stream of

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.580 
not sure if we can see the stream of
bubbles<00:03:42.630> coming<00:03:43.630> up<00:03:43.690> from<00:03:43.840> the<00:03:43.900> diffuser<00:03:44.320> but

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
bubbles coming up from the diffuser but

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.910 
bubbles coming up from the diffuser but
I<00:03:44.620> have<00:03:44.799> it<00:03:44.920> coming<00:03:45.130> out<00:03:45.340> right<00:03:45.670> below<00:03:46.239> the

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
I have it coming out right below the

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.920 
I have it coming out right below the
filter<00:03:47.920> output<00:03:48.160> I<00:03:48.670> mean<00:03:49.209> I<00:03:49.420> was<00:03:49.660> thinking

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
filter output I mean I was thinking

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.840 
filter output I mean I was thinking
about<00:03:50.079> putting<00:03:50.290> it<00:03:50.500> below<00:03:50.950> the<00:03:51.100> filter<00:03:51.400> intake

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
about putting it below the filter intake

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.020 
about putting it below the filter intake
so<00:03:52.090> the<00:03:52.480> impeller<00:03:52.780> chops<00:03:53.170> up<00:03:53.320> the<00:03:53.400> bubbles<00:03:54.400> and

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
so the impeller chops up the bubbles and

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:56.670 
so the impeller chops up the bubbles and
I<00:03:55.120> decided<00:03:55.450> I'm<00:03:55.690> i<00:03:55.840> might<00:03:56.170> as<00:03:56.290> well<00:03:56.380> try<00:03:56.560> this

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
I decided I'm i might as well try this

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.560 
I decided I'm i might as well try this
and<00:03:57.130> place<00:03:57.310> it<00:03:57.489> right<00:03:57.519> into<00:03:57.820> the<00:03:57.910> output<00:03:58.360> and

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.570 
and place it right into the output and

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.780 
and place it right into the output and
the<00:03:58.720> actual<00:03:59.140> output<00:03:59.530> is<00:03:59.920> taking<00:04:00.280> the<00:04:00.400> bubbles

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
the actual output is taking the bubbles

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.380 
the actual output is taking the bubbles
and<00:04:01.829> distributing<00:04:02.829> it<00:04:03.010> throughout<00:04:03.579> the<00:04:03.700> tank

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:04.390 
and distributing it throughout the tank

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.130 
and distributing it throughout the tank
so<00:04:04.600> I<00:04:04.690> think<00:04:04.810> that's<00:04:05.110> working<00:04:05.560> pretty<00:04:05.739> well

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
so I think that's working pretty well

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.230 
so I think that's working pretty well
this<00:04:08.140> is<00:04:08.319> the<00:04:08.470> area<00:04:08.650> that<00:04:08.830> the<00:04:09.250> mq<00:04:09.850> wasn't

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:10.240 
this is the area that the mq wasn't

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:13.199 
this is the area that the mq wasn't
doing<00:04:10.510> all<00:04:10.630> that<00:04:10.780> grade<00:04:11.140> in<00:04:11.319> so<00:04:11.709> I<00:04:12.040> took<00:04:12.700> some

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:13.209 
doing all that grade in so I took some

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:17.670 
doing all that grade in so I took some
of<00:04:13.240> the<00:04:13.860> healthier<00:04:14.860> areas<00:04:15.610> or<00:04:16.570> healthier<00:04:17.200> mq

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
of the healthier areas or healthier mq

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.280 
of the healthier areas or healthier mq
from<00:04:18.010> other<00:04:18.400> areas<00:04:18.760> and<00:04:19.120> placed<00:04:19.810> a<00:04:19.959> few<00:04:20.109> there

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:20.290 
from other areas and placed a few there

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:24.600 
from other areas and placed a few there
to<00:04:20.440> hopefully<00:04:20.620> get<00:04:21.250> it<00:04:21.310> to<00:04:21.459> spread<00:04:21.730> out<00:04:23.610> this

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
to hopefully get it to spread out this

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.700 
to hopefully get it to spread out this
is<00:04:24.790> also<00:04:24.940> why<00:04:25.180> it's<00:04:25.360> called<00:04:25.540> four-leaf<00:04:26.290> clover

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
is also why it's called four-leaf clover

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.570 
is also why it's called four-leaf clover
sometimes<00:04:27.430> you'll<00:04:27.669> get<00:04:27.850> the<00:04:29.190> different<00:04:30.190> lobed

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
sometimes you'll get the different lobed

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.020 
sometimes you'll get the different lobed
or<00:04:30.970> a<00:04:31.330> different<00:04:31.810> number<00:04:32.350> of<00:04:32.380> lobes<00:04:32.740> that<00:04:33.070> that

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
or a different number of lobes that that

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.250 
or a different number of lobes that that
one's<00:04:34.180> got<00:04:34.360> two<00:04:34.570> out<00:04:34.840> and<00:04:35.020> obviously<00:04:35.740> as<00:04:35.919> for

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
one's got two out and obviously as for

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.170 
one's got two out and obviously as for
there's<00:04:38.260> one<00:04:38.440> that<00:04:38.590> I<00:04:38.710> had<00:04:38.800> three<00:04:39.070> before<00:04:39.460> not

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180 
there's one that I had three before not

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.970 
there's one that I had three before not
sure<00:04:40.330> where<00:04:40.480> that<00:04:40.510> one<00:04:40.780> is<00:04:40.810> but<00:04:41.200> uh<00:04:41.230> it<00:04:41.919> looks

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:41.980 
sure where that one is but uh it looks

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:46.950 
sure where that one is but uh it looks
pretty<00:04:42.220> cool<00:04:42.370> that<00:04:42.730> way<00:04:45.510> I'll<00:04:46.510> go<00:04:46.690> click
