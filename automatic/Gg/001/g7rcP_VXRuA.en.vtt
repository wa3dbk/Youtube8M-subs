been a few hours ago but it could have

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.639 
been a few hours ago but it could have
been<00:00:53.789> weeks<00:00:54.059> come<00:00:54.449> to<00:00:54.539> think<00:00:54.780> of<00:00:54.870> it<00:00:54.989> with<00:00:55.469> this

electronic<00:00:56.250> Marvel<00:00:57.090> were<00:00:57.210> involved<00:00:57.690> in<00:00:58.160> we

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
electronic Marvel were involved in we

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.040 
electronic Marvel were involved in we
were<00:00:59.250> talking<00:00:59.550> about<00:00:59.609> reel<00:01:00.420> spinning<00:01:00.750> and

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
were talking about reel spinning and

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.599 
were talking about reel spinning and
turns<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.770> we<00:01:01.829> were<00:01:01.920> trying<00:01:02.070> to<00:01:02.219> find<00:01:02.430> ways

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
turns and we were trying to find ways

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.660 
turns and we were trying to find ways
that<00:01:02.910> we<00:01:02.969> can<00:01:03.439> spin<00:01:04.439> with<00:01:04.710> both<00:01:05.100> of<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.400> staffs

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
that we can spin with both of the staffs

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.510 
that we can spin with both of the staffs
going<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.150> same<00:01:06.390> direction<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:07.400> turn<00:01:08.400> our

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
going the same direction and turn our

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.350 
going the same direction and turn our
bodies<00:01:08.820> 180<00:01:09.330> degrees<00:01:09.689> in<00:01:10.200> order<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:11.240> spin<00:01:12.240> the

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
bodies 180 degrees in order to spin the

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.460 
bodies 180 degrees in order to spin the
other<00:01:12.390> way<00:01:12.540> okay<00:01:14.240> so<00:01:15.240> all<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.720> turns<00:01:16.080> involve

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
other way okay so all the turns involve

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.190 
other way okay so all the turns involve
a<00:01:17.180> change<00:01:18.180> in<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.450> direction<00:01:18.540> of<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:18.990> staff

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
a change in the direction of the staff

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.649 
a change in the direction of the staff
to<00:01:19.229> you<00:01:19.729> but<00:01:20.729> they<00:01:20.820> look<00:01:21.030> like<00:01:21.150> they<00:01:21.299> continue

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
to you but they look like they continue

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.359 
to you but they look like they continue
saying<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.020> same<00:01:22.170> way<00:01:22.320> so<00:01:22.380> you<00:01:22.560> just<00:01:22.890> allow

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
saying the same way so you just allow

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.910 
saying the same way so you just allow
them<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.820> continue<00:01:24.180> going<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:24.960> same<00:01:25.140> way<00:01:25.170> both

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
them to continue going the same way both

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.130 
them to continue going the same way both

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
start to try to chain them together so

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:21.070 
start to try to chain them together so
we<00:02:04.190> have<00:02:04.450> 1<00:02:05.450> 2<00:02:07.360> 1<00:02:13.990> 1<00:02:14.990> 2<00:02:15.709> 3<00:02:17.350> ok<00:02:19.690> same<00:02:20.690> thing<00:02:20.720> can

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
we have 1 2 1 1 2 3 ok same thing can

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.670 
we have 1 2 1 1 2 3 ok same thing can
happen<00:02:21.260> with<00:02:21.440> our<00:02:22.070> half<00:02:23.030> beats<00:02:23.440> so<00:02:24.440> if<00:02:24.530> you're

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
happen with our half beats so if you're

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.910 
happen with our half beats so if you're
spinning<00:02:24.890> both<00:02:25.280> sticks<00:02:26.000> the<00:02:26.180> same<00:02:26.420> direction

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
spinning both sticks the same direction

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.590 
spinning both sticks the same direction
in<00:02:27.920> this<00:02:28.130> sort<00:02:28.340> of<00:02:28.430> reel<00:02:28.970> spinning

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
in this sort of reel spinning

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.260 
in this sort of reel spinning
I<00:02:29.709> guess<00:02:30.709> one<00:02:30.950> hand<00:02:31.190> my<00:02:31.520> right<00:02:31.700> hand<00:02:31.910> is<00:02:32.030> going

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
I guess one hand my right hand is going

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.930 
I guess one hand my right hand is going
in<00:02:32.390> a<00:02:32.480> forward<00:02:33.370> butterfly<00:02:34.370> my<00:02:34.580> left<00:02:34.730> hand<00:02:34.880> is

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
in a forward butterfly my left hand is

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:35.710 
in a forward butterfly my left hand is
going<00:02:35.090> in<00:02:35.209> Reverse

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
going in Reverse

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.320 
going in Reverse
but<00:02:35.959> during<00:02:36.110> the<00:02:36.260> reels<00:02:36.520> so<00:02:37.520> the<00:02:37.640> reels<00:02:37.850> one

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
but during the reels so the reels one

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:43.210 
but during the reels so the reels one
half<00:02:38.540> is<00:02:38.750> in<00:02:38.870> front<00:02:39.140> one<00:02:39.410> half<00:02:39.620> is<00:02:39.770> behind<00:02:42.220> that

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
half is in front one half is behind that

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.680 
half is in front one half is behind that
you<00:02:43.310> can<00:02:43.489> apply<00:02:43.790> this<00:02:43.850> same<00:02:44.300> sort<00:02:44.570> of

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
you can apply this same sort of

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.020 
you can apply this same sort of
principle<00:02:45.200> to<00:02:45.350> turning<00:02:45.769> just<00:02:46.370> by<00:02:46.519> taking<00:02:46.730> a

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
principle to turning just by taking a

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:52.060 
principle to turning just by taking a
hundred<00:02:47.540> eighty<00:02:47.630> degrees<00:02:47.959> step<00:02:50.680> so<00:02:51.680> I<00:02:51.709> still

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
hundred eighty degrees step so I still

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.400 
hundred eighty degrees step so I still
have<00:02:52.340> the<00:02:52.820> thumb<00:02:53.330> with<00:02:53.570> a<00:02:53.600> head<00:02:53.870> ends<00:02:54.200> that's

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
have the thumb with a head ends that's

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.770 
have the thumb with a head ends that's
the<00:02:54.620> red<00:02:54.980> end<00:02:55.190> of<00:02:55.280> the<00:02:55.340> stick<00:02:55.640> they're<00:02:56.450> staying

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
the red end of the stick they're staying

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:05.580 
the red end of the stick they're staying
still<00:02:57.140> in<00:02:57.290> front<00:02:57.620> of<00:02:57.739> my<00:02:57.920> body

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:12.030 

okay<00:03:09.150> you<00:03:10.150> can<00:03:10.300> do<00:03:10.390> the<00:03:10.480> same<00:03:10.660> thing<00:03:10.959> in<00:03:11.200> split

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
okay you can do the same thing in split

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.309 
okay you can do the same thing in split
time<00:03:12.330> so<00:03:13.330> let's<00:03:13.540> say<00:03:13.690> you've<00:03:13.840> got<00:03:13.870> both<00:03:14.230> of

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 
time so let's say you've got both of

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:18.780 
time so let's say you've got both of
them<00:03:14.530> going<00:03:15.060> forward<00:03:16.709> I'm<00:03:17.709> split<00:03:18.129> timing<00:03:18.580> both

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
them going forward I'm split timing both

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.750 
them going forward I'm split timing both
of<00:03:18.970> my<00:03:19.530> heads<00:03:20.530> of<00:03:20.709> the<00:03:20.800> stabs<00:03:21.069> the<00:03:21.340> read<00:03:21.550> ends

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
of my heads of the stabs the read ends

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.699 
of my heads of the stabs the read ends
and<00:03:21.879> the<00:03:21.940> stabs<00:03:22.180> are<00:03:22.390> staying<00:03:22.629> in<00:03:22.780> front<00:03:23.019> and

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
and the stabs are staying in front and

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:24.869 
and the stabs are staying in front and
I'm<00:03:23.799> just<00:03:23.950> going<00:03:24.069> to<00:03:24.160> turn<00:03:24.340> on<00:03:24.519> hundred<00:03:24.760> eighty

00:03:24.869 --> 00:03:24.879 
I'm just going to turn on hundred eighty

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:28.770 
I'm just going to turn on hundred eighty
degrees<00:03:25.920> and<00:03:26.920> go<00:03:27.040> the<00:03:27.190> other<00:03:27.280> way<00:03:27.400> again<00:03:28.360> if<00:03:28.569> it

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
degrees and go the other way again if it

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.240 
degrees and go the other way again if it
feels<00:03:28.989> a<00:03:29.080> little<00:03:29.140> awkward<00:03:29.349> to<00:03:29.680> you<00:03:29.739> drop<00:03:30.010> one

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
feels a little awkward to you drop one

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.910 
feels a little awkward to you drop one
