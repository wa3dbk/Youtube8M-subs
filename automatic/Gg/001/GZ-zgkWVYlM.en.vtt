 emilia experience for the clip 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:54.430
 or the pigeon is basically doing is like 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.830
 a mix is ​​to make a mortal for 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.229
 on top of a wall and make a pine by 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:01.629
 above a wall then basically 

00:00:58.229 --> 00:01:02.620
 to start you get to the wall and put the 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:03.970
 hands 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.130
 you have to remember to be able hands 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.110
 directed because you have to have more 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.540
 directed not to fall on the wall because 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.479
 if you go like that, maybe you fall down then 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.619
 chosen hands you support on the wall and of 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:17.320
 there what you have to do is launch 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:20.070
 the legs above and pass them to 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.780
 other side that's the theory then 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.280
 you can basically think it is 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.040
 hands and paste a face sign 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.770
 in front or put your hands up pine 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.720
 and go down to the other side with speed 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.800
 there is a different way that they do 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.720
 some people that is 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.090
 more considers it more as a mortal 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.490
 for ahead then it is fixed a lot in 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.590
 put your hands and throw the pine and 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.420
 then you lose already it is not a pigeon 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.610
 but it is a mortal touching the wall there 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.440
 people who come running they touch and they do 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.140
 to show palante that would not be the pigeon 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.660
 but if you do not want to do like that, we do 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.310
 but good the one that supposedly 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.840
 it should be done is that is bad 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.100
 brigid yes 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.100
 we remove lime for forward 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.090
 klein 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.330
 definition 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.050
 or something 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.260
 let's put security if you can have the 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:32.290
 another side of the sand or grass wall 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.820
 perfect even tuning then 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.280
 remember you have to get to the wall and 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:38.740
 place your hands so that they are 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.020
 forward or slightly sideways 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:43.180
 as more comfortable and from there 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:45.850
 we lower the body a bit with our hands 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.230
 weaved by force and from there 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.060
 you can be elected to throw the 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.890
 legs then what they have to do 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.960
 the pajamas is you come running and 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.960
 normally one leg goes and then the 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:58.360
 another for example when it does fix 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:01.000
 one leg and then the other what it does 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:03.460
 is to arrive running supports the hands of 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.650
 rigid form flexes it lowers the body 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:07.240
 and that's when throwing the legs 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.530
 he threw one first and then the other little 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.880
 there are few people who throw both at 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:13.450
 time because it's a bit uncomfortable then 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:15.010
 it's getting to throw the legs and then 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:19.110
 jump the body and from there basically 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.110
 you pass to the other side doing the cairo 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.440
 and 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.800
 i 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:06.800
 in my mind 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:13.460
 at the moment Danish leif ove if I am 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.460
 different 

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:22.190
 Well basically it does not have much more 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:24.310
 remember to put your hands push the 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:27.460
 body up and foot water bottle more 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:29.960
 you can think it's like pine 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:32.150
 put on pine and then move on to the other 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.800
 side how to make a pine bridge where 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:35.720
 put more more of the soil and pass the feet 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:38.810
 and we can of the ground but on a wall and 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:41.320
 from there you pass your legs to the other side 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:41.320
 ah 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:46.950
 Well, basically this is being 

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:48.810
 everything for the tutorial I hope that I have 

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:53.240

 subscribe and pass it friends either for 

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:00.410
 forward or backward
