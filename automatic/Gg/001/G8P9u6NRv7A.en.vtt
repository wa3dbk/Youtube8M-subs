show you guys a strategy that using my

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.700 
show you guys a strategy that using my
product<00:00:05.490> neck<00:00:05.750> so<00:00:06.750> the<00:00:06.870> main<00:00:07.049> nice<00:00:07.259> strategy<00:00:07.500> i

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
product neck so the main nice strategy i

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.040 
product neck so the main nice strategy i
use<00:00:07.950> or<00:00:08.340> one<00:00:08.730> of<00:00:08.760> the<00:00:08.970> main<00:00:09.150> strategies<00:00:09.540> uses

use or one of the main strategies uses

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.499 
use or one of the main strategies uses
is<00:00:10.230> so<00:00:10.380> many<00:00:10.620> wetlands<00:00:11.120> try<00:00:12.120> to<00:00:12.179> get<00:00:12.330> one

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
is so many wetlands try to get one

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.840 
level them in area B this is new to my
deck<00:02:16.590> I'm<00:02:17.590> not<00:02:17.710> really<00:02:17.980> new<00:02:18.100> I<00:02:18.280> think<00:02:18.460> I<00:02:18.550> add<00:02:18.670> in

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
deck I'm not really new I think I add in

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.180 
deck I'm not really new I think I add in
the<00:02:19.000> last<00:02:19.180> update<00:02:19.510> but<00:02:20.500> yeah<00:02:20.620> it<00:02:20.740> really<00:02:20.830> helps

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
the last update but yeah it really helps

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.550 
the last update but yeah it really helps
out<00:02:21.340> because<00:02:21.730> you<00:02:22.000> can<00:02:22.150> attack<00:02:22.450> with<00:02:23.410> your

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
out because you can attack with your

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.820 
out because you can attack with your
submarine<00:02:23.950> frogs<00:02:25.320> while<00:02:26.320> your<00:02:26.470> opponent

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
submarine frogs while your opponent

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.230 
submarine frogs while your opponent
cannot<00:02:26.890> attack<00:02:27.280> unless<00:02:27.580> they<00:02:27.880> have<00:02:27.970> in<00:02:28.150> the

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
cannot attack unless they have in the

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.620 
cannot attack unless they have in the
monster<00:02:28.660> that's<00:02:29.320> a<00:02:29.440> level<00:02:29.680> 3<00:02:29.970> over<00:02:30.970> 2,400

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
monster that's a level 3 over 2,400

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.390 
monster that's a level 3 over 2,400
attack<00:02:31.810> that's<00:02:32.290> I<00:02:32.590> don't<00:02:32.650> think<00:02:32.980> that<00:02:33.010> they

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
attack that's I don't think that they

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.370 
attack that's I don't think that they
have<00:02:33.430> one<00:02:33.730> of<00:02:33.820> those<00:02:33.940> so<00:02:34.810> yeah<00:02:35.080> it's<00:02:35.260> really

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
have one of those so yeah it's really

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.180 
have one of those so yeah it's really
useful<00:02:35.590> mistake<00:02:36.570> when<00:02:37.570> you<00:02:37.600> are<00:02:37.950> same<00:02:38.950> thing

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
useful mistake when you are same thing

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.130 
useful mistake when you are same thing
goes<00:02:39.220> for<00:02:39.400> gravity<00:02:39.940> binds<00:02:40.240> it's<00:02:40.570> like<00:02:40.780> the

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
goes for gravity binds it's like the

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.230 
goes for gravity binds it's like the
same<00:02:41.350> effect<00:02:41.710> as<00:02:41.800> levels<00:02:42.130> in<00:02:42.250> it<00:02:42.370> except<00:02:43.090> they

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:43.240 
same effect as levels in it except they

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.790 
same effect as levels in it except they
don't<00:02:43.330> go<00:02:43.480> into<00:02:43.510> fence<00:02:43.930> and<00:02:44.230> it's<00:02:44.530> a<00:02:44.590> truck

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
don't go into fence and it's a truck

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.590 
don't go into fence and it's a truck
word<00:02:47.190> now<00:02:48.190> let's<00:02:48.370> try<00:02:48.490> to<00:02:48.550> get<00:02:48.730> uses<00:02:49.180> them<00:02:49.420> I

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
word now let's try to get uses them I

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.760 
word now let's try to get uses them I
just<00:02:49.870> put<00:02:50.020> a<00:02:50.050> geometry<00:02:50.290> on<00:02:50.590> my<00:02:50.710> deck<00:02:52.770> this

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
just put a geometry on my deck this

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.590 
just put a geometry on my deck this
helps<00:02:54.040> out<00:02:54.160> with<00:02:54.280> those<00:02:54.460> swarming<00:02:54.970> decks<00:02:55.180> I

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600

00:05:39.189 --> 00:05:39.199 
are like let's say wetlands is on the

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:41.860 
are like let's say wetlands is on the
field<00:05:39.409> or<00:05:39.529> something<00:05:39.849> they<00:05:40.849> could<00:05:41.000> be<00:05:41.089> 1,300

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:41.870 
field or something they could be 1,300

attack<00:05:42.159> and<00:05:43.159> that<00:05:43.370> the<00:05:43.460> fields<00:05:43.819> open<00:05:44.110> by<00:05:45.110> desk

00:05:45.369 --> 00:05:45.379 
attack and that the fields open by desk

00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:48.610 
attack and that the fields open by desk
croaking<00:05:45.800> that's<00:05:46.099> like<00:05:46.279> 3900<00:05:47.089> attack<00:05:47.360> I<00:05:47.719> mean
