 Recruitment agreement for so-called guest workers Africa 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:29.550
 the focus of our correspondent in Berlin Katrin Riedel Glass has in 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.390
 Kreuzberg looked around where not only the football was celebrated after the 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.379
 Discussions about Thilo Sarrazin's theses and Federal President Wulff's speech 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:40.149
 German integration is the integration of Berta in the 

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:41.000
 youth 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.690
 In this probably Turkish quarter of Berlin no sim-lock hottest cheese 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.769
 from China Klostermoor the director with the Bundesbank whether also German 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.700

 Turk the mother German-Italian 

00:00:56.819 --> 00:01:01.079
 she lives in berlin-kreuzberg where she lives last night 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.780
 moderated the German-Turkish football festival 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.160
 many Turks were hostile to the Muslim Thilo 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.170
 Sarrazin and the subsequent game dictates 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.360
 in the end, I think they turn urban assets into something 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.680
 so unsettled as that some uncertainty arose only within 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:18.920
 the coming 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.850
 What, in principle, quite in contrast to this is the German-German society 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.780
 is working 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.610
 but the statement of President Christian Wulff has the minds in the 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.150
 something calms down the Muslim community 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.560
 that Islam belongs to Germany takes place on 7 and goes one step further 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.540
 continue 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.880
 I think that is close stands action has been a nice sign that Haider 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.770
 is set that is quite actually prevails all around us 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.970
 if Europe and why should not it also in European Islam

 he does not even listen 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.780
 it's not just about the question of whether 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.730

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.600
 how do we manage that all of us under the roof of the republic as ICE out 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.380
 earlier may be part of this common republic of violent 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.600

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.410
 The integration debate is a big one at the German-Turkish sports festival 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:12.039

00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:20.969
 the 1 to be expected on the 4th 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.459
 Dr 

00:02:28.389 --> 00:02:32.859
 so far, a part of Germany and that is not to be seen that is exactly how as 

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:35.859
 you would say that is another country 

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:40.349
 Franks now has the it-industry of Turkish descent 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:44.650

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.629
 Appearance as a moral obligation to courage the Muslim community 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:52.079

 the mood was not good 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.209
 and that's why this game is Daum's statement 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.609
 Hayward has gotten a bit of pages 

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:04.169
 why, as I said, the important things are being acquired and that 

00:03:04.169 --> 00:03:07.529
 $ 1 Brüderles stays peaceful with each other 

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:13.349
 Oppenheim and ends with the match Germany Turkey 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:17.939
 The Turks are a bit disappointed by the 1300, but that does not stop them 

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:20.939
 to continue celebrating in a report 

00:03:22.649 --> 00:03:24.059
