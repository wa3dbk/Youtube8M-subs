study<00:02:11.280> so<00:02:11.550> who<00:02:11.730> knows<00:02:11.880> what<00:02:12.240> elements<00:02:12.720> if<00:02:12.930> any

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
study so who knows what elements if any

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.230 
study so who knows what elements if any
of<00:02:13.260> this<00:02:13.590> they're<00:02:13.860> looking<00:02:14.220> at<00:02:14.370> for<00:02:14.640> you<00:02:15.120> know

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
of this they're looking at for you know

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.430 
of this they're looking at for you know
for<00:02:15.420> something<00:02:15.630> in<00:02:15.720> the<00:02:15.750> future<00:02:15.900> could<00:02:16.260> we

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
for something in the future could we

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.420 
for something in the future could we
possibly<00:02:17.010> see<00:02:17.490> like<00:02:17.820> a<00:02:17.850> TT<00:02:18.330> RS<00:02:18.690> or<00:02:19.350> RS<00:02:19.890> TT<00:02:20.280> or

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
possibly see like a TT RS or RS TT or

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:21.470 
possibly see like a TT RS or RS TT or
however<00:02:20.670> the<00:02:20.940> hell<00:02:20.970> they<00:02:21.180> would<00:02:21.300> do<00:02:21.390> the

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
however the hell they would do the

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.940 
however the hell they would do the
nominal<00:02:21.810> just<00:02:22.020> make<00:02:22.140> a<00:02:22.170> limited<00:02:22.560> run<00:02:22.680> of<00:02:22.740> like

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
nominal just make a limited run of like

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
the way they roll it on stage is that

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.810 
the way they roll it on stage is that
exhaust<00:04:25.120> or<00:04:25.420> no<00:04:25.660> that's<00:04:26.160> for<00:04:27.160> sure<00:04:27.190> I<00:04:27.400> thought

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
exhaust or no that's for sure I thought

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.220 
exhaust or no that's for sure I thought
I<00:04:27.850> was<00:04:28.030> I<00:04:28.150> thought<00:04:28.330> it<00:04:28.450> was<00:04:28.540> I<00:04:28.690> thought<00:04:28.720> tired

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:29.230 
I was I thought it was I thought tired

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:32.310 
I was I thought it was I thought tired
about<00:04:29.440> that's<00:04:29.830> timer<00:04:30.280> and<00:04:30.520> the<00:04:31.480> interior<00:04:31.960> it's

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 
about that's timer and the interior it's

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:33.750 
about that's timer and the interior it's
funny<00:04:32.560> you<00:04:32.620> look<00:04:32.770> at<00:04:32.920> the<00:04:33.010> interior<00:04:33.310> and<00:04:33.640> it's

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 
funny you look at the interior and it's

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.720 
funny you look at the interior and it's
kind<00:04:34.030> of<00:04:34.060> weird-looking<00:04:34.300> because<00:04:35.730> obviously

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:36.730 
kind of weird-looking because obviously

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:39.060 
kind of weird-looking because obviously
they<00:04:37.060> had<00:04:37.210> to<00:04:37.390> you<00:04:37.840> know<00:04:37.930> they<00:04:38.350> had<00:04:38.500> since<00:04:38.920> its

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.070 
they had to you know they had since its

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.160 
they had to you know they had since its
rear<00:04:39.250> drive<00:04:39.580> they<00:04:39.820> had<00:04:40.000> to<00:04:40.150> move<00:04:40.300> the<00:04:40.600> shifter

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:41.170 
rear drive they had to move the shifter

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:44.400 
rear drive they had to move the shifter
so<00:04:41.440> the<00:04:41.920> the<00:04:42.280> tiptronic<00:04:43.030> is<00:04:43.270> actually<00:04:43.720> on<00:04:43.930> this

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410 
so the the tiptronic is actually on this

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.680 
so the the tiptronic is actually on this
little<00:04:44.590> you<00:04:45.220> know<00:04:45.340> riser<00:04:45.760> that<00:04:46.300> sits<00:04:46.540> on<00:04:46.630> top

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
little you know riser that sits on top

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.620 
little you know riser that sits on top
of<00:04:46.900> this<00:04:47.200> this<00:04:47.920> tunnel<00:04:48.160> that<00:04:48.580> you<00:04:48.880> don't

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:49.630 
of this this tunnel that you don't

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:51.540 
of this this tunnel that you don't
normally<00:04:50.290> see<00:04:50.530> there<00:04:50.920> you<00:04:51.190> know<00:04:51.280> in<00:04:51.310> one<00:04:51.520> of
