Annie you really really gonna have to
work<00:01:38.680> extremely<00:01:39.010> hard<00:01:39.430> I<00:01:39.910> think<00:01:40.150> while<00:01:40.360> he

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
work extremely hard I think while he

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.360 
work extremely hard I think while he
knows<00:01:40.600> that<00:01:40.810> going<00:01:41.110> into<00:01:41.350> the<00:01:41.410> fight<00:01:41.680> whether

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:42.370 
knows that going into the fight whether

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:44.999 
knows that going into the fight whether
or<00:01:42.490> not<00:01:42.610> he<00:01:42.940> has<00:01:43.270> that<00:01:43.570> to<00:01:44.259> be<00:01:44.410> able<00:01:44.530> to<00:01:44.710> do<00:01:44.830> that

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:45.009 
or not he has that to be able to do that

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:46.499 
or not he has that to be able to do that
I<00:01:45.070> think<00:01:45.280> you<00:01:45.550> can<00:01:45.640> put<00:01:45.790> a<00:01:45.820> lot<00:01:46.000> of<00:01:46.030> tricks<00:01:46.330> out

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:46.509 
I think you can put a lot of tricks out

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:50.940 
I think you can put a lot of tricks out
