one and it is 14 inches and the density
is<00:01:38.820> 150<00:01:39.630> but<00:01:40.049> I<00:01:40.079> think<00:01:40.290> of<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.439> bob<00:01:40.680> I<00:01:40.890> think<00:01:41.130> of

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
is 150 but I think of a bob I think of

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.620 
is 150 but I think of a bob I think of
the<00:01:41.310> hair<00:01:41.520> being<00:01:41.670> kind<00:01:41.939> of<00:01:42.030> on<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.180> thin<00:01:42.600> side

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
the hair being kind of on the thin side

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.660 
the hair being kind of on the thin side
and<00:01:43.259> I<00:01:43.290> noticed<00:01:43.619> that<00:01:43.680> this<00:01:43.860> hair<00:01:44.100> is<00:01:44.130> really

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
and I noticed that this hair is really

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.399 
and I noticed that this hair is really
really<00:01:45.030> thick<00:01:45.360> I<00:01:45.600> kind<00:01:45.960> of<00:01:46.049> thought<00:01:46.170> it<00:01:46.320> was

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
really thick I kind of thought it was

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.859 
really thick I kind of thought it was
like<00:01:46.590> maybe<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:46.979> little<00:01:47.460> bit<00:01:47.880> too<00:01:48.240> thick<00:01:48.540> to<00:01:48.570> be

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
like maybe a little bit too thick to be

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.330 
like maybe a little bit too thick to be
about<00:01:49.079> because<00:01:49.500> it's<00:01:49.680> kind<00:01:49.860> of<00:01:49.979> like<00:01:50.130> it

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
about because it's kind of like it

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.639

don't know it just wasn't working and I

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:17.729 
don't know it just wasn't working and I
felt<00:02:15.530> like<00:02:15.620> the<00:02:15.799> part<00:02:16.220> was<00:02:16.430> a<00:02:16.459> little<00:02:16.760> bit<00:02:16.879> too

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
felt like the part was a little bit too

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:20.649 
felt like the part was a little bit too
thin<00:02:18.739> so<00:02:19.489> I<00:02:19.519> plucked<00:02:19.879> the<00:02:20.000> top<00:02:20.209> of<00:02:20.360> the<00:02:20.450> hair

00:02:20.649 --> 00:02:20.659 
thin so I plucked the top of the hair

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:22.390 
thin so I plucked the top of the hair
and<00:02:20.870> I<00:02:21.019> like<00:02:21.200> plucked<00:02:21.500> out<00:02:21.650> some<00:02:21.860> random<00:02:22.220> hairs

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
and I like plucked out some random hairs

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.949 
and I like plucked out some random hairs
on<00:02:22.549> the<00:02:22.640> top<00:02:22.819> to<00:02:23.000> kind<00:02:23.120> of<00:02:23.269> like<00:02:23.390> thin<00:02:23.689> it<00:02:23.840> out

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
on the top to kind of like thin it out

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:26.770 
on the top to kind of like thin it out
then<00:02:24.739> I<00:02:24.980> cut<00:02:25.370> like<00:02:25.640> a<00:02:25.670> little<00:02:26.180> bit<00:02:26.360> of<00:02:26.569> this

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
then I cut like a little bit of this

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.569 
then I cut like a little bit of this
side<00:02:27.110> to<00:02:27.650> make<00:02:27.799> it<00:02:27.980> like<00:02:28.099> a<00:02:28.129> little<00:02:28.250> bit

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:28.579 
side to make it like a little bit

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:30.130 
side to make it like a little bit
shorter<00:02:28.819> to<00:02:29.090> frame<00:02:29.269> my<00:02:29.420> face<00:02:29.450> and<00:02:29.810> I<00:02:29.870> did<00:02:30.049> the

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
shorter to frame my face and I did the

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.140 
shorter to frame my face and I did the
