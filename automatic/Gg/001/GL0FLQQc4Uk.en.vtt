00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:04.250
 hi everyone how are you in this video you 

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:05.810
 I'm going to show you how to make breasts 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.930
 breaded or better known as 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:10.400
 Milanesas so stay to see what 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:12.020
 first we're going to use clear they're going to 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.760
 be breast fillets 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:14.990
 if you do not know how to use a breast in 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.850
 I leave a video below 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.850
 explaining how to do it step by step 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.780
 we are also going to use an egg 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.119
 and a half tablespoon of chicken broth in 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:31.119
 powder 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.130
 If you do not have chicken soup, you can 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.130
 use salt and pepper 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.670
 we will begin to beat very well 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.670
 egg 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.530
 then we will go soaking each steak 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:59.110
 of chicken and we're going to let it rest 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.110
 about 10 to 15 minutes in the refrigerator 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:14.050
 then we're going to use ground bread and now 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:17.700
 have spent 10 or 20 minutes we are going to 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.700
 remove all the excess egg 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:25.450
 and we're going to put each steak on 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:25.450
 the ground bread 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.470
 then we are going to add more bread 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.470
 ground on the top 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.140
 let's flip our chicken pellets 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:44.090
 I like to press a little bit so that 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.100
 the bread crumbs adhere more to the meat 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.810
 then on a separate plate let's go 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.810
 arranging the breaded fillets 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.350
 let's do exactly the same 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.350
 know more steaks 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.330
 then at medium heat we will put a 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.740
 pan we are going to add oil what 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.330
 enough that it covers our 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.550
 Milanese we are going to let you 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.630
 hot two minutes and now if we go to 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.630
 put our milanesa 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:42.760
 for each side of the Milanese wait 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.760
 2 minutes and we flipped it 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.519
 once I had two minutes of 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.800
 each side now the list is ready 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.750
 we are solving on a plate and we are going 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.620
 to put some the idiot paper so that 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.620
 they drain very well 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.720
 it's just to cool a little bit and 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.820
 is ready to be served to me 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.300
 like to accompany it with spaghetti and 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.300
 some salad 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.110
