okay<00:00:28.939> let's<00:00:29.210> do<00:00:29.390> this<00:00:29.509> one<00:00:29.720> more<00:00:29.929> time<00:00:29.990> and<00:00:30.560> try

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:30.980 
okay let's do this one more time and try

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.060 
okay let's do this one more time and try
and<00:00:31.130> stay<00:00:31.429> inside<00:00:32.059> the<00:00:32.270> margins<00:00:32.719> alright<00:00:33.379> so

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.070 
and stay inside the margins alright so

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.490 
and stay inside the margins alright so
this<00:00:35.350> is<00:00:36.350> not<00:00:36.649> a<00:00:37.010> spring<00:00:37.550> system<00:00:38.079> it's<00:00:39.079> moving

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 
this is not a spring system it's moving

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.110 
this is not a spring system it's moving
made<00:00:39.680> about<00:00:39.890> the<00:00:40.070> city<00:00:40.280> pop<00:00:40.640> open

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
made about the city pop open

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.170 
made about the city pop open
let's<00:00:41.629> give<00:00:41.930> it<00:00:41.960> a<00:00:42.079> bit<00:00:42.199> of<00:00:42.290> quick<00:00:42.820> it<00:00:43.820> sounds

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 
let's give it a bit of quick it sounds

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:45.220 
let's give it a bit of quick it sounds
like<00:00:44.300> it's<00:00:44.420> got<00:00:44.540> a<00:00:44.570> spring<00:00:44.750> in<00:00:44.930> it<00:00:44.960> but<00:00:45.140> it

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.230 
like it's got a spring in it but it

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.110 
like it's got a spring in it but it
doesn't<00:00:45.559> however<00:00:46.250> that's<00:00:46.460> not<00:00:46.610> really<00:00:46.940> a

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
doesn't however that's not really a

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.030 
doesn't however that's not really a
barrier<00:00:47.600> to<00:00:47.750> us<00:00:47.900> for<00:00:48.230> the<00:00:48.320> for<00:00:48.710> that<00:00:48.829> quick

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:49.040 
barrier to us for the for that quick

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.139 
barrier to us for the for that quick
release<00:00:49.449> now<00:00:50.449> I<00:00:50.690> don't<00:00:50.930> like<00:00:51.699> pulling<00:00:52.699> back<00:00:52.879> on

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:53.149 
release now I don't like pulling back on

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:55.930 
release now I don't like pulling back on
the<00:00:53.510> kicker<00:00:53.720> like<00:00:54.290> that<00:00:54.500> on<00:00:54.710> most<00:00:55.309> knives<00:00:55.699> what

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
the kicker like that on most knives what

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.969 
the kicker like that on most knives what
I<00:00:55.970> would<00:00:56.269> much<00:00:56.479> prefer<00:00:56.510> to<00:00:56.899> do<00:00:57.170> something<00:00:57.860> that

00:00:57.969 --> 00:00:57.979 
I would much prefer to do something that

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:59.799 
I would much prefer to do something that
they<00:00:58.159> deal<00:00:58.729> with<00:00:58.760> a<00:00:58.879> solid<00:00:59.239> grip<00:00:59.420> so<00:00:59.600> I'm<00:00:59.659> going

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
they deal with a solid grip so I'm going

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:04.420 
they deal with a solid grip so I'm going
to<00:00:59.839> hold<00:01:00.050> it<00:01:00.170> in<00:01:00.320> Reverse<00:01:01.330> like<00:01:02.330> that<00:01:03.430> just

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
to hold it in Reverse like that just

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.749 
to hold it in Reverse like that just
toss<00:01:04.610> it<00:01:04.760> forward<00:01:06.100> this<00:01:07.100> is<00:01:07.280> a<00:01:07.310> trick<00:01:07.580> that<00:01:07.610> I

00:01:07.749 --> 00:01:07.759 
toss it forward this is a trick that I

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:11.560 
toss it forward this is a trick that I
haven't<00:01:08.390> seen<00:01:08.659> anybody<00:01:08.960> else<00:01:09.200> do<00:01:10.330> really<00:01:11.330> that

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
haven't seen anybody else do really that

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.190 
haven't seen anybody else do really that
I<00:01:11.600> know<00:01:11.689> of<00:01:12.220> so<00:01:13.220> there's<00:01:13.670> I<00:01:13.939> haven't<00:01:14.780> seen<00:01:14.990> an

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
I know of so there's I haven't seen an

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.719 
I know of so there's I haven't seen an
official<00:01:15.830> name<00:01:16.009> for<00:01:16.220> it<00:01:16.280> but<00:01:16.340> I'm<00:01:16.430> calling<00:01:16.549> it

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
official name for it but I'm calling it

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:22.289 
official name for it but I'm calling it
a<00:01:16.820> back<00:01:17.000> flick<00:01:17.299> I<00:01:18.820> love<00:01:19.820> this<00:01:20.030> especially<00:01:20.500> for

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:22.299 
a back flick I love this especially for

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:27.039 
a back flick I love this especially for
left-handed<00:01:23.299> use<00:01:24.220> because<00:01:25.630> it's<00:01:26.630> going<00:01:26.810> to<00:01:26.900> be

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:27.049 
left-handed use because it's going to be

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:29.140 
left-handed use because it's going to be
going<00:01:28.009> to<00:01:28.130> be<00:01:28.189> sitting<00:01:28.430> in<00:01:28.490> your<00:01:28.549> pocket<00:01:29.030> with

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
going to be sitting in your pocket with

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.020 
going to be sitting in your pocket with
a<00:01:29.180> clip<00:01:29.540> facing<00:01:30.200> outwards<00:01:30.950> if<00:01:31.670> it's<00:01:31.850> in<00:01:31.939> your

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
a clip facing outwards if it's in your

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.480 
a clip facing outwards if it's in your
left<00:01:32.240> hand<00:01:32.359> and<00:01:32.859> you're<00:01:33.859> going<00:01:34.039> to<00:01:34.069> reach<00:01:34.280> in

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
left hand and you're going to reach in

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.880 
left hand and you're going to reach in
from<00:01:34.969> the<00:01:35.090> top<00:01:35.299> with<00:01:35.539> your<00:01:35.689> thumb<00:01:35.929> right<00:01:36.829> there

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
from the top with your thumb right there

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.010 
from the top with your thumb right there
so<00:01:37.579> when<00:01:37.729> you<00:01:37.789> pull<00:01:37.999> it<00:01:38.119> out<00:01:38.240> it's<00:01:38.719> going<00:01:38.899> to<00:01:38.960> be

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
so when you pull it out it's going to be

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.959 
so when you pull it out it's going to be
in<00:01:39.920> a<00:01:40.039> reverse<00:01:40.369> grip<00:01:42.159> right<00:01:43.159> there<00:01:43.429> which

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:43.969 
in a reverse grip right there which

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:45.219 
in a reverse grip right there which
doesn't<00:01:44.299> seem<00:01:44.539> like<00:01:44.780> it<00:01:44.899> would<00:01:44.990> be<00:01:45.079> that

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
doesn't seem like it would be that

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:47.200 
doesn't seem like it would be that
useful<00:01:45.380> until<00:01:46.069> you<00:01:46.189> learn<00:01:46.399> how<00:01:46.609> to<00:01:46.639> just<00:01:46.909> pop

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
useful until you learn how to just pop

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.349 
useful until you learn how to just pop
it<00:01:47.389> open<00:01:47.509> like<00:01:47.810> that<00:01:48.939> okay<00:01:49.939> so<00:01:49.999> we're<00:01:50.179> going<00:01:50.270> to

00:01:50.349 --> 00:01:50.359 
it open like that okay so we're going to

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:52.209 
it open like that okay so we're going to
walk<00:01:50.479> you<00:01:50.630> through<00:01:50.810> the<00:01:50.929> steps<00:01:51.170> of<00:01:51.380> this<00:01:51.560> now

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:52.219 
walk you through the steps of this now

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:54.550 
walk you through the steps of this now
it's<00:01:52.700> worth<00:01:52.880> noting<00:01:53.090> that<00:01:53.299> it's<00:01:53.840> super<00:01:54.319> easy

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
it's worth noting that it's super easy

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.919 
it's worth noting that it's super easy
to<00:01:54.889> do<00:01:55.039> it<00:01:55.159> on<00:01:55.280> this<00:01:55.460> knife<00:01:55.670> and<00:01:55.850> not<00:01:56.630> all

00:01:56.919 --> 00:01:56.929 
to do it on this knife and not all

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:01.959 
to do it on this knife and not all
knives<00:01:57.289> are<00:01:58.069> quite<00:01:58.520> so<00:01:58.929> good<00:01:59.929> at<00:02:00.079> it<00:02:00.789> this<00:02:01.789> is<00:02:01.850> a

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:01.969 
knives are quite so good at it this is a

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:05.469 
knives are quite so good at it this is a
pair<00:02:02.209> of<00:02:02.240> frame<00:02:02.509> one<00:02:02.749> you<00:02:03.200> can<00:02:03.380> still<00:02:03.740> do<00:02:04.579> it<00:02:04.609> it

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
pair of frame one you can still do it it

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:07.690 
pair of frame one you can still do it it
just<00:02:05.509> takes<00:02:05.749> a<00:02:05.929> little<00:02:06.020> bit<00:02:06.229> more<00:02:06.380> practice<00:02:06.799> so

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
just takes a little bit more practice so

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.500 
just takes a little bit more practice so
find<00:02:08.179> a<00:02:08.300> knife<00:02:08.509> that<00:02:09.850> that's<00:02:10.850> got<00:02:11.240> a<00:02:11.270> little

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
find a knife that that's got a little

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.760 
find a knife that that's got a little
bit<00:02:11.630> smoother<00:02:12.200> of<00:02:12.350> a<00:02:12.470> release<00:02:12.980> here<00:02:13.310> the<00:02:14.770> the

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
bit smoother of a release here the the

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.490 
bit smoother of a release here the the
distance<00:02:16.040> between<00:02:16.250> here<00:02:16.790> and<00:02:16.910> here<00:02:17.840> is<00:02:17.959> going

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
distance between here and here is going

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.610 
distance between here and here is going
to<00:02:18.590> be<00:02:18.800> your<00:02:19.400> biggest<00:02:19.640> hurdle

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.890 

okay<00:02:24.430> now<00:02:25.030> there's<00:02:25.239> a<00:02:25.300> couple<00:02:25.420> of<00:02:25.599> different

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
okay now there's a couple of different

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.420 
okay now there's a couple of different
techniques<00:02:26.200> to<00:02:26.410> this<00:02:26.560> you<00:02:26.739> could<00:02:26.860> go<00:02:27.010> forward

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
techniques to this you could go forward

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.479 
techniques to this you could go forward
and<00:02:27.790> stop<00:02:28.349> although<00:02:29.349> that's<00:02:29.680> that's<00:02:30.220> hit<00:02:30.370> or

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
and stop although that's that's hit or

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:33.089 
and stop although that's that's hit or
miss<00:02:30.519> you<00:02:30.790> can<00:02:30.940> go<00:02:31.090> forward<00:02:31.480> and<00:02:31.810> I'm<00:02:32.709> whipped

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:33.099 
miss you can go forward and I'm whipped

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:38.330 
miss you can go forward and I'm whipped
down<00:02:33.430> but<00:02:33.970> I<00:02:34.000> find<00:02:34.450> that<00:02:35.290> the<00:02:35.769> best<00:02:35.980> results<00:02:36.610> on

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
down but I find that the best results on

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.949 
down but I find that the best results on
the<00:02:39.340> most<00:02:39.580> for<00:02:39.940> the<00:02:40.030> most<00:02:40.180> consistent<00:02:40.930> results

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
the most for the most consistent results

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.380 
the most for the most consistent results
at<00:02:41.560> least<00:02:41.769> it<00:02:42.069> should<00:02:42.310> be<00:02:42.430> able<00:02:42.670> to<00:02:42.790> do<00:02:42.970> it<00:02:43.180> with

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
at least it should be able to do it with

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.559 
at least it should be able to do it with
just<00:02:43.629> moving<00:02:44.440> down<00:02:45.160> diagonally<00:02:45.970> like<00:02:46.120> this<00:02:46.180> at

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569 
just moving down diagonally like this at

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:52.140 
just moving down diagonally like this at
a<00:02:46.629> forward<00:02:47.500> flick<00:02:47.709> like<00:02:48.549> that<00:02:50.940> and<00:02:51.940> once<00:02:52.090> you

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
a forward flick like that and once you

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.759 
a forward flick like that and once you
practice<00:02:52.510> the<00:02:52.629> motions<00:02:52.989> a<00:02:53.170> couple<00:02:53.500> of<00:02:53.590> times

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
practice the motions a couple of times

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:55.080 
practice the motions a couple of times
you'll<00:02:54.010> be<00:02:54.160> able<00:02:54.250> to<00:02:54.400> just<00:02:54.549> pull<00:02:54.730> it<00:02:54.849> out<00:02:54.910> and

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
you'll be able to just pull it out and

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:01.759 
you'll be able to just pull it out and
pop<00:02:55.599> it<00:02:55.750> out<00:02:59.670> it's<00:03:00.670> really<00:03:01.060> really<00:03:01.329> satisfying

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
pop it out it's really really satisfying

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:05.520 
pop it out it's really really satisfying
feeling<00:03:02.940> okay<00:03:03.940> so<00:03:04.420> things<00:03:04.810> to<00:03:04.989> be<00:03:05.110> aware<00:03:05.319> of

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
feeling okay so things to be aware of

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.130 
feeling okay so things to be aware of
you<00:03:05.860> want<00:03:06.099> your<00:03:06.549> fingers<00:03:07.120> to<00:03:07.329> be<00:03:07.599> completely

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
you want your fingers to be completely

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.839 
you want your fingers to be completely
clear<00:03:08.560> of<00:03:08.799> the<00:03:08.980> blade<00:03:09.190> so<00:03:10.150> because<00:03:11.610> that's<00:03:12.610> not

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:12.849 
clear of the blade so because that's not

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:14.309 
clear of the blade so because that's not
going<00:03:12.970> to<00:03:13.030> go<00:03:13.150> anywhere<00:03:13.420> and<00:03:13.720> you<00:03:13.810> naturally

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 
going to go anywhere and you naturally

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:16.500 
going to go anywhere and you naturally
want<00:03:14.799> to<00:03:14.860> tighten<00:03:15.310> your<00:03:15.519> grip<00:03:15.910> on<00:03:16.120> it<00:03:16.299> so<00:03:16.390> that

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
want to tighten your grip on it so that

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.740 
want to tighten your grip on it so that
it<00:03:16.569> doesn't<00:03:16.720> go<00:03:16.930> flying<00:03:17.379> off<00:03:17.829> into<00:03:18.250> space

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
it doesn't go flying off into space

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.319 
it doesn't go flying off into space
there<00:03:19.750> so<00:03:20.049> make<00:03:20.620> extra<00:03:21.220> sure<00:03:21.250> that<00:03:22.000> you're<00:03:22.150> not

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:22.329 
there so make extra sure that you're not

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:24.600 
there so make extra sure that you're not
holding<00:03:22.739> your<00:03:23.739> fingers<00:03:24.069> are<00:03:24.160> not<00:03:24.250> in<00:03:24.430> contact

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
holding your fingers are not in contact

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.710 
holding your fingers are not in contact
with<00:03:24.879> the<00:03:25.030> blade<00:03:25.209> whatsoever<00:03:27.450> okay<00:03:28.450> it's

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
with the blade whatsoever okay it's

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.080 
with the blade whatsoever okay it's
easier<00:03:29.139> on<00:03:29.470> a<00:03:29.799> larger<00:03:30.250> knife<00:03:30.430> like<00:03:30.700> this<00:03:30.730> like

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
easier on a larger knife like this like

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.809 
easier on a larger knife like this like
this<00:03:31.180> is<00:03:31.329> about<00:03:31.630> the<00:03:32.500> above<00:03:32.709> three<00:03:33.489> and<00:03:33.670> a<00:03:33.700> half

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:33.819 
this is about the above three and a half

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:36.300 
this is about the above three and a half
four<00:03:34.090> inches<00:03:34.299> something<00:03:34.510> like<00:03:34.690> that<00:03:35.190> I'm<00:03:36.190> not

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
four inches something like that I'm not

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.319 
four inches something like that I'm not
sure<00:03:36.639> the<00:03:37.030> description<00:03:37.510> will<00:03:37.630> tell<00:03:37.780> you<00:03:39.329> where

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:40.329 
sure the description will tell you where

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:41.759 
sure the description will tell you where
there's<00:03:40.480> a<00:03:40.540> little<00:03:40.810> bit<00:03:40.930> of<00:03:41.019> blade<00:03:41.260> sticking

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769 
there's a little bit of blade sticking

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:44.069 
there's a little bit of blade sticking
up<00:03:42.010> past<00:03:42.370> the<00:03:42.549> fingers<00:03:42.819> there<00:03:42.940> although<00:03:43.540> as<00:03:43.810> I

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:44.079 
up past the fingers there although as I

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:46.670 
up past the fingers there although as I
demonstrated<00:03:44.620> over<00:03:44.889> here<00:03:45.099> not<00:03:45.609> really

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
demonstrated over here not really

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.650 
demonstrated over here not really
particularly<00:03:47.680> necessary<00:03:48.459> you<00:03:48.790> can<00:03:48.819> still<00:03:49.329> do

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
particularly necessary you can still do

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:55.680 
particularly necessary you can still do
it<00:03:51.989> okay<00:03:53.099> after<00:03:54.099> you<00:03:54.700> learn<00:03:54.970> how<00:03:55.239> to<00:03:55.269> do<00:03:55.540> it

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
it okay after you learn how to do it

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.839 
it okay after you learn how to do it
initially<00:03:56.349> where<00:03:56.650> you<00:03:56.799> can<00:03:56.950> just<00:03:57.130> pull<00:03:57.639> it<00:03:57.669> out

00:03:57.839 --> 00:03:57.849 
initially where you can just pull it out

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:02.849 
initially where you can just pull it out
and<00:03:58.090> pop<00:03:58.720> it<00:03:58.840> down<00:03:59.280> the<00:04:01.200> next<00:04:02.200> step<00:04:02.470> after<00:04:02.680> that

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:02.859 
and pop it down the next step after that

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:04.860 
and pop it down the next step after that
would<00:04:03.130> be<00:04:03.160> to<00:04:03.459> experiment<00:04:04.209> on<00:04:04.359> other<00:04:04.599> knives

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
would be to experiment on other knives

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:09.030 
would be to experiment on other knives
like<00:04:05.260> that<00:04:05.519> so<00:04:06.519> and<00:04:07.349> it<00:04:08.349> really<00:04:08.620> is<00:04:08.919> very

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
like that so and it really is very

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.970 
like that so and it really is very
specific<00:04:10.030> to<00:04:10.389> which<00:04:10.930> kind<00:04:11.319> of<00:04:11.470> knife<00:04:11.650> that

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:11.980 
specific to which kind of knife that

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.229 
specific to which kind of knife that
you've<00:04:12.099> got<00:04:13.440> like<00:04:14.440> this<00:04:14.950> one<00:04:15.190> is<00:04:15.549> much<00:04:15.819> easier

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
you've got like this one is much easier

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:17.909 
you've got like this one is much easier
than<00:04:16.510> this<00:04:16.959> one<00:04:17.200> or<00:04:17.410> if<00:04:17.500> you're<00:04:17.620> wondering<00:04:17.859> why

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919 
than this one or if you're wondering why

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:19.500 
than this one or if you're wondering why
I<00:04:17.979> have<00:04:18.160> to<00:04:18.280> the<00:04:18.430> same<00:04:18.609> knife<00:04:18.820> because<00:04:19.239> this<00:04:19.419> is

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 
I have to the same knife because this is

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:24.580 
I have to the same knife because this is
a<00:04:19.539> Gerber<00:04:19.810> and<00:04:20.109> this<00:04:20.440> is<00:04:20.530> a<00:04:20.560> knockoff

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.350 

there<00:04:24.740> this<00:04:24.950> is<00:04:25.010> like<00:04:25.190> ten<00:04:25.400> bucks<00:04:25.610> you<00:04:25.880> there's

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
there this is like ten bucks you there's

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.150 
there this is like ten bucks you there's
a<00:04:26.419> there's<00:04:26.840> a<00:04:26.900> definite<00:04:27.530> difference<00:04:27.770> in

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
a there's a definite difference in

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.490 
a there's a definite difference in
weight<00:04:28.460> this<00:04:28.790> is<00:04:28.970> a<00:04:29.000> lot<00:04:29.270> heavier<00:04:29.690> it's<00:04:30.260> a<00:04:30.380> lot

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
weight this is a lot heavier it's a lot

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.500 
weight this is a lot heavier it's a lot
sturdier<00:04:30.770> and<00:04:31.250> there's<00:04:31.880> a<00:04:31.970> visible<00:04:32.210> kicker

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510 
sturdier and there's a visible kicker

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:35.379 
sturdier and there's a visible kicker
but<00:04:32.960> you<00:04:33.560> can<00:04:33.710> just<00:04:33.860> pop<00:04:34.160> that<00:04:34.400> open<00:04:34.550> real

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:35.389 
but you can just pop that open real

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:38.740 
but you can just pop that open real
simple<00:04:35.840> where<00:04:36.380> the<00:04:36.800> same<00:04:37.070> motion<00:04:37.850> here<00:04:38.240> isn't

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
simple where the same motion here isn't

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.250 
simple where the same motion here isn't
kind<00:04:38.870> of<00:04:38.960> open<00:04:39.200> this<00:04:39.320> you<00:04:39.500> have<00:04:39.620> to<00:04:39.770> really

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:41.260 
kind of open this you have to really

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:47.830 
kind of open this you have to really
really<00:04:42.260> hammer<00:04:42.620> this<00:04:42.889> one<00:04:46.540> until<00:04:47.540> you<00:04:47.630> get<00:04:47.750> the

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 
really hammer this one until you get the

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.570 
really hammer this one until you get the
motion<00:04:47.990> down<00:04:51.190> although<00:04:52.190> this<00:04:52.400> is<00:04:52.550> a

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
motion down although this is a

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.850 
motion down although this is a
forward-facing<00:04:53.060> clip<00:04:53.450> knife<00:04:53.660> so<00:04:53.900> it's<00:04:54.710> more

for<00:05:11.330> parts<00:05:11.450> or<00:05:12.380> just<00:05:12.919> see<00:05:13.070> what's<00:05:13.250> inside<00:05:13.400> it<00:05:13.669> I

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:14.169
