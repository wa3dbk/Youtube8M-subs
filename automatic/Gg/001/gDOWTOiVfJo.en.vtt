00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.820
 hi everyone today i'm coming 

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:04.650
 you make a video that I did not think 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.330
 not do a day on my channel and 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.519
 yet here it is and yes you have 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.260
 read in the title I come to present 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.250
 my new tattoo so if you 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.110
 be part of the people who followed me 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.570
 for a while you know that I have a 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.190
 tattoo in the nape that I got 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.720
 when I was 18 and I'm in 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.900
 being tattooed because I 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.880
 do when I was too young or so 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.350
 in any case I have not thought enough I 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.000
 am trying to tease him up and 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.230
 when I was asked the question when you 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.260
 asked me the question I told you 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.820
 always say no I do not withdraw 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.219
 tattoos because because this 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.480
 First experience has served me and 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.980
 I know I get tired of things and 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.050
 I do not want to 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.960
 I talked about renewing the experience and 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.340
 yet here I am today since 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:47.610
 already several months 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.350
 in fact over a year I think about myself 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.000
 do another make me another 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.469
 tattoo but just I wanted 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.789
 not make the same mistake as the first 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.500
 times ie do something 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.360
 Well, because I wanted to do something 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.559
 tattoo but without thinking about the 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.079
 meaning 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.219
 so this time I thought about it 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.280
 a long time to find a meaning 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.110
 who really made sense to me 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.979
 so before you show some canvas 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.310
 because I know you want to 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.530
 having 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.540
 I would still like to speak to you 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.869
 little bit of sleeve and world of thought 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.900
 for to come to choose his 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.000
 motivates this location is and why 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.460
 what then 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.360
 without wanting to expose you too much 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.430
 privacy etc 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.960
 a few years ago I had a 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.600
 period when I was going I was really going 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:35.400
 not very well and a few few 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:37.350
 stuff that really made me go out 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.549
 of this state there the first thing I have 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.490
 already spoken it's a movie called 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.350
 into the world and who my veil that has me 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.420
 gave back energy and all that 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.500
 and the second thing I'm doing 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.270
 account finally I do not think you have 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.340
 already spoken about late it's possible that I 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.049
 wanted to mention in a table not 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.770
 but I do not believe that 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:57.119
 moment it's a music is actually 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.790
 it's a New Zealand group that 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.320
 is called ben has a little electro rock 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.180
 Finally, I would put you possibly a 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.460
 link info bar if you go if you 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.780
 want to go listen after after this 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.829
 video for those of you who 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.160
 know the group would be that these 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.600
 a few 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.740
 enough fairly minimalist thing to 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.480
 level of music but by cons they 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.530
 have lyrics so it's in English 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.230
 since it's a New Zealand group 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.600
 but words that are really strong 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.850
 I find myself hyper hyper touching and 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.830
 almost is almost political and me 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.080
 it is while listening to this song that 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:28.560
 I finally found a bit of a 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.670
 little taste for life and so I play it 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.920
 true that when I'm not good I'm 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:35.730
 regularly returns to this 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:38.550
 group and and I was hungry I wanted 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.600
 finally for me it had a sense of two 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:44.190
 marked in fact to mark my body with 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.410
 with something that are related 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.110
 with this with this group and more 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.390
 especially with this kind of 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.760
 routine I have to go back to this group 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.170
 to feel better every time at 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.760
 every time it will not so what 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.560
 so that's been years 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.180
 I had in mind this idea 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.290
 this meaning makes for a 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.010
 tattoo but I could not put it 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:07.830
 in turning it into something 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.870
 something visual and then small to 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.310
 little in his has come for those who 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.400
 know the cover of their second 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:17.010
 album enough finally good I was inspired 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.060
 in fact the font they used 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.500
 for the cover of their second album 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.910
 but we are trying to do something 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.680
 a little more than a little bit more 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.490
 of staff I wanted it to make a 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.750
 like when it was like that 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:29.430
 brush directly finally something 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.990
 not too clean because I like 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.810
 not too much 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:38.400
 tattoos written so way 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:40.020
 Too clean so that's okay, do not judge me 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.610
 not I know I told you that I do not 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.480
 make any tattoo, but that's the 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.950
 moment has come and I'm doing them 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.030
 today and so now I'm going 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:49.370

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:52.230
 and so, but I'm delighted 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.160
 so here I am super happy with the 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.660

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.550
