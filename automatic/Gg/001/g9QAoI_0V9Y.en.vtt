a wireless LAN card that had been

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.620 
a wireless LAN card that had been
installed<00:00:34.920> and<00:00:35.340> I<00:00:35.670> was<00:00:35.790> advised<00:00:36.120> that<00:00:36.329> it<00:00:36.480> was

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
part of the factory install I removed

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.500 
part of the factory install I removed
them<00:00:42.270> and<00:00:43.700> I'm<00:00:44.700> going<00:00:44.879> to<00:00:44.969> be<00:00:45.059> using<00:00:45.210> the

see<00:01:01.129> that's<00:01:02.129> what<00:01:02.370> I'm<00:01:02.430> going<00:01:02.579> to<00:01:02.640> do<00:01:02.789> first

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
see that's what I'm going to do first

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.060 
see that's what I'm going to do first
thing<00:01:03.690> I'm<00:01:03.780> going<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:03.989> do<00:01:04.140> though<00:01:04.320> because<00:01:04.890> I

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
thing I'm going to do though because I

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.039 
thing I'm going to do though because I
have<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.400> original<00:01:06.000> disks<00:01:06.420> with<00:01:06.630> us<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:06.930> make

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
have the original disks with us to make

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.060 
have the original disks with us to make
its<00:01:07.590> computer<00:01:08.720> because<00:01:09.720> I'm<00:01:09.900> going<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:10.950> go

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
its computer because I'm going to go

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.800 
its computer because I'm going to go
ahead<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:12.380> use<00:01:13.380> some<00:01:13.619> disc<00:01:13.860> wiping<00:01:14.280> software

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
ahead and use some disc wiping software

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.260 
ahead and use some disc wiping software
wipe<00:01:15.810> everything<00:01:16.170> on<00:01:16.500> it<00:01:16.820> that<00:01:17.820> way<00:01:18.000> when<00:01:18.180> it

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
wipe everything on it that way when it

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.179 
wipe everything on it that way when it
goes<00:01:18.390> back<00:01:18.630> it's<00:01:18.869> going<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.080> reinstall<00:01:19.710> the

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:22.189 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:24.499 

partitions<00:01:23.189> and<00:01:23.369> everything<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.390> way<00:01:24.479> it

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
partitions and everything the way it

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.770 
partitions and everything the way it
should<00:01:24.810> be<00:01:24.840> so<00:01:25.229> if<00:01:25.350> there<00:01:25.500> are<00:01:25.560> any<00:01:25.680> viruses<00:01:26.430> or

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
should be so if there are any viruses or

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.859 
should be so if there are any viruses or
corrupted<00:01:27.780> software<00:01:28.579> you<00:01:29.579> know<00:01:29.869> it's

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
corrupted software you know it's

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:42.500 
corrupted software you know it's
basically<00:01:31.350> going<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:32.420> erase<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.659> hard<00:01:33.750> drive

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:42.510 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:48.280 

go<00:01:43.510> ahead<00:01:43.690> and<00:01:43.720> boot<00:01:44.020> down

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:53.800 

and<00:01:48.850> it<00:01:49.850> should<00:01:50.150> recognize<00:01:51.080> it<00:01:51.910> and<00:01:52.910> there's<00:01:53.720> a

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
and it should recognize it and there's a

00:01:53.810 --> 00:02:00.640 
and it should recognize it and there's a
hard<00:01:54.080> drive<00:01:55.990> says<00:01:56.990> it's<00:01:57.200> 74<00:01:57.800> gigabyte<00:01:58.370> but<00:01:59.650> so

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650 
hard drive says it's 74 gigabyte but so

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:01.930 
hard drive says it's 74 gigabyte but so
we're<00:02:00.830> going<00:02:00.920> to<00:02:01.010> go<00:02:01.070> ahead<00:02:01.250> and<00:02:01.430> like<00:02:01.670> that

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:01.940 
we're going to go ahead and like that

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:11.170 
we're going to go ahead and like that
and<00:02:03.760> get<00:02:04.760> to<00:02:04.910> fix<00:02:05.090> them<00:02:05.270> and<00:02:08.590> when<00:02:09.590> your<00:02:10.180> disk

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
and get to fix them and when your disk

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.740 
and get to fix them and when your disk
wipe<00:02:11.420> is<00:02:11.660> finished<00:02:12.050> and<00:02:12.230> successful<00:02:13.750> you

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
wipe is finished and successful you

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.630 
wipe is finished and successful you
usually<00:02:14.960> get<00:02:15.380> a<00:02:15.440> green<00:02:16.310> light<00:02:16.370> here

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
usually get a green light here

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.700 
usually get a green light here
indicating<00:02:17.420> everything<00:02:17.840> was<00:02:17.990> okay<00:02:18.380> and<00:02:18.530> there

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:18.710 
indicating everything was okay and there

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.350 
indicating everything was okay and there
weren't<00:02:18.890> any<00:02:19.160> errors<00:02:20.350> so<00:02:21.350> we're<00:02:21.500> good<00:02:21.709> to<00:02:21.740> go

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
weren't any errors so we're good to go

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.380 
weren't any errors so we're good to go
that's<00:02:23.360> the<00:02:23.750> disk<00:02:23.990> we<00:02:24.230> need<00:02:25.000> there's<00:02:26.000> two<00:02:26.209> ways

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
that's the disk we need there's two ways

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:27.790 
that's the disk we need there's two ways
you<00:02:26.450> can<00:02:26.780> do<00:02:26.959> this<00:02:26.990> when<00:02:27.470> you<00:02:27.590> turn<00:02:27.770> the

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
you can do this when you turn the

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.390 
you can do this when you turn the
computer<00:02:28.220> on<00:02:29.260> being<00:02:30.260> that<00:02:30.470> I<00:02:30.500> erased<00:02:30.980> a<00:02:31.190> hard

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
computer on being that I erased a hard

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.820 
computer on being that I erased a hard
drive<00:02:33.940> remember<00:02:34.940> this<00:02:35.060> menu<00:02:35.300> here<00:02:35.709> f12<00:02:36.709> to

boot being out your race too hard drive

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:40.870 
boot being out your race too hard drive
that's<00:02:39.560> going<00:02:39.739> to<00:02:39.830> automatically<00:02:40.430> boot<00:02:40.700> from

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
that's going to automatically boot from

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.630 
that's going to automatically boot from
the<00:02:41.000> first<00:02:41.270> thing<00:02:41.510> that<00:02:41.690> I<00:02:41.780> can<00:02:41.840> find<00:02:42.550> so<00:02:43.550> the

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
the first thing that I can find so the

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.390 
the first thing that I can find so the
next<00:02:43.850> thing<00:02:43.970> in<00:02:44.209> line<00:02:44.420> after<00:02:44.750> the<00:02:45.530> CDR<00:02:45.950> after

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
next thing in line after the CDR after

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.390 
next thing in line after the CDR after
the<00:02:46.580> hard<00:02:47.060> drive<00:02:47.300> is<00:02:47.480> the<00:02:47.600> cd-rom<00:02:48.220> so<00:02:49.220> it's

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
the hard drive is the cd-rom so it's

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.220 
the hard drive is the cd-rom so it's
going<00:02:49.489> to<00:02:49.580> go<00:02:49.730> through<00:02:50.030> a<00:02:50.709> series<00:02:51.709> of<00:02:51.830> screens

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
going to go through a series of screens

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.229 
going to go through a series of screens
