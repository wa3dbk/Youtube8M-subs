00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 who plays with the thought one 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.330
 He will think about it 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.160
 maybe multimedia system for 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.290
 to build a living room or a compact one 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.280
 office pc however usually not at one 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.840
 gaming system 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.250
 but most of the time you have it 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.780
 Living too buck my round too 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.760
 gamble on his television maybe in 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.010
 the full hd resolution and what would happen 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.050
 as he remembers the ap upc too 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.320
 rumsteht already with us 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:28.349
 we compare our test the amd a8 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:30.869
 7650 ktu with a radeon r 7 250 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.030
 graphics card and clarify how far the 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.710
 performance of the sway or something with it 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.210
 can be played with an apu and 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.950
 where it might make more sense 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.309
 also a pci express video card too 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.309
 put 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.360
 Let's take a quick look 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.040
 our technical substructure we for 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.140
 have used this article 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.460
 Exact information on what's for us 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.140
 have considered and also like that 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.640
 whole looks with pictures you can find 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.170
 then also in our written 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.390
 you can find article link as always 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.770
 under this video and then I would 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.530
 say just look at us 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:08.229
 put on 188 gamer mainboard here 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.210
 always 88 chip set that's the biggest 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:11.320
 chip set the for the fn 2 plus 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.690
 platform gives the offers all 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.890
 modern connections has no 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.259
 problems with newer ones 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.420
 hardware components as a comparison for 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:22.479
 put the integrated graphic of the apu 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.610
 we use a msi air 7 250 graphics card 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:26.890
 simply because of the costs 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.170
 85 euros is about the same 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.490
 price level like the apu itself and us 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.979
 can determine to what extent the 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.790
 Scaling the graphic performance 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.649
 fluctuates between an integrated 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.030
 graphic card and a pci express 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:38.560
 graphics card and if it maybe 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.810
 makes more sense if you gamble properly 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.360
 would like to bulk in a pci express 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:46.330
 to invest graphics card or whether the 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.830
 apu is sufficient for your claims with the 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.299
 We thought about playing when 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.190
 small cross- cuts between 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:52.840
 Mainstream title in a high end 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.340
 held and also two older titles for 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.290
 the two older titles include tomb 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.130
 raider as well as bioshock infinite the 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.960
 be at middle 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.600
 quality settings in the full hd 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.280
 resolution tested the witcher 3 completely 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.780
 clear the graphic pearl or one of the 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.220
 Play what most of you are sure of 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.750
 This year will be very much awaited 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.000
 also in full hd it works 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.929
 at the lowest settings and 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.060
 are still there 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.130
 social games for young and 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.049
 old like the sims or angot has two 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.209
 the sims will be at low 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:20.920
 has tested settings in full hd 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.950
 two at maximum settings in full 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.390
 hd on image enhancement will be complete 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.920
 just omitted because of the reason 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.989
 both the graphics card and the 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.030
 integrated gpu mostly for easy 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:33.100
 too weak as we are in our test 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.930
 may have stated with an apu 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.670
 to be played by, however 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.390
 We have to buy some restrictions 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.790
 be taken 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.680
 on the one hand , animal is not top title like 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.060
 current witcher 3 playing an abo 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.920
 you want to be there with yourself 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.079
 lowest details do not enjoy it 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.459
 that simply does not bring enough apps 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:50.739
 the integrated graphics card 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:53.110
 on the other hand, it must be noted that he 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:54.040
 partly at quality settings of the 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.020
 player as well as at the 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.720
 image improvement significant losses in 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.040
 must take purchase 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.410
 you usually have to improve your image 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.880
 Completely off count these to the 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.430
 for example, the edge smoothing or else 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.900
 The texture filter but with the details 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.280
 is in older play it thoroughly 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.080
 possible for you to be in the middle 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.550
 details and also in high details lands 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.620
 as an example here in our test tomb 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.540
 called raider or even a game like 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.280
 threatening has two which is very popular 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.400
 You can do that with almost maximum 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.650
 Play details in 1080p and get involved 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.660
 have no problems if he is now 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.430
 in the course of our test have noticed haye 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.080
 Maybe not after that 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.150
 true for me because I like one 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.580
 then you want to play a bit more 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.620
 I recommend you our article 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:36.260
 witcher 3 and q5 cheap graphics card 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.970
 to play in the test just look 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.100
 Let's have in there we have five models 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.690
 out of violence and looked at us yes what 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.820
 Can I because with graphics cards between 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.530
 100 and 200 euro so do everything 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.610
 Maybe you should find it 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.010
 if you become one for yourself 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.930
 graphics card searches in this sense that 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.640
 It would be so far from me to this video 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.900
 here I hope you liked it and 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.070
 I have the graphics card this time 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.600
 pronounced correctly 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.410
 and I'm happy if you do that too 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.540
 Next reingeschaut again 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:00.680
 suggestions ideas criticism or what also 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.959
 ever else had on the heart 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.170
 write us under video and up 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:05.170
 soon
