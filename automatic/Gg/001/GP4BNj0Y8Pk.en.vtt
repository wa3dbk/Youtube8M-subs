00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
full camera sensor is gathered together

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.570 
full camera sensor is gathered together
and<00:01:03.600> stored<00:01:04.019> in<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.290> temporary<00:01:04.830> memory<00:01:05.250> of

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
and stored in the temporary memory of

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.820 
and stored in the temporary memory of
your<00:01:05.820> camera<00:01:06.240> from<00:01:06.510> that<00:01:06.780> point<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.380> camera

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
your camera from that point the camera

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.219 
your camera from that point the camera
actually<00:01:08.040> has<00:01:08.430> to<00:01:08.580> process<00:01:09.270> this<00:01:09.479> information

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
actually has to process this information

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.190 
actually has to process this information
so<00:01:10.680> your<00:01:10.950> camera<00:01:11.520> is<00:01:11.729> a<00:01:11.760> computer<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:12.750> it<00:01:12.960> has

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
so your camera is a computer and it has

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.370 
so your camera is a computer and it has
processing<00:01:14.070> software<00:01:14.479> Canon<00:01:15.479> uses<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:15.990> digit

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
processing software Canon uses the digit

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.399 
processing software Canon uses the digit
processing<00:01:17.070> engine<00:01:17.430> Nikon<00:01:18.390> uses<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.900> X<00:01:19.080> speed

processing engine Nikon uses the X speed

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.670 
processing engine Nikon uses the X speed
this<00:01:19.979> software<00:01:20.580> takes<00:01:21.420> this<00:01:21.659> information<00:01:22.439> and

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
this software takes this information and

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.649 
this software takes this information and
turns<00:01:23.250> it<00:01:23.490> into<00:01:23.670> an<00:01:23.909> image<00:01:24.090> that<00:01:24.360> we<00:01:24.479> can

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
turns it into an image that we can

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.140 
turns it into an image that we can
understand<00:01:25.080> it<00:01:25.320> does<00:01:25.680> all<00:01:25.979> sorts<00:01:26.549> of<00:01:26.670> stuff<00:01:26.939> to

image so that when we look at it we see

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.339 
image so that when we look at it we see
the<00:03:22.489> picture<00:03:22.819> of<00:03:22.849> my<00:03:23.000> cat<00:03:23.209> Lulu<00:03:23.599> now<00:03:24.199> let's

the picture of my cat Lulu now let's

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:26.890 
the picture of my cat Lulu now let's
take<00:03:24.500> the<00:03:24.709> raw<00:03:24.859> file<00:03:25.189> which<00:03:25.430> is<00:03:25.669> 22<00:03:26.329> point<00:03:26.599> 5

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
take the raw file which is 22 point 5

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.499 
take the raw file which is 22 point 5
megabytes<00:03:27.590> which<00:03:28.069> is<00:03:28.280> nearly<00:03:28.519> 4<00:03:28.909> times<00:03:28.939> the

00:03:29.499 --> 00:03:29.509 
megabytes which is nearly 4 times the

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:32.080

now<00:03:32.389> this<00:03:32.659> raw<00:03:32.900> file<00:03:33.199> isn't<00:03:33.470> very<00:03:33.799> remarkable

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
now this raw file isn't very remarkable

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.979 
now this raw file isn't very remarkable
but<00:03:34.549> that's<00:03:34.729> because<00:03:34.939> we<00:03:35.239> haven't<00:03:35.479> done<00:03:35.720> any

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:38.349 
but that's because we haven't done any
post-processing<00:03:36.979> we<00:03:37.280> haven't<00:03:37.669> gone<00:03:37.879> into<00:03:37.939> the

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:43.069 
get to the computer we can process this

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:44.770 
get to the computer we can process this
file<00:03:43.340> ourselves<00:03:43.909> and<00:03:44.060> this<00:03:44.180> is<00:03:44.329> where<00:03:44.509> raw

file ourselves and this is where raw
really<00:03:45.229> shines<00:03:45.530> because<00:03:46.009> it<00:03:46.159> gives<00:03:46.489> you<00:03:46.759> an

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
what your final image can actually look

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.249 
what your final image can actually look

00:03:54.249 --> 00:03:54.259 
like with your raw file you can change

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:56.110 
like with your raw file you can change
and<00:03:54.439> manipulate<00:03:54.530> all<00:03:55.040> sorts<00:03:55.759> of<00:03:55.849> things

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
and manipulate all sorts of things

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.659 
and manipulate all sorts of things
things<00:03:56.719> like<00:03:56.900> the<00:03:57.169> exposure<00:03:57.709> you<00:03:58.129> can<00:03:58.280> change

the white balance you can recover

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:01.780 
the white balance you can recover
highlights<00:04:00.799> in<00:04:00.949> areas<00:04:01.280> that<00:04:01.310> are<00:04:01.459> slightly

highlights in areas that are slightly
blown<00:04:02.120> out<00:04:02.269> you<00:04:02.479> can<00:04:02.659> open<00:04:03.049> up<00:04:03.139> the<00:04:03.259> shadows<00:04:03.500> or

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:03.859 
blown out you can open up the shadows or

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:05.860 
blown out you can open up the shadows or
make<00:04:03.979> them<00:04:04.129> that<00:04:04.400> make<00:04:04.669> them<00:04:04.699> darker<00:04:05.269> you<00:04:05.629> can

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
make them that make them darker you can

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.499 
make them that make them darker you can
do<00:04:05.989> so<00:04:06.409> many<00:04:06.739> things<00:04:06.919> with<00:04:07.549> the<00:04:07.669> raw<00:04:07.849> file<00:04:08.239> it

00:04:08.499 --> 00:04:08.509 
do so many things with the raw file it

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:09.879 
do so many things with the raw file it
is<00:04:08.719> astounding

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:09.889 
is astounding

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:12.339 
is astounding
for<00:04:10.129> example<00:04:10.489> this<00:04:10.699> photo<00:04:11.120> now<00:04:11.269> of<00:04:11.689> Lulu<00:04:12.139> is

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:12.349 
for example this photo now of Lulu is

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:16.209 
for example this photo now of Lulu is
the<00:04:13.250> raw<00:04:13.969> file<00:04:14.389> after<00:04:15.049> I<00:04:15.079> processed<00:04:15.859> it<00:04:16.130> and

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:16.219 
the raw file after I processed it and

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:18.249 
the raw file after I processed it and
when<00:04:16.639> you<00:04:16.729> compare<00:04:17.090> it<00:04:17.120> to<00:04:17.239> the<00:04:17.449> original<00:04:17.539> JPEG

00:04:18.249 --> 00:04:18.259 
when you compare it to the original JPEG

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:19.839 
when you compare it to the original JPEG
you<00:04:18.289> can<00:04:18.590> see<00:04:18.769> that<00:04:18.949> the<00:04:19.099> images<00:04:19.489> are<00:04:19.669> not

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:19.849 
you can see that the images are not

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:21.550 
you can see that the images are not
crazy<00:04:20.269> different<00:04:20.930> but<00:04:21.049> that's<00:04:21.199> because<00:04:21.380> I

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
crazy different but that's because I

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.260 
crazy different but that's because I
wasn't<00:04:21.919> going<00:04:22.190> for<00:04:22.400> a<00:04:22.430> crazy<00:04:22.699> different<00:04:23.120> look

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
wasn't going for a crazy different look

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:24.850 
wasn't going for a crazy different look
now<00:04:23.750> before<00:04:24.169> I<00:04:24.199> go<00:04:24.380> on<00:04:24.469> you<00:04:24.590> might<00:04:24.740> be

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
now before I go on you might be

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.260 
now before I go on you might be
wondering<00:04:25.010> about<00:04:25.219> Photoshop<00:04:25.699> and<00:04:26.029> you<00:04:26.120> might

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
wondering about Photoshop and you might

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.810 
wondering about Photoshop and you might
be<00:04:26.419> thinking

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
be thinking

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.400 
be thinking
well<00:04:26.910> hey<00:04:27.060> I<00:04:27.270> can<00:04:27.450> take<00:04:27.480> a<00:04:27.660> JPEG<00:04:28.170> into

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
well hey I can take a JPEG into

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:30.080 
well hey I can take a JPEG into
Photoshop<00:04:28.950> and<00:04:29.130> I<00:04:29.190> can<00:04:29.370> do<00:04:29.430> all<00:04:29.640> sorts<00:04:30.030> of

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
Photoshop and I can do all sorts of

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.510 
Photoshop and I can do all sorts of
Photoshop<00:04:30.570> wizardry<00:04:31.050> and<00:04:31.200> the<00:04:32.040> truth<00:04:32.310> is

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
Photoshop wizardry and the truth is

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:33.620 
Photoshop wizardry and the truth is
you're<00:04:32.700> absolutely<00:04:33.030> right

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
you're absolutely right

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.530 
you're absolutely right
you<00:04:33.900> can<00:04:34.110> do<00:04:34.260> a<00:04:34.290> lot<00:04:34.950> with<00:04:34.980> the<00:04:35.460> JPEG<00:04:35.940> but<00:04:36.420> you

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540 
you can do a lot with the JPEG but you

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.590 
you can do a lot with the JPEG but you
can<00:04:36.750> do<00:04:36.930> more<00:04:37.440> with<00:04:38.100> a<00:04:38.310> raw<00:04:38.550> file<00:04:38.940> think<00:04:39.420> of<00:04:39.510> it

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
can do more with a raw file think of it

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.720 
can do more with a raw file think of it
like<00:04:39.750> this<00:04:39.930> working<00:04:40.410> on<00:04:40.440> a<00:04:40.500> JPEG<00:04:40.950> in<00:04:41.100> Photoshop

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:41.730 
like this working on a JPEG in Photoshop

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:44.180 
like this working on a JPEG in Photoshop
is<00:04:41.970> sort<00:04:42.450> of<00:04:42.540> like<00:04:42.690> taking<00:04:43.110> the<00:04:43.140> 4x6<00:04:43.620> print

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
is sort of like taking the 4x6 print

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.100 
is sort of like taking the 4x6 print
that<00:04:44.340> you<00:04:44.400> got<00:04:44.670> back<00:04:44.880> from<00:04:45.060> the<00:04:45.210> lab<00:04:45.420> and<00:04:45.660> then

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
that you got back from the lab and then

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.800 
that you got back from the lab and then
taking<00:04:46.560> some<00:04:46.770> markers<00:04:47.190> and<00:04:47.270> coloring<00:04:48.270> on<00:04:48.480> that

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 
taking some markers and coloring on that

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:51.740 
taking some markers and coloring on that
print<00:04:49.200> to<00:04:49.740> make<00:04:49.980> it<00:04:50.160> look<00:04:50.520> like<00:04:51.030> you<00:04:51.240> want<00:04:51.570> the

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
print to make it look like you want the

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.440 
print to make it look like you want the
final<00:04:52.170> image<00:04:52.530> to<00:04:52.740> look<00:04:53.010> you<00:04:53.670> can<00:04:53.850> change<00:04:54.210> the

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:54.450 
final image to look you can change the

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:55.820 
final image to look you can change the
information<00:04:55.080> you<00:04:55.200> can<00:04:55.380> make<00:04:55.530> it<00:04:55.650> look

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
information you can make it look

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.430 
information you can make it look
different<00:04:56.370> but<00:04:56.880> you're<00:04:57.060> destroying<00:04:57.900> the

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 
different but you're destroying the

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.790 
different but you're destroying the
original<00:04:59.220> data<00:04:59.550> that<00:05:00.270> you<00:05:00.450> had<00:05:00.840> in<00:05:01.230> order<00:05:01.680> to

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
original data that you had in order to

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.280 
original data that you had in order to
make<00:05:01.980> this<00:05:02.190> change<00:05:02.570> working<00:05:03.570> on<00:05:03.690> a<00:05:03.720> raw<00:05:03.960> file

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:04.290 
make this change working on a raw file

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:06.020 
make this change working on a raw file
is<00:05:04.560> like<00:05:04.770> taking<00:05:05.040> the<00:05:05.310> negative<00:05:05.460> into<00:05:05.940> the

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
is like taking the negative into the

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.360 
is like taking the negative into the
darkroom<00:05:06.360> and<00:05:06.810> generating<00:05:07.650> a<00:05:07.710> brand<00:05:08.100> new

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 
darkroom and generating a brand new

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.730 
darkroom and generating a brand new
print<00:05:08.850> that<00:05:09.360> matches<00:05:09.840> your<00:05:10.110> vision<00:05:10.590> of<00:05:10.680> what

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 
print that matches your vision of what

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.590 
print that matches your vision of what
the<00:05:10.980> image<00:05:11.280> should<00:05:11.460> look<00:05:11.640> like<00:05:11.670> this<00:05:12.330> new

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:12.600 
the image should look like this new

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.210 
the image should look like this new
print<00:05:12.870> unless<00:05:13.200> you've<00:05:13.350> gone<00:05:13.500> to<00:05:13.680> some<00:05:13.860> very

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 
print unless you've gone to some very

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.130 
print unless you've gone to some very
serious<00:05:14.580> extremes<00:05:15.210> will<00:05:15.480> contain<00:05:15.780> more

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:16.140 
serious extremes will contain more

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:19.280 
serious extremes will contain more
detail<00:05:16.650> more<00:05:17.250> information<00:05:18.060> than<00:05:18.570> the<00:05:18.750> JPEG

out in the hair in the raw file you can

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.770 
out in the hair in the raw file you can
see<00:05:34.320> the<00:05:34.770> reflection<00:05:34.920> in<00:05:35.580> the<00:05:35.670> eye<00:05:35.910> of<00:05:36.450> the

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:36.780 
see the reflection in the eye of the

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:38.840 
see the reflection in the eye of the
camera<00:05:37.050> as<00:05:37.440> I'm<00:05:37.680> taking<00:05:37.860> the<00:05:38.100> photograph<00:05:38.580> and

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:38.850 
camera as I'm taking the photograph and

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:40.670 
camera as I'm taking the photograph and
you<00:05:38.910> can<00:05:39.120> see<00:05:39.270> the<00:05:39.420> color<00:05:39.690> of<00:05:39.810> the<00:05:40.020> purple<00:05:40.440> wall

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:40.680 
you can see the color of the purple wall

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.730 
you can see the color of the purple wall
behind<00:05:40.950> me<00:05:41.570> whereas<00:05:42.570> in<00:05:42.660> the<00:05:42.780> JPEG<00:05:43.320> you<00:05:43.530> can

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:43.740 
behind me whereas in the JPEG you can

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:45.800 
behind me whereas in the JPEG you can
barely<00:05:44.340> make<00:05:44.520> up<00:05:44.730> the<00:05:44.850> camera<00:05:45.270> only<00:05:45.540> because

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810 
barely make up the camera only because

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:47.630 
barely make up the camera only because
we<00:05:45.990> know<00:05:46.170> it's<00:05:46.380> there<00:05:46.650> and<00:05:46.830> the<00:05:47.220> color<00:05:47.460> of<00:05:47.550> the

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:47.640 
we know it's there and the color of the

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.180 
we know it's there and the color of the
wall<00:05:47.910> is<00:05:48.120> nearly<00:05:48.420> impossible<00:05:48.630> to<00:05:49.350> see<00:05:49.560> now

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:50.190 
wall is nearly impossible to see now

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:53.270 
wall is nearly impossible to see now
let's<00:05:50.430> look<00:05:50.970> side<00:05:51.540> by<00:05:51.810> side<00:05:52.080> at<00:05:52.320> the<00:05:52.560> JPEG<00:05:53.070> and

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.280 
let's look side by side at the JPEG and

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.360 
let's look side by side at the JPEG and
the<00:05:53.460> raw<00:05:53.670> file<00:05:54.060> with<00:05:54.540> the<00:05:54.720> exact<00:05:55.140> same<00:05:55.530> post

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:56.370 
the raw file with the exact same post

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:58.790 
the raw file with the exact same post

processing software changes made to them

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.410 
processing software changes made to them
when<00:05:59.220> you<00:05:59.250> look<00:05:59.460> at<00:05:59.580> them<00:05:59.700> zoomed<00:06:00.000> out<00:06:00.180> they

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:00.420 
when you look at them zoomed out they

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:01.700 
when you look at them zoomed out they
look<00:06:00.570> pretty<00:06:00.840> similar<00:06:01.110> there<00:06:01.680> are

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:01.710 
look pretty similar there are

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:03.950 
look pretty similar there are
differences<00:06:02.310> but<00:06:02.520> they<00:06:02.670> are<00:06:02.760> slight<00:06:03.210> but<00:06:03.840> when

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:03.960 
differences but they are slight but when

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.140 
differences but they are slight but when
you<00:06:04.080> zoom<00:06:04.380> in<00:06:04.710> you<00:06:05.190> can<00:06:05.220> see<00:06:05.400> the<00:06:05.580> color<00:06:06.030> and

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:06.150 
you zoom in you can see the color and

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:08.300 
you zoom in you can see the color and
detail<00:06:06.540> that<00:06:07.020> the<00:06:07.140> raw<00:06:07.380> is<00:06:07.650> capable<00:06:08.160> of

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:08.310 
detail that the raw is capable of

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:10.970 
detail that the raw is capable of
compared<00:06:08.880> to<00:06:08.940> the<00:06:09.120> JPEG<00:06:09.570> the<00:06:10.050> JPEG<00:06:10.470> is<00:06:10.620> muddier

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:10.980 
compared to the JPEG the JPEG is muddier

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:13.520 
compared to the JPEG the JPEG is muddier
it<00:06:11.220> has<00:06:11.640> less<00:06:11.910> detail<00:06:12.420> and<00:06:12.660> less<00:06:13.200> color

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:13.530 
it has less detail and less color

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:15.560 
it has less detail and less color
compared<00:06:14.100> to<00:06:14.220> the<00:06:14.310> raw<00:06:14.430> file<00:06:14.730> so<00:06:15.240> the<00:06:15.390> obvious

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:15.570 
compared to the raw file so the obvious

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:17.630 
compared to the raw file so the obvious
question<00:06:15.810> is<00:06:16.230> should<00:06:16.530> you<00:06:16.680> shoot<00:06:17.010> your<00:06:17.250> photos

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:17.640 
question is should you shoot your photos

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:19.550 
question is should you shoot your photos
in<00:06:17.820> JPEG<00:06:18.270> or<00:06:18.420> should<00:06:18.660> you<00:06:18.810> shoot<00:06:18.990> your<00:06:19.200> photos

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:19.560 
in JPEG or should you shoot your photos

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.680 
in JPEG or should you shoot your photos
in<00:06:19.710> RAW<00:06:19.920> the<00:06:20.310> truth<00:06:20.580> is<00:06:20.820> you<00:06:21.030> can<00:06:21.240> get<00:06:21.390> great

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:21.690 
in RAW the truth is you can get great

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:23.870 
in RAW the truth is you can get great
quality<00:06:21.900> photos<00:06:22.530> from<00:06:22.680> JPEG<00:06:23.190> in<00:06:23.400> fact<00:06:23.640> for

about 6 or 7 years

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:28.340 
about 6 or 7 years
I<00:06:25.290> shot<00:06:25.860> strictly<00:06:26.670> in<00:06:26.760> JPEG<00:06:27.420> I<00:06:27.450> tried<00:06:27.960> raw

I shot strictly in JPEG I tried raw

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:31.070 
I shot strictly in JPEG I tried raw
years<00:06:29.160> ago<00:06:29.610> and<00:06:29.880> at<00:06:30.270> the<00:06:30.300> time<00:06:30.450> the<00:06:30.840> software

sucked the computer I was working on was

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.470 
sucked the computer I was working on was
really<00:06:33.570> slow<00:06:34.020> and<00:06:34.290> my<00:06:34.680> workflow<00:06:35.370> was<00:06:35.940> really

really slow and my workflow was really

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.840 
really slow and my workflow was really
horrendous<00:06:36.720> I<00:06:37.290> hated<00:06:37.860> it<00:06:38.130> so<00:06:38.280> I<00:06:38.340> stopped<00:06:38.700> using

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:38.850 
horrendous I hated it so I stopped using

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:40.190 
horrendous I hated it so I stopped using
raw<00:06:39.270> and<00:06:39.540> I<00:06:39.750> shot

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:40.200 
raw and I shot

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.440 
raw and I shot
JPG<00:06:40.560> exclusively<00:06:41.340> and<00:06:41.520> i<00:06:41.790> was<00:06:41.970> very<00:06:42.300> happy

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:42.450 
JPG exclusively and i was very happy

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:44.720 
JPG exclusively and i was very happy
with<00:06:42.930> my<00:06:43.140> images<00:06:43.560> when<00:06:43.920> i<00:06:43.950> went<00:06:44.310> back<00:06:44.490> and

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:44.730 
with my images when i went back and

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:47.090 
with my images when i went back and
tried<00:06:45.000> raw<00:06:45.270> again<00:06:45.600> i<00:06:45.840> was<00:06:46.320> comparing<00:06:46.800> the

tried raw again i was comparing the

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:49.610 
tried raw again i was comparing the

JPEG<00:06:49.860> images<00:06:50.490> and<00:06:50.730> I<00:06:51.360> found<00:06:51.750> because<00:06:52.470> I<00:06:52.500> had<00:06:52.710> a

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:52.740 
JPEG images and I found because I had a

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:54.950 
JPEG images and I found because I had a
better<00:06:53.010> computer<00:06:53.460> and<00:06:53.790> the<00:06:54.150> software<00:06:54.750> had

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:54.960 
better computer and the software had

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:56.270 
better computer and the software had
gotten<00:06:55.260> better<00:06:55.410> over<00:06:55.560> the<00:06:55.830> years

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:56.280 
gotten better over the years

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:59.270 
gotten better over the years
that<00:06:56.610> it<00:06:56.790> was<00:06:56.940> easier<00:06:57.570> for<00:06:58.020> me<00:06:58.170> to<00:06:58.200> process<00:06:58.830> my

that it was easier for me to process my

that it was easier for me to process my

RAW files than it was my JPEGs it was

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:04.790 
RAW files than it was my JPEGs it was
faster<00:07:02.550> than<00:07:02.760> processing<00:07:03.690> my<00:07:03.930> JPEGs<00:07:04.410> and<00:07:04.710> the

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:04.800 
faster than processing my JPEGs and the

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.670 
faster than processing my JPEGs and the
quality<00:07:05.460> and<00:07:05.700> the<00:07:06.210> look<00:07:06.450> of<00:07:06.630> the<00:07:06.690> photos<00:07:07.170> was

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:07.680 
quality and the look of the photos was

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.950 
quality and the look of the photos was
better<00:07:08.100> so<00:07:08.670> at<00:07:08.790> that<00:07:08.910> point<00:07:09.120> I<00:07:09.330> switched<00:07:09.840> to

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:09.960 
better so at that point I switched to

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:12.080 
better so at that point I switched to
raw<00:07:10.170> and<00:07:10.470> I<00:07:10.710> never<00:07:11.010> looked<00:07:11.280> back<00:07:11.340> and<00:07:11.760> I<00:07:11.820> shoot

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:12.090 
raw and I never looked back and I shoot

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:14.510 
raw and I never looked back and I shoot
exclusively<00:07:12.960> in<00:07:13.110> RAW<00:07:13.290> now<00:07:13.620> there<00:07:14.190> are<00:07:14.310> some

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:14.520 
exclusively in RAW now there are some

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:16.280 
exclusively in RAW now there are some
photographers<00:07:15.150> out<00:07:15.330> there<00:07:15.540> who<00:07:15.720> will<00:07:15.840> say<00:07:15.900> if

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:31.560 
give raw a try that doesn't mean you

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:33.530 
give raw a try that doesn't mean you
have<00:07:31.590> to<00:07:31.860> stick<00:07:32.160> with<00:07:32.190> raw<00:07:32.580> but<00:07:33.210> I<00:07:33.240> would
