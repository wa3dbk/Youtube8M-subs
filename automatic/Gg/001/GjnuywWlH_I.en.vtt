00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:28.130
 use the different options that 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.860

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:34.520

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:41.000
 different vouchers to be able to put them is 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.579
 very simple normally with you I 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.429
 dais to build vale 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:48.620
 what is the kitchen doing the kitchen or 

00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:50.420
 is going to come out here down this countertops 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.239
 automatic and it's going to come out like that 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:56.719
 you have activated if you see that you are 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:01:00.500
 activated as you see then only go to 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:03.199
 be able to put these countertops like this for 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.239
 be able to put the different types of 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:09.560
 countertops or small cabinets that we 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:13.220
 allows the game we are going to have to 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:16.250
 excel of selecting here is worth and as 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:19.870
 You see you are selecting eyes 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:24.540
 this and here you have the different ones 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:27.960
 furniture countertops that you can place 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.270
 well directly from here you give him 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.150
 here to the pancakes and also going to 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:37.020
 Ditto out 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:40.440
 for example let's do with this one 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:43.930
 I know what I want to imagine 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:46.620
 this here is worth for example 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.620
 what else 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.550
 yes 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:56.580
 let's put it here and well then 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:58.860
 let's leave it like that for example with 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.690
 any other furniture as you can see and 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.500
 in the small cabinets is exactly 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:08.160
 The same goes for having the automatic 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:12.220
 deactivated we will be able to place the 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:14.830
 different furniture that allow us 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:18.700
 and now the game when creating what 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:20.970
 what are the kitchens 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:26.420
 according 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:29.000
 the type of countertop that it elijÃ¡is 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.370
 and obviously they change for example 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.560
 the red ones as you see let put the 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.560
 teams cornering the blue ones 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.640
 and well then if you try with all the 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.920
 countertops that you have then it will happen to you 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.820
 exactly the same and good guys 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.820
 I hope it serves you 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:52.160
 that the six because the truth that the 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:55.330
 kitchens are amazing as well and good
