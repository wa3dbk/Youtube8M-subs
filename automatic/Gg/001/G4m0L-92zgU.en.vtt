00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:10.290
 pascal panic and today I'll show you 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.630
 a video of a mirror what without times 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.860
 going 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:18.300
 we are now to talk will a 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:34.020
 Space here with everything but that 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:36.270
 is actually just decoration now so 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.820
 It's not a fake or anything like that 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.160
 do not come in now either 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:50.360
 how that is somehow of the imperial 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:54.390
 can use otherwise and have shown so 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:59.699
 Hope you like the facility 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:02.780
 It's all up to you 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.780
 makes a taste 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.040
 Yes 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.500
 Ann 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.500
 so 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.270
 Here I show you as you follow it 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:22.270
 outside 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:30.920
 that everything is built as you can see 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:33.340
 It's all such a fake one sees the house 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:39.670
 is bigger than it is 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:43.159
 and when it looks in the ring always pure 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.770
 Of course, I can do this too 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:49.039
 believe then you are already how it works 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:51.140
 simply mirrored him 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:53.530
 stop here too we just had to stop 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:57.880
 take care that it does it right 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:59.840
 I wanted to have shown times 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:05.360
 seen in others 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:06.229
 in the videos and would like you so 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:13.959
 have shown 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:13.959
 I did not make a glass because 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:23.810
 you can see it then that's one 

00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:28.010
 Glass pane is was a mirror sees 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:31.340
 quite so, and I know that now 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.680
 just as the room the video but me 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:39.459
 I also like to have shown for the times 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:43.150

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.150
