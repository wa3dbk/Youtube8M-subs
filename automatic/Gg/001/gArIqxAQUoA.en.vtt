mounts now you've seen a Thor tale by
mounts<00:00:19.119> that<00:00:19.150> we<00:00:19.300> have<00:00:19.449> that<00:00:19.599> extend<00:00:19.960> the

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:20.019 
mounts that we have that extend the

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:21.929 
mounts that we have that extend the
light<00:00:20.199> a<00:00:20.230> little<00:00:20.439> bit<00:00:20.619> further<00:00:20.830> to<00:00:21.550> allow<00:00:21.730> for

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:21.939 
light a little bit further to allow for

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:23.999 
light a little bit further to allow for
a<00:00:21.970> better<00:00:22.090> weapon<00:00:22.300> circulation<00:00:22.990> to<00:00:23.349> to<00:00:23.830> get<00:00:23.980> a

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:24.009 
a better weapon circulation to to get a

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:26.099 
a better weapon circulation to to get a
really<00:00:24.490> low<00:00:24.640> profile<00:00:25.090> lightweight<00:00:25.900> ergonomic

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:26.109 
really low profile lightweight ergonomic

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:28.919 
really low profile lightweight ergonomic
light<00:00:26.830> mount<00:00:27.070> that<00:00:27.730> gets<00:00:28.300> the<00:00:28.390> light<00:00:28.570> out<00:00:28.720> away

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:28.929 
light mount that gets the light out away

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:30.779 
light mount that gets the light out away
from<00:00:28.960> where<00:00:29.230> your<00:00:29.320> hands<00:00:29.529> need<00:00:29.769> to<00:00:29.830> be<00:00:29.980> well

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:30.789 
from where your hands need to be well

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:32.790 
from where your hands need to be well
it's<00:00:31.750> kind<00:00:31.929> of<00:00:31.960> difficult<00:00:32.140> sometimes<00:00:32.470> when

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:32.800 
it's kind of difficult sometimes when

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.420 
it's kind of difficult sometimes when
you're<00:00:32.920> running<00:00:33.160> an<00:00:33.310> SBR<00:00:34.890> so<00:00:35.890> we<00:00:36.040> created<00:00:36.340> an

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:36.430 
you're running an SBR so we created an

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.070 
you're running an SBR so we created an
SBR<00:00:36.730> forum<00:00:37.090> tail<00:00:37.300> so<00:00:37.480> it's<00:00:37.630> a<00:00:37.660> little<00:00:37.810> bit<00:00:37.900> of<00:00:37.990> a

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:38.080 
SBR forum tail so it's a little bit of a

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.110 
SBR forum tail so it's a little bit of a
shorter<00:00:38.500> version<00:00:38.770> as<00:00:39.220> you<00:00:39.250> can<00:00:39.460> see<00:00:39.640> here<00:00:39.910> and

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.120 
shorter version as you can see here and

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.180 
shorter version as you can see here and
it's<00:00:40.780> great<00:00:41.050> for<00:00:41.230> short<00:00:41.470> barrels<00:00:41.830> like<00:00:41.950> this

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.190 
it's great for short barrels like this

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.760 
it's great for short barrels like this
so<00:00:42.820> now<00:00:43.540> I<00:00:43.570> can<00:00:43.810> be<00:00:43.900> picking<00:00:44.230> me<00:00:44.290> not<00:00:44.440> on<00:00:44.560> any

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:44.770 
so now I can be picking me not on any

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:46.200 
so now I can be picking me not on any
weapons<00:00:45.100> system<00:00:45.370> keep<00:00:45.520> in<00:00:45.610> mind<00:00:45.790> you<00:00:46.000> put<00:00:46.120> it

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.210 
weapons system keep in mind you put it

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.680 
weapons system keep in mind you put it
on<00:00:46.330> a<00:00:46.510> score<00:00:46.960> you<00:00:47.110> put<00:00:47.260> on<00:00:47.350> a<00:00:47.410> standard<00:00:47.980> m4<00:00:48.690> but

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:49.690 
on a score you put on a standard m4 but

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.360 
on a score you put on a standard m4 but
obviously<00:00:50.290> that's<00:00:50.440> what<00:00:50.650> your<00:00:50.800> your<00:00:51.130> regular

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370 
obviously that's what your your regular

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.640 
obviously that's what your your regular
four<00:00:51.700> tails<00:00:51.970> before<00:00:52.390> if<00:00:53.140> you<00:00:53.260> got<00:00:53.380> a<00:00:53.410> longer

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:53.650 
four tails before if you got a longer

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.530 
four tails before if you got a longer
rail<00:00:53.890> system<00:00:54.340> not<00:00:54.760> much<00:00:54.910> of<00:00:55.030> a<00:00:55.120> worry<00:00:55.330> there

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:55.540 
rail system not much of a worry there

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.030 
rail system not much of a worry there
but<00:00:56.020> again<00:00:56.230> if<00:00:56.350> you're<00:00:56.440> trying<00:00:56.680> to<00:00:56.710> keep<00:00:56.830> that

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:57.040 
but again if you're trying to keep that

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.860 
but again if you're trying to keep that
lens<00:00:57.400> away<00:00:57.640> from<00:00:57.910> that<00:00:58.030> flash<00:00:58.270> hider<00:00:58.570> that

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:58.870 
lens away from that flash hider that

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.500 
lens away from that flash hider that
comm<00:00:59.110> this<00:00:59.860> is<00:01:00.010> a<00:01:00.040> great<00:01:00.340> alternative<00:01:00.490> and<00:01:01.150> it

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
comm this is a great alternative and it

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.630 
comm this is a great alternative and it
still<00:01:01.720> keeps<00:01:01.960> it<00:01:02.110> far<00:01:02.320> enough<00:01:02.380> in<00:01:02.830> front<00:01:03.160> so<00:01:03.550> if

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
still keeps it far enough in front so if

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.310 
still keeps it far enough in front so if
you<00:01:03.730> want<00:01:03.880> to<00:01:03.910> use<00:01:04.059> your<00:01:04.239> your<00:01:04.780> thumb<00:01:05.049> or<00:01:05.259> if

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
you want to use your your thumb or if

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:06.450 
you want to use your your thumb or if
you<00:01:05.379> want<00:01:05.500> to<00:01:05.560> use<00:01:05.679> a<00:01:05.710> pressure<00:01:05.920> switch<00:01:06.070> you've

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
you want to use a pressure switch you've

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:07.919 
you want to use a pressure switch you've
got<00:01:06.549> plenty<00:01:06.759> of<00:01:06.909> room<00:01:07.119> on<00:01:07.299> your<00:01:07.329> rail<00:01:07.570> system

00:01:07.919 --> 00:01:07.929 
got plenty of room on your rail system

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:09.389 
got plenty of room on your rail system
left<00:01:08.170> so<00:01:08.320> that's<00:01:08.469> a<00:01:08.560> great<00:01:08.770> great<00:01:09.159> thing<00:01:09.189> about

00:01:09.389 --> 00:01:09.399 
left so that's a great great thing about

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:14.130 
left so that's a great great thing about
this<00:01:11.280> it's<00:01:12.280> optimized<00:01:12.899> again<00:01:13.899> for<00:01:14.079> these

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
this it's optimized again for these

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.630 
this it's optimized again for these
short<00:01:14.409> barrels<00:01:14.710> but<00:01:14.890> it<00:01:14.979> works<00:01:15.159> great<00:01:15.460> if

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
short barrels but it works great if

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.510 
short barrels but it works great if
you're<00:01:15.789> a<00:01:15.850> scout<00:01:16.179> real<00:01:16.479> guy<00:01:16.689> on<00:01:16.899> a<00:01:17.340> k2<00:01:18.340> r<00:01:18.369> unning

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
you're a scout real guy on a k2 r unning

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.940 
you're a scout real guy on a k2 r unning
Scout<00:01:18.729> real<00:01:18.969> so<00:01:19.329> I<00:01:19.539> keep<00:01:20.079> my<00:01:20.229> t1<00:01:20.590> on<00:01:20.679> there<00:01:20.829> but

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950 
Scout real so I keep my t1 on there but

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:22.679 
Scout real so I keep my t1 on there but
I<00:01:20.979> can<00:01:21.130> also<00:01:21.280> add<00:01:21.579> that<00:01:21.759> SPR<00:01:22.179> throw<00:01:22.420> and<00:01:22.570> tail

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:22.689 
I can also add that SPR throw and tail

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:24.690 
I can also add that SPR throw and tail
now<00:01:22.960> which<00:01:23.560> puts<00:01:23.829> that<00:01:23.950> white<00:01:24.130> in<00:01:24.249> the<00:01:24.310> perfect

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
now which puts that white in the perfect

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.080 
now which puts that white in the perfect
position<00:01:24.789> next<00:01:25.210> to<00:01:25.299> that<00:01:25.450> gas<00:01:25.749> block<00:01:26.969> but<00:01:27.969> you

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
position next to that gas block but you

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.459 
position next to that gas block but you
can<00:01:28.210> not<00:01:28.359> enough<00:01:28.600> pretty<00:01:28.840> much<00:01:28.990> any<00:01:29.140> weapon

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:29.469 
can not enough pretty much any weapon

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:31.440 
can not enough pretty much any weapon
system<00:01:29.799> a<00:01:29.859> rail<00:01:30.039> system<00:01:30.399> that<00:01:30.429> you<00:01:30.640> want<00:01:30.850> the

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
system a rail system that you want the
