00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:32.610 
let's see how it looks and runs on a
sony<00:00:59.730> xperia<00:01:00.059> z1<00:01:00.510> compact

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:32.620 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:48.480 

Oh

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.840 

once<00:01:49.490> again<00:01:49.670> you<00:01:49.969> can<00:01:50.179> see<00:01:50.420> that<00:01:51.850> although

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
once again you can see that although

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.120 
once again you can see that although
game<00:01:53.270> is<00:01:53.450> running<00:01:53.840> smooth<00:01:54.170> but<00:01:54.500> the<00:01:54.679> graphics

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
game is running smooth but the graphics

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.999 
game is running smooth but the graphics
are<00:01:55.280> not<00:01:55.490> full<00:01:55.819> and<00:01:56.179> there<00:01:57.170> is<00:01:57.259> no<00:01:57.470> crowd<00:01:57.799> on

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:01.569 
are not full and there is no crowd on
the<00:01:58.130> street<00:01:58.429> and<00:01:58.700> the<00:01:59.030> headlights<00:01:59.450> are<00:02:00.340> not<00:02:01.340> on

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:01.579 
the street and the headlights are not on

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:05.080 
the street and the headlights are not on
so<00:02:02.179> there<00:02:03.020> are<00:02:03.049> still<00:02:03.500> missing<00:02:04.460> pieces<00:02:04.819> you

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
so there are still missing pieces you

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.109 
so there are still missing pieces you
see<00:02:05.240> headlights<00:02:05.719> are<00:02:05.960> not<00:02:06.170> on<00:02:06.380> and<00:02:06.850> not<00:02:07.850> much

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
see headlights are not on and not much

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.900 
see headlights are not on and not much
crowd<00:02:08.420> on<00:02:08.629> the<00:02:08.869> sides<00:02:09.860> actually<00:02:10.310> nobody<00:02:10.610> is

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
crowd on the sides actually nobody is

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
crowd on the sides actually nobody is
there<00:02:12.310> that's<00:02:13.310> kind<00:02:13.670> of<00:02:13.760> hilarious<00:02:14.239> I<00:02:14.780> believe

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.360 

so<00:02:34.930> that's<00:02:35.170> the<00:02:35.260> problem<00:02:35.560> with<00:02:35.889> the<00:02:36.010> android

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
so that's the problem with the android

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.349 
so that's the problem with the android
gaming<00:02:36.639> because<00:02:36.999> i<00:02:38.730> have<00:02:39.730> seen<00:02:39.969> the<00:02:40.150> many

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:40.359 
gaming because i have seen the many

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:43.589 
gaming because i have seen the many
games<00:02:40.689> like<00:02:41.109> that<00:02:41.139> where<00:02:42.090> that<00:02:43.090> developers

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:43.599 
games like that where that developers

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:46.369 
games like that where that developers
are<00:02:43.870> actually<00:02:44.290> not<00:02:44.469> updating<00:02:44.980> their<00:02:45.159> games

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:46.379

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:50.970 
are actually not updating their games
for<00:02:47.379> latest<00:02:47.799> phones<00:02:48.450> or<00:02:49.450> if<00:02:50.049> even<00:02:50.590> if<00:02:50.709> they<00:02:50.859> are

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
for latest phones or if even if they are

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.280 
for latest phones or if even if they are
updating<00:02:51.189> it<00:02:51.670> it<00:02:51.909> will<00:02:52.269> take<00:02:52.420> actually<00:02:52.810> very

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
updating it it will take actually very

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.280 
updating it it will take actually very
long<00:02:53.590> time<00:02:54.090> for<00:02:55.090> them<00:02:55.299> to<00:02:55.329> update<00:02:55.750> the<00:02:56.109> game

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
long time for them to update the game

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:02.069 
long time for them to update the game
that's<00:02:57.159> ridiculous<00:02:58.030> i<00:02:58.569> believe<00:02:59.340> and<00:03:01.019> now<00:03:02.019> the

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:02.079
