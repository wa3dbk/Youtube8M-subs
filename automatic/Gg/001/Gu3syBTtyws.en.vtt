and<00:03:24.530> I<00:03:25.190> was<00:03:25.670> a<00:03:25.700> bit<00:03:25.880> hesitant<00:03:26.090> because<00:03:26.630> I<00:03:26.959> don't

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
and I was a bit hesitant because I don't

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.110 
and I was a bit hesitant because I don't
always<00:03:27.230> like<00:03:27.530> it<00:03:27.769> when<00:03:27.800> I<00:03:27.980> go<00:03:28.130> really<00:03:28.459> dark<00:03:28.640> but

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
always like it when I go really dark but

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.150 
always like it when I go really dark but
for<00:03:29.570> some<00:03:29.720> reason<00:03:29.959> I<00:03:30.170> think<00:03:30.560> I<00:03:30.739> really<00:03:30.950> suits

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
for some reason I think I really suits

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.150 
for some reason I think I really suits
it<00:03:31.280> at<00:03:31.340> the<00:03:31.400> moment<00:03:31.730> and<00:03:31.940> and<00:03:32.410> what<00:03:33.410> I<00:03:33.440> did<00:03:33.769> was
