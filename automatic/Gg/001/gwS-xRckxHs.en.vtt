00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.300
 So after all these things the Internet as a place of conquest that we think today 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:10.019
 The chapter of information The nature of the internet that various information is shared 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:15.450
 Will 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:20.460
 Right to be forgotten that at the same time praying that happened deny specific Internet properties 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:22.500
 In its own legislation the amount of sugar present is pretty, I am very different extremes 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.220
 Right to pursue direction 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:30.080
 And considering the extreme sensibility of the second joyful consideration 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.080
 Thank you for your 4 tanks . 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:47.010
 Would the current situation, assess each end of the second half to give off any assessment What 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:50.100
 Now the highland is in front of me. 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:54.210
 Front and back podium for final 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:57.239
 The team that will receive the choice of a 30-person discussion group 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.489
 A brave torrent with solid logic 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:03.140
 As long as you stab at the core, 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.140
 Half of the expected 4 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.390
 er 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:16.300
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:16.780
 We still have ratings on the judges . 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:22.330
 Give me 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:25.600
 Currently, this code is currently being implemented in Europe , 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:29.530
 Oh, I thought it was great to spit that out. 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:32.470
 And the two teams were able to logically evolve , and 4 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:37.540
 I thought the potatoes were coming up with a team that could climb. 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:42.119
 We have made the term a little more popular and persuaded by people 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:46.570
 In order to get it, I 'd like to tell you enough 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:51.070
 It would have helped me to get more of myself. 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:55.660
 We think that the team provided pretty important points to this. 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:59.170
 That ate Knit the nature of the internship on the Internet of representation of the people's right to know 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:03.789
 Side effects after the legislation of freedom and extremism 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:08.380
 I think that these problems were important hunts that were very important to shake off. 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:14.170
 Nevertheless, the sadness of the characters Agency developed the story so we can later upset 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:15.850
 I think it's very important that the story grows in the breath. 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:20.200
 I have a feeling I did not. 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:24.910
 And then there's the side of it that says Ron the Ron. 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.720
 Ah, those arguments were very realistic and only angled in the seeds 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.010
 Seems to 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:33.820
 On the bigger side , either of these two things, privacy and expression 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:36.160
 Inde two conflicts, such as how we can not neglect its weight 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:40.690
 I think it was a matter of adjusting it. 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:43.510
 So on that term and on the Toran side I carry a very specific trust 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:47.140
 Yes. Let 's go . Let 's go . 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:51.840
 If I've posted on the Internet daejabo it is rewrote as tteora 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:56.049
 On the other hand, until the end of God , 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:59.799
 I have to first refute the example presented in the contact. 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:01.600
 For example, it's not the same person who posted it on Sun's Internet on Sun. 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:05.440
 Do not you have to ask now? 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:08.470
 The second question is why companies are the problem of self- organization. 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:12.850
 That culture is ahninya going wrong that the other issues 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:16.660
 In the third case, for example, in such a case, 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:19.599
 You know a place approved lifting the examples which the Commission followed a neutral position ohdeon yireonde 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:24.280
 I had never been a party member since I did not have this person, 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:28.599
 I do not want to be disruptive or disruptive , 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:32.050
 I have to give concrete details, but I also have a team that can raise 4 potatoes 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:37.680
 It's logically awkward to say that you are. 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:37.680
 Select can not be written staccato truly a gentleman selection committee
