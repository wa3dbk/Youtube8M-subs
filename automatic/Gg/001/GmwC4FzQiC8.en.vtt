00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:06.940
 good to all has still come to the pp 

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:09.779
 so let's see his his animations 

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.779
 audio first 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:46.950
 and now let's see their skills 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:49.200
 the one that throws a boomerang 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.480
 returns on impact with the first 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.270
 enemies and the real ones in chalk 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:58.030
 let's go to see her 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:01.150
 and if we recover that number it 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:04.000
 restores much of the speed 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:05.560
 from the coll where 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.659
 of the skill we're going to try it 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.980
 again 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:14.190
 when caught it reduces the cold or more 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:15.870
 the double is a passive skill that 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.520
 does magic damage equals the percentage of 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:20.600
 life every third attack and gives us 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.600
 movement speed 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.820
 it's a jump that if we jump over a 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.240
 unit comes back to jump in it 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.240
 address 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:39.600
 witty we can use it only when 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.890
 our passive passive is activated 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.110
 It is this bar that is filling up 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.560
 as we hit when the bar 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:49.729
 it fills up we transform into mega nothing 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.729
 let's see this 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.590
 Well there turn them into medium 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.930
 is now the one who threw a stone that 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.750
 slows down and hits all those who are 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:10.750
 around where the w impacts makes a 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:13.069
 jump that also slows everyone 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.170
 the w 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.620
 stun the enemies that we have 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.620
 in front of 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.120
 good but let's go now to the w we see that 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:25.730
 Stun all those in front of us and 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.709
 the last one pushes then if to a 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.659
 address and if it collides against 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.300
 Some wall or structure 

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:33.220
 students 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.880
 well these have all been 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.880
 dinar skills 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.569
 he is supposedly a champion of top plane 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:44.890
 but I think it's very considerable 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:44.890
 to use in the jungle too 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.600
 he is very mobile 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.710
 the truth that to me sincerely I 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.710
 fascinated 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:02.230
 I hope you enjoyed it 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.230
 and we go with the animation of recale or 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.420
 thank you and see you
