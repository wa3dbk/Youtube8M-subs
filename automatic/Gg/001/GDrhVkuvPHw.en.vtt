all<00:00:01.260> right<00:00:01.439> welcome<00:00:01.709> from<00:00:02.159> mainland<00:00:02.460> cycle

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
all right welcome from mainland cycle

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.990 
all right welcome from mainland cycle
Center<00:00:03.120> today<00:00:03.629> we're<00:00:03.899> going<00:00:04.020> to<00:00:04.080> look<00:00:04.259> at<00:00:04.470> a

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:05.000 
Center today we're going to look at a

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:13.490 
Center today we're going to look at a
2012<00:00:06.000> kawasaki<00:00:06.899> brute<00:00:07.550> force<00:00:09.139> 654<00:00:10.139> by<00:00:10.639> 4pi<00:00:12.500> the

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
2012 kawasaki brute force 654 by 4pi the

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.730 
2012 kawasaki brute force 654 by 4pi the
eye<00:00:13.530> means<00:00:14.309> independent<00:00:15.240> suspension<00:00:16.230> so<00:00:16.560> this

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
eye means independent suspension so this

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.620 
eye means independent suspension so this
has<00:00:16.949> fully<00:00:17.279> independent<00:00:18.029> front<00:00:18.300> and<00:00:18.480> rear

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
has fully independent front and rear

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.359 
has fully independent front and rear
suspension

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
suspension

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.310 
suspension
it's<00:00:20.760> a<00:00:20.880> 650<00:00:21.600> CC<00:00:22.550> this<00:00:23.550> is<00:00:23.820> a<00:00:23.850> v-twin<00:00:24.689> engine

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
it's a 650 CC this is a v-twin engine

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.140 
it's a 650 CC this is a v-twin engine
so<00:00:25.529> not<00:00:25.710> a<00:00:25.800> single<00:00:26.160> cylinder<00:00:26.460> it<00:00:26.609> has<00:00:26.789> two

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
so not a single cylinder it has two

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.450 
so not a single cylinder it has two
cylinders<00:00:27.810> and<00:00:28.800> they're<00:00:28.980> in<00:00:29.099> a<00:00:29.220> V

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
cylinders and they're in a V

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:36.290 
cylinders and they're in a V
configuration<00:00:30.390> so<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:30.660> v-twin<00:00:31.880> 650<00:00:35.120> these<00:00:36.120> are

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
configuration so a v-twin 650 these are

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.970 
configuration so a v-twin 650 these are
water<00:00:36.510> cooled<00:00:37.579> the<00:00:38.579> 650s<00:00:39.329> our<00:00:40.079> 650<00:00:40.710> s<00:00:40.770> make<00:00:40.950> a

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
water cooled the 650s our 650 s make a

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.750 
water cooled the 650s our 650 s make a
lot<00:00:41.250> of<00:00:41.399> power<00:00:42.890> really<00:00:43.890> there's<00:00:44.129> nothing<00:00:44.610> on

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
lot of power really there's nothing on

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.310 
lot of power really there's nothing on
the<00:00:44.850> market<00:00:45.030> with<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:45.390> single<00:00:45.780> cylinder<00:00:46.020> motor

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
the market with a single cylinder motor

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.139 
the market with a single cylinder motor
that<00:00:46.920> will<00:00:47.070> run<00:00:47.309> with<00:00:47.520> this<00:00:47.610> 650<00:00:49.940> it's<00:00:50.940> just

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
that will run with this 650 it's just

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.060 
that will run with this 650 it's just
hard<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.449> compete<00:00:51.870> with<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.530> two<00:00:52.800> power

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
hard to compete with the two power

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.610 
hard to compete with the two power
pulses<00:00:53.340> of<00:00:53.730> that<00:00:53.850> v-twin<00:00:54.360> so<00:00:55.199> these<00:00:55.379> run

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
pulses of that v-twin so these run

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.099 
pulses of that v-twin so these run
really<00:00:55.949> nice<00:00:56.420> very<00:00:57.420> good<00:00:57.480> performing

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
really nice very good performing

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.729 
really nice very good performing
machines<00:00:58.500> it's<00:00:59.399> an<00:00:59.520> automatic<00:00:59.940> transmission

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
machines it's an automatic transmission

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:02.779 
machines it's an automatic transmission
it's<00:01:01.739> a<00:01:01.800> little<00:01:02.160> look<00:01:02.340> at<00:01:02.430> your<00:01:02.579> torque

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
it's a little look at your torque

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.250 
it's a little look at your torque
converter<00:01:03.149> of<00:01:03.390> course<00:01:03.600> you<00:01:03.719> can<00:01:03.840> kind<00:01:04.049> of<00:01:04.080> see

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
converter of course you can kind of see

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.929 
converter of course you can kind of see
the<00:01:04.379> front<00:01:04.619> silver<00:01:04.949> going<00:01:05.159> forward<00:01:05.610> you<00:01:05.760> can't

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
the front silver going forward you can't

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.310 
the front silver going forward you can't
really<00:01:06.150> see<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.420> rear<00:01:06.600> silver<00:01:06.930> going<00:01:07.110> back

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
really see the rear silver going back

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.679 
really see the rear silver going back
but<00:01:07.680> it's<00:01:08.250> there<00:01:08.490> we'll<00:01:09.210> go<00:01:09.330> around<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.570> other

there<00:02:23.079> and<00:02:23.370> it's<00:02:24.370> on<00:02:24.579> the<00:02:24.700> drive<00:02:24.910> shaft<00:02:25.209> coming

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
there and it's on the drive shaft coming

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.259 
there and it's on the drive shaft coming
back<00:02:25.690> and<00:02:26.190> that<00:02:27.190> brake<00:02:27.430> is<00:02:27.640> built<00:02:27.850> into<00:02:28.150> this

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:28.269 
back and that brake is built into this

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:29.970 
back and that brake is built into this
rear<00:02:28.510> housing<00:02:28.690> it's<00:02:29.079> called<00:02:29.260> a<00:02:29.350> multi-disc

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
rear housing it's called a multi-disc

rear housing it's called a multi-disc
wet<00:02:30.280> rear<00:02:30.489> brake<00:02:30.820> and<00:02:32.430> it<00:02:33.430> works<00:02:33.640> really<00:02:33.850> good

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
wet rear brake and it works really good

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.140 
wet rear brake and it works really good
it's<00:02:34.870> clean<00:02:35.079> you'll<00:02:36.040> probably<00:02:36.280> never<00:02:36.640> replace

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
it's clean you'll probably never replace

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.000 
it's clean you'll probably never replace
those<00:02:37.359> brake<00:02:37.570> pads<00:02:37.810> we<00:02:38.019> have<00:02:38.049> yet<00:02:38.410> to<00:02:38.440> replace

shift that tool drive full drive there

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.420 
shift that tool drive full drive there
and<00:03:41.390> then<00:03:42.019> you<00:03:42.140> also<00:03:42.170> have<00:03:42.650> a<00:03:42.680> locking<00:03:43.040> front

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
and then you also have a locking front

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.509 
and then you also have a locking front
differential<00:03:43.849> meaning<00:03:44.360> when<00:03:45.080> you're<00:03:45.260> in

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
differential meaning when you're in

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:48.009 
differential meaning when you're in
two-wheel<00:03:46.519> drive<00:03:46.790> of<00:03:47.150> course<00:03:47.180> just<00:03:47.660> the<00:03:47.780> rear

two-wheel drive of course just the rear
wheels<00:03:48.260> are<00:03:48.410> driving<00:03:48.860> and<00:03:49.010> then<00:03:49.700> you<00:03:49.790> put<00:03:49.970> it

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
wheels are driving and then you put it

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:51.250 
wheels are driving and then you put it
in<00:03:50.150> four-wheel<00:03:50.390> drive<00:03:50.720> and<00:03:50.780> you<00:03:51.019> gauge<00:03:51.230> the

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
in four-wheel drive and you gauge the

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.080 
in four-wheel drive and you gauge the
front<00:03:51.650> end<00:03:51.830> the<00:03:51.950> front<00:03:52.190> end<00:03:52.340> is<00:03:52.489> a<00:03:52.519> limited

front end the front end is a limited

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.809 
front end the front end is a limited
slip<00:03:53.239> front<00:03:53.720> differential<00:03:54.250> and<00:03:55.250> so<00:03:55.700> the

00:03:55.809 --> 00:03:55.819 
slip front differential and so the

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:57.190 
slip front differential and so the

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
limited slip is going to try to send

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:02.289 
limited slip is going to try to send
power<00:03:57.549> to<00:03:58.549> the<00:03:58.670> wheel<00:03:58.849> that<00:03:58.880> has<00:03:59.060> traction<00:04:01.299> but

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:02.299 
power to the wheel that has traction but

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:03.940 
power to the wheel that has traction but
and<00:04:02.750> they<00:04:02.870> do<00:04:02.989> a<00:04:03.019> pretty<00:04:03.200> good<00:04:03.319> job<00:04:03.590> in<00:04:03.860> the

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
and they do a pretty good job in the

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:05.229 
and they do a pretty good job in the
majority<00:04:04.340> of<00:04:04.400> time<00:04:04.549> you've<00:04:04.730> gotta<00:04:04.880> run<00:04:05.060> it<00:04:05.150> in

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:05.239 
majority of time you've gotta run it in

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:07.539 
majority of time you've gotta run it in
that<00:04:05.360> mode<00:04:05.599> but<00:04:05.959> if<00:04:06.079> you<00:04:06.170> find<00:04:06.440> yourself<00:04:06.829> not

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:07.549 
that mode but if you find yourself not

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:09.100 
that mode but if you find yourself not
getting<00:04:07.970> full<00:04:08.180> traction<00:04:08.510> to<00:04:08.780> both<00:04:08.930> front

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:09.110 
getting full traction to both front

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:10.630 
getting full traction to both front
wheels<00:04:09.410> like<00:04:09.590> the<00:04:09.739> bike<00:04:09.950> you<00:04:10.130> can<00:04:10.280> pull<00:04:10.489> this

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 
wheels like the bike you can pull this

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.460 
wheels like the bike you can pull this
lever<00:04:10.849> and<00:04:10.970> hold<00:04:11.209> it<00:04:11.390> and<00:04:11.870> that<00:04:11.989> locks<00:04:12.230> the

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 
lever and hold it and that locks the

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:15.339 
lever and hold it and that locks the
front<00:04:12.680> differential<00:04:13.160> and<00:04:13.930> it<00:04:14.930> works<00:04:15.140> really

00:04:15.339 --> 00:04:15.349 
front differential and it works really

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:16.930 
front differential and it works really
good<00:04:15.560> because<00:04:15.799> you<00:04:15.950> don't<00:04:16.190> need<00:04:16.310> a<00:04:16.370> lock<00:04:16.639> for<00:04:16.910> a

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
good because you don't need a lock for a

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.060 
good because you don't need a lock for a
long<00:04:17.060> time<00:04:17.329> you<00:04:17.959> only<00:04:18.079> need<00:04:18.260> it<00:04:18.320> lock<00:04:18.530> for<00:04:18.889> a

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
long time you only need it lock for a

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:20.529 
long time you only need it lock for a
few<00:04:19.310> seconds<00:04:19.639> to<00:04:19.700> the<00:04:19.789> time<00:04:19.970> usually<00:04:20.150> to<00:04:20.389> get

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:20.539
