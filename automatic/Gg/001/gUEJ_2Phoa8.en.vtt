00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.910
 Hello dear friends today 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:09.990
 let's talk about the modules and crew of the tank 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:15.330
 iz-3 we will start with the ammo lay 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:17.220
 This tank is located on the sides of the tower 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.260
 This tank here in this part 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.560
 marked in orange on the right 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:26.849
 parts and drain and mark the area 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:29.029
 and also on the sides of the hull also 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:34.710
 marked orange on the right and 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:37.680
 on the left is marked in blue 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:41.850
 the location of the fuel tanks on the right and 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:45.030
 on the left is similar to cover 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.969
 tanks should but also need and remember about 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.500
 the fact that on the sides of the hull of the tank is-3 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.590
 There are bronelists in Poland 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:56.809
 so punch your tank into ammunition 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:59.899
 and the fuel tanks are pretty hard 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:02.579
 the rear of the tank hull is located 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:05.460
 engine tank not stern 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.369
 recommended yes it is stupid if you 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:12.360
 will tank aft then the enemy of you 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:16.259
 put a gun here is marked yellow 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:21.600
 the blue color indicates the mechanism 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:24.840
 turning the caterpillar towers marked 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:28.920
 blue is also grace 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:31.079
 this tank is located in the tower in 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.329
 the left front of its here are marked 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.650
 black 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:38.490
 izar stocks located appliances 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.990
 observations now about where 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.460
 crew is located 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:46.920
 This tank commander is located in 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:49.159
 assigned to the turret of the tank in blue to the left 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:55.409
 and and the part to the right of the commander is 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:58.880
 loader gunner slightly in front of 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:01.890
 commander on the left of the tank tower and 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:05.700
 driver is located in 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.649
 front of the hull of the tank where we 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:11.700
 is the top bronelist here 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:13.410
 uniquely here in green and now 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.470
 a few words about how to play 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:20.660
 on this tank, I advise on this 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:24.140
 tank ride example out of the buildings 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:27.989
 substitute the back of the case and 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.530
 since the enemy is here not to pierce you 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.930
 will be able 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:34.920
 well, if this is not some tank 10 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:37.470
 otherwise itâ€™s also possible 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:41.090
 tank turret since the tower is given 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:46.040
 Tank pretty strong and breaking through 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:48.180
 opponents will be hard work as well 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.400
 non-penetration is due to the fact that 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:54.150
 pretty good armor slope angles 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:57.450
 sheets on this dear friends i 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.860
 I finish my review on modules not 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.440
 crew of IS-3 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.750
