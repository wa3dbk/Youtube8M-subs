truck bedliner industry bed liners are
what<00:00:41.800> they<00:00:41.920> spray<00:00:42.249> in<00:00:42.309> the<00:00:42.429> back<00:00:42.609> of<00:00:42.760> pickup

00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:43.059 
what they spray in the back of pickup

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:45.660 
what they spray in the back of pickup
trucks<00:00:43.170> it's<00:00:44.170> a<00:00:44.260> two-part<00:00:44.949> system<00:00:45.219> that's

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:45.670 
trucks it's a two-part system that's

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.000 
trucks it's a two-part system that's
sprayed<00:00:46.510> on<00:00:46.749> at<00:00:46.929> a<00:00:46.989> very<00:00:47.199> high<00:00:47.379> pressure<00:00:47.679> and

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.010 
sprayed on at a very high pressure and

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.520 
sprayed on at a very high pressure and
high<00:00:48.159> temperature<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:49.300> encapsulates<00:00:50.229> the

high temperature and encapsulates the
block<00:00:51.489> of<00:00:51.699> EPS<00:00:52.829> therefore<00:00:53.829> it<00:00:53.979> adds<00:00:54.280> a<00:00:54.550> lot<00:00:54.699> to

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760 
block of EPS therefore it adds a lot to

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.180 
block of EPS therefore it adds a lot to
the<00:00:55.059> strength<00:00:55.479> durability<00:00:56.199> and<00:00:56.800> ruggedness

front and a lot of times it inhibits you
your<00:04:05.830> ability<00:04:06.190> to<00:04:06.310> remove<00:04:06.700> the<00:04:06.910> part<00:04:07.180> that

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 
your ability to remove the part that

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.330 
your ability to remove the part that
you're<00:04:07.510> trying<00:04:07.780> to<00:04:07.900> get<00:04:08.020> to<00:04:08.230> these<00:04:09.010> on<00:04:09.250> the

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
you're trying to get to these on the

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.530 
you're trying to get to these on the
other<00:04:09.400> hand<00:04:09.730> go<00:04:10.060> right<00:04:10.390> underneath<00:04:10.720> the<00:04:10.960> tires

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
other hand go right underneath the tires

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.700 
other hand go right underneath the tires
therefore<00:04:13.540> they're<00:04:13.810> at<00:04:13.930> the<00:04:14.020> outermost<00:04:14.320> edge

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:14.710 
therefore they're at the outermost edge

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:17.820 
therefore they're at the outermost edge
of<00:04:14.890> the<00:04:14.950> car<00:04:15.160> and<00:04:15.460> allow<00:04:16.359> you<00:04:16.420> complete<00:04:17.320> access

of the car and allow you complete access
underneath<00:04:18.299> these<00:04:19.299> come<00:04:19.540> in<00:04:19.630> three<00:04:19.840> sizes

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
underneath these come in three sizes

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:24.060 
underneath these come in three sizes
eight<00:04:20.830> inches<00:04:21.220> tall<00:04:22.170> 10<00:04:23.170> inches<00:04:23.470> tall<00:04:23.740> and

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:27.669 
then in 12 inches height in height we

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:29.909 
then in 12 inches height in height we
also<00:04:27.850> make<00:04:28.150> these<00:04:28.330> in<00:04:28.510> two-piece<00:04:28.990> so<00:04:29.350> that<00:04:29.590> if

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:29.919 
also make these in two-piece so that if

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:30.330 
also make these in two-piece so that if
you

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
you

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.970 
you
having<00:04:30.640> a<00:04:30.730> problem<00:04:31.030> getting<00:04:31.210> that<00:04:31.980> extension

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:32.980 
having a problem getting that extension

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.610 
having a problem getting that extension
out<00:04:33.250> of<00:04:33.370> your<00:04:33.490> floor<00:04:33.790> jack<00:04:33.840> you<00:04:34.840> can<00:04:35.050> go<00:04:35.200> up<00:04:35.380> in

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
out of your floor jack you can go up in

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.380 
out of your floor jack you can go up in
stages<00:04:36.160> so<00:04:36.400> you<00:04:36.670> would<00:04:36.790> be<00:04:36.940> able<00:04:37.120> to<00:04:37.210> basically

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:37.390 
stages so you would be able to basically

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:39.720 
stages so you would be able to basically
go<00:04:37.840> up<00:04:38.020> on<00:04:38.470> a<00:04:38.560> 12-inch<00:04:39.010> you'd<00:04:39.280> be<00:04:39.400> able<00:04:39.490> to<00:04:39.640> go

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:39.730 
go up on a 12-inch you'd be able to go

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:42.210 
go up on a 12-inch you'd be able to go
up<00:04:39.760> six<00:04:40.150> inches<00:04:40.450> and<00:04:40.710> put<00:04:41.710> put<00:04:42.070> these

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
up six inches and put put these

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.490 
up six inches and put put these
underneath<00:04:42.610> the<00:04:42.940> rear<00:04:43.390> tires<00:04:43.690> let<00:04:44.110> the<00:04:44.230> jack

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500 
underneath the rear tires let the jack

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.640 
underneath the rear tires let the jack
down<00:04:44.530> and<00:04:45.220> install<00:04:45.790> a<00:04:46.180> spacer<00:04:47.140> between<00:04:47.170> your

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650 
down and install a spacer between your

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:50.430 
down and install a spacer between your
jack<00:04:48.040> and<00:04:48.400> your<00:04:48.730> jacking<00:04:49.210> point<00:04:49.510> and<00:04:49.780> then<00:04:50.350> it

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
jack and your jacking point and then it

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.350 
jack and your jacking point and then it
would<00:04:50.590> allow<00:04:50.770> your<00:04:50.980> jack<00:04:51.490> to<00:04:51.670> get<00:04:51.820> your<00:04:51.940> car<00:04:52.180> up

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 
would allow your jack to get your car up

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.500 
would allow your jack to get your car up
the<00:04:52.480> rest<00:04:52.720> of<00:04:52.870> the<00:04:52.960> distance<00:04:53.700> this<00:04:54.700> was<00:04:54.910> back

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:55.510 
the rest of the distance this was back

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.050 
the rest of the distance this was back
from<00:04:55.690> customer<00:04:56.170> feedback<00:04:56.620> and<00:04:57.060> what

from customer feedback and what

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.300 
from customer feedback and what

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:02.140 
car goes up in the air the suspension

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:04.770 
car goes up in the air the suspension
drops<00:05:02.500> and<00:05:02.830> hangs<00:05:03.640> so<00:05:04.090> they<00:05:04.300> were<00:05:04.360> unable<00:05:04.630> to

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
drops and hangs so they were unable to

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.040 
drops and hangs so they were unable to
