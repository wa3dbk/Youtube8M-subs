isn't<00:00:57.989> that<00:00:58.260> great<00:00:58.770> I<00:00:59.010> would<00:00:59.129> say<00:00:59.460> it's<00:00:59.760> very

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
isn't that great I would say it's very

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.020 
isn't that great I would say it's very
basic<00:01:00.300> stand<00:01:00.899> all<00:01:01.620> it<00:01:01.859> does<00:01:02.039> is<00:01:02.250> tilt<00:01:02.640> up<00:01:02.879> and

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
basic stand all it does is tilt up and

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.030 
basic stand all it does is tilt up and
down<00:01:03.270> it<00:01:03.480> kind<00:01:03.600> of<00:01:03.690> reminds<00:01:04.019> me<00:01:04.110> of<00:01:04.199> my<00:01:04.350> old<00:01:04.530> LG

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
down it kind of reminds me of my old LG

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.679 
down it kind of reminds me of my old LG
what's<00:01:05.580> really<00:01:05.820> weird<00:01:05.939> is<00:01:06.150> that<00:01:06.180> it<00:01:06.360> tilts

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
what's really weird is that it tilts

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.289 
what's really weird is that it tilts
very<00:01:07.229> very<00:01:07.920> back<00:01:08.280> but<00:01:08.580> doesn't<00:01:08.850> really<00:01:09.030> tilt

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
very very back but doesn't really tilt

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.649 
very very back but doesn't really tilt
that<00:01:09.570> much<00:01:09.810> inwards<00:01:10.820> the<00:01:11.820> stand<00:01:12.090> itself<00:01:12.390> is

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
that much inwards the stand itself is

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.170 
that much inwards the stand itself is
slightly<00:01:13.439> wobbly<00:01:13.920> it's<00:01:14.340> not<00:01:14.549> exactly<00:01:15.000> the

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
slightly wobbly it's not exactly the

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.210 
slightly wobbly it's not exactly the
best<00:01:15.540> stand<00:01:15.900> in<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.110> world<00:01:16.320> but<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:16.860> does<00:01:16.890> the

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
best stand in the world but it does the

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.910 
best stand in the world but it does the
job<00:01:17.270> considering<00:01:18.270> its<00:01:18.360> price<00:01:18.420> range<00:01:18.780> it's<00:01:19.619> not

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
job considering its price range it's not

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.210 
job considering its price range it's not
a<00:01:19.950> big<00:01:20.250> deal<00:01:20.580> for<00:01:20.610> me<00:01:21.080> now<00:01:22.080> what<00:01:22.560> I<00:01:22.590> like<00:01:22.830> again

brightness at 90 at the moment now you

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.030 
brightness at 90 at the moment now you
can<00:01:42.000> use<00:01:42.210> overdrive<00:01:43.049> if<00:01:43.259> you<00:01:43.380> so<00:01:43.590> wish<00:01:43.829> I've

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
can use overdrive if you so wish I've

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.249 
can use overdrive if you so wish I've
got<00:01:44.220> it<00:01:44.310> off<00:01:44.549> just<00:01:45.149> because<00:01:45.360> when<00:01:45.689> I<00:01:45.720> put<00:01:46.020> it<00:01:46.110> on

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
got it off just because when I put it on

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.139 
got it off just because when I put it on
a<00:01:46.290> higher<00:01:46.619> setting<00:01:46.920> even<00:01:47.340> on<00:01:47.430> medium<00:01:47.790> setting

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
a higher setting even on medium setting

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.760 
a higher setting even on medium setting
I<00:01:48.329> realized<00:01:48.810> there<00:01:48.960> was<00:01:49.049> a<00:01:49.079> bit<00:01:49.200> of<00:01:49.290> ghosting

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
I realized there was a bit of ghosting

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.289 
I realized there was a bit of ghosting
and<00:01:49.920> ghosting<00:01:50.340> is<00:01:50.460> when<00:01:50.640> you<00:01:50.759> move<00:01:50.909> your<00:01:51.030> mouse

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
and ghosting is when you move your mouse

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.270 
and ghosting is when you move your mouse
cursor<00:01:51.329> and<00:01:51.960> there's<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:52.409> little<00:01:52.619> ghost<00:01:52.950> behind

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
cursor and there's a little ghost behind

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.160 
cursor and there's a little ghost behind
it<00:01:53.640> so<00:01:53.790> to<00:01:53.850> speak<00:01:53.939> I<00:01:54.360> don't<00:01:54.750> really<00:01:54.899> like<00:01:55.140> that

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
it so to speak I don't really like that

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.730 
it so to speak I don't really like that
and<00:01:55.680> it's<00:01:56.100> not<00:01:56.250> something<00:01:56.640> I<00:01:56.850> like<00:01:57.299> to<00:01:57.630> use<00:01:57.869> but

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
and it's not something I like to use but

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.980

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
when you go to the side you do lose a

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.050 
when you go to the side you do lose a
little<00:02:42.870> bit<00:02:43.020> on<00:02:43.140> the<00:02:43.290> sides<00:02:43.770> over<00:02:44.010> here<00:02:44.130> it

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
little bit on the sides over here it

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.480

goes a little bit more washed out but

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:48.620 
goes a little bit more washed out but
from<00:02:47.730> top<00:02:48.000> to<00:02:48.030> bottom

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
from top to bottom

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.780 
from top to bottom
you<00:02:48.900> hardly<00:02:49.230> lose<00:02:49.470> any<00:02:49.740> of<00:02:49.950> the<00:02:50.100> color<00:02:50.340> so<00:02:50.670> as

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710 
viewing angles are very good and that's

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.820 
viewing angles are very good and that's
natural<00:02:52.920> with<00:02:53.310> a<00:02:53.340> a<00:02:53.550> pls<00:02:54.330> or<00:02:54.570> a<00:02:54.840> similar<00:02:55.440> sort<00:02:55.710> I

monitor<00:03:24.390> is<00:03:24.510> really<00:03:24.870> good<00:03:25.110> not<00:03:25.950> only<00:03:26.160> due<00:03:26.520> to

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
monitor is really good not only due to

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.660 
monitor is really good not only due to
its<00:03:26.760> price<00:03:27.000> about<00:03:27.330> 150<00:03:27.960> pounds<00:03:28.400> 160<00:03:29.400> pounds

downsides<00:03:52.770> as<00:03:52.980> I<00:03:53.130> said<00:03:53.370> was<00:03:53.820> its<00:03:54.150> stand<00:03:54.510> and

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
downsides as I said was its stand and

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.980 
downsides as I said was its stand and
it's<00:03:55.020> sort<00:03:55.410> of<00:03:55.440> build<00:03:55.770> quality<00:03:56.390> of<00:03:57.390> the<00:03:57.600> stands

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:57.990 
it's sort of build quality of the stands

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:00.380 
it's sort of build quality of the stands
the<00:03:58.350> bezels<00:03:58.770> itself<00:03:59.220> are<00:03:59.400> perfect<00:04:00.180> to<00:04:00.270> me

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
the bezels itself are perfect to me

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.840 
the bezels itself are perfect to me
they're<00:04:00.600> not<00:04:00.780> too<00:04:01.440> glossy<00:04:01.770> and<00:04:02.160> neither<00:04:02.640> is<00:04:02.820> a

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
they're not too glossy and neither is a

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:04.070 
they're not too glossy and neither is a
screen<00:04:03.180> by<00:04:03.330> the<00:04:03.390> way<00:04:03.570> it's<00:04:03.750> not<00:04:03.870> on<00:04:03.960> glossy

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
screen by the way it's not on glossy

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.510 
screen by the way it's not on glossy
screen<00:04:04.500> so<00:04:04.710> therefore<00:04:05.040> you<00:04:05.130> don't<00:04:05.220> get<00:04:05.370> too

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:05.520 
screen so therefore you don't get too
