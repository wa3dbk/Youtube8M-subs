00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.680 

what<00:01:45.060> my<00:01:45.240> god<00:01:45.450> reaction<00:01:46.020> was<00:01:47.360> when<00:01:48.360> I<00:01:48.390> first

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:48.690 
what my god reaction was when I first

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.420 
what my god reaction was when I first
supposed<00:01:49.080> to<00:01:49.170> do<00:01:49.290> so<00:01:49.530> why<00:01:49.830> don't<00:01:49.980> we<00:01:50.010> shoot<00:01:50.250> the

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
supposed to do so why don't we shoot the

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.950 
supposed to do so why don't we shoot the
chase<00:01:50.640> for<00:01:50.670> real<00:01:51.120> but<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.600> rest<00:01:51.780> of<00:01:51.870> the

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
chase for real but the rest of the

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.570 
chase for real but the rest of the
studio<00:01:52.290> but<00:01:52.470> we<00:01:52.680> told<00:01:52.890> that<00:01:53.100> wasn't<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.550> idea

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.580 
studio but we told that wasn't the idea

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.090 
studio but we told that wasn't the idea
the<00:01:54.360> idea<00:01:54.390> obviously<00:01:55.050> is<00:01:55.410> that<00:01:55.650> one<00:01:55.830> is<00:01:55.950> able

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
the idea obviously is that one is able

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.920 
the idea obviously is that one is able
to<00:01:56.220> back<00:01:56.430> up<00:01:56.460> a<00:01:56.670> sentence<00:01:57.150> that<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.690> cars

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
to back up a sentence that the cars

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.780 
to back up a sentence that the cars
weren't<00:01:58.260> moving<00:01:58.770> that<00:01:58.950> when<00:01:59.460> we<00:01:59.580> talked<00:01:59.760> to

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
weren't moving that when we talked to

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.330 
weren't moving that when we talked to
the<00:02:00.030> mill<00:02:00.240> bay<00:02:00.570> particularly<00:02:01.320> said<00:02:01.950> we<00:02:02.130> should

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
the mill bay particularly said we should

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.190 
the mill bay particularly said we should
try<00:02:02.580> and<00:02:02.640> do<00:02:02.880> this<00:02:02.910> all<00:02:03.240> for<00:02:03.479> real<00:02:03.660> or<00:02:03.869> try<00:02:04.110> and

so<00:02:18.030> my<00:02:18.209> gut<00:02:18.420> reaction<00:02:18.600> was<00:02:19.080> if<00:02:19.260> we<00:02:19.290> can<00:02:19.560> get<00:02:19.709> the

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
so my gut reaction was if we can get the

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.710 
so my gut reaction was if we can get the
right<00:02:20.070> bunch<00:02:20.340> of<00:02:20.489> people<00:02:20.700> to<00:02:20.820> doing<00:02:21.150> whatever

we're trying to visualize the driving
dynamic<00:02:36.490> characteristics<00:02:37.330> of<00:02:37.570> the<00:02:37.950> Ford<00:02:38.950> cars

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
dynamic characteristics of the Ford cars

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.070 
dynamic characteristics of the Ford cars
through<00:02:39.820> design<00:02:41.250> try<00:02:42.250> to<00:02:42.310> demonstrate<00:02:43.080> that

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
through design try to demonstrate that

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.830 
through design try to demonstrate that
by<00:02:44.280> literally<00:02:45.280> putting<00:02:46.120> a<00:02:46.270> kind<00:02:46.570> to<00:02:46.810> a

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
by literally putting a kind to a

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.530 
by literally putting a kind to a
situation<00:02:47.140> ie<00:02:48.040> in<00:02:48.520> this<00:02:48.700> case<00:02:48.910> a<00:02:48.940> car<00:02:49.240> chase

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
situation ie in this case a car chase

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.560 
situation ie in this case a car chase
and<00:02:49.780> then<00:02:50.440> obviously<00:02:51.160> there's<00:02:51.850> a<00:02:51.910> reveal<00:02:52.330> in

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
and then obviously there's a reveal in

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.690 
and then obviously there's a reveal in
the<00:02:52.690> commercial<00:02:53.110> that<00:02:53.350> shows<00:02:54.010> that<00:02:54.040> these

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
the commercial that shows that these

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:05.990 
the commercial that shows that these
cars<00:02:55.000> in<00:02:55.210> fact<00:02:55.480> we're<00:02:55.870> stationary

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.959 

the<00:03:07.000> car<00:03:07.239> is<00:03:07.450> static<00:03:07.989> at<00:03:08.890> wheels<00:03:09.310> are<00:03:09.579> moving

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:09.969 
the car is static at wheels are moving

00:03:09.969 --> 00:03:12.839 
the car is static at wheels are moving
and<00:03:10.209> the<00:03:10.299> lights<00:03:10.629> moving<00:03:11.079> over<00:03:11.439> it<00:03:11.579> all<00:03:12.579> you've

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:12.849 
and the lights moving over it all you've

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:14.339 
and the lights moving over it all you've
got<00:03:12.879> to<00:03:13.060> do<00:03:13.299> now<00:03:13.540> is<00:03:13.569> to<00:03:13.930> get<00:03:14.019> a<00:03:14.079> background

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:14.349 
got to do now is to get a background

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:16.470 
got to do now is to get a background
moving<00:03:14.950> behind<00:03:15.099> it<00:03:15.519> and<00:03:15.790> it<00:03:16.090> will<00:03:16.180> look<00:03:16.329> like

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
moving behind it and it will look like

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.979 
moving behind it and it will look like
that<00:03:16.719> car<00:03:16.930> is<00:03:17.079> moving<00:03:17.730> that<00:03:18.730> that's<00:03:19.659> fine<00:03:19.930> for

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
that car is moving that that's fine for

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:23.039 
that car is moving that that's fine for
close-ups<00:03:20.590> and<00:03:20.709> miss<00:03:20.950> shots<00:03:21.189> and<00:03:21.930> when<00:03:22.930> you

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
close-ups and miss shots and when you

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:27.089 
close-ups and miss shots and when you
see<00:03:23.290> all<00:03:23.500> the<00:03:23.680> car<00:03:24.090> then<00:03:25.090> you<00:03:25.329> have<00:03:25.569> to<00:03:26.099> make

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:27.099 
see all the car then you have to make

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:29.250 
see all the car then you have to make
sure<00:03:27.129> the<00:03:27.579> angle<00:03:27.970> B<00:03:28.299> shoot<00:03:28.599> the<00:03:28.750> guard<00:03:28.989> adepts

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
sure the angle B shoot the guard adepts

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:30.780 
sure the angle B shoot the guard adepts
going<00:03:29.470> to<00:03:29.560> put<00:03:29.799> the<00:03:29.920> app<00:03:30.040> you<00:03:30.220> shoot<00:03:30.430> straight

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
going to put the app you shoot straight

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.429 
going to put the app you shoot straight
then<00:03:30.819> depart<00:03:31.450> the<00:03:31.569> post<00:03:31.780> types<00:03:32.019> have<00:03:32.170> to<00:03:32.319> then

00:03:32.429 --> 00:03:32.439 
then depart the post types have to then

then depart the post types have to then
stick<00:03:32.799> the<00:03:32.950> car<00:03:33.159> to<00:03:33.400> that<00:03:33.609> street

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.280

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
yeah so as you can see that the cars are

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:45.780 
yeah so as you can see that the cars are
supposed<00:03:44.890> to<00:03:44.920> look<00:03:45.040> like<00:03:45.099> they're<00:03:45.400> shot<00:03:45.610> for

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
supposed to look like they're shot for

supposed to look like they're shot for
real<00:03:45.909> on<00:03:46.090> location<00:03:46.659> but<00:03:46.959> actually<00:03:47.110> we<00:03:47.530> took

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
real on location but actually we took

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.559 
real on location but actually we took
some<00:03:48.189> to<00:03:48.370> do<00:03:48.519> place<00:03:48.819> and<00:03:49.150> some<00:03:49.269> live<00:03:49.450> action

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:49.569

some to do place and some live action
plates<00:03:50.019> and<00:03:50.489> combine<00:03:51.489> these<00:03:51.640> in<00:03:51.790> a<00:03:51.849> way<00:03:52.030> so<00:03:52.090> you

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390 
plates and combine these in a way so you

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:53.880 
plates and combine these in a way so you
actually<00:03:52.540> believe<00:03:52.930> it's<00:03:53.170> all<00:03:53.319> for<00:03:53.530> real<00:03:53.680> but

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
actually believe it's all for real but

actually believe it's all for real but
actually<00:03:54.189> it's<00:03:54.310> all<00:03:54.489> trickery<00:03:54.909> in<00:03:55.030> the<00:03:55.180> studio

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:56.019 
actually it's all trickery in the studio

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:58.800 
actually it's all trickery in the studio
camera<00:03:56.980> work<00:03:57.159> and<00:03:57.400> 3d<00:03:57.760> work<00:03:58.090> to<00:03:58.299> get<00:03:58.420> make<00:03:58.690> this
