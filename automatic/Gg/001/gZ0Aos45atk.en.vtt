00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:13.480
 my name is not this gift if I have the 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:16.430
 chance to be suspicious system signals 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:19.580
 today s3 has 40 employees 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.950
 we have fruitful results thanks to our 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.989
 different partnerships and at work 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:26.259
 exceptional was done within 

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:26.259
 stanzas 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.570
 the first results we obtained 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:34.120
 these are digital stockings a 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:36.760
 system architecture and all 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.970
 elements necessary for the manufacture of 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.970
 the structure 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.360
 my name is father mona I'm busy 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.780
 chase 3 from the research and 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.760
 development 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.440
 I joined f3 after experiments 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.540
 previous to NASA and the agency 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.489
 European Space 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.170
 the shape of the shuttle is inspired by 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:55.059
 many vehicles to return European 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.110
 and especially the shuttle 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:59.170
 of the European Space Agency 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.520
 airness a lot of work had to be 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.840
 made from inspiration 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.330
 hermes to come to power 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.740
 currently a big job has been 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.229
 undertaken a slow European space 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.729
 hand in hand with the section 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.560
 aerodynamics in order to study and 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:13.030
 simulate the charged thermal loads 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.700
 structural and optimize the 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.690
 trajectory of our ship with 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.330
 help from our partners dassault 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.610
 aviation has done a job of choice 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.890
 selection and comparison of 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.240
 subsystems existing aircraft that 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.540
 could satisfy profit of 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.850
 Assignments 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.649
 it's under systems will be integrated on 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.979
 a primary structure manufacture and 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:35.020
 designed by sonaca our results 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:37.630
 conclusive allowed us today 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.090
 to integrate a new partner 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:43.119
 thales alenia space italy this partner 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.740
 reputed thanks to the pressurized module as 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:46.209
 columbus that are today on the 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.800
 international station 

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:51.160
 this experience will allow us 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:53.649
 to have a pressurized box to 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:56.140
 the evening interior that would replace the 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:58.209
 satellite that would make the 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.509
 microbiology of research in 

00:01:58.209 --> 00:02:00.509
 microgravity 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:34.709
 it takes collaboration with thales 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:36.000
 alenia space italy allows to open the 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.290
 collaboration with the Center for 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.500
 astronauts in cologne 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.810
 these double collaboration brings as3 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.849
 the necessary elements to be able to 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.130
 establish certification potting 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:49.610
 breeding grounds for the 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.610
 manned flight 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.989
 the next steps of the project these are 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:57.400
 the wind tunnel tests in 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:59.200
 wind tunnel will allow us to 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.659
 validate all results calculations 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.000
 that have been made today to validate 

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:06.310
 the trajectory to put into orbit 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.170
 satellites all this know-how and 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.299
 integration new partners are going 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:13.329
 allow us to establish the breeding ground of 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:16.000
 tomorrow for the intercontinental flight to 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:18.730
 high speed this intercontinental flight to 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.980
 high speed is the normal evolution of 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.319
 such as aviation to replace 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.970
 and boats from continent to continent and 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:27.239
 suborbital flights replaces for 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.239
 Aviation
