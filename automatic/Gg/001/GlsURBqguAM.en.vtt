clogged in the gun so you've got to find

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.640 
clogged in the gun so you've got to find
a<00:00:39.850> way<00:00:39.880> of<00:00:40.090> filtering<00:00:40.360> the<00:00:40.870> media<00:00:41.500> and<00:00:43.650> to

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:44.650 
a way of filtering the media and to

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:46.110 
a way of filtering the media and to
reuse<00:00:44.830> it<00:00:45.010> it's<00:00:45.370> I<00:00:45.490> mean<00:00:45.640> it's<00:00:45.760> going<00:00:45.940> through

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.120 
reuse it it's I mean it's going through

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.420 
reuse it it's I mean it's going through
that<00:00:46.210> dick<00:00:46.510> goes<00:00:46.690> through<00:00:46.870> that<00:00:47.010> suck<00:00:48.010> up<00:00:48.160> port

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:48.430 
that dick goes through that suck up port

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:54.390 
that dick goes through that suck up port
at<00:00:48.520> the<00:00:48.610> bottom<00:00:48.910> of<00:00:49.000> the<00:00:49.060> the<00:00:49.980> stick<00:00:52.560> and<00:00:53.560> it

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:54.400 
at the bottom of the the stick and it

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.010 
at the bottom of the the stick and it
tries<00:00:54.610> to<00:00:54.640> recycle<00:00:55.060> the<00:00:55.300> sand<00:00:55.510> is<00:00:55.630> a<00:00:55.660> coaster<00:00:55.990> I

tries to recycle the sand is a coaster I
mean<00:00:56.230> it's<00:00:56.380> it's<00:00:56.680> it<00:00:57.400> works<00:00:57.580> well<00:00:57.910> when<00:00:58.090> it<00:00:58.180> was

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.300 
mean it's it's it works well when it was

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.000 
mean it's it's it works well when it was
working<00:00:58.750> the<00:00:58.870> problem<00:00:59.200> is<00:00:59.290> it's<00:00:59.470> constantly

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.510 
getting clogged so I coming up with a
way<00:01:04.030> of<00:01:04.650> I'm<00:01:05.650> not<00:01:05.830> coming<00:01:06.100> up<00:01:06.159> with<00:01:06.310> it<00:01:06.400> I've

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
way of I'm not coming up with it I've

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.520 
way of I'm not coming up with it I've
read<00:01:06.700> it<00:01:06.820> on<00:01:06.939> the<00:01:07.090> on<00:01:07.330> the<00:01:07.540> internet<00:01:07.900> and<00:01:08.110> I

sure that the media goes through the

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.649 
sure that the media goes through the
window<00:01:25.510> screening<00:01:25.930> and<00:01:26.110> it<00:01:26.860> does<00:01:27.300> it<00:01:28.300> did<00:01:28.510> with

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
bucks you can create a strainer to

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:00.450 
bucks you can create a strainer to
strain<00:01:54.850> to<00:01:55.799> sift<00:01:56.909> your<00:01:57.909> blast<00:01:58.180> media<00:01:59.460> and

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
strain to sift your blast media and

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.310 
strain to sift your blast media and
basically<00:02:00.850> what<00:02:01.119> you<00:02:01.240> do<00:02:01.390> this<00:02:01.900> is<00:02:02.049> a<00:02:02.080> Lowe's

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320 
basically what you do this is a Lowe's

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.080 
basically what you do this is a Lowe's
bucket<00:02:02.710> it<00:02:02.890> just<00:02:03.100> it<00:02:03.340> really<00:02:03.369> doesn't<00:02:03.909> matter

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
bucket it just it really doesn't matter

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.969 
bucket it just it really doesn't matter
because<00:02:04.240> the<00:02:04.810> process<00:02:05.229> is<00:02:05.260> still<00:02:05.619> the<00:02:05.680> same

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
because the process is still the same

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:08.759 
because the process is still the same
and<00:02:06.690> what<00:02:07.690> you<00:02:07.750> end<00:02:07.900> up<00:02:07.990> doing<00:02:08.049> it's<00:02:08.440> pretty

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:08.769

because<00:06:28.870> the<00:06:29.110> screening<00:06:29.560> ends<00:06:29.800> out<00:06:29.919> being

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:31.590 
because the screening ends out being

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:35.820 
because the screening ends out being
almost<00:06:32.910> perfect<00:06:33.910> for<00:06:34.150> the<00:06:34.350> flying<00:06:35.350> farm

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:35.830 
almost perfect for the flying farm

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:39.779 
almost perfect for the flying farm
property<00:06:37.590> and<00:06:38.590> it<00:06:38.979> gets<00:06:39.130> filtered<00:06:39.340> through

00:06:39.779 --> 00:06:39.789 
property and it gets filtered through

00:06:39.789 --> 00:06:42.000 
property and it gets filtered through
but<00:06:40.479> what<00:06:40.660> doesn't<00:06:40.990> get<00:06:41.080> filtered<00:06:41.350> through<00:06:41.800> is

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:42.010 
but what doesn't get filtered through is

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:44.010 
but what doesn't get filtered through is
the<00:06:42.370> stuff<00:06:42.639> that<00:06:42.669> would<00:06:42.940> have<00:06:43.030> clogged<00:06:43.330> the

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:44.020 
the stuff that would have clogged the

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:49.710 
the stuff that would have clogged the
gun<00:06:44.229> and<00:06:45.930> that's<00:06:46.930> what<00:06:47.199> I<00:06:47.229> want<00:06:47.500> out<00:06:48.090> so<00:06:49.090> I<00:06:49.389> mean

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:49.720

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:54.010 
it's a it's a quick and easy process you

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:55.980 
it's a it's a quick and easy process you
know<00:06:54.070> like<00:06:54.970> I<00:06:55.060> say<00:06:55.210> the<00:06:55.330> instructions<00:06:55.840> are<00:06:55.960> on

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:55.990 
know like I say the instructions are on

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:59.810 
know like I say the instructions are on
the<00:06:56.260> internet<00:06:56.650> written<00:06:57.550> I<00:06:58.389> hadn't<00:06:59.199> found<00:06:59.380> any

00:06:59.810 --> 00:06:59.820 
the internet written I hadn't found any

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:02.460 
the internet written I hadn't found any
video<00:07:00.820> on<00:07:00.910> YouTube<00:07:01.389> for<00:07:01.660> it<00:07:01.720> so<00:07:01.870> I<00:07:02.050> thought<00:07:02.289> I'd

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:02.470 
video on YouTube for it so I thought I'd

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:04.800 
video on YouTube for it so I thought I'd
make<00:07:02.500> one
