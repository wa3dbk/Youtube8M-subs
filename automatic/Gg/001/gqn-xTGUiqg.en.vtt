hopefully I can I can impart that to a

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.850 
hopefully I can I can impart that to a
couple<00:02:34.240> of<00:02:34.300> dozen<00:02:34.480> people<00:02:34.990> on<00:02:35.110> the<00:02:35.260> way<00:02:35.380> you

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
couple of dozen people on the way you

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.640 
couple of dozen people on the way you
know<00:02:35.980> that's<00:02:36.220> all<00:02:36.340> I<00:02:36.430> can<00:02:36.490> all<00:02:36.730> feel<00:02:36.910> I<00:02:37.470> saw<00:02:38.470> as

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
know that's all I can all feel I saw as

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.700 
know that's all I can all feel I saw as
far<00:02:38.890> as<00:02:39.040> what<00:02:39.670> we<00:02:39.820> use<00:02:40.120> to<00:02:40.150> compose<00:02:40.720> music<00:02:41.020> in

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:41.710 
far as what we use to compose music in

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:43.980 
far as what we use to compose music in
the<00:02:42.340> kind<00:02:42.550> of<00:02:42.670> digital<00:02:42.880> age<00:02:43.210> of<00:02:43.450> receiving<00:02:43.870> and

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
the kind of digital age of receiving and

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:45.030 
the kind of digital age of receiving and
we<00:02:44.050> have<00:02:44.170> a<00:02:44.200> lot<00:02:44.380> of<00:02:44.410> what<00:02:44.560> they<00:02:44.650> call<00:02:44.800> virtual

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
we have a lot of what they call virtual

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.380 
we have a lot of what they call virtual
instruments<00:02:45.730> and<00:02:45.820> what<00:02:45.910> these<00:02:46.060> virtual

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
instruments and what these virtual

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:47.640 
instruments and what these virtual
instruments<00:02:46.840> are<00:02:46.960> there<00:02:47.140> sampled

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
instruments are there sampled

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.470 
instruments are there sampled
instruments<00:02:48.190> and<00:02:48.310> basically<00:02:48.580> everything

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
instruments and basically everything

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:50.580 
instruments and basically everything
that<00:02:49.510> it<00:02:49.780> took<00:02:49.900> a<00:02:49.960> whole<00:02:50.230> room<00:02:50.470> of

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
that it took a whole room of

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.430 
that it took a whole room of
synthesizers<00:02:51.280> to<00:02:51.430> do<00:02:51.610> say<00:02:52.120> 30<00:02:52.480> years<00:02:52.720> ago<00:02:52.870> we

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
synthesizers to do say 30 years ago we

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.380 
synthesizers to do say 30 years ago we
have<00:02:53.560> now<00:02:53.680> condensed<00:02:54.220> into<00:02:54.430> one<00:02:54.460> computer<00:02:55.180> and

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
have now condensed into one computer and

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.750 
have now condensed into one computer and
we're<00:02:55.540> able<00:02:55.690> to<00:02:55.810> access<00:02:56.170> it<00:02:56.230> all<00:02:56.590> at<00:02:57.310> the<00:02:57.490> equal

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
we're able to access it all at the equal

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.820 
we're able to access it all at the equal
at<00:02:58.000> you<00:02:58.420> know<00:02:58.510> the<00:02:58.690> same<00:02:58.870> speed<00:02:59.260> type<00:02:59.560> thing<00:02:59.800> so

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
at you know the same speed type thing so

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.320 
at you know the same speed type thing so
you<00:02:59.980> don't<00:03:00.130> have<00:03:00.190> to<00:03:00.340> go<00:03:00.760> around<00:03:00.850> plugging

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
you don't have to go around plugging

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.120 
you don't have to go around plugging
things<00:03:01.480> in<00:03:01.660> for<00:03:01.930> 30<00:03:02.110> minutes<00:03:02.350> you<00:03:02.560> could<00:03:02.680> have

that kind of technology is irreplaceable

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.150 
that kind of technology is irreplaceable
for<00:03:28.690> doing<00:03:28.959> business<00:03:29.140> quickly<00:03:29.590> which<00:03:29.920> is<00:03:29.950> what

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
for doing business quickly which is what

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.370 
for doing business quickly which is what
we<00:03:30.280> do<00:03:30.400> it<00:03:30.580> immediate<00:03:30.940> music<00:03:31.060> well<00:03:31.900> this<00:03:32.200> is<00:03:32.350> a

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
we do it immediate music well this is a

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.160 
we do it immediate music well this is a
sound<00:03:32.709> design<00:03:33.070> this<00:03:33.340> is<00:03:33.660> probably<00:03:34.660> not<00:03:34.840> even

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
sound design this is probably not even

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:36.720 
sound design this is probably not even
worth<00:03:35.350> putting<00:03:35.620> in<00:03:35.890> the<00:03:36.010> final<00:03:36.370> cut<00:03:36.520> of<00:03:36.550> the

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
worth putting in the final cut of the

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.520 
worth putting in the final cut of the
movie<00:03:36.880> but<00:03:37.330> it's<00:03:37.930> all<00:03:38.080> a<00:03:38.110> bunch<00:03:38.290> of<00:03:38.350> old

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
movie but it's all a bunch of old

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.050 
movie but it's all a bunch of old
synthesizers<00:03:39.220> which<00:03:39.580> is<00:03:39.730> kind<00:03:39.940> of<00:03:40.000> cool

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
synthesizers which is kind of cool

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.729 
synthesizers which is kind of cool
because<00:03:40.360> a<00:03:40.510> lot<00:03:40.690> of<00:03:40.720> these<00:03:40.900> are<00:03:41.140> extinct

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
because a lot of these are extinct

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:44.070 
because a lot of these are extinct
nowadays<00:03:42.130> but<00:03:42.430> I'm<00:03:42.640> we<00:03:43.570> use<00:03:43.720> them<00:03:43.870> to<00:03:43.959> make

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.080 
nowadays but I'm we use them to make

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.960 
nowadays but I'm we use them to make
just<00:03:44.440> I<00:03:44.650> guess<00:03:44.830> the<00:03:45.250> best<00:03:45.370> way<00:03:45.520> to<00:03:45.580> describe<00:03:45.760> in

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
just I guess the best way to describe in

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:47.850 
just I guess the best way to describe in
simple<00:03:46.300> terms<00:03:46.330> is<00:03:46.600> weird<00:03:46.810> noises<00:03:47.110> that<00:03:47.590> we<00:03:47.709> use

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:47.860 
simple terms is weird noises that we use

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.400 
simple terms is weird noises that we use
a<00:03:47.890> sound<00:03:48.250> design<00:03:48.520> so<00:03:48.700> in<00:03:48.820> you<00:03:48.910> hear<00:03:49.090> in<00:03:50.050> a<00:03:50.170> scary

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
a sound design so in you hear in a scary

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.170 
a sound design so in you hear in a scary
movie<00:03:50.800> someone<00:03:51.280> had<00:03:51.370> to<00:03:51.430> make<00:03:51.670> that<00:03:51.700> at<00:03:52.000> some

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
movie someone had to make that at some

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.510 
movie someone had to make that at some
point<00:03:52.209> and<00:03:52.660> yeah<00:03:52.810> exactly<00:03:53.080> all<00:03:54.010> of<00:03:54.160> us<00:03:54.250> kind<00:03:54.430> of
