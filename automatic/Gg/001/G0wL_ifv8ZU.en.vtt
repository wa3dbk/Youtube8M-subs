00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.820
 hello to all and now i hope you 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.250
 well, we'll meet again 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:24.930
 for a video in mercator but for 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:27.900
 this time the duo made in eni and 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.840
 naked for the occasion I was TV 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.669
 nor in full intel leaves to sacrifice 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.649
 the vita max you can find the 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.320
 staffs in the description at the bottom of the 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:41.600
 video which allowed anyway 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:44.640
 up to 1400 intelligence for 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:47.010
 the nudes trophe since the 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.219
 the mercato technique is based on a 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:53.520
 pm withdrawal we obviously optimize 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:58.079
 their pm features with the apic trophies 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:00.780
 couple is of course a krum at 26% of 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:04.290
 fire to reduce the damage 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:07.140
 to retirees m this duo has obviously been 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.180
 realized after the shift and fixed shift 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.979
 as we had already done a video on 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.560
 the mercator with the number one placement 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.560
 we ended up with the placement 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.229
 number 2 for this duo we did not seek 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.939
 to my changed we know just fit the 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.680
 map configuration and placement 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.570
 mobs 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.790
 I know that the shift shift fixed has 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.829
 makes a lot of ink flow when they 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.430
 have announced 

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:32.119
 personally I think it's good 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:35.490
 because it simply allows 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:37.610
 loser to revive a fight in the 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.159
 same conditions and on the contrary 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:43.500
 improve his strategy and he stuffed 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.170
 other techniques on a same 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.079
 placement without having to die ten thousand 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.640
 times to find this placement the 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:55.439
 proof is that in this case the duo 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:58.469
 mercat was possible after this maj in 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:01.320
 any case to get to the end of our 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:06.390
 mercator we started with focus 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:08.550
 the escogriff the interest of killing 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.129
 the escogriffe first is we're going 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.110
 so keep the rest as mabri 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:15.599
 invoked is with the fire weaknesses 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.660
 normally as soon as it will be invoked one 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:20.240
 can kill between the round of line juice 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.880
 and the game turn of 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:25.220
 naked we obviously keep the cyclo fond 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.080
 for oxen the boss a little reminder 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.610
 on the technique for the rags 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.350
 it will be necessary that the cyclo melt 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.510
 starts his turn twice in the case of 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:35.630
 mercator the first time he will return 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.230
 taken away and to fry and c7 and africa 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.230
 Turkey 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:42.470
 the second time will allow log 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.240
 the state in mercator vulnerability the 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.310
 difficulty is to put them a 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.460
 first time no customer from each other 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.720
 for the continuation by withdrawing 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:52.280
 approximately the same number of smes 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.070
 we can easily reach the 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.560
 put the kak back to each other 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:03:01.580
 besides awkwardness and judgment naked in 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:03.470
 plus the possibility of retirement even though 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.050
 before I advise to put a small 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:11.180
 animated bag especially if ligny can not 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:15.770
 care and of course the spell ran though the 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:18.980
 pm withdrawal do not you lucky the 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:20.860
 mobs will finish at 2 p o one of 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:24.410
 the other and then there they will heal themselves 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:27.530
 they will negate all your 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.940
 efforts here if you have questions 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.620
 do not hesitate to put them in 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.180
 comment and j series to answer it 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.530
 I leave you for the rest of 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.660
 watching but we find ourselves very 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:39.220
 soon and in addition it will be for pvp 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.220
 so I tell you very quickly 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.400
 you 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.250
 m 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:15.000
 his lease on appeal 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:15.000
 so far 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:25.360
 10 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.060
 to all 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:38.370
 not at all 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.370
 m 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:48.970
