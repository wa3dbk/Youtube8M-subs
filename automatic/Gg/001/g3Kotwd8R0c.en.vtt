00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
with time that leather will kind of

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.640

LED component or compartment here so you

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.450 
LED component or compartment here so you
can<00:01:45.840> see<00:01:45.869> you<00:01:46.079> can<00:01:46.140> see<00:01:46.409> right<00:01:46.680> through<00:01:47.220> there

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
can see you can see right through there

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.789 
can see you can see right through there
that<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.970> LED<00:01:48.869> is<00:01:48.960> actually<00:01:49.229> going<00:01:49.350> off<00:01:49.530> as<00:01:49.710> i

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
the other thing that this has is a

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.310 
the other thing that this has is a
magnetic<00:01:55.649> enclosure<00:01:56.329> so<00:01:57.329> when<00:01:57.840> you<00:01:57.930> do<00:01:58.049> close

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
magnetic enclosure so when you do close

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.980 
magnetic enclosure so when you do close
the<00:01:58.469> case<00:01:58.740> it<00:01:59.310> will<00:01:59.490> not<00:01:59.700> open<00:01:59.909> so<00:02:00.360> as<00:02:00.570> i<00:02:00.750> hold

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
the case it will not open so as i hold

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.149 
the case it will not open so as i hold
it<00:02:01.140> this<00:02:01.259> way<00:02:01.439> you'll<00:02:01.649> notice<00:02:01.890> that<00:02:01.920> it<00:02:02.130> has

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
it this way you'll notice that it has

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.600 
it this way you'll notice that it has
not<00:02:02.399> opened<00:02:02.579> because<00:02:02.909> it<00:02:03.180> has<00:02:03.360> a<00:02:03.439> magnetic

not opened because it has a magnetic

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.449 
not opened because it has a magnetic
closure<00:02:05.610> there<00:02:06.450> so<00:02:06.750> when<00:02:07.140> you<00:02:07.229> open<00:02:07.259> it<00:02:07.530> up<00:02:07.649> it

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
closure there so when you open it up it

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:09.990 
closure there so when you open it up it
has<00:02:08.879> a<00:02:08.910> little<00:02:09.060> snap<00:02:09.539> to

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
has a little snap to

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.510 
has a little snap to
it<00:02:10.690> also<00:02:10.899> supports<00:02:12.090> this<00:02:13.090> little<00:02:14.520> connection

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
it also supports this little connection

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.220 
it also supports this little connection
here<00:02:15.880> so<00:02:16.060> that<00:02:16.210> you<00:02:16.360> can<00:02:16.510> actually<00:02:16.690> stand<00:02:17.080> it

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
here so that you can actually stand it

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.520 
here so that you can actually stand it
up<00:02:17.350> we<00:02:18.010> have<00:02:18.220> our<00:02:18.750> openings<00:02:19.750> for<00:02:19.960> our<00:02:20.050> speakers

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
up we have our openings for our speakers

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.070 
up we have our openings for our speakers
and<00:02:20.860> for<00:02:21.340> our<00:02:21.460> camera<00:02:21.940> let's<00:02:22.840> see<00:02:22.960> how<00:02:23.020> it

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
and for our camera let's see how it

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.670 
and for our camera let's see how it
would<00:02:23.200> look<00:02:23.260> in<00:02:23.650> a<00:02:24.190> let's<00:02:25.090> a<00:02:25.210> keyboard<00:02:25.720> mode<00:02:25.960> go

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
would look in a let's a keyboard mode go

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.199 
would look in a let's a keyboard mode go
ahead<00:02:26.920> and<00:02:26.950> face<00:02:27.880> the<00:02:28.030> flat<00:02:28.240> behind<00:02:28.480> that<00:02:28.780> and

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
ahead and face the flat behind that and

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:38.060 
ahead and face the flat behind that and
turn<00:02:31.209> on<00:02:31.360> the<00:02:31.390> Zuni<00:02:35.550> and<00:02:36.720> as<00:02:37.720> you<00:02:37.870> can<00:02:38.020> see

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
turn on the Zuni and as you can see

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.070 
turn on the Zuni and as you can see
again<00:02:39.070> pretty<00:02:39.400> sturdy<00:02:39.700> no<00:02:40.600> problems<00:02:41.020> there

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
again pretty sturdy no problems there

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.270 
again pretty sturdy no problems there
and<00:02:41.380> it<00:02:41.470> gives<00:02:41.740> you<00:02:41.860> a<00:02:41.920> good<00:02:42.070> typing<00:02:42.580> area<00:02:43.180> I

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
and it gives you a good typing area I

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.970 
and it gives you a good typing area I
can<00:02:45.280> also<00:02:45.430> position<00:02:46.180> at<00:02:46.300> this<00:02:46.420> one<00:02:46.770> for<00:02:47.770> movie

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
can also position at this one for movie

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.960 
can also position at this one for movie
viewing<00:02:48.190> again<00:02:49.000> also<00:02:49.570> very<00:02:49.720> sturdy<00:02:50.190> and<00:02:51.190> all<00:02:51.910> I

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
viewing again also very sturdy and all I

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.670 
viewing again also very sturdy and all I
think<00:02:52.330> it's<00:02:52.420> a<00:02:52.480> good<00:02:52.600> case<00:02:52.810> some<00:02:53.350> of<00:02:53.500> you<00:02:53.650> have

past about not being able to plug it in

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.030 
past about not being able to plug it in
what<00:02:58.630> with<00:02:58.870> the<00:02:58.989> case<00:02:59.200> on<00:02:59.440> to<00:02:59.830> charge

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
what with the case on to charge

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.479 
what with the case on to charge
overnight<00:03:00.520> especially<00:03:01.300> since<00:03:02.370> once<00:03:03.370> you

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
overnight especially since once you

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:05.790 
overnight especially since once you
close<00:03:03.730> up<00:03:03.790> those<00:03:04.420> ports<00:03:04.989> are<00:03:05.110> open<00:03:05.140> or

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
close up those ports are open or

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.160 
close up those ports are open or
actually<00:03:06.340> closed<00:03:06.580> I<00:03:06.880> don't<00:03:07.750> see<00:03:07.900> a<00:03:07.930> big

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
actually closed I don't see a big

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.320 
actually closed I don't see a big
problem<00:03:08.590> that<00:03:08.739> I<00:03:08.770> actually<00:03:09.040> as<00:03:09.730> I<00:03:09.850> place<00:03:10.060> my

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
problem that I actually as I place my

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.360 
problem that I actually as I place my
case<00:03:10.810> to<00:03:11.050> charge<00:03:11.320> have<00:03:11.620> no<00:03:11.800> problem<00:03:12.220> keeping

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
case to charge have no problem keeping

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.900 
case to charge have no problem keeping
it<00:03:12.640> open<00:03:12.760> like<00:03:13.030> this<00:03:13.090> I<00:03:13.530> use<00:03:14.530> my<00:03:14.830> my<00:03:15.489> zoom<00:03:15.730> at

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
it open like this I use my my zoom at

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.850 
it open like this I use my my zoom at
night<00:03:16.120> for<00:03:16.360> reading<00:03:16.750> and<00:03:16.870> most<00:03:17.440> times<00:03:17.620> when<00:03:17.799> I

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
night for reading and most times when I

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.680 
night for reading and most times when I
put<00:03:18.100> it<00:03:18.190> back<00:03:18.370> on<00:03:18.400> my<00:03:18.700> nightstand<00:03:19.150> it<00:03:19.390> is<00:03:19.510> open

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
put it back on my nightstand it is open

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.190 
put it back on my nightstand it is open
anyway<00:03:20.110> so<00:03:20.170> having<00:03:20.920> that<00:03:20.950> exposed<00:03:22.049> only<00:03:23.049> when

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
anyway so having that exposed only when

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.229 
anyway so having that exposed only when
its<00:03:23.320> open<00:03:23.440> doesn't<00:03:24.220> present<00:03:24.370> a<00:03:24.730> major

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 
its open doesn't present a major

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:28.530 
its open doesn't present a major
drawback<00:03:26.140> for<00:03:26.590> me<00:03:26.650> the<00:03:27.580> case<00:03:27.790> is<00:03:27.970> very<00:03:28.120> slim

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
drawback for me the case is very slim

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.600 
drawback for me the case is very slim
that<00:03:29.080> was<00:03:29.170> the<00:03:29.260> other<00:03:29.290> thing<00:03:29.440> that<00:03:29.620> he<00:03:30.489> had

that was the other thing that he had

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.030 
that was the other thing that he had
mentioned<00:03:31.060> and<00:03:31.180> said<00:03:32.049> that<00:03:32.200> he<00:03:32.500> had<00:03:32.590> done<00:03:32.769> some

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
mentioned and said that he had done some

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.949 
mentioned and said that he had done some
changes<00:03:33.670> or<00:03:33.790> modifications<00:03:33.820> to<00:03:34.630> make<00:03:34.780> it

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
changes or modifications to make it

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:37.050 
changes or modifications to make it
slimmer<00:03:35.320> tighter<00:03:35.739> fit<00:03:36.070> I<00:03:36.250> can<00:03:36.580> tell<00:03:36.850> you<00:03:36.940> all

in all it's a great case especially for
for<00:03:39.370> the<00:03:39.430> volume<00:03:39.640> there<00:03:40.120> are<00:03:40.180> not<00:03:40.269> many<00:03:40.450> good

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
for the volume there are not many good

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.900 
for the volume there are not many good
cases<00:03:41.140> out<00:03:41.290> there<00:03:41.320> for<00:03:41.650> the<00:03:41.769> zoom<00:03:41.980> yet<00:03:42.220> so<00:03:42.610> if

cases out there for the zoom yet so if

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.490 
cases out there for the zoom yet so if
you<00:03:43.090> are<00:03:43.239> interested<00:03:43.269> I'd<00:03:43.870> consider<00:03:44.260> this
