00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 hello to all it is 17h 5 look at your 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.130
 traffic conditions are good 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.839
 everywhere and we will not complain 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.099
 on the eve of the weekend look what 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.780
 it gives us without the map of France 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.920
 overall we have a few people in 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.420
 outskirts of big cities but that's 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.590
 is not abnormal we will come back when 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.880
 even earlier I wanted to 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.020
 contrast tell you right away about 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.960
 this disturbance that we have in 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.160
 the southwest on the a63 to bidart en 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.570
 direction of Spain in fact since 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.090
 13:30 to tell you everything about weight 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.410
 heavy are hilly 4 km south u of 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.609
 pech of the negress in the direction of 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.210
 Spain access cut to the 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.310
 traffic 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.929
 so we have 10 km of traffic jams at the back 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.730
 so what he is obliged you are 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.690
 obliged if you go on this axis 1 of 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.770
 leave the highway at the level of 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.880
 the exchanger number four sites at 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.620
 level of biarritz we advise you 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.030
 obviously to avoid the problems of 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.350
 leave the highway well before that is 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.370
 to say at bayonne is 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.600
 exchanger number 5 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.890
 as for the heavy weight they are stored 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.969
 on the spot and luckily we have a 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.340
 camera in the area what you 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.600
 lets see a little bit of 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.070
 disruption as is the time 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.020
 to evacuate all these heavyweights it's okay 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.250
 take a lot of time so that's 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.989
 maybe a sector to avoid yet 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.850
 for several hours but that's it 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.770
 will obviously come back other sectors that 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.780
 may be a problem for you 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.489
 bierne bierne south of dunkirk 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.870
 direction dunkerque we are reported 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.189
 two vehicles on the roof so that's 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.600
 the same time to evacuate it will take 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.650
 a little while and seeing we come 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.760
 at the rush hour of the day we 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.970
 risk of having big disturbances 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.189
 here another rather important disturbance 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.920
 it's on the ring road 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.689
 south of Toulouse it is to the young ladies in 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.920
 direction of the village of the ngo an accident 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.930
 we are pointed out with the curiosity effect 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.670
 listen to it cork in both directions 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.990
 in lyon is very difficult 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.400
 no accidents but work areas 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.659
 very disturbing commission direction 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.310
 no money and then if you have to 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.350
 to cross the tunnel under fourviÃ¨re in 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.509
 from the south is well there count 19 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.110
 minutes from saint fons and then 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.210
 in Ile de France 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.710
 we reached 170 km of disturbances 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.570
 it rolls very badly you see on the 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.770
 major bypass routes especially on 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.729
 the inner ring road this 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.270
 we have an accident 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.460
 clignancourt 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.979
 and then here too at small clamart 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.180
 national road nodes a86 118 and 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.590
 then if you were going to leave for the 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.060
 Normandy was going to have to leave a little 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.560
 earlier because we already have 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.090
 disturbances here when arriving on mantes 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.920
 the pretty one and you only lose five 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.329
 little minutes in the caps and 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.280
 then you know that your vehicle has to 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:02.250
 have regular health exams 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.350
 to check the condition of vital organs 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.530
 it's called the technical control there is 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.729
 125 checkpoints in total but 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.039
 to talk about serious things must 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.510
 know that in one in five accidents the 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.830
 lack of vehicle maintenance is a 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.750
 aggravating factor so it takes you 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.220
 say that for a new vehicle you 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.860
 must perform this check 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.600
 six months before the birthday of the four 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.650
 years later it will be every two years and 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.819
 no one will send you a 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.380
 convocation must you do it 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.550
 you are here I wish you a 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.290
 very good day we end up at 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.530
 18h50 so at any time I count 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.530
 on you
