00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 jake on youtube yesterday like 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.020
 they agree how they realized it was with 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.900
 the day the chemical battery goes out was 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.519
 that of all the wiring for everything and for 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.610
 what I 'm going to teach him to the following 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.929
 what's going to be good this is going to see what 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.460
 next thing you're going to do is make a 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.080
 starts we can involve people with 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.120
 way that I remove that mother from to 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.210
 side 

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:26.690
 the majority that brought the because they are not 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:29.120
 they knew or they did not know this way it was from a 

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:30.890
 TV cabinet and as we have already 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.300
 disrupted and is already spoiling 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.060
 this way because I said what is going to take advantage 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.620
 how is it while you just how to take advantage 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.239
 ibarra until approaching it to do it 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.970
 become a rat for 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:42.440
 amplifiers and well then when 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.059
 I still have more progress right now are 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.770
 taking measures and this one that cut it and 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:48.140
 everything is back and how they can see and 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:51.110
 cut the wooden step the measure that 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.210
 it was 42 inches and since exactly that 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.890
 aligned with the batteries or where 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.989
 It ends it ends in a cut 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.910
 little bit less to be sure and 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.769
 Now you just need to put this one to see 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.390
 with the next step and since we saw that 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:04.010
 if this piece of wood fits in our 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.840
 trunk exist the measure now what are we going 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.700
 do is we're going to upholster and we will 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.850
 happen with that with these products that 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.850
 We got someone on friends 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.930
 good guy well here is the glue 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.310
 777 and I think this is one of the 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.159
 stronger adhesives than there are right now 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.350
 the 777 because it 's no more was the 77 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:24.530
 here is going to come out this little something like that and 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.690
 here we have two different options the 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.230
 black or gray and like the black drawer 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:28.910
 pigtail 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:31.580
 the black raca if he is screaming at 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:33.260
 save for then we remove them grab 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.030
 this black and we are going to put them in our 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.780
 drawer and taking advantage now that we are 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.060
 here 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.040
 before installing the carpet is that it is 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.540
 something quick as you can see this is not 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.060
 the cancer in videos is shiny the 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.440
 carpet I like that similar to the one 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.440
 has the drawer itself express in short 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.970
 to the back is not like a 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.610
 regular carpet or if it has as 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.440
 a back part of latex that makes 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.900
 It acquires well to all surfaces 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.970
 and it is an easy installation 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.380
 supposedly to an easy installation and 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.270
 I put normal means you study 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.890
 part that also thin is going to look 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.930
 as if it does not bring anything then for one more 3a 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.090
 that little layer of carpet so that it 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.190
 see well and what we want here nobody 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.990
 nothing difficult nothing everything that is 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.630
 super easy and for one person if you have to 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.670
 cut the measure install it and here as 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.520
 can see is already put or rather 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.140
 It is cut to size but more needed 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.570
 right now to paste it with more density 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.150
 because here you do not have to cut them one more 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.709
 because I want more and they know how to double and 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.170
 that they talked about to endure rather 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:32.190
 here and then you do not occupy more to the bottom 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.840
 because apart this part of back does not 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.250
 know is the back we 're not going 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.640
 to flip and the black part is going to be 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.640
 in front 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.290
 Y 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:32.550
 Y 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:42.030
 and so fast and easy is how you make a 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.030
 Pizza 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.629
 The racc amplifiers 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.530
 water medicines because where they sell 

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:49.870
 the spray 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.430
 this material to cover those that 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.830
 different many colors winds by 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.629
 any interior or color interest 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.670
 that you have and I put one because there will be 

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:59.500
 put it inside the car and just miss 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.540
 cut him these edges but he goes up to that 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.159
 comes after having eta no more I want 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.470
 Make sure everything is fine to be 

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:07.180
 ready to start stuffing things and 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.010
 As you can see I have everything ready as 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.440
 is going to put as he has said of occupy 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.360
 a distributor or rather a fuse 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.489
 here you have a battery output 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.049
 if it is what to do is the fuse for this 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:19.180
 amplifier that will be for the bass 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:20.590
 connect them rc to know if they arrived if 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.199
 come we are sure that if he wins 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.340
 I would compare it as I said its temporary 

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:26.139
 that I'm sure I'm going to change their 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.639
 amplifiers and is that I do not begin to 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:29.289
 say why they do not match a classic 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:31.330
 to the biggest because it makes it very 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:33.190
 boy for the system that I have 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.470
 but as I said this will come later 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.910
 this is temporary 2 by while normal 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:39.280
 than to teach so in the room something more 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:43.210
 or less longer than what I had 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:45.569
 with the batteries and everything installed and 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.910
 which side I also have here 

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:48.700
 bill 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:51.260
 one of the fuses and a distributor 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:54.650
 here is that dealer for you to see and 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:56.840
 that is going to come here and put 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.580
 power or current voice amplifiers 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.040
 and as you can see there is at the start 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:04.460
 inside but perfectly the drawer here 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:07.510
 back and all our space and then if 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:11.030
 the system goes as I said getting and 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:12.830
 arming little by little the court a 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:14.870
 negative around here will go from here to 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:19.670
 this negative post up to here the 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:22.280
 amplifier this comes positive this to 

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:27.610
 this possible to this distributor to the 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:27.610
 amplifier and this post you have here 

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:34.820
 and after this positive to this possible to 

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:37.970
 this amplifier and here is the cable 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:41.060
 of the negative that goes to this post this 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:43.910
 theory will lead everyone will have 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:46.370
 your set of rs as is obvious this to 

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:48.740
 this here and what a lot of people 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:50.480
 front machine is how to make the 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:52.700
 two communicated for the same time and not 

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:55.730
 more good occupation if you want the remote 

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:57.680
 and then you put this cable that green this one 

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:59.180
 send the same hole from the remote to this 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.800
 Remote hole worsted for this 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:03.020
 side and it's going to be that the two engines 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.510
 At the same time, others 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:06.320
 products but send us this velcro 

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:08.690
 supposedly will help us to be able to 

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:11.030
 we can put amplifiers guys or 

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:13.010
 that the thing we can stick to it 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:14.720
 carpet that they sent us and I'll leave you 

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:16.430
 Let's see if this is better 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.690
 solution as they say is temporary 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:20.180
 these solutions are better 

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:22.400
 screw everything where it goes and some 

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:24.320
 we can scale it to say here is the 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:26.390
 final result is already connected all 

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:28.670
 the good amplifiers the two are 

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:30.729
 no more editors is edited all the 

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:34.599
 land 

00:06:30.729 --> 00:06:36.249
 that he felt here to this post and of 

00:06:34.599 --> 00:06:38.650
 this post comes to you that cable that 

00:06:36.249 --> 00:06:40.380
 turns into this mother who distributes 

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:45.650
 the power 

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:45.650
 from caliber 0 to caliber 410 

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:50.470
 here is the remote that enters this and 

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:51.370
 then you put in the same remote one that 

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:54.600
 does that also will make 

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:58.660
 pledge is here the bass is connected 

00:06:54.600 --> 00:07:01.000
 connected to the earth and the current in 

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:02.350
 the age beings in this field in arganda 

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.669
 does not close reality if they do not have 

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:05.560
 one doubt this horn is because it is not 

00:07:03.669 --> 00:07:08.490
 I have installed the voice of that 

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:08.490
 ease after 

00:07:09.139 --> 00:07:12.379
 and because everyone has to have a 

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:14.330
 dealer that is the distributor of 

00:07:12.379 --> 00:07:18.500
 this side or rather the fuse of this 

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:21.110
 side and here is the earth 

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:23.840
 and this may be the final product here 

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:26.240
 there are the batteries and everything and they will come 

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:29.180
 the following voice horns or rather 

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:32.180
 what follows comes to heal us but I know 

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:35.450
 well how is installed the boot the 

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:36.820
 boat box batteries wired all 

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:39.160
 good clean 

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:42.060
 so I think he felt that something but it's 

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:42.060
 everything new in possibility
