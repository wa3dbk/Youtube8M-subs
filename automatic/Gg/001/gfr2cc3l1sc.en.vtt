00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
reasons for getting this camera over a

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.340 
reasons for getting this camera over a
more<00:00:59.760> popular<00:01:00.210> one<00:01:00.390> such<00:01:01.079> as<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.500> gopro

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
more popular one such as the gopro

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:09.260 
more popular one such as the gopro
firstly<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.439> gopro<00:01:04.860> wouldn't<00:01:05.339> really<00:01:08.000> fit<00:01:09.000> on

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
firstly the gopro wouldn't really fit on

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.160 
firstly the gopro wouldn't really fit on
the<00:01:09.390> outside<00:01:09.869> of<00:01:09.900> my<00:01:10.140> helmet<00:01:10.710> as<00:01:12.170> conveniently

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
the outside of my helmet as conveniently

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.580 
the outside of my helmet as conveniently
and<00:01:13.530> perhaps<00:01:14.400> is<00:01:14.700> streamlined<00:01:15.600> lee<00:01:15.990> if<00:01:16.320> that's

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
and perhaps is streamlined lee if that's

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.710 
and perhaps is streamlined lee if that's
a<00:01:16.650> word<00:01:16.799> it<00:01:16.979> is<00:01:17.100> now<00:01:17.310> as<00:01:17.930> this<00:01:18.930> camera<00:01:20.720> this

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
a word it is now as this camera this

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.179 
a word it is now as this camera this
camera<00:01:21.780> also<00:01:22.200> has<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:24.590> ability<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:25.619> rotate

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
camera also has the ability to rotate

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.880 
camera also has the ability to rotate
the<00:01:26.640> lens<00:01:26.880> through<00:01:27.390> 300<00:01:28.049> degrees<00:01:28.320> so<00:01:28.590> whatever

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
the lens through 300 degrees so whatever

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.760 
the lens through 300 degrees so whatever
orientation<00:01:29.670> you<00:01:29.790> have<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.270> camera<00:01:30.840> in<00:01:31.049> the

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
orientation you have the camera in the

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.190 
orientation you have the camera in the
lens<00:01:32.040> can<00:01:32.340> always<00:01:32.670> be<00:01:33.509> pointing<00:01:33.930> in<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.110> right

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
lens can always be pointing in the right

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.170 
lens can always be pointing in the right
direction<00:01:34.259> for<00:01:35.750> the<00:01:36.750> proper<00:01:37.079> look<00:01:38.040> I<00:01:38.369> like

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
direction for the proper look I like

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.090 
direction for the proper look I like
that<00:01:39.390> because<00:01:40.110> even<00:01:40.470> though<00:01:40.560> this<00:01:40.710> is<00:01:40.860> on<00:01:40.979> the

that because even though this is on the

that because even though this is on the
helmet<00:01:41.400> I've<00:01:41.579> had<00:01:41.700> to<00:01:41.820> rotate<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.420> lens<00:01:42.600> just

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750

helmet I've had to rotate the lens just
a<00:01:42.990> few<00:01:43.200> degrees<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.770> get<00:01:43.920> vertical<00:01:44.610> vertical

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:51.549 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:54.459 

what<00:01:52.549> else<00:01:52.729> do<00:01:53.119> I<00:01:53.149> like<00:01:53.539> about<00:01:53.719> the<00:01:53.990> camera<00:01:54.320> I

what else do I like about the camera I

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:57.580 
what else do I like about the camera I
like<00:01:54.530> the<00:01:55.270> fact<00:01:56.270> you<00:01:56.450> can<00:01:56.600> stick<00:01:56.899> an<00:01:57.020> external

it's waterproof down to 3 meters I like
that<00:02:43.420> however<00:02:44.440> I'm<00:02:45.440> probably<00:02:45.709> not<00:02:45.860> going<00:02:46.010> to

00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:46.099 
that however I'm probably not going to

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:47.440 
that however I'm probably not going to
be<00:02:46.190> using<00:02:46.400> that<00:02:46.610> function<00:02:47.000> but<00:02:47.090> that<00:02:47.180> doesn't

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
be using that function but that doesn't

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:53.140 
be using that function but that doesn't
matter

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.569 

what<00:02:53.780> else<00:02:54.019> to<00:02:54.140> do<00:02:54.290> I<00:02:54.319> like<00:02:54.590> about<00:02:54.620> it<00:02:54.920> the<00:02:55.069> LCD

so<00:02:55.819> you<00:02:55.879> can<00:02:56.090> see<00:02:56.329> what<00:02:56.480> you're<00:02:56.599> looking<00:02:56.870> at

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
so you can see what you're looking at

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:59.110 
so you can see what you're looking at
when<00:02:57.290> you<00:02:57.980> see<00:02:58.129> the<00:02:58.310> camera<00:02:58.549> up<00:02:58.670> you<00:02:58.879> can<00:02:59.000> also

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
when you see the camera up you can also

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:05.020 
when you see the camera up you can also
rig<00:02:59.450> it<00:02:59.569> up<00:02:59.659> with<00:02:59.930> a<00:03:01.209> an<00:03:02.209> ipad<00:03:02.629> app<00:03:04.030> ultimately

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
rig it up with a an ipad app ultimately

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.830 
rig it up with a an ipad app ultimately
they'll<00:03:05.239> have<00:03:05.390> it<00:03:05.420> for<00:03:05.599> the<00:03:05.689> android<00:03:05.989> phones

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
they'll have it for the android phones

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.080 
they'll have it for the android phones
whereby<00:03:08.840> you<00:03:08.989> can<00:03:09.769> see<00:03:10.250> what<00:03:10.549> you're<00:03:10.730> looking

um<00:03:29.989> so<00:03:30.980> I'm<00:03:31.250> going<00:03:31.430> to<00:03:31.489> see<00:03:31.670> how<00:03:31.790> it<00:03:31.849> goes<00:03:32.060> i

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:32.389 
um so I'm going to see how it goes i

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:34.479 
um so I'm going to see how it goes i
have<00:03:32.690> no<00:03:32.900> idea<00:03:33.139> how<00:03:33.319> it's<00:03:33.530> going<00:03:33.769> to<00:03:33.889> sound<00:03:34.129> I'm

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
have no idea how it's going to sound I'm

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:37.539 
have no idea how it's going to sound I'm
just<00:03:34.760> wanting<00:03:35.000> to<00:03:35.239> try<00:03:35.569> and<00:03:35.720> keep<00:03:35.900> the<00:03:36.549> ambient

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:37.549 
just wanting to try and keep the ambient

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:39.520 
just wanting to try and keep the ambient
noise<00:03:38.060> down<00:03:38.420> a<00:03:38.450> little<00:03:38.629> bit<00:03:38.810> the<00:03:39.139> wind<00:03:39.319> noise

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
noise down a little bit the wind noise

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.099 
noise down a little bit the wind noise
etc<00:03:39.769> because<00:03:40.220> my<00:03:40.519> aero<00:03:41.030> helmet<00:03:41.420> is<00:03:41.780> a<00:03:41.810> fairly

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:42.109 
etc because my aero helmet is a fairly

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:44.589 
etc because my aero helmet is a fairly
loud<00:03:42.489> helmet<00:03:43.489> if<00:03:44.000> you<00:03:44.120> can<00:03:44.239> have<00:03:44.389> a<00:03:44.420> loud

the only disadvantage to having the

the only disadvantage to having the

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:20.919 
the side of my helmet I can't tell if if

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
it falls off or not I guess the only way

it falls off or not I guess the only way

that I could tell if it's fallen off is

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.210 
that I could tell if it's fallen off is
that<00:04:28.990> the<00:04:29.110> microphone<00:04:29.590> gets<00:04:29.800> ripped<00:04:30.010> out<00:04:30.160> of

the helmet look at the waist I know I
just<00:04:35.770> I<00:04:36.190> could<00:04:36.729> see<00:04:36.850> myself<00:04:37.030> in<00:04:37.330> my<00:04:37.450> reflection

just I could see myself in my reflection
I<00:04:38.050> even<00:04:38.590> saw<00:04:38.770> the<00:04:38.830> red<00:04:39.070> light<00:04:39.280> flashing

the purists will probably say ah but the
audio<00:04:52.560> quality<00:04:52.770> is<00:04:53.190> better<00:04:53.400> on<00:04:53.670> the<00:04:53.760> GoPro<00:04:53.940> and

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
audio quality is better on the GoPro and

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.660 
audio quality is better on the GoPro and
the<00:04:54.560> bit<00:04:55.560> rate<00:04:55.770> is<00:04:55.980> higher<00:04:56.220> and<00:04:56.580> the

like this camera for the reasons that I

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.600 
like this camera for the reasons that I

said nothing wrong with the GoPro or the
