went ahead and used a sample jar size of
her<00:00:18.300> paint<00:00:18.570> it<00:00:18.840> cost<00:00:19.170> me<00:00:19.410> under<00:00:19.710> $9<00:00:20.340> and<00:00:20.730> it's

Valspar paint crystals this is the first
time<00:00:32.160> I've<00:00:32.309> used<00:00:32.340> it<00:00:32.790> it<00:00:32.880> comes<00:00:33.180> in<00:00:33.450> this

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
little bag and actually lasts a pretty

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.330 
little bag and actually lasts a pretty
long<00:00:36.210> time<00:00:36.450> you<00:00:37.140> just<00:00:37.320> go<00:00:37.500> ahead<00:00:37.649> and<00:00:37.829> you<00:00:38.129> add

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
long time you just go ahead and you add

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.209 
long time you just go ahead and you add
it<00:00:38.579> to<00:00:38.610> your<00:00:38.790> paint<00:00:39.149> it's<00:00:39.480> really<00:00:39.930> that<00:00:40.079> simple

00:00:40.209 --> 00:00:40.219 
it to your paint it's really that simple

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:43.040 
it to your paint it's really that simple
now<00:00:41.219> I<00:00:41.250> started<00:00:41.820> off<00:00:41.969> with<00:00:42.210> just<00:00:42.420> a<00:00:42.570> little<00:00:42.870> bit

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
now I started off with just a little bit

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.910 
now I started off with just a little bit
and<00:00:43.489> I<00:00:44.489> then<00:00:45.270> thought<00:00:45.660> hey<00:00:46.050> how<00:00:46.469> do<00:00:46.530> I<00:00:46.649> add<00:00:46.890> a

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
and I then thought hey how do I add a

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.830 
and I then thought hey how do I add a
little<00:00:47.190> bit<00:00:47.370> more<00:00:47.489> because<00:00:48.149> I<00:00:48.180> like<00:00:48.600> the

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
little bit more because I like the

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.510 
little bit more because I like the
shimmer<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:49.620> then<00:00:49.980> you're<00:00:50.100> just<00:00:50.219> going<00:00:50.430> to

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
shimmer and then you're just going to

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.520 
shimmer and then you're just going to
mix<00:00:50.879> it<00:00:51.030> in<00:00:51.149> your<00:00:51.329> sample<00:00:51.719> jar<00:00:51.899> now<00:00:52.289> if<00:00:52.410> you're

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
mix it in your sample jar now if you're

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.720 
mix it in your sample jar now if you're
going<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:52.710> do<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:52.829> lot<00:00:53.100> of<00:00:53.129> paint<00:00:53.430> you're<00:00:53.579> going

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
going to do a lot of paint you're going

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.220 
going to do a lot of paint you're going
to<00:00:53.789> want<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:53.969> add<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.149> lot<00:00:54.390> more<00:00:54.420> crystals<00:00:55.020> it

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
to want to add a lot more crystals it

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.010 
to want to add a lot more crystals it
just<00:00:55.410> really<00:00:55.680> depends<00:00:56.010> on<00:00:56.250> what<00:00:56.760> you<00:00:57.030> want<00:00:57.329> so

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
just really depends on what you want so

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.950 
just really depends on what you want so
I<00:00:58.190> mixed<00:00:59.190> it<00:00:59.309> up<00:00:59.430> and<00:00:59.699> felt<00:01:00.449> like<00:01:00.690> there<00:01:00.930> just

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
I mixed it up and felt like there just

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.290 
I mixed it up and felt like there just
wasn't<00:01:01.710> enough<00:01:02.129> in<00:01:02.340> it<00:01:02.460> you<00:01:02.550> can<00:01:02.699> see<00:01:02.879> this<00:01:03.059> is

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
wasn't enough in it you can see this is

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.320 
wasn't enough in it you can see this is
not<00:01:03.899> really<00:01:04.470> shimmery<00:01:04.799> not<00:01:05.220> really<00:01:05.549> shiny<00:01:05.880> so

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
not really shimmery not really shiny so

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.859 
not really shimmery not really shiny so
I<00:01:06.360> added<00:01:06.869> a<00:01:07.380> lot<00:01:07.680> more<00:01:08.270> now<00:01:09.270> you<00:01:09.360> don't<00:01:09.630> have<00:01:09.750> to

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
I added a lot more now you don't have to

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.810 
I added a lot more now you don't have to
do<00:01:09.990> this<00:01:10.170> it's<00:01:10.409> really<00:01:10.470> up<00:01:10.799> to<00:01:11.010> you<00:01:11.130> but<00:01:11.340> I<00:01:11.460> feel

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
do this it's really up to you but I feel

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.240 
do this it's really up to you but I feel
like<00:01:12.030> adding<00:01:12.479> more<00:01:12.720> you<00:01:13.470> can<00:01:13.680> really<00:01:13.920> tell

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
like adding more you can really tell

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.039 
like adding more you can really tell
that<00:01:14.280> there<00:01:14.640> is<00:01:14.790> some<00:01:15.000> shimmer<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.540> shine<00:01:15.780> to

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
that there is some shimmer and shine to

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.200 
that there is some shimmer and shine to
it<00:01:16.080> now<00:01:16.920> you're<00:01:17.100> just<00:01:17.369> going<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.670> paint<00:01:18.000> this

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
it now you're just going to paint this

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.030 
it now you're just going to paint this
like<00:01:18.479> you<00:01:18.659> would<00:01:18.780> paint<00:01:19.049> anything<00:01:19.500> else<00:01:19.710> with

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
like you would paint anything else with

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.460 
like you would paint anything else with
Cece<00:01:20.549> just<00:01:20.580> make<00:01:21.000> sure<00:01:21.210> your<00:01:21.360> items<00:01:21.689> clean<00:01:22.140> and

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
Cece just make sure your items clean and

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.800 
Cece just make sure your items clean and
with<00:01:22.979> one<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.340> two<00:01:23.369> coats<00:01:23.759> you<00:01:24.000> are<00:01:24.150> done<00:01:24.390> it<00:01:24.630> is

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
with one to two coats you are done it is

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:25.880 
with one to two coats you are done it is
that<00:01:25.170> easy

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
that easy

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.010 
that easy
now<00:01:26.400> you<00:01:26.460> can't<00:01:26.729> tell<00:01:27.000> in<00:01:27.180> these<00:01:27.270> pictures<00:01:27.720> but

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
now you can't tell in these pictures but

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.390 
now you can't tell in these pictures but
when<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.320> light<00:01:28.560> hit<00:01:28.920> it<00:01:28.950> it<00:01:29.220> would<00:01:29.369> just

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
when the light hit it it would just

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.730 
when the light hit it it would just
shimmer<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.150> shine<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.810> look<00:01:30.990> so<00:01:31.290> pretty<00:01:31.590> and

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
shimmer and shine and look so pretty and

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.429 
shimmer and shine and look so pretty and
I<00:01:32.040> really<00:01:32.549> really<00:01:32.759> like<00:01:32.939> it<00:01:33.150> I<00:01:33.329> will<00:01:33.780> tell<00:01:34.229> you

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
I really really like it I will tell you

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.319 
I really really like it I will tell you
that<00:01:34.470> it<00:01:34.770> did<00:01:35.100> take<00:01:35.430> a<00:01:35.460> little<00:01:35.729> bit<00:01:35.880> more<00:01:35.939> to

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
that it did take a little bit more to

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.390 
that it did take a little bit more to
de-stress<00:01:36.509> than<00:01:37.020> normal<00:01:37.380> but<00:01:37.770> I<00:01:37.829> think<00:01:38.189> that's

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
de-stress than normal but I think that's

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.399 
de-stress than normal but I think that's
because<00:01:38.729> we<00:01:38.759> added<00:01:39.090> those<00:01:39.420> paint<00:01:39.750> crystals<00:01:40.259> in

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
because we added those paint crystals in

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.170 
because we added those paint crystals in
it<00:01:40.500> but<00:01:40.950> it<00:01:41.070> still<00:01:41.280> turned<00:01:41.549> out<00:01:41.700> great<00:01:42.000> and

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
it but it still turned out great and

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.270 
it but it still turned out great and
it's<00:01:42.329> still<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:42.659> lot<00:01:42.899> of<00:01:42.930> fun<00:01:43.229> now<00:01:43.590> this<00:01:43.799> is<00:01:43.950> done

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
it's still a lot of fun now this is done

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.039 
it's still a lot of fun now this is done
without<00:01:44.490> waxing<00:01:45.299> I<00:01:45.420> thought<00:01:45.630> I<00:01:45.659> would<00:01:45.869> add<00:01:46.020> a

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049
