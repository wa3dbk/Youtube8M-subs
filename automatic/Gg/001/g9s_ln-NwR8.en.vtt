 the materials that we will use as 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.610
 following 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.790
 a moisturizer of our 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.310
 preference which will be the basis 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:00.190
 fundamental for this mixture a powder 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:02.380
 compact that is the color of your skin to 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.150
 what are you using right now 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.550
 depending on your skin tone if 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.860
 you pose is clear total 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.720
 you need a compact town depending 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.210
 of the color you want the mixture 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.430
 result we will also use a little 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.560
 of some foundation you have 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.420
 that is in a liquid texture 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.010
 we will also apply a little bit of 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.470
 corrector 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.630
 for those professions a few loose powders 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.700
 of our preference on this occasion 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.310
 I am using translucent powders 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.890
 since they do not provide any kind of 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.810
 extra color to the mix and it will make me the 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.210
 color exactly as I want it 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:40.480
 and last and not least something 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:44.500
 very very essential in these famous creams 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:46.660
 of color is a sunscreen that 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.580
 be very healthy or that we want to 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:51.090
 implement now onwards 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.590
 I'm using one with factor 30 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.990
 production and well once it has 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.210
 all we have left is to make the 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.100
 mix and then they will be left with the step 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.770
 step and in the passat passat consist 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.870
 so we take a container where we are going to 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:08.380
 proceed to apply our mixture in 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:10.410
 we incorporate the compact powder that 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:14.920
 let's use below 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:16.760
 we will apply a little in what is our 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.540
 translucent powder 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.400
 we want some of our corrector what 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:26.480

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:28.489
 a touch of animal concealer back like that 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.579
 Now that we want some of our 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:34.549
 foundation only and / or and by 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:36.290
 the last of our sunscreen does not 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:38.930
