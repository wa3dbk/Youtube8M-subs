00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.400
 single to go to cash prize 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.769
 it was willis with a certain 42nd 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.530
 place while nothing to do for the chip 

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:49.220
 leader of the red opening day e 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.320
 black that closed in 21st position 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:56.210
 playout with first coin of 50 thousand e 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.440
 chip count commanded by the 19 patatone e 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.210
 64 let's go and see all the 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.820
 eliminations one by one 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.009
 of this final table we start from 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.520
 hand at number 24 a final table that is 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:11.399
 left in a very balanced way e 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:13.789
 where the creative who started in sixth 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:16.950
 position of the circle if I'm not mistaken 

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:19.380
 It will be just the first to go in fact 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.570
 it shortens in the first twenty-four 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.530
 hands play and then in war of blinds but from 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:28.319
 all with 10 6 but anti rex 87 looks a 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.259
 bit kitsch and anti reg 

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:32.729
 won the sunday very little special 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.590
 some time ago I read I also have them 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.289
 met a poker tour of 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.530
 sanremo and today we also have one 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:42.690
 surprise but in the meantime I won't let you know 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.640
 here it is, the creative is eliminated 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:52.289
 in a position just over 3,000 euros 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:59.459
 for him and it continues in eight darkness 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:02:04.319
 30,000 and 60,000 all fold patatone 

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:06.690
 from button relaunches 132.000 and david tnt 

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:08.190
 takes the opportunity to push everything is 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:12.480
 remained very short and from the small blind 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:15.780
 ace two is more than good to deal with 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.540
 a chipleader opening by button 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.610
 which in fact had opened with a 10 3 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.470
 however ahi ahi ahi finds immediately the 10 to 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:26.310
 flop patatone so only i 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:30.069
 three aces for david no ace I remove etÃ² 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:32.730
 and even makes double patatone 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:37.629
 and David leaves us in eighth place 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:40.329
 4,800 euros for him and then a hand arrives 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:43.840
 super interesting in fact we will have here a 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:47.769
 double player out that number 57 this morning 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:50.019
 let's see how it was done on floors 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:52.540
 throws everything in it has remained very short 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:57.629
 with 363 thousand there is also the all in di 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:03:01.060
 cement and patatone ago kolko 6 and 2 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:02.980
 let's see some of the aces take out a 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.739
 affair but the woman for floors arrives 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:08.859
 watch out for 6 for patatone 3 then 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:12.340
 all 42 are for patatone and ho 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:13.329
 get a 4 scale and two eliminated in 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.449
 one shot 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:20.019
 seventh position for tremendous 6,300 

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:25.329
 euro and sixth position for floors that 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:28.989
 he takes it home at 7800 and here we are 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:30.939
 another decisive blow but not number 65 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:33.310
 so very few have passed since 

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:36.840
 the previous one was 57 either 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:40.329
 ten hands and already another olin 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:42.900
 anti reggae puts pressure and holds the 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:45.430
 time decides to do with two cards 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:53.109
 presumably from an outbreak but now it was 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:55.810
 he too short, all regular, not 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:59.699
 nothing goes down then k high card 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:02.009
 delete keep this position time 

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:04.509
 9.300 euros 

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:06.790
 if there are only four, the prizes are awarded 

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:10.659
 super chubby all above 10 thousand 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:12.189
 euro and it is the moment of px10 that it closes 

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:15.579
 his experience and this sunday 

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:18.969
 special once again routed by 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:19.299
 anti rex 87 anti reds as I said 

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:21.030
 before 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:23.830
 you will remember it because he won 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:26.940
 a very short time ago just a sunday 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.940
 special on October 20th 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:34.200
 here he is holding his pair of sects 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:39.030
 take off and px10 fourth position remains the 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:42.180
 podium then 10,800 euros for peak while 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:47.000
 we remain in three who knows that there is not 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:50.100
 a back to back by anti rex 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.630
 despite the conquered dishes and they were 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:54.000
 we have seen so many of them before 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:56.250
 from patatone failed to 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.350
 recover from heavy setbacks 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:02.700
 in the last hands especially in the 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:04.830
 hand number 90 then in this hand 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:10.140
 in the end he relies on some fate with 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:12.120
 woman 9so viola however tn with k 7 up 

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:15.120
 in the end even double and then 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:18.140
 patatone out of the hoes know that 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:21.270
 will see anti- Rex and Saviola opposed 

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:23.460
 anti rex disadvantaged part in the head a 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:26.220
 decisive head then makes two double ups of 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:29.790
 followed during the zap then a mega 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:32.370
 cooler brings an edge over the viola e 

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:35.330
 up to this final hand where I know purple 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:40.170
 about six times the anti next stack 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:42.800
 all regular jack 6 against 86 and then 

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:45.870
 so purple is the winner but we have 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:47.820
 the interview of the great anti reg 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:50.540
 which has already won the sunday special 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:50.540

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:56.449
 hello everyone is going to go good job 

00:05:53.249 --> 00:05:59.219

00:05:56.449 --> 00:06:02.639
 jars known second sunday special 

00:05:59.219 --> 00:06:05.129
 I made first place a month ago in short 

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:07.379
 camper with trees in sanremo per 

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:08.849
 the interview but then everything else 

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:11.360
 we would have this interview 

00:06:08.849 --> 00:06:11.360
 done 

00:06:12.269 --> 00:06:17.459
 and then it happened really very regret 

00:06:15.329 --> 00:06:21.089
 talk about why we do the surroundings 

00:06:17.459 --> 00:06:25.439
 arrived there tactical work 3 to 1 is like 

00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:29.369
 reassembled ok, that offer will find the 

00:06:25.439 --> 00:06:31.619
 a little tiramolla because he wanted more money 

00:06:29.369 --> 00:06:34.139
 of expected is obviously announces me 

00:06:31.619 --> 00:06:37.799
 I didn't want to accept the deal he has 

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:41.249
 proposed an intimate boss made 329 

00:06:37.799 --> 00:06:44.999
 and led to the first one he won 

00:06:41.249 --> 00:06:48.589
 he is so good that they are rugby 

00:06:44.999 --> 00:06:51.179
 young because it was just 19 years old 

00:06:48.589 --> 00:06:53.610
 first the special room with a month not 

00:06:51.179 --> 00:06:57.029

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:59.279
 heads up game 50 100 200 

00:06:57.029 --> 00:07:02.819
 let's see if he's doing it in the fifteenth century 

00:06:59.279 --> 00:07:07.709
 let's see how it does after the victory 

00:07:02.819 --> 00:07:11.789
 of the shortest course are about 70 kg of 

00:07:07.709 --> 00:07:12.869
 goal for a goal for real life so I am 

00:07:11.789 --> 00:07:15.719

00:07:12.869 --> 00:07:17.819

00:07:15.719 --> 00:07:20.789
