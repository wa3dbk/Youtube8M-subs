00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
hopefully some more call of duty maps

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.570 
hopefully some more call of duty maps
I'm<00:02:46.350> probably<00:02:46.920> going<00:02:47.130> to<00:02:47.220> upload<00:02:47.550> some

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
minecraft gameplay but on this map

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.710 
minecraft gameplay but on this map
playing<00:02:50.460> probably<00:02:50.880> some<00:02:51.030> capture<00:02:51.390> the<00:02:51.480> flag

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
playing probably some capture the flag

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.230 
playing probably some capture the flag
probably<00:02:52.560> some<00:02:52.740> free<00:02:53.160> for<00:02:53.370> all<00:02:53.430> or<00:02:53.640> even<00:02:53.670> some

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
hopefully and one thing about this map

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.230 
hopefully and one thing about this map
as<00:02:58.620> well<00:02:58.650> there<00:02:59.220> is<00:02:59.370> an<00:02:59.490> underground<00:02:59.760> part

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
as well there is an underground part

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.060 
as well there is an underground part
which<00:03:00.510> is<00:03:00.540> basically<00:03:01.230> nothing<00:03:01.440> just<00:03:01.830> water

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
which is basically nothing just water

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.700 
which is basically nothing just water
and<00:03:02.190> mobs<00:03:02.610> and<00:03:02.970> that's<00:03:03.810> all<00:03:04.050> about<00:03:04.350> you<00:03:04.680> know

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:04.710 
and mobs and that's all about you know

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:06.950 
and mobs and that's all about you know
the<00:03:05.070> under<00:03:05.550> part<00:03:06.270> of<00:03:06.360> the<00:03:06.420> map<00:03:06.570> nothing

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:06.960 
the under part of the map nothing

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.290 
the under part of the map nothing
special<00:03:07.200> about<00:03:07.440> that<00:03:07.560> but<00:03:08.340> again<00:03:08.520> the<00:03:08.940> map<00:03:09.120> is

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
special about that but again the map is

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.240 
special about that but again the map is
absolutely<00:03:09.810> fantastic<00:03:09.990> I<00:03:10.500> can't<00:03:10.830> wait<00:03:11.010> to<00:03:11.040> be

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250
