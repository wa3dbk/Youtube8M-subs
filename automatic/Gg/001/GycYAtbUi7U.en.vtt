00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 the wisdom teeth also known 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.420
 as third molars or wisdom teeth 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.580
 are the teeth of the jaw 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.920
 which take longer to appear if it is 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.389
 come to leave the tooth cordales have 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.880
 taken the name wisdom teeth 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.770
 For this reason, since people 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.930
 are in a development phase of 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.150
 the advanced reason when these molars 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.070
 they make their first appearance the molars 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.230
 of the trial are behind the 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.840
 molars specifically in the area more 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.970
 far and back of the jaw not 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.859
 grow on the edge of the gum but 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.960
 when ascending and exiting, the 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.300
 Alignment space of the rest of 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.430
 molar parts the four pieces that 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.410
 make the wisdom teeth and that is 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.629
 Distribute as one per quadrant 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.820
 vocal are not part of the pieces 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.039
 teeth used by humans in 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.350
 currently this means that 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.940
 time ago these third molars 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.070
 will be used by our 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.989
 ancestors to crush and chew 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.270
 food of vegetable origin since these 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.340
 molars facilitate the chewing of 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.739
 plants the wisdom teeth as 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.359
 vestige of evolution nature 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.159
 of the human being has been varying in 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.120
 according to their needs and their 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.920
 habits 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.720
 the jaw has witnessed 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.580
 numerous changes that have been adapting 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.890
 to the human being at each stage of the 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.470
 evolution and there are still vestiges of 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.900
 past times this is the case of the 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.910
 wisdom teeth third molars 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.430
 of which we spoke had in the 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:25.560
 passed a relevant position power and 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.840
 importance in our jaw since 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.940
 they allowed us to adapt to different 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.830
 environments in terms of food and 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.020
 they were also very useful for 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.330
 shred as thousands have gone by 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.460
 of years the oral environment in which 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.790
 wisdom teeth were gone 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.440
 varying by reducing its space to the maximum 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.270
 this has caused them to become 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.310
 annoying dental pieces and 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.530
 unnecessary since many 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.330
 bones have decreased in size others 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.310
 as the molars have not gone hand in hand in 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.280
 how much to evolution since to these 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.570
 heights should have disappeared 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.700
 dental problems that cause 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.830
 wisdom teeth the decrease of 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.170
 size of our jaw and lack 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:06.360
 of space for the 32 dental pieces 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.090
 that make up causes situations 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.830
 uncomfortable for our dental health weigh 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.900
 that a growing percentage of the 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.480
 population already lacks the teeth of the 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.090
 and others nevertheless suffers because of 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.040
 these uncomfortable and unusable molars the 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.870
 main problem of the birth of 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.209
 wisdom teeth is the pressure that 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.860
 they exert on the rest of teeth what 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:28.379
 causes in a large number of occasions 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.299
 not only strong headaches and 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:32.220
 mouth but also movements and 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:34.560
 deformations of the teeth that are already 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.720
 they were correctly seated in 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.939
 many cases people who have corrected 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.760
 his jaw are affected again 

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:43.500
 by the exit of the wisdom teeth 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.780
 the most recommended by dentist in 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.670
 madrid ' in this particular case is the 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.069
 extraction of the teeth to avoid 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.109
 deformations other common problems 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:54.540
 caused by the exit of the teeth of the 

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:56.519
 judgment are the cysts or tumors in the 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.250
 mouth the resorption of the root of 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:01.500
 tooth et cetera how to recover after 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.420
 extraction of wisdom teeth one 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.459
 once extracted the molars cordal is for 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.470
 a dentist or an oral surgeon the 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.689
 Rest of the mouth is essential for 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.730
 recover from the operation is 

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:13.709
 recommended that the patient should report on their 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.659
 work of the proximity of the operation 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:17.970
 to request a few days or do 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:19.620
 match the surgery with a Friday to 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.690
 to be able to recover during it 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.430
 week dentists recommend 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.290
 after the operation do not perform 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.510
 physical activities that tire the 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.580
 patient and that are dangerous for 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.980
 the points you just received in the 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.659
 Under no circumstances the patient 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.700
 must extract the gauze that the dentist 

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:38.250
 leave to cover the wound during 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.440
 less than half an hour the risk of 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.819
 Hemorrhage is high before that period 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.650
 of time so if it has 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:45.720
 recommended changing gauze te 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.269
 I recommend that you wait quietly 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.220
 until 30 minutes have passed in 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:52.440
 about the presence of blood in your 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.569
 mouth you must be careful and not spit 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.700
 directly from the mouth as this 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:58.890
 movement could release a clot 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.470
 the inflammation of the gums is almost 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:03.720
 inevitable although there are patients who 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.370
 they see less affected the inflammation is 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.829
 a natural reaction after surgery 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.629
 whose annoyance we can reduce by having 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:11.250
 account aspects of the position of 

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:13.650
 our body during sleep 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:15.900
 for example raise your head and use 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:18.329
 very cold compresses to reduce the 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.070
 inflammation of diaz you must be aware 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:21.870
 that you can not make a living 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.760
 normal immediately after the 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.830
 surgery and that food and 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.379
 drinks will be a relevant aspect 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.569
 to take into account the specialists in 

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:32.759
 dentistry we recommend the flour 

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:34.949
 wheat foods such as yogurt or mashed 

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:36.629
 of potato or apple compote as 

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:39.090
 successful possibilities for 

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:40.979
 recovery you should avoid food 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.560
 hard and opt for a soft diet 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:45.449
 lacking spicy foods alone 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.520
 will contribute to irritate your mouth and over 

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:49.289
 all the wound in regards to the 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.300
 hydration we advise you not to 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:53.879
 you neglect the intake of water after 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.830
 wisdom teeth surgery is not 

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:58.259
 allows the consumption of alcohol or the 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:00.240
 hot drinks the day after the 

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:02.159
 already you can use the 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.169
 brush and floss although with 

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:06.270
 Special care on the side of the mouth 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:08.639
 that is sensitive by the points 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:10.409
 the use of mouthwash even what 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:12.569
 We will leave for later because 

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:14.909
 Many mouthwashes contain alcohol and 

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:16.710
 this prolongs the bleeding what if 

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:18.599
 you can use for the hygiene of your 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.039
 mouth like rinse is water with salt 

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:22.199
 after each meal 

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:24.020
 do not forget to take care of your mouth and assist with 

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:26.610
 the recommended frequency to the dentist 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:28.590
 any discomfort in the dental area of 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:30.330
 the one we've talked about in this post can 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:32.190
 be an indication that a tooth of 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:34.440
 trial is about to come out 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:36.540
 in proper hygiene in your mouth to 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.520
 avoid infections and do not be afraid of 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:41.160
 oral tooth extraction surgery 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:43.050
 of the trial remember that these teeth already 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:45.240
 are not necessary and that extract the 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:47.340
 will avoid space problems in your 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:49.610
 gums and remove pressure from your 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:49.610
 teeth
