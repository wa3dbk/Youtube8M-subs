things what do you do and I really have
two<00:00:36.809> answers<00:00:37.200> for<00:00:37.500> that<00:00:37.530> you<00:00:38.280> know<00:00:38.340> my<00:00:38.520> place

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
two answers for that you know my place

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.610 
two answers for that you know my place
isn't<00:00:39.120> huge<00:00:39.329> either<00:00:39.710> so<00:00:40.710> shelves<00:00:41.700> shelves

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
isn't huge either so shelves shelves

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.959 
isn't huge either so shelves shelves
increased<00:00:43.620> square<00:00:43.950> footage<00:00:44.340> essentially<00:00:44.940> I

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
increased square footage essentially I

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.940
