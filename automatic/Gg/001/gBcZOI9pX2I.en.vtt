create the space step back / you may

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.389 
create the space step back / you may
wonder<00:00:51.539> how<00:00:52.350> did<00:00:52.559> I<00:00:52.620> do<00:00:52.680> that<00:00:52.800> I<00:00:52.920> guess<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.219> big

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
wonder how did I do that I guess the big

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.490 
wonder how did I do that I guess the big
guy<00:00:53.550> is<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.059> same<00:00:54.300> way<00:00:54.510> you<00:00:55.020> try<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:55.260> create

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
guy is the same way you try to create

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.639 
guy is the same way you try to create
the<00:00:55.590> same<00:00:55.800> space<00:00:56.190> get<00:00:57.000> on<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.180> smaller<00:00:57.480> guy<00:00:57.719> and

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
the same space get on a smaller guy and

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.260 
the same space get on a smaller guy and
a<00:00:58.710> big<00:00:58.859> guy<00:00:59.010> a<00:00:59.219> bigger<00:00:59.489> guy<00:00:59.640> is<00:00:59.699> even<00:01:00.149> easier

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
a big guy a bigger guy is even easier

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.900 
a big guy a bigger guy is even easier

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
because I can't move that quickly so you

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:03.860 
because I can't move that quickly so you
do<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.149> same<00:01:03.180> thing

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870
