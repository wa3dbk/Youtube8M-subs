misconception<00:00:59.460> with<00:01:00.180> combustion<00:01:00.570> we're<00:01:00.960> in

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
misconception with combustion we're in

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.899 
misconception with combustion we're in
Cataclysm<00:01:01.710> it<00:01:01.830> would<00:01:01.920> be<00:01:02.100> more<00:01:02.699> of<00:01:02.820> a

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:02.909 
Cataclysm it would be more of a

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:05.899 
Cataclysm it would be more of a
game-changer<00:01:03.510> for<00:01:03.540> arenas<00:01:04.080> but<00:01:04.739> in<00:01:05.250> reality

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
game-changer for arenas but in reality

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.430 
game-changer for arenas but in reality
when<00:01:06.299> it<00:01:06.390> comes<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.630> mr.<00:01:06.840> Pandaria<00:01:07.260> they

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:07.440 
when it comes to mr. Pandaria they

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.170 
when it comes to mr. Pandaria they
changed<00:01:07.799> it<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.130> more<00:01:08.369> of<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:08.610> direct<00:01:09.000> damage

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
changed it to more of a direct damage

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.539 
changed it to more of a direct damage
done<00:01:09.810> because<00:01:10.380> they've<00:01:10.530> taken<00:01:10.710> out<00:01:10.950> impacts

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
done because they've taken out impacts

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.390 
done because they've taken out impacts
done<00:01:11.720> so<00:01:12.720> they're<00:01:12.960> taking<00:01:13.260> combustion<00:01:14.220> and

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
done so they're taking combustion and

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.520 
done so they're taking combustion and
they've<00:01:14.520> given<00:01:14.730> it<00:01:14.910> a<00:01:15.000> 3<00:01:15.210> second<00:01:15.600> stun<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:16.020> it

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
they've given it a 3 second stun and it

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.860 
they've given it a 3 second stun and it
does<00:01:16.740> instant<00:01:17.400> direct<00:01:17.910> damage<00:01:18.060> now<00:01:18.390> it<00:01:18.660> does

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:18.870 
does instant direct damage now it does

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.460 
does instant direct damage now it does
instant<00:01:19.290> 25k<00:01:19.980> damage<00:01:20.460> which<00:01:20.730> is<00:01:21.320> not<00:01:22.320> that

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
instant 25k damage which is not that

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.320 
instant 25k damage which is not that
much<00:01:22.530> I<00:01:22.890> mean<00:01:23.070> compared<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:23.640> its<00:01:23.820> equivalent

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
much I mean compared to its equivalent

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.300 
much I mean compared to its equivalent
of<00:01:24.420> an<00:01:24.900> inferno<00:01:25.320> plastic<00:01:25.830> if<00:01:25.950> you<00:01:26.070> get<00:01:26.220> an

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
of an inferno plastic if you get an

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.920 
of an inferno plastic if you get an
impact<00:01:26.610> product<00:01:26.910> in<00:01:27.000> Cataclysm<00:01:27.600> it<00:01:27.750> does

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
impact product in Cataclysm it does

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.570 
impact product in Cataclysm it does
about<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.380> same<00:01:28.560> amount<00:01:28.590> of<00:01:28.860> damage<00:01:29.190> except

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
about the same amount of damage except

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.850 
about the same amount of damage except
for<00:01:29.730> it<00:01:29.820> scaled<00:01:30.240> up<00:01:30.360> for<00:01:30.840> mr.<00:01:31.410> Pandaria

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
for it scaled up for mr. Pandaria

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.310 
for it scaled up for mr. Pandaria
obviously<00:01:32.450> so<00:01:33.450> I'm<00:01:33.510> going<00:01:33.690> to<00:01:33.720> demonstrate<00:01:33.900> on

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
obviously so I'm going to demonstrate on

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.020 
obviously so I'm going to demonstrate on
this<00:01:34.440> DK<00:01:34.800> what<00:01:35.040> combustion<00:01:35.550> does<00:01:35.700> I'm<00:01:35.880> going

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
this DK what combustion does I'm going

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.550 
this DK what combustion does I'm going
to<00:01:36.090> get<00:01:36.240> an<00:01:36.330> instant<00:01:36.660> part<00:01:36.870> or<00:01:37.020> not<00:01:37.170> an<00:01:37.260> instant

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
to get an instant part or not an instant

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.040 
to get an instant part or not an instant
power<00:01:37.620> blast<00:01:37.860> but<00:01:38.040> a<00:01:38.070> power<00:01:38.250> blast<00:01:38.490> crit<00:01:38.820> and

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.050 
power blast but a power blast crit and

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.660 
power blast but a power blast crit and
that's<00:01:40.050> all<00:01:40.230> that<00:01:40.260> scales<00:01:40.620> also<00:01:40.920> is<00:01:40.980> now<00:01:41.130> it

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
that's all that scales also is now it

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.100 
that's all that scales also is now it
doesn't<00:01:41.940> actually<00:01:42.030> scale<00:01:42.450> off<00:01:42.659> of<00:01:42.810> looting

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
doesn't actually scale off of looting

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.140 
doesn't actually scale off of looting
bomb<00:01:43.290> so<00:01:43.530> I<00:01:43.560> get<00:01:43.740> a<00:01:43.770> 40k<00:01:44.159> crit<00:01:44.520> then<00:01:45.060> I

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.150 
bomb so I get a 40k crit then I

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.030 
bomb so I get a 40k crit then I
combustion<00:01:45.690> and<00:01:45.870> it's<00:01:46.470> about<00:01:46.560> an<00:01:46.740> 8k

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
combustion and it's about an 8k

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.470 
combustion and it's about an 8k
combustion<00:01:47.520> it<00:01:47.640> really<00:01:47.880> doesn't<00:01:48.150> do<00:01:48.300> that

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:48.480 
combustion it really doesn't do that

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.600 
combustion it really doesn't do that
much<00:01:48.540> damage<00:01:48.690> anymore<00:01:49.409> because<00:01:50.159> it<00:01:50.340> doesn't

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
much damage anymore because it doesn't

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.190 
much damage anymore because it doesn't
scale<00:01:50.760> off<00:01:50.909> of<00:01:51.030> living<00:01:51.330> bomb<00:01:53.870> okay<00:01:54.870> so<00:01:54.930> now<00:01:55.140> I'm

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
scale off of living bomb okay so now I'm

24 k crib and it's a 12k combustion
that's<00:02:23.970> not<00:02:24.180> bad<00:02:24.450> but<00:02:25.200> when<00:02:25.740> it<00:02:25.830> comes<00:02:26.010> down<00:02:26.070> to

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
that's not bad but when it comes down to

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.860 
that's not bad but when it comes down to
a<00:02:26.310> player<00:02:26.610> it<00:02:26.760> only<00:02:26.880> skills<00:02:27.210> to<00:02:27.360> about<00:02:27.480> 3k<00:02:27.810> for

second<00:02:28.380> with<00:02:28.470> 6k<00:02:28.740> crits<00:02:29.130> so<00:02:29.970> it's<00:02:30.120> really<00:02:30.420> not

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
second with 6k crits so it's really not

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.530 
second with 6k crits so it's really not
that<00:02:30.690> much<00:02:31.760> compared<00:02:32.760> to<00:02:32.850> cataclysm<00:02:33.330> because

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
that much compared to cataclysm because

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.020 
that much compared to cataclysm because

they've made combustion quite less

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.580 
they've made combustion quite less
damage<00:02:36.420> they<00:02:36.570> don't<00:02:36.750> want<00:02:36.960> a<00:02:37.140> whole<00:02:37.350> raid

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
hit through it okay

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.560 
hit through it okay
this<00:03:36.380> and<00:03:36.830> then<00:03:37.340> I'm<00:03:37.550> going<00:03:37.730> to<00:03:38.060> pyroblast

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570 
this and then I'm going to pyroblast

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:43.780 
this and then I'm going to pyroblast
them<00:03:38.840> twice<00:03:40.270> and<00:03:42.190> both<00:03:43.190> of<00:03:43.250> them<00:03:43.490> create

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
them twice and both of them create

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.730 
them twice and both of them create
living<00:03:44.270> vom<00:03:44.570> combustion<00:03:45.350> and<00:03:45.530> that

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:45.740 
living vom combustion and that

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:47.830 
living vom combustion and that
combustion<00:03:46.130> takes<00:03:46.310> for<00:03:46.520> 22<00:03:46.910> k<00:03:46.940> and<00:03:47.330> then<00:03:47.510> ends

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
combustion takes for 22 k and then ends

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.590 
combustion takes for 22 k and then ends
up<00:03:47.900> finishing<00:03:48.140> them<00:03:48.440> off<00:03:48.730> because<00:03:49.730> well<00:03:50.510> it

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:50.600 
up finishing them off because well it

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:55.020 
up finishing them off because well it
should<00:03:50.810> finish<00:03:50.990> them<00:03:51.230> off<00:03:53.020> yeah<00:03:54.020> okay<00:03:54.470> it<00:03:54.650> did

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
should finish them off yeah okay it did

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.670 
should finish them off yeah okay it did
so<00:03:56.030> combustion<00:03:56.959> really<00:03:57.200> doesn't<00:03:57.470> do<00:03:57.560> that

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
so combustion really doesn't do that

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.140 
so combustion really doesn't do that
much<00:03:57.740> damage<00:03:57.860> it<00:03:58.280> I<00:03:58.370> mean<00:03:58.550> think<00:03:58.910> about<00:03:59.000> it

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
much damage it I mean think about it

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.990 
much damage it I mean think about it
like<00:03:59.270> this<00:03:59.480> if<00:03:59.690> you<00:03:59.810> were<00:03:59.930> to<00:04:00.020> use<00:04:00.080> his<00:04:01.000> his

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
like this if you were to use his his

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.060 
like this if you were to use his his
defensives<00:04:02.690> that<00:04:03.170> combustion<00:04:03.470> probably

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:04.070 
defensives that combustion probably

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:05.740 
defensives that combustion probably
would<00:04:04.220> have<00:04:04.280> been<00:04:04.430> completely<00:04:04.610> negated<00:04:05.240> but

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
would have been completely negated but

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.240 
would have been completely negated but
something<00:04:06.170> to<00:04:06.290> keep<00:04:06.410> in<00:04:06.530> mind<00:04:06.590> is<00:04:06.920> that<00:04:06.980> they

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
something to keep in mind is that they

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.010 
something to keep in mind is that they
have<00:04:07.430> put<00:04:07.640> in<00:04:07.730> a<00:04:07.820> glyph<00:04:08.120> that<00:04:08.390> increases<00:04:08.870> the

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:09.020 
have put in a glyph that increases the

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:10.990 
have put in a glyph that increases the
direct<00:04:09.380> damage<00:04:09.590> of<00:04:09.920> combustion<00:04:10.310> by<00:04:10.580> a<00:04:10.610> hundred

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
direct damage of combustion by a hundred

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.580 
direct damage of combustion by a hundred
percent<00:04:11.090> as<00:04:11.510> well<00:04:11.810> as<00:04:11.959> increases<00:04:12.440> the

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
percent as well as increases the

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:14.949 
percent as well as increases the
duration<00:04:13.160> and<00:04:13.310> cooldown<00:04:14.120> of<00:04:14.180> combustion<00:04:14.690> by

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
duration and cooldown of combustion by

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:17.319 
duration and cooldown of combustion by
one<00:04:15.140> hundred<00:04:15.410> percent<00:04:15.489> so<00:04:16.489> what<00:04:16.820> this<00:04:16.970> means

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:17.329 
one hundred percent so what this means

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:19.960 
one hundred percent so what this means
is<00:04:17.600> that<00:04:17.660> you<00:04:17.959> can<00:04:18.140> essentially<00:04:18.530> have<00:04:18.859> a<00:04:19.160> what

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
is that you can essentially have a what

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:21.729 
is that you can essentially have a what
is<00:04:20.060> it<00:04:20.180> about<00:04:20.269> a<00:04:20.390> 20<00:04:20.720> second<00:04:21.049> dot<00:04:21.200> twenty

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
is it about a 20 second dot twenty

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:23.860 
is it about a 20 second dot twenty
second<00:04:22.070> combustion<00:04:22.310> which<00:04:23.210> I<00:04:23.450> mean<00:04:23.660> it

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
second combustion which I mean it

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.420 
second combustion which I mean it
doesn't<00:04:24.110> really<00:04:24.200> take<00:04:24.440> for<00:04:24.470> that<00:04:24.740> much<00:04:24.950> but

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
doesn't really take for that much but

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.030 
doesn't really take for that much but
it's<00:04:26.090> still<00:04:26.330> pretty<00:04:26.660> Opie<00:04:27.380> cliff<00:04:27.680> I<00:04:27.830> would

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.040 
it's still pretty Opie cliff I would

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.430 
it's still pretty Opie cliff I would
like<00:04:28.190> to<00:04:28.250> see<00:04:28.550> it<00:04:28.700> nerfed<00:04:29.030> about<00:04:29.900> twenty-five

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
like to see it nerfed about twenty-five

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.920 
like to see it nerfed about twenty-five
percent<00:04:30.590> I<00:04:30.890> don't<00:04:31.130> think<00:04:31.190> that<00:04:31.520> I<00:04:31.730> don't<00:04:32.630> think

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
percent I don't think that I don't think

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:34.120 
percent I don't think that I don't think
it<00:04:32.990> should<00:04:33.020> be<00:04:33.230> a<00:04:33.380> hundred<00:04:33.560> percent<00:04:33.710> like

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.130 
it should be a hundred percent like

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.400 
it should be a hundred percent like
that's<00:04:34.310> a<00:04:34.370> lot<00:04:34.550> of<00:04:34.580> damage<00:04:34.880> I<00:04:35.330> mean<00:04:35.990> as<00:04:36.110> you<00:04:36.200> can

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.410 
that's a lot of damage I mean as you can

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.530 
that's a lot of damage I mean as you can
see<00:04:36.590> my<00:04:36.770> combustion<00:04:37.220> hits<00:04:37.490> for<00:04:37.730> 50k<00:04:38.210> now<00:04:38.419> it

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:38.540 
see my combustion hits for 50k now it

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:40.750 
see my combustion hits for 50k now it
can<00:04:38.780> create<00:04:39.020> for<00:04:39.290> about<00:04:39.530> I<00:04:39.979> would<00:04:40.310> say<00:04:40.460> around

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:40.760 
can create for about I would say around

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.409 
can create for about I would say around
adk<00:04:41.330> realistically<00:04:42.400> but<00:04:43.400> I'm<00:04:44.030> going<00:04:44.240> to<00:04:44.300> go

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:44.419 
adk realistically but I'm going to go

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:46.060 
adk realistically but I'm going to go
ahead<00:04:44.450> and<00:04:44.660> use<00:04:44.960> the<00:04:45.140> same<00:04:45.380> full<00:04:45.740> amount<00:04:45.979> of

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.070 
ahead and use the same full amount of

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:49.300 
ahead and use the same full amount of
power<00:04:46.280> ups<00:04:46.490> and<00:04:46.700> show<00:04:46.850> you<00:04:46.910> what<00:04:47.210> the<00:04:48.310> full

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
power ups and show you what the full

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.159 
power ups and show you what the full
combustion<00:04:49.760> with<00:04:49.970> the<00:04:50.090> glyph<00:04:50.360> actually<00:04:50.960> does

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:51.169 
combustion with the glyph actually does

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:54.219 
combustion with the glyph actually does
I'm<00:04:51.470> I<00:04:52.220> might<00:04:52.669> use<00:04:53.210> two<00:04:53.450> or<00:04:53.479> three<00:04:53.840> combustion

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:54.229 
I'm I might use two or three combustion

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:55.570 
I'm I might use two or three combustion
zai<00:04:54.410> don't<00:04:54.560> know<00:04:54.650> it<00:04:54.860> I<00:04:55.070> don't<00:04:55.250> want<00:04:55.370> to<00:04:55.430> kill

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
zai don't know it I don't want to kill

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:57.010 
zai don't know it I don't want to kill
them<00:04:55.700> before<00:04:55.820> the<00:04:56.060> combustion<00:04:56.330> gets<00:04:56.570> off<00:04:56.720> for

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
them before the combustion gets off for

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.290 
them before the combustion gets off for
the<00:04:57.080> purpose<00:04:57.350> of<00:04:57.440> the<00:04:57.590> video<00:04:57.800> so<00:04:58.700> here<00:04:59.030> we<00:04:59.180> go

00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.300 
the purpose of the video so here we go

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.440 
the purpose of the video so here we go
I'm<00:05:00.140> going<00:05:00.350> to<00:05:00.620> get<00:05:01.010> my<00:05:01.160> trinket<00:05:01.940> procs<00:05:02.060> as

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:02.450 
I'm going to get my trinket procs as

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:06.370 
I'm going to get my trinket procs as
soon<00:05:02.630> as<00:05:02.750> it<00:05:02.870> happens

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:06.380 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.930 

okay<00:05:07.380> there<00:05:07.560> we<00:05:07.620> go<00:05:07.650> drink<00:05:07.979> a<00:05:08.009> pot<00:05:08.190> and<00:05:08.820> i'm

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 
okay there we go drink a pot and i'm

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.040 
okay there we go drink a pot and i'm
going<00:05:09.030> to<00:05:09.090> get<00:05:09.240> my<00:05:09.270> encounters<00:05:09.720> award<00:05:09.930> he's

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.050 
going to get my encounters award he's

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.850 
going to get my encounters award he's
going<00:05:10.169> to<00:05:10.229> pop<00:05:10.350> it<00:05:12.229> come<00:05:13.229> on<00:05:13.380> all<00:05:13.620> right<00:05:13.710> there

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 
going to pop it come on all right there

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:19.060 
going to pop it come on all right there
we<00:05:13.919> go<00:05:14.539> and<00:05:15.539> then<00:05:15.720> deep<00:05:16.199> freeze<00:05:16.669> pyroblast

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:19.070 
we go and then deep freeze pyroblast

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.469 
we go and then deep freeze pyroblast
should<00:05:20.070> get<00:05:20.250> another<00:05:20.430> pair<00:05:20.729> of<00:05:20.759> luster<00:05:21.270> and

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:21.479 
should get another pair of luster and

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:24.140 
should get another pair of luster and
then<00:05:22.139> yep<00:05:22.470> Fire<00:05:22.770> Blast<00:05:22.800> I<00:05:23.400> didn't<00:05:24.000> create

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 
then yep Fire Blast I didn't create

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.540 
then yep Fire Blast I didn't create
that's<00:05:24.419> okay<00:05:24.660> and<00:05:24.870> then<00:05:25.590> as<00:05:25.770> you<00:05:25.919> can<00:05:26.070> see<00:05:26.250> it

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.550 
that's okay and then as you can see it

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:30.320 
that's okay and then as you can see it
does<00:05:26.729> 16k<00:05:27.630> damage<00:05:28.009> pretty<00:05:29.009> simple<00:05:29.190> and<00:05:29.580> then

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:30.330 
does 16k damage pretty simple and then

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.150 
does 16k damage pretty simple and then
it<00:05:30.449> lasts<00:05:30.750> for<00:05:30.870> 20<00:05:31.139> seconds<00:05:31.530> that's<00:05:31.770> what<00:05:32.039> the

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160 
it lasts for 20 seconds that's what the

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.650 
it lasts for 20 seconds that's what the
big<00:05:32.340> one<00:05:32.520> is<00:05:32.550> is<00:05:32.850> that<00:05:32.970> it<00:05:33.090> lasts<00:05:33.270> for<00:05:33.449> 20

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:33.660 
big one is is that it lasts for 20

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:35.180 
big one is is that it lasts for 20
seconds<00:05:34.020> it's<00:05:34.199> just<00:05:34.380> a<00:05:34.440> 20-second<00:05:35.070> long

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:35.190 
seconds it's just a 20-second long

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:36.980 
seconds it's just a 20-second long
combustion<00:05:35.729> and<00:05:35.910> this<00:05:36.090> will<00:05:36.330> end<00:05:36.509> up<00:05:36.660> killing

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:36.990 
combustion and this will end up killing

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:39.890 
combustion and this will end up killing
him<00:05:37.110> just<00:05:37.350> because<00:05:37.470> it's<00:05:37.710> 20<00:05:37.979> seconds<00:05:38.900> like

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 
him just because it's 20 seconds like

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.870 
him just because it's 20 seconds like
the<00:05:40.050> glyph<00:05:40.289> it<00:05:40.470> does<00:05:40.710> this<00:05:40.949> past<00:05:41.250> 20<00:05:41.520> seconds

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:41.880 
the glyph it does this past 20 seconds

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.600 
the glyph it does this past 20 seconds
the<00:05:42.090> glyph<00:05:42.330> was<00:05:42.510> the<00:05:42.630> reason<00:05:42.900> he<00:05:42.930> died<00:05:43.550> so<00:05:44.550> I

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:44.610 
the glyph was the reason he died so I

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:46.100 
the glyph was the reason he died so I
would<00:05:44.970> like<00:05:45.120> to<00:05:45.150> see<00:05:45.389> the<00:05:45.510> glyph<00:05:45.720> get<00:05:45.900> nerfed

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:46.110 
would like to see the glyph get nerfed

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:47.420 
would like to see the glyph get nerfed
but<00:05:46.410> I<00:05:46.440> really<00:05:46.770> don't<00:05:46.949> think<00:05:47.010> it'll<00:05:47.280> be<00:05:47.370> that

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:47.430 
but I really don't think it'll be that

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.540 
but I really don't think it'll be that
big<00:05:47.789> of<00:05:47.850> a<00:05:47.970> deal<00:05:48.120> if<00:05:48.300> it's<00:05:48.479> not<00:05:49.460> because<00:05:50.460> I

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:50.550 
big of a deal if it's not because I

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:52.700 
big of a deal if it's not because I
don't<00:05:50.580> think<00:05:51.000> it<00:05:51.120> is<00:05:51.539> actually<00:05:51.990> extremely

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:52.710 
don't think it is actually extremely

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:54.980 
don't think it is actually extremely
opie<00:05:53.400> but<00:05:53.610> I<00:05:53.639> do<00:05:53.760> feel<00:05:54.090> like<00:05:54.240> it<00:05:54.419> is<00:05:54.539> a<00:05:54.570> little

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:54.990 
opie but I do feel like it is a little

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:58.150

everything we've learned today remember

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:02.420 
everything we've learned today remember
that<00:06:00.449> combustion<00:06:00.780> is<00:06:01.110> only<00:06:01.410> determined<00:06:02.130> by

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:02.430 
that combustion is only determined by

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:04.460 
that combustion is only determined by
ignite<00:06:02.910> and<00:06:03.180> pyroblast<00:06:03.690> dots<00:06:04.050> now<00:06:04.289> it's

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:04.470 
ignite and pyroblast dots now it's

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:06.140 
ignite and pyroblast dots now it's
actually<00:06:04.650> not<00:06:04.979> determined<00:06:05.550> by<00:06:05.580> living<00:06:05.970> bomb

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:06.150 
actually not determined by living bomb

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:07.850 
actually not determined by living bomb
as<00:06:06.300> well<00:06:06.509> so<00:06:06.720> they<00:06:06.840> did<00:06:07.020> nerf<00:06:07.289> it<00:06:07.470> a<00:06:07.530> little<00:06:07.650> bit

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:07.860 
as well so they did nerf it a little bit

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:10.520 
as well so they did nerf it a little bit
but<00:06:08.160> they<00:06:08.340> have<00:06:08.610> given<00:06:08.940> it<00:06:09.180> a<00:06:09.330> stun<00:06:09.900> a<00:06:10.110> three

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:10.530 
but they have given it a stun a three

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:12.080 
but they have given it a stun a three
second<00:06:10.919> stun<00:06:11.160> as<00:06:11.310> well<00:06:11.490> as<00:06:11.580> some<00:06:11.760> direct

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:12.090 
second stun as well as some direct

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:14.000

sure<00:06:14.190> to<00:06:14.220> remember<00:06:14.520> that<00:06:14.669> the<00:06:15.389> best<00:06:15.599> way<00:06:15.810> to

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:15.900 
sure to remember that the best way to

sure to remember that the best way to
get<00:06:16.020> a<00:06:16.080> big<00:06:16.289> combustion<00:06:16.830> now<00:06:16.979> is<00:06:17.190> literally<00:06:17.580> if

00:06:17.839 --> 00:06:17.849

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:19.919 
you just get a big pyroblast by stacking

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:21.529 
you just get a big pyroblast by stacking
all<00:06:20.160> of<00:06:20.280> your<00:06:20.400> spellpower<00:06:20.639> getting<00:06:21.419> your

00:06:21.529 --> 00:06:21.539 
all of your spellpower getting your

00:06:21.539 --> 00:06:23.089

00:06:23.089 --> 00:06:23.099 
encounters ward up stuff like that and

00:06:23.099 --> 00:06:25.219 
encounters ward up stuff like that and
if<00:06:23.490> you<00:06:23.610> choose<00:06:23.940> to<00:06:24.270> you<00:06:24.479> can<00:06:24.630> use<00:06:24.780> the<00:06:24.960> glyph

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:25.229 
if you choose to you can use the glyph

00:06:25.229 --> 00:06:27.230 
if you choose to you can use the glyph
which<00:06:25.440> increases<00:06:25.919> the<00:06:25.919> damage<00:06:26.220> by<00:06:27.120> one

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:27.240 
which increases the damage by one

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.670 
which increases the damage by one
hundred<00:06:27.449> percent<00:06:27.479> but<00:06:28.050> it<00:06:28.139> also<00:06:28.260> increases

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:28.680 
hundred percent but it also increases

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.589 
hundred percent but it also increases
the<00:06:28.979> cool<00:06:29.400> down<00:06:29.610> by<00:06:30.030> one<00:06:30.120> hundred<00:06:30.330> percent<00:06:30.360> as

00:06:30.589 --> 00:06:30.599 
the cool down by one hundred percent as

00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:33.080 
the cool down by one hundred percent as
well<00:06:30.780> so<00:06:31.050> that<00:06:31.470> is<00:06:31.770> totally<00:06:32.610> up<00:06:32.699> to<00:06:32.820> you<00:06:32.849> if<00:06:33.060> you

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:33.090 
well so that is totally up to you if you

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:34.370 
well so that is totally up to you if you

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:35.960 
guys want to use that I'm going to be
using<00:06:34.500> the<00:06:34.830> glyph<00:06:35.010> of<00:06:35.159> deep<00:06:35.340> freeze<00:06:35.610> instead

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:35.970 
using the glyph of deep freeze instead

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:37.730 
using the glyph of deep freeze instead
of<00:06:36.060> this<00:06:36.180> combustion<00:06:36.810> glyph<00:06:37.169> but<00:06:37.409> that's<00:06:37.560> just

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:37.740 
of this combustion glyph but that's just

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:39.589 
of this combustion glyph but that's just
my<00:06:37.949> opinion<00:06:37.979> but<00:06:38.520> that<00:06:38.880> does<00:06:39.060> just<00:06:39.330> about<00:06:39.449> to
