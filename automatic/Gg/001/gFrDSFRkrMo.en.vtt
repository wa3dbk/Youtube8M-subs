of about now two and a half years worth

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.620 
of about now two and a half years worth
of<00:00:16.949> running<00:00:17.250> I'm<00:00:17.490> kind<00:00:17.820> of<00:00:17.880> new<00:00:18.029> to<00:00:18.060> this<00:00:18.270> sport

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
of running I'm kind of new to this sport

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.320 
of running I'm kind of new to this sport
I<00:00:19.140> started<00:00:19.920> with<00:00:20.039> triathlons<00:00:20.609> and<00:00:20.850> runnings

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
I started with triathlons and runnings

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.730 
I started with triathlons and runnings
at<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:21.510> end<00:00:21.660> so<00:00:21.840> I<00:00:21.869> had<00:00:21.990> to<00:00:22.020> figure<00:00:22.410> out<00:00:22.590> how<00:00:22.680> to

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
at the end so I had to figure out how to

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.230 
at the end so I had to figure out how to
do<00:00:22.890> this<00:00:23.010> running<00:00:23.340> thing<00:00:23.369> and<00:00:23.730> it<00:00:23.939> just<00:00:24.150> sort

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
do this running thing and it just sort

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.509 
do this running thing and it just sort
of<00:00:24.359> took<00:00:24.570> over<00:00:24.660> my<00:00:24.900> life<00:00:24.930> and<00:00:25.410> now<00:00:26.220> I've<00:00:26.369> been

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
of took over my life and now I've been

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.640 
of took over my life and now I've been
running<00:00:26.730> for<00:00:26.910> a<00:00:26.970> while<00:00:27.180> and<00:00:27.420> so<00:00:27.599> I<00:00:27.630> have<00:00:27.840> a<00:00:28.109> good

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
running for a while and so I have a good

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.019 
running for a while and so I have a good
year<00:00:28.830> and<00:00:28.949> a<00:00:28.980> half<00:00:29.189> for<00:00:29.220> two<00:00:29.609> years<00:00:29.849> before

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
year and a half for two years before

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.510 
year and a half for two years before
some<00:00:30.510> warrior<00:00:30.869> and<00:00:31.080> then<00:00:31.920> I<00:00:31.949> started<00:00:32.309> some

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
some warrior and then I started some

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.250 
some warrior and then I started some
warrior<00:00:32.790> products<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.870> changes<00:00:34.230> that

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
warrior products and the changes that

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.110 
warrior products and the changes that
it's<00:00:34.469> made<00:00:34.620> is<00:00:34.770> pretty<00:00:34.980> dramatic<00:00:35.399> in<00:00:35.550> the

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
it's made is pretty dramatic in the

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.030 
it's made is pretty dramatic in the
sense<00:00:36.360> of<00:00:36.510> recovery<00:00:37.079> is<00:00:37.230> so<00:00:37.380> much<00:00:37.559> quicker<00:00:37.800> and

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
sense of recovery is so much quicker and

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.190 
sense of recovery is so much quicker and
I'm<00:00:38.700> getting<00:00:38.850> all<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.270> nutrients<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:39.960> the

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
I'm getting all the nutrients and the

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.840 
I'm getting all the nutrients and the
things<00:00:40.410> that<00:00:40.530> I<00:00:40.559> actually<00:00:40.710> need<00:00:41.070> so<00:00:41.700> between

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
things that I actually need so between

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.369 
things that I actually need so between
the<00:00:42.120> combination<00:00:42.600> of<00:00:42.690> those<00:00:42.809> two<00:00:42.870> getting<00:00:43.320> the

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
the combination of those two getting the

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.400 
the combination of those two getting the
proper<00:00:43.559> nutrients<00:00:44.070> each<00:00:44.309> day<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:45.140> doing<00:00:46.140> that

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
proper nutrients each day and doing that

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.250 
proper nutrients each day and doing that
and<00:00:46.559> with<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.860> electrolytes<00:00:47.700> and<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.149> all<00:00:49.079> of

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
and with the electrolytes and the all of

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.510 
and with the electrolytes and the all of
the<00:00:49.350> nutrients<00:00:49.770> that<00:00:49.860> come<00:00:50.129> with<00:00:50.309> the

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
the nutrients that come with the

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.880 
the nutrients that come with the
different<00:00:50.879> products<00:00:51.239> my<00:00:51.469> recovery<00:00:52.469> time<00:00:52.710> is

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
different products my recovery time is

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.529 
different products my recovery time is
dramatically<00:00:53.579> less<00:00:53.879> it's<00:00:54.180> not<00:00:54.270> even<00:00:54.420> a<00:00:54.449> little

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
dramatically less it's not even a little

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.200 
dramatically less it's not even a little
bit<00:00:54.660> less<00:00:54.840> it's<00:00:55.020> dramatically<00:00:55.649> less<00:00:55.949> so<00:00:56.760> I<00:00:56.789> can

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
bit less it's dramatically less so I can

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.680 
bit less it's dramatically less so I can
go<00:00:57.300> out<00:00:57.329> on<00:00:57.600> a<00:00:57.829> and<00:00:58.829> now<00:00:58.859> I<00:00:59.100> can<00:00:59.520> hit<00:00:59.609> a<00:00:59.670> 20<00:01:00.270> 30

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
go out on a and now I can hit a 20 30

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.349 
go out on a and now I can hit a 20 30
mile<00:01:00.960> run<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.590> i'm<00:01:02.129> sore<00:01:02.579> for<00:01:02.699> maybe<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.090> day

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
mile run and i'm sore for maybe a day

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.710 
mile run and i'm sore for maybe a day
that's<00:01:04.320> it<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:04.799> if<00:01:05.189> I<00:01:05.519> kill<00:01:05.850> it<00:01:05.880> on<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.210> lawn<00:01:06.510> say

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
that's it and if I kill it on a lawn say

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.600 
that's it and if I kill it on a lawn say
a<00:01:06.750> marathon<00:01:07.229> I<00:01:07.470> might<00:01:07.799> be<00:01:07.920> sore<00:01:08.100> for<00:01:08.130> two<00:01:08.430> days

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
a marathon I might be sore for two days

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.490 
a marathon I might be sore for two days
so<00:01:08.939> if<00:01:09.000> i<00:01:09.060> go<00:01:09.090> out<00:01:09.210> really<00:01:09.510> powered<00:01:09.869> and<00:01:10.049> go<00:01:10.350> for

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
so if i go out really powered and go for

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.230 
so if i go out really powered and go for
time<00:01:10.710> it<00:01:11.010> might<00:01:11.340> take<00:01:11.490> me<00:01:11.610> two<00:01:11.729> days<00:01:11.880> recovered

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
time it might take me two days recovered

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.060 
time it might take me two days recovered
but<00:01:12.330> that's<00:01:12.510> it<00:01:12.659> then<00:01:12.900> i'm<00:01:12.990> running<00:01:13.229> again<00:01:13.470> so

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
but that's it then i'm running again so

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.450 
but that's it then i'm running again so
there<00:01:14.220> is<00:01:14.299> before<00:01:15.299> it<00:01:15.330> would<00:01:15.630> have<00:01:15.720> been<00:01:16.460> three

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
there is before it would have been three

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.760 
there is before it would have been three
four<00:01:17.759> five<00:01:18.030> seven<00:01:18.540> days<00:01:18.869> like<00:01:19.200> on<00:01:19.320> a<00:01:19.530> hard

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
four five seven days like on a hard

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:20.960 
four five seven days like on a hard
power<00:01:19.979> marathon<00:01:20.490> it<00:01:20.670> would<00:01:20.790> have<00:01:20.880> been

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
power marathon it would have been

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.580 
power marathon it would have been
potentially<00:01:21.270> seven<00:01:21.750> days<00:01:21.900> of<00:01:22.140> recovery

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
potentially seven days of recovery

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.740 
potentially seven days of recovery
before<00:01:23.490> i<00:01:23.670> was<00:01:23.850> feeling<00:01:24.119> like<00:01:24.210> running<00:01:24.509> again

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
before i was feeling like running again

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.200 
before i was feeling like running again
i<00:01:24.960> mix<00:01:25.770> all<00:01:26.009> of<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.310> products<00:01:26.880> together<00:01:27.000> i

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
i mix all of the products together i

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.410 
i mix all of the products together i
take<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.829> the<00:01:28.829> liquid<00:01:29.159> light<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.549> i<00:01:30.030> mix<00:01:30.240> that

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
take the the liquid light and i mix that

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.270 
take the the liquid light and i mix that
with<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.750> protein<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.560> new<00:01:31.680> protein<00:01:32.070> and

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
with the protein the new protein and

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.980 
with the protein the new protein and
then<00:01:32.939> I<00:01:32.970> do<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.150> barley<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:33.600> I<00:01:33.659> mix<00:01:33.840> them<00:01:33.900> all

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
then I do the barley and I mix them all
