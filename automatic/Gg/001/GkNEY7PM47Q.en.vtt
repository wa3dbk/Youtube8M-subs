sy<00:00:16.049> Nisshin<00:00:16.500> i'm<00:00:16.770> using<00:00:17.310> chicken<00:00:17.490> why<00:00:17.820> because

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
sy Nisshin i'm using chicken why because

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:24.080 
sy Nisshin i'm using chicken why because
it<00:00:18.270> will<00:00:18.510> achieve<00:00:19.020> this<00:00:19.230> a<00:00:20.000> tub<00:00:21.000> but<00:00:22.760> it<00:00:23.760> can<00:00:23.939> be

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
it will achieve this a tub but it can be

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.900 
it will achieve this a tub but it can be
plastic<00:00:25.400> from<00:00:26.449> glass<00:00:28.580> practicing<00:00:29.580> fruit

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
plastic from glass practicing fruit

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.110 
plastic from glass practicing fruit
because<00:00:30.539> then<00:00:30.810> they<00:00:31.320> can<00:00:31.349> get<00:00:31.920> any<00:00:32.099> Z<00:00:32.309> or<00:00:33.030> you

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
because then they can get any Z or you

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.729 
because then they can get any Z or you
can<00:00:33.270> give<00:00:33.420> polystyrene<00:00:34.260> if<00:00:34.380> you<00:00:34.500> really

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
can give polystyrene if you really

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.170 
can give polystyrene if you really
wanted<00:00:34.980> to<00:00:35.040> so<00:00:35.700> I<00:00:35.760> can<00:00:36.030> see<00:00:36.239> in<00:00:37.940> the<00:00:38.940> water

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
where the moves on squeezing if water

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.670 
where the moves on squeezing if water
comes<00:03:04.540> out<00:03:04.900> of<00:03:05.080> it<00:03:05.260> means<00:03:05.950> it's<00:03:06.130> too<00:03:06.340> wet<00:03:06.580> so

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
comes out of it means it's too wet so

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.800 
comes out of it means it's too wet so
you'll<00:03:08.680> have<00:03:08.890> to<00:03:08.950> make<00:03:09.310> it<00:03:09.580> will<00:03:10.150> add<00:03:10.450> more

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
you'll have to make it will add more

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.960 
you'll have to make it will add more
substrate<00:03:11.290> in<00:03:12.570> let's<00:03:13.570> make<00:03:13.720> you<00:03:14.430> sweat<00:03:15.430> so

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
substrate in let's make you sweat so

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.340 
substrate in let's make you sweat so
yeah<00:03:16.630> obviously<00:03:18.209> so<00:03:19.209> I<00:03:19.239> cube<00:03:19.630> got<00:03:19.810> the<00:03:19.900> eggs<00:03:20.079> in
