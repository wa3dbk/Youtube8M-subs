00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
arms at all probably it's been awhile if

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.230 
arms at all probably it's been awhile if
not<00:00:06.960> never<00:00:07.379> but<00:00:08.160> I<00:00:08.400> want<00:00:08.760> you<00:00:08.849> to<00:00:08.970> give<00:00:09.090> it<00:00:09.179> a

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
try in a safe way of course or even

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.419 
try in a safe way of course or even
think<00:00:12.750> about<00:00:12.990> how<00:00:13.410> it<00:00:13.530> would<00:00:13.559> feel<00:00:13.799> to<00:00:13.860> sprint

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
think about how it would feel to sprint

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:15.980 
think about how it would feel to sprint
without<00:00:14.730> using<00:00:15.089> your<00:00:15.210> arms<00:00:15.480> at<00:00:15.660> all<00:00:15.750> it's<00:00:15.900> the

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:47.980 

I<00:00:45.790> remember<00:00:46.790> having<00:00:46.910> a<00:00:47.150> debate<00:00:47.390> one<00:00:47.630> day<00:00:47.810> with

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:47.990 
I remember having a debate one day with

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:51.010 
I remember having a debate one day with
a<00:00:48.020> pro<00:00:48.230> hockey<00:00:48.410> player<00:00:48.830> about<00:00:49.250> which<00:00:49.880> arm<00:00:50.240> goes

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.020 
a pro hockey player about which arm goes

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.390 
a pro hockey player about which arm goes
with<00:00:51.290> which<00:00:51.530> leg<00:00:51.860> when<00:00:52.340> you're<00:00:52.490> skating<00:00:53.230> so<00:00:54.400> he

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:55.400 
with which leg when you're skating so he

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.450 
with which leg when you're skating so he
was<00:00:55.580> saying<00:00:55.910> kind<00:00:56.750> of<00:00:56.900> the<00:00:56.990> same<00:00:57.290> arm<00:00:57.950> in<00:00:58.340> the

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
was saying kind of the same arm in the

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.610 
was saying kind of the same arm in the
same<00:00:58.700> leg<00:00:59.030> and<00:00:59.300> if<00:00:59.630> you<00:00:59.750> try<00:00:59.990> that<00:01:00.020> on<00:01:00.230> the<00:01:00.500> ice

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
same leg and if you try that on the ice

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.740 
same leg and if you try that on the ice
you're<00:01:00.860> probably<00:01:01.010> gonna<00:01:01.220> fall<00:01:01.490> down<00:01:01.750> because

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
you're probably gonna fall down because

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.600 
you're probably gonna fall down because
it's<00:01:02.930> just<00:01:03.080> the<00:01:03.230> same<00:01:03.470> as<00:01:03.500> walking<00:01:04.130> you<00:01:04.460> know

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
it's just the same as walking you know

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.270 
it's just the same as walking you know
we<00:01:04.790> stride<00:01:05.210> my<00:01:05.780> right<00:01:06.020> leg<00:01:06.230> comes<00:01:06.500> forward<00:01:06.560> as

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
we stride my right leg comes forward as

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.730 
we stride my right leg comes forward as
my<00:01:07.580> left<00:01:07.790> arm<00:01:08.030> comes<00:01:08.240> forward<00:01:08.630> and<00:01:09.080> my<00:01:09.530> right

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
my left arm comes forward and my right

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.580 
my left arm comes forward and my right
arm<00:01:09.770> comes<00:01:10.220> back<00:01:10.660> in<00:01:11.660> skating<00:01:12.080> it's<00:01:12.260> the<00:01:12.380> same

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
arm comes back in skating it's the same

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.100 
arm comes back in skating it's the same
thing<00:01:12.830> I'm<00:01:13.010> driving<00:01:13.760> off<00:01:13.940> my<00:01:14.180> left<00:01:14.420> glute<00:01:14.570> and

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
thing I'm driving off my left glute and

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.790 
thing I'm driving off my left glute and
I'm<00:01:16.040> driving<00:01:16.580> my<00:01:17.540> left<00:01:17.810> arm<00:01:18.050> forward<00:01:18.410> as<00:01:18.619> my

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:18.800 
I'm driving my left arm forward as my

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.210 
I'm driving my left arm forward as my
right<00:01:19.070> goes<00:01:19.820> back<00:01:20.150> so<00:01:20.420> it's<00:01:20.570> opposite<00:01:21.410> chain

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
right goes back so it's opposite chain

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.350 
right goes back so it's opposite chain
and<00:01:23.200> so<00:01:24.200> this<00:01:24.410> is<00:01:24.590> how<00:01:24.800> your<00:01:25.460> mid-back<00:01:25.880> and

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
and so this is how your mid-back and

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:27.910 
and so this is how your mid-back and
having<00:01:26.570> a<00:01:26.630> nice<00:01:26.780> strong<00:01:27.170> mid-back<00:01:27.680> and

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
having a nice strong mid-back and

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.620 
having a nice strong mid-back and
actually<00:01:28.310> improve<00:01:28.640> your<00:01:28.670> skating<00:01:29.180> speed

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
actually improve your skating speed

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.690 
actually improve your skating speed
because<00:01:30.259> we're<00:01:30.410> actually<00:01:30.590> using<00:01:31.009> our<00:01:31.250> muscles

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
because we're actually using our muscles

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.609 
because we're actually using our muscles
we're<00:01:31.850> using<00:01:32.090> a<00:01:32.150> chain<00:01:32.450> of<00:01:32.479> muscles<00:01:33.050> so<00:01:33.229> here

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
we're using a chain of muscles so here

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:35.650 
we're using a chain of muscles so here
from<00:01:34.160> our<00:01:34.310> lats<00:01:34.580> that<00:01:35.210> come<00:01:35.390> into<00:01:35.570> a

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:35.660 
from our lats that come into a

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.410 
from our lats that come into a
connective<00:01:36.200> tissue<00:01:36.229> sheath<00:01:36.920> linking<00:01:37.850> right

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
connective tissue sheath linking right

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.240 
connective tissue sheath linking right
into<00:01:38.690> our<00:01:38.720> glutes<00:01:39.080> and<00:01:39.290> that's<00:01:39.440> a<00:01:39.619> functional

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
into our glutes and that's a functional

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.540 
into our glutes and that's a functional
chain<00:01:40.520> so<00:01:41.060> that's<00:01:41.570> exactly<00:01:42.259> why<00:01:42.470> we<00:01:43.220> want<00:01:43.250> to

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.550 
chain so that's exactly why we want to

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.580 
chain so that's exactly why we want to
drive<00:01:44.000> this<00:01:44.390> back<00:01:44.690> so<00:01:44.960> we're<00:01:45.110> contracting

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
drive this back so we're contracting

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.190 
drive this back so we're contracting
here<00:01:46.100> we're<00:01:46.250> creating<00:01:46.370> tension<00:01:47.240> here<00:01:47.540> we're

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
here we're creating tension here we're

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.350 
here we're creating tension here we're
creating<00:01:48.350> tension<00:01:49.159> here<00:01:49.430> so<00:01:49.880> we're<00:01:50.060> pulling

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
creating tension here so we're pulling

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.070 
creating tension here so we're pulling
from<00:01:50.690> both<00:01:51.020> ends<00:01:51.470> and<00:01:51.980> then<00:01:52.520> even<00:01:52.820> when<00:01:53.080> we

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
from both ends and then even when we

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.410 
from both ends and then even when we
drive<00:01:54.440> with<00:01:54.650> our<00:01:54.800> other<00:01:54.980> arm<00:01:55.250> so<00:01:55.310> this<00:01:55.760> arm<00:01:56.120> now

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
drive with our other arm so this arm now

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.960 
drive with our other arm so this arm now
I'm<00:01:56.870> driving<00:01:57.710> my<00:01:57.830> left<00:01:58.100> arm<00:01:58.370> forward<00:01:58.729> I'm

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
I'm driving my left arm forward I'm

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.390 
I'm driving my left arm forward I'm
putting<00:01:59.540> a<00:01:59.630> stretch<00:02:00.020> from<00:02:00.740> this<00:02:01.010> glute

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:01.400 
putting a stretch from this glute

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.910 
putting a stretch from this glute
through<00:02:02.090> the<00:02:02.240> connective<00:02:02.690> tissue<00:02:02.930> right<00:02:03.740> up

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
through the connective tissue right up

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.510 
through the connective tissue right up
through<00:02:04.220> that<00:02:04.250> lat<00:02:04.729> so<00:02:05.180> what<00:02:05.390> happens<00:02:06.370> when<00:02:07.370> we

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
through that lat so what happens when we

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.790 
through that lat so what happens when we
put<00:02:07.729> a<00:02:07.760> muscle<00:02:08.179> on<00:02:08.300> a<00:02:08.360> stretch<00:02:08.899> muscle<00:02:09.410> has<00:02:09.590> an

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
put a muscle on a stretch muscle has an

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.530 
put a muscle on a stretch muscle has an
elastic<00:02:10.369> component<00:02:10.880> so<00:02:11.000> if<00:02:11.090> I<00:02:11.209> take<00:02:11.390> an

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
elastic component so if I take an

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.229 
elastic component so if I take an
elastic<00:02:11.810> and<00:02:12.230> I<00:02:12.709> stretch<00:02:13.070> it<00:02:13.100> what<00:02:13.790> and<00:02:14.000> then<00:02:14.209> I

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
elastic and I stretch it what and then I

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:16.210 
elastic and I stretch it what and then I
let<00:02:14.540> it<00:02:14.570> go<00:02:14.780> what<00:02:14.989> does<00:02:15.170> it<00:02:15.290> want<00:02:15.410> to<00:02:15.560> do<00:02:15.739> it

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
let it go what does it want to do it

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.370 
let it go what does it want to do it
immediately<00:02:16.310> wants<00:02:17.120> to<00:02:17.239> shorten<00:02:17.690> so<00:02:18.230> when<00:02:18.350> I

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
immediately wants to shorten so when I

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.789 
immediately wants to shorten so when I
take<00:02:18.650> a<00:02:18.680> stride<00:02:19.130> and<00:02:19.400> I<00:02:19.489> wind<00:02:19.850> up<00:02:20.180> this<00:02:20.930> elastic

00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:21.799 
take a stride and I wind up this elastic

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:24.100 
take a stride and I wind up this elastic
and<00:02:22.010> then<00:02:22.549> when<00:02:22.790> I<00:02:22.820> go<00:02:23.120> to<00:02:23.180> load<00:02:23.480> it<00:02:23.660> it<00:02:23.780> wants

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
and then when I go to load it it wants

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.860 
and then when I go to load it it wants
to<00:02:24.260> shorten<00:02:24.769> so<00:02:24.950> I<00:02:25.010> get<00:02:25.220> a<00:02:25.250> little<00:02:25.519> extra<00:02:26.120> boost

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
to shorten so I get a little extra boost

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.020 
to shorten so I get a little extra boost
I've<00:02:27.200> loaded<00:02:27.620> the<00:02:27.830> system<00:02:28.430> and<00:02:28.640> then<00:02:29.000> I

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
I've loaded the system and then I

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.590 
I've loaded the system and then I
slingshot<00:02:29.840> a<00:02:30.080> little<00:02:30.650> bit<00:02:30.799> so<00:02:31.450> think<00:02:32.450> about

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
slingshot a little bit so think about

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.560 
slingshot a little bit so think about
using<00:02:33.530> your<00:02:33.799> arms<00:02:34.190> aggressively<00:02:34.910> when<00:02:35.420> you're

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
using your arms aggressively when you're

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.470 
using your arms aggressively when you're
fatigued<00:02:36.100> it<00:02:37.100> can<00:02:37.280> help<00:02:37.549> put<00:02:37.850> a<00:02:37.880> little<00:02:38.120> extra

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
fatigued it can help put a little extra

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.820 
fatigued it can help put a little extra
speed<00:02:38.959> in<00:02:39.170> your<00:02:39.200> step

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
speed in your step

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.740 
speed in your step
even<00:02:40.280> in<00:02:40.400> our<00:02:40.519> off<00:02:40.760> ice<00:02:41.030> training<00:02:41.510> when<00:02:41.630> we're

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
even in our off ice training when we're

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.690 
even in our off ice training when we're
doing<00:02:41.840> those<00:02:42.080> brutal<00:02:42.590> hill<00:02:43.040> runs<00:02:43.280> that<00:02:43.489> we<00:02:43.580> do

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
doing those brutal hill runs that we do

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.580 
doing those brutal hill runs that we do
every<00:02:43.940> Saturday<00:02:44.120> morning<00:02:44.420> with<00:02:44.870> with<00:02:45.410> our

every Saturday morning with with our
hockey<00:02:45.830> strong<00:02:46.310> athletes<00:02:46.850> you<00:02:47.269> know<00:02:47.390> when

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
hockey strong athletes you know when

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.509 
hockey strong athletes you know when
they're<00:02:47.600> getting<00:02:47.750> dog-tired<00:02:48.440> the<00:02:49.010> cue<00:02:49.310> is

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
they're getting dog-tired the cue is

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:52.480 
they're getting dog-tired the cue is
always<00:02:50.240> drive<00:02:50.660> those<00:02:50.959> arms<00:02:51.440> drive<00:02:51.770> those<00:02:52.010> arms

always drive those arms drive those arms

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:54.699 
always drive those arms drive those arms
number<00:02:53.090> one<00:02:53.300> it<00:02:53.480> helps<00:02:53.599> you<00:02:53.840> keep<00:02:54.020> your<00:02:54.200> tempo

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
number one it helps you keep your tempo

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:55.620 
number one it helps you keep your tempo
up<00:02:54.890> when<00:02:55.340> I'm

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
up when I'm

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.440 
up when I'm
-<00:02:55.780> it<00:02:55.930> can<00:02:56.080> help<00:02:56.290> put<00:02:56.830> a<00:02:56.860> little<00:02:57.160> more<00:02:57.460> power

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
- it can help put a little more power

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.750 
- it can help put a little more power
into<00:02:58.900> the<00:02:59.230> system

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.820 

so<00:03:03.480> when<00:03:03.599> you<00:03:03.690> do<00:03:03.840> your<00:03:03.989> incline<00:03:04.349> plank<00:03:04.680> and

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
so when you do your incline plank and

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.619 
so when you do your incline plank and
roll<00:03:05.040> this<00:03:05.280> can<00:03:05.489> be<00:03:05.610> anything<00:03:05.940> this<00:03:06.269> could<00:03:06.450> be

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:06.629 
roll this can be anything this could be

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:10.369 
roll this can be anything this could be
a<00:03:06.659> chair<00:03:07.590> a<00:03:08.129> step<00:03:09.090> in<00:03:09.239> your<00:03:09.390> house<00:03:09.599> whatever

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:10.379 
a chair a step in your house whatever

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:13.460 
a chair a step in your house whatever
you<00:03:10.650> have<00:03:10.830> available<00:03:12.170> and<00:03:13.170> you're<00:03:13.319> going<00:03:13.440> to

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
you have available and you're going to

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.550 
you have available and you're going to
hold<00:03:13.620> that<00:03:13.830> nice<00:03:14.069> plank<00:03:14.459> position<00:03:15.030> and<00:03:15.560> then

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
hold that nice plank position and then

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.330 
hold that nice plank position and then
do<00:03:17.030> your<00:03:18.030> single<00:03:18.480> arm<00:03:18.629> row<00:03:18.930> again<00:03:19.650> keeping

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
do your single arm row again keeping

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.759 
do your single arm row again keeping
your<00:03:20.489> hips<00:03:20.670> and<00:03:20.910> shoulders<00:03:21.360> everything<00:03:22.200> nice

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
your hips and shoulders everything nice

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:25.039 
your hips and shoulders everything nice
and<00:03:23.010> stable<00:03:23.400> this<00:03:23.730> is<00:03:23.790> a<00:03:23.940> contra<00:03:24.450> dumbbell<00:03:24.810> row

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
and stable this is a contra dumbbell row

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:27.470 
and stable this is a contra dumbbell row
so<00:03:25.709> we're<00:03:26.430> kind<00:03:26.640> of<00:03:26.730> going<00:03:26.879> into<00:03:27.150> our

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
so we're kind of going into our

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.780 
so we're kind of going into our
conscious<00:03:28.349> stiff-legged<00:03:28.769> deadlift<00:03:29.220> position

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
conscious stiff-legged deadlift position

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.580 
conscious stiff-legged deadlift position
but<00:03:30.720> then<00:03:30.840> here<00:03:31.790> I'm<00:03:32.790> gonna<00:03:32.970> row<00:03:33.209> and<00:03:34.019> while<00:03:34.560> I

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
but then here I'm gonna row and while I

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.949 
but then here I'm gonna row and while I
roll<00:03:34.980> I'm<00:03:35.819> squeezing<00:03:36.299> that<00:03:36.510> shoulder<00:03:36.840> blade

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
roll I'm squeezing that shoulder blade

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:41.479 
roll I'm squeezing that shoulder blade
back<00:03:37.349> and<00:03:37.790> down<00:03:38.790> slightly<00:03:39.680> using<00:03:40.680> my<00:03:40.950> bicep

pulling our elbows back if you do this

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:58.450 
pulling our elbows back if you do this
on<00:05:56.660> a<00:05:56.690> power<00:05:56.990> act<00:05:57.260> like<00:05:57.440> I'm<00:05:57.590> doing<00:05:57.860> it<00:05:57.980> just

00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:58.460 
on a power act like I'm doing it just

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.570 
on a power act like I'm doing it just
make<00:05:58.610> sure<00:05:58.880> that<00:05:59.210> the<00:05:59.630> bar<00:05:59.900> is<00:06:00.710> pulling<00:06:01.250> into

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:01.580 
make sure that the bar is pulling into

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:03.550 
make sure that the bar is pulling into
the<00:06:01.940> power<00:06:02.150> rack<00:06:02.450> I<00:06:02.690> wouldn't<00:06:03.200> want<00:06:03.320> to<00:06:03.410> do<00:06:03.530> it

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:03.560 
the power rack I wouldn't want to do it

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.260 
the power rack I wouldn't want to do it
the<00:06:03.770> other<00:06:03.920> way<00:06:04.130> with<00:06:04.340> my<00:06:04.490> feet<00:06:04.790> the<00:06:04.940> other<00:06:05.060> way

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:05.270 
the other way with my feet the other way

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:06.940 
the other way with my feet the other way
because<00:06:05.810> there<00:06:05.930> is<00:06:06.020> a<00:06:06.050> chance<00:06:06.320> I<00:06:06.530> could<00:06:06.590> pull

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:06.950 
because there is a chance I could pull

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:09.190 
because there is a chance I could pull
the<00:06:07.160> bar<00:06:07.370> out<00:06:07.880> of<00:06:08.090> these<00:06:08.360> safety<00:06:08.630> hooks<00:06:09.020> and

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:09.200 
the bar out of these safety hooks and

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.800 
the bar out of these safety hooks and
then<00:06:09.350> I<00:06:09.590> would<00:06:10.400> land<00:06:10.580> up<00:06:10.760> in<00:06:10.880> a<00:06:10.970> heap<00:06:11.210> with<00:06:11.690> the

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:11.810 
then I would land up in a heap with the

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:13.480 
then I would land up in a heap with the
bar<00:06:11.960> on<00:06:12.080> top<00:06:12.320> of<00:06:12.500> me<00:06:12.620> so<00:06:13.040> we<00:06:13.160> don't<00:06:13.250> want<00:06:13.430> that

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:13.490 
bar on top of me so we don't want that

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:15.850 
bar on top of me so we don't want that
safety<00:06:14.030> first<00:06:14.270> always<00:06:14.540> so<00:06:15.380> I<00:06:15.410> hope<00:06:15.560> that<00:06:15.740> gives

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:15.860 
safety first always so I hope that gives

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:17.650 
safety first always so I hope that gives
you<00:06:16.010> a<00:06:16.070> little<00:06:16.280> better<00:06:16.490> appreciation<00:06:17.360> of<00:06:17.480> how
