Dave + KuKu Crew, Delicious Way to eat watermelon

00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.280
Hello! I'm Dave and I want to eat watermelon~

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.320
Today we will be showing you a delicious way to eat watermelon!

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.780
I saw a lot of foreigners do this on youtube

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.640
and so I wanted to try it once too...

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.660
I couldn't help myself.. (play on Korean word for watermelon

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.180
Seriously, go back home

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.540
If we do this we might die

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:21.680
As you know, this room is very narrow

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.160
If we do it like this, Dave's face will get messed up

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.740
Your brains will gush out wildly

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.800
Ah, not that much..

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.220
Do you know pituitary gland???

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:29.520
Stop making this scary T__T

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.000
Ah, scaryyy lol

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.520
Do you know what Park Myeong Su is in English?

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:34.200
..Park Myeong Su??

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.820
Great Park? Isn't it written like this?

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.240
Myeong Su Park. (another play on the Korean word for watermelon. Su Bak is Korean for watermelon, which sounds like the name Bak Myeong Su.)

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.380
A delicious way to eat watermelon.

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:45.140

Are we doing something wrong??

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.200
Let's say four letter proverbs?? (Phrases in Korean that are four syllables long and originate in Chinese.)

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.140
Does it seem like I know more than you???

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:38.540
