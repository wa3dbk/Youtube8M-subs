00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.210

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.400
 German team naturally thumbs 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.630
 pressed for more games 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.400
 that is a pity otherwise go 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.200
 Of course we do our best then 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.840
 German driving is still allowed to experience 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.220

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.020

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:40.880
 referee and her everyday life at the 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.880
 World Cup in Qatar before 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.970
 get up early breakfast at 38 9 o'clock 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.230
 begins the meeting and again the 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.940
 Player of the past day 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.530
 be awarded with video scenes 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.480
 analyze all the trimmings 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.940
 then there are the settings for the 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.940
 current day and after that 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.450
 an absolute he knows I work 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.310
 that you really that top top event one 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.330
 world championship of men as well as 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.310
 Olympic Games and 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.740
 european championship of men for us 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.990
 is that something special 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.670
 So we are so happy and happy 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.820
 German referee represented here 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.820
 to be allowed 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.380
 So it is normal that the games 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.440
 from the day before 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:41.770
 each member of the 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.420
 commission of commission 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.800
 there is a game to it because the 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.020
 corresponding clips of the delicate ones 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:50.620
 scenes and then you discuss in the 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.630
 Auditorium therefore be like the line 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:54.100
 Should that be a good decision 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.560
 bad decision was why why 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.960
 why yes I already have some 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.210
 situations that we also have now 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.580
 were allowed to watch our video wall 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.410
 Do you think you make mistakes in every game? 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:09.960
 Of course he also sees them together 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.960
 be spoken and completely normal 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:22.250
 So the yellow card the red cards 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.690
 I am relaxed ten years old 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.060
 then brought and we have until today 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.130
 their service fails and that's why 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.530
 we are still here and now 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.360
 This brand is wonderful 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.030
 actually since the start of the career so to speak 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.300
 mine and has many good services 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.300
 done 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.900
 I'm sure I already have this loose 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.620
 5 609 thrown the air is the goal 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.090
 of course now at one 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.170
 World Cup as good as possible 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.270
 doubt as much as possible 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.390
 or inconspicuous and 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:52.250
 Of course, our goal is itself 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.470
 for the olympic games in Rio too 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.710
 qualify that is for us that 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:03:01.150
 the highest point is our wish 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:01.150
 of course a lot of success
