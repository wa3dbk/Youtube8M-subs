down before I finish the port so no and

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.410 
down before I finish the port so no and
then<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.800> other<00:00:44.040> thing<00:00:44.340> is<00:00:44.370> I<00:00:44.550> wasn't<00:00:45.000> sure<00:00:45.649> if

there<00:00:48.420> was<00:00:48.629> enough<00:00:48.989> in<00:00:49.230> that<00:00:49.289> I<00:00:50.039> had<00:00:50.280> mixed<00:00:50.550> up

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
there was enough in that I had mixed up

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.459

enough<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:51.210> half<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.629> batch<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:51.809> get<00:00:52.140> this<00:00:52.260> full

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
enough a half a batch to get this full

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.229 
enough a half a batch to get this full
tank<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:52.829> if<00:00:53.340> you<00:00:53.430> see<00:00:53.640> there<00:00:53.850> you<00:00:53.879> can<00:00:54.000> see

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
tank and if you see there you can see

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.819 
tank and if you see there you can see
almost<00:00:54.390> what<00:00:54.600> looks<00:00:54.750> like<00:00:54.809> rain<00:00:55.230> running<00:00:55.649> down

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
and file and sand them down smooth but

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.530 
and file and sand them down smooth but
that's<00:01:59.850> pretty<00:02:00.030> much<00:02:00.149> it

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
that's pretty much it

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.139 
that's pretty much it
besides<00:02:01.200> that<00:02:01.439> that<00:02:01.619> one<00:02:02.369> little<00:02:02.579> issue<00:02:02.759> with

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
besides that that one little issue with

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.660 
besides that that one little issue with
where<00:02:04.140> appears<00:02:04.530> it<00:02:04.799> didn't<00:02:05.100> quite<00:02:05.310> get<00:02:05.490> in

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
where appears it didn't quite get in

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:12.960 
where appears it didn't quite get in
there<00:02:05.880> I<00:02:06.030> really<00:02:06.659> think<00:02:06.869> that<00:02:06.930> that<00:02:07.259> has<00:02:07.590> to<00:02:07.619> do

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.000 

and<00:02:13.970> it<00:02:14.780> might<00:02:15.020> have<00:02:15.140> been<00:02:15.170> a<00:02:15.290> little<00:02:15.560> too<00:02:15.740> cold

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
and it might have been a little too cold

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.600 
and it might have been a little too cold
even<00:02:16.400> though<00:02:16.430> I<00:02:16.550> did<00:02:16.820> use<00:02:17.000> as<00:02:17.180> I<00:02:17.360> law<00:02:17.570> like

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
even though I did use as I law like

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.920 
even though I did use as I law like
manufacturer<00:02:19.610> recommended<00:02:20.240> to<00:02:20.420> thin<00:02:20.660> it<00:02:20.810> out

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
manufacturer recommended to thin it out

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.440 
manufacturer recommended to thin it out
I<00:02:21.230> use<00:02:22.160> the<00:02:22.280> maximum<00:02:22.610> amount<00:02:22.910> and<00:02:23.120> it<00:02:23.180> still

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
I use the maximum amount and it still

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.520 
I use the maximum amount and it still
didn't<00:02:23.780> seem<00:02:23.870> thin<00:02:24.320> enough<00:02:24.620> so<00:02:26.380> I'm<00:02:27.380> gonna

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
didn't seem thin enough so I'm gonna

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.620 
didn't seem thin enough so I'm gonna
chalk<00:02:27.770> that<00:02:27.830> up<00:02:28.100> too<00:02:28.520> if<00:02:28.940> maybe<00:02:29.210> it's<00:02:29.390> a<00:02:29.450> little

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
chalk that up too if maybe it's a little

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.330 
chalk that up too if maybe it's a little
bit<00:02:29.750> bigger<00:02:29.930> tank<00:02:30.260> and<00:02:30.500> maybe<00:02:30.860> cuz<00:02:31.100> all<00:02:31.310> the

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
bit bigger tank and maybe cuz all the

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.670 
bit bigger tank and maybe cuz all the
crazy<00:02:31.670> shapes<00:02:32.090> in<00:02:32.330> it<00:02:32.480> it<00:02:32.990> needed<00:02:33.380> just<00:02:33.500> a

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
crazy shapes in it it needed just a

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.330 
crazy shapes in it it needed just a
little<00:02:33.710> more<00:02:34.130> casual<00:02:34.580> so<00:02:35.020> if<00:02:36.020> I<00:02:36.230> were<00:02:36.410> you<00:02:36.620> I

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
little more casual so if I were you I

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.080 
little more casual so if I were you I
would<00:02:37.910> go<00:02:38.060> ahead<00:02:38.180> and<00:02:38.750> and<00:02:39.560> do<00:02:40.070> it<00:02:40.190> once<00:02:40.430> and

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
would go ahead and and do it once and

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.240 
would go ahead and and do it once and
then<00:02:41.150> see<00:02:41.900> if<00:02:41.960> we<00:02:42.080> missed<00:02:42.290> any<00:02:42.470> areas<00:02:42.980> try<00:02:43.190> to

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
then see if we missed any areas try to

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:44.890 
then see if we missed any areas try to
get<00:02:43.400> as<00:02:43.520> thin<00:02:43.730> as<00:02:43.850> possible<00:02:43.880> for<00:02:44.390> this<00:02:44.510> Ducati

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:50.440 
get as thin as possible for this Ducati
tank<00:02:45.230> and<00:02:45.440> then<00:02:46.300> go<00:02:47.300> ahead<00:02:47.450> and<00:02:49.240> hit<00:02:50.240> it<00:02:50.360> again

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
tank and then go ahead and hit it again
