00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:11.329

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:14.150

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.439

 pre-order lion cast de as you can see 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:22.250
 ever a few specifications the 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:24.019
 keyboard is pretty well processed 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.699
 I have to say I have that short 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:27.829
 Tried so the keys are very 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:29.300
 grippy thanks gumming it clatters 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:30.949
 not so it is not a loud one 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.480
 mechanical keyboard some stand yes 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:35.149
 I rather do not have to say that 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:39.379
 there are no sharp edges everything is 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:42.770
 nice and round you called you still see 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:44.480
 all in detail, all are still touching 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.190
 inconspicuously gray but that will be soon 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.559
 change because you can do it all 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.239
 a bit individualize a driver 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:51.590
 cd is also there you can then 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:54.079
 for example, settings for games 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.550
 make or even lighting yes on 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:56.059
 I'm coming to the lighting now 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.269
 speak 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:00.980
 you see at the moment has white light and it 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:02.120
 is still a led tube that fades 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.500
 now unfortunately a bit I have that 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.820
 also have to stress all over because mine 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.620
 camcorder is not the best we have 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.030
 the record button for the macros one 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.610
 gaming button the windows button 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.350
 turns off a lighting button with 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:16.010
 he just change the light quickly 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.870
 can and if it is very loud or loud 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.070
 be quiet or you can be good 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.140
 do that with these buttons 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.790
 yes it is not nice as gamer needs 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.410
 it sometimes happens when the girlfriend 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.350
 or the mother calls and wants something 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:29.780
 then you have the gamblers and Jewish yes 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.880
 Here you can still see the lighting 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.760
 her wonderful change with the driver cd 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.220
 could do it up to 16 million times 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.110
 because this color combination is possible 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.330
 You can also use the fluorescent tube 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.610
 set individual or even one 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.360
 the theme that other flashes all the colors 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.690
 through changes 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.740
 if he gets up so i have to tell myself 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.470
 like the keyboard 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.360
 the cost is 60 euro is a bit 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.220
 but the quality makes it happy again 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.200
 I find the other one ever gone 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.270
 the lk 30 had imagined what to believe 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.500
 I I've currently still here 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.470
 I really use those too 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.570
 and it 's a cherry keyboard very much 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.690
 very nice switches on everyone 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.740
 If yes macros you can program 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.590
 to gamble you can type in the 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.780
 a set up to 31 characters so too 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.280
 whole set can tap her one and 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.620
 which raushauen for example in chats 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.850
 if you do not play as a game now 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.280
 I have the bottle on the top right 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.660
 censored and my trash could that 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.220
 I in the video and is also no calls 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.760
 placement understand names on it 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.770
 you do not have to see that on everyone 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.340
 case yes, the keyboard I can 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.030
 recommend 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.110
 as far as I am there as halfway 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.310
 Skilled knowledge is allowed on everyone 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.620
 case, I hope you a little bit now 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.620
 informs thanks for seeing and title
