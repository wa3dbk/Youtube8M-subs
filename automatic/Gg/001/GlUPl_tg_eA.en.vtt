 Attention to see a small 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.420
 video review smartphone mikro max a 114 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:17.039
 let's start a little bit as always 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.750
 let's talk about the exterior design of the device 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.939
 the device is no different from others 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.119
 smartphones but as if present 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.609
 some nuances let's start on the left 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.460
 the edges of the smartphone will be installed 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.189
 power button of the device on the right side 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.070
 volume rocker plus or minus bottom 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.320
 microphone top standard mini jack 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.500
 for headphones and ralf micro 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.120
 usb to connect the computer on the back 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.980
 panel covers we see 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.079
 8 megapixel main camera 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.559
 flash optional microphone or 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:52.230
 squelch I did not find out such 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:56.010
 logo fist micromax just below the inscription 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.050
 micromax and two speaker sockets 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.149
 not just two connectors two speakers 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.390

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.619
 Here is the nuance of the button, the power of the device and 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.840
 volume rocker keeps on itself 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:19.710

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.810

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.909

 the rest of the software 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:03:01.130

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:04.299

 here is really 8 megapixels 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:07.480
 since no one is so visible here 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.740
 said more pixels attending or 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:13.150

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:19.949
 You can watch the smartphone yourself 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:22.430
 Well, you can put a flash drive and add 

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:24.810
