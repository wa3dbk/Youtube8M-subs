00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:12.540
 Speak personal beauty coming back here with 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.630
 another video and this time bringing 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:19.710
 you an informative video about 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:22.439
 gta5 no I'm not going to talk about the game 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.470
 I'm going to talk about what can and what not 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:28.230
 can be posted as soon as the game has been 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.300
 released reminding staff that this 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.640
 material that I'm going to read to you is that 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.820
 I 'll explain to you, it 's in the 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.550
 Rockstar's own website where a 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.370
 answered a user and 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.469
 also took advantage and explained everything 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.739
 who can and can not respect your 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:50.010
 games and also especially on gta5 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.930
 and I'll leave it here in the description then 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.629
 it's a thing my head is own 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.059
 rockstar manifesting about 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.000
 so it's a person asked for 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:03.629
 american rockstar supporter i can 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.590
 post pictures the game place of games 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:10.560
 rockstar and she said yes you can 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:14.670
 one of the things that can no longer face 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:17.520
 you can not use game images or 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:21.509
 game place for you to sell something 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:25.650
 your business purposes, ie you 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:27.299
 puts there a gameplay of gta5 and in it 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.909
 You speak, look, the people I am. 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.340
 selling a gta5 t- shirt with the name 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.790
 from my channel this is forbidden 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:38.460
 rockstar does not allow you to use 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:40.619
 her videos for commercial purposes 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.439
 and then the next question that is more 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:46.290
 interesting and is that I think it's more 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.829
 interesting for you and I can 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:52.649
 betting gameplay after the game is released 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:55.140
 and the response was very obvious and objective 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:58.799
 they answer the following it is clear that 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:01.560
 you can post since it's you not 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:04.979
 for commercial purposes and provided that you 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.200
 do not post katz sines alone or 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.929
 soundtrack isolated 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.900
 good is what that means you 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.770
 You will not be able to get a cinema daycare. 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.230
 only the cassini 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:19.020
 and put on your channel and monetize it 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.930
 will strike because why 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:24.390
 besides giving a spoiler meaning you go 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.840
 is telling the person how it's going to be 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:30.500
 game you will be making money on 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.510
 top of a production quotation mark 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:36.660
 cinematic performed by rockstar 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:39.720
 then this can not and then they leave 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.760
 then what you can really and what 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.590
 are the requirements for you not to have 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.290
 copyright issues 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:49.320
 come on the first is something that they 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:52.860
 they say when the game is in 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:56.160
 pre-release if any image is 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:58.200
 leaked or if some gameplay 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.210
 some means of communication 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.150
 Of course if you post this on 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:05.250
 youtube or on any private site they 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.210
 will tear down the content and give you a 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.290
 strike 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:13.020
 that is you can not in any way 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.360
 get something exclusive for example 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.960
 the gt trailer as soon as you put it in your 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.880
 channel 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:21.990
 unless the rockstar herself has 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:24.780
 authorized you to do this and also 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:27.690
 you can not make a boxing 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:31.500
 game before the release 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:35.330
 ie if the release is x day you do not 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:39.300
 You can post the hamburg yes before the x 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:43.110
 second thing that can not is you do not 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:46.950
 can post isolated cassettes and 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:51.240
 isolated soundtrack ie you can not 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:54.570
 make a vlog with a song by gta5 tÃ¡ 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:57.360
 It is then that you can do you can 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:04:00.270
 make a game play in the form of play 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:02.760
 trio what is play true is when you 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:04.650
 is playing type 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.350
 People, I'll show you both. 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:10.170
 game time you start playing and 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:12.540
 max appears in the middle, no problem 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:15.540
 Why are you playing and are you? 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.340
 showing the game will put little children 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.609
 it's only strike 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:23.850
 I also advise that you in the letters 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:25.740
 sines can make a clear comment 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.570
 You do not have to keep talking like that. 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.850
 pay for it 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:31.250
 to the extent that the person does not understand the 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:33.920
 Cancini, it 's good that you do some 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:36.950
 comment so you can show that you 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:40.040
 is playing or is what a lawsuit is 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:43.100
 really showing you inscribed procel 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:45.320
 the gameplay is clear so that it 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.130
 can understand he needs a day care 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.530
 sine 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:49.820
 so if you're going to do a series if 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:53.240
 you will do 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:56.000
 it's a half hour it's a game two hour 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:59.180
 hours of play you can since no 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.310
 have to have isolated trec 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:04.100
 You have to comment and be playing. 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:06.800
 to show the game the interest of the 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:09.050
 rockstar is that you show the game and not 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.240
 that you make money from the clip 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:14.450
 them with their trailer or with the 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:17.840
 their music there is a second thing that 

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:20.750
 they are going to release the leg of the launch 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:23.240
 according to this material, it is 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:26.570
 that they will not allow you to post 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:31.130
 the end of the game or you give a 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:34.100
 spoiler of the game until such day that day goes 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:37.370
 be announced by them on twitter or 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:40.130

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:43.220

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:46.190

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:50.240
 nor revealing game scenes can you 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:52.640
 play in the form of change law I said 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:56.000
 for you but can not in a way 

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:58.540
 some is to show the end of the game or 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.400
 show some revealing scene of the game 

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:06.830
 this applies to all games of the 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:11.000
