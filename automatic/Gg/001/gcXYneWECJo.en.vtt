00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
don't want to have to build you know

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.710 
don't want to have to build you know
from<00:01:19.130> you<00:01:19.580> know<00:01:19.670> the<00:01:19.790> very<00:01:20.060> bottom<00:01:20.480> of<00:01:20.600> the

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
from you know the very bottom of the

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.080 
from you know the very bottom of the
ship<00:01:20.990> from<00:01:21.320> the<00:01:21.620> keel<00:01:21.860> all<00:01:22.220> the<00:01:22.610> way<00:01:22.730> up<00:01:22.850> to<00:01:23.000> the

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
ship from the keel all the way up to the

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:24.670 
ship from the keel all the way up to the
very<00:01:23.240> top<00:01:23.330> I<00:01:23.690> figured<00:01:23.990> I'd<00:01:24.110> start<00:01:24.380> from<00:01:24.560> the

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
very top I figured I'd start from the

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.330 
very top I figured I'd start from the
middle<00:01:24.800> and<00:01:25.210> it's<00:01:26.210> worked<00:01:26.450> out<00:01:26.600> pretty<00:01:26.660> easy

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
middle and it's worked out pretty easy

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.200 
middle and it's worked out pretty easy
so<00:01:28.340> far<00:01:29.410> and<00:01:30.410> yeah<00:01:31.220> it's<00:01:31.640> worked<00:01:31.850> out<00:01:32.000> really

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
so far and yeah it's worked out really

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:33.870 
so far and yeah it's worked out really
good

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
good

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.920 
good
looks<00:01:34.880> pretty<00:01:35.090> accurate<00:01:37.600> just<00:01:38.600> trying<00:01:38.870> to

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
looks pretty accurate just trying to

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:40.480 
looks pretty accurate just trying to
give<00:01:39.080> you<00:01:39.170> as<00:01:39.290> many<00:01:39.410> views<00:01:39.770> as<00:01:39.800> I<00:01:40.040> can<00:01:40.220> give<00:01:40.370> you

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
give you as many views as I can give you

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:46.630 
give you as many views as I can give you
right<00:01:40.670> now<00:01:42.190> yeah<00:01:43.190> it's<00:01:43.520> it's<00:01:44.420> pretty<00:01:44.690> big<00:01:45.640> as

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
right now yeah it's it's pretty big as

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.470 
right now yeah it's it's pretty big as
you<00:01:46.910> can<00:01:46.940> see<00:01:47.680> it's<00:01:48.680> maybe<00:01:49.250> a<00:01:49.610> little<00:01:49.670> bit

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:50.480 
you can see it's maybe a little bit

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:55.000 
you can see it's maybe a little bit
smaller<00:01:50.630> than<00:01:50.960> a<00:01:51.730> minifigure<00:01:52.730> scale<00:01:53.150> I<00:01:54.010> wish

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.010 
smaller than a minifigure scale I wish

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:01.960 
smaller than a minifigure scale I wish
it<00:01:55.220> was<00:01:55.340> like<00:01:55.370> to<00:01:55.850> scale<00:01:56.180> but<00:01:59.710> here's<00:02:00.970> about

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
it was like to scale but here's about

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.719 
it was like to scale but here's about
the<00:02:02.120> size<00:02:02.360> of<00:02:02.540> a<00:02:02.660> minifig

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:11.250

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
in relation to the ship so yeah it's a

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.540 
in relation to the ship so yeah it's a
pretty<00:02:11.470> big<00:02:11.739> ship
