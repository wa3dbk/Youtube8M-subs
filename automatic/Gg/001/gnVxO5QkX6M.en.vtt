vehicles about two years ago we're going
into<00:00:23.340> our<00:00:23.430> third<00:00:23.730> year<00:00:23.760> and<00:00:24.680> it<00:00:25.680> was<00:00:25.830> a

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
into our third year and it was a

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.560 
into our third year and it was a
decision<00:00:26.279> that<00:00:26.460> we<00:00:26.670> should<00:00:26.849> have<00:00:26.970> made<00:00:27.180> five

years before then it was something that

a<00:00:34.710> serious<00:00:35.550> issue<00:00:35.820> for<00:00:36.360> us<00:00:36.390> it's<00:00:36.780> one<00:00:36.960> of<00:00:37.079> the

is<00:02:11.320> is<00:02:11.500> it<00:02:12.130> we're<00:02:12.579> able<00:02:12.790> to<00:02:13.150> control<00:02:13.540> our<00:02:13.780> costs

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
is is it we're able to control our costs

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.699 
is is it we're able to control our costs
by<00:02:15.280> eliminating<00:02:15.329> the<00:02:16.329> additional<00:02:17.019> expenses

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
by eliminating the additional expenses

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.960 
by eliminating the additional expenses
of<00:02:17.980> buying<00:02:18.700> diesel<00:02:19.269> fuel<00:02:19.650> so<00:02:20.650> we're<00:02:21.640> on<00:02:21.790> the

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
of buying diesel fuel so we're on the

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.720 
of buying diesel fuel so we're on the
streets<00:02:22.030> longer<00:02:22.799> we've<00:02:23.799> eliminated<00:02:24.130> that

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
streets longer we've eliminated that

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.910 
streets longer we've eliminated that
other<00:02:25.030> concerns<00:02:25.570> that<00:02:25.750> they<00:02:25.900> have<00:02:25.930> we're

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
other concerns that they have we're

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.280 
other concerns that they have we're
environmentally<00:02:27.760> friendly<00:02:28.329> and<00:02:28.600> we're<00:02:29.170> going

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
environmentally friendly and we're going

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.850 
environmentally friendly and we're going
to<00:02:29.320> be<00:02:29.530> able<00:02:29.620> to<00:02:29.769> control<00:02:30.130> those

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
to be able to control those

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.230 
to be able to control those
because<00:02:31.160> we<00:02:31.340> found<00:02:31.580> a<00:02:31.730> cheaper<00:02:32.060> food<00:02:32.330> source

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240 
because we found a cheaper food source

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.820 
because we found a cheaper food source
we've<00:02:35.240> been<00:02:35.420> sharing<00:02:35.690> our<00:02:35.990> business<00:02:36.470> plans

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
we've been sharing our business plans

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.390 
we've been sharing our business plans
with<00:02:37.310> others<00:02:37.670> and<00:02:38.590> while<00:02:39.590> that<00:02:39.620> might<00:02:40.040> make<00:02:40.370> us

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
with others and while that might make us

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.200 
with others and while that might make us
in<00:02:40.820> the<00:02:41.480> long<00:02:41.750> run<00:02:42.190> less<00:02:43.190> competitive<00:02:43.970> because

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:44.210 
in the long run less competitive because

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:47.170 
in the long run less competitive because
we<00:02:44.540> have<00:02:44.720> been<00:02:44.930> sharing<00:02:45.200> those<00:02:45.890> successes<00:02:46.490> by

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
we have been sharing those successes by

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.090 
we have been sharing those successes by
converting<00:02:47.750> from<00:02:47.930> diesel<00:02:48.200> fuel<00:02:48.590> and<00:02:48.710> natural

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
converting from diesel fuel and natural

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.850 
converting from diesel fuel and natural
gas<00:02:49.310> it's<00:02:50.210> also<00:02:50.540> something<00:02:51.050> that<00:02:51.230> I<00:02:51.410> think<00:02:51.470> is

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
gas it's also something that I think is

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.450 
gas it's also something that I think is
responsible<00:02:52.630> for<00:02:53.630> its<00:02:54.040> responsible<00:02:55.040> for<00:02:55.280> us

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:55.460 
responsible for its responsible for us

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:59.350 
responsible for its responsible for us

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
what's more than just the economics it's

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.560 
what's more than just the economics it's
it's<00:03:03.110> what<00:03:03.500> we<00:03:03.740> need<00:03:03.950> to<00:03:04.100> do<00:03:04.280> for<00:03:04.880> part<00:03:05.390> of<00:03:05.450> the

it's what we need to do for part of the

it's what we need to do for part of the

long run we're going to be the

long run we're going to be the
beneficiaries<00:03:10.310> of<00:03:10.520> that<00:03:10.550> ideology<00:03:11.420> as<00:03:11.989> well

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
beneficiaries of that ideology as well

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.620 
beneficiaries of that ideology as well
as<00:03:12.380> we<00:03:12.500> have<00:03:12.739> been<00:03:13.010> the<00:03:13.459> beneficiaries<00:03:14.360> of<00:03:14.540> the

economic ideologies of the conversion I

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.320 
economic ideologies of the conversion I
think<00:03:17.600> others<00:03:18.020> are<00:03:18.520> learning<00:03:19.520> from<00:03:19.730> those<00:03:20.060> of

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
think others are learning from those of

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.720 
think others are learning from those of
us<00:03:20.480> who<00:03:20.720> have<00:03:20.840> gone<00:03:21.050> before<00:03:21.110> them<00:03:21.770> in<00:03:21.950> the<00:03:22.010> in

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
us who have gone before them in the in

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.210 
us who have gone before them in the in
the<00:03:22.790> waste<00:03:23.090> industry<00:03:23.720> where<00:03:23.930> we<00:03:24.200> are<00:03:24.500> is<00:03:25.160> a

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
the waste industry where we are is a

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.220 
the waste industry where we are is a
small<00:03:25.700> industry<00:03:26.000> there<00:03:26.690> are<00:03:26.840> a<00:03:26.870> lot<00:03:27.200> of

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
small industry there are a lot of

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.380 
small industry there are a lot of
players<00:03:27.709> in<00:03:27.920> the<00:03:28.130> waste<00:03:28.340> industry<00:03:29.000> and<00:03:29.150> so

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
players in the waste industry and so

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.900 
players in the waste industry and so
because<00:03:30.290> it<00:03:30.440> is<00:03:30.590> small<00:03:31.010> a<00:03:31.040> lot<00:03:31.370> of<00:03:31.520> people<00:03:31.880> know

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
because it is small a lot of people know

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.090 
because it is small a lot of people know
other<00:03:32.330> people<00:03:32.840> and<00:03:32.959> so<00:03:33.260> the<00:03:33.440> word<00:03:33.650> is<00:03:33.830> getting
