00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.430 
they've come a long way baby you this
the<00:00:59.760> actually<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.270> iPhone<00:01:00.690> 6<00:01:01.050> plus<00:01:01.199> will<00:01:01.410> be

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
the actually the iPhone 6 plus will be

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.200 
the actually the iPhone 6 plus will be
very<00:01:01.680> much<00:01:01.859> like<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.309> Nokia<00:01:02.670> Ikon<00:01:03.030> is<00:01:03.059> an

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
very much like the Nokia Ikon is an

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.479 
very much like the Nokia Ikon is an
excellent<00:01:03.719> camera<00:01:04.250> optical<00:01:05.250> image

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
excellent camera optical image

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.580 
excellent camera optical image
stabilization<00:01:06.020> it's<00:01:07.020> maybe<00:01:07.439> a<00:01:07.530> little

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
stabilization it's maybe a little

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.469 
stabilization it's maybe a little
thinner<00:01:08.070> than<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.400> icon<00:01:08.820> but<00:01:08.939> roughly<00:01:09.330> that

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
thinner than the icon but roughly that

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.740 
thinner than the icon but roughly that
size<00:01:09.810> I<00:01:10.909> think<00:01:11.909> that's<00:01:12.060> a<00:01:12.119> good<00:01:12.270> if<00:01:12.450> you<00:01:12.570> like

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
size I think that's a good if you like

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.410 
size I think that's a good if you like
if<00:01:12.990> you're<00:01:13.140> you<00:01:13.380> know<00:01:13.500> an<00:01:13.619> iPhone<00:01:14.090> if<00:01:15.090> you<00:01:15.210> want

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
if you're you know an iPhone if you want

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.969 
if you're you know an iPhone if you want
to<00:01:15.479> get<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.750> best<00:01:15.990> iPhone<00:01:16.409> experience<00:01:16.619> I

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
to get the best iPhone experience I

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.920 
to get the best iPhone experience I
think<00:01:17.159> you're<00:01:17.280> you're<00:01:17.549> you're<00:01:18.509> on<00:01:18.659> track

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
think you're you're you're on track

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.590 
think you're you're you're on track
there<00:01:19.580> so<00:01:20.580> here's<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.939> power<00:01:21.119> I<00:01:21.240> ran<00:01:21.420> into

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
there so here's the power I ran into

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.929 
there so here's the power I ran into
when<00:01:21.840> I<00:01:21.930> set<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.470> icon<00:01:22.680> I<00:01:23.280> used<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:23.700> have<00:01:23.820> all

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
when I set the icon I used to have all

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.210 
when I set the icon I used to have all
my<00:01:24.090> contacts<00:01:24.659> on<00:01:24.869> Google<00:01:25.380> because<00:01:25.619> I<00:01:26.040> have

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
my contacts on Google because I have

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.450 
my contacts on Google because I have
Android<00:01:27.030> phones<00:01:27.270> right<00:01:27.570> now<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:28.530> that<00:01:29.220> works

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
Android phones right now and that works

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.080 
Android phones right now and that works
fine<00:01:29.700> when<00:01:30.090> I<00:01:30.119> transition<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.140> icon<00:01:31.710> I

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
fine when I transition to the icon I

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.460 
fine when I transition to the icon I
realized<00:01:33.090> that<00:01:33.299> I<00:01:33.390> couldn't<00:01:33.720> get<00:01:33.930> Google<00:01:34.259> to

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
realized that I couldn't get Google to

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.819 
realized that I couldn't get Google to
sync<00:01:35.070> up<00:01:35.340> properly<00:01:36.119> with<00:01:36.479> my<00:01:36.780> contacts<00:01:37.619> but

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
sync up properly with my contacts but

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.230 
sync up properly with my contacts but
they<00:01:37.950> have<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.130> calendars<00:01:38.520> on<00:01:38.670> Google<00:01:39.090> when<00:01:39.210> I

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
they have the calendars on Google when I

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.160 
they have the calendars on Google when I
have<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:40.820> boss<00:01:41.820> to<00:01:41.970> work<00:01:42.119> for<00:01:42.299> calendars<00:01:42.810> and

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
have the boss to work for calendars and

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.460 
have the boss to work for calendars and
no<00:01:43.979> mail<00:01:44.850> but<00:01:45.210> I<00:01:45.270> could<00:01:45.509> but<00:01:45.930> I<00:01:46.020> split<00:01:46.350> the

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
no mail but I could but I split the

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.469 
no mail but I could but I split the
contacts<00:01:47.009> wouldn't<00:01:47.460> sync<00:01:47.700> up<00:01:47.850> properly<00:01:48.210> so<00:01:48.329> I

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
contacts wouldn't sync up properly so I

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.870 
contacts wouldn't sync up properly so I
had<00:01:48.689> to<00:01:48.869> copy<00:01:49.560> them<00:01:49.799> out<00:01:49.920> of<00:01:50.040> Google<00:01:50.430> you<00:01:50.700> will

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:14.810 
Microsoft for this I do feel like Google

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:17.690 
for reasons I don't really understand is

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:20.300 
for reasons I don't really understand is
dissing<00:06:18.690> Microsoft<00:06:19.530> maybe<00:06:19.740> get<00:06:19.919> to<00:06:20.039> compare

any competitive thing they work fine

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.050 
any competitive thing they work fine
with<00:06:22.349> Apple<00:06:22.710> I<00:06:22.889> think<00:06:23.310> because<00:06:23.550> they<00:06:23.699> had<00:06:23.880> to

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:24.060 
with Apple I think because they had to

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:25.670 
with Apple I think because they had to
because<00:06:24.300> the<00:06:24.360> iPhone<00:06:24.509> was<00:06:24.840> dominant<00:06:25.409> for<00:06:25.560> so

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:25.680 
because the iPhone was dominant for so

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:27.860 
because the iPhone was dominant for so
long<00:06:25.889> but<00:06:26.819> remember<00:06:27.180> Google<00:06:27.360> has<00:06:27.599> their<00:06:27.780> own

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:27.870 
long but remember Google has their own

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:30.439 
long but remember Google has their own
platform<00:06:28.349> Android<00:06:28.889> and<00:06:29.190> they'd<00:06:29.969> love<00:06:30.150> you<00:06:30.210> all

00:06:32.809 --> 00:06:32.819 
to start using Android so Google and

00:06:32.819 --> 00:06:34.490 
to start using Android so Google and
Apple<00:06:32.940> work<00:06:33.210> all<00:06:33.389> right<00:06:33.419> but<00:06:33.870> Google<00:06:34.469> has

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:34.500 
Apple work all right but Google has

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.829

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:01.680 
I feel like Google is kind of

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:03.110 
I feel like Google is kind of
intentionally<00:07:02.250> saying<00:07:02.520> and<00:07:02.639> we<00:07:02.700> don't<00:07:02.880> want

to work with Windows Phone and that's a

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:07.280 
to work with Windows Phone and that's a
