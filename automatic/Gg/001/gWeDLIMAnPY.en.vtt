Jackson Krauser I met you in Fort
Collins<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:37.290> I<00:00:37.649> think<00:00:38.100> that's<00:00:38.280> how<00:00:38.399> you<00:00:38.460> say

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
Collins and I think that's how you say

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.150 
Collins and I think that's how you say
your<00:00:38.700> last<00:00:38.850> name<00:00:39.000> this<00:00:39.840> is<00:00:40.020> for<00:00:40.230> you<00:00:40.320> so

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
your last name this is for you so

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.860 
your last name this is for you so

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
something you men want but in no way

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.090 
something you men want but in no way
need<00:00:43.379> are<00:00:43.739> shin<00:00:44.250> guards<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:45.469> if<00:00:46.469> you<00:00:46.680> haven't

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
need are shin guards and if you haven't

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.760 
need are shin guards and if you haven't
already<00:00:47.670> gotten<00:00:48.090> shin<00:00:48.660> guards<00:00:49.020> then<00:00:49.289> I<00:00:49.530> would

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
already gotten shin guards then I would

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.569 
already gotten shin guards then I would
recommend<00:00:50.550> buying<00:00:51.059> g-form<00:00:51.780> shin<00:00:52.170> guards

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:52.579 
recommend buying g-form shin guards

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:56.420 
recommend buying g-form shin guards
they're<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:54.410> really<00:00:55.410> comfortable<00:00:55.890> material

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
they're a really comfortable material

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.740 
they're a really comfortable material
with<00:00:56.579> really<00:00:56.789> lightweight<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.449> they've

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
with really lightweight and they've

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.180 
with really lightweight and they've
hardened<00:00:58.079> on<00:00:58.170> impact<00:00:58.500> so<00:00:58.710> when<00:00:58.949> you<00:00:59.039> just

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
hardened on impact so when you just

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.340 
hardened on impact so when you just
press<00:00:59.430> on<00:00:59.640> them<00:00:59.730> they're<00:00:59.910> really<00:01:00.120> soft<00:01:00.510> but

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
press on them they're really soft but

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.460 
press on them they're really soft but
when<00:01:01.469> you<00:01:01.559> get<00:01:01.710> it<00:01:01.890> there's<00:01:02.280> solid<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:03.470> 50

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
when you get it there's solid and 50

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.230 
when you get it there's solid and 50
bucks<00:01:04.710> they<00:01:05.100> don't<00:01:05.280> look<00:01:05.489> like<00:01:05.549> they<00:01:05.939> would<00:01:06.119> do

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
bucks they don't look like they would do

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.160 
bucks they don't look like they would do
anything

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
anything

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.810 
anything
but<00:01:07.439> by<00:01:07.650> far<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:07.979> best<00:01:08.310> shin<00:01:08.460> guards<00:01:08.729> I've

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
but by far the best shin guards I've

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.219 
but by far the best shin guards I've
ever<00:01:08.970> ridden<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:09.390> I've<00:01:09.510> written<00:01:09.689> my<00:01:09.990> fair

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
ever ridden and I've written my fair

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.740 
ever ridden and I've written my fair
share<00:01:10.260> of<00:01:10.530> shin<00:01:10.830> guards<00:01:11.130> so<00:01:11.400> I<00:01:11.750> definitely

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
share of shin guards so I definitely

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:21.020 
share of shin guards so I definitely
recommend<00:01:12.990> getting<00:01:13.470> some<00:01:13.710> of<00:01:13.799> those

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.179 

and<00:01:23.159> you<00:01:24.159> don't<00:01:24.369> really<00:01:24.549> need<00:01:25.360> it<00:01:25.680> but<00:01:26.680> it's<00:01:26.979> I

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:27.189 
and you don't really need it but it's I

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:29.249 
and you don't really need it but it's I
learned<00:01:27.549> wearing<00:01:28.360> like<00:01:28.509> a<00:01:28.539> tiger<00:01:29.020> shirt

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:29.259 
learned wearing like a tiger shirt

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:31.170 
learned wearing like a tiger shirt
obviously<00:01:29.890> this<00:01:30.009> one's<00:01:30.220> not<00:01:30.399> very<00:01:30.460> tight<00:01:30.820> so<00:01:31.149> I

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
obviously this one's not very tight so I

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:32.700 
obviously this one's not very tight so I
don't<00:01:31.479> really<00:01:31.539> need<00:01:31.750> anymore<00:01:32.020> but<00:01:32.380> I<00:01:32.560> was

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
don't really need anymore but I was

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.529 
don't really need anymore but I was
afraid<00:01:32.860> that<00:01:33.070> my<00:01:33.369> bars<00:01:33.579> would<00:01:33.789> catch<00:01:33.970> my<00:01:34.149> shirt

00:01:34.529 --> 00:01:34.539 
afraid that my bars would catch my shirt

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:37.200 
afraid that my bars would catch my shirt
so<00:01:34.750> either<00:01:35.619> scratch<00:01:36.310> it<00:01:36.429> out<00:01:36.520> about<00:01:36.729> that<00:01:36.939> then

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
so either scratch it out about that then

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:38.190 
so either scratch it out about that then
I<00:01:37.299> would<00:01:37.390> definitely<00:01:37.750> wear<00:01:37.869> something<00:01:38.170> a

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
I would definitely wear something a

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.600 
I would definitely wear something a
little<00:01:38.409> tighter<00:01:38.619> or<00:01:38.830> like<00:01:38.950> a<00:01:38.979> jacket<00:01:39.460> that

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
little tighter or like a jacket that

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.149 
little tighter or like a jacket that
pulls<00:01:39.820> it<00:01:39.939> all<00:01:40.030> in<00:01:40.770> you're<00:01:41.770> gonna<00:01:41.920> need<00:01:42.100> a

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
higher than what I demonstrated

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.660 
higher than what I demonstrated
obviously<00:02:08.500> because<00:02:08.800> you<00:02:08.979> want<00:02:09.160> time<00:02:09.340> to<00:02:09.369> throw

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
obviously because you want time to throw

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.860 
obviously because you want time to throw
the<00:02:09.700> actual<00:02:10.149> bar<00:02:10.330> spin<00:02:11.100> and<00:02:12.100> also<00:02:12.760> you're<00:02:13.720> not

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
the actual bar spin and also you're not
