many<00:02:32.050> many<00:02:32.200> years<00:02:32.440> there's<00:02:33.340> been<00:02:33.490> a<00:02:33.550> lot<00:02:33.760> of

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
many many years there's been a lot of

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.880 
many many years there's been a lot of
debate<00:02:34.210> should<00:02:34.570> we<00:02:34.690> use<00:02:34.870> embryonic<00:02:35.590> cells

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
debate should we use embryonic cells

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.220 
debate should we use embryonic cells
adult<00:02:36.520> stem<00:02:36.880> cells<00:02:37.270> again<00:02:37.690> you're<00:02:37.840> coming<00:02:38.170> out

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
adult stem cells again you're coming out

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:39.810 
adult stem cells again you're coming out
with<00:02:38.290> a<00:02:38.440> book<00:02:38.560> that's<00:02:39.070> approved<00:02:39.520> by<00:02:39.760> the

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
with a book that's approved by the

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.480 
with a book that's approved by the
Vatican<00:02:40.450> talk<00:02:41.170> to<00:02:41.320> us<00:02:41.350> about<00:02:41.560> this<00:02:41.830> debate<00:02:42.220> in

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
Vatican talk to us about this debate in

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:44.460 
Vatican talk to us about this debate in
your<00:02:42.640> position<00:02:43.150> yeah<00:02:43.600> so<00:02:43.870> people<00:02:44.110> don't

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
your position yeah so people don't

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.230 
your position yeah so people don't
realize<00:02:44.800> a<00:02:44.830> bone<00:02:45.160> marrow<00:02:45.190> transplant<00:02:45.760> which

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.240 
realize a bone marrow transplant which

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.180 
realize a bone marrow transplant which
has<00:02:46.390> been<00:02:46.540> used<00:02:46.720> for<00:02:46.870> 30<00:02:47.170> years<00:02:47.410> for<00:02:47.890> part<00:02:48.100> of

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
has been used for 30 years for part of

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.060 
has been used for 30 years for part of
cancer<00:02:48.610> therapy<00:02:49.120> is<00:02:49.330> a<00:02:49.390> stem<00:02:49.810> cell<00:02:50.050> and<00:02:50.260> so<00:02:50.830> now

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
cancer therapy is a stem cell and so now

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.830 
cancer therapy is a stem cell and so now
what<00:02:51.370> we're<00:02:51.490> realizing<00:02:51.850> is<00:02:52.240> there's<00:02:52.450> a<00:02:52.510> lot<00:02:52.810> of

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
what we're realizing is there's a lot of

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.640 
what we're realizing is there's a lot of
advances<00:02:53.530> many<00:02:53.830> clinical<00:02:54.280> trials<00:02:54.670> 4500

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
advances many clinical trials 4500

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.530 
advances many clinical trials 4500
22,000<00:02:56.650> cell<00:02:57.220> therapy<00:02:57.640> trials<00:02:57.880> that<00:02:58.480> are

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
22,000 cell therapy trials that are

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.840 
22,000 cell therapy trials that are
looking<00:02:59.380> to<00:02:59.500> take<00:02:59.650> the<00:02:59.860> cells<00:03:00.070> of<00:03:00.220> our<00:03:00.340> body<00:03:00.580> to

looking to take the cells of our body to

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.160 
looking to take the cells of our body to
create<00:03:00.970> therapies<00:03:01.600> and<00:03:01.780> people<00:03:02.050> don't

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
create therapies and people don't

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.410 
create therapies and people don't
understand<00:03:02.770> that<00:03:02.890> people<00:03:03.520> are<00:03:03.790> walking<00:03:04.060> who

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
understand that people are walking who

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:05.970 
understand that people are walking who
have<00:03:04.510> been<00:03:04.660> part<00:03:04.960> of<00:03:05.050> the<00:03:05.140> clinical<00:03:05.530> trials

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
have been part of the clinical trials

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.740 
have been part of the clinical trials
whose<00:03:06.160> lives<00:03:06.430> have<00:03:06.670> been<00:03:06.820> changed<00:03:06.880> and<00:03:07.330> the

whose lives have been changed and the

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.000 
whose lives have been changed and the
idea<00:03:08.020> of<00:03:08.110> the<00:03:08.170> book<00:03:08.440> is<00:03:08.470> to<00:03:08.710> help<00:03:08.800> educate

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
idea of the book is to help educate

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.250 
idea of the book is to help educate
people<00:03:09.580> on<00:03:09.940> the<00:03:10.150> advances<00:03:10.630> of<00:03:10.660> adult<00:03:11.050> stem

people on the advances of adult stem

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.140 
people on the advances of adult stem
cells<00:03:11.560> to<00:03:11.770> have<00:03:12.160> them<00:03:12.340> understand<00:03:12.820> they<00:03:12.970> don't

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
cells to have them understand they don't

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.729 
cells to have them understand they don't
have<00:03:13.300> to<00:03:13.420> choose<00:03:13.660> between<00:03:13.840> science<00:03:14.440> and<00:03:14.530> faith

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
have to choose between science and faith

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:16.800
