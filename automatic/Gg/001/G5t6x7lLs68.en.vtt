here this spoiler is pretty fully

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.020 
here this spoiler is pretty fully
functional<00:02:54.660> I<00:02:58.010> can<00:02:59.010> it'll<00:02:59.400> do<00:02:59.520> that<00:02:59.700> so<00:02:59.940> if

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
functional I can it'll do that so if

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.910 
functional I can it'll do that so if
you're<00:03:00.180> stopping<00:03:00.450> you<00:03:01.020> know<00:03:01.110> realize<00:03:01.500> if

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
you're stopping you know realize if

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.340 
you're stopping you know realize if
you're<00:03:02.040> doing<00:03:02.160> that<00:03:02.540> and<00:03:03.540> then<00:03:03.959> if<00:03:04.080> you<00:03:04.200> hit

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
you're doing that and then if you hit

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.620 
you're doing that and then if you hit
like<00:03:04.500> 2:30<00:03:05.250> I<00:03:05.370> think<00:03:05.700> it<00:03:05.790> is<00:03:05.940> it'll<00:03:06.120> retract

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
like 2:30 I think it is it'll retract

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:15.080 
like 2:30 I think it is it'll retract
down<00:03:06.900> to<00:03:07.110> uh<00:03:11.989> it<00:03:12.989> doesn't<00:03:13.260> really<00:03:13.790> but<00:03:14.790> I've

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
down to uh it doesn't really but I've

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.790 
down to uh it doesn't really but I've
done<00:03:15.450> it<00:03:15.570> before

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800
