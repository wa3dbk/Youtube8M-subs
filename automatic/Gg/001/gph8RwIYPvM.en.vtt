actually paying playing because they

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.429

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
I'm fortunate that I work with a lot of

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.929 
I'm fortunate that I work with a lot of
self<00:01:18.630> motivated<00:01:19.320> at<00:01:19.590> athletes<00:01:20.460> that<00:01:20.729> they

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
self motivated at athletes that they

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.499 
self motivated at athletes that they

really care about the game but also I

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.780 
really care about the game but also I
think<00:01:24.810> that's<00:01:25.320> one<00:01:25.560> of<00:01:25.590> my<00:01:25.830> primary<00:01:26.130> roles

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
think that's one of my primary roles

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.730 
think that's one of my primary roles
that<00:01:27.150> when<00:01:27.390> they<00:01:27.570> are<00:01:27.600> having<00:01:28.020> one<00:01:28.439> of<00:01:28.590> their

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
that when they are having one of their

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.060 
that when they are having one of their
down<00:01:29.490> days<00:01:29.909> or<00:01:30.240> their<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.689> emotionally<00:01:31.439> not

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
down days or their the emotionally not

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.030 
down days or their the emotionally not
as<00:01:32.369> high<00:01:32.850> as<00:01:32.909> some<00:01:33.900> other<00:01:34.140> days<00:01:34.409> that<00:01:34.439> I<00:01:34.710> have

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
as high as some other days that I have

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.340 
as high as some other days that I have
to<00:01:35.220> find<00:01:35.490> ways<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:36.180> say<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.450> right<00:01:36.780> thing<00:01:37.079> or

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
was it because that seems to be the key

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.999 
was it because that seems to be the key
of<00:01:57.659> what<00:01:57.869> you're<00:01:58.020> talking<00:01:58.380> about<00:01:58.469> in<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.799> book

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
of what you're talking about in the book

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.550 
of what you're talking about in the book
is<00:01:59.219> you<00:02:00.210> seem<00:02:00.479> to<00:02:00.600> be<00:02:00.719> trying<00:02:00.869> to<00:02:01.049> get<00:02:01.229> people

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
is you seem to be trying to get people

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.350 
is you seem to be trying to get people
to<00:02:01.590> identify<00:02:01.969> something<00:02:02.969> in<00:02:03.149> their<00:02:03.270> life

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
to identify something in their life

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.240 
to identify something in their life
that's<00:02:03.659> beyond<00:02:04.049> what<00:02:04.320> most<00:02:04.829> people

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
that's beyond what most people

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.850 
that's beyond what most people
categorize<00:02:05.700> as<00:02:06.060> success<00:02:06.630> yeah<00:02:07.229> absolutely<00:02:07.500> i

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
categorize as success yeah absolutely i

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.050 
categorize as success yeah absolutely i
think<00:02:07.979> there<00:02:08.399> are<00:02:08.459> different<00:02:08.849> ways<00:02:09.000> to

important<00:03:44.100> I<00:03:44.190> think<00:03:44.310> obviously<00:03:44.910> women<00:03:45.810> are<00:03:46.049> a

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
important I think obviously women are a

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.979 
important I think obviously women are a
great<00:03:47.100> part<00:03:47.820> of<00:03:48.030> what<00:03:48.209> we're<00:03:48.360> all<00:03:48.570> about<00:03:48.600> and

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
great part of what we're all about and

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
and and and but i think that male

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.590 
and and and but i think that male
influence<00:03:55.110> leadership<00:03:55.829> wise<00:03:56.100> is<00:03:56.489> a<00:03:56.820> big<00:03:57.269> part

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.209 
said
these<00:04:12.900> are<00:04:13.109> the<00:04:13.230> characteristics<00:04:13.920> I<00:04:14.010> think

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:14.219 
these are the characteristics I think

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:15.949 
these are the characteristics I think
they<00:04:14.280> really<00:04:14.549> make<00:04:14.730> up<00:04:14.879> what<00:04:15.030> a<00:04:15.060> real<00:04:15.510> man<00:04:15.930> is

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
they really make up what a real man is

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.409 
they really make up what a real man is
what<00:04:16.350> do<00:04:16.410> you<00:04:16.500> think<00:04:16.680> a<00:04:16.769> real<00:04:17.130> man<00:04:17.579> is<00:04:17.609> well<00:04:18.150> in

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
what do you think a real man is well in

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:21.590 
what do you think a real man is well in
my<00:04:18.660> opinion<00:04:18.900> I<00:04:19.560> think<00:04:19.769> first<00:04:20.489> of<00:04:20.699> all<00:04:20.880> you<00:04:21.329> have

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
my opinion I think first of all you have

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.020 
my opinion I think first of all you have
to<00:04:21.810> be<00:04:21.989> a<00:04:22.019> man<00:04:22.350> of<00:04:22.380> strong<00:04:22.830> character<00:04:23.580> I<00:04:23.610> think

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
to be a man of strong character I think

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.060 
to be a man of strong character I think
that<00:04:24.210> has<00:04:24.479> to<00:04:24.509> be<00:04:24.720> the<00:04:24.840> whole<00:04:25.139> foundation<00:04:25.410> of

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
that has to be the whole foundation of

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.100 
that has to be the whole foundation of
who<00:04:26.729> you<00:04:26.910> are<00:04:27.060> you<00:04:27.270> got<00:04:27.449> it<00:04:27.630> you<00:04:27.750> got<00:04:27.780> to<00:04:27.990> have

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
who you are you got it you got to have

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.290 
who you are you got it you got to have
strong<00:04:28.440> character<00:04:29.009> and<00:04:29.160> I<00:04:29.550> think<00:04:29.820> second<00:04:30.210> of

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
strong character and I think second of

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.629 
strong character and I think second of
all<00:04:30.449> you<00:04:30.930> have<00:04:31.110> to<00:04:31.289> care<00:04:31.620> about<00:04:31.740> others<00:04:32.039> more

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 
all you have to care about others more

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:35.029 
all you have to care about others more
than<00:04:32.880> you<00:04:33.000> care<00:04:33.240> about<00:04:33.300> yourself<00:04:34.020> and<00:04:34.320> that's

00:04:35.029 --> 00:04:35.039 
than you care about yourself and that's

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:38.029 
than you care about yourself and that's
the<00:04:35.280> way<00:04:35.610> that<00:04:35.789> I<00:04:35.970> care<00:04:36.270> in<00:04:36.479> my<00:04:36.600> life<00:04:36.840> I<00:04:37.050> think

00:04:38.029 --> 00:04:38.039 
the way that I care in my life I think

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:39.379 
the way that I care in my life I think
also<00:04:38.370> you<00:04:38.550> got<00:04:38.759> to<00:04:38.880> be<00:04:38.970> able<00:04:39.000> to<00:04:39.210> communicate

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
you know in this world you got to be

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:42.770 
you know in this world you got to be
able<00:04:41.669> to<00:04:41.820> communicate<00:04:42.180> and<00:04:42.419> I<00:04:42.449> know<00:04:42.509> there<00:04:42.750> are

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
able to communicate and I know there are

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.749 
able to communicate and I know there are
different<00:04:43.139> forms<00:04:43.259> of<00:04:43.500> communication<00:04:44.190> but<00:04:44.340> you

00:04:44.749 --> 00:04:44.759 
different forms of communication but you

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:46.279 
different forms of communication but you

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
to have you don't have to be a

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.320 
to have you don't have to be a
first-class<00:04:48.500> individual<00:04:49.729> but<00:04:50.729> I<00:04:50.759> think<00:04:51.120> more

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
first-class individual but I think more

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:52.909 
first-class individual but I think more
than<00:04:51.360> anything<00:04:51.810> you<00:04:52.139> have<00:04:52.199> to<00:04:52.410> be<00:04:52.530> committed

than anything you have to be committed
to<00:04:53.190> whatever<00:04:53.699> you're<00:04:54.000> doing<00:04:54.389> what<00:04:55.050> it's

00:04:55.339 --> 00:04:55.349 
to whatever you're doing what it's

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:58.700 
to whatever you're doing what it's
basketball<00:04:55.620> your<00:04:56.430> family<00:04:57.229> you<00:04:58.229> have<00:04:58.410> to<00:04:58.590> be

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
basketball your family you have to be

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.710 
basketball your family you have to be
consistent<00:04:58.949> and<00:04:59.490> committed<00:05:00.000> and<00:05:00.210> that's<00:05:00.570> what

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
consistent and committed and that's what

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.219 
consistent and committed and that's what
