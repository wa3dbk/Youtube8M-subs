husband just looks lazy he looks a bit

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.650 
husband just looks lazy he looks a bit
cocky<00:02:08.069> at<00:02:08.160> times<00:02:08.399> and<00:02:08.759> he's<00:02:08.849> just<00:02:09.030> not<00:02:09.239> doing

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
cocky at times and he's just not doing

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:10.969 
cocky at times and he's just not doing
what<00:02:09.840> he<00:02:09.929> should<00:02:10.170> be<00:02:10.200> doing<00:02:10.289> I<00:02:10.590> dread<00:02:10.830> to<00:02:10.950> think

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
what he should be doing I dread to think

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.530 
what he should be doing I dread to think
how<00:02:11.190> much<00:02:11.400> money<00:02:11.670> he's<00:02:11.879> on

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
how much money he's on

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.940 
how much money he's on
considering<00:02:13.540> he's<00:02:13.840> doing<00:02:14.109> very<00:02:14.140> little<00:02:14.439> for

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
considering he's doing very little for

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.390 
considering he's doing very little for
the<00:02:15.010> club<00:02:15.219> and<00:02:15.489> I<00:02:15.519> think<00:02:16.450> one<00:02:16.959> unit<00:02:17.530> one<00:02:17.650> factor

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
the club and I think one unit one factor

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.709 
the club and I think one unit one factor
for<00:02:18.579> full<00:02:18.760> and<00:02:18.909> there's<00:02:19.120> had<00:02:19.390> a<00:02:19.420> massive

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:19.719 
for full and there's had a massive

00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:21.119 
for full and there's had a massive
impact<00:02:19.900> on<00:02:20.260> them<00:02:20.439> this<00:02:20.590> season<00:02:20.799> is<00:02:21.099> that

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:21.129 
impact on them this season is that

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:22.740 
impact on them this season is that
they've<00:02:21.430> lost<00:02:21.670> bred<00:02:21.939> a<00:02:21.969> handle<00:02:22.390> and<00:02:22.510> for<00:02:22.689> a

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
they've lost bred a handle and for a

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.559 
they've lost bred a handle and for a
majority<00:02:22.870> of<00:02:23.500> the<00:02:23.590> campaigns<00:02:24.489> he's<00:02:25.269> the<00:02:25.420> guy

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
majority of the campaigns he's the guy

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:26.729 
majority of the campaigns he's the guy
who<00:02:25.629> really<00:02:25.900> makes<00:02:26.140> them<00:02:26.290> tick<00:02:26.500> and<00:02:26.560> you

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
who really makes them tick and you

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:28.410 
who really makes them tick and you
notice<00:02:27.099> when<00:02:27.250> he<00:02:27.370> came<00:02:27.519> back<00:02:27.579> against<00:02:28.000> Norwich

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
notice when he came back against Norwich

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:29.879 
notice when he came back against Norwich
he<00:02:28.780> I<00:02:28.810> don't<00:02:29.109> think<00:02:29.290> he<00:02:29.349> had<00:02:29.439> his<00:02:29.530> best<00:02:29.709> of

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:29.889 
he I don't think he had his best of

00:02:29.889 --> 00:02:30.929 
he I don't think he had his best of
games<00:02:30.099> but<00:02:30.250> they<00:02:30.459> looked<00:02:30.639> a<00:02:30.700> bit<00:02:30.730> more

00:02:30.929 --> 00:02:30.939 
games but they looked a bit more

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:33.000 
games but they looked a bit more
motivated<00:02:31.599> when<00:02:31.719> he<00:02:31.900> was<00:02:32.019> in<00:02:32.139> the<00:02:32.200> team<00:02:32.439> he's<00:02:32.980> a

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
motivated when he was in the team he's a

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.190 
motivated when he was in the team he's a
leader<00:02:33.430> figured<00:02:33.939> out<00:02:34.060> 40<00:02:34.540> figure<00:02:34.780> they<00:02:34.959> need

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
leader figured out 40 figure they need

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.929 
leader figured out 40 figure they need
and<00:02:35.439> only<00:02:35.920> know<00:02:36.040> he's<00:02:36.189> a<00:02:36.219> very<00:02:36.459> good<00:02:36.639> defender

00:02:36.929 --> 00:02:36.939 
and only know he's a very good defender

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:39.360 
and only know he's a very good defender
so<00:02:37.269> and<00:02:37.810> it's<00:02:38.439> just<00:02:38.590> kind<00:02:38.680> of<00:02:38.799> typical<00:02:39.099> he

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
so and it's just kind of typical he

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.339 
so and it's just kind of typical he
comes<00:02:39.609> back<00:02:39.849> straight<00:02:40.329> when<00:02:40.540> winter<00:02:40.900> when

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:41.349 
comes back straight when winter when

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:42.660 
comes back straight when winter when
we're<00:02:41.469> gonna<00:02:41.590> play<00:02:41.859> for<00:02:41.920> them<00:02:42.189> so<00:02:42.400> then

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
we're gonna play for them so then

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.099 
we're gonna play for them so then
offense<00:02:43.000> is<00:02:43.120> gonna<00:02:43.239> be<00:02:43.359> much<00:02:43.540> harder<00:02:43.900> to

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:44.109 
offense is gonna be much harder to

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:45.899 
offense is gonna be much harder to
penetrate<00:02:44.260> now<00:02:44.739> if<00:02:45.370> I'm<00:02:45.519> trying<00:02:45.730> to<00:02:45.790> pick<00:02:45.879> a

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
more goals and you think of two goes up

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
we kind of sit back that's certainly

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.199 
we kind of sit back that's certainly
something<00:03:32.680> that<00:03:32.979> we<00:03:33.099> did<00:03:33.220> against<00:03:33.430> villa<00:03:33.669> we

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
something that we did against villa we

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:35.969 
something that we did against villa we
can't<00:03:34.510> afford<00:03:34.659> to<00:03:34.959> be<00:03:35.109> doing<00:03:35.349> that<00:03:35.500> night<00:03:35.739> miss

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:37.439 
can't afford to be doing that night miss
division<00:03:36.250> we've<00:03:36.519> always<00:03:36.729> got<00:03:37.060> to<00:03:37.150> get<00:03:37.299> more

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:37.449

division we've always got to get more
gold<00:03:37.659> and<00:03:38.349> I<00:03:38.470> think<00:03:38.680> big<00:03:38.829> it<00:03:38.949> leaves<00:03:39.129> us

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
gold and I think big it leaves us

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.679 
gold and I think big it leaves us
vulnerable<00:03:39.280> anymore<00:03:40.030> i've<00:03:40.120> written<00:03:40.269> a<00:03:40.389> common

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:53.849 
honestly I'm not too worried about that

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:56.189 
honestly I'm not too worried about that
but<00:03:54.849> on<00:03:55.060> a<00:03:55.090> brighter<00:03:55.359> side<00:03:55.720> of<00:03:55.780> this<00:03:55.959> game

00:03:56.189 --> 00:03:56.199 
but on a brighter side of this game

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:58.140 
but on a brighter side of this game
Ramsey<00:03:56.889> could<00:03:57.040> be<00:03:57.129> back<00:03:57.280> for<00:03:57.519> it<00:03:57.579> hopefully

00:04:39.309 --> 00:04:39.319 
games against Aston Villa it might be a

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:41.260 
games against Aston Villa it might be a
case<00:04:39.500> of<00:04:39.560> him<00:04:39.830> needing<00:04:40.130> a<00:04:40.190> rest<00:04:40.490> also<00:04:41.180> on

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:42.949 
penalties to be given a chance on that

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:45.370

he played there against kind of a couple
of<00:04:48.259> weeks<00:04:48.440> ago<00:04:48.560> so<00:04:49.190> give<00:04:49.370> him<00:04:49.430> that<00:04:49.580> chance<00:04:49.610> on

the<00:04:50.060> left-hand<00:04:50.419> side<00:04:50.509> there<00:04:50.810> would<00:04:50.930> be<00:04:50.960> very

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:51.229 
the left-hand side there would be very

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:52.809 
the left-hand side there would be very
