00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 war in the Donbass is a godly thing 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.240
 opinion was expressed by the patriarch of the Ukrainian 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.220
 church in a telephone conversation with 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.260
 pranker young man introduced himself 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.660
 Filaret commander of the battalion Donbass and 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.210
 summoned the clergy on frank 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.970
 conversation what purpose was pranker 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:23.910
 and what he managed to learn will tell my 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:26.390
 colleagues about the lot good evening reigns good 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.900
 the evening is bothering semen semenchenko 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:34.380
 battalion commander Donbass at the file 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:36.930
 just wanted to probably repent 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.879
 a little bit on the other end of the wire instead 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.520
 battalion commander wishing to repent 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.710
 Donbass Pranker Alexey another object 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.809
 his phone prank patriarch 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.489
 Ukrainian Orthodox Church Filaret 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.559
 to the world Mikhail Denisenko 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.719
 after five minutes sentimental 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.210
 confessions by telephone cleric 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.969
 agrees to let sins go to all who 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.309
 involved in the conflict in the Donbass he became 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.710
 very relevant in recent weeks when 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:05.360
 stated that he approves of the war on 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.799
 Donbas that he basically believes 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:11.220
 appropriate to kill your own citizens 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.750
 so I was wondering if 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.350
 to match his words 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.900
 reality or is it just ready 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.880
 fiction from the media 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.830
 it turned out not fiction on words 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.509
 fake semenchenko about what he 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.790
 feels guilty for dead people 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.590
 Filaret declared that all Ukrainian 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.140
 church prays for absolution 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.540
 battalion fighters donbass and called 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:37.470

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:42.259

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:46.259

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:54.180

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.860
 of absolution Alexei touched on the topic 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.840
 torture over the militias however these 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.759
 actions according to filaret were 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.979
 sinless he even compared them to 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.680
 I was interested in biblical subjects 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.960
 what can he say about this he 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.290
 said that 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:17.830
 again referred to one of the biblical 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:20.900
 stories old testament where he approved there 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:23.480
 executions different to scare the enemy and 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.540
 said that in general there is nothing 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.730

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.930
