 the ORF transmits one promises 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.359
 but the time of the renovation of the MAAWG working hours old 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:22.359
 is played three days after the resignation with the b 19 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.730
 It is the right eighth 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:27.560
 Dieter Baier no idea 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.009
 and there were critics back then 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:32.270
 the 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.180
 APA the gentleman with the bundle with Miley is nothing but felix ' 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.499
 that should not stand in the way of the fun 

00:00:40.499 --> 00:00:44.739
 and games of the 1 who today will enjoy the plans of still one ticket per 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:50.229
 Far parts of a Minas SAC nuclear reactor videos that hits the year 

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:52.630
 It was "lion" 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:53.600
 just hold on 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.260
 bring in the cheater 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.450
 I'm in a really good mood 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.070
 no idea why 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.260
 I offer them now with some questions that come up completely 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.410
 Wenger's non-subscribers name this because they are not so frequently asked 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:07.260
 become these questions 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.560
 this is Dr a look at the finals 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.560
 and then the corridors come back to Paragon thinking questions 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.830
 the first question and the Eichbaum and I are the most interested 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.130
 is the question Helfant dar 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.130
 why is that actually called except that a 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.410
 for a good question 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.740
 I do not ask this question as often as I hope I can answer it first 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.950
 she never asks again 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.290
 and that might not sound too dramatic now because of the debt crisis 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.390
 or what ever 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:36.270
 it was like this 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.880
 the beings I was in love with a girl 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.220
 and this Nietzsche and I have then 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.520
 the htc-team will be in love with me there 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:46.390
 and 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.990
 treat that crazy as it is called people every day now 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.100
 get drunk 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.110

 The fan you can also have Aigners soft drinks brings the found but cool 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.560
 After some time we have embellishments like live 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.049
 called cooler and panther 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:06.670
 this victory is victory or and they are not easy i already thought that 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.959
 Backhand has a good name Sonic Najemnik ads and then use the 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:14.920

 market 

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:20.159
 so he was allowed to drive and then I tried on the youtube 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:23.429
 At this hand, take a percent of what miracle she has forgiven one 

00:02:24.499 --> 00:02:26.399
 Gallen no problem of course for me 

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:29.399
 I have just downloaded a file in the background 

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:31.869
 Of course they had the ending 

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:34.230
 whether texts have any program 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.569
 or tweet and chat again 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:39.679
 Point exists a repression here in Windows 

00:02:39.679 --> 00:02:41.720
 the fire has that fits yet 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.779
 and because I can say six of those in the year one has looked for them 

00:02:44.779 --> 00:02:46.220
 Harald should not do any 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:47.050
 pressure point 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:48.759
 Percent not everyone on YouTube 

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:51.789
 that's why witch found shit too, so Expand 8 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:55.540
 from the verdict Panther and focus on this issue of Iran once and for all 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:56.329
 clarified 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:03:00.299
 next question presented the internet because only know where 

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:04.989
 who dared to know the AXA is not a plan 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:09.090
 the cadet will all like to wrap up Criminal Intent corner point Exter no 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.659
 because their subscribers or findings about it as always as me 

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:15.389
 a problem with that 

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:18.379
 now also the last days of shooting that could use more and more often 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:20.959
 no one why and secondly is an almost abs 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:23.599
 to doxis4 box and 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:28.310
 has included me in his box and make up 50 years ago so it seems quite 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.549
 Of course I certainly did not fail now 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:32.359
 Book Store Box even less 

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:35.769
 and what they give the most on the cap at the moment that is preparing me 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:38.269
 to be able to come own Recommind 2 gates 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:42.740
 The then say heart attack will pack me at least a box for two weeks 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:45.740
 then the RAF calls 15 but thinks 

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:51.319
 Of course, March has the hard to roll money percent 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:54.079
 it is a pity 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:57.079
 I could know how the tribute but Lincoln Center Furnishing 

00:03:58.029 --> 00:04:01.230

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:02.349
 not always fix and 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:06.880
 to delight shop around the corner and buy either he costs now wants 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.239
 for 20 years 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:09.209
 si 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:11.489
 No, completely empty 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:15.279
 the duty by means of certain in a box I blocked »since then I am 

00:04:15.279 --> 00:04:16.509
 sure he's a war 

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:19.470
 but no matter now so it should be clear 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.440
 i just want to have my box just people who really care about me too well 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.960
 find 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.720
 not some closeness 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:25.789
 to start here 

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:28.729
 the duty to do all advertising 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:33.090
 one in one on whether this is not so act when they occur that i never have 

00:04:33.089 --> 00:04:33.900
 seen how tight 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.800
 People inside their subject understand the BDA is doing well on YouTube 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.960
 and because they are worth a click 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.430
 to look at the club 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.970
 but they generate pension question, we start the same example percent the 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:47.060
 first big race 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.980
 The Council I knew at Barumer for the PlayStation worldwide 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:53.400
 decided and not fair André control or even the PC 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.350
 he suddenly had a sensitive time so of course I have to me 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:59.669
 traditionally brought the critical part 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:03.650
 the PC on the jetties so that you can not come to terms with Jan Unruh 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.169
 I was not aware of the applicant 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:09.040
 Brady Expo XXI as today for the online service just not pure and 

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:12.419
 I'm probably with soon in my next Xbox to 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:14.420
 and I think so well 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:17.220
 for four five six euros for new services »Months I show now too 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:18.629
 not the world but anyway 

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:20.759
 Reichwein Semmer too much and he thinks 

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:25.089
 Victory I did not know if the liver would have renounced the Bergamter 

00:05:25.089 --> 00:05:28.689
 meanwhile lie the West has hit me already it will continue 

00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:31.129
 was had until now 

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:34.589
 and is the next question and that of FC 2011 

00:05:34.589 --> 00:05:38.029
 Kantar what do you want for Modern Warfare 3 some opinion shit that 

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:39.259
 is it in question 

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:42.720
 it just needs protection to answer that yes well that he now completely 

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:44.360
 superficially still fix it 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.099
 Modern Warfare 3 is getting tough 

00:05:46.099 --> 00:05:50.340
 a Kyi a generally more smaller Nextel at assets Chen please people 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:53.630

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:55.770
 everyone else would be great and that's what they are 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:57.139
 Penalty gambler 

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:01.430
 the 8 March a Lex Kehlmann "You can see it in the team talk JPY the team 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:04.020
 At the moment this map is just shit 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.560
 and then the food appeared more boats weapons are also in a better mood 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:07.999
 are 

00:06:07.999 --> 00:06:11.039
 many more different weapons are not like the ones in Black Ops again after that 

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:12.389
 Principle only to the looks 

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:15.389
 and strangely leaking from the behaviors we treasure 

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:18.509
 variable 

00:06:18.509 --> 00:06:19.409
 everyone 

00:06:19.409 --> 00:06:22.739
 can exercise his personal property and still no disadvantage 

00:06:22.739 --> 00:06:24.039
 just off 

00:06:24.039 --> 00:06:28.409
 So then quickly the last question 2 Although you can ski to 6 90 you have 

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:29.590
 have had a good time 

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:31.400
 that pleased Ferienlagers 

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.080
 Pratt with the app 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:35.050
 I've never been against a complete lie 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:38.280
 I love my Bernd will be too expensive that I beat against it 

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:42.190
 would therefore not one and a half and the usual now already with a 

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:43.039
 Beamer Tel 

00:06:43.039 --> 00:06:46.089
 because there first and packs one to one 

00:06:46.089 --> 00:06:47.360

00:06:49.039 --> 00:06:51.210

 for the next eddy cue we send 

00:06:58.250 --> 00:06:59.680
 otherwise never lack of questions 

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:03.310
 Do not forget Facebook long ago to look over I let myself with the 

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:04.680
 Place and from a ladder
