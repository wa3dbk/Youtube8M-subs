00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.180
 sooner or later you have to get in 

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:05.770
 his life with the interest calculation 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:07.569
 because at the latest when you enter 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:11.490
 want to create a savings account is it 

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:11.490
 helpful to know interest 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.770
 The interest calculation differs from 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.330
 the percentage calculation actually almost 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.039
 not because of the general formula 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.599
 works exactly the same place 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:26.060
 basic value, however, speaks of 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:28.550
 Capital instead of percentage value of interest 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.619
 or just from the interest and 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.980
 City percentage says one interest rate 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:35.960
 otherwise everything is the same normally 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.930
 So you have a given capital 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.940
 For example, 250 euros and knows how 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.710
 So the interest rate is high when you are 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.989
 mostly calculate the interest 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:48.679
 this leads to the exit formula 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:50.839
 z is equal came through as follows 

00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:52.670
 Of course you can do this formula 

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:54.409
 so that you can change the capital too 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.749
 can calculate which one for a 

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:58.640
 must invest certain interest value the 

00:00:56.749 --> 00:01:00.230
 Calculate interest rate is actually 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.719
 total nonsense but of course you can 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.070
 the same with this formula 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:05.720
 one masters the equivalence of transformation 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.550
 By the way, if one of the 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.380
 then know formulas then you can easily 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.060
 to shape 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:14.479
 Everything is nice and good but what exactly are 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.070
 Interest actually you want the 250 euro 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:18.170
 that you got for the birthday 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.240
 savings can be made to a bank 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.469
 that's where you put the money there 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.140
 on an account 

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:25.700
 Thank you the bank for it with interest ever 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.920
 after how much money you invest there 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.899
 you get a cash amount as an addition 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.030
 the smaller the capital the smaller 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:34.640
 Interest rates are always hanging, too 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:37.280
 The interest rates are deducted from the bank 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.950
 so do not give you much money though 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.149
 after all, the interest formula applies by the way 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.950
 not for every country 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:44.359
 in Germany this is the general one 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.960
 formula for a whole year 

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:47.539
 refers 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.189
 So you have 250 euros for the first of January 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:51.469
 on your account and want to know how 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:53.630
 many are paying you until 31 december 

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:58.280
 then you can get this general 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:02:00.859
 formulaic use z is equal to 250 times 15 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:04.429
 by 100 your bank grants you so 

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:07.969
 interest of 15 percent of its capital 

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:09.170
 3 euros 75 are not much but these 

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:11.650
 interest rates will return in the next year 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.239
 interest and so on 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.909
 But what happens when you go to 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:17.920
 nine months, the 250 euros again 

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:19.840
 because the interest formula for a year 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.900
 you calculate the monthly interest 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:27.489
 with a slightly modified formula z 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:29.349
 is easy came hp times m by 100 x 12 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:31.269
 here you have in the counter and in January 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:34.000
 something adds to the one then m 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:35.859
 that stands for months so here you go 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.450
 simply the number of months one for the 

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:39.939
 the interest should be calculated 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.159
 and since one year has twelve months 

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:43.750
 you have a 12 in January so you have 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:47.280
 already after nine months the money 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:49.870
 again, you only receive two euros 81 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.209
 and what do you do when you're in the middle of it? 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.129
 Month money stands out in such a case 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.079
 is there daily interest here is the 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:58.389
 however, interest rates are usually lower 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:59.799
 but still stay with the 15 percent 

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:01.720
 the nice thing about it 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:04.889
 the formula is almost the same as for the 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:07.840
 Monthly Interest Z is easily kxbxt 

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:09.970
 by 100 x 360 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.400
 This time there is a tea instead of a m 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.879
 and the c stands for days that was not 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.419
 so hard 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:18.489
 in january is now 360 okay that is 

00:03:16.419 --> 00:03:22.930
 certainly the days but has a year 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:25.540
 but 365 or 366 days is true 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.190
 Banks always calculate with 360 days 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.190
 no matter if it's a year of switching 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.260
 or not we raise our 250th 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.329
 euro already after 77 days from 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:37.090
 We only receive 80 cents interest 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:38.560
 you realize it's getting less and less though 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.329
 is also very logical cheeks want 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.799
 keep you as a customer and therefore 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:43.930
 lure you with better interest rates 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:46.449
 the longer you spend your money and ever 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.319
 Your capital is higher than that in the first place 

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:48.970
 like in school 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:51.069
 Give me your homework in time 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.870
 From then everything is great if not then 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:54.909
 the teacher complains and this complains 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.500
 are then the interest merely are unfortunately 

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:58.930
 no interest you like 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.430
 Such interest even know because banks 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.799
 you do not always give money to the bank 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.540
 sometimes you also feel which one 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:06.430
 So takes a so-called credit 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.810
 In doing so, the bank is putting money into it 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.389
 that one after a certain 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.889
 time to pay back and as 

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:13.120
 thank you then suddenly gets the 

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:15.579
 Bank interest from you 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.349
 Well and they are always higher than that 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:19.989
 interest you get from the bank if 

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:23.669
 her there was money invested 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:23.669
 but they are still exactly the same
