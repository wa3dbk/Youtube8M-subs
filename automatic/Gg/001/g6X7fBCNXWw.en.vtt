00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080 
this one it looks like I'm in a pretty

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.650 
this one it looks like I'm in a pretty
good<00:05:20.200> position<00:05:20.440> but<00:05:21.010> you<00:05:21.880> know<00:05:21.970> unless<00:05:22.330> you're

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:22.660 
good position but you know unless you're

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:26.310 
good position but you know unless you're
so<00:05:22.960> open<00:05:23.440> you<00:05:23.680> have<00:05:23.830> inventory<00:05:24.750> full<00:05:25.750> of<00:05:26.050> you
