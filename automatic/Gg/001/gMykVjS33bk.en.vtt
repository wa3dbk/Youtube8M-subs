typical is going to Navy on the site
yeah<00:00:57.840> i<00:00:57.870> think<00:00:58.080> the<00:00:58.440> simplicity<00:00:59.310> of<00:00:59.340> the

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
yeah i think the simplicity of the

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.080 
yeah i think the simplicity of the
design<00:00:59.700> you<00:01:00.330> know<00:01:00.360> we've<00:01:00.660> not<00:01:00.870> done<00:01:01.140> gross

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.090 
design you know we've not done gross

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.189 
design you know we've not done gross
ornamentation<00:01:03.090> on<00:01:03.240> it<00:01:03.420> we<00:01:03.660> don't<00:01:03.840> use

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
ornamentation on it we don't use

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.040 
ornamentation on it we don't use

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:07.050 
brightwork overtly on this vehicle we

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.500 
brightwork overtly on this vehicle we
use<00:01:07.290> this<00:01:07.580> philosophy<00:01:08.580> we<00:01:08.880> use<00:01:09.090> this<00:01:09.270> ice

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
use this philosophy we use this ice

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.330 
use this philosophy we use this ice
block<00:01:09.960> philosophy<00:01:10.560> that<00:01:10.710> we've<00:01:10.890> been<00:01:11.040> saying

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
block philosophy that we've been saying

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.210 
block philosophy that we've been saying
in<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.390> detail<00:01:12.810> so<00:01:13.170> we're<00:01:13.620> trying<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:14.070> bring

through some unique ways of interpreting

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.190 
through some unique ways of interpreting
Scandinavian<00:01:17.670> design<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:18.420> how<00:01:18.750> do<00:01:18.810> you<00:01:18.900> think
