 stronger and video because i have 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.420
 a little bit under the voice because I 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.540
 decided to get sick and how would today 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.519
 Video answers to the questions before 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.230
 start answering your question i would like 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.380
 thank you so much for 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.000
 you are already 2000 it is very nice it is very 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.189
 thank you so much 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.660
 but let's get down to questions 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.939
 Do not delay the video as I love it 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.740
 do the first poll why did you decide 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:33.930
 shoot a video decided to shoot a video 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:36.329
 because I do not know why 1 video you 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.070
 was shot absolutely spontaneous just 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.020
 I decided to try to remove I have the same 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.690
 there is a camera camera yes i think to me 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.270
 it will be necessary to somehow remove all the same but 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.629
 I decided to try 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:52.910
 somehow the first pancake didn't come up first 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:55.739
 lumpy to put it mildly but six months later 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:58.199
 six months absence six months later 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.379
 absence I shot another video 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.300
 I understand that you don’t know so-so 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.670
 then another more 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.310
 and then I understood why I was shooting a video and 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:12.180
 why the fact is that when lost weight and 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:15.299
 when she stopped judging me very much 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:18.119
 I wanted to find a man attacked by youtube 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:22.170
 which seems to have problems 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.520
 who lost who suffered from the diet and from 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.380
 your desires and aspirations 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.620
 I always wanted to find such a blogger 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.840
 a teenager is desirable 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.880
 the song implies the next question 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.390
 do i know the dance of the rubak who has lost weight 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:38.870
 10 kg yes I know but it's a little 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:41.630
 not like that then how she is an adult 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:44.150
 girl she shoot serious videos 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:47.510
 professional videos and here's something 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:49.880
 some sukhenka for me and i'm filming 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:53.570
 videos are the ones that I would like to myself 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:56.690
 see then i'm the one whose blogger 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.850
 I wanted to find earlier, I don’t know 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.340
 clear explained no but something like this 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.460
 if the mother wanted to inspect herself 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.110
 one could not find 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:09.730
 the next question was the very first 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:12.860
 diet is the very first diet as I said 

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:15.110
 in the first video it was a tomato diet 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.950
 third question that neither has to do not 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.070
 gain weight 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.750
 then everything is strictly individually absolutely 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:23.680
 just because someone is recovering from 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:27.230
 someone's cheese from someone's chocolate 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.960
 sweet cotton candy I don't know well here 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.000
 need to proceed and situations that is 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:34.190
 follow what you often eat from 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.830
 harmfulness on the situation if you ate 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.170
 Sally recovered that case, the type of cheese 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.970
 the fourth question is how to lose weight when 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:44.120
 low weight and what to do if weight 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:46.970
 worth it with your weight just need 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.570
 ask why do you need to lose weight up for 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.950
 beginnings 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:53.900
 and what if the weight is worth I would 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:56.570
 I tried to arrange a cheating one 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.700
 the day that is breaking through the internet 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:01.580
 it would try to see that 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.650
 there is weight going up if weight goes up 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.900
 that is, a mini gaper would suit 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.000
 if from rose and I would try 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.580
 lose weight and he was gone then I would have 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.519
 scouring the internet how to disperse it 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.050
 substances but i like i would do 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:15.800
 got settled in arrange and cons 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:18.430
 fenders 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.560
 for one day no more please 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.319
 here and then based on the situation 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:26.319
 I finished watching that is, if the weight does not go away 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:28.359
 again then i'm already looking at the next 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:30.430
 the question is what do I sit on a diet and when 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:31.870
 in 100 out of bed dizzy this 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.819
 absolutely normal 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.010
 I think because I have it so even 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:38.019
 I do not sit on a diet is easily explained 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.189
 the fact that just insufficient inflow 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:41.500
 blood to the brain 

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:43.180
 if you are worried about and the environment only 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.920
 when you are on this diet 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.590
 have you sit on and are you kids 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.540
 only yes you are on this diet then i 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.780
 would contact does not mean that something is not right and 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:54.790
 if you were there whirling even outside 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.040
 depending on whether different figures 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.599
 no, it's kinda normal if they 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.579
 don't you worry they don't last for 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:02.290
 an hour or two on the sixth question where 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:04.269
 going to speak going to 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.669
 go to medical college I was 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:09.519
 another question who are you going to speak 

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:10.870
 that is, what do you want to become? I want to become 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:13.180
 they have a crap chest and debt or 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.980
 the psychotherapist for a minute also see what 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.840
 whether it will work out 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.220
 after medical college if i 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.130
 i will do the same i'm going to go 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:24.010
 Medical Institute and I hope that she has 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:26.320
 something will turn out and see what 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:29.110
 will be the next question and consumed 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:31.659
 diet pills got for such 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.220
 sins I told them the video in the first and from 

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:35.289
 This look, please, it's just 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.870
 just atas just then people themselves 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:39.460
 used diet pills 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.060
 Yes, I wanted to make a note about it, even 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.000
 separate 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:44.980
 but somehow I don’t know the next question 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.320
 how are your classmates to 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:49.570
 what are you shooting video many of my 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.550

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:01.720
 don't need nobody laughs and as it were in 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:03.280
 principle respect you laugh they would 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.560
 this did not make a combo 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.940
 I know my classmates all 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:10.180
 normal guys and 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:13.540
 as if for nothing to laugh it is stupid and 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:15.310
 they understand that why all 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:17.860
 calm very often asked question 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:22.000

 you are allowed to fill it happened 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.540
 such situation 

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:27.490
 a turning point in my life is possible 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:32.020

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:33.700
 partially at home and consciousness and I have long 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.479
 stare at this tattoo went 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.820

 my every decision is made because 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:55.680
 I will not create garbage in principle 

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:57.580
 I don't do something that doesn't make sense 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.270
 tattoo for me has a huge 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:00.460
 value 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:01.840
 she carries great meaning always 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:04.000
 she for me it means a lot 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:07.060

 I like the disease I don't know why 

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:26.560
 I like it when the book is written 

00:06:24.039 --> 00:06:28.450
 from a man who is a bar and 

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:30.160
 here when he says that with him 

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:31.110
