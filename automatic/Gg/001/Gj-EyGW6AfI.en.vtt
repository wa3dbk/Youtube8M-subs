00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
disease what I'm discovering is that

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.920 
disease what I'm discovering is that
there's<00:01:49.649> so<00:01:49.950> many<00:01:50.100> different<00:01:50.430> components

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
there's so many different components

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.889 
there's so many different components
genetic<00:01:51.930> familial<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:53.130> I<00:01:53.220> think<00:01:53.460> in<00:01:53.899> 10-15

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
genetic familial and I think in 10-15

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.170 
genetic familial and I think in 10-15
years<00:01:55.200> where<00:01:55.830> all<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.250> cat<00:01:56.460> diagnostic

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.639 
years where all the cat diagnostic
categories<00:01:57.660> and<00:01:57.810> currently<00:01:58.080> have<00:01:58.290> them<00:01:58.500> be

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
categories and currently have them be

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.699 
categories and currently have them be
significantly<00:01:59.310> modified<00:01:59.820> based<00:02:00.090> on<00:02:00.360> on<00:02:01.110> the

00:02:01.699 --> 00:02:01.709 
significantly modified based on on the

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:04.010 
significantly modified based on on the
genetic<00:02:02.100> aspects<00:02:02.610> of<00:02:02.670> things<00:02:02.970> I<00:02:03.240> came<00:02:03.660> because

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
genetic aspects of things I came because

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.710 
genetic aspects of things I came because
this<00:02:04.470> is<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.770> new<00:02:04.920> a<00:02:05.220> new<00:02:05.700> thing<00:02:06.179> in<00:02:06.300> medicine

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
this is the new a new thing in medicine

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:14.790 
this is the new a new thing in medicine
I'm<00:02:07.020> going<00:02:07.140> to<00:02:07.229> keep<00:02:07.410> up<00:02:07.590> with<00:02:07.619> it

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.570 

I<00:02:16.110> think<00:02:17.110> that<00:02:17.380> all<00:02:17.620> the<00:02:17.890> doctors<00:02:18.280> that<00:02:18.430> are

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
I think that all the doctors that are

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.330 
I think that all the doctors that are
here<00:02:18.760> going<00:02:19.090> to<00:02:19.450> really<00:02:20.080> feel<00:02:20.320> like<00:02:20.590> they<00:02:20.830> walk

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
here going to really feel like they walk

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.670 
here going to really feel like they walk
away<00:02:21.670> with<00:02:22.000> so<00:02:22.360> many<00:02:22.480> more<00:02:22.720> skills<00:02:23.140> than<00:02:23.350> they

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
away with so many more skills than they

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.490 
away with so many more skills than they
came<00:02:23.920> in<00:02:24.100> with<00:02:24.340> and<00:02:25.030> for<00:02:25.810> something<00:02:26.380> like

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
came in with and for something like

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.590
