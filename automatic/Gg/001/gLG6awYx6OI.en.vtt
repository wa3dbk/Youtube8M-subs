awesome gaming rig it's not a

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
pretty good configuration so I can't

thing<00:01:27.750> performs<00:01:28.500> now<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.520> case<00:01:29.759> itself<00:01:30.119> i'm

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
thing performs now the case itself i'm

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.999 
thing performs now the case itself i'm
not<00:01:30.509> very<00:01:30.600> thrilled<00:01:30.990> about<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.350> case<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.890> be

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
not very thrilled about the case to be

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.109 
not very thrilled about the case to be
honest<00:01:32.420> it's<00:01:33.420> not<00:01:33.630> bad<00:01:33.869> layout<00:01:34.350> of<00:01:34.710> it<00:01:35.130> but<00:01:35.670> i

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
honest it's not bad layout of it but i

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.640 
honest it's not bad layout of it but i
think<00:01:36.420> they<00:01:36.509> could<00:01:36.689> have<00:01:36.780> gone<00:01:37.200> a<00:01:37.259> little<00:01:37.470> bit

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
think they could have gone a little bit

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.819 
think they could have gone a little bit
larger<00:01:38.250> on<00:01:38.400> this<00:01:38.909> case<00:01:39.240> ok<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.439> i'll<00:01:40.560> tell<00:01:40.799> you

you<00:01:54.090> can<00:01:54.210> see<00:01:54.240> there's<00:01:54.509> two<00:01:54.659> cages<00:01:55.170> that<00:01:55.350> you

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
you can see there's two cages that you

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.280 
you can see there's two cages that you
just<00:01:55.799> unlatch

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
just unlatch

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.260 
just unlatch
and<00:01:57.860> then<00:01:58.010> you<00:01:58.070> just<00:01:58.220> pull<00:01:58.430> it<00:01:58.550> out<00:01:58.640> okay<00:01:59.120> just

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
and then you just pull it out okay just

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.960 
and then you just pull it out okay just
pull<00:01:59.480> that<00:01:59.510> out<00:01:59.660> and<00:01:59.780> just<00:02:00.050> slap<00:02:00.920> your<00:02:00.970> hard

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
pull that out and just slap your hard

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.060 
pull that out and just slap your hard
drive<00:02:02.180> in<00:02:02.330> there<00:02:02.540> and<00:02:02.750> then<00:02:03.200> just<00:02:03.800> put<00:02:03.980> it

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
drive in there and then just put it

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.710 
drive in there and then just put it
right<00:02:04.100> back<00:02:04.370> in<00:02:04.430> there<00:02:04.760> and<00:02:04.940> it<00:02:05.240> connects<00:02:05.540> to

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
right back in there and it connects to

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.020 
right back in there and it connects to
the<00:02:05.840> SATA<00:02:06.230> connectors<00:02:06.710> automatically<00:02:07.400> okay

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
the SATA connectors automatically okay

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.780 
the SATA connectors automatically okay
so<00:02:08.090> this<00:02:08.720> is<00:02:08.899> very<00:02:09.110> nice<00:02:09.290> setup<00:02:10.280> there<00:02:10.610> if

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:10.790 
so this is very nice setup there if

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:13.000 
so this is very nice setup there if
you're<00:02:11.030> you<00:02:11.840> know<00:02:11.960> exchanging<00:02:12.530> hard<00:02:12.740> drives

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
you're you know exchanging hard drives

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.440 
you're you know exchanging hard drives
and<00:02:13.280> backing<00:02:13.640> things<00:02:13.790> up<00:02:14.000> and<00:02:14.210> you<00:02:14.270> want<00:02:14.390> to

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
and backing things up and you want to

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.260 
and backing things up and you want to
swap<00:02:14.690> things<00:02:14.990> back<00:02:15.200> and<00:02:15.380> forth<00:02:15.470> so<00:02:16.270> definitely

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
swap things back and forth so definitely

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.250 
swap things back and forth so definitely
very<00:02:18.050> nice<00:02:18.260> some<00:02:19.420> configuration<00:02:20.420> for<00:02:21.050> this

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
very nice some configuration for this

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.200 
very nice some configuration for this
mid<00:02:21.620> tower<00:02:21.830> case<00:02:21.950> usually<00:02:22.490> see<00:02:22.910> these<00:02:23.060> on

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.210 
mid tower case usually see these on

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:26.950 
mid tower case usually see these on
larger<00:02:23.570> cases<00:02:23.990> so<00:02:24.530> not<00:02:25.040> bad<00:02:25.630> taking<00:02:26.630> another

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960 
larger cases so not bad taking another

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.210 
larger cases so not bad taking another
look<00:02:27.110> there<00:02:27.320> on<00:02:27.410> the<00:02:27.500> other<00:02:27.620> side<00:02:27.860> of<00:02:27.890> the<00:02:28.010> case

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
look there on the other side of the case

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.550 
look there on the other side of the case
no<00:02:28.700> window<00:02:29.090> okay<00:02:29.780> I<00:02:29.959> would<00:02:30.290> have<00:02:30.380> liked<00:02:30.530> that

no window okay I would have liked that
to<00:02:31.130> be<00:02:31.250> a<00:02:31.280> little<00:02:31.430> bit<00:02:31.520> larger<00:02:31.730> though<00:02:32.060> because

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
to be a little bit larger though because

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.060 
to be a little bit larger though because
that<00:02:32.540> cable<00:02:32.900> management<00:02:33.080> in<00:02:33.470> there<00:02:33.650> on<00:02:33.890> that

back<00:03:35.989> that<00:03:36.290> you<00:03:36.350> can't<00:03:36.620> see<00:03:36.920> okay<00:03:37.340> because

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
back that you can't see okay because

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.360 
back that you can't see okay because
it's<00:03:37.760> not<00:03:37.850> a<00:03:37.910> modular<00:03:38.720> power<00:03:38.930> supply<00:03:39.370> anyways

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
it's not a modular power supply anyways

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.259 
it's not a modular power supply anyways
looking<00:03:41.120> at<00:03:41.239> the<00:03:41.390> gtx<00:03:42.080> 570<00:03:42.680> it<00:03:42.830> uses<00:03:43.160> two<00:03:43.430> 6-pin

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269 
looking at the gtx 570 it uses two 6-pin

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:46.630 
looking at the gtx 570 it uses two 6-pin
power<00:03:44.630> connectors<00:03:45.200> keep<00:03:45.440> that<00:03:45.620> in<00:03:45.709> mind<00:03:45.920> okay

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 
power connectors keep that in mind okay

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.449 
power connectors keep that in mind okay
and<00:03:47.320> of<00:03:48.320> course<00:03:48.410> we've<00:03:48.680> got<00:03:48.799> water<00:03:49.010> cooling

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 
and of course we've got water cooling

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:51.520 
and of course we've got water cooling
going<00:03:49.670> on<00:03:49.790> here<00:03:50.030> which<00:03:50.150> is<00:03:50.299> terrific<00:03:50.450> my<00:03:51.200> first

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
going on here which is terrific my first

review<00:03:51.769> of<00:03:51.980> the<00:03:52.070> cyber<00:03:52.280> cyber<00:03:52.790> power<00:03:53.120> system

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
review of the cyber cyber power system

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.170 
review of the cyber cyber power system
they<00:03:53.989> had<00:03:54.200> a<00:03:54.440> similar<00:03:54.980> water<00:03:55.790> cooling

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
they had a similar water cooling

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.020 
they had a similar water cooling
configuration<00:03:56.870> so<00:03:57.530> this<00:03:58.130> is<00:03:58.250> very<00:03:58.370> nice<00:03:58.640> here

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
configuration so this is very nice here

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.420 
configuration so this is very nice here
this<00:03:59.239> is<00:03:59.299> going<00:03:59.420> to<00:03:59.480> keep<00:03:59.630> the<00:03:59.930> CPU<00:04:00.650> very<00:04:00.920> cool

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
this is going to keep the CPU very cool

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.190 
this is going to keep the CPU very cool
hopefully<00:04:01.970> we'll<00:04:02.180> be<00:04:02.450> able<00:04:02.480> to<00:04:02.750> overclock<00:04:03.080> it

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
hopefully we'll be able to overclock it

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.449 
hopefully we'll be able to overclock it

the top of the case you've got to
120<00:04:11.390> millimeter<00:04:11.750> fans<00:04:12.020> so<00:04:12.260> we've<00:04:12.380> got<00:04:12.470> lots<00:04:12.710> of

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
120 millimeter fans so we've got lots of

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.540 
quiet the only noise you're going to get
is<00:04:17.209> from<00:04:17.360> that<00:04:17.630> video<00:04:18.080> card<00:04:18.440> obviously<00:04:18.980> that's
