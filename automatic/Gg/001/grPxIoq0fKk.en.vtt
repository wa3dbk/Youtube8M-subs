for this set as I figure the way the
beavers<00:05:37.120> are<00:05:37.240> coming<00:05:37.479> and<00:05:37.539> working<00:05:37.870> this<00:05:37.990> they

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:38.320 
beavers are coming and working this they

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.800 
beavers are coming and working this they
probably<00:05:38.470> got<00:05:38.770> the<00:05:38.889> front<00:05:39.160> feet<00:05:40.030> full<00:05:40.330> so

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:40.810 
probably got the front feet full so

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:42.300 
probably got the front feet full so
they're<00:05:41.229> coming<00:05:41.440> in<00:05:41.650> with<00:05:41.800> the<00:05:41.889> front<00:05:42.070> feet

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:42.310 
they're coming in with the front feet

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:43.650 
they're coming in with the front feet
full<00:05:42.550> and<00:05:42.669> their<00:05:42.759> back<00:05:42.970> feeds<00:05:43.300> what's<00:05:43.479> going

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:43.660 
full and their back feeds what's going

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:45.270 
full and their back feeds what's going
to<00:05:43.690> touch<00:05:44.199> down<00:05:44.229> first<00:05:44.680> so<00:05:44.860> I'm<00:05:44.949> setting<00:05:45.220> the

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:45.280 
to touch down first so I'm setting the

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.100 
to touch down first so I'm setting the
trap<00:05:45.520> back<00:05:45.729> a<00:05:45.759> little<00:05:46.000> bit<00:05:46.120> farther<00:05:46.330> and<00:05:46.660> a

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:47.110 
trap back a little bit farther and a

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:53.700 
trap back a little bit farther and a
little<00:05:47.289> bit<00:05:47.410> deeper<00:05:52.110> that's<00:05:53.110> a<00:05:53.199> nice<00:05:53.380> big<00:05:53.590> old

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:53.710 
little bit deeper that's a nice big old

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:57.779 
little bit deeper that's a nice big old
flat<00:05:53.919> tail<00:05:54.130> there<00:05:56.220> we're<00:05:57.220> back<00:05:57.400> here<00:05:57.610> at<00:05:57.669> our

00:05:57.779 --> 00:05:57.789 
flat tail there we're back here at our

00:05:57.789 --> 00:06:01.379 
flat tail there we're back here at our
live<00:05:58.030> set<00:05:58.389> I<00:05:58.660> can<00:05:59.020> see<00:05:59.500> the<00:06:00.190> traps<00:06:00.520> gone<00:06:00.820> down

00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:01.389 
live set I can see the traps gone down

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:08.189 
live set I can see the traps gone down
the<00:06:01.599> down<00:06:02.110> the<00:06:02.729> rebar<00:06:03.729> so<00:06:06.780> we'll<00:06:07.780> pull<00:06:07.990> it<00:06:08.080> up

00:06:08.189 --> 00:06:08.199 
the down the rebar so we'll pull it up

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:16.920 
the down the rebar so we'll pull it up
and<00:06:08.349> see<00:06:08.410> what<00:06:08.650> we<00:06:08.740> got<00:06:14.820> feels<00:06:15.820> heavy<00:06:16.060> that's<00:06:16.810> a

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:16.930 
and see what we got feels heavy that's a

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:24.430 
and see what we got feels heavy that's a
good<00:06:17.080> time<00:06:17.349> oh<00:06:19.530> yeah

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:24.440 

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.700 

got<00:06:25.160> a<00:06:25.190> nice<00:06:25.460> full<00:06:26.360> back<00:06:26.750> foot<00:06:27.140> catch<00:06:27.410> right

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:27.710 
got a nice full back foot catch right

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:38.530 
got a nice full back foot catch right
there<00:06:34.090> and<00:06:35.090> that's<00:06:35.300> a<00:06:35.480> small<00:06:35.630> beaver<00:06:37.540> probably

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:38.540 
there and that's a small beaver probably

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:41.230 
there and that's a small beaver probably
a<00:06:38.570> young<00:06:39.380> of<00:06:39.620> Lattin<00:06:40.220> younger<00:06:40.550> this<00:06:40.670> year<00:06:41.030> and

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:41.240 
a young of Lattin younger this year and

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.300 
a young of Lattin younger this year and
that's<00:06:42.080> one<00:06:42.260> thing<00:06:42.470> that<00:06:42.530> you<00:06:42.680> got<00:06:42.890> to<00:06:43.010> keep<00:06:43.040> in

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:43.310 
that's one thing that you got to keep in

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:46.240 
that's one thing that you got to keep in
mind<00:06:43.490> whenever<00:06:43.790> you're<00:06:44.060> trapping<00:06:44.330> around<00:06:45.250> the

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:46.250 
mind whenever you're trapping around the

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:49.180 
mind whenever you're trapping around the
dens<00:06:46.730> or<00:06:46.850> lodges<00:06:47.420> is<00:06:47.630> that<00:06:48.050> the<00:06:48.710> closer<00:06:48.950> you

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:49.190 
dens or lodges is that the closer you

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:51.220 
dens or lodges is that the closer you
get<00:06:49.310> to<00:06:49.370> the<00:06:49.580> lodge<00:06:49.760> the<00:06:50.240> more<00:06:50.630> likelihood

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:51.230 
get to the lodge the more likelihood

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:52.900 
get to the lodge the more likelihood
that<00:06:51.260> you're<00:06:51.530> going<00:06:51.650> to<00:06:51.680> catch<00:06:51.950> a<00:06:52.220> smaller

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:52.910 
that you're going to catch a smaller

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:54.700 
that you're going to catch a smaller
beaver<00:06:53.240> so<00:06:54.020> if<00:06:54.110> you're<00:06:54.260> really<00:06:54.500> targeting

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:54.710 
beaver so if you're really targeting

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:57.490 
beaver so if you're really targeting
Strictly<00:06:55.610> fur<00:06:55.850> or<00:06:56.210> something<00:06:56.510> like<00:06:56.630> that<00:06:56.690> you

00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:57.500 
Strictly fur or something like that you

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.020 
Strictly fur or something like that you
want<00:06:57.620> to<00:06:57.710> be<00:06:57.830> away<00:06:58.070> from<00:06:58.130> the<00:06:58.430> lines<00:06:58.640> now<00:06:58.940> if

00:06:59.020 --> 00:06:59.030 
want to be away from the lines now if

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:01.450 
want to be away from the lines now if
you're<00:06:59.150> trapping<00:06:59.630> for<00:06:59.960> damage<00:07:00.680> purposes<00:07:01.220> and

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:01.460 
you're trapping for damage purposes and

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:03.580 
you're trapping for damage purposes and
try<00:07:02.030> to<00:07:02.090> eliminate<00:07:02.330> the<00:07:02.720> Beavers<00:07:03.020> in<00:07:03.170> an<00:07:03.260> area

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:03.590 
try to eliminate the Beavers in an area

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:05.980 
try to eliminate the Beavers in an area
then<00:07:03.740> you<00:07:04.010> know<00:07:04.910> you<00:07:04.970> might<00:07:05.240> start<00:07:05.540> out<00:07:05.720> away

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:05.990 
then you know you might start out away

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:08.440 
then you know you might start out away
from<00:07:06.020> the<00:07:06.230> lodge<00:07:06.530> but<00:07:07.030> you're<00:07:08.030> going<00:07:08.180> to<00:07:08.240> wind

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:08.450 
from the lodge but you're going to wind

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:10.870 
from the lodge but you're going to wind
up<00:07:08.630> here<00:07:08.960> to<00:07:09.470> catch<00:07:09.680> these<00:07:09.920> last<00:07:10.160> few<00:07:10.460> smaller

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:10.880 
up here to catch these last few smaller

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:13.330 
up here to catch these last few smaller
beavers
