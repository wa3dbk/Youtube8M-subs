00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:02.450 

okay<00:00:01.079> so<00:00:01.140> let<00:00:01.530> explore<00:00:01.860> a<00:00:01.890> little<00:00:02.070> bit<00:00:02.220> about

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
okay so let explore a little bit about

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.079 
okay so let explore a little bit about
the<00:00:02.700> computer<00:00:03.330> the<00:00:03.689> main<00:00:03.870> computer<00:00:04.200> for<00:00:04.500> the

00:00:05.079 --> 00:00:05.089 
the computer the main computer for the

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:11.330 
the computer the main computer for the
reprap<00:00:06.919> style<00:00:09.440> vision<00:00:10.440> 3d<00:00:10.740> printer<00:00:11.099> and<00:00:11.309> what

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
reprap style vision 3d printer and what

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.299 
reprap style vision 3d printer and what
we<00:00:11.910> have<00:00:12.120> here<00:00:12.599> is<00:00:12.750> a<00:00:12.809> stack<00:00:13.620> of<00:00:13.650> computer

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
we have here is a stack of computer

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:15.829 
we have here is a stack of computer
boards<00:00:14.610> if<00:00:15.059> you<00:00:15.120> look<00:00:15.299> there's<00:00:15.540> one<00:00:15.599> on<00:00:15.809> the

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
boards if you look there's one on the

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.210 
boards if you look there's one on the
bottom<00:00:15.990> there's<00:00:16.379> one<00:00:16.529> in<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:16.710> middle<00:00:16.890> and

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
bottom there's one in the middle and

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.279 
bottom there's one in the middle and
then<00:00:17.340> there's<00:00:17.550> five<00:00:18.420> of<00:00:18.449> them<00:00:18.779> on<00:00:18.900> this<00:00:19.080> one

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
then there's five of them on this one

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.349 
then there's five of them on this one
this<00:00:19.470> one's<00:00:19.680> for<00:00:19.890> a<00:00:19.949> dual<00:00:20.160> extruder<00:00:20.640> model<00:00:21.000> and

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
this one's for a dual extruder model and

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.920 
this one's for a dual extruder model and
so<00:00:22.039> basically<00:00:23.039> six<00:00:23.789> boards<00:00:24.090> here<00:00:24.359> or<00:00:24.510> seven

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
so basically six boards here or seven

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.050 
so basically six boards here or seven
boards<00:00:25.199> here<00:00:25.439> there<00:00:26.010> will<00:00:26.099> be<00:00:26.130> six<00:00:26.490> boards<00:00:26.760> if

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
boards here there will be six boards if

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.060 
boards here there will be six boards if
you<00:00:27.210> have<00:00:27.480> a<00:00:27.510> single<00:00:27.779> extruder<00:00:28.320> and<00:00:28.410> so<00:00:28.920> what

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
you have a single extruder and so what

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:29.990 
you have a single extruder and so what
we're<00:00:29.160> going<00:00:29.250> to<00:00:29.369> do<00:00:29.490> is<00:00:29.609> we're<00:00:29.760> going<00:00:29.880> to<00:00:29.939> take

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
we're going to do is we're going to take

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.429 
we're going to do is we're going to take
it<00:00:30.269> apart<00:00:30.539> because<00:00:30.750> you<00:00:30.960> kind<00:00:31.140> of<00:00:31.230> have<00:00:31.410> to

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
it apart because you kind of have to

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.440 
it apart because you kind of have to
take<00:00:31.800> it<00:00:31.920> apart<00:00:32.189> in<00:00:32.369> order<00:00:32.460> to<00:00:33.260> get<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:35.329> get<00:00:36.329> it

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
take it apart in order to get the get it

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.360 
take it apart in order to get the get it
mounted<00:00:36.570> to<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:36.899> machine<00:00:37.370> because

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
mounted to the machine because

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.639 
mounted to the machine because
unfortunately<00:00:38.610> they<00:00:39.420> leave<00:00:39.690> you<00:00:39.870> holes<00:00:40.350> up

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
unfortunately they leave you holes up

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:41.780 
unfortunately they leave you holes up
underneath<00:00:40.890> so<00:00:41.250> it's<00:00:41.370> very<00:00:41.489> very<00:00:41.760> difficult

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
underneath so it's very very difficult

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.420 
underneath so it's very very difficult
sometimes<00:00:42.540> so<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:43.800> then<00:00:43.890> on<00:00:44.040> top<00:00:44.219> of<00:00:44.280> that

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
sometimes so and then on top of that

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.790 
sometimes so and then on top of that
here's<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.910> plug<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.510> we<00:00:46.440> will<00:00:46.590> show<00:00:46.739> you

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
here's the plug and we will show you

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.610 
here's the plug and we will show you
later<00:00:47.039> how<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.940> use<00:00:48.450> that<00:00:48.690> plug<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:49.260> get<00:00:49.410> power

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
later how to use that plug to get power

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.600 
later how to use that plug to get power
to<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.160> main<00:00:50.489> board<00:00:50.730> so<00:00:51.480> then<00:00:51.719> here's<00:00:51.989> the

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:52.610 
to the main board so then here's the

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.689 
to the main board so then here's the
gist<00:00:53.610> your<00:00:53.820> serial<00:00:54.360> communications<00:00:55.230> for<00:00:55.469> the

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:55.699 
gist your serial communications for the

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:58.400 
gist your serial communications for the
computer<00:00:56.699> or<00:00:56.940> so<00:00:57.120> basically<00:00:57.989> there's<00:00:58.199> going

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
computer or so basically there's going

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.630 
computer or so basically there's going
to<00:00:58.469> be<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:58.559> lot<00:00:58.770> of<00:00:58.800> other<00:00:59.039> plugs<00:00:59.309> that<00:00:59.430> get

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
to be a lot of other plugs that get

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.069 
to be a lot of other plugs that get
plugged<00:00:59.850> in<00:01:00.000> here<00:01:00.210> but<00:01:00.539> right<00:01:00.690> now<00:01:00.840> we're<00:01:01.050> just

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
plugged in here but right now we're just

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.840 
plugged in here but right now we're just
going<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.410> you<00:01:01.739> know<00:01:01.829> explore<00:01:02.399> taking<00:01:02.760> this

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
going to you know explore taking this

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.520 
going to you know explore taking this
apart<00:01:03.180> because<00:01:03.510> we've<00:01:03.840> got<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.199> get<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.470> the

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
apart because we've got to get to the

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.080 
apart because we've got to get to the
back<00:01:04.739> of<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.920> board<00:01:05.129> in<00:01:05.280> order<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.580> get<00:01:05.729> it<00:01:05.850> so

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
back of the board in order to get it so

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.210 
back of the board in order to get it so
that<00:01:06.240> it<00:01:06.330> can<00:01:06.479> be<00:01:06.630> mounted<00:01:06.780> once<00:01:07.590> it's<00:01:07.799> a<00:01:07.920> part

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
that it can be mounted once it's a part

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.030 
that it can be mounted once it's a part
you<00:01:08.760> don't<00:01:08.850> actually<00:01:09.150> have<00:01:09.360> to<00:01:09.830> unless<00:01:10.830> you

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
you don't actually have to unless you

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.039 
you don't actually have to unless you
you<00:01:11.670> know<00:01:11.760> happen<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.180> get<00:01:12.330> very<00:01:12.540> unlucky<00:01:12.840> and

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
you know happen to get very unlucky and

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.289 
you know happen to get very unlucky and
you<00:01:13.280> unplugged<00:01:14.280> a<00:01:14.400> stepper<00:01:14.640> motor<00:01:14.909> while<00:01:15.119> it's

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
you unplugged a stepper motor while it's

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.170 
you unplugged a stepper motor while it's
powered<00:01:15.630> up<00:01:16.250> now<00:01:17.250> or<00:01:17.610> you<00:01:17.729> overdrive

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
powered up now or you overdrive

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.109 
powered up now or you overdrive
something<00:01:18.689> then<00:01:18.900> you<00:01:19.369> know<00:01:20.369> where<00:01:20.580> you<00:01:20.700> apply

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
something then you know where you apply

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.520 
something then you know where you apply
way<00:01:21.330> too<00:01:21.390> much<00:01:21.630> current<00:01:22.020> for<00:01:22.170> whatever<00:01:22.380> the

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
way too much current for whatever the

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.890 
way too much current for whatever the
motor<00:01:22.710> can<00:01:22.890> handle<00:01:23.280> it<00:01:23.970> should<00:01:24.509> be<00:01:24.659> able<00:01:24.750> to

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
motor can handle it should be able to

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.840 
motor can handle it should be able to
shut<00:01:25.080> down<00:01:25.259> but<00:01:25.560> once<00:01:25.799> in<00:01:25.920> a<00:01:25.950> while<00:01:26.100> you<00:01:26.369> might

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
shut down but once in a while you might

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.080 
shut down but once in a while you might
actually<00:01:27.060> lose<00:01:27.360> one<00:01:27.630> of<00:01:27.750> these<00:01:28.700> pololu<00:01:29.700> style

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
actually lose one of these pololu style

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.350 
actually lose one of these pololu style
stepper<00:01:31.020> motor<00:01:31.290> drivers<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:32.670> if<00:01:32.790> you<00:01:32.939> have<00:01:33.119> to

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
stepper motor drivers and if you have to

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.990 
stepper motor drivers and if you have to
you<00:01:33.600> can<00:01:33.780> actually<00:01:34.049> pull<00:01:34.229> them<00:01:34.439> off<00:01:34.759> it<00:01:35.759> takes

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
you can actually pull them off it takes

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.749 
you can actually pull them off it takes
a<00:01:36.090> little<00:01:36.270> bit<00:01:36.420> of<00:01:36.619> a<00:01:37.619> little<00:01:38.220> bit<00:01:38.340> of<00:01:38.430> power<00:01:38.640> to

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
a little bit of a little bit of power to

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.850 
a little bit of a little bit of power to
actually<00:01:39.060> pull<00:01:39.240> them<00:01:39.390> off<00:01:39.509> but<00:01:40.200> as<00:01:40.259> you<00:01:40.710> get

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
actually pull them off but as you get

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.069 
actually pull them off but as you get
one<00:01:41.130> site<00:01:41.369> going<00:01:41.700> then<00:01:42.240> you<00:01:42.689> just<00:01:42.899> keep

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
one site going then you just keep

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.550 
one site going then you just keep
wiggling<00:01:43.920> them<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:44.750> in<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.840> wintertime<00:01:46.110> it's

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
wiggling them and in the wintertime it's

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.319 
wiggling them and in the wintertime it's
kind<00:01:46.799> of<00:01:46.860> careful<00:01:47.340> that<00:01:47.850> you<00:01:48.000> don't<00:01:48.119> move

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
kind of careful that you don't move

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.539 
kind of careful that you don't move
around<00:01:48.479> a<00:01:48.869> lot<00:01:49.020> because<00:01:49.590> I<00:01:49.890> haven't<00:01:50.399> really

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
around a lot because I haven't really

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.600 
around a lot because I haven't really
known<00:01:51.119> to<00:01:51.329> many<00:01:51.479> people<00:01:51.840> actually<00:01:52.520> you<00:01:53.520> know

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
known to many people actually you know

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.370 
known to many people actually you know
shock<00:01:53.939> these<00:01:54.119> with<00:01:54.329> static<00:01:54.630> electricity<00:01:54.780> but

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
shock these with static electricity but

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.139 
shock these with static electricity but
in<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.770> wintertime<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.280> humidity<00:01:56.729> levels<00:01:57.090> a

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
in the wintertime the humidity levels a

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.999 
in the wintertime the humidity levels a
lot<00:01:57.299> lower<00:01:57.540> so<00:01:57.810> static<00:01:58.170> electricity<00:01:58.590> is<00:01:58.860> in

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
lot lower so static electricity is in

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.039 
lot lower so static electricity is in
there<00:01:59.130> so<00:01:59.490> you<00:01:59.549> can<00:01:59.790> see<00:02:00.060> this<00:02:00.630> actually

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
there so you can see this actually

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.800 
there so you can see this actually
starting<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:01.380> come<00:02:01.619> up<00:02:01.649> and<00:02:02.450> so<00:02:03.450> if<00:02:03.570> you<00:02:03.600> need

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
starting to come up and so if you need

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.530 
starting to come up and so if you need
to<00:02:03.990> you<00:02:04.320> can<00:02:04.350> just<00:02:04.530> pull<00:02:04.860> them<00:02:05.009> off<00:02:05.130> there<00:02:05.540> the

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
to you can just pull them off there the

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:07.910 
to you can just pull them off there the
one<00:02:06.750> thing<00:02:06.960> that<00:02:07.020> you<00:02:07.170> need<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.409> be<00:02:07.560> concerned

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
one thing that you need to be concerned

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.699 
one thing that you need to be concerned
about<00:02:08.129> you<00:02:08.789> know<00:02:08.819> never<00:02:09.360> ever<00:02:09.660> pull<00:02:10.470> them<00:02:10.590> off

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
about you know never ever pull them off

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.110 
about you know never ever pull them off
of<00:02:10.860> there<00:02:11.009> while<00:02:11.370> you<00:02:11.489> actually<00:02:11.760> have<00:02:11.849> power

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
of there while you actually have power

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.970 
of there while you actually have power
hooked<00:02:12.450> up<00:02:12.599> if<00:02:12.780> you<00:02:13.110> need<00:02:13.230> to<00:02:13.410> unplug

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
hooked up if you need to unplug

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.460 
hooked up if you need to unplug
the<00:02:14.099> power<00:02:14.310> plug<00:02:14.610> and<00:02:15.030> then<00:02:15.330> then<00:02:15.930> you're<00:02:16.110> safe

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
the power plug and then then you're safe

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.190 
the power plug and then then you're safe
but<00:02:17.190> you<00:02:17.340> need<00:02:17.519> to<00:02:17.700> make<00:02:17.849> sure<00:02:17.909> that<00:02:18.900> when<00:02:19.080> you

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
but you need to make sure that when you

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.380 
but you need to make sure that when you
put<00:02:19.440> this<00:02:19.650> back<00:02:19.920> on<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.280> board<00:02:20.549> that<00:02:20.879> the

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
put this back on the board that the

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.000 
put this back on the board that the
little<00:02:21.540> trim<00:02:21.900> pot<00:02:22.110> that<00:02:22.319> looks<00:02:22.530> like<00:02:22.650> a<00:02:22.680> really

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
little trim pot that looks like a really

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.880 
little trim pot that looks like a really
small<00:02:23.340> positive<00:02:23.760> sign<00:02:24.330> as<00:02:24.540> you're<00:02:25.470> looking<00:02:25.590> at

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
small positive sign as you're looking at

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.199 
small positive sign as you're looking at
the<00:02:25.950> board<00:02:26.159> this<00:02:26.310> way<00:02:26.489> is<00:02:26.700> always<00:02:26.819> on<00:02:27.120> the

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
the board this way is always on the

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:32.150 
the board this way is always on the
upside<00:02:27.980> and<00:02:30.049> you<00:02:31.049> don't<00:02:31.260> ever<00:02:31.500> do<00:02:31.739> this<00:02:31.769> when

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
upside and you don't ever do this when

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.660 
upside and you don't ever do this when
it's<00:02:32.310> powered<00:02:32.760> up<00:02:32.910> so<00:02:33.450> that<00:02:33.989> way<00:02:34.370> your<00:02:35.370> your

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
it's powered up so that way your your

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:36.979 
it's powered up so that way your your
board<00:02:35.879> gets<00:02:36.000> to<00:02:36.180> last<00:02:36.390> a<00:02:36.540> little<00:02:36.660> bit<00:02:36.750> longer

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
board gets to last a little bit longer

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.680 
board gets to last a little bit longer
and<00:02:37.920> it's<00:02:38.160> kind<00:02:38.340> of<00:02:38.400> a<00:02:38.519> tight<00:02:38.730> fit<00:02:39.150> to<00:02:39.450> get<00:02:39.569> it

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
and it's kind of a tight fit to get it

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.229 
and it's kind of a tight fit to get it
in<00:02:39.810> there<00:02:40.129> wiggle<00:02:41.129> it<00:02:41.220> around<00:02:41.280> and<00:02:41.640> you<00:02:42.000> push

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
in there wiggle it around and you push

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.899 
in there wiggle it around and you push
it<00:02:42.450> make<00:02:42.870> sure<00:02:42.900> it's<00:02:43.200> fully<00:02:43.409> seated<00:02:43.730> so<00:02:44.730> that

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:44.909 
it make sure it's fully seated so that

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:46.880 
it make sure it's fully seated so that
you<00:02:45.209> can't<00:02:45.510> really<00:02:45.870> actually<00:02:46.140> see<00:02:46.470> any<00:02:46.709> of<00:02:46.829> the

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
you can't really actually see any of the

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.520 
you can't really actually see any of the
pins<00:02:47.099> underneath<00:02:47.489> there<00:02:47.970> and<00:02:48.349> there<00:02:49.349> you<00:02:49.500> go

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
pins underneath there and there you go

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.970 
pins underneath there and there you go
on<00:02:50.280> this<00:02:50.970> board<00:02:51.329> we<00:02:51.750> actually<00:02:52.079> put<00:02:52.230> heatsinks

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
on this board we actually put heatsinks

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.339 
on this board we actually put heatsinks
already<00:02:53.310> on<00:02:53.430> the<00:02:53.579> board<00:02:53.760> and<00:02:54.090> what<00:02:54.989> that<00:02:55.170> does

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 
already on the board and what that does

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:57.860 
already on the board and what that does
is<00:02:55.410> allows<00:02:55.859> you<00:02:56.099> to<00:02:56.310> pull<00:02:57.269> a<00:02:57.299> little<00:02:57.629> bit<00:02:57.750> more

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
is allows you to pull a little bit more

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.319 
is allows you to pull a little bit more
juice<00:02:58.280> so<00:02:59.280> that<00:02:59.430> you<00:02:59.489> can<00:02:59.670> power<00:02:59.879> your<00:02:59.940> stepper

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:00.329 
juice so that you can power your stepper

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:02.170 
juice so that you can power your stepper
motor<00:03:00.569> drivers<00:03:00.959> a<00:03:00.989> little<00:03:01.379> bit<00:03:01.530> higher

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
motor drivers a little bit higher

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.220 
motor drivers a little bit higher
without<00:03:03.180> actually<00:03:03.690> shutting<00:03:03.900> them<00:03:04.079> down

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
without actually shutting them down

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.240 
without actually shutting them down
these<00:03:04.980> two<00:03:05.250> things<00:03:05.430> here<00:03:05.910> those<00:03:06.660> are<00:03:06.810> actually

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
these two things here those are actually

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.849 
these two things here those are actually
resettable<00:03:08.250> fuses<00:03:08.910> and<00:03:09.090> so<00:03:09.660> if<00:03:09.900> you<00:03:10.410> happen<00:03:10.560> to

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:10.859 
resettable fuses and so if you happen to

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:13.400 
resettable fuses and so if you happen to
do<00:03:11.040> trip<00:03:11.489> one<00:03:11.730> of<00:03:11.849> the<00:03:11.970> for<00:03:12.959> your<00:03:13.049> heat<00:03:13.230> bed

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
do trip one of the for your heat bed

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.009 
do trip one of the for your heat bed
which<00:03:13.620> is<00:03:13.799> what<00:03:14.010> these<00:03:14.190> two<00:03:14.430> or<00:03:14.579> four<00:03:15.019> for

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
which is what these two or four for

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.650 
which is what these two or four for
these<00:03:16.170> two<00:03:16.379> plugs<00:03:16.650> then<00:03:17.190> the<00:03:17.879> resettable<00:03:18.299> fuse

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
these two plugs then the resettable fuse

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.440 
these two plugs then the resettable fuse
you<00:03:19.470> haven't<00:03:19.799> done<00:03:20.160> anything<00:03:20.400> really<00:03:20.880> bad<00:03:21.120> and

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
you haven't done anything really bad and

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.870 
you haven't done anything really bad and
it<00:03:21.840> will<00:03:21.959> actually<00:03:22.079> trip<00:03:22.500> and<00:03:22.709> a<00:03:23.160> little<00:03:23.760> bit

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
it will actually trip and a little bit

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.229 
it will actually trip and a little bit
it'll<00:03:24.120> actually<00:03:24.299> reset<00:03:25.049> itself<00:03:25.380> so<00:03:26.180> anyway<00:03:27.180> so

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
it'll actually reset itself so anyway so

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.599 
it'll actually reset itself so anyway so
next<00:03:28.109> up<00:03:28.349> we're<00:03:28.560> going<00:03:28.739> to<00:03:28.889> actually<00:03:28.980> pull<00:03:29.430> the

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609 
next up we're going to actually pull the

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:33.229 
next up we're going to actually pull the
board<00:03:29.849> apart<00:03:30.269> and<00:03:30.540> so<00:03:31.109> same<00:03:32.040> deal<00:03:32.069> we<00:03:32.549> try<00:03:33.090> out

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
board apart and so same deal we try out

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.240 
board apart and so same deal we try out
one<00:03:33.450> side<00:03:33.690> a<00:03:33.750> little<00:03:33.989> bit<00:03:34.079> we<00:03:34.680> wiggle<00:03:34.889> it<00:03:35.160> a

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
one side a little bit we wiggle it a

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.750 
one side a little bit we wiggle it a
little<00:03:35.280> bit<00:03:35.549> on<00:03:35.669> the<00:03:35.760> other<00:03:35.910> side<00:03:36.209> and<00:03:36.480> slowly

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
little bit on the other side and slowly

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.610 
little bit on the other side and slowly
you<00:03:38.760> want<00:03:38.940> actually<00:03:39.239> pull<00:03:39.419> these<00:03:39.510> off<00:03:39.690> and<00:03:40.049> if

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
you want actually pull these off and if

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.520 
you want actually pull these off and if
you<00:03:40.799> look<00:03:41.099> the<00:03:42.060> set<00:03:42.389> of<00:03:42.510> pins<00:03:42.750> in<00:03:43.049> the<00:03:43.139> back<00:03:43.319> are

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
you look the set of pins in the back are

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.849 
you look the set of pins in the back are
really<00:03:43.739> nice<00:03:43.919> not<00:03:44.849> just<00:03:45.060> because<00:03:45.209> they<00:03:45.859> help

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:46.859 
really nice not just because they help

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:48.289 
really nice not just because they help
the<00:03:47.010> board<00:03:47.220> and<00:03:47.310> all<00:03:47.400> that<00:03:47.549> but<00:03:47.849> they<00:03:48.000> help<00:03:48.209> you

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
the board and all that but they help you

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:50.030 
the board and all that but they help you
locate<00:03:48.540> this<00:03:48.959> you<00:03:49.319> know<00:03:49.440> on<00:03:49.560> the<00:03:49.680> right<00:03:49.829> set<00:03:50.010> of

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
locate this you know on the right set of

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.309 
locate this you know on the right set of
pins<00:03:50.310> for<00:03:50.639> this<00:03:50.790> so<00:03:51.329> what<00:03:51.720> you'll<00:03:51.870> do<00:03:52.019> to<00:03:52.049> put

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 
pins for this so what you'll do to put

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:54.589 
pins for this so what you'll do to put
it<00:03:52.440> back<00:03:52.560> together<00:03:52.739> you<00:03:53.609> know<00:03:53.669> what<00:03:54.209> you'll<00:03:54.389> do

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:54.599 
it back together you know what you'll do

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:57.229 
it back together you know what you'll do
when<00:03:55.200> you<00:03:55.590> actually<00:03:55.739> assemble<00:03:56.280> this<00:03:56.400> there's

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
when you actually assemble this there's

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:59.360 
when you actually assemble this there's
four<00:03:57.569> through<00:03:58.079> holes<00:03:58.379> for<00:03:58.829> and<00:03:59.069> actually

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
four through holes for and actually

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.550 
four through holes for and actually
there's<00:03:59.459> six<00:04:00.150> through<00:04:00.389> holes<00:04:00.629> we<00:04:01.200> only<00:04:01.349> use

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
there's six through holes we only use

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.740 
there's six through holes we only use
four<00:04:01.859> of<00:04:02.010> them<00:04:02.160> but<00:04:03.030> that's<00:04:03.150> actually<00:04:03.389> for

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
four of them but that's actually for

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.930 
four of them but that's actually for
mounting<00:04:04.169> this<00:04:04.349> board<00:04:04.709> to<00:04:04.980> the<00:04:05.010> machine<00:04:05.400> so

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
mounting this board to the machine so

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.809 
mounting this board to the machine so
you'll<00:04:06.629> use<00:04:06.690> those<00:04:07.079> for<00:04:07.349> for<00:04:08.010> that<00:04:08.190> and<00:04:08.370> then

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:08.819 
you'll use those for for that and then

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:10.759 
you'll use those for for that and then
what<00:04:09.480> we<00:04:09.599> will<00:04:09.750> do<00:04:09.959> to<00:04:10.260> put<00:04:10.379> it<00:04:10.470> back<00:04:10.590> together

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
what we will do to put it back together

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:12.500 
what we will do to put it back together
once<00:04:11.160> it's<00:04:11.310> on<00:04:11.370> the<00:04:11.489> machine<00:04:11.760> you<00:04:12.209> kind<00:04:12.449> of

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
once it's on the machine you kind of

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.569 
once it's on the machine you kind of
like<00:04:12.660> I<00:04:12.870> always<00:04:13.260> line<00:04:13.620> up<00:04:13.650> the<00:04:13.949> bottom<00:04:14.370> ones

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:14.579 
like I always line up the bottom ones

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:17.089 
like I always line up the bottom ones
first<00:04:14.940> the<00:04:15.269> bottom<00:04:15.569> pins<00:04:15.840> to<00:04:16.440> make<00:04:16.590> sure<00:04:16.799> that

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:17.099 
first the bottom pins to make sure that

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:18.500 
first the bottom pins to make sure that
they're<00:04:17.250> all<00:04:17.430> in<00:04:17.579> place<00:04:17.820> and<00:04:18.120> then<00:04:18.209> kind<00:04:18.449> of

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
they're all in place and then kind of

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.430 
they're all in place and then kind of
like<00:04:18.720> roll<00:04:19.500> it<00:04:19.680> forward<00:04:19.949> now<00:04:20.820> when<00:04:21.000> you<00:04:21.030> look

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
like roll it forward now when you look

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.870 
like roll it forward now when you look
there's<00:04:22.440> two<00:04:22.680> sets<00:04:22.919> of<00:04:23.130> pins<00:04:23.370> so<00:04:23.550> you<00:04:23.610> got<00:04:23.789> to

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
there's two sets of pins so you got to

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.130 
there's two sets of pins so you got to
make<00:04:23.940> sure<00:04:24.000> you<00:04:24.270> get<00:04:24.360> the<00:04:24.510> right<00:04:24.539> ones<00:04:24.900> in

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140 
make sure you get the right ones in

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.690 
make sure you get the right ones in
there<00:04:25.560> shouldn't<00:04:25.860> be<00:04:25.919> any<00:04:26.070> extra<00:04:26.490> pin

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
you get it on there and you hold it by

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.530 
you get it on there and you hold it by
the<00:04:34.710> sides<00:04:35.130> not<00:04:35.490> so<00:04:35.670> much<00:04:35.820> by<00:04:36.000> the<00:04:36.030> top<00:04:36.330> or<00:04:36.480> the
