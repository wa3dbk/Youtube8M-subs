like you should do the whole thing I
don't<00:00:36.500> really<00:00:36.800> care<00:00:37.039> but<00:00:37.609> we<00:00:38.210> probably<00:00:38.449> will

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:38.659 
don't really care but we probably will

00:00:38.659 --> 00:00:42.189 
don't really care but we probably will
cuz<00:00:38.839> it<00:00:38.960> actually<00:00:39.289> came<00:00:39.409> out<00:00:39.559> pretty<00:00:39.620> nice<00:00:41.199> so

00:00:42.189 --> 00:00:42.199 
cuz it actually came out pretty nice so

one<00:00:42.319> of<00:00:42.350> the<00:00:42.469> big<00:00:42.620> problems<00:00:42.859> with<00:00:43.159> this<00:00:43.249> Bronco

00:00:43.689 --> 00:00:43.699 
one of the big problems with this Bronco

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:46.389 
one of the big problems with this Bronco
when<00:00:43.850> I<00:00:43.879> first<00:00:44.149> got<00:00:44.329> it<00:00:44.569> and<00:00:45.069> up<00:00:46.069> until

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:46.399 
when I first got it and up until

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:49.629 
when I first got it and up until
yesterday<00:00:46.550> was<00:00:47.059> that<00:00:48.010> for<00:00:49.010> low<00:00:49.249> in<00:00:49.549> the

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:49.639 
yesterday was that for low in the

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:52.450 
yesterday was that for low in the
transfer<00:00:50.149> case<00:00:50.710> wouldn't<00:00:51.710> work<00:00:51.829> in<00:00:52.039> fact<00:00:52.280> the

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
transfer case wouldn't work in fact the

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.750 
transfer case wouldn't work in fact the
only<00:00:53.379> all<00:00:54.379> I<00:00:54.440> could<00:00:54.739> do<00:00:54.859> is<00:00:55.069> get<00:00:55.249> it<00:00:55.370> into<00:00:55.549> four

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
only all I could do is get it into four

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:03.129 
only all I could do is get it into four
high<00:00:55.940> and<00:00:56.239> neutral<00:00:56.899> so<00:00:59.799> yesterday<00:01:01.809> we<00:01:02.809> got<00:01:02.989> it

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:03.139 
high and neutral so yesterday we got it

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:05.200 
high and neutral so yesterday we got it
to<00:01:03.260> where<00:01:03.379> it<00:01:03.619> will

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
to where it will

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.260 
to where it will
shift<00:01:05.840> down<00:01:05.930> into<00:01:06.290> poor<00:01:06.560> low

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
shift down into poor low

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.240 
shift down into poor low
initial<00:01:08.870> and<00:01:09.140> then

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
initial and then

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.649 
initial and then
or<00:01:10.730> hive<00:01:11.000> that<00:01:11.950> walking

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659

that's a part of the shift linkage and

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:45.550 
that's a part of the shift linkage and
the<00:01:40.729> problem<00:01:42.130> that<00:01:43.130> we<00:01:43.820> had<00:01:44.030> was<00:01:44.240> that<00:01:44.560> it

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
the problem that we had was that it

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:51.090 
the problem that we had was that it
wouldn't<00:01:45.799> go<00:01:46.789> and<00:01:48.220> Farlow

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
wouldn't go and Farlow

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.740 
wouldn't go and Farlow
well<00:01:52.100> we<00:01:52.250> didn't<00:01:52.490> completely<00:01:53.330> get<00:01:53.600> it

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
well we didn't completely get it

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.109 
well we didn't completely get it
adjusted<00:01:53.869> right<00:01:54.440> because<00:01:54.710> in<00:01:55.399> order<00:01:55.819> to<00:01:55.940> get

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
adjusted right because in order to get

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:58.059 
adjusted right because in order to get
to<00:01:56.780> a<00:01:56.810> drive<00:01:57.110> to<00:01:57.229> work<00:01:57.319> you<00:01:57.530> got<00:01:57.679> to<00:01:57.770> lock<00:01:57.890> the

00:01:58.059 --> 00:01:58.069 
to a drive to work you got to lock the

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:01.630 
to a drive to work you got to lock the
hub's<00:01:58.280> out<00:01:59.350> in<00:02:00.350> the<00:02:00.470> four<00:02:00.679> high<00:02:00.800> position<00:02:01.369> but

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
hub's out in the four high position but

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.999 
hub's out in the four high position but
I'm<00:02:02.420> fine<00:02:02.720> with<00:02:02.750> that<00:02:02.899> because<00:02:03.229> for<00:02:03.530> low<00:02:03.740> works

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:04.009 
I'm fine with that because for low works

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:07.840 
I'm fine with that because for low works
