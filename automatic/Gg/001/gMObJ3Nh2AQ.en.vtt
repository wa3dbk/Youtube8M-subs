00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:06.720
 hello people and thank you for 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.120
 turn on today there is one 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.080
 I'm legalizing with you 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.969
 And for that Michael needs three 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.769
 components that is once we water 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.900
 Of course you need sugar and then 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.000
 still need cinnamon sticks and if necessary 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.320
 make offer what search i do 23 no 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.320
 pure vanilla beans had but one 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.400
 need a little extra roma and more 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.080
 We really do not do it all 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.740
 is then just made for the 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.210
 sugar first a bit 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.730
 caramelize best in 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.650
 a deep of which is the coated 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.270
 and brownish after 23 minutes 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.070
 will clear the whole with a bit 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.989
 water release our cinnamon sticks and 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.260
 add in furniture peppers and all 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.000
 Last still 2 yes I say so 20 minutes 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.430
 briefly simmer until the whole thing 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.649
 bit is inserted and then sleep 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.570
 we have a super zero suits super 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.110
 tea and coffee and I will go 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.210
 Have fun with the video for our 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.370
 Of course sugar first needs zero 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.230
 times sugar we weigh with about 200 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.620
 gram and we give it the best 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.570
 a damaged pan and leave to those 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.909
 then beautiful caramelize nice brown 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.710
 Every now and then they will belong to it 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.710
 also all the sugar to the pan 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.090
 comes and where he starts slowly 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.880
 to melt away that looks ever 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.200
 very good and if all yours 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.030
 beautiful room has become 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.549
 from this still about two to three 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.630
 minutes until it's time for the water 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.159
 By the way, it should always be wrong 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.890
 stands so you can delete it if 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.390
 the time has come and the exact prescription and 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.619
 Of course, you will find ingredients as usual 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.710
 down in the infobox 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.509
 the recipe is linked and allowed the whole 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.700
 easy with the water, the drain yet 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.670
 times boil and stir the whole 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:42.450
 and then lay our cinnamon sticks 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.040
 Add and leave the whole then about 20 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.000
 continue to simmer for 30 minutes 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.680
 and then add the vanilla bean 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.240
 and while cooking relaxes 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.970
 also the sugar from the ground up and 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.439
 then mixes with the water and 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.750
 the whole is covered 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.340
 a nice delicious syrup the whole 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.530
 Could of course be in the mason jar or 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.939
 and other stars of your choice 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.680
 but cool down a bit before the 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:08.180
 lid closes and then really had 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.180
 a fantastic zero 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.250
 Our syrup is finished tasting too 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.150
 that's great, the whole thing is over now 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.190
 lasts for a very long time 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.330
 the sugar content of course and you 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.880
 can also could vary a bit 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.900
 how rarely a bit of lemon tastes 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.520
 Just what I would on everyone 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.350
 Fall in the coming weeks and months 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.209
