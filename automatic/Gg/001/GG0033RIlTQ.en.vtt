00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:15.000
 Hello everyone today we will plot the queen 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.760
 green day a spectacular song 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.980
 really very pretty and simple 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.900
 especially versatile both for who maybe 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.990
 he just started playing guitar 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:28.019
 or but still beautiful to play for who it is 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.340
 already practical and of course amat 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.640
 this group 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.500
 then this song we have in this 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.670
 only the chords for the guitar 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.530
 they use the classic non 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.530
 we have a great deal of chord variation 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.149
 just a long sequence of chords that 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.350
 are repeated throughout the 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.329
 song 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.449
 let's start right from the first chords 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.100
 first agreement and the major c that is made 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.920
 by pressing the first key with the index 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.680
 of the second string the medium will press the 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.469
 second key of the fourth string e 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.859
 the ring finger the third key of the fifth 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.859
 rope 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:10.790
 the second agreement instead I minor that 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.189
 it is done by pressing with two fingers that can 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.869
 be average average index annular on 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:18.470
 line and improve I recommend you 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:20.600
 sincerely the ring finger you have to 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:26.119
 press the second fourth key e 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:28.340
 fifth string the third chord instead la 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:31.460
 minor that is done by pressing with the index 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:34.700
 the first button of the second string with 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:39.050
 the middle we press the second key of the 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:43.509
 third string and with the middle the second 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.509
 fourth string button 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.690
 then average annular index 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:54.560
 I tell him this because the fourth agreement 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.420
 and the minor seventh to do the 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:00.920
 minor seventh simply suffices to 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:03.320
 the ring finger rises then the index remains 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.539
 in the first key of the second string and the 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.899
 medium in the second key of the fourth 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:07.899
 rope 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:14.099
 we make them we start to take 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:17.160
 practicality with the song and we start the a 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:20.940
 play remember that in the song 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:23.959
 right in the introduction not the 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:29.540
 guitar does not start giving the plata in 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:29.540
 it is this, in fact, to encounter but upbeat 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:40.880
 so you must first give it in le vale 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:43.580
 now I have explained to you this part of 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.680
 agreements because now the two agreements that 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.800
 follow are the major and sol fa 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:52.300
 the more I tell myself this by explaining this 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:55.790
 difference because there are two ways to 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:59.420
 to play ago and only the one that you are greater 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:02.000
 counselors and the one with the barrÃ¨ do soul 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.010
 but also for those who don't 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.900
 they are very practical and soulful 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.209
 we will do both versions for whom 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:11.900
 maybe he can't do well those 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:14.330
 with the bar we make our own we start to do 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.209
 the one with the barhain where we have the index 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:19.760
 again in the first button in the button 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:24.319
 others make a greater ego then 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:27.110
 the middle will press the second key of the 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:30.880
 third string the other fingers the third fret 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.880
 fourth and fifth strings 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:37.580
 for me this is the simplest method 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:39.830
 both because I am quite able to 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.480
 move fairly well with the bars but 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:43.640
 especially because then it starts 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.459
 said the other chord is the G major 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:51.110
 for his greater it is enough to climb the two 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:54.280
 keys if we do them all now 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:54.280
 the introduction from scratch 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:07.890
 this is the first version the second one 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:11.549
 the one for maybe those who are still not much 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:14.220
 practical with the fingers we have the fa 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:17.430
 greater than by pressing with the index 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:19.620
 the first test of lim the second string on 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:22.350
 medium presses the second key of the third 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:24.300
 rope and ring finger the third button of the 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.039
 fourth string be careful not to play 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:31.160
 fifth and sixth string because obviously 

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:31.160
 they are not not included in the agreement 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:38.999
 the soul will be pressing with the index 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:40.919
 get married with the ring finger or the little finger 

00:04:38.999 --> 00:04:43.439
 third key of the first string io 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:46.349
 use the ring finger with the index the 

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:50.599
 second key of the fake rope and with the 

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:53.599
 middle the third key of the sixth string 

00:04:50.599 --> 00:04:53.599
 then 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:59.180
 let's do the second version 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:12.480
 perfect these chord sequences 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:15.960
 when I saw games or you 

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:18.240
 in short, when the real begins 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:23.220
 verse must be repeated twice 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:25.380
 hence c minor the minor the minor 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:27.990
 seventh makes sol and returns again 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:29.010
 do minor the minor seventh and so on 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:32.100
 etc 

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:34.860
 now let's move on to not a real one 

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:38.670
 paration of the song but in one piece 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:40.500
 of the song that is followed after the 

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:44.070
 repetition of this tour 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:46.330
 or that of the minor 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:48.009
 the minor seventh 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:51.089
 and makes 

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:51.089
 in this way 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:05.889
 from here it depends again on the part 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:08.860
 of the verse I let you hear it now 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:12.030
 all obviously skipping the introduction 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:12.030
 I do all the verse 

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:47.550
 so how could you understand yes 

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:49.650
 always starts again from the dott 

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:52.680
 this song quite simple like 

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:54.570
 law said the only one so called from the 

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:57.350
 the solo a solo campaign of the 

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:57.350
 of the piano 

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:00.870
 having said that I hope you say you enjoyed it 

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:03.450
 I hope he managed to explain me well 

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:05.880
 this beautiful but simple song 

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:07.980
 really cute 

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:08.910
