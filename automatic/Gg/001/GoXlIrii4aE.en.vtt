into<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.520> holster<00:01:51.020> as<00:01:52.020> you<00:01:52.140> can<00:01:52.290> see<00:01:52.530> this<00:01:52.799> one

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
into the holster as you can see this one

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.670

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
has holes on his wrists that's because

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.560 
has holes on his wrists that's because
this<00:01:55.799> is<00:01:55.950> going<00:01:56.070> to<00:01:56.130> be<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.520> Mega<00:01:56.909> Blue<00:01:57.149> Beetle

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
this is going to be the Mega Blue Beetle

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.030 
this is going to be the Mega Blue Beetle
board<00:01:57.899> I<00:01:58.110> always<00:01:58.259> carry<00:01:58.500> around<00:01:58.530> that<00:01:58.860> one

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
board I always carry around that one

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.760 
board I always carry around that one
because<00:01:59.399> since<00:02:00.149> its<00:02:00.270> multi<00:02:00.689> functional<00:02:01.259> it's

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
because since its multi functional it's

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.980 
because since its multi functional it's
easier<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:02.219> do<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.549> review<00:02:02.850> that<00:02:02.880> way<00:02:03.180> because

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
easier to do the review that way because

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
they're like interchangeable with one

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.800 
they're like interchangeable with one
another<00:02:53.560> but<00:02:54.560> you<00:02:54.680> can<00:02:54.800> pull<00:02:54.980> it<00:02:55.100> off<00:02:55.250> and<00:02:55.610> you

can also pull off the top part creating

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.040 
can also pull off the top part creating
like<00:02:59.300> the<00:02:59.420> three<00:02:59.630> separate<00:02:59.930> pieces<00:03:01.810> it<00:03:02.810> comes

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
like the three separate pieces it comes

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.800 
like the three separate pieces it comes
pretty<00:03:03.890> simple<00:03:04.400> it's<00:03:05.090> pretty<00:03:05.390> simple<00:03:05.660> the

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
storyline with the shadow board is that

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.960

they're actually um copies of each other
exact<00:03:56.540> copies<00:03:57.049> technically<00:03:57.680> and<00:03:57.890> they're

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
exact copies technically and they're

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.509 
exact copies technically and they're

are<00:04:04.760> not<00:04:05.000> that<00:04:05.150> much<00:04:05.410> difference<00:04:06.410> I<00:04:06.650> think

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
are not that much difference I think

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.910 
are not that much difference I think
they<00:04:07.100> used<00:04:07.310> the<00:04:07.549> shorter<00:04:08.209> antennas<00:04:09.170> so<00:04:09.739> it's

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
they used the shorter antennas so it's

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.520 
they used the shorter antennas so it's
the<00:04:10.040> second<00:04:10.430> edition<00:04:12.640> red<00:04:13.640> one<00:04:13.880> from<00:04:14.090> Japan
