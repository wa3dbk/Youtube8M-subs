really<00:00:22.439> worked<00:00:22.680> with<00:00:22.800> me<00:00:23.010> on<00:00:23.039> 3d<00:00:23.850> graphics<00:00:24.300> and

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:24.500 
really worked with me on 3d graphics and

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.140 
really worked with me on 3d graphics and
interfaces<00:00:25.500> so<00:00:26.430> we<00:00:26.670> don't<00:00:26.820> have<00:00:26.970> a<00:00:27.000> lot<00:00:27.119> of

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
interfaces so we don't have a lot of

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.269 
interfaces so we don't have a lot of
time<00:00:27.390> so<00:00:27.599> I'll<00:00:27.720> immediately<00:00:28.470> try<00:00:28.920> to<00:00:28.980> show<00:00:29.220> you

farms power plants etc and for each city

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.450 
farms power plants etc and for each city
you<00:01:50.370> have<00:01:50.690> certain<00:01:51.690> objectives<00:01:52.130> you<00:01:53.130> can<00:01:53.190> read

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
you have certain objectives you can read

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.790 
you have certain objectives you can read
it<00:01:53.580> the<00:01:53.880> first<00:01:53.909> objective<00:01:54.390> is<00:01:54.630> to<00:01:54.690> replace<00:01:55.500> all

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800 
it the first objective is to replace all

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
it the first objective is to replace all
power<00:01:56.340> plants<00:01:56.850> with<00:01:57.060> alternative<00:01:57.690> energy<00:01:58.820> and

power plants with alternative energy and

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.390 
power plants with alternative energy and
the<00:01:59.940> second<00:02:00.299> is<00:02:00.450> to<00:02:00.659> get<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.650> pollution<00:02:02.130> level

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 
the second is to get the pollution level

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.230 
the second is to get the pollution level
of<00:02:02.580> one<00:02:02.790> or<00:02:03.030> lower<00:02:03.330> so<00:02:03.770> to<00:02:04.770> quickly

through this each building has a number

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.389 
through this each building has a number
of<00:02:08.090> inputs<00:02:08.750> and<00:02:09.050> outputs<00:02:09.890> and<00:02:10.130> they're<00:02:10.280> all

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
of inputs and outputs and they're all

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:11.860 
of inputs and outputs and they're all
connected<00:02:10.640> together<00:02:10.940> and<00:02:11.450> the<00:02:11.569> puzzle

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
is obviously polluting and a few

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.370 
is obviously polluting and a few
buildings<00:02:26.989> that<00:02:27.290> need<00:02:27.470> to<00:02:27.560> be<00:02:27.650> powered<00:02:27.980> so<00:02:29.380> we

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
buildings that need to be powered so we

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.530 
buildings that need to be powered so we
could<00:02:30.830> just<00:02:31.160> sell<00:02:31.580> this<00:02:31.790> building<00:02:32.060> right<00:02:32.390> away

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
could just sell this building right away

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.600 
could just sell this building right away
but<00:02:32.660> then<00:02:33.080> the<00:02:33.800> entire<00:02:34.130> city<00:02:34.430> would<00:02:34.550> be

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
but then the entire city would be

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.210 
but then the entire city would be
without<00:02:34.940> power<00:02:35.239> so<00:02:35.569> that's<00:02:35.750> not<00:02:35.870> a<00:02:35.930> good<00:02:36.110> idea

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
without power so that's not a good idea

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.930 
without power so that's not a good idea
so<00:02:37.220> first<00:02:37.489> we're<00:02:37.700> going<00:02:37.880> to<00:02:38.799> build<00:02:39.799> one<00:02:40.760> more

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
so first we're going to build one more

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.710 
so first we're going to build one more
other<00:02:41.060> buildings<00:02:41.510> which<00:02:41.690> is<00:02:41.720> a<00:02:41.900> windmill

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
other buildings which is a windmill

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.600 
other buildings which is a windmill
alright<00:02:44.720> so<00:02:45.500> now<00:02:45.650> we<00:02:45.709> have<00:02:45.920> some<00:02:46.100> extra<00:02:46.400> power

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
alright so now we have some extra power

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.850 
alright so now we have some extra power
for<00:02:46.880> our<00:02:46.970> buildings<00:02:47.319> which<00:02:48.319> we<00:02:48.500> could<00:02:48.650> use<00:02:48.830> for

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
for our buildings which we could use for

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.720 
for our buildings which we could use for
example<00:02:49.190> for<00:02:49.700> this<00:02:49.850> school<00:02:50.860> right<00:02:51.860> so<00:02:52.549> now<00:02:52.670> we

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
example for this school right so now we

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.150 
example for this school right so now we
can<00:02:53.030> sell<00:02:53.540> the<00:02:53.930> power<00:02:54.140> station<00:02:54.590> because<00:02:54.950> we

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
can sell the power station because we

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.479 
can sell the power station because we
have<00:02:55.310> another<00:02:55.790> source<00:02:56.120> of<00:02:56.269> energy<00:02:57.400> which<00:02:58.400> of

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
have another source of energy which of

00:02:58.489 --> 00:02:59.860 
have another source of energy which of
course<00:02:58.519> all<00:02:59.000> these<00:02:59.150> other<00:02:59.360> buildings<00:02:59.720> need

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
course all these other buildings need

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.420 
course all these other buildings need
power<00:03:00.140> so<00:03:00.410> we<00:03:00.500> can<00:03:00.620> use<00:03:00.739> this<00:03:00.890> windmill<00:03:01.280> we

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
power so we can use this windmill we

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.610 
power so we can use this windmill we
both<00:03:03.160> there<00:03:04.160> you<00:03:04.220> go<00:03:05.080> yeah<00:03:06.080> there's<00:03:06.290> also<00:03:06.470> a

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
both there you go yeah there's also a

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.770 
both there you go yeah there's also a
kind<00:03:07.489> of<00:03:07.640> 2d<00:03:08.000> view<00:03:08.269> where<00:03:08.450> you<00:03:08.480> can<00:03:08.630> see

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
kind of 2d view where you can see

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.009 
kind of 2d view where you can see
connections<00:03:09.380> and<00:03:09.799> everything<00:03:10.209> but<00:03:11.209> 3d<00:03:11.840> view

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
connections and everything but 3d view

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:18.849 
connections and everything but 3d view
looks<00:03:12.200> better<00:03:14.290> so<00:03:16.239> yeah<00:03:17.239> ok<00:03:18.170> and<00:03:18.470> now<00:03:18.590> we<00:03:18.650> need

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:18.859 
looks better so yeah ok and now we need

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:20.860 
looks better so yeah ok and now we need
to<00:03:18.980> make<00:03:19.130> all<00:03:19.310> these<00:03:19.489> buildings<00:03:19.850> active<00:03:20.269> so

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
to make all these buildings active so

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.480 
to make all these buildings active so
I'm<00:03:21.200> just<00:03:21.410> going<00:03:21.650> to<00:03:21.680> up

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:25.490 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:29.510 

all<00:03:26.490> over<00:03:26.640> other<00:03:26.760> buildings<00:03:28.520> residential

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:29.520 
all over other buildings residential

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:35.180 
all over other buildings residential
area<00:03:30.500> a<00:03:31.500> formal<00:03:33.410> so<00:03:34.410> now<00:03:34.560> all<00:03:34.740> the<00:03:34.860> buildings

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
area a formal so now all the buildings

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:36.800 
area a formal so now all the buildings
are<00:03:35.280> active<00:03:35.580> and<00:03:35.880> our<00:03:35.970> last<00:03:36.180> objective<00:03:36.690> on

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
are active and our last objective on

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.100 
are active and our last objective on
this<00:03:36.840> level<00:03:37.200> is<00:03:37.380> to<00:03:37.590> lower<00:03:37.920> de<00:03:38.100> pollution<00:03:39.110> now

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
this level is to lower de pollution now

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:44.380 
this level is to lower de pollution now
to<00:03:40.170> see<00:03:40.650> we<00:03:40.860> have<00:03:41.040> a<00:03:41.070> pollution<00:03:41.580> level<00:03:41.850> of<00:03:42.000> four

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.880 

and<00:03:45.390> one<00:03:45.960> of<00:03:46.020> the<00:03:46.110> polluting<00:03:46.440> buildings<00:03:46.740> is

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
and one of the polluting buildings is

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.950 
and one of the polluting buildings is
this<00:03:47.040> oil<00:03:47.250> rig<00:03:47.490> which<00:03:48.000> we<00:03:48.180> needed<00:03:48.480> for<00:03:48.690> the<00:03:48.840> old

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:48.960 
this oil rig which we needed for the old

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.420 
this oil rig which we needed for the old
power<00:03:49.230> plants<00:03:49.710> but<00:03:50.040> since<00:03:50.250> we're<00:03:50.400> using

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
power plants but since we're using

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.120 
power plants but since we're using
renewable<00:03:51.180> technology<00:03:51.660> now<00:03:51.810> we<00:03:52.740> can<00:03:52.860> just<00:03:52.980> get

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
renewable technology now we can just get

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:58.460 
renewable technology now we can just get
rid<00:03:53.250> of<00:03:53.340> this<00:03:54.590> good<00:03:56.660> and<00:03:57.660> now<00:03:57.840> the<00:03:57.870> last<00:03:58.170> thing

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
rid of this good and now the last thing

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.350 
rid of this good and now the last thing
that's<00:03:58.620> still<00:03:58.890> producing<00:03:59.370> pollution<00:03:59.820> is<00:04:00.060> this

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
that's still producing pollution is this

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.240 
that's still producing pollution is this
farm<00:04:00.960> which<00:04:01.260> is<00:04:01.290> called<00:04:01.620> on<00:04:01.710> the<00:04:01.800> track<00:04:02.040> of<00:04:02.160> an

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
farm which is called on the track of an

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.550 
farm which is called on the track of an
old-fashioned<00:04:02.900> farm<00:04:03.900> which<00:04:04.110> is<00:04:04.140> kind<00:04:04.470> of

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
old-fashioned farm which is kind of

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.560 
old-fashioned farm which is kind of
alluding<00:04:04.980> so<00:04:05.580> we<00:04:05.700> can<00:04:05.910> upgrade<00:04:06.060> it<00:04:08.420> this<00:04:09.420> is

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
alluding so we can upgrade it this is

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:11.660 
alluding so we can upgrade it this is
also<00:04:09.720> a<00:04:09.840> good<00:04:09.990> time<00:04:10.200> to<00:04:10.310> tell<00:04:11.310> something<00:04:11.520> about

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
also a good time to tell something about

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.630 
also a good time to tell something about
the<00:04:11.970> educational<00:04:12.690> elements<00:04:13.190> there's<00:04:14.190> several

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
the educational elements there's several

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.060 
the educational elements there's several
ways<00:04:14.790> to<00:04:14.970> try<00:04:15.330> to<00:04:15.440> provide<00:04:16.440> information<00:04:16.500> to

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
ways to try to provide information to

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.280 
ways to try to provide information to
players<00:04:17.370> one<00:04:17.700> of<00:04:17.790> them<00:04:17.940> is<00:04:18.090> they<00:04:18.209> can<00:04:18.450> click

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 
players one of them is they can click

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:19.940 
players one of them is they can click
these<00:04:19.440> buttons

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
these buttons

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:21.920 
these buttons
tell<00:04:20.160> me<00:04:20.310> more<00:04:20.489> and<00:04:20.760> get<00:04:20.910> more<00:04:20.940> information

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
tell me more and get more information

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.170 
tell me more and get more information
about<00:04:22.220> the<00:04:23.220> benefits<00:04:23.370> of<00:04:23.820> a<00:04:23.910> certain

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
about the benefits of a certain

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.460 
about the benefits of a certain
technology<00:04:26.750> and<00:04:27.750> there<00:04:27.990> you<00:04:28.080> go<00:04:28.200> the<00:04:28.350> good

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
technology and there you go the good

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.280 
technology and there you go the good
farm<00:04:28.770> does<00:04:28.980> require<00:04:29.280> power<00:04:29.580> so<00:04:30.330> it<00:04:30.780> is<00:04:30.930> active

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.290 
farm does require power so it is active

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.530 
farm does require power so it is active
and<00:04:31.590> I<00:04:31.710> finish<00:04:32.040> this<00:04:32.220> level<00:04:32.460> so<00:04:33.210> this<00:04:33.330> was<00:04:33.510> a

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:33.540 
and I finish this level so this was a

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.660 
and I finish this level so this was a
very<00:04:33.600> simple<00:04:34.200> level<00:04:34.350> I<00:04:34.620> see<00:04:34.920> you<00:04:35.010> have<00:04:35.160> 30

very simple level I see you have 30

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:38.300 
very simple level I see you have 30
seconds<00:04:36.150> left<00:04:36.240> so<00:04:36.600> I'll<00:04:36.690> just<00:04:37.160> give<00:04:38.160> you<00:04:38.190> a

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
our game in the classroom to teach kids

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.810 
our game in the classroom to teach kids
actually<00:04:57.660> about<00:04:58.170> these<00:04:58.950> issues<00:04:59.160> in<00:04:59.520> a<00:04:59.610> fun<00:04:59.790> way

00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820 
actually about these issues in a fun way

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.650

so we think that's

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.620

cool<00:05:01.900> and<00:05:02.200> we're<00:05:02.700> hoping<00:05:03.700> that<00:05:03.880> we're

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630 
cool and we're hoping that we're

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.200 
cool and we're hoping that we're
evaluating<00:05:04.870> to<00:05:05.260> support<00:05:05.620> that<00:05:05.850> so<00:05:06.850> I<00:05:06.910> see<00:05:07.090> our
