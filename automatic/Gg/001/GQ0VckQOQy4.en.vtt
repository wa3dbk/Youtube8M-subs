00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.190

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:14.860

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.580
 daughter whose father is thinking 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.750
 and plotted to perceive his daughter and 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.729

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.380

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:40.180
 behind the doors and ask their 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.880

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:52.140
 together 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.340
 I do not understand why so much time 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.590
 things that do not do me good that I 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.409
 They hurt me reason to be angry 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.530
 reason what I do thinking is enough 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:03.540

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:08.039
