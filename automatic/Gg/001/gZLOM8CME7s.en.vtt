first you're going to print off the
pattern<00:00:25.570> pieces<00:00:25.869> I'm<00:00:26.169> going<00:00:26.410> to<00:00:26.500> make<00:00:26.619> these

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:26.800 
pattern pieces I'm going to make these

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.519 
pattern pieces I'm going to make these
available<00:00:27.099> to<00:00:27.520> you<00:00:27.610> check<00:00:28.270> below<00:00:28.750> this<00:00:29.140> video

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:29.529 
available to you check below this video

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:44.360 
available to you check below this video
I<00:00:29.770> put<00:00:30.009> out<00:00:30.070> two<00:00:30.279> layers<00:00:30.669> of<00:00:30.700> each<00:00:31.210> shape

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.510 

so<00:00:45.330> you're<00:00:45.480> going<00:00:45.690> to<00:00:45.810> take<00:00:45.990> your<00:00:46.200> first<00:00:46.520> layer

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
so you're going to take your first layer

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.470 
so you're going to take your first layer
and<00:00:47.940> place<00:00:48.630> some<00:00:49.040> hot<00:00:50.040> glue<00:00:50.280> on<00:00:50.610> it<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:50.850> then

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
and place some hot glue on it and then

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.930 
and place some hot glue on it and then
you're<00:00:51.600> going<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:51.870> layer<00:00:52.140> this<00:00:52.410> one<00:00:52.790> so<00:00:53.790> that

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
you're going to layer this one so that

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.610 
you're going to layer this one so that
you<00:00:54.030> have<00:00:54.150> one<00:00:54.180> petal<00:00:54.750> between<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.350> previous

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
you have one petal between the previous

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.229 
you have one petal between the previous
petals<00:00:56.370> put<00:00:56.880> on<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.210> next<00:00:57.540> layer<00:00:57.840> again

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 
petals put on the next layer again

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:05.510 
petals put on the next layer again
alternating<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.390> petals<00:01:03.589> with<00:01:04.589> that<00:01:04.890> and

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:05.520 
alternating the petals with that and

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.180 
alternating the petals with that and
while<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.880> glue<00:01:06.119> is<00:01:06.300> still<00:01:06.360> wet<00:01:06.890> pick<00:01:07.890> it<00:01:08.040> up

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:08.190 
while the glue is still wet pick it up

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.080 
while the glue is still wet pick it up
and<00:01:08.720> pinch<00:01:09.720> it<00:01:09.960> from<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.350> bottom<00:01:10.880> so<00:01:11.880> that<00:01:11.910> it

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
and pinch it from the bottom so that it

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.630 
and pinch it from the bottom so that it
causes<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.990> petals<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.710> separate<00:01:14.220> okay<00:01:14.580> I'm

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
causes the petals to separate okay I'm

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.660 
causes the petals to separate okay I'm
just<00:01:14.910> going<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.330> continue<00:01:16.229> with<00:01:16.350> my<00:01:16.649> last<00:01:16.950> two

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
just going to continue with my last two

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:28.700 
just going to continue with my last two
layers<00:01:25.190> like<00:01:26.190> that<00:01:26.570> to<00:01:27.570> form<00:01:27.899> the<00:01:28.080> spiral

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
layers like that to form the spiral

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:40.770 
layers like that to form the spiral
start<00:01:29.100> from<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.610> outside

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.350 

you're<00:01:41.680> just<00:01:41.770> going<00:01:42.010> to<00:01:42.130> curl<00:01:42.850> it<00:01:43.030> into<00:01:43.330> a

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
you're just going to curl it into a

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.180 
you're just going to curl it into a
loose<00:01:43.770> coil<00:01:44.770> like<00:01:45.160> that<00:01:46.650> now<00:01:47.650> you're<00:01:47.800> going<00:01:47.830> to

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.190 
loose coil like that now you're going to

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.020 
loose coil like that now you're going to
put<00:01:48.460> your<00:01:49.390> glue<00:01:49.690> on<00:01:49.930> in<00:01:50.500> the<00:01:50.740> shape<00:01:51.010> of<00:01:51.190> an<00:01:51.370> X<00:01:51.640> so

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
put your glue on in the shape of an X so

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.940 
put your glue on in the shape of an X so
that<00:01:52.180> you<00:01:52.360> make<00:01:52.540> sure<00:01:52.570> you<00:01:52.810> attach<00:01:53.260> all<00:01:53.680> of

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
that you make sure you attach all of

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.730 
that you make sure you attach all of
those<00:01:54.130> layers<00:01:54.400> and<00:01:55.140> you're<00:01:56.140> going<00:01:56.320> to<00:01:56.470> set

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
those layers and you're going to set

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.960 
those layers and you're going to set
that<00:01:56.950> down<00:01:57.010> in<00:01:57.850> the<00:01:58.210> center<00:01:58.600> of<00:01:58.780> the<00:01:58.900> flower

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
that down in the center of the flower

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:05.340 
that down in the center of the flower
like<00:02:00.970> that<00:02:01.590> now<00:02:02.590> just<00:02:02.830> lift<00:02:03.160> up<00:02:03.990> these<00:02:04.990> layers

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
like that now just lift up these layers

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.040 
like that now just lift up these layers
and<00:02:06.090> put<00:02:07.090> some<00:02:07.810> glue<00:02:08.070> so<00:02:09.070> that<00:02:09.250> you<00:02:09.399> have<00:02:09.580> an

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
and put some glue so that you have an

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.720 
and put some glue so that you have an
amount<00:02:11.050> of<00:02:11.320> glue<00:02:11.590> that's<00:02:11.770> going<00:02:11.920> to<00:02:12.160> hold<00:02:12.280> the

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
amount of glue that's going to hold the

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:19.550 
amount of glue that's going to hold the
petals<00:02:13.120> apart

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.430 

so<00:02:19.709> there's<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.130> farm<00:02:20.990> now<00:02:21.990> to<00:02:22.050> make<00:02:22.410> a

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
so there's the farm now to make a

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.640 
so there's the farm now to make a
headband<00:02:22.950> I've<00:02:23.220> got<00:02:23.459> some<00:02:23.760> lingerie<00:02:24.650> elastic

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
I'm just going to add some hot glue

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.309 
I'm just going to add some hot glue
place<00:02:28.500> a<00:02:28.740> row<00:02:29.069> of<00:02:29.370> hot<00:02:29.730> glue<00:02:30.000> all<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:31.290> way

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
place a row of hot glue all the way

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:34.820 
place a row of hot glue all the way
around<00:02:31.440> myself<00:02:32.430> enter<00:02:33.420> it<00:02:33.569> so<00:02:34.440> that's<00:02:34.620> how<00:02:34.709> the

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
around myself enter it so that's how the

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.559 
around myself enter it so that's how the
back<00:02:35.069> will<00:02:35.280> look<00:02:35.459> nice<00:02:35.670> and<00:02:35.880> finished<00:02:36.090> and
