00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:55.659 
I don't watch MMA I thought that since

00:00:55.659 --> 00:00:57.719 
I don't watch MMA I thought that since
silver<00:00:55.989> will<00:00:56.140> not<00:00:56.289> fight<00:00:56.499> or<00:00:56.739> maybe<00:00:57.429> I'm<00:00:57.609> not

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:57.729 
silver will not fight or maybe I'm not

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:59.520 
silver will not fight or maybe I'm not
maybe<00:00:58.120> I'm<00:00:58.300> missing<00:00:58.539> something<00:00:58.690> I<00:00:59.170> don't<00:00:59.379> know

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.530 
maybe I'm missing something I don't know

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.829 
maybe I'm missing something I don't know
but<00:00:59.769> it<00:00:59.979> was<00:01:00.339> a<00:01:00.370> definitely<00:01:00.969> clear<00:01:01.569> win<00:01:01.809> for

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:01.839 
but it was a definitely clear win for

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:04.049 
but it was a definitely clear win for
Anderson<00:01:02.800> Silva<00:01:03.129> in<00:01:03.190> my<00:01:03.339> opinion<00:01:03.639> he's<00:01:03.850> back

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
Anderson Silva in my opinion he's back

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:07.260 
Anderson Silva in my opinion he's back
man<00:01:04.330> I<00:01:04.360> thought<00:01:04.629> he<00:01:04.900> did<00:01:05.080> pretty<00:01:05.229> well<00:01:06.150> it<00:01:07.150> was

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:19.690 
each other and it is pretty entertaining

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.570

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.830 
in the end and it's pretty much like a
real<00:01:56.530> sign<00:01:56.950> of<00:01:56.980> relief<00:01:57.250> that<00:01:58.000> he<00:01:58.390> did<00:01:58.570> well

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
real sign of relief that he did well

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.680 
real sign of relief that he did well
that<00:01:59.830> he<00:02:00.040> still<00:02:00.310> has<00:02:00.490> it<00:02:00.520> at<00:02:01.210> least<00:02:01.360> that's

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
that he still has it at least that's

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.570 
that he still has it at least that's
what<00:02:01.840> I<00:02:01.870> think<00:02:01.960> when<00:02:02.500> he<00:02:02.620> started<00:02:03.040> crying<00:02:03.340> and

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
what I think when he started crying and

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:04.920 
what I think when he started crying and
everything<00:02:03.670> was<00:02:03.970> a<00:02:04.000> very<00:02:04.210> emotional<00:02:04.360> for

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
everything was a very emotional for

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.649 
everything was a very emotional for
fight<00:02:05.380> for<00:02:05.620> Anderson<00:02:05.950> Silva<00:02:06.280> and<00:02:06.460> in<00:02:07.360> the<00:02:07.540> end

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659

the middleweight division i didn't know

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
that goes to show that i don't really

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.930 
that goes to show that i don't really
follow<00:02:31.599> the<00:02:31.780> sport<00:02:31.959> that<00:02:32.140> much<00:02:32.319> but<00:02:33.069> yeah<00:02:33.819> it

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
was did still entertaining and i think

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:40.500 
was did still entertaining and i think
it's<00:02:39.400> pretty<00:02:39.519> much<00:02:39.730> it<00:02:39.910> i<00:02:40.060> think<00:02:40.300> the<00:02:40.360> reason

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
it's pretty much it i think the reason

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.720 
it's pretty much it i think the reason
nothing<00:02:41.230> crazy<00:02:41.530> happened<00:02:42.069> like<00:02:42.130> the<00:02:42.340> last<00:02:42.550> two
