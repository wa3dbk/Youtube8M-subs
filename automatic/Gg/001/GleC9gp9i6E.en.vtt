00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:07.610
 You're that Magome Chatchi of man I'd work that 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.690
 It is called Shinji 

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:13.340
 Mind and heart 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.220
 that 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:20.710
 I 'm indoors 

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:24.960
 I have not worn such a big movement to meet each other at first, but I wear a mask 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:27.130
 Something like an emotion that now bleeds from this person 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:33.699
 To everyone 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:36.300
 It feels like you 're on the spot as you feel on the screen in a cinema 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:38.540
 Conversely, this all-sama 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.579
 Such as those to judge 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:44.530
 It seems so stupid you can see here 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.920
 New as a perspective 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.400
 I think it will be 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.240
 North 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.580
 That even if the Koji Seto 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.870
 It also shows something like a different side 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.430
 It was 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.940
 By all means everyone you think whether what not it 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.940
 Please look 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.980
 h 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.740
 State 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:13.100
 Many dirty parts hit 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.100
 lacquer 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:22.420
 I really don't know who you are looking at and it's really a live broadcast of what's happening in it 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.760
 like 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:29.270
 Have fun with each other 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.270
 There is not 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.140
 Look forward to 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.130
 I would like to receive 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.130
 Thanking you in advance 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.259
 Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.580
 tan 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.910
 what 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.910
 here 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:08.090
 Even if you think that you are the most guilty of voting, decide by majority in time 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.910
 Hmm 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.980
 Mashup ken 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:30.170
 This is a trick to hate hate 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.170
 There was a lie around that did not know the problem 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:36.590
 Ah ah ah 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.590
 Oh jaro c 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.120
