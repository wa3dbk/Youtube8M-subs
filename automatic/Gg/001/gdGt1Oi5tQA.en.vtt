00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 hello guys today I present the nef 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:07.049
 romecup which allows to launch two 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.150
 damage modes simultaneously 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.849
 launch are three we have the mode of 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.309
 throwing a dart just enough to do 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.230
 this to crush only in the middle of 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.510
 trigger available 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.369
 then just complete the crushing 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.830
 then pull even second time 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.420
 we can pull by pressing until 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.820
 read two darts and the last mode 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.820
 withdrawal the third is in focus 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.610
 continuous so that I just need to trace it 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.770
 continuously and keep the trigger 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.030
 completely pressed but now we will go 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.890
 to see all this mode of 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.750
 recharge with the goal that a place 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.090
 now we will see him change even fire 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.770
 of the images he put in the oven 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.030
 to finish we say a matrix of 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.110
 handling is definitely a lot 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.140
 flexible, easily manoeuvrable 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:55.680
 being shorter we say classics 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.870
 of the classic nerf blasters is a lot 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.730
 heavy the front and in the long run hold it 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.199
 with one hand it could also 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.460
 condition your aim for which 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.199
 suggestion that always of 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.229
 also accompany to improve the 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.570
 Hand shooting accuracy below 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:13.470
 the barrel of the merck itself using 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.420
 the ergonomic grip of the fixed charger 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.580
 we go directly bora to the test of 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.619
 we are at the TV test we darts 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.740
 they are inserted in this way 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:26.670
 frontally that a different insertion 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:29.490
 compared to the classic nef now the la 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.590
 shit is loaded sky that loaded it 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.150
 then making the cart run towards 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.110
 the low 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.540
 then we pass to the shooting test 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.820
 finally a real joke 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.570
 trigger up to the goal to start 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.369
 only one shot here started one 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.820
 we are going to fix the aim is not 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.710
 simple even when doing the movie 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.799
 at the same time and here is the 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.689
 second course load times we see 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.710
 instead the departure of the two shots in 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.280
 simultaneous 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.630
 here is how you see it diverge 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.630
 slightly the blows in this case 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.490
 let's make a piece we love to continuous fire 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.220
 so i hold the trigger 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:11.500
 crushed and simply as you see 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.690
 I reloaded my nef 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.790
 therefore excellent for the launch of the two 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.710
 blows the only one if we want to sin that 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.320
 could only toss toma from the turn 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:22.090
 and one can not think of an infinite row 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.070
 for questions and information you can 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.840
 write below in the comments for i 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:28.980
