00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
I'm guessing this is the opportunity

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.030 
I'm guessing this is the opportunity
that<00:01:23.460> God<00:01:23.790> put<00:01:24.060> in<00:01:24.420> front<00:01:24.570> of<00:01:24.689> me<00:01:24.830> to<00:01:25.830> make

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
that God put in front of me to make

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.670 
that God put in front of me to make
change<00:01:26.340> in<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.580> world<00:01:26.790> I<00:01:26.970> mean<00:01:27.150> it's<00:01:27.270> gonna<00:01:27.390> be

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
one step at a time but that's that's the

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.219 
one step at a time but that's that's the
whole<00:01:32.310> goal<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:32.820> to<00:01:33.060> make<00:01:33.240> a<00:01:33.270> positive<00:01:33.570> impact
