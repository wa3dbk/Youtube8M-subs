00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.350 
where you can set up these roadblocks
basically<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:32.009> block<00:01:32.369> tanks<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.000> jeeps<00:01:33.030> from

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
basically the block tanks and jeeps from

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.270 
basically the block tanks and jeeps from
going<00:01:33.659> over<00:01:33.930> going<00:01:34.650> across<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:35.040> bridge

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
going over going across the bridge

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.370 
going over going across the bridge
although<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.060> can<00:01:36.450> easily<00:01:36.750> drive<00:01:36.930> over<00:01:37.200> those

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
although you can easily drive over those

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.020 
although you can easily drive over those
if<00:01:37.740> you<00:01:37.920> take<00:01:38.100> a<00:01:38.130> few<00:01:38.340> seconds<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:38.759> just<00:01:38.939> let

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
if you take a few seconds to just let

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.940 
if you take a few seconds to just let
your<00:01:39.150> vehicle<00:01:39.570> go<00:01:39.930> on<00:01:40.079> top<00:01:40.350> of<00:01:40.530> them<00:01:40.710> but

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
your vehicle go on top of them but

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.950 
your vehicle go on top of them but
basically<00:01:41.820> these<00:01:42.060> two<00:01:42.270> in<00:01:42.450> these<00:01:42.570> highlights

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
basically these two in these highlights

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.270 
basically these two in these highlights
of<00:01:43.020> these<00:01:43.140> two<00:01:43.320> games<00:01:43.530> i'll<00:01:43.740> try<00:01:43.890> to<00:01:43.950> destroy

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
vehicles and then you see some sniping

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.300 
vehicles and then you see some sniping
gameplay<00:01:46.079> towards<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.829> end<00:01:46.950> it's<00:01:47.040> not<00:01:47.100> very

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310

we're playing the band together and then

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.040 
we're playing the band together and then
we<00:02:29.739> replace<00:02:30.010> a<00:02:30.040> bad<00:02:30.370> company<00:02:30.819> two<00:02:31.030> as<00:02:31.180> well<00:02:31.480> but

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
I'm thinking about get this game for the

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.729 
I'm thinking about get this game for the
PlayStation<00:02:33.760> 4<00:02:34.030> when<00:02:34.630> the<00:02:34.810> new<00:02:34.930> consoles<00:02:35.410> drop

PlayStation 4 when the new consoles drop

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:37.620 
PlayStation 4 when the new consoles drop
because<00:02:35.920> i<00:02:36.640> think<00:02:37.090> the<00:02:37.150> game<00:02:37.300> looks

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
because i think the game looks

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.240

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
off playing this one map i'm excited for

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:08.490 
off playing this one map i'm excited for
the<00:03:07.060> game<00:03:07.209> and<00:03:07.269> I've<00:03:07.510> seen<00:03:07.750> the<00:03:07.870> paracel<00:03:08.350> storm

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
the game and I've seen the paracel storm

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.850 
the game and I've seen the paracel storm
gameplay<00:03:09.250> with<00:03:09.790> the<00:03:10.360> ship<00:03:10.630> coming<00:03:10.900> in<00:03:11.200> but<00:03:11.829> I

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
gameplay with the ship coming in but I

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.560 
gameplay with the ship coming in but I
believe<00:03:12.250> there's<00:03:12.459> only<00:03:12.549> one<00:03:12.820> map<00:03:13.060> on<00:03:13.269> the<00:03:13.390> beta

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
believe there's only one map on the beta

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:15.630 
believe there's only one map on the beta
which<00:03:13.840> is<00:03:13.870> this<00:03:14.260> one<00:03:14.590> and<00:03:14.890> it's<00:03:15.280> bigger<00:03:15.519> for

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
which is this one and it's bigger for

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.670 
which is this one and it's bigger for
conquest<00:03:16.239> and<00:03:16.540> there's<00:03:16.690> domination<00:03:17.350> as<00:03:17.440> well

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
conquest and there's domination as well

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.009 
conquest and there's domination as well
there's<00:03:17.980> traditional<00:03:18.489> three<00:03:18.790> flags<00:03:19.209> captains

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
there's traditional three flags captains

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:23.190 
there's traditional three flags captains
and<00:03:20.640> just<00:03:21.640> know<00:03:22.000> it's<00:03:22.299> small<00:03:22.480> map<00:03:22.870> type<00:03:23.079> of

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
and just know it's small map type of

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.289 
and just know it's small map type of
game<00:03:23.440> a<00:03:23.709> little<00:03:24.130> bit<00:03:24.220> more<00:03:24.400> fast-paced<00:03:24.850> than

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:25.299 
game a little bit more fast-paced than

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:27.210 
game a little bit more fast-paced than
conquest<00:03:25.870> and<00:03:26.140> it's<00:03:26.590> alright<00:03:26.950> but<00:03:27.070> I<00:03:27.100> think

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
conquest and it's alright but I think

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.039 
conquest and it's alright but I think
conquest<00:03:27.670> is<00:03:27.790> definitely<00:03:28.180> a<00:03:28.209> lot<00:03:28.450> more<00:03:28.510> fun<00:03:28.900> to

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.049 
conquest is definitely a lot more fun to

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:31.259 
conquest is definitely a lot more fun to
play<00:03:29.290> on<00:03:29.530> the<00:03:30.100> bad<00:03:30.250> company<00:03:30.700> games<00:03:30.880> I<00:03:31.030> prefer
