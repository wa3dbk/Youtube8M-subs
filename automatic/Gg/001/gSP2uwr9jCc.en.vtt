I show you now how to cut to reach this
the<00:00:42.690> four<00:00:42.930> engines<00:00:44.000> so<00:00:45.020> this<00:00:46.020> is<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.350> base

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
the four engines so this is the base

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.670 
the four engines so this is the base
this<00:00:47.190> is<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.430> main<00:00:48.649> folding<00:00:49.760> type<00:00:50.760> of<00:00:51.120> fighter

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680 
this is the main folding type of fighter

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:59.119 
this is the main folding type of fighter
now<00:00:52.680> you<00:00:53.100> hold<00:00:53.309> it<00:00:53.579> this<00:00:53.789> way<00:00:54.320> and<00:00:58.129> the

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
now you hold it this way and the

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.110 
now you hold it this way and the
beginning<00:00:59.670> of<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.210> wings<00:01:01.160> at<00:01:02.160> this<00:01:02.520> point

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
beginning of the wings at this point

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:11.149 
beginning of the wings at this point
you<00:01:03.840> cut<00:01:04.970> halfway<00:01:06.380> up<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.439> this<00:01:08.189> point<00:01:10.159> half

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
you cut halfway up to this point half

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.149 
you cut halfway up to this point half
way<00:01:11.520> like<00:01:12.450> this<00:01:12.920> done<00:01:13.920> and<00:01:14.189> it's<00:01:14.430> light<00:01:14.700> upon

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 
way like this done and it's light upon

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:22.070 
way like this done and it's light upon
up<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.670> end<00:01:19.490> where<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.640> wings<00:01:21.080> finish

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
up to the end where the wings finish

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:29.840 
up to the end where the wings finish
here<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:23.040> second<00:01:23.490> one<00:01:27.020> so<00:01:28.460> these<00:01:29.460> are<00:01:29.729> the

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
here and the second one so these are the

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.330 
here and the second one so these are the
cuts<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.390> main<00:01:30.570> cuts<00:01:30.840> you<00:01:31.079> have<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.380> do<00:01:31.530> from

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
cuts the main cuts you have to do from

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.010 
cuts the main cuts you have to do from
the<00:01:32.520> end<00:01:32.729> from<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.210> last<00:01:33.450> one<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.990> last

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
the end from the last one the last

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:41.170 
the end from the last one the last
stripes<00:01:34.560> I<00:01:35.720> take<00:01:36.720> both<00:01:36.930> of<00:01:36.990> them<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:38.450> I<00:01:39.450> cut

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
stripes I take both of them and I cut

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:48.310 
stripes I take both of them and I cut
this<00:01:42.180> way<00:01:43.130> half<00:01:44.130> of<00:01:44.340> it<00:01:45.110> with<00:01:46.110> a<00:01:46.140> little<00:01:46.380> angle

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
this way half of it with a little angle

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.230 
this way half of it with a little angle
like<00:01:49.320> this<00:01:50.630> control<00:01:51.630> if<00:01:51.840> they<00:01:52.020> are

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
like this control if they are

00:01:53.240 --> 00:02:01.910 
like this control if they are
equal<00:01:56.840> like<00:01:57.840> this<00:01:58.760> then<00:01:59.760> you<00:02:00.390> take<00:02:00.800> with<00:02:01.800> the

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
equal like this then you take with the

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.590 
equal like this then you take with the
scissors<00:02:03.770> gzip<00:02:04.770> on<00:02:04.920> and<00:02:05.280> you<00:02:05.730> do<00:02:05.910> you<00:02:06.210> strap<00:02:06.570> it

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
scissors gzip on and you do you strap it

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:13.820 
scissors gzip on and you do you strap it
like<00:02:06.900> this<00:02:09.619> you<00:02:10.619> see<00:02:10.950> and<00:02:12.260> after<00:02:13.260> anxiety
