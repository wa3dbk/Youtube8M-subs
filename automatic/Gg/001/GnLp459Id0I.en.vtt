thing I want to do is bring in a
technology<00:00:15.469> that's<00:00:16.250> difficult<00:00:16.580> for<00:00:17.000> them<00:00:17.180> to

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:17.570 
technology that's difficult for them to

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.570 
technology that's difficult for them to
to<00:00:18.230> implement<00:00:18.590> my<00:00:18.920> first<00:00:19.160> impression<00:00:19.550> of

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:19.580 
to implement my first impression of

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.790 
to implement my first impression of
amodal<00:00:19.910> when<00:00:20.150> I<00:00:20.180> did<00:00:20.480> my<00:00:20.630> first<00:00:20.780> demo<00:00:21.080> was<00:00:21.590> I

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:21.800 
amodal when I did my first demo was I

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.650 
amodal when I did my first demo was I
was<00:00:21.950> quite<00:00:22.430> frankly<00:00:22.610> blown<00:00:22.940> away<00:00:23.150> and<00:00:23.360> the

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:23.660 
was quite frankly blown away and the

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.110 
was quite frankly blown away and the
fact<00:00:23.900> that<00:00:24.050> amodal<00:00:24.620> offered<00:00:25.280> multiple<00:00:25.940> ways

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:26.120 
fact that amodal offered multiple ways

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.960 
fact that amodal offered multiple ways
to<00:00:26.150> get<00:00:26.660> transcriptions<00:00:27.530> done<00:00:27.970> multiple

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970 
to get transcriptions done multiple

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:30.850 
to get transcriptions done multiple
platforms<00:00:29.870> for<00:00:30.020> doing<00:00:30.230> that<00:00:30.380> as<00:00:30.500> well<00:00:30.710> as

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:30.860 
platforms for doing that as well as

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:32.620 
platforms for doing that as well as
integration<00:00:31.310> directly<00:00:31.850> with<00:00:32.000> the<00:00:32.090> tool

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:32.630 
integration directly with the tool

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:34.930 
integration directly with the tool
was<00:00:33.050> really<00:00:33.380> important<00:00:33.860> to<00:00:33.920> us<00:00:34.340> fluency

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:34.940 
was really important to us fluency

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.240 
was really important to us fluency
Direct<00:00:35.390> allows<00:00:35.870> me<00:00:36.170> to<00:00:36.500> do<00:00:36.770> more<00:00:36.920> of<00:00:36.980> what<00:00:37.220> I

I<00:01:17.170> will<00:01:18.170> start<00:01:18.500> a<00:01:18.620> note<00:01:18.830> in<00:01:19.130> the<00:01:19.700> exam<00:01:20.030> room

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
I will start a note in the exam room

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.840 
I will start a note in the exam room
with<00:01:20.360> the<00:01:20.479> patient<00:01:21.070> the<00:01:22.070> voice<00:01:22.250> files<00:01:22.580> are

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
with the patient the voice files are

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.240 
with the patient the voice files are
there<00:01:23.090> I<00:01:23.120> move<00:01:23.690> over<00:01:23.930> to<00:01:24.020> my<00:01:24.140> office<00:01:24.290> the<00:01:25.070> voice

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
there I move over to my office the voice

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.700 
there I move over to my office the voice
files<00:01:25.549> are<00:01:25.790> there<00:01:25.940> I<00:01:26.299> don't<00:01:26.840> have<00:01:27.020> to<00:01:27.170> retrain

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
files are there I don't have to retrain

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.770 
files are there I don't have to retrain
and<00:01:27.890> I<00:01:27.979> train<00:01:28.190> it<00:01:28.310> once<00:01:28.580> and<00:01:28.940> it<00:01:29.030> knows<00:01:29.270> it<00:01:29.510> you

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
and I train it once and it knows it you

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.510 
and I train it once and it knows it you
no<00:01:29.990> matter<00:01:30.140> where<00:01:30.380> I'm<00:01:30.530> working<00:01:30.710> from<00:01:31.100> even

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
no matter where I'm working from even

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.730 
no matter where I'm working from even
from<00:01:31.640> home<00:01:31.850> for<00:01:32.299> me<00:01:32.420> that<00:01:32.630> was<00:01:32.810> that<00:01:33.350> was<00:01:33.530> a

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
from home for me that was that was a

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.980 
from home for me that was that was a
game<00:01:33.950> changer<00:01:34.390> it's<00:01:35.390> made<00:01:35.600> me<00:01:35.720> a<00:01:35.750> lot<00:01:35.960> more

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
game changer it's made me a lot more

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.260 
game changer it's made me a lot more
flexible<00:01:36.590> and<00:01:36.740> more<00:01:36.890> efficient<00:01:37.310> by<00:01:37.670> using<00:01:38.000> it

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
flexible and more efficient by using it

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.930 
flexible and more efficient by using it
so<00:01:38.840> one<00:01:38.990> of<00:01:39.020> the<00:01:39.170> key<00:01:39.380> advantages<00:01:39.500> of<00:01:40.070> amodal

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
so one of the key advantages of amodal

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.539 
so one of the key advantages of amodal
for<00:01:41.330> us<00:01:41.450> is<00:01:41.780> that<00:01:42.020> will<00:01:42.350> eliminate<00:01:42.740> a<00:01:43.010> number

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
for us is that will eliminate a number

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:45.940 
for us is that will eliminate a number
of<00:01:43.729> different<00:01:44.119> vendors<00:01:44.750> from<00:01:45.560> our<00:01:45.740> previous

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
of different vendors from our previous

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.820 
of different vendors from our previous
solution<00:01:46.610> and<00:01:47.150> for<00:01:47.420> us<00:01:47.570> that<00:01:47.600> means<00:01:48.020> reducing

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
solution and for us that means reducing

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.090 
solution and for us that means reducing
our<00:01:49.310> overall<00:01:49.700> transcription<00:01:50.479> cost<00:01:51.100> reducing

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
our overall transcription cost reducing

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.920 
our overall transcription cost reducing
our<00:01:52.220> maintenance<00:01:52.490> cost<00:01:52.939> and<00:01:53.360> reducing<00:01:53.840> our

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
our maintenance cost and reducing our

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:55.149 
our maintenance cost and reducing our
technology

so<00:01:55.549> our<00:01:55.670> current<00:01:55.909> vendor<00:01:56.149> wasn't<00:01:56.720> capable<00:01:57.200> of

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
so our current vendor wasn't capable of

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.490 
so our current vendor wasn't capable of
doing<00:01:57.619> both<00:01:57.799> the<00:01:57.979> front<00:01:58.250> end<00:01:58.399> and<00:01:58.549> back<00:01:58.759> end

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
doing both the front end and back end

transcription capabilities and a modal

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.810 
transcription capabilities and a modal
gave<00:02:03.170> us<00:02:03.350> that<00:02:03.530> ability<00:02:04.159> to<00:02:04.280> do<00:02:04.430> that<00:02:04.579> and

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
gave us that ability to do that and

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.340 
gave us that ability to do that and
that's<00:02:05.270> an<00:02:05.420> important<00:02:05.930> piece<00:02:06.079> for<00:02:06.110> us

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
that's an important piece for us

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:07.929 
that's an important piece for us
particularly<00:02:07.100> as<00:02:07.159> it<00:02:07.280> relates<00:02:07.310> to<00:02:07.670> the
