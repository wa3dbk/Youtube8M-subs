 I am audi and this is hotel blog 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.930
 during the pre-Hispanic era there were 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.449
 two colleges and type the calmecac 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.640
 jackal and in the calmecac is where 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:50.379
 they studied the nobles and taught them 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.010
 things like history arts philosophy 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:54.949
 among others 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:57.320
 and in the texcal and they studied the rest of 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:00.320
 the population and they taught them how to 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:04.009
 serve the nobility and also the art of 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:06.229
 the war during the 18th and 19th centuries the 

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:09.550
 education was based rather on what 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:12.170
 religious and the moral thing I think a lot 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:14.600
 illiteracy and does not pass the 20th century with 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.910
 the president manuel Ã¡vila camacho that 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.160
 changed educational reforms to 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.170
 Over the years, the educational level 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.820
 has been transforming before 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.210
 compulsory to study until primary 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:28.039
 after primary and secondary in the 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.619
 It is mandatory to study 

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:33.020
 secondary and high school in 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:36.470
 As regards the degrees previously studied 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.899
 a bachelor's degree was amazing the most 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.060
 at present it is something very normal and 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:43.220
 we look more at studying a mastery 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.580
 or a PhD because we want to get more 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.680
 far 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.380
 around education there are many 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.270
 myths and ghosts effort that the day of 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.220
 today we will talk about them studying a 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.290
 mean immediately after 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.270
 you studied your degree 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.250
 It could be a mistake because you need a 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.020
 little work experience and grow 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.970
 as a professional so I'll 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.920
 I recommend that you better study a 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.260
 graduate or take a course according to 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.630
 cooperation and development organization 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:11.210
 economic people who have 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.070
 a bachelor's degree earn much more than the 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.830
 people who do not have another myth is 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:19.700
 If I already work or study a career 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:22.220
 technique so that he continued or initiated a 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.800
 degree what we do not know 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.260
 is how long are we going to continue in that 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.330
 work or how long that good will last 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.030
 streak is very important to follow 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.190
 studying continue learning another case 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.920
 is the people's people work 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.230
 to a place where there is already a career and 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.180
 can develop professionally well 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.140
 is that they think is not necessarily a 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.290
 college career 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.200
 imagine a person who works 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.690
 in sales that is developing 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.040
 professionally and also study 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.690
 marketing or advertising there is also 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.690
 people who have already finished their career 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.760
 university but they did not like it and did not 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.400
 see case study another career that if 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.320
 they like it but kids it's never too late 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.000
