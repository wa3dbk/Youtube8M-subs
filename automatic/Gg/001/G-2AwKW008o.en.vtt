course what we care about is the option
to<00:00:55.530> start<00:00:56.129> overclocking<00:00:57.320> when<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.379> first

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
to start overclocking when you first

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.590 
to start overclocking when you first
come<00:00:58.710> in<00:00:58.770> you<00:00:59.670> can<00:00:59.789> see<00:00:59.879> you<00:00:59.940> get<00:01:00.059> some<00:01:00.210> pretty

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
come in you can see you get some pretty

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.060 
come in you can see you get some pretty
good<00:01:00.690> information<00:01:00.780> right<00:01:01.350> off<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.559> bat<00:01:01.710> you

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
good information right off the bat you

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.860 
good information right off the bat you
get<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.309> minimum<00:01:02.550> speed<00:01:02.879> your<00:01:03.090> CPU<00:01:03.480> etc<00:01:03.809> or

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
get the minimum speed your CPU etc or

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.570 
get the minimum speed your CPU etc or
not<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.199> current<00:01:04.559> speed<00:01:04.799> your<00:01:05.010> cpu<00:01:05.460> running

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
not the current speed your cpu running

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.310 
not the current speed your cpu running
at<00:01:05.790> nicon<00:01:06.060> see<00:01:06.180> we're<00:01:06.330> pretty<00:01:06.960> well<00:01:07.049> just<00:01:07.110> off

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
at nicon see we're pretty well just off

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.530 
at nicon see we're pretty well just off
right<00:01:07.680> now<00:01:07.860> so<00:01:08.100> it's<00:01:08.220> going<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.430> be<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:09.030> at<00:01:09.299> the

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
right now so it's going to be the at the

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.690 
right now so it's going to be the at the
minimum<00:01:09.780> speed<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:10.409> then<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.130> maximum<00:01:11.549> speed

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
minimum speed and then the maximum speed

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.280 
minimum speed and then the maximum speed
so<00:01:12.060> right<00:01:12.180> now<00:01:12.210> we're<00:01:12.390> its<00:01:12.510> stock<00:01:12.750> 300

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
the settings of course start a stress

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.649 
the settings of course start a stress
test<00:01:28.380> which<00:01:28.890> is<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:29.070> great<00:01:29.310> way<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.520> check<00:01:30.509> and

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
test which is a great way to check and

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:31.929 
test which is a great way to check and
see<00:01:30.750> if<00:01:30.840> your<00:01:30.930> phone<00:01:31.110> is<00:01:31.140> actually<00:01:31.380> happy<00:01:31.860> with

see if your phone is actually happy with

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:34.069 
see if your phone is actually happy with
your<00:01:32.939> overclocking<00:01:33.479> settings<00:01:33.810> because<00:01:33.869> it's

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
your overclocking settings because it's

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.450 
your overclocking settings because it's
important<00:01:34.439> to<00:01:34.470> realize<00:01:34.710> that<00:01:35.009> each<00:01:35.159> phone<00:01:35.340> is

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
important to realize that each phone is

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.760 
important to realize that each phone is
different<00:01:35.820> one<00:01:36.090> phone<00:01:36.329> might<00:01:37.320> only<00:01:37.560> be<00:01:37.650> able

actual settings it's going to apply are
the<00:02:23.340> the<00:02:24.120> maximum<00:02:24.569> voltage<00:02:24.720> and<00:02:25.170> speed<00:02:25.470> and

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
the the maximum voltage and speed and

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.500 
the the maximum voltage and speed and
then<00:02:26.220> the<00:02:26.400> different<00:02:26.489> slot<00:02:27.000> so<00:02:27.239> you<00:02:27.269> can<00:02:27.390> see

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
then the different slot so you can see

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.690 
then the different slot so you can see
the<00:02:27.629> stock<00:02:27.840> one<00:02:28.080> is<00:02:28.230> 300<00:02:28.769> megahertz<00:02:28.950> six

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
the stock one is 300 megahertz six

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.430 
number eight Hertz 800 megahertz and one
gigahertz<00:02:32.060> so<00:02:33.060> let's<00:02:33.930> actually<00:02:33.989> do<00:02:34.260> something

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
gigahertz so let's actually do something

gigahertz so let's actually do something
you<00:02:34.830> can<00:02:34.980> see<00:02:35.010> the<00:02:35.190> presets<00:02:35.610> are<00:02:35.819> how<00:02:36.810> two

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870

400-700 a gigahertz in 1.2 and this is
where<00:03:17.940> the<00:03:18.090> stress<00:03:18.389> test<00:03:18.630> becomes<00:03:18.959> useful<00:03:19.400> the

stress test is now we're running it's

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.349 
stress test is now we're running it's
important<00:03:23.430> to<00:03:23.489> note<00:03:23.609> that<00:03:23.639> it<00:03:23.880> does<00:03:24.150> keep

just<00:03:27.870> pounding<00:03:28.410> away<00:03:28.769> at<00:03:28.980> the<00:03:29.160> CPU<00:03:29.579> right<00:03:29.819> now

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
just pounding away at the CPU right now

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.080 
just pounding away at the CPU right now
is<00:03:30.060> what<00:03:30.209> it's<00:03:30.329> doing<00:03:31.250> trying<00:03:32.250> to<00:03:32.639> get<00:03:32.819> it<00:03:32.970> to

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
is what it's doing trying to get it to

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.449

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
stress test run for one maybe two

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:48.050 
stress test run for one maybe two
minutes<00:03:45.720> and<00:03:46.400> really<00:03:47.400> get<00:03:47.549> a<00:03:47.579> feel<00:03:47.790> for<00:03:48.000> the

fact that the phone is happy when it is
just<00:03:49.709> being<00:03:49.889> hammered<00:03:50.480> and<00:03:51.480> we'll<00:03:51.660> go<00:03:51.750> ahead

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
just being hammered and we'll go ahead

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.140 
just being hammered and we'll go ahead
and<00:03:51.900> stop<00:03:52.230> it<00:03:52.549> see<00:03:53.549> you<00:03:53.609> down<00:03:53.730> here<00:03:53.760> lets<00:03:54.090> you

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
and stop it see you down here lets you

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.220 
and stop it see you down here lets you
know<00:03:54.209> it's<00:03:54.359> over<00:03:54.450> and<00:03:54.720> then<00:03:54.810> it'll<00:03:54.930> tell<00:03:55.139> you

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
how long it ran for so we ran it for

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.559 
how long it ran for so we ran it for
almost<00:03:57.840> 33<00:03:58.530> seconds<00:03:58.859> there<00:03:59.299> but<00:04:00.299> you<00:04:00.359> can<00:04:00.480> do

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:00.569 
almost 33 seconds there but you can do

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:02.030 
almost 33 seconds there but you can do
that<00:04:00.690> to<00:04:00.840> make<00:04:00.930> sure<00:04:01.079> your<00:04:01.230> phone<00:04:01.380> is<00:04:01.410> happy

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
let's say you don't you know the preset

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.160 
let's say you don't you know the preset
you've<00:04:06.120> selected<00:04:06.299> there's<00:04:06.660> something<00:04:06.989> just

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
you've selected there's something just

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:08.509 
you've selected there's something just
want<00:04:07.650> a<00:04:07.680> little<00:04:07.769> bit<00:04:07.950> different<00:04:08.250> we<00:04:08.340> can<00:04:08.459> hit

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
want a little bit different we can hit

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:10.849 
want a little bit different we can hit
menu<00:04:08.819> here<00:04:09.239> and<00:04:09.419> we<00:04:10.290> get<00:04:10.380> the<00:04:10.470> option<00:04:10.620> to

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:10.859 
menu here and we get the option to

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:13.370 
menu here and we get the option to
manage<00:04:11.430> our<00:04:11.549> presets<00:04:11.970> find<00:04:12.660> more<00:04:12.870> apps<00:04:13.079> and<00:04:13.349> I

manage our presets find more apps and I

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:14.479 
manage our presets find more apps and I
can<00:04:13.590> probably<00:04:13.829> see<00:04:14.010> every<00:04:14.190> role<00:04:14.310> in<00:04:14.400> the

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
can probably see every role in the

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:17.659 
can probably see every role in the
camera<00:04:14.819> and<00:04:15.750> open<00:04:16.200> the<00:04:16.470> info<00:04:16.739> menu<00:04:17.280> so<00:04:17.489> to<00:04:17.549> go

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
camera and open the info menu so to go

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:19.819 
camera and open the info menu so to go
back<00:04:17.700> to<00:04:17.880> that<00:04:17.970> first<00:04:18.030> menu<00:04:18.650> we<00:04:19.650> want<00:04:19.769> to

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
back to that first menu we want to

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:21.500 
back to that first menu we want to
manage<00:04:20.039> our<00:04:20.159> presets<00:04:20.640> and<00:04:20.880> so<00:04:21.180> we<00:04:21.239> come<00:04:21.419> in

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
manage our presets and so we come in

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.220 
manage our presets and so we come in
here<00:04:21.659> and<00:04:21.840> we<00:04:22.079> can<00:04:22.200> create<00:04:22.409> a<00:04:22.530> preset<00:04:23.010> based<00:04:23.340> on

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:24.230 
here and we can create a preset based on

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:27.010 
here and we can create a preset based on
and<00:04:25.130> so<00:04:25.970> we<00:04:26.090> can<00:04:26.210> pick<00:04:26.330> any<00:04:26.480> of<00:04:26.570> the<00:04:26.630> presets

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
and so we can pick any of the presets

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.100 
and so we can pick any of the presets
that<00:04:27.080> currently<00:04:27.410> exist<00:04:27.800> and<00:04:28.010> so<00:04:28.780> let's<00:04:29.780> say

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
that currently exist and so let's say

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:31.780 
that currently exist and so let's say
that<00:04:30.560> we<00:04:30.650> have<00:04:30.800> that<00:04:31.040> one<00:04:31.430> point<00:04:31.670> two

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:31.790 
that we have that one point two

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:33.220 
that we have that one point two
gigahertz<00:04:32.060> one<00:04:32.330> that<00:04:32.480> we<00:04:32.540> have<00:04:32.690> and<00:04:32.960> we're

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:33.230 
gigahertz one that we have and we're

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:35.590 
gigahertz one that we have and we're
going<00:04:33.350> to<00:04:33.380> begin<00:04:33.560> creating<00:04:34.180> we<00:04:35.180> just<00:04:35.360> come<00:04:35.480> in

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600 
going to begin creating we just come in

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.240 
going to begin creating we just come in
here<00:04:35.630> and<00:04:37.030> we<00:04:38.030> give<00:04:38.180> the<00:04:38.270> preset<00:04:38.630> a<00:04:38.660> name<00:04:39.250> see

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
here and we give the preset a name see

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.670 
here and we give the preset a name see
if<00:04:40.340> I<00:04:40.400> can<00:04:40.520> do<00:04:40.610> this<00:04:40.760> wall<00:04:41.530> looking<00:04:42.530> through

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680 
if I can do this wall looking through

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.700 
if I can do this wall looking through
the<00:04:42.770> camera<00:04:42.800> so<00:04:43.790> named<00:04:44.120> max<00:04:44.870> if<00:04:45.020> you<00:04:45.050> sell<00:04:45.320> the

the camera so named max if you sell the

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:51.870 
the camera so named max if you sell the
max<00:04:45.890> clock<00:04:46.250> rate<00:04:46.930> and<00:04:48.670> that's<00:04:50.080> that<00:04:51.080> way<00:04:51.380> and

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:51.880 
max clock rate and that's that way and

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.640 
max clock rate and that's that way and
you<00:04:52.880> know<00:04:52.970> this<00:04:53.180> the<00:04:53.360> settings<00:04:53.630> for<00:04:53.690> slot<00:04:54.020> 1<00:04:54.230> 2

you know this the settings for slot 1 2
3<00:04:54.680> and<00:04:55.130> 4<00:04:55.160> and<00:04:55.960> so<00:04:56.960> we<00:04:57.080> could<00:04:57.200> change<00:04:57.410> these<00:04:57.560> to

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
3 and 4 and so we could change these to

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.470 
3 and 4 and so we could change these to
whatever<00:04:57.920> we<00:04:58.070> want<00:04:58.340> maybe<00:04:58.640> maybe<00:04:59.120> our<00:04:59.330> phone

00:04:59.470 --> 00:04:59.480 
whatever we want maybe maybe our phone

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 
isn't perfectly happy with the stock 1.2

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:02.920 
isn't perfectly happy with the stock 1.2
and<00:05:01.400> we<00:05:01.460> want<00:05:01.610> to<00:05:01.670> up<00:05:02.060> the<00:05:02.240> voltage<00:05:02.420> a<00:05:02.720> little

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
and we want to up the voltage a little

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.800 
and we want to up the voltage a little
bit<00:05:03.020> let's<00:05:03.260> uh<00:05:03.380> let's<00:05:03.680> use<00:05:04.640> that<00:05:04.820> as<00:05:04.910> our<00:05:05.000> test

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810 
bit let's uh let's use that as our test

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:08.410 
bit let's uh let's use that as our test
scenario<00:05:06.290> so<00:05:06.620> we're<00:05:07.250> going<00:05:07.340> to<00:05:07.430> go<00:05:07.490> from<00:05:07.640> 64<00:05:08.390> to

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:08.420 
scenario so we're going to go from 64 to

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:13.810 
scenario so we're going to go from 64 to
66<00:05:09.460> but<00:05:10.460> still<00:05:10.700> just<00:05:10.760> 1.2<00:05:11.210> gates<00:05:11.660> and<00:05:12.430> 66<00:05:13.430> and

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:13.820 
66 but still just 1.2 gates and 66 and

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:16.900 
66 but still just 1.2 gates and 66 and
boom<00:05:14.630> creates<00:05:14.960> a<00:05:14.990> preset<00:05:15.320> and<00:05:15.560> then<00:05:16.490> you<00:05:16.760> also

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:16.910 
boom creates a preset and then you also

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:18.070 
boom creates a preset and then you also
down<00:05:17.150> here<00:05:17.270> at<00:05:17.330> the<00:05:17.360> option<00:05:17.630> to<00:05:17.660> delete<00:05:17.900> a

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.350 
down here at the option to delete a
preset<00:05:18.500> so<00:05:18.740> you<00:05:18.800> can<00:05:18.980> see<00:05:19.190> all<00:05:19.400> of<00:05:19.580> our<00:05:19.970> preset
