said I've changed it because it was a

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:31.960 
said I've changed it because it was a
little<00:00:27.449> small<00:00:27.750> so<00:00:28.560> this<00:00:28.679> is<00:00:28.890> a<00:00:28.919> yamaha<00:00:29.300> mg<00:00:30.349> 16<00:00:31.349> 4

little small so this is a yamaha mg 16 4

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.430 
little small so this is a yamaha mg 16 4
it's<00:00:32.970> a<00:00:33.000> very<00:00:33.270> nice<00:00:33.480> desk<00:00:33.780> actually<00:00:34.050> it's

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
it's a very nice desk actually it's

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.950 
it's a very nice desk actually it's
lightweight<00:00:34.710> nothing<00:00:35.670> much<00:00:35.820> to<00:00:35.850> it<00:00:36.150> it's

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
lightweight nothing much to it it's

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.670 
lightweight nothing much to it it's
pretty<00:00:37.290> solid<00:00:37.830> so<00:00:38.400> okay<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:39.230> it's<00:00:40.230> very<00:00:40.560> easy

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
pretty solid so okay and it's very easy

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.300 
pretty solid so okay and it's very easy
to<00:00:40.890> use<00:00:41.130> somebody<00:00:41.790> who<00:00:41.910> is<00:00:42.060> not<00:00:43.130> expert<00:00:44.130> at

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:44.310 
to use somebody who is not expert at

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.540 
to use somebody who is not expert at
mixing<00:00:44.730> so<00:00:45.300> I<00:00:45.840> could<00:00:46.620> plod<00:00:46.860> along<00:00:46.890> with<00:00:47.430> this

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
mixing so I could plod along with this

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.490 
mixing so I could plod along with this
and<00:00:47.790> I'd<00:00:47.910> learned<00:00:48.240> how<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.420> use<00:00:48.600> it<00:00:48.960> and<00:00:49.080> it's

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
and I'd learned how to use it and it's

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.100 
and I'd learned how to use it and it's
pretty<00:00:49.740> good<00:00:49.950> I<00:00:50.160> like<00:00:50.610> it<00:00:50.640> it's<00:00:51.300> very<00:00:51.510> easy<00:00:51.750> and

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
pretty good I like it it's very easy and

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.920 
pretty good I like it it's very easy and
it'll<00:00:52.560> do<00:00:52.830> the<00:00:53.070> job<00:00:53.180> horses<00:00:54.180> for<00:00:54.360> courses<00:00:54.390> as

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
it'll do the job horses for courses as

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.800 
it'll do the job horses for courses as
they<00:00:55.080> say<00:00:55.290> so<00:00:55.890> on<00:00:56.040> the<00:00:56.160> back<00:00:56.370> end<00:00:56.670> you<00:00:57.030> will

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:57.810 
they say so on the back end you will

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.050 
they say so on the back end you will
notice<00:00:58.230> there<00:00:58.590> that<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:59.310> got<00:00:59.460> all<00:00:59.580> the<00:00:59.820> black

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:00.060 
notice there that you got all the black

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.720 
notice there that you got all the black
XL<00:01:01.020> ARS<00:01:01.200> along<00:01:01.980> there<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:02.310> as<00:01:02.400> you<00:01:02.430> said

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
XL ARS along there and as you said

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.640 
XL ARS along there and as you said
obviously<00:01:03.210> that<00:01:03.390> would<00:01:03.600> click<00:01:03.900> in<00:01:04.080> your

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
obviously that would click in your

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.810 
obviously that would click in your
microphone<00:01:05.189> as<00:01:06.050> that<00:01:07.050> dead-simple<00:01:07.770> so<00:01:08.670> let's

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
microphone as that dead-simple so let's

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.420 
microphone as that dead-simple so let's
put<00:01:08.970> that<00:01:09.000> out<00:01:09.150> of<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.480> way<00:01:09.680> now<00:01:10.680> then<00:01:10.920> this<00:01:11.370> is

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
put that out of the way now then this is

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.960 
put that out of the way now then this is
a<00:01:11.610> 16<00:01:12.270> channel<00:01:12.540> mixer<00:01:13.500> so<00:01:14.280> as<00:01:14.370> you<00:01:14.490> see<00:01:14.790> along

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
a 16 channel mixer so as you see along

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.050 
a 16 channel mixer so as you see along
the<00:01:15.150> front<00:01:15.420> here<00:01:15.590> you've<00:01:16.590> got<00:01:16.860> up<00:01:17.040> to<00:01:17.310> 16

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
the front here you've got up to 16

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.810 
the front here you've got up to 16
channels<00:01:18.470> now<00:01:19.470> I'm<00:01:19.770> not<00:01:19.950> an<00:01:20.070> expert<00:01:20.340> so<00:01:20.520> I

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
channels now I'm not an expert so I

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.550 
channels now I'm not an expert so I
don't<00:01:21.180> know<00:01:21.300> I<00:01:21.540> don't<00:01:21.840> understand<00:01:22.290> but<00:01:22.500> for

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
don't know I don't understand but for

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.260 
don't know I don't understand but for
some<00:01:22.800> reason<00:01:23.159> once<00:01:23.340> you<00:01:23.460> get<00:01:23.610> as<00:01:23.700> far<00:01:23.730> as<00:01:24.060> 9

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
some reason once you get as far as 9

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.740 
some reason once you get as far as 9
left<00:01:24.570> you<00:01:24.690> go<00:01:24.810> 9<00:01:25.020> 10<00:01:25.260> 11<00:01:25.380> 12<00:01:25.590> 13<00:01:25.770> 14<00:01:26.040> 15<00:01:26.370> 16<00:01:26.760> these

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
left you go 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 these

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.530 
left you go 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 these
two<00:01:27.990> tone<00:01:28.170> of<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.470> gain<00:01:28.680> controls<00:01:29.190> either<00:01:29.580> so

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
two tone of the gain controls either so

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.370 
two tone of the gain controls either so
what<00:01:31.080> you<00:01:31.290> will<00:01:31.530> find<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.220> loss<00:01:32.430> is<00:01:32.640> 16

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
what you will find the loss is 16

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.010 
what you will find the loss is 16
channel<00:01:34.380> desk<00:01:34.740> because<00:01:35.550> obviously<00:01:35.880> I<00:01:36.360> suppose

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
channel desk because obviously I suppose

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.560 
channel desk because obviously I suppose
they'd<00:01:37.320> assume<00:01:37.680> you<00:01:37.979> using<00:01:38.570> various

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
they'd assume you using various

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.420 
they'd assume you using various
instruments<00:01:39.990> they're<00:01:40.440> for<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.770> drummer<00:01:41.070> the

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
instruments they're for the drummer the

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.480 
instruments they're for the drummer the
problem<00:01:42.330> is<00:01:42.450> is<00:01:42.659> you<00:01:42.810> need<00:01:43.020> plenty<00:01:43.560> of<00:01:43.800> the<00:01:43.950> XLR

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
problem is is you need plenty of the XLR

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.870 
problem is is you need plenty of the XLR
units<00:01:45.330> not<00:01:45.990> jacks<00:01:46.560> because<00:01:47.340> if<00:01:47.430> you<00:01:47.490> use<00:01:47.700> the

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
units not jacks because if you use the

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.820 
units not jacks because if you use the
jacks<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.479> problem<00:01:48.900> is<00:01:49.049> is<00:01:49.229> that<00:01:49.260> you<00:01:49.530> gains

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 
jacks the problem is is that you gains

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.000 
jacks the problem is is that you gains
you<00:01:50.220> I<00:01:50.490> worked<00:01:51.180> too<00:01:51.690> hard<00:01:51.720> you<00:01:52.530> attend

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.010 
you I worked too hard you attend

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.219 
you I worked too hard you attend
you'll<00:01:53.520> be<00:01:53.640> wounded<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.150> right<00:01:54.330> up<00:01:54.540> to<00:01:55.020> try

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
you'll be wounded and right up to try

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.870 
you'll be wounded and right up to try
and<00:01:55.350> get<00:01:55.440> any<00:01:55.590> sound<00:01:55.950> to<00:01:56.070> come<00:01:56.310> through<00:01:56.640> and

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
and get any sound to come through and

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.030 
and get any sound to come through and
then<00:01:57.330> you<00:01:57.510> can<00:01:57.690> increase<00:01:57.810> your<00:01:58.049> noise<00:01:58.440> levels

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
then you can increase your noise levels

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.149 
then you can increase your noise levels
on<00:01:59.299> Jackson<00:02:00.299> not<00:02:00.479> as<00:02:00.659> good<00:02:00.900> as<00:02:01.080> an<00:02:01.260> XLR<00:02:01.740> for

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
on Jackson not as good as an XLR for

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.120 
on Jackson not as good as an XLR for
noise<00:02:02.520> level<00:02:02.909> in<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.150> lead<00:02:03.330> either<00:02:03.869> so<00:02:04.860> I

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130

on with it okay so that's that then you

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.050 
on with it okay so that's that then you
will<00:03:05.940> need<00:03:06.570> to<00:03:06.750> connect<00:03:07.080> this<00:03:07.230> to<00:03:07.440> the<00:03:07.830> PC<00:03:08.700> so

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
will need to connect this to the PC so

will need to connect this to the PC so
that<00:03:09.090> you<00:03:09.360> can<00:03:09.510> actually<00:03:10.970> record<00:03:11.970> obviously

okay<00:03:19.650> you<00:03:20.220> can<00:03:20.430> tweak<00:03:20.880> them<00:03:21.120> but<00:03:21.930> then<00:03:22.140> you<00:03:22.320> can

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
okay you can tweak them but then you can

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.770 
okay you can tweak them but then you can
tweak<00:03:22.770> it<00:03:22.830> further<00:03:23.370> by<00:03:24.000> using<00:03:24.030> something<00:03:24.660> like

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
tweak it further by using something like

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.250 
tweak it further by using something like
audacity<00:03:25.500> so<00:03:25.710> to<00:03:25.770> do<00:03:26.040> that<00:03:26.280> you<00:03:27.030> need<00:03:27.240> a<00:03:27.510> little

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
audacity so to do that you need a little

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.400 
audacity so to do that you need a little
lead<00:03:29.060> we<00:03:30.060> can<00:03:30.090> see<00:03:30.390> that<00:03:30.540> because<00:03:31.020> it's<00:03:31.200> tucked

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
lead we can see that because it's tucked

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.830 
lead we can see that because it's tucked
