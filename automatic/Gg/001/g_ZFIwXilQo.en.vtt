00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.420 
you want what I like to do is actually
take<00:02:58.660> a<00:02:58.959> piece<00:02:59.530> of<00:02:59.560> the<00:02:59.739> scrap<00:03:00.040> that<00:03:00.069> I<00:03:00.220> cut<00:03:00.400> out

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
take a piece of the scrap that I cut out

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.309 
take a piece of the scrap that I cut out
from<00:03:00.730> the<00:03:00.849> center<00:03:01.090> of<00:03:01.269> the<00:03:02.280> of<00:03:03.280> the<00:03:04.090> doily<00:03:05.080> and

from the center of the of the doily and

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:07.320 
from the center of the of the doily and
because<00:03:06.130> washy<00:03:06.280> tick<00:03:06.580> is<00:03:06.790> semi-transparent

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
because washy tick is semi-transparent

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.600 
because washy tick is semi-transparent
so<00:03:08.110> what<00:03:08.200> I<00:03:08.230> do<00:03:08.319> is<00:03:08.410> I<00:03:08.620> stick<00:03:08.890> cut<00:03:09.069> in<00:03:09.160> half<00:03:09.400> on
