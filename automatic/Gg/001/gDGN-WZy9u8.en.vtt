00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:07.200
 hello again mx recording once more 

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:10.020
 another video really took all the 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.750
 day waiting for lights to turn off 

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:15.660
 music but that seems like it's not going to 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.890
 happen and it's going to happen to me at night like that 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.810
 that anyway I will be of 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.060
 record the video an apology in advance 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.869
 for the background music 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:27.060
 this has happened how can I notice already 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.009
 they put the brackets on my teeth 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.579
 superior materials that were needed 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:34.949
 what happened finally the fangs were 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.809
 they did round 2 enough like 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:39.420
 so that these teeth could fit 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.220
 I was telling you that before I 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:46.230
 put the brackets on the upper ones 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:50.190
 side was very marked as a 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.079
 gap line between this and that and 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.449
 students anyway for their 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.570
 account had already begun to be made 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:00.689
 forward in fact I will see my 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:04.100
 mouth and as there was considerable space 

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:07.140
 in the fang and the front tooth but 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.090
 and I will put the brackets and 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.920
 started to overtake and in fact I already 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.400
 I think they came forward I do not know 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.400
 they insure 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:22.010
 I can smile 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.659
 and the smile is no longer seen as before 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.390
 quite a change with respect when 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:29.450
 I started using the brackets this 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.790
 when they put me now the brackets of 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.440
 the lateral superiors months to levels 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.960
 I already had enough time not 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:39.540
 it happened and it hurt me 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.190
 you can not celebrate it is the sunset 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.430
 that all lion 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:47.730
 what hurt me was when it was happening 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.830
 the time for the night time of 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:51.840
 done another punishable I do not know something like 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.170
 pap or something like that because it hurt 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.170
 quite 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.610
 If I had to describe how they felt 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.180
 and how it would have hit in 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:04.870
 the mouth and I would like to celebrate 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:07.270
 that's how it feels but nothing more 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:10.060
 a single day in which I felt the others 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:13.120
 great training days and normal mouth yes 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.010
 I can not bite yet with these 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.890
 teeth that put them in which 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.720
 I just can not and I had not given 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.370
 account because I have continued eating 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.860
 as I usually like but the other day 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.360
 I grabbed an apple and the one that moderated 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.670
 one bites her in this way from the side and 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.050
 I got my teeth so what I'm 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.910
 doing is alvaro the apple in the 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.540
 part by a knife and now yes the 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.000
 I can eat 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.459
 this with regard to how they have been 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.340
 putting driving my teeth in these 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:42.590
 I told them that before they put me 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.739
 some species like crooked chains 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:49.040
 to pull the fangs back 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:51.890
 but good in this case is premolar 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:54.170
 then millet but instead of using 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.329
 these chains changed the focus and 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.639
 now what they have been using have 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:03:00.620
 been a species of springs and 

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:03.069
 literally it's a spring to see if it 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.069
 catch up to see 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.650
 good is this I think it did not distinguish 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:14.010
 very well as a spring 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:14.010
 this is or not and here we have another 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:23.230
 these springs tells me the 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:24.660
 orthodontist who are not stronger than 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.790
 the chains that I was using 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.620
 previously however it is a way 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.420
 different from when I started 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.760
 definitely if we do not see from the 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.740
 side of how they work while a 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.050
 they support some more back teeth and 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:40.120
 pull these back what the 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:43.630
 spring they are doing is they are 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.940
 pushing are complicating the teeth 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:47.410
 these chains these springs I do not 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.980
 I used to have here on top 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:53.770
 but they have already taken them away because 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:56.710
 you do not need those and I do not 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:59.470
 I would consider, however, that my 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:02.260
 children who would have stumbled as commented 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:07.180
 does not exist that was going to happen I see very 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:09.130
 close this fang from premolar but 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:12.580
 in this second premolar but I do not see 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:14.290
 that have run up well I do not know if the 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:18.450
 I really do not have a very good perspective 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.450
 because there is like itself 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:25.110
 but what I feel if there is a small 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:28.350
 of separation that remained there and the truth 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.330
 it looks like they're going to leave that other 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.210
 side 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:34.330
 fifteen 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:35.770
 small separation on the side of the 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.199
 mental challenges good if it would be very nice 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.150
 what father has nothing else with that 

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:42.310
 Hair slope because it is not to be 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:46.120
 it was there I do not know what is going to happen with 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:49.830
 she from the bottom of her teeth 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.830
 they have been advancing little by little 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:55.100
 here in fact already practically mole that 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:58.150
 still looks like the little one with the 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.150
 typical or I think it 's up 

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:04.809
 there is almost indication of sailing and the goods 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:04.809
 they are a help 

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:10.680
 here 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:12.750
 and the separation casino 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:15.340
 and yet I do not see what is going to fall 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:17.860
 this tooth 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:19.540
 and that worries me a little too 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:22.500
 this other side if there is more space 

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:22.500
 still to move 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.570
 the separation is bigger but good 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:30.370
 here remember that was where the 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:32.199
 gene of its discharge that I had to 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:33.850
 extract and that we take to know 

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:36.630
 that extraction then it's normal that 

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:40.050
 go more backward 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:42.180
 since in that space it will fit 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:45.000
 and I do not know if with those in the case also 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:46.259
 there is room for this I hope yes yes 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.240
 I believe that if the teeth of 

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:51.720
 down if you can get the space that 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:53.669
 he needed the advance they are going to stay 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:57.360
 completely closed there because I see 

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:59.400
 quite with this business this is the 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.790
 Ramos recently with the slope 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:04.010
 that the arch 

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:06.250
 alcohol about the same as I have here 

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:06.250
 behind 

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:12.500
 bump the laterals with these teeth 

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:12.500
 lower 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:20.580
 and good but it has been worse all this 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:22.240
 time you should not worry so much what 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:25.120
 it worries me 

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:27.370
 is that I get stuck food there and 

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:29.199
 I can not get it out of effort 

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:33.430
 extraordinary but for example right now 

00:06:29.199 --> 00:06:35.470
 behind him in this tooth 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:37.360
 arcosur equal there are some small 

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:39.430
 food particles that I can 

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:41.140
 identify who is there and there are people with 

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:43.600
 the toothbrush with my brush 

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:46.270
 interdental with the floss I have not 

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:48.370
 I could take it out, it worries me a little bit 

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:50.260
 because the gum looks a bit digital and 

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:53.410
 so irrational but as much as he tried to 

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:55.660
 put it in vier is not studying I hope 

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:58.660
 that the year not so much to do much since 

00:06:55.660 --> 00:07:01.420
 I can remove that arch and bathrooms 

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:03.940
 dark enough for now these 

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:05.620
 they are the news that I have I am at a 

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:07.390
 week of completing a year with the 

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:09.670
 brackets and that I hope to be able to record look 

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:11.560
 just that day like to put look 

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:13.630
 here I am a year after I 

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:16.090
 they put the brackets for the products 

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:18.300
 It would be everything and see you until next time 

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:18.300
 bye
