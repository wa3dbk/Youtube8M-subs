00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 
why why does it only work on certain

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:16.700 
why why does it only work on certain
ones<00:05:06.360> I<00:05:06.840> don't<00:05:07.379> know<00:05:08.240> run<00:05:11.030> slow<00:05:12.229> down<00:05:15.710> slow

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710 
ones I don't know run slow down slow

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.080 
ones I don't know run slow down slow
down

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090
