00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.240
 new video that I bring you a new 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.849
 boxing for the channel as you see is a 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.620
 command of xbox 360 quiet that I do not 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.080
 they bought any xbox you already know that I 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.910
 I'm a playstation Taliban and 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.859
 basically this command is to play 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.060
 the pc games I'm starting my 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:23.070
 adventure worth 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.630
 the pc games and well this command 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.420
 A great friend has recommended it to me 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.039
 hollywood is a youtuber okay I imagine 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.990
 that many will know him if he does not 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.390
 you know, I'll leave you the link worth of 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.309
 your channel in the description you will enter 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.460
 your channel and subscribe 'aces' 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:41.489
 so without questions is very majete of the 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.379
 truth and I will be very good and good 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.550
 because I'm playing with him lately 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:49.469
 many pc games and I'm with the 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.059
 control of playstation 3 and the x father x 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.270
 parents a program that assigned by 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:57.059
 example the keyboard keys to the command 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.770
 the stage come together one by one 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.309
 that's already a punch, but when 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.269
 you do that in the game the command sometimes 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:08.140
 he does not answer you 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:10.149
 fails much more with the feira shotgun and 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.649
 then this flight command convinced me 

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:13.600
 he said one night he understands me then 

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:16.539
 pleased then part what there is a 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.909
 twice and I bought it I have put 24 

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:21.490
 euros ok I asked him to amazon here is the 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:24.850
 amazon box why 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.920
 they are very hard workers in the boxes and what 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.560
 is the good this side sincerely 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.270
 that is configured only when connecting it is 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.790
 80 percent of the games you 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.600
 you connect the command and it is already configured 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:39.759
 you just do not have to assign any keys 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.610
 commanding the truth is that it is fucking great 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:45.189
 bell lots of abba props i can play 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:48.789
 navas and plug it in and I 've messed with the 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:50.710
 x parent assigned buttons for 24 euros 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:53.380
 to be honest 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.900
 I'm staying with this we're going to open pardon 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.960
 by the brightness 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:01.780
 to see how we open ourselves to see if we did 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.650
 it's a lot of fuss over some put eight here 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.650
 a thousand tabs here 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.080
 let's use the monger hands 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.980
 Let's see 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.769
 over here we have 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.410
 of installation 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.450
 and here is the command 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:29.620
 we are all good now yes no 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:32.050
 shines and good the command 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.330
 the only thing is more ligerito is worth 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.130
 xbox basically because I do not think not 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.450
 you have the stack that carries the controls 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.090
 team the truth that had few 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.920
 xbox screen in hand 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:45.640
 and a good part of the advantages that I have 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:48.280
 said then I'm seeing that the triggers 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:51.489
 they go around what 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:54.940

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:57.459
