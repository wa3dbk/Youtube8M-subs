00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:17.440 
one is plastic that's one of the

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.370 
one is plastic that's one of the
drawbacks<00:05:17.590> but<00:05:18.190> the<00:05:18.880> year<00:05:19.120> copies<00:05:19.659> I<00:05:19.930> don't

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:20.380

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:39.430 
overall based on death the design itself

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:46.080 
overall based on death the design itself
i<00:05:39.940> think<00:05:42.300> this<00:05:43.300> is<00:05:44.259> amazing<00:05:44.650> you<00:05:44.979> see<00:05:45.190> gold

signature body you know at least have
something<00:05:59.139> there<00:05:59.500> and<00:05:59.880> then<00:06:00.880> the<00:06:01.120> cable<00:06:01.860> like

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:02.860 
something there and then the cable like

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:05.519 
something there and then the cable like
this<00:06:03.130> one<00:06:03.400> is<00:06:03.940> not<00:06:04.210> like<00:06:04.449> long<00:06:04.779> cable<00:06:05.259> but<00:06:05.440> you
