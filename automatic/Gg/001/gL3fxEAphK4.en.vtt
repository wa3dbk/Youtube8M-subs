00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:05.730
 hello and welcome to 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:08.639
 I show you something today 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.260
 at first remember the whole rollo first 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.990
 Let's look at the past 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.450
 halo 2 every gamer on first person 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.789
 Shooter stands that is a concept 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.680
 used to have with the xbox and the 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.600
 so called kettle of pinnacle one 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.070
 time started in the so much 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.890
 dismantling were created 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.769
 a montage were cut together 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.380
 is your own game scenes you in one 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.390
 impressive video presented that 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.670
 that of pinnacle was at that time of the 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.829
 quality the best, but even for yourself 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.160
 then conditions were not sufficient 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.290
 was 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.360
 you have basically not even the 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.960
 picture quality which s.Television to 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.420
 was see 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.000
 the players on the computer used so far 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.070
 no or probably rare hardware 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.550
 for the recordings but rather the 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.219
 program 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.140
 fraps with big loss of performance in the 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.270
 but of course that too 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.460
 Gameplay suffered from the lack of a man 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.980
 entire screen in her witty 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.680
 record large video files completely 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.570
 though the quality of the video fit 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.520
 however one had within shortest 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.750
 time a full hard drive and could 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.420
 do not continue recording 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.280
 so the company elgato left something 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.900
 come to mind 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:19.110
 here in my hand I have the first 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.110
 game capture hb we'll take a look 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.040
 what the part has on it 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.040
 basically thought was the small 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.780
 device for the consoles like xbox 360 and 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.090
 playstation 3 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.040
 Therefore, it offers a hdmi input to 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.860
 connection to the console and a 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.689
 Exit to the TV basically reads 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.659
 nothing about the compatibility with the 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.670
 computer platform for me consoles 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:45.450
 rather taboo I made the attempt on 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.979
 pc the picture you just see 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.090
 has been with the game capture 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:52.439
 recorded 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:54.540
 on a graphics card on the dvi output 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:58.920
 hangs at this moment a 27 inch 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:01.649
 screen with 1920 x 1080 pixels 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.409
 as well as a hdmi exit and am 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:07.320
 USB port the game capture like you 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.330
 I can see the pictures issue 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.979
 is worth it so I can almost speak mouth 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.000
 work and at the same time that will 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.490
 same signal 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.870
 sent to the game capture which 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.560
 again on the same computer 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:21.510
 is connected and receives everything 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.370
 since I do not like a fraps to a 3d 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.350
 I am bound to program directly 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.870
 record the entire screen and 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.790
 thus also reviews or even tutorials 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.080
 create 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.930
 next , I'm interested in the 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.300
 compatibility of the resolutions to 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:45.110
 i worked the desktop here to see the 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:45.110
 Resolutions like 800 x 600 1024 x 768 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:03:13.670
 1280 x 720 1366 x 768 1600 times 900 1920 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:16.049
 x 1080 and also 2,560 x 1,600 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.870
 which does not give me the game capture though 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:22.590
 natively , however, records in real time 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:25.650
 19 20 x 1080 payable executable 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.160
 seems all resolutions up to 1020 x 1080 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.299
 to be 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:31.140
 But I've tried the times 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:33.959
 Common this is the program 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.700
 which is supplied by elgato in 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.560
 left area I have a preview 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.590
 of what the game capture just 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.120
 logically you can see now 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.730
 how it absorbs itself 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.530
 the program has almost a kind 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.989
 Buffer with a few seconds remaining 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:52.040
 be recorded on the spot before the 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:53.910
 Recording starts after the recording 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.579
 the raw video is converted to 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:58.440
 background directly to one 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:01.680
 predefined folder in my 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:04.769
 desired mp4 1080p 30 frames format 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.840
 video and meanwhile i can already 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:08.010
 a new recording even while running 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.989
 start conversion 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.239
 thus it is even possible from the 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:14.790
 running game for example with alta 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:16.859
 to switch out and take the picture 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.079
 stop and start over again 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:21.000
 to have a video for every game 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.510
 I have a little bit of the sound 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.120
 trickery 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.030
 Basically you have a sound output on 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.430
 computer only 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:30.670
 about a device in the case that would be mine 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.960
 5.1 box system 's creative sound card 

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:34.690
 even allows me an extra 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.730
 issue about hdmi moment like capture 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.919
 connected 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:41.740
 I have the sound symbol on the left 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:45.340
 next to the clock on the state bar one 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:48.930
 right-click to then open 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.930
 click to hear the recording device 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:55.540
 Here I have what you hear what 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:57.250
 a virtual device on my part 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:01.660
 Sound card is on the standard device 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:04.510
 defined with a double click on 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:06.970
 I could listen to these under the tab 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:09.790
 a hook on this device as 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:12.360
 set playback source and use 

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:15.610
 my hdmi-exit in the list talk 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:17.440
 Now I have sound over in real time 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:19.300
 my boxes to play freely 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.010
 can and also gets the game 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:25.330
 capture not only a full hd but 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:26.710
 also a 5.1 sound signal supplied to the 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.990
 Point of performance loss is the 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:30.610
 decisive here, however, is the 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:31.960
 loss of power only on the computer 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:34.000
 attributed to itself 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.370
 with my computer system yes I give 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.770
 It was very exaggerated to me 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:40.930
 not a frame loss rather lies 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:43.479
 However, it s.der new graphics cards 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:45.490
 series of nvidia with the six cards 

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:47.289
 you just have the advantage of that series 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:49.990
 another connected monitor on 

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:52.740
 the same graphics card virtually without 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:56.110
 further loss of performance 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:58.330
 at that time I will be even with 3 480 gtx 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:59.650
 and while cloning on my tv 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:01.710
 got pretty problems 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:05.650
 runs the now simply called 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:08.770
 So I would say that with one 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:10.680
 i5 and one example gtx 660 

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:13.330
 already without problems 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:15.430
 this would be of advantage if you have the 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:18.789
 conversions besides playing in the 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:22.479
 wants to drain background my 

00:06:18.789 --> 00:06:24.940
 conclusion after unpacking the device was 

00:06:22.479 --> 00:06:26.410
 I initially skeptical no additional 

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:28.630
 power supply what the device with power 

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:29.080
 where does it supply the power from 

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:31.150
 to take 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:33.820
 nevertheless here is enough usb 

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:35.330
 connection probably completely out of the size 

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:37.669
 I was astonished 

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:39.259
 that is such a small part of his 

00:06:37.669 --> 00:06:41.900
 technology I had not expected 

00:06:39.259 --> 00:06:43.550
 Basically you should almost the device 

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:47.330
 give my name to another name 

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:48.740
 would be multimedia capture full hd one has 

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:50.479
 not only the possibility of playing scenes 

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:52.129
 but also tutorials from 

00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:54.110
 to create complicated programs 

00:06:52.129 --> 00:06:56.330
 and probably in the next 

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:57.039
 widespread resolution and very good 

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:59.930
 quality 

00:06:57.039 --> 00:07:01.310
 I think that's awesome in itself 

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:04.729
 my system no loss of performance 

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:06.909
 measurable is the proud price of 179 

00:07:04.729 --> 00:07:09.469
 euro is therefore justified 

00:07:06.909 --> 00:07:11.240
 I would still wish it there yes 

00:07:09.469 --> 00:07:13.250
 Now it is known that for the pc 

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:15.440
 recording far more than work 

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:18.259
 even more support for the pc 

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:19.940
 comes user without a creative sound 

00:07:18.259 --> 00:07:20.599
 just would therefore have no sound at 

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:22.940
 take up 

00:07:20.599 --> 00:07:24.889
 maybe it is possible here as at 

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:26.840
 creative to introduce an option 

00:07:24.889 --> 00:07:29.360
 the a virtual recording device 

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:30.740
 implement that was then I will 

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:32.779
 even on a fixed look at the 

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:35.270
 key combination thankfully the the 

00:07:32.779 --> 00:07:36.620
 Recording starts and then stops 

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:38.240
 you can not get out of the game anymore 

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:38.889
 wish to use the software too 

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:41.210
 can 

00:07:38.889 --> 00:07:43.990
 All in all, I can allgäu gmbh 

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:45.889
 which classify as very good 

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:48.529
 I would also like to thank elgato 

00:07:45.889 --> 00:07:50.690
 for sponsoring the product for 

00:07:48.529 --> 00:07:53.080
 my computer project project ex 

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:56.650
 Thanks a lot and see you soon
