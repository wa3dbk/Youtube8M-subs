00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:50.839 
of a July it's really annoying and

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:54.079 
of a July it's really annoying and
nothing<00:00:51.839> reason<00:00:52.260> why<00:00:52.440> I<00:00:52.679> put<00:00:52.890> it<00:00:52.979> on<00:00:53.100> last<00:00:53.460> is

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:54.089 
nothing reason why I put it on last is

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:55.969 
nothing reason why I put it on last is
because<00:00:54.539> it<00:00:54.659> does<00:00:54.780> leg<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.199> little<00:00:55.469> bit<00:00:55.589> even

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:55.979

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.759 
and the reason why I put it for number
three<00:03:41.430> is<00:03:41.670> that<00:03:41.880> it's<00:03:42.090> already<00:03:42.359> well-known<00:03:42.769> so

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
three is that it's already well-known so

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:46.520 
three is that it's already well-known so
now<00:03:44.640> what<00:03:44.790> you<00:03:44.880> can<00:03:44.910> move<00:03:45.120> into<00:03:45.329> number<00:03:46.170> two

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
now what you can move into number two

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.539 
now what you can move into number two
anything<00:03:47.280> yet<00:03:47.370> say<00:03:47.609> no<00:03:47.880> anything<00:03:48.750> anyone<00:03:49.140> um

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:49.549 
anything yet say no anything anyone um

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:52.039 
anything yet say no anything anyone um
just<00:03:50.549> say<00:03:50.790> I'd<00:03:51.150> recommend<00:03:51.510> playing<00:03:51.900> the

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
just say I'd recommend playing the

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:54.050 
just say I'd recommend playing the
server<00:03:52.290> if<00:03:52.470> you're<00:03:52.590> in<00:03:52.680> for<00:03:52.890> a<00:03:52.920> minigame<00:03:53.310> type

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
server if you're in for a minigame type

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.750 
server if you're in for a minigame type
deal<00:03:54.560> exactly<00:03:55.560> that's<00:03:55.769> reason<00:03:56.040> why<00:03:56.250> we<00:03:56.459> put<00:03:56.670> it

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
deal exactly that's reason why we put it

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.569 
deal exactly that's reason why we put it
in<00:03:56.850> here<00:03:57.000> I<00:03:57.239> also<00:03:57.630> had<00:03:57.930> some<00:03:58.440> like<00:03:59.010> survival

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
in here I also had some like survival

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:02.690 
in here I also had some like survival
games<00:03:59.790> super<00:04:00.090> smash<00:04:00.569> mobb<00:04:00.900> bridges<00:04:01.620> etc<00:04:02.280> etc

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
games super smash mobb bridges etc etc

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.410 
games super smash mobb bridges etc etc
so<00:04:03.540> we'll<00:04:03.720> see<00:04:03.930> you<00:04:03.959> guys<00:04:04.290> later<00:04:04.819> on<00:04:05.819> the<00:04:06.180> next

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
so we'll see you guys later on the next

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.319 
so we'll see you guys later on the next
one<00:04:06.569> and<00:04:07.100> come<00:04:08.100> on<00:04:08.220> she<00:04:08.430> was<00:04:08.579> server<00:04:08.850> number

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 
one and come on she was server number

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:13.849 
one and come on she was server number
two<00:04:10.069> alright<00:04:11.069> guys<00:04:11.280> at<00:04:12.090> number<00:04:12.630> two<00:04:13.079> we<00:04:13.680> have

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:13.859 
two alright guys at number two we have

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:16.099 
two alright guys at number two we have
our<00:04:14.100> server<00:04:14.519> and<00:04:14.700> the<00:04:14.790> only<00:04:14.940> reason<00:04:15.030> I<00:04:15.660> put<00:04:15.930> s

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
our server and the only reason I put s

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:18.319 
our server and the only reason I put s
third<00:04:16.410> is<00:04:16.829> because<00:04:17.190> there's<00:04:17.340> no<00:04:17.669> other<00:04:17.910> server

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:18.329 
third is because there's no other server

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:21.589 
third is because there's no other server
like<00:04:18.630> ours<00:04:18.900> it<00:04:19.560> is<00:04:19.769> a<00:04:19.799> faction<00:04:20.459> op<00:04:20.669> kit<00:04:21.359> I<00:04:21.539> know

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:21.599 
like ours it is a faction op kit I know

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:24.470 
like ours it is a faction op kit I know
that<00:04:21.750> okay<00:04:22.380> I<00:04:22.409> know<00:04:22.590> this<00:04:22.770> but<00:04:23.700> the<00:04:24.090> whole

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:24.480 
that okay I know this but the whole

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:25.640 
that okay I know this but the whole
reason<00:04:24.690> why<00:04:24.900> I<00:04:24.930> think<00:04:25.290> it's<00:04:25.410> a<00:04:25.470> hundred

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
reason why I think it's a hundred

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.230 
reason why I think it's a hundred
percent<00:04:25.740> different<00:04:26.220> is<00:04:26.610> because<00:04:26.670> you<00:04:26.970> can<00:04:27.090> do

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
percent different is because you can do

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.720 
percent different is because you can do
whatever<00:04:27.510> the<00:04:27.660> fuck<00:04:27.690> you<00:04:27.990> want<00:04:28.470> you<00:04:29.160> can<00:04:29.370> swear

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:29.730 
whatever the fuck you want you can swear

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.210 
whatever the fuck you want you can swear
you<00:04:30.390> can't<00:04:30.810> cry<00:04:31.140> like<00:04:31.380> a<00:04:31.410> little<00:04:31.620> bitch<00:04:31.830> okay

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220
