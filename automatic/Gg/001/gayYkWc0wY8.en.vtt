 weald an it is also really with 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.460
 happens and the charge in the message from 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.150
 I also think this film is genuine 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.150
 special 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.370
 the end of this movie in the end that 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.900
 at least 10 minutes and that is pretty good 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.850
 crazy because you just know 10 minutes long 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.320
 what will happen and still be fascinated 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.210
 and because it takes so long for you too 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.800
 the emotional jitters come up that way 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:07.340
 and at the end of the film you can 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:09.590
 releasing completely takes on how and now 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:12.670

 emotional touches I'm really 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.420
 wonder where you come from and I don't have it 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:41.099
 immediately about crying but just for a moment 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.019
 that you are touched by what you see 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:45.060
