00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
you're just gonna keep doing that for a

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.469 
you're just gonna keep doing that for a
while<00:01:48.689> until<00:01:49.909> you<00:01:50.909> think<00:01:51.180> you<00:01:51.270> have<00:01:51.450> a

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
while until you think you have a

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.499 
while until you think you have a
sufficient<00:01:52.049> amount<00:01:52.079> of<00:01:52.350> loops<00:01:52.619> it's<00:01:53.509> probably

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
sufficient amount of loops it's probably

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.889 
sufficient amount of loops it's probably
gonna<00:01:54.600> make<00:01:54.840> your<00:01:54.960> hand<00:01:55.229> cramp<00:01:56.780> holding<00:01:57.780> these

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
gonna make your hand cramp holding these

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.380 
gonna make your hand cramp holding these
all<00:01:58.170> together<00:01:58.380> that's<00:01:59.070> perfectly<00:01:59.670> normal

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
all together that's perfectly normal

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.590 
all together that's perfectly normal
don't<00:02:01.110> be<00:02:01.290> alarmed<00:02:01.880> now<00:02:02.880> I<00:02:02.909> have

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
don't be alarmed now I have

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.810 
don't be alarmed now I have
five<00:02:05.600> loops<00:02:06.020> on<00:02:06.200> each<00:02:06.410> side<00:02:06.770> I<00:02:07.220> just<00:02:07.430> went

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
five loops on each side I just went

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.880 
five loops on each side I just went
ahead<00:02:07.910> and<00:02:08.450> use<00:02:08.720> my<00:02:08.990> whole<00:02:09.170> ribbon<00:02:09.500> now<00:02:09.680> I<00:02:09.710> have

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
ahead and use my whole ribbon now I have

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.190 
ahead and use my whole ribbon now I have
a<00:02:09.950> little<00:02:10.220> wire<00:02:10.970> thing<00:02:11.480> to<00:02:11.750> hold<00:02:11.960> it<00:02:12.080> together

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
a little wire thing to hold it together

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.360 
a little wire thing to hold it together
you<00:02:12.500> should<00:02:12.530> probably<00:02:12.800> have<00:02:12.980> this<00:02:13.130> ahead<00:02:13.310> of

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
you should probably have this ahead of

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:14.710 
you should probably have this ahead of
time<00:02:13.460> and<00:02:13.730> you<00:02:13.790> bend<00:02:14.030> it<00:02:14.150> in<00:02:14.240> the<00:02:14.330> middle<00:02:14.570> and

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
time and you bend it in the middle and

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.940 
time and you bend it in the middle and
then<00:02:15.350> you<00:02:15.470> just<00:02:17.080> you<00:02:18.080> slip<00:02:18.350> it<00:02:18.440> over<00:02:18.530> and<00:02:18.890> you

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
then you just you slip it over and you

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.570 
then you just you slip it over and you
just<00:02:19.100> go<00:02:19.280> straight<00:02:19.670> down<00:02:20.560> on<00:02:21.560> one<00:02:21.950> side<00:02:21.980> of<00:02:22.400> the

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
just go straight down on one side of the

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.500 
just go straight down on one side of the
loop<00:02:22.760> and<00:02:23.060> then<00:02:24.280> you<00:02:25.280> wrap<00:02:25.520> it<00:02:25.550> around<00:02:25.790> and<00:02:26.450> you

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
loop and then you wrap it around and you

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:32.170 
loop and then you wrap it around and you
twist<00:02:27.470> it<00:02:27.680> in<00:02:27.950> the<00:02:28.790> back<00:02:29.030> of<00:02:29.270> the<00:02:29.420> ribbon<00:02:31.180> loop

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
twist it in the back of the ribbon loop

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.230 
twist it in the back of the ribbon loop
and<00:02:32.450> then<00:02:33.460> it'll<00:02:34.460> hold<00:02:34.730> it<00:02:34.850> like<00:02:35.000> this

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240 
and then it'll hold it like this

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.200 
and then it'll hold it like this
and<00:02:35.480> this<00:02:35.630> looks<00:02:36.110> like<00:02:36.410> nothing<00:02:36.920> right<00:02:37.130> now

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
and this looks like nothing right now

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.670 
and this looks like nothing right now
but<00:02:38.210> then<00:02:38.390> you<00:02:38.630> just<00:02:38.660> you<00:02:39.050> take<00:02:39.320> your<00:02:39.530> little

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
but then you just you take your little

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.560 
but then you just you take your little
loops<00:02:39.980> and<00:02:40.340> you<00:02:40.640> kind<00:02:40.880> of<00:02:40.940> spread<00:02:41.240> them<00:02:41.480> out

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
loops and you kind of spread them out

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.140 
loops and you kind of spread them out
and<00:02:41.870> you<00:02:41.990> make<00:02:42.650> the<00:02:42.800> tails<00:02:43.100> point<00:02:43.520> down<00:02:43.730> in<00:02:44.000> the

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
and you make the tails point down in the

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.200 
and you make the tails point down in the
same<00:02:44.420> direction<00:02:44.780> and<00:02:45.560> then<00:02:46.010> you<00:02:46.340> take<00:02:46.970> the

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:47.210 
same direction and then you take the

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:49.540 
same direction and then you take the
loops<00:02:47.420> on<00:02:47.690> the<00:02:47.930> sides<00:02:48.200> and<00:02:48.590> you<00:02:48.800> pull<00:02:49.100> them<00:02:49.310> out

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
loops on the sides and you pull them out

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:54.240 
loops on the sides and you pull them out
so<00:02:50.060> that<00:02:50.690> it<00:02:50.930> looks<00:02:51.170> like<00:02:51.470> a<00:02:51.890> round<00:02:52.280> oh<00:02:52.960> not

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
so that it looks like a round oh not

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.520 
so that it looks like a round oh not
like<00:02:55.250> nothing<00:02:55.880> okay<00:02:56.660> so<00:02:56.720> you<00:02:57.110> twist<00:02:57.380> them

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
like nothing okay so you twist them

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.600 
like nothing okay so you twist them
around<00:02:57.950> so<00:02:58.670> they're<00:02:59.650> junior<00:03:00.650> generally

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
around so they're junior generally

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.810 
around so they're junior generally
generally<00:03:02.390> in<00:03:02.690> a<00:03:02.780> circle<00:03:03.200> and<00:03:03.380> then<00:03:04.100> you<00:03:04.340> kind

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
generally in a circle and then you kind

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:09.040 
generally in a circle and then you kind
of<00:03:05.080> fluff<00:03:06.080> them<00:03:06.290> up<00:03:06.440> I<00:03:06.680> just<00:03:06.920> sort<00:03:07.280> of<00:03:08.050> pulled

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.050 
of fluff them up I just sort of pulled

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:14.260 
of fluff them up I just sort of pulled
them<00:03:09.200> open<00:03:09.700> so<00:03:10.700> that<00:03:10.910> they<00:03:11.060> look<00:03:11.330> big<00:03:11.600> and<00:03:13.270> that

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:14.270 
them open so that they look big and that

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:18.640 
them open so that they look big and that
makes<00:03:14.600> a<00:03:14.959> big<00:03:15.080> difference<00:03:15.970> or<00:03:16.970> something<00:03:17.650> this

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
makes a big difference or something this

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.790 
makes a big difference or something this
guy<00:03:18.890> is<00:03:19.180> he's<00:03:20.180> not<00:03:20.330> my<00:03:20.570> best<00:03:20.750> foe<00:03:21.200> but<00:03:21.530> I<00:03:21.590> mean

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:21.800 
guy is he's not my best foe but I mean

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:22.990 
guy is he's not my best foe but I mean
you<00:03:21.890> get<00:03:22.040> the<00:03:22.160> general<00:03:22.310> drift<00:03:22.520> and<00:03:22.820> then<00:03:22.940> you

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
you get the general drift and then you

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.240 
you get the general drift and then you
have<00:03:23.090> the<00:03:23.209> tails<00:03:23.420> and<00:03:23.660> you<00:03:23.720> can<00:03:23.930> trim<00:03:24.200> them<00:03:24.380> to

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
have the tails and you can trim them to

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.360 
have the tails and you can trim them to
whatever<00:03:25.489> and<00:03:26.480> that's<00:03:26.840> about<00:03:26.989> it<00:03:27.170> so<00:03:27.680> I<00:03:28.040> hope

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
whatever and that's about it so I hope

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.870 
whatever and that's about it so I hope
you<00:03:28.550> guys<00:03:28.670> have<00:03:28.970> enjoyed<00:03:29.000> my<00:03:29.540> very
