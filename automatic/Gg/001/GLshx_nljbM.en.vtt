00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 hello my name is suzanne in this 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.240
 video I want to talk about the maximum 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.820
 relevant now the topic of this topic losing weight 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.010
 how to lose weight after winter 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.679
 since for the winter we are all for some 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.109
 although all understandable reasons only Rainis 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.119
 and by the summer everyone wants to look better for 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.619
 yourself and formed a few rules 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.619
 that help me stick 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:25.019
 the same weight on the same level and 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.760
 I decided to share this right with you 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.800
 since I know that they are one hundred percent 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.410
 work and help each of you if 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.210
 you will just perform maybe i 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.030
 I will talk about what I have already told 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.190
 my previous videos but repeat 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.829
 mother of the doctrine the first rule is not 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.030
 carbohydrates in the afternoon all 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.850
 know very well that excess weight 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.770
 appears due to excess carbohydrates 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.559
 so I'm in the afternoon 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.809
 rule them out i know most people 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.300
 eliminates carbohydrates after six so i 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.760
 would give advice to exclude either in the second 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.640
 half or part after that 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.949
 refers to carbohydrates look to 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.899
 simple fast carbohydrate look in 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.360
 Online information on this topic is very 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.479
 many second rule there is no later than 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.150
 every 4 hours after four hours 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.430
 blood sugar levels go down and 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.710
 after we eat it 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:20.700
 immediately goes where we do not need therefore 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:24.090
 better to eat more often little by little 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.700
 every less than 4 hours, preferably worse 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.400
 every three hours I get 8 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.880
 am 11 2 pm 5 o'clock 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.220
 8 hours the following rule is the most dense 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.350
 food intake should be coming tomorrow 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.020
 everyone absolutely does the opposite and 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.600
 breakfast and like lunch somehow at work a 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.790
 dinner came home and ate fast 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.430
 carbohydrate breakfast should be on 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.189
 nutritious nutrient like you 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.810
 have breakfast and so will pass everywhere 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:53.790
 The following rule is daily cardio 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.850
 each is better done then when sugar is in 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:59.610
 blood lower and lowered us on an empty stomach 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.009
 when you slept woke up we were hungry 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.590
 blood sugar lowered in the morning 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.450
 better to do cardio exercises either 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.450
 you play sports you make your 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.310
 standard example 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.860
 which after this workout is best done 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.110
 every exercise after workout sugar 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.000
 blood is always lowered the fifth rule to drink 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.610
 at least 2 liters of water per day 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.709
 In general, the calculation is 0 30 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.530
 milliliters per kilogram of weight 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:25.150
 man for example I weigh 50 kilograms 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.580
 I need at least half a liter of water 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.410
 water accelerates all metabolic processes in 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.230
 the body speeds up metabolism 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.709
 the next item is a massage self massage 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.239
 wrapping all kinds of base ports of cream 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:39.280
 anti-cellulite remedies say it again 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:41.230
 that this will in no way remove your 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.099
 cellulite will not remove your excess 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.410
 kilos 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:46.959
 this will help your skin become toned 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.610
 smooth and elastic more beautiful it all 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:50.620
 works absolutely one hundred percent 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.049
 works but it works in conjunction with 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.030
 nutrition and sports massage can be done 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:57.040
 like vacuum cans this is one of the most 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.620
 effective ways against cellulite and 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.019
 skin tightening and using brushes 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.540
 different wrap and 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:07.720
 let's say cellulite shorts either 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.500
 anti-cellulite me and there is a belt and what else 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.810
 something like that 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.310
 all these tools definitely help but 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.049
 they remove excess fluid from the body 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.790
 who stagnated there 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:18.160
 that is, also get rid of fat 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.319
 absolutely it will not help you yet 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.049
 remember that the body should be mode 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:24.639
 the human body is designed so that 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:27.760
 if he doesn't have a regime then for him 

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:29.739
 any new is stressful time set 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.810
 your body at least approximate 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:34.239
 mode he will be for you definitely 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.940
 thankful not yet possessed advice that not 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:38.799
 it's worth limiting yourself in everything if 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.690
 suddenly you want something very much 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:42.310
 eat it in the morning nothing 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:45.880
 terrible will not just eat and 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:48.190
 a little need to limit their desire 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.349
 in quantity you can give in a little 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.239
 temptations somehow but you need to eat this with 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:53.680
 am and for a little bit forget 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:55.810

 like which you are comfortable also 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:01.599
 I want to note that everyone is afraid of protein 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:03.970
 cocktails but do not be afraid because 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:05.980
 that they help you get that protein 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.959
 which we simply because of the usual food 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.030
 which we do not always receive 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:11.950
 find protein shakes and have some 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.669
 functional food that you will 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.799
 comfortable 

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:15.930

 we always have these cocktails too 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:25.020
 you need to completely yourself in everything and limit 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:27.030
 and do not eat anything, remember that a protein 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.310
 carbohydrate fats required 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.560
 in certain norms must come 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.970
