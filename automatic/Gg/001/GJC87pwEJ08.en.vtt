 In tell you whether I pony inserted in this side 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.770

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:37.260
 Yes target 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:40.730
 You can stop this exploration 360 degrees wherever you like 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.730
 Remove this again 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.150
 From the other side 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:54.750
 You can also attach 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:58.830
 This is followed by mounting the camera at your choice Now using your camcorder for shooting 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:03.940
 I will try to attach a small digital one eye first of all 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:08.740
 Release the lever to make quick shoe easy 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:12.850
 Remove the screw of the plugger is like this Turning this up and turning 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:16.890
 You do not need to prepare a coin 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.890
 Attached to the camera 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:25.159
 Now it's ok to slide it from the side 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:33.829
 Yes you can fix it 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:36.470
 There are 2 stoppers here and they can be operated independently 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:38.830
 Loosen the inside 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.830
 Bread 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:46.050
 And 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.470
 Loosen the outside 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.470
 Silt 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.870
 If both loose 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.400
 Freely 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:03:02.010
 Can move 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:08.519
 The feature of this problem was that this two stoppers were on the same axis . 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:09.840
 When you move the left hand area, you may have less range. 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:14.609
 Around here 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:17.870
 I think there are many things that there is a stopper and there is a stopper around here 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:17.870
 Will try to shoot 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:46.810
 How is it? You can not take a stable picture that you can not take with your hand 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 Is not it 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:52.780
 I think that I can recommend it to those who want to take a video with a video camera or a small digital single eye 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.350
 I will 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:58.350
