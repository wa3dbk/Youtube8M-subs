00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:25.110
 moment giving module 1 that is ours now 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.660
 we go with our second Saturday and in 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:31.020
 this moment my students are doing 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.420

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.430

 men as in women but I already have 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.129
 almost two when importing this module 1 to 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.620
 module 4 is surprising sometimes 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.809
 find in young people who have the 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.900
 ease for drawing and others that 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.089
 they have wings and one realizes not clear 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:53.070
 often also it depends on many 

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:55.350
 of the attitude that the student has either 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.360
 of learning to work not in spite of 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.370
 have official knowledge for 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.830
 the drawing also depends a lot on how 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.869
