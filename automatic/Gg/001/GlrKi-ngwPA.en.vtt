00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.040
 hello friends and welcome to this 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.599
 new video of the best 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.150
 Cyclosportive in which plays sharing 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.460
 is the result of some of my 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.440
 research or things that I have 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.970
 learned by participating in symposia 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.460
 summits on the training the 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.800
 biology nutrition and others and 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.750
 today I would like to share with you 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:29.160
 of a study that researchers are doing 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:32.099
 British on and well the intensity of 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:35.160
 the training of the implication when one 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.809
 is beginner compared to when one is 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.010
 much more experienced so these 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.870
 British researchers put forward 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.420
 that it's good when you're over 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.870
 experienced whether in sports 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:49.800
 quite intensive and techniques like the 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.180
 surfing archery or others I 'm 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.809
 remember more of course as in the 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.510
 endurance sports 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.949
 we realize that when we are 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.390
 beginner 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.210
 well we put a lot more intensity 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.250
 and apply in his sport then 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.090
 only after a while when we are 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.340
 experienced and well we have but we have less 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.810
 need to put implication in his 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.560
 sport and so we progress a lot 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.439
 less good 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.830
 so all that to tell you in this 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:19.290
 video quite simple that to progress 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.460
 always move well it is 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.049
 important to bring novelty 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.220
 in your training in 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.380
 new training methods 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.759
 how to train to launch 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.030
 regularly small challenges 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:32.460
 timed to be in phase of 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.979
 search for improvement is therefore 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.659
 it's really the only one to join 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.340
 perfectly the state of mind of the future 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.259
 cyclosportive is the reason to be a 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.430
 little bit of this blog is always 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:46.409
 you bring exercise models of 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.960
 different training methods for 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.650
 innovate innovate innovate and be constant 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.030
 learning the old 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.860
 the old ones as they say in the 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.530
 cycling that always trains the same 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.490
 method always the same way 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.050
 meets only in their 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.580
 training and do that very often 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.050
 yes he still trains the same 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.910
 way 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.800
 from year to year progress is 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:08.420
 more and more weak and same time 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.740
 ends up falling we say well yes but that 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.420
 it's the cause of age it's a 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.160
 bullshit we can perfectly continue 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.620
 to progress but by bringing some 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.880
 novelty and changes in its 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.300
 workouts when I offer you 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.890
 of course it's to continue as 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.910
 usually every week to you 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.200
 bring new methods 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.200
 training of new exercises 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.890
 but just below share with them 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.600
 other members of the best 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.070
 cyclosportive of a method 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.510
 workout that you like to do well 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.760
 you but it will always be 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.040
 innovation for another member of the 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.630
 half hour cyclosportive so here we go 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.610
 just below I propose you 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.890
 to use the blog as a network of 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.209
 community sharing so what is 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.160
 your best workout trick 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:48.760
 that you like to do yourself and who you 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.760
