00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.250
 [Music] 

00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:07.379
 then you want to buy a tennis 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.030
 Street race 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.700
 So we here on the street give 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.139
 five very important tips for you 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.599
 so stay tuned 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.660
 tip number 1 forget the tread test 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.859
 that's right if you forget it's very common 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.330
 see that the first thing you have 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.400
 to do when you want to buy a 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.850
 having to run after that step is very 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.980
 common 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.410
 Just be careful if you want to start 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.269
 Running you do not really run, huh? 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.390
 So what's the point of doing a 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.160
 your muscle is not 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.239
 you have not developed standard 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.579
 running 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.649
 you do not know to run right actually 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.390
 and besides there are so many tests of 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.309
 stepped around with so many methodologies 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.530
 different if you make five 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.510
 treadmill tests in places where 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.980
 different you can have five 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.980
 different practical results 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:01:06.560
 This is number one. It was there and I'm going to do it. 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:11.400
 anyway and I do and went and did 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:12.990
 So you're not going to say anything then I'll go 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.630
 buying time for the prosecutor is 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.759
 to correct this training leaves already well 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.350
 understood that punishment is a movement 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.000
 of our foot 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.229
 so it's really not meant to be 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.720
 studies have been corrected since they show that 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.430
 even with tennis, proposing an action for 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.380
 correct the information if the foot continues to 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.280
 make a training movement within the 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.079
 sneakers 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.759
 so the best thing you have to do is 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.619
 to do is the greater understanding that 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:41.070
 exists today that you should buy a 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:43.890
 Neutral footnote text number 3 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.970
 good tennis is that he has to get good at 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.130
 your foot 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.770
 so it is not limited only those 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.200
 Friend suggestions I 'm from the coach 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.840
 to have a good time that model x1 of 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.149
 Vilson actually has everything. 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.549
 How much does she have all the 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:02.520
 brands of running shoes have themes 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:05.579
 several with cushioning amount of 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.799
 cushioning or no difference 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:10.560
 from heel to front 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.150
 foot shapes completely 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.950
 different then your foot is not 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.530
 exactly what I ask is a friend 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.400
 This sense of comfort is something 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.950
 individual 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.680
 so if you go to the store look I want 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.150
 see the neutral sneakers of all brands 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.500
 So I want to see which one looks better on 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.690
 my foot is the best thing you can 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:32.130
 make you your foot too 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:34.230
 Tip number 4 the running shoe he has 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:37.620
 that getting a little loose on your foot does not 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:40.650
 the one who 's left behind 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.000
 sambando on your foot know that it is that when 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:50.700
 when we run to our country 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:52.739
 expands space to expand size 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:56.430
 of the store that has a limit to this 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:57.690
 roger but if he does not have space what 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.150
 will happen if I buy a text 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.680
 tight your dad will expand 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.630
 he will lean against the front of the 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.620
 tennis and that everything will happen to lose 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.269
 william 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.370
 you will lose your fingers will stay 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:11.310
 sore and it's horrible that feeling 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.980
 so you have to have a one rule 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.780
 basic rule of thumb your sneakers 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.670
 when you put it on the floor put 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:21.000
 On the foot I stood, he had to 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:23.280
 finger to dollar rule on the 10 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.109
 this is also easily solved with 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.609
 you sometimes putting up buying a 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:32.519
 bigger number 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:35.430
 if you wear glasses at 40 with 41 to 36 o 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:37.560
 casual with 37 is us all brands 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.180
 they have shape differences so you have 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.430
 put text puts is not 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:45.900
 Leftover perfect 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.639
 the last number 5 expensive shoes not always 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.750
 the best 

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:51.180
 let's make an analogy with other 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.639
 things to a very expensive refrigerator, right? 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.340
 The most expensive ice cream there is in the 

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:58.139
 store is that giant fits five people 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.989
 inside it has a huge freezer of 

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:03.599
 computer these internet control of 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:06.060
 controls or the temperature of the 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:08.220
 work leaves already let cold beer 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:11.370
 for you before you get home the 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.959
 expensive car that has 400 horses and 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.239

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:17.430
 Is there, I park the car alone to 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:19.829
 You, but this does not apply to sneakers. 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.479
 the top tennis player the top brand of 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:22.770

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.729
 so you 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.110
 do not go head like that look I'm going 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:32.660
 there I will buy what is more expensive because 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:35.160
 it's more expensive it should be better not 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:36.840
 try the sneakers and see which one 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.849
 better for you sometimes you can 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.710
 Surprising that Sotheby's is cheaper 

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:43.410
 You better stay on my feet.
