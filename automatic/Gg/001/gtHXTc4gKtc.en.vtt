00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:15.219 
I don't really have any other processes

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:17.490 
I don't really have any other processes
running<00:00:15.400> just<00:00:16.360> my<00:00:16.480> recording<00:00:16.840> software<00:00:17.260> and

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:17.500 
running just my recording software and

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.780 
running just my recording software and
some<00:00:18.070> other<00:00:18.220> like<00:00:18.460> chrome<00:00:19.030> but<00:00:19.720> just<00:00:19.900> how<00:00:20.020> it

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:20.790 
some other like chrome but just how it

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.210 
some other like chrome but just how it
faster<00:00:21.790> goes<00:00:21.970> on<00:00:22.480> single-player<00:00:23.170> so<00:00:23.860> yeah

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:24.220 
faster goes on single-player so yeah

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:30.650 
faster goes on single-player so yeah
this<00:00:24.460> is<00:00:24.520> creating<00:00:25.000> world

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.720 

so<00:00:31.230> we'll<00:00:31.349> see<00:00:31.529> how<00:00:31.589> fast<00:00:31.830> it<00:00:32.009> is<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:32.340> I'll

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
so we'll see how fast it is and I'll

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:33.950 
so we'll see how fast it is and I'll
make<00:00:32.910> sure<00:00:33.030> all<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.270> settings<00:00:33.570> aren't<00:00:33.750> high

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
make sure all the settings aren't high

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.540 
make sure all the settings aren't high
too

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.340 

right<00:00:39.150> so<00:00:39.330> you<00:00:39.450> go<00:00:39.600> into<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:39.930> world<00:00:40.140> pretty

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
right so you go into the world pretty

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.080 
right so you go into the world pretty
quickly<00:00:41.450> considering<00:00:42.450> it<00:00:42.540> just<00:00:42.720> created<00:00:43.020> it

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.090 
quickly considering it just created it

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.550 
quickly considering it just created it
let's<00:00:45.090> see<00:00:45.270> what<00:00:45.300> what<00:00:45.630> we<00:00:45.750> can<00:00:45.900> do<00:00:46.050> here<00:00:46.260> let's

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:46.560 
let's see what what we can do here let's

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:54.729 
let's see what what we can do here let's
go<00:00:46.740> ahead<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.310> test

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:58.470 

all<00:00:55.250> right<00:00:55.370> and<00:00:56.000> so<00:00:56.180> you<00:00:56.270> test<00:00:56.750> this

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:58.480 
all right and so you test this

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.270 
all right and so you test this
I<00:00:58.570> think<00:00:59.260> my<00:00:59.380> graphics<00:00:59.739> aren't<00:00:59.890> far<00:01:00.040> let<00:01:00.220> me

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
I think my graphics aren't far let me

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.250 
I think my graphics aren't far let me
just<00:01:00.430> make<00:01:00.550> sure

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.420 

let's<00:01:05.260> get<00:01:05.560> this<00:01:06.930> all<00:01:07.930> right<00:01:08.130> let's<00:01:09.130> make<00:01:09.400> sure

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
let's get this all right let's make sure

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.400 
let's get this all right let's make sure
my<00:01:09.700> graphic<00:01:10.090> settings<00:01:10.270> are<00:01:10.630> the<00:01:10.960> best<00:01:11.200> they

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:11.410 
my graphic settings are the best they

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:16.710 
my graphic settings are the best they
can<00:01:11.470> be<00:01:12.000> far<00:01:13.020> graphics<00:01:14.020> fancy<00:01:15.180> particles<00:01:16.180> and

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 
can be far graphics fancy particles and

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.140 
can be far graphics fancy particles and
yeah<00:01:17.350> it<00:01:17.440> looks<00:01:17.590> like<00:01:17.710> everything<00:01:18.160> goes<00:01:18.340> on

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:19.150 
yeah it looks like everything goes on

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:24.360 
yeah it looks like everything goes on
the<00:01:19.540> correct<00:01:19.870> settings<00:01:20.260> and<00:01:21.120> let's<00:01:22.120> see<00:01:23.370> let's

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:24.370 
the correct settings and let's see let's

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:25.830 
the correct settings and let's see let's
start<00:01:24.610> off<00:01:24.700> with<00:01:24.880> of<00:01:25.030> course<00:01:25.240> the<00:01:25.360> TFT

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
start off with of course the TFT

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:50.880 
start off with of course the TFT
explosion<00:01:26.290> see<00:01:26.500> how<00:01:27.310> much<00:01:27.490> tt<00:01:27.880> can<00:01:28.119> take

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:02:01.170 

I<00:01:50.920> think<00:01:51.700> that's<00:01:51.820> get<00:01:51.969> them<00:01:52.060> out<00:01:52.180> for<00:01:52.509> now<00:01:52.600> he's

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.030 

doesn't<00:02:02.180> that<00:02:02.270> bad<00:02:02.480> just<00:02:02.660> some<00:02:02.960> chunk<00:02:03.860> loading

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
doesn't that bad just some chunk loading

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.070 
doesn't that bad just some chunk loading
errors<00:02:04.430> but<00:02:04.670> didn't<00:02:05.300> like<00:02:05.390> out<00:02:05.600> or<00:02:05.720> anything

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
errors but didn't like out or anything

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:11.790 
errors but didn't like out or anything
let's<00:02:06.620> try<00:02:06.770> it<00:02:06.830> one<00:02:06.920> more<00:02:06.950> time

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.560 

see<00:02:12.400> I'm<00:02:12.520> really<00:02:12.670> doing<00:02:12.910> this<00:02:13.120> because<00:02:13.300> it

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
see I'm really doing this because it

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:15.690 
see I'm really doing this because it
really<00:02:13.600> aren't<00:02:13.900> many<00:02:14.050> women<00:02:14.860> over<00:02:14.920> Y<00:02:15.190> 500

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
really aren't many women over Y 500

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.260 
really aren't many women over Y 500
reviews<00:02:16.210> on<00:02:16.480> YouTube<00:02:16.690> that<00:02:17.680> are<00:02:17.910> in<00:02:18.910> English

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
reviews on YouTube that are in English

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:24.330 
reviews on YouTube that are in English
essentially<00:02:20.340> so<00:02:21.340> yeah<00:02:23.010> hopefully<00:02:24.010> this<00:02:24.280> will

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
essentially so yeah hopefully this will

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:25.950 
essentially so yeah hopefully this will
be<00:02:24.460> helpful<00:02:24.700> to<00:02:24.790> the<00:02:24.880> I<00:02:24.910> severe<00:02:25.540> theme<00:02:25.750> of

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960 
be helpful to the I severe theme of

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:40.360 
be helpful to the I severe theme of
buying<00:02:26.200> the<00:02:26.440> product

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.059 

you<00:02:41.060> know<00:02:41.120> as<00:02:41.299> far<00:02:41.450> as<00:02:41.510> T&amp;T<00:02:41.900> goes<00:02:42.170> I<00:02:42.349> think<00:02:42.560> they

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:43.069 
you know as far as T&amp;T goes I think they

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:44.440 
you know as far as T&amp;T goes I think they
can<00:02:43.220> pretty<00:02:43.580> much<00:02:43.670> handle<00:02:43.970> it

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
can pretty much handle it

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.289 
can pretty much handle it
let's<00:02:45.349> see<00:02:45.470> what<00:02:45.590> else<00:02:45.739> lets<00:02:46.730> him<00:02:46.909> any<00:02:47.030> mobs

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:47.299 
let's see what else lets him any mobs

00:02:47.299 --> 00:03:09.350 
let's see what else lets him any mobs
they<00:02:47.510> can<00:02:47.629> handle

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.110 

seems<00:03:10.360> to<00:03:10.540> be<00:03:10.570> doing<00:03:10.690> pretty<00:03:10.990> well<00:03:11.290> and<00:03:12.130> handle

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
seems to be doing pretty well and handle

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.050 
seems to be doing pretty well and handle
this<00:03:13.270> my<00:03:13.480> pops<00:03:14.520> concerning<00:03:15.520> I<00:03:15.670> think<00:03:15.940> they're

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
this my pops concerning I think they're

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:31.110

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
see we'll see what the limit is I mean

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.630 
see we'll see what the limit is I mean
that<00:03:48.459> is<00:03:48.640> a<00:03:49.180> lot<00:03:49.300> of<00:03:50.200> pigs<00:03:50.470> and<00:03:51.130> it's<00:03:51.459> not

oh<00:04:13.750> it's<00:04:14.750> liking<00:04:15.080> out<00:04:15.170> a<00:04:15.200> little<00:04:15.379> bit

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:39.289 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:42.979 

yeah<00:04:40.289> so<00:04:40.529> I<00:04:40.559> think<00:04:40.799> it's<00:04:40.919> pretty<00:04:41.099> good<00:04:41.849> oops<00:04:42.629> I

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:42.989 
yeah so I think it's pretty good oops I

00:04:42.989 --> 00:04:45.919 
yeah so I think it's pretty good oops I
can<00:04:43.139> out<00:04:43.259> like<00:04:43.739> that<00:04:43.889> a<00:04:43.919> little<00:04:44.159> bit<00:04:44.249> but<00:04:44.929> again

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:45.929 
can out like that a little bit but again

00:04:45.929 --> 00:04:47.600 
can out like that a little bit but again
this<00:04:46.169> is<00:04:46.289> on<00:04:46.409> single-player<00:04:46.889> so<00:04:47.129> there

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
this is on single-player so there

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:48.679 
this is on single-player so there
obviously<00:04:47.699> would<00:04:48.029> be<00:04:48.059> a<00:04:48.209> little<00:04:48.419> discrepancy

00:04:48.679 --> 00:04:48.689 
obviously would be a little discrepancy

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:49.759 
obviously would be a little discrepancy
if<00:04:49.019> you're<00:04:49.139> going<00:04:49.289> to<00:04:49.349> be<00:04:49.409> playing<00:04:49.589> on

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:49.769 
if you're going to be playing on

00:04:49.769 --> 00:04:51.649 
if you're going to be playing on
multiplayer<00:04:50.039> a<00:04:50.189> lot<00:04:50.399> which<00:04:50.639> you<00:04:51.509> probably

00:04:51.649 --> 00:04:51.659 
multiplayer a lot which you probably

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:54.649 
multiplayer a lot which you probably
will<00:04:51.929> be<00:04:52.129> but<00:04:53.129> if<00:04:53.699> it<00:04:53.939> can<00:04:54.059> handle<00:04:54.239> this<00:04:54.449> many

00:04:54.649 --> 00:04:54.659 
will be but if it can handle this many

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:59.149 
will be but if it can handle this many
pigs<00:04:54.959> and<00:04:56.809> biking<00:04:57.809> t-box<00:04:58.139> with<00:04:58.379> minimal<00:04:58.979> lag

00:04:59.149 --> 00:04:59.159 
pigs and biking t-box with minimal lag

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:01.009 
pigs and biking t-box with minimal lag
like<00:04:59.519> this<00:04:59.729> is<00:04:59.909> as<00:05:00.179> bad<00:05:00.449> as<00:05:00.569> it's<00:05:00.659> gonna<00:05:00.749> get<00:05:00.959> I

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:01.019 
like this is as bad as it's gonna get I

00:05:01.019 --> 00:05:03.019 
like this is as bad as it's gonna get I
think<00:05:01.319> and<00:05:01.679> that's<00:05:02.399> just<00:05:02.549> because<00:05:02.669> I<00:05:02.819> have<00:05:02.999> a

00:05:03.019 --> 00:05:03.029 
think and that's just because I have a

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:07.279 
think and that's just because I have a
lot<00:05:03.419> of<00:05:03.649> pigs<00:05:04.759> going<00:05:05.759> on<00:05:05.999> here<00:05:06.299> with<00:05:06.629> Cindy

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:07.289 
lot of pigs going on here with Cindy

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:09.709 
lot of pigs going on here with Cindy
explosions<00:05:07.909> so<00:05:08.909> I<00:05:08.939> think<00:05:09.059> it<00:05:09.329> should<00:05:09.360> be

00:05:09.709 --> 00:05:09.719 
explosions so I think it should be

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:12.859 
explosions so I think it should be
pretty<00:05:10.110> fine<00:05:10.909> they<00:05:11.909> should<00:05:12.149> not<00:05:12.360> really<00:05:12.599> any

00:05:12.859 --> 00:05:12.869 
pretty fine they should not really any

00:05:12.869 --> 00:05:16.519 
pretty fine they should not really any
young<00:05:13.969> glitch<00:05:14.969> like<00:05:15.329> dead<00:05:15.749> pig<00:05:15.959> bodies<00:05:16.349> or

00:05:16.519 --> 00:05:16.529 
young glitch like dead pig bodies or

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:19.369 
young glitch like dead pig bodies or
anything<00:05:16.679> like<00:05:16.860> that<00:05:16.919> due<00:05:17.279> to<00:05:17.309> lag<00:05:17.719> and<00:05:18.719> the

00:05:19.369 --> 00:05:19.379 
anything like that due to lag and the

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:20.869 
anything like that due to lag and the
crater<00:05:19.709> from<00:05:19.799> the<00:05:19.919> TNT<00:05:20.129> conclusion<00:05:20.699> doesn't

00:05:20.869 --> 00:05:20.879 
crater from the TNT conclusion doesn't

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:23.149 
crater from the TNT conclusion doesn't
seem<00:05:21.149> to<00:05:21.329> log<00:05:21.509> out<00:05:21.659> with<00:05:21.839> you<00:05:21.929> that<00:05:22.079> traitor<00:05:22.349> so

00:05:23.149 --> 00:05:23.159 
seem to log out with you that traitor so

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:24.859 
seem to log out with you that traitor so
I<00:05:23.189> think<00:05:23.309> I<00:05:23.610> think<00:05:23.819> this<00:05:23.879> behavior<00:05:24.269> can<00:05:24.569> handle

00:05:24.859 --> 00:05:24.869 
I think I think this behavior can handle

00:05:24.869 --> 00:05:27.619 
I think I think this behavior can handle
Minecraft<00:05:25.259> for<00:05:25.529> sure<00:05:25.679> really<00:05:26.099> well<00:05:26.339> so<00:05:27.149> yeah<00:05:27.419> I

00:05:27.619 --> 00:05:27.629 
Minecraft for sure really well so yeah I

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:29.869 
Minecraft for sure really well so yeah I
