00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
there's a very sharp cut line to a gloss

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.170 
there's a very sharp cut line to a gloss
back<00:01:19.080> so<00:01:19.530> it<00:01:19.650> looks<00:01:19.979> beautiful<00:01:20.610> as<00:01:20.729> well<00:01:20.939> when

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
back so it looks beautiful as well when

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.780 
back so it looks beautiful as well when
you're<00:01:21.299> actually<00:01:21.390> holding<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:21.990> device<00:01:22.790> but

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
you're actually holding the device but

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.060 
you're actually holding the device but
that<00:01:23.939> design<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:24.840> functionality<00:01:25.259> comes<00:01:25.799> in

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
that design and functionality comes in

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.070 
that design and functionality comes in
in<00:01:26.369> a<00:01:26.490> complete<00:01:26.970> package<00:01:27.390> when<00:01:27.750> you<00:01:27.840> think

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
in a complete package when you think

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.749 
in a complete package when you think
about<00:01:28.140> for<00:01:28.530> example<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:29.009> camera<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.520> device

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
about for example the camera the device

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.910 
about for example the camera the device
there's<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.360> 13-megapixel<00:01:31.200> rear-facing

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
there's a 13-megapixel rear-facing

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.149 
there's a 13-megapixel rear-facing
camera<00:01:32.700> but<00:01:33.180> it<00:01:33.299> also<00:01:33.509> a<00:01:34.159> 5-megapixel

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
camera but it also a 5-megapixel

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.929 
camera but it also a 5-megapixel
front-facing<00:01:35.460> camera<00:01:36.000> so<00:01:36.119> incredibly<00:01:36.930> large

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:37.939 
front-facing camera so incredibly large

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:40.120 
front-facing camera so incredibly large
megapixel<00:01:38.939> count<00:01:39.090> on<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.329> front<00:01:39.540> face

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
megapixel count on a front face

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.910 
megapixel count on a front face
but<00:01:40.729> it's<00:01:40.909> also<00:01:41.240> got<00:01:41.840> a<00:01:42.289> really<00:01:42.590> great

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
but it's also got a really great

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.770 
but it's also got a really great
experience<00:01:43.280> as<00:01:43.729> well<00:01:43.789> that<00:01:44.240> functionality

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
experience as well that functionality

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.990 
experience as well that functionality
coming<00:01:45.409> in<00:01:45.500> the<00:01:45.590> design<00:01:45.979> so<00:01:46.490> there's<00:01:46.670> a<00:01:46.729> great

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
coming in the design so there's a great

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.240 
coming in the design so there's a great
functionality<00:01:47.840> of<00:01:48.079> a<00:01:48.259> 5<00:01:48.470> megapixel<00:01:48.619> camera

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
functionality of a 5 megapixel camera

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.029 
functionality of a 5 megapixel camera
but<00:01:49.399> we<00:01:49.490> have<00:01:49.700> a<00:01:49.729> sense<00:01:50.539> to<00:01:50.869> eat<00:01:50.960> for<00:01:51.619> example

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:52.039 
but we have a sense to eat for example

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:53.410 
but we have a sense to eat for example
when<00:01:52.159> you're<00:01:52.280> taking<00:01:52.549> us<00:01:52.610> out<00:01:52.700> just<00:01:53.240> touching

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
when you're taking us out just touching
