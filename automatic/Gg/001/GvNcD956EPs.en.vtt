some more articulation space and then we

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.980 
some more articulation space and then we
just<00:03:12.110> get<00:03:12.620> everything<00:03:12.980> in<00:03:13.520> order<00:03:13.850> fold<00:03:14.810> those

any<00:04:42.590> of<00:04:42.680> the<00:04:42.770> weapons<00:04:42.920> from<00:04:43.190> the<00:04:43.340> human

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580 
any of the weapons from the human

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.700 
any of the weapons from the human
alliance<00:04:43.790> can<00:04:44.120> just<00:04:44.300> peg<00:04:44.510> right<00:04:44.690> in<00:04:44.900> that's<00:04:45.530> a

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710 
alliance can just peg right in that's a

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:46.570 
alliance can just peg right in that's a
very<00:04:45.890> nice<00:04:46.070> touch

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
very nice touch

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.150 
very nice touch
I<00:04:46.610> really<00:04:47.600> like<00:04:47.750> the<00:04:47.930> missile<00:04:48.290> rack<00:04:48.530> on<00:04:48.860> his

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.160 
I really like the missile rack on his

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.040 
I really like the missile rack on his
back<00:04:49.370> I<00:04:49.700> think<00:04:50.000> that's<00:04:50.180> a<00:04:50.330> nice<00:04:50.450> touch

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.050 
back I think that's a nice touch

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:55.540

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:55.550 
my only I have two nagging problems one

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:57.820 
my only I have two nagging problems one
the<00:04:56.210> figure<00:04:56.480> is<00:04:56.630> top-heavy<00:04:57.020> actually<00:04:57.740> the

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
the figure is top-heavy actually the

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.950 
the figure is top-heavy actually the
three-nine<00:04:58.190> a<00:04:58.220> problem<00:04:58.670> sorry<00:04:58.940> the<00:04:59.390> figure<00:04:59.690> is

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
three-nine a problem sorry the figure is

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.930 
three-nine a problem sorry the figure is
top-heavy<00:05:00.500> there's<00:05:00.920> nothing<00:05:01.370> I<00:05:01.490> can<00:05:01.640> do<00:05:01.730> about

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:01.940 
top-heavy there's nothing I can do about

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.520 
top-heavy there's nothing I can do about
that<00:05:02.000> I<00:05:02.420> mean<00:05:02.600> you've<00:05:02.720> got<00:05:02.870> all<00:05:02.900> this<00:05:03.200> stuff

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:03.530 
that I mean you've got all this stuff

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:06.520 
that I mean you've got all this stuff
here<00:05:03.980> it's<00:05:04.580> just<00:05:04.910> top-heavy<00:05:05.270> the<00:05:05.960> other<00:05:06.080> issue

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:06.530 
here it's just top-heavy the other issue

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:10.630 
here it's just top-heavy the other issue
I<00:05:06.710> have<00:05:07.070> is<00:05:07.400> that<00:05:08.000> there<00:05:08.600> is<00:05:08.750> a<00:05:08.780> peg<00:05:09.640> right

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:10.640 
I have is that there is a peg right

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:12.790 
I have is that there is a peg right
there<00:05:10.940> it's<00:05:11.180> clear<00:05:11.540> blue<00:05:11.780> peg<00:05:12.050> not<00:05:12.380> sure<00:05:12.590> well

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.800 
there it's clear blue peg not sure well

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.560 
there it's clear blue peg not sure well
you<00:05:12.830> can<00:05:13.100> see<00:05:13.280> it<00:05:13.370> it's<00:05:13.520> a<00:05:13.610> very<00:05:13.760> small<00:05:14.210> peg

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:14.570 
you can see it it's a very small peg

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:17.440 
you can see it it's a very small peg
it's<00:05:15.350> a<00:05:15.410> very<00:05:15.590> loose<00:05:16.010> peg<00:05:16.400> because<00:05:16.640> this<00:05:17.210> whole

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:17.450 
it's a very loose peg because this whole

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:21.370 
it's a very loose peg because this whole
section<00:05:17.930> comes<00:05:18.170> off<00:05:18.350> really<00:05:18.770> easily<00:05:20.050> that<00:05:21.050> um

section comes off really easily that um

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:24.790 
section comes off really easily that um
that's<00:05:22.310> just<00:05:22.670> an<00:05:23.300> engineering<00:05:23.720> issue<00:05:23.960> the

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 
that's just an engineering issue the

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.330 
that's just an engineering issue the
other<00:05:24.950> issue<00:05:25.220> I<00:05:25.370> have<00:05:25.610> with<00:05:25.640> the<00:05:25.850> figure<00:05:26.120> is<00:05:26.390> I

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:27.340 
other issue I have with the figure is I

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:29.980 
other issue I have with the figure is I
really<00:05:28.340> really<00:05:29.030> want<00:05:29.240> some<00:05:29.450> better<00:05:29.660> paint

some more silver throughout the rest of
the<00:05:37.130> figure<00:05:37.340> maybe<00:05:38.060> on<00:05:38.330> the<00:05:38.450> arms<00:05:38.900> or<00:05:39.080> the<00:05:39.140> legs

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:39.200 
the figure maybe on the arms or the legs

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.250 
the figure maybe on the arms or the legs
or<00:05:39.710> even<00:05:39.740> this<00:05:40.160> weird<00:05:40.550> fan<00:05:41.120> thing<00:05:41.720> he's<00:05:41.960> got<00:05:42.170> in

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:47.020 
his chest that would have been awesome
so<00:05:44.330> I<00:05:44.630> might<00:05:45.140> actually<00:05:45.410> paint<00:05:46.040> that<00:05:46.310> myself<00:05:46.550> I

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:47.030 
so I might actually paint that myself I

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:49.090 
so I might actually paint that myself I
mean<00:05:47.120> there's<00:05:47.360> there's<00:05:48.170> a<00:05:48.260> lot<00:05:48.530> of<00:05:48.680> stuff<00:05:48.890> here

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:49.100 
mean there's there's a lot of stuff here

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:50.980 
mean there's there's a lot of stuff here
that<00:05:49.340> really<00:05:49.850> could<00:05:50.150> do<00:05:50.300> with<00:05:50.480> some<00:05:50.660> painting

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:50.990 
that really could do with some painting

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:52.330 
that really could do with some painting
I<00:05:51.020> mean<00:05:51.140> you<00:05:51.230> could<00:05:51.380> get<00:05:51.500> some<00:05:51.740> really<00:05:51.980> neat

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:52.340

I mean you could get some really neat
effects<00:05:52.820> here<00:05:53.060> on<00:05:53.180> the<00:05:53.300> legs<00:05:53.510> you<00:05:54.140> have<00:05:54.260> some

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:54.470 
effects here on the legs you have some

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:56.740 
effects here on the legs you have some
black<00:05:54.740> for<00:05:55.220> these<00:05:55.490> cross<00:05:55.940> hatches<00:05:56.510> and<00:05:56.660> then

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:56.750 
black for these cross hatches and then

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:58.210 
black for these cross hatches and then
silver<00:05:57.230> on<00:05:57.320> the<00:05:57.470> inside

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:58.220

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:03.260 
color schemes going I really don't like

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:04.690 
color schemes going I really don't like
the<00:06:03.440> fact<00:06:03.620> that<00:06:03.770> the<00:06:03.920> green<00:06:04.100> white<00:06:04.430> isn't

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:04.700 
the fact that the green white isn't

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:07.390 
the fact that the green white isn't
carried<00:06:05.300> into<00:06:05.540> the<00:06:05.660> robot<00:06:06.020> mode<00:06:06.230> I<00:06:06.560> really

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:07.400 
carried into the robot mode I really

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.270 
carried into the robot mode I really
wish<00:06:07.610> that<00:06:07.640> was<00:06:08.360> carried<00:06:08.780> in<00:06:08.930> but<00:06:09.260> you<00:06:09.890> know<00:06:09.920> I
