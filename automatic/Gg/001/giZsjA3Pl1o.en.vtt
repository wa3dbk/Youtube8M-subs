00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.090 
with the idea to start early coach a 725
start<00:00:43.079> what<00:00:43.350> was<00:00:43.440> actually<00:00:43.590> something<00:00:43.920> for

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
start what was actually something for

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.760 
start what was actually something for
the<00:00:44.309> last<00:00:44.520> couple<00:00:44.730> years<00:00:45.289> that<00:00:46.289> I<00:00:46.320> wanted<00:00:46.620> to

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
the last couple years that I wanted to

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.130 
the last couple years that I wanted to
do<00:00:46.980> but<00:00:47.250> you<00:00:47.879> can't<00:00:48.180> because<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.719> classic<00:00:49.050> of

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
do but you can't because the classic of

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.299 
do but you can't because the classic of
you<00:00:49.410> basically<00:00:49.649> have<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:49.860> do<00:00:49.980> it<00:00:50.039> a<00:00:50.100> year<00:00:50.250> in

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
you basically have to do it a year in

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.889 
you basically have to do it a year in
advance<00:00:50.399> because<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.090> registration<00:00:51.719> will

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
advance because the registration will

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.500 
advance because the registration will
tend<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:52.289> block<00:00:52.559> these<00:00:52.770> hours<00:00:53.160> and<00:00:53.190> so<00:00:53.550> at

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
tend to block these hours and so at

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:55.700 
tend to block these hours and so at
Tennessee<00:00:54.960> I<00:00:54.989> wanted<00:00:55.230> to<00:00:55.289> do<00:00:55.379> it<00:00:55.469> but<00:00:55.530> we

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
Tennessee I wanted to do it but we

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:56.930 
Tennessee I wanted to do it but we
didn't<00:00:55.920> we<00:00:56.160> weren't<00:00:56.340> there<00:00:56.520> for<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:56.730> full<00:00:56.910> year

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
wanted to look at in spring that could

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.730 
wanted to look at in spring that could
be<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.280> possible<00:01:05.760> move<00:01:06.119> for<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.450> fall

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
be a possible move for the fall

something<00:04:31.289> you<00:04:32.070> know<00:04:32.160> we've<00:04:32.460> talked<00:04:32.700> about<00:04:32.940> it

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
something you know we've talked about it

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.640 
something you know we've talked about it
but<00:04:33.180> until<00:04:33.510> we<00:04:33.539> get<00:04:33.690> to<00:04:33.810> that<00:04:33.900> samuel<00:04:34.380> healthy

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
but until we get to that samuel healthy

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.680 
but until we get to that samuel healthy
we<00:04:34.770> have<00:04:34.889> at<00:04:35.010> that<00:04:35.130> point<00:04:35.370> the<00:04:36.240> scary<00:04:36.510> thing<00:04:36.660> is

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
we have at that point the scary thing is

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.870 
we have at that point the scary thing is
this<00:04:37.080> or<00:04:37.320> we're<00:04:37.710> 19<00:04:38.070> short<00:04:38.400> and<00:04:38.610> we<00:04:38.700> just

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
this or we're 19 short and we just

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.730 
this or we're 19 short and we just
started<00:04:39.000> usually<00:04:39.660> you're<00:04:40.229> short<00:04:40.500> at<00:04:40.590> the<00:04:40.620> end

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
started usually you're short at the end

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.650 
started usually you're short at the end
of<00:04:40.919> spring<00:04:41.190> and<00:04:41.310> so<00:04:41.490> hopefully<00:04:42.030> we<00:04:42.330> don't<00:04:42.419> add

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:03.879 
what's the thinking with Tony for that
yeah<00:06:02.419> just<00:06:02.599> looking<00:06:02.900> at<00:06:02.990> how<00:06:03.080> long<00:06:03.320> tony<00:06:03.680> is

00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:03.889 
yeah just looking at how long tony is

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:06.939 
yeah just looking at how long tony is
and<00:06:04.190> how<00:06:04.340> well<00:06:04.550> he<00:06:04.699> tackled<00:06:05.560> you<00:06:06.560> know<00:06:06.650> to<00:06:06.800> put

00:06:06.939 --> 00:06:06.949 
and how well he tackled you know to put

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:08.529 
and how well he tackled you know to put
him<00:06:07.039> out<00:06:07.159> there<00:06:07.190> he's<00:06:07.490> fast<00:06:07.909> enough<00:06:08.180> usually

00:06:08.529 --> 00:06:08.539 
him out there he's fast enough usually

00:06:08.539 --> 00:06:10.300 
him out there he's fast enough usually
the<00:06:08.630> big<00:06:08.810> guys<00:06:08.960> aren't<00:06:09.229> fast<00:06:09.409> enough<00:06:09.530> but<00:06:09.860> he's

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:10.310 
the big guys aren't fast enough but he's

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:12.310 
the big guys aren't fast enough but he's
one<00:06:10.460> of<00:06:10.550> our<00:06:10.639> faster<00:06:11.030> players<00:06:11.240> and<00:06:11.599> we<00:06:12.050> do<00:06:12.169> have

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:12.320 
one of our faster players and we do have

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.230 
one of our faster players and we do have
a<00:06:12.380> number<00:06:12.590> of<00:06:12.710> safety<00:06:13.070> that<00:06:13.099> have<00:06:13.310> played<00:06:13.550> and

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:14.240 
a number of safety that have played and

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.330 
a number of safety that have played and
so<00:06:14.449> on<00:06:14.659> it<00:06:14.870> adds<00:06:15.080> competition<00:06:15.979> out<00:06:16.070> there<00:06:16.099> at

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:16.340 
so on it adds competition out there at

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:17.680 
so on it adds competition out there at
corners<00:06:16.759> position<00:06:17.150> that<00:06:17.270> we<00:06:17.330> don't<00:06:17.479> have<00:06:17.599> a

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:17.690 
corners position that we don't have a

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:19.810 
corners position that we don't have a
lot<00:06:17.840> of<00:06:17.870> numbers<00:06:18.020> out<00:06:18.320> when<00:06:19.280> you<00:06:19.430> were<00:06:19.610> in<00:06:19.789> the

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:19.820 
lot of numbers out when you were in the

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:21.760 
lot of numbers out when you were in the
team<00:06:20.090> period<00:06:20.389> it<00:06:20.479> did<00:06:20.630> seem<00:06:20.810> pretty<00:06:21.080> physical

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:21.770 
team period it did seem pretty physical

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:23.350 
team period it did seem pretty physical
is<00:06:21.889> that<00:06:22.009> a<00:06:22.039> deliberate<00:06:22.550> contrast<00:06:23.030> after

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:23.360 
is that a deliberate contrast after

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.480 
is that a deliberate contrast after
having<00:06:23.630> to<00:06:23.719> do<00:06:23.870> so<00:06:24.050> much<00:06:24.199> the<00:06:24.409> tempo<00:06:24.830> last

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:25.490 
having to do so much the tempo last

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:27.700 
having to do so much the tempo last
