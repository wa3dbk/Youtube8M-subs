00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
string I pretty much played this guitar

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.860 
string I pretty much played this guitar
so<00:02:07.799> much<00:02:08.130> that<00:02:08.700> I've<00:02:09.690> worn<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.679> frets<00:02:10.950> down<00:02:11.870> if

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
so much that I've worn the frets down if

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.050 
so much that I've worn the frets down if
i<00:02:13.020> were<00:02:13.170> to<00:02:13.319> fret<00:02:13.860> a<00:02:13.890> note<00:02:14.190> right<00:02:14.430> now<00:02:14.610> probably

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
probably give me a sharp note which

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.090 
probably give me a sharp note which
would<00:02:17.580> make<00:02:17.730> it<00:02:17.910> rather<00:02:18.120> difficult<00:02:18.450> to<00:02:19.100> play

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100
