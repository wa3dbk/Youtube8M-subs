00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.550 
really irritated and red and pink in
your<00:04:27.550> face<00:04:27.910> with<00:04:28.180> um<00:04:28.420> when<00:04:29.020> you<00:04:29.170> wash<00:04:29.350> your

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560

your face with um when you wash your
face<00:04:29.680> and<00:04:29.830> stuff<00:04:29.980> like<00:04:30.070> that<00:04:30.250> your<00:04:30.460> skin<00:04:30.640> is

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:32.190 
face and stuff like that your skin is
literally<00:04:31.090> like<00:04:31.330> angry<00:04:31.780> and<00:04:31.810> just<00:04:32.080> like

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:32.200 
literally like angry and just like

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.990 
literally like angry and just like
inflamed<00:04:32.650> I<00:04:32.920> find<00:04:33.280> that<00:04:33.400> this<00:04:33.520> moisturizer

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
inflamed I find that this moisturizer

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.520 
inflamed I find that this moisturizer
calms<00:04:34.330> it<00:04:34.450> down<00:04:34.510> more<00:04:34.870> than<00:04:35.050> any<00:04:35.290> other

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
calms it down more than any other

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.320 
calms it down more than any other
moisturizer<00:04:36.070> because<00:04:36.370> of<00:04:36.670> the<00:04:36.760> ingredients

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
moisturizer because of the ingredients

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:38.520 
moisturizer because of the ingredients
because<00:04:37.570> it<00:04:37.690> is<00:04:37.780> moisturizing<00:04:38.140> but<00:04:38.380> also

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
because it is moisturizing but also

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.590 
because it is moisturizing but also
because<00:04:38.860> of<00:04:38.980> the<00:04:39.070> color<00:04:39.100> the<00:04:39.820> yellow<00:04:39.850> kind<00:04:40.450> of

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600 
because of the color the yellow kind of

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.810 
because of the color the yellow kind of
counteracts<00:04:41.200> the<00:04:41.470> red<00:04:41.710> and<00:04:42.040> it<00:04:42.280> really<00:04:42.550> does

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:42.820 
counteracts the red and it really does
