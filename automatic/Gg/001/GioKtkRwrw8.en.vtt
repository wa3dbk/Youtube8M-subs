00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:08.000
 Hi and welcome to another video like 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.420
 do 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:15.450
 we started the draft with loose strokes and 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:19.520
 defined so that you can 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:22.350
 reproducing this exercise is very easy 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:26.640
 just choose an object from your 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.949
 day to day and starting to draw does not 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.300
 worry whether or not it will look like 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.210
 Importance is the training 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.219
 repeat this process several times and the 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.489
 few the drawing becomes part of the 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.489
 your life 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:43.350
 The secret of drawing is to learn to 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.879
 to observe is to learn to see for later 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.879
 forward to paper 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.430
 it is important to remember that every artist 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.510
 plastic begins its formation through 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.250
 drawing 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.070
 drawing is important for any 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.960
 procedure, it is necessary to have 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.510
 knowledge of 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.979
 drawing representation 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.630
 do you know that drawing is a 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:15.040
 representation of an image 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:17.229
 three-dimensional on a flat surface and 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:21.670
 is defined by its formal elements 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:22.990
 basic as volume proportion composition 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.610
 among others 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:28.930
 to have an idea of sculpture and painting 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.210
 architecture and even cinema explores the 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.780
 drawing as a draft for your projects 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.780
 endings 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.369
 there is no secret or formula 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:41.289
 magic to make a drawing of 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:47.200
 observation, simply place the object of your 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:49.570
 side and start drawing for the choice 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.280
 the theme of your drawing, it is important that 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.950
 the choice is something from your daily routine 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:57.960
 to make it easier for you 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.960
 draw something common to you 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.120
 if the first time was not much 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.190
 do not even give up 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.560
 Remember that all people have the 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:25.390
 ability to draw training and 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:27.670
 dedication is already finalized our 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.410
