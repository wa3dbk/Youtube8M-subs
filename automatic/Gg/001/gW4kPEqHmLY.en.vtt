00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.759
 fourth date for the effects 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:15.990
 instagram made with photoshop 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:18.390
 this time I dedicate myself to the mayfair that is 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.810
 also little described if few are found 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.539
 around and I believe that even in Italy 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.269
 there is nothing about window levels 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.519
 fewer windows open as usual 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:33.450
 I always repeat it for those who don't know 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:38.809
 naturally detachment to see better 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.809
 how to move images square as from 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:45.989
 instagram feature then imposed 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:48.430
 20 x 20 but everyone will do what he wants 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.620
 with his own image he will have the 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:53.469
 dimensions that he needs to send to 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:56.649
 confirm or my square image 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:59.979
 I add a layer above color 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:02.649
 black prominent bucket and fill 

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:06.640
 here I go to apply a filter 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:09.909
 we see a bit of trouble here it is 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:13.810
 should be fine 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:17.380
 add noise where we will look for a 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:20.380
 not too marked effect of this by 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:23.860
 shift disturbance with black color of first 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:26.470
 plane and white uniform background 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.270
 checked the distribution e 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.450
 monochrome to avoid all those 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:33.369
 colors that we don't need 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.250
 we confirm and modify the method of 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:40.149
 colorless fusion shields this michelle 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:43.299
 and the two things and will give this effect this way 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:46.329
 stippled a little ruined all the 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:48.700
 effects are tend to remain a 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:53.350
 ruin the images a bit we activate 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:56.500
 background level we check the selection 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.570
 rectangular and describe an area 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.609
 therefore quite central 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:03.100
 we leave a lot of space around 

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:05.560
 this selection fades out and vi 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:09.369
 some difficult tests will have to be done 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:13.900
 understand how blurred it will be 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:16.030
 from the menu selection change fades 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.860
 let's try setting a value of 50 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.950
 pixel and this will always depend on 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.629
 image resolution we confirm 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.069
 we see that a circle has been created 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:26.920
 this does not mean that it will be one 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:29.650
 so curved selection but will have one 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.409
 gradient control c to copy 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:35.319
 this area or change couple and 

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:38.560
 control v to paste it into a layer 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:41.709
 above so hidden above all how much 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.760
 let's see how it's done if I turn this off 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.310
 here 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.879
 here you see that this one 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.319
 shade to the outside 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:52.239
 on this level we increase a little 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:54.010
 contrast and saturation we do a little 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:57.489
 let us make a little bit emerge 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:01.030
 then a dot adjustment level 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:03.970
 central here we check curves and 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:06.220
 with curves if we generate a sort of 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:09.489
 then assigning a dot here 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:12.310
 with one click and another here and doing the 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:16.959
 our s we manage to have one 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:20.410
 saturation greater than color and a 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:22.599
 even higher contrast 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.000
 I close and associate this regulation 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:27.370
 only the central part therefore me 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.160
 position between the highest level is 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:32.349
 the one below others on the keyboard 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.540
 because it is believed that the symbol there is a 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:36.129
 click and I will have applied this 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.989
 adjustment only at the level 

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:40.060
 below 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:42.699
 two vignettes must then be added 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:46.540
 vertical a little like two bands 

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:49.180
 on the vertical sides therefore a 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.859
 new level especially as that 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:54.879
 the black foreground is still fine 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:58.090
 rectangular selection I describe one 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:04:01.930
 more or less selection than this 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:06.340
 width we will go to the eye and pressing the 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:09.129
 uppercase key and in the meantime we generate 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:11.260
 another selection we can apply 

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:13.629
 two selections at the same time 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:16.959
 by pressing the uppercase key we have one 

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:19.320
 sum of selection therefore we have 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:21.849
 fill with black again 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:25.090
 let's fill up let's see the two 

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:27.740
 filled beautiful bands we clear e 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:29.990
 let's fade these 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:34.039
 at this level then with filter 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:37.280
 blur blur control the 

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:39.380
 unless we make clear we give this 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.680
 pass this transition a bit like 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:45.680
 if it were a shade 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:48.500
 we confirm and reduce its intensity 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:53.110
 therefore it should be considered as vignetting 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:56.270
 as if it were a bit of a shadow on the 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:59.660
 on the image yet another level 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:02.180
 new void above and this time 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:04.669
 we must generate two selections a 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:08.120
 semicircle in the lower part and in the 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:12.620
 upper part to make a semicircle of 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:14.930
 selection will not find them in the in 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:17.419
 prepared selections or we do a 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:19.039
 circle and then subtract with another 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:23.599
 I will show you the selection tool 

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:27.050
 how then the elliptical genero is inspired 

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:31.610
 a circle more or less than the size 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:35.060
 that I need with another tool of 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:37.159
 select the rectangle if we have before 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:40.669
 capitalized to add 

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:44.210
 selection to deduct instead yes 

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:46.520
 will push alt key we see that yes 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:48.820
 adds a minus sign to the selection and if 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:51.770
 we describe it this way we go 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:54.139
 literally cutting off the first one 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:56.780
 part of the poetry selection 

00:05:54.139 --> 00:06:00.070
 position here we can save it for 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:02.800
 don't repeat it 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:05.110
 in the lower part or we can 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:08.470
 copy what we're going to add 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:10.960
 here to then report it also below 

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:16.600
 therefore the selection must be shaded also here 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:19.210
 if before it went well 50 per 

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:25.270
 we go to do it another time 

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:28.930
 therefore with modification fades and 50 pixels 

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:30.880
 I apologize and confirm it goes here 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:34.480
 filled in white instead of black 

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:37.560
 then inverted bucket colors the 

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:41.740
 close up with white fill 

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:43.780
 uncheck this level for 

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:45.730
 create that part that also goes below 

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:49.420
 then drag in the seconds with in 

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:53.050
 bottom right I invert it as like 

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:56.590
 positioning then change transforms 

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:59.260
 reflect vertically here it is here one 

00:06:56.590 --> 00:07:02.140
 tool move I am going to bring to the of 

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:05.290
 below, we will have these two spots 

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:08.200
 which then have to be changed here as well 

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:12.790
 give a more clear air in these in 

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:16.210
 these two areas we can combine these 

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:18.460
 two levels with control and activate the 

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:20.530
 higher control and means that it unites 

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:22.950
 with underlying 

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:25.660
 and this because we will apply the same 

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:29.050
 opacity then we will reduce it for 

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:32.420
 create a halo is clear if in the 

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:34.490
 vertical side vignettes and state 

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:36.560
 used black here instead goes spy finger in 

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:39.590
 white we can also try to move 

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:40.880
 level 3 above and this for 

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:44.180
 see if things change a little 

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:46.130
 actually it is a little more accentuated is 

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:49.210
 more or less more or less what 

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:52.190
 it could be the may fair 

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:55.520
 naturally they are not the real filters 

00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:57.170
 instagram is a one way 

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:59.630
 suggestion a moment a series of 

00:07:57.170 --> 00:08:02.930
 techniques that with photoshop we can 

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:06.070
 use to make them so 

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:06.070
 quite realistic
