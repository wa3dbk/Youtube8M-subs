really good really interesting episodes
I<00:03:07.239> hope<00:03:07.510> they're<00:03:07.840> not<00:03:07.870> gonna<00:03:08.530> add<00:03:08.860> some<00:03:09.340> ending

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
I hope they're not gonna add some ending

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.420 
I hope they're not gonna add some ending
flashbacks<00:03:10.840> or<00:03:11.170> something<00:03:11.620> like<00:03:11.709> that<00:03:11.769> to

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
flashbacks or something like that to

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.759 
flashbacks or something like that to
ruin<00:03:13.329> the<00:03:13.450> experience<00:03:13.900> I<00:03:14.230> hope<00:03:14.470> that<00:03:14.620> they're

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
ruin the experience I hope that they're

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:18.240 
ruin the experience I hope that they're
going<00:03:14.920> to<00:03:15.070> be<00:03:15.269> close<00:03:16.269> to<00:03:16.299> the<00:03:16.930> manga<00:03:17.440> I<00:03:17.709> believe

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
going to be close to the manga I believe

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:19.770 
going to be close to the manga I believe
you<00:03:18.370> I<00:03:18.519> believe<00:03:19.030> that<00:03:19.390> they're<00:03:19.540> going<00:03:19.690> to

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
you I believe that they're going to

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.740 
you I believe that they're going to
cover<00:03:20.220> what<00:03:21.220> campus<00:03:21.579> in<00:03:21.730> the<00:03:21.760> manga<00:03:22.030> without

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
cover what campus in the manga without

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.099 
cover what campus in the manga without
any<00:03:23.019> additional<00:03:24.390> flashback<00:03:25.390> scenes<00:03:25.720> or

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:26.109 
any additional flashback scenes or

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:28.229 
any additional flashback scenes or
filler<00:03:26.410> scenes<00:03:26.769> or<00:03:26.950> stuff<00:03:27.160> like<00:03:27.310> that<00:03:27.370> I<00:03:27.700> hope

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
filler scenes or stuff like that I hope

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:31.020 
filler scenes or stuff like that I hope
it's<00:03:28.390> going<00:03:28.510> to<00:03:28.630> be<00:03:28.720> like<00:03:28.900> that<00:03:29.609> so<00:03:30.609> all<00:03:30.790> in<00:03:30.940> all

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
it's going to be like that so all in all

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:32.819 
it's going to be like that so all in all
it<00:03:31.329> should<00:03:31.600> be<00:03:31.750> an<00:03:31.840> interesting<00:03:31.959> month<00:03:32.410> now
