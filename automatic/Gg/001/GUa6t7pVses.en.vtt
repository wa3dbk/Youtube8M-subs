getting nice thought you can see they're

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:00.880 
getting nice thought you can see they're
starting<00:03:59.209> to<00:03:59.240> get<00:03:59.450> a<00:03:59.510> little<00:03:59.690> bit<00:03:59.840> liquidy<00:04:00.380> now

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890 
starting to get a little bit liquidy now

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:03.070 
starting to get a little bit liquidy now
if<00:04:00.950> I<00:04:01.100> just<00:04:01.310> kept<00:04:01.580> letting<00:04:01.850> them<00:04:02.209> saute<00:04:02.810> like

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080 
if I just kept letting them saute like

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.530 
if I just kept letting them saute like
this<00:04:03.320> will<00:04:03.560> happen<00:04:03.590> is<00:04:04.130> the<00:04:04.700> moisture<00:04:05.270> will

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
this will happen is the moisture will

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.479 
this will happen is the moisture will
all<00:04:05.750> just<00:04:06.020> evaporate<00:04:06.709> and<00:04:06.950> they'll<00:04:07.100> sort<00:04:07.370> of

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:07.489 
all just evaporate and they'll sort of

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:11.020 
all just evaporate and they'll sort of
get<00:04:08.260> caramelized<00:04:09.260> which<00:04:09.980> some<00:04:10.520> people<00:04:10.670> like

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
get caramelized which some people like

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.300 
get caramelized which some people like
that<00:04:11.300> so<00:04:11.660> if<00:04:11.870> you<00:04:11.989> like<00:04:12.260> that<00:04:12.530> approach<00:04:12.830> then

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
that so if you like that approach then

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.100 
that so if you like that approach then
just<00:04:13.550> don't<00:04:13.790> put<00:04:14.090> any<00:04:14.239> more<00:04:14.480> liquid<00:04:14.870> in<00:04:14.989> it

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.110 
just don't put any more liquid in it

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:17.949 
just don't put any more liquid in it
keep<00:04:15.800> it<00:04:15.950> at<00:04:16.070> sort<00:04:16.340> of<00:04:16.430> us<00:04:16.579> a<00:04:16.760> low<00:04:17.510> to<00:04:17.930> medium

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
keep it at sort of us a low to medium

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.530 
keep it at sort of us a low to medium
heat<00:04:18.320> and<00:04:18.680> they'll<00:04:18.919> just<00:04:19.100> caramelize<00:04:19.730> and<00:04:20.000> but

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:20.540 
heat and they'll just caramelize and but

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.330 
heat and they'll just caramelize and but
but<00:04:20.750> the<00:04:20.989> moisture<00:04:21.440> will<00:04:21.650> come<00:04:21.859> out<00:04:22.040> of<00:04:22.160> them

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
but the moisture will come out of them

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.550 
but the moisture will come out of them
and<00:04:22.460> all<00:04:22.640> of<00:04:22.790> those<00:04:22.940> salts<00:04:23.510> that<00:04:23.600> came<00:04:24.110> from<00:04:24.320> a

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
and all of those salts that came from a

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.370 
and all of those salts that came from a
salt<00:04:25.460> pepper<00:04:25.700> mix<00:04:26.030> and<00:04:26.360> the<00:04:26.450> the<00:04:26.780> garlic<00:04:27.200> will

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 
salt pepper mix and the the garlic will

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.590 
salt pepper mix and the the garlic will
really<00:04:27.800> be<00:04:27.979> pronounced<00:04:28.640> so<00:04:29.150> if<00:04:29.240> you<00:04:29.330> want<00:04:29.540> to

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
really be pronounced so if you want to

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.180 
really be pronounced so if you want to
keep<00:04:29.720> them<00:04:29.900> a<00:04:29.990> little<00:04:30.020> moist<00:04:30.470> and<00:04:30.919> add<00:04:31.160> a

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
keep them a little moist and add a

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.030 
keep them a little moist and add a
little<00:04:31.510> touch<00:04:32.510> of<00:04:32.690> line<00:04:32.900> just<00:04:33.590> take<00:04:33.830> what

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
little touch of line just take what

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.810 
little touch of line just take what
probably<00:04:34.460> a<00:04:34.520> drink<00:04:34.910> and<00:04:35.030> this<00:04:35.180> one

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
probably a drink and this one

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.850 
probably a drink and this one
what<00:04:36.820> red<00:04:37.180> or<00:04:37.420> white<00:04:37.450> doesn't<00:04:38.230> matter<00:04:38.380> I<00:04:38.710> mean

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
what red or white doesn't matter I mean

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.440 
what red or white doesn't matter I mean
depends<00:04:39.250> on<00:04:39.340> what<00:04:39.460> you<00:04:39.580> like<00:04:39.610> or<00:04:39.940> depends<00:04:40.360> on

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:40.450
