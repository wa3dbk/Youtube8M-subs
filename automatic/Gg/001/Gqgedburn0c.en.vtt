00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
that dries it'll be end up being a nice

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.229 
that dries it'll be end up being a nice
texture<00:00:31.769> just<00:00:31.920> helps<00:00:32.219> everything<00:00:32.460> tie<00:00:32.790> in<00:00:33.000> and

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
texture just helps everything tie in and

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.620

then<00:00:34.140> I<00:00:34.170> have<00:00:34.640> normally<00:00:35.640> two<00:00:35.880> last<00:00:36.120> steps<00:00:36.450> I

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
then I have normally two last steps I

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.290

my scrapbooking and card-making forever

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.170 
my scrapbooking and card-making forever
I've<00:02:04.079> always<00:02:04.560> liked<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:05.009> look<00:02:05.219> I<00:02:05.490> just<00:02:05.939> go

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
I've always liked the look I just go

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
I've always liked the look I just go
direct<00:02:06.570> to<00:02:06.719> paper

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
direct to paper

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.979 
direct to paper
I<00:02:07.380> don't<00:02:07.710> worry<00:02:07.979> if<00:02:08.160> it<00:02:08.280> touches<00:02:08.520> other<00:02:08.910> pages

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
I don't worry if it touches other pages

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.600 
I don't worry if it touches other pages
that's<00:02:10.679> just<00:02:10.890> how<00:02:10.979> I<00:02:11.009> like<00:02:11.250> things

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
that's just how I like things

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.070 
that's just how I like things
I

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
I

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.420 
I
I<00:02:12.140> think<00:02:12.380> it's<00:02:12.560> it's<00:02:12.890> something<00:02:13.280> I've<00:02:13.400> done

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
I think it's it's something I've done

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.640 
I think it's it's something I've done
for<00:02:13.760> a<00:02:13.790> long<00:02:13.940> time<00:02:14.270> and<00:02:14.600> sometimes<00:02:15.230> I<00:02:15.500> won't

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
for a long time and sometimes I won't

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:16.870 
for a long time and sometimes I won't
use<00:02:15.740> black<00:02:15.980> maybe<00:02:16.250> I'll<00:02:16.370> use<00:02:16.400> a<00:02:16.550> different

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
use black maybe I'll use a different

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.260 
use black maybe I'll use a different
color<00:02:17.150> but<00:02:18.050> I<00:02:18.380> just<00:02:18.860> think<00:02:19.040> it<00:02:19.280> helps<00:02:19.790> with<00:02:20.000> the

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
color but I just think it helps with the

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.510 
color but I just think it helps with the
with<00:02:20.600> the<00:02:20.720> finished<00:02:21.050> product<00:02:21.380> so<00:02:22.190> this<00:02:22.310> is

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
with the finished product so this is

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.520 
with the finished product so this is
really<00:02:22.730> really<00:02:22.850> wet<00:02:23.240> I<00:02:23.570> won't<00:02:24.230> do<00:02:24.380> any

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
really really wet I won't do any

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.190 
really really wet I won't do any
handwritten<00:02:25.370> journaling<00:02:25.910> all<00:02:26.900> these

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200
