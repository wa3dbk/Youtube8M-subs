00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
oil spray the best way to describe it is

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.339

like a dry oil for your hair it gets a

lot of shine without being oily or
weighing<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.250> hair<00:02:29.430> down<00:02:29.639> very<00:02:30.090> nice<00:02:30.269> and

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.840 

then<00:02:34.260> just<00:02:34.530> continue<00:02:34.680> to<00:02:34.980> separate<00:02:35.489> the<00:02:35.639> hair

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
then just continue to separate the hair

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
I definitely liked the results of the

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.970 
I definitely liked the results of the
smaller<00:02:38.940> odds<00:02:39.180> in<00:02:39.329> the<00:02:39.450> front<00:02:39.720> it<00:02:40.620> came<00:02:40.799> out<00:02:40.950> a

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
smaller odds in the front it came out a

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.340 
smaller odds in the front it came out a
little<00:02:41.069> bit<00:02:41.220> better<00:02:41.340> than<00:02:41.579> the<00:02:41.639> back<00:02:42.350> also

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
little bit better than the back also

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:44.870 
little bit better than the back also
because<00:02:43.799> I<00:02:43.889> can't<00:02:44.100> see<00:02:44.250> the<00:02:44.310> back<00:02:44.489> of<00:02:44.609> my<00:02:44.639> head

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
because I can't see the back of my head

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.599 
because I can't see the back of my head
I<00:02:45.060> may<00:02:45.660> not<00:02:45.840> have<00:02:46.079> rolled<00:02:46.380> that<00:02:46.620> is<00:02:46.799> carefully

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:49.609 

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:52.370 

so<00:02:50.609> just<00:02:50.790> continue<00:02:50.940> to<00:02:51.180> separate<00:02:51.840> and<00:02:52.019> fluff

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
so just continue to separate and fluff

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
bangs that are growing out and so I

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.270 
bangs that are growing out and so I
decided<00:02:57.450> to<00:02:57.660> pull<00:02:57.989> the<00:02:58.260> front<00:02:58.500> back<00:02:58.799> to<00:02:59.130> give

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
decided to pull the front back to give

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.460 
decided to pull the front back to give
it<00:02:59.430> a<00:02:59.489> little<00:02:59.639> bit<00:02:59.819> more<00:03:00.030> of<00:03:00.090> a<00:03:00.319> kind<00:03:01.319> of<00:03:01.350> a
