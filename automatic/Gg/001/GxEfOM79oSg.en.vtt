00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
slides in I mean on reviews on cases

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.330 
slides in I mean on reviews on cases
like<00:01:20.060> this<00:01:20.329> you<00:01:20.450> know<00:01:20.570> unless<00:01:20.659> I<00:01:20.930> am<00:01:21.890> dunking

it in water or spilling stuff over it I

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.990 
it in water or spilling stuff over it I
mean<00:01:25.009> case<00:01:25.189> is<00:01:25.340> a<00:01:25.369> pretty<00:01:25.640> straightforward

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
mean case is a pretty straightforward

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.889 
mean case is a pretty straightforward
and<00:01:26.689> they're<00:01:27.500> a<00:01:27.530> personal<00:01:28.100> option<00:01:28.579> so<00:01:28.909> you

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:29.899 
and they're a personal option so you

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:31.810 
and they're a personal option so you
know<00:01:30.020> what<00:01:30.380> I<00:01:30.409> might<00:01:30.740> like<00:01:31.039> you<00:01:31.070> may<00:01:31.399> not<00:01:31.549> like

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
know what I might like you may not like

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.899 
know what I might like you may not like
and<00:01:32.170> so<00:01:33.170> on<00:01:33.289> and<00:01:33.469> so<00:01:33.500> forth<00:01:33.619> but<00:01:34.100> I<00:01:34.310> just<00:01:34.729> want

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
and so on and so forth but I just want

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:36.249 
and so on and so forth but I just want
to<00:01:34.939> let<00:01:35.030> you<00:01:35.210> know<00:01:35.240> about<00:01:35.450> this<00:01:35.810> case<00:01:36.049> because

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:36.259 
to let you know about this case because

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:38.200 
to let you know about this case because
I<00:01:36.409> think<00:01:36.619> it<00:01:36.679> provides<00:01:36.859> a<00:01:37.340> decent<00:01:38.000> admit

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
I think it provides a decent admit

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.080 
I think it provides a decent admit
amount<00:01:38.630> of<00:01:38.780> protection<00:01:38.960> for<00:01:39.590> the<00:01:40.219> iphone<00:01:40.549> 3g

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
amount of protection for the iphone 3g

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.770 
amount of protection for the iphone 3g
and<00:01:42.520> although<00:01:43.520> it's<00:01:43.640> not<00:01:43.700> the<00:01:43.939> case<00:01:44.420> of<00:01:44.630> my

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
and although it's not the case of my

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.529 
and although it's not the case of my
choice<00:01:45.079> at<00:01:45.409> this<00:01:45.560> time<00:01:45.859> it<00:01:46.759> still<00:01:47.060> isn't<00:01:47.240> a<00:01:47.390> bad

00:01:47.529 --> 00:01:47.539 
choice at this time it still isn't a bad

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:49.060 
choice at this time it still isn't a bad
case<00:01:47.810> and<00:01:48.020> some<00:01:48.170> people<00:01:48.380> may<00:01:48.530> like<00:01:48.560> it<00:01:48.770> because

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
case and some people may like it because

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.880 
case and some people may like it because
of<00:01:49.249> the<00:01:49.609> way<00:01:50.329> it<00:01:50.450> fits<00:01:50.659> so<00:01:50.960> basically<00:01:51.770> we're

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
of the way it fits so basically we're

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.090 
of the way it fits so basically we're
going<00:01:52.009> to<00:01:52.070> take<00:01:52.219> the<00:01:52.399> iphone<00:01:53.060> 3g<00:01:53.539> here<00:01:53.780> and

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
going to take the iphone 3g here and

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.029 
going to take the iphone 3g here and
slide<00:01:55.100> it<00:01:55.130> right<00:01:55.429> in<00:01:55.939> as<00:01:56.469> you<00:01:57.469> can<00:01:57.590> see<00:01:57.740> takes<00:01:57.979> a

00:01:58.029 --> 00:01:58.039 
slide it right in as you can see takes a

believe as you can see in the picture
here<00:02:26.050> there<00:02:26.740> is<00:02:26.860> a<00:02:26.890> virgin<00:02:27.160> that<00:02:27.490> does<00:02:27.730> come

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
here there is a virgin that does come

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.030 
here there is a virgin that does come
with<00:02:28.150> it<00:02:28.270> but<00:02:28.840> again<00:02:28.930> I<00:02:29.230> like<00:02:29.590> one<00:02:29.860> that

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
with it but again I like one that

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.310 
with it but again I like one that
swivels<00:02:30.580> 360<00:02:31.270> degrees<00:02:31.750> because<00:02:31.960> I<00:02:32.140> like

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
swivels 360 degrees because I like

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.990 
swivels 360 degrees because I like
holding<00:02:33.280> the<00:02:33.370> phone<00:02:33.550> on<00:02:33.820> my<00:02:34.560> belt<00:02:35.560> this<00:02:35.770> way

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
holding the phone on my belt this way

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.810 
holding the phone on my belt this way
what<00:02:37.000> I<00:02:37.030> don't<00:02:37.150> like<00:02:37.450> about<00:02:37.600> this<00:02:38.080> case<00:02:38.820> has

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
what I don't like about this case has

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.220 
what I don't like about this case has
nothing<00:02:40.060> to<00:02:40.360> do<00:02:40.450> with<00:02:40.570> the<00:02:40.630> protection<00:02:41.110> it

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
nothing to do with the protection it

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.500 
nothing to do with the protection it
affords<00:02:41.260> a<00:02:41.710> good<00:02:41.920> protection<00:02:42.280> but<00:02:43.240> if<00:02:43.420> you

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
affords a good protection but if you

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:44.610 
affords a good protection but if you
look<00:02:43.660> at<00:02:43.810> the<00:02:43.900> case<00:02:44.110> and<00:02:44.260> the<00:02:44.350> way<00:02:44.470> it's

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
look at the case and the way it's

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.410 
look at the case and the way it's
designed<00:02:44.770> it's<00:02:45.130> right<00:02:45.340> here<00:02:46.050> these<00:02:47.050> I<00:02:48.420> don't

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
designed it's right here these I don't

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:50.760 
designed it's right here these I don't
know<00:02:49.480> what<00:02:49.570> you<00:02:49.690> want<00:02:49.840> to<00:02:49.870> call<00:02:50.050> them<00:02:50.110> the<00:02:50.680> way

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
know what you want to call them the way

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.520 
know what you want to call them the way
they<00:02:50.800> stick<00:02:51.160> up<00:02:51.190> the<00:02:51.670> spikes<00:02:52.080> what<00:02:53.080> I<00:02:53.110> found

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
they stick up the spikes what I found

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.080 
they stick up the spikes what I found
was<00:02:54.130> I<00:02:54.280> was<00:02:54.430> catching<00:02:54.700> this<00:02:55.000> a<00:02:55.240> lot<00:02:55.870> on

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
was I was catching this a lot on

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.550 
was I was catching this a lot on
different<00:02:58.090> things<00:02:58.300> whether<00:02:58.540> it<00:02:58.720> be<00:02:58.840> you<00:02:59.440> know

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
different things whether it be you know

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.530 
different things whether it be you know
getting<00:02:59.740> into<00:03:00.010> the<00:03:00.130> car<00:03:00.340> or<00:03:00.730> getting<00:03:01.240> out<00:03:01.360> of<00:03:01.480> a

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
getting into the car or getting out of a

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.170 
getting into the car or getting out of a
chair<00:03:01.870> and<00:03:02.740> what<00:03:03.250> happens<00:03:03.640> over<00:03:03.790> time<00:03:03.910> is

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
chair and what happens over time is

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.810 
chair and what happens over time is
these<00:03:04.840> these<00:03:05.200> kind<00:03:05.470> of<00:03:05.560> bend<00:03:05.770> out<00:03:05.980> and<00:03:06.250> it

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
these these kind of bend out and it

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.600 
these these kind of bend out and it
doesn't<00:03:07.090> afford<00:03:07.360> that<00:03:07.690> now<00:03:08.430> good<00:03:09.430> of<00:03:09.550> a

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
doesn't afford that now good of a

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.780 
doesn't afford that now good of a
protection<00:03:10.000> I<00:03:10.740> don't<00:03:11.740> know<00:03:11.920> if<00:03:12.070> there's<00:03:12.280> a<00:03:12.550> way

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
protection I don't know if there's a way

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.730 
protection I don't know if there's a way
the<00:03:12.940> case<00:03:13.120> making<00:03:13.570> you<00:03:13.900> know<00:03:13.990> redesign<00:03:14.530> this

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:14.740 
the case making you know redesign this

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.010 
the case making you know redesign this
maybe<00:03:15.010> make<00:03:15.250> this<00:03:15.430> come<00:03:16.240> across<00:03:16.570> the<00:03:16.750> side

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:17.020 
maybe make this come across the side

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.920 
maybe make this come across the side
here<00:03:17.970> just<00:03:18.970> to<00:03:19.060> make<00:03:19.209> it<00:03:19.239> fit<00:03:19.510> a<00:03:19.540> little<00:03:19.810> bit

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
here just to make it fit a little bit

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.440 
here just to make it fit a little bit
better<00:03:20.110> otherwise<00:03:21.100> I<00:03:21.160> think<00:03:21.340> the<00:03:21.610> case<00:03:21.820> does<00:03:22.420> a

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
better otherwise I think the case does a

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.520 
better otherwise I think the case does a
good<00:03:22.870> job<00:03:23.550> again<00:03:24.550> that's<00:03:24.790> really<00:03:25.330> my<00:03:25.480> only

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
good job again that's really my only

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.660 
good job again that's really my only
biggest<00:03:26.530> sticking<00:03:26.800> point<00:03:27.040> and<00:03:27.519> that's

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
biggest sticking point and that's

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.400 
biggest sticking point and that's
probably<00:03:27.880> why<00:03:28.300> I<00:03:28.330> wouldn't<00:03:28.720> use<00:03:28.930> this<00:03:29.140> case

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
probably why I wouldn't use this case

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.590 
probably why I wouldn't use this case
this<00:03:30.220> case<00:03:30.459> may<00:03:30.670> be<00:03:30.700> great<00:03:31.030> for<00:03:31.209> somebody<00:03:31.510> who

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
this case may be great for somebody who

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.800 
this case may be great for somebody who
keeps<00:03:31.750> it<00:03:31.959> in<00:03:32.080> their<00:03:32.230> pocket<00:03:32.440> or<00:03:33.120> from<00:03:34.120> a<00:03:34.450> woman

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
keeps it in their pocket or from a woman

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.720 
keeps it in their pocket or from a woman
who<00:03:34.870> keeps<00:03:35.019> it<00:03:35.230> in<00:03:35.320> their<00:03:35.470> pocket<00:03:35.650> book<00:03:36.010> but<00:03:36.700> I

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
who keeps it in their pocket book but I

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.259 
who keeps it in their pocket book but I
find<00:03:37.180> that<00:03:37.360> it's<00:03:37.780> not<00:03:38.019> good<00:03:38.320> for<00:03:38.350> um<00:03:39.209> for<00:03:40.209> what

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
find that it's not good for um for what

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:43.110 
find that it's not good for um for what
I<00:03:40.390> need<00:03:40.690> it<00:03:40.810> for<00:03:40.890> but<00:03:41.890> it<00:03:42.519> doesn't<00:03:42.850> take<00:03:42.970> away

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
I need it for but it doesn't take away

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.550 
I need it for but it doesn't take away
from<00:03:43.209> the<00:03:43.420> quality<00:03:43.690> it's<00:03:44.080> a<00:03:44.170> pretty<00:03:44.350> good

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
from the quality it's a pretty good

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.220 
from the quality it's a pretty good
quality<00:03:44.769> case<00:03:45.280> as<00:03:45.580> you<00:03:46.120> can<00:03:46.239> see<00:03:46.510> you<00:03:46.720> have

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
quality case as you can see you have
