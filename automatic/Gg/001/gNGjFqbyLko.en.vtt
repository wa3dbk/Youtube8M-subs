one<00:02:59.050> of<00:02:59.080> these<00:02:59.170> figures<00:02:59.410> that<00:02:59.709> has<00:02:59.830> an<00:03:00.010> extra

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
one of these figures that has an extra

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.880 
one of these figures that has an extra
joint<00:03:00.610> they're<00:03:00.820> all<00:03:00.970> pretty<00:03:01.180> basic<00:03:01.530> it<00:03:02.530> seems

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
joint they're all pretty basic it seems

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:04.770 
joint they're all pretty basic it seems
like<00:03:03.040> they<00:03:03.190> threw<00:03:03.459> the<00:03:03.640> same<00:03:03.910> articulation

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
like they threw the same articulation

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.000 
like they threw the same articulation
into<00:03:05.020> all<00:03:05.170> of<00:03:05.200> them<00:03:05.520> so<00:03:06.520> it's<00:03:06.670> pretty<00:03:07.240> decent

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
into all of them so it's pretty decent

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.920 
into all of them so it's pretty decent
but<00:03:09.010> anyways<00:03:09.340> that<00:03:09.910> was<00:03:09.940> Wesley<00:03:10.480> Crusher

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
but anyways that was Wesley Crusher

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.980
