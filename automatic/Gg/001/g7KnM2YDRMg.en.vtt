00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
the top we have a penny which is worth

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.930 
the top we have a penny which is worth
one<00:00:36.780> cent

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:39.940 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.300 

below<00:00:40.660> the<00:00:40.810> penny<00:00:41.020> we<00:00:41.350> have<00:00:41.530> a<00:00:41.560> nickel<00:00:41.860> which

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:42.310 
below the penny we have a nickel which

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:47.220 
below the penny we have a nickel which
is<00:00:42.489> worth<00:00:42.640> five<00:00:43.000> cents<00:00:43.390> right<00:00:45.870> here<00:00:46.870> we<00:00:47.050> have<00:00:47.200> a

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:47.230 
is worth five cents right here we have a

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.610 
is worth five cents right here we have a
dime

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:50.620 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.410 

although<00:00:51.219> the<00:00:51.370> dime<00:00:51.550> is<00:00:51.730> smaller<00:00:52.030> than<00:00:52.270> the

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:52.420 
although the dime is smaller than the

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.600 
although the dime is smaller than the
other<00:00:52.570> coins<00:00:52.899> we<00:00:53.469> know<00:00:53.649> that<00:00:53.860> the<00:00:54.010> size<00:00:54.250> does

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:54.610 
other coins we know that the size does

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:56.970 
other coins we know that the size does
not<00:00:54.640> matter<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:55.870> dime<00:00:56.110> is<00:00:56.320> actually<00:00:56.739> worth

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:56.980 
not matter the dime is actually worth

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:58.770 
not matter the dime is actually worth
more<00:00:57.010> than<00:00:57.460> the<00:00:57.579> penny<00:00:57.820> and<00:00:57.910> the<00:00:58.180> nickel<00:00:58.629> a

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
more than the penny and the nickel a

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.620 
more than the penny and the nickel a
dime<00:00:59.530> is<00:00:59.739> worth<00:00:59.769> 10<00:01:00.339> cents

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:03.630 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.810 

so<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:03.810> dime<00:01:04.110> is<00:01:04.290> worth<00:01:04.320> ten<00:01:04.770> pennies<00:01:05.070> or<00:01:05.700> you

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
so a dime is worth ten pennies or you

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.580 
so a dime is worth ten pennies or you
could<00:01:06.030> also<00:01:06.150> say<00:01:06.510> that<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.720> dime<00:01:06.990> is<00:01:07.140> worth<00:01:07.290> two

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
could also say that a dime is worth two

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.440 
could also say that a dime is worth two
nickels<00:01:08.040> because<00:01:08.670> two<00:01:08.910> nickels<00:01:09.270> together

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
nickels because two nickels together

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.300 
nickels because two nickels together
make<00:01:09.870> ten<00:01:10.200> cents

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
make ten cents

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.910 
make ten cents
on<00:01:12.369> the<00:01:13.090> bottom<00:01:13.270> we<00:01:13.479> have<00:01:13.750> a<00:01:13.780> quarter<00:01:14.259> and<00:01:14.439> a

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
on the bottom we have a quarter and a

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.539 
on the bottom we have a quarter and a
quarter<00:01:15.340> is<00:01:15.549> worth<00:01:15.610> 25<00:01:16.079> cents<00:01:17.079> a<00:01:17.409> quarter<00:01:18.340> is

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:18.549 
quarter is worth 25 cents a quarter is

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:20.520 
quarter is worth 25 cents a quarter is
worth<00:01:18.820> more<00:01:19.119> than<00:01:19.299> any<00:01:19.570> of<00:01:19.780> these<00:01:19.930> other<00:01:19.990> coins

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
worth more than any of these other coins

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.370 
worth more than any of these other coins
if<00:01:20.890> we<00:01:21.579> wanted<00:01:21.909> to<00:01:22.030> get<00:01:22.149> 25<00:01:22.659> cents<00:01:23.079> in<00:01:23.200> pennies

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
if we wanted to get 25 cents in pennies

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.700 
if we wanted to get 25 cents in pennies
how<00:01:24.039> many<00:01:24.250> pennies<00:01:24.640> would<00:01:24.850> we<00:01:25.030> need

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.340 

we<00:01:29.310> would<00:01:29.520> need<00:01:29.670> 25<00:01:30.210> pennies<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.870> get<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.140> same

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
we would need 25 pennies to get the same

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.510 
we would need 25 pennies to get the same
amount<00:01:31.620> as<00:01:31.830> one<00:01:32.100> quarter<00:01:32.550> how<00:01:33.060> cool<00:01:33.390> is<00:01:33.570> that

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
amount as one quarter how cool is that

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.980 
amount as one quarter how cool is that
since<00:01:35.520> we<00:01:35.670> already<00:01:35.910> have<00:01:36.360> learned<00:01:36.540> about<00:01:36.750> the

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
since we already have learned about the

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.200 
since we already have learned about the
penny<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.440> the<00:01:37.590> nickel<00:01:37.950> let's<00:01:38.430> just<00:01:38.730> focus<00:01:38.940> on

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
penny and the nickel let's just focus on

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.780 
penny and the nickel let's just focus on
the<00:01:39.360> dime<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.020> quarter

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.790 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.580 

here<00:01:43.790> is<00:01:43.910> the<00:01:44.090> dime<00:01:44.360> and<00:01:44.630> we<00:01:44.840> already<00:01:45.080> know<00:01:45.440> it

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
here is the dime and we already know it

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.830 
here is the dime and we already know it
is<00:01:45.680> worth<00:01:45.890> 10<00:01:46.220> cents<00:01:46.670> but<00:01:47.240> there<00:01:47.390> is<00:01:47.510> something

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
is worth 10 cents but there is something

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.650 
is worth 10 cents but there is something
really<00:01:48.110> cool<00:01:48.500> about<00:01:48.770> the<00:01:48.980> dime<00:01:49.540> when<00:01:50.540> you

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:50.660 
really cool about the dime when you

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:52.570 
really cool about the dime when you
count<00:01:50.960> dimes<00:01:51.260> you<00:01:51.560> get<00:01:51.740> to<00:01:51.860> count<00:01:52.070> by<00:01:52.190> tens

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
count dimes you get to count by tens

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.410 
count dimes you get to count by tens
because<00:01:52.910> each<00:01:53.300> dime<00:01:53.720> is<00:01:53.870> worth<00:01:53.900> 10<00:01:54.350> cents<00:01:55.420> so

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
because each dime is worth 10 cents so

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.360 
because each dime is worth 10 cents so
here<00:01:56.660> we<00:01:56.780> have<00:01:56.930> five<00:01:57.230> dimes<00:01:57.590> and<00:01:58.010> I<00:01:58.040> want<00:01:58.250> you

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:58.370

these<00:02:00.290> five<00:02:00.530> dimes<00:02:00.890> are<00:02:01.100> worth<00:02:01.690> we<00:02:02.690> have<00:02:02.900> 10<00:02:03.760> 20

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 
these five dimes are worth we have 10 20

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:11.470 
these five dimes are worth we have 10 20
30<00:02:06.080> 40<00:02:07.780> 50<00:02:08.780> we<00:02:09.590> have<00:02:09.740> 50<00:02:10.160> cents<00:02:10.550> in<00:02:10.640> all<00:02:10.820> that<00:02:11.240> is
