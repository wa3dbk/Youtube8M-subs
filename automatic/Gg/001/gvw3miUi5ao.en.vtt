00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:08.240
 Yes everyone Hello I started hero 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:13.010
 a This is not a toy review this time 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:19.189
 Masked rider latest ship to be on air from the 29th of this month 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:20.820
 I think you try to live a good future Kamen Rider bunch of voting was a native 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:25.050
 What is a vote 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:30.869
 I think some people are covered, but I will explain briefly 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:38.140
 It seems that this Showa rider and the Heisei rider are in agreement and pad- matched 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:43.690
 The received in Edo Yara win or lose it trying to get decided in a vote to us the viewer side 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:47.710
 It was in the night to wait for the end of the winter ground Kamen Rider Ryuki, but who is it 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:49.970
 There is a plan to decide by vote of survive or your audience 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:53.990
 I saw it in real time 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:01:01.070
 I have a memory of voting for survival 4 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:01:03.710
 That was a novelty, maybe I 'm going to shoot a pattern that both sides will win this time 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:10.330
 I think I'm doing 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:10.330
 Yeah Well you a little longer story in Now I would like to vote 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.780
 Ray 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:25.659
 Live directly below 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:25.659
 It is Heisei or Showa or Tokyo result to win determines the ending of swimming movie 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:39.060
 Surprising what 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:43.030
 Currently, Showa riders outweighs Heisei riders by 55.8% . 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:46.770
 Though I thought it was April at the time being the runaway 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.770
 After all children are also so 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:56.400
 Form Uncle generation guess Is that still Showa rider 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:57.620
 The age is my age but I saw it in real time 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.550
 Heel is 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:06.820
 Skyman and Ultra 1 in Super 1 Eki 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:10.420
 If it was a turn, it was Dengeman and Sambalkan, so I am not lost 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:14.510
 Kamen Rider I would like to vote for the Kamen Rider in Showa 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:18.270
 The point I'm focusing on this time is 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:21.770
 It is Mr. Hayami of Kamen Rider x 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.770
 It is the first time in 33 years- 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:35.150
 Mr. Hayami of this Kamen Rider x is a cool handsome guy and why is Kamen Rider 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:38.700
 I have a license for my motorcycle because I want to receive a lie and I am afraid of heights while shooting 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:42.180
 Seems to have hidden that it is 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:48.210
 It was like passion was amazing to be applied to the Rider of the time 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:53.010
 It seems like it was 3 3 times ok to join anytime if there is an opportunity 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:58.000
 What are the actors of the Showa riders, including Mr. Hayami ? 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:03:04.270
 It looks like good relationship in private but it looks like cohesion middle and high 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:07.210
 Speaking of cohesion, Mr. Araki, who played the role of Kamen Rider Stronger, has been sadly passed away 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:15.640
 The memorial to was very impressive 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:18.200
 To Hayamizu and professional spoon rain Eros ace loan that was not already passed away of about Araki of 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.880

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:25.130
