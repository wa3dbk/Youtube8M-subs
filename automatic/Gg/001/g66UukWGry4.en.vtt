00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.740
 hello how about that as we see we are already 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.410
 in fifa 13 and then here we see the new 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.240
 menu the truth that very good because 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.670
 We can find things more 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.099
 easily and as I told them the week 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.860
 So, here I bring you some 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.670
 matches 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:22.270
 with mx league team that I've done 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:26.150
 a change and as you will see in the front 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:30.020
 Prince net and putting it benítez 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:33.950
 the truth is very good forward has 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:36.980
 very good rhythm and it gives some very good 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:40.010
 Shots on Goal has worked very 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:42.829
 well this forward and here we go with the 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:45.350
 first opponent with a lineup of 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:47.809
 silver players and three players 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.450
 gold players there we see from sweden and 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:55.270
 other Spanish 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:58.090
 and here the match is going to start 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.660
 a match the truth that in which the 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.890
 video 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.890
 because 

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:09.890
 he has power 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:14.350
 because my defense does not reach its player 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.350
 to center the mind 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.710
 the singular ones coming out of the ball 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.729
 but here the normal brother options of 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.729
 fights header 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:40.520
 but well here he is wrong that he trusts 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.520
 in a day 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.600
 2 to 1 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:49.890
 of the tie 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.220
 I want to present the ball the takeoff 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:06.340
 with his defense makes it very easy and then 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:06.340
 with polish between the two it gets up 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.030
 the tie 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:18.790
 has died with that account 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.400
 and that is 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.960
 ahead 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:27.500
 It has always been counted while a little 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:29.920
 prayer is much easier to put the 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.920
 buoys 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:39.510
 but he promises 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:42.680
 coming soon with stations and a single 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.680
 house 0 1 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:52.270
 the actors were here you can commit 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:55.260
 penalty and here yes 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.260
 at the end of the game 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:01.200
 but he puts it in the middle 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:12.569
 54 fine again 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:15.959
 a role in the world 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:20.090
 the neighborhood looks like lots this is the 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:20.090
 4 which fired as if my body 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:29.630
 they have a very good shot and that's how it's going to end 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:33.280
 the match 6 to 5 we lost 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:38.540
 but then a very good match the truth 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:40.760
 here I bring you the second game 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:44.830
 we are looking for the rival and then as 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:49.510
 she commented to him to put the goals in the 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:53.720
 3 is much easier and like them and 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:56.930
 so he set something up there so we can 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.970
 make long distance goals and then 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.490
 for me it is much easier to do the 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:03.620
 goals here in the raffle 13 I do not know for 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:05.910
 you as you see it when you try the 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.190
 game 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:11.870
 here we are going to 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:11.870
 find the rival 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:18.760
 in a game the truth that with some 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:21.040
 very fast players gave me a lot 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.919
 can here we have overcome their players 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:27.250
 of france we see that way and that in the 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:29.220
 fifa 12 was a machine so be very 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:32.330
 Quick 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.330
 I want 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:43.740
 substantial benefit of not buying 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.740
 and so this place will be clarified 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:47.840
 by his side 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:56.780
 they get last goodbye football against the 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:59.259
 no one else's life if the drawers have 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.259
 the mistake 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:05.449
 but it only depends on what they are in 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:13.120
 the second time 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:13.120
 tied the game I go 

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:18.659
 yes 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.659
 but 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.810
 I'm going 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:40.920
 it's called sweeps with his defense I see that 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:42.090
 get the cut was so debatable from 

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:44.810
 there 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:44.810
 speed 

00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:55.820
 is what he gets to play with his goalkeeper 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:58.240
 and this afternoon 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:00.460
 you are the only one in my defense and that 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:05.380
 scope to the position 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:08.979
 and so the game is tied 4-4 and 

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:12.039
 Well here is going to end this video and 

00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:15.550
 Well, next week I plan to bring 

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:17.949

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:21.910
 I'm doing the premier barclays 

00:06:17.949 --> 00:06:24.009
 league that the truth is already 

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:25.990
 players are very very expensive they are 

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:29.860
 going up in price for example ramírez 

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:33.250
 that already goes for the 20,000 coins is 

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:34.900
 player and well next week 

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:38.800
