 the reason why acid span I had there though 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:12.110
 can see why they came 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.789
 besides being tense so that states bamber 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:16.159
 they span obviously not in the boom states 

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:18.440
 that clean that just logic and he 

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:19.970

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.530
 tense what there was no other 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:22.940

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:26.990
