00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.660 
of experience now I've come to realize
this<00:03:54.000> at<00:03:54.209> this<00:03:54.360> point<00:03:54.690> because<00:03:54.840> I've<00:03:55.440> played<00:03:56.160> a

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
this at this point because I've played a

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.690 
this at this point because I've played a

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
rounds and I managed to have 24

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.360 
rounds and I managed to have 24
victories<00:04:02.190> so<00:04:02.790> the<00:04:03.209> kv-5<00:04:04.010> manages<00:04:05.010> to<00:04:05.190> make

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
victories so the kv-5 manages to make

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.640 
victories so the kv-5 manages to make
good<00:04:05.670> credits<00:04:06.180> as<00:04:06.329> long<00:04:06.480> as<00:04:06.630> you<00:04:06.720> win<00:04:06.930> and<00:04:07.290> it's

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
good credits as long as you win and it's

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.130 
good credits as long as you win and it's
almost<00:04:07.980> equal<00:04:08.579> to<00:04:08.609> of<00:04:09.209> what<00:04:09.540> the<00:04:09.630> average<00:04:09.810> for

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140
