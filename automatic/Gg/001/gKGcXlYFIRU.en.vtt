00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:10.880
 massive theft in cyberspace a latino 

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:12.560
 take the reins of sprint and the tsunami 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.630
 of new products that is to come 

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.400
 in September as it is in I am vanessa 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:18.710
 hand orellana I'm going to open sama and 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.650
 welcome to our third episode of 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:24.320
 the week in cinema in Spanish we started 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.960
 with the attack of the hackers that happened 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.990
 gabriel because this week they announced us 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.480
 that there was a massive hack from Russia in 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:35.329
 where 1200 names were stolen 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:38.360
 users and passwords 500 million 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:40.550
 emails and attacked 420 thousand 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.050
 websites which means that very 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.149
 probably all of us went 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.559
 affected in some way or another and 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:47.420
 unfortunately there is no way to 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:50.059
 confirm it because there is no basis for 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.219
 data or any website where we can 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:54.320
 search our user names or 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:56.809
 our emails and see if 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.820
 they attacked us personally and if our 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:00.620
 information was not affected which 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.210
 vanessa means that we have to 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.670
 resort to the same advice 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:07.880
 always change your password with 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:10.369
 often use complicated passwords 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.039
 never use the same password in 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:15.289
 all the places where topics enter 

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:17.659
 good as well as it is happening to us 

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:19.909
 several times the first time they have 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:21.470
 our information was vulnerable and 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:22.969
 well at least every time I 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.159
 password change I forget the 

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:27.110
 another or the previous one and I do not know which one I entered 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:30.140
 then there are services like peace 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:32.780
 dotcom or one password that they offer you 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.789
 a master key style 'enter a 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.100
 password in this service and this 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:39.710
 service that generates passwords for you 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.049
 all your accounts then even if it happens 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.179
 something like this you will not be affected and we have 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:45.349
 that complete guide on our page 

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:49.009
 city.com 

00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:51.500
 diagonal sy and we continue with sprint another 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:54.200
 huge company from another provider 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.990
 mobile service here in the usa that had 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.119
 several several important announcements this 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.909
 week gabriel well it 's sprint is the 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:05.060
 third mobile phone operator more 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:07.579
 important from the USA that he intended to buy 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.319
 t-mobile and this week he said no that 

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:11.360
 in the end it will not be an offer for scam 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:14.210
 goes because it considers that the regulators 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.640
 in the USA they would not accept it 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:19.100
 Vanessa told us that they have appointed a 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.620
 new executive president and it turns out that 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.330
 is a bolivian marcelo claure comes from 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.870
 the brighstar company that he himself founded 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.670
 and now he's with the sprint reins and 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.200
 in order to jump-start of 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.020
 new this company that has been harshly 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:36.650
 criticized for taking so long in 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:38.690
 update and change your cellular network and 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.820
 modernize it and make it as fast as 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.890
 that of the market leaders that is 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:45.950
 verizon and haiti in you then let's hope 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:48.260
 to see what Marcelo does as leader of 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.090
 sprint and will see what it offers us in the 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.950
 good future that I get to put the 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.930
 name of Latinos on high because 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.870
 It is always a pride to see a Latino in 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.060
 technology that we do not have enough and 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.680
 we end with a gossip session 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.890
 gabriel because you already know that I like them 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:06.380
 the gossip and is that several came 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:09.470
 a video that was leaked on youtube from a 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:12.260
 tablet phone or gym with a pencil 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:14.510
 optical and good are seconds that you see in 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.880
 the video but if it really looks with a 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:20.480
 optical pen and it may compete 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:22.670
 directly with the samsung nou 3 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.069
 very successful and that now it will become 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:27.470
 on note 4 because we already have the 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:29.510
 invitation of the event of a pack of 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:32.299
 samsung and that in fact has the 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:35.870
 symbolize the fan icon that we saw 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:38.569
 in nou 3 and also another event that does not 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.310
 it has been confirmed with certainty but 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:43.370
 several sources have been published is the 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:46.640
 event both of apple in the presenter 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:49.549
 that they presented the iphone 6 that will be the 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:53.030
 September 9 according to these sources and 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:55.250
 good and we'll see if they bring a 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:57.560
 watch we will also be very careful 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.660
 I believe that the water will arrive in October 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.489
 but September as you say is going to be 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.260
 a very busy month we will be very 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:05.359
