awesome I love putting rubbing my finger

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.000 
awesome I love putting rubbing my finger
on<00:04:32.620> your<00:04:32.860> bunks<00:04:33.310> feel<00:04:34.120> so<00:04:34.330> cool<00:04:34.630> huh<00:04:35.139> but<00:04:35.889> she

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
on your bunks feel so cool huh but she

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:41.790 
on your bunks feel so cool huh but she
does<00:04:36.130> come<00:04:36.280> with<00:04:36.340> the<00:04:36.400> scroll

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.080 

and<00:04:42.800> of<00:04:42.980> course<00:04:43.010> like<00:04:43.340> I<00:04:43.430> said<00:04:43.640> some<00:04:43.850> little

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
and of course like I said some little

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:49.510 
and of course like I said some little
paper<00:04:45.520> for<00:04:46.520> the<00:04:46.670> scroll<00:04:47.890> so<00:04:48.890> I<00:04:48.920> think<00:04:49.100> this<00:04:49.340> one

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520 
paper for the scroll so I think this one

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:50.950 
paper for the scroll so I think this one
actually<00:04:49.610> comes<00:04:49.850> with<00:04:50.000> seven<00:04:50.570> I'm<00:04:50.750> not<00:04:50.900> sure

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
actually comes with seven I'm not sure

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.960 
actually comes with seven I'm not sure
it<00:04:51.500> might<00:04:51.620> come<00:04:51.800> with<00:04:51.950> six<00:04:52.220> because<00:04:52.790> there's

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
it might come with six because there's

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:56.830 
it might come with six because there's
one<00:04:53.180> in<00:04:53.300> here<00:04:53.330> so<00:04:53.750> that's<00:04:53.930> cool<00:04:54.170> um<00:04:55.690> she<00:04:56.690> does

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 
one in here so that's cool um she does

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.210 
one in here so that's cool um she does
have<00:04:57.020> her<00:04:57.050> jewelry<00:04:57.560> on<00:04:57.680> and<00:04:57.950> stuff<00:04:58.070> like<00:04:58.160> that

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.220 
have her jewelry on and stuff like that

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.250 
have her jewelry on and stuff like that
and<00:04:58.580> then<00:04:59.030> look<00:04:59.480> what<00:04:59.510> it<00:04:59.720> looks<00:04:59.900> like<00:05:00.050> inside

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:00.260 
and then look what it looks like inside

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.430 
and then look what it looks like inside
of<00:05:00.530> her<00:05:00.620> mouth<00:05:00.650> funny<00:05:01.490> and<00:05:02.480> just<00:05:03.110> put<00:05:03.320> the

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 
of her mouth funny and just put the

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.020 
of her mouth funny and just put the
scroll<00:05:03.680> in<00:05:03.800> here<00:05:04.010> and<00:05:04.190> you<00:05:04.280> can<00:05:04.400> just<00:05:04.550> keep<00:05:04.850> it

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
scroll in here and you can just keep it

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:06.520 
scroll in here and you can just keep it
in<00:05:05.120> there<00:05:05.270> if<00:05:05.390> you<00:05:05.510> want<00:05:05.720> but<00:05:06.140> by<00:05:06.320> the<00:05:06.380> way

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:06.530 
in there if you want but by the way

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:11.400 
in there if you want but by the way
here's<00:05:06.770> a<00:05:06.830> button<00:05:07.160> right<00:05:07.520> here<00:05:07.550> on<00:05:07.790> the<00:05:07.880> back

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:11.410 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:13.690 

so<00:05:12.410> you<00:05:12.440> got<00:05:12.770> to<00:05:12.890> make<00:05:13.010> sure<00:05:13.070> you<00:05:13.400> have<00:05:13.580> her

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:13.700 
so you got to make sure you have her

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:15.940 
so you got to make sure you have her
mouth<00:05:13.850> open<00:05:14.090> it<00:05:14.420> can't<00:05:14.660> be<00:05:14.810> closed<00:05:15.110> but<00:05:15.740> if<00:05:15.860> you

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:15.950 
mouth open it can't be closed but if you

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:17.740 
mouth open it can't be closed but if you
do<00:05:16.070> want<00:05:16.250> to<00:05:16.280> keep<00:05:16.430> it<00:05:16.610> safe<00:05:16.850> which<00:05:17.240> I<00:05:17.480> usually

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750 
do want to keep it safe which I usually

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.500 
do want to keep it safe which I usually
lose<00:05:18.530> like<00:05:18.860> little<00:05:19.160> accessories<00:05:19.700> I<00:05:19.880> would

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:20.510 
lose like little accessories I would

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:22.530
