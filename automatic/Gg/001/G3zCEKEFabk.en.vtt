00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:14.210
 Hey, live a new video with yours 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:15.800
 silver jewelery sometimes also forgiven 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.980
 then I have a tip for you 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:23.230
 stay tuned 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:26.900
 you need some alufoil for this salt 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.940
 hot water and axel and then follows 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.340
 already her tip you have to foil all 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.989
 to make the glass respectively in 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.350
 the glass where he is pure in your jewelry 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:38.120
 makes the salt and water what 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.770
 rogue is not allowed to use is here 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.600
 For example, colored jewelry because then 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.489
 the paint peels off or even stops 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:47.540
 pearls by that often at the pearl 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:49.280
 stop the overcoat 5 from falling first 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.170
 you just have to clean the hot water 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.190
 do that with the salt still 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.710
 let absorb 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.930
 then you can do it all with a fork 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.809
 mix or spoon depending on 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.680
 what you have in your hand then or 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:02.680
 daniel has 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.560
 after I distributed that as 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.320
 use royal castle what is actually 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.670
 go there 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.630
 Let us be half an hour you are 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.860
 already effect 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.430
 and then you can do it too 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:21.470
 Out already I have my jewelry now 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.930
 Wait half an hour in that 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.610
 salt here it does not look completely 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.570
 you take that but that is actually too 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.430
 nothing problem 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.039
 take you to the ceiling rinn towel 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.170
 happens to clean day and there you can 

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:35.710
 you then hang up and rock 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.710
 burden 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.410
 that was already so fast 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.450
 can your actual silver clean 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:54.280
 That's why it's on 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.860

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:00.270
