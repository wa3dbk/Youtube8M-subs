oven<00:01:52.979> at<00:01:53.369> 400<00:01:53.939> degrees<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:54.659> i<00:01:54.750> would<00:01:55.020> say<00:01:55.200> mine

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
oven at 400 degrees and i would say mine

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.590 
oven at 400 degrees and i would say mine
stayed<00:01:55.799> in<00:01:55.950> for<00:01:56.159> probably<00:01:56.520> about<00:01:56.670> 20<00:01:57.180> 25

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
stayed in for probably about 20 25

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.870 
stayed in for probably about 20 25
minutes<00:01:58.200> but<00:01:58.860> really<00:01:59.189> what<00:01:59.340> you<00:01:59.460> want<00:01:59.640> to<00:01:59.759> do

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
minutes but really what you want to do

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.550 
minutes but really what you want to do
is<00:02:00.030> just<00:02:00.270> look<00:02:00.479> for<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.810> signs<00:02:01.049> of<00:02:01.290> doneness

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
is just look for the signs of doneness

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.249 
is just look for the signs of doneness
which<00:02:02.009> is<00:02:02.219> some<00:02:03.030> of<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.270> top<00:02:03.509> little<00:02:03.899> piece<00:02:04.110> of

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
which is some of the top little piece of

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.660 
which is some of the top little piece of
spaghetti<00:02:04.560> are<00:02:04.920> going<00:02:05.070> to<00:02:05.130> get<00:02:05.250> a<00:02:05.280> little<00:02:05.430> bit

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
spaghetti are going to get a little bit

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.940 
spaghetti are going to get a little bit
Brown<00:02:06.000> you'll<00:02:06.689> get<00:02:06.810> an<00:02:06.930> overall<00:02:07.229> brown<00:02:07.590> look

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
Brown you'll get an overall brown look

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.710 
Brown you'll get an overall brown look
and<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.610> most<00:02:08.759> important<00:02:09.239> thing<00:02:09.270> is<00:02:09.660> that

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
and the most important thing is that

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.970 
and the most important thing is that
you'll<00:02:10.080> see<00:02:10.349> on<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:10.979> edges<00:02:11.520> that<00:02:12.180> it<00:02:12.360> actually

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
you'll see on the edges that it actually

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.559 
you'll see on the edges that it actually
still<00:02:13.129> bubbling<00:02:13.580> this<00:02:13.790> when<00:02:13.909> i<00:02:13.970> took<00:02:14.030> out<00:02:14.300> of

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
still bubbling this when i took out of

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.059 
still bubbling this when i took out of
the<00:02:14.720> oven<00:02:14.810> but<00:02:15.110> you<00:02:15.200> can<00:02:15.319> see<00:02:15.440> the<00:02:15.560> bubbles<00:02:15.709> are

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
the oven but you can see the bubbles are

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:17.860 
the oven but you can see the bubbles are
still<00:02:16.340> there<00:02:16.459> so<00:02:17.000> what<00:02:17.150> you<00:02:17.239> really<00:02:17.390> want<00:02:17.659> is

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
still there so what you really want is

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.420 
still there so what you really want is
to<00:02:17.900> see<00:02:18.140> the<00:02:18.170> whole<00:02:18.440> thing<00:02:18.500> bubbling<00:02:19.250> and

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
to see the whole thing bubbling and

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.910 
to see the whole thing bubbling and
golden<00:02:19.760> brown<00:02:20.470> next<00:02:21.470> you're<00:02:21.590> just<00:02:21.739> going<00:02:21.860> to

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
golden brown next you're just going to

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.210 
golden brown next you're just going to
take<00:02:22.209> I'm<00:02:23.209> using<00:02:23.480> a<00:02:23.659> spatula<00:02:23.870> to<00:02:24.530> go<00:02:24.680> ahead<00:02:24.799> and

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
take I'm using a spatula to go ahead and

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.119 
take I'm using a spatula to go ahead and
cut<00:02:25.900> you<00:02:26.900> can<00:02:27.170> actually<00:02:27.620> break<00:02:27.769> up<00:02:27.950> the

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:28.129 
cut you can actually break up the

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:29.830 
cut you can actually break up the
spaghetti<00:02:28.370> noodles<00:02:28.970> before<00:02:29.150> you<00:02:29.480> put<00:02:29.660> it<00:02:29.690> in

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
spaghetti noodles before you put it in

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.539 
spaghetti noodles before you put it in
the<00:02:29.959> pasta<00:02:30.349> if<00:02:30.530> you<00:02:30.769> would<00:02:30.980> like<00:02:31.160> it<00:02:31.190> to<00:02:31.430> be<00:02:31.519> a

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:31.549 
the pasta if you would like it to be a

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:33.490 
the pasta if you would like it to be a
little<00:02:31.700> easier<00:02:31.940> to<00:02:32.180> cut<00:02:32.540> I<00:02:32.780> actually<00:02:33.260> think

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
little easier to cut I actually think

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.009 
little easier to cut I actually think
it's<00:02:33.709> quite<00:02:33.830> pretty<00:02:34.129> to<00:02:34.459> serve<00:02:34.640> it<00:02:34.849> as<00:02:35.019> almost

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.019 
it's quite pretty to serve it as almost

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:37.660 
it's quite pretty to serve it as almost
like<00:02:36.260> a<00:02:36.290> pasta<00:02:36.769> dish<00:02:36.950> rather<00:02:37.280> than<00:02:37.610> a

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
like a pasta dish rather than a

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.119 
like a pasta dish rather than a
casserole<00:02:38.209> and<00:02:38.599> so<00:02:39.230> if<00:02:39.379> you<00:02:39.410> do<00:02:39.620> it<00:02:39.739> like<00:02:39.769> that

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:40.129 
casserole and so if you do it like that

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:41.740 
casserole and so if you do it like that
and<00:02:40.400> you<00:02:40.579> just<00:02:40.700> pull<00:02:40.910> it<00:02:41.030> out<00:02:41.150> you'll<00:02:41.299> see<00:02:41.510> that

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
and you just pull it out you'll see that

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.140 
and you just pull it out you'll see that
they're<00:02:42.049> really<00:02:42.829> quite<00:02:43.099> long<00:02:43.430> strands<00:02:44.030> of

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
they're really quite long strands of

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.940 
they're really quite long strands of
spaghetti<00:02:44.239> in<00:02:44.659> it<00:02:44.840> and<00:02:45.019> I<00:02:45.560> think<00:02:45.799> that's

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
spaghetti in it and I think that's

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.350 
spaghetti in it and I think that's
actually<00:02:46.340> prettier<00:02:46.700> but<00:02:46.910> you<00:02:47.060> can<00:02:47.209> do<00:02:47.299> it

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
actually prettier but you can do it

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.390 
actually prettier but you can do it
either<00:02:47.450> way<00:02:47.569> you<00:02:47.720> want<00:02:47.959> and<00:02:48.110> then<00:02:48.950> you<00:02:49.250> just

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
either way you want and then you just

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.860 
either way you want and then you just
want<00:02:49.579> to<00:02:49.670> let<00:02:49.760> it<00:02:49.819> sit<00:02:50.150> for<00:02:50.180> a<00:02:50.420> couple<00:02:50.480> minutes

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
want to let it sit for a couple minutes

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.780 
want to let it sit for a couple minutes
so<00:02:51.230> it<00:02:51.440> can<00:02:51.560> kind<00:02:51.709> of<00:02:51.859> you<00:02:52.099> know<00:02:52.129> gel<00:02:52.579> back

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
so it can kind of you know gel back

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.420 
so it can kind of you know gel back
together<00:02:53.150> and<00:02:53.420> you<00:02:54.049> have<00:02:54.079> chicken<00:02:54.980> mushroom

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
together and you have chicken mushroom

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.550 
together and you have chicken mushroom
bake<00:02:55.640> from<00:02:56.359> jamie<00:02:56.660> oliver<00:02:57.140> and<00:02:57.230> you'll<00:02:57.349> see

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
bake from jamie oliver and you'll see

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.000 
bake from jamie oliver and you'll see
the<00:02:58.310> pam<00:02:59.000> definitely<00:02:59.540> kept<00:02:59.959> all<00:03:00.200> of<00:03:00.319> the<00:03:00.709> cream

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
the pam definitely kept all of the cream

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.069 
the pam definitely kept all of the cream
and<00:03:01.280> cheese<00:03:01.519> from<00:03:02.030> staying<00:03:02.329> on<00:03:02.540> that<00:03:02.569> pyrex

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:03.079 
and cheese from staying on that pyrex

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:04.930 
and cheese from staying on that pyrex
dish<00:03:03.379> so<00:03:03.890> that's<00:03:04.069> an<00:03:04.190> important<00:03:04.609> step<00:03:04.819> to

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
dish so that's an important step to

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.560 
dish so that's an important step to
remember<00:03:05.299> hope<00:03:05.989> you<00:03:06.200> enjoy
