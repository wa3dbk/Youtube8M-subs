00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.509

 show our ball but here it's going to be fucking 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.899
 I think it's good to see let's see how it goes 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.030
 dumped shopping comes to start 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:35.640
 cool 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:37.640
 rained mano does not know that the name was given 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:43.590
 The flipboard I do not know if it has any 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:46.770
 a similar thing some similarity has fallen 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:54.810
 there he sent me to the middle of a 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:57.899
 boss sent focuses on the bread has nothing to 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:01.350
 watch with the flipboard hand crate 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:03.539
 trolling here old or have I think 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.600
 has to see something has to do yes 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:09.720
 old look only the flipboard has to pass 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.180
 by the pipes know and types pipes have some 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.740
 higher in lower now imagine 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.620
 This is where you look from above 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.750
 by helicopter is equal to the flipboard 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.970
 Only hand that shows on 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.780
 the containers have a ladder you 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.480
 pass 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.940
 just look at this party here you're going 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.100
 here or in the middle is this one here too 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.870
 It's but it's from here it's already a little more 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.400
 by the line side is then connected 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.180
 I think it has something to do with 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:38.370
 flash bergman I do not know but we are not going here 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.890
 Our old woman running here is narrow. 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.630
 Send me a ticket and I 'll stop by here 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:46.640
 means that it says peace here in the middle 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:50.730
 I'm going to spend and ball show 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:53.820
 the guys who are distracted by crook 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:56.940
 side but the right is not to divert to divert 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:03:01.140
 by the side not the week that the bagulho 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:03.660
 the law that the guy fell there of ripe 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.880
 I was in third place but I can have 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:09.950
 repeat that a couple of times this short 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.950
 than good and understand the purpose 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:19.080
 I think it's going to be a video a little bit this 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:21.060
 because the black bird is nothing to see 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:24.150
 well I'll go then and by repeteco and already 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:26.400
 let's go back to the crowd then let's go then 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:30.630
 for one more turn and flec kisses and there 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:34.110
 the race without logic without a notion more 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:36.450
 old man I understood the logic of this race 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:40.350
 It is attached before it was not spoken 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:43.530
 you see in a panoramic way right? 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:49.110
 A sight from above you're on 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:52.050
 that one thing is a similarity is only 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:55.920
 the pac nano style even printed here 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:57.030
 I want to win your turn here in good parana 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:05.970
 Marotta here 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:08.340
 show ball but once again when 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.020
 I'll finish from here just to see you there 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.800
 How's the layout let them go? 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.800
 before donor 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:21.270
 in fact the containers there are wider 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:24.810
 so it's easier, you're going already 

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:27.120
 here but at the end of the race he finishes 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:29.400
 getting very little space 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:33.750
 there and you are almost squeezed that at 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:36.360
 Damn it, just send it here, you pass. 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:42.780
 screwing you know how to get the 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:46.470
 checkpoint took good chance I will manolo 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:51.180
 to cheat here but have already passed 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:53.160
 for me to win here ball show 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.780
 I had to do the active in the middle 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:57.780
 here I do not give a damn because in between 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:05:02.520
 Ball show and it will already end me 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:03.510
 I think by the way of rain and to equip the magnet 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.910
 dolo 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:08.280
 we finished first and this time it was 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:09.660
 one minute and twenty I'll say it again 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:13.620
 once the race here to stay a 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:16.680
 little longer because otherwise it is very 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:18.150
 short and can not admit the best 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.250
 and look, the guys are watching 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:22.530
 Until this moment the race do not forget 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:25.169
 to leave its limit and is equal to our 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:27.419
 mascot he pro speak hand 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:30.930
