 is there any notebook with the most 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.570
 female not so coarse and then I 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.600
 gave a click here an opportunity to 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:53.630
 talk that old all all notebooks 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.170

 that is you can choose there you can 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.580
 do your own way has the 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.920
 notebooks are thinner with the 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.780
 backlit keyboard you can change the 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.610

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:39.010
 way of answering the following 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:42.340
 every veil of notebooks comes with 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:45.430
 nvidia geforce board is a partnership 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.800

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:50.680
 Machine for machine varies the model but 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:53.380
 all havel notebooks come with the board 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.780
 nvidia geforce and has a differential 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.970

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:03.760
