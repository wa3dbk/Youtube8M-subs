there's<00:01:12.270> really<00:01:12.510> no<00:01:12.960> specific<00:01:13.710> way<00:01:13.860> that<00:01:13.890> you

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
there's really no specific way that you

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.160 
there's really no specific way that you
have<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:14.640> do<00:01:14.850> this<00:01:15.060> I<00:01:15.330> know<00:01:15.659> if<00:01:15.930> you<00:01:16.049> have

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
have to do this I know if you have

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.830 
have to do this I know if you have
shorter<00:01:16.680> hair<00:01:16.710> you<00:01:17.580> can<00:01:17.880> twist<00:01:18.299> it<00:01:18.540> with<00:01:18.780> a

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
shorter hair you can twist it with a

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.289 
shorter hair you can twist it with a
slightly<00:01:19.409> different<00:01:19.740> technique<00:01:20.189> but<00:01:20.939> for<00:01:20.970> me

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
slightly different technique but for me

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.359 
slightly different technique but for me
since<00:01:21.600> my<00:01:21.720> hair<00:01:21.990> is<00:01:22.080> really<00:01:22.320> long<00:01:22.470> I'm<00:01:23.310> just

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
using my hands and kind of doing it kind

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.850 
using my hands and kind of doing it kind
of<00:01:26.490> messy<00:01:26.970> this<00:01:27.780> is<00:01:27.930> a<00:01:27.960> style<00:01:28.320> that<00:01:28.409> you<00:01:28.680> can

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
of messy this is a style that you can

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.819 
of messy this is a style that you can
really<00:01:29.070> just<00:01:29.400> gauge<00:01:29.640> by<00:01:30.000> just<00:01:30.869> pulling<00:01:31.170> pieces

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
really just gauge by just pulling pieces

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.550 
really just gauge by just pulling pieces
of<00:01:31.979> hair<00:01:32.390> keeping<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.540> portions<00:01:34.049> really

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
of hair keeping the portions really

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.640 
of hair keeping the portions really
small<00:01:35.100> so<00:01:36.060> you<00:01:36.180> can<00:01:36.210> twirl<00:01:36.659> and<00:01:36.960> make<00:01:37.170> small
