00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 this tree is over 80 meters high 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.629
 one wonders how honestly 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.899
 the water comes from uprooting to the 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.899
 scroll 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:17.730
 this video is sponsored by for you 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.470
 check out the links in the left 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.359
 video description so that the whole 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.689
 It works two tricks 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.980
 firstly, the capillary effect 2 is used 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.050
 the under pressure of the 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.269
 evaporation on the leaves arises 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.859
 now we first explain under the 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.840
 pressure on the underside of the leaves 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.300
 there are small openings 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.829
 so-called pores the sun ensures 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.370
 that the water in the leaves 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.090
 evaporated and exits the pores 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.850
 Water molecules possess the ability 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.950
 to attract each other so 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.410
 a molecule pulled up pulls it 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.360
 more molecules with high in the 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.789
 So evaporation will be some molecules 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.039
 pulled out of the country and the 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.079
 then draw more water molecules 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.629
 So it creates a negative pressure of 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.030
 water is conveyed to the leaves 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.830
 So the water from the ground first in 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.479
 the roots and then into the pipe systems 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.010
 pulled in the plant 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.200
 finally it gets to the 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.000
 Scroll where it evaporates again and the 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.100
 maintains pressure under pressure if you 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.030
 water with nem stroheim drinking happens 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.619
 exactly the same 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.450
 This time, however, the under pressure arises 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.759
 not by evaporation but by 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.009
 you because yes in the stream because that pulls 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.900
 putting molecules on each other comes like that 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.030
 long water after previously under pressure 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.110
 dissolves until you stop at 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.700
 to draw electricity 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.710
 the water pipes in the plants 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.750
 So basically work as a whole 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.970
 thin straws and what happens when 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.220
 a straw that dips the water 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.470
 Water flows up this phenomenon 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.540
 is called capital effect and will 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.369
 also used by the plants 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.540
 to move the water upwards and 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.890
 you have no plan like that 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.570
 should work then look at you 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.490
 be sure to download this video from the simple 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.829
 physics sun there is the capillary 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.600
 explained in detail and you understand the 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.159
 second trick with the plants kicking 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.540
 You can also subscribe 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.799
 our physics channel 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.540
 what else do you have for interesting 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.369
 ask from nature writes in the 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.649
 comments here you will find an answer 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.369
 on it so pure skin loads abu dhabis 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.369
 then and ciao
