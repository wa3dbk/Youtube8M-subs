00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:05.020
 well now let's get to know iller modelle more closely 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.429
 before the generator the thing I noticed 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:09.929
 we take a test for 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.509
 to measure the ph level 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.680
 we see here a map with different different colors we have put 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.039
 above does not make a mark and here we have very well known waters throughout the series 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:26.130
 on the Italian market we start with adding a small amount of 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:26.930
 water 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:27.880
 ferrarelle 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.649
 for example 

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:32.260
 in this 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.380
 small container we do the same thing with the 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.140
 blue spool brio 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.970
 this mark also makes its debut very well known 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.970
 in italy we have the 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.730
 rocchetta -.- virgilio simplicity maps 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.920
 we use so trackback 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.930
 even to people who know how to measure the ph level we see how they color 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.710
 these waters we just have 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.460
 added 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.890
 just a simple dough 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.940
 why they take 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.000
 different colors my house best &amp; lt together 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.000
 the ferrarelle 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.980
 at the yellowish color we are not on levels four and a half 5d 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.980
 acidity 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.580
 here we have bobbin radioblu 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.210
 we are quite on the orange so top strength should be 4 the best 5 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.300
 just press have just been so it's normal to have delivery assistant 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.610
 higher this is the bobbin 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.760
 what a laugh to say 7 7 and a half 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.840
 let's get some water out of our cartoonist 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.340
 those of application generators that is connected to home faucet with 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.469
 a very simple bypass and that's it 

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:55.980
 just be able to change at any time then 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:57.100
 din 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.100
 here too the minimum content 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.039
 and let's hope we do what 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:06.749
 how our tap water is colored by aqueduct water 

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:12.539
 here too a crazy employee we are here on samo levels 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.479
 d neutralizing uses 7 

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:18.449
 how to live on dishes 

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:22.059
 now start the string generator application generator 

00:02:24.139 --> 00:02:25.789
 what 

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:29.249
 how the water coming out of our apparatus is colored 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:33.049
 through our post processes 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:38.260
 schools closed a display that changes live there are various levels of 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.169
 activity 

00:02:39.169 --> 00:02:41.880
 we can generate alkaline water levels 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.359
 dawn levels that level 1 level 2 level 3 level 4 

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:51.089
 now we are waiting for a small level of caterine water level 4 

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:55.379
 as you see we have level of rt - 3 80 we have one 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:00.019
 % direct measurement even of the fire brigade is associated with the minute then 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:04.420
 think an apparatus where there are no preset data go see that live 

00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:05.050
 thing 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:10.000
 it comes out as the level is in the square hdr modified files live 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.599
 here too we take a small one 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:12.690
 amount of milk 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.519
 we do exactly the same 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:17.619
 the same thing we have the same procedure 

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:20.619
 just a simple ride 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:22.969
 here I'm 

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:24.400
 we come who we are 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.670
 obviously on xd hd levels ita we are 9 and a half 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:34.069
 pendant adsl I saw in states what corresponds with display 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:36.019
 now 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:38.209
 accio do 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:40.710
 another operation because 

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:42.039
 this apparatus 

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:47.019
 or even at a parasitic cost, it means super acid alkaline 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:52.989
 meliga located two. two. 5 two point two is at fierce levels 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:54.629
 11, 5 

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:55.869
 clearly 

00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:57.359
 there is in this 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:01.709
 you have to do an operation to generate water exceeded your cartagena like 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:05.019
 see at the top hello a tray 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:07.499
 with a determined 

00:04:07.499 --> 00:04:10.979
 contained here we have a container 

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:11.939
 empty 

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:15.030
 no need to add anything no chemical compound 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.169
 it is blue 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:19.290
 possibly this container can be inserted 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:22.410
 it is present of calcium present minerals because you should have 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:27.030
 problematic I bring you paros greece clay our beloved our car 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.370
 works without the need for any kind of activity 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.620
 tonight I want to see reality exceeds city 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.039
 oh super arcadia we take 

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:35.139
 container 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:37.539
 which has the part of the electrodes 

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:41.169
 inside we insert here you can see inside we insert some salts 

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:44.069
 very simple salt 

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:47.349
 possibly large sodium chloride 

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:51.389
 lot we are going to insert inside so this mattress is very simple 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:54.379
 recipe can do in case you need support for 

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:55.139
 sour 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:56.370
 post-operative 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.370
 and we operate 

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:02.999
 in this case the lookout 

00:05:02.999 --> 00:05:05.999
 singing sound machines 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:11.160
 greenhouse precisely to warn that you are generating an apartment in mind with a 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.160
 stem too high too we see live 

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:20.279
 206 207 modification live from. 5 

00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:24.569
 reverso display css to see what level we are app trp 

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:28.999
 520 then 

00:05:28.999 --> 00:05:33.319
 in the very performance to your heart of these cooperative jet skiers 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:38.330
 at the same time, then water exits fedina vasquez 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.639
 tap and water pass us task speed metal 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:46.169
 drainpipe 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:47.809
 now 

00:05:47.809 --> 00:05:49.460
 Let's check 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:51.610
 another test help 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:53.639
 in the meantime 

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:56.550
 replace 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:01.139
 containers because we don't need any addition via repeats for 

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:04.729
 making it work is like a head ought to let me see to make you understand 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:08.330
 where we can go with the square levels opens 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:13.759
 acid and alkaline now we go to make a test tube of our usual bergamo 

00:06:13.759 --> 00:06:15.089
 normal 

00:06:15.089 --> 00:06:16.270
 container 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:19.270
 blue we are in hell 

00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:23.809
 think of a glass a simple glass of water 

00:06:23.809 --> 00:06:26.759
 wait up 

00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:30.490
 we are how effectively our water is an energy appliance 

00:06:32.199 --> 00:06:33.960
 now we wait 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.680
 a few minutes to set it up successfully 

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:39.680
 a few seconds is enough for a few seconds 

00:06:44.219 --> 00:06:48.929
 let's go and set it up, say, happiness at the penis that level 4 

00:06:50.149 --> 00:06:52.069
 i liked @youtube 

00:06:52.069 --> 00:06:55.990
 our structure wanted to use to be able to improve. 

00:06:57.149 --> 00:06:58.839
 ii degree d 

00:06:58.839 --> 00:07:00.249
 energy that 

00:07:00.249 --> 00:07:04.249
 is contained within a glass of tonic water we define it to those 

00:07:04.249 --> 00:07:05.349
 present ita 

00:07:05.349 --> 00:07:08.300
 find out immediately why 

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:10.399
 this very simple tool 

00:07:10.399 --> 00:07:12.449
 cheryl was. 

00:07:12.449 --> 00:07:15.580
 song that very important 

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:18.610
 what a dilemma. the presence of our pordenone energy 

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:22.189
 a light comes on 

00:07:22.189 --> 00:07:24.150
 we remove it from the water it turns off 

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:27.150
 we put it back in the water it lights up 

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:29.540
 water 

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:31.520
 electro-energetic cationic
