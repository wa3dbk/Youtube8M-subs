00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.410 
but the Moto X and the Moto G did not
support<00:03:24.760> micro<00:03:25.150> sd<00:03:25.480> so<00:03:26.380> anyway<00:03:27.000> that's<00:03:28.000> it<00:03:28.239> to

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
support micro sd so anyway that's it to

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.180 
support micro sd so anyway that's it to
set<00:03:28.630> up<00:03:28.750> here<00:03:28.930> so<00:03:31.140> there<00:03:32.140> you<00:03:32.230> go<00:03:32.410> that's<00:03:32.980> the

brightness<00:03:35.739> right<00:03:40.560> enough<00:03:41.560> I<00:03:41.860> guess<00:03:42.720> so

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
brightness right enough I guess so

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.610 
brightness right enough I guess so
everything<00:03:44.410> looks<00:03:44.800> and<00:03:45.010> looks<00:03:45.610> crisp<00:03:46.230> 256<00:03:47.230> BP

a motor email or the Galaxy Note 2 so

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:57.780 
a motor email or the Galaxy Note 2 so
that's<00:03:53.890> not<00:03:54.160> bad<00:03:54.430> and<00:03:55.230> the<00:03:56.230> UI<00:03:56.380> is<00:03:56.530> almost<00:03:57.489> dark
