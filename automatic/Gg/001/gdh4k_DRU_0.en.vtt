00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:10.410
 hello to all of you it's steven 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.000
 and today I'm going to show you 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.700
 how to place the kiosk in a 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.490
 record so that you are seals and if 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.150
 under ios5 it works and all without 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.730
 jailbreak 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.020
 the kiosk is this icon here that 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.119
 used to read newspapers and 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.580
 magazines directly on his device 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.710
 she is native and normally he is 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.750
 impossible to put it in a folder 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.550
 so it can be annoying if like me 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.160
 for example you do not use it 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.440
 at all now there is a trick 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.360
 for that we will use this software which 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.910
 is called steefel stands and who is going 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.440
 to hide the kiosk in the 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.840
 description of the video you have a 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.059
 download link for mac and there 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.489
 will soon have another one for windows there 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.559
 just have to wait a few days so 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.059
 on the software page you see we 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.620
 tells us that it will allow to place 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.320
 the kiosk in a folder 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.210
 all without jailbreak so you can 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.670
 like me for example use it on 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.379
 your iphone 5 before you can 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.150
 continue the procedure we are told 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.100
 that we have to connect our device to our 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.590
 computer using usb dock cable 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.119
 so like me do you do it yourself 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.189
 take your cable and connect your 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.930
 iphone ipod touch or ipad to your 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.549
 computer it works for all three 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.780
 appliances 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:20.490
 once it's done steefel 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.470
 known standards our device as 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.750
 being connected to the computer it's 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.490
 perfect we will be able to continue there 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.799
 now just click on hyde 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.079
 newstand to place the kiosk in a 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.600
 folder automatically with the help of 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.759
 software so look closely at what's going on 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.079
 pass 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:39.030
 here you can see that the kiosk has 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.490
 gone it is replaced by a folder 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.110
 which is called magic so the kiosk is 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.540
 found inside this folder we 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.009
 can go check out this is the booth 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.329
 he is now inside a 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.640
 folder things that were normally 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.960
 impossible 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.490
 then you can for example take 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.920
 an application the break and at 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.899
 inside the folder and this one you 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.149
 can also the renamed wanted to give the 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.920
 name that you fancy you see it 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.810
 therefore acts exactly the same way 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.670
 that a classic folder you can 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.649
 also take it move on your 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.280
 springboard the page change by 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.440
 example 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.120
 so that's how this works 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.190
 technique if you do not use the 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.690
 kiosk and well you 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.240
 and like that the hiding in the bottom of a 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.670
 folder something else if you press 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.800
 the kiosk icon like this this is it 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.390
 is happening your springboard getting 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.780
 stimulus where you end up on the 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.970
 lockscreen 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.490
 and of course the kiosk the rest in the 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.380
 folder so here you can place 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:32.540
 your kiosk in a folder without 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:36.230
 jailbreak on your iphone ipod touch or 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.520
 ipad under ios 5 and ayew s6 tell me via
