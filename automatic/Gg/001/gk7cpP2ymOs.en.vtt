what<00:00:02.399> is<00:00:02.610> this<00:00:03.200> well<00:00:04.200> once<00:00:04.920> again<00:00:05.100> if<00:00:05.730> we<00:00:06.000> go<00:00:06.180> to

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
what is this well once again if we go to

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.560 
what is this well once again if we go to
this<00:00:06.569> area<00:00:06.810> here<00:00:07.370> we<00:00:08.370> could<00:00:08.550> quickly<00:00:08.880> see<00:00:09.330> that

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
this area here we could quickly see that

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.190 
this area here we could quickly see that
it<00:00:10.110> is<00:00:10.380> cardiac<00:00:11.340> muscle<00:00:11.969> for<00:00:12.690> all<00:00:12.840> the<00:00:13.019> right

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
it is cardiac muscle for all the right

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.820 
it is cardiac muscle for all the right
reasons<00:00:13.940> the<00:00:14.940> muscle<00:00:15.360> fibers<00:00:15.809> have<00:00:16.109> centrally

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
reasons the muscle fibers have centrally

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:24.019 
reasons the muscle fibers have centrally
located<00:00:17.460> nuclei<00:00:21.260> they<00:00:22.340> have<00:00:23.340> branching

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
located nuclei they have branching

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.210 
located nuclei they have branching
between<00:00:24.420> other<00:00:24.750> fibers<00:00:25.320> and<00:00:25.560> I<00:00:25.830> wish<00:00:26.039> I<00:00:26.189> could

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
between other fibers and I wish I could

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.640 
between other fibers and I wish I could
show<00:00:26.580> you<00:00:26.640> some<00:00:27.000> striations<00:00:27.750> perhaps<00:00:28.349> these

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
show you some striations perhaps these

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.669 
show you some striations perhaps these
are<00:00:28.710> some<00:00:29.160> striations<00:00:30.019> so<00:00:31.019> that's<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.529> easy

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
are some striations so that's the easy

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.580 
are some striations so that's the easy
part<00:00:32.300> but<00:00:33.300> that's<00:00:33.540> probably<00:00:33.750> not<00:00:33.989> what<00:00:34.380> we're

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
part but that's probably not what we're

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.700 
part but that's probably not what we're
really<00:00:34.800> looking<00:00:35.040> for<00:00:35.520> isn't<00:00:35.880> it<00:00:36.059> if<00:00:36.750> this<00:00:37.440> was

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
really looking for isn't it if this was

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.510 
really looking for isn't it if this was
my<00:00:38.309> car<00:00:38.969> diem<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.480> this<00:00:39.899> was<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.520> endocardial

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
my car diem and this was the endocardial

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.290 
my car diem and this was the endocardial
surface<00:00:42.030> you<00:00:42.960> might<00:00:43.230> suspect<00:00:43.739> that<00:00:44.190> this<00:00:44.670> long

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
surface you might suspect that this long

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.860 
surface you might suspect that this long
fibrous<00:00:45.899> like<00:00:46.410> extension<00:00:47.160> of<00:00:47.870> endocardium

fibrous like extension of endocardium

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.860 
fibrous like extension of endocardium
could<00:00:49.559> be<00:00:49.710> a<00:00:49.739> valve<00:00:50.329> because<00:00:51.329> nothing<00:00:51.719> else

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
could be a valve because nothing else

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.350 
could be a valve because nothing else
extends<00:00:52.500> from<00:00:52.739> endocardium<00:00:53.730> of<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.149> heart

except<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.440> valves<00:00:55.829> this<00:00:56.399> is<00:00:56.579> an<00:00:56.670> aortic

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
except the valves this is an aortic

valve or a semilunar valve notice how it

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.100 
valve or a semilunar valve notice how it
is<00:01:00.899> very<00:01:01.350> very<00:01:01.710> thickened<00:01:02.430> not<00:01:03.300> only<00:01:03.629> is<00:01:03.870> it

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
is very very thickened not only is it

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.370 
is very very thickened not only is it
thickened<00:01:04.619> but<00:01:05.369> it<00:01:05.489> has<00:01:05.790> clusters<00:01:06.659> of<00:01:06.990> this

blue<00:01:07.770> stuff<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.490> this<00:01:08.790> pink<00:01:09.090> stuff<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:10.040> all

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
blue stuff and this pink stuff and all

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.750 
blue stuff and this pink stuff and all
of<00:01:11.100> these<00:01:11.850> cells<00:01:12.180> in<00:01:12.479> here<00:01:12.780> as<00:01:13.049> well<00:01:13.460> now<00:01:14.460> when

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
of these cells in here as well now when

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.820 
of these cells in here as well now when
you<00:01:14.790> see<00:01:15.090> blue<00:01:15.420> pink<00:01:15.689> and<00:01:15.840> cells<00:01:16.140> instantly

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
you see blue pink and cells instantly

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.630 
you see blue pink and cells instantly
think<00:01:17.430> of<00:01:18.229> bacterial<00:01:19.369> fibrin<00:01:20.369> and

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
think of bacterial fibrin and

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.469 
think of bacterial fibrin and
neutrophils<00:01:21.330> instantly<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.799> if<00:01:23.340> you<00:01:23.460> do<00:01:23.640> you

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
neutrophils instantly and if you do you

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.200 
neutrophils instantly and if you do you
think<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:24.990> right<00:01:25.170> because<00:01:26.000> here<00:01:27.000> are

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
think and right because here are

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.929 
think and right because here are
neutrophils

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:28.939 
neutrophils

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:33.830 
neutrophils
here's<00:01:29.939> fibrin<00:01:30.689> and<00:01:31.460> the<00:01:32.460> blue<00:01:32.759> stuff<00:01:33.060> you<00:01:33.630> may

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
here's fibrin and the blue stuff you may

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.690 
here's fibrin and the blue stuff you may
have<00:01:34.020> to<00:01:34.170> take<00:01:34.380> it<00:01:34.530> on<00:01:34.650> faith<00:01:35.009> rather<00:01:35.430> than

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
have to take it on faith rather than

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.719 
have to take it on faith rather than
being<00:01:35.970> little<00:01:36.329> areas<00:01:36.720> of<00:01:36.900> calcium<00:01:37.470> often<00:01:38.369> blue

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
being little areas of calcium often blue

with vegetations like you saw on the
valve<00:02:41.549> but<00:02:42.269> probably<00:02:42.629> degenerated<00:02:43.530> due<00:02:44.040> to

00:02:44.149 --> 00:02:44.159 
valve but probably degenerated due to

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:47.409 
valve but probably degenerated due to
atherosclerosis<00:02:45.379> here's<00:02:46.379> some<00:02:46.650> sub

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:47.419 
atherosclerosis here's some sub

00:02:47.419 --> 00:02:50.770 
atherosclerosis here's some sub
endocardial<00:02:48.419> fat<00:02:48.720> and<00:02:49.200> here<00:02:50.099> is<00:02:50.310> some<00:02:50.579> more

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
endocardial fat and here is some more

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.990 
endocardial fat and here is some more
myocardium<00:02:51.780> which<00:02:52.590> actually<00:02:53.159> doesn't<00:02:53.760> look

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
myocardium which actually doesn't look

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.190 
myocardium which actually doesn't look
too<00:02:54.659> bad

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
too bad

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.809 
too bad
and<00:02:55.409> if<00:02:55.650> you<00:02:55.769> want<00:02:55.919> to<00:02:56.010> go<00:02:56.129> back<00:02:56.340> later<00:02:56.639> and
