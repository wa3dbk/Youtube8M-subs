00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
we are going to break down a sixteenth

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.120 
we are going to break down a sixteenth
note<00:00:11.610> linear<00:00:12.179> pattern<00:00:12.690> so<00:00:13.019> let's<00:00:13.769> get<00:00:13.950> started

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
note linear pattern so let's get started

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.480 
note linear pattern so let's get started
by<00:00:14.549> showing<00:00:14.940> you<00:00:15.030> the<00:00:15.150> pattern<00:00:16.130> first<00:00:17.130> we're

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
by showing you the pattern first we're

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.099 
by showing you the pattern first we're
going<00:00:17.580> to<00:00:17.640> break<00:00:17.850> this<00:00:18.060> down<00:00:18.330> just<00:00:18.690> on<00:00:18.930> the

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
going to break this down just on the

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.640 
going to break this down just on the
snare<00:00:19.410> drum<00:00:19.770> and<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.039> bass<00:00:20.550> drum<00:00:20.939> so<00:00:21.650> the

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
snare drum and the bass drum so the

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.200 
snare drum and the bass drum so the
pattern<00:00:23.189> is<00:00:23.400> right<00:00:24.029> left<00:00:24.689> kick<00:00:25.439> kick<00:00:26.210> right

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
pattern is right left kick kick right

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.540 
pattern is right left kick kick right

kick right left so you're going to want

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.940 
kick right left so you're going to want
to<00:00:35.309> learn<00:00:35.430> that<00:00:35.489> very<00:00:36.180> very<00:00:36.719> slow<00:00:37.200> on<00:00:37.500> your

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
to learn that very very slow on your

to learn that very very slow on your
snare<00:00:38.370> drum<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:38.879> your<00:00:39.090> bass<00:00:39.270> drum<00:00:39.300> first<00:00:39.870> so

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:52.879 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:55.639 

now<00:00:53.879> once<00:00:54.300> you're<00:00:54.510> comfortable<00:00:54.870> with<00:00:55.260> that

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
now once you're comfortable with that

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.380 
now once you're comfortable with that
pattern<00:00:56.010> then<00:00:56.760> you're<00:00:56.910> going<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.090> start

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
pattern then you're going to start

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.330 
pattern then you're going to start
moving<00:00:57.809> it<00:00:57.930> around<00:00:58.020> so<00:00:58.530> let<00:00:58.739> me<00:00:58.859> show<00:00:59.039> you<00:00:59.070> what

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
moving it around so let me show you what

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:26.700 
moving it around so let me show you what
that's<00:00:59.489> going<00:00:59.789> to<00:00:59.879> be<00:01:00.000> like

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.139 

now<00:01:27.710> once<00:01:28.100> you're<00:01:28.310> comfortable<00:01:28.490> with<00:01:28.880> the

00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:29.149 
now once you're comfortable with the

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:31.510 
now once you're comfortable with the
pattern<00:01:29.540> let's<00:01:29.869> start<00:01:30.049> actually<00:01:30.470> using<00:01:31.250> it<00:01:31.340> as

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
pattern let's start actually using it as

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.240 
pattern let's start actually using it as
a<00:01:31.549> fill<00:01:32.000> so<00:01:32.360> in<00:01:32.509> this<00:01:32.630> next<00:01:32.960> example<00:01:33.170> I'm<00:01:33.860> going

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
a fill so in this next example I'm going

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.100 
a fill so in this next example I'm going
to<00:01:34.490> play<00:01:34.640> an<00:01:34.789> eighth<00:01:35.060> note<00:01:35.090> group<00:01:35.689> and<00:01:35.990> I'm

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
to play an eighth note group and I'm

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:37.749 
to play an eighth note group and I'm
going<00:01:36.320> to<00:01:36.350> split<00:01:36.649> this<00:01:36.860> pattern<00:01:37.340> into

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
going to split this pattern into

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:39.940 
going to split this pattern into
sixteenth<00:01:38.390> notes<00:01:38.659> and<00:01:38.899> use<00:01:39.170> it<00:01:39.320> as<00:01:39.500> a<00:01:39.530> drum

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
sixteenth notes and use it as a drum

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.490 
sixteenth notes and use it as a drum
fill<00:01:40.189> so<00:01:40.850> i'll<00:01:41.000> be<00:01:41.149> playing<00:01:41.390> time<00:01:41.750> and<00:01:42.080> then

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
fill so i'll be playing time and then

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.410 
fill so i'll be playing time and then
i'll<00:01:42.619> be<00:01:42.740> using<00:01:42.920> the<00:01:43.130> pattern<00:01:43.490> as<00:01:43.670> a<00:01:43.759> drum<00:01:44.179> fill

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
i'll be using the pattern as a drum fill

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.260 
i'll be using the pattern as a drum fill
across<00:01:44.659> the<00:01:45.110> kit<00:01:45.350> i'll<00:01:46.009> count<00:01:46.250> it<00:01:46.429> off<00:01:46.580> and<00:01:46.880> if

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
across the kit i'll count it off and if

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.149 
across the kit i'll count it off and if
i<00:01:47.390> play<00:01:47.630> a<00:01:47.659> different<00:01:47.899> tempo<00:01:48.409> I'll<00:01:48.649> stop<00:01:48.979> and

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
i play a different tempo I'll stop and

00:01:49.159 --> 00:02:50.699 
i play a different tempo I'll stop and
recount<00:01:49.759> it<00:01:49.880> off

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:53.470 

when<00:02:51.709> you're<00:02:51.890> comfortable<00:02:52.370> with<00:02:52.459> that<00:02:52.760> let's

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
when you're comfortable with that let's

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.780 
when you're comfortable with that let's
take<00:02:53.810> this<00:02:54.079> even<00:02:54.349> further<00:02:54.470> let's<00:02:55.159> use<00:02:55.519> the

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
take this even further let's use the

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.960 
take this even further let's use the
pattern<00:02:56.209> as<00:02:56.590> thirty-second<00:02:57.590> notes<00:02:57.650> in<00:02:58.190> this

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
pattern as thirty-second notes in this

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.539 
pattern as thirty-second notes in this
next<00:02:59.329> example<00:02:59.569> I'm<00:03:00.230> going<00:03:00.440> to<00:03:00.530> play<00:03:00.769> 16th

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:01.549 
next example I'm going to play 16th

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:03.460 
next example I'm going to play 16th
notes<00:03:01.849> on<00:03:02.120> the<00:03:02.239> high<00:03:02.420> hat<00:03:02.450> or<00:03:02.959> just<00:03:03.349> a

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
notes on the high hat or just a

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.770 
notes on the high hat or just a
sixteenth<00:03:04.010> note<00:03:04.220> type<00:03:04.489> of<00:03:04.640> group<00:03:04.909> and<00:03:05.690> I'm

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
sixteenth note type of group and I'm

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.630 
sixteenth note type of group and I'm
going<00:03:05.989> to<00:03:06.079> split<00:03:06.409> this<00:03:06.650> pattern<00:03:07.159> into

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
going to split this pattern into

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.479 
going to split this pattern into
thirty-second<00:03:08.510> notes<00:03:08.540> and<00:03:09.160> what's<00:03:10.160> going<00:03:10.430> to

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
thirty-second notes and what's going to

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:13.059 
thirty-second notes and what's going to
happen<00:03:10.849> is<00:03:11.030> in<00:03:11.299> order<00:03:11.569> to<00:03:11.900> play<00:03:12.140> one<00:03:12.530> complete

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:13.069 
happen is in order to play one complete

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:15.160 
happen is in order to play one complete
full<00:03:13.430> bar<00:03:13.730> I'm<00:03:14.090> going<00:03:14.329> to<00:03:14.390> cycle<00:03:14.840> through<00:03:14.870> the

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
full bar I'm going to cycle through the

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.300 
full bar I'm going to cycle through the
pattern<00:03:15.530> twice<00:03:16.060> so<00:03:17.500> keep<00:03:18.500> this<00:03:18.680> in<00:03:18.739> mind<00:03:18.920> when

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
pattern twice so keep this in mind when

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:20.979 
pattern twice so keep this in mind when
