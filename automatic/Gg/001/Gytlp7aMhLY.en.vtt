piece<00:01:46.929> and<00:01:47.289> I'm<00:01:48.100> connecting<00:01:48.729> it<00:01:48.880> with<00:01:49.000> the

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 
piece and I'm connecting it with the

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:51.749 
piece and I'm connecting it with the
underneath<00:01:49.689> hair<00:01:50.020> see<00:01:50.770> how<00:01:50.860> I<00:01:50.890> just<00:01:51.039> connected

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:51.759 
underneath hair see how I just connected

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:55.710 
underneath hair see how I just connected

00:01:57.449 --> 00:01:57.459 
called the technique it's sort of like a

00:01:57.459 --> 00:02:00.570 
called the technique it's sort of like a
French<00:01:57.909> braid<00:01:58.240> but<00:01:58.619> now<00:01:59.619> I'm<00:01:59.950> in<00:02:00.189> the<00:02:00.280> front
