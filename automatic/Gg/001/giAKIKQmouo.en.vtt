in<00:00:19.730> 1989<00:00:20.730> I<00:00:21.150> graduated<00:00:21.840> from<00:00:22.080> high<00:00:22.230> school<00:00:22.260> and

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:23.119 
in 1989 I graduated from high school and

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:25.040 
in 1989 I graduated from high school and
for<00:00:24.119> the<00:00:24.210> most<00:00:24.330> part<00:00:24.390> I<00:00:24.570> was<00:00:24.689> doing<00:00:24.900> really

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
for the most part I was doing really

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.769 
for the most part I was doing really
well<00:00:25.260> in<00:00:25.320> school<00:00:25.820> but<00:00:26.820> I<00:00:27.060> had<00:00:27.240> this<00:00:27.359> special

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
well in school but I had this special

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.359 
well in school but I had this special
class<00:00:28.080> that<00:00:28.349> I<00:00:28.380> took<00:00:28.470> that<00:00:28.859> was<00:00:28.980> a<00:00:29.099> little<00:00:29.279> bit

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
class that I took that was a little bit

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.130 
class that I took that was a little bit
longer<00:00:29.609> than<00:00:29.849> most<00:00:30.060> and<00:00:30.720> it<00:00:30.810> was<00:00:30.900> all<00:00:31.050> about

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
longer than most and it was all about

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.740 
longer than most and it was all about
electronics<00:00:31.470> and<00:00:32.130> you<00:00:32.700> know<00:00:33.360> I've<00:00:33.510> always

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
electronics and you know I've always

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.479 
electronics and you know I've always
been<00:00:33.870> into<00:00:34.110> computers<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:34.770> so<00:00:34.920> I<00:00:35.160> kind<00:00:35.430> of

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
been into computers and so I kind of

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.280 
been into computers and so I kind of
expected<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.090> just<00:00:36.270> sort<00:00:36.390> of<00:00:36.480> Ace<00:00:36.690> this<00:00:36.719> class

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
expected to just sort of Ace this class

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.709 
expected to just sort of Ace this class
but<00:00:37.620> it<00:00:37.739> was<00:00:37.890> way<00:00:38.489> more<00:00:38.520> physical<00:00:39.180> and<00:00:39.480> way

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
but it was way more physical and way

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.360 
but it was way more physical and way
more<00:00:39.750> just<00:00:40.260> kind<00:00:40.379> of<00:00:40.469> distracting<00:00:41.160> than<00:00:41.250> I

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
more just kind of distracting than I

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.479 
more just kind of distracting than I
ever<00:00:41.489> expected<00:00:42.090> and<00:00:42.440> so<00:00:43.440> despite<00:00:43.710> doing

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
ever expected and so despite doing

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:45.950 
ever expected and so despite doing
fairly<00:00:44.789> well<00:00:44.940> in<00:00:45.239> school

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
fairly well in school

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.600
