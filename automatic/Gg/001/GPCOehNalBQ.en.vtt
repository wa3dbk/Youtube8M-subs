00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.819
 hello then today I'm coming back 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.790
 with a vanilla ice cream recipe 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:11.820
 banana base which is a recipe that 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.490
 is very common in the middle of frij 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:18.390
 ivory sme crudivorism is also 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:22.619
 weygand so to make this recipe there 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:25.439
 need two banana bananas 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:28.230
 frozen a little bit of 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.789
 vanilla and optional coconut sugar 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.329
 for those who still love when it's 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.710
 very sweet and of course invites mx here 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:39.329
 I'll show you how I 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.680
 then realize first I'm going to take 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.290
 fresh bananas 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.739
 so they are not freezing good I 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.950
 will put in the blender 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:48.950
 I'm going to start 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:24.890
 and then I have why I 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.690
 integrates little by little because if I 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.700
 the beloved while at the same time the blender is going 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.119
 heat and in general they do not like 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.009
 too much 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:32.570
 and after he'll stop I'll 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:35.380
 keep putting them in and I'm going 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.380
 to show you what it gives 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.990
 so I saw everything but banana we go 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.990
 mixer 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:50.229
 the classes is pretty much towards the end 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:52.780
 so I 'm going to add some game 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:58.270
 will need shackling indoors for 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:02:01.930
 make vanilla ice cream 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.970
 quantities in general this is the same 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.540
 that's the ideal proportion I think the 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.540
 fresh bananas 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:20.120
 m exactly this quantity here we go 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.120
 see what it's going to give 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:29.129
 we really get we really get 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.459
 the texture of the ice in fact we are you 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:35.400
 see change the color it turns white 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:41.099
 it gets very good there it really falls 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:43.879
 the function of the ice that's me what 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:48.780
 I like to add in the ice cream it's 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:49.859
 carob powder that's the 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.129
 raw carrot powder 

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:54.870
 so it's very nice to add that too 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:57.329
 does a little bit like the between the 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.920
 cocoa and caramel 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:00.950
 it's a really nice little taste 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:05.129
 and I like to put it on my left 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:10.370
 So that's it is there we got ice cream 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:10.370
 vanilla which is very good delicious 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:21.720
 so the consistency 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:29.790
 there she is really creamy and that makes 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:30.060
 really like the place you enjoy 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.019
 well 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.019
 see you soon
