00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.080
 this is the plant space that we are 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.900
 with with and commands with and again 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.720
 doing something mixed mixed media such 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:19.380
 which is very good in the kitchen too 

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:22.619
 they said mixed very well well there's that 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.710
 be exact mixed things very well and what 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.119
 you are going to do in addition to this mixed technique 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.490
 because it seems that the dug is like 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.070
 outside 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:33.750
 according to the ceramics if we give everything a 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.420
 little actually what I want to demonstrate 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.269
 today is something to discover the end of 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.809
 last week without wanting artisan and those 

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:45.080
 things are learned well the craquelure the 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.269
 craquelure effect that can be achieved 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:50.140
 mixing the paintings Havana yes with the 

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:55.180
 water varnish 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:57.490
 unintentionally then equally and 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:00.010
 mix it 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:04.440
 well well dripped I already gave him a base 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:07.530
 white if at last 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.840
 And besides, it's not this one I gave it a 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.490
 way quite loose soil and very 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.760
 charged because this is also going to 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.230
 notice when you are coloring in 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.110
 this case I'm working with the color 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:22.750
 blue that is very cute look here 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:26.520
 a blue france 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:28.920
 electric and electric 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.590
 with magenta 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.770
 achieving other tones in the mixture of 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:38.009
 two in this case in violet yes but today 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:41.090
 I'm working with this pretty 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.090
 loaded the brush 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:47.080
 and now to achieve the effect the 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:51.340
 cracked 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:54.230
 we have to dry we go a little but good 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.880
 put on wave guys but it's a workshop 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:57.690
 art 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.310
 first slowly 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.310
 as for it to settle 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:10.410
 from above so it does not expand 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:12.090
 so the interesting thing is that you see no 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.950
 precisely the little bubbles that is a 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.950
 city effect with brushstroke 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.690
 but being this occasion fernando 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.690
 long berth 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:34.349
 in the upper layer the one that dries 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:34.349
 and down still being cool about that 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.500
 there can be a difference of sin in 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.500
 the materials 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:56.390
 but this is for the effect this 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.100
 retarded maybe he 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.200
 the varnish is like it gives you a little more 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:04.459
 The other paints dries faster 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:07.850
 way as crack yes and this shows and 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:11.390
 the more paint is better for you 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:16.330
 works its clear expression good and more 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:16.330
 great also in the crack the crack 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:24.019
 good what I did after 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.019
 continuing with the polyfunctionality 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:32.850
 Nice water like a string people 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:35.930
 with craquelure effect that is all 2011 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:40.310
 but I will also use 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:43.500
 the varnish to the water like this a 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:45.810
 adhesive to occupy clear 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:49.290
 so when you do not have things 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:51.360
 just check with what 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:54.180
 see what you can replace with clear 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:56.820
 how can you do it and another one for and 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.740
 function that you like it with normally 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:01.230
 used to delineate on whether of natural 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:04.910
 are and I can also apply 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:09.690
 decoratively or otherwise on the finger and 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:11.910
 this skating effect you see where the 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:15.660
 wrinkle 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:17.250
 is where it is like it contains and highlights 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:20.670
 I thought that you were going to highlight 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:22.440
 with the drop, not this time as a match 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:23.990
 as for you we are finding different 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.720
 applications 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:29.300
 to materials usually not 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:31.550
 we use in that way of exact and that 's 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:35.210
 Guayas once this is dry 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:37.250
 obviously if I played with the stencil in 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:39.650
 this case in plane with white acrylic 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:41.870
 the finished one is made with Hindu and 2 does not 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:46.230
 I did it here because of a matter of this 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:49.550
 finish faster if you hit everything 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:49.550
 another new skates 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:54.669
 playing with the tones at all 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:00.420
 and this should have been dry 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.340
 so you can mix it also arises 

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:07.760
 other things that's why 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:07.760
 look at the brightness like eva highlighting yes 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:17.020
 that's hotel sheets with 5 morris at 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:19.990
 water and when all this is ready and 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:22.690
 painted dry 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:25.170
 there yes use the apartment route 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:25.170
 interesting 

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:29.970
 yes 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:32.250
 and if the core later in the case of 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:34.390
 butterfly each one of the leaves with this 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:37.030
 case in the vessel 

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:38.350
 I just give him a few touches of stripes 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:40.540
 line 

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:43.330
 but good according to the figure that you 

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:46.060
 have you going adding different 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:48.400
 concrete concrete decorative effects 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:52.180
 simple so everyone has it 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:54.060
 to do such and if with and we see ourselves in 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:56.920
 next such I loved it if we continue 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:59.260
 painting doing mixed media 

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:01.080
 like an action 26 and asked to speak I have 

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:03.640
 to focus on the best next but 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:06.070
 we bathed a little in paint but 

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:08.320
 this is the thanks and care of 

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:10.830
 you we continue with many 

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.830
 more arts
