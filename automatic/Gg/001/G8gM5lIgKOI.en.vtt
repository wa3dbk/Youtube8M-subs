00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
pumped with it this year so the third

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.530 
pumped with it this year so the third
point<00:01:32.430> is<00:01:32.520> sort<00:01:32.759> of<00:01:32.790> a<00:01:32.880> thing<00:01:32.909> that<00:01:33.090> marries

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.970 
leaning into that concept of the chase
as<00:03:01.030> an<00:03:01.300> undercover<00:03:01.720> cop<00:03:01.810> you'll<00:03:02.620> actually<00:03:02.800> be

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
as an undercover cop you'll actually be

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.560 
as an undercover cop you'll actually be
trying<00:03:03.310> to<00:03:03.400> take<00:03:03.550> down<00:03:03.580> different<00:03:04.120> opponents

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570 
trying to take down different opponents

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:05.850 
trying to take down different opponents
that<00:03:04.720> are<00:03:04.780> on<00:03:04.959> your<00:03:05.110> way<00:03:05.170> you'll<00:03:05.440> be<00:03:05.530> getting<00:03:05.800> a

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
that are on your way you'll be getting a

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.800 
that are on your way you'll be getting a
list<00:03:06.040> of<00:03:06.220> people<00:03:06.459> to<00:03:06.489> get<00:03:06.700> out<00:03:06.850> at<00:03:07.480> the<00:03:07.630> same

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
list of people to get out at the same

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.420 
list of people to get out at the same
time<00:03:08.080> the<00:03:08.560> cops<00:03:08.769> don't<00:03:08.950> know<00:03:09.100> who<00:03:09.250> you<00:03:09.400> are

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
time the cops don't know who you are

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.310 
time the cops don't know who you are
because<00:03:09.820> only<00:03:10.030> chase<00:03:10.540> as<00:03:10.750> your<00:03:10.870> handle<00:03:11.140> is<00:03:11.200> the

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
because only chase as your handle is the

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.050 
because only chase as your handle is the
only<00:03:11.470> person<00:03:11.950> that<00:03:12.040> knows<00:03:12.160> our<00:03:12.370> true<00:03:12.549> identity

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
only person that knows our true identity

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.030 
only person that knows our true identity
so<00:03:13.480> it<00:03:13.570> creates<00:03:13.900> this<00:03:13.989> really<00:03:14.080> cool<00:03:14.530> three-way

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
so it creates this really cool three-way

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.800 
so it creates this really cool three-way
aspect<00:03:15.489> of<00:03:15.610> the<00:03:15.700> chase<00:03:15.940> you've<00:03:16.450> got<00:03:16.570> cops

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
aspect of the chase you've got cops

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.360

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
confusing element in the game but a lot

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.390 
confusing element in the game but a lot
of<00:03:22.180> gameplay<00:03:22.540> fun<00:03:22.840> drifting<00:03:23.500> won't<00:03:23.830> be<00:03:24.010> an

actual mode in the game I think a lot of
the<00:03:26.950> what's<00:03:27.190> happening<00:03:27.580> with<00:03:27.670> the<00:03:27.790> drifting

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
the what's happening with the drifting
