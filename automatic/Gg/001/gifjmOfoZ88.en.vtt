of<00:02:09.920> course<00:02:09.979> earlier<00:02:10.580> in<00:02:10.700> the<00:02:10.790> day<00:02:10.970> I<00:02:11.270> set<00:02:11.630> the

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
of course earlier in the day I set the

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.630 
of course earlier in the day I set the
tent<00:02:11.990> up<00:02:12.260> with<00:02:12.560> a<00:02:12.590> view<00:02:12.890> to<00:02:13.100> reviewing<00:02:13.460> it

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
tent up with a view to reviewing it

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.570 
tent up with a view to reviewing it
later<00:02:13.850> I<00:02:14.410> couldn't<00:02:15.410> find<00:02:15.620> any<00:02:15.860> instructions

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
later I couldn't find any instructions

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.550 
later I couldn't find any instructions
so<00:02:17.030> the<00:02:17.330> good<00:02:17.480> news<00:02:17.540> was<00:02:18.020> it<00:02:18.200> was<00:02:18.320> pretty

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
so the good news was it was pretty

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.920 
so the good news was it was pretty
intuitive<00:02:19.370> and<00:02:19.610> didn't<00:02:19.880> take<00:02:20.090> a<00:02:20.300> tall<00:02:20.510> long<00:02:20.720> in

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
intuitive and didn't take a tall long in

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.750 
intuitive and didn't take a tall long in
fact<00:02:21.140> I<00:02:21.260> reckon<00:02:21.530> about<00:02:21.620> five<00:02:22.040> minutes<00:02:22.310> to<00:02:22.490> put

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
fact I reckon about five minutes to put

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.090 
fact I reckon about five minutes to put
it<00:02:22.880> up<00:02:23.030> at<00:02:23.720> the<00:02:23.870> same<00:02:24.050> time<00:02:24.350> my<00:02:24.620> friend<00:02:24.920> was

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
it up at the same time my friend was

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.790 
it up at the same time my friend was
putting<00:02:25.130> up<00:02:25.580> his<00:02:26.410> 400-pound<00:02:27.410> plus

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
putting up his 400-pound plus

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.490 
putting up his 400-pound plus
lightweight<00:02:28.430> solo<00:02:28.910> tent<00:02:29.300> that<00:02:29.960> seemed<00:02:30.260> about

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
lightweight solo tent that seemed about

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.340 
lightweight solo tent that seemed about
the<00:02:30.680> same<00:02:30.920> weight<00:02:31.600> so<00:02:32.600> I<00:02:32.870> thought<00:02:33.200> I<00:02:33.260> would

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
the same weight so I thought I would

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.380 
the same weight so I thought I would
just<00:02:33.500> go<00:02:34.100> through<00:02:34.340> the<00:02:34.490> motions<00:02:34.610> putting<00:02:35.300> the

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
just go through the motions putting the

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.170 
just go through the motions putting the
tent<00:02:35.570> up<00:02:35.840> sleeping<00:02:36.770> in<00:02:36.860> it<00:02:37.010> taking<00:02:37.790> it<00:02:37.910> down

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
tent up sleeping in it taking it down

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.750 
tent up sleeping in it taking it down
putting<00:02:38.930> it<00:02:39.110> back<00:02:39.260> in<00:02:39.470> the<00:02:39.560> bag<00:02:39.740> and<00:02:40.010> then

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
putting it back in the bag and then

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.500 
putting it back in the bag and then
making<00:02:41.060> this<00:02:41.360> video<00:02:41.780> review<00:02:42.020> on<00:02:42.260> another<00:02:42.800> day

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
making this video review on another day

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.320 
making this video review on another day
my<00:02:44.510> first<00:02:44.810> impressions<00:02:45.580> were<00:02:46.580> that<00:02:46.880> it<00:02:47.120> was<00:02:47.300> a

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
my first impressions were that it was a

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.200 
my first impressions were that it was a
pretty<00:02:47.630> tight<00:02:48.020> fit<00:02:48.410> lengthwise<00:02:49.160> for<00:02:49.640> my<00:02:49.790> five

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:50.210 
pretty tight fit lengthwise for my five

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:52.780 
pretty tight fit lengthwise for my five
foot<00:02:50.450> ten<00:02:50.690> fairly<00:02:51.200> average<00:02:51.320> height<00:02:51.740> but<00:02:52.670> the

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
foot ten fairly average height but the

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.490 
foot ten fairly average height but the
main<00:02:53.030> thing<00:02:53.060> was<00:02:53.480> there<00:02:53.720> was<00:02:53.810> no<00:02:54.050> condensation

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
main thing was there was no condensation

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.270 
main thing was there was no condensation
in<00:02:55.190> the<00:02:55.280> morning<00:02:55.700> and<00:02:55.880> as<00:02:56.540> the<00:02:56.930> inner<00:02:57.440> fly<00:02:57.980> tent

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
in the morning and as the inner fly tent

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.690 
in the morning and as the inner fly tent
I<00:02:58.610> think<00:02:59.360> pretty<00:02:59.510> well<00:02:59.780> protected<00:02:59.989> me<00:03:00.530> I<00:03:02.470> still

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
I think pretty well protected me I still

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.449 
I think pretty well protected me I still
baffled<00:03:04.700> as<00:03:04.910> to<00:03:04.940> how<00:03:05.120> oz<00:03:05.720> will<00:03:06.020> Bailey<00:03:06.440> can<00:03:07.310> do

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
baffled as to how oz will Bailey can do

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:10.449 
baffled as to how oz will Bailey can do
this<00:03:07.640> for<00:03:07.850> the<00:03:07.910> price<00:03:08.470> I<00:03:09.470> really<00:03:10.250> don't

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
this for the price I really don't

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:12.820 
this for the price I really don't
because<00:03:10.670> looking<00:03:11.390> at<00:03:11.510> the<00:03:11.600> quality<00:03:11.780> it<00:03:12.290> seems

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
because looking at the quality it seems

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.070 
because looking at the quality it seems
fine<00:03:13.100> the<00:03:13.550> tell-tale<00:03:13.820> signs<00:03:14.420> for<00:03:14.750> not<00:03:14.870> just

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080 
fine the tell-tale signs for not just

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.130 
fine the tell-tale signs for not just
cheap<00:03:15.350> 10<00:03:15.680> oz<00:03:16.100> ipps<00:03:16.670> that<00:03:17.000> catch<00:03:17.239> or<00:03:17.510> jam<00:03:17.810> and

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
cheap 10 oz ipps that catch or jam and

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.000 
cheap 10 oz ipps that catch or jam and
this<00:03:19.040> seems<00:03:19.310> fine<00:03:19.720> there<00:03:20.720> was<00:03:20.870> a<00:03:20.900> tiny<00:03:21.230> clin

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
this seems fine there was a tiny clin

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.600 
this seems fine there was a tiny clin
that<00:03:22.280> was<00:03:22.430> broken<00:03:23.830> but<00:03:24.830> I<00:03:25.040> reckon<00:03:25.580> for

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
that was broken but I reckon for

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.820 
that was broken but I reckon for
occasional<00:03:26.270> overnight<00:03:26.390> trips<00:03:27.380> this<00:03:27.620> is<00:03:27.800> a

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:27.830 
occasional overnight trips this is a

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:33.130 
occasional overnight trips this is a
real<00:03:28.040> cracker<00:03:28.870> I<00:03:30.280> did<00:03:31.280> do<00:03:31.489> a<00:03:31.520> bit<00:03:31.760> of<00:03:32.140> YouTube

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
real cracker I did do a bit of YouTube

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.140 
real cracker I did do a bit of YouTube
research<00:03:33.530> looking<00:03:34.010> at<00:03:34.130> virtually<00:03:34.519> every<00:03:34.700> tent

into<00:04:03.140> it

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
into it

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.410 
into it
in<00:04:03.810> the<00:04:04.020> early<00:04:04.260> hours<00:04:04.290> of<00:04:04.590> the<00:04:04.710> morning<00:04:05.420> now

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
in the early hours of the morning now

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.230 
in the early hours of the morning now
the<00:04:06.480> tent<00:04:06.870> goes<00:04:07.110> up<00:04:07.350> really<00:04:07.709> easily<00:04:08.040> and<00:04:08.430> i

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:09.240 
the tent goes up really easily and i

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.410 
the tent goes up really easily and i
think<00:04:09.840> it's<00:04:09.959> only<00:04:10.020> about<00:04:10.230> three<00:04:10.770> pegs<00:04:11.120> for<00:04:12.120> the

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
think it's only about three pegs for the

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.080 
think it's only about three pegs for the
the<00:04:12.840> first<00:04:12.990> stage<00:04:13.350> the<00:04:13.740> inner<00:04:14.010> fly<00:04:14.550> sheet<00:04:14.880> and

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
the first stage the inner fly sheet and
