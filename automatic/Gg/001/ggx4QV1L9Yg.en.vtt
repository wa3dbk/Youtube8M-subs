 Hey everyone, I am Justin with americanmuscle.com. This is my quick breakdown of Chrome BBK 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:13.070
 One eight-inch five-inch long tube headers are available for your '79 and '93 manual 5-liter 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.310
 Foxbody. Before we get all the details here with these BBK long tube headers, I want 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.270
 To provide a friendly reminder to subscribe to our YouTube channel if you have not already done so 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.880
 So already for the most in-depth category review on the web plus the best Mustang 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:26.880
 content. 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.840
 These particular long pipes of BBK do feature one and eight five-inch primary or pipe, 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.690
 Each of them was bent mandrel to help increase the flow and increase your performance. 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.660
 The eighth and fifth version I have here with me today is definitely to be 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.760
 Most of the popular offerings are for most street cars or even cars with a very decent amount of 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.680
 Nitrous momentum or induction force. I do not want to point out that BBK does not offer 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.950
 The three quarter version has one same header specified, but only if you are set to 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.130
 Great powers through a big cubic inch or a big boost, I would stick with the eighth and five and one 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.700
 Copy here for cars making 500 horsepower or less. 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.950
 As you can see, these long pipes do feature that nice, bright chrome accents that will 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.729
 No doubt look good under the hood of your Foxbody. For a few more dollars, men, 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:11.880
 You can spring for optional ceramic paint which will make this finish a bit more 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.159
 Durable, it will help to reduce under the hood a little temperature. Men, that is great 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:21.389
 Time to remind you that these long tubes will fit only a 5-liter Foxbody manual. So, 

00:01:21.389 --> 00:01:25.219
 If you have an automatic car or if you are only interested in various finishes or sizing 

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:29.259
 Options, well then you should definitely go to support the product page at americanmuscle.com 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:30.719
 If you are not already there. 

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:34.670
 Getting into some of the smaller yet equally important details, BBK does not include laser 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.920
 Cut the lips with all the headers make for an OEM fit like. So they toss in the brand 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.240
 Hardware and exhaust multiple new mattresses just to save fellow travelers to parts 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.880
 a store. Installing a new set of long tubes on your Mustang can be a bit intimidating 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.869
 at least. If you do not think you have mechanical skills or tools to get 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:56.899
 To this task, feel free to communicate to your local store. On the other hand, if 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:00.069
 Something like that is just another day in the garage for you, well then leave it to yourself 

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:03.609
 About a full day in the garage to get the job done. Feel free to get close to 

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:06.060
 Mustang Expert If you must have any questions. 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.440
 Before I conclude this review, I do not want to remind you that when you are not using a set of 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.170
 Long tubes like BBKs here, you will need to handle your midpipe because the factory 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.660
 The midpipe will no longer work. In this case, of course, BBK recommends going with them 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.140
 A small midpipe is available on the site here in all X or H pipe configurations. As for 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.720
 The way, if you have any other questions about this, again, just access to the Mustang expert 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.570
 At what time. If you are looking for a range of long tube headers to push the 5.0 rod very 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.620
 The fair price then you have to check out one tube and eight five inch long chrome 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.470
 BBK headers are available here at americanmuscle.com.
