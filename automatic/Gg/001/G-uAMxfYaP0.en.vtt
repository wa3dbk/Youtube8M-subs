well

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:46.530 

obviously<00:01:37.299> get<00:01:37.450> all<00:01:37.540> three

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:46.540 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.039 

you<00:01:47.540> get<00:01:47.720> much<00:01:47.900> playing<00:01:48.619> time

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:53.770 

we<00:01:51.590> offer<00:01:51.770> any<00:01:52.039> explanation<00:01:52.270> does<00:01:53.270> any<00:01:53.420> reason

we offer any explanation does any reason

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:06.360 
we offer any explanation does any reason
match<00:01:53.960> up<00:01:54.200> issues

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:06.370 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.740 

who<00:02:07.370> the<00:02:07.670> is<00:02:07.850> out<00:02:08.240> there<00:02:08.390> did<00:02:08.510> a<00:02:08.540> good<00:02:08.690> job

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
who the is out there did a good job

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.630 
who the is out there did a good job
so<00:02:11.470> that's<00:02:12.470> my<00:02:12.650> third<00:02:12.980> and<00:02:13.160> win<00:02:13.280> so<00:02:13.520> we're

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
so that's my third and win so we're

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:23.730 
so that's my third and win so we're
playing

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740

it was wrong

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:36.620 
it was wrong
great<00:02:27.010> pass<00:02:29.910> so<00:02:30.910> we<00:02:31.000> could<00:02:31.150> adopt<00:02:31.390> that

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.100 

I<00:02:36.660> mean<00:02:37.590> it<00:02:37.680> probably<00:02:38.190> could<00:02:39.090> I<00:02:39.450> mean<00:02:39.780> it<00:02:39.870> can't

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
I mean it probably could I mean it can't

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.190 
I mean it probably could I mean it can't
say<00:02:40.320> I'm<00:02:40.500> it<00:02:40.650> was<00:02:41.450> you<00:02:42.450> try<00:02:42.690> to<00:02:42.750> dunk<00:02:42.930> allows

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
but it's our situation at use and

not<00:04:35.509> necessarily<00:04:36.050> I<00:04:36.080> mean<00:04:36.139> like<00:04:36.319> I<00:04:36.349> said<00:04:36.439> we

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
not necessarily I mean like I said we

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.129 
not necessarily I mean like I said we
dummy<00:04:36.979> them<00:04:37.129> practice<00:04:37.580> we<00:04:38.539> can<00:04:38.629> get<00:04:38.810> it<00:04:38.900> on<00:04:38.990> our

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:39.139 
dummy them practice we can get it on our

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:40.899 
dummy them practice we can get it on our
own<00:04:39.169> guys<00:04:39.590> and<00:04:39.860> practice<00:04:40.159> I<00:04:40.280> mean<00:04:40.430> we<00:04:40.729> should

00:04:40.899 --> 00:04:40.909 
own guys and practice I mean we should

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:42.070 
own guys and practice I mean we should
be<00:04:40.969> able<00:04:41.090> to<00:04:41.150> get<00:04:41.240> against<00:04:41.509> a<00:04:41.599> different<00:04:41.930> team
