 hi to all friends bikers apple 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.420
 today we show you a new tweak 

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:32.750
 developed by gabriele filipponi one 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:35.660
 Italian developer that allows us to 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:38.300
 have on ios 7 on a device 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:41.090
 clearly jailbreak the control 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:45.080
 center that apple introduced with the 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:46.910
 fourth beta of ios s8 we on ios 7 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.510
 we have the control center that we are there 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.890
 showing at the moment that he has a 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:56.030
 kept more or less the same graphic 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:58.310
 for the whole period of the beta and of the 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:04.369
 stable versions of 97 and later 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:07.850
 of ios 7.1.1 and 2 center ex were a 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:09.860
 tweak which is available for free 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.330
 in the city and store within the area 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.440
 of bigboss 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.320
 and the version we're showing you 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.000
 it is not the one available in cydia store 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:21.430
 at the time we are recording 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:25.010
 this video or from 1.1.4 but is the 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:29.390
 1.1.6 that was sent to us by 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:31.520
 developer to try them out to write 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.790
 this review 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.380
 this new version will then be sent 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.720
 out by already in Versilia if you will 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.680
 available in the next few hours 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.960
 right now we have 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.490
 always installed and this is the 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.960
 result we get later 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.720
 installation 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.580
 as you can see the new icons that 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.320
 have been introduced with ios s8 can 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:55.430
 be used thanks to the former 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:57.320
 even on ios 7 we clearly do not have 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:00.350
 of changes at the level of 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.600
 functionality within the dl 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.560
 control center but will remain active 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.479
 all the functions that they were 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.840
 first present then we will have the various 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:11.060
 I remove which then must be activated 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:15.060
 or deactivated and when not 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:18.450
 let's activate we saw how 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:21.180
 the dongle turns white as it happens 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.640
 on the juve s8 the tweak in question 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.630
 It is also compatible with iPad soon 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.830
 we will also show its operation 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.830
 on the live hub 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.620
 such as 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:38.410
 we said we show you now the 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.330
 operation on ipad the against 60 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:44.560
 of the aipa not used very often 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:46.600
 by users but in any case apple has 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.450
 modified like that of the iphone too 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.250
 that of the ipad and therefore center ex 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.470
 also compatible with this device 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.530
 after having always installed we find ourselves 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.810
 always facing version 1.1.3 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:02.620
 we will get this result on ours 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:04.510
 ipad so we will have the various toggles that 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.860
 have been slightly modified 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:12.550
 graphic level and we wo n't have many others 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:13.750
 the tweak differences as I told you 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.910
 first it is available for free 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.440
 within the city ​​a store in the repo 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.020
 of bigboss 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:23.250
 and it can be installed on all 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:26.170
 devices that have ios is installed 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.450
 the tweak and has already received some 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.710
 updates and will receive others in the 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.030
 next hours 

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:33.490
 one in particular will be enough 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.740
 important since I will add the 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:37.330
 compatibility with yours allow 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:41.980
 to customize center toggles 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:43.690
 notifications and recco la rwe sharing 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.000
 we thank you for following the 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.450
 review and wish you good 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.840
