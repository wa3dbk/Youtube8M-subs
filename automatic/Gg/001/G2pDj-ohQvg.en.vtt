00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:30.240
 try to believe I leave you 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:32.880
 ingredients that are just a few 150 g 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.329
 of dark chocolate 100 grams of 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.620
 milk chocolate and 150 ml of cream 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:42.500

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.500
 and cover everything you want 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.309
 let us then proceed to the proceedings 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:01:00.360
 the first thing we pour the ball into a 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:01:03.120
 little boy we are expecting little especially 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:06.690
 boil so let's add the two types of 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.810
 chocolate, the dark one and the chocolate one 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.810
 milk 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.440
 stir to dissolve everything and 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.800
 get a smooth and without compound 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.800
 lumps 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:29.420
 let it cool and mix the 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.420
 much and much 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:38.200
 we form with our hands or with the help of 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:40.450
 two teaspoons the compound balls and 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.810
 it was already his plate lined with paper 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.810

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.380
 made all the balls we gather in 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:01.570
 refrigerator for an hour and a half 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.850
 then we take truffles and have fun at 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:07.120
 decorate them with whatever you prefer 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:09.970
 I used colored sugar 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:13.060
 and chocolate problem remained at 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:16.030
 hazelnuts and coconut but you can use 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.910
 also chopped pistachio or pages 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:21.160
 colored etcetera etc. kept 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.450
 then the truffles in a cool place or in 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.220
 fridge 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:28.980
 inside the container or know 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.980
 cover when serving them 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.210
