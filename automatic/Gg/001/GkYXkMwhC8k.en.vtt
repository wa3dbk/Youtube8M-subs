downgrade or anything whatever I want to
do<00:05:29.830> if<00:05:29.979> I<00:05:30.100> mean<00:05:30.520> upgrade<00:05:30.970> back<00:05:31.150> to<00:05:31.270> 3<00:05:31.450> +<00:05:31.600> 61<00:05:31.900> I

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:32.320 
do if I mean upgrade back to 3 + 61 I

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.680 
do if I mean upgrade back to 3 + 61 I
can<00:05:33.130> actually<00:05:33.280> go<00:05:33.520> to<00:05:33.580> any<00:05:33.760> firmware<00:05:34.030> I'm

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:34.690 
can actually go to any firmware I'm

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:38.340 
can actually go to any firmware I'm
thinking<00:05:34.900> about<00:05:35.169> going<00:05:35.289> 3.4<00:05:35.919> t12<00:05:37.139> if<00:05:38.139> I<00:05:38.229> ever

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:38.350 
thinking about going 3.4 t12 if I ever

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:42.600 
thinking about going 3.4 t12 if I ever
wanted<00:05:38.650> to<00:05:38.710> connect<00:05:39.160> that<00:05:40.410> this<00:05:41.410> back<00:05:41.889> up<00:05:42.160> it

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:42.610 
wanted to connect that this back up it

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:44.100 
wanted to connect that this back up it
would<00:05:42.760> be<00:05:42.850> easy<00:05:43.090> because<00:05:43.389> i<00:05:43.539> already<00:05:43.660> have<00:05:43.900> it

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:44.110 
would be easy because i already have it

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:48.930 
would be easy because i already have it
and<00:05:46.110> we<00:05:47.110> want<00:05:47.289> to<00:05:47.350> go<00:05:47.440> to<00:05:47.470> point<00:05:47.889> 61<00:05:48.370> I'll<00:05:48.639> have

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:48.940
