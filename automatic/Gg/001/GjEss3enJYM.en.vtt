00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.120
 m 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.710
 all motor sport enthusiasts 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:27.500
 and glide was at the rendezvous Saturday 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:30.079
 January 26 at the Geopark this idea 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.719
 move to attend the 6th stage of 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:34.640
 famous andros trophy 

00:00:31.719 --> 00:00:36.680
 this 2013 edition was a beautiful 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.260
 success with weather conditions 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.300
 ideal courses focus on a 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.100
 single day and pilots who have 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.530
 assured the show in both 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.750
 thermal car test categories 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.030
 electric 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:52.700
 which delighted the organizers of which 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.230
 max mamers these sportsmen in mind 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.960
 company is originally with 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:59.410
 frederic gervoson of this adventure that 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.910
 started 24 years ago already 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.829
 my weather is cold that's exactly what 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.110
 that it is worth it that has usually 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:08.630
 in high mountains so it's very very 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.670
 although this temperature know and here 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.110
 to Saint Die des Vosges 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.190
 for this 2013 edition you have changed 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.350
 a little the formula is that on a 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.700
 day so why that's all about 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.710
 a day because it's bigger 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.409
 centers and for the public it was a 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.359
 request c 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:24.640
 a timing that we use more and more 

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:26.079
 it works well change some 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.170
 thing is the formula was short 

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:31.329
 it is here but especially knows it the 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.310
 ten- year portion of electric cars 

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:35.350
 which is gaining more and more value 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.569
 today it is almost the record of 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.849
 fastest turn are the 

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:41.439
 electric and I know that's when 

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:43.770
 even very interesting I always have a 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:45.849
 little memory for this term pierret 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.289
 former Minister of Industry who had 

00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:48.579
 always been thoroughly behind the 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:49.990
 electric cars and there had to be 

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:50.560
 to believe there was already a long time ago it was 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:56.129
 not fashion 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:56.129
 so we said it but also we did it 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.200
 little trip to the paddock 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.479
 what is called the enclosure where 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.990
 prepare pilots between two 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.450
 hardship 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.730
 the perfect place to hold a microphone and 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.920
 collect some impressions and 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:17.040
 little happiness of the day it's 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.480
 margot laffite that starts it's going rather 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.010
 not bad but we are pleasantly surprised 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.000
 because we have a nice track this 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.319
 year we had conditions a little 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.270
 complicated last he was falling strings 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.470
 and it is true that we had quickly lost the 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.120
 ice cream while here it holds or rather 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.280
 not bad even if the party has asphalted 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.659
 a little bit of ice but 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.430
 it's always a pleasure to come 

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:35.349
 here because in fact there are a lot 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.700
 a lot of fans it's all 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:37.750
 passionate and it's true that there is a 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.920
 craze that does not have on others 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.480
 races we were very 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.670
 nice it's going very fast today 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.159
 ouch that speeding saar in front of goal 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.349
 and then there is a lot he goes back 

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:50.140
 koala franck and francky and christophe 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:53.110
 who are leading the championship there 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.850
 shipments are fun to ride 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.560
 of course a lot of fun more 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.120
 electric it's really very nice 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.110
 I've always been a little back to my 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.180
 first loves because I started 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.190
 by the sprint because on the ice so 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.990
 it's a ya of there is real pleasure and 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.520
 then the wedding is always nice enough 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.840
 because dishes like this one 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.370
 is not a lot in the season we have 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.480
 it is necessary in andorre so it is very 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.330
 nice to go home with a lot of 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.950
 speed on a shot in progress 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.750
 congratulations to margaux who at the end of this 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.310
 day where I hope it's on a 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.850
 beautiful fourth place 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.650
 general of the trophy andros electric the 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.080
 just in front of her three big pilots 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:29.500
 also christophe ferrier adria 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.810
 to fall and franck lagorce okay he 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.160
 is nice there are many people 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.459
 trophy andros the trophy rendezvous 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.620
 andros 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:37.060
 the magic of the trophy andros walked a 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.070
 time again so here we are 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.150
 pleasure we want to attack but he 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.620
 have to be careful because it's a 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.800
 track a little bit tricky so if we 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.800
 attack too much we lose we lose a little 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.269
 short time so you have to have the bridge 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:51.130
 the middle ground let's say of the attacked 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:52.630
 and to be patient about them on 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.920
 the accelerator but otherwise it's very 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:56.290
 Nice it's a beautiful adventure 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.480
 today we are faster than 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.500
 thermal cars 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.579
 it's still quite exceptional for 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.980
 electric cars I think that 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:04.000
 sarah will silence a lot of two 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.950
 people who say that the car 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.900
 had done that it's sucks 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.180
 and there we are showing and 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.400
 demonstrate that not only do these athletes 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:15.040
 because of course we are doing 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.500
 beautiful races but more rare certainly 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.190
 there is no noise but in addition we lose on 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.239
 still works for the 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.919
 development of the car of tomorrow 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.450
 the car of sir and madam all the 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:23.979
 world so it's also a good thing 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:26.050
 since all the partners who are 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:28.360
 involved in this adventure 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.770
 contribute to finding cars 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.419
 and electric vehicles tomorrow in 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.370
 the car so I think it's 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:38.020
 something awesome that a train of 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:40.330
 to happen in the car category 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.879
 thermal jean philippe dayraut a 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:45.879
 confirmed at the end of race number 1 

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:48.150
 his first place overall 

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:52.509
 and for him it is not not not bad 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:53.740
 we won the race this morning so in 

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:54.639
 same time without a license to win the 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.460
 andros trophy 

00:04:54.639 --> 00:05:00.280
 so it's great communicates well 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.960
 obviously so this afternoon I even 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:04.629
 no need to roll for compared to 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:06.330
 championship since I already won but 

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:07.620
 we're going to do shows anyway 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:11.009
 to surround spectators have come 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:12.599
 We see you are China importance 

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:14.729
 particular to the tires the track has 

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:17.189
 changed since this morning of course 

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:18.539
 we good appears more and more so 

00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:20.310
 the substantive issues do not change the 

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:22.379
 settings of the car also so we 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:24.270
 do a lot of tweaks to adapt the 

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:26.840
 car to the circuit and let's go 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:28.770
 regularly so some orient according to 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:31.409
 jean-philippe they should defend 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:34.379
 this first place at the super 

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:36.330
 finale of super besse on February 2 

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:37.909
 will thus hang on his palmares a 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:41.180
 fourth victory at trophy andros 

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:41.180
 thermal art 

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:44.569
 Oh 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:06:01.410
 our champion that of the ratings is 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:04.530
 our famous jean pierre pernaut a 

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:06.720
 amateur driver but who ensures on the 

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:09.540
 track and is pleased to compete 

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.900
 with the pros when we're in the 

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:13.170
 car 

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:14.610
 five qualifying rounds this is it 

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:16.800
 difficult to be hyper concentrated 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:18.240
 12 in music here at concrete walls 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.460
 right next so the slightest bit 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:23.310
 mistake we are in the concrete so that's 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:25.110
 of concentration and then and then 

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:26.640
 here we try to do the best and me 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:27.720
 I am the little amateur who follows the 

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:29.490
 professionals in there and I am 

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.760
 pleased he will make you happy when 

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:31.440
 even 

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:32.550
 yeah but it's a huge pleasure all 

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:37.140
 weekends every winter since 

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:39.180
 seven years with my son there we have fun here 

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:41.040
 great winner of this day the 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:41.850
 drivers of course but also the car 

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:44.400
 electric 

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:45.990
 these high level competitions puts in 

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:49.260
 before new generations of 

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:51.450
 clean vehicles less polluting a 

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:53.310
 evolution welcomed by the Minister of 

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:55.180
 christian ferrer industry 

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:57.759
 today we realize that it is 

00:06:55.180 --> 00:07:00.430
 really possible to do a real sport 

00:06:57.759 --> 00:07:04.270
 very competitive automobile very 

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:06.069
 performing very advanced with a lot 

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:08.139
 of very young pilots with equipment 

00:07:06.069 --> 00:07:10.090
 French with batteries 

00:07:08.139 --> 00:07:12.939
 French and so we are in the process of 

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:14.860
 demonstrate that advanced technology 

00:07:12.939 --> 00:07:16.810
 encouraged by the rally encouraged by 

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:19.779
 sport can be a technology 

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:21.520
 French who succeeds so it's at 

00:07:19.779 --> 00:07:23.949
 andros is a holy saint of the Vosges 

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:27.240
 demonstrates that the possible is French and 

00:07:23.949 --> 00:07:27.240
 that progress is French
