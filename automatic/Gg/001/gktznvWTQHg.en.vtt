00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:13.469
 And here we are, one more time. 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:16.500
 maneuvers tutorial and this time I'm going 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:19.770
 Are you trying to teach or give some pro 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:23.100
 savannah defron the first step you 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.800
 have to do is practice the position of 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.380
 from the savannah savannah on a sidewalk in a 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.410
 guide because why you have to cross 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.090
 your feet is a rather complex position 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.510
 a father can beat the other by the time 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.730
 you're popular then first step 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.190
 You will stay snuggling the savannah. 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.989
 defron in the tab 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.190
 after you practice this several 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.550
 times 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.860
 and I have two tips for you 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.840
 the first when you have the floor and 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.680
 You jump to make soap 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.680
 defron 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.000
 you can not play too much spin it's not a 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.940
 Backside Savannah You Have To Play 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.460
 all the smell is one is frontside then 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.799
 one plays a lot of spin for when it fits 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.830
 Your favor, he gets stuck then 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.330
 I always thought about it not playing too much spin 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.340
 The second tip I have to give 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.189
 It's me, I see a lot of people. 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.430
 which gives a frontside touch to the savannah 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:20.369
 people even learn this way but it's in the 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:24.930
 My opinion is the man has tasted for a long time. 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:27.000
 weather is not so safe the savannah the foot 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.470
 back is floating in fact it 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.710
 it had to be your foot 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.049
 your safety foot then my tip 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.909
 contrary to what everyone does 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.759
 My tip is for you to stick with the weight. 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.259
 in the back foot on the backslide ped so 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.299
 that after you give why you 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.880
 you can give royal square were defron because 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.189
 You always have this foot here with the 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.399
 diabetic foot haida trapped in it then 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:52.200
 practice often times there in general 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:55.799
 main popular popular feet feet 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:59.479

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:03.299
 play very cool and try to take enough 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:05.640
 It's the biggest support you're sure they can. 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:09.539
 being can say that it is in two but one 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.950
