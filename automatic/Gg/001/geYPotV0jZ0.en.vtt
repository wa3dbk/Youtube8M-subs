 Invoice gadget but are you sure that will be 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.900
 still 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.180
 it is self-healing itself 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:02.729
 healing coating and in this 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.260
 since she is even more so to say so tenacious 

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:06.000
 guys say heal when 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.250
 scratches much faster when 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.190
 the temperature is sufficient that is warm neither 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.500
 it's not cold in the cold you scratched it 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.270
 slightly until scratches remain even faster 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.450
 several times faster than before

 2 gigabytes of RAM 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.850
 built-in 16 or 32 battery 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.469
 the smartphone 3000 milliamper hours will remind 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.020
 what is he like in the first version here 

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:36.930
 too bent there inside such a little bit 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.840
 half round regret here is protection 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.820
 but the smartphone cover is removable and there 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.859
 there is a sim card slot and socket 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.049
 naturally for the memory card 

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:48.290
 the most bent battery well here 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:51.410
 nothing yet to shoot and 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:53.290
 and it is impossible to pick open the bottom for 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:56.140
 headphone and micro usb connector 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:58.240
 here is the speaker 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.810
 several available gadget colors here 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:05.229
 we got an elegant burgundy red 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:07.810
 or whatever its color primary color it 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:09.869
 still so gray brown here it is 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.250
 here it is everywhere including this one 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:15.010
 wonderful housing things with glasses that 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.590
 it scratches but now apparently there is for 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.200

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:26.110
 stabilization and laser autofocus 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.959
 frontally here is not a little bit decent 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.130
 The easiest way is 2 and 1 megapixels, that is 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:34.750
 of course not cell phone 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:37.510
 but the quality of the main course 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.220
 inspires respect that's still here 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.090
 continues next to us is a man from 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.280

 Wi-Fi and bluetooth nfc 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:04.570
 and gps and naturally glonass gadget 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.640
 slightly outwardly different from the first 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:09.070
 versions but still the same 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:12.160
