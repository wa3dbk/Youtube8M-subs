00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.179
 Well that everyone knows him 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.340
 berzerk 4 1 3 today we 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.139
 let's meet on one piece pirate warriors 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.940
 two because you have been extremely 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.859
 many to ask me to redo a 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.470
 video on this game except this time 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.880
 you asked me to use the fit 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.560
 so that's what I did except that 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.349
 rather than completely redoing the 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.390
 level since you've already seen it with 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.279
 the gameplay of trafalgar the water seen as the 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.180
 demo only offers one single 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.210
 and unique mission 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.940
 I decided to dissect more in 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.250
 detail the attacks of the ofii rather than 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.809
 to redo the level entirely and 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.289
 to simply talk to you about 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:49.940
 characters that will be playable so 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.940
 so here we are going to start directly 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.239
 so to start with the technique of 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.760
 base when you hit the button 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.170
 square the fifties the game gatling and the 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.520
 finish with a ford gears 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.579
 so it's just a version 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.760
 improved the basic technique of 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.350
 hackers warriors 1 next we go 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.970
 pass a new technique when 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.400
 you hammer the square key and that 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.860
 when the fit uses his gatling you 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.990
 press triangle repeatedly the 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.909
 fiva will start doing a kind of 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.320
 tornadoes with his legs and this is a 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.100
 quite devastating technique like 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.100
 could see it on the screen 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:25.619
 then we'll go to a 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.540
 improved technique of the previous one 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.189
 piece when you press twice 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.939
 the square key and you hammer the 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.400
 triangle key 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.710
 the son is going to do a job with 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.479
 his arms which is quite devastating 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:41.610
 when you have a huge denial 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:42.960
 around you then when you 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.220
 press the square key three times 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.890
 and you press the key 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.630
 triangle the wire so like rockets 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.369
 except that which is nice with 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.860
 this technique is that when you 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.899
 stay on the triangle button on 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.890
 fiva put himself in balloon mode and 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.890
 do more damage 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.900
 this technique is very simple to 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.150
 realize just press once 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.530
 on carey and once on triangle for 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.720
 that the son start to put his foot 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.910
 or in the air and clac violently at 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.530
 soil she also owns her 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:15.370
 improved version when you hold 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.870
 the triangle key when leaning 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.970
 twice on the triangle key and that 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.130
 you mark the square key the son is 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:28.540
 serves as a guard to hit all 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:30.010
 other enemies around him and well 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.050
 that's it for the attacks of 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:35.290
 base have in my opinion I had in 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.900
 forget some of more success than the 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.290
 demo I think the official game 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.520
 should have a little more 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.410
 but I did a little bit of a tour 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.120
 the main and novelties of luffy 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.220
 so his case is that we will move 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:52.540
 directly to special attacks and 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:54.190
 it's gone then it's gone 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.170
 starts strong enough with an attack 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.020
 Level 1 special which is none other than 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:05.260
 the red rock that the proud uses against 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:07.540
 audi I think you'll love the 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.730
 special tax level 2 2 the fis which 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.370
 is none other than the elephant gatling that 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:15.420
 luffy use to destroy black and 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.420
 save the island of men fish 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.820
 oh yes by the way do not be afraid because 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.730
 even in this luffy game has the hac 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.620
 hilairois which makes it well published 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.330
 sense since as soon as it activates 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.520
 they instantly activate the geer 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.140
 seconds so that really makes it 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.540
 significantly more powerful than you can 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:40.470
 see on screen in defense absolutely 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:41.940
 everyone is impressive 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.590
 so we did a little bit around 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.690
 the demo we went around 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.209
 special attacks from the ofii as you 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.770
 you could see he only has two 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:52.050
 special attacks but I repeat 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:54.420
 again this is only the demo is 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:57.000
 in the full version of the game the fit 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.709
 will have more special attack I 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.510
 think he will have four levels of 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:00.989
 special attacks 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.700
 now what are we going to do 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:05.870
 it's that they lost through forgiveness 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:07.970
 playable characters 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:11.060
 so there is like in pirates warriors 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.299
 1 the complete crew of the hats of 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.500
 Straw 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:18.470
 there will be in cock white beard s and jim 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:22.669
 b to note that the crew in the hat of 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:24.620
 straw will be present both before 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:25.810
 two we are after two years 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:29.270
 drive 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:34.160
 then you add to that trafalgar 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:39.949
 water smoker peronnas black beard marco 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:42.620
 nerve station set crocodile baggy kuma 

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:45.169
 and the admirals kizaru aoki dgi and 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.910
 welcome us so here is the list 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:49.129
 is still pretty wide of 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:51.439
 characters 

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:52.999
 but obviously that does not miss a lot of 

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:55.129
 characters there I told you the 

00:04:52.999 --> 00:04:57.050
 characters that are playable and to my 

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:59.059
 notice and risk of doing as they have 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:01.599
 done with all with naruto 

00:04:59.059 --> 00:05:03.679
 he certainly risks doing a 

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:05.419
 next one piece and there to put 

00:05:03.679 --> 00:05:06.169
 many more characters 

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:07.999
 playable 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:11.059
 in my opinion they deliberately put 

00:05:07.999 --> 00:05:12.619
 this number of characters for us 

00:05:11.059 --> 00:05:15.050
 book a little surprise for the 

00:05:12.619 --> 00:05:17.089
 next one piece so in any case 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:19.459
 I hope this way of having you 

00:05:17.089 --> 00:05:22.849
 presented the luffy attacks you will have 

00:05:19.459 --> 00:05:25.129
 more editing will no longer have a lot of 

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:28.099
 time even though I did a little bit 

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:29.599
 as and when editing but 

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:31.669
 good it will have taken me a lot of 

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:32.959
 time so for that I hope it 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:35.569
 you will be pleased if this is the case do not hesitate 

00:05:32.959 --> 00:05:37.339
 not to put a gem commented that 

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:38.869
 you think a little bit of the game and to 

00:05:37.339 --> 00:05:41.449
 subscribe if it's not already done 

00:05:38.869 --> 00:05:43.069
 and then on my side next time 

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:45.110
 I will do a video on this game again 

00:05:43.069 --> 00:05:46.849
 will be during the let's play thank you 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:49.389
 a lot of watching this video 

00:05:46.849 --> 00:05:49.389
 ciao
