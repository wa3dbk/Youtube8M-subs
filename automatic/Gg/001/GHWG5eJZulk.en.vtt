00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:13.814
Hello, dear friends! We are now in Moscow Cyber Stadium and unfortunately for our team the tournament is over. 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.720
But not for all – game still behind.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:29.680
Actually, tournament went for us not quite well. Especially the first day was the extremely failure, so to say. 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:40.620
We were not lucky, that in the first day we played against main competitors, for opposition to such strong teams we had two decisive games.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:53.280
Many were not satisfied, but considering that this is a first tournament for the team, in the second day we played quite good, I would say so. But in the first day it was a complete failure. 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:04.080
We are very dissatisfied with results, especially of our first match in tournament against Moscow Five – it was a fiasco.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:10.140
Surely we played not well against Na`Vi.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:26.640
But during the tournament we recovered a little, the game became more adjusted, but it unfortunately was not enough to get into the playoff.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:32.380
Ivan, you possibly want to add something or share your opinion about the tournament?

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:48.140
Yep. Concerning the first day, it was a failure. Nothing we worked on and practiced worked.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.520
We were simply losing games on the stage non-stop.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:04.380
Here CIS teams destroyed all the heroes, with which we have overplayed stronger teams at trainings.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.860
It is a failure, my friends.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:25.320
On the second day we just wanted to get into the playoff, to play Best of 3 games, therefore we decided to play more standard than slow DAOT. And we did it well. 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:33.380
We won against a Goblack team and played well against Empire team, which overplayed everyone in this tournament. 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:40.300
Against them, we played confidently and well just because we played the DOTA, where everything is played.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:49.620
This is not good for us, because if we want to achieve a success, we need to find our unique style and stick to it.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.500
 Andrew?

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.980
Thanks, Ivan! It were good words, I completely agree.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:13.060
An I hope in the future we will please you, the results will improve and there will be no such annoying fiasco’s, when we do not even get into the tournament playoffs, in matches of Best of 3. 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.080
Thank you for your support!

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.800
Thank you for your support! 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:35.980
