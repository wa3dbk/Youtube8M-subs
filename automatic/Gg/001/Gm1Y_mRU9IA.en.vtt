00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
if we can do the three blocks out there

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.150 
if we can do the three blocks out there
we<00:03:17.660> go

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.220 

yeah<00:03:21.730> hit<00:03:22.150> right<00:03:22.360> at<00:03:22.450> the<00:03:22.510> apex<00:03:22.750> of<00:03:22.840> results

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
yeah hit right at the apex of results

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:24.210 
yeah hit right at the apex of results
where<00:03:23.320> you'll<00:03:23.410> fall<00:03:23.590> down<00:03:23.620> the<00:03:23.950> other<00:03:24.070> thing

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
where you'll fall down the other thing

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.740 
where you'll fall down the other thing
you<00:03:24.400> do<00:03:24.550> is<00:03:24.760> kill<00:03:24.970> the<00:03:25.120> third<00:03:25.270> block<00:03:25.480> and

those got getting away for that Oh screw
that<00:03:32.110> up<00:03:32.230> you<00:03:32.440> can't<00:03:32.650> make<00:03:32.800> that<00:03:32.950> in<00:03:33.070> your

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
that up you can't make that in your

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:41.460 
that up you can't make that in your
first<00:03:33.310> jump<00:03:33.610> but<00:03:36.240> now<00:03:37.240> I<00:03:37.270> have<00:03:37.570> to<00:03:37.720> do<00:03:38.550> this<00:03:40.470> you

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
first jump but now I have to do this you

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:42.510 
first jump but now I have to do this you
have<00:03:41.500> to<00:03:41.590> get<00:03:41.740> that<00:03:41.830> three<00:03:42.040> blocks<00:03:42.280> up<00:03:42.490> here

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:42.520 
have to get that three blocks up here

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.260 
have to get that three blocks up here
with<00:03:42.880> the<00:03:43.000> running<00:03:43.390> start<00:03:44.790> kind<00:03:45.790> of<00:03:45.940> tricky

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:46.270 
with the running start kind of tricky

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:50.400 
with the running start kind of tricky
because<00:03:47.020> I<00:03:47.350> need<00:03:47.560> the<00:03:47.770> key<00:03:47.950> this<00:03:48.190> to<00:03:48.370> the<00:03:48.460> right

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
because I need the key this to the right

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.570 
because I need the key this to the right
there<00:03:51.010> we<00:03:51.100> go<00:03:52.470> let's<00:03:53.470> get<00:03:53.620> life<00:03:53.890> ready<00:03:54.220> but<00:03:54.550> I

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:54.580 
there we go let's get life ready but I

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.120 
there we go let's get life ready but I
think<00:03:54.790> I<00:03:54.880> might<00:03:55.060> need<00:03:55.270> it<00:03:55.420> on<00:03:55.900> Ocean<00:03:56.440> it's<00:03:56.950> just

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
think I might need it on Ocean it's just

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.270 
think I might need it on Ocean it's just
policies<00:03:58.000> to<00:03:58.180> jump<00:03:58.570> correct

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
policies to jump correct

that<00:04:11.530> trick<00:04:11.620> before<00:04:11.800> it's<00:04:12.130> kind<00:04:12.340> of<00:04:12.430> cheap<00:04:12.610> I

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
that trick before it's kind of cheap I

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.100 
that trick before it's kind of cheap I
think<00:04:14.110> I<00:04:14.290> like<00:04:14.560> the<00:04:14.740> real<00:04:15.130> way<00:04:15.340> but

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:16.110 
think I like the real way but

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:19.229 
think I like the real way but
you<00:04:17.110> know<00:04:17.260> what<00:04:17.350> I<00:04:17.440> mean<00:04:17.920> no<00:04:18.910> well<00:04:19.060> there<00:04:19.180> you

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
you know what I mean no well there you

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.380 
you know what I mean no well there you
go<00:04:19.360> so<00:04:20.140> left<00:04:20.380> is<00:04:20.560> the<00:04:20.650> boss<00:04:20.800> right<00:04:21.160> is<00:04:21.310> the<00:04:21.550> raft

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:22.390 
go so left is the boss right is the raft

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:25.440 
go so left is the boss right is the raft
so<00:04:22.780> let's<00:04:23.260> go<00:04:23.380> right<00:04:23.970> I'll<00:04:24.970> probably<00:04:25.150> meet<00:04:25.390> you

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
so let's go right I'll probably meet you

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.800 
so let's go right I'll probably meet you
back<00:04:25.660> this<00:04:25.810> elevator<00:04:26.260> after<00:04:26.500> peeling<00:04:27.810> off

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
back this elevator after peeling off

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.140 
back this elevator after peeling off
screen<00:04:29.140> and<00:04:29.350> such<00:04:29.530> so<00:04:30.100> so<00:04:30.580> that's<00:04:30.700> the<00:04:30.940> key

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
screen and such so so that's the key

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.470 
screen and such so so that's the key
turning<00:04:31.780> point<00:04:32.110> basically<00:04:33.300> pretty<00:04:34.300> linear

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:34.480 
turning point basically pretty linear
