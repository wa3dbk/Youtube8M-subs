00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
up with four sets of plates making up

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.680 
up with four sets of plates making up
one<00:01:46.340> bundle<00:01:47.890> this<00:01:48.890> allows<00:01:49.520> you<00:01:49.790> to<00:01:49.970> have<00:01:50.210> on

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
of protection so it's much better than

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.020 
of protection so it's much better than
wrapping<00:01:57.080> them<00:01:57.380> individually<00:01:58.160> once<00:01:58.820> your

plate in the center and then fold our

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.450 
plate in the center and then fold our
paper<00:03:05.670> over<00:03:06.680> however<00:03:07.680> because<00:03:08.100> these<00:03:08.280> are

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:08.460 
paper over however because these are

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.430 
paper over however because these are
smaller<00:03:08.850> we<00:03:09.090> will<00:03:09.270> be<00:03:09.420> able<00:03:09.570> to<00:03:09.810> conserve<00:03:10.410> a

smaller we will be able to conserve a

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.490 
smaller we will be able to conserve a
little<00:03:10.590> paper<00:03:11.070> by<00:03:11.730> adding<00:03:12.330> a<00:03:12.570> sheet<00:03:13.110> of<00:03:13.320> paper

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
little paper by adding a sheet of paper

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.150

with<00:03:13.860> every<00:03:14.220> other<00:03:14.750> plate<00:03:15.750> so<00:03:16.500> here<00:03:16.800> we'll<00:03:16.980> go

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
with every other plate so here we'll go

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.900 
with every other plate so here we'll go
here<00:03:17.580> and<00:03:18.290> we'll<00:03:19.290> alternate<00:03:19.860> by<00:03:20.400> adding

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
here and we'll alternate by adding

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.080 
here and we'll alternate by adding
plates<00:03:21.240> and<00:03:21.630> then<00:03:22.530> adding<00:03:22.980> sheets<00:03:23.640> of<00:03:23.850> paper

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090

that we have pull the box which are
glasses<00:04:19.290> if<00:04:20.290> you<00:04:20.470> do<00:04:20.620> have<00:04:20.889> stemmed<00:04:21.370> glasses

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
glasses if you do have stemmed glasses

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.900 
glasses if you do have stemmed glasses
the<00:04:22.270> way<00:04:22.389> we<00:04:22.540> handle<00:04:22.900> those<00:04:23.080> is<00:04:23.590> by<00:04:23.979> wrapping

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
the way we handle those is by wrapping

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.110 
the way we handle those is by wrapping
them<00:04:25.300> once<00:04:25.600> and<00:04:26.290> at<00:04:27.130> this<00:04:27.280> point<00:04:27.580> letting<00:04:28.030> a

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
them once and at this point letting a

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.820 
them once and at this point letting a
lot<00:04:28.300> of<00:04:28.479> air<00:04:28.720> go<00:04:29.110> around<00:04:29.680> the<00:04:29.860> step<00:04:31.590> so<00:04:32.590> not

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
lot of air go around the step so not

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.190 
lot of air go around the step so not
wrapping<00:04:33.310> this<00:04:33.430> them<00:04:33.700> actually<00:04:34.150> tightly<00:04:34.630> now

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:35.200 
wrapping this them actually tightly now

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.100 
wrapping this them actually tightly now
the<00:04:35.260> second<00:04:35.950> time<00:04:36.100> we<00:04:36.280> wrap<00:04:36.490> it<00:04:36.720> we<00:04:37.720> just<00:04:37.930> wrap

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
the second time we wrap it we just wrap

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:43.200 
the second time we wrap it we just wrap
them<00:04:38.260> right<00:04:38.470> up<00:04:38.650> like<00:04:38.860> it<00:04:39.010> was<00:04:39.039> a<00:04:39.130> cylinder<00:04:42.210> now

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
them right up like it was a cylinder now

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:45.420 
them right up like it was a cylinder now
that<00:04:43.450> air<00:04:43.750> gap<00:04:44.020> is<00:04:44.289> actually<00:04:44.470> protecting<00:04:45.310> the

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
that air gap is actually protecting the

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.400 
that air gap is actually protecting the
stem<00:04:45.669> of<00:04:45.940> the<00:04:46.090> glass<00:04:46.120> so<00:04:46.990> we're<00:04:47.110> going<00:04:47.229> to<00:04:47.289> do

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
stem of the glass so we're going to do

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.650 
stem of the glass so we're going to do
that<00:04:47.590> we<00:04:47.860> have<00:04:48.010> our<00:04:48.160> little<00:04:48.340> package<00:04:48.820> going<00:04:49.539> to

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:49.660 
that we have our little package going to

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.620 
that we have our little package going to
stand<00:04:49.930> it<00:04:50.080> up<00:04:50.289> vertically<00:04:51.010> enough<00:04:51.580> in<00:04:52.150> the<00:04:52.389> Box

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:52.630 
stand it up vertically enough in the Box

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:55.320 
stand it up vertically enough in the Box
we<00:04:53.050> do<00:04:53.260> not<00:04:53.470> lay<00:04:53.710> wine<00:04:53.979> glasses<00:04:54.280> on<00:04:54.610> their<00:04:54.760> side

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
we do not lay wine glasses on their side

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.050 
we do not lay wine glasses on their side
you<00:04:55.630> want<00:04:55.840> them<00:04:56.020> to<00:04:56.220> started<00:04:57.220> from<00:04:57.729> top<00:04:58.030> to

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060 
you want them to started from top to

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.180 
you want them to started from top to
bottom<00:04:58.240> so<00:04:59.050> now<00:04:59.260> we're<00:04:59.440> going<00:04:59.530> to<00:04:59.620> move<00:04:59.740> on<00:04:59.950> to
