when I heard the news of this I was
pretty<00:01:13.860> apathetic<00:01:14.250> that's<00:01:15.060> just<00:01:15.299> me

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
pretty apathetic that's just me

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.359 
pretty apathetic that's just me
personally<00:01:15.479> I'm<00:01:16.320> sure<00:01:16.590> they'll<00:01:16.799> sell<00:01:17.009> quite<00:01:17.340> a

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
personally I'm sure they'll sell quite a

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.460 
personally I'm sure they'll sell quite a
bit<00:01:17.610> of<00:01:17.700> these<00:01:17.820> digital<00:01:18.240> copies<00:01:18.689> but<00:01:19.170> I<00:01:19.200> won't

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
bit of these digital copies but I won't

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.230 
bit of these digital copies but I won't
be<00:01:19.619> dropping<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.130> cash<00:01:20.310> on<00:01:20.580> it<00:01:20.759> I<00:01:20.820> guess<00:01:21.060> the

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
be dropping the cash on it I guess the

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.030 
be dropping the cash on it I guess the
perk<00:01:21.450> of<00:01:21.600> purchasing<00:01:22.200> this<00:01:22.470> would<00:01:22.799> be<00:01:22.920> to

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
perk of purchasing this would be to

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.649 
perk of purchasing this would be to
easily<00:01:23.189> put<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.790> movies<00:01:24.090> on<00:01:24.240> your<00:01:24.330> mobile

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
easily put the movies on your mobile

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.870 
easily put the movies on your mobile
devices<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.409> always<00:01:26.100> having<00:01:26.340> them<00:01:26.610> at<00:01:26.729> your

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
devices and always having them at your

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.060 
devices and always having them at your
disposal<00:01:27.270> through<00:01:27.780> your<00:01:28.259> account<00:01:28.710> with<00:01:28.920> these

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
disposal through your account with these

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.280 
disposal through your account with these
retailers<00:01:29.670> so<00:01:30.150> I<00:01:30.180> can<00:01:30.390> see<00:01:30.600> buying<00:01:30.869> them<00:01:31.110> for

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
retailers so I can see buying them for

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.810 
retailers so I can see buying them for
that<00:01:31.500> reason<00:01:31.890> but<00:01:32.130> I<00:01:32.189> personally<00:01:32.610> don't

but I won't be making the purchase from

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.399 
but I won't be making the purchase from
a<00:01:44.490> historic<00:01:45.000> sense<00:01:45.299> this<00:01:45.810> is<00:01:45.990> pretty<00:01:46.200> awesome

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
a historic sense this is pretty awesome

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.560 
a historic sense this is pretty awesome
streaming<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.369> digital<00:01:47.700> copies<00:01:48.090> of<00:01:48.240> movies

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
streaming and digital copies of movies

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.139 
streaming and digital copies of movies
is<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:49.200> future<00:01:49.619> so<00:01:50.130> while<00:01:50.430> they<00:01:50.640> might<00:01:51.090> not

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
is the future so while they might not

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.630 
is the future so while they might not
see<00:01:51.630> sales<00:01:51.960> hit<00:01:52.320> their<00:01:52.560> anticipated<00:01:53.220> marks

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
see sales hit their anticipated marks

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.460 
see sales hit their anticipated marks
when<00:01:53.850> this<00:01:54.000> becomes<00:01:54.360> available<00:01:54.630> I'd<00:01:55.259> be

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
when this becomes available I'd be

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.929 
when this becomes available I'd be
willing<00:01:55.770> to<00:01:55.799> guess<00:01:56.040> that<00:01:56.219> sales<00:01:56.549> will<00:01:56.820> be

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
willing to guess that sales will be

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.670 
willing to guess that sales will be
pretty<00:01:57.240> steady<00:01:57.689> over<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.110> next<00:01:58.409> few<00:01:58.649> years

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
pretty steady over the next few years

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.940 
pretty steady over the next few years
and<00:01:59.369> even<00:01:59.670> decades<00:01:59.820> as<00:02:00.570> digital<00:02:01.409> movies

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
and even decades as digital movies

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.010 
and even decades as digital movies
become<00:02:02.280> more<00:02:02.549> and<00:02:02.640> more<00:02:02.729> than<00:02:03.060> normal<00:02:03.270> so<00:02:03.840> it's

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
become more and more than normal so it's

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.359 
become more and more than normal so it's
kind<00:02:04.259> of<00:02:04.320> an<00:02:04.439> investment<00:02:04.979> for<00:02:05.219> these

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
kind of an investment for these

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.340 
kind of an investment for these
retailers<00:02:05.909> and<00:02:05.969> I'm<00:02:06.540> sure<00:02:06.810> it<00:02:06.990> will<00:02:07.079> pay<00:02:07.320> off
