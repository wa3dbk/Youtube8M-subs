00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:04.260
 and this can be caused by something so subtle 

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:07.260
 a deviation in the currents of the 

00:00:11.149 --> 00:00:14.399
 a tip can be initiated by constant temperature variation 

00:00:14.399 --> 00:00:16.669
 between cold and hot 

00:00:16.669 --> 00:00:19.249
 for decades 

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:24.509
 paradoxically while the southern regions are warmer than the northern and 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:26.589
 they get colder 

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:31.399
 some experts estimated a 5 degree drop in average 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:34.130
 winter of some areas 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.130
 as a result winter storms would paralyze German 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:39.500
 the dental pose 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.420
 low temperatures would hit the coast 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.630
 the western united states 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:46.180
 snowstorms 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.330
 strong winds would punish new york 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.270
 temperatures will follow 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:54.140
 both with five 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.140
 the most severe winter force in history 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.980
 the merciless winter persisted 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.590
 and the blizzards would cover 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:04.760
 all the northeast coast 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.760
 this united states 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.830
 we have to go on pure 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.090
 months of glacial and endless temperatures 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.320
 the cold and humid winters of 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.930
 would become a series of deadly snowstorms 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.930
 would be frozen compared to what it was 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.010
 would be a relic covered with snow 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:27.430
 the scientists 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.430
 What is this sudden? 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.090
 can happen during 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.090
 our existence 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.170
 still sad 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.170
 a country that is a fetish 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.190
 Ironically 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.510
 can cause not only almost artificial conditions 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:58.770
 only creating a

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.040
 desert conditions and more severe storms by 1 to 1 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.040
 the regions 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.319
 - the speed of climate change envisaged for the forthcoming 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.169
 decade 

00:02:15.169 --> 00:02:19.309
 predictable changes that will make the life-threatening impact 

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:24.569
 since 1993 when there is an intention to transmit 

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:26.450
 on that day the study 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:27.839
 before serving 

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:29.439
 14 years 

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:32.439
 even though I was unfaithful with hearing acuity 

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:36.559
 I believe a lot in this new world 

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:39.329
 it is true that they so desire 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:41.510
 the industrial heitor was ready not to 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.510
 practice petty thefts 

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:48.639
 time to get 

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:50.019
 or recover 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:52.919
 this can be a

 one of the drivers a Ferrari in the offices and bruno miner 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:06.729
 this rapid change in climate has happened before scientists love you 

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:10.299
 abrupt climate change

 monica beans in the middle of the season when she no longer had in mind 

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:22.349
 one of the most violent examples of this climate change 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:26.129
 or before the advent of modern civilization
