00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.490
 a beautiful and ipad comes with 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.629
 Last deadline and run yes and it was 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.200
 time again 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:13.200
 I was shopping at H &amp; M's bag 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.269
 to the top full money shopped like 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.220
 hitler and a shopping wood I can 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.570
 also understand why because you are everywhere 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.250
 just a skin-tight for disposal 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.560
 has, the isi go in, I believe 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.330
 I do that every two weeks that I do 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.070
 there are new things bought attempts 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.650
 maybe even a business outfit 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.789
 put together at h &amp; m and stuff like that 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.529
 writes in the comments and inputs 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.000
 the thumbs up if you like me 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.950
 really have found so cool things 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.870
 in the end something where you vote yourself 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.879
 should I give that back or 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.350
 not i think i have it everytime 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.510
 When shopping a thing where I am 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.860
 am sure and I'll leave you now in 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.820
 So I decide to get this thing where 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.350
 I am not sure and you are allowed 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.370
 say they go back or not but in 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.350
 The case is definitely on something 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.090
 funny ok with what I start 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.059
 Although I start with a short pants 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:57.149
 still be wearing shorts I want 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:04.439
 you he indeed show undistributed 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:07.740
 what is this here so i would the 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.939
 personally roll up as you see it 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.430
 now the whole thing is going to happen to you too 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.990
 I think that's a bit cooler 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.110
 is elastic the stretching 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.780
 which is 24 eur 99 I have the 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.009
 Biggest size taken 36 if you have the 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.450
 wants to wear a little bit closer 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:26.009
 of course you take on 37 34 so yes 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.659

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.270

 the jeans look is a bit darker too 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.670
 and the black hood on the hood 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.899

 I always talked about it 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:54.239
 highmark eminem video seen amounts 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.370

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.470

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:06.030
 Of course you sweat completely 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.989
 nice if you do my sport na 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.760
 yes that's cotton 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.109
 that you have to raft in any case 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.639
 wash once you know that when 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:12.750
 He is at the sport side and you have yourselves 

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:14.970
 bought something new but not yet 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.760
 washed and polished cd out of everything 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.989
 fluff all face i know it up 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.519
 any case because I'm such an idiot 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.660
 pinter does that pretty often without 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.519
 example yes I know you should 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.230
 wash things before but sometimes i am 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:26.700
 I offered to dress that so 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.030
 I can not wait for it now 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.829
 to wash 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.630
 In any case, we come back to 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:32.010
 this pants with the zipper me 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.169
 I think is also relatively high quality 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.599
 would you ask for sport now 

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:38.459
 But you can also wear it outside 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:40.349
 relax a bit often 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:42.440
 I think I'm cool 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:45.780
 then I got some socks 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:47.669
 Here are some couple I'll show you the times 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.940
 here just so different 

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:52.410
 look at it with points and things like that 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.940
 I have only to apply those 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.739
 I 'm just that and now 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.230
 while being rolled up so pants and that 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:59.160
 you see the socks because I will 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.590
 I now believe in between times 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.419
 Try if it's not really cool 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.010
 we come to the very last part yes and 

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:05.760
 Now you are asked and not now 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.110
 everyone directly long 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.390
 it does not seem to be direct 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:14.579
 embed it okay and that's it 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:15.989
 yoga suit attention okay yeah me 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:18.180
 I may also find myself now 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:19.650
 I walked by and I 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.530
 I have to say that somehow I thought so 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:25.680
 funny with the applications on it 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:27.180
 with the drinks and hott and fries 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.370
 and actually thought so with mcfit 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.919
 Entering is especially you actually 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.630
 so ironic ever he is now 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:35.280
 here is definitely cozy 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.419
 so if you are in the 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.710
 comments I write him 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:39.750
 then keep it then say it 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.340
 I will be my next wieloch shopping 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.139
 okay that was my next one 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.340
 shoppingtour yes where i am for you 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:46.620
 I will make a public appearance 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.820
 then if in that call tolerate 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.889
 he now says that I should keep that 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:51.750
 but already the comments to 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:54.360
 drew yes or no and your opinion clear 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.949
 it's just always the bow that is 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.970
 shrill I think it's funny too 

00:04:55.949 --> 00:04:58.530
 to have things 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:00.330
 not everybody has them now and they do not 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:01.979
 always meet the standard and I think 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.180
 who knows me I know I do not take 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:04.289
 seriously, that's why I still have it here 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.280
 otherwise I would have him right away 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:06.900
 so let it be not 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.010
 I excluded him too 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.300
 would keep if I again 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:10.830
 but think about it for two nights 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.419
 that's the way you have it, but that's how it is 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.110
 Community likes to write in the
