00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 Hello to you Denis healthier mountain 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:08.610
 Section of information you today an overview of sleeping 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.660
 bag with synthetic insulation in 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.290
 saiberia 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:16.160
 excel from company new tour this sleeping 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:19.380
 bag from our Baikal expedition 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.150
 sleeping bag size xl because the owner 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.990
 its size is xl 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:27.869
 and at times even 2xl in this 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.640
 his and main feature is long 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.630
 sleeping bag two hundred thirty 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.430
 centimeters that easily allows 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:38.219
 accommodate in it even a 2-meter y 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.350
 human width at the shoulders, too, 90 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.730
 centimeters and so if your weight 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.980
 more than 100 kilograms you too 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:51.180
 stay comfortably declared weight 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:54.719
 he has 18 kilograms and temperature 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.789
 comfort -5 degrees and let's curtain 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.109
 him 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:05.760
 let's see how much weight 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:11.760
 true to reality so we see 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:16.040
 weight we kilogram 900 grams kilogram 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:20.159
 900 grams with packaging 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:24.119
 together with hermetic bag well besides this 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:27.390
 sleeping bag was exactly with us in the campaign 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:31.680
 so perhaps it is still hiking 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:34.020
 moisture accumulated well in my opinion 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.659
 quite consistent with the stated 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.579
 characteristics well so a little bit there on 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:43.680
 100 grams exceeds but it can be 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:47.040
 the accuracy of the scales and the fact that the manufacturer 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.950
 measures weight without bag 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.590
 maybe just condensate which 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.560
 accumulated inside 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:57.530
 get out of the bag and see first 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:01.180
 reds such on ko. 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:03.610
 colorful sleeping bags on a beautiful 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:06.460
 probably just the designer and tried 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:09.640
 make him so not just cuddly 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:14.320
 but also a beautiful lightning has a two-lock 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:17.260
 and note that the lower dog even 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:20.520
 stopper that is, you can open the bottom 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.840
 part so that the legs were not so hot and 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.270
 fix and the zipper won't crawl up 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.340
 but the top dog for some reason 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.770
 set without stoker although in my opinion 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.959
 could also put it with a brake 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:34.300
 it would be more comfortable 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:39.010
 open a sleeping bag to a certain 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:41.560
 states of course up lightning 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:46.480
 Velcro is fixed here is such a 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:49.290
 round probably by design so 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:53.320
 fits and there is even a reflective 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:56.800
 striped downy bag downy bag 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:59.200
 fastened with buttons and shoulder 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.600
 shoulder pack not down sorry 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.270
 and draws some string 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.970
 the caliber of the cord is thick enough 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:10.330
 such a massive hardware in my opinion 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:12.489
 best recommendation to the manufacturer such 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:15.580
 if he looks and I'm sure that he is 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:18.280
 does replace here this lace on 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.850
 some kind of thin rubber and small 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.590
 fittings with a few grams saved and 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.670
 there will be more comfort with rubber 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:28.980
 pocket 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:31.840
 here is a pocket without fastener 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.880
 without any fastener just 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:38.950
 Here is such a carabiner here 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:41.530
 I did not know a giant pocket with a mesh 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:44.829
 its existence is possible 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:47.620
 to lay down everything even 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:49.600
 even socks can be shoved for lovers 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:54.340
 put socks in a sleeping bag and there they are 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:58.510
 dry thermal performance i 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:04:01.930
 I know for sure that they are like this 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:03.820
 the above stated very much praised 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.010
 this sleeping bag but only already in 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:08.890
 the size of the misha wolves 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:11.980
 my friend he walked with him in the top five in 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:13.330
 Pamir and says that it is better 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.959
 general sleeping bag 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:17.560
 or I myself prefer downy sleeping 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:22.060
 bags 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:25.240
 although many choose precisely synthetics 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:28.860
 explaining that so well, they say wet 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:31.360
 condensate conditions easier to dry 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:34.240
 synthetic sleeping bag if 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:38.410
 it gets wet anyway keeps warming 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:42.850
 Well, if you think so please 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:45.490
 it's your choice my opinion if you if 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:50.100
 your sleeping bag gets wet then 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:54.040
 you need a new tent and not some 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:56.560
 synthetic sleeping bag like that 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:05:00.550
