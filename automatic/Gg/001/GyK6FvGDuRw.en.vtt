to be anything founded here yet but
there's<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.560> bit<00:01:25.680> of<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:25.830> room<00:01:26.009> at<00:01:26.190> the<00:01:26.220> top<00:01:26.460> side

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
there's a bit of a room at the top side

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.090 
there's a bit of a room at the top side
