two bags pretty much identical but the

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.030 
two bags pretty much identical but the
placement<00:01:51.869> will<00:01:51.960> be<00:01:52.049> slightly<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.530> off<00:01:52.680> or

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
placement will be slightly to off or

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.490 
placement will be slightly to off or
slightly<00:01:53.310> different<00:01:53.880> so<00:01:54.689> I<00:01:54.720> like<00:01:55.079> this<00:01:55.259> bag

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500
