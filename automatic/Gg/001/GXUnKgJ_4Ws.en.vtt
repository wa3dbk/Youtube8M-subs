as traumatic things that might happen in
our<00:00:58.530> life<00:00:59.870> the<00:01:00.870> energy<00:01:01.289> flow<00:01:01.559> then<00:01:01.859> gets

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
our life the energy flow then gets

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.189 
our life the energy flow then gets
blocked<00:01:02.550> just<00:01:03.030> like<00:01:03.210> a<00:01:03.239> clot<00:01:03.750> in<00:01:03.780> your

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
blocked just like a clot in your

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.469 
blocked just like a clot in your
circulation<00:01:04.890> system<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.400> so<00:01:06.030> it<00:01:06.210> blocks

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
circulation system and so it blocks

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.719 
circulation system and so it blocks
energy<00:01:06.990> going<00:01:07.229> ahead<00:01:07.560> of<00:01:07.680> it<00:01:07.830> or<00:01:08.100> it<00:01:08.220> dams<00:01:08.490> it

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
energy going ahead of it or it dams it

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.300 
energy going ahead of it or it dams it
up<00:01:08.850> behind<00:01:09.180> it<00:01:09.540> can<00:01:10.020> lead<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.500> illnesses<00:01:11.100> in

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
up behind it can lead to illnesses in

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.550 
up behind it can lead to illnesses in
your<00:01:11.460> mental<00:01:11.670> physical<00:01:12.119> spiritual

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560

what this class does this is an

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.690 
what this class does this is an
introductory<00:01:16.899> class<00:01:17.290> for<00:01:17.530> the<00:01:17.649> owner<00:01:17.920> and<00:01:18.369> a

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
introductory class for the owner and a

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.120 
introductory class for the owner and a
dog<00:01:18.939> we<00:01:19.630> have<00:01:19.780> seven<00:01:20.170> students<00:01:20.560> here<00:01:20.799> today

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
dog we have seven students here today

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.730 
dog we have seven students here today
and<00:01:21.460> it's<00:01:21.939> very<00:01:22.240> introductory<00:01:22.750> and<00:01:23.229> we<00:01:23.470> work

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
and it's very introductory and we work

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.450 
and it's very introductory and we work
through<00:01:23.770> different<00:01:24.689> types<00:01:25.689> of<00:01:25.960> flow

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
through different types of flow

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.740 
through different types of flow
different<00:01:27.460> areas<00:01:27.759> of<00:01:27.789> the<00:01:28.030> flow<00:01:28.299> of<00:01:28.329> the<00:01:28.600> body

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
different areas of the flow of the body

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.830 
different areas of the flow of the body
opening<00:01:29.350> up<00:01:29.470> blockages<00:01:30.100> it's<00:01:30.850> very<00:01:31.119> relaxing

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
opening up blockages it's very relaxing

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.820 
opening up blockages it's very relaxing
it<00:01:32.020> helps<00:01:32.320> us<00:01:32.500> release<00:01:33.070> things<00:01:33.429> we<00:01:33.729> hang<00:01:34.030> on<00:01:34.270> to

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830 
it helps us release things we hang on to

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.469 
it helps us release things we hang on to
memories<00:01:35.830> emotions<00:01:36.640> those<00:01:36.970> kind<00:01:37.240> of<00:01:37.270> things

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:37.479 
memories emotions those kind of things

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:40.350 
memories emotions those kind of things
that<00:01:37.720> can<00:01:37.929> lead<00:01:37.960> to<00:01:38.140> blockages<00:01:38.799> so<00:01:39.070> by<00:01:39.850> opening

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
that can lead to blockages so by opening

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.359 
that can lead to blockages so by opening
that<00:01:40.539> up<00:01:40.570> we<00:01:40.960> restore<00:01:41.409> balance<00:01:41.649> and<00:01:42.100> harmony

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:42.369 
that up we restore balance and harmony

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:44.880 
that up we restore balance and harmony
to<00:01:42.640> the<00:01:43.030> systems<00:01:43.450> in<00:01:43.600> our<00:01:43.720> body<00:01:43.960> and<00:01:44.350> then<00:01:44.740> our

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
to the systems in our body and then our

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:46.770 
to the systems in our body and then our
body<00:01:45.070> does<00:01:45.490> the<00:01:45.640> work<00:01:45.789> it<00:01:45.970> needs<00:01:46.149> to<00:01:46.360> do<00:01:46.479> to<00:01:46.630> try

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
body does the work it needs to do to try

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.120 
body does the work it needs to do to try
to<00:01:46.869> you<00:01:47.110> so<00:01:47.920> it's<00:01:48.039> not<00:01:48.100> actually<00:01:48.580> a<00:01:48.610> healing

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
to you so it's not actually a healing

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.919 
to you so it's not actually a healing
modality<00:01:51.130> it's<00:01:51.280> a<00:01:51.429> balancing<00:01:52.090> harmony<00:01:52.689> and

00:01:52.919 --> 00:01:52.929 
modality it's a balancing harmony and

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:56.550 
modality it's a balancing harmony and
then<00:01:53.590> your<00:01:53.920> body<00:01:54.159> does<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:55.750> balancing<00:01:56.350> and

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
then your body does the balancing and

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.179 
then your body does the balancing and
the<00:01:56.590> you<00:01:56.860> know<00:01:56.920> the<00:01:57.130> healing<00:01:57.549> part<00:01:57.850> of<00:01:57.970> that
