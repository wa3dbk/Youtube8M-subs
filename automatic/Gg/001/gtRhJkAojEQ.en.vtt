00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:25.870 
dryer here is electric and so are the

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.380 
dryer here is electric and so are the
lights<00:01:26.110> up<00:01:26.440> there<00:01:26.880> they<00:01:27.880> get<00:01:28.030> their<00:01:28.150> power

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
lights up there they get their power

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.200 
lights up there they get their power
from<00:01:28.450> the<00:01:28.600> utility<00:01:28.750> or<00:01:29.320> the<00:01:29.350> power<00:01:29.950> grid<00:01:30.400> but

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
from the utility or the power grid but

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:32.850 
from the utility or the power grid but
elsewhere<00:01:31.570> on<00:01:31.750> the<00:01:31.869> facility<00:01:32.380> our<00:01:32.560> solar

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
elsewhere on the facility our solar

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.090 
elsewhere on the facility our solar
powers<00:01:33.340> solar<00:01:34.060> panels<00:01:34.479> that<00:01:34.860> generate<00:01:35.860> more

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
powers solar panels that generate more

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.680 
powers solar panels that generate more
electricity<00:01:36.160> and<00:01:36.790> is<00:01:36.910> used<00:01:37.119> here<00:01:37.450> and<00:01:37.600> that

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:37.690 
electricity and is used here and that

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.749 
electricity and is used here and that
electricity<00:01:38.020> is<00:01:38.170> put<00:01:38.350> back<00:01:38.500> on<00:01:38.740> the<00:01:38.860> grid<00:01:39.070> so

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:39.759 
electricity is put back on the grid so

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:41.130 
electricity is put back on the grid so
altogether<00:01:39.970> this<00:01:40.330> facility<00:01:40.810> is<00:01:40.869> a<00:01:40.930> NetZero

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
altogether this facility is a NetZero

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.740 
altogether this facility is a NetZero
user<00:01:41.680> of<00:01:41.950> electricity<00:01:42.360> but<00:01:43.360> as<00:01:43.479> you<00:01:43.600> can<00:01:43.690> see

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
user of electricity but as you can see

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.300 
user of electricity but as you can see
most<00:01:44.050> of<00:01:44.200> the<00:01:44.320> time<00:01:44.500> the<00:01:44.619> lights<00:01:44.800> aren't<00:01:45.009> even

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
most of the time the lights aren't even

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.990 
most of the time the lights aren't even
turned<00:01:45.550> on

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
turned on

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.150 
turned on
instead<00:01:46.570> the<00:01:46.869> walls<00:01:47.140> here<00:01:47.500> are<00:01:47.649> translucent

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:48.160 
instead the walls here are translucent

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.460 
instead the walls here are translucent
which<00:01:49.149> mean<00:01:49.360> we<00:01:49.479> get<00:01:49.600> sunlight<00:01:50.080> through<00:01:50.350> the

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
which mean we get sunlight through the

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.770 
which mean we get sunlight through the
walls<00:01:50.680> and<00:01:51.610> as<00:01:51.790> well<00:01:51.970> as<00:01:52.119> through<00:01:52.330> that<00:01:52.479> mesh

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
walls and as well as through that mesh

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.190 
walls and as well as through that mesh
up<00:01:52.990> there<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.970> there's<00:01:55.270> also<00:01:55.420> skylight<00:01:56.170> up

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
up there and there's also skylight up

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:11.960 
up there and there's also skylight up
there<00:01:56.619> too

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.340 

and<00:02:12.540> see<00:02:12.750> the<00:02:12.900> skylights<00:02:13.680> up<00:02:13.890> there<00:02:14.540> and<00:02:15.540> they

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
and see the skylights up there and they

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:17.600 
and see the skylights up there and they
get<00:02:16.500> their<00:02:16.650> light<00:02:16.830> through<00:02:17.070> that<00:02:17.100> hole<00:02:17.400> in<00:02:17.580> the

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
get their light through that hole in the

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.670 
get their light through that hole in the
roof<00:02:21.170> altogether<00:02:22.170> a<00:02:22.260> pretty<00:02:22.530> nice-looking

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
roof altogether a pretty nice-looking

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.360 
roof altogether a pretty nice-looking
facility<00:02:23.340> pretty<00:02:24.120> good<00:02:24.270> engineering<00:02:24.720> job<00:02:24.900> too

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
facility pretty good engineering job too

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.130
