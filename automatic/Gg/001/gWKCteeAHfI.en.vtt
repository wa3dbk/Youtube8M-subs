00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:06.250
 I was surprised yesterday to study the elimination 

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:08.919
 first times sentence how you felt 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:12.849
 it was crushed practically almost almost 

00:00:08.919 --> 00:00:15.070
 this to applaud you relieved this for 

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:17.500
 a moment I had the sentence but now 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.179
 I feel safe again and once again 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.160

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:23.320
 working and doing it correctly that 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:26.019
 cause you learned thinking that suddenly 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.849
 could leave the competition leave everything 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:33.280

 good one thing to sing well something else 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:43.610
 is to look like another thing is to have the 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:45.810
 gestures and if we follow that by adding 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:47.700
