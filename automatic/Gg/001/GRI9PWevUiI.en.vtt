00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
 chemical weapons a judge remained 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:03.600
 delicate but deserves to be 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:04.470
 interested 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.819
 there were plenty of chemical weapons 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.779
 made during the wars and 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:07.830
 first a picnic for their 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:08.280
 appearance during the first war 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.019
 World 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.400
 and here is a quick overview of these weapons 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.809
 rather vicious they are considered 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.460
 as a weapon of mass destruction and 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.360
 are classified into several categories the 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.580
 neutralizing chemical weapons 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.980
 suffocating neurotoxic and xic motorcycles 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.300
 the toxins and the resident agents that 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.710
 are the worst I think the weapons 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.000
 chemicals can cause death but 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.769
 be careful not death a bullet in the 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.330
 head that's done it's over no we're talking 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.590
 of slow and extremely painful death 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.019
 the bottom palm 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.399
 so yes let's take one to palm for example 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.660
 a chemical weapon from tunisia when not 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.190
 misused during the Vietnam War 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.590
 napalm is a very chemical weapon 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.090
 dangerous invented at harvard in 1942 eh 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.739
 yes invented by the chemist louis 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.160
 frederic greenhouse there are several kinds of 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.180
 napalm 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.530
 at the base it is composed of several 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.940
 chemicals that gives a material 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.170
 incendiary that looks like soap you 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.879
 see it's saying it he was later 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.379
 modified to solidify it make it 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.910
 easier to use this 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.860
 modification turns the napalm into 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.350
 kind of gel that sticks to the audi burns 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.670
 the skin the bones and the muscles stopped his 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.020
 combustion and of course something 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.980
 very difficult and what makes this weapon 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.059
 extremely dangerous 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.949
 it was forbidden 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.739
 use on the population the gas 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.299
 it's a good thing 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.830
 naughty also the mustard gas is also 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.729
 called yperite not badly used during 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.080
 World War I 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.130
 so it's a physical agent in earlier 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.570
 powerful that causes big 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.799
 burns and that forms big blisters 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.119
 on the skin this gas attacks 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.619
 especially the mucous membranes 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.060
 where the skin is wetter like them 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.920
 eyes so there you are direct blind and 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.330
 lips the lungs and so that's fine 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.979
 heard when the lungs are reached 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.930
 it causes edema that causes them 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.130
 death here with a sensation that is 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.020
 closer to that of drowning is 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.280
 nice when I tell you that gas 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.299
 mustard makes glock is not 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.320
 clubs like that at least we are all 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.880
 tickets after a long day of 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.380
 walk no there it's real master 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.130
 club like that you see I did not want to 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.840
 too early because it's still 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.549
 disgusting 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.740
 go a little anyway even liked the 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.450
 weezy 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.189
 not bad it organic compound 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.110
 of arsenic so direct when we 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:46.670
 hears sonic art we think that 1 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.140
 so this chemical weapon is getting closer 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.000
 mustard gas except that it is still 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.600
 more dangerous perfect it works well 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.860
 faster 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.299
 a few minutes are enough for the 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.140
 louis xii gently attack the epidermis 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:55.970
 and mucous membranes 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.229
 decidedly mucous atkins this 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.939
 toxic agent is able to cross 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:00.350
 the boots the coats and even the 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:00.979
 low gas masks from there that is 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.170
 what you want to do 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.939
 I ask you so from lewy says no 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.409
 irritate the nose and burn the skin but 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:09.380
 smell the geranium as this says 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:11.000
 ua poster got back to where the 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.140
 milk or low zid nothing repels and 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.010
 it's true for war places where 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.390
 it was used 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.160
 the lands are completely sterilized 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.180
 nothing after the wars some 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.410
 newspapers even say that this weapon 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.610
 chemical is so dangerous that it 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.269
 would suffice a drop on the skin for 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.799
 kill a human 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:23.150
 that's telling you now let's talk about 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:24.590
 chemical weapons of the neurotoxic type 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.060
 still something good that ligot 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.230
 yeah, listen to that and then you say it 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.880
 if they are not ambitious weapons 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.560
 they are usually colorless odorless 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.880
 without taste disturb the operation 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.799
 muscles of the nervous system 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.880
 extremely deadly I see you 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:36.440
 said it among the agents 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.170
 neurotoxic we can find the meaning 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.940
 before yeah the sahara is a substance 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.500
 extremely dangerous even a whole 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.010
 small dose can be deadly wanted 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.200
 a comparison 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.329
 I have a beautiful sahara is about 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.850
 500 times more toxic than cyanide 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:51.440
 this is after ingestion of the sahara 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.540
 ample of a large secretion of 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.640
 saliva vomiting incontinence like 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.380
 a dead good I imagine that the mind is 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.790
 renewed to all the symptoms at the same 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.200
 time is not a very beautiful picture 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.310
 at first they used as weapons 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.600
 chemicals some time after being 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.140
 considered a weapon of destruction 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.880
 mass 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.859
 you amaze me of sarah is incredibly 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.120
 dangerous in 1952 the 

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:09.920
 British amended it to 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.640
 to make a thousand times more deadly 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.940
 logic 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.620
 it's called gas vx it's gas 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.090
 sahara wholesale but much more dangerous 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.859
 it's a bit difficult to imagine but 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.329
 that's it this one so can in addition 

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:21.769
 spread in water and in the air otherwise 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:23.299
 same absorption as his little brother by 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:24.769
 inhalation or contact with the mouth 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:26.630
 obviously the lethal dose is fine 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:28.190
 lower than sarin gas bx gas 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.990
 attacks the muscles very quickly in 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.190
 few minutes 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:31.210
 on the frontiers of death but first 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.100
 you always have a small panoply 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:35.200
 of symptoms always always very 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.790
 nice a huge muscle tremor 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.340
 sweating tears abundant in the eyes 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.560
 run out of the nose and then boom chaos 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.850
 that's it from my point of view 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.260
 it's a gimmick are the worst 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.490
 painful good vicious and that's 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.840
 by the way it's pretty crazy when we 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:48.370
 was able to use them while knowing 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.660
 what it produces then it's sure it's 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.920
 scientifically sad but I think 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.780
 it is interesting all the same 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.920
 deepen this kind of topic yet 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.090
 once does not hesitate to react in the 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.440
 comments of course anyway 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.730
 I hope you enjoyed this video 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.260
 do not hesitate to share and you 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.340
 subscribe to the channel as for me I you 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.120
 say very soon for a next 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:08.990
 video because science does not wait 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:08.990
