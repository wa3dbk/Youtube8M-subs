00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 hello to our next meetings we 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.000
 we will do a series of videos about 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:06.779
 prayer from church cassism 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.160
 catholic 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.679
 to begin with it is important to say 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.870
 that prayer is the gateway to the 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.839
 faith and who does not live, he said 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.270
 for you and from your own happy force 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.400
 and wish her to be face to face 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.800
 with that one as she will find herself 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.930
 day in eternity but it is important that 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.269
 that one does not learn how to pray as 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.609
 if you learn something technical it seems 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:33.360
 strange to say more crying is a gift that 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.710
 if you learn they are in prayer praying holy 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.750
 Augustine already said that our heart 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.969
 is falling while not resting on 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.030
 God then a way to find the base 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.100
 this godless robot is to exercise with the 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.530
 our heart in prayer even though we 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.260
 we have denied God what we deny 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.110
 God is always willing to listen to us. 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.260
 by prayer and seeks us before we 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:58.050
 let us seek God the password for us god in 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.850
 calls and wants us now does not complicate 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.190
 their prayer life when they 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.530
 we are in solitude in danger only by the 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.400
 fact of putting to God gave already meets 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.640
 to our shelter 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.920
 in short, do not be afraid to purify it 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.799
 prevents the resistance against 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.680
 temptations hour 'strengthens anguish 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:19.470
 for attaining the weakness of our soul 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.960
 prayed to the streets and also makes us 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.030
 happy and what the bishops said about 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.030
 the heart will see santa teresa he 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.700

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.460
 Oh my God, the same store, Alicia, and 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.710
 a wish of schedules is holy prayer 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.509
 agostinho he drew up a phrase that is 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.530
 famous in the Catechism of the Catholic Church 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:42.750
 he said do what you can and pray for 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.479
 what you can not for God to 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.270
 allow you to do the impossible that 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:51.210
 he reminds us that the time is not 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.710
 both a talk but listen to God in 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.259
 silence of our soul and our 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.940
 heart to the great saint teresa of Ã¡vila 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.460
 said 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.830
 The time is to deal with friendship with God. 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.840
 being alone with the one you love and 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.510
 who also know that he loves us 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.370
 That's it, try to look now 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.440
 that it is a rush of thanks and 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:11.780
 supplication in the silence of your heart 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:15.140
 but do with the sincerity of your soul. 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:17.660
 rocker at least hear appeals asking 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.910

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.280
