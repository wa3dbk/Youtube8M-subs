a<00:04:46.750> lot<00:04:47.080> of<00:04:47.169> its<00:04:47.320> appeal<00:04:47.620> because<00:04:47.830> of<00:04:48.370> the<00:04:48.639> way

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820 
a lot of its appeal because of the way

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:52.589 
a lot of its appeal because of the way
that<00:04:49.060> the<00:04:49.240> yarn<00:04:49.599> is<00:04:49.870> been<00:04:50.770> wound<00:04:51.070> and<00:04:51.550> been<00:04:52.389> put

00:04:52.589 --> 00:04:52.599 
that the yarn is been wound and been put

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:54.719 
that the yarn is been wound and been put
together<00:04:52.690> so<00:04:53.410> sometimes<00:04:53.860> I<00:04:54.190> find<00:04:54.430> like

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:54.729 
together so sometimes I find like

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:56.969 
together so sometimes I find like
keeping<00:04:55.060> it<00:04:55.180> less<00:04:55.510> is<00:04:55.720> more<00:04:55.960> and<00:04:56.169> this<00:04:56.710> kind<00:04:56.860> of

00:04:56.969 --> 00:04:56.979 
keeping it less is more and this kind of

00:04:56.979 --> 00:04:59.159 
keeping it less is more and this kind of
idea<00:04:57.160> allows<00:04:57.669> me<00:04:57.940> to<00:04:58.210> have<00:04:58.240> the<00:04:58.630> same<00:04:58.780> artistic

00:04:59.159 --> 00:04:59.169 
idea allows me to have the same artistic

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:01.290 
idea allows me to have the same artistic
value<00:04:59.680> that<00:04:59.889> the<00:05:00.010> actual<00:05:00.160> real<00:05:00.580> yarn<00:05:00.849> ball<00:05:01.090> has

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
value that the actual real yarn ball has

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.750 
value that the actual real yarn ball has
or<00:05:01.780> the<00:05:02.020> real<00:05:02.200> yarns<00:05:02.590> gain<00:05:02.860> and<00:05:03.099> actually

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:03.760 
or the real yarns gain and actually

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.700 
or the real yarns gain and actually
still<00:05:04.000> maintain<00:05:04.419> a<00:05:04.450> lot<00:05:04.810> of<00:05:04.930> creativity<00:05:05.320> and
