you're going to find all the
non-aggressive<00:02:51.709> buildings<00:02:52.250> and<00:02:52.459> then<00:02:52.940> when

non-aggressive buildings and then when

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.970 
non-aggressive buildings and then when

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
you reach the mountain range that's

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.410 
you reach the mountain range that's
where<00:02:55.220> the<00:02:55.310> military<00:02:55.489> is<00:02:55.909> going<00:02:56.060> to<00:02:56.120> be<00:02:56.209> based

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
where the military is going to be based

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:57.970 
where the military is going to be based
where<00:02:57.019> you're<00:02:57.109> going<00:02:57.230> to<00:02:57.290> find<00:02:57.319> the<00:02:57.530> walls<00:02:57.739> the

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
where you're going to find the walls the

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.860 
where you're going to find the walls the
towers<00:02:58.370> the<00:02:58.549> barracks<00:02:58.940> the<00:02:59.450> archery<00:02:59.840> range

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
towers the barracks the archery range

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.050 
towers the barracks the archery range
and<00:03:00.349> it's<00:03:00.890> just<00:03:01.099> basically<00:03:01.459> going<00:03:01.640> to<00:03:01.730> expand

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
and it's just basically going to expand

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.089 
and it's just basically going to expand
the<00:03:02.239> gradually<00:03:02.690> so<00:03:03.500> you<00:03:03.620> think<00:03:03.680> about<00:03:03.859> the

00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:04.099 
the gradually so you think about the

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:05.650 
the gradually so you think about the
city<00:03:04.280> of<00:03:04.459> Gondor<00:03:04.970> from<00:03:05.239> Lord<00:03:05.450> of<00:03:05.510> the<00:03:05.569> Rings

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
city of Gondor from Lord of the Rings

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.050 
city of Gondor from Lord of the Rings
the<00:03:06.049> city<00:03:06.950> actually<00:03:07.220> just<00:03:07.609> gradually

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
the city actually just gradually

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.899 
the city actually just gradually
increases<00:03:08.810> in<00:03:08.989> levels<00:03:09.680> so<00:03:10.220> that's<00:03:10.400> kind<00:03:10.790> of

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:10.909 
increases in levels so that's kind of

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:12.130 
increases in levels so that's kind of
what<00:03:11.030> I<00:03:11.060> want<00:03:11.239> to<00:03:11.299> aim<00:03:11.420> for<00:03:11.450> just<00:03:11.989> in<00:03:12.079> a

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
what I want to aim for just in a

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.479 
what I want to aim for just in a
different<00:03:12.260> style<00:03:15.129> so<00:03:16.129> there's<00:03:16.280> still<00:03:16.400> an

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
different style so there's still an

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:18.099 
different style so there's still an
endless<00:03:16.909> amounts<00:03:17.269> of<00:03:17.269> possibilities<00:03:17.959> that

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:18.109 
endless amounts of possibilities that

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:19.930 
endless amounts of possibilities that
can<00:03:18.260> be<00:03:18.379> added<00:03:18.680> to<00:03:18.769> this<00:03:18.890> map<00:03:19.129> which<00:03:19.640> is<00:03:19.790> great

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
can be added to this map which is great

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.300 
can be added to this map which is great
fun<00:03:20.209> and<00:03:20.450> this<00:03:20.540> is<00:03:20.690> only<00:03:20.840> part<00:03:21.200> two<00:03:21.530> so<00:03:22.129> there's

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
fun and this is only part two so there's

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.640 
fun and this is only part two so there's
still<00:03:22.370> plenty<00:03:22.730> more<00:03:23.090> videos<00:03:23.420> to<00:03:23.450> come<00:03:23.599> and<00:03:23.930> for

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
still plenty more videos to come and for

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.500 
still plenty more videos to come and for
