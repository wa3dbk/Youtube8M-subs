hi there good evening Steve Kaufman here

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.200 
hi there good evening Steve Kaufman here
today<00:00:05.850> I<00:00:06.180> want<00:00:06.509> to<00:00:06.629> talk<00:00:06.810> about<00:00:06.980> writing

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:08.210 
today I want to talk about writing

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:10.370 
today I want to talk about writing
correction<00:00:09.210> and<00:00:09.510> I<00:00:09.690> think<00:00:09.900> I've<00:00:10.019> talked<00:00:10.230> about

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
correction and I think I've talked about

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.430 
correction and I think I've talked about
it<00:00:10.650> before<00:00:10.679> but<00:00:11.389> the<00:00:12.389> subject<00:00:12.750> has<00:00:12.870> come<00:00:13.080> up<00:00:13.230> at

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
it before but the subject has come up at

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.709 
it before but the subject has come up at
our<00:00:13.620> forum<00:00:14.190> at<00:00:14.340> Linc<00:00:14.610> and<00:00:14.880> so<00:00:15.240> I<00:00:15.269> thought<00:00:15.690> I

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
our forum at Linc and so I thought I

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.930 
our forum at Linc and so I thought I
would<00:00:16.070> would<00:00:17.070> talk<00:00:17.279> about<00:00:17.310> it<00:00:17.609> I<00:00:17.640> was<00:00:17.730> playing

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
would would talk about it I was playing

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.279 
would would talk about it I was playing
golf<00:00:18.090> this<00:00:18.359> afternoon<00:00:18.510> and<00:00:18.960> I<00:00:19.020> was<00:00:19.050> thinking

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
golf this afternoon and I was thinking

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:20.779 
golf this afternoon and I was thinking
about<00:00:19.470> this<00:00:19.770> whole<00:00:19.949> issue<00:00:19.980> of<00:00:20.279> writing

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
about this whole issue of writing

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.109 
about this whole issue of writing
correction<00:00:22.550> there<00:00:23.550> is<00:00:23.670> increasing

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
correction there is increasing

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.070 
correction there is increasing
realization<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:25.939> writing<00:00:26.939> correction<00:00:27.570> in

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
realization the writing correction in

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.519 
realization the writing correction in
terms<00:00:28.439> of<00:00:28.590> improving<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:30.090> accuracy<00:00:30.599> of<00:00:30.900> the

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
terms of improving the accuracy of the

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.479 
terms of improving the accuracy of the
student<00:00:32.070> is<00:00:32.329> largely<00:00:33.329> ineffective<00:00:34.230> and<00:00:34.829> if

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
student is largely ineffective and if

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.760 
student is largely ineffective and if
you<00:00:35.610> google<00:00:35.880> writing<00:00:36.540> correction<00:00:37.110> effective

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
you google writing correction effective

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.490 
you google writing correction effective
you'll<00:00:38.430> find<00:00:38.700> lots<00:00:39.000> of<00:00:39.239> studies<00:00:39.809> that<00:00:39.840> that

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
you'll find lots of studies that that

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.979 
you'll find lots of studies that that
have<00:00:40.620> been<00:00:40.800> done<00:00:41.059> where<00:00:42.059> they<00:00:42.180> study<00:00:42.480> people

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
have been done where they study people

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.810 
have been done where they study people
who<00:00:43.140> have<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.469> writing<00:00:43.739> corrected<00:00:44.340> and<00:00:44.489> even

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
who have the writing corrected and even

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.569 
who have the writing corrected and even
corrected<00:00:45.450> in<00:00:45.570> four<00:00:45.840> different<00:00:46.020> ways<00:00:46.579> you

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
corrected in four different ways you

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.100 
corrected in four different ways you
know<00:00:47.700> with<00:00:47.969> explanations<00:00:48.360> or<00:00:48.870> without

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
know with explanations or without

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.310 
know with explanations or without
explanations<00:00:49.920> colored<00:00:50.460> pencils<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:52.170> it

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
explanations colored pencils and and it

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.439 
explanations colored pencils and and it
really<00:00:52.739> doesn't<00:00:52.980> seem<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.340> matter<00:00:53.520> correcting

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
really doesn't seem to matter correcting

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.139 
really doesn't seem to matter correcting
people<00:00:54.719> writing<00:00:55.140> has<00:00:55.430> very<00:00:56.430> little<00:00:56.550> effect<00:00:56.730> on

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
people writing has very little effect on

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.049 
people writing has very little effect on
how<00:00:57.960> accurately<00:00:58.530> they<00:00:59.100> use<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.579> language<00:00:59.760> and

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
how accurately they use the language and

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.229 
how accurately they use the language and
certainly<00:01:00.420> that's<00:01:00.570> been<00:01:00.660> my<00:01:00.930> experience

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
certainly that's been my experience

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:07.070 
certainly that's been my experience
however<00:01:03.239> I<00:01:03.600> think<00:01:04.309> writing<00:01:05.309> correction<00:01:06.080> can

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
however I think writing correction can

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.120 
however I think writing correction can
be<00:01:07.280> useful<00:01:08.280> first<00:01:09.060> of<00:01:09.240> all<00:01:09.390> if<00:01:09.659> if<00:01:10.619> I<00:01:10.860> write

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
be useful first of all if if I write

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.760 
be useful first of all if if I write
something<00:01:11.659> say<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:12.689> link<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.170> I<00:01:13.229> submit<00:01:13.650> it<00:01:13.740> for

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
something say a link and I submit it for

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.390 
something say a link and I submit it for
correction<00:01:14.580> I<00:01:14.990> am<00:01:15.990> gonna<00:01:16.200> take<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.799> little<00:01:17.100> more

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
correction I am gonna take a little more

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.350 
correction I am gonna take a little more
care<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:18.420> I<00:01:19.110> might<00:01:19.350> look<00:01:19.830> up<00:01:20.360> some

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
care and I might look up some

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.100 
care and I might look up some
grammatical<00:01:22.200> tables<00:01:23.270> maybe<00:01:24.270> look<00:01:24.630> up<00:01:24.780> a<00:01:24.900> word

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
grammatical tables maybe look up a word

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.050 
grammatical tables maybe look up a word
in<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.380> dictionary<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:26.159> find<00:01:26.400> out<00:01:26.759> if<00:01:26.880> it's

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
in the dictionary to find out if it's

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.929 
in the dictionary to find out if it's
masculine<00:01:27.479> or<00:01:27.750> feminine<00:01:27.780> or<00:01:28.560> how<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.460> spell<00:01:29.790> it

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
masculine or feminine or how to spell it

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.200 
masculine or feminine or how to spell it
or<00:01:30.150> something<00:01:30.920> so<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.400> fact<00:01:32.640> that<00:01:32.790> it's<00:01:33.000> going

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
or something so the fact that it's going

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.080 
or something so the fact that it's going
to<00:01:33.299> be<00:01:33.450> corrected<00:01:33.990> by<00:01:34.140> someone<00:01:34.670> maybe<00:01:35.670> puts<00:01:36.000> a

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
to be corrected by someone maybe puts a

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.819 
to be corrected by someone maybe puts a
little<00:01:36.240> more<00:01:36.329> pressure<00:01:36.450> on<00:01:36.930> me<00:01:37.079> and<00:01:37.110> I<00:01:37.439> think

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
little more pressure on me and I think

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.210 
little more pressure on me and I think
the<00:01:38.100> big<00:01:38.520> part<00:01:38.939> of<00:01:39.210> writing<00:01:39.780> for<00:01:40.530> correction

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
the big part of writing for correction

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.090 
the big part of writing for correction
is<00:01:41.460> actually<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.210> fact<00:01:42.420> that<00:01:42.600> we<00:01:42.689> are<00:01:42.750> writing

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
is actually the fact that we are writing

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.490 
is actually the fact that we are writing
like<00:01:44.100> writing<00:01:44.520> itself<00:01:45.119> is<00:01:45.420> a<00:01:45.479> very<00:01:46.020> good<00:01:46.229> thing

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
like writing itself is a very good thing

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.020 
like writing itself is a very good thing
to<00:01:46.530> do<00:01:46.799> because<00:01:47.070> you're<00:01:47.369> forced<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:47.729> think

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
to do because you're forced to think

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.649 
to do because you're forced to think
think<00:01:48.990> through<00:01:49.200> what<00:01:49.350> you<00:01:49.470> want<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:49.740> say<00:01:50.659> and

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
think through what you want to say and

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.510 
think through what you want to say and
perhaps<00:01:51.990> do<00:01:52.259> a<00:01:52.290> little<00:01:52.470> bit<00:01:52.590> of<00:01:52.710> research<00:01:53.040> and

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
perhaps do a little bit of research and

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.069 
perhaps do a little bit of research and
all<00:01:53.640> this<00:01:53.820> time<00:01:54.240> you're<00:01:54.450> thinking<00:01:54.750> about<00:01:54.869> the

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
all this time you're thinking about the

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.789 
all this time you're thinking about the
words<00:01:55.320> and<00:01:55.710> I<00:01:56.460> think<00:01:56.490> that<00:01:57.000> is<00:01:57.619> 90%<00:01:58.619> of<00:01:58.680> the

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
words and I think that is 90% of the

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.580 
words and I think that is 90% of the
advantage<00:01:59.280> of<00:01:59.310> submitting<00:02:00.270> something<00:02:00.509> to<00:02:01.439> be

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
advantage of submitting something to be

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.830 
advantage of submitting something to be
corrected<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.670> actual<00:02:03.180> correction<00:02:03.750> you

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
corrected the actual correction you

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
corrected the actual correction you
receive<00:02:04.229> has

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
receive has

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.070 
receive has
relatively<00:02:07.820> little<00:02:08.180> impact<00:02:08.300> I<00:02:08.780> mean<00:02:08.930> I<00:02:09.020> know

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
relatively little impact I mean I know

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.150 
relatively little impact I mean I know
in<00:02:09.289> my<00:02:09.410> own<00:02:09.440> case<00:02:09.590> I<00:02:09.860> get<00:02:10.789> the<00:02:10.910> mistakes<00:02:11.270> back

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
in my own case I get the mistakes back

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.220 
in my own case I get the mistakes back
in<00:02:13.160> fact<00:02:13.430> and<00:02:14.060> this<00:02:14.210> is<00:02:14.330> the<00:02:14.450> second<00:02:14.870> thing<00:02:15.050> the

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
in fact and this is the second thing the

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.160 
in fact and this is the second thing the
biggest<00:02:16.180> advantage<00:02:17.180> and<00:02:17.570> I<00:02:17.690> should<00:02:17.870> say<00:02:17.990> the

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
biggest advantage and I should say the

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.870 
biggest advantage and I should say the
correcting<00:02:18.710> writing<00:02:19.130> is<00:02:19.280> something<00:02:19.430> that<00:02:19.760> is

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
correcting writing is something that is

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.570 
correcting writing is something that is
done<00:02:20.120> throughout<00:02:20.840> the<00:02:21.170> school<00:02:21.410> system<00:02:21.920> it's<00:02:22.400> a

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
done throughout the school system it's a

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.690 
done throughout the school system it's a
major<00:02:22.850> part<00:02:23.360> of<00:02:23.890> language<00:02:24.890> instruction<00:02:25.040> and

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
major part of language instruction and

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.420 
major part of language instruction and
yet<00:02:26.030> it<00:02:26.150> is<00:02:26.300> essentially<00:02:27.520> quite<00:02:28.520> useless<00:02:30.430> but

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
yet it is essentially quite useless but

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.720 
yet it is essentially quite useless but
what<00:02:32.090> I<00:02:32.120> find<00:02:32.450> useful<00:02:32.600> and<00:02:33.430> first<00:02:34.430> of<00:02:34.520> all<00:02:34.580> when

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
what I find useful and first of all when

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.370 
what I find useful and first of all when
I<00:02:34.820> was<00:02:35.000> correcting<00:02:35.480> people's<00:02:35.780> English<00:02:36.200> at

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
I was correcting people's English at

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.100 
I was correcting people's English at

forth<00:02:48.200> the<00:02:49.010> biggest<00:02:50.230> problem<00:02:51.230> people<00:02:51.260> had<00:02:51.650> was

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
forth the biggest problem people had was

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.270 
forth the biggest problem people had was
in<00:02:52.010> what<00:02:52.400> we<00:02:52.640> called<00:02:52.970> use<00:02:53.720> of<00:02:53.989> words<00:02:54.260> in<00:02:55.130> other

in what we called use of words in other

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.490 
in what we called use of words in other
words<00:02:55.489> it<00:02:55.760> might<00:02:56.090> be<00:02:56.360> grammatically<00:02:57.050> correct

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
words it might be grammatically correct

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.340 
words it might be grammatically correct
but<00:02:58.489> the<00:02:58.580> biggest<00:02:58.760> issue<00:02:59.000> is<00:02:59.239> they<00:02:59.510> didn't<00:03:00.110> put

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
but the biggest issue is they didn't put

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.290 
but the biggest issue is they didn't put
the<00:03:00.380> words<00:03:00.800> together<00:03:01.130> in<00:03:01.580> a<00:03:01.700> way<00:03:01.880> that<00:03:02.120> was

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
the words together in a way that was

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.610 
the words together in a way that was
natural<00:03:02.959> for<00:03:03.830> the<00:03:04.010> native<00:03:04.370> speaker<00:03:04.730> and<00:03:05.620> when

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
natural for the native speaker and when

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.930 
natural for the native speaker and when
I<00:03:06.650> get<00:03:07.130> when<00:03:08.030> I<00:03:08.060> got<00:03:08.330> my<00:03:08.980> corrected<00:03:09.980> texts<00:03:10.459> back

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
I get when I got my corrected texts back

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.600 
I get when I got my corrected texts back
what<00:03:11.690> was<00:03:11.810> most<00:03:12.049> interesting<00:03:12.739> to<00:03:12.769> me<00:03:13.070> was<00:03:13.370> how

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
what was most interesting to me was how

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.539 
what was most interesting to me was how
the<00:03:14.239> native<00:03:14.630> speaker<00:03:14.900> had<00:03:15.310> reorganized<00:03:16.310> the

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:16.549 
the native speaker had reorganized the

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:18.460 
the native speaker had reorganized the
words<00:03:16.760> to<00:03:17.030> make<00:03:17.150> it<00:03:17.209> sound<00:03:17.510> more<00:03:17.780> natural<00:03:18.260> and

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
words to make it sound more natural and

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.220 
words to make it sound more natural and
then<00:03:18.860> I<00:03:18.890> would<00:03:19.130> save<00:03:19.549> those<00:03:19.880> phrases<00:03:20.299> to

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
then I would save those phrases to

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.310 
then I would save those phrases to
review<00:03:21.970> so<00:03:22.970> what<00:03:23.180> I<00:03:23.360> was<00:03:23.510> more<00:03:23.780> interested<00:03:24.290> in

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
review so what I was more interested in

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.890 
review so what I was more interested in
because<00:03:24.560> you<00:03:25.220> know<00:03:25.310> getting<00:03:25.610> the<00:03:25.700> cases<00:03:26.660> right

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
because you know getting the cases right

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.650 
because you know getting the cases right
and<00:03:27.230> all<00:03:27.380> this<00:03:27.590> stuff<00:03:27.709> is<00:03:27.980> just<00:03:28.660> gradually

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
and all this stuff is just gradually

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.160 
and all this stuff is just gradually
over<00:03:30.140> time<00:03:30.370> reviewing<00:03:31.370> them<00:03:31.610> maybe<00:03:32.360> reading

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
over time reviewing them maybe reading

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.860 
over time reviewing them maybe reading
listening<00:03:33.769> writing<00:03:34.040> slowly<00:03:34.940> you<00:03:35.510> know<00:03:35.630> you'll

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
listening writing slowly you know you'll

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.140 
listening writing slowly you know you'll
get<00:03:36.019> better<00:03:36.200> at<00:03:36.470> it<00:03:36.500> having<00:03:37.340> it<00:03:37.430> corrected<00:03:37.940> for

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
get better at it having it corrected for

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.800 
get better at it having it corrected for
you<00:03:38.269> has<00:03:38.450> relatively<00:03:39.410> little<00:03:39.650> impact<00:03:39.769> however

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
you has relatively little impact however

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.570 
you has relatively little impact however
seeing<00:03:41.810> you<00:03:42.110> know<00:03:42.230> I<00:03:42.260> put<00:03:42.680> words<00:03:42.980> together<00:03:43.250> in

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:43.580 
seeing you know I put words together in

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.229 
seeing you know I put words together in
a<00:03:43.670> certain<00:03:43.880> way<00:03:44.180> and<00:03:44.739> that<00:03:45.739> comes<00:03:46.040> this

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
a certain way and that comes this

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:49.390 
a certain way and that comes this
natural<00:03:47.239> expression<00:03:47.780> so<00:03:48.200> that<00:03:48.230> to<00:03:48.980> me<00:03:49.100> is<00:03:49.310> very

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
natural expression so that to me is very

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.240 
natural expression so that to me is very
significant<00:03:50.060> and<00:03:50.209> that's<00:03:50.660> why<00:03:50.900> I<00:03:50.930> think<00:03:51.560> that

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
significant and that's why I think that

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.940 
significant and that's why I think that
writing<00:03:53.030> correction<00:03:53.630> should<00:03:53.810> only<00:03:54.380> be<00:03:54.769> done

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
writing correction should only be done

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:57.580 
writing correction should only be done
by<00:03:55.220> a<00:03:55.519> native<00:03:56.000> speaker<00:03:56.269> because<00:03:57.230> only<00:03:57.380> a

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
by a native speaker because only a

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.850 
by a native speaker because only a
native<00:03:57.980> speaker<00:03:58.220> has<00:03:58.820> a<00:03:58.870> natural<00:03:59.870> field<00:04:00.290> for

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860 
native speaker has a natural field for

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:02.590 
native speaker has a natural field for
how<00:04:01.010> the<00:04:01.070> words<00:04:01.519> are<00:04:01.700> put<00:04:01.880> together<00:04:02.030> and<00:04:02.480> how

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:02.600 
how the words are put together and how

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.509 
how the words are put together and how
the<00:04:02.660> words<00:04:02.989> are<00:04:03.140> used<00:04:03.200> and<00:04:03.530> what<00:04:03.680> is<00:04:03.769> a<00:04:03.799> natural

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:04.519 
the words are used and what is a natural

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:07.509 
the words are used and what is a natural
expression<00:04:04.760> a<00:04:05.860> non-native<00:04:06.860> speaker<00:04:07.040> might

expression a non-native speaker might

get<00:04:22.190> out<00:04:22.370> of<00:04:22.400> these<00:04:22.580> the<00:04:22.970> writing<00:04:23.300> production

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
get out of these the writing production

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.350 
get out of these the writing production
which<00:04:23.900> which<00:04:24.530> is<00:04:24.560> but<00:04:25.430> I<00:04:25.460> look<00:04:25.730> forward<00:04:25.760> to<00:04:26.120> is

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
which which is but I look forward to is

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.020 
which which is but I look forward to is
how<00:04:26.960> the<00:04:27.020> words<00:04:27.380> are<00:04:27.560> put<00:04:27.680> together<00:04:28.030> natural

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
how the words are put together natural

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.540 
how the words are put together natural
phrasing<00:04:29.630> natural<00:04:30.200> patterns<00:04:30.710> that<00:04:31.130> I<00:04:31.310> can

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
phrasing natural patterns that I can

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:36.850 
phrasing natural patterns that I can
then<00:04:31.730> save<00:04:32.090> and<00:04:32.420> review<00:04:33.850> and<00:04:34.850> perhaps<00:04:35.810> use<00:04:36.050> so

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
then save and review and perhaps use so

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.950 
then save and review and perhaps use so
so<00:04:37.430> therefore<00:04:37.670> writing<00:04:38.270> correction<00:04:38.780> should

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
so therefore writing correction should

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.290 
so therefore writing correction should
be<00:04:39.620> done<00:04:39.800> by<00:04:39.980> native<00:04:40.310> speakers<00:04:40.580> and<00:04:40.760> yet<00:04:41.120> the

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
be done by native speakers and yet the

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.180 
be done by native speakers and yet the
overwhelming<00:04:41.690> majority<00:04:42.290> of<00:04:42.740> writing

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
overwhelming majority of writing

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:46.030 
overwhelming majority of writing
correction<00:04:43.760> that<00:04:43.940> is<00:04:44.270> done<00:04:44.660> in<00:04:45.050> our<00:04:45.440> schools

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:46.040 
correction that is done in our schools

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.130 
correction that is done in our schools
and<00:04:46.520> so<00:04:46.640> forth<00:04:46.670> is<00:04:47.000> done<00:04:47.210> by<00:04:47.420> non-native

and so forth is done by non-native

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:50.080 
and so forth is done by non-native
speakers<00:04:48.470> who<00:04:48.800> will<00:04:48.890> look<00:04:49.520> for<00:04:49.790> things<00:04:50.000> that

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
speakers who will look for things that

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:51.910 
speakers who will look for things that
they<00:04:50.300> think<00:04:50.360> they<00:04:50.810> know<00:04:51.080> that<00:04:51.350> the<00:04:51.530> student

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:51.920 
they think they know that the student

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.860 
they think they know that the student
doesn't<00:04:52.250> know<00:04:52.400> and<00:04:52.640> mark<00:04:53.150> them<00:04:53.300> down<00:04:53.480> on<00:04:53.720> it

doesn't know and mark them down on it

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:59.320 
doesn't know and mark them down on it
which<00:04:54.320> is<00:04:54.550> relatively<00:04:57.130> unhelpful<00:04:58.130> so<00:04:58.790> there

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
which is relatively unhelpful so there

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.050 
which is relatively unhelpful so there
you<00:04:59.450> have<00:04:59.480> it<00:05:00.010> some<00:05:01.010> thoughts<00:05:01.310> on<00:05:01.520> writing

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
you have it some thoughts on writing

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.210 
you have it some thoughts on writing
correction<00:05:02.630> I<00:05:02.780> look<00:05:02.990> forward<00:05:03.410> to<00:05:03.440> your<00:05:03.980> views
