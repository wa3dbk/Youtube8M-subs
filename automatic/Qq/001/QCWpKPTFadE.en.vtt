00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.140
 in this region I will tell a little about 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:08.420
 mobile phone screen at 4 this 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.420
 240 percent to 320 

00:00:12.159 --> 00:00:15.929
 percentage of shares censored resistive German 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.509
 his system about his point of view 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:20.649
 good when a small screen is better 

00:00:20.649 --> 00:00:22.179
 use resistive type 

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:24.409
 because on it to the main account 

00:00:24.409 --> 00:00:27.079
 packs where there is something like that and here for example 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:29.550
 if you are uncomfortable with something you can 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.550
 room multiply or w any assistants 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.550
 subject for example 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.630
 1 color rendition el very good 206 a 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:43.409
 two thousand flowers or 265 thousand 

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:45.409
 here it is to be honest I do not like such 

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:47.609
 Accuracy as I usually say 

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:51.259
 the percentage of something wrong is formed 

00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:53.010
 percent 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.300
 100 billion years ago 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.370
 here and there it is not it is not 100 billion but 50 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.150
 billion years ago but here are attacks from such 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.070
 the same sups plan the difference is not yet 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.750
 there behave two thousand tamara 265 and so 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:07.900
 Further 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.870
 ted opinion is such a difference as 16 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:10.680
 million or 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.620
 65 thousand flowers 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.640
 ohh fee 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.540
 Started color rendering is not bad but now I 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.510
 I will open it to you as aptly preferential mosque 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.090
 fleet my photos ap 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:23.850
 as far as pin code baby is simple 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.370
 to show 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.930
 Here is the visaitova Nikita money 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.710
 here is my favorite picture 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.660
 sbu is great 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.230
 sell illumination 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:38.680
 connected I will not show but by the way 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.580
 this is secular keyboard language on 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.190
 uniform here is white light cross 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.550
 with Russia 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:47.590
 screen 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.150
 all this gear as I said quite good 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.850
 dawn bright such juicy but viewing angles 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.440
 maturity day 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.310
 but basically it 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.040
 backlight screen implemented successfully 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.720
 usually on these gatherings passenger 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.300
 so when we cant 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.940
 here we see everything changes this and so 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.820
 Further, the same someone we have lights in addition to 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.820
 father side athletes so 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.560
 backlight implemented well in 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.640
 Generally I am well done because 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:15.429
 look 

00:02:15.429 --> 00:02:18.449
 usually phone so here we cant 

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:20.769
 and here as they can usually take in hand and 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:22.599
 so here we tilt the phone 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:25.079
 before the final volume like here 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:26.689
 so doing here 

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:29.359
 and then what percentage plus what 

00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:31.439
 dams ooo that we can watch the video 

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:34.529
 for example or so and so tilt with us 

00:02:34.529 --> 00:02:35.649
 everything is ok 

00:02:35.649 --> 00:02:37.899
 here therefore look here so 

00:02:37.899 --> 00:02:40.809
 cant be slightly reduced and brightness 

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:43.389
 when so tilts a little bit brightness too 

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:44.899
 decreases 

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:48.079
 at that angle and backlit tactics 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:50.889
 at such angles us too brightness 

00:02:50.889 --> 00:02:54.359
 a little falls but unfortunately 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:56.319
 such angles at twilight the role of sazivi 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:57.209
 tass 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.609
 but on the other hand it has not returned to you 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:02.709
 picnic street where there is a terrible screen oil 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:05.129
 this is extreme 2 and if extreme 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:07.549
 addition for his control after his 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:09.229
 to consider 

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:12.139
 little sense 

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:15.029
 the status of transdniestria will be it too 

00:03:15.029 --> 00:03:16.789
 can see 

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:19.789
 quality 

00:03:26.779 --> 00:03:29.779
 in my opinion a very good screen 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:34.359
 thank you all wolves 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:43.309
 poems 

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.469
 let be
