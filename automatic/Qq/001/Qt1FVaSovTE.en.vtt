00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 and 9 16 degrees Celsius was going 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:05.609
 a little bit because the wind is 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.259
 blowing something strong the feeling 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:08.820
 thermal from a little more cold like this is 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.920
 to wrap up very well if we have 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.380
 plans what remains of this Thursday and the 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.179
 possibility of totally null rain 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.640
 so you do not have to load for water 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.710
 what is important to tell you is 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.630
 that we have cold fronts one that already 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.220
 moved away from the country however still the 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.470
 polar air mass that drove it will be 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.689
 generating instability rains 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.519
 Storms mainly in the southeast 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.219
 Yucatan peninsula we have event 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.469
 north high pressure center this in the 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.239
 gulf of mexico in addition to a new 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.100
 cold front that is the 18th of this 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.260
 season that we still lack many 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.780
 apparently this winter is expected 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.460
 pretty cold so is to take it 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.250
 quite into account to force us very very 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.960
 well we have these conditions as soon as 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.850
 to cold temperatures in good part 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.230
 of the national territory these 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.149
 mainly in the morning and in the 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.500
 night as usual, but due to 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.469
 that the tender heavens turn 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.940
 cleared this helps us a lot to that 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.930
 the temperatures in the afternoon are 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.510
 Pretty good 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.159
 reaching 18 in mexicalli a little bit 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.790
 freshest in Tijuana until 16 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.130
 degrees 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.230
 to 2 while in peace 22 Hermosillo 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.450
 up to 20 is 24 degrees centigrade not 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:14.100
 the eye thermometer moves a lot because 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.800
 we will wake up with a very cold temperature 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.770
 this mainly in Ciudad Juárez the 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:22.110
 minimum at minus 4 degrees Celsius so 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.090
 is that we wrap ourselves very well at this point 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.860
 mainly and the favorable thing is that 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.290
 as the sun rises it is expected that the 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.840
 temperature as the hours pass 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.490
 reach to exceed 12-13 degrees 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.240
 centigrade that already good is very much 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.180
