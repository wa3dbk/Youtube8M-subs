beyblade muggle some people that just

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.470 
beyblade muggle some people that just
started<00:00:11.190> a<00:00:11.280> late<00:00:11.460> maybe<00:00:11.700> they<00:00:11.969> don't<00:00:12.059> really

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480

know about it so yeah we're gonna do a

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.640 
know about it so yeah we're gonna do a
demonstration<00:00:14.809> using<00:00:15.809> meteor<00:00:15.990> Drago<00:00:16.470> with

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
demonstration using meteor Drago with

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.410 
demonstration using meteor Drago with
all<00:00:16.830> its<00:00:16.980> rubber<00:00:17.160> parts<00:00:17.460> and<00:00:17.640> left<00:00:17.910> spinning

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
all its rubber parts and left spinning

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.710 
all its rubber parts and left spinning
rotation<00:00:18.930> just<00:00:19.500> like<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:19.980> animes<00:00:20.699> watch<00:00:21.570> this

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
rotation just like the animes watch this

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.990 
rotation just like the animes watch this
anime<00:00:22.050> clip<00:00:22.380> right<00:00:22.529> here<00:00:22.789> in<00:00:23.789> Finn's<00:00:26.000> white

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
anime clip right here in Finn's white

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:41.420 
anime clip right here in Finn's white
used<00:00:27.390> his<00:00:27.539> hand<00:00:27.810> huh<00:00:28.650> he's<00:00:29.369> making

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.880 

what<00:00:42.430> is<00:00:42.550> going<00:00:42.820> on<00:00:43.020> it's<00:00:44.020> base<00:00:44.260> spin<00:00:44.710> is

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:44.890 
what is going on it's base spin is

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.720 
what is going on it's base spin is
somehow<00:00:45.190> increasing

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:48.730 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:56.510 

boring

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.130 

so<00:00:57.520> let's<00:00:57.790> demonstrate<00:00:57.970> that<00:00:58.390> in<00:00:58.600> real<00:00:59.080> life

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140 
so let's demonstrate that in real life

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:00.360 
so let's demonstrate that in real life
using<00:00:59.680> hands<00:00:59.860> spinning

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 
using hands spinning

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:07.440 
using hands spinning
ready

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.420

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
like that a lot less spin so does a

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.509 
like that a lot less spin so does a
Drago<00:02:18.290> have<00:02:18.440> the<00:02:18.530> potential<00:02:18.799> to<00:02:19.040> steal<00:02:19.280> spin

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:19.519 
Drago have the potential to steal spin

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:22.509 
Drago have the potential to steal spin
like<00:02:19.639> that<00:02:19.700> throw<00:02:20.510> it's<00:02:20.660> so<00:02:20.840> gracefully<00:02:21.590> it's

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:22.519 
like that throw it's so gracefully it's
