then<00:01:59.790> very<00:02:00.390> quickly<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.960> other<00:02:01.079> way<00:02:01.590> of<00:02:01.740> doing

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
then very quickly the other way of doing

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.490 
then very quickly the other way of doing
is<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.340> get<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.640> Russian<00:02:03.000> fleet<00:02:03.270> out<00:02:03.540> here

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
is to get the Russian fleet out here

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.980 
is to get the Russian fleet out here
forming<00:02:05.340> part<00:02:05.579> of<00:02:05.700> your<00:02:05.850> defense<00:02:06.210> against

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
forming part of your defense against

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.749 
forming part of your defense against
and<00:02:07.200> so<00:02:07.380> it's<00:02:07.530> got<00:02:07.650> that<00:02:07.710> going<00:02:08.069> for<00:02:08.220> it<00:02:08.459> I

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
and so it's got that going for it I

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.180 
and so it's got that going for it I
would<00:02:09.690> if<00:02:10.140> I'm<00:02:10.259> going<00:02:10.440> to<00:02:10.500> do<00:02:10.619> that<00:02:10.800> I<00:02:10.979> would

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
would if I'm going to do that I would

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.860 
would if I'm going to do that I would
stand<00:02:11.580> up<00:02:11.700> in<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:11.880> Black<00:02:12.060> Sea<00:02:12.090> that<00:02:12.569> doesn't

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
stand up in the Black Sea that doesn't

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.430 
stand up in the Black Sea that doesn't
array<00:02:13.080> around<00:02:13.560> anybody's<00:02:14.300> suspicion<00:02:15.319> of<00:02:16.319> a
