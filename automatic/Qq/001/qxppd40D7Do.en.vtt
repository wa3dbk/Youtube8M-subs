bit<00:01:20.759> pricey<00:01:20.970> but<00:01:21.360> I<00:01:21.659> think<00:01:21.900> it's<00:01:22.049> worth<00:01:22.229> the

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
bit pricey but I think it's worth the

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.840 
bit pricey but I think it's worth the
wait<00:01:23.369> it's<00:01:23.759> really<00:01:24.270> sturdy<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:25.850> basically

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
wait it's really sturdy and basically

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.800 
wait it's really sturdy and basically
comes<00:01:27.180> with<00:01:27.479> a<00:01:27.509> dome<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:29.270> the<00:01:30.270> inside<00:01:30.780> is

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
comes with a dome and the inside is

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.030 
comes with a dome and the inside is
ultra<00:01:31.680> plush<00:01:32.329> it's<00:01:33.329> it's<00:01:34.170> really<00:01:34.590> nicer

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
ultra plush it's it's really nicer

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
probably nicer than my own bed

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.719

are<00:03:23.850> travel<00:03:24.850> balls<00:03:25.239> but<00:03:25.660> you<00:03:25.900> know<00:03:26.019> I<00:03:26.049> think

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
are travel balls but you know I think

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.039

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.049 
they can be everyday Bowl and the good

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:30.240 
they can be everyday Bowl and the good
thing<00:03:29.230> about<00:03:29.319> them<00:03:29.650> is<00:03:29.680> that<00:03:29.859> there<00:03:30.130> are

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
thing about them is that there are

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.629 
thing about them is that there are
hermetic<00:03:30.790> so<00:03:31.090> they<00:03:31.630> won't<00:03:31.840> spill<00:03:32.639> but

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:33.639 
hermetic so they won't spill but

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:35.640 
hermetic so they won't spill but
basically<00:03:34.299> look<00:03:34.510> at<00:03:34.630> this<00:03:34.840> so<00:03:35.019> you<00:03:35.079> take<00:03:35.470> this

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
basically look at this so you take this

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.970 
basically look at this so you take this
thing<00:03:35.709> out<00:03:36.750> and<00:03:37.750> this<00:03:38.019> is<00:03:38.170> like<00:03:38.350> a<00:03:38.380> saucer

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
thing out and this is like a saucer

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.789 
thing out and this is like a saucer
where<00:03:39.579> you<00:03:39.670> can<00:03:39.850> put<00:03:40.030> your<00:03:40.060> dry<00:03:40.359> food<00:03:40.799> then

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799 
where you can put your dry food then

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:45.569 
where you can put your dry food then
here<00:03:42.280> you<00:03:42.459> can<00:03:42.700> put<00:03:42.940> wet<00:03:43.299> food<00:03:43.690> and<00:03:44.340> then<00:03:45.340> in

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:45.579 
here you can put wet food and then in

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:48.710 
here you can put wet food and then in
the<00:03:45.970> inside<00:03:46.510> you<00:03:46.810> can<00:03:46.989> take<00:03:47.200> this<00:03:47.350> off<00:03:47.620> and

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
the inside you can take this off and

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.670 
the inside you can take this off and
then<00:03:49.720> that's<00:03:50.019> your<00:03:50.139> water<00:03:50.530> bowl<00:03:50.970> so<00:03:52.680> really

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
then that's your water bowl so really

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.069 
then that's your water bowl so really
nice<00:03:53.859> idea<00:03:54.340> I<00:03:54.519> really<00:03:54.940> like<00:03:55.120> the<00:03:55.239> concept<00:03:55.780> and

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:56.079 
nice idea I really like the concept and

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:59.789 
nice idea I really like the concept and
it<00:03:56.590> all<00:03:56.889> seals<00:03:57.280> tight<00:03:57.700> so<00:03:58.420> even<00:03:58.900> if<00:03:59.019> I<00:03:59.170> have

00:03:59.789 --> 00:03:59.799 
it all seals tight so even if I have

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:02.580 
it all seals tight so even if I have
some<00:04:00.040> water<00:04:00.250> in<00:04:00.370> there<00:04:00.760> it<00:04:01.239> won't<00:04:01.540> spill<00:04:01.959> which

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
some water in there it won't spill which

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.360 
some water in there it won't spill which
is<00:04:02.620> great<00:04:03.130> if<00:04:03.579> you're<00:04:03.880> traveling<00:04:04.480> and<00:04:05.370> the
