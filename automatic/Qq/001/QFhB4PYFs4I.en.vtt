00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
how to make a cobblestone generator I

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.299 
how to make a cobblestone generator I
know<00:00:06.540> that's<00:00:06.990> really<00:00:07.200> simple<00:00:07.529> but<00:00:07.890> I<00:00:08.040> wanted

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
know that's really simple but I wanted

noticed a lot of people actually don't
know<00:00:11.580> how<00:00:11.730> it<00:00:11.849> works<00:00:12.000> and<00:00:12.300> also<00:00:13.290> haven't

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
know how it works and also haven't

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.560 
know how it works and also haven't
posted<00:00:14.130> content<00:00:14.610> in<00:00:14.790> a<00:00:14.880> while<00:00:15.089> and<00:00:15.299> i<00:00:15.389> have

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
youtube felt like claiming one of my

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.759 
youtube felt like claiming one of my

go back to posting videos often and i

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.520 
go back to posting videos often and i
have<00:00:32.730> a<00:00:32.790> few<00:00:33.030> videos<00:00:33.210> built<00:00:33.600> up<00:00:33.809> so<00:00:34.050> hopefully

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
have a few videos built up so hopefully

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.470 
have a few videos built up so hopefully
you<00:00:34.620> guys<00:00:34.770> enjoy<00:00:35.070> that<00:00:35.280> but<00:00:35.700> anyway<00:00:35.910> to<00:00:36.149> make<00:00:36.329> a

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
you guys enjoy that but anyway to make a

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.410 
you guys enjoy that but anyway to make a
cobblestone<00:00:36.930> generator<00:00:37.140> is<00:00:38.059> quite<00:00:39.059> simply

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
cobblestone generator is quite simply

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.450 
cobblestone generator is quite simply
just<00:00:39.719> dig<00:00:39.930> out<00:00:40.079> four<00:00:40.379> blocks<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:40.950> then<00:00:41.129> dig

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
just dig out four blocks and then dig

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.549 
just dig out four blocks and then dig
one<00:00:42.180> on<00:00:42.450> either<00:00:42.660> side<00:00:42.809> so<00:00:42.989> you<00:00:43.170> can<00:00:43.290> do<00:00:43.469> it

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
one on either side so you can do it

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.060 
one on either side so you can do it
there<00:00:43.739> or<00:00:43.980> here<00:00:44.670> and<00:00:44.850> then<00:00:45.719> on<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.530> side<00:00:46.770> with

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
there or here and then on the side with

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.549 
there or here and then on the side with
the<00:00:47.100> ditch<00:00:47.430> you<00:00:48.270> put<00:00:48.510> water<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:49.110> it<00:00:49.350> will<00:00:49.469> go

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
the ditch you put water and it will go

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.240 
the ditch you put water and it will go
like<00:00:49.590> this<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:50.219> on<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.879> other<00:00:50.969> side<00:00:51.300> you<00:00:51.690> put

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
like this and on the other side you put

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.490 
like this and on the other side you put
lava<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.670> you'll<00:00:54.149> get<00:00:54.270> cobblestone<00:00:54.899> now<00:00:55.379> if

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
lava and you'll get cobblestone now if

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.260 
lava and you'll get cobblestone now if
you<00:00:55.590> had<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.739> pic<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.160> your<00:00:56.399> mining<00:00:56.850> that<00:00:57.030> it

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
you had a pic and your mining that it

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.299 
you had a pic and your mining that it
would<00:00:57.570> just<00:00:57.690> collect<00:00:58.410> it<00:00:58.559> sometimes<00:00:59.039> it<00:00:59.160> does

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
would just collect it sometimes it does

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.299 
would just collect it sometimes it does
go<00:00:59.489> in<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.699> lava<00:00:59.879> so<00:01:00.649> that's<00:01:01.649> why<00:01:01.859> i<00:01:01.890> wanted<00:01:02.190> to

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
go in the lava so that's why i wanted to

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.680 
go in the lava so that's why i wanted to
make<00:01:02.430> this<00:01:02.579> tutorial<00:01:03.090> so<00:01:03.270> you<00:01:03.329> could<00:01:03.510> play

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
make this tutorial so you could play

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.000 
make this tutorial so you could play
with<00:01:03.719> your<00:01:03.960> own<00:01:04.080> techniques<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:04.769> get<00:01:04.890> the

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
with your own techniques and get the

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.789 
with your own techniques and get the
best<00:01:05.159> most<00:01:05.580> efficient<00:01:06.150> one<00:01:06.360> i<00:01:06.570> also<00:01:07.470> like<00:01:07.770> to

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
best most efficient one i also like to

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.710 
best most efficient one i also like to
break<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.280> block<00:01:08.460> here<00:01:08.729> or<00:01:08.909> if<00:01:09.030> you<00:01:09.150> building

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
break the block here or if you building

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.060 
break the block here or if you building
it<00:01:09.840> out<00:01:09.990> of<00:01:10.170> ground<00:01:10.380> which<00:01:10.530> I'll<00:01:10.710> show<00:01:10.860> you<00:01:10.890> in

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
it out of ground which I'll show you in

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.210 
it out of ground which I'll show you in
a<00:01:11.130> sec<00:01:11.960> put<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:12.990> little<00:01:13.409> bit<00:01:13.710> here<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:13.979> stand

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
a sec put a little bit here to stand

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.770 
a sec put a little bit here to stand
because<00:01:14.549> you<00:01:14.790> can<00:01:14.939> press<00:01:15.119> up<00:01:15.299> to<00:01:15.420> here<00:01:15.630> and

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
because you can press up to here and

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.170 
because you can press up to here and
mine<00:01:16.770> it<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.070> it's<00:01:17.250> you're<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.610> closest<00:01:18.030> to

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
mine it and it's you're the closest to

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.940 
mine it and it's you're the closest to
the<00:01:18.299> block<00:01:18.509> you<00:01:18.720> are<00:01:18.869> used<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:19.590> be<00:01:19.710> able<00:01:19.799> to

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
the block you are used to be able to

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.380 
the block you are used to be able to
stand<00:01:20.159> on<00:01:20.400> it<00:01:20.520> but<00:01:20.670> now<00:01:20.820> it<00:01:20.909> actually<00:01:21.030> pushes

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
stand on it but now it actually pushes

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.780 
stand on it but now it actually pushes
you<00:01:21.659> into<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:22.020> lava<00:01:22.229> mostly<00:01:22.979> it<00:01:23.460> actually

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
you into the lava mostly it actually

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.249 
you into the lava mostly it actually
didn't<00:01:23.970> push<00:01:24.090> me<00:01:24.150> in<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.360> lover<00:01:24.570> then<00:01:24.810> so<00:01:24.990> I

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
didn't push me in the lover then so I

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.230 
didn't push me in the lover then so I
suppose<00:01:25.740> you<00:01:25.860> can<00:01:25.979> do<00:01:26.100> it<00:01:26.189> with<00:01:26.280> that<00:01:26.400> gap<00:01:26.610> but

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
suppose you can do it with that gap but

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.789 
suppose you can do it with that gap but
anyway<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:27.689> make<00:01:27.900> it<00:01:28.229> out<00:01:28.380> of<00:01:28.439> ground

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
anyway to make it out of ground

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.390 
anyway to make it out of ground
basically<00:01:29.520> you<00:01:29.670> need<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:30.000> build<00:01:30.240> up<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.659> 3<00:01:31.439> by<00:01:31.770> 6

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
basically you need to build up a 3 by 6

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.380 
basically you need to build up a 3 by 6
to<00:01:32.729> high<00:01:33.630> little<00:01:34.700> square<00:01:35.700> I<00:01:35.909> don't<00:01:36.150> know<00:01:36.210> what

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
to high little square I don't know what

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.090 
to high little square I don't know what
you'd<00:01:36.540> call<00:01:36.570> it<00:01:36.900> so<00:01:37.799> that's<00:01:37.979> four<00:01:38.400> five<00:01:39.240> six

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
you'd call it so that's four five six

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.130 
you'd call it so that's four five six
you<00:01:41.100> go<00:01:41.220> do<00:01:41.400> it<00:01:41.430> too<00:01:41.700> high<00:01:41.909> so<00:01:42.270> that<00:01:42.299> it<00:01:42.869> doesn't

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
you go do it too high so that it doesn't

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.109 
you go do it too high so that it doesn't
leak<00:01:43.439> out<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.649> bottom<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.189> then<00:01:44.939> basically

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
leak out the bottom and then basically

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.300 
leak out the bottom and then basically
just<00:01:45.630> build<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:45.960> same<00:01:46.140> thing<00:01:46.409> in<00:01:46.649> that<00:01:46.860> so<00:01:47.250> you

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
just build the same thing in that so you

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.850 
just build the same thing in that so you
go<00:01:47.490> for<00:01:47.850> put<00:01:48.420> one<00:01:48.600> down<00:01:48.840> we'll<00:01:49.320> do<00:01:49.439> it<00:01:49.530> this<00:01:49.649> way

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
go for put one down we'll do it this way

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.520 
go for put one down we'll do it this way
this<00:01:50.070> time<00:01:50.310> and<00:01:50.600> there<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:51.689> go<00:01:51.750> you<00:01:52.320> can<00:01:52.439> have

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
this time and there you go you can have

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.460 
this time and there you go you can have
your<00:01:52.590> little<00:01:52.799> ledge<00:01:53.070> here<00:01:53.280> to<00:01:53.490> break<00:01:53.909> it<00:01:54.149> and

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
your little ledge here to break it and

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.230 
your little ledge here to break it and
yeah<00:01:55.470> that's<00:01:55.770> a<00:01:55.920> cobblestone<00:01:56.340> generator<00:01:56.520> I

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
yeah that's a cobblestone generator I

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.760 
yeah that's a cobblestone generator I
don't<00:01:57.630> really<00:01:57.780> see<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.110> point<00:01:58.259> in<00:01:58.619> these

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
don't really see the point in these

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.530 
don't really see the point in these
because<00:01:59.100> it's<00:01:59.280> easier<00:01:59.700> to<00:01:59.820> just<00:02:00.030> go<00:02:00.210> dig<00:02:00.420> in

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
because it's easier to just go dig in

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.600 
because it's easier to just go dig in
mind<00:02:00.750> but<00:02:00.990> if<00:02:01.259> you're<00:02:01.649> making<00:02:01.950> a<00:02:02.040> factory<00:02:02.520> or

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
mind but if you're making a factory or

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.609 
mind but if you're making a factory or
something<00:02:02.729> or<00:02:03.329> did<00:02:03.600> something<00:02:03.659> with<00:02:04.170> pistons

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
something or did something with pistons

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.219 
something or did something with pistons
you<00:02:04.799> could<00:02:04.950> do<00:02:05.100> it<00:02:05.219> to<00:02:05.909> make<00:02:06.210> a<00:02:06.270> piston<00:02:06.570> wall<00:02:06.990> or

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
you could do it to make a piston wall or

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.499 
you could do it to make a piston wall or
something<00:02:07.439> that<00:02:08.310> automatically<00:02:08.910> rebuilds

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
something that automatically rebuilds

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.479 
something that automatically rebuilds
itself<00:02:09.599> now<00:02:10.440> I<00:02:10.470> want<00:02:10.649> to<00:02:10.770> explain<00:02:11.160> how<00:02:11.400> it

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
itself now I want to explain how it

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.530 
itself now I want to explain how it
works<00:02:11.550> alright<00:02:12.090> so

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
works alright so

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.990 
works alright so
so<00:02:12.629> when<00:02:13.349> you<00:02:13.469> put<00:02:13.860> down<00:02:14.010> lava<00:02:14.310> it<00:02:14.610> will<00:02:14.849> go

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
so when you put down lava it will go

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.209 
so when you put down lava it will go
four<00:02:15.299> blocks<00:02:15.349> so<00:02:16.349> it<00:02:16.409> will<00:02:16.530> break<00:02:16.709> this<00:02:16.920> fifth

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:17.219 
four blocks so it will break this fifth

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:19.160 
four blocks so it will break this fifth
block<00:02:17.430> here<00:02:17.670> this<00:02:17.969> is<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.150> fifth<00:02:18.510> block<00:02:18.750> or

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
block here this is the fifth block or

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.530 
block here this is the fifth block or
put<00:02:19.349> this<00:02:19.920> to<00:02:20.129> mark<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:20.430> fifth<00:02:20.640> block<00:02:20.849> you'll

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
put this to mark the fifth block you'll

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.410 
put this to mark the fifth block you'll
see<00:02:21.750> that<00:02:21.930> it<00:02:22.049> only<00:02:22.230> goes<00:02:22.530> for<00:02:22.950> now<00:02:23.849> when<00:02:24.269> you

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
see that it only goes for now when you

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.420 
see that it only goes for now when you
put<00:02:24.629> a<00:02:24.659> water<00:02:25.079> source<00:02:25.379> pressing<00:02:25.920> up<00:02:26.040> to<00:02:26.189> lava

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
put a water source pressing up to lava

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.280 
put a water source pressing up to lava
it<00:02:26.730> should<00:02:27.030> disappear<00:02:27.180> or<00:02:27.750> just<00:02:27.989> be<00:02:28.109> held

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
it should disappear or just be held

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.929 
it should disappear or just be held
there<00:02:28.500> like<00:02:28.709> that<00:02:28.890> but<00:02:29.250> I<00:02:29.280> think<00:02:29.640> it's<00:02:29.790> meant

00:02:29.929 --> 00:02:29.939 
there like that but I think it's meant

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:32.089 
there like that but I think it's meant
to<00:02:30.090> disappear<00:02:30.540> in<00:02:30.659> the<00:02:30.750> game<00:02:30.930> but<00:02:31.650> anyway

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
to disappear in the game but anyway

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:35.569 
to disappear in the game but anyway
that's<00:02:32.400> because<00:02:32.879> basically<00:02:33.569> water<00:02:34.200> lava<00:02:35.159> does

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:35.579 
that's because basically water lava does

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:38.000 
that's because basically water lava does
overpower<00:02:36.180> water<00:02:36.510> unless<00:02:36.840> the<00:02:37.530> water<00:02:37.739> touches

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
overpower water unless the water touches

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.949 
overpower water unless the water touches
the<00:02:38.340> source<00:02:38.609> block<00:02:38.849> of<00:02:39.000> lava<00:02:39.209> so<00:02:39.510> if<00:02:39.569> I<00:02:39.659> put<00:02:39.840> the

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
the source block of lava so if I put the

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:41.690 
the source block of lava so if I put the
water<00:02:40.079> here<00:02:40.439> that<00:02:40.739> will<00:02:40.889> turn<00:02:41.069> into<00:02:41.220> obsidian

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
water here that will turn into obsidian

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.410 
water here that will turn into obsidian
and<00:02:42.799> the<00:02:43.799> way<00:02:43.920> you<00:02:43.980> make<00:02:44.280> the<00:02:44.579> cobblestone<00:02:45.150> is

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
and the way you make the cobblestone is

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.440 
and the way you make the cobblestone is
within<00:02:46.109> three<00:02:46.739> blocks<00:02:46.920> are<00:02:47.489> two<00:02:47.939> blocks<00:02:48.209> of

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
within three blocks are two blocks of

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.629 
within three blocks are two blocks of
the<00:02:48.629> initial<00:02:49.019> source<00:02:49.290> so<00:02:49.590> this<00:02:50.040> block<00:02:50.250> here<00:02:50.489> is

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:50.639 
the initial source so this block here is

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:53.240 
the initial source so this block here is
the<00:02:50.790> source<00:02:51.120> and<00:02:51.419> these<00:02:51.930> two<00:02:52.230> initial<00:02:52.889> like

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
the source and these two initial like

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.849 
the source and these two initial like
the<00:02:53.549> blocks<00:02:53.760> from<00:02:53.970> it<00:02:54.530> possibly<00:02:55.530> three<00:02:55.829> I

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:55.859 
the blocks from it possibly three I

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:57.440 
the blocks from it possibly three I
don't<00:02:56.159> know<00:02:56.280> I<00:02:56.310> haven't<00:02:56.669> tried<00:02:56.970> it<00:02:57.000> with<00:02:57.209> three

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
don't know I haven't tried it with three

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.599 
don't know I haven't tried it with three
if<00:02:57.659> water<00:02:58.470> touches<00:02:58.769> either<00:02:59.159> one<00:02:59.370> of<00:02:59.400> these

00:02:59.599 --> 00:02:59.609 
if water touches either one of these

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:02.379 
if water touches either one of these
blocks<00:03:00.000> you'll<00:03:00.780> see<00:03:01.019> that<00:03:01.260> it<00:03:01.470> makes<00:03:01.739> a

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:02.389 
blocks you'll see that it makes a

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:05.720 
blocks you'll see that it makes a
cobblestone<00:03:03.389> see<00:03:04.049> but<00:03:05.040> you<00:03:05.280> don't<00:03:05.459> want<00:03:05.639> it

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
cobblestone see but you don't want it

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:06.979 
cobblestone see but you don't want it
like<00:03:05.790> this<00:03:05.909> because<00:03:06.269> you<00:03:06.480> don't<00:03:06.629> want<00:03:06.720> the

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
like this because you don't want the

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:08.780 
like this because you don't want the
water<00:03:07.169> that<00:03:07.409> close<00:03:07.709> because<00:03:08.010> sometimes<00:03:08.609> it

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
water that close because sometimes it

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.759 
water that close because sometimes it
actually<00:03:08.970> gets<00:03:09.239> rid<00:03:09.480> of<00:03:09.569> the<00:03:09.629> water<00:03:09.959> so<00:03:10.590> what

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
actually gets rid of the water so what

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:12.289 
actually gets rid of the water so what
you<00:03:10.859> have<00:03:11.010> to<00:03:11.159> do<00:03:11.280> is<00:03:11.430> have<00:03:11.609> a<00:03:11.669> bit<00:03:11.879> of<00:03:12.000> a<00:03:12.060> water

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
you have to do is have a bit of a water

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:14.210 
you have to do is have a bit of a water
path<00:03:12.569> to<00:03:12.870> so<00:03:13.139> you<00:03:13.200> put<00:03:13.409> the<00:03:13.500> water<00:03:13.620> here<00:03:14.010> and

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
path to so you put the water here and

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.089 
path to so you put the water here and
you'll<00:03:15.180> see<00:03:15.329> that<00:03:15.439> I'll<00:03:16.439> see<00:03:16.829> it<00:03:16.949> actually

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:17.099 
you'll see that I'll see it actually

guys can see how you can play around

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:35.839 
guys can see how you can play around
with<00:03:34.500> it<00:03:34.530> and<00:03:34.739> do<00:03:34.889> double<00:03:35.250> ones<00:03:35.430> and<00:03:35.669> stuff

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:35.849 
with it and do double ones and stuff

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:37.879 
with it and do double ones and stuff
like<00:03:36.030> that<00:03:36.090> alright<00:03:37.019> so<00:03:37.349> here<00:03:37.650> you'll<00:03:37.799> see

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:37.889 
like that alright so here you'll see

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:40.759 
like that alright so here you'll see
this<00:03:38.159> one<00:03:38.370> produces<00:03:38.909> double<00:03:39.269> and<00:03:39.590> you'll<00:03:40.590> see

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
this one produces double and you'll see

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:42.409 
this one produces double and you'll see
this<00:03:40.979> is<00:03:41.190> the<00:03:41.220> source<00:03:41.579> block<00:03:41.819> up<00:03:42.000> here<00:03:42.209> and

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:42.419 
this is the source block up here and

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:44.479 
this is the source block up here and
then<00:03:42.959> the<00:03:43.199> block<00:03:43.409> down<00:03:43.680> here<00:03:43.949> is<00:03:44.069> actually

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
then the block down here is actually

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:47.869 
then the block down here is actually
making<00:03:44.729> the<00:03:44.879> cobblestone<00:03:46.129> but<00:03:47.129> I<00:03:47.370> think<00:03:47.729> this

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:47.879 
making the cobblestone but I think this

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:50.180 
making the cobblestone but I think this
thing<00:03:48.269> a<00:03:48.299> bit<00:03:48.540> weird<00:03:48.959> about<00:03:49.319> this<00:03:49.560> is<00:03:49.799> the<00:03:49.949> fact

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
thing a bit weird about this is the fact

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.520 
thing a bit weird about this is the fact
that<00:03:50.310> um<00:03:50.609> I<00:03:50.909> figured<00:03:51.659> this<00:03:51.870> block<00:03:52.139> here<00:03:52.319> would

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
that um I figured this block here would

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:53.960 
that um I figured this block here would
be<00:03:52.560> meant<00:03:52.889> to<00:03:52.949> be<00:03:53.129> turned<00:03:53.340> to<00:03:53.489> cobble<00:03:53.760> stone

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
be meant to be turned to cobble stone

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.420 
be meant to be turned to cobble stone
but<00:03:54.299> yeah<00:03:54.569> it<00:03:54.659> doesn't<00:03:54.840> work<00:03:55.079> like<00:03:55.260> that

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
but yeah it doesn't work like that

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.679 
but yeah it doesn't work like that
that's<00:03:56.430> an<00:03:56.579> idea<00:03:56.879> I<00:03:56.909> was<00:03:57.030> playing<00:03:57.299> with<00:03:57.449> and

00:03:57.679 --> 00:03:57.689 
that's an idea I was playing with and

00:03:57.689 --> 00:03:59.330 
that's an idea I was playing with and
then<00:03:57.810> I<00:03:57.900> was<00:03:57.989> playing<00:03:58.199> with<00:03:58.319> this<00:03:58.500> one<00:03:58.709> which

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
then I was playing with this one which

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.300 
then I was playing with this one which
is<00:03:59.370> basically<00:04:00.150> just<00:04:00.599> one<00:04:01.500> lover<00:04:01.769> there<00:04:02.069> and

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
is basically just one lover there and

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.250 
is basically just one lover there and
water<00:04:02.549> there<00:04:02.849> and<00:04:03.090> then<00:04:03.269> when<00:04:03.780> you<00:04:03.900> break<00:04:04.079> the

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
water there and then when you break the

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.229 
water there and then when you break the
cobblestone<00:04:04.680> the<00:04:04.889> water<00:04:05.069> updates<00:04:05.639> faster

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
cobblestone the water updates faster

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:08.210 
cobblestone the water updates faster
than<00:04:06.419> the<00:04:06.510> lava<00:04:06.750> yeah<00:04:07.680> I<00:04:07.739> hope<00:04:07.919> you<00:04:08.069> guys

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220
