00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:13.780
 and what's up with people like I'm going guys 

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:16.029
 here with a new chapter a new 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:19.150
 video of this series of houses of teaching 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:22.060
 series of the sims 3 in which good for 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:25.480
 If you do not know, I'll upload houses that I do not think 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:28.630
 I do not even believe the game, but it creates them 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.640
 people who are very good at this 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.219
 a certain front that creates them and the 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.750
 page always on the page of 

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:37.930
 custom content of the sims 3 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:41.230
 What else do I use to download things and 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:43.660
 well I upload the houses so more than more 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.550
 I like that more striking 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:49.630
 I think this is the fourth one that goes up to 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:51.820
 channel and how I'm seeing is very modern 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:55.220
 It is similar to the third plan 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:57.860
 I went up but these even more modern if possible 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:00.680
 I did not authorize it to play a game 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:04.699
 because maybe it's too extravagant 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.800
 there with the ones with the crystals all over 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.680
 the house looks inside even in the 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.830
 bathroom that is upstairs 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:14.250
 and well, more than anything, it would be like a 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.960
 caprice for a rich in real life not 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.480
 I would put the odd wall but 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:22.840
 good is that I liked as 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:24.970
 I'm seeing it's amazing maybe to 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:28.150
 Some may find it easy to design these 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:30.250
 but not houses but I tell you that you 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.590
 I've missed many hours 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.780
 construction in the sims 3 that in fact 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:38.190
 I like it a lot and it's not easy 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:40.650
 make these designs 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:43.080
 and well here I am watching the pool 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.000
 outside I always try to find houses that 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.950
 have a pool, I do not like the 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.040
 Incredible interior also almost everything 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.510
 content created by these people by 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.210
 themselves or by others 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:56.940
 and good little more than commenting on the 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.100
 seeing 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.050
 a bedroom a bathroom is a house 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.790
 individual I also put it here in this 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.380
 world does not fit much on the beach where 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.140
 I put it but eye but good 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.130
 put it in this neighborhood that is 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.210
 relatively new in the game has 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.110
 few moths 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:15.020
 I do not remember right now what it's called 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.850
 but good nothing else there you have the house 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.920
 remember that in the description you have 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.260
 the three links the link to the page of the 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:25.010
 artist the link to the direct download of 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.870
 the house and the link to the film page 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.750
 resource that is where all this is 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.300
 tinglado and good nothing else I leave you with the 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.750
 video that remains nothing and until the next 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.750
 goodbye 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.700
