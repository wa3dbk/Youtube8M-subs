00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.779
 I left a bit of live in jaipur at mondo ita 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:29.909
 that he imagined me a woman through a little America 

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:33.240
 that crosses the 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.930
 that of every point where you touch cassell 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.670
 look like stars and then tell me culture and objects. 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.110
 uhm the flavors 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:43.670
 and create it 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.240
 from any place where 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.280
 coming 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.500
 he creates his own way of dressing and we left 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:57.320
 let's say from the old europe its opposite side the last member 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.170
 then we crossed the Silk Road and then added 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:03.590
 many see it here 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:08.160
 if you dubbed then you internet rt internal natural colors 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.310
 and up to the Masai culture getting dirty 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.650
 and we made them dyes 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:16.630
 in the third 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:17.970
 in the coffee 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.500
 to absorb 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.230
 a little bit all they were 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:26.550
 the crops of these peoples a free woman also loves to travel 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.850
 and above all that creates fashion itself 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.250
 taken and maybe amunÃ¬ import 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.049
 but the woman of the street who creates her own 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:38.049
 his fashion 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.830
 here you have created the PC in a separate pool, read Cashmere Interview like 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.230
 they are going 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:48.170
 thanks very well 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.990
 the Italian jeans talked a lot 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.690
 newspapers and magazines like this 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.090
 so much so that 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.620
 and we also had requests we didn't have any more 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.620
 reproduced some 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.460
 like next summer 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.050
 we have proposed this story of the three-dimensional reprint 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.789
 no loading in cotton 

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:19.389
 that is, changing from silk to linen cotton trust this effect but let's say 

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:19.639
 no 

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:23.269
 a more rustic atmosphere to always remain in the theme of travel 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:28.379
 and in January when he entered 

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:31.039
 how the reports are 

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:32.649
 deep night 

00:02:32.649 --> 00:02:34.939
 sincerely very good 

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:39.209
 I must say that at the beginning I may have had a little fear so 

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:41.169
 instead 

00:02:41.169 --> 00:02:44.209
 what emerged that we see so much of us 

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:49.619
 they have looked for us the collection they like a lot of things that makes me so much 

00:02:49.619 --> 00:02:51.009
 lavorar 

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:52.389
 is 

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:54.359
 for which relationships are 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:57.359
 extraordinary if it continues like this we are rebellious 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:58.959
 unravel 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.070
 what we've done so far 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.710
 therefore it is not that we do not have any commercial influence 

00:03:05.429 --> 00:03:08.859
 and continues our dream continues as it was before 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:12.209
 ask 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:12.479
 maps
