00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
I took me 10 to 15 tries to figure this

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.610 
I took me 10 to 15 tries to figure this
out<00:00:48.000> because<00:00:48.300> I<00:00:48.480> never<00:00:48.840> ended<00:00:49.200> up<00:00:49.350> working

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
out because I never ended up working

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.630 
out because I never ended up working
this<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.960> I<00:00:51.960> I<00:00:52.559> was<00:00:53.070> trying<00:00:53.370> with<00:00:53.489> like<00:00:53.610> a

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
this and I I was trying with like a

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.869 
this and I I was trying with like a
couple<00:00:53.850> rows<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.600> it<00:00:54.719> never<00:00:55.050> seemed<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.440> work

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:55.879 
couple rows and it never seemed to work

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:58.849 
couple rows and it never seemed to work
and<00:00:56.879> it<00:00:57.570> was<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.690> little<00:00:57.840> frustrating<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.620> me<00:00:58.649> to

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
and it was a little frustrating to me to

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.639 
and it was a little frustrating to me to
be<00:00:58.949> honest<00:00:59.219> with<00:00:59.250> you<00:00:59.579> cuz<00:01:00.570> I<00:01:00.809> was<00:01:01.050> I<00:01:01.230> didn't

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
be honest with you cuz I was I didn't

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.889 
be honest with you cuz I was I didn't
understand<00:01:02.070> why<00:01:02.309> they<00:01:03.120> kept<00:01:03.329> going<00:01:03.480> through

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
understand why they kept going through

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.250 
understand why they kept going through
and<00:01:04.339> there's<00:01:05.339> there's<00:01:05.790> definitely<00:01:06.299> multiple

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
and there's there's definitely multiple

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.929 
and there's there's definitely multiple
multiple<00:01:07.590> ways<00:01:07.890> of<00:01:08.100> doing<00:01:08.220> this<00:01:08.430> cuz<00:01:08.640> I<00:01:08.760> did

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
multiple ways of doing this cuz I did

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.160 
multiple ways of doing this cuz I did
this<00:01:09.030> in<00:01:09.210> another<00:01:09.420> way<00:01:09.570> in<00:01:09.810> my<00:01:09.900> first

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
this in another way in my first

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.649 
this in another way in my first
playthrough<00:01:10.549> but<00:01:11.549> I<00:01:11.580> couldn't<00:01:12.060> remember<00:01:12.270> how

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
playthrough but I couldn't remember how

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.499 
playthrough but I couldn't remember how
I<00:01:12.689> was<00:01:13.170> able<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.500> defeat<00:01:13.890> them<00:01:14.159> so<00:01:15.090> I<00:01:15.150> decided

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
I was able to defeat them so I decided

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.460 
I was able to defeat them so I decided
to<00:01:15.659> go<00:01:15.810> with<00:01:15.990> this<00:01:16.320> strategy<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:18.170> don't<00:01:19.170> need

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
to go with this strategy you don't need

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.740 
to go with this strategy you don't need
that<00:01:19.830> right<00:01:19.860> there<00:01:20.369> that<00:01:20.400> was<00:01:20.880> a<00:01:20.909> mistake<00:01:21.210> I

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
that right there that was a mistake I

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.570 
that right there that was a mistake I
did<00:01:21.930> not<00:01:22.080> mean<00:01:22.259> to<00:01:22.290> do<00:01:22.470> that<00:01:22.500> because<00:01:23.430> that

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
did not mean to do that because that

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.780 
did not mean to do that because that
wasted<00:01:24.420> about<00:01:24.659> 175<00:01:25.619> sunshine<00:01:26.369> units<00:01:26.670> which

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
wasted about 175 sunshine units which

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.170 
wasted about 175 sunshine units which
could<00:01:27.210> have<00:01:27.299> been<00:01:27.420> really<00:01:27.780> helped<00:01:29.060> but<00:01:30.060> you're

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
could have been really helped but you're

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.800 
could have been really helped but you're
gonna<00:01:30.270> want<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.570> put<00:01:30.689> these<00:01:30.810> doom<00:01:31.140> shrooms

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
gonna want to put these doom shrooms

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.120 
gonna want to put these doom shrooms
because<00:01:33.810> they're<00:01:33.930> like<00:01:34.049> grenades<00:01:34.320> and<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:34.950> if

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
because they're like grenades and and if

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.219 
because they're like grenades and and if
you<00:01:35.159> do<00:01:35.369> it<00:01:35.490> like<00:01:35.610> this<00:01:35.880> they'll<00:01:36.570> get<00:01:36.810> all<00:01:37.049> the

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
you do it like this they'll get all the

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.569 
you do it like this they'll get all the
water<00:01:37.380> plants<00:01:37.829> that<00:01:37.920> are<00:01:38.009> coming<00:01:38.340> up<00:01:38.430> the

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
water plants that are coming up the

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.289 
water plants that are coming up the
middle<00:01:39.770> and<00:01:40.770> it<00:01:41.159> actually<00:01:41.310> cost<00:01:41.729> less<00:01:41.880> than

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
middle and it actually cost less than

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.670 
middle and it actually cost less than
you<00:01:42.420> think<00:01:42.450> then<00:01:42.840> like<00:01:43.020> doing<00:01:43.380> like<00:01:43.530> the

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
you think then like doing like the

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.600 
you think then like doing like the
Gatling<00:01:44.130> or<00:01:44.460> anything<00:01:45.170> Gatling<00:01:46.170> gun<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:47.040> then

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
Gatling or anything Gatling gun and then

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.069 
Gatling or anything Gatling gun and then
with<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:47.850> extra<00:01:47.970> if<00:01:48.210> you<00:01:48.240> still<00:01:48.509> had<00:01:48.600> 175

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
with the extra if you still had 175

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.980 
with the extra if you still had 175
actually<00:01:49.530> you<00:01:49.680> could<00:01:50.040> have<00:01:50.570> but<00:01:51.570> I<00:01:51.600> wasn't

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
actually you could have but I wasn't

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.160 
actually you could have but I wasn't
able<00:01:52.290> to<00:01:52.470> because<00:01:53.100> it<00:01:53.460> was<00:01:53.549> a<00:01:53.579> moron<00:01:53.880> put<00:01:54.840> two

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
able to because it was a moron put two

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.410 
able to because it was a moron put two
spiked<00:01:55.770> weeds<00:01:56.040> down<00:01:56.340> but<00:01:57.119> because<00:01:57.270> I

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
spiked weeds down but because I

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.260 
spiked weeds down but because I
accidentally<00:01:58.079> put<00:01:58.290> that<00:01:58.439> blue<00:01:58.619> one<00:01:58.829> there<00:01:59.270> it

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
accidentally put that blue one there it

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.540 
accidentally put that blue one there it
didn't<00:02:00.659> work

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:03.550 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.160 

so<00:02:04.550> this<00:02:04.670> is<00:02:04.820> gonna<00:02:04.970> be<00:02:05.210> probably<00:02:05.690> split<00:02:05.960> into

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
so this is gonna be probably split into

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.450 
so this is gonna be probably split into
two<00:02:06.380> parts<00:02:06.560> because<00:02:06.860> this<00:02:06.980> you're<00:02:07.220> gonna<00:02:07.340> have

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
two parts because this you're gonna have

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.930 
two parts because this you're gonna have
to<00:02:07.550> survive<00:02:07.850> through<00:02:08.119> five<00:02:08.360> flags<00:02:08.690> I<00:02:09.940> believe

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
to survive through five flags I believe

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.110 
to survive through five flags I believe
yeah<00:02:11.450> Fi<00:02:11.690> flags<00:02:11.990> so<00:02:12.680> what<00:02:13.130> the<00:02:13.250> garlic<00:02:13.550> does<00:02:13.760> is

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
yeah Fi flags so what the garlic does is

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.510 
yeah Fi flags so what the garlic does is
they<00:02:14.900> smell<00:02:15.200> it<00:02:15.380> and<00:02:15.500> then<00:02:15.650> they<00:02:15.800> go<00:02:15.950> down<00:02:16.130> to

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
they smell it and then they go down to

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.260 
they smell it and then they go down to
the<00:02:16.790> next<00:02:16.970> row<00:02:17.320> and<00:02:18.320> then<00:02:19.160> you<00:02:19.280> want<00:02:19.460> the<00:02:19.910> snow

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
the next row and then you want the snow

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.650 
the next row and then you want the snow
peas<00:02:20.450> there<00:02:20.720> to<00:02:20.870> slow<00:02:21.080> them<00:02:21.290> down<00:02:22.480> so<00:02:23.480> that

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
peas there to slow them down so that

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:24.850 
peas there to slow them down so that
when<00:02:23.780> they<00:02:23.870> come<00:02:24.110> through<00:02:24.410> this<00:02:24.590> like

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
when they come through this like

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.960 
when they come through this like
gauntlet<00:02:25.930> they<00:02:26.930> don't<00:02:27.670> they<00:02:28.670> don't<00:02:28.700> get

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
gauntlet they don't they don't get

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.590 
gauntlet they don't they don't get
attacked<00:02:29.300> and<00:02:30.970> the<00:02:31.970> doom<00:02:32.120> shrooms<00:02:32.390> are<00:02:32.540> the

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
attacked and the doom shrooms are the

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.540 
attacked and the doom shrooms are the
best<00:02:32.810> just<00:02:33.080> because<00:02:33.140> they<00:02:33.470> can<00:02:33.650> attack<00:02:33.980> like

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
best just because they can attack like

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.910 
best just because they can attack like
in<00:02:34.670> a<00:02:34.760> circle<00:02:35.180> like<00:02:35.510> around<00:02:35.810> them<00:02:36.080> and<00:02:36.260> they

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
in a circle like around them and they

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.950 
in a circle like around them and they
can<00:02:37.070> also<00:02:37.160> go<00:02:37.460> through<00:02:37.670> screen<00:02:38.060> doors<00:02:38.390> and<00:02:38.870> all

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:38.960 
can also go through screen doors and all

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.630 
can also go through screen doors and all
that<00:02:39.140> stuff<00:02:39.440> so<00:02:41.530> like<00:02:42.530> you<00:02:42.710> could<00:02:42.950> get<00:02:43.100> screwed

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
that stuff so like you could get screwed

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.810 
that stuff so like you could get screwed
a<00:02:43.760> little<00:02:44.000> bit<00:02:44.150> here<00:02:44.480> with<00:02:44.630> the<00:02:44.870> whole<00:02:45.820> that

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
a little bit here with the whole that

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:53.710 
a little bit here with the whole that
guy<00:02:47.030> the<00:02:47.710> jumper<00:02:48.710> but<00:02:49.330> luckily<00:02:52.510> like<00:02:53.510> he'll

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
guy the jumper but luckily like he'll

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.230 
guy the jumper but luckily like he'll
jump<00:02:53.960> over<00:02:54.260> the<00:02:54.640> garlic<00:02:55.640> but<00:02:55.850> then<00:02:56.000> like

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:56.240 
jump over the garlic but then like

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.820 
jump over the garlic but then like
that's<00:02:56.630> why<00:02:56.840> you<00:02:56.900> have<00:02:57.020> multiple<00:02:57.410> garlic's

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
that's why you have multiple garlic's

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:04.620 
that's why you have multiple garlic's
there<00:02:58.010> plus<00:02:58.280> the<00:02:58.340> garlic<00:02:58.730> runs<00:02:58.940> out<00:02:59.180> I<00:03:00.190> found

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.500 
actually a little tip that I noticed
when<00:04:22.340> I<00:04:22.400> played<00:04:22.670> this<00:04:24.790> was<00:04:25.790> because<00:04:26.180> since<00:04:26.420> I

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
when I played this was because since I

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:27.940 
when I played this was because since I
screwed<00:04:26.780> up<00:04:26.900> with<00:04:27.020> the<00:04:27.140> snow<00:04:27.380> peas<00:04:27.620> putting

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 
screwed up with the snow peas putting

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:33.900 
screwed up with the snow peas putting
one<00:04:28.190> where<00:04:28.700> it<00:04:29.060> never<00:04:29.540> really<00:04:29.780> gets<00:04:30.050> hit<00:04:31.450> that

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
one where it never really gets hit that

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.040 
one where it never really gets hit that
you<00:04:34.910> know<00:04:35.060> I<00:04:35.120> shouldn't<00:04:35.390> have<00:04:35.450> done<00:04:35.570> that<00:04:35.630> but

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
you know I shouldn't have done that but

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:42.310 
you know I shouldn't have done that but
oh<00:04:36.320> well

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.830 

but<00:04:43.320> luckily<00:04:43.470> there's<00:04:43.830> the<00:04:44.610> shrooms<00:04:45.540> just

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
but luckily there's the shrooms just

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:51.110 
but luckily there's the shrooms just
kill<00:04:46.350> them<00:04:49.160> like<00:04:50.160> this<00:04:50.370> one<00:04:50.550> I<00:04:50.580> was<00:04:50.760> actually<00:04:50.910> a

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
kill them like this one I was actually a

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.820 
kill them like this one I was actually a
little<00:04:51.300> worried<00:04:51.570> about<00:04:51.780> in<00:04:52.110> the<00:04:52.290> very<00:04:52.410> bottom

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
little worried about in the very bottom

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.240 
little worried about in the very bottom
but<00:04:53.210> luckily<00:04:54.210> I<00:04:54.960> slowed<00:04:55.590> it<00:04:55.620> down<00:04:55.740> enough<00:04:56.220> to

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
but luckily I slowed it down enough to

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.730 
but luckily I slowed it down enough to
where<00:04:56.490> the<00:04:57.450> snow<00:04:57.630> pea<00:04:57.780> slowed<00:04:58.050> down<00:04:58.290> enough

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
where the snow pea slowed down enough

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:04.010 
where the snow pea slowed down enough
and<00:05:02.150> you<00:05:03.150> really<00:05:03.360> just<00:05:03.480> need<00:05:03.540> to<00:05:03.720> slow<00:05:03.990> down

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
and you really just need to slow down

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:05.720 
and you really just need to slow down
once<00:05:04.500> cuz<00:05:04.860> once<00:05:05.130> they<00:05:05.220> go<00:05:05.340> over<00:05:05.430> the<00:05:05.520> spike

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:05.730 
once cuz once they go over the spike

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:07.520 
once cuz once they go over the spike
wheeze<00:05:05.940> despite<00:05:06.300> weeds<00:05:06.510> do<00:05:06.720> half<00:05:07.140> the<00:05:07.320> damage

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:07.530 
wheeze despite weeds do half the damage

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:16.010 
wheeze despite weeds do half the damage

worked<00:05:29.160> hard<00:05:29.820> to<00:05:29.940> achieve<00:05:30.060> and<00:05:30.270> that<00:05:30.480> would

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:30.600 
worked hard to achieve and that would

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.080 
worked hard to achieve and that would
suck<00:05:31.160> but<00:05:32.160> as<00:05:32.220> you<00:05:32.310> can<00:05:32.400> see<00:05:32.460> with<00:05:32.670> the<00:05:32.730> onions

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.090

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:38.340 
the other ones are it's because they're

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:41.120 
the other ones are it's because they're
about<00:05:38.520> to<00:05:38.670> run<00:05:38.850> out<00:05:38.880> so<00:05:39.720> just<00:05:40.350> be<00:05:40.500> careful<00:05:40.680> of

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:50.190 
that so this guy should be done pretty

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:54.190 
that so this guy should be done pretty
soon<00:05:50.280> yep<00:05:51.060> successfully<00:05:51.660> defended<00:05:52.050> two<00:05:52.169> flags

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:54.200 
soon yep successfully defended two flags

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:59.080 
soon yep successfully defended two flags
so<00:05:55.200> just<00:05:55.350> pick<00:05:55.500> up<00:05:55.560> the<00:05:55.740> sunshine<00:05:55.950> units<00:05:58.070> and

00:05:59.080 --> 00:05:59.090 
so just pick up the sunshine units and

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:08.250 
there and then continue on slots now see

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:13.100 
there and then continue on slots now see
I<00:06:08.310> have<00:06:08.430> a<00:06:08.490> lot<00:06:08.700> so<00:06:09.120> I<00:06:11.150> think<00:06:12.150> it's<00:06:12.510> in<00:06:12.690> this<00:06:12.870> one

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.110

where yep the onions will go so you want
to<00:06:16.380> put<00:06:16.470> it<00:06:16.590> down<00:06:20.150> yep<00:06:21.180> and<00:06:21.419> as<00:06:21.540> you<00:06:21.690> can<00:06:21.780> see<00:06:21.840> on

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:22.080 
to put it down yep and as you can see on

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:26.300 
to put it down yep and as you can see on
the<00:06:22.200> on<00:06:22.350> the<00:06:22.560> top<00:06:22.770> one<00:06:24.470> that's<00:06:25.470> not<00:06:25.740> great<00:06:26.040> you

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:36.480 
not what you should and you should put a

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:42.320 
not what you should and you should put a
garlic<00:06:36.980> up<00:06:37.980> there<00:06:40.730> luckily<00:06:41.730> I<00:06:41.790> do<00:06:41.940> make<00:06:42.210> you

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:42.330 
garlic up there luckily I do make you

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:46.800 
garlic up there luckily I do make you
through<00:06:42.570> though<00:06:42.750> don't<00:06:42.960> worry

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:46.810 

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:49.090 

but<00:06:47.810> that<00:06:47.930> was<00:06:48.020> not<00:06:48.170> the<00:06:48.230> smartest<00:06:48.710> move<00:06:48.920> in

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:49.100 
but that was not the smartest move in

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:57.740 
but that was not the smartest move in
the<00:06:49.190> world<00:06:49.340> on<00:06:49.700> my<00:06:49.730> part

00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:57.750 

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:00.390 

just<00:06:58.750> because<00:06:59.020> if<00:06:59.199> if<00:06:59.470> they<00:06:59.830> had<00:07:00.009> just<00:07:00.220> been

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:00.400 
just because if if they had just been

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:03.240 
just because if if they had just been
smelling<00:07:00.819> it<00:07:00.939> like<00:07:01.210> a<00:07:01.240> lot<00:07:01.539> he<00:07:02.349> could<00:07:02.620> have<00:07:02.770> the

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:03.250 
smelling it like a lot he could have the

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:04.920 
smelling it like a lot he could have the
second<00:07:03.550> one<00:07:03.610> could<00:07:03.789> have<00:07:03.909> gone<00:07:04.419> away<00:07:04.569> even

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:04.930 
second one could have gone away even

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:07.520 
second one could have gone away even
though<00:07:05.020> I<00:07:05.050> don't<00:07:05.560> I<00:07:05.770> think<00:07:05.919> it<00:07:05.979> takes<00:07:06.159> two

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:07.530 
though I don't I think it takes two

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:14.249 
though I don't I think it takes two
rotations<00:07:08.530> for<00:07:08.860> it<00:07:08.979> to<00:07:09.189> go<00:07:09.310> through<00:07:13.169> so<00:07:14.169> in

00:07:14.249 --> 00:07:14.259 
rotations for it to go through so in

00:07:14.259 --> 00:07:15.390 
rotations for it to go through so in
this<00:07:14.319> video<00:07:14.469> we'll<00:07:14.680> be<00:07:14.800> showing<00:07:14.860> the<00:07:15.159> first

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:15.400 
this video we'll be showing the first

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:18.029 
this video we'll be showing the first
three<00:07:15.719> flags<00:07:16.719> and<00:07:17.080> then<00:07:17.229> the<00:07:17.500> next<00:07:17.740> video<00:07:17.949> will

00:07:18.029 --> 00:07:18.039 
three flags and then the next video will

00:07:18.039 --> 00:07:20.520 
three flags and then the next video will
show<00:07:18.159> the<00:07:18.189> next<00:07:18.520> two<00:07:18.840> considering<00:07:19.840> I<00:07:20.050> think<00:07:20.469> it

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:20.530 
show the next two considering I think it

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:22.529 
show the next two considering I think it
takes<00:07:20.680> like<00:07:20.800> 13<00:07:21.490> 14<00:07:21.789> minutes<00:07:22.210> to<00:07:22.240> get<00:07:22.360> through

00:07:22.529 --> 00:07:22.539 
takes like 13 14 minutes to get through

00:07:22.539 --> 00:07:25.230 
takes like 13 14 minutes to get through
this<00:07:23.159> takes<00:07:24.159> a<00:07:24.250> little<00:07:24.340> bit<00:07:24.490> longer<00:07:24.639> than<00:07:24.969> you

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:25.240 
this takes a little bit longer than you

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:30.300 
this takes a little bit longer than you
would<00:07:25.750> think<00:07:28.050> so<00:07:29.050> even<00:07:29.379> even<00:07:29.469> the<00:07:29.710> dolphin<00:07:30.099> guy

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:30.310 
would think so even even the dolphin guy

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:32.909 
would think so even even the dolphin guy
gets<00:07:31.270> gets<00:07:31.750> pretty<00:07:32.020> much<00:07:32.169> destroyed<00:07:32.650> through

00:07:32.909 --> 00:07:32.919 
gets gets pretty much destroyed through

00:07:32.919 --> 00:07:43.790 
gets gets pretty much destroyed through
here<00:07:38.550> which<00:07:39.550> is<00:07:39.759> pretty<00:07:40.150> awesome

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:43.800
