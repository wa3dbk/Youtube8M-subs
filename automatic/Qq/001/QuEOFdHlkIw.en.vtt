00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:09.290
 We will introduce the reflection by the mirror 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:14.180
 In First Okagami plane Kyoto is frequently used most 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:15.530
 I like to make such a great flat day mirror I also put it in a dedicated place or something 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:22.880
 think 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:26.360
 In looks Well sleep well reflected their own face Toka ne various things in this mirror whether it Gado reflected the 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:30.779
 For example, a person enters the Well have seen here in 1 Well 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:35.970
 Well there was a body of sound triangle say 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:41.610
 So how does the light go through to this person 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:47.850
 First of all, the red part of this story is transmitted like this. 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:53.100
 Joined by the cool call her car's sound reflection also according to the law 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:57.020
 Reflections occur and this reflection is a bit of a sign until this person's 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:01:00.530
 In the same way, the light coming out of this yellow spot is also 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:07.800
 Go to the mirror and run according to the law of reflection 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:13.520
 In in this light is going to go to this person light that this person see is because two of the light day of cat 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:20.990
 It looks like it came from an extension of this light 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:23.640
 In the ceiling of this extension, but it looks like it looks like a good image on the extension 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:28.150
 Say there is a statue on the other side of 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:34.670
 I say in this time hate virtual image 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:40.600
 It seems like there is an image on the other side of the reflected light child like this 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:40.600
 This is the reflection from the plane mirror and then the chest image appears 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:53.410
 Sound car of the next concave mirror I will introduce this briefly again 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:55.500
 Mirror of a convex to the bottom of in is good now when you rely on the parallel configuration to the concave mirror of the sun this I like this concave mirror 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:57.710
 It is this ramen 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:02.420
 The light becomes dead eyes 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:06.619
 In when exposed to another parallel rays and here to shed sunlight 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:08.929
 Bent a light in accordance with the high Well Huh's supplement 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:13.459
 Oh, let me bend 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:19.890
 You only be Kedomo I reflection occurs in the law of reflection therefore bent 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:26.490
 When you collect light , you will actually gather at one point with collimation 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:27.450
 In which it kneaded and actually wins the point in this case is doing well this parallel beam sunlight ahead to the concave mirror 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.950
 I will 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:35.769
 The Only way of so went I reflection 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:37.810
 So light gathers here so put frying pan and grilled omelet here 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:40.520
 You can either say cooking and 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:46.170
 Well I was able to wake up 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:51.750
 I the heat of the light so well doing this I Using a concave mirror can collect light 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:57.720
 If I can do that kind of cooking that fires already, I can use it for such things 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:03:05.310
 Next, let 's follow that focus, what will happen to the light for the time being ? 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:07.030
 Next When the light is say what will happen to do this to will be converted ne anti-parallel to the opposite wall high school students 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:11.880
 And be replaced 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:16.910
 If you become a fair high school student, the light that has passed the winning points will come back 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.910
 When the Well these were we feature is the reflection of the concave mirror 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:27.410
 It will be before soldiers high school students in Well Pts taken up light root method license 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:31.940
 I will introduce the reflection by two plane mirrors soon 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:34.260
 Convex mirror to the upper side of the projection is and mirrors on it in this kind of Fu 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:40.739
 If the film of Ging is stretched 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:41.099
 In the convex mirror, if you say that what kind of reflection is done when parallel high birth support is done, 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:42.650
 Too 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:48.770
 There is a shop 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:50.900
 This comes when the light is cat as out of the Toko shop that you wear the next what in Heh high school students 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:56.780
 I will reflect 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:04:01.580
 When the light is reflected as the parallel beam next to it also goes out of the store 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:06.380
 In the case of a convex mirror with such a characteristic of hey reflection 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:09.000
 When the reflection comes doing Let the rowing parallel light rays man soldiers high school students place as out of the shop 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:11.650
 Bouncing and buying as if it came out of the store 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.920
 These features are the first 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:20.350
 What happens to the light going to the two major stores 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:23.020
 We came this light toward the apex me the strength focus if there is a convex mirror 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:26.319
 Go straight I should go shopping 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:32.729
 This light is converted to parallel next 

00:04:26.319 --> 00:04:40.199
 So when the light going to the negotiating sky is poured into the next shot and it is returned to the parallel configuration 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:41.620
 Toward the Kamune store with these features , parallel rays hit this convex mirror 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:43.520
 Will be replaced 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:48.080
 When I become a high school student 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:52.760
 This convex mirror is most commonly used in what kind of place it is used 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:58.910
 Well , it is that mirror that is well on the road etc. Safety today 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:05:02.090
 There is an assessment for the right side of the corner in the left corner. 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:08.510
 There I think you mirror gold that stood sleeping 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:12.020
 And what happens if you put a convex mirror like that there is a triangular object like this 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:12.750
 Is here this person is I intersection told Nde 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.599
 This directly 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:22.680
 I have Nashi'm doing is I'm invisible wall 

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:29.729
 I can not see it directly , but by using a convex mirror, the light that came out of here is absolutely 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:35.470
 You bounce hit the convex mirror in Akoko since the light is coming of this person in and light it Sokko 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:37.830
 This that an object with'll there something triangle can be seen to Tteyuu Aruzo to 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:40.240
 One year of today 's reflection 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:45.099
 Using features 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:46.500
 Well recognized and well to do this is to be able to pick up by this doing the light of place in the visual 

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:50.130
 And can 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:52.270
 Well Nee of Ne' convex mirror in the place where went so 

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:56.070
 Nature is used 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:06:00.710
 It is easy but mirror is reflected 

00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:00.710
 For example Well we introduced about three famous far from
