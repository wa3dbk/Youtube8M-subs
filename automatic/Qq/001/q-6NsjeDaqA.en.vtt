00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:10.049
 hello gadget addicts here we have a 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:13.049
 very strange camera is the sony r x 10 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:14.879
 as its name indicates rx corresponds to 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.590
 the elite to the crème de la crème de las 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:19.200
 cameras sony 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.360
 strange because it's a compact one is not 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.510
 you can change the shaped goals 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.640
 of reflex is big is heavy then 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.650
 what advantages has the advantages is that 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.200
 you have in one camera the fusion of 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.170
 virtues or advantages of many cameras 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.900
 to start you have a very powerful zoom 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.480
 very powerful and very bright no less 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.910
 that an axis 28 throughout its long run 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.600
 and is supported by a large sensor 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.730
 size you want to give in detail 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.680
 its ergonomics is fantastic with a 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:52.050
 excellent grip where all the 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:54.570
 fingers are very comfortable 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.050
 this is the compensation wheel of 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.050
 exposition 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.610
 another wheel for adjusting values 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:11.010
 in the zoom we find the ring a 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.010
 mechanical ring for diaphragm travel 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.540
 here you have the zoom manager so 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.540
 motorized 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.509
 a button that is to customize 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.509
 functions 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:31.280
 and on the back another button fn 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:34.030
 for a quick menu 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.030
 an electronic viewfinder 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:43.450
 and the mode dial that has all the 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.450
 options that an advanced user wants 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:49.700
 the rear monitor is collapsible in 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:53.670
 vertical sense 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:55.860
 and eye is not tactile 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.210
 and the objective without disparagement of 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.549
 any other component that we 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.700
 forgive the great sensor the goal is the 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:05.490
 true protagonist of the r x 10 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.610
 is equivalent to 24 200 millimeters with the 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:12.300
 fixed aperture of f 28 and stabilization 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:14.640
 integrated optics is affirmed by six 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.800
 what is a guarantee apart from the aforementioned 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.959
 fragment ring that I am moving 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.810
 here now has another ring for 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:23.360
 handle the zoom 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.310
 eye this blue can also be managed 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.480
 in a motorized way as we have seen 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.340
 here 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.860
 with this other the approach 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:36.260
 Removal is slower than if we use 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:39.409
 this other motorized mode 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:42.200
 that we have found the son and rx 10 us 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:44.090
 has liked and quite the combination of 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.430
 a large sensor with a goal 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.319
 of such a long journey was undoubtedly a 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.510
 complicated challenge for engineers of 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:52.430
 sony they have done a good job there 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.260
 have to say that his approach system does not 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.720
 is among its most relevant qualities 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.060
 without being clumsy we think that it is not to the 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.099
 height of the very good very good that is 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:04.010
 the rest of the set in what is 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:06.950
 refers to noise manages it very well not 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:09.530
 appear shots with iso up to 1600 by 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.930
 over and starts to bother a little 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:14.329
 but is that with this camera it will be very 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.700
 difficult to have to go to such high 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:18.709
 sensitivities in fact you have a 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:22.970
 flash seems more like a whim than a 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:24.170
 useful element as soon as you use it and 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.480
 the dynamic range has also 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.670
 very broad super similar 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.950
 now we recommend that if you are 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:33.799
 very exquisite you dedicate to shoot in 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:36.319
 road mode to be surprised with the 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:39.260
 richness of color that is able to achieve 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:43.959
 this camera if you delegate at x 10 for 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.959
 get a jp you can take some 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.070
 the fact that the compensation dial 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:52.410
 of the exhibition is so at hand is already 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:55.100
 a way of saying that we are facing a 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:57.960
 camera defined for advanced users 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:00.900
 If you are among them or want to be 

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:03.900
 the rx 10 must be between your cameras 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:06.330
 Favorite fast effective intelligent 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.580
 versatile is an all-in-one camera 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.440
 all-in-one very well built and with a 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:13.500
 goal that is the best in its 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:15.180
 ultra zoom category for its weight and 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.320
 Dimensions is not a comfortable camera 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.820
 transport 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.250
 but the satisfactions that you can 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.440
 report will be worth it for 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:25.820
 Always carry the backpack that if 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.820
 prepare the portfolio
