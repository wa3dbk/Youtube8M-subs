00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
boxes aren't there anymore I unbolted

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.910 
boxes aren't there anymore I unbolted
those<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:41.130> took<00:00:41.490> out<00:00:41.990> the<00:00:42.990> little<00:00:43.500> intake

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
those and took out the little intake

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.720 
those and took out the little intake
plenum<00:00:44.930> that<00:00:45.930> ran<00:00:46.260> back<00:00:46.530> into<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.130> carbs<00:00:47.520> and

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
plenum that ran back into the carbs and

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.880 
plenum that ran back into the carbs and
I<00:00:47.820> took<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.180> boots<00:00:48.390> off<00:00:51.050> for<00:00:52.050> filters<00:00:52.620> right

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
I took the boots off for filters right

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.930 
I took the boots off for filters right
now<00:00:53.130> this<00:00:53.910> is<00:00:54.120> actually<00:00:54.390> an<00:00:55.020> old<00:00:55.860> socks<00:00:56.340> I<00:00:56.670> had

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
now this is actually an old socks I had

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.490 
now this is actually an old socks I had
a<00:00:56.970> couple<00:00:57.270> old<00:00:57.420> socks<00:00:57.750> that<00:00:57.930> had<00:00:58.020> holes<00:00:58.260> in

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
a couple old socks that had holes in

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.740 
a couple old socks that had holes in
them<00:00:58.650> and<00:00:58.770> I<00:00:59.520> had<00:00:59.700> to<00:00:59.790> play<00:00:59.970> around<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.420> get<00:01:00.570> the

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
them and I had to play around to get the

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.170 
them and I had to play around to get the
filtration<00:01:01.710> system<00:01:01.860> right<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.580> right<00:01:02.790> amount

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
filtration system right the right amount

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.270 
filtration system right the right amount
and<00:01:03.710> so<00:01:04.710> it's<00:01:04.979> a<00:01:05.519> mm<00:01:06.210> just<00:01:06.659> one<00:01:06.780> layer<00:01:07.170> of<00:01:07.770> sock

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
and so it's a mm just one layer of sock

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.099 
and so it's a mm just one layer of sock
and<00:01:08.520> these<00:01:08.640> are<00:01:08.820> just<00:01:09.030> your<00:01:09.240> regular<00:01:09.539> cotton

00:01:10.099 --> 00:01:10.109 
and these are just your regular cotton

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:11.599 
and these are just your regular cotton
athletic<00:01:11.039> socks

00:01:11.599 --> 00:01:11.609 
athletic socks

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:14.149 
athletic socks
mm<00:01:12.539> I<00:01:12.750> believe<00:01:13.140> they<00:01:13.229> were<00:01:13.289> a<00:01:13.409> crew-cut<00:01:13.679> to

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
mm I believe they were a crew-cut to

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.880 
mm I believe they were a crew-cut to
start<00:01:14.429> with<00:01:14.659> but<00:01:15.659> I<00:01:16.020> just<00:01:16.229> took<00:01:16.380> cut<00:01:16.649> me<00:01:16.770> out<00:01:16.799> of

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
start with but I just took cut me out of

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.209 
start with but I just took cut me out of
square<00:01:17.280> of<00:01:17.579> that<00:01:17.999> and<00:01:18.499> right<00:01:19.499> now<00:01:19.649> I<00:01:19.710> have<00:01:19.859> zip

00:01:20.209 --> 00:01:20.219 
square of that and right now I have zip

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.840 
square of that and right now I have zip
ties

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
ties

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.510 
ties
later<00:01:21.090> on<00:01:21.299> I'll<00:01:21.450> probably<00:01:21.749> up<00:01:22.200> it<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.740> a<00:01:22.770> actual

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
later on I'll probably up it to a actual

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.739 
later on I'll probably up it to a actual
clamp<00:01:24.890> but<00:01:25.890> I<00:01:26.490> basically<00:01:26.909> took<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.179> filters

00:01:27.739 --> 00:01:27.749 
clamp but I basically took the filters

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:30.679 
clamp but I basically took the filters
the<00:01:28.409> air<00:01:28.590> box<00:01:28.799> is<00:01:29.039> off<00:01:29.219> in<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.700> piece<00:01:30.420> in<00:01:30.600> the

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
the air box is off in the piece in the

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.149 
the air box is off in the piece in the
center<00:01:30.960> um<00:01:31.439> I<00:01:32.429> had<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:33.060> plug<00:01:33.499> this<00:01:34.499> vacuum<00:01:34.979> line

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
center um I had to plug this vacuum line

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.809 
center um I had to plug this vacuum line
on<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.399> right<00:01:35.579> side<00:01:35.609> carb<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:36.679> then<00:01:37.679> I<00:01:37.979> left

00:01:38.809 --> 00:01:38.819 
on the right side carb and then I left

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:40.580 
on the right side carb and then I left
instead<00:01:39.090> of<00:01:39.270> buying<00:01:39.689> some<00:01:39.990> coasters<00:01:40.380> and

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
instead of buying some coasters and

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.399 
instead of buying some coasters and
making<00:01:40.859> some<00:01:41.100> it<00:01:41.939> was<00:01:42.149> just<00:01:42.359> easier<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:42.840> take

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
making some it was just easier to take

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.679 
making some it was just easier to take
and<00:01:43.710> leave<00:01:43.920> all<00:01:44.249> these<00:01:44.429> old<00:01:44.700> emissions<00:01:45.210> hoses

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
and leave all these old emissions hoses

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.190 
and leave all these old emissions hoses
in<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.139> I<00:01:47.009> actually<00:01:47.219> took<00:01:47.759> a<00:01:47.999> marble<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:48.960> put

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
in and I actually took a marble and put

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.200 
in and I actually took a marble and put
on<00:01:49.319> inside<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.130> hose<00:01:50.340> here<00:01:50.639> and<00:01:50.789> then<00:01:50.909> slipped

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
on inside the hose here and then slipped

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.190 
on inside the hose here and then slipped
it<00:01:51.329> back<00:01:51.509> on<00:01:51.749> to<00:01:52.469> plug<00:01:52.710> that<00:01:52.950> off<00:01:53.600> as<00:01:54.600> to

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
it back on to plug that off as to

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.870 
it back on to plug that off as to
getting<00:01:55.560> her<00:01:55.710> tuned<00:01:56.039> in<00:01:57.979> you<00:01:58.979> can<00:01:59.130> see<00:01:59.310> I'm

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
getting her tuned in you can see I'm

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.969 
getting her tuned in you can see I'm
underneath<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.749> vacuum<00:02:01.139> hoses<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.770> air

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
underneath the vacuum hoses the air

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.279 
underneath the vacuum hoses the air
screws<00:02:02.399> I<00:02:02.729> actually<00:02:03.539> turned<00:02:03.929> them<00:02:04.079> about

00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:04.289 
screws I actually turned them about

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:07.780 
screws I actually turned them about
three<00:02:04.560> turns<00:02:04.799> out<00:02:05.069> each<00:02:05.299> for<00:02:06.299> each<00:02:06.329> carb<00:02:06.810> and

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
three turns out each for each carb and

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.070 
three turns out each for each carb and
I'll<00:02:08.790> pull<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.210> plugs<00:02:09.479> here<00:02:09.660> in<00:02:09.750> just<00:02:09.930> a

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
I'll pull the plugs here in just a

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.540 
I'll pull the plugs here in just a
second<00:02:10.500> I'll<00:02:10.560> pause<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:10.979> video<00:02:12.170> but

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
second I'll pause the video but

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:21.219 
it on the Marketplace on this bike
better<00:04:18.320> than<00:04:18.620> that<00:04:18.799> it<00:04:19.039> is<00:04:19.070> stock<00:04:19.549> I<00:04:20.139> noticed<00:04:21.139> a

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:21.229 
better than that it is stock I noticed a

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:29.320 
better than that it is stock I noticed a
little<00:04:21.500> increase<00:04:22.190> in<00:04:22.639> the<00:04:22.940> in<00:04:23.509> the<00:04:25.539> volume<00:04:28.090> mmm

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
little increase in the in the volume mmm

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.300 
little increase in the in the volume mmm
and<00:04:30.050> I've<00:04:30.289> noticed<00:04:30.530> a<00:04:30.710> little<00:04:30.889> bit<00:04:31.130> of<00:04:31.220> an

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
and I've noticed a little bit of an

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:42.520 
and I've noticed a little bit of an
increase<00:04:31.570> you<00:04:32.570> know<00:04:32.720> in<00:04:32.990> the<00:04:33.139> sound

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:42.530 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:46.040 

so<00:04:43.530> that's<00:04:43.890> how<00:04:44.070> she's<00:04:44.310> running<00:04:44.790> as<00:04:45.720> you<00:04:45.900> can

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
so that's how she's running as you can

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.050 
so that's how she's running as you can
see<00:04:46.290> you<00:04:46.530> know<00:04:46.650> no<00:04:46.860> ill<00:04:47.100> effects<00:04:47.460> from<00:04:47.580> doing

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
see you know no ill effects from doing

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:52.760 
see you know no ill effects from doing
this<00:04:48.270> um<00:04:48.800> I<00:04:49.800> will<00:04:50.340> note<00:04:50.580> that<00:04:50.630> the<00:04:51.630> mpg<00:04:52.470> is<00:04:52.530> down

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
this um I will note that the mpg is down

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.560 
this um I will note that the mpg is down
just<00:04:53.040> a<00:04:53.160> little<00:04:53.190> bit<00:04:53.520> but<00:04:53.880> it's<00:04:54.060> probably<00:04:54.330> just

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:54.570 
just a little bit but it's probably just

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:55.670 
just a little bit but it's probably just
my<00:04:54.750> driving<00:04:55.050> style

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
my driving style

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:00.540 
you know that sucks the fuel to go

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.210 
you know that sucks the fuel to go
faster<00:05:01.020> then<00:05:01.200> you<00:05:01.380> know<00:05:01.500> cruising<00:05:02.130> the

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220 
faster then you know cruising the

for the pilot jet and a 132 for the main

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:52.460 
for the pilot jet and a 132 for the main
jet<00:05:49.890> so<00:05:50.370> with<00:05:50.640> this<00:05:50.850> setup<00:05:51.180> you<00:05:51.570> know<00:05:52.080> it's<00:05:52.290> not

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:52.470 
jet so with this setup you know it's not

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:53.870 
jet so with this setup you know it's not
looking<00:05:52.890> like<00:05:52.920> I'm<00:05:53.190> going<00:05:53.400> to<00:05:53.460> have<00:05:53.520> to<00:05:53.670> read

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:53.880 
looking like I'm going to have to read

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.390 
looking like I'm going to have to read
yet<00:05:54.090> at<00:05:54.270> all<00:05:54.510> you<00:05:55.470> know<00:05:55.620> it<00:05:55.830> can<00:05:56.070> be<00:05:56.100> done

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:56.400 
yet at all you know it can be done

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.850 
yet at all you know it can be done
without<00:05:56.550> rejecting<00:05:57.210> and<00:05:57.510> she<00:05:58.380> seems<00:05:58.650> to<00:05:58.710> be

00:05:58.850 --> 00:05:58.860 
without rejecting and she seems to be

00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:59.770 
without rejecting and she seems to be
running<00:05:59.010> just<00:05:59.280> fine

00:05:59.770 --> 00:05:59.780 
running just fine

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.480 
running just fine
so<00:06:00.780> hopefully<00:06:01.260> this<00:06:01.560> gives<00:06:01.770> somebody<00:06:02.280> else

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:02.490 
so hopefully this gives somebody else

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:04.880 
so hopefully this gives somebody else
and<00:06:02.700> I<00:06:02.760> did<00:06:03.060> they're<00:06:03.420> wanting<00:06:03.750> to<00:06:03.900> if<00:06:04.620> they
