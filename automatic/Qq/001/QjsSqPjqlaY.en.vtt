00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.180
 or the followed by android in this tutorial 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.220
 we will discuss how to make permission 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.610
 of superuser or root in our 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.640
 phone samsung galaxy train plus or gts 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:30.900
 75-80 using the v root application 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.760
 also say that this method is 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.710
 compatible with many more terminals so 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:37.910
 you just have to check that it recognizes 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.070
 our device we go there 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:43.550
 ok now let's proceed to root the 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.920
 phone samsung galaxy 3 plus or gts 75 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:49.250
 80 let's root it through the 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.330
 program v root a complete program that 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.890
 would serve for the skill of 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.989
 devices as long as the 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.760
 program recognize it first let's 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:58.210
 check that we are not really 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:01.790
 root users uses the application 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:04.729
 Checker to verify it as you can 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.030
 check effectively I'm not a user 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:07.990
 root 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.240
 now let's proceed to do it 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.460
 both with making them superuser and 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.579
 to stop being it, we must activate 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.560
 debug usb in the menu 

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:20.710
 developer for it we'll go to 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:23.020
 settings menu we will look for the options of 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:26.549
 developer and we will activate the box 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.549
 debug usb 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.260
 we accept and 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.670
 ready we should also remember that 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.890
 we should have install the drivers 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.570
 of our device in our 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.830
 computer 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.410
 after this we will have to connect 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:44.520
 by micro usb our device 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.520
 to pc 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.430
 next on our computer 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.290
 we will execute the application v root and 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.890
 we will wait for the system to recognize 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.930
 our device 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:04.330
 will ask us if we want to allow the 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.330
 debug usb we will have to accept 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.470
 once finished recognizing our 

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:15.180
 device we will appear the word light 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.870
 in green 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.870
 we press 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.549
 and will start the parameters for 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.549
 get root user 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.859
 I have finished surrounding the phone 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.340
 will restart and automatically 

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:39.920
 we will follow root 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.610
 once our device is restarted 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.980
 we will proceed to verify that 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.810
 we are effectively root users for 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.350
 we will do the operation again 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:51.040
 with ruth checker 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.040
 we execute 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.599
 and we verify 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.410
 As you can check effectively already 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:03.410
 we are root users 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.090
 the only but of this application is that 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:11.090
 we generate an envelope and a 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.680
 Asian market version 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.090
 has easy solution simply 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.500
 we will have to download the superuser 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:20.360
 Spanish version and uninstall the market 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.100
 let's go to it 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.440
 first of all let's install the 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:27.610
 super user in Spanish for it we 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.610
 we will go to the play store 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.700
 we will look 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.720
 Super user 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.079
 I usually download is always 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:45.940
 click and install 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:05.340
 once we have installed it we will give it 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.340
 to open 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:19.500
 will ask us if the binaries are due 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:23.630
 to update we will give you continue 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.630
 here I always recommend doing normal 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:32.699
 As you see, he asks for your permission 

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:36.150
 superuser but from the Chinese superuser 

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:38.509
 with which we will give the button of the 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.509
 right 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:47.560
 once installed it tells you that there is another 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:51.140
 superuser program that if we want 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:54.260
 uninstall it we will accept 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:57.310
 decipher the Chinese superuser and we 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.310
 will leave in Spanish 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:17.050
 Once completed we will give you to accept 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:18.880
 and will ask us for the different programs that 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.480
 we have to ask for permission 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.690
 Super user 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:26.740
 will tell us if we want to accept or not in 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.740
 my case should allow it 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:38.169
 we already have the superuser in Spanish 

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:40.240
 last only to eliminate the 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:43.289
 Asian prehistory for this we 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.289
 we will go to settings 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:48.530
 application administrator and 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:52.370
 we will look for that Asian application 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:52.370
 it is usually always at the end 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:06:00.210
 here we have we will press and 

00:05:58.099 --> 00:06:03.080
 we will install 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:03.080
 we accept 

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:10.600
 and that's it, we have the phones 

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:12.430
 rooteado and with super suar yo in Spanish 

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:13.750
 well that's all for now if 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:15.880

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:20.520
