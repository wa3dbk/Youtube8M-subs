00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
here and then after Program Files we're

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.810 
here and then after Program Files we're
going<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.100> look<00:00:53.190> for<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.520> steam<00:00:53.850> folder<00:00:55.820> and

that we need to put in like the key
representation<00:02:48.280> could<00:02:48.580> deal<00:02:48.970> and<00:02:49.239> that's

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
representation could deal and that's

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:58.940 
representation could deal and that's
going<00:02:50.260> to<00:02:50.320> be<00:02:50.470> K<00:02:50.769> P<00:02:51.780> underscore<00:02:52.780> and

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
in by ak-47 that right there is a

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.740 
in by ak-47 that right there is a
command<00:03:22.530> and<00:03:22.769> that<00:03:23.310> we<00:03:24.090> can<00:03:24.269> leave<00:03:24.450> it<00:03:24.599> like
