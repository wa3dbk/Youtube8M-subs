 wee 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:18.970
 no.5 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:24.430
 The second sentence of the lpg line is settled 3 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:29.470
 Then the pair up when holding Muro had a reply 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:33.940
 The people who do the real thing have to reply with the conditions that they work best . 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:38.630
 Flood savings and quality also have a good effect. Why antagonize the following procedure 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:41.600
 Oh geureogin much smaller DEMI probably will arise so that 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:46.820
 Comparing that we make a lot of clothes when we make marts 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:51.560
 The kid would say that this is hard to call pushes up doing any such film 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:52.640
 So our korea's crane is quite magnificent and ruled more in size 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:57.380
 Much 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:59.530

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.530
 There is 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:10.500
 The lpg line that started counting from the ground since 2006 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.500
 It is scheduled to be handed over in November 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:17.619
 So how do you make a statement on a ship built on the land? 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:24.259
 First, push the vessel up to l and move it to a floating barge in the sea 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:32.659
 After three nights in diameter, move the barges go deep into the depths of 5 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.680
 The ship is submerged in the sea, 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:56.740
 Selected as one of the world's top 10 consulting projects with Buzz Dubai, Sun Incheon Bridge 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.740
 Construction site 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.670
 U 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:09.590
 Incheon Grand Bridge is a round-trip connecting Yeongjongdo, the international airport of Songdo, and Songdo International City. 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.590
 It's a six-lane road. 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:18.980
 The construction started in 2005, and 70% of the process is now completed. 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:30.560
 Inchotak, the center bridge of Incheon Bridge , the best 4 officers in Korea 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:34.239
 The height of the pillar is 230 8.5 m 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.239
 It's as high as the building of the Military Academy. 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:45.350
 The Incheon Bridge Project , including the main construction of the main tower, 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.350
 The activity of 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.500
 The most impressive of them is the ship crane 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:03:02.680
 Height 80 6m Width 45m This is a large-scale marine cranes 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.680
 All 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:15.350
 3000-ton marine crane is a key anti-ship collision facilities De gappun this example 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.350
 Height 40m Throat 900 ton 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.650
 It is a huge cylindrical structure with a diameter of 15 meters 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:35.400
 The collision-avoidance facility is made up of dozens of iron plates joined together in a cylindrical shape 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:44.940
 This structure was made by Song Do Chan, who was provided for smooth self-supply. 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:56.480
 A maritime crane that started operations at 6 o'clock in the morning 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.480
 I finally set out for my destination. 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:06.160
 A tugboat pulls a floating crane on a powerless barge 

00:04:21.439 --> 00:04:31.270
 g The marine clay arriving at the destination within 2 hours after the deletion 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:33.300
 The place is a bridge connecting the four officers and connecting 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.300

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:49.120
 It is an anti-collision gold construction that protects the Incheon Grand Bridge pylon . 

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:52.599
 It protects the main tower from collision or surging vessels at the time of the collision 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:57.789
 To secure the stability of the navigating vessels. 

00:04:52.599 --> 00:05:01.169
 We study the cells built on the land using a recreational crane 

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:01.169
 It is a marine structure installed . 

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:12.569
 The anti-collision ball will be installed around the pylon and connecting pier and 38 other 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:23.720
 The live flounder able to keep the conflict from up to 10 million tons change 3 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.720
 Collision Ring 0 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:31.260
 The anti-collision ball planted in the sea plays a role like a car bumper 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:42.400
 Lee Won-young will fill the barrel with stone and sand of 200 mm or less in size 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:53.250
 Target Gray also contributes to the work of putting the piper structure 

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:22.400
 The operation of a 3,000-ton sea crane with a rental cost of 100 million won 

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:22.400
 I will be around 2 o'clock .

 Incheon Bridge starts construction from the foundation of the bridge. 

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:45.960
 The 800m long cable-stayed bridge pylon section will be able to accommodate the tripods of the same size. 

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:51.650
 It was designed. 

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:51.650
