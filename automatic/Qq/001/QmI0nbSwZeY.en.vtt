00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.190
 when we talk about diesel locomotives 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.050
 of French line we think 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.670
 immediately to these blue locomotives 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.670
 with their big side arrows 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.840
 it's all this generation of machines 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.809
 for passenger services and 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:01:00.340
 heavy goods that comes to mind 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:02.620
 the babies 67000 and aa at aa 68000 called 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:05.970
 commonly yahia sixty thousand or 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:08.140
 more simply the 68 built of 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.940
 1963 to 1975 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.320
 they represent the beginnings of the 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.720
 great era of diesel traction 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.369
 heavy in France 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.770
 half a century after the delivery of 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:19.869
 first units nearly half remains 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.940
 in service but their days are numbered 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:24.789
 replacement of reversible trains 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:27.399
 ter and even some coral oars 

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:29.350
 by self-propelled equipment let go of 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:31.000
 freight traffic and the arrival of 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.580
 new machines in this activity 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.060
 announces the inevitable disappearance of 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.060
 these machines 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.729
 these two machines taken over by the sncf 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.770
 have provided many fast trains 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.659
 after the war proving the 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.540
 ability to replace traction 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.100
 steam on fast trains heavy but 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.560
 these prototypes were expensive to maintain 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.560
 and did not have immediate descent 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.780
 the order of the 67000 babies did 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.930
 subject of four successive contracts 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.980
 spent between 1960 and 65 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.810
 the construction of the crate and 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.459
 final assembly are done by 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.730
 establishments brissonneau and lot to 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:22.560
 aytré near la rochelle the elements 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.820
 electromechanical devices were provided by 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.820
 the factories of the mt group 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.230
 like most new gear 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.120
 diesel is on the long dresses of 25

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.720
 67 and 68 thousand have undergone the tests of 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.720
 power and efficiency 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:47.030
 as the hydraulic transmission allows 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.920
 a significant weight gain compared to 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:52.640

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:03.110
 available power was from 2006 120

 first commissioning of 

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:38.739
 new diesels have taken place from 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.239
 the summer of 1963 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:41.569

 Cevennes line is also one of the 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.830
 favorite playgrounds of machines and 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:11.300
 this from the late 60s with the 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:13.350
