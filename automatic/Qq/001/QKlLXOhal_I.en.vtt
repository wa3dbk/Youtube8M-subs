 maybe not what we know that a staging of hydrology nÃ®mes 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.950
 the choreographer we edited especially to spice up the show 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.640
 of the competition 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.750
 yes we discussed with him the project being compatible 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.750
 we are exactly on the same wavelength 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.450
 Why 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.239
 at this price 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.800
 with afp fax etc etc 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.420
 at worst for us because I know that natacha was going to present for this 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.400
 contest a number of very tonic extracts from don quixote cambrai 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.580
 in the kitchen pieces of bravery if I dare say we ask a lot of 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.540
 presence at sand sir watching the cobra I thought it would not be 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.780
 wrong to do that in counterpoint network stop precarious contracts lie 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.780
 all at bottom 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:24.260
 behind this TV series modern dance interests you of course 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:27.329
 it allows young people to flourish 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:30.989
 the task is also an excellent classical dance team but this 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.900
 choreography allow him to express all his personal sensitivity all 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.249
 wealth all his inner world I'm happy it's something of 

00:02:38.249 --> 00:02:41.519
 very important for an artist he was speaking at 16 so it's not 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:44.519
 given to everyone 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:53.829
 but 

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:03.939
 thank you 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:09.189
 she 

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:11.180
 the elders who were hoping for something 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.200
 second maybe my first thoughts which is the dream realm 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.280
 fillon and when we announced the 1st prize in our category that said I 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.280
 did not hear my name pinochet little regret that m 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:26.019
 or not take like me they said he did not give to second 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:28.769
 awards this year like so many other countries but I also said that the 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:32.010
 proximity I do not even have the second quarter this job that we 

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:34.789
 releases filmmakers hemisphere time but far enough from the shortcomings 

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:39.079
 Signage Fecteau I burst into tears and I went backstage 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.649
 a sport a snap of police at the end of this year's contest 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:48.539

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:58.009
 at the awards ceremony 

00:03:58.009 --> 00:04:01.629
 everyone has thrown at me to congratulate me but shake hands with you 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:04.819
 missing a single shot 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:06.480
 you are training 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.909
 it was a very early sell moment 

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:11.909
 the ceasefire 

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:17.109
 the light is made 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:22.460
 but you have to be realistic I'm used to working with 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.569
 teachers much older than me he was reporting that I can not really 

00:04:25.569 --> 00:04:28.819
 talk about what worries me so much speed while with him I was able 

00:04:28.819 --> 00:04:32.330

 11:03 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.500
 so that's what the outgoing leader throwing an organist where often we do 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.640
 with what is paradoxical is that she would never have danced like that if 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:46.620
 had not been a student at this classical dance school etc

 it will not be easy to master all these 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:54.430
 classic techniques to be able to get away some time break them 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:55.340
 some channels 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.560
 as for the odds on a match not top 10 get hair done 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.710
