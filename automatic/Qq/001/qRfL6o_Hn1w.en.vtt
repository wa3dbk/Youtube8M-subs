depends on the shake card what your

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.340 
depends on the shake card what your
design<00:02:56.250> I<00:02:56.280> would<00:02:56.640> offer<00:02:56.820> to<00:02:56.970> you<00:02:57.300> so<00:02:57.870> that<00:02:58.140> can

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
design I would offer to you so that can

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.380 
design I would offer to you so that can
widely<00:02:58.890> change<00:02:59.190> in<00:02:59.370> terms<00:02:59.580> of<00:02:59.760> color<00:03:00.030> and

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
widely change in terms of color and

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.620 
widely change in terms of color and
texture<00:03:00.780> so<00:03:01.620> every<00:03:02.310> individual<00:03:02.850> manufacturer

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
texture so every individual manufacturer

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.630 
texture so every individual manufacturer
would<00:03:04.170> offer<00:03:04.350> you<00:03:04.620> a<00:03:04.650> shake<00:03:04.980> card<00:03:05.280> which<00:03:05.489> is

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
would offer you a shake card which is

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.240 
would offer you a shake card which is
again<00:03:05.910> having<00:03:06.150> a<00:03:06.420> wide<00:03:06.660> palette<00:03:07.260> of<00:03:07.560> colors<00:03:07.980> so

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
again having a wide palette of colors so

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.690 
again having a wide palette of colors so
you<00:03:09.000> can<00:03:09.030> choose<00:03:09.690> your<00:03:10.440> color<00:03:10.800> color<00:03:11.370> of<00:03:11.580> the

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
you can choose your color color of the

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.180 
you can choose your color color of the
shutters<00:03:12.060> based<00:03:12.330> on<00:03:12.570> the<00:03:12.750> overall<00:03:13.410> interior

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
shutters based on the overall interior

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.580 
shutters based on the overall interior
design<00:03:14.660> what<00:03:15.660> is<00:03:15.690> suggested<00:03:15.959> by<00:03:16.230> your

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
design what is suggested by your

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.000 
design what is suggested by your
designer<00:03:16.980> so<00:03:17.850> this<00:03:18.270> constitutes<00:03:18.750> the<00:03:19.230> PVC

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
designer so this constitutes the PVC

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.570 
designer so this constitutes the PVC
foil<00:03:20.280> actuator<00:03:20.550> range<00:03:21.090> the<00:03:21.840> other<00:03:22.580> commonly

foil actuator range the other commonly

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.020 
foil actuator range the other commonly
used<00:03:23.790> shutter<00:03:24.060> is<00:03:24.360> postpone<00:03:25.110> shutter<00:03:25.410> so<00:03:26.030> you

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
used shutter is postpone shutter so you

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.760 
used shutter is postpone shutter so you
don't<00:03:27.239> have<00:03:27.450> very<00:03:27.870> wide<00:03:28.110> range<00:03:28.410> in<00:03:28.590> this

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:28.770 
don't have very wide range in this

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:31.490 
don't have very wide range in this
similar<00:03:29.550> to<00:03:29.670> CDC<00:03:30.120> but<00:03:30.360> you<00:03:30.720> definitely<00:03:31.020> have

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
similar to CDC but you definitely have

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.670 
similar to CDC but you definitely have
some<00:03:31.830> ranges<00:03:32.220> in<00:03:32.400> this<00:03:32.550> so<00:03:33.090> you<00:03:33.180> can<00:03:33.680> this

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
some ranges in this so you can this

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.790
