okay<00:00:00.870> so<00:00:01.500> we<00:00:02.010> have<00:00:02.899> all<00:00:03.899> these<00:00:04.140> strings

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:05.180 
okay so we have all these strings

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.629 
okay so we have all these strings
disconnected<00:00:06.180> from<00:00:06.420> the<00:00:06.680> the<00:00:07.680> tuning<00:00:08.130> posts

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
disconnected from the the tuning posts

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.509 
disconnected from the the tuning posts
on<00:00:08.760> the<00:00:08.880> headstock<00:00:09.360> and<00:00:09.889> our<00:00:10.889> goal<00:00:11.130> now<00:00:11.309> is<00:00:11.340> to

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
on the headstock and our goal now is to

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.850 
on the headstock and our goal now is to
get<00:00:11.759> them<00:00:11.880> out<00:00:12.000> of<00:00:12.059> the<00:00:12.240> bridge<00:00:12.540> and<00:00:13.019> this

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
get them out of the bridge and this

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.310 
get them out of the bridge and this
style<00:00:14.099> of<00:00:14.250> guitar<00:00:14.400> as<00:00:14.880> with<00:00:15.150> many<00:00:15.630> other<00:00:15.960> types

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
style of guitar as with many other types

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.700 
style of guitar as with many other types
of<00:00:16.500> electric<00:00:16.949> guitars<00:00:17.340> the<00:00:18.180> strings<00:00:18.900> actually

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
of electric guitars the strings actually

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.260 
of electric guitars the strings actually
go<00:00:19.920> through<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.310> body<00:00:20.550> we<00:00:20.820> call<00:00:21.029> that<00:00:21.210> a

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
go through the body we call that a

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.470 
go through the body we call that a
string<00:00:21.720> through<00:00:22.020> body<00:00:22.289> design<00:00:22.920> and<00:00:23.220> if<00:00:24.000> I<00:00:24.180> push

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
string through body design and if I push

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.109 
string through body design and if I push
on<00:00:25.640> some<00:00:26.640> of<00:00:26.760> these<00:00:26.849> strings<00:00:27.660> from<00:00:28.019> from<00:00:29.119> the

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
on some of these strings from from the

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.139 
on some of these strings from from the
front<00:00:30.449> of<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:30.570> guitar<00:00:31.250> you<00:00:32.250> can<00:00:32.309> actually<00:00:32.880> see

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
front of the guitar you can actually see

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.840 
front of the guitar you can actually see
the<00:00:34.969> the<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.570> beaded<00:00:37.230> ends<00:00:37.860> of<00:00:38.040> these<00:00:38.250> strings

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
the the the beaded ends of these strings

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.130 
the the the beaded ends of these strings
coming<00:00:39.390> out<00:00:40.430> of<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:42.149> back<00:00:42.300> of<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.540> guitar<00:00:42.690> and

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
coming out of the back of the guitar and

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.270 
coming out of the back of the guitar and
so<00:00:44.989> you<00:00:45.989> can<00:00:46.170> just<00:00:46.320> pull<00:00:46.620> it<00:00:46.829> pull<00:00:47.070> it<00:00:48.059> through

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
so you can just pull it pull it through

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.830 
so you can just pull it pull it through
but<00:00:50.280> what's<00:00:50.460> going<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.670> happen<00:00:51.090> is<00:00:51.239> it's<00:00:51.629> gonna

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
but what's going to happen is it's gonna

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.860 
but what's going to happen is it's gonna
get<00:00:52.050> really<00:00:52.500> hard<00:00:52.710> to<00:00:52.890> pull<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:53.250> through<00:00:53.870> once

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
get really hard to pull it through once

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.869 
get really hard to pull it through once
you<00:00:54.989> get<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.320> that<00:00:55.350> part<00:00:56.390> where<00:00:58.609> where<00:00:59.609> it<00:00:59.730> was

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
you get to that part where where it was

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.270 
you get to that part where where it was
twisted<00:01:00.180> around<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.809> tuning<00:01:01.199> peg<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:02.219> you

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
twisted around the tuning peg and you

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.399 
twisted around the tuning peg and you
can<00:01:02.640> force<00:01:02.969> it<00:01:03.180> out<00:01:03.359> if<00:01:03.570> you<00:01:03.719> want<00:01:03.750> but<00:01:04.140> that's

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
can force it out if you want but that's

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.899 
can force it out if you want but that's
gonna<00:01:04.589> create<00:01:04.949> a<00:01:05.010> lot<00:01:05.280> of<00:01:05.339> friction<00:01:05.729> on<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:07.909> on

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
gonna create a lot of friction on the on

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.020 
gonna create a lot of friction on the on
the<00:01:09.180> bridge<00:01:09.799> on<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:11.159> inside<00:01:11.520> parts<00:01:11.850> of<00:01:11.939> the

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
the bridge on the inside parts of the

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.359 
the bridge on the inside parts of the
bridge<00:01:12.270> so<00:01:13.080> what<00:01:13.290> some<00:01:13.470> people<00:01:13.619> like<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:13.920> do<00:01:14.189> is

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
bridge so what some people like to do is

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.420 
bridge so what some people like to do is
just<00:01:14.610> take<00:01:15.470> the<00:01:16.470> whole<00:01:16.680> big<00:01:16.920> bundle<00:01:17.340> of

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
just take the whole big bundle of

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.810 
just take the whole big bundle of
strings<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:18.119> with<00:01:18.390> your<00:01:18.540> needlenose<00:01:18.900> pliers

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
strings and with your needlenose pliers

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.460 
strings and with your needlenose pliers
gripping<00:01:20.820> both<00:01:21.060> sides<00:01:21.509> so<00:01:21.930> that<00:01:21.960> it<00:01:22.140> doesn't

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
gripping both sides so that it doesn't

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.960 
gripping both sides so that it doesn't
fly<00:01:22.619> up<00:01:22.830> and<00:01:22.950> hit<00:01:23.220> you<00:01:23.810> cut<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.990> strings<00:01:25.970> okay

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
fly up and hit you cut the strings okay

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.359 
fly up and hit you cut the strings okay
and<00:01:27.600> now<00:01:28.700> you<00:01:29.700> can<00:01:29.880> set<00:01:30.150> these<00:01:30.750> aside<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:31.530> when

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
and now you can set these aside and when

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.340 
and now you can set these aside and when
you<00:01:32.490> push<00:01:33.110> these<00:01:34.110> strings<00:01:34.619> through<00:01:36.350> the

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
you push these strings through the

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.030 
you push these strings through the
bridge<00:01:37.680> from<00:01:38.159> this<00:01:38.450> back<00:01:39.450> side<00:01:40.009> they<00:01:41.009> should

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
bridge from this back side they should

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.240 
bridge from this back side they should
come<00:01:41.520> through<00:01:41.850> a<00:01:41.880> lot<00:01:42.200> more<00:01:43.200> easily<00:01:43.649> with<00:01:43.979> a

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
come through a lot more easily with a

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.609 
come through a lot more easily with a
lot<00:01:44.759> less<00:01:44.970> damage<00:01:45.329> done<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:46.079> inside<00:01:46.470> of

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
lot less damage done to the inside of

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.440 
lot less damage done to the inside of
the<00:01:46.710> bridge<00:01:47.479> so<00:01:49.640> if<00:01:50.640> you<00:01:50.820> see<00:01:51.030> here<00:01:51.210> on<00:01:51.329> the

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
the bridge so if you see here on the

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.880 
the bridge so if you see here on the
back<00:01:52.250> I've<00:01:53.250> began<00:01:53.700> to

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.530 

pushing<00:01:57.890> here<00:01:58.190> and<00:01:58.460> they<00:01:58.880> just<00:01:59.060> come<00:01:59.330> right

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
pushing here and they just come right

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.960 
pushing here and they just come right
out<00:01:59.600> because<00:02:00.140> those<00:02:01.030> looped<00:02:02.030> pieces<00:02:03.970> of

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
out because those looped pieces of

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.499 
out because those looped pieces of
string<00:02:05.300> that<00:02:05.480> work<00:02:05.690> around<00:02:06.680> the<00:02:06.800> tuning<00:02:07.190> peg

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 
string that work around the tuning peg

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:11.650 
string that work around the tuning peg
are<00:02:08.509> no<00:02:08.780> longer<00:02:09.970> obstructing<00:02:10.970> the<00:02:11.120> other<00:02:11.270> side

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
are no longer obstructing the other side

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:17.260 
are no longer obstructing the other side
of<00:02:11.810> the<00:02:11.870> bridge<00:02:14.290> so<00:02:15.610> again<00:02:16.610> we'll<00:02:16.820> just<00:02:16.850> keep

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
of the bridge so again we'll just keep

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:22.690 
of the bridge so again we'll just keep
working<00:02:17.330> one<00:02:18.020> by<00:02:18.260> one<00:02:18.940> pushing<00:02:19.940> these<00:02:21.700> balls

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
working one by one pushing these balls

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.680 
working one by one pushing these balls
through<00:02:23.560> just<00:02:24.560> like<00:02:24.740> that<00:02:24.980> one<00:02:25.540> and<00:02:26.540> then

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
through just like that one and then

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.600 
through just like that one and then
grabbing<00:02:26.990> them<00:02:27.290> and<00:02:27.470> pulling<00:02:28.220> them<00:02:28.340> all<00:02:28.459> the

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
grabbing them and pulling them all the

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.940 
grabbing them and pulling them all the
way<00:02:28.730> out
