00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
gun up in the entire black ops 2 until

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.899 
gun up in the entire black ops 2 until
now<00:01:33.570> and<00:01:33.750> so<00:01:33.840> I<00:01:33.869> had<00:01:34.110> to<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.500> I<00:01:34.530> will<00:01:35.460> say<00:01:35.670> it

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
now and so I had to and I will say it

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.910 
now and so I had to and I will say it
was<00:01:36.030> actually<00:01:36.420> probably<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.900> easiest<00:01:37.409> gun<00:01:37.740> to

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
was actually probably the easiest gun to

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.859 
was actually probably the easiest gun to
get<00:01:38.070> because<00:01:38.430> it<00:01:38.549> was<00:01:38.670> so<00:01:39.030> accurate<00:01:39.329> this<00:01:39.659> kind

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
get because it was so accurate this kind

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.390 
get because it was so accurate this kind
of<00:01:39.930> is<00:01:40.020> like<00:01:40.110> it<00:01:40.439> surprised<00:01:40.799> me<00:01:40.920> how<00:01:40.979> easy<00:01:41.100> it

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
of is like it surprised me how easy it

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.100 
of is like it surprised me how easy it
was<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:41.850> I<00:01:42.150> was<00:01:42.240> just<00:01:42.299> like<00:01:42.479> breezing<00:01:43.079> through

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
was and I was just like breezing through

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.170 
was and I was just like breezing through
just<00:01:43.590> getting<00:01:43.829> headshots<00:01:44.040> so<00:01:44.520> quickly<00:01:44.970> and

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
just getting headshots so quickly and

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.149 
just getting headshots so quickly and
it's<00:01:45.869> simply<00:01:46.079> because<00:01:46.229> it's<00:01:46.380> really<00:01:46.829> really

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
it's simply because it's really really

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.980 
it's simply because it's really really
accurate<00:01:47.310> it's<00:01:47.670> actually<00:01:48.000> not<00:01:48.240> hard<00:01:48.630> at<00:01:48.960> all

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
accurate it's actually not hard at all

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.249 
accurate it's actually not hard at all
to<00:01:49.170> get<00:01:49.409> headshots<00:01:49.619> I<00:01:49.950> found<00:01:50.250> and<00:01:50.460> I<00:01:51.360> think

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
to get headshots I found and I think

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.690 
to get headshots I found and I think
that's<00:01:52.380> pretty<00:01:52.470> much<00:01:52.560> it<00:01:52.680> because<00:01:52.979> it's<00:01:53.310> a

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
that's pretty much it because it's a

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.090 
that's pretty much it because it's a
three<00:01:53.939> round<00:01:54.149> burst<00:01:54.540> put<00:01:54.899> their<00:01:55.079> guns<00:01:55.380> so<00:01:55.770> the

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
three round burst put their guns so the

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.380 
three round burst put their guns so the
second<00:01:56.430> one<00:01:56.520> but<00:01:56.700> hits<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.000> head<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.240> other

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
second one but hits the head the other

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.090 
second one but hits the head the other
two<00:01:57.570> will<00:01:57.689> follow<00:01:57.899> and<00:01:58.170> it<00:01:58.829> will<00:01:58.920> keep<00:01:59.040> going

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
two will follow and it will keep going

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.789 
two will follow and it will keep going
and<00:01:59.579> it's<00:01:59.729> got<00:01:59.880> some<00:02:00.060> crazy<00:02:00.420> crazy<00:02:00.799> accuracy

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
and it's got some crazy crazy accuracy

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.130 
and it's got some crazy crazy accuracy
that<00:02:02.280> just<00:02:02.460> lets<00:02:02.670> you<00:02:03.000> just<00:02:03.210> focus<00:02:03.689> on<00:02:03.840> it<00:02:03.990> and

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
that just lets you just focus on it and

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.200 
that just lets you just focus on it and
another<00:02:04.860> thing<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.280> second<00:02:05.670> important<00:02:06.180> thing

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
another thing the second important thing

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.479 
another thing the second important thing
that<00:02:06.360> I<00:02:06.509> would<00:02:06.570> add<00:02:06.840> is<00:02:07.079> that<00:02:07.409> M<00:02:07.799> I<00:02:08.129> made<00:02:08.459> a

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
that I would add is that M I made a

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.910 
that I would add is that M I made a
video<00:02:08.670> like<00:02:09.060> a<00:02:09.300> week<00:02:09.629> or<00:02:09.780> two<00:02:09.840> ago<00:02:10.200> about<00:02:10.410> how

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
video like a week or two ago about how

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.500 
video like a week or two ago about how
to<00:02:10.979> get<00:02:11.160> headshots<00:02:11.430> free<00:02:11.790> fast<00:02:12.000> and<00:02:12.239> how<00:02:12.300> to<00:02:12.360> do

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
to get headshots free fast and how to do

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.880 
to get headshots free fast and how to do
those<00:02:12.629> challenges<00:02:13.200> and<00:02:13.410> I've<00:02:13.500> made

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
those challenges and I've made

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.800 
those challenges and I've made
tips<00:02:14.340> on<00:02:14.550> how<00:02:14.760> to<00:02:14.790> get<00:02:15.420> those<00:02:15.600> headshots

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
tips on how to get those headshots

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.559 
tips on how to get those headshots
quickly<00:02:16.380> and<00:02:16.530> get<00:02:16.650> your<00:02:16.770> gold<00:02:17.040> camos<00:02:17.400> and<00:02:17.610> one

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
quickly and get your gold camos and one

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:19.699 
quickly and get your gold camos and one
thing<00:02:18.750> I<00:02:18.840> left<00:02:18.990> off<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:19.319> list<00:02:19.440> which<00:02:19.590> I've

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
thing I left off the list which I've

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.860 
thing I left off the list which I've
realized<00:02:20.100> now<00:02:20.310> is<00:02:20.490> toughness<00:02:21.180> toughness<00:02:21.450> the

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
realized now is toughness toughness the

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.050 
realized now is toughness toughness the
perk<00:02:22.080> is<00:02:22.319> so<00:02:22.980> good<00:02:23.400> for<00:02:23.430> getting<00:02:23.880> headshots

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
perk is so good for getting headshots

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.120 
perk is so good for getting headshots
and<00:02:24.330> I've<00:02:24.450> realized<00:02:24.840> how<00:02:24.959> important<00:02:25.680> is<00:02:25.770> now<00:02:25.920> I

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
and I've realized how important is now I

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.500 
and I've realized how important is now I
never<00:02:26.550> really<00:02:26.760> used<00:02:26.940> to<00:02:27.030> one<00:02:27.150> toughness

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
never really used to one toughness

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.270 
never really used to one toughness
because<00:02:27.600> I<00:02:27.720> normally<00:02:28.319> run<00:02:28.440> with<00:02:28.590> fast<00:02:28.800> hands<00:02:29.160> I

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
because I normally run with fast hands I

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.740 
because I normally run with fast hands I
could<00:02:29.490> throw<00:02:29.640> my<00:02:29.700> equipment<00:02:30.180> and<00:02:30.330> switch<00:02:30.570> out

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
could throw my equipment and switch out

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.050 
could throw my equipment and switch out
fast<00:02:31.020> and<00:02:31.290> stuff<00:02:31.440> like<00:02:31.590> that<00:02:31.770> but<00:02:32.340> toughness

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
fast and stuff like that but toughness

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.790 
fast and stuff like that but toughness
seems<00:02:33.330> to<00:02:33.540> be<00:02:33.660> really<00:02:33.959> very<00:02:34.110> helpful

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
seems to be really very helpful

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.320 
seems to be really very helpful
simply<00:02:35.220> because<00:02:35.520> when<00:02:35.790> you're<00:02:35.940> shooting<00:02:36.120> at

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
simply because when you're shooting at

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:37.490 
simply because when you're shooting at
someone<00:02:36.510> typically<00:02:37.020> they're<00:02:37.260> gonna<00:02:37.380> be

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
someone typically they're gonna be

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.660 
someone typically they're gonna be
seeing<00:02:37.740> you<00:02:37.950> and<00:02:38.100> they're<00:02:38.280> gonna<00:02:38.370> shoot<00:02:38.610> back

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
seeing you and they're gonna shoot back

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.220 
seeing you and they're gonna shoot back
and<00:02:39.120> then<00:02:39.570> when<00:02:39.690> they<00:02:39.810> shoot<00:02:39.870> you<00:02:40.110> they're

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
and then when they shoot you they're

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.600 
and then when they shoot you they're
gonna<00:02:40.320> jog<00:02:40.650> your<00:02:40.830> accuracy<00:02:41.130> and<00:02:41.310> you're<00:02:41.489> gonna

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
gonna jog your accuracy and you're gonna

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.070 
gonna jog your accuracy and you're gonna
be<00:02:41.820> jolting<00:02:42.390> up<00:02:42.510> and<00:02:42.660> you'll<00:02:42.750> be<00:02:42.900> able<00:02:42.959> to

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
be jolting up and you'll be able to

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.420 
be jolting up and you'll be able to
actually<00:02:43.170> aim<00:02:43.440> on<00:02:43.590> the<00:02:43.650> head<00:02:43.800> when<00:02:44.220> you<00:02:44.310> have

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
actually aim on the head when you have

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.460 
actually aim on the head when you have
tucked<00:02:44.610> toughness<00:02:45.150> and<00:02:45.390> this<00:02:45.810> gameplay<00:02:46.260> all

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.380 
tucked toughness and this gameplay all
has<00:02:46.650> toughness<00:02:47.130> apart<00:02:47.520> from<00:02:47.700> the<00:02:48.209> gameplay

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
has toughness apart from the gameplay

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:49.880

shooting<00:02:55.590> me<00:02:55.830> people<00:02:56.100> shoot<00:02:56.280> me<00:02:56.430> directly<00:02:56.970> but

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
shooting me people shoot me directly but

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.720 
shooting me people shoot me directly but
I<00:02:57.540> can<00:02:57.870> still<00:02:58.200> manage<00:02:58.440> to<00:02:58.620> focus<00:02:59.190> on<00:02:59.370> and<00:02:59.550> shoot

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
I can still manage to focus on and shoot

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:00.530 
I can still manage to focus on and shoot
them<00:02:59.850> in<00:02:59.940> the<00:03:00.000> head<00:03:00.090> because<00:03:00.209> I<00:03:00.390> have

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
them in the head because I have

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:01.970 
them in the head because I have
toughness<00:03:00.959> and<00:03:01.140> toughness<00:03:01.500> helps<00:03:01.800> your

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
toughness and toughness helps your

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.670 
toughness and toughness helps your
accuracy<00:03:02.400> so<00:03:03.090> much<00:03:03.330> and<00:03:03.630> definitely<00:03:04.290> I<00:03:04.440> will

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
accuracy so much and definitely I will

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.490 
accuracy so much and definitely I will
add<00:03:04.920> that<00:03:05.130> to<00:03:05.190> the<00:03:05.519> list<00:03:05.730> of<00:03:06.000> things<00:03:06.420> to<00:03:06.840> use

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
add that to the list of things to use

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:08.870 
add that to the list of things to use
winter<00:03:07.920> on<00:03:08.040> your<00:03:08.100> headshots<00:03:08.459> and<00:03:08.519> if<00:03:08.670> you<00:03:08.730> want

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
winter on your headshots and if you want

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.370 
winter on your headshots and if you want
to<00:03:08.940> go<00:03:09.030> as<00:03:09.150> a<00:03:09.180> head<00:03:09.330> shots<00:03:09.570> I<00:03:09.720> definitely

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
to go as a head shots I definitely

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.770 
to go as a head shots I definitely
definitely<00:03:10.560> recommend<00:03:10.800> toughness<00:03:11.610> and<00:03:11.820> but

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
definitely recommend toughness and but

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.420 
definitely recommend toughness and but
yeah<00:03:12.900> so<00:03:13.110> I've<00:03:13.230> done<00:03:13.410> all<00:03:13.470> the<00:03:13.620> SMGs<00:03:14.070> and<00:03:14.280> I've

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
yeah so I've done all the SMGs and I've

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.850 
yeah so I've done all the SMGs and I've
also<00:03:14.580> done<00:03:14.910> what<00:03:15.810> I<00:03:15.840> think<00:03:15.989> about<00:03:16.140> the<00:03:16.290> assault

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
also done what I think about the assault

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.210 
also done what I think about the assault
rifles<00:03:17.280> and<00:03:17.580> the<00:03:17.850> s/s<00:03:18.690> smg's<00:03:19.500> assault<00:03:19.829> rifles

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
rifles and the s/s smg's assault rifles

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.890 
rifles and the s/s smg's assault rifles
the<00:03:20.549> snipers<00:03:21.120> and<00:03:21.420> the<00:03:22.230> launchers<00:03:22.890> and<00:03:23.900> say

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
the snipers and the launchers and say

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.120 
the snipers and the launchers and say
yeah<00:03:25.019> I<00:03:25.049> guess<00:03:25.320> that's<00:03:25.560> pretty<00:03:25.709> cool<00:03:25.980> because

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
yeah I guess that's pretty cool because

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.400 
yeah I guess that's pretty cool because
the<00:03:26.549> thing<00:03:26.700> up<00:03:26.850> in<00:03:27.150> black<00:03:27.510> ops<00:03:27.690> 2<00:03:27.840> once<00:03:28.079> you<00:03:28.230> get

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
the thing up in black ops 2 once you get

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.319 
the thing up in black ops 2 once you get
one<00:03:28.829> thing<00:03:29.040> Dimond<00:03:29.519> or<00:03:29.610> gold<00:03:29.850> that<00:03:29.940> is<00:03:30.150> it's

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
one thing Dimond or gold that is it's

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:31.970 
one thing Dimond or gold that is it's
not<00:03:30.390> that<00:03:30.510> for<00:03:30.750> the<00:03:30.810> entire<00:03:30.930> game<00:03:31.320> if<00:03:31.560> you

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
not that for the entire game if you

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.800 
not that for the entire game if you
reset<00:03:32.340> your<00:03:32.400> stats<00:03:32.730> if<00:03:32.880> you<00:03:33.000> prestige<00:03:33.390> if<00:03:33.660> you

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
reset your stats if you prestige if you

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.720 
reset your stats if you prestige if you
proceed<00:03:33.959> your<00:03:34.260> gun<00:03:34.530> it<00:03:35.010> does<00:03:35.250> not<00:03:35.400> get<00:03:35.610> rid<00:03:35.700> of

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
proceed your gun it does not get rid of

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:36.830 
proceed your gun it does not get rid of
the<00:03:35.820> camera<00:03:36.030> and<00:03:36.120> there's<00:03:36.269> no<00:03:36.360> way<00:03:36.480> to<00:03:36.510> get<00:03:36.720> rid

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
the camera and there's no way to get rid

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.660 
the camera and there's no way to get rid
of<00:03:36.930> it<00:03:37.019> so<00:03:37.230> it's<00:03:37.440> pretty<00:03:37.590> cool<00:03:37.709> it's<00:03:38.400> not<00:03:38.519> like

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
of it so it's pretty cool it's not like

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.220 
of it so it's pretty cool it's not like
in<00:03:38.820> the<00:03:38.880> old<00:03:39.060> games<00:03:39.299> where<00:03:39.540> you<00:03:39.660> like<00:03:39.810> work<00:03:40.049> so

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
in the old games where you like work so

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:41.840 
in the old games where you like work so
hard<00:03:40.380> to<00:03:40.560> unlock<00:03:40.739> a<00:03:40.799> certain<00:03:41.190> thing<00:03:41.430> or<00:03:41.610> get

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
hard to unlock a certain thing or get

hard to unlock a certain thing or get
certain<00:03:42.120> camo<00:03:42.329> and<00:03:42.810> if<00:03:42.930> you<00:03:43.049> perceived<00:03:43.410> you'd

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
certain camo and if you perceived you'd

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.020 
certain camo and if you perceived you'd
lose<00:03:43.799> it<00:03:43.980> all<00:03:44.100> because<00:03:44.280> in<00:03:44.549> this<00:03:44.670> game<00:03:44.880> you

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030
