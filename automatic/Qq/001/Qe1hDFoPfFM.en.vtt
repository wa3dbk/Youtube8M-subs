these with good form because when you

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.410 
these with good form because when you
exhale<00:01:46.149> under<00:01:46.810> load<00:01:47.050> that<00:01:47.770> can<00:01:48.360> that<00:01:49.360> can

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
exhale under load that can that can

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.740 
exhale under load that can that can
destabilize<00:01:50.229> your<00:01:50.890> spine<00:01:51.250> so<00:01:51.940> you<00:01:52.450> need<00:01:52.630> to

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
destabilize your spine so you need to

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.800 
destabilize your spine so you need to
already<00:01:52.930> have<00:01:53.500> your<00:01:53.920> form<00:01:54.220> nailed<00:01:54.490> down<00:01:54.810> so

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
already have your form nailed down so

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.810 
already have your form nailed down so
your<00:01:55.990> intrinsic<00:01:56.440> stabilizers<00:01:57.190> can<00:01:57.460> help<00:01:57.640> keep

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
your intrinsic stabilizers can help keep

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.580 
your intrinsic stabilizers can help keep
your<00:01:57.970> spine<00:01:58.240> in<00:01:58.420> a<00:01:58.509> good<00:01:58.660> position<00:01:58.810> without

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
your spine in a good position without

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.190 
your spine in a good position without
the<00:01:59.740> aid<00:02:00.039> of<00:02:00.070> intra-abdominal<00:02:00.670> pressure<00:02:01.300> so

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
the aid of intra-abdominal pressure so

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.280 
the aid of intra-abdominal pressure so
breathing<00:02:02.649> pulse<00:02:02.860> squats<00:02:03.280> are<00:02:04.140> important<00:02:05.140> and

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.290 
breathing pulse squats are important and

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.890 
breathing pulse squats are important and
useful<00:02:05.520> because<00:02:06.520> basically<00:02:07.150> there's<00:02:07.630> three

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:07.900 
useful because basically there's three

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.300 
useful because basically there's three
things<00:02:08.080> you're<00:02:08.320> trying<00:02:08.470> to<00:02:08.649> accomplish<00:02:08.979> with

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
things you're trying to accomplish with

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.190 
things you're trying to accomplish with
a<00:02:09.369> squat<00:02:09.700> you<00:02:10.239> have<00:02:10.330> to<00:02:10.479> extend<00:02:10.840> your<00:02:10.959> knees

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
a squat you have to extend your knees

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.190 
a squat you have to extend your knees
extend<00:02:12.130> your<00:02:12.250> hips<00:02:12.459> and<00:02:12.760> also<00:02:13.420> transfer<00:02:14.049> that

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
extend your hips and also transfer that

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.710 
extend your hips and also transfer that
force<00:02:14.530> from<00:02:14.950> your<00:02:15.549> legs<00:02:15.790> and<00:02:15.970> hips<00:02:16.120> into<00:02:16.510> the

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
force from your legs and hips into the

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.300 
force from your legs and hips into the
bar<00:02:16.930> and<00:02:17.140> that's<00:02:17.530> where<00:02:17.769> breathing<00:02:18.070> Hall

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
bar and that's where breathing Hall

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.370 
bar and that's where breathing Hall
squats<00:02:18.670> come<00:02:18.940> in<00:02:19.090> because<00:02:19.600> a<00:02:19.810> lot<00:02:20.019> of<00:02:20.110> people

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
squats come in because a lot of people

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.289 
squats come in because a lot of people
they<00:02:20.829> can<00:02:21.010> leg<00:02:21.190> press<00:02:21.459> a<00:02:21.489> ton<00:02:21.820> but<00:02:22.090> then<00:02:22.209> they

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:22.299 
they can leg press a ton but then they

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:24.300 
they can leg press a ton but then they
can't<00:02:22.540> squat<00:02:22.840> any<00:02:23.019> and<00:02:23.290> the<00:02:24.010> biggest

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
can't squat any and the biggest

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.220 
can't squat any and the biggest
difference<00:02:24.670> between<00:02:24.730> those<00:02:25.239> two<00:02:25.900> movements

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
difference between those two movements

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.330 
difference between those two movements
are<00:02:27.000> the<00:02:28.000> necessary<00:02:28.209> of<00:02:28.750> the<00:02:29.200> necessity<00:02:30.190> of

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
are the necessary of the necessity of

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.910 
are the necessary of the necessity of
torso<00:02:31.269> rigidity<00:02:31.870> for<00:02:32.170> getting<00:02:32.380> that<00:02:32.560> force

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
torso rigidity for getting that force

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.340 
torso rigidity for getting that force
into<00:02:33.459> the<00:02:33.579> bar<00:02:33.760> so<00:02:34.420> that's<00:02:34.870> where<00:02:35.019> breathing

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
into the bar so that's where breathing

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.650 
into the bar so that's where breathing
loss<00:02:35.530> squats<00:02:35.890> come<00:02:36.160> in<00:02:36.310> because<00:02:36.820> as<00:02:37.060> you

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
loss squats come in because as you

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.960 
loss squats come in because as you
inhale<00:02:38.019> and<00:02:38.290> exhale<00:02:38.980> under<00:02:39.310> load<00:02:39.519> that's

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
inhale and exhale under load that's

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.340 
inhale and exhale under load that's

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
going to shrink in your transverse

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.699 
going to shrink in your transverse
abdominis<00:02:42.010> and<00:02:42.160> your<00:02:42.640> internal<00:02:43.060> oblique<00:02:43.709> your

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
abdominis and your internal oblique your

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.699 
abdominis and your internal oblique your
internal<00:02:45.130> obliques<00:02:45.489> in<00:02:46.170> those<00:02:47.170> muscles<00:02:47.410> that

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
internal obliques in those muscles that

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:50.069 
internal obliques in those muscles that
have<00:02:47.860> to<00:02:48.100> contract<00:02:48.579> to<00:02:48.880> help<00:02:49.570> produce<00:02:49.780> an

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:50.079 
have to contract to help produce an

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:51.990 
have to contract to help produce an
intra-abdominal<00:02:50.380> pressure<00:02:50.980> it's<00:02:51.670> going<00:02:51.880> to

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
intra-abdominal pressure it's going to

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.030 
intra-abdominal pressure it's going to
really<00:02:52.180> strengthen<00:02:52.600> those<00:02:52.989> so<00:02:53.620> then<00:02:53.829> when

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
really strengthen those so then when

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.300 
really strengthen those so then when
you're<00:02:54.160> doing<00:02:54.459> squats<00:02:54.790> regularly

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
you're doing squats regularly

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.610 
you're doing squats regularly
those<00:02:57.310> muscles<00:02:57.820> will<00:02:58.660> be<00:02:58.810> stronger<00:02:59.350> so<00:02:59.380> you

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
those muscles will be stronger so you

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.200 
those muscles will be stronger so you
can<00:02:59.770> produce<00:02:59.920> more<00:03:00.340> interrupt<00:03:00.820> nominal

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:01.210 
can produce more interrupt nominal

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:02.820 
can produce more interrupt nominal
pressure<00:03:01.420> and<00:03:01.780> keep<00:03:01.930> your<00:03:02.080> torso<00:03:02.350> tighter

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
pressure and keep your torso tighter

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.030 
pressure and keep your torso tighter
another<00:03:03.730> benefit<00:03:04.240> is<00:03:04.420> that<00:03:05.080> you<00:03:05.410> can<00:03:05.590> get<00:03:05.770> a

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
another benefit is that you can get a

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.670 
another benefit is that you can get a
good<00:03:06.910> workout<00:03:07.300> and<00:03:07.480> with<00:03:08.050> not<00:03:08.260> very<00:03:08.290> much

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
good workout and with not very much

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.220 
good workout and with not very much
float<00:03:08.950> I'm<00:03:09.730> a<00:03:09.820> middle<00:03:10.300> seven<00:03:10.600> squatter<00:03:10.960> and

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
float I'm a middle seven squatter and

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.320 
float I'm a middle seven squatter and
this<00:03:11.950> is<00:03:12.100> only<00:03:12.250> 135<00:03:12.700> and<00:03:13.270> it's<00:03:13.390> wearing<00:03:13.690> me<00:03:13.840> out

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
this is only 135 and it's wearing me out

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.720 
this is only 135 and it's wearing me out
so<00:03:16.330> if<00:03:16.630> you<00:03:16.750> have<00:03:16.870> beat<00:03:17.110> up<00:03:17.340> knees<00:03:18.340> and<00:03:18.580> hips

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
so if you have beat up knees and hips

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.090 
so if you have beat up knees and hips
and<00:03:19.030> you<00:03:19.690> need<00:03:19.840> to<00:03:20.020> have<00:03:20.320> a<00:03:20.350> wider<00:03:20.740> squat

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
and you need to have a wider squat

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.440 
and you need to have a wider squat
