00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 hi comrades how are you today I come to you 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.779
 with a question to see if you know it 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.389
 in what balls are the box different from 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.130
 ammunition and the ammunition pack in the 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.410
 first days of the game the question 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.150
 the answer would have been easily answered 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.250
 ammunition box was an evolution of the 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.230
 ammo pack because the latter does not 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.270
 managed to replenish explosives but 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.670
 after an update that changed 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.660
 and now it can supply 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.779
 explosives so let's get down to business 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.369
 then in that with this difference 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:31.289
 good in the first thing that is differential 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.969
 is in the size the ammunition box is 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.579
 much bigger than the pack of 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.860
 ammunition but this gives us the same and does not go 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.510
 to have a lot of impact on the gameplay 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.640
 second difference is that we can 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.980
 deploy only one ammo box 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.690
 at the same time we can deploy two 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.670
 ammo packs at a time to see who 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.289
 know the third difference the third 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.719
 difference is that the ammunition pack 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.610
 It only has three uses or three 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.160
 reloads and by this I mean that 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.829
 you can only interact with the 3 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.600
 and in recharge it's a bullet or a recharge 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.880
 is 30 in exchange for the ammo box 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.979
 it has infinite uses besides that the 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.620
 ammo pack can only be recharged 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.050
 a soldier at the same time the fourth difference 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.760
 is the deployment distance the pack of 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.400
 ammo deploys a lot more 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.979
 far away that the ammunition box the fifth 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.619
 difference is that the first recharge of 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.540
 ammunition from the ammunition pack is between 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.030
 double and four times greater than 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.630
 ammunition box depending on the type of 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.220
 weapon 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.410
 and this happens with all the weapons 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.330
 primary of the game and all the guns 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:32.190
 the sixth difference is that the pack of 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.899
 ammunition recharges devices without 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.090
 wait faster than the box 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:38.280
 ammunition we tested a difference of 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.229
 tenths of a second so he does not know what 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:44.610
 which is a device without waiting is for 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:46.440
 example a map or a gps for example the 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.660
 mortar would be a device that 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.690
 You need a wait before you get 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.640
 another and the last difference is that if 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.860
 we put ammunition packs to our 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.960
 feet and we started using explosives 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.360
 the recharge of explosives will be a bit 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.039
 faster than with the ammo box 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.909
 these are the main differences 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:05.219
 between 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.619
 the devices now well what is the 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:09.119
 better between the two, what do you want? 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.910
 tell them but the thing is pretty 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.700
 clear in the ammunition box because 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.709
 well first of all here it does not matter 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.319
 that with the ammunition packs I can 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.360
 take off two at a time instead of one as 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.670
 happens with the ammunition box when a 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.099
 guiri is missing ammo will go to your 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.620
 box you do not need to have spread 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:30.959
 out there a lot of packs so that the 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.360
 also shine these packs have only 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:36.480
 three uses with the ammunition box can 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.760
 have 200 guiris fucking over 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.349
 that are going to recharge at the same time and go to 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.989
 give equal because this ammo box 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:45.299
 of avast in second place and putting a 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:47.280
 similar case that happens in the class 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:50.340
 assault with first aid 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:53.069
 doctor and the medicine cabinet there are pros and cons 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.750
 between them and according to the situation that 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:57.560
 give that they will compensate first aid 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:00.569
 or the first aid kit but in this case 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.730
 between the pack and the ammo box 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:06.060
 this happens the ammunition pack does not 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:08.690
 offer no clear advantage if I already know 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:12.470
 which says that it is thrown further but 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:14.420
 and equipment does not work I wonder if that 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.010
 besides the ammunition father is not 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.900
 absorbed by the soldier as by 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.610
 example happened with first aid 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.460
 Wait good who are just 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:25.070
 Something can happen to you that may help you 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:28.130
 hypothetical situation let's imagine all 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:30.890
 that we are after a coverage there is a 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:33.940
 ally about seven meters from us and 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.900
 we are separated from him by a crossfire 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.970
 amazing and it turns out something 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.940
 you need ammunition so look where you 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.470
 that there could serve to throw the pack 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.630
 of ammunition because how can you throw 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:47.390
 further away it would come to him and not us 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:49.040
 we would have to play the neck no but 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.290
 that is a situation that I never 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:54.200
 it has happened and what you are seeing here 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:56.480
 it's a recreation that I already know that 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.400
 I said before the first recharge of 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.290
 Pack of ammunition between two and four 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.330
 times bigger than in weapons 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.760
 primary and secondary but let's see 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:07.010
 what is the use of your pussy that will give the most 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.050
 wait a little longer on top of the box 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.030
 ammo to recharge you completely 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:13.280
 if it is that the difference I think they are from 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.319
 tenths of a second if total while 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.810
 you are using the first charger 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:20.780
 given the ammunition box is already 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:23.270
 recharging the others and if finally 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:25.280
 I know I know I said explosives and 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.289
 gadgets recharge a little more 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:30.470
 fast with the ammo pack but 

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:32.449
 let's see again I repeat what the fuck 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:34.639
 it serves if again I repeat from what pussy 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:37.220
 if you are going to have to invest 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:39.229
 time to throw two packs of ammunition 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:42.620
 to the ground because these three disappear 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:44.090
 after spending three uses the time that 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.039
 you win with the recharge speed of 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:48.380
 these packs you lose on the other hand 

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:50.419
 because you have to invest time in 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:52.310
 throw the packs to the ground the chickens 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:54.560
 that enter forms that come out in 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:56.570
 definitive I do not know who the balls will use 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.150
 this pack of ammunition if there is someone who 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:02.389
 please use them to explain comments 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:04.340
 what useful use can have I do not know why 

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:06.560
 cojones dais has bothered to throw 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:09.199
 this pack of ammunition could well have 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:11.539
 given much more game the fact of this 

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:14.120
 pack refill will only bullets and that the box 

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:17.470
 recharge for example only explosives 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:20.350
 then yes it would have given enough 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:22.720
 is the fact of carrying a box or another and 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:24.700
 I would have given the support soldier another 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.320
 role so good comrades 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:28.300
 nothing more on my part as always 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.040
