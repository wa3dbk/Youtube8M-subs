00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 chain3 the television more environment in 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.180
 loans back we go with the 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.319
 second part of the interview 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.319
 partnership with ronaldinho 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.840
 We make the selection quickly but 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.260
 I read not to be selected for the world 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.260
 from your country 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:27.750
 I take away the illusion of playing a World Cup in 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:30.090
 my country but the decision was like that 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.550
 and you have to accept it keeps the 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:36.070
 execution of returning to the selection today 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:39.490
 I only imagine playing here 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:42.460
 good things of what I want 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:44.350
 and leave this for the future as you see 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.370
 your selection to the Brazilian session as 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.410
 he saw it very well 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.469
 went through a complicated moment and it is 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:55.199
 world there are talented young people 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.390
 with a lot of quality then I think that 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:01.230
 future mind can make room for the team 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:04.580
 and now with the new technician in his 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:08.590
 second stage dunga there is a play 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:10.850
 you in the guild and international the 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.560
 disciplines that faced a 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.330
 hat after where you put the navel 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.460
 in the back 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.260
 Once they spoke it, there is some evil 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.210
 feeling frame whatever the 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.330
 court remains in the song the court 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:26.600
 that really not always afterwards 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.280
 worked with the selection and what ever 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.090
 we've talked 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:34.909
 I hope things for the other from 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.500
 a month ago there was a stadium full and no 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:38.810
 for seeing you Juan knew they were going to 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.700
 see play but they wanted to see you 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.680
 you felt at that moment playing was a 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.509
 reality see you've got me all what 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.330
 they knew but they filled it just to see 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:49.780
 trip that feeling gives you that kind 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.780
 of actions 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.740
 here is already going to receive me 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.490
 for 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:03.939
 I know it's not very exciting something that 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:06.030
 I will never forget because Mexico because 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:09.840
 roosters 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:13.290
 because my brother already had play in 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:16.110
 mexico always spoke to me very well I have 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.240
 many Mexican friends and then I have 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:23.010
 had the chance to talk to the 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:26.010
 president explained not everything he planned 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.530
 for future and this is what I have been 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.140
 done in the ambitious year 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:35.770
 much 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:39.110
 and it motivated me a lot to come and go direct and 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:42.110
 when you talk to the president says 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:44.450
 I think you have fun on the part of 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.880
 fundamental is to say what you do in the 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.780
 court is what we need that 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.720
 have fun so tell them 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:54.810
 if in everything we've talked 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:58.110
 also this was very important very 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:02.000
 President rarely speaks like this for a 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:06.000
 player and I think this is the way 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.860
 perfect to motivate the player then 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:13.040
 this motivated me there were some people 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:17.250
 close to you or someone who told you 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.780
 wait mexico there is insecurity do not go 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.600
 for there are other offers such 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.480
 there were better people and why not 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.930
 did you do 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.220
 because I really liked the way that 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:32.590
 president of everyone else in the group 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:35.560
 org have spoken very clear very direct 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:39.230
 very very clear goal of living what 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:41.810
 planned then this was what there is 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:44.599
 that to listen to only them decisions 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:47.510
 of soccer you take them with your feet 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:49.670
 heart or with the head first with the 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:52.430
 release of the head and then what 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:55.099
 dismiss finally it is already for 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:58.069
 say goodbye when you arrived in a 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:04:03.620
 interview they told you that you promise to 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:05.359
 we leave it to them but in that 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.790
 you commit to the fiction of the years 

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:11.530
 not so much to the directive to the fans of 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.530
 the lips for you to commit 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:16.810
 do not promise to enter the field of always 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:19.160
 and give the best should try to give the 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:21.590
 better of me is here 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.600
 I have to compromise, there's always 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.880
 that enter the field seek to do 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.260
 best 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:31.300
