00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:11.500
 I have you gotten quite the 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:12.179
 last video where I almost just not 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.070
 be white 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.840
 now one can imagine making it 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.520
 just won the test or sheet metal 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.579
 yes again a fender on or 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:23.710
 liberty built but honestly so short 

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:26.320
 on each other first in the ferrari and then 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.300
 just another thing where something happens 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.250
 is really super rare that something like that 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.989
 occurs or does not imagine us 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.970
 would be the page stop of the white m4 

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:40.390
 a blessing and now my cool 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:42.129
 Goggles would be on there only 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.559
 following problematic in this case it 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:48.039
 is a bit different this time because of it 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:49.929
 There is no guidance at the ferrari 

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:52.239
 she told you where you are about long 

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:58.800
 flexen must then we called in 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:01:01.600
 japan as a new generation of nix nada 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.150
 but now good luck, just good times 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.970
 see how it fits the problem that 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.649
 namely have at 94 samples spreitz 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.450
 Display also tasks once the outer 

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:12.610
 Cover the envelope and be in the town hall 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.040
 story about the ak scarf is back 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.079
 I mean, I really do not like sheet metal 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.570
 in this department a blessing because then 

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:21.490
 spreads the metal namely on it can 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.610
 such deformations cake sheet namely 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.579
 come because this stability in the 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.990
 page part also comes condition due 

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:32.140
 of the inner tin if I am now 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.759
 meet as you make quasi choose so 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.469
 I do not want that 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:37.890
 but that's the way it should be 

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:37.890
 fold 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:54.539
 Merkel's profile was a part of it as if 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:56.009
 that's nothing for news because 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:58.109
 now down to the bridge you know that 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.329
 caravan afterwards horny at the ferrari 

00:01:58.109 --> 00:02:03.899
 was in places what you really like that 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:05.429
 well as big as pea what I believe 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.259
 now shit built because you're standing 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:07.950
 This thing completely cut up everything 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.360
 in the bad 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.360
 afterwards it is a god 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.030
 fitting accuracy actually very clear 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:21.180
 I really say mine all the time 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.829
 Safety glasses on the special edition and 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:27.019
 Goggles also special 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:29.160
 protective against uv also double version 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:30.810
 but my eyes are protected so can 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.940
 Nobody says because then all these 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.900
 eyeglasses here sometimes gives these 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.530
 Goggles are really 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.870
 fanatical 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.819
 personally fits you up correctly 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.340
 If you can easily see it there 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:44.879
 sitting was so fit that almost no 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:47.910
 gap between between sheet and the 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:50.579
 gfk part of the poison next to the whole 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.349
 cheap gfk part is the japan even 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:54.090
 nothing costs so very reasonably priced 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:56.069
 already have left portal but the 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.750
 message that next why is not 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:59.910
 problem-even if it were soon 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.190
 you have the rubbery kids up here 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:07.130
 virtually all mistakes from service 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.130
 just somehow there is between gfk and 

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:17.040
 I'm gone or I'm starting out easily 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.849
 to distract that does not get it 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.290
 arise 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:21.209
 The reason why I do not return it 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.239
 I've you have to be so flexible 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:26.250
 reflex to people that this protection where 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:28.500
 flex around to the hardware store flex the 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:31.100
 traffic rega a centimeter shorter and 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:34.240
 Sell ​​your wife's like 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:37.610

 Feels without instructions but something 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.910
 worse at something uncertain 

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:54.410
 hot bavarian steel
