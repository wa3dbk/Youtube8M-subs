00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
battery choice so that we can see that

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.240 
battery choice so that we can see that
it's<00:00:50.900> full<00:00:51.260> so<00:00:51.650> we've<00:00:51.740> charged<00:00:52.010> that<00:00:52.130> for

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
that's looking very very confident the

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.120 
that's looking very very confident the
cars<00:01:26.720> a<00:01:26.960> bit<00:01:27.140> like<00:01:27.260> driving<00:01:27.409> milk<00:01:27.830> floats

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
because they take too long to pull away
