00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
this as a temporary until we get to

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.059 
this as a temporary until we get to
where<00:01:35.209> we're<00:01:35.360> going<00:01:35.470> it<00:01:36.470> just<00:01:36.500> happens<00:01:37.009> to

00:01:37.059 --> 00:01:37.069 
where we're going it just happens to

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:38.380 
where we're going it just happens to
work<00:01:37.160> out<00:01:37.490> that<00:01:37.610> it's<00:01:37.759> the<00:01:37.789> town<00:01:38.030> we<00:01:38.149> want<00:01:38.330> to

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390

eat lunch in anyway where there's a

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:43.779 
eat lunch in anyway where there's a
hardware<00:01:40.310> store<00:01:40.700> so<00:01:41.599> if<00:01:41.869> this<00:01:42.020> works<00:01:42.640> it'll<00:01:43.640> be

00:01:43.779 --> 00:01:43.789 
hardware store so if this works it'll be

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:45.309 
hardware store so if this works it'll be
nothing<00:01:43.910> to<00:01:44.119> report<00:01:44.420> if<00:01:44.690> this<00:01:44.869> doesn't<00:01:45.140> work

00:01:45.309 --> 00:01:45.319 
nothing to report if this doesn't work

swearing<00:01:47.840> on<00:01:48.050> the<00:01:48.140> side<00:01:48.289> of<00:01:48.319> the<00:01:48.440> road<00:01:48.590> that

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
swearing on the side of the road that

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.430 
swearing on the side of the road that
actually<00:01:49.130> looks<00:01:49.310> pretty<00:01:49.369> strong<00:01:49.970> yeah<00:01:50.479> the

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.440 
actually looks pretty strong yeah the

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.350 
actually looks pretty strong yeah the
wire<00:01:51.679> in<00:01:51.950> the<00:01:52.160> in<00:01:52.459> the<00:01:52.580> ties<00:01:52.789> is<00:01:53.060> actually

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
wire in the in the ties is actually

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.250 
wire in the in the ties is actually
pretty<00:01:53.539> thick<00:01:53.840> so<00:01:54.080> this<00:01:54.229> may<00:01:54.380> work

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:57.260 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.610 

so<00:01:57.680> I<00:01:58.240> just<00:01:59.240> want<00:01:59.570> the<00:01:59.690> hood<00:01:59.900> to<00:02:00.020> come<00:02:00.200> fly<00:02:00.560> it

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:00.620 
so I just want the hood to come fly it

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.210 
so I just want the hood to come fly it
up<00:02:01.690> so<00:02:02.690> the<00:02:02.960> braid<00:02:03.200> wasn't<00:02:03.560> long<00:02:03.680> enough<00:02:03.950> sand

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
up so the braid wasn't long enough sand

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.080 
up so the braid wasn't long enough sand
I'm<00:02:04.370> braiding<00:02:04.700> in<00:02:05.000> six<00:02:05.810> more<00:02:06.110> of<00:02:06.140> these<00:02:06.970> to<00:02:07.970> try

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
I'm braiding in six more of these to try

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.330 
I'm braiding in six more of these to try
to<00:02:08.210> lengthen<00:02:08.420> the<00:02:08.720> whole<00:02:08.869> thing<00:02:09.170> so<00:02:10.160> we<00:02:10.250> have

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
to lengthen the whole thing so we have

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.310 
to lengthen the whole thing so we have
the<00:02:10.460> joint<00:02:10.700> here<00:02:11.030> which<00:02:11.450> will<00:02:11.660> probably<00:02:12.110> break

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320 
the joint here which will probably break

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.950 
the joint here which will probably break
and<00:02:12.830> that<00:02:13.520> will<00:02:13.700> ruin<00:02:13.880> the<00:02:14.090> entire<00:02:14.300> endeavor<00:02:14.570> I

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:14.960 
and that will ruin the entire endeavor I

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.430 
and that will ruin the entire endeavor I
hate<00:02:15.620> it<00:02:15.740> when<00:02:15.800> the<00:02:15.920> joint<00:02:16.160> breaks
