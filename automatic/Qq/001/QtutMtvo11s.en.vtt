00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:12.750
 so people we have now half past four o'clock 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:14.549
 in the morning and I thought it shows yours 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.779
 challenge of luck I have 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:21.119
 Phoenix case opened there was none 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.640
 Next to it would have been the aka red line 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.740
 Although without track but it would be the ak 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.670
 been 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.460
 instead I have the super on 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.679
 Experts help bath is getting good 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.250
 are requesting you for a second time his luck 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.989
 and solves the contract once to see how 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.920
 Good luck I have with a contract 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:43.050
 although now 10 t 90s market things 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.309
 Eight pieces are worried 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.070
 two minimum lead 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.989
 and I read the a little bit lucky 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.190
 i get the ak suggest i have 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.860
 one way or another made a profit 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:01:00.629
 if I'm unlucky I get the 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:02.520
 article golden ax i am not 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.619
 really the type of luck with such 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:10.640
 I've got a knife 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.640
 at that time that was pretty lucky though 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:20.930
 When we look how lucky we are 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:25.070
 Of course, here are just watching 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:30.100
 That's why igel is brand new 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:30.100
 no more than four euros 70 will come from here 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:41.570
 and that's it's confirmed right there 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.570
 right there you are k 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:50.410
 It is a field and condition looks 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:55.420
 pretty good 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:55.420
 No , nothing is over yet 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:03.620
 but tested well but it does not matter 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.830
 worked out I have a ak sees computer 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:09.080
 is from soy blurred once happiness 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.880
 Had this evening I hope you have it 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:16.400
 fallen and forth until next time 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:20.450
 Get in and video we finish you 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:23.300
 is ready so people and you have 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:26.690
 I have seen the ak get the 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:30.230
 contract and the ak I could then 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:33.230
 turn more expensive than what I sell 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.820
 I just wanted to spend 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.890
 I got a bang with even better ones 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.060
 condition that's where the risk goes 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.850
 now again 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:45.520
 I would be minimal to them plus no 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:50.209
 - and yes, I 'll be back 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:54.080
 bought and just hope that it 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:56.780
 at least again as if that 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:00.350
 saddle is it can also be factories 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:04.220
 it from anyway and if that's worth it 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:07.090
 Really it succeeds really insane 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:09.860
 if I had so much luck again but 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.989
 very good, what 's up with fans 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.030
 title is behavior 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:21.160
 as effective as me, and then 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:21.160
 bad luck and is close 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:31.280
 state looks exactly the same wish 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:33.810
 Fooling me is exactly the same 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:39.030
 You seem to get used very often 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:42.359
 because exactly the same as much as he does 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:44.579
 now always one that I think 

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:46.560
 even if it still try third time 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:53.370
 and our good third out calls 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:57.209
 this is the third time to look like 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:04:00.799
 I ak we sell it like that again 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:00.799
 and there we are again 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:08.459
 yes I have becker sold again 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:10.260
 this time also screw some more and 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:12.019
 that maybe a sign is me now 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:17.450
 will not come back 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:17.450
 all are brand new trees 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:30.919
 the p 19 is different they are just 

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:30.919
 from minimal to use threatens 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.580
 three times in a row card already 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.890
 just a damn lot of youth at some point 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.360
 I have to watch the lucky streak 

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:42.770
 just had to stay with the first one 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.910
 but good but no 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:48.140
 who necessarily with a better condition 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:53.540
 and I'll see what I got from it 

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:55.400
 I will have all honesty, emotion 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:56.690
 Unfortunately, one of these titles is found 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:04.310
 state be okay for 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:05.810
 no it is close and condition looks exactly 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:09.290
 Immediately felt I was kidding it 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:13.760
 again use per minimal woman too 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:15.800
 yes yes yes it was really worth it 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:22.040
 it was not worth it 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:24.410
 yes people so you get so before 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:27.080
 Snake is unfortunately without stepway everything 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:27.850
 but no one understands clearly 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:32.300
 needs traces 

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:35.300
 honestly I think that will mean mine 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:37.610
 standard ak will not be a star trek 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:41.090
 but hey what s to the circular super nice 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:44.200
 and I hope I had the video 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:47.420
 you like it and you can see it too 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:50.770
 a pretty came in the old building also jumps 

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:52.910
 brand new if you are lucky 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:54.080
 The condition of the weapons should be 

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:55.610
 be really care 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:58.820
 So now all was pretty much 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:00.170
 I spent only reason to forgive 

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:02.960
 I was lucky 

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:06.050
 At least that should be the case in the evening 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:07.970
 said if you liked the video 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:09.710
 then sound like it 

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:14.030
 otherwise you can still subscribe 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:16.250
 just not yet subscribed and yes how 

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:17.800
 said until next time I hope 

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:21.020
 you liked it 

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:28.810
