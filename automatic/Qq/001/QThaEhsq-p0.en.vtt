00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
saying density maintenance formula so

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.140 
saying density maintenance formula so
let's<00:01:40.650> look<00:01:40.860> at<00:01:41.009> our<00:01:41.100> formula<00:01:41.610> what<00:01:41.790> is<00:01:41.820> the

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
let's look at our formula what is the

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.179 
let's look at our formula what is the
density<00:01:42.420> maintenance<00:01:42.840> work<00:01:43.049> we're<00:01:43.890> going<00:01:44.130> to

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
density maintenance work we're going to

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:52.990 
density maintenance work we're going to
use<00:01:45.290> mass<00:01:46.290> one<00:01:47.509> over<00:01:49.909> mass<00:01:50.909> two<00:01:51.409> equals

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
use mass one over mass two equals

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.830 
use mass one over mass two equals
distance<00:01:54.000> one<00:01:54.890> squared<00:01:55.890> this<00:01:56.130> is<00:01:56.189> directly

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
distance one squared this is directly

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.700 
distance one squared this is directly
proportional<00:01:57.840> to<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:58.020> square<00:01:58.229> of<00:01:58.469> the

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
proportional to the square of the

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.899 
proportional to the square of the
distance<00:01:59.810> not<00:02:00.810> inversely<00:02:01.350> over<00:02:02.310> D<00:02:02.490> two

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
distance not inversely over D two

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.609 
distance not inversely over D two
squared<00:02:04.189> so<00:02:05.840> let's<00:02:06.840> do<00:02:07.020> like<00:02:07.049> we<00:02:07.350> did<00:02:07.469> on<00:02:07.590> the

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
squared so let's do like we did on the

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.910 
squared so let's do like we did on the
last<00:02:07.950> video<00:02:08.220> I'm<00:02:08.940> just<00:02:09.000> going<00:02:09.209> to<00:02:09.270> kind<00:02:09.539> of

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:16.409 
as you do these and kind of can breeze

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:18.050 
as you do these and kind of can breeze
right<00:02:16.590> so<00:02:16.739> we<00:02:16.829> don't<00:02:17.129> need<00:02:17.189> to<00:02:17.250> do<00:02:17.430> that<00:02:17.609> but<00:02:17.849> I

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
right so we don't need to do that but I

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.830 
right so we don't need to do that but I
like<00:02:18.780> to<00:02:18.959> just<00:02:18.989> show<00:02:19.290> it<00:02:19.469> for<00:02:20.040> the<00:02:20.129> time<00:02:20.340> being

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
like to just show it for the time being

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.539 
like to just show it for the time being
all<00:02:21.840> right<00:02:22.019> so<00:02:22.200> mass<00:02:22.739> one<00:02:23.040> over<00:02:23.219> mass<00:02:23.370> two

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:23.549 
all right so mass one over mass two

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:26.890 
all right so mass one over mass two
equals<00:02:23.790> D<00:02:23.969> 1<00:02:24.239> squared<00:02:24.870> over<00:02:25.079> D<00:02:25.379> 2<00:02:25.590> squared

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
equals D 1 squared over D 2 squared

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.750 
equals D 1 squared over D 2 squared
let's<00:02:27.900> find<00:02:28.140> our<00:02:28.290> mass<00:02:28.469> 1<00:02:28.829> which<00:02:29.340> is<00:02:29.519> 10<00:02:31.489> mass<00:02:32.489> 2

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
let's find our mass 1 which is 10 mass 2

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.910 
let's find our mass 1 which is 10 mass 2
it's<00:02:33.030> what<00:02:33.180> it's<00:02:33.329> asking<00:02:33.510> for<00:02:33.840> so<00:02:34.590> we<00:02:34.769> don't

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
it's what it's asking for so we don't

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.089 
it's what it's asking for so we don't
know<00:02:35.099> it's<00:02:35.310> going<00:02:35.549> to<00:02:35.609> be<00:02:35.730> X<00:02:36.650> and<00:02:37.650> then<00:02:37.829> we<00:02:37.950> just

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
know it's going to be X and then we just

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:39.530 
know it's going to be X and then we just
need<00:02:38.159> our<00:02:38.370> distances<00:02:38.909> so<00:02:39.090> we<00:02:39.239> don't<00:02:39.389> really

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
need our distances so we don't really

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:40.670 
need our distances so we don't really
need<00:02:39.719> milli<00:02:40.049> Rincon

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
need milli Rincon

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.539 
need milli Rincon
we<00:02:40.799> don't<00:02:40.980> need<00:02:41.040> kbp<00:02:42.709> we<00:02:43.709> have<00:02:43.889> our<00:02:44.040> distances

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
we don't need kbp we have our distances

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:48.890 
we don't need kbp we have our distances
we<00:02:44.700> want<00:02:44.909> to<00:02:44.969> keep<00:02:45.150> this<00:02:47.269> I'll<00:02:48.269> just<00:02:48.299> cross<00:02:48.689> out

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
we want to keep this I'll just cross out

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.270 
we want to keep this I'll just cross out
the<00:02:49.079> exposure<00:02:49.500> because<00:02:49.799> we<00:02:49.980> don't<00:02:50.159> really

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
the exposure because we don't really

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.140 
the exposure because we don't really
care<00:02:51.290> and<00:02:52.290> let's<00:02:52.560> circle<00:02:52.980> our<00:02:53.099> 60<00:02:53.579> inches<00:02:53.939> as

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
care and let's circle our 60 inches as

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.199 
care and let's circle our 60 inches as
well<00:02:54.500> so<00:02:55.500> distance<00:02:55.980> 1<00:02:56.310> squared<00:02:56.790> is<00:02:57.000> going<00:02:57.120> to

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
well so distance 1 squared is going to

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.420 
well so distance 1 squared is going to
be<00:02:57.889> 40<00:02:58.889> squared<00:02:59.219> over<00:02:59.790> distance<00:03:00.269> 2<00:03:00.510> was<00:03:00.810> 60

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
be 40 squared over distance 2 was 60

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.000 
be 40 squared over distance 2 was 60
squared<00:03:02.430> now<00:03:03.120> again<00:03:03.540> we're<00:03:03.689> going<00:03:03.810> to<00:03:04.010> reduce

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
squared now again we're going to reduce

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:10.369 
squared now again we're going to reduce
here<00:03:05.419> this<00:03:06.419> reduces<00:03:06.780> to<00:03:07.079> 2/3<00:03:08.269> and<00:03:09.269> we<00:03:10.139> can't

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:10.379 
here this reduces to 2/3 and we can't

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:11.839 
here this reduces to 2/3 and we can't
forget<00:03:10.530> to<00:03:10.709> square<00:03:11.129> it<00:03:11.159> I'm<00:03:11.459> just<00:03:11.669> going<00:03:11.790> to

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:11.849 
forget to square it I'm just going to

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:13.869 
forget to square it I'm just going to
write<00:03:12.000> this<00:03:12.180> out<00:03:12.389> here<00:03:12.629> because<00:03:12.810> some<00:03:12.989> people

00:03:13.869 --> 00:03:13.879 
write this out here because some people

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:16.339 
write this out here because some people
have<00:03:14.879> trouble<00:03:15.120> following<00:03:15.659> what<00:03:15.840> I'm<00:03:15.959> doing

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:16.349 
have trouble following what I'm doing

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:20.210 
have trouble following what I'm doing
here<00:03:16.590> on<00:03:18.169> the<00:03:19.169> whiteboard<00:03:19.379> when<00:03:19.769> I'm<00:03:19.889> in<00:03:20.040> class

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
here on the whiteboard when I'm in class

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.189 
here on the whiteboard when I'm in class
so<00:03:20.699> I'm<00:03:21.359> just<00:03:21.510> going<00:03:21.629> to<00:03:21.690> get<00:03:21.870> rid<00:03:22.019> of<00:03:22.049> this

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:22.199 
so I'm just going to get rid of this

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:24.530 
so I'm just going to get rid of this
whole<00:03:22.379> thing<00:03:22.519> move<00:03:23.519> what<00:03:23.729> I<00:03:23.760> just<00:03:24.030> did<00:03:24.269> by

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
whole thing move what I just did by

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.089 
whole thing move what I just did by
reducing<00:03:25.109> to<00:03:25.409> 2/3<00:03:27.079> squared<00:03:28.079> over<00:03:28.709> here

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:29.099 
reducing to 2/3 squared over here

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:34.550 
reducing to 2/3 squared over here
now<00:03:29.430> let's<00:03:29.669> swear<00:03:29.970> this<00:03:30.290> to<00:03:31.290> 4<00:03:32.840> nights<00:03:33.840> and<00:03:34.379> we

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
now let's swear this to 4 nights and we

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.750 
now let's swear this to 4 nights and we
just<00:03:34.799> squared<00:03:35.069> it<00:03:35.250> so<00:03:35.370> I'm<00:03:35.459> just<00:03:35.609> going<00:03:35.729> to

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
just squared it so I'm just going to

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.149 
just squared it so I'm just going to
cross<00:03:36.000> that<00:03:36.209> out<00:03:36.269> too<00:03:36.680> so<00:03:37.680> I'm<00:03:37.949> going<00:03:38.099> to

00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:38.159 
cross that out too so I'm going to

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:41.030 
cross that out too so I'm going to
rewrite<00:03:38.340> it<00:03:38.519> just<00:03:38.819> for<00:03:39.000> clarity<00:03:39.359> here<00:03:39.569> 10<00:03:40.470> over

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
rewrite it just for clarity here 10 over

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:46.699 
rewrite it just for clarity here 10 over
x<00:03:41.939> equals<00:03:42.389> 4<00:03:43.349> over<00:03:43.939> 9<00:03:45.319> so<00:03:46.319> let's<00:03:46.500> cross

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
x equals 4 over 9 so let's cross

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.979 
x equals 4 over 9 so let's cross
multiply<00:03:46.769> this<00:03:47.370> way<00:03:47.699> first<00:03:48.030> I'm<00:03:48.509> going<00:03:48.659> to<00:03:48.780> say

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
multiply this way first I'm going to say

00:03:48.989 --> 00:04:03.890 
multiply this way first I'm going to say
90<00:03:50.030> equals<00:03:51.979> 4x<00:03:55.280> divided<00:03:56.280> by<00:03:56.519> 4<00:04:01.759> so<00:04:02.759> our<00:04:03.030> answer

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
90 equals 4x divided by 4 so our answer

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.460 
90 equals 4x divided by 4 so our answer
is<00:04:04.459> 22<00:04:05.459> point<00:04:06.060> 5<00:04:06.419> and<00:04:06.750> I<00:04:06.840> can<00:04:07.019> do<00:04:07.139> the<00:04:07.259> long

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
is 22 point 5 and I can do the long

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.949 
is 22 point 5 and I can do the long
division<00:04:07.680> you<00:04:08.040> can<00:04:08.340> do<00:04:08.400> the<00:04:08.519> calculator<00:04:09.120> let's

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
division you can do the calculator let's

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:12.170 
division you can do the calculator let's
just<00:04:10.199> do<00:04:10.349> the<00:04:10.500> calculator<00:04:11.069> here<00:04:11.340> this<00:04:12.000> is

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
just do the calculator here this is

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:20.659 
just do the calculator here this is
going<00:04:12.389> to<00:04:12.479> be<00:04:12.659> 9<00:04:13.470> 0<00:04:14.479> divided<00:04:15.479> by<00:04:15.509> 4<00:04:17.659> 22.5

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
going to be 9 0 divided by 4 22.5

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:27.930 

boy<00:04:21.669> I<00:04:21.699> was<00:04:22.000> right<00:04:22.419> go<00:04:22.600> figure<00:04:26.550> sometimes<00:04:27.550> you

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
boy I was right go figure sometimes you

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:29.520 
boy I was right go figure sometimes you
know<00:04:28.060> I<00:04:28.090> like<00:04:28.660> I'm<00:04:28.870> really<00:04:29.139> good<00:04:29.290> at<00:04:29.380> doing

know I like I'm really good at doing

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.030 
know I like I'm really good at doing
these<00:04:29.770> in<00:04:29.949> my<00:04:30.100> head<00:04:30.630> but<00:04:31.630> after<00:04:32.020> an<00:04:32.410> hour<00:04:32.620> of

doing these as a student you can kind of

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.629 
doing these as a student you can kind of
start<00:04:36.970> you<00:04:37.389> know<00:04:37.540> I<00:04:38.139> don't<00:04:38.979> know<00:04:39.040> your<00:04:39.220> brain

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:39.639 
start you know I don't know your brain

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:41.030 
start you know I don't know your brain
kind<00:04:39.850> of<00:04:39.940> wanders<00:04:40.360> you<00:04:40.510> lose<00:04:40.690> concentration

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040 
kind of wanders you lose concentration

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.350 
kind of wanders you lose concentration
you<00:04:42.040> just<00:04:42.250> start<00:04:42.430> writing<00:04:42.610> numbers<00:04:42.820> down<00:04:43.150> you

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
you just start writing numbers down you

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.580 
you just start writing numbers down you
don't<00:04:43.570> really<00:04:43.690> think<00:04:43.900> about<00:04:44.050> it<00:04:44.320> so<00:04:44.440> it's

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
don't really think about it so it's

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.230 
don't really think about it so it's
always<00:04:44.740> good<00:04:45.010> to<00:04:45.040> use<00:04:45.220> the<00:04:45.340> calculator<00:04:45.550> just

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
always good to use the calculator just

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.510 
always good to use the calculator just
to<00:04:46.900> check<00:04:47.110> they<00:04:47.860> are<00:04:48.010> allowed<00:04:48.280> on<00:04:48.430> the

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 
to check they are allowed on the

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:49.980 
to check they are allowed on the
registry<00:04:48.970> simple<00:04:49.389> four<00:04:49.600> function<00:04:49.960> calculator

registry simple four function calculator
will<00:04:50.680> do<00:04:51.180> anyway<00:04:52.180> so<00:04:53.400> 22.5<00:04:54.660> let's<00:04:55.660> round<00:04:55.930> that

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 
will do anyway so 22.5 let's round that

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.010 
will do anyway so 22.5 let's round that
to<00:04:56.440> the<00:04:56.470> nearest<00:04:56.650> whole<00:04:57.160> number<00:04:57.810> so<00:04:58.810> we're

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020 
to the nearest whole number so we're

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:05.040 
to the nearest whole number so we're
going<00:04:59.139> to<00:04:59.229> call<00:04:59.470> it<00:05:00.510> 23<00:05:02.070> mass<00:05:03.660> that<00:05:04.660> is<00:05:04.900> our

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050 
going to call it 23 mass that is our

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:10.020 
going to call it 23 mass that is our
answer<00:05:05.320> I<00:05:06.300> like<00:05:07.300> it<00:05:07.479> just<00:05:07.870> just<00:05:08.620> in<00:05:09.030> theory

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:10.030 
answer I like it just just in theory

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:12.060 
answer I like it just just in theory
here<00:05:10.389> though<00:05:10.540> let's<00:05:10.810> let's<00:05:11.229> think<00:05:11.350> about<00:05:11.680> this

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:12.070 
here though let's let's think about this

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.550 
here though let's let's think about this
the<00:05:12.280> density<00:05:12.490> maintenance<00:05:13.210> formula<00:05:13.720> if

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.560 
the density maintenance formula if

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.210 
the density maintenance formula if
you're<00:05:15.039> going<00:05:15.510> to<00:05:16.710> let's<00:05:17.710> see<00:05:17.860> what<00:05:18.010> we<00:05:18.130> do

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:18.220 
you're going to let's see what we do

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.310 
you're going to let's see what we do
with<00:05:18.250> our<00:05:18.460> increase<00:05:18.820> with<00:05:19.630> our<00:05:19.750> distance<00:05:20.139> we

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:20.320 
with our increase with our distance we

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.379 
with our increase with our distance we
increased<00:05:20.770> it<00:05:20.949> if<00:05:21.699> you're<00:05:21.850> going<00:05:21.940> to<00:05:22.030> increase

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:22.389 
increased it if you're going to increase

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:24.659 
increased it if you're going to increase
your<00:05:22.510> distance<00:05:23.020> from<00:05:23.169> 40<00:05:23.620> inches<00:05:23.979> to<00:05:24.220> 60

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:24.669 
your distance from 40 inches to 60

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:31.279 
your distance from 40 inches to 60
inches<00:05:25.000> your<00:05:25.979> intensity<00:05:26.979> decreases<00:05:28.620> so<00:05:29.620> the

00:05:31.279 --> 00:05:31.289 
inches your intensity decreases so the

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:34.469 
inches your intensity decreases so the
amount<00:05:32.289> of<00:05:32.530> technical<00:05:33.190> factor<00:05:33.789> usage<00:05:34.180> or<00:05:34.389> the

that<00:05:38.470> exposure<00:05:38.919> is<00:05:39.310> going<00:05:39.639> to<00:05:39.760> have<00:05:39.970> to

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:40.090 
that exposure is going to have to

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:44.610 
that exposure is going to have to
increase<00:05:40.510> so<00:05:41.320> your<00:05:41.710> mass<00:05:42.430> to<00:05:43.060> value<00:05:43.630> right

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:44.620 
increase so your mass to value right

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:48.420 
increase so your mass to value right
here<00:05:45.070> we<00:05:45.520> which<00:05:45.910> we<00:05:45.940> got<00:05:46.270> was<00:05:46.599> 23<00:05:47.200> should<00:05:48.130> be

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:48.430 
here we which we got was 23 should be

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:52.200 
here we which we got was 23 should be
higher<00:05:48.940> than<00:05:49.440> the<00:05:50.440> original<00:05:51.099> mass<00:05:51.310> 1<00:05:51.729> which<00:05:52.000> is

higher than the original mass 1 which is
10<00:05:52.510> up<00:05:52.750> here<00:05:53.020> and<00:05:53.830> it<00:05:54.039> is<00:05:54.330> you<00:05:55.330> know<00:05:55.360> you<00:05:55.510> can

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:55.810 
10 up here and it is you know you can

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:57.930 
10 up here and it is you know you can
shoot<00:05:56.229> that<00:05:56.500> exposure<00:05:56.950> probably<00:05:57.639> in<00:05:57.760> your

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:57.940 
shoot that exposure probably in your

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:00.360 
shoot that exposure probably in your
clinical<00:05:58.750> side<00:05:58.990> on<00:05:59.139> a<00:05:59.169> phantom<00:05:59.770> or<00:05:59.889> in<00:06:00.039> your

lab it should work out these are pretty

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:06.240 
lab it should work out these are pretty
good<00:06:03.190> formulas<00:06:03.729> very<00:06:04.000> accurate<00:06:04.599> and<00:06:05.130> you<00:06:06.130> know

I<00:06:06.280> hope<00:06:06.550> this<00:06:06.760> helps<00:06:07.150> I<00:06:07.360> think<00:06:08.200> that<00:06:08.680> you<00:06:08.889> can

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:09.070 
I hope this helps I think that you can

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:10.620 
I hope this helps I think that you can
get<00:06:09.190> really<00:06:09.460> confused<00:06:10.030> like<00:06:10.180> I<00:06:10.330> said<00:06:10.510> in<00:06:10.599> my

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:10.630 
get really confused like I said in my

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:13.890 
get really confused like I said in my

density maintenance formula look for

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.210 
density maintenance formula look for
those<00:06:19.479> key<00:06:19.750> words<00:06:19.780> this<00:06:20.620> one<00:06:20.860> we<00:06:21.010> had

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:21.220 
those key words this one we had

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:25.200 
those key words this one we had
maintained<00:06:22.090> density<00:06:23.220> and<00:06:24.220> we<00:06:24.460> also<00:06:24.610> had<00:06:24.970> what

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:25.210 
maintained density and we also had what

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:27.839 
maintained density and we also had what
new<00:06:25.450> mass<00:06:25.860> inverse<00:06:26.860> square<00:06:27.160> law<00:06:27.340> doesn't<00:06:27.580> have

00:06:27.839 --> 00:06:27.849 
new mass inverse square law doesn't have

00:06:27.849 --> 00:06:29.670 
new mass inverse square law doesn't have
a<00:06:27.880> mass<00:06:28.180> value<00:06:28.690> as<00:06:28.840> part<00:06:29.020> of<00:06:29.110> the<00:06:29.200> variable
