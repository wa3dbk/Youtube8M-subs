00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:26.160
 good morning from the kitchen evolved today 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.660
 we will prepare the raw couscous for 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.960
 what about the equipment there 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:35.070
 you need a mix with the shaped blade 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:37.170
 they are crushing yo for how much 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.379
 concerns the ingredients for two 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.050
 portions that need half a cauliflower 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.899
 corresponding more or less to 360 grams 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:50.010
 well clean therefore without leaves and the 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:52.050
 thicker part of the stem a pinch of 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.659
 turmeric plus or minus a third of 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.559
 we will need the vegetables teaspoon 

00:00:54.659 --> 00:01:03.649
 half red pepper half coast of 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:06.810
 celery a carrot with peel 6 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:12.270
 small tomatoes corresponding more or less to 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:13.969
 180 grams 2 tablespoons of which fleas i 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:18.240
 fruits of the caper plant 

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:21.329
 desalinate about ten san tomatoes 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.270
 our marzanos are dried and rehydrated 

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:27.090
 they are in oil but they are great too 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:29.759
 no oil in regards to 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:34.070
 the emulsion with which we will say the 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:37.100
 cous cous and we need 3 tablespoons of oil 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:40.170
 cold pressed extra virgin olive oil 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:45.359
 freshly ground black pepper to taste 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:50.570
 a third of a teaspoon of cumin in 

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:54.179
 powder 5 grams of sweet onion 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:57.149
 absolutely optional so you can 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:59.509
 also perhaps even better to remove it from 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.509
 ingredients 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.439
 we have inserted it because it is part 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:07.220
 of the traditional couscous recipe 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:08.729
 a tablespoon of fresh parsley 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.800
 chopped 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:15.690
 let's move on to the procedure 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:19.020
 we whisk the cauliflower until obtaining 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:25.050
 the classic grain of couscous lo 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:27.780
 we whine together with turmeric this is 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.120
 the grain that we kept whipping 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.190
 for just under 10 seconds at 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.710
 maximum speed of the blender as 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.140
 you see it is very yellow it is already at the point 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:39.090
 given by the presence of turmeric is 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.650
 very much like couscous 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.080
 now we move on to the preparation of 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:50.610
 vegetables then cut into small cubes 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:52.770
 the pepper add the pepper in the 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.030
 container where we put the cous 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.920
 cous 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.450
 now we cut into small cubes i 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:02.550
 cherry tomatoes if you want before you can 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:08.550
 deprive them of seeds to make the cous 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:11.370
 we therefore add less watery cous i 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:14.370
 diced cherry tomatoes 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:20.390
 such we are perhaps with the scissors for a 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:22.920
 work facilitated the dried tomatoes 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:26.820
 Italian small bits we add 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:30.230
 the dried tomatoes are cut into small 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.230
 also the celery ribs pieces 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:39.660
 add chopped celery add 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:44.610
 the Italian desalted ashlars the carrot e 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:46.140
 we further divide each meta into 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:52.140
 half 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:54.640
 and then cut it into small pieces 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:59.319
 add the carrot to this point 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:01.780
 we create the emulsion so we put the 5 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:04.030
 grams of onion just like it was 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:10.150
 a clove of garlic and crush the 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:19.919
 onion here is done we add the 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:24.600
 parsley powder cumin pepper 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:24.600
 ground fresh enough 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:32.260
 that's enough and finally the three tablespoons of 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:40.800
 extra virgin olive oil aspect a 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:43.660
 cold 1 2 and 3 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:46.600
 then a spoon and a half of oil a 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:50.889
 portion however is a quantity 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:52.349
 absolutely modifiable according to 

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:56.460
 personal uses 

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:59.669
 we mix everything well 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:04.289
 if you want you can of course add 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:07.870
 a pinch of integral sea salt 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:11.070
 we begin to mix the taste moves 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:15.720
 with all the vegetables we cut 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:19.210
 just add a tablespoon of 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:20.950
 emulsion the rest we will reach the 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:28.980
 time of presentation 

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:31.150
 breath is half a half spoonful 

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:35.530
 option 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:37.630
 here is the couscous and ready good 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:40.620
 the most advanced kitchen goes to everyone and to 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:40.620
