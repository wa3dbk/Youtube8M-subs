00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.520 

so<00:01:29.329> could<00:01:30.259> you<00:01:30.289> tell<00:01:30.409> me<00:01:30.770> more<00:01:30.920> about<00:01:30.979> siphon

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
so could you tell me more about siphon

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.069 
so could you tell me more about siphon
not<00:01:33.530> until<00:01:33.799> you<00:01:33.950> sign<00:01:34.159> my<00:01:34.369> agreement<00:01:34.939> it's<00:01:35.869> the

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:36.079 
not until you sign my agreement it's the

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:39.850 
not until you sign my agreement it's the
binding<00:01:36.619> contract<00:01:37.630> your<00:01:38.630> research<00:01:39.079> proposal

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
binding contract your research proposal

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.850 
binding contract your research proposal
doesn't<00:01:40.070> say<00:01:40.369> anything<00:01:40.729> about<00:01:40.789> binding<00:01:41.509> I<00:01:41.860> i

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
doesn't say anything about binding I i

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.590 
doesn't say anything about binding I i
guess<00:01:43.340> my<00:01:43.520> eyes<00:01:43.700> really<00:01:43.880> not<00:01:44.149> a<00:01:44.179> time<00:01:44.390> before

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
guess my eyes really not a time before

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.139 
guess my eyes really not a time before
so<00:01:45.500> maybe<00:01:45.860> it<00:01:46.069> could<00:01:46.310> be<00:01:46.490> single<00:01:47.479> blinded<00:01:48.020> or

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:49.149 
so maybe it could be single blinded or

00:01:49.149 --> 00:02:00.899 
so maybe it could be single blinded or
double<00:01:50.149> flames

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:00.909 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:03.660 

the<00:02:01.780> proposal<00:02:02.170> you<00:02:02.439> submitted<00:02:03.009> with<00:02:03.189> absolute

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
the proposal you submitted with absolute

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:16.150 
the proposal you submitted with absolute
rubbish<00:02:03.999> I<00:02:04.479> don't<00:02:05.049> think<00:02:05.229> you<00:02:05.319> understand

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.190 

Oh
