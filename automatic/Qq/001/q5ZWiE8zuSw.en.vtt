00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
happens is when it dries these will be

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.949 
happens is when it dries these will be
sticking<00:02:11.940> straight<00:02:12.270> up<00:02:12.330> and<00:02:12.690> you<00:02:12.750> don't<00:02:12.840> want

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
sticking straight up and you don't want

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.250 
sticking straight up and you don't want
that<00:02:13.110> so<00:02:13.500> just<00:02:14.989> comb<00:02:15.989> it<00:02:16.140> down

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260
