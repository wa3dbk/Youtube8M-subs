00:00:00.039 --> 00:00:02.360
 after six months when the baby is already 

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:05.129
 may agree with you 

00:00:05.129 --> 00:00:07.359
 let's say on the newsletter offer 

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:08.569
 he has such time 

00:00:08.569 --> 00:00:10.689
 by the way this box 

00:00:10.689 --> 00:00:13.389
 can you shake and draw attention 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:15.909
 child say something he said almost 

00:00:15.909 --> 00:00:17.529
 lies let's see 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:20.210
 and of course in the first stages of the cover 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.009
 opens in the world then guests baby 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:24.210
 open the lid 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.149
 so he opened this roof 

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:28.459
 and what will you do? 

00:00:28.459 --> 00:00:31.410
 child get items out of the box 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.370
 it is very easy for adults and him 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.100
 nothing in it is interesting and 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.879
 difficult for a child is very difficult 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.609
 the child needs to let go of the handle 

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:43.210
 grab a toy and release 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.670
 but therefore they are trained quite 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.690
 quickly especially if sadness is big after 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.330
 when the kid in the media clinic rains out 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:52.059
 the boxes 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:55.210
 you can begin to heal and pay 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.580
 when a child learns well it 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.660
 do 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.730
 you can use 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.800
 here are the balls 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.320
 such glasses can be bought in any 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.760
 I think that the store 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.430
 you can replace them with a glomerular minister 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.110
 or something like that 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.020
 designer things 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.940
 body length was a teacher only 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.430
 brothers and ball 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:22.670
 out of the box 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.170
 leaving assets for example 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:25.490
 Pakhtakor plastic 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.979
 cup pass mass cup too 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:28.870
 problem 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.490
 thought out right everyone has 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.619
 these are also quite complex actions for 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:35.729
 baby because first you need to take 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.670
 This mexico then put at all 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.090
 cup this is this we also have to 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.070
 long to learn 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:43.170
 yuri 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.460
 evolves they are complicated baby 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.850
 growing develops it does not stand still and 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.250
 india is also the next stage 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.430
 even more complicated is the news to notice and 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:56.800
 wanted list 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.530
 can be like this 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.900
 There is no such difficulty Artts probably have to 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.610
 class hand can not school and then 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.860
 shift that quality is permissible 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.079
 is an exercise to critical 

00:02:08.079 --> 00:02:09.989
 can understand that it is time to 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.859
 harder than the bank on the basis of which 

00:02:11.859 --> 00:02:14.710
 proposed to the child sooner or later 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:17.219
 it becomes very simple for him 

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:20.039
 and they will need to complicate a little 

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:21.809
 and it will be necessary to complicate it then 

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:24.049
 when the child previous tasks 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:27.049
 performs one hundred percent 

00:02:30.369 --> 00:02:32.330
 quality and i will go 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.249
 I do not know that they fell pigeon on the ice 

00:02:36.249 --> 00:02:38.089
 not going 

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:39.400
 developing 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.439
 creatively half a year anthony challenging games 

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:43.919
 during which the child starts 

00:02:43.919 --> 00:02:46.040
 take the simplest things 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.430
 what can be done and what is not allowed 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.400
 draw attention to yourself and how 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.930
 do the right thing 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.549
 Of course when choosing a game you need to consider 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:57.269
 the nature of his child his 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:58.269
 inclinations 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:01.230
 if one child toss a speaker 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.209
 machine download on your lap and it will 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.730
 broadcast from delight here for another 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.279
 child maybe these games are not 

00:03:07.279 --> 00:03:09.620
 fit because it will be afraid of such 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.089
 under the influence of strong 

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:14.149
 told another child we will 

00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:15.959
 give advice rub 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:17.739
 like the eye itself 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:19.249
 or 

00:03:19.249 --> 00:03:21.939
 there goes kozar nasty for example 

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:22.980

 they belong to the barracks 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.030
 while I am calm for this short such 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.309
 expensive 

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:51.819
 similar games for children are very useful 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:53.990
 in all directions of their development 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:56.400

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.859
 it is considered completely completely not necessarily 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:07.699
 when the baby starts to lie on 

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:08.549
 stomach 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:11.219

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.780
 most you develop his speech 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.710
 turn will take 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.719
 turn the page 

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:39.220
 here and here we have got a lock 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:40.620

00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:45.460
 telecentre 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.840
 five six months you ask him where 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.249
 got a fracture usa 

00:04:49.249 --> 00:04:51.209
 if we show something else 

00:04:51.209 --> 00:04:53.189
 let's say a butterfly 

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:55.610
 never say no it's not 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:56.460

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:57.300
 tell me 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.419
 it was being right 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:00.199
 showed 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:01.930
 but got it 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.229
 many years we will have to show everything 

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:07.650
 all these pictures in this book 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:09.979
 so as educational games and it's not easy 

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:13.490
 fun and exercise for nobody since we 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.280
 already said they should be conducted 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.190
 regularly if you ask a child 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:19.879
 well, let's say 

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:22.509
 aleshin who has how you do 

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:24.759
 we have to wait a little bit because 

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:27.629
 to answer you guys 

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:30.879
 it will take some time and if not 

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:33.050
 waited impatiently said 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:34.939
 something else or even turned away 

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:37.580
 that the childâ€™s answer will then remain 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.210
 but will not work on the game 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:40.979
 so parents need to manifest 

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:43.740
 patience in games with a child is another 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:45.810
 very important point and which by no means 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:47.900
 case we must not forget it 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:49.029
 praise 

00:05:49.029 --> 00:05:51.259
 after the baby and you state 

00:05:51.259 --> 00:05:53.290
 noted or did right 

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:54.960
 his memory is not forgotten 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.550
 for a child, praise is the most valuable thing 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:58.900
 to hear us 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.190
 even if the child does not always work 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:02.889
 remove the spiral ring 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:06.009
 relocate a glass cup 

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:08.020
 Do not tell him that he 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:10.069
 did wrong or he didn't 

00:06:10.069 --> 00:06:12.869
 It turns out tell you is getting younger today 

00:06:12.869 --> 00:06:14.139
 it turned out and stayed 

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:16.270
 part and all 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:18.460
 the more he will save the child those 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:20.919
 will be quickly brought up successfully 

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:23.199
 one crosses the child's intelligence 

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:24.990
 his other walls 

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:27.190
 besides this let's say global 

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:29.860
 excellent there is certainly a difference in 

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:32.199
 games for different ages 

00:06:32.199 --> 00:06:35.199
 constantly only one 

00:06:35.869 --> 00:06:38.210
 pennant play the very beginning 

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:41.009
 and he say when to stop playing with 

00:06:41.009 --> 00:06:43.150
 child can never because 

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:43.990
 all people 

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:46.039
 selling adults continues to play up 

00:06:46.039 --> 00:06:49.039
 the end of our lives we 

00:06:51.809 --> 00:06:54.809
 are trying 

00:06:57.119 --> 00:06:57.279
 km
