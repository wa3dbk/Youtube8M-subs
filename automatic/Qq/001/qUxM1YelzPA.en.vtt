tools its just oh wait the only reason I
bought<00:00:35.449> that<00:00:35.510> is<00:00:35.750> because<00:00:35.960> it<00:00:36.140> was<00:00:36.289> clearanced

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.739

out<00:00:36.890> and<00:00:37.160> I<00:00:37.340> figured<00:00:37.640> I<00:00:37.730> could<00:00:37.910> use<00:00:38.030> it<00:00:38.179> at<00:00:38.269> some

00:00:38.439 --> 00:00:38.449 
out and I figured I could use it at some

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:40.150 
out and I figured I could use it at some
point<00:00:38.480> some<00:00:38.960> time<00:00:39.170> and<00:00:39.350> well<00:00:39.559> eventually<00:00:39.890> I

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.160 
point some time and well eventually I

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.470 
point some time and well eventually I
did<00:00:40.219> so<00:00:40.969> um<00:00:41.420> if<00:00:42.260> you<00:00:42.440> have<00:00:42.559> a<00:00:42.589> pasta<00:00:43.010> machine

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.480 
did so um if you have a pasta machine

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.000 
did so um if you have a pasta machine
you<00:00:44.480> it's<00:00:45.050> this<00:00:45.350> is<00:00:45.440> going<00:00:45.559> to<00:00:45.620> be<00:00:45.679> really<00:00:45.859> easy

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
you it's this is going to be really easy

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.799 
you it's this is going to be really easy
and<00:00:46.460> if<00:00:46.579> not<00:00:46.789> you<00:00:46.969> can<00:00:47.059> just<00:00:47.210> try<00:00:47.390> and<00:00:47.510> roll<00:00:47.660> out

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809 
and if not you can just try and roll out

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
make a bunch of these because this will

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.999 
make a bunch of these because this will
be<00:01:18.979> on<00:01:19.790> the<00:01:20.390> same<00:01:20.719> size<00:01:20.990> and<00:01:21.380> that's<00:01:21.649> just<00:01:21.860> you
