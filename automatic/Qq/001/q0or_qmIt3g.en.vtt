00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:31.720 
so on the back of the keyboard here we

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.600 
so on the back of the keyboard here we
have<00:00:31.990> four<00:00:32.349> rubber<00:00:32.529> maps<00:00:32.830> which<00:00:33.100> is<00:00:33.310> to

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:33.610 
have four rubber maps which is to

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.040 
have four rubber maps which is to
prevent<00:00:33.790> the<00:00:33.970> keyboard<00:00:34.360> from<00:00:34.539> being<00:00:34.780> able<00:00:34.870> to

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.050 
prevent the keyboard from being able to

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.580 
prevent the keyboard from being able to
slip<00:00:35.340> as<00:00:36.340> well<00:00:36.550> as<00:00:36.700> two<00:00:37.289> adjustable<00:00:38.289> height

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:38.590 
slip as well as two adjustable height

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.680 
slip as well as two adjustable height
clips<00:00:38.950> with<00:00:39.489> the<00:00:39.640> rubberized<00:00:39.940> field<00:00:40.360> as<00:00:40.510> well

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:40.690 
clips with the rubberized field as well

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.330 
clips with the rubberized field as well
to<00:00:41.020> just<00:00:41.320> add<00:00:41.500> that<00:00:41.680> little<00:00:41.860> bit<00:00:42.100> of<00:00:42.129> extra

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:42.340 
to just add that little bit of extra

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.290 
to just add that little bit of extra
stability<00:00:44.309> so<00:00:45.309> as<00:00:45.430> you<00:00:45.579> can<00:00:45.670> see<00:00:45.730> here<00:00:46.059> the

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:46.300 
stability so as you can see here the

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.389 
stability so as you can see here the

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.510 
black switches this means actuation

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.389 
black switches this means actuation
required<00:00:52.840> to<00:00:53.140> push<00:00:53.500> down<00:00:53.680> fully<00:00:54.100> on<00:00:54.370> a

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:56.939 
required to push down fully on a
keystroke<00:00:54.820> it's<00:00:55.120> actually<00:00:55.480> a<00:00:55.930> bit<00:00:56.620> harder

00:00:56.939 --> 00:00:56.949 
keystroke it's actually a bit harder

00:00:56.949 --> 00:00:58.439 
keystroke it's actually a bit harder
than<00:00:57.070> when<00:00:57.190> you<00:00:57.309> compare<00:00:57.699> it<00:00:57.730> to<00:00:57.820> Cherry<00:00:58.390> MX

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:00.879 
brown and blues however you don't

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:03.000

actually have to push too far for the

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.500 
actually have to push too far for the
keystroke<00:01:03.460> to<00:01:03.489> be<00:01:03.699> recognized<00:01:04.180> so<00:01:04.360> it's

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:04.510 
keystroke to be recognized so it's

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.180 
keystroke to be recognized so it's
advantageous<00:01:05.080> for<00:01:05.440> gamers<00:01:05.680> who<00:01:05.950> like<00:01:06.160> to

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:06.190 
advantageous for gamers who like to

advantageous for gamers who like to
double<00:01:06.610> tap<00:01:06.820> which<00:01:07.000> bases<00:01:07.420> means<00:01:07.630> to<00:01:07.720> push<00:01:07.869> the

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
double tap which bases means to push the

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.620 
double tap which bases means to push the
button<00:01:08.560> twice<00:01:08.740> in<00:01:09.100> quick<00:01:09.280> succession<00:01:09.540> just<00:01:10.540> to

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
button twice in quick succession just to

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:11.999 
button twice in quick succession just to
give<00:01:10.780> you<00:01:10.840> an<00:01:10.930> idea<00:01:10.990> of<00:01:11.259> the<00:01:11.350> force<00:01:11.590> required

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:12.009 
give you an idea of the force required

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:14.039 
give you an idea of the force required
for<00:01:12.340> keystrokes<00:01:13.150> we<00:01:13.299> recognize<00:01:13.750> that<00:01:13.990> I'm

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:14.049 
for keystrokes we recognize that I'm

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:16.370 
for keystrokes we recognize that I'm
actually<00:01:14.200> pushing<00:01:14.560> the<00:01:14.740> s<00:01:14.950> key<00:01:15.220> now<00:01:15.430> and

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
actually pushing the s key now and

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.929 
actually pushing the s key now and
that's<00:01:17.380> being<00:01:17.680> recognized<00:01:18.220> by<00:01:18.400> the<00:01:18.460> keyboard

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:18.939 
that's being recognized by the keyboard

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:20.700 
that's being recognized by the keyboard
so<00:01:19.119> I'm<00:01:19.360> not<00:01:19.540> fully<00:01:19.900> pushing<00:01:20.290> the<00:01:20.380> key<00:01:20.530> down

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
so I'm not fully pushing the key down

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.649 
so I'm not fully pushing the key down
I'm<00:01:21.009> just<00:01:21.340> giving<00:01:21.579> it<00:01:21.670> a<00:01:21.729> slight<00:01:22.000> tap<00:01:22.360> and

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:22.659 
I'm just giving it a slight tap and

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:24.740 
I'm just giving it a slight tap and
that's<00:01:23.079> all<00:01:23.290> going<00:01:23.560> through<00:01:23.619> onto<00:01:24.250> the<00:01:24.460> screen

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
that's all going through onto the screen

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.090 
that's all going through onto the screen
so<00:01:25.750> this<00:01:25.900> just<00:01:26.079> give<00:01:26.320> you<00:01:26.409> an<00:01:26.470> idea<00:01:26.799> of<00:01:26.890> the

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
so this just give you an idea of the

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.219 
so this just give you an idea of the
audio<00:01:27.460> feedback<00:01:27.759> you<00:01:28.119> get<00:01:28.329> from<00:01:28.390> the<00:01:28.869> Cherry

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
audio feedback you get from the Cherry

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:37.910 
audio feedback you get from the Cherry
MX<00:01:29.290> black<00:01:29.799> switches<00:01:30.100> in<00:01:30.369> the<00:01:30.490> Majestic<00:01:31.210> to

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.470 

so<00:01:38.920> you<00:01:38.980> can<00:01:39.460> see<00:01:39.610> that<00:01:39.760> it's<00:01:39.910> quite<00:01:40.150> a<00:01:40.270> bit

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:40.480 
so you can see that it's quite a bit

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.320 
so you can see that it's quite a bit
quieter<00:01:41.080> than<00:01:41.350> the<00:01:42.250> Train<00:01:42.760> MX<00:01:43.030> brown<00:01:43.300> switches

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.330 
quieter than the Train MX brown switches

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.050 
quieter than the Train MX brown switches
that<00:01:43.900> I<00:01:43.990> looked<00:01:44.200> at<00:01:44.350> before<00:01:44.670> however<00:01:45.670> as<00:01:46.030> I

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
that I looked at before however as I

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.360 
that I looked at before however as I
mentioned<00:01:46.260> you<00:01:47.260> probably<00:01:47.800> don't<00:01:48.040> want<00:01:48.190> to<00:01:48.250> use

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:48.370 
mentioned you probably don't want to use

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:50.340 
mentioned you probably don't want to use
this<00:01:48.520> as<00:01:48.729> a<00:01:48.820> pure<00:01:49.060> typing<00:01:49.510> keyboard<00:01:49.720> as<00:01:50.140> you

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
this as a pure typing keyboard as you

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.950 
this as a pure typing keyboard as you
can<00:01:50.880> find<00:01:51.880> that<00:01:52.120> your<00:01:52.330> hands<00:01:52.660> will<00:01:52.810> get

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
can find that your hands will get

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.680 
can find that your hands will get
fatigued<00:01:53.440> after<00:01:53.830> a<00:01:53.860> while<00:01:54.010> just<00:01:54.280> due<00:01:54.640> to<00:01:54.820> when

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:55.690 
fatigued after a while just due to when
