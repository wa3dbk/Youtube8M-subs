00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
just select that and now it's going to

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:46.510 
just select that and now it's going to
go<00:01:44.810> and<00:01:44.990> utilize<00:01:45.079> pressure<00:01:45.680> sensitivity<00:01:46.159> when

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
go and utilize pressure sensitivity when

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:47.980 
go and utilize pressure sensitivity when
we<00:01:46.609> make<00:01:46.820> this<00:01:46.939> adjustment<00:01:47.450> so<00:01:47.539> let's<00:01:47.689> zoom<00:01:47.750> in

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
we make this adjustment so let's zoom in

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.950 
we make this adjustment so let's zoom in
on<00:01:48.020> the<00:01:48.140> image<00:01:48.170> a<00:01:48.350> little<00:01:48.380> bit<00:01:48.530> more<00:01:48.859> now<00:01:49.960> when

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
on the image a little bit more now when

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.499 
on the image a little bit more now when
it<00:01:51.079> is<00:01:51.109> using<00:01:51.740> pressure<00:01:51.950> sensitive

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:52.509 
it is using pressure sensitive

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:54.819 
it is using pressure sensitive
sensitivity<00:01:53.509> for<00:01:53.810> this<00:01:53.990> feature<00:01:54.259> it<00:01:54.590> is

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:54.829 
sensitivity for this feature it is

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:57.370 
sensitivity for this feature it is
actually<00:01:55.130> adjusting<00:01:55.549> the<00:01:55.820> size<00:01:56.060> so<00:01:56.990> if<00:01:57.109> I<00:01:57.200> go

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
actually adjusting the size so if I go

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:58.899 
actually adjusting the size so if I go
over<00:01:57.500> here<00:01:57.679> and<00:01:57.740> start<00:01:58.159> in<00:01:58.250> this<00:01:58.369> power<00:01:58.579> line

over here and start in this power line

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:00.190 
over here and start in this power line
let's<00:01:59.179> start<00:01:59.450> in<00:01:59.509> the<00:01:59.570> middle<00:01:59.750> here<00:01:59.960> and<00:01:59.990> just

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
let's start in the middle here and just

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.899 
let's start in the middle here and just
click<00:02:00.380> and<00:02:00.619> I'm<00:02:00.710> holding<00:02:01.039> pressing<00:02:01.729> very

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
click and I'm holding pressing very

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:03.580 
click and I'm holding pressing very
lightly<00:02:02.329> and<00:02:02.689> you'll<00:02:02.780> see<00:02:02.960> that<00:02:03.109> the<00:02:03.229> radius

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
lightly and you'll see that the radius

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.230 
lightly and you'll see that the radius
of<00:02:03.710> the<00:02:03.770> brush<00:02:03.979> is<00:02:04.100> very<00:02:04.159> small<00:02:04.640> if<00:02:04.820> I<00:02:04.939> release

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
of the brush is very small if I release

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.539 
of the brush is very small if I release
it<00:02:05.270> cleans<00:02:05.659> it<00:02:05.780> up<00:02:05.840> rather<00:02:06.049> nicely<00:02:06.490> but<00:02:07.490> I'm

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:07.549 
it cleans it up rather nicely but I'm

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:09.249 
it cleans it up rather nicely but I'm
just<00:02:07.609> going<00:02:07.789> to<00:02:07.820> drag<00:02:08.420> over<00:02:08.600> here<00:02:08.929> and<00:02:09.050> as<00:02:09.140> I

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
just going to drag over here and as I

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.140 
just going to drag over here and as I
get<00:02:09.320> closer<00:02:09.740> to<00:02:09.890> the<00:02:10.100> pole<00:02:10.310> I'm<00:02:10.580> going<00:02:10.970> to

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
get closer to the pole I'm going to

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.240 
get closer to the pole I'm going to
press<00:02:11.930> harder<00:02:12.350> and<00:02:12.530> you'll<00:02:12.620> notice<00:02:12.770> the<00:02:12.950> brush

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
press harder and you'll notice the brush

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.460 
press harder and you'll notice the brush
itself<00:02:13.790> gets<00:02:14.030> a<00:02:14.090> little<00:02:14.210> bit<00:02:14.360> harder<00:02:14.690> and<00:02:15.290> I

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
itself gets a little bit harder and I

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:16.600 
itself gets a little bit harder and I
can<00:02:15.620> go<00:02:15.709> over<00:02:15.739> here<00:02:16.010> and<00:02:16.069> make<00:02:16.190> some<00:02:16.459> subtle

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
can go over here and make some subtle

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.070 
can go over here and make some subtle
adjustments<00:02:17.269> just<00:02:17.300> to<00:02:17.480> take<00:02:17.659> care<00:02:17.870> of<00:02:17.930> any

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
adjustments just to take care of any

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.380 
adjustments just to take care of any
little<00:02:18.409> elements

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
little elements

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:20.880 
little elements
the<00:02:19.750> poll<00:02:19.960> here<00:02:20.290> is<00:02:20.380> a<00:02:20.410> little<00:02:20.530> bit<00:02:20.620> bigger

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
the poll here is a little bit bigger

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.200 
the poll here is a little bit bigger
than<00:02:21.100> the<00:02:21.220> wire<00:02:21.430> so<00:02:21.700> I'm<00:02:21.760> obviously<00:02:21.910> going<00:02:22.150> to

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.210 
than the wire so I'm obviously going to

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:23.720 
than the wire so I'm obviously going to
need<00:02:22.270> to<00:02:22.390> press<00:02:22.690> down<00:02:22.720> a<00:02:22.960> little<00:02:23.020> bit<00:02:23.290> harder

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
need to press down a little bit harder

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.700 
need to press down a little bit harder
but<00:02:24.730> the<00:02:24.850> advantage<00:02:25.210> here<00:02:25.450> is<00:02:25.570> the<00:02:25.780> time<00:02:26.200> that

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:26.710 
but the advantage here is the time that

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.440 
but the advantage here is the time that
you're<00:02:26.950> saving<00:02:27.490> you<00:02:27.670> can<00:02:27.790> go<00:02:27.910> over<00:02:28.060> here<00:02:28.090> and

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
you're saving you can go over here and

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
all these settings you would normally

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.010 
all these settings you would normally
change<00:02:30.520> the<00:02:31.000> brush<00:02:31.300> size<00:02:31.540> with<00:02:31.870> their

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
change the brush size with their

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.690 
change the brush size with their
keyboard<00:02:32.890> shortcut<00:02:33.190> or<00:02:33.220> something<00:02:33.460> like<00:02:33.550> that

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
keyboard shortcut or something like that

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.100 
keyboard shortcut or something like that
you're<00:02:34.180> saving<00:02:34.450> a<00:02:34.570> tremendous<00:02:34.690> amount<00:02:35.080> of

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
you're saving a tremendous amount of

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.220 
you're saving a tremendous amount of
time<00:02:35.350> just<00:02:35.380> by<00:02:35.860> merely<00:02:36.330> pressing<00:02:37.330> hard<00:02:37.930> or

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
cleanly removed and looks very good all

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.500 
cleanly removed and looks very good all
right<00:03:13.840> so<00:03:14.500> that's<00:03:14.890> using<00:03:15.130> of<00:03:15.550> course<00:03:15.580> the<00:03:16.150> Spot

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
right so that's using of course the Spot

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.120 
right so that's using of course the Spot
Healing<00:03:16.540> Brush<00:03:16.900> now<00:03:17.380> let's<00:03:17.650> take<00:03:17.800> a<00:03:17.830> look<00:03:18.040> at

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
Healing Brush now let's take a look at

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.570 
Healing Brush now let's take a look at
some<00:03:18.280> other<00:03:18.430> enhancements<00:03:19.060> let's<00:03:19.450> go<00:03:19.630> and<00:03:19.900> do

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
some other enhancements let's go and do

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.690 
some other enhancements let's go and do
perhaps<00:03:21.580> a<00:03:21.760> level<00:03:22.530> an<00:03:23.530> adjustment<00:03:24.130> level<00:03:24.459> here

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
perhaps a level an adjustment level here

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.550 
perhaps a level an adjustment level here
go<00:03:25.690> over<00:03:25.810> here<00:03:25.900> and<00:03:25.959> do<00:03:26.080> an<00:03:26.170> adjustment<00:03:26.410> layer

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
go over here and do an adjustment layer

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.850 
go over here and do an adjustment layer
will<00:03:26.799> do<00:03:26.920> levels<00:03:27.310> and<00:03:27.610> perhaps<00:03:28.060> even<00:03:28.860> increase

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
will do levels and perhaps even increase

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.030 
will do levels and perhaps even increase
the<00:03:29.890> contrast<00:03:30.730> here<00:03:30.820> a<00:03:30.970> little<00:03:31.090> bit<00:03:31.860> now<00:03:32.860> if<00:03:32.980> I

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
the contrast here a little bit now if I

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.470 
the contrast here a little bit now if I
wanted<00:03:33.280> this<00:03:33.340> to<00:03:33.459> be<00:03:33.580> more<00:03:33.730> of<00:03:33.790> a<00:03:34.000> vignette

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
wanted this to be more of a vignette

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.420 
wanted this to be more of a vignette
then<00:03:35.350> I<00:03:35.380> would<00:03:35.799> just<00:03:35.920> go<00:03:36.070> over<00:03:36.130> here<00:03:36.220> and

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
then I would just go over here and

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:37.590 
then I would just go over here and
you'll<00:03:36.580> notice<00:03:36.760> on<00:03:36.970> the<00:03:37.120> adjustment<00:03:37.480> layer

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
you'll notice on the adjustment layer

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.500 
you'll notice on the adjustment layer
that<00:03:37.989> it<00:03:38.110> already<00:03:38.500> creates<00:03:38.860> a<00:03:39.010> layer<00:03:39.340> mask<00:03:39.670> so

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
that it already creates a layer mask so

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.110 
that it already creates a layer mask so
let's<00:03:40.660> go<00:03:40.780> and<00:03:40.900> grab<00:03:40.989> the<00:03:41.230> brush<00:03:41.440> tool<00:03:41.739> and<00:03:42.489> I'm

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
let's go and grab the brush tool and I'm

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.120 
let's go and grab the brush tool and I'm
going<00:03:43.209> to<00:03:43.299> get<00:03:43.420> a<00:03:43.450> nice<00:03:43.810> soft<00:03:44.320> edge<00:03:44.590> brush<00:03:44.860> here

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
going to get a nice soft edge brush here

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.800 
going to get a nice soft edge brush here
let's<00:03:45.310> increase<00:03:45.640> the<00:03:45.820> size<00:03:46.030> considerably<00:03:46.930> and

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
let's increase the size considerably and

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.479 
let's increase the size considerably and
painting<00:03:49.810> with<00:03:50.140> black<00:03:50.709> because<00:03:51.130> I<00:03:51.190> want<00:03:51.400> to

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
painting with black because I want to

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:54.030 
painting with black because I want to
actually<00:03:51.610> remove<00:03:52.150> that<00:03:52.630> adjustment<00:03:53.019> but<00:03:53.950> I'm

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
actually remove that adjustment but I'm

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.350 
actually remove that adjustment but I'm
also<00:03:54.190> going<00:03:54.459> to<00:03:54.549> go<00:03:54.700> over<00:03:54.790> here<00:03:54.910> into<00:03:55.269> the

it gets closer to the edge it'll get

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:18.690 
it gets closer to the edge it'll get
considerably<00:04:16.750> darker<00:04:17.019> thus<00:04:17.919> giving<00:04:18.340> us<00:04:18.489> that

considerably maybe increase the radius a

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.490 
considerably maybe increase the radius a
little<00:04:56.669> bit<00:04:57.000> now<00:04:57.630> if<00:04:57.720> i<00:04:57.780> zoom<00:04:57.810> in<00:04:58.139> here<00:04:58.440> we

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
little bit now if i zoom in here we

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.320 
little bit now if i zoom in here we
uncheck<00:04:58.919> that<00:04:59.699> you'll<00:04:59.970> notice<00:05:00.240> the

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
uncheck that you'll notice the

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.890 
uncheck that you'll notice the
sharpening<00:05:00.660> looks<00:05:00.840> pretty<00:05:01.289> good<00:05:01.530> however

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:02.900 
sharpening looks pretty good however

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.719 
sharpening looks pretty good however
it's<00:05:03.900> sharp<00:05:04.470> in<00:05:04.680> some<00:05:04.889> areas<00:05:05.190> I<00:05:05.280> want<00:05:05.490> and

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:05.729 
it's sharp in some areas I want and

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:07.879 
it's sharp in some areas I want and
sharpen<00:05:06.270> some<00:05:06.389> areas<00:05:06.750> I<00:05:06.870> don't<00:05:06.900> want<00:05:07.500> it<00:05:07.650> to<00:05:07.740> be

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:07.889 
sharpen some areas I don't want it to be

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:10.189 
sharpen some areas I don't want it to be
so<00:05:08.699> here's<00:05:08.880> we're<00:05:09.000> gonna<00:05:09.090> do<00:05:09.240> an<00:05:09.570> option<00:05:09.990> click

00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:10.199 
so here's we're gonna do an option click

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:11.810 
so here's we're gonna do an option click
on<00:05:10.350> that<00:05:10.530> layer<00:05:10.740> mask<00:05:11.010> icon<00:05:11.220> at<00:05:11.520> the<00:05:11.550> bottom<00:05:11.760> of

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:11.820 
on that layer mask icon at the bottom of

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:13.219 
on that layer mask icon at the bottom of
the<00:05:11.880> layers<00:05:12.090> panel<00:05:12.330> and<00:05:12.539> that's<00:05:12.720> going<00:05:12.930> to<00:05:13.020> add

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:13.229 
the layers panel and that's going to add

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:15.950 
the layers panel and that's going to add
a<00:05:13.650> hide<00:05:14.160> all<00:05:14.550> layer<00:05:15.060> mask<00:05:15.389> meaning<00:05:15.840> it's

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 
a hide all layer mask meaning it's

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.830 
a hide all layer mask meaning it's
filled<00:05:16.199> with<00:05:16.260> Hwa<00:05:16.500> fill<00:05:17.070> with<00:05:17.190> black<00:05:17.400> rather

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 
filled with Hwa fill with black rather

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:19.760 
filled with Hwa fill with black rather
I'm<00:05:18.840> going<00:05:19.050> to<00:05:19.110> set<00:05:19.260> white<00:05:19.500> is<00:05:19.620> my<00:05:19.740> foreground

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
I'm going to set white is my foreground

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:22.100 
I'm going to set white is my foreground
color<00:05:20.370> and<00:05:20.550> again<00:05:21.180> I'm<00:05:21.389> using<00:05:21.419> that<00:05:21.780> same

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.110 
color and again I'm using that same

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:23.719 
color and again I'm using that same
brush<00:05:22.380> I<00:05:22.530> did<00:05:22.680> a<00:05:22.710> moment<00:05:22.889> ago<00:05:23.099> it's<00:05:23.430> got<00:05:23.610> the

00:05:23.719 --> 00:05:23.729 
brush I did a moment ago it's got the

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:27.290 
brush I did a moment ago it's got the
transfer<00:05:24.120> the<00:05:24.870> opacity<00:05:25.169> jitter<00:05:25.889> and<00:05:26.270> flow<00:05:27.270> are

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.300 
transfer the opacity jitter and flow are

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.110 
transfer the opacity jitter and flow are
both<00:05:27.690> set<00:05:27.930> to<00:05:27.960> pen<00:05:28.199> pressure<00:05:28.410> and<00:05:28.729> if<00:05:29.729> I<00:05:29.820> go<00:05:29.940> in

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 
both set to pen pressure and if I go in

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.830 
both set to pen pressure and if I go in
here<00:05:30.330> and<00:05:30.479> just<00:05:30.539> zoom<00:05:31.440> in<00:05:31.680> and<00:05:32.479> look<00:05:33.479> for<00:05:33.509> areas

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:33.840 
here and just zoom in and look for areas

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.629 
here and just zoom in and look for areas
that<00:05:34.020> I<00:05:34.199> don't<00:05:34.410> necessarily<00:05:34.560> want<00:05:35.190> to<00:05:35.250> be<00:05:35.430> that

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:35.639 
that I don't necessarily want to be that

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:38.120 
that I don't necessarily want to be that
sharp<00:05:35.970> perhaps<00:05:36.419> areas<00:05:36.810> really<00:05:37.590> far<00:05:37.830> back<00:05:38.010> in

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:38.130 
sharp perhaps areas really far back in

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:43.279 
sharp perhaps areas really far back in
the<00:05:38.160> background<00:05:38.580> here<00:05:41.810> when<00:05:42.810> we're<00:05:43.020> revealing

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:43.289 
the background here when we're revealing

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:44.960 
the background here when we're revealing
so<00:05:43.590> I<00:05:43.620> want<00:05:43.800> to<00:05:43.889> see<00:05:44.039> the<00:05:44.190> sharper<00:05:44.490> areas<00:05:44.789> so<00:05:44.940> I

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:44.970 
so I want to see the sharper areas so I

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:46.640 
so I want to see the sharper areas so I
want<00:05:45.210> to<00:05:45.240> have<00:05:45.419> the<00:05:45.599> sharper<00:05:45.990> area<00:05:46.199> boats<00:05:46.470> I'm

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:46.650 
want to have the sharper area boats I'm

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:48.020 
want to have the sharper area boats I'm
painting<00:05:46.979> with<00:05:47.099> white<00:05:47.340> on<00:05:47.639> the<00:05:47.849> layer<00:05:48.000> mask

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:48.030 
painting with white on the layer mask

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:51.680 
painting with white on the layer mask
there<00:05:48.659> we<00:05:48.810> go<00:05:48.979> and<00:05:50.060> I'm<00:05:51.060> bringing<00:05:51.300> in<00:05:51.570> the

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:51.690 
there we go and I'm bringing in the

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:54.230 
there we go and I'm bringing in the
detail<00:05:52.080> only<00:05:52.289> in<00:05:52.620> areas<00:05:52.860> I<00:05:53.159> want<00:05:53.550> it<00:05:53.699> to<00:05:53.849> be<00:05:54.030> and

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:54.240 
detail only in areas I want it to be and

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.149 
detail only in areas I want it to be and
it's<00:05:54.360> very<00:05:54.630> subtle<00:05:54.960> that's<00:05:55.770> a<00:05:55.830> great<00:05:56.010> thing

00:05:56.149 --> 00:05:56.159 
it's very subtle that's a great thing

00:05:56.159 --> 00:05:57.500 
it's very subtle that's a great thing
about<00:05:56.280> pressure<00:05:56.550> sensitivity<00:05:57.000> is<00:05:57.270> that<00:05:57.389> you

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:57.510 
about pressure sensitivity is that you

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:58.850 
about pressure sensitivity is that you
can<00:05:57.630> make<00:05:57.840> these<00:05:58.199> kind<00:05:58.470> of<00:05:58.560> subtle

00:05:58.850 --> 00:05:58.860 
can make these kind of subtle

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:00.409 
can make these kind of subtle
adjustments<00:05:59.430> without<00:05:59.699> pressure<00:05:59.909> sensitivity

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:00.419 
adjustments without pressure sensitivity

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:01.610 
adjustments without pressure sensitivity
it<00:06:00.659> would<00:06:00.750> just<00:06:00.900> be<00:06:01.020> one<00:06:01.199> or<00:06:01.320> the<00:06:01.380> other<00:06:01.530> you

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:01.620 
it would just be one or the other you

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:02.899 
it would just be one or the other you
would<00:06:01.800> have<00:06:01.949> to<00:06:02.070> choose<00:06:02.280> a<00:06:02.310> setting<00:06:02.610> and<00:06:02.820> then

00:06:02.899 --> 00:06:02.909 
would have to choose a setting and then

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:04.580 
would have to choose a setting and then
that<00:06:03.060> would<00:06:03.180> be<00:06:03.300> it<00:06:03.479> but<00:06:03.720> with<00:06:04.349> pressure

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:04.590 
that would be it but with pressure

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:06.950 
that would be it but with pressure
sensitivity<00:06:05.070> you<00:06:05.340> can<00:06:05.490> vary<00:06:06.030> the<00:06:06.840> intensity

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 
sensitivity you can vary the intensity

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.560 
sensitivity you can vary the intensity
as<00:06:07.590> you<00:06:08.010> paint<00:06:08.370> just<00:06:08.789> by<00:06:09.000> how<00:06:09.150> hard<00:06:09.360> or<00:06:09.539> how

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:09.570 
as you paint just by how hard or how

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:12.110 
as you paint just by how hard or how
soft<00:06:09.900> you<00:06:10.020> press<00:06:10.229> on<00:06:10.409> the<00:06:10.470> tablet<00:06:10.949> and<00:06:11.120> this

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:12.120 
soft you press on the tablet and this

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.779 
soft you press on the tablet and this
again<00:06:12.599> is<00:06:13.010> very<00:06:14.010> handy<00:06:14.430> when<00:06:14.639> you're

00:06:14.779 --> 00:06:14.789 
again is very handy when you're

00:06:14.789 --> 00:06:16.909 
again is very handy when you're
modifying<00:06:15.120> and<00:06:15.510> adjusting<00:06:15.990> landscape<00:06:16.530> images

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:16.919

like<00:06:17.070> this<00:06:17.250> again<00:06:17.729> remember<00:06:18.240> the<00:06:18.510> various

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:18.900 
like this again remember the various

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:20.390 
like this again remember the various
tools<00:06:19.169> that<00:06:19.289> utilize<00:06:19.650> pressure<00:06:19.889> sensitivity

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:20.400 
tools that utilize pressure sensitivity

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.060 
tools that utilize pressure sensitivity
not<00:06:20.820> just<00:06:21.090> the<00:06:21.180> brush<00:06:21.419> but<00:06:22.080> also<00:06:22.470> the<00:06:22.680> various
