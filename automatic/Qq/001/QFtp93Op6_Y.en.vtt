00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.680 
storage how do you take the cold storage
out<00:03:56.560> of<00:03:56.920> the<00:03:57.069> expensive<00:03:57.670> tears<00:03:57.940> and<00:03:58.209> put<00:03:58.480> it<00:03:58.599> in

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
out of the expensive tears and put it in

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.890 
out of the expensive tears and put it in
lower-cost<00:03:59.260> tears<00:03:59.849> we've<00:04:00.849> implemented<00:04:01.209> Auto

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
lower-cost tears we've implemented Auto

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079 
the cold data knows where to go as well

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:22.650 
the cold data knows where to go as well
so<00:04:20.799> you<00:04:20.859> know<00:04:21.130> our<00:04:21.280> industry<00:04:21.760> is<00:04:21.789> really<00:04:22.120> at<00:04:22.450> an
