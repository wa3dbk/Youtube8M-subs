00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.730 
up a bit of fruit and and cut it with a
knife<00:02:03.759> so<00:02:04.209> that's<00:02:04.599> where<00:02:04.749> that<00:02:04.869> came<00:02:05.079> from<00:02:05.109> the

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
knife so that's where that came from the

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.219 
knife so that's where that came from the
games<00:02:05.950> community<00:02:06.520> in<00:02:06.819> in<00:02:07.179> Brisbane<00:02:07.869> and<00:02:07.959> and

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
games community in in Brisbane and and

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.830 
games community in in Brisbane and and
Queensland<00:02:08.679> I<00:02:08.800> guess<00:02:09.009> has<00:02:09.910> always<00:02:10.090> been<00:02:10.420> a

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
Queensland I guess has always been a

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.410 
Queensland I guess has always been a
really<00:02:11.230> tight-knit<00:02:12.099> community<00:02:12.790> initially

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
really tight-knit community initially

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.570 
really tight-knit community initially
the<00:02:13.570> the<00:02:13.840> Queensland<00:02:14.620> government<00:02:15.010> spent<00:02:15.430> a

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
the the Queensland government spent a

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.250 
the the Queensland government spent a
lot<00:02:15.820> of

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
lot of

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.170 
lot of
time<00:02:17.409> and<00:02:17.709> effort<00:02:18.370> in<00:02:18.549> bringing<00:02:18.819> people

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
time and effort in bringing people

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.240 
time and effort in bringing people
together<00:02:19.420> and<00:02:20.170> that's<00:02:20.319> really<00:02:20.650> continued<00:02:21.099> on

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
together and that's really continued on

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.520 
together and that's really continued on
I<00:02:21.519> think<00:02:22.180> what's<00:02:22.569> happened<00:02:22.959> in<00:02:23.019> the<00:02:23.140> last<00:02:23.170> two

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
I think what's happened in the last two

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.470 
I think what's happened in the last two
years<00:02:23.709> is<00:02:24.099> that<00:02:24.129> a<00:02:24.640> lot<00:02:24.909> of<00:02:24.939> the<00:02:25.150> bigger

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
years is that a lot of the bigger

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.140 
years is that a lot of the bigger
companies<00:02:25.959> that<00:02:26.500> have<00:02:26.620> shut<00:02:26.829> down<00:02:26.860> have<00:02:27.670> given

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
companies that have shut down have given

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.819 
companies that have shut down have given
way<00:02:28.269> to<00:02:28.299> a<00:02:28.510> lot<00:02:28.720> of<00:02:28.750> smaller<00:02:29.170> independent

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:29.829 
way to a lot of smaller independent

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:32.009 
way to a lot of smaller independent
companies<00:02:30.489> they've<00:02:30.819> sprung<00:02:31.120> up<00:02:31.329> and<00:02:31.569> in<00:02:31.840> the

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:32.019 
companies they've sprung up and in the

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:34.649 
companies they've sprung up and in the
community<00:02:32.470> in<00:02:33.069> the<00:02:33.280> indie<00:02:33.489> scene<00:02:33.519> is<00:02:33.909> so

00:02:34.649 --> 00:02:34.659 
community in the indie scene is so

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:37.800 
community in the indie scene is so
strong<00:02:34.989> I<00:02:35.260> think<00:02:35.890> in<00:02:36.010> terms<00:02:36.250> of<00:02:36.810> technology

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
strong I think in terms of technology

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.930 
strong I think in terms of technology
the<00:02:38.019> the<00:02:38.049> most<00:02:38.650> insight<00:02:39.010> exciting<00:02:39.610> thing<00:02:39.819> in

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
the the most insight exciting thing in

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.360 
the the most insight exciting thing in
the<00:02:39.970> game<00:02:40.180> space<00:02:40.510> now<00:02:40.810> is<00:02:41.079> how<00:02:41.409> easy<00:02:41.709> it<00:02:41.980> is<00:02:42.129> for

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
the game space now is how easy it is for

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.099 
the game space now is how easy it is for
people<00:02:42.790> to<00:02:42.970> get<00:02:43.150> access<00:02:43.329> to<00:02:43.720> really<00:02:43.989> good

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:44.109 
people to get access to really good

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:46.050 
people to get access to really good
