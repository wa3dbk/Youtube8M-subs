00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
few moments here I'm going to be adding

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:14.780 
few moments here I'm going to be adding
flaps<00:03:07.950> to<00:03:08.280> 20<00:03:08.610> degrees<00:03:08.970> to<00:03:09.000> slow<00:03:09.420> my<00:03:09.630> airspeed

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
parallel with the runway I'm using that

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:22.009 
parallel with the runway I'm using that
road<00:03:19.500> up<00:03:19.709> ahead<00:03:19.860> as<00:03:20.220> a<00:03:20.250> reference<00:03:21.060> point<00:03:21.150> and

road up ahead as a reference point and

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:23.539 
road up ahead as a reference point and
I'll<00:03:22.230> notice<00:03:22.590> here<00:03:22.799> shortly<00:03:23.159> that<00:03:23.430> I'm

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
I'll notice here shortly that I'm

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:25.009 
I'll notice here shortly that I'm
actually<00:03:23.760> drifting<00:03:24.420> to<00:03:24.540> the<00:03:24.599> left<00:03:24.870> a<00:03:24.989> little

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
actually drifting to the left a little

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:27.470 
actually drifting to the left a little
bit<00:03:25.319> too<00:03:25.500> much<00:03:25.709> so<00:03:26.040> I'll<00:03:26.610> y'all<00:03:26.879> to<00:03:27.120> the<00:03:27.239> right

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
bit too much so I'll y'all to the right

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.860 
bit too much so I'll y'all to the right
I<00:03:27.810> got<00:03:28.470> to<00:03:28.680> the<00:03:28.799> right<00:03:29.010> and<00:03:29.540> correct<00:03:30.540> for<00:03:30.629> that

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
I got to the right and correct for that

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.600 
I got to the right and correct for that
there's<00:03:31.110> the<00:03:31.290> little<00:03:31.560> there's<00:03:32.010> a<00:03:32.099> little<00:03:32.370> turn

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
there's the little there's a little turn

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.479 
there's the little there's a little turn
towards<00:03:33.030> the<00:03:33.150> wind<00:03:33.500> it's<00:03:34.500> pretty<00:03:34.829> gusty<00:03:35.069> I'm

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
towards the wind it's pretty gusty I'm

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:42.410 
towards the wind it's pretty gusty I'm
bouncing<00:03:35.940> around<00:03:36.060> a<00:03:36.750> decent<00:03:37.349> amount

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.080 

pretty<00:03:43.080> soon<00:03:43.290> and<00:03:43.800> I'm<00:03:43.920> moving<00:03:44.400> right<00:03:44.670> along

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
pretty soon and I'm moving right along

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.880 
pretty soon and I'm moving right along
on<00:03:45.420> downwind<00:03:45.930> a<00:03:45.990> lot<00:03:46.140> faster<00:03:46.590> than<00:03:46.709> I<00:03:46.830> normally

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
on downwind a lot faster than I normally

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.760 
on downwind a lot faster than I normally
would<00:03:47.370> because<00:03:47.520> I<00:03:47.700> have<00:03:47.790> that<00:03:47.940> strong<00:03:48.270> tail

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:48.770 
would because I have that strong tail

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:51.229 
would because I have that strong tail

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
part of the video gets cut out here

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:55.520 
part of the video gets cut out here
shortly<00:03:51.660> unfortunately<00:03:53.900> so<00:03:54.900> I<00:03:54.930> am<00:03:55.140> on<00:03:55.319> down

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
shortly unfortunately so I am on down

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.120 
shortly unfortunately so I am on down
and<00:03:55.830> I'm<00:03:56.010> about<00:03:56.220> to<00:03:56.430> turn<00:03:56.670> what's<00:03:57.030> called<00:03:57.300> base

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130 
and I'm about to turn what's called base

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.920 
and I'm about to turn what's called base
so<00:03:59.130> I'll<00:03:59.220> call<00:03:59.400> out<00:03:59.580> my<00:03:59.730> position<00:04:00.270> on<00:04:00.780> the

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
so I'll call out my position on the

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.740 
so I'll call out my position on the
radio

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.780 

we<00:04:06.080> turning<00:04:06.350> left<00:04:06.590> momentarily<00:04:07.250> here<00:04:07.520> we<00:04:07.670> go

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
we turning left momentarily here we go

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.660 
we turning left momentarily here we go
we're<00:04:08.030> starting<00:04:08.420> the<00:04:08.570> left<00:04:08.780> turn<00:04:09.050> it's<00:04:10.040> the

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
we're starting the left turn it's the

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:12.310 
we're starting the left turn it's the
winds<00:04:10.880> going<00:04:11.030> to<00:04:11.120> blow<00:04:11.300> me<00:04:11.480> very<00:04:11.750> very<00:04:11.840> quickly

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:12.320 
winds going to blow me very very quickly

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.470 
winds going to blow me very very quickly
towards<00:04:12.860> the<00:04:12.980> runway<00:04:13.370> so<00:04:14.000> it's<00:04:14.210> a<00:04:14.300> rather

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
towards the runway so it's a rather

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.470 
towards the runway so it's a rather
steep<00:04:14.990> turn<00:04:15.370> now<00:04:16.370> what<00:04:16.640> I<00:04:16.670> what<00:04:17.030> I'm<00:04:17.180> doing

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:17.480 
steep turn now what I what I'm doing

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.320 
steep turn now what I what I'm doing
here<00:04:17.780> is<00:04:17.930> I'm<00:04:18.410> actually<00:04:18.440> turning<00:04:19.239> towards<00:04:20.239> the

here is I'm actually turning towards the
runway<00:04:20.750> and<00:04:21.049> I'm<00:04:21.200> going<00:04:21.380> to<00:04:21.410> let<00:04:21.799> the<00:04:21.980> wind

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
runway and I'm going to let the wind

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.300 
runway and I'm going to let the wind
actually<00:04:22.960> blow<00:04:23.960> me<00:04:24.200> towards<00:04:24.680> the<00:04:24.770> runway<00:04:24.980> now

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
actually blow me towards the runway now

you look carefully I'm actually drifting

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:34.090 
you look carefully I'm actually drifting
very<00:04:32.150> very<00:04:32.450> fast<00:04:32.780> to<00:04:33.170> the<00:04:33.350> right<00:04:33.530> towards<00:04:34.040> the

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100 
very very fast to the right towards the

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.010 
very very fast to the right towards the
runway<00:04:34.280> which<00:04:34.970> is<00:04:35.120> what<00:04:35.330> I<00:04:35.360> want<00:04:35.660> I<00:04:35.780> want<00:04:35.930> to

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020 
runway which is what I want I want to

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.530 
runway which is what I want I want to
line<00:04:36.170> up<00:04:36.320> with<00:04:36.350> the<00:04:36.530> runway<00:04:37.000> okay<00:04:38.000> so<00:04:38.060> now<00:04:38.420> I'm

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:38.540 
line up with the runway okay so now I'm

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.020 
line up with the runway okay so now I'm
closer<00:04:38.810> I'm<00:04:39.080> still<00:04:39.380> I'm<00:04:39.680> still<00:04:39.880> drifting<00:04:40.880> into

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
closer I'm still I'm still drifting into

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.720 
closer I'm still I'm still drifting into
the<00:04:41.150> runway<00:04:41.570> and<00:04:41.630> lining<00:04:42.020> up<00:04:42.140> now<00:04:42.830> notice<00:04:43.580> how

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:43.730 
the runway and lining up now notice how

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:46.000 
the runway and lining up now notice how
far<00:04:44.090> left<00:04:44.420> to<00:04:44.600> the<00:04:44.720> nose<00:04:44.930> my<00:04:45.230> camera<00:04:45.950> is

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.010 
far left to the nose my camera is

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:48.690 
far left to the nose my camera is
pointing<00:04:46.340> straight<00:04:46.370> ahead<00:04:46.790> that<00:04:47.240> nose<00:04:47.650> is

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:48.700 
pointing straight ahead that nose is

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.880 
pointing straight ahead that nose is
point<00:04:49.700> about<00:04:49.910> 20<00:04:50.390> degrees<00:04:50.510> to<00:04:50.750> the<00:04:51.140> left<00:04:51.170> just

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:51.890 
point about 20 degrees to the left just

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:55.350 
point about 20 degrees to the left just
to<00:04:52.130> stay<00:04:52.400> right<00:04:53.020> parallel<00:04:54.020> with<00:04:54.410> the

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 
to stay right parallel with the

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:00.010 
to stay right parallel with the
go<00:04:56.360> in<00:04:56.540> here<00:04:58.030> the<00:04:59.030> Vasi<00:04:59.450> lights<00:04:59.660> are<00:04:59.840> on<00:04:59.930> the

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
go in here the Vasi lights are on the

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.540 
go in here the Vasi lights are on the
left<00:05:00.260> there's<00:05:00.560> a<00:05:00.620> red<00:05:00.890> light<00:05:01.130> there<00:05:01.340> was<00:05:01.520> a

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
left there's a red light there was a

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.130 
left there's a red light there was a
white<00:05:01.820> light<00:05:02.060> if<00:05:02.240> you<00:05:02.360> reverse<00:05:02.660> the<00:05:02.720> video

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:03.140 
white light if you reverse the video

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:05.260 
white light if you reverse the video
you'll<00:05:03.410> see<00:05:03.440> it<00:05:03.710> calls<00:05:04.250> me<00:05:04.430> on<00:05:04.460> my<00:05:04.550> flight<00:05:04.970> slow

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
you'll see it calls me on my flight slow

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.270 
you'll see it calls me on my flight slow
ok<00:05:06.020> I'm<00:05:06.230> going<00:05:06.380> to<00:05:06.470> give<00:05:06.590> right<00:05:06.830> rudder<00:05:07.070> right

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280 
ok I'm going to give right rudder right

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.850 
ok I'm going to give right rudder right
here<00:05:07.690> right<00:05:08.690> when<00:05:08.930> I<00:05:08.960> touch<00:05:09.260> down<00:05:09.470> and<00:05:09.740> give<00:05:09.830> a

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:09.860 
here right when I touch down and give a

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:11.610 
here right when I touch down and give a
right<00:05:10.070> rudder

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 
right rudder

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.770 
right rudder
almost<00:05:12.620> perfect<00:05:13.370> I<00:05:13.400> would<00:05:14.240> consider<00:05:14.540> that

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:14.780 
almost perfect I would consider that

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:19.980 
almost perfect I would consider that
perfect<00:05:15.260> considering<00:05:15.710> a<00:05:15.740> 30-mile<00:05:16.780> Cessna<00:05:17.780> 150

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:19.990 
perfect considering a 30-mile Cessna 150

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:21.810 
perfect considering a 30-mile Cessna 150
now<00:05:20.380> what<00:05:20.530> I'm<00:05:20.650> saying<00:05:20.949> here<00:05:21.190> I'll<00:05:21.580> go<00:05:21.759> ahead

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:21.820 
now what I'm saying here I'll go ahead

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:25.010 
now what I'm saying here I'll go ahead
and<00:05:22.030> talk<00:05:22.180> over<00:05:22.419> because<00:05:22.810> this<00:05:23.440> recording<00:05:23.949> is

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 
and talk over because this recording is

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.439 
and talk over because this recording is
more<00:05:26.020> quality<00:05:26.530> I'm<00:05:27.009> taxing<00:05:27.699> right<00:05:27.940> now<00:05:28.090> my

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:28.449 
more quality I'm taxing right now my

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:30.270 
more quality I'm taxing right now my
airspeed<00:05:28.870> indicator<00:05:29.350> is<00:05:29.530> indicating<00:05:30.100> a

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280 
airspeed indicator is indicating a

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.820 
airspeed indicator is indicating a
little<00:05:30.669> over<00:05:30.850> 40<00:05:31.210> miles<00:05:31.419> an<00:05:31.630> hour<00:05:31.780> but<00:05:32.560> my

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:32.830 
little over 40 miles an hour but my

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:34.860 
little over 40 miles an hour but my
ground<00:05:33.100> speed<00:05:33.370> was<00:05:33.520> about<00:05:33.699> 15<00:05:34.240> miles<00:05:34.509> an<00:05:34.750> hour

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:34.870 
ground speed was about 15 miles an hour

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:37.230 
ground speed was about 15 miles an hour
so<00:05:35.590> essentially<00:05:36.070> if<00:05:36.130> I<00:05:36.220> remove<00:05:36.580> the<00:05:36.699> ailerons

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:37.240 
so essentially if I remove the ailerons

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.749 
so essentially if I remove the ailerons
or<00:05:37.600> the<00:05:37.750> elevator<00:05:38.139> it<00:05:38.770> would<00:05:38.919> respond<00:05:39.400> just

00:05:39.749 --> 00:05:39.759 
or the elevator it would respond just

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:43.080 
or the elevator it would respond just
based<00:05:40.060> on<00:05:40.330> the<00:05:40.539> wind<00:05:40.840> itself<00:05:41.620> not<00:05:41.979> not<00:05:42.820> the

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.090 
based on the wind itself not not the

based on the wind itself not not the
aircraft<00:05:43.990> moving<00:05:44.800> through<00:05:45.610> the<00:05:45.820> air<00:05:46.150> due<00:05:46.720> to

aircraft moving through the air due to
the<00:05:46.990> thrust<00:05:47.620> from<00:05:47.740> the<00:05:47.830> engine<00:05:47.949> look<00:05:48.850> off<00:05:49.060> to

the thrust from the engine look off to

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:51.050 
the thrust from the engine look off to
the<00:05:49.240> right<00:05:49.360> here<00:05:49.780> you'll<00:05:50.289> see<00:05:50.350> the<00:05:50.590> windsock

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.060 
the right here you'll see the windsock

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.610 
the right here you'll see the windsock
there's<00:05:52.060> only<00:05:52.180> wind<00:05:52.389> one<00:05:52.840> wind<00:05:53.080> sock<00:05:53.289> on<00:05:53.500> this

there's only wind one wind sock on this

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.320 
there's only wind one wind sock on this
