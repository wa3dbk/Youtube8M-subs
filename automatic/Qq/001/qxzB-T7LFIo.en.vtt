as a slash trace of 55 and currently
building<00:00:04.380> a<00:00:04.980> ramp<00:00:07.069> this<00:00:08.069> is<00:00:08.220> just<00:00:08.460> what<00:00:08.670> I<00:00:08.700> got

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
building a ramp this is just what I got

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.379 
building a ramp this is just what I got
so<00:00:09.120> far<00:00:09.620> the<00:00:10.620> top<00:00:10.920> beam<00:00:11.250> right<00:00:11.550> here<00:00:11.849> there's

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
so far the top beam right here there's

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.060 
so far the top beam right here there's
not<00:00:12.599> another<00:00:12.809> one<00:00:12.990> under<00:00:13.170> it<00:00:13.380> and<00:00:13.530> I'm

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
not another one under it and I'm

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.460 
not another one under it and I'm
building<00:00:14.460> these<00:00:14.549> beams<00:00:14.880> that<00:00:15.240> go<00:00:15.389> across<00:00:15.480> and

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
building these beams that go across and

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.290 
building these beams that go across and
it's<00:00:17.130> going<00:00:17.220> to<00:00:17.310> hook<00:00:17.460> up<00:00:17.699> to<00:00:17.880> this<00:00:18.000> one<00:00:18.240> and

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
it's going to hook up to this one and

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.470 
it's going to hook up to this one and
I'm<00:00:18.570> going<00:00:18.720> to<00:00:18.750> screw<00:00:19.020> it<00:00:19.109> in<00:00:19.550> I<00:00:20.550> got<00:00:21.119> two<00:00:21.300> more

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
I'm going to screw it in I got two more

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.519 
I'm going to screw it in I got two more
beams<00:00:21.720> to<00:00:21.869> cut<00:00:22.140> and<00:00:23.779> I'm<00:00:24.779> cutting<00:00:25.199> width<00:00:25.350> is

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
beams to cut and I'm cutting width is

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.790 
beams to cut and I'm cutting width is
this<00:00:25.740> all<00:00:26.160> right<00:00:26.369> here<00:00:27.109> just<00:00:28.109> put<00:00:28.349> your<00:00:28.439> finger

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
this all right here just put your finger

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.030 
this all right here just put your finger
on<00:00:28.830> in<00:00:29.130> it<00:00:29.570> vibrates<00:00:30.570> back<00:00:30.779> and<00:00:30.990> forth<00:00:31.199> and

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:34.040 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.630 

just<00:00:35.040> some<00:00:35.190> things<00:00:35.489> i<00:00:35.700> used<00:00:37.040> this<00:00:38.040> flat<00:00:38.370> piece

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
just some things i used this flat piece

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.580 
just some things i used this flat piece
of<00:00:38.670> plywood<00:00:39.000> and<00:00:39.450> i<00:00:39.510> use<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.840> big<00:00:40.050> piece<00:00:40.320> like

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
of plywood and i use the big piece like

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.000 
of plywood and i use the big piece like
this<00:00:40.800> they've<00:00:41.040> got<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.309> beams<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:42.890> this<00:00:43.890> is

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
this they've got the beams and this is

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.619 
this they've got the beams and this is
going<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.250> be<00:00:44.370> exactly<00:00:45.149> parallel<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.960> this

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:47.629 
going to be exactly parallel to this

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:51.439 
going to be exactly parallel to this
ramp<00:00:48.629> right<00:00:48.840> here<00:00:49.640> sitting<00:00:50.640> in<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.879> snow<00:00:51.120> so<00:00:51.390> I

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
ramp right here sitting in the snow so I

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:57.799 
ramp right here sitting in the snow so I
just<00:00:51.690> dug<00:00:51.870> it<00:00:51.989> out<00:00:52.079> to<00:00:52.410> measure<00:00:54.110> and<00:00:56.570> yeah<00:00:57.570> this

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
just dug it out to measure and yeah this

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.250 
just dug it out to measure and yeah this
is<00:00:57.960> just<00:00:58.109> what<00:00:58.260> I<00:00:58.289> got<00:00:58.500> so<00:00:58.680> far<00:00:59.960> tomorrow<00:01:00.960> I'm

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
is just what I got so far tomorrow I'm

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.280 
is just what I got so far tomorrow I'm
hopefully<00:01:01.710> going<00:01:01.829> to<00:01:01.920> get<00:01:02.039> it<00:01:02.129> done<00:01:03.110> I'm<00:01:04.110> not

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
hopefully going to get it done I'm not

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.450 
hopefully going to get it done I'm not
going<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.500> paint<00:01:04.680> it<00:01:04.830> yet<00:01:04.979> but<00:01:05.159> I'm<00:01:05.280> going<00:01:05.339> to

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
going to paint it yet but I'm going to

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.100 
going to paint it yet but I'm going to
get<00:01:05.580> it<00:01:05.670> done<00:01:05.790> and<00:01:06.060> i'll<00:01:06.689> show<00:01:06.810> you<00:01:06.960> the

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
get it done and i'll show you the

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.130 
get it done and i'll show you the
finished<00:01:07.260> product<00:01:08.630> see<00:01:09.630> that's<00:01:09.780> not<00:01:09.930> that

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
finished product see that's not that

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.460 
finished product see that's not that
hard<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.530> do<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:11.490> make<00:01:11.640> a<00:01:11.700> ramp<00:01:12.000> use<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.170> soft

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
hard to do to make a ramp use the soft

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.140 
hard to do to make a ramp use the soft
flat<00:01:14.460> piece<00:01:14.790> some<00:01:15.240> of<00:01:15.330> this<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:15.750> cut<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.020> beams

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
flat piece some of this to cut the beams

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.170 
flat piece some of this to cut the beams
permanent<00:01:18.150> marker<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.840> mark<00:01:19.229> it<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:19.939> the<00:01:20.939> tape

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
permanent marker to mark it and the tape

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.020 
permanent marker to mark it and the tape
measure<00:01:22.159> so<00:01:23.159> yeah<00:01:23.250> I'm<00:01:23.340> making<00:01:23.610> them<00:01:23.700> parallel

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
measure so yeah I'm making them parallel

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.660 
measure so yeah I'm making them parallel
because<00:01:24.500> i'm<00:01:25.500> going<00:01:25.680> to<00:01:25.740> set<00:01:25.920> aside<00:01:26.040> by<00:01:26.250> side

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
because i'm going to set aside by side

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.310 
because i'm going to set aside by side
so<00:01:26.939> it's<00:01:27.090> just<00:01:27.240> an<00:01:27.330> easier<00:01:27.600> chance<00:01:27.900> of<00:01:28.140> hitting

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
so it's just an easier chance of hitting

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.249 
so it's just an easier chance of hitting
the<00:01:28.500> ramp<00:01:29.720> uh<00:01:30.720> yeah<00:01:32.780> this<00:01:33.780> i<00:01:33.960> was<00:01:34.079> going<00:01:34.229> to

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
the ramp uh yeah this i was going to

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.080 
the ramp uh yeah this i was going to
make<00:01:34.439> this<00:01:34.560> one<00:01:34.770> a<00:01:34.799> lot<00:01:35.040> bigger<00:01:35.369> like<00:01:35.939> my

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
make this one a lot bigger like my

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.640 
make this one a lot bigger like my
friend<00:01:36.360> needs<00:01:36.600> I<00:01:36.869> have<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.259> show<00:01:37.409> you<00:01:37.439> his
