going<00:00:33.690> to<00:00:33.750> be<00:00:33.840> less<00:00:34.170> of<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.739> current<00:00:35.010> Traverse

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
going to be less of the current Traverse

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.459 
going to be less of the current Traverse
models<00:00:35.640> to<00:00:35.790> get<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.570> full<00:00:36.840> redesign<00:00:37.200> is

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
models to get the full redesign is

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.100 
models to get the full redesign is
expected<00:00:38.010> for<00:00:38.190> 2013<00:00:38.790> it's<00:00:39.510> not<00:00:39.719> clear<00:00:39.960> as<00:00:40.050> to

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
expected for 2013 it's not clear as to

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.560 
expected for 2013 it's not clear as to
what<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.320> 2013<00:00:40.980> version<00:00:41.219> will<00:00:41.489> have<00:00:41.640> but<00:00:42.450> it's

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
what the 2013 version will have but it's

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.930 
what the 2013 version will have but it's
clear<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.020> 2012<00:00:43.559> edition<00:00:44.040> of<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.640> Traverse

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
clear the 2012 edition of the Traverse

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.670 
clear the 2012 edition of the Traverse
is<00:00:45.090> going<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.450> be<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.690> last<00:00:45.899> of<00:00:46.140> its<00:00:46.260> kind

is going to be the last of its kind

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.310 
is going to be the last of its kind
so<00:00:47.399> 2012<00:00:47.969> be<00:00:48.149> a<00:00:48.180> good<00:00:48.390> time<00:00:48.629> for<00:00:48.899> anyone<00:00:49.200> to
