inevitable a lot of times these

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:03.270 
inevitable a lot of times these
racetracks<00:03:02.230> because<00:03:02.680> we<00:03:02.830> have<00:03:02.920> such<00:03:03.100> large

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
spread out a little bit better so I

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.580 
spread out a little bit better so I
think<00:03:06.820> that<00:03:07.000> everybody<00:03:07.870> worries<00:03:08.260> about<00:03:08.350> these
