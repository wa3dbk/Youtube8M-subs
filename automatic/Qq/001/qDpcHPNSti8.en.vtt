 A mother gonÃ§alinha this machine 2015 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:23.430
 To make that iron wheel just use 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.189
 to make up current does everything 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.260
 know trends saw ring 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:32.579
 so I'm without a tool to 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:35.070
 learn here on the bench but it 's one thing 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:39.559
 very simple that you can understand the 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:45.600
 functioning of the little more force 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:49.200
 and that machine working a structure 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:54.149
 a base at five I did 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:58.500
 abbas also has a piece of pipe 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:02.280
 here an inch and a half two 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.290
 inches two inches and steel tubes 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:12.060
 the device must have good 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:15.920
 thick to withstand nox and 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:20.640
 twisted the iron 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:25.560
 It is basically very simple to 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:27.960
 operation of the machine here in the 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.240
 from behind triumph 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.690
 where are you going to stick the account here 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.690
 hill 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:41.610
 the machine that is securely attached to a 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:45.900
 the company's transport 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:48.600
 You put the hill here with one hand. 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:02:03.170
 hold it tightly down to the 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:02:03.170
 The first portion rotates aiming for greater damage 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:10.170
 and the iron will be here rolled up here 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.100
 go how to make a spring is the 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.030
 end 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:16.890
 The amount you want to make, right? 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.720
 will rolling rolling rolling ideal 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:46.860
 not to waste time and the great 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:49.220
 I'm going to go to close the arch here. 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.220
 Very close 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:03:01.250
 stay a spring a death 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:07.160
 I learned here on wood remember here 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:07.160
 this point here all rings cut everything 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:14.060
 then at the end 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:17.140
 in the end you will have several rings 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:20.300
 in that measure 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:22.760
 used to do various things like me 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:24.830
 I make arabesque is fact handicraft with 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:31.790
 iron is very multiply the rings 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:34.549
 here's right there, guys, I just cut 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:43.730
 here has paused the video 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:47.019
 I cut it out that we can stay 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.019
 a little aside 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:55.310
 the crowd here is this with the hand

 same right is to jog adjust and 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:11.290
 twist it can even stay here 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:11.290
 that it can be right here 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:21.919
 the bench has the street saw of the welder 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:26.979
 a sure hand here and give the points of 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:30.940
 solder that is in the case of current 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:30.940
 in the case of current 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:47.860
 part of the chain thus makes 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:50.560
 kisses tam soldano closing the 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:05:00.040
 successively making a 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:05:03.640
 current but several things with this there 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:09.610
 The machine is this one. It 's very simple. 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:14.740
 fifteen in a locksmith shop here in 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:16.630
 police, nor is this fact very useful. 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:21.760
 That's where I made it myself.

 to make my socks 

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:27.690
