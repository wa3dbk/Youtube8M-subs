think about Footwear scooting all around
the<00:01:55.630> court<00:01:55.840> and<00:01:55.899> running<00:01:56.200> but<00:01:56.709> I<00:01:56.770> think<00:01:57.099> a<00:01:57.189> more

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
the court and running but I think a more

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:58.769 
the court and running but I think a more
important<00:01:57.819> area<00:01:58.090> and<00:01:58.209> I<00:01:58.240> see<00:01:58.420> this<00:01:58.599> at<00:01:58.719> our

00:01:58.769 --> 00:01:58.779 
important area and I see this at our

00:01:58.779 --> 00:02:01.399 
important area and I see this at our
club<00:01:59.079> is<00:01:59.259> how<00:01:59.770> footwork<00:02:00.249> controls<00:02:00.999> or

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
club is how footwork controls or

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.469 
club is how footwork controls or
