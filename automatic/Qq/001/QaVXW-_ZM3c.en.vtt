this<00:02:17.099> really<00:02:17.519> big<00:02:17.790> battle<00:02:18.209> in<00:02:18.390> these<00:02:18.750> ancient

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
this really big battle in these ancient

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.630 
this really big battle in these ancient
ruins<00:02:19.500> in<00:02:19.680> the<00:02:19.769> valley<00:02:19.950> of<00:02:20.159> the<00:02:20.189> wind<00:02:20.400> and

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
ruins in the valley of the wind and

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.369 
ruins in the valley of the wind and
honestly<00:02:21.000> it's<00:02:21.299> pretty<00:02:21.750> cool<00:02:22.019> nothing

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 
honestly it's pretty cool nothing

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:24.800 
honestly it's pretty cool nothing
groundbreaking<00:02:22.769> but<00:02:23.700> still<00:02:24.000> pretty<00:02:24.569> decent

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
groundbreaking but still pretty decent

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.539 
groundbreaking but still pretty decent
we<00:02:25.140> had<00:02:25.260> some<00:02:25.500> pretty<00:02:25.650> good<00:02:25.829> artwork<00:02:26.220> in<00:02:26.370> some

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:26.549 
we had some pretty good artwork in some

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:28.280 
we had some pretty good artwork in some
animation<00:02:27.180> the<00:02:27.510> one<00:02:27.689> thing<00:02:27.870> that<00:02:28.019> I<00:02:28.049> didn't

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
animation the one thing that I didn't

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.479 
animation the one thing that I didn't
really<00:02:28.439> care<00:02:28.650> for<00:02:28.709> in<00:02:29.010> this<00:02:29.129> week's<00:02:29.340> episode

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
really care for in this week's episode

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.640 
really care for in this week's episode
and<00:02:30.090> it's<00:02:30.239> more<00:02:30.450> of<00:02:30.540> a<00:02:30.629> nitpick<00:02:31.049> than<00:02:31.260> anything

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
and it's more of a nitpick than anything

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:32.569 
and it's more of a nitpick than anything
and<00:02:31.769> it's<00:02:31.860> just<00:02:31.920> because<00:02:32.220> I<00:02:32.310> can<00:02:32.340> already

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:32.579 
and it's just because I can already

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:34.640 
and it's just because I can already
predict<00:02:33.000> where<00:02:33.180> the<00:02:33.269> story<00:02:33.540> is<00:02:33.690> going<00:02:33.720> is<00:02:34.200> at

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
predict where the story is going is at

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.080 
predict where the story is going is at
the<00:02:34.739> very<00:02:34.950> end<00:02:35.129> of<00:02:35.220> this<00:02:35.370> big<00:02:35.610> battle<00:02:35.790> they

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
the very end of this big battle they

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.970 
the very end of this big battle they
caused<00:02:36.299> this<00:02:36.510> big<00:02:36.720> attack<00:02:37.049> to<00:02:37.560> create<00:02:37.860> this

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
caused this big attack to create this

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.920 
caused this big attack to create this
like<00:02:38.190> big<00:02:38.459> hole<00:02:38.700> that<00:02:38.730> opens<00:02:39.239> up<00:02:39.390> in<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:39.599> ruins

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
like big hole that opens up in the ruins

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.380 
like big hole that opens up in the ruins
and<00:02:40.200> both<00:02:40.530> a<00:02:40.680> GSI<00:02:41.129> and<00:02:41.159> Tenten<00:02:41.790> end<00:02:42.030> up<00:02:42.150> falling

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
and both a GSI and Tenten end up falling

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.210 
and both a GSI and Tenten end up falling
in<00:02:42.659> and<00:02:42.989> getting<00:02:43.230> trapped<00:02:43.590> underneath<00:02:43.920> all

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
in and getting trapped underneath all

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.380 
in and getting trapped underneath all
this<00:02:44.370> rubble<00:02:44.760> which<00:02:44.909> leads<00:02:45.120> to<00:02:45.269> their

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
this rubble which leads to their

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:46.729 
this rubble which leads to their
teammates<00:02:45.750> having<00:02:45.900> to<00:02:46.079> stop<00:02:46.290> fighting<00:02:46.560> and

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
teammates having to stop fighting and

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:49.430 
teammates having to stop fighting and
have<00:02:47.280> to<00:02:47.400> go<00:02:47.519> and<00:02:47.790> find<00:02:48.120> them<00:02:48.390> obviously<00:02:49.290> the

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
have to go and find them obviously the

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.449 
have to go and find them obviously the
teammates<00:02:49.799> are<00:02:49.890> going<00:02:49.980> to<00:02:50.069> start<00:02:50.250> working

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
teammates are going to start working

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.330 
teammates are going to start working
together<00:02:50.700> but<00:02:51.599> both<00:02:51.840> a<00:02:51.989> GSI<00:02:52.409> and<00:02:52.650> Tenten<00:02:53.040> are

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
together but both a GSI and Tenten are

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.830 
together but both a GSI and Tenten are
clearly<00:02:53.819> going<00:02:54.150> to<00:02:54.239> have<00:02:54.359> to<00:02:54.480> work<00:02:54.629> together

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
clearly going to have to work together

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.420 
clearly going to have to work together
and<00:02:55.260> they're<00:02:55.769> going<00:02:55.920> to<00:02:56.010> have<00:02:56.099> to<00:02:56.250> learn<00:02:56.370> some

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
and they're going to have to learn some

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:57.920 
and they're going to have to learn some
techniques<00:02:56.790> from<00:02:57.269> each<00:02:57.389> other<00:02:57.599> and<00:02:57.780> this

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
techniques from each other and this

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.720 
techniques from each other and this
makes<00:02:58.139> sense<00:02:58.349> because<00:02:58.620> they<00:02:59.069> both<00:02:59.280> happen<00:02:59.700> to

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730

brought<00:04:27.150> it<00:04:27.270> up<00:04:27.389> because<00:04:27.570> you<00:04:27.900> know<00:04:28.260> Rock<00:04:28.560> Lee

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
brought it up because you know Rock Lee

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:29.610 
brought it up because you know Rock Lee
just<00:04:28.919> doesn't<00:04:29.219> think

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
just doesn't think

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.350 
just doesn't think
he<00:04:29.710> talks<00:04:29.919> he<00:04:30.100> just<00:04:30.280> does<00:04:30.430> his<00:04:30.460> thing<00:04:30.850> some

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
he talks he just does his thing some

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:32.340 
he talks he just does his thing some
other<00:04:31.510> things<00:04:31.720> that<00:04:31.840> I<00:04:31.870> really<00:04:31.930> liked<00:04:32.260> about

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.350 
other things that I really liked about

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.110 
other things that I really liked about
this<00:04:32.590> episode<00:04:33.010> was<00:04:33.160> just<00:04:33.310> the<00:04:33.430> mixture<00:04:33.880> of

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
this episode was just the mixture of

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.790 
this episode was just the mixture of
different<00:04:34.449> types<00:04:34.630> of<00:04:34.780> humor<00:04:35.110> and<00:04:35.260> action<00:04:35.440> and

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
different types of humor and action and

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.860 
different types of humor and action and
animation<00:04:36.220> I<00:04:36.580> liked<00:04:37.060> how<00:04:37.210> they<00:04:37.419> actually<00:04:37.750> did

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
animation I liked how they actually did

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.300 
animation I liked how they actually did
a<00:04:37.900> pretty<00:04:38.050> good<00:04:38.290> job<00:04:38.440> of<00:04:38.500> just<00:04:38.770> animating

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
a pretty good job of just animating

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:40.560 
a pretty good job of just animating
everything<00:04:39.669> overall<00:04:40.060> I<00:04:40.090> loved<00:04:40.479> the

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570 
everything overall I loved the

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.510 
everything overall I loved the
atmosphere<00:04:40.720> the<00:04:41.290> music<00:04:41.590> that<00:04:41.710> they<00:04:41.830> used<00:04:42.100> but

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
atmosphere the music that they used but

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:43.500 
atmosphere the music that they used but
I<00:04:42.610> also<00:04:42.699> loved<00:04:42.940> the<00:04:42.970> scene<00:04:43.210> during<00:04:43.360> the

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:43.510 
I also loved the scene during the

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.060 
I also loved the scene during the
training<00:04:43.840> sequence<00:04:44.080> where<00:04:44.380> it<00:04:44.470> actually<00:04:44.620> went

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070 
training sequence where it actually went

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:47.850 
training sequence where it actually went
back<00:04:45.250> to<00:04:45.460> the<00:04:45.580> SD<00:04:46.120> narcho<00:04:46.540> series<00:04:46.990> with<00:04:47.440> guy<00:04:47.650> in

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
back to the SD narcho series with guy in

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.530 
back to the SD narcho series with guy in
10/10<00:04:48.250> when<00:04:48.430> she<00:04:48.550> was<00:04:48.639> imagining<00:04:49.090> summoning

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:49.540 
10/10 when she was imagining summoning

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.090 
10/10 when she was imagining summoning
an<00:04:49.630> ocean<00:04:49.990> and<00:04:50.080> getting<00:04:50.320> them<00:04:50.440> all<00:04:50.590> swept<00:04:50.949> away

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:51.100 
an ocean and getting them all swept away

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:52.860 
an ocean and getting them all swept away
I<00:04:51.460> thought<00:04:51.850> that<00:04:52.000> was<00:04:52.120> pretty<00:04:52.270> funny<00:04:52.419> and<00:04:52.720> it's

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
I thought that was pretty funny and it's

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.240 
I thought that was pretty funny and it's
one<00:04:52.990> of<00:04:53.080> the<00:04:53.139> few<00:04:53.380> times<00:04:53.590> when<00:04:53.889> I<00:04:53.919> think<00:04:54.040> it

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.250 
one of the few times when I think it

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:55.590 
one of the few times when I think it
really<00:04:54.370> works<00:04:54.699> when<00:04:54.880> they<00:04:54.940> use<00:04:55.060> those<00:04:55.210> SD

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:55.600 
really works when they use those SD

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.450 
really works when they use those SD
characters<00:04:56.050> because<00:04:56.650> Rock<00:04:56.860> Lee<00:04:57.040> and<00:04:57.070> his<00:04:57.220> team

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
characters because Rock Lee and his team

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:58.860 
characters because Rock Lee and his team
were<00:04:57.610> basically<00:04:57.940> the<00:04:58.150> main<00:04:58.360> characters<00:04:58.840> of

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:58.870 
were basically the main characters of

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.960 
were basically the main characters of
that<00:04:59.169> spin-off<00:04:59.680> otherwise<00:05:00.490> this<00:05:00.790> was<00:05:00.940> a

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:00.970 
that spin-off otherwise this was a

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:02.850 
that spin-off otherwise this was a
pretty<00:05:01.270> good<00:05:01.479> episode<00:05:01.720> if<00:05:02.169> I<00:05:02.289> only<00:05:02.440> had<00:05:02.650> one

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
pretty good episode if I only had one

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.760 
pretty good episode if I only had one
thing<00:05:03.460> I<00:05:03.940> would<00:05:04.150> change<00:05:04.180> its<00:05:04.780> that<00:05:05.260> I<00:05:05.440> would

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
thing I would change its that I would

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.629 
thing I would change its that I would
switch<00:05:06.250> out<00:05:06.460> team<00:05:06.789> guys<00:05:07.199> team<00:05:08.199> for<00:05:08.710> Choji<00:05:09.460> Ino

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:09.639 
switch out team guys team for Choji Ino

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:11.520 
switch out team guys team for Choji Ino
and<00:05:09.910> Sakura<00:05:10.510> but<00:05:10.690> only<00:05:10.870> because<00:05:11.229> they<00:05:11.350> haven't

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:11.530 
and Sakura but only because they haven't

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:13.230 
and Sakura but only because they haven't
really<00:05:11.830> been<00:05:11.949> showcased<00:05:12.400> at<00:05:12.550> all<00:05:12.699> in<00:05:12.850> this<00:05:13.000> arc

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.240 
really been showcased at all in this arc

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.210 
really been showcased at all in this arc
but<00:05:13.840> I<00:05:13.990> am<00:05:14.169> really<00:05:14.380> surprised<00:05:14.800> if<00:05:14.949> they<00:05:15.039> focus

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:15.220 
but I am really surprised if they focus

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:16.830 
but I am really surprised if they focus
on<00:05:15.490> Tenten<00:05:15.910> I<00:05:16.060> thought<00:05:16.270> this<00:05:16.419> was<00:05:16.539> going<00:05:16.690> to<00:05:16.750> be

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840 
on Tenten I thought this was going to be

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.540 
on Tenten I thought this was going to be
another<00:05:17.080> excuse<00:05:17.590> to<00:05:18.010> give<00:05:18.130> us<00:05:18.250> something

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 
another excuse to give us something

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.490 
another excuse to give us something
again<00:05:18.789> with<00:05:18.940> Rock<00:05:19.180> Lee<00:05:19.419> or<00:05:19.690> Neji<00:05:20.080> especially

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500 
again with Rock Lee or Neji especially

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.050 
again with Rock Lee or Neji especially
Neji<00:05:20.830> because<00:05:21.100> of<00:05:21.220> what<00:05:21.340> happened<00:05:21.699> in<00:05:21.789> the<00:05:21.880> war

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:22.060 
Neji because of what happened in the war

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.779 
Neji because of what happened in the war
but<00:05:22.660> no<00:05:22.930> we're<00:05:23.530> getting<00:05:23.620> Tenten<00:05:24.220> and<00:05:24.460> frankly

00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:24.789 
but no we're getting Tenten and frankly

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:26.279 
but no we're getting Tenten and frankly
I<00:05:24.820> think<00:05:24.910> that's<00:05:25.180> really<00:05:25.570> awesome<00:05:25.750> this<00:05:26.110> is<00:05:26.169> a

00:05:26.279 --> 00:05:26.289 
I think that's really awesome this is a

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:28.320 
I think that's really awesome this is a
great<00:05:26.590> opportunity<00:05:26.949> to<00:05:27.460> showcase<00:05:27.910> this

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:28.330 
great opportunity to showcase this

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:29.400 
great opportunity to showcase this
character<00:05:28.750> and<00:05:28.840> hopefully<00:05:29.110> they'll<00:05:29.289> lose

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:29.410 
character and hopefully they'll lose

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:30.540 
character and hopefully they'll lose
something<00:05:29.740> cool<00:05:29.949> with<00:05:30.039> it<00:05:30.190> next<00:05:30.400> week

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:31.960 
although I'm not going to hold my breath

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.779 
although I'm not going to hold my breath
because<00:05:32.289> the<00:05:32.620> animation<00:05:33.160> doesn't<00:05:33.520> really

00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:33.789 
because the animation doesn't really

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:36.750 
because the animation doesn't really
look<00:05:34.030> all<00:05:34.180> that<00:05:34.289> amazing<00:05:35.289> in<00:05:35.620> fact<00:05:36.070> I<00:05:36.490> think<00:05:36.550> it
