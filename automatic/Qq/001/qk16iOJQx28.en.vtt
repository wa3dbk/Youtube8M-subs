fact that you've done something right
and<00:00:15.450> didn't<00:00:16.170> burn<00:00:16.440> anything<00:00:16.770> down<00:00:17.300> while

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
and didn't burn anything down while

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.410 
and didn't burn anything down while
trying<00:00:18.690> to<00:00:19.279> you<00:00:20.279> know<00:00:20.340> complete<00:00:20.820> whatever<00:00:21.300> it

as you can see you know I'm missing a

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.049 
as you can see you know I'm missing a
couple<00:01:01.379> actuators<00:01:02.219> in<00:01:02.370> here<00:01:02.609> haven't<00:01:02.969> hooked

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
couple actuators in here haven't hooked

couple actuators in here haven't hooked
those<00:01:03.359> up<00:01:03.570> yet<00:01:03.979> got<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.070> power<00:01:05.220> supply

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
those up yet got the power supply

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.380 
those up yet got the power supply
battery<00:01:06.110> motor<00:01:07.110> controller<00:01:08.030> and<00:01:09.030> then<00:01:09.210> this

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
battery motor controller and then this

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.130 
battery motor controller and then this
funny<00:01:09.689> swing<00:01:10.530> balancing<00:01:11.520> mechanism<00:01:12.180> that's

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
funny swing balancing mechanism that's

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.770 
funny swing balancing mechanism that's
not<00:01:13.409> doing<00:01:13.680> anything<00:01:13.890> right<00:01:14.130> now<00:01:14.220> this<00:01:14.460> little

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
not doing anything right now this little

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.620 
not doing anything right now this little
swing<00:01:15.780> rig<00:01:16.259> in<00:01:16.500> place<00:01:17.119> not<00:01:18.119> doing<00:01:18.420> anything

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
swing rig in place not doing anything

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:19.100 
swing rig in place not doing anything
right<00:01:18.810> now

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
right now

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.850 
right now
but<00:01:19.880> nonetheless<00:01:20.880> it's<00:01:21.780> in<00:01:21.960> place<00:01:22.229> so<00:01:22.740> it's

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
but nonetheless it's in place so it's

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.310 
but nonetheless it's in place so it's
gonna<00:01:23.009> float<00:01:23.280> around<00:01:23.580> a<00:01:23.640> little<00:01:23.700> bit<00:01:23.909> so<00:01:24.840> what

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
gonna float around a little bit so what

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.880 
gonna float around a little bit so what
we<00:01:25.470> accomplished<00:01:26.070> is<00:01:27.470> set<00:01:28.470> up<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.680> motor

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
we accomplished is set up the motor

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.789 
we accomplished is set up the motor
controller<00:01:29.450> programmed<00:01:30.450> it<00:01:30.630> with<00:01:30.840> just<00:01:31.680> some

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
controller programmed it with just some

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.630 
controller programmed it with just some
real<00:01:31.979> basic<00:01:32.340> code<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.939> make<00:01:33.930> these<00:01:34.170> guys

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
real basic code to make these guys

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.300 
real basic code to make these guys
bounce<00:01:35.640> up<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:36.360> down<00:01:36.659> so<00:01:37.500> it's<00:01:37.740> gonna<00:01:37.890> kind<00:01:38.250> of

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
bounce up and down so it's gonna kind of

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.780 
bounce up and down so it's gonna kind of
do<00:01:38.460> a<00:01:38.960> squat<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.259> I'm<00:01:41.100> gonna<00:01:41.250> do<00:01:41.400> his<00:01:41.579> little

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
do a squat and I'm gonna do his little

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.060 
do a squat and I'm gonna do his little
squat<00:01:42.689> thrust<00:01:43.049> workout<00:01:44.240> so<00:01:45.240> hook<00:01:45.479> it<00:01:45.600> up<00:01:45.689> and

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
squat thrust workout so hook it up and

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.219 
squat thrust workout so hook it up and
get<00:01:47.070> a<00:01:47.100> glance<00:01:47.369> at<00:01:47.579> what<00:01:47.729> it<00:01:47.850> does<00:01:48.000> here<00:01:48.299> take

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
get a glance at what it does here take

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.679 
get a glance at what it does here take
the<00:01:49.409> juice<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:49.950> plug<00:01:50.280> it<00:01:50.399> in

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:52.689 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:59.069 

yeah<00:01:53.609> once<00:01:54.609> you<00:01:54.759> run<00:01:54.939> away<00:01:57.270> so<00:01:58.270> there<00:01:58.450> she<00:01:58.630> goes

00:01:59.069 --> 00:01:59.079 
yeah once you run away so there she goes

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:09.469 
yeah once you run away so there she goes
so<00:01:59.380> she<00:01:59.439> does<00:02:01.079> do<00:02:02.079> a<00:02:02.109> couple<00:02:02.530> up<00:02:02.649> and<00:02:02.799> downs<00:02:03.009> I

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.949 

think<00:02:10.479> it's<00:02:10.780> set<00:02:11.080> up<00:02:11.110> to<00:02:12.000> extend<00:02:13.000> for<00:02:13.450> two<00:02:13.810> or

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
think it's set up to extend for two or

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.350 
think it's set up to extend for two or
three<00:02:14.110> seconds<00:02:14.620> and<00:02:14.860> then<00:02:14.980> one<00:02:15.489> second<00:02:16.000> in<00:02:16.180> the

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
three seconds and then one second in the

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.170 
three seconds and then one second in the
down<00:02:16.510> motion<00:02:17.019> since<00:02:17.739> you<00:02:17.860> have<00:02:19.110> pressure<00:02:20.110> from

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
down motion since you have pressure from

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.259 
down motion since you have pressure from
from<00:02:22.180> the<00:02:22.299> top<00:02:22.950> natural<00:02:23.950> gravity<00:02:24.430> it<00:02:24.879> takes<00:02:25.150> a

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
from the top natural gravity it takes a

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:27.930 
from the top natural gravity it takes a
little<00:02:25.629> little<00:02:26.049> lost<00:02:26.260> time<00:02:26.560> to<00:02:26.769> to<00:02:27.579> get<00:02:27.730> down

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
little little lost time to to get down

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.680 
little little lost time to to get down
than<00:02:28.150> it<00:02:28.269> does<00:02:28.420> up<00:02:29.819> so<00:02:30.819> there<00:02:31.120> she<00:02:31.360> is<00:02:31.420> doing

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
than it does up so there she is doing

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.240 
than it does up so there she is doing
some<00:02:31.870> squat<00:02:32.140> thrusts<00:02:32.470> like<00:02:32.620> I<00:02:32.769> said<00:02:32.980> no

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
some squat thrusts like I said no

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.250 
some squat thrusts like I said no
nothing<00:02:33.610> real<00:02:33.910> special<00:02:34.090> but<00:02:34.660> just<00:02:34.989> want<00:02:35.170> to

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
nothing real special but just want to

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.670 
nothing real special but just want to
take<00:02:35.410> the<00:02:35.590> extra<00:02:35.769> moment<00:02:37.319> just<00:02:38.319> enjoy

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
take the extra moment just enjoy

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.380 
take the extra moment just enjoy
watching<00:02:38.920> the<00:02:39.220> robot<00:02:39.549> jump<00:02:39.879> up<00:02:40.030> and<00:02:40.180> down<00:02:40.360> a

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
watching the robot jump up and down a

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.460 
watching the robot jump up and down a
little<00:02:40.599> bit<00:02:41.760> so<00:02:42.760> what's<00:02:42.970> next<00:02:43.239> is<00:02:43.629> tying<00:02:44.319> the

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
little bit so what's next is tying the

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.550 
little bit so what's next is tying the
potentiometers<00:02:45.629> each<00:02:46.629> of<00:02:46.870> these<00:02:46.930> actuators

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
potentiometers each of these actuators

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.400 
potentiometers each of these actuators
have<00:02:47.769> a<00:02:47.799> potentiometer<00:02:48.370> so<00:02:49.239> I<00:02:49.299> can<00:02:49.510> read<00:02:49.780> the

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.410 

the<00:02:53.410> distance<00:02:53.829> you<00:02:53.980> know<00:02:54.099> how<00:02:54.459> far<00:02:54.790> it's<00:02:55.000> open

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
the distance you know how far it's open

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.530 
the distance you know how far it's open
so<00:02:55.660> I<00:02:55.690> can<00:02:55.870> do<00:02:56.379> kind<00:02:57.250> of<00:02:57.370> dead<00:02:57.639> positioning<00:02:58.389> of

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
so I can do kind of dead positioning of

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.960 
so I can do kind of dead positioning of
each<00:02:59.319> of<00:02:59.470> the<00:02:59.530> actuators<00:03:00.040> and<00:03:00.190> motor

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
each of the actuators and motor

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.120 
each of the actuators and motor
controllers<00:03:01.450> got<00:03:01.720> just<00:03:02.530> gonna<00:03:02.680> shut<00:03:02.859> this<00:03:02.950> guy

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
controllers got just gonna shut this guy

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.129 
controllers got just gonna shut this guy
off<00:03:03.280> real<00:03:03.430> quick<00:03:03.639> motor<00:03:04.510> controllers<00:03:04.959> got

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:05.139 
off real quick motor controllers got

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:07.319 
off real quick motor controllers got
inputs<00:03:05.709> for<00:03:06.280> each<00:03:06.579> of<00:03:06.730> the<00:03:06.790> pots<00:03:07.030> and<00:03:07.209> you

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:07.329 
inputs for each of the pots and you

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:08.879 
inputs for each of the pots and you
actually<00:03:07.660> you<00:03:07.720> can<00:03:07.840> see<00:03:07.989> the<00:03:08.019> pot<00:03:08.319> leads<00:03:08.620> here

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:08.889 
actually you can see the pot leads here

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:11.220 
actually you can see the pot leads here
so<00:03:09.700> I'll<00:03:09.790> hook<00:03:09.910> up<00:03:10.060> those<00:03:10.239> so<00:03:10.810> I'll<00:03:10.870> be<00:03:10.989> able<00:03:11.049> to

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
so I'll hook up those so I'll be able to

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.920 
so I'll hook up those so I'll be able to
get<00:03:11.430> actual<00:03:12.430> position<00:03:13.000> information<00:03:13.150> instead

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
get actual position information instead

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.900 
get actual position information instead
of<00:03:14.049> just<00:03:14.290> hey<00:03:14.919> you<00:03:14.950> jump<00:03:15.250> up<00:03:15.370> and<00:03:15.489> down

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
of just hey you jump up and down

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.259 
of just hey you jump up and down
bounce<00:03:16.120> up<00:03:16.239> and<00:03:16.329> down<00:03:16.419> do<00:03:16.720> squat<00:03:17.019> thrusts<00:03:18.239> so<00:03:19.239> I

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
bounce up and down do squat thrusts so I

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:23.879 
bounce up and down do squat thrusts so I
get<00:03:19.450> that<00:03:19.540> all<00:03:19.690> set<00:03:19.930> up<00:03:20.049> and<00:03:22.680> get<00:03:23.680> it<00:03:23.769> all

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:23.889 
get that all set up and get it all

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:27.150 
get that all set up and get it all
working<00:03:24.130> and<00:03:24.400> then<00:03:24.549> expand<00:03:25.359> -<00:03:26.160> motor

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
working and then expand - motor

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.500 
working and then expand - motor
controller<00:03:27.700> actuator<00:03:28.569> 3<00:03:29.079> and<00:03:29.260> 4<00:03:29.500> and<00:03:29.859> then

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
controller actuator 3 and 4 and then

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.509 
controller actuator 3 and 4 and then
maybe<00:03:31.510> start<00:03:31.810> to<00:03:31.870> get<00:03:32.049> some<00:03:32.260> some<00:03:33.040> finer<00:03:33.310> or

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
maybe start to get some some finer or

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:35.309 
maybe start to get some some finer or
walking<00:03:34.060> movements<00:03:34.599> out<00:03:34.720> of<00:03:34.840> this<00:03:34.959> machine

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:35.319 
walking movements out of this machine

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:37.770 
walking movements out of this machine
instead<00:03:35.709> of<00:03:35.829> just<00:03:35.980> squat<00:03:36.280> throws<00:03:36.599> that's<00:03:37.599> what

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
instead of just squat throws that's what

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.349 
instead of just squat throws that's what
we<00:03:37.900> got<00:03:38.019> for<00:03:38.200> now
