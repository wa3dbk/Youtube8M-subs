00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
big we go to see it so I didn't really

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.770 
big we go to see it so I didn't really
understand<00:00:32.969> what<00:00:33.120> she<00:00:33.149> was<00:00:33.360> talking<00:00:33.719> about

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
right but sooner or later I felt like I

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.430 
right but sooner or later I felt like I

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.640 

so<00:02:05.940> eventually<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.600> show<00:02:06.810> came<00:02:07.080> to<00:02:07.290> a<00:02:07.320> close

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:07.650 
so eventually the show came to a close

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.380 
so eventually the show came to a close
and<00:02:07.890> I<00:02:07.950> figured<00:02:08.310> it<00:02:08.460> was<00:02:08.550> hard<00:02:08.789> time<00:02:09.030> to<00:02:09.240> get

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
and I figured it was hard time to get

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.770 
and I figured it was hard time to get
the<00:02:09.509> hell<00:02:09.750> out<00:02:09.990> of<00:02:10.020> there<00:02:11.300> so<00:02:12.300> we<00:02:12.420> started

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
the hell out of there so we started

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.300 
the hell out of there so we started
getting<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:13.110> move<00:02:13.290> on<00:02:13.470> when<00:02:13.770> suddenly<00:02:14.190> I

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
getting the move on when suddenly I

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.580 
getting the move on when suddenly I
heard<00:02:14.430> these<00:02:14.880> strange<00:02:15.240> sounds<00:02:15.959> reverberating

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
heard these strange sounds reverberating

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.220 
heard these strange sounds reverberating
from<00:02:16.860> behind<00:02:17.280> us<00:02:17.490> it<00:02:18.420> turns<00:02:18.720> out<00:02:18.930> that<00:02:19.080> the

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
from behind us it turns out that the

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:25.850 
from behind us it turns out that the
Fuji<00:02:19.650> TV<00:02:20.100> building<00:02:20.490> was<00:02:20.610> going<00:02:20.790> haywire

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.080 

eventually<00:02:26.860> the<00:02:27.220> sounds<00:02:27.640> and<00:02:27.730> the<00:02:27.790> lights

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
eventually the sounds and the lights

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.260 
eventually the sounds and the lights
reached<00:02:28.420> a<00:02:28.570> fever<00:02:28.840> pitch<00:02:28.990> I<00:02:29.910> could<00:02:30.910> have<00:02:31.030> sworn

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
reached a fever pitch I could have sworn

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.180 
reached a fever pitch I could have sworn
I<00:02:31.420> felt<00:02:31.660> the<00:02:31.810> ground<00:02:32.020> shake<00:02:32.200> and<00:02:32.560> I<00:02:32.620> thought<00:02:32.980> at

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
I felt the ground shake and I thought at

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:34.920 
I felt the ground shake and I thought at
some<00:02:33.400> point<00:02:33.670> man<00:02:34.150> this<00:02:34.330> building<00:02:34.690> is<00:02:34.750> gonna
