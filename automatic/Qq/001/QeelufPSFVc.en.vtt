00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.300 
main thing behind this app is going to
be<00:02:19.480> the<00:02:19.659> actual<00:02:19.780> OCR<00:02:20.379> scanning<00:02:20.590> so<00:02:20.980> let's<00:02:21.159> see

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
be the actual OCR scanning so let's see

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:22.979 
be the actual OCR scanning so let's see
how<00:02:21.459> it<00:02:21.489> works<00:02:21.579> now<00:02:21.970> I've<00:02:22.480> had<00:02:22.689> a<00:02:22.750> few<00:02:22.930> issues

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
how it works now I've had a few issues

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:24.929 
how it works now I've had a few issues
with<00:02:23.290> it<00:02:23.590> hasn't<00:02:23.860> been<00:02:23.920> the<00:02:24.010> best<00:02:24.069> but<00:02:24.700> you<00:02:24.730> can

00:02:24.929 --> 00:02:24.939 
with it hasn't been the best but you can

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:28.020 
with it hasn't been the best but you can
see<00:02:25.120> this<00:02:26.069> little<00:02:27.069> section<00:02:27.400> over<00:02:27.730> here<00:02:27.760> will

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
see this little section over here will

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.789 
see this little section over here will
populate<00:02:28.269> with<00:02:28.510> words<00:02:28.840> as<00:02:29.110> I<00:02:29.260> start<00:02:29.500> scanning

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:29.799 
populate with words as I start scanning

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:33.149 
populate with words as I start scanning
so<00:02:30.099> watch<00:02:30.250> out<00:02:30.430> for<00:02:30.489> that<00:02:31.650> now<00:02:32.650> this<00:02:32.890> is<00:02:32.980> all<00:02:33.129> in

00:02:33.149 --> 00:02:33.159 
so watch out for that now this is all in

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:38.599 
so watch out for that now this is all in
Chinese<00:02:33.940> so<00:02:34.209> it's<00:02:34.239> scanning<00:02:34.780> all<00:02:35.140> the<00:02:35.290> words

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:38.609 

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:41.250 

now<00:02:39.609> I<00:02:39.640> don't<00:02:39.819> exactly<00:02:40.329> know<00:02:40.690> what<00:02:40.959> this<00:02:41.109> is

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
now I don't exactly know what this is

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.259 
now I don't exactly know what this is
meant<00:02:41.440> to<00:02:41.620> be<00:02:41.650> about<00:02:41.950> this<00:02:42.189> article<00:02:42.549> whatever

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269 
meant to be about this article whatever

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:50.759 
meant to be about this article whatever
this<00:02:43.799> block<00:02:44.799> of<00:02:44.829> text<00:02:45.159> is<00:02:45.430> in<00:02:45.640> Chinese<00:02:47.519> but<00:02:49.769> it

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
this block of text is in Chinese but it

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:54.240 
this block of text is in Chinese but it
doesn't<00:02:51.129> always<00:02:51.310> work<00:02:52.060> so<00:02:52.120> well<00:02:52.950> you<00:02:53.950> can<00:02:54.099> see

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
doesn't always work so well you can see

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.190 
doesn't always work so well you can see
it's<00:02:54.370> just<00:02:54.430> populating<00:02:55.239> the<00:02:55.269> list<00:02:55.569> randomly

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
it's just populating the list randomly

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.140 
it's just populating the list randomly
and<00:02:57.900> you<00:02:58.900> know<00:02:59.019> yeah<00:02:59.319> I<00:02:59.769> don't<00:03:00.549> it<00:03:00.670> doesn't<00:03:00.760> it

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
and you know yeah I don't it doesn't it

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:02.309 
and you know yeah I don't it doesn't it
just<00:03:01.299> seems<00:03:01.480> to<00:03:01.569> be<00:03:01.599> very<00:03:01.690> annoying<00:03:02.079> you<00:03:02.290> know

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:02.319 
just seems to be very annoying you know

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:05.039 
just seems to be very annoying you know
it<00:03:02.950> doesn't<00:03:03.250> pick<00:03:03.489> up<00:03:03.579> on<00:03:04.030> a<00:03:04.090> whole<00:03:04.810> like

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.049 
it doesn't pick up on a whole like

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:08.460 
it doesn't pick up on a whole like
sentence<00:03:05.620> or<00:03:05.769> a<00:03:05.799> whole<00:03:06.099> word<00:03:06.909> it's<00:03:07.379> because<00:03:08.379> I

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
sentence or a whole word it's because I

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.190 
sentence or a whole word it's because I
guess<00:03:08.620> also<00:03:08.829> these<00:03:09.040> are<00:03:09.220> character-based

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
guess also these are character-based

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:16.890 
guess also these are character-based
it's<00:03:11.200> very<00:03:11.470> confusing<00:03:11.739> I<00:03:13.680> mean<00:03:15.720> I've<00:03:16.720> seen

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
it's very confusing I mean I've seen

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.839 
it's very confusing I mean I've seen
other<00:03:17.079> people<00:03:17.230> use<00:03:17.560> it<00:03:17.769> and<00:03:17.949> they<00:03:18.549> really

00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:18.849 
other people use it and they really

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:24.599 
other people use it and they really
liked<00:03:19.030> it<00:03:19.060> and<00:03:21.329> but<00:03:22.799> it's<00:03:23.799> just<00:03:24.069> I<00:03:24.340> don't<00:03:24.459> know

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:24.609 
liked it and but it's just I don't know

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:26.909 
liked it and but it's just I don't know
it<00:03:24.819> populates<00:03:25.660> all<00:03:25.810> these<00:03:25.959> words<00:03:26.199> too<00:03:26.739> much

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:26.919 
it populates all these words too much

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:28.770 
it populates all these words too much
even<00:03:27.639> when<00:03:27.669> I've<00:03:27.849> got<00:03:27.970> it<00:03:28.060> still<00:03:28.329> right<00:03:28.599> now

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
even when I've got it still right now

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.720 
even when I've got it still right now
it's<00:03:29.079> still<00:03:29.169> populating<00:03:29.859> more<00:03:30.040> words<00:03:30.280> in<00:03:30.489> more

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
it's still populating more words in more

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.069 
it's still populating more words in more
words<00:03:30.970> in<00:03:31.090> more<00:03:31.329> words<00:03:31.540> and<00:03:31.810> there's<00:03:31.959> only

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:32.079 
words in more words and there's only

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:34.589 
words in more words and there's only
pretty<00:03:32.859> much<00:03:33.069> there's<00:03:33.699> only<00:03:33.790> pretty<00:03:34.060> much<00:03:34.239> one

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:34.599 
pretty much there's only pretty much one

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:36.089 
pretty much there's only pretty much one
word<00:03:34.840> that<00:03:35.019> I've<00:03:35.139> got<00:03:35.349> it<00:03:35.440> focused<00:03:35.829> on<00:03:35.949> right

00:03:36.089 --> 00:03:36.099 
word that I've got it focused on right

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:37.830 
word that I've got it focused on right
now<00:03:36.129> and<00:03:36.340> it<00:03:36.430> keeps<00:03:36.609> just<00:03:36.849> changing<00:03:37.629> its<00:03:37.750> mind

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
now and it keeps just changing its mind

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.670 
now and it keeps just changing its mind
and<00:03:38.970> in<00:03:39.970> that<00:03:40.150> in<00:03:40.389> that<00:03:40.419> sense<00:03:40.840> I<00:03:41.049> don't<00:03:41.260> know

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
and in that in that sense I don't know

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.020 
and in that in that sense I don't know
if<00:03:41.859> it's<00:03:42.010> really<00:03:42.250> worth<00:03:42.280> it<00:03:42.730> you<00:03:42.970> know<00:03:43.000> 649<00:03:45.030> but

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
if it's really worth it you know 649 but

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.189 
if it's really worth it you know 649 but
that's<00:03:46.209> pretty<00:03:46.449> much<00:03:46.569> it<00:03:46.690> that's<00:03:46.989> the<00:03:47.079> whole

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:47.199 
that's pretty much it that's the whole

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:51.089
