00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:23.180 

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:27.800 

everything<00:06:24.180> about<00:06:24.570> this<00:06:24.780> ship<00:06:26.420> here<00:06:27.420> are<00:06:27.630> the

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:27.810 
everything about this ship here are the

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:33.940 
everything about this ship here are the
parts<00:06:28.050> and<00:06:28.320> pieces<00:06:29.060> from<00:06:30.060> bag<00:06:30.360> set<00:06:30.750> number<00:06:31.080> two

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:33.950 

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:37.040 

there's<00:06:34.950> a<00:06:35.070> lot<00:06:35.370> more<00:06:35.700> colorful<00:06:36.150> pieces<00:06:36.570> this

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:37.050 
there's a lot more colorful pieces this

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:37.390 
there's a lot more colorful pieces this
time

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:37.400 
time

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:43.940 
time
and<00:06:38.780> a<00:06:39.780> lot<00:06:40.020> more<00:06:40.370> variety

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:43.950 

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:48.860 

the<00:06:44.490> pieces<00:06:44.730> are<00:06:45.030> way<00:06:45.240> smaller<00:06:47.420> and<00:06:48.420> I<00:06:48.510> believe

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:48.870 
the pieces are way smaller and I believe

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:54.400 
the pieces are way smaller and I believe
bag<00:06:49.560> two<00:06:50.750> constructs<00:06:51.750> the<00:06:51.990> frame<00:06:52.410> of<00:06:52.680> the<00:06:52.830> ship

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:54.410 
bag two constructs the frame of the ship

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:58.850 
bag two constructs the frame of the ship
so<00:06:55.410> it's<00:06:55.590> like<00:06:55.770> a<00:06:55.800> frame<00:06:56.840> to<00:06:57.840> support<00:06:58.140> the<00:06:58.470> base

00:06:58.850 --> 00:06:58.860 
so it's like a frame to support the base

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:02.390 
so it's like a frame to support the base
and<00:06:59.450> probably<00:07:00.450> the<00:07:00.600> top<00:07:00.810> of<00:07:01.020> the<00:07:01.110> ship<00:07:01.400> like

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:02.400 
and probably the top of the ship like

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:08.040 
and probably the top of the ship like
the<00:07:02.550> inner<00:07:02.730> structure

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:08.050 

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:10.379 

and<00:07:08.319> believe<00:07:09.250> it<00:07:09.280> or<00:07:09.460> not<00:07:09.610> those<00:07:09.970> are<00:07:10.180> all

00:07:10.379 --> 00:07:10.389 
and believe it or not those are all

00:07:10.389 --> 00:07:15.300 
and believe it or not those are all
Technic<00:07:11.190> pieces<00:07:13.379> all<00:07:14.379> the<00:07:14.410> little<00:07:14.770> connectors

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:15.310 
Technic pieces all the little connectors

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:18.059 
Technic pieces all the little connectors
that<00:07:15.639> came<00:07:15.910> with<00:07:16.690> this<00:07:17.590> is<00:07:17.770> from<00:07:17.949> the

00:07:18.059 --> 00:07:18.069 
that came with this is from the

00:07:18.069 --> 00:07:25.170 
that came with this is from the
unnumbered<00:07:18.370> bags<00:07:18.849> Dale<00:07:23.580> so<00:07:24.580> from<00:07:24.789> a<00:07:24.909> side<00:07:25.150> view

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:25.180 
unnumbered bags Dale so from a side view

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:29.189 
unnumbered bags Dale so from a side view
you<00:07:25.720> go<00:07:26.139> a<00:07:26.379> lot<00:07:26.620> of<00:07:26.650> different<00:07:26.800> colors<00:07:28.199> there's

00:07:29.189 --> 00:07:29.199 
you go a lot of different colors there's

00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:33.469 
you go a lot of different colors there's
color<00:07:29.889> scheme<00:07:30.310> they<00:07:30.970> went<00:07:31.210> very<00:07:31.449> from<00:07:32.080> gray

00:07:33.469 --> 00:07:33.479 
color scheme they went very from gray

00:07:33.479 --> 00:07:36.869 
color scheme they went very from gray
gray<00:07:34.479> light<00:07:34.900> gray<00:07:34.930> dark<00:07:35.440> gray<00:07:35.530> and<00:07:35.889> in<00:07:36.430> black

00:07:36.869 --> 00:07:36.879 
gray light gray dark gray and in black

00:07:36.879 --> 00:07:54.000 
gray light gray dark gray and in black
to<00:07:37.300> a<00:07:39.360> variety<00:07:40.360> of<00:07:40.599> colorful<00:07:41.190> pieces

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:54.010 

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:56.160 

and<00:07:54.250> to<00:07:54.760> think<00:07:55.030> all<00:07:55.240> this<00:07:55.510> is<00:07:55.750> going<00:07:55.990> to<00:07:56.050> be

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:56.170 
and to think all this is going to be

00:07:56.170 --> 00:08:03.960 
and to think all this is going to be
used<00:07:56.470> up<00:07:58.740> really<00:07:59.740> quickly<00:08:00.840> takes<00:08:01.840> me<00:08:02.020> about<00:08:02.970> 30

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:03.970 
used up really quickly takes me about 30

00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:07.680 
used up really quickly takes me about 30
