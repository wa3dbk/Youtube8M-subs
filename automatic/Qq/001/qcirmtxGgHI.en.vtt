are locally available right and then the
weather-based<00:06:23.410> irrigation<00:06:23.610> controller<00:06:24.610> can

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:24.880

be added to an existing system you want

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:29.450 
be added to an existing system you want
take<00:06:26.980> a<00:06:27.010> look<00:06:27.190> at<00:06:27.280> that<00:06:27.370> yeah<00:06:27.700> hi

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:29.460 
take a look at that yeah hi

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:31.909 
take a look at that yeah hi
so<00:06:29.759> the<00:06:29.880> weather<00:06:30.090> station<00:06:30.690> outside<00:06:30.870> it<00:06:31.470> sends

00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:31.919 
so the weather station outside it sends

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:34.610 
so the weather station outside it sends
a<00:06:31.979> signal<00:06:32.250> to<00:06:32.729> the<00:06:32.820> controller<00:06:33.270> we<00:06:33.930> programmed

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:34.620 
a signal to the controller we programmed

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:36.200 
a signal to the controller we programmed
the<00:06:34.770> water<00:06:35.040> requirements<00:06:35.759> for<00:06:35.880> all<00:06:36.030> the

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:36.210 
the water requirements for all the

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:37.969 
the water requirements for all the
different<00:06:36.600> zones<00:06:36.630> out<00:06:37.259> there<00:06:37.500> so<00:06:37.710> it<00:06:37.800> knows

00:06:37.969 --> 00:06:37.979 
different zones out there so it knows

00:06:37.979 --> 00:06:40.550 
different zones out there so it knows
wind<00:06:38.280> irrigate<00:06:38.759> and<00:06:39.150> when<00:06:39.300> not<00:06:39.479> it's<00:06:40.169> a<00:06:40.320> setup

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:40.560 
wind irrigate and when not it's a setup

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.830 
wind irrigate and when not it's a setup
that<00:06:40.860> conserves<00:06:41.280> water<00:06:41.430> and<00:06:41.940> takes<00:06:42.479> a<00:06:42.570> chunk

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:42.840 
that conserves water and takes a chunk

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.390 
that conserves water and takes a chunk
out<00:06:42.960> of<00:06:43.020> your<00:06:43.169> water<00:06:43.440> bill<00:06:43.680> you<00:06:44.250> can
