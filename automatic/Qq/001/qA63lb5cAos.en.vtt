know there was a recent patch on call of
duty<00:00:58.839> and<00:00:58.989> what<00:00:59.589> they<00:00:59.739> did<00:00:59.979> they<00:01:00.159> nerfed<00:01:00.579> the

i think they buffed a couple of the
assault<00:01:07.780> rifles<00:01:08.200> and<00:01:08.380> a<00:01:08.409> couple<00:01:08.620> of<00:01:08.770> the<00:01:08.890> light

opposite<00:01:12.820> of<00:01:13.000> what<00:01:13.630> needed<00:01:13.870> to<00:01:14.110> happen<00:01:14.140> if

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:14.650 
opposite of what needed to happen if

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.550 
opposite of what needed to happen if
anything<00:01:15.640> they<00:01:15.790> need<00:01:16.030> a<00:01:16.060> buff<00:01:16.480> the<00:01:17.140> submachine

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
anything they need a buff the submachine

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.560 
anything they need a buff the submachine
guns<00:01:17.920> and<00:01:18.160> nerf<00:01:18.370> the<00:01:18.640> light<00:01:18.820> machine<00:01:19.210> guns<00:01:19.390> and

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.130 
a couple of assault rifles I don't
really<00:01:22.030> have<00:01:22.180> too<00:01:22.360> many<00:01:22.480> problems<00:01:22.690> with<00:01:23.050> the

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
really have too many problems with the

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.920 
really have too many problems with the
sigh<00:01:23.290> rifles<00:01:23.770> I<00:01:23.950> do<00:01:24.430> however<00:01:24.880> think<00:01:25.270> the<00:01:25.660> light

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
sigh rifles I do however think the light

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:27.750 
sigh rifles I do however think the light
machine<00:01:26.350> guns<00:01:26.560> every<00:01:27.010> single<00:01:27.310> one<00:01:27.460> of<00:01:27.550> the

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:27.760 
machine guns every single one of the

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.810 
machine guns every single one of the
light<00:01:27.940> machine<00:01:28.300> guns<00:01:28.510> needs<00:01:29.350> added<00:01:30.250> recoil

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:30.820 
light machine guns needs added recoil

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.690 
light machine guns needs added recoil
and<00:01:31.150> also<00:01:32.080> I<00:01:32.320> think<00:01:32.710> they<00:01:33.100> need<00:01:33.280> to<00:01:33.400> take<00:01:33.550> the

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
and also I think they need to take the

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.150 
and also I think they need to take the
target<00:01:34.060> finder<00:01:34.300> option<00:01:35.260> off<00:01:35.470> any<00:01:35.830> of<00:01:35.950> the

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:36.160 
target finder option off any of the

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.260 
target finder option off any of the
light<00:01:36.340> machine<00:01:36.700> guns<00:01:36.850> because<00:01:37.030> that

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
light machine guns because that

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.300 
light machine guns because that
combination<00:01:37.780> is<00:01:38.200> just<00:01:38.470> almost<00:01:38.710> unbeatable

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
combination is just almost unbeatable

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.030 
combination is just almost unbeatable
once<00:01:40.270> somebody's<00:01:40.720> already<00:01:40.930> aiming<00:01:41.920> down

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040 
once somebody's already aiming down

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.270 
once somebody's already aiming down
sights<00:01:42.100> and<00:01:42.880> its<00:01:43.480> really<00:01:44.080> frustrating<00:01:44.440> and<00:01:44.920> as

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
sights and its really frustrating and as

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.250 
sights and its really frustrating and as
you<00:01:45.460> see<00:01:45.700> right<00:01:45.730> here<00:01:46.060> in<00:01:46.150> the<00:01:46.240> video<00:01:46.480> I<00:01:46.750> die

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:47.260 
you see right here in the video I die

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.590 
you see right here in the video I die
one<00:01:47.950> or<00:01:48.070> two<00:01:48.220> off<00:01:48.400> a<00:01:48.610> swarm<00:01:48.970> in<00:01:49.120> this<00:01:49.270> game<00:01:49.450> play

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
one or two off a swarm in this game play

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.780 
one or two off a swarm in this game play
as<00:01:49.750> well<00:01:49.930> so<00:01:50.200> my<00:01:50.530> one<00:01:50.770> death<00:01:50.980> comes<00:01:51.280> literally

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
as well so my one death comes literally

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.020 
as well so my one death comes literally
at<00:01:52.030> the<00:01:52.600> worst<00:01:53.170> possible<00:01:53.350> time<00:01:54.160> it<00:01:54.670> could<00:01:54.910> have

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
at the worst possible time it could have

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.380 
at the worst possible time it could have
came<00:01:55.270> so<00:01:55.630> now<00:01:56.470> any<00:01:56.710> 149<00:01:57.520> kills<00:01:57.700> one<00:01:57.970> death<00:01:58.000> and

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
came so now any 149 kills one death and

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.050 
came so now any 149 kills one death and
I<00:01:58.930> die<00:01:58.990> one<00:01:59.320> offered<00:01:59.620> swarm<00:01:59.950> but<00:02:00.640> like<00:02:00.820> I<00:02:00.970> was

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
I die one offered swarm but like I was

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.380 
I die one offered swarm but like I was
saying<00:02:01.120> the<00:02:01.960> MSMC<00:02:02.860> and<00:02:03.190> PDW<00:02:03.790> were<00:02:03.910> nerve<00:02:04.120> and

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
saying the MSMC and PDW were nerve and

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.180 
saying the MSMC and PDW were nerve and
the<00:02:04.450> light<00:02:05.140> machine<00:02:05.500> guns<00:02:05.680> i<00:02:05.830> think<00:02:06.070> we're

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.190 
the light machine guns i think we're

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.880 
the light machine guns i think we're
buffed<00:02:06.430> i<00:02:06.700> don't<00:02:07.180> really<00:02:08.019> read<00:02:08.409> too<00:02:08.649> much<00:02:08.830> into

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
buffed i don't really read too much into

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.640 
buffed i don't really read too much into
the<00:02:09.429> details<00:02:09.610> but<00:02:10.000> since<00:02:10.899> the<00:02:11.080> patch<00:02:11.290> since

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
the details but since the patch since

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.820 
the details but since the patch since
the<00:02:11.890> PDW<00:02:12.670> is<00:02:12.790> nerfed<00:02:13.000> it's<00:02:13.269> almost<00:02:13.830> unusable

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
the PDW is nerfed it's almost unusable

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.729 
the PDW is nerfed it's almost unusable
now<00:02:15.280> and<00:02:15.580> the<00:02:16.330> reason<00:02:16.659> why<00:02:16.810> everybody<00:02:17.409> use<00:02:17.709> a

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
now and the reason why everybody use a

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:21.000 
now and the reason why everybody use a
PDW<00:02:18.240> it<00:02:19.240> was<00:02:19.420> not<00:02:19.600> overpowered<00:02:20.319> by<00:02:20.350> any<00:02:20.740> means

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
PDW it was not overpowered by any means

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.670 
PDW it was not overpowered by any means
i<00:02:21.130> know<00:02:21.220> a<00:02:21.310> lot<00:02:21.520> of<00:02:21.550> people<00:02:21.670> think<00:02:22.120> the

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
i know a lot of people think the

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.580 
i know a lot of people think the
GW<00:02:23.099> was<00:02:23.219> overpowered<00:02:23.969> but<00:02:24.480> it's<00:02:24.629> not<00:02:24.840> it<00:02:25.170> was

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
GW was overpowered but it's not it was

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.069 
GW was overpowered but it's not it was
overused<00:02:26.010> and<00:02:26.730> the<00:02:27.269> reason<00:02:27.689> why<00:02:27.810> it<00:02:27.870> was

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:28.079 
overused and the reason why it was

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:31.009 
overused and the reason why it was
overused<00:02:28.379> is<00:02:28.829> because<00:02:29.250> almost<00:02:30.090> every<00:02:30.480> person

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
overused is because almost every person

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:33.110 
overused is because almost every person

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.740 
war there's it's 9v9 it's not 66 and you
need<00:02:40.439> that<00:02:40.469> extra<00:02:41.040> ammunition<00:02:41.430> that<00:02:41.909> the<00:02:42.030> PDW

need that extra ammunition that the PDW

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.020 
need that extra ammunition that the PDW
has<00:02:42.989> so<00:02:43.709> you<00:02:43.769> don't<00:02:44.040> have<00:02:44.280> to<00:02:44.549> reload

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
has so you don't have to reload

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.039 
has so you don't have to reload
constantly<00:02:45.719> or<00:02:46.519> sacrifice<00:02:47.519> a<00:02:47.849> fast<00:02:48.629> reload

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049

speed<00:02:49.349> using<00:02:49.650> extended<00:02:50.370> mags<00:02:50.579> and<00:02:51.359> that's<00:02:51.629> why

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
speed using extended mags and that's why

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.990 
speed using extended mags and that's why
that's<00:02:52.290> literally<00:02:52.980> the<00:02:53.099> reason<00:02:53.819> why

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
that's literally the reason why

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.990 
that's literally the reason why
everybody<00:02:54.599> likes<00:02:54.870> using<00:02:55.079> the<00:02:55.409> PDW<00:02:56.069> it's<00:02:56.669> just

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
everybody likes using the PDW it's just

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.390 
everybody likes using the PDW it's just
so<00:02:57.209> when<00:02:57.810> you<00:02:57.900> get<00:02:58.079> in<00:02:58.230> those<00:02:58.379> situations<00:02:59.129> when

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
you're trying to win gun fights against

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:04.399 
you're trying to win gun fights against
four<00:03:02.310> people<00:03:02.760> in<00:03:02.819> a<00:03:02.879> row<00:03:03.090> before<00:03:03.810> you<00:03:04.109> have<00:03:04.260> to

reload<00:03:04.799> you<00:03:05.370> can<00:03:05.549> do<00:03:05.669> that<00:03:05.819> with<00:03:06.000> a<00:03:06.030> PDW<00:03:06.359> where

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
reload you can do that with a PDW where

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.589 
reload you can do that with a PDW where
is<00:03:07.109> as<00:03:07.560> if<00:03:08.189> you're<00:03:08.430> using<00:03:08.700> the<00:03:08.879> like<00:03:09.419> the

is as if you're using the like the

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:11.990 
is as if you're using the like the
vector<00:03:09.959> i'm<00:03:10.139> using<00:03:10.739> in<00:03:10.829> this<00:03:10.919> game<00:03:11.159> play<00:03:11.400> the

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
vector i'm using in this game play the

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.289 
vector i'm using in this game play the
vector<00:03:12.329> only<00:03:12.540> has<00:03:12.689> 36<00:03:13.639> rounds<00:03:14.639> which<00:03:14.849> is<00:03:15.060> about

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
vector only has 36 rounds which is about

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:17.539 
vector only has 36 rounds which is about
three<00:03:15.599> or<00:03:15.659> four<00:03:15.840> people<00:03:16.200> you<00:03:16.950> can<00:03:17.069> kill<00:03:17.310> but

to reload I run out of ammunition and
I'm<00:03:30.120> like<00:03:30.329> man<00:03:30.540> if<00:03:30.720> I<00:03:30.840> was<00:03:30.959> just<00:03:31.109> using<00:03:31.290> a<00:03:31.560> PDW<00:03:31.919> I

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
I'm like man if I was just using a PDW I

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.430 
I'm like man if I was just using a PDW I
could<00:03:32.489> have<00:03:32.579> picked<00:03:32.729> up<00:03:32.909> that<00:03:33.090> kill<00:03:33.419> got<00:03:34.199> my

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
could have picked up that kill got my

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.099 
could have picked up that kill got my
swarm<00:03:35.069> and<00:03:35.370> this<00:03:35.549> would<00:03:35.760> have<00:03:35.879> been<00:03:35.940> 840<00:03:36.900> kill

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109 
swarm and this would have been 840 kill

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:38.509 
swarm and this would have been 840 kill
gameplay<00:03:37.349> and<00:03:37.799> it's<00:03:38.189> just<00:03:38.340> really

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
gameplay and it's just really

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:40.039 
gameplay and it's just really
frustrating<00:03:38.729> sometimes<00:03:39.269> when<00:03:39.750> you<00:03:39.870> know<00:03:39.989> you

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
frustrating sometimes when you know you

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:42.229 
frustrating sometimes when you know you
don't<00:03:40.409> have<00:03:40.500> that<00:03:40.739> extra<00:03:41.189> ammunition<00:03:41.459> but<00:03:42.030> I

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.719 
don't have that extra ammunition but I
do<00:03:43.079> get<00:03:43.470> the<00:03:43.680> fact<00:03:43.919> that<00:03:44.010> people<00:03:44.400> don't<00:03:44.519> like

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:46.610 
do get the fact that people don't like

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:52.549 
not using the PDW anymore because this

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:56.089 
not using the PDW anymore because this
vector<00:03:53.549> is<00:03:53.909> my<00:03:54.180> new<00:03:54.509> favorite<00:03:55.259> some<00:03:55.739> machine

like<00:04:12.509> i<00:04:12.629> said<00:04:12.659> men<00:04:13.109> the<00:04:13.769> recent<00:04:14.220> patch<00:04:14.519> is<00:04:14.879> just

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
like i said men the recent patch is just

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.240 
like i said men the recent patch is just
absolutely<00:04:15.479> dumb<00:04:15.989> it<00:04:16.169> makes<00:04:16.320> no<00:04:16.530> sense<00:04:16.560> it<00:04:17.039> i

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
absolutely dumb it makes no sense it i

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.969 
absolutely dumb it makes no sense it i
think<00:04:17.489> it<00:04:17.609> just<00:04:17.639> gives<00:04:18.120> more<00:04:18.509> power<00:04:18.590> to<00:04:19.590> people

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 
think it just gives more power to people

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:23.390 
think it just gives more power to people
that<00:04:20.130> have<00:04:20.430> a<00:04:20.789> a<00:04:21.539> more<00:04:22.229> defensive<00:04:22.949> type<00:04:23.130> play

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
that have a a more defensive type play

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.870 
that have a a more defensive type play
style<00:04:23.759> a<00:04:23.970> more<00:04:24.479> campy<00:04:24.900> type<00:04:25.110> play<00:04:25.349> style<00:04:25.710> and<00:04:25.949> I

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
style a more campy type play style and I

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.570 
style a more campy type play style and I
just<00:04:27.180> really<00:04:27.690> think<00:04:28.080> that<00:04:28.440> some<00:04:29.070> machine<00:04:29.400> guns

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
just really think that some machine guns

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.000 
just really think that some machine guns
need<00:04:29.820> a<00:04:29.849> rebuff<00:04:30.479> so<00:04:31.110> people<00:04:31.500> actually<00:04:31.620> start
