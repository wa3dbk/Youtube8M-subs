is almost gone and I bought so few of
these<00:02:08.849> because<00:02:09.179> I<00:02:09.810> literally<00:02:10.709> don't<00:02:11.459> have<00:02:11.640> to

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
these because I literally don't have to

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:12.180 
these because I literally don't have to
buy

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
buy

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.070 
buy
that<00:02:12.340> often<00:02:12.520> because<00:02:12.730> they<00:02:12.970> just<00:02:13.120> last<00:02:13.390> so<00:02:13.750> so

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
that often because they just last so so

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.350 
that often because they just last so so
long<00:02:14.260> so<00:02:14.770> mine<00:02:15.070> was<00:02:15.490> getting<00:02:15.850> really<00:02:16.240> really

myself<00:02:19.540> right<00:02:19.870> now<00:02:19.900> but<00:02:20.590> it<00:02:20.680> was<00:02:20.740> getting

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
myself right now but it was getting

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.530 
myself right now but it was getting
super<00:02:21.280> dry<00:02:21.640> to<00:02:21.700> the<00:02:21.880> point<00:02:22.120> where<00:02:22.270> it<00:02:22.330> was<00:02:22.360> like

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
super dry to the point where it was like

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.120 
super dry to the point where it was like
kind<00:02:22.810> of<00:02:22.840> crumble<00:02:23.410> when<00:02:23.560> I<00:02:23.650> was<00:02:23.770> taking<00:02:23.920> my

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
kind of crumble when I was taking my

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.520 
kind of crumble when I was taking my
brush<00:02:24.370> in<00:02:24.400> and<00:02:24.730> like<00:02:24.910> mmm<00:02:25.570> this<00:02:26.050> isn't<00:02:26.350> good

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
brush in and like mmm this isn't good

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.200 
brush in and like mmm this isn't good
it's<00:02:26.740> time<00:02:26.920> for<00:02:27.070> some<00:02:27.190> aqua<00:02:27.430> seal<00:02:27.610> so<00:02:28.180> I

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.210 
it's time for some aqua seal so I

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:29.940 
it's time for some aqua seal so I
literally<00:02:28.570> think<00:02:28.780> I<00:02:28.930> put<00:02:29.110> two<00:02:29.350> drops<00:02:29.530> in<00:02:29.830> here

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
literally think I put two drops in here

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.950 
literally think I put two drops in here
maybe<00:02:30.520> three<00:02:31.030> but<00:02:31.060> three<00:02:31.390> is<00:02:31.420> kind<00:02:31.660> of<00:02:31.720> a<00:02:31.780> lot

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:31.960 
maybe three but three is kind of a lot

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.990 
maybe three but three is kind of a lot
and<00:02:32.260> then<00:02:32.830> took<00:02:33.010> my<00:02:33.070> little<00:02:33.370> brush<00:02:33.700> or<00:02:33.970> a

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
and then took my little brush or a

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.310 
and then took my little brush or a
spatula<00:02:34.270> or<00:02:34.540> something<00:02:34.900> I<00:02:34.960> can't<00:02:35.200> remember

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.320 
spatula or something I can't remember

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.550 
spatula or something I can't remember
and<00:02:35.620> stir<00:02:36.370> it<00:02:36.400> up<00:02:36.790> until<00:02:37.450> it's<00:02:37.930> a<00:02:38.020> nice<00:02:38.200> even

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
and stir it up until it's a nice even

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.680 
and stir it up until it's a nice even
consistency<00:02:39.280> and<00:02:39.580> it<00:02:39.700> is<00:02:39.790> completely<00:02:40.300> back<00:02:40.540> to

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
consistency and it is completely back to

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.140 
consistency and it is completely back to
life<00:02:40.870> it<00:02:41.410> has<00:02:41.620> that<00:02:41.800> shine<00:02:42.130> back<00:02:42.430> to<00:02:42.790> it<00:02:42.940> where

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
life it has that shine back to it where

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.730

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
to revive with these i probably will

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:50.710 
to revive with these i probably will
experiment<00:04:49.370> next<00:04:49.670> time<00:04:49.850> i<00:04:49.940> have<00:04:50.090> one<00:04:50.330> dry<00:04:50.570> out

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:50.720 
experiment next time i have one dry out

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.780 
experiment next time i have one dry out
cuz<00:04:50.900> that's<00:04:51.050> actually<00:04:51.470> that<00:04:52.250> would<00:04:52.400> be<00:04:52.550> really

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:52.790 
cuz that's actually that would be really

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:54.760 
cuz that's actually that would be really
really<00:04:52.910> cool<00:04:53.300> and<00:04:53.630> also<00:04:54.290> it<00:04:54.410> would<00:04:54.500> make<00:04:54.740> it

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:54.770 
really cool and also it would make it

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:57.670 
really cool and also it would make it
waterproof<00:04:55.220> if<00:04:55.700> it<00:04:55.910> wasn't<00:04:56.240> already<00:04:56.680> anyway

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
waterproof if it wasn't already anyway

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.080
