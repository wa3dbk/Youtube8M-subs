alive from some sort of counter push and
once<00:00:43.069> white<00:00:43.249> rod<00:00:43.460> gets<00:00:43.579> those<00:00:43.760> for<00:00:43.999> warp<00:00:44.239> dates

00:00:44.439 --> 00:00:44.449 
once white rod gets those for warp dates

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:45.759 
once white rod gets those for warp dates
up<00:00:44.629> that's<00:00:44.870> when<00:00:45.050> he<00:00:45.139> really<00:00:45.440> will<00:00:45.559> have<00:00:45.620> the
