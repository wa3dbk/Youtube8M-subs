00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.760
Hello, I’m Kurt Browning, Pasco superintendent
of schools.

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.080
I am so happy to welcome all of you to the
2014-2015 school year!

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.049
For many of you, it’s a welcome back.

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:12.870
For some of you, it’s a warm welcome to
the Pasco school district family.

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.250
We are glad to have you and I hope we make
you feel like a member of the family.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.520
I continue to tell school leaders and staff
that we must create a culture of caring and

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.390
respect in our schools and in the district.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.120
I want everyone to feel welcome here – parents,
students… and especially staff.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.040
A sense of belonging is important for everyone
to be successful.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.980
A sense of stability also is important for
an organization to move forward.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.600
After more than a year of significant transition,
I am happy to say that we don’t plan any

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.019
major changes this year.

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:48.979
We will focus on expanding the Florida Standards
to all grade levels, and providing the tools

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:54.609
you need to effectively deliver the instruction
that will help students meet these more difficult

00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:56.359
academic standards.

00:00:56.359 --> 00:01:01.110
If there is an area where we can improve our
supports, please let me know.

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.690
District staff and I need to hear from those
of you in the schools – on the ground – because

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.890
that’s where everything happens.

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.940
Part of implementing the new standards is
increased use of technology.

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.610
We are doing this several ways.

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.640
For instance, we are putting information like
the planner and Code of Conduct online.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.850
We are encouraging teachers to make better
use of the Canvas learning management system

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.610
to deliver online and blended learning opportunities.

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.750
We are using more project-based learning that
includes students using technology to solve

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.600
real-world problems.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.780
With increased use of technology comes the
responsibility to teach students about digital

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:43.230
citizenship, which promotes positive communication
and helps prevent problems like cyberbullying.

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:48.410
Another aspect of digital citizenship is the
need to emphasize academic integrity.

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:53.210
There is so much information in our digital
world for students to access to inform their

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.470
learning, but they must be careful how they
use it.

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.560
Technology also provides us with multiple
ways to communicate with parents, students,

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.110
and the community.

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.760
We encourage our schools to take advantage
of social media tools like Facebook and Twitter

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.920
to create two-way communication with students
and families.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:18.230
I encourage all of you to follow the district
on our Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram sites.

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.890
Communication is important within the school
system, too.

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.030
Something else I’ve been preaching since
day one is “servant leadership.”

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.900
We in the district offices are here to support
you.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.560
Not the other way around.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.569
I want principals to feel comfortable making
decisions about their schools.

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:34.170
Why shouldn’t they??

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.950
Principals know what works best for their
communities.

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.209
I want to remind principals, teachers, and
support staff that you can contact me any

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.569
time if you want to share an idea or concern.

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:47.680
If you think we can do something better, let
me know.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.319
We are working on an online suggestion box
that will be located in the Employees drop

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:55.270
down menu on the district homepage.

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:01.280
I want everyone to feel safe voicing their
opinions on things that affect them, the students,

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.040
or this district.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.990
That brings me to our current union negotiations.

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:10.760
We are working with the USEP on the new contract,
and we do have some significant matters we

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.430
need to agree on.

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.620
One is the district’s proposal to make all
of our campuses smoke-free.

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.380
More than half already are.

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.010
I just don’t think it sends the right message
to students if we teach them the dangers of

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.750
smoking tobacco, then they look out the window
and see people they respect smoking.

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.810
I welcome teacher feedback on this proposal.

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.140
I hope we can reach a compromise with the
union on this issue, but our top priority

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.709
is to come to agreement on raises.

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:43.660
Rewarding staff for their dedication to Pasco
students and their success is important to

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.550
me, and we are working diligently to make
that happen.

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:52.830
A well-compensated, professional staff is
essential in our quest to provide Pasco students

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.400
with a world-class education.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.370
Like I’ve said many times, “It’s all
about the students.”

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.370
That focus will be central as we continue
to develop a new vision and mission for the

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:04.370
district.

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:08.750
We are working on a new strategic plan, and
the first thing we are looking at is “Why

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:09.849
we exist.”

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:15.400
More than 150 stakeholders have participated
in focus group meetings and sessions to develop

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.910
a success plan.

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.940
There is more work to do and more input to
gather.

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.960
We hope to roll out our new vision and mission,
and the strategies, tactics and metrics we

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.840
identify to achieve success, before the end
of the first semester.

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.500
One thing is for certain: our teachers and
staff will be fundamental to that success.

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.801
I can’t thank you enough for dedicating
your time and talents to providing a world

00:04:39.801 --> 00:04:43.680
class education for every Pasco student.

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.070
Again, welcome to the 2014-15 school year!

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.530
I hope it’s fun, successful, and fulfilling!

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:49.710
Thank you.
