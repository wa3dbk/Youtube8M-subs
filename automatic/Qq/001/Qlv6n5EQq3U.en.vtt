is actually harder than either the

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.440 
is actually harder than either the
triple<00:01:15.830> toe<00:01:16.010> or<00:01:16.280> some<00:01:16.820> of<00:01:16.940> the<00:01:17.030> other<00:01:17.150> moves

and<00:01:17.720> that's<00:01:17.870> an<00:01:18.050> unusual<00:01:18.200> one<00:01:18.740> and<00:01:19.370> not<00:01:19.520> not

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790 
and that's an unusual one and not not

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.020 
and that's an unusual one and not not
often<00:01:20.330> seen<00:01:20.600> I<00:01:20.960> think<00:01:21.830> it<00:01:21.950> suits<00:01:22.160> this<00:01:22.490> music

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
often seen I think it suits this music

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.950 
often seen I think it suits this music
so<00:01:23.240> well<00:01:23.450> an<00:01:23.720> edge<00:01:23.930> compass<00:01:24.500> is<00:01:24.980> less<00:01:25.310> jarring

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
so well an edge compass is less jarring
