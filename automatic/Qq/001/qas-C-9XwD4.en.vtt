00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780 
tea cups one larger than the other a

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.969 
tea cups one larger than the other a
bright<00:05:02.500> yellow<00:05:02.740> one<00:05:03.550> and<00:05:03.900> a<00:05:04.900> bright<00:05:05.440> pink<00:05:05.680> one

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:05.979 
bright yellow one and a bright pink one

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:07.680 
bright yellow one and a bright pink one
and<00:05:06.280> when<00:05:06.430> you<00:05:06.520> turn<00:05:06.699> them<00:05:06.849> over<00:05:07.090> they<00:05:07.300> can<00:05:07.509> be

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:07.690 
and when you turn them over they can be

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:11.010 
and when you turn them over they can be
seats<00:05:08.050> and<00:05:08.639> there<00:05:09.639> are<00:05:09.789> six<00:05:10.090> playing<00:05:10.389> cards<00:05:10.870> so

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020 
seats and there are six playing cards so

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:12.689 
seats and there are six playing cards so
I<00:05:11.080> guess<00:05:11.259> you<00:05:11.440> can<00:05:11.590> really<00:05:11.800> make<00:05:11.979> two<00:05:12.220> tables

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:12.699 
I guess you can really make two tables

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:14.879 
I guess you can really make two tables
out<00:05:12.849> of<00:05:13.000> them<00:05:13.150> there's<00:05:13.539> also<00:05:13.720> a<00:05:13.900> full-length
