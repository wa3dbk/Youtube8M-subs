all<00:00:14.680> right<00:00:14.770> welcome<00:00:14.950> back<00:00:15.070> to<00:00:15.310> the<00:00:15.400> lab<00:00:15.580> we<00:00:16.480> are

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:16.510 
all right welcome back to the lab we are

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.450 
all right welcome back to the lab we are
studying<00:00:17.170> the<00:00:17.320> skeletal<00:00:17.800> system<00:00:18.090> and<00:00:19.090> today

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
studying the skeletal system and today

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.440 
studying the skeletal system and today
we're<00:00:21.460> gonna<00:00:21.520> go<00:00:21.700> through<00:00:21.880> the<00:00:21.940> axial

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:22.450 
we're gonna go through the axial

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:24.450 
we're gonna go through the axial
skeleton<00:00:22.960> now<00:00:23.320> the<00:00:23.380> axial<00:00:23.860> skeleton<00:00:23.980> we've

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:24.460 
skeleton now the axial skeleton we've

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.100 
skeleton now the axial skeleton we've
I've<00:00:25.060> been<00:00:25.360> through<00:00:25.600> the<00:00:25.690> appendicular

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:26.110 
I've been through the appendicular

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:30.990 
I've been through the appendicular
skeleton<00:00:27.119> in<00:00:28.119> another<00:00:28.450> video<00:00:28.720> I've<00:00:29.650> also<00:00:30.000> gone

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:31.000 
skeleton in another video I've also gone

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.290 
skeleton in another video I've also gone
through<00:00:31.060> the<00:00:32.730> skeletal<00:00:33.730> structure<00:00:34.120> of<00:00:34.150> the

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:34.300 
through the skeletal structure of the

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.780 
through the skeletal structure of the
skull<00:00:34.890> so<00:00:35.890> we're<00:00:36.040> finishing<00:00:36.310> up<00:00:36.520> here<00:00:36.640> with

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:36.790 
skull so we're finishing up here with

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
skull so we're finishing up here with
the<00:00:36.880> axial<00:00:37.300> skeleton<00:00:37.420> and<00:00:38.550> it<00:00:39.550> starts<00:00:40.180> with

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:40.810 
the axial skeleton and it starts with

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.229 
the axial skeleton and it starts with
the<00:00:40.990> top<00:00:41.170> of<00:00:41.380> the<00:00:41.650> spinal<00:00:41.950> column<00:00:42.239> these

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:43.239 
the top of the spinal column these

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:45.810 
the top of the spinal column these
vertebrae<00:00:44.230> that<00:00:44.890> make<00:00:45.100> up<00:00:45.250> the<00:00:45.370> neck<00:00:45.580> there

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:45.820 
vertebrae that make up the neck there

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.370 
vertebrae that make up the neck there
are<00:00:45.910> seven<00:00:46.270> of<00:00:46.360> them<00:00:46.420> are<00:00:46.690> known<00:00:46.900> as<00:00:47.050> cervical

are<00:00:57.100> seven<00:00:57.430> cervical<00:00:57.940> vertebrae<00:00:58.300> and<00:00:59.220> one<00:01:00.220> of

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:00.310 
are seven cervical vertebrae and one of

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:01.170 
are seven cervical vertebrae and one of
the<00:01:00.370> features<00:01:00.640> of<00:01:00.670> the<00:01:00.820> cervical<00:01:01.120> vertebrae

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:01.180 
the features of the cervical vertebrae

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.120 
the features of the cervical vertebrae
is<00:01:01.660> that<00:01:01.780> they<00:01:01.870> have<00:01:01.990> these<00:01:02.110> holes<00:01:02.440> in<00:01:02.860> the

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:03.130 
is that they have these holes in the

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.429 
is that they have these holes in the
transverse<00:01:03.550> process<00:01:04.059> process<00:01:04.900> called<00:01:05.350> the

00:01:05.429 --> 00:01:05.439 
transverse process process called the

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:08.340 
transverse process process called the
transverse<00:01:05.830> foramen<00:01:06.220> or<00:01:06.729> trans<00:01:07.689> plural<00:01:08.259> would

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
transverse foramen or trans plural would

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.800 
transverse foramen or trans plural would
be<00:01:08.500> feminine<00:01:09.070> and<00:01:09.450> these<00:01:10.450> transverse

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 
be feminine and these transverse

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.249 
be feminine and these transverse
processes<00:01:11.470> of<00:01:11.710> the<00:01:11.890> vertebrae<00:01:13.259> actually

00:01:14.249 --> 00:01:14.259 
processes of the vertebrae actually

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:16.560 
processes of the vertebrae actually
contain<00:01:14.920> a<00:01:14.950> blood<00:01:15.189> vessel<00:01:15.400> in<00:01:15.850> life<00:01:16.299> and

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 
contain a blood vessel in life and

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.270 
contain a blood vessel in life and
that's<00:01:16.689> what's<00:01:16.930> simulated<00:01:17.770> here<00:01:18.039> by<00:01:18.219> this

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
that's what's simulated here by this

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.249 
that's what's simulated here by this

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:55.539 
do things like press your tongue to the

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:57.569 
do things like press your tongue to the
roof<00:01:55.749> of<00:01:55.869> your<00:01:55.929> mouth<00:01:56.049> and<00:01:56.709> say<00:01:57.159> words<00:01:57.399> like

00:01:57.569 --> 00:01:57.579 
roof of your mouth and say words like

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:01.590 
roof of your mouth and say words like
tongue<00:01:59.490> on<00:02:00.490> the<00:02:00.609> back<00:02:00.819> the<00:02:01.090> vertebrae<00:02:01.420> have

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
tongue on the back the vertebrae have

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.679 
tongue on the back the vertebrae have
these<00:02:01.749> spinous<00:02:02.259> processes<00:02:03.359> and<00:02:04.359> the<00:02:04.479> whole

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:04.689 
these spinous processes and the whole

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:07.440 
these spinous processes and the whole
going<00:02:05.469> down<00:02:05.619> through<00:02:05.829> every<00:02:06.069> vertebra<00:02:06.459> down

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
going down through every vertebra down

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.300 
going down through every vertebra down
through<00:02:07.719> which<00:02:07.899> the<00:02:08.200> spinal<00:02:08.560> cord<00:02:08.770> passes<00:02:09.160> in

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
through which the spinal cord passes in

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.990 
through which the spinal cord passes in
life<00:02:09.490> is<00:02:09.700> known<00:02:09.970> as<00:02:10.090> the<00:02:10.209> vertebral<00:02:10.509> foramen

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
life is known as the vertebral foramen

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.130 
life is known as the vertebral foramen
so<00:02:13.000> these<00:02:13.150> are<00:02:13.300> the<00:02:13.390> seven<00:02:13.600> cervical

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
so these are the seven cervical

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.690 
so these are the seven cervical
vertebrae<00:02:14.500> and<00:02:14.650> again<00:02:14.830> we<00:02:14.980> know<00:02:15.160> them<00:02:15.370> because

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
vertebrae and again we know them because

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.280 
vertebrae and again we know them because
they're<00:02:15.880> the<00:02:16.000> neck<00:02:16.209> vertebrae<00:02:16.630> and<00:02:16.870> they're

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
they're the neck vertebrae and they're

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.070 
they're the neck vertebrae and they're
identifiable<00:02:17.980> by<00:02:18.130> their<00:02:18.569> foramina<00:02:19.569> in<00:02:19.780> the

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
identifiable by their foramina in the

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.449 
identifiable by their foramina in the
transverse<00:02:20.440> process<00:02:20.920> none<00:02:21.159> of<00:02:21.250> the<00:02:21.310> other

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459

vertebrae<00:02:21.909> in<00:02:22.120> the<00:02:22.209> body<00:02:22.390> have<00:02:22.659> that<00:02:23.670> then

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
vertebrae in the body have that then

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.290 
vertebrae in the body have that then
there<00:02:24.819> are<00:02:24.909> twelve<00:02:25.180> vertebrae

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
there are twelve vertebrae

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.240 
there are twelve vertebrae
that<00:02:26.870> our<00:02:26.990> thoracic<00:02:27.530> vertebrae<00:02:27.890> and<00:02:28.040> thoracic

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
that our thoracic vertebrae and thoracic

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.150 
that our thoracic vertebrae and thoracic
vertebrae<00:02:28.790> are<00:02:29.000> easily<00:02:29.330> identifiable

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
vertebrae are easily identifiable

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.220 
vertebrae are easily identifiable
because<00:02:31.160> of<00:02:31.460> the<00:02:32.030> sort<00:02:32.330> of<00:02:32.360> downward<00:02:32.870> pointing

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
because of the sort of downward pointing

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.000 
because of the sort of downward pointing
spinous<00:02:33.950> process<00:02:34.810> and<00:02:35.810> even<00:02:36.350> the<00:02:36.530> the<00:02:36.560> early

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
spinous process and even the the early

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.530 
spinous process and even the the early
ones<00:02:37.190> that<00:02:37.370> don't<00:02:37.490> have<00:02:37.790> that<00:02:37.820> they<00:02:38.360> all

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
ones that don't have that they all

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.600 
ones that don't have that they all
articulate<00:02:39.110> with<00:02:39.230> ribs<00:02:39.530> so<00:02:40.100> there<00:02:40.250> are<00:02:40.340> twelve

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
articulate with ribs so there are twelve

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.030 
articulate with ribs so there are twelve
ribs<00:02:40.910> on<00:02:41.090> each<00:02:41.240> side<00:02:41.540> twenty-four<00:02:42.380> ribs<00:02:42.650> in

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
ribs on each side twenty-four ribs in

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:49.390 
ribs on each side twenty-four ribs in
all<00:02:43.280> of<00:02:44.000> these<00:02:44.870> ribs<00:02:47.590> the<00:02:48.590> first<00:02:48.890> few<00:02:49.130> ribs

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
all of these ribs the first few ribs

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.330 
all of these ribs the first few ribs
actually<00:02:50.270> articulate<00:02:50.870> directly<00:02:51.440> rib<00:02:51.740> to<00:02:52.310> a

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
actually articulate directly rib to a

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:53.890 
actually articulate directly rib to a
piece<00:02:52.550> of<00:02:52.670> cartilage<00:02:53.000> you<00:02:53.330> can<00:02:53.570> sort<00:02:53.750> of<00:02:53.780> see

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
piece of cartilage you can sort of see

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.300 
piece of cartilage you can sort of see
the<00:02:53.930> depression<00:02:54.500> here<00:02:54.680> on<00:02:54.800> the<00:02:54.920> model<00:02:55.190> that's

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
the depression here on the model that's

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:56.860 
the depression here on the model that's
supposed<00:02:55.580> to<00:02:55.610> represent<00:02:55.670> cartilage<00:02:56.480> here<00:02:56.750> and

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
supposed to represent cartilage here and

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.930 
supposed to represent cartilage here and
this<00:02:57.200> is<00:02:57.320> supposed<00:02:57.530> to<00:02:57.560> be<00:02:57.650> bone<00:02:57.950> it's<00:02:58.700> kind<00:02:58.910> of

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
this is supposed to be bone it's kind of

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.430 
this is supposed to be bone it's kind of
cheap<00:02:59.150> they<00:02:59.300> use<00:02:59.450> one<00:02:59.630> kind<00:02:59.750> of<00:02:59.870> plastic<00:03:00.290> and

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
cheap they use one kind of plastic and

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.810 
cheap they use one kind of plastic and
then<00:03:00.950> the<00:03:01.040> breastbone<00:03:01.370> the<00:03:01.730> sternum<00:03:02.150> here<00:03:03.820> the

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:11.830 
gladiolus and xiphoid process at the
sternum<00:03:09.580> so<00:03:10.580> these<00:03:10.940> first<00:03:11.150> ribs<00:03:11.450> are<00:03:11.600> true

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.470 
sternum so these first ribs are true
ribs<00:03:12.130> they<00:03:13.130> go<00:03:13.310> bone<00:03:13.730> to<00:03:14.390> cartilage<00:03:14.870> to<00:03:15.770> bone

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
ribs they go bone to cartilage to bone

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.940 
ribs they go bone to cartilage to bone
but<00:03:17.480> when<00:03:17.630> we<00:03:17.720> get<00:03:17.810> down<00:03:17.990> here<00:03:18.290> we<00:03:18.500> call<00:03:18.710> these

but when we get down here we call these

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.540 
but when we get down here we call these
ribs<00:03:19.340> false<00:03:20.270> ribs<00:03:20.540> because<00:03:20.990> it<00:03:21.110> goes<00:03:21.230> bone

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:21.550 
ribs false ribs because it goes bone

cartilage<00:03:25.100> see<00:03:26.060> how<00:03:26.150> this<00:03:26.330> connection<00:03:26.630> occurs

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:26.960 
cartilage see how this connection occurs

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:31.449 
cartilage see how this connection occurs
here<00:03:27.170> and<00:03:27.850> then<00:03:28.850> to<00:03:29.000> bone<00:03:29.739> if<00:03:30.739> you<00:03:30.830> go<00:03:30.950> down<00:03:31.160> far

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
here and then to bone if you go down far

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:36.850 
here and then to bone if you go down far
enough<00:03:32.590> you<00:03:33.590> actually<00:03:33.860> see<00:03:34.010> a<00:03:34.040> kind<00:03:34.340> of<00:03:34.459> rib<00:03:35.860> at

okay they have large thick bodies

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:19.780 
okay they have large thick bodies
because<00:04:18.590> they<00:04:18.620> support<00:04:19.130> the<00:04:19.340> weight<00:04:19.520> of<00:04:19.549> the

we'll<00:04:43.339> go<00:04:43.460> ahead<00:04:43.550> and<00:04:43.669> look<00:04:43.849> at<00:04:43.939> that<00:04:44.059> from<00:04:44.180> the

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
we'll go ahead and look at that from the

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:48.939 
we'll go ahead and look at that from the
dorsal<00:04:44.539> side<00:04:47.050> with<00:04:48.050> the<00:04:48.169> sacrum<00:04:48.589> here<00:04:48.619> which

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:48.949 
dorsal side with the sacrum here which

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:51.040 
dorsal side with the sacrum here which
formed<00:04:49.369> originally<00:04:50.059> from<00:04:50.509> fused<00:04:50.960> vertebrae

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.050 
formed originally from fused vertebrae

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:52.480 
formed originally from fused vertebrae
and<00:04:51.619> we're<00:04:51.770> showing<00:04:51.919> how<00:04:52.129> the<00:04:52.189> nerves

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490 
and we're showing how the nerves

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:54.369 
and we're showing how the nerves
actually<00:04:53.119> come<00:04:53.270> out<00:04:53.300> these<00:04:53.629> four<00:04:53.930> M&amp;O<00:04:54.229> these

00:04:54.369 --> 00:04:54.379 
actually come out these four M&amp;O these

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:56.709 
actually come out these four M&amp;O these
holes<00:04:54.680> in<00:04:54.949> the<00:04:55.069> sacrum<00:04:55.430> and<00:04:55.580> then<00:04:56.180> the<00:04:56.449> bottom

00:04:56.709 --> 00:04:56.719 
holes in the sacrum and then the bottom

00:04:56.719 --> 00:04:59.139 
holes in the sacrum and then the bottom

00:06:37.839 --> 00:06:37.849 
scapula scapula is the shoulder blade

00:06:37.849 --> 00:06:40.029 
scapula scapula is the shoulder blade
here's<00:06:38.599> the<00:06:38.809> spine<00:06:39.169> of<00:06:39.349> the<00:06:39.439> scapula<00:06:39.800> it's

00:06:40.029 --> 00:06:40.039 
here's the spine of the scapula it's

00:06:40.039 --> 00:06:43.540 
here's the spine of the scapula it's
blade<00:06:40.399> and<00:06:40.719> then<00:06:41.719> from<00:06:42.050> the<00:06:42.139> front<00:06:42.430> with<00:06:43.430> this

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:43.550 
blade and then from the front with this

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:45.459 
blade and then from the front with this
and<00:06:43.879> lateral<00:06:44.629> sides<00:06:44.809> we<00:06:44.990> can<00:06:45.139> see<00:06:45.259> a<00:06:45.289> few

00:06:45.459 --> 00:06:45.469 
and lateral sides we can see a few

00:06:45.469 --> 00:06:47.799 
and lateral sides we can see a few
structures<00:06:45.889> this<00:06:46.459> one<00:06:46.639> right<00:06:46.759> here<00:06:47.089> is<00:06:47.599> the

00:06:47.799 --> 00:06:47.809 
structures this one right here is the

00:06:47.809 --> 00:06:49.959 
structures this one right here is the
glenoid<00:06:48.199> cavity<00:06:48.349> okay<00:06:49.159> not<00:06:49.339> this<00:06:49.519> middle<00:06:49.819> part

00:06:49.959 --> 00:06:49.969 
glenoid cavity okay not this middle part

00:06:49.969 --> 00:06:52.239 
glenoid cavity okay not this middle part
but<00:06:50.269> this<00:06:50.419> slightly<00:06:50.719> hollow<00:06:51.079> point<00:06:51.499> where<00:06:52.099> the

00:06:52.239 --> 00:06:52.249 
but this slightly hollow point where the

00:06:52.249 --> 00:06:54.189 
but this slightly hollow point where the
head<00:06:52.399> of<00:06:52.430> the<00:06:52.579> humerus<00:06:52.999> are

00:06:54.189 --> 00:06:54.199 
head of the humerus are

00:06:54.199 --> 00:06:56.889 
head of the humerus are
to<00:06:54.619> form<00:06:54.800> a<00:06:54.889> ball-and-socket<00:06:55.339> joint<00:06:56.119> and<00:06:56.360> then

00:06:56.889 --> 00:06:56.899 
to form a ball-and-socket joint and then

00:06:56.899 --> 00:06:59.350 
to form a ball-and-socket joint and then
up<00:06:57.199> at<00:06:57.379> the<00:06:57.409> top<00:06:57.679> here<00:06:57.710> the<00:06:58.429> very<00:06:58.610> top<00:06:58.969> most

00:06:59.350 --> 00:06:59.360 
up at the top here the very top most

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:02.260 
up at the top here the very top most
process<00:06:59.960> is<00:07:00.229> the<00:07:00.800> acromion<00:07:01.429> process<00:07:01.460> it's<00:07:02.209> the

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:02.270 
process is the acromion process it's the

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:03.939 
process is the acromion process it's the
one<00:07:02.449> on<00:07:02.479> which<00:07:02.719> the<00:07:02.869> shoulder<00:07:03.169> pads<00:07:03.379> would<00:07:03.649> sit

00:07:03.939 --> 00:07:03.949 
one on which the shoulder pads would sit

00:07:03.949 --> 00:07:06.070 
one on which the shoulder pads would sit
and<00:07:04.129> then<00:07:05.029> this<00:07:05.209> one<00:07:05.449> is<00:07:05.629> known<00:07:05.839> as<00:07:05.899> the

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:06.080 
and then this one is known as the

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:08.709 
and then this one is known as the
coracoid<00:07:06.529> process<00:07:07.129> if<00:07:07.639> I<00:07:07.759> turn<00:07:07.969> this<00:07:08.179> just<00:07:08.629> the

00:07:08.709 --> 00:07:08.719 
coracoid process if I turn this just the

00:07:08.719 --> 00:07:11.019 
coracoid process if I turn this just the
right<00:07:08.899> angle<00:07:08.929> you<00:07:09.919> can<00:07:10.099> see<00:07:10.129> that<00:07:10.550> the

00:07:11.019 --> 00:07:11.029 
right angle you can see that the

00:07:11.029 --> 00:07:13.419 
right angle you can see that the
coracoid<00:07:11.479> process<00:07:11.990> actually<00:07:12.199> resembles<00:07:12.830> the

00:07:13.419 --> 00:07:13.429 
coracoid process actually resembles the

00:07:13.429 --> 00:07:16.600 
coracoid process actually resembles the
wing<00:07:13.699> and<00:07:13.999> head<00:07:14.659> of<00:07:14.929> a<00:07:15.169> bird<00:07:15.439> or<00:07:15.709> Raven<00:07:16.339> and

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:16.610 
wing and head of a bird or Raven and

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:20.260 
wing and head of a bird or Raven and
that's<00:07:17.330> what<00:07:17.479> that<00:07:17.629> means<00:07:17.869> in<00:07:18.740> Latin<00:07:19.270> so

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:20.270 
that's what that means in Latin so

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:22.839 
that's what that means in Latin so
that's<00:07:20.509> your<00:07:20.689> axial<00:07:21.169> skeleton<00:07:21.709> I<00:07:21.889> hope<00:07:22.699> this

00:07:22.839 --> 00:07:22.849 
that's your axial skeleton I hope this

00:07:22.849 --> 00:07:25.809 
that's your axial skeleton I hope this
video<00:07:23.149> is<00:07:23.539> of<00:07:23.749> some<00:07:23.929> help<00:07:24.139> to<00:07:24.199> you<00:07:24.439> and<00:07:24.819> that

00:07:25.809 --> 00:07:25.819 
video is of some help to you and that

00:07:25.819 --> 00:07:28.629 
video is of some help to you and that
you<00:07:25.939> do<00:07:26.059> well<00:07:26.209> at<00:07:26.270> your<00:07:26.360> studies
