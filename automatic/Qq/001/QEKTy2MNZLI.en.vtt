00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.490 
Nexus 4 point 2 point 2 you'll notice
that<00:01:30.090> it<00:01:30.329> won't<00:01:30.540> move<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.960> touch<00:01:31.140> response

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
that it won't move the touch response

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.590 
that it won't move the touch response
isn't<00:01:31.680> as<00:01:31.920> good<00:01:32.040> so<00:01:32.280> they've<00:01:32.430> upgraded<00:01:32.640> the

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
isn't as good so they've upgraded the

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.090 
isn't as good so they've upgraded the
touch<00:01:33.900> driver<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:34.619> it<00:01:34.710> just<00:01:34.920> makes

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
touch driver and it just makes

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.710 
touch driver and it just makes
everything<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.670> lot<00:01:35.850> more<00:01:35.909> speedy<00:01:36.390> a<00:01:36.509> lot

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
everything a lot more speedy a lot

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.200 
everything a lot more speedy a lot
quicker<00:01:37.310> in<00:01:38.310> terms<00:01:38.610> of<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.850> overall

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
quicker in terms of the overall

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.600 
quicker in terms of the overall
performance<00:01:40.020> again<00:01:40.560> I<00:01:40.590> think<00:01:40.770> I've<00:01:41.100> noticed

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
performance again I think I've noticed

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.069 
performance again I think I've noticed
an<00:01:41.790> improvement<00:01:41.880> there<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.630> apps<00:01:42.810> are

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
an improvement there the apps are

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.200 
an improvement there the apps are
opening<00:01:43.530> just<00:01:44.100> that<00:01:44.250> little<00:01:44.399> bit<00:01:44.579> quicker<00:01:44.880> and

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
opening just that little bit quicker and

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.700 
opening just that little bit quicker and
just<00:01:45.360> that<00:01:45.450> little<00:01:45.570> bit<00:01:45.720> snappier<00:01:46.200> that<00:01:46.470> could

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
just that little bit snappier that could

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.380 
just that little bit snappier that could
also<00:01:46.860> be<00:01:47.040> due<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.460> that<00:01:47.610> touch<00:01:47.820> driver<00:01:48.149> as<00:01:48.360> well

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
also be due to that touch driver as well

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.480 
also be due to that touch driver as well
but<00:01:48.960> we<00:01:49.079> do<00:01:49.229> have<00:01:49.380> a<00:01:49.439> new<00:01:49.649> kernel<00:01:49.860> version<00:01:50.310> but

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
but we do have a new kernel version but

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.639 
but we do have a new kernel version but
all<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.880> apps<00:01:51.030> just<00:01:51.180> seemed<00:01:51.479> to<00:01:51.689> fly<00:01:52.409> open

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
all the apps just seemed to fly open

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.770 
all the apps just seemed to fly open
scrolling<00:01:53.579> in<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:53.820> apps<00:01:53.939> also<00:01:54.180> seems<00:01:54.570> to<00:01:54.659> be

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
scrolling in the apps also seems to be

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.600 
scrolling in the apps also seems to be
very<00:01:54.810> smooth<00:01:55.380> at<00:01:55.530> bit<00:01:55.890> smoother<00:01:56.280> than<00:01:56.369> it<00:01:56.430> was

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
very smooth at bit smoother than it was

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.789 
very smooth at bit smoother than it was
in<00:01:56.640> four<00:01:56.939> point<00:01:57.119> two<00:01:57.210> point<00:01:57.360> two<00:01:57.479> so<00:01:58.409> it's

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
in four point two point two so it's

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.560 
in four point two point two so it's
definitely<00:01:59.250> worth<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.670> update<00:01:59.969> I'm<00:02:00.180> really

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
definitely worth the update I'm really

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.080 
definitely worth the update I'm really
happy<00:02:00.780> with<00:02:00.990> Android<00:02:01.290> 4.3<00:02:01.740> I<00:02:02.159> know<00:02:02.460> a<00:02:02.850> lot<00:02:03.060> of

I show you the result you can see here

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:55.820 
I show you the result you can see here
didn't<00:02:54.780> score<00:02:55.050> particularly<00:02:55.680> high

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830

didn't score particularly high
definitely<00:02:56.370> nowhere<00:02:56.550> near<00:02:56.760> what<00:02:57.030> we<00:02:57.090> were
