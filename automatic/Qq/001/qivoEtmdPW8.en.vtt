this<00:02:29.099> game<00:02:29.280> I<00:02:29.489> get<00:02:30.120> wish<00:02:30.269> this<00:02:30.540> game<00:02:30.750> would<00:02:30.780> be

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
this game I get wish this game would be

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:35.809 
this game I get wish this game would be
better<00:02:31.170> if<00:02:31.349> you<00:02:31.380> had<00:02:31.470> Ninja<00:02:31.890> Pro<00:02:34.519> if<00:02:35.519> you<00:02:35.700> had

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
better if you had Ninja Pro if you had

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:37.750 
better if you had Ninja Pro if you had
Ninja<00:02:36.150> Pro<00:02:36.420> sorry<00:02:36.959> I<00:02:37.049> shot<00:02:37.230> it<00:02:37.379> in<00:02:37.470> the<00:02:37.530> death

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
Ninja Pro sorry I shot it in the death

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.750 
Ninja Pro sorry I shot it in the death
because<00:02:38.760> then<00:02:39.090> people<00:02:39.239> can't<00:02:39.569> sound<00:02:39.780> for<00:02:40.079> you

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
because then people can't sound for you

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.680 
because then people can't sound for you
but<00:02:41.760> I<00:02:41.790> guess<00:02:41.970> that's<00:02:42.120> what<00:02:42.359> makes<00:02:42.510> the<00:02:42.660> game

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
but I guess that's what makes the game

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.599 
but I guess that's what makes the game
good<00:02:43.819> and<00:02:44.819> that's<00:02:44.940> why<00:02:45.060> I<00:02:45.090> always<00:02:45.209> got<00:02:45.510> to<00:02:45.540> walk

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:46.609 
good and that's why I always got to walk

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:49.340 
good and that's why I always got to walk
so<00:02:47.609> be<00:02:47.760> put<00:02:47.940> can<00:02:48.090> sound<00:02:48.329> for<00:02:48.840> me<00:02:48.989> this<00:02:49.200> is<00:02:49.319> very
