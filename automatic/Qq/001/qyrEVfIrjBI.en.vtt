run through some of that for you yeah
great<00:00:44.980> starting<00:00:45.980> from<00:00:46.130> the<00:00:46.250> front<00:00:46.490> moving

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:46.700 
great starting from the front moving

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.580 
great starting from the front moving
back<00:00:47.000> we<00:00:47.240> have<00:00:47.390> a<00:00:47.420> new<00:00:47.570> cover<00:00:47.840> plate<00:00:48.170> on<00:00:48.200> here

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:48.590 
back we have a new cover plate on here

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.260 
back we have a new cover plate on here
that<00:00:48.620> not<00:00:49.010> only<00:00:49.190> is<00:00:49.430> a<00:00:49.640> good<00:00:49.880> looking<00:00:50.150> of

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
that not only is a good looking of

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:51.940 
that not only is a good looking of
course<00:00:50.510> but<00:00:50.750> it's<00:00:50.870> also<00:00:50.990> doubles<00:00:51.500> over<00:00:51.620> as<00:00:51.860> an

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:51.950 
course but it's also doubles over as an

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:53.860 
course but it's also doubles over as an
anti-slip<00:00:52.370> surface<00:00:52.600> everything<00:00:53.600> you<00:00:53.690> see

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
anti-slip surface everything you see

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.510 
anti-slip surface everything you see
here<00:00:54.050> is<00:00:54.110> an<00:00:54.200> anti-slip<00:00:54.710> getting<00:00:55.100> off<00:00:55.220> and<00:00:55.430> on

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 
here is an anti-slip getting off and on

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.190 
here is an anti-slip getting off and on
a<00:00:55.550> zero<00:00:55.880> turn<00:00:56.090> mower<00:00:56.360> particularly<00:00:56.989> if<00:00:57.079> it's

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:57.200 
a zero turn mower particularly if it's

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.020 
a zero turn mower particularly if it's
wet<00:00:57.380> outside<00:00:57.530> we<00:00:58.250> don't<00:00:58.400> want<00:00:58.520> people<00:00:58.610> to<00:00:58.850> fall

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
wet outside we don't want people to fall

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.030 
wet outside we don't want people to fall
down<00:00:59.210> and<00:00:59.420> and<00:00:59.570> hurt<00:00:59.930> themselves<00:01:00.140> that<00:01:00.890> was<00:01:01.010> a

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:01.040 
down and and hurt themselves that was a

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.329 
down and and hurt themselves that was a
key<00:01:01.430> point<00:01:02.230> we<00:01:03.230> maintain<00:01:03.649> our<00:01:03.680> tube<00:01:04.040> style

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
key point we maintain our tube style

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:06.550 
key point we maintain our tube style
chassis<00:01:04.640> arrangement<00:01:05.390> rather<00:01:06.020> than<00:01:06.140> going<00:01:06.350> to

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
chassis arrangement rather than going to

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.040 
chassis arrangement rather than going to
a<00:01:06.590> lesser<00:01:06.979> expensive<00:01:07.280> stamp<00:01:07.790> chassis<00:01:08.330> having

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.050 
a lesser expensive stamp chassis having

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.260 
a lesser expensive stamp chassis having
a<00:01:09.140> tube<00:01:09.350> style<00:01:09.590> chassis<00:01:10.250> that<00:01:10.430> gives<00:01:10.970> us<00:01:11.090> one

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
a tube style chassis that gives us one

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.899 
a tube style chassis that gives us one
distinct<00:01:12.050> advantage<00:01:12.110> in<00:01:12.680> that<00:01:12.740> I<00:01:13.159> have<00:01:13.520> access

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:13.909 
distinct advantage in that I have access

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:19.620 
distinct advantage in that I have access
to<00:01:13.970> my<00:01:14.290> deck<00:01:15.290> from<00:01:15.530> the<00:01:15.620> top<00:01:15.830> side

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.440 

when<00:01:20.630> you<00:01:20.720> go<00:01:20.810> to<00:01:20.869> a<00:01:20.930> lesser<00:01:21.670> cost<00:01:22.670> stamped

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
when you go to a lesser cost stamped

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.539 
when you go to a lesser cost stamped
chassis<00:01:24.049> for<00:01:24.170> instance<00:01:24.470> that<00:01:24.649> whole<00:01:24.920> top<00:01:25.220> end

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:25.549 
chassis for instance that whole top end

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:27.429 
chassis for instance that whole top end
is<00:01:25.670> solid<00:01:26.329> you<00:01:26.420> can't<00:01:26.689> get<00:01:26.840> at<00:01:26.960> the<00:01:27.079> top<00:01:27.229> you

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 
is solid you can't get at the top you

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:29.350 
is solid you can't get at the top you
can't<00:01:27.649> clean<00:01:27.920> the<00:01:28.039> graph<00:01:28.250> so<00:01:28.520> you<00:01:28.759> can't<00:01:29.240> get

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
can't clean the graph so you can't get

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.510 
can't clean the graph so you can't get
the<00:01:29.570> greasers<00:01:30.020> grease<00:01:30.829> nipples<00:01:31.189> and<00:01:31.310> things

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
the greasers grease nipples and things

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.999 
the greasers grease nipples and things
like<00:01:31.729> that<00:01:31.939> this<00:01:32.720> is<00:01:32.780> a<00:01:32.930> big<00:01:33.110> big<00:01:33.320> advantage<00:01:33.439> oh

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 
like that this is a big big advantage oh

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:35.529 
like that this is a big big advantage oh
yeah<00:01:34.460> I<00:01:34.490> can<00:01:34.759> definitely<00:01:34.850> see<00:01:35.210> for

00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:35.539 
yeah I can definitely see for

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:40.840 
yeah I can definitely see for
maintenance<00:01:36.470> what<00:01:37.009> a<00:01:37.039> great<00:01:37.250> idea<00:01:39.850> moving

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
maintenance what a great idea moving

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.560 
maintenance what a great idea moving
over<00:01:41.210> to<00:01:41.329> the<00:01:41.450> left<00:01:41.630> side<00:01:43.179> we've<00:01:44.179> always<00:01:44.360> had<00:01:44.539> a

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
over to the left side we've always had a

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.600 
over to the left side we've always had a
great<00:01:44.869> deck<00:01:45.289> lift<00:01:45.530> system<00:01:45.920> it's<00:01:46.250> always<00:01:46.460> been

scattering light all over the place it's

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.630 
scattering light all over the place it's
a<00:04:12.010> big<00:04:12.190> feature<00:04:12.400> for<00:04:12.730> 2015<00:04:13.660> as<00:04:13.810> LED<00:04:14.170> lights<00:04:14.640> and
