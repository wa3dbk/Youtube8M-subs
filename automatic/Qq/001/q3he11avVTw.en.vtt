00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.190
 batista70phone friends to here we are 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.750
 noticed that in the package he had 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.939
 the lucio house in fact played to recover it 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:22.680
 on the fly there was also the doc for ours 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:25.170
 asus transformer pad tf 701 t therefore 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.210
 we immediately have it fitted 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.949
 started fiddling with it to see what it was like 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.640
 done then we come first in the meantime 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.640
 we close like this 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.579
 we also turn off the display and have the 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.170
 our nice 10 inch notebook and one 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.210
 then on this side we have a 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.420
 entrance to the venues and here we have 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.100
 usb 3.0 input 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.989
 therefore less than the community to proceed 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.539
 we can connect any one 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.559
 accessory a mouse what is that 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.059
 what we want 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.899
 from this part entrance to 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:57.629
 the power supply and obviously there is the 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:00.239
 light to see that he is in charge a lot 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.859
 comfortable ergonomic non-slip 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.719
 we have the feet below that 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.270
 allow you to have a great grip on 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:09.750
 any type of surface has 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.820
 a range of about 4 hours and a weight 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.250
 of 570 grams and the dimensions 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.370
 they are practically the same as the tablet 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:20.190
 only that the thickness reduced to 7 mm 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.850
 instead of 8 mm 8 like the tablet if not 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.160
 I remember badly 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.490
 the combination of the two leads to a 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:28.230
 weight of about 1,100 35 grams 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.660
 I must say that it is not even high 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:32.900
 absolutely very fast we go 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:36.990
 to see the moment we open up 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:39.870
 also starts the display now I try to 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.270
 we have all the different keys inside 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:46.740
 home trust control key function 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.640
 wifi food show for direct access to 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.500
 Internet 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.420
 I'm practically on the keyboard 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.040
 without touching the tablet we have the 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.409
 possibility to control it 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.659
 quietly the ergonomics of the keys 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.120
 very good we have the separate keys that 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:03.120
 contain allow you to type in 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:06.509
 very fast and without 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:10.509
 jams as you see here appears the 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:14.310
 cursor through the pet then for example if 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:16.569
 let's go on the internet a disappeared king 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.120
 disappear the icon is fine no problem 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:22.090
 I am stupid because I have it here and 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.580
 I can access from here I'll show you 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.900
 than with the use of the two 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.739
 fingers on the web we can scroll the 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.410
 screen right now is 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:34.239
 loading a problem is ok or in 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.580
 load the video review then or the 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:37.930
 wifi a little busy does nothing no 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.140
 problem let's see for example 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:43.180
 this program is called super lot 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:46.450
 here I already have a set page I was 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:50.910
 making tests and we can see 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:55.299
 that writing is really very good 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:58.329
 like good writing 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:03:00.250
 oh well this and afro turkish Indochinese 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:02.680
 however as you can see write 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.959
 very easily I told you 20 keys of 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.630
 access eg settings button 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:08.380
 back to the home I told you the key 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.120
 Internet 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.190
 meanwhile he has decided to 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.980
 charge then we can also see 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:17.650
 that with this movement we can 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.630
 scroll the screen a lot but a lot 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.910
 comfortable and then we go back to the 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.590
 home screen 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.880
 and then the rest are the keys that 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.709
 you know is not that I have to explain to you 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.810
 how the keyboard works I would say not 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:30.459
 the keys are also obvious here 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.889
 music for the reproduction of 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:35.739
 music put the mood up 

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:38.440
 in short, lower a brightness all 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:40.989
 comfort and a notebook but in the 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:45.010
 size of a 10-inch tablet e 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:46.750
 1 and a very low weight of 1135 g 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:50.760
 with this concluded below by loris alias 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.760
