00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:14.820
 on frandroid presentation of the liquid is 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.770
 serene I am with them thanks to him I 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.900
 evoked then marketing at acer for 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.910
 the part the smartphones so 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.130
 actually germain the liquid s100 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.240
 all newly announced since 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.050
 computex from Taiwan 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.640
 a few days ago but what is 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.430
 you can tell us about the arts and 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:36.030
 technical testing of this new new 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.930
 competitors galaxy note mean that 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.340
 somewhere 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.870
 so that's the screen size that goes 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.370
 to make sure that people will probably 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.579
 associate it with a galaxy note 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.480
 the price will allow them to surrender 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.610
 that it's not necessarily a 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.559
 galaxy competitor actually notes 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.469
 the first notable feature of 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:55.969
 this product the acer liquid s100 this is the 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:58.770
 screen size 5.7 inches diagonal 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:02.190
 it is very big it allows an excellent 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:05.369
 reading comfort of navigation one gets 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:12.299
 so find it very easily on 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:14.930
 a page web page we navigate with 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.009
 a very good reading comfort and that's it 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.210
 also on support what can I 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.210
 talking to you about the internet you mention that 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.310
 the liquid s100 is 42 megabits 100 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.369
 compatible with offers h + or from to 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.130
 career in all countries and on all 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.600
 networks so what gives for for 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.790
 people who want to compare that by 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.680
 example an internet connection gives a 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.750
 downlink so download 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.369
 direct from 1 mega second canton capturing 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.229
 in 42 megabits which accor as it is the 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.229
 case here with the little h more in 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:48.720
 when I saw exactly 3g + 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.549
 I was also faced with vanves to see 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.960
 so the sensory buttons on the bottom 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.930
 which allow to open the 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.640
 multitasking manager go back to 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.710
 main menu point home screen 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.049
 and the return key that brings us to 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.540
 the prince and previous screen we will see 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.110
 in camara also the front camera 2 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.420
 megapixel 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.360
 small peculiarity she is great 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.960
 angle of 90 degrees so that we have 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.090
 we see we see a lot of things 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:18.140
 I'm going into a front career of a 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:20.000
 spectrum so we see very well very very 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.640
 big the bibitte the device would have 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.360
 still dirty con is so a camera 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:29.470
 back to continue on on the camera 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:31.850
 of 8 megapixels with a flash led 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:35.420
 we are quite clean on the back we have a 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:38.540
 soft texture to that gripping that is 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.460
 then associated with a brushed aluminum 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.440
 on slices of agreement which allows a 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.340
 product strengthening so it does not 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.400
 not treat when you hold in your hand 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:50.210
 they do not weaken it gives grip 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.980
 obviously too and all this turns 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:53.680
 so on the latest hybrid version 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:58.070
 almost four points of jelly bean 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:00.860
 also on a quad core processor of 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:04.970
 the media library brand for currencies 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:09.110
 65 89 89 t mercier the turbo so there is 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:10.850
 the giguÃ¨re bag is a cortex arm a7 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.940
 that's what you have to say if in addition to 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:15.440
 720p screen a very good battery and 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.970
 a battery of which 2400 million earth 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.290
 which means that in addition we have a very 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.390
 good battery life like 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.250
 autonomy since today so we 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:23.390
 is on a prototype here he goes again 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.470
 Suitable for use in many small to make 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.530
 level of the rescuer even if it's already 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.760
 very fast very promising experience 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.050
 will only be better when we go out 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.940
 the mid August product 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.650
 did I want to tell you this is 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.420
 already we have done more than a day already 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.040
 with the product one is in two against 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:40.489
 active push mail and a lot of wii fit 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.470
 to pass a prototype season it's a 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:44.330
 prototype is exactly design but not 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.860
 against a totalized departure is going to have 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.350
 some changes on the buttons 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.720
 actually and on the top color 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:52.160
 from the circle to j 6 1 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.690
 we are going to go deep black we are 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.890
 on a clear black on here my 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.290
 services but in many colors y 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:59.450
 will have options for the back shell 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.890
 so many versions there will be 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.810
 possibility for the usl the user of 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.850
 change it obviously since it is 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.989
 she is removable know exactly I 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:06.950
 will throw me besides and like that it me 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:08.350
 will show you with the 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.519
 interesting feature of the product 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:13.190
 it's a product that is double micro 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:15.580
 sim a double double mic if he then 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.810
 here and so with a removable battery 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:20.479
 as I told you of 2400 billion 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:23.240
 thousands of voices and so the battery 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:26.540
 cover since the battery hull during 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:29.810
 little to exchange exquisite ok very 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:32.120
 easily that's it and happens I have 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.950
 not mentioned its price this product will be 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.919
 available 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:39.710
 bandaged from mid-August in France at a price 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:42.050
 less than 349 still working our 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:45.140
 price we promise it will be less 349 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:47.510
 euros yeah with sending the g8 2.24 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:50.419
 share points in eight months we have what 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:52.520
 of an interface very very comfortable in 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:54.440
 terms of nexus lake software in celebration 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.729
 so we're on an experiment that's 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.409
 very close to android when we do the 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:59.319
 double 

00:04:56.409 --> 00:05:02.169
 double slide down one to access 

00:04:59.319 --> 00:05:05.080
 fast to the settings here we have them 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:06.159
 notifications where it's interesting 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.709
 is that we still have 

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:10.330
 software improvements 

00:05:07.709 --> 00:05:12.189
 we have something within reach of 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.289
 liquid hand little worried very well 

00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:16.749
 appreciated by users 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:18.909
 it's the blur of koller so has a pop up 

00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:19.919
 which comes superimposed any 

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:21.819
 application in progress 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:23.649
 when we receive a call for not 

00:05:21.819 --> 00:05:25.959
 interrupt interrupt by my task in 

00:05:23.649 --> 00:05:27.580
 course also news about this 

00:05:25.959 --> 00:05:29.050
 screen because the screen is so big and 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.939
 that we can do a lot of 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:32.919
 things with a screen so big we come 

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:35.050
 implement what's called fleet apps 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:38.110
 it's an application girl here I 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:39.610
 shows you float menu shortcuts 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:40.259
 configurable obviously for 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:42.459
 the user 

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:45.489
 we change chrome we decided to change 

00:05:42.459 --> 00:05:47.499
 chrome here I put the blade was done 

00:05:45.489 --> 00:05:48.969
 is also four applications that do not 

00:05:47.499 --> 00:05:51.369
 are not customizable which are taxed 

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:52.569
 that they are four applications that 

00:05:51.369 --> 00:05:53.199
 come superimposed on any 

00:05:52.569 --> 00:05:55.719
 what application 

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:57.789
 here the camera just opened what I 

00:05:55.719 --> 00:05:59.829
 can I move that says I'm doing 

00:05:57.789 --> 00:06:01.449
 of rap shooting go full screen for 

00:05:59.829 --> 00:06:03.279
 cover the run even passing 

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:04.719
 can also launched a second I you 

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:07.629
 put an operator a little 

00:06:04.719 --> 00:06:09.729
 operation I reduced it to themselves 

00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:11.829
 quietly overlap with the 

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:13.329
 camera I make active camera and I 

00:06:11.829 --> 00:06:14.740
 all that in the bottom of the task that is 

00:06:13.329 --> 00:06:16.869
 still active also agree there are 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:18.669
 a video player with there is no player 

00:06:16.869 --> 00:06:19.689
 video is not afraid video by cons we 

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:20.619
 can play the video in full screen and 

00:06:19.689 --> 00:06:23.099
 do something else from 

00:06:20.619 --> 00:06:25.119
 hockey it's actually reversed 

00:06:23.099 --> 00:06:26.619
 will not be the video that will pop up 

00:06:25.119 --> 00:06:28.809
 will be the task equations are peaks 

00:06:26.619 --> 00:06:29.800
 to his integration who do that there is 

00:06:28.809 --> 00:06:30.849
 many things that exist now 

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.989
 where it's interesting is that 

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:32.519
 the entire screen area is 

00:06:31.989 --> 00:06:34.329
 active 

00:06:32.519 --> 00:06:35.889
 many people have made us their 

00:06:34.329 --> 00:06:37.629
 back by saying yes but then a 

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:38.139
 facebook conversation with small 

00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:41.379
 heads 

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:43.089
 the pop up does the same actually not because 

00:06:41.379 --> 00:06:45.309
 that when we move the pop-up area 

00:06:43.089 --> 00:06:46.479
 back is not it says if we have the 

00:06:45.309 --> 00:06:47.889
 possibility to continue to dig 

00:06:46.479 --> 00:06:49.389
 in his menus while the pop up and 

00:06:47.889 --> 00:06:52.119
 is active by bacon 

00:06:49.389 --> 00:06:53.190
 here I think I told you everything 

00:06:52.119 --> 00:06:57.090
 sometimes 

00:06:53.190 --> 00:07:00.350
 but what about design my daughter does not have 

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:02.850
 finalized but the spirit of the product is there 

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:05.190
 the materials are there it's more of a 

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:07.590
 finish all colors on the products 

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:11.550
 but otherwise the product is there and it will 

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:15.120
 ready for better in France ok ok I 

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:17.450
 thank you witness and the next will be 

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:17.450
 very soon
