00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:07.240
 hello very good today to enter 39 this 

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:09.129
 It is a video of the tournament of PK Paradise 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.500
 it's about my third fight really the 

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:13.270
 third round not third fight because 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.250
 in the first round I did not have time to 

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:17.500
 save the fight cut the connection my 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:20.050
 rival before that before he saves 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.690
 and the second round I could not fight 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:25.360
 because as I told in the video in which 

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:26.920
 explained how the tournament was not 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.390
 introduced my rival so I have to 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.550
 start directly by the third 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:33.129
 round I will not raise third fourth and fifth 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.539
 which are the ones I could play later and 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:36.610
 that I could record like that is that nothing 

00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:39.370
 first combat that I can climb is against 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:42.280
 adrián and apart from arriving chong are the 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:45.040
 broken guard I like it was useful 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.450
 a charizar and a bin ashur was 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.050
 totally sure that I'm going to start 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:53.010
 with them that's why I started with 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:56.160
 with salam itself with garzon to throw 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.360
 Bin Ashur and flare to pull the 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.460
 avalanche 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.660
 ariza but I was totally wrong 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.670
 even though I knew I was going to take out hero 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.949
 tactile also believed that he was going to take it out 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.020
 a little later not because you could see it 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.150
 it was going to be your mega yet I thought that 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.580
 I was going to take out the other two as 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.410
 main pokémons no 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.600
 and as you can see in the beginning of 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:17.780
 I fought because I swing a bit though 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.229
 I did not do anything wrong 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.700
 I protected myself with a sense of confidence, believing that 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:25.190
 I was going to attack directly with sugar chop 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:28.400
 to mine so I protected myself to avoid 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:31.369
 a dragon claw that then did not happen and 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.920
 pull with dragon ct a drake comet over 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:36.979
 his hook to get it out of the way so 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.770
 pass flying not running dies dies 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:43.399
 before you lied to me I was lucky 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.990
 because my alamense vitor is avalancha 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:48.500
 that could have left me quite 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.300
 pretty damaged although I have the band 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.860
 focus and could have endured not 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.140
 I had taken to the focus band and 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.090
 I would hold it if I had left 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.520
 even the most critical I would have 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.330
 left with one of life then inside 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.429
 of the bad 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.130
 luck there was not decisive either 

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:07.520
 because he made a bad choice to 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:10.310
 try to attack Garzón with the other 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.980
 hook with earthquake not 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.200
 watching seeing what was waiting for him 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.700
 to see seeing so much dragon decided to take 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.920
 to car the board and then it was when 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.510
 I said, this can not be, I can not leave 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.250
 there to my dragons that are weak 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.750
 against lagarde war it was very clear that 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.700
 I was going to do some kind of fairy attack 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.010
 so it was the pokemon's turn 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.560
 more defensive I was wearing in that 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.230
 moment they were broken that is defensive 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.660
 special and to help that although it's not 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.000
 self defense say you have 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.890
 cons to have a low blow not at all 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.959
 has got above all the hump 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.880
 already attack and with a little bit of luck 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:46.130
 Well, he endured the physical attack well 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.900
 of avalanche because I have already lowered two 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.360
 times with intimidation to tactile hero 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:53.480
 then it does not make me too much and the 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:56.060
 Attack generate good war 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.920
 we also hold it well even if it's 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:02.690
 fairy guy this is what we put up with 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:05.120
 well I do evolution does not love wild and there 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.920
 takes advantage of an earthquake to 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.660
 try to kill more wild thing than not 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.510
 get it because it has come down twice 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.640
 the broken attack is immune to me is not a 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.320
 pokémon that have to have break 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.330
 molds then to the mouse with his 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.330
 ability 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:22.120
 earthquake and is not able to kill me with 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:24.940
 garde guarama while and I take advantage 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:28.480
 first to leave quite damaged 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:31.240
 aerobatic with lightning and finalize pay 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:34.390
 the war with a single blow with head of 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:37.150
 iron and it's already out I've finished with the 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.800
 fairy with the anti dragons and nothing else 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.130
 that he has two pokemon left but that's not 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.150
 means that the combat is finished 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.010
 I take advantage that I know that he is going to attack me with 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.950
 finger aero to kill him with blow 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:51.220
 low even though I knew that that was the 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:54.070
 end of my mega was going for the insurance 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.930
 and that's what he did with my mega 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:57.910
 even so I took advantage of his last turn to 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.340
 leave you without active air and while 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:03.730
 I also took the opportunity to recover my life 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:05.380
 with rest and also wake up 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.630
 because I have it equipped with the fence 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:10.900
 that wakes me up is not the name in 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:14.280
 Castilian here is 6th barry but good 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.280
 I know that it wakes me up 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:19.989
 turn again of dragon center that does not 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:23.440
 It's good for nothing when the attack goes down 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:25.000
 but it's fine it's okay to tell you that 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.640
 tried to troll her a bit to see if 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.980
 an electrical attack was born and then 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:32.410
 to take him out, but he is wrong or not 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:35.350
 I know why he does attack me now in his 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:38.650
 rauda has broken and I try to make it 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:40.510
 game for everything but failed with hook 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.920
 I do avalanche and I do not know what would happen to 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:45.370
 poor kid by the head already would be 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.390
 nervous that makes lightning to me I'm 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.950
 of earth type 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:52.000
 you've already got nervous seeing that 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:54.970
 was left alone with one finished leaving it 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.830
 against the wall against fire 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:05:00.070
 fatuous and this time hitting and already with a 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:02.680
 claw dragon because it ended with the poor 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:04.240
 mouse that was also bright as the 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.810
 mine the truth is that the whole team all 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:08.760
 his team was brilliant 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:11.100
 and well the truth is that it was a combat 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:14.190
 pretty good could have changed 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:15.810
 much if in the beginning instead of 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:19.169
 attack me with earthquake would have made me 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:21.480
 a dragon war on envelope to the menso 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:22.980
 or would have hit me also in the 

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:26.070
 avalanche would have been 

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:28.410
 a painful blow for my team but at 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:29.940
 except that went well and I ended up with a 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:31.860
 victory good guys I hope you have 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:34.710
