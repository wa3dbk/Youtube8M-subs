00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:14.000 
put my new white Rogers 1f 85 to 77 in I

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.460 
put my new white Rogers 1f 85 to 77 in I
even<00:00:15.000> had<00:00:15.179> to<00:00:15.299> make<00:00:15.420> a<00:00:15.480> new<00:00:15.570> hole<00:00:15.960> in<00:00:16.199> the<00:00:16.289> wall

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
even had to make a new hole in the wall

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.910 
even had to make a new hole in the wall
for<00:00:16.500> this<00:00:16.920> but<00:00:17.310> I<00:00:17.340> just<00:00:17.430> didn't<00:00:18.390> care<00:00:18.630> and<00:00:19.080> I've

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
for this but I just didn't care and I've

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.550 
for this but I just didn't care and I've
got<00:00:20.130> plenty<00:00:20.400> of<00:00:21.920> plaster<00:00:22.920> and<00:00:23.510> extra<00:00:24.510> paint<00:00:24.779> so

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
got plenty of plaster and extra paint so

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.859 
got plenty of plaster and extra paint so
if<00:00:26.010> I<00:00:26.130> take<00:00:26.519> this<00:00:26.760> down<00:00:26.970> I<00:00:27.029> can<00:00:27.359> just<00:00:27.480> patch<00:00:27.660> the

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
if I take this down I can just patch the

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.490 
if I take this down I can just patch the
hole<00:00:27.990> anyway<00:00:28.289> so<00:00:29.189> I<00:00:29.220> put<00:00:29.730> it<00:00:29.849> in

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
hole anyway so I put it in

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.990 
hole anyway so I put it in
I'll<00:00:32.009> show<00:00:32.219> you<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.460> wiring<00:00:33.239> configuration

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.000 
I'll show you the wiring configuration

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.500 
I'll show you the wiring configuration
if<00:00:36.000> my<00:00:36.660> camera<00:00:37.170> will<00:00:37.320> focus<00:00:37.500> there<00:00:38.219> well<00:00:38.910> you

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
if my camera will focus there well you

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.810 
if my camera will focus there well you
can<00:00:39.660> probably<00:00:39.870> see<00:00:40.170> top<00:00:40.860> wire<00:00:41.160> there<00:00:41.489> is<00:00:41.520> the

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
can probably see top wire there is the

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.650 
can probably see top wire there is the
common<00:00:42.300> this<00:00:43.079> wire<00:00:43.410> that's<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.980> red<00:00:44.450> power

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
common this wire that's the red power

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.270 
common this wire that's the red power
that's<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.940> W<00:00:47.940> one<00:00:48.180> heat<00:00:48.690> stage<00:00:49.170> one<00:00:49.500> that's

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
that's the W one heat stage one that's

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.520 
that's the W one heat stage one that's
cool<00:00:50.670> stage<00:00:51.180> one<00:00:51.510> there's<00:00:51.690> only<00:00:51.870> one<00:00:52.110> stage<00:00:52.379> of

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
cool stage one there's only one stage of

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:59.779 
cool stage one there's only one stage of
cooling<00:00:53.449> fan<00:00:54.449> heat<00:00:55.199> stage<00:00:55.559> two<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:58.070> the<00:00:59.070> soon

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
cooling fan heat stage two and the soon

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.430 
cooling fan heat stage two and the soon
as<00:00:59.910> I<00:01:00.030> hooked<00:01:00.239> up<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.449> power<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:01.020> backlight

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
as I hooked up the power the backlight

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.380 
as I hooked up the power the backlight
came<00:01:01.739> on<00:01:01.980> because<00:01:02.190> I<00:01:02.489> believe<00:01:02.910> this<00:01:03.090> has<00:01:03.329> a

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
came on because I believe this has a

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.880 
came on because I believe this has a
constant<00:01:04.320> on<00:01:04.559> backlight<00:01:05.400> feature<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.890> now

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
constant on backlight feature and now

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.160 
constant on backlight feature and now
that<00:01:08.130> I've<00:01:08.250> showed<00:01:08.549> you<00:01:08.580> that<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.630> go<00:01:09.930> grab

the cover put it on do a quick demo I'll
show<00:01:15.000> you<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.299> setup<00:01:16.430> so<00:01:17.430> we<00:01:17.460> just<00:01:17.790> pop<00:01:18.450> it<00:01:18.659> on

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
show you the setup so we just pop it on

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.679 
show you the setup so we just pop it on
like<00:01:18.810> that<00:01:19.400> okay<00:01:20.630> so<00:01:21.630> what<00:01:22.500> you<00:01:22.650> do<00:01:23.390> to<00:01:24.390> set

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
like that okay so what you do to set

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.200 
like that okay so what you do to set
this<00:01:24.840> up<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:25.680> make<00:01:25.890> sure<00:01:26.070> it's<00:01:26.250> in<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.880> de

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
this up you make sure it's in the de

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.060 
this up you make sure it's in the de
mode<00:01:27.390> selections<00:01:27.960> off<00:01:28.200> and<00:01:28.500> you<00:01:28.590> press<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:28.860> up

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
and the down arrow at once so we have

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.810 
and the down arrow at once so we have
two<00:01:32.130> stage<00:01:32.460> has<00:01:32.850> two<00:01:33.210> stages<00:01:33.540> of<00:01:33.990> heat<00:01:34.490> so<00:01:35.490> we

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
two stage has two stages of heat so we

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.210 
two stage has two stages of heat so we
will<00:01:36.119> set<00:01:36.360> that<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.810> multi<00:01:37.259> stage<00:01:37.590> two<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.130> a

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
will set that to multi stage two and a

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.700 
will set that to multi stage two and a
scroll<00:01:38.520> through<00:01:38.790> you<00:01:38.970> press<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.390> mode<00:01:39.570> button

scroll through you press the mode button

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.990 
scroll through you press the mode button
so<00:01:40.710> I<00:01:40.740> have<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:41.009> set<00:01:41.220> to<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.430> five-day

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
so I have it set to the five-day

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.050 
so I have it set to the five-day
programming<00:01:42.630> feature<00:01:42.869> right<00:01:43.530> now<00:01:43.770> I<00:01:44.040> have<00:01:44.970> it

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
programming feature right now I have it

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.990 
programming feature right now I have it
set<00:01:45.299> to<00:01:45.329> two<00:01:45.600> program<00:01:46.079> periods<00:01:46.560> per<00:01:46.829> day<00:01:47.040> to

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
set to two program periods per day to

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.210 
set to two program periods per day to
our<00:01:48.180> hold<00:01:48.600> period<00:01:49.110> you<00:01:49.259> can<00:01:49.439> set<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.979> hold

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
our hold period you can set the hold

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.240 
our hold period you can set the hold
period<00:01:50.700> so<00:01:50.970> I<00:01:51.210> can<00:01:52.049> set<00:01:52.259> that<00:01:52.409> for<00:01:52.470> an<00:01:52.680> hour<00:01:52.799> two

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
period so I can set that for an hour two

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.130 
period so I can set that for an hour two
hours<00:01:53.700> which<00:01:54.060> comes<00:01:54.390> in<00:01:54.540> handy<00:01:54.570> if<00:01:54.960> your

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
hours which comes in handy if your

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.550 
hours which comes in handy if your
business<00:01:55.530> energy<00:01:55.770> management<00:01:56.340> recovery<00:01:56.969> I

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
business energy management recovery I

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.580 
business energy management recovery I
don't<00:01:58.560> use<00:01:58.770> that<00:01:59.240> so<00:02:00.240> because<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.079> system<00:02:01.439> up

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
don't use that so because the system up

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.139 
don't use that so because the system up
here<00:02:01.619> is<00:02:01.860> pretty<00:02:02.040> oversized<00:02:02.640> it<00:02:02.880> heats<00:02:03.030> up

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
here is pretty oversized it heats up

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.080 
here is pretty oversized it heats up
pretty<00:02:03.210> quick<00:02:03.659> so<00:02:03.689> I<00:02:03.840> don't<00:02:04.079> need<00:02:04.200> that<00:02:04.670> fast<00:02:05.670> I

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
pretty quick so I don't need that fast I

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.930 
pretty quick so I don't need that fast I
have<00:02:06.509> it<00:02:06.630> on<00:02:06.719> fast

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
have it on fast

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.430 
have it on fast
I'll<00:02:08.940> experiment<00:02:09.750> with<00:02:09.869> that<00:02:10.020> and<00:02:10.140> decide

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
I'll experiment with that and decide

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.860 
I'll experiment with that and decide
whether<00:02:10.709> I<00:02:10.830> want<00:02:11.129> fast<00:02:11.430> or<00:02:11.670> slow<00:02:11.879> with<00:02:12.120> the

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
whether I want fast or slow with the

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.899 
whether I want fast or slow with the
that<00:02:13.260> applies<00:02:13.590> to<00:02:13.620> the<00:02:14.099> heat<00:02:14.310> and<00:02:14.519> the<00:02:14.700> cool

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:14.909 
that applies to the heat and the cool

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:17.390 
that applies to the heat and the cool
modes<00:02:15.209> I<00:02:15.510> believe<00:02:16.379> because<00:02:16.950> it<00:02:17.129> shows<00:02:17.370> the

going to turn that off I don't really

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:53.900 
going to turn that off I don't really
need<00:02:52.500> that<00:02:52.560> because<00:02:52.859> the<00:02:53.010> system<00:02:53.400> heats

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910

use that and then the temperature limit
that's<00:03:15.629> the<00:03:15.870> heat<00:03:16.109> that's<00:03:16.980> the<00:03:17.250> cool<00:03:17.569> and<00:03:18.569> then

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:24.599 
that is actually for this I believe has

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:27.620 
that is actually for this I believe has
the<00:03:25.280> whatever<00:03:26.280> that<00:03:26.579> feature<00:03:26.819> is<00:03:27.120> called<00:03:27.389> the

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
the whatever that feature is called the

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.720 
the whatever that feature is called the
thing<00:03:27.840> where<00:03:28.049> you<00:03:28.169> have<00:03:28.440> a<00:03:28.470> fault<00:03:28.859> and<00:03:29.190> it

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
thing where you have a fault and it

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.879 
thing where you have a fault and it
sends<00:03:29.940> a<00:03:30.060> signal<00:03:30.269> to<00:03:30.480> the<00:03:30.569> thermostat<00:03:31.049> comfort

but this thing doesn't know that it's

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:19.159 
but this thing doesn't know that it's
not<00:04:17.820> like<00:04:18.000> Honeywell<00:04:18.299> where<00:04:18.599> you<00:04:18.690> can<00:04:18.870> set

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:54.660 
showed you pretty much everything for
the<00:04:53.380> hell<00:04:53.560> that<00:04:53.740> I'll<00:04:53.890> prove<00:04:54.130> you<00:04:54.190> that<00:04:54.400> the

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:54.670 
the hell that I'll prove you that the

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:57.660 
the hell that I'll prove you that the
condenser<00:04:54.970> is<00:04:55.180> running<00:04:56.190> probably<00:04:57.190> see<00:04:57.520> the

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:57.670 
condenser is running probably see the

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:00.620 
condenser is running probably see the
blades<00:04:57.910> turning<00:04:58.450> yeah<00:04:58.900> I<00:04:58.990> believe<00:04:59.320> you<00:04:59.440> can

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
blades turning yeah I believe you can

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:05.340 
blades turning yeah I believe you can
and<00:05:01.630> I<00:05:02.230> have<00:05:03.040> comfort<00:05:03.520> are<00:05:03.700> enabled<00:05:04.690> so<00:05:05.170> this

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:05.350 
and I have comfort are enabled so this

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.280 
and I have comfort are enabled so this
this<00:05:06.190> doesn't<00:05:06.430> start<00:05:06.790> blowing<00:05:07.000> a<00:05:07.390> full<00:05:07.810> volume

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:08.290 
this doesn't start blowing a full volume

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:10.440 
this doesn't start blowing a full volume
until<00:05:08.650> about<00:05:09.100> ten<00:05:09.400> minutes<00:05:09.550> into<00:05:09.910> the<00:05:10.000> cycle

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:10.450 
until about ten minutes into the cycle

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:12.210 
until about ten minutes into the cycle
so<00:05:10.630> it's<00:05:10.780> blowing<00:05:11.110> pretty<00:05:11.140> weak<00:05:11.560> right<00:05:11.590> now<00:05:11.830> I

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:12.220 
so it's blowing pretty weak right now I

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.070 
so it's blowing pretty weak right now I
don't<00:05:13.120> know<00:05:13.300> if<00:05:13.390> you<00:05:13.480> can<00:05:13.630> hear<00:05:13.840> the<00:05:13.930> wind

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 
don't know if you can hear the wind

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.670 
don't know if you can hear the wind
noise<00:05:14.320> or<00:05:14.530> not<00:05:15.600> and<00:05:16.600> I<00:05:16.690> have<00:05:16.720> the<00:05:17.200> system<00:05:17.650> set

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 
noise or not and I have the system set

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:22.820 
noise or not and I have the system set
to<00:05:18.100> 350<00:05:18.880> CFM<00:05:19.570> per<00:05:19.600> ton<00:05:20.230> so<00:05:20.740> it<00:05:20.980> runs<00:05:21.220> at<00:05:21.550> about

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.830 
to 350 CFM per ton so it runs at about

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.350 
to 350 CFM per ton so it runs at about
well<00:05:23.830> normally<00:05:24.340> twelve<00:05:24.640> I<00:05:24.820> think<00:05:25.060> it's<00:05:25.150> about

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 
well normally twelve I think it's about

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.990 
well normally twelve I think it's about
eleven<00:05:26.050> hundred<00:05:26.080> or<00:05:26.620> a<00:05:26.830> thousand<00:05:27.340> CFM<00:05:27.820> I

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 
eleven hundred or a thousand CFM I

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.300 
eleven hundred or a thousand CFM I
haven't<00:05:28.240> I<00:05:28.420> would<00:05:29.320> have<00:05:29.410> to<00:05:29.530> calculate<00:05:29.740> that

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:30.310 
haven't I would have to calculate that

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:33.260 
haven't I would have to calculate that
but<00:05:30.550> I'm<00:05:31.080> focusing<00:05:32.080> on<00:05:32.230> you<00:05:32.410> guys<00:05:32.590> right<00:05:32.950> now

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.270 
but I'm focusing on you guys right now

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:37.290 
but I'm focusing on you guys right now
anyway<00:05:35.190> um<00:05:36.190> I<00:05:36.280> think<00:05:36.670> I<00:05:36.820> covered<00:05:37.060> everything

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:37.300 
anyway um I think I covered everything

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:43.290 
anyway um I think I covered everything
for<00:05:37.870> this<00:05:37.960> for<00:05:38.860> this<00:05:39.010> moment<00:05:40.050> over<00:05:41.050> and<00:05:41.200> out
