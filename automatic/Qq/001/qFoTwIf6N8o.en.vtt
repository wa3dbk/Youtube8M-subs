00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:11.950
 Hmmm 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:17.560
 It is happy around today, isn't it water? 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:20.430
 Chapter 9 fear this time in that I please refer to the water supply in the blood 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:24.320
 Surely Tweed is technique 2 afterward 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.320
 It is the premiere visiting dog of the theater version 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:35.650
 4 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:40.150
 Yes, I 've seen the explanation form though 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:40.720
 I use the same mold as the shift speed prototype, which is also written 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:46.809
 I will 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:47.920
 That's just a different color, this is the appearance and the voice is Speed ​​Wild 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:50.690
 Technique 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.320
 I want is Chan type mix 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.850
 I will 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.840
 Let's take a look at that 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.290
 Yes 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:01.220
 The front is technique beer but speed couple is wild 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:04.820
 It is such a color ring 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:06.890
 The shape is exactly the same as the prototype 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:10.250
 It is the difference of coloring 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.750
 Yes the soft parts here are the same as the technique 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.930
 Hmm 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:17.500
 It is what Christmas looks like so say green red 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:21.150
 Recognition pin number 20 Yuichi 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:24.270
 Lameish people enter raw lodging 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:27.580
 The opening is the same specification as Jack 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.720
 And here is a prototype 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:35.130
 The difference between coloring and pattern 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:39.210
 But what is this and what purpose is this shift mother made? 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:42.230
 The kana before information Toka has to do also with the movie but I do not know because it does not look at all 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.230
 I feel like 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.030

 I 

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:18.250
 Yes More than voice I still have three speed wild techniques 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:23.650
 It is mixed voice Every time the trailer takes action instead of the three at the same time 

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:29.550
 It is a system that switches to a different voice Currently I do not know the appearance in the play a little 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:29.550
 But I think I want to take care as one collection item 

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:43.470
 After all we finally found 3 houses without changing in parallel at 10:00 am on July 11 release today 

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:43.470
 It would be nice to go over to the people you want
