that I could see myself driving and

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
people I know driving that wouldn't need

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.969 
people I know driving that wouldn't need
next<00:01:20.340> United<00:01:20.550> cos<00:01:20.820> it's<00:01:20.940> too<00:01:21.060> big<00:01:21.649> I'm<00:01:22.649> going

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
next United cos it's too big I'm going

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.490 
next United cos it's too big I'm going
for<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.280> fat<00:01:23.580> blocker<00:01:23.970> integra<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.600> lastly

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
for the fat blocker integra and lastly

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.440 
for the fat blocker integra and lastly
because<00:01:25.649> it's<00:01:25.950> just<00:01:26.160> such<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.340> great<00:01:26.640> looking

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
because it's just such a great looking

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.990 
because it's just such a great looking
little<00:01:27.869> little<00:01:28.320> car<00:01:28.500> and<00:01:28.770> that<00:01:29.520> makes<00:01:29.759> such<00:01:29.910> a

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
little little car and that makes such a

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.639 
little little car and that makes such a
change<00:01:30.180> from<00:01:30.420> Sayer<00:01:30.690> I<00:01:30.899> mean<00:01:31.050> in<00:01:31.229> recent<00:01:31.590> years

00:01:31.639 --> 00:01:31.649 
change from Sayer I mean in recent years

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:33.650 
change from Sayer I mean in recent years
we've<00:01:32.130> seen<00:01:32.369> some<00:01:32.490> awful<00:01:33.180> cars<00:01:33.360> from<00:01:33.509> them

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:33.660 
we've seen some awful cars from them

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.680 
we've seen some awful cars from them
they've<00:01:33.930> really<00:01:34.170> been<00:01:34.369> in<00:01:35.369> a<00:01:35.670> bad<00:01:35.880> place<00:01:36.149> from

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:36.690 
they've really been in a bad place from

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.389 
they've really been in a bad place from
a<00:01:36.750> design<00:01:36.869> perspective<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.710> I<00:01:37.800> think<00:01:38.009> we're

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:38.399 
a design perspective and I think we're

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:40.100 
a design perspective and I think we're
beginning<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.759> see<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.030> sort<00:01:39.810> of<00:01:39.869> green

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
beginning to see the sort of green

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.680 
beginning to see the sort of green
shoots<00:01:40.500> of<00:01:40.619> recovery<00:01:40.680> really<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:41.580> I<00:01:42.360> think

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 
shoots of recovery really and I think

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.480 
shoots of recovery really and I think
they've<00:01:43.289> got<00:01:43.380> a<00:01:43.410> great<00:01:43.530> designer<00:01:43.920> in<00:01:44.160> Luke

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
they've got a great designer in Luke

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.969 
they've got a great designer in Luke
danke<00:01:44.790> walk<00:01:44.940> and<00:01:45.119> there<00:01:45.540> I<00:01:45.840> think<00:01:46.350> you<00:01:46.830> know

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
danke walk and there I think you know

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.859 
danke walk and there I think you know
this<00:01:47.580> is<00:01:47.640> this<00:01:48.030> is<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.299> proof<00:01:48.510> that<00:01:48.570> there's

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
this is this is the proof that there's

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.039 
this is this is the proof that there's
some<00:01:48.990> great<00:01:49.080> looking<00:01:49.409> cars<00:01:49.590> going<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:50.010> that's

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 
some great looking cars going and that's

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:53.480 
some great looking cars going and that's
pretty<00:01:52.049> we've<00:01:52.590> been<00:01:52.710> lacking<00:01:52.860> I<00:01:53.070> think<00:01:53.250> entail

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
pretty we've been lacking I think entail

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.910 
pretty we've been lacking I think entail
I<00:01:53.790> like<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.390> Renault<00:01:54.840> Megane<00:01:55.170> concept<00:01:55.680> coupe

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
I like the Renault Megane concept coupe

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.380 
I like the Renault Megane concept coupe
a<00:01:56.040> concept<00:01:56.430> we're<00:01:57.030> going<00:01:57.119> to<00:01:57.210> see<00:01:57.299> the

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
a concept we're going to see the
