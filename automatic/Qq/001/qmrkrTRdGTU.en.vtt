 Good 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:18.449
 Yes, it's a drill, so today I used it to pick up the missing Akaishi 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.020
 I thought that plan ground mining would flow 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:25.870
 Time 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:31.090
 Since Well N overwhelming iron deficiency are something what Kyle are participating waiting confined to deer 

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:33.070
 Wait a minute, wait a minute, and hey, this bomb I'll wait there already 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:36.740
 I will give you something good 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:38.579
 Please wait-I am not incompetent or not or not or not or not 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:42.690
 b beauty 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:49.799
 Yes the chain seems to be used to cut wood 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:54.500
 For example why I thought I because I saw a little while ago Oh yeah green tree I either made now the first to wear 

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:54.500
 It's young trees over Ahahahahaha 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:02.600
 Give Up Heather necessarily say 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:06.229
 Fufu I cut the beautiful face from now on 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:12.380
 Diamond dispatch Uooh oh oh how many pieces 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:14.299
 5 or more or some Naa five if available ice ax and well-hoe was four I can make it is or 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.909
 I 'm grinding this time 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:20.230
 Refining 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:26.810
 If you put it in the automated Ueno smasher, you will be able to refine it 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:32.150
 Solar has been increased Solar Wah I'm stable but there are a number Solar yes 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:32.980
 Underground valley now bomb Magic guard from souvenir or museum sky of that lawn senior 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.980
 No 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:37.760
 Phew 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:42.320
 Somehow survive the Do not dangerous water or an order containing Mars 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:46.670
 I was given an empty calf for you and I was appointed for myself for the suicide bombers and for each special attack squadron 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:52.160
 I graduated from aa and came to get obsidian 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:53.970
 I also brought a diamond picker, so I got a lot of diamonds. Branch mining 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.380
 so 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.980
 I 'm disinfecting filth 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:03.310
 I will do a good look to see why 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:07.540
 I went to uh 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:11.980
 I will bring back the rest of the dream come true 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:15.910
 We go immediately Nether I, since it allows people to fuel 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:18.560
 Because there is a glow stone, the difference in the amount of closing 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:21.420
 Ain 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:27.140
 heavy 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:30.680
 Bad plank Oro Lolo Lolo RororoRoro feeling bad feelings 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:35.170
 I was not able to gate to a pretty good cousin 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:38.110
 Immediately Itadakima be Hiiiiiiii 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:40.030
 Dig at j You can stop it anymore 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.920
 Withdrawal withdrawal 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:45.050
 Hmm 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:48.850
 ua is still there 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.850
 Today is a pig 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:57.420
 That tofu bastard still in yon 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:03:04.020
 Fubutonyo Assault &amp; Recovery 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:07.980
 I'm waiting for a while, I'll wait, it hurts, it hurts. 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:10.080
 I'm coming in a hurry or I 'm scared I 'm scared that I'm scared I'll come on, I'll come 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.470
 Come hanging distance attack what seat discarded 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:17.940
 I've been there somewhere 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:21.750
 But don't hit it. 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:24.010
 It is an opportunity to say to the rubbish 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:29.680
 For more details please 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:35.439
 If you put something that does not fit into this feeling, you can scrap with a certain probability 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:38.890
 You can combine them to make a scrap box , but you can't make it, this time another 

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:42.460
 That's later that you use the opportunity 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:49.240
 I've been blanched about 3 hours 

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:50.760
 The machine I wanted to make this time is because the amount of money is so small and diamonds have been removed so much 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:56.629
 I can make it 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:56.629
 I think some people understand that it is a build craft opportunity 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:06.450
 Make a block of iron and combine it with a good iron 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:11.530
 It is good to make anvil 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:16.620
 Suitably installed this ce Nowa was surprised 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.620
 8 of diamonds ice axes repair c 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:24.410
 Names put of the Kaa Sonano car 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:28.170
 Oh was Uwabikkuri 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:32.270
 It is the first time to use anvil 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:32.270
 Here's a hidden gear made 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:37.770
 Combine this with a 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:44.060
 Good daughter-in- law, good radio 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:45.750
 Please spread this video to at least 10 people if you think next 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:51.990
 In comparatively Seriously 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:54.870
 I made a range marker. This determines the mining range of the open pit machine . 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:05:00.040
 Directly below the range specified by the end 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:07.080
 This time we dig only 16 times 16-1 chunks 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:12.229
 We made energy link We can drive open-air digging early with electricity with this 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:12.229
 Two early start fueled thermal power generator 

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:17.769
 Whoa See 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:26.350
 I made a substance manufacturing machine 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:30.160
 In matter made by the Hare Hoii generator material making machine 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:35.969
 In smelting iron as that compression to create a iridium 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:37.680
 Make an iridium plate and further from here a iridium plate 

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:40.820
 Alloy plate 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.820
 With carbon plate 

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:45.869
 There is also a misplacement 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:54.370
 By implanting this Nante Read I'll try it Well No, this here 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:06:00.560
 Industrial plate completed 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:06:02.740
 In a further development circuit alloy plate tempered glass solar panel to this 

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:05.740
 Advanced solar 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:07.620
 I did it, I'm watching everyone 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:11.820
 Uooh 

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:14.910
 Matter and glow stone what makes this 

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:16.330
 At the same What kettle and a high yellowtail one layer 

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:20.080
 Naa 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:23.560
 Ordinary solar 64 minutes is a shaggy tax 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:27.490
 Heh heh to Oh tired Seriously 

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:29.460
 Gonna over'm amazing increase to move early come to use it 

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:31.420
 maybe 

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:36.020
 Five 

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:40.310
 Which one is generated and used immediately 

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:44.780
 It's not so early but good 

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:48.639
 It is almost over in about 1 hour . 

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:52.090
 Was Chai chunk Hodoho' to mean that 

00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:59.240
 I am now equipped with a jet pack 

00:06:52.090 --> 00:07:02.000
 Because it can fly, it removes convenient block with all removal modes of convenient convenient simple construction machine 

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:05.780
 It is already over and is early 

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:10.940
 A half block is laid where I finished digging 

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:14.840
 By the way, now I'm digging out my yong champ and I'm digging mountain chan Kume at the time of recording 

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:18.730
 Where it did was but ene Zehnder's came to play 

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:18.730
 Wait a minute and the firepower is funny 

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:26.620
 by Scary Scary Scary Scary Scary Runaway Runaway Runaway Runaway Runaway Runaway Runaway 

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:29.340
 I took a ball that I defeated the major. 

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:29.340
 This control 

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:36.470
 me 

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:36.470
 me
