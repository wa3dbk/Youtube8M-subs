00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:06.790
 christian giménez and other leaders of 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.559
 blue cross will speak with the forward 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:10.990
 Fabián marked his nocturnal outings 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:13.270
 thus there will be no scolding and not 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:16.439
 will affect the blue cross team not because 

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:19.660
 we are going to talk to him really 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:21.730
 I believe that no longer 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:25.060
 It's very hard for me I do not like to talk 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:27.310
 a lot of things that happened because no no 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:30.100
 I know what really happened but what you 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:32.800
 I can say is that we try to 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:36.190
 the big people that are in the club 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.810
 tries to guide the best way to 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.820
 young boys 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.870
 and we are in charge of carrying this 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.120
 group forward 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.320
 they really are a group of iu I was in 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.170
 a club 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.239
 that is not fabian and christian frame 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.570
 giménez ni amaranto perea but is cross 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:55.920
 blue and we know that we have to be 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.870
 professionals from 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.290
 and believes that we get up until we 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.870
 we lay down 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:07.770
 but also our criterion is not 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:10.040
 that big people take charge and know 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.830
 the moments where we have to have 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.240
 say something or walk I think that 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.500
 is what is needed, there is no, there is no 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.820
 what to scold 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:23.920
 there are people who are young there are people who 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:27.910
 live life differently or think 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:29.410
 different football is your profession it 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:32.380
 can do many things always and 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:34.100
 when done on time and in the 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.320
 just moments 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.450
 but then it's up to us to try to 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.180
 route that because we know that 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.830
 we are in a very prestigious club and that 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.600
 we have to leave the name blue cross in 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.590
 High always frame is a player 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:50.780
 different 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.780
 for one or other things that he has had 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:56.020
 he is still a player of the best 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.640
 what's in Mexico I said in your 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.720
 moment 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:03.760
 today is in us brings try 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:06.520
 get the biggest juice I think 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.200
 he feels happy we 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.810
 we are happy with the arrival of him and 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.370
 I hope we can help a lot 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.900

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.060
