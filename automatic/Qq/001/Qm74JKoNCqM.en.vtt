show you guys that a little more of that

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.420 
show you guys that a little more of that
later<00:02:47.290> you<00:02:47.650> need<00:02:47.889> an<00:02:48.100> anchor<00:02:48.489> to<00:02:49.530> secure<00:02:50.530> the

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
later you need an anchor to secure the

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.150 
later you need an anchor to secure the
rope<00:02:51.639> and<00:02:51.850> it's<00:02:52.060> like<00:02:52.180> this<00:02:52.359> you<00:02:52.540> put<00:02:52.750> three

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
rope and it's like this you put three

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.270 
rope and it's like this you put three
suppose<00:02:54.160> stone<00:02:54.430> and<00:02:54.670> then<00:02:54.850> a<00:02:55.920> iron<00:02:56.920> to<00:02:57.010> get<00:02:57.160> on

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
suppose stone and then a iron to get on

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.240 
suppose stone and then a iron to get on
top<00:02:57.549> and<00:02:57.819> you<00:02:57.970> get<00:02:58.090> an<00:02:58.239> anchor<00:02:58.600> and<00:02:59.250> that's

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
top and you get an anchor and that's

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.780 
top and you get an anchor and that's
placeable<00:03:00.730> and<00:03:01.260> excellently<00:03:02.340> why<00:03:03.340> open<00:03:03.700> these

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
placeable and excellently why open these

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:10.099 
placeable and excellently why open these
doors<00:03:04.350> let<00:03:05.350> me<00:03:05.500> fly<00:03:05.859> over<00:03:06.430> to<00:03:06.819> this<00:03:08.370> and<00:03:09.370> let's

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:10.109 
doors let me fly over to this and let's

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:15.420 
doors let me fly over to this and let's
kill<00:03:11.109> the<00:03:11.200> power

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.050 

okay<00:03:16.640> a<00:03:17.470> anchor<00:03:18.470> is<00:03:18.710> used<00:03:19.190> you<00:03:19.730> can<00:03:19.820> make<00:03:19.970> an

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
okay a anchor is used you can make an

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.320 
okay a anchor is used you can make an
elevator<00:03:20.480> like<00:03:20.630> this<00:03:20.870> it<00:03:21.200> will<00:03:21.970> support<00:03:22.970> these

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330 
elevator like this it will support these

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.480 
elevator like this it will support these

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
block you guys showed you in the last

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.420 
block you guys showed you in the last
last<00:04:26.180> couple<00:04:26.780> episodes<00:04:26.840> and<00:04:27.500> that<00:04:28.190> is

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
last couple episodes and that is

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.730 
last couple episodes and that is
applying<00:04:28.940> power<00:04:29.300> to<00:04:29.660> the<00:04:29.750> pulley<00:04:30.020> which<00:04:30.470> acts

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
applying power to the pulley which acts

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.340 
applying power to the pulley which acts
as<00:04:30.890> a<00:04:30.919> brake<00:04:31.220> and<00:04:31.729> you<00:04:32.660> put<00:04:32.840> rope<00:04:33.050> in<00:04:33.229> the

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:33.350 
as a brake and you put rope in the

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:37.960 
as a brake and you put rope in the
pulley<00:04:33.590> and<00:04:34.270> one<00:04:35.270> it's<00:04:35.960> not<00:04:36.580> powered<00:04:37.580> using

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:37.970 
pulley and one it's not powered using

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:41.070 
pulley and one it's not powered using
like<00:04:38.900> a<00:04:38.930> windmill<00:04:39.350> or<00:04:39.560> waterwheel<00:04:40.280> it<00:04:40.550> will

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
like a windmill or waterwheel it will

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.530 
like a windmill or waterwheel it will
release<00:04:42.080> rope<00:04:42.830> to<00:04:43.130> drop<00:04:43.430> it<00:04:43.610> down<00:04:43.640> and<00:04:44.180> when<00:04:44.419> it

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:44.540 
release rope to drop it down and when it

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:47.280 
release rope to drop it down and when it
is<00:04:44.690> powered<00:04:45.229> with<00:04:45.500> a<00:04:46.490> windmill<00:04:46.850> it<00:04:47.090> will

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:47.290 
is powered with a windmill it will

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:50.950 
is powered with a windmill it will
retract<00:04:48.290> it<00:04:48.500> up<00:04:48.650> so<00:04:49.040> to<00:04:49.610> do<00:04:49.760> that<00:04:49.790> you<00:04:50.150> power<00:04:50.510> a

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
retract it up so to do that you power a

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.659 
retract it up so to do that you power a
gearbox<00:04:51.710> and<00:04:52.310> when<00:04:52.490> the<00:04:52.580> gearbox<00:04:53.000> is<00:04:53.300> powered

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:54.669 
gearbox and when the gearbox is powered

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:59.170 
gearbox and when the gearbox is powered
it<00:04:55.669> will<00:04:56.260> stop<00:04:57.260> it<00:04:58.070> will<00:04:58.280> stop<00:04:58.580> all<00:04:58.760> this<00:04:58.910> stuff

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
it will stop it will stop all this stuff

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.540 
it will stop it will stop all this stuff
from<00:04:59.360> all<00:04:59.720> the<00:05:00.110> power<00:05:00.320> from<00:05:00.470> continuing<00:05:01.070> past

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
from all the power from continuing past

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.469 
from all the power from continuing past
this<00:05:01.729> gearbox<00:05:02.200> so<00:05:03.200> that's<00:05:03.320> how<00:05:03.440> you<00:05:03.500> make<00:05:03.650> that

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:04.479 
this gearbox so that's how you make that

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:09.460 
this gearbox so that's how you make that
okay<00:05:05.479> so<00:05:05.540> I'll<00:05:06.380> show<00:05:07.040> you<00:05:07.130> guys<00:05:07.220> a<00:05:07.280> recipe<00:05:08.470> get

yep<00:06:05.500> just<00:06:05.919> like<00:06:06.040> this<00:06:06.280> very<00:06:06.520> slowly<00:06:07.140> except

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:08.140 
yep just like this very slowly except

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:10.409 
yep just like this very slowly except
for<00:06:08.260> that<00:06:08.320> part<00:06:08.500> and<00:06:08.740> it<00:06:09.070> raises<00:06:09.460> you<00:06:09.700> could

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:10.419 
for that part and it raises you could

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:14.310

lower<00:06:10.600> yourself<00:06:11.020> and<00:06:11.310> raise<00:06:12.310> yourself<00:06:13.169> so<00:06:14.169> if

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:14.320 
lower yourself and raise yourself so if

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:15.860 
lower yourself and raise yourself so if
that<00:06:14.530> would<00:06:14.680> figure<00:06:14.800> for<00:06:15.040> this<00:06:15.160> episode<00:06:15.820> guys
