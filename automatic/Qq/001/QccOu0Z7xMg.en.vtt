00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
had a comment on one of my videos there

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.350 
had a comment on one of my videos there
about<00:00:06.839> how<00:00:07.589> the<00:00:07.649> snowblower<00:00:08.460> is<00:00:08.760> run<00:00:08.970> off<00:00:09.150> the

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
about how the snowblower is run off the

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.570 
about how the snowblower is run off the
big<00:00:09.510> tractor<00:00:09.990> I'm<00:00:10.920> going<00:00:11.040> to<00:00:11.099> show<00:00:11.250> you<00:00:11.309> all

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
big tractor I'm going to show you all

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.580 
big tractor I'm going to show you all
the<00:00:11.730> Internet's<00:00:12.090> about<00:00:12.300> that<00:00:12.480> now<00:00:12.660> it's

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
the Internet's about that now it's

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.589 
the Internet's about that now it's
pretty<00:00:13.740> neat<00:00:13.920> how<00:00:14.070> they<00:00:14.190> did<00:00:14.309> it<00:00:14.490> let's<00:00:15.450> show

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
pretty neat how they did it let's show

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.760 
pretty neat how they did it let's show
you<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:15.809> front<00:00:16.080> here<00:00:16.289> first<00:00:17.090> there's

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:18.770 
you the front here first there's

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.840 
you the front here first there's
hydraulic<00:00:19.770> fittings<00:00:20.130> there<00:00:20.580> that<00:00:21.949> they<00:00:22.949> they

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
hydraulic fittings there that they they

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.000 
hydraulic fittings there that they they
just<00:00:23.880> run<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.269> chute<00:00:24.560> for<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.680> left<00:00:25.859> and

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
just run the chute for the left and

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.540 
just run the chute for the left and
right<00:00:26.189> of<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.789> chute

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:28.550 
right of the chute

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.950 
right of the chute
io2<00:00:29.550> thought<00:00:29.849> that<00:00:30.060> they<00:00:30.179> could<00:00:30.240> have<00:00:30.449> ran<00:00:30.630> the

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
io2 thought that they could have ran the

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.420 
io2 thought that they could have ran the
blower<00:00:31.199> off<00:00:31.470> of<00:00:31.619> these<00:00:31.710> but<00:00:31.920> apparently<00:00:32.309> it

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
blower off of these but apparently it

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.830 
blower off of these but apparently it
doesn't<00:00:32.579> put<00:00:32.880> out<00:00:32.969> enough<00:00:33.270> gallon<00:00:33.630> per<00:00:33.809> minute

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
doesn't put out enough gallon per minute

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.200 
doesn't put out enough gallon per minute
to<00:00:34.829> run<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.160> blower<00:00:35.370> enough<00:00:35.700> to<00:00:35.820> be<00:00:36.030> able<00:00:36.149> to

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
to run the blower enough to be able to

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.330 
to run the blower enough to be able to
blow<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.480> snow<00:00:36.540> far<00:00:36.870> enough<00:00:37.050> I<00:00:37.320> guess<00:00:38.040> that's

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
blow the snow far enough I guess that's

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.920 
blow the snow far enough I guess that's
mostly<00:00:38.730> meant<00:00:39.000> for<00:00:39.239> you<00:00:39.360> can<00:00:39.480> get<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.629> bucket

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
mostly meant for you can get the bucket

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.850 
mostly meant for you can get the bucket
on<00:00:40.050> this<00:00:40.230> too<00:00:40.469> that<00:00:40.829> has<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.960> it<00:00:42.960> splits<00:00:43.410> it

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
on this too that has the it splits it

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.010 
on this too that has the it splits it
splits<00:00:44.219> in<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.399> middle<00:00:44.700> there<00:00:44.850> so<00:00:45.030> that<00:00:45.899> you

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
splits in the middle there so that you

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.319 
splits in the middle there so that you
can<00:00:46.230> use<00:00:47.070> like<00:00:47.219> a<00:00:47.250> grapple<00:00:47.730> so<00:00:48.000> actually<00:00:48.300> I

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
can use like a grapple so actually I

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.600 
can use like a grapple so actually I
could<00:00:48.480> have<00:00:48.510> used<00:00:48.719> it<00:00:48.840> for<00:00:48.870> my<00:00:49.110> trees<00:00:49.410> here<00:00:49.800> and

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
could have used it for my trees here and

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.279 
could have used it for my trees here and
then<00:00:50.730> grab<00:00:50.910> them<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.300> just<00:00:51.510> gone<00:00:51.750> drove<00:00:52.199> away

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
then grab them and just gone drove away

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.139 
then grab them and just gone drove away
with<00:00:52.500> them<00:00:52.710> but<00:00:52.920> we<00:00:53.280> don't<00:00:53.430> have<00:00:53.550> that<00:00:53.730> feature

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
with them but we don't have that feature

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.290 
with them but we don't have that feature
so<00:00:55.280> anyhow<00:00:56.280> on<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.550> back<00:00:56.699> here<00:00:57.030> I'll<00:00:57.210> show<00:00:57.480> ya

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300 
so anyhow on the back here I'll show ya

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.520 
so anyhow on the back here I'll show ya
it's<00:01:00.300> kind<00:01:00.510> of<00:01:00.570> buried<00:01:00.840> right<00:01:01.140> now<00:01:01.320> it's

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
it's kind of buried right now it's

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.959 
it's kind of buried right now it's
easier<00:01:01.800> if<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:01.980> back<00:01:02.160> goes<00:01:02.399> off<00:01:02.550> I<00:01:02.670> could<00:01:02.820> show

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
easier if the back goes off I could show

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.770 
easier if the back goes off I could show
you<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.210> better<00:01:03.390> but<00:01:06.320> way<00:01:07.320> down<00:01:07.350> inside<00:01:08.130> there

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
you the better but way down inside there

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.940 
you the better but way down inside there
let's<00:01:09.780> see<00:01:09.869> if<00:01:09.930> I<00:01:09.990> can<00:01:10.080> get<00:01:10.170> underneath<00:01:10.560> shot

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
let's see if I can get underneath shot

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:11.480 
let's see if I can get underneath shot
too

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
too

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.560 
too
yeah<00:01:12.420> I<00:01:12.450> have<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:12.810> get<00:01:12.900> underneath<00:01:13.229> shot<00:01:14.570> okay

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
yeah I have to get underneath shot okay

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.880 
yeah I have to get underneath shot okay
let's<00:01:15.960> go<00:01:16.049> down<00:01:16.200> under<00:01:16.439> here

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.040 

okay<00:01:20.550> so<00:01:20.610> that<00:01:21.000> box<00:01:21.390> there<00:01:21.630> with<00:01:21.750> a<00:01:21.780> shaft

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:22.050 
okay so that box there with a shaft

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.290 
okay so that box there with a shaft
coming<00:01:22.410> out<00:01:22.560> of<00:01:22.680> it<00:01:22.800> that<00:01:23.670> drops<00:01:24.000> down<00:01:24.240> from

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:24.300 
coming out of it that drops down from

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:29.480 
coming out of it that drops down from
the<00:01:24.780> rear<00:01:24.990> pto<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:26.090> it<00:01:27.090> runs<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.480> shaft<00:01:28.490> all

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
the rear pto and it runs the shaft all

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:36.050 
the rear pto and it runs the shaft all
the<00:01:29.610> way<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.880> front<00:01:31.040> -<00:01:32.040> there<00:01:32.810> that<00:01:35.060> comes

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
the way to the front - there that comes

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.580 
the way to the front - there that comes
out<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.360> front<00:01:36.510> here<00:01:36.810> there's<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.020> big<00:01:37.140> bracket

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
out the front here there's a big bracket

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.110 
out the front here there's a big bracket
they<00:01:37.680> make<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.900> it's<00:01:39.900> got<00:01:40.080> the<00:01:40.820> cook<00:01:41.820> attach

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:42.120 
they make and it's got the cook attach

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.170 
they make and it's got the cook attach
fitting<00:01:42.600> therefore<00:01:42.780> for<00:01:43.650> the<00:01:44.000> shaft<00:01:45.000> that

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
fitting therefore for the shaft that

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.640 
fitting therefore for the shaft that
runs<00:01:45.330> from<00:01:45.540> here<00:01:45.870> and<00:01:46.050> then<00:01:46.140> eventually<00:01:46.350> up<00:01:46.620> to

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:46.650 
runs from here and then eventually up to

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:51.260 
runs from here and then eventually up to
the<00:01:46.979> to<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.310> blower<00:01:47.520> gearbox<00:01:48.080> so<00:01:49.080> that<00:01:50.270> runs

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
the to the blower gearbox so that runs

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.680 
the to the blower gearbox so that runs
at<00:01:51.479> about<00:01:51.540> a<00:01:52.820> very<00:01:53.820> good<00:01:54.000> clip<00:01:54.240> there<00:01:54.479> when

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 
at about a very good clip there when

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.960 
at about a very good clip there when
you're<00:01:54.840> going<00:01:55.020> so<00:01:55.440> I'll<00:01:56.100> fire<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.550> tractor<00:01:56.910> up

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
you're going so I'll fire the tractor up

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.219 
you're going so I'll fire the tractor up
here<00:01:57.119> I'll<00:01:57.210> turn<00:01:57.360> that<00:01:57.509> on<00:01:57.660> you<00:01:57.690> can<00:01:57.930> see<00:01:58.080> how

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
here I'll turn that on you can see how

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:32.449 
here I'll turn that on you can see how
that<00:01:58.290> runs

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.970 

yeah<00:02:33.459> so<00:02:33.760> that's<00:02:33.939> how<00:02:34.060> they<00:02:34.209> run<00:02:34.890> run<00:02:35.890> the

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
yeah so that's how they run run the

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.759 
yeah so that's how they run run the
