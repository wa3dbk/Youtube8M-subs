00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:23.529
 hello youtube friends today I bring a 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:27.160
 Very special tutorial, I think that you 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:31.619
 he liked it is a great program that 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:36.100
 I found it is ok that you can play 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:39.129
 almost all but I would say 95% of the 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:41.550
 online pirate games are worth and this is not 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:41.550
 lie 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.960
 how can you see 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:54.610
 this program what it does 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:57.970
 good lets you play online games 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:00.880
 pirates if you have the game 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:03.520
 and if you have a pirate game, you're going to 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.200
 to play online in this program not 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:09.000
 all the games are there but I've already 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:12.550
 said with 95% of them and gastón 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.880
 how do we have this wonderful program 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:17.560
 because first we have to register and 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.700
 for that we're going to go to the page 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:23.550
 Google 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:26.010
 this I will leave in the description 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.770
 the video 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:31.040
 when we are here we give a joint for 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.040
 free 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:40.850
 you give here here there is have it 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:45.370
 to Nestor to screams or he had continued 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:48.610
 and by registering the records will 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:53.700
 with an activation page to your 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:56.869
 active email and login session 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.869
 I will login 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:05.460
 oh sorry we 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.460
 mother 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:22.290
 when you have logged in 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.290
 what we have to do is 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:30.490
 when you have started the session 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.490
 you are going to download 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.630
 I'm downloading it at that time 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:44.360
 then here 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.550
 To the grave, the client will also go to 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.390
 leave 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:51.700
 this page in the description when 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.050
 we are on this page we download the 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:58.390
 First 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:03:01.650
 we give and we give to all 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:04.739
 and we give to the first 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.270
 and automatically the point is lowered 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:09.780
 exe 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:14.190
 I'm going to eliminate it 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:16.140
 when you have installed starting 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:20.110
 the installation is very simple wants 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:22.240
 update are it says megabytes 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:25.790
 open it 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:29.110
 the program normally 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.110
 and start decisions 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:36.530
 As you can see, it tells you over time 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:39.730
 both the one that will influence with these notes 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.730
 we wait for him to connect 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.760
 the host this program 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:53.800
 control us ending it takes its time 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:56.980
 also start 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.340
 in theory this program is a beta 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.670
 says someone 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.770
 so to make a beta is super 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.300
 well metro 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:06.300
 good we hope 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.000
 we will wait 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:19.890
 As you can see, the session has already started 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.989
 if you get this because you give here to the 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:25.740
 cross and you're done 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:27.960
 when it comes out when they are sorry 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:31.050
 have logged in 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:35.009
 you will get the network search 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:36.000
 and the categories for example os 

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:39.090
 I recommend that you look for it directly 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.720
 Gaston's game leads 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:45.259
 digging the sniper anna the sniper 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.259
 elite yes 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.490
 for example the turn of war on line is the 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:52.420
 game that hopes to give them I put them in hyper 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.420
 elite 

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:58.539
 I search and all the snipers get me out 

00:04:56.469 --> 00:05:00.879
 then online these are the people 

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:02.499
 that are connected right now is not 

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:05.729
 character to a server that there is nobody 

00:05:02.499 --> 00:05:09.120
 because I can not play 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:12.449
 wáyar sniper elite is worth and how we do 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:15.919
 to play this game online because 

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:15.919
 it was just a double click 

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:21.190
 and if we are going to open the room where it is 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:24.490
 all the people are worth 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:27.729
 here are these people who are playing 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:30.310
 right now to this game then for 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:33.529
 enter this game what we have to 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:38.919
 to do is go to this little arrow here 

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:38.919
 and we look for the executable of the game 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.550
 for example you have it on the local disk 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:47.730
 active of the program all that is to open and 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:50.520
 you are already and will connect to this server 

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:52.919
 to play online in the game 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:55.580
 for example if you want to play whatever 

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:55.580
 battlefield 

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:04.770
 you already have the 42 you have the battlefield 2 

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:04.770
 battlefield 3 

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:13.290
 you have the 4 - state obviously is worth 

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:16.290
 but you have all the battlefield 2 for 

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:20.030
 example there are 11 people 

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:20.030
 if you want call of duty 

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:26.870
 with guti 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:31.099
 the known useful 2 + warfare in the cope 

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:33.300
 the booster warfare 2 + warfare 3 goal 

00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:36.310
 Act 

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:38.880
 hello agent infinity 

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:42.790
 finite people that are playing too 

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:44.670
 infinite list of games that you can 

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:47.390
 find all you want 

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:50.600
 for example I want to play at the end 104 

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:50.600
 Double click 

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:56.280
 that good 

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:59.240
 and I know I'm in the room of a hyper no 

00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:00.740
 we entered the room 

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:06.169
 and this is all the people who are playing 

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:09.699
 right now in that room it's worth then 

00:07:06.169 --> 00:07:09.699
 I'll leave here a little while 

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:20.530
 and if you want to enter you give here and it is 

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:20.530
 you catch 

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:27.780
 the executable of the game was already going 

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:30.330
 to give another example the fifa 14 and all 

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:31.980
 this is not yet take into account that 

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:34.870
 it's a beta too 

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:37.830
 for example 

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:37.830
 they want to play 

00:07:39.249 --> 00:07:46.099
 whatever is 

00:07:41.129 --> 00:07:48.900
 the 2013 fish because the markets are not 

00:07:46.099 --> 00:07:51.520
 revolution 

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:53.910
 evolution 

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:57.840
 in 2013 

00:07:53.910 --> 00:08:00.240
 here you have it there are no people but good 

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:03.060
 this is the friends program I hope that you 

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:07.170
