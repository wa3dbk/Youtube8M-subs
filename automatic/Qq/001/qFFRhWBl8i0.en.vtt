00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:09.170
 my squirrel 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.640
 all salute friends with you well and the machine 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.500
 on the screen this is a new british fri sau 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.380
 level eight cherry aker 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.420
 un and. This is extremely interesting to start. 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.970
 suggest to get acquainted with goes echo 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.850
 margin of safety but very modest total 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:42.730
 1050 x weight of thirty tons and 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:45.760
 sight range is 370 meters and 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:48.850
 now the dynamics and dynamics is not Fri-Sau 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:51.370
 about medium tank powerful engine a 650 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.830
 horses maximum speed 52 kilometers per hour 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.400
 turning speed in place of 36 degrees in 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.550
 give me a sec 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:00.070
 impresses me too gun 105 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.989
 millimeters one-time damage of 390 units when 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.690
 rate of nearly six shots 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:07.540
 per minute we shoot either subscale 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:10.300
 shells with a penetration of 268 millimeters 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.760
 either two types of hashes for gold and no 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:16.060
 first punch 210 millimeters a 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:19.570
 the second 105 range is 035 by 100 meters 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:22.090
 time information 2.4 seconds and here at 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.219
 Warriors practically no as summary I can 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.619
 say that the gun is still quite fit and 

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:28.869
 pleasant our Fri-shka is based on 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:31.509
 tankrave inherited it 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:33.729
 corps but alas the concept of armor and corps 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:36.820
 Cromwell does not have anything in common 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:38.710
 have the strongest place in alga 64 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.539
 millimeter and the forehead of the tower is thirty 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.460
 in all other projections and 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:44.770
 less and now i invite you 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.939
 look at what chariotir is capable of 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.939
 battle drove 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.500
 kerry aker this modernization mean 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.990
 tanker cromwell of the 50s 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:12.010
 differed the basic version of the new tower 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.330
 with a more powerful weapon in 1952 200 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.730
 helium crowns were shipped to 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.280
 refitting under the Kirov cheerio 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.290
 to the British army they served to 56 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.800
 years after which they were sold to others 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.800
 countries 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.110
 what kind of machine we have in hand sau life 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:44.290
 Is that with a stretch I would rather carry 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:46.360
 Chariotir class medium tanks judge 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.610
 yourself magnificent dynamics lack 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.160
 armor is pretty quick frame and small 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:54.130
 stock hp and still have a tower let slowly 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:57.600
 rotating but still it is and how here 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.600
 would you say that before us pt 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.090
 how do you play the game with so 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.069
 ambiguous t.kh. 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.930
 on the one hand it kind of incites 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:24.489
 us to attack their mobility but with 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.950
 other we cannot afford it 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:29.500
 in mind the utter lack of armor and 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.120
 small stock hp i tend to 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.940
 we must act exclusively 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.010
 based on the situation in the battle at the beginning of the battle 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.390
 It is quite logical to take a bush and include 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.400
 horns and in their own way by color 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.680
 shoot enemies on the siding if 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.540
 allows card thanks to speakers 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.330
 take such positions we will not be 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.580
 labor and further closer to the middle of the battle we 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:50.769
 we can turn into classic st 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:53.260
 break into the rear of the enemy and cram 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:55.090
 hash bombs for the softest places then 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.569
 eat in one battle we can play first 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.700
 vp 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:59.980
 and then vst lose again 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.349
 turn into n occupy bushes near the base and 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:05.549
 we shoot insolent invaders such 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:05.549
 imagine a transformer 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.800
 places 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:20.120
 playing st you can also act 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.900
 together with other medium tanks a 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.760
 look for 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.010
 vulnerability in protecting the adversary and 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:27.560
 breaking through them but itâ€™s important to remember that 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:29.570
 carton we have nobody and need to play with 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.820
 looking at this fact never 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:34.250
 brazen and hold back allies 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:36.020
 tanks so that they take damage while you do it 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:47.060
 handed out just so you will 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:49.040
 live to the end of the battle is also our style 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:51.140
 the game is extremely dependent on the level of battles 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.090
 a dozen and generally whenever possible not 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:55.010
 must fall into sight since 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.300
 our np allow to survive only a couple 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:58.790
 shots tt10 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:01.160
 three shots of some st10 and one 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:02.810
 pd10 shot if you don't want 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.760
 go to the hangar earlier than on 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:06.740
 you shoot your average damage then always 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:09.230
 watch the minimap carefully and not 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:11.900
 stay alone on flank in battles 

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:13.910
 level eight is naturally easier for us but 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.920
 here, too, need to play very carefully 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:18.260
 after all, we are absolutely punched 

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:20.180
 play arrogantly only when you are sure 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:23.830
 its a skeleton and if such confidence 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.830
 no you should not go ahead 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.530
 the lack of armor does not add us 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.600
 comfort to the game on city maps here 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:38.250
 we are easy target dynamics of course 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.940
 allows us to roll in any 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:41.280
 lane 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:42.960
 and do not substitute for shot but experienced 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.970
 the enemy has hardly seen you 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.380
 somewhere on the open cards 

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:48.449
 ceriotti ru better 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:50.220
 great distances in this case our 

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:52.500
 Ally gun allows you to confidently 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:55.610
 deal damage they are the biggest silhouette 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.610
 gives a plus to disguise 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:04.340
 and 

00:06:08.849 --> 00:06:11.179
 though 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:17.800
 as a summary, I want to say that if you 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:19.840
 confident in their ability to play 

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:22.360
 careful not to risk acting 

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:24.460
 for sure the turn of the shooting will easily become 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:26.350
 your favorite and if not then you 

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:28.900
 will have to suffer because mistakes 

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:30.730
 Fri-shka does not forgive me on this 

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:32.860
 subscribe to wot fan &amp; red eagle 

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:35.760
