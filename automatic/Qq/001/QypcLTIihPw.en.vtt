 has managed to create that has a lot for 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:04.670
 another part of conventual we will see 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.280
 then in the festival does not enter this 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:10.610
 Organized notice is worth seeing 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.590
 and of which you are a part, and a 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.300
 small support that the david wineries 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.730
 Moreno does for the festival and nothing else 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.430
 all all the supports I think they are 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.319
 they are welcome and also especially in 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.180
 this case if they have as we said before 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:24.410
 and they have to do with the matter not because 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.150
 wine and culture is also the 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.760
 central state and then we're very 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.580
 integrated into the samillán monastery 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.650
 we have are we are part of this neighborhood 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.720
 what this festival intends 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.850
 millan live stage is precisely 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.230
 combine all the contents both the 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:43.730
 religious content as the cultural 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:45.780
 like the gastronomic one and the one that has to 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.580
 see with wine 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.190

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:53.120

 our language bloomed sure a 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:25.290
 light similar to this inspired in more than 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:27.930
 an occasion to the poet Gonzalo de Berceo y 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:31.520
 we are not alone it seems that we have 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.520
 aroused the curiosity of the neighbors 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.300
 so that no 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.700
 what 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.030
 here

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:35.150

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:41.220
 our special guest actor Riojan 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:43.280
 thank you very much for joining us 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.630

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:48.000
 also of the cogolla or with the rioja 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:50.460
 what are the links I have with the 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.430
 rioja are fundamentally familiar 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:55.410
 Affective I have always lived outside of 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.810
 here from very small my parents 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:00.690
 they had to go to Madrid and from 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:02.160
 then I have lived there but always the 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:04.980
 rioja has occupied a very special place 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:07.290
 inside the house because there was always talk 

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:08.730
 He was a reference, they always told me 

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:10.800
 things then it 's as if I had lived 

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:12.570
 here somehow I would say that 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:16.880
 spiritually and emotionally I have 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:16.880
 always lived in the Rioja 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:29.060
 I remember buying the book here 

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:31.790
 the complete works of Gonzalo de 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:33.920
 benefit and the book I still have it in 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:35.870
 house is a book an edition that already 

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:38.690
 It starts to be old and that's where I 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:41.060
 I started drinking from the verses of the first 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:42.560
 poet in the Spanish language and that already 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:44.060
 of boy and impressed me 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:46.690
 It was very impressive to know how good it was 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:50.120
 here they were hidden or guarded 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:51.800
 well guarded well guarded those 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:54.860
 those first words in roman paladino 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:56.660
 of the good is very exciting and to be 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:59.000
 here today participate in this of this 

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:04.390
 festival and be part of it 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.390
 at this moment for me a luxury 

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:20.120
 I hope you have many people and I hope 

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:22.919
 make it a beautiful day this inauguration 

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:25.199
 of the festival san millán is the scene 

00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:27.000
 I live because I think there is a 

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:30.750
 golden opportunity to conjugate a 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.760
 magical space or a space that since 

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:35.370
 centuries ago it has become a place 

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:37.919
 of call for for pilgrims to 

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:41.100
 travelers for curious and if now you 

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:43.440
 we add to this magical continent the 

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:45.810
 content of the word and of 

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:48.810
 stage and theater I think that 

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:50.130
 we can be making a great invention 

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:53.370
 we can not be starting a path 

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:55.919
 precious to turn this this place into a 

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:57.720
 place of reference not only for the 

00:06:55.919 --> 00:07:00.900
 sense of sight sense also 

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:02.580
 of not being the human of friendship but 

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:04.830
 the sense of art and what and what 

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:08.000
 culturally as vividly as possible 

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:08.000
 which is through the stage 

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:10.990
 here 

00:07:14.639 --> 00:07:18.379
 On the 11th I will be here in San Millán with 

00:07:16.949 --> 00:07:20.909

00:07:18.379 --> 00:07:23.939

00:07:20.909 --> 00:07:26.370
 invited to come and spend some time 

00:07:23.939 --> 00:07:27.779
 great and also to share the start 

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:31.529
 of what it's going to be I'm sure a 

00:07:27.779 --> 00:07:34.770
 cultural adventure without known limits 

00:07:31.529 --> 00:07:37.169
 I still think something beautiful is born 

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:41.360
 for san millán for la rioja and for the 

00:07:37.169 --> 00:07:41.360
