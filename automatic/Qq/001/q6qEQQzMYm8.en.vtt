00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
think it would be odd well then they

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.460 
think it would be odd well then they
could<00:01:20.520> share<00:01:20.700> tons<00:01:20.850> of<00:01:21.060> clothes<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:22.170> be

could share tons of clothes and and be
best<00:01:22.680> friends<00:01:22.799> forever<00:01:23.040> so<00:01:23.250> she<00:01:23.490> would<00:01:23.700> marry

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
best friends forever so she would marry
