welcome<00:00:01.020> to<00:00:01.140> electron<00:00:01.589> line<00:00:01.800> and<00:00:02.010> now<00:00:02.070> let's

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
welcome to electron line and now let's

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.309 
welcome to electron line and now let's
take<00:00:02.490> a<00:00:02.520> look<00:00:02.700> and<00:00:02.909> see<00:00:03.060> how<00:00:03.360> we<00:00:03.389> use<00:00:03.810> angle

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
take a look and see how we use angle

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:06.530 
take a look and see how we use angle
measure<00:00:04.680> in<00:00:04.890> astronomy<00:00:05.250> let's<00:00:06.150> say<00:00:06.330> for

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
measure in astronomy let's say for

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.600 
measure in astronomy let's say for
example<00:00:06.960> that<00:00:06.990> we're<00:00:07.290> observing<00:00:07.890> Jupiter<00:00:08.400> and

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
example that we're observing Jupiter and

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.990 
example that we're observing Jupiter and
it's<00:00:09.150> closest<00:00:09.630> large<00:00:10.110> moon<00:00:10.530> Io<00:00:10.889> and<00:00:11.309> we're

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
it's closest large moon Io and we're

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.570 
it's closest large moon Io and we're
wondering<00:00:12.269> how<00:00:12.719> far<00:00:13.080> away<00:00:13.349> is<00:00:13.650> IO<00:00:14.219> from

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
wondering how far away is IO from

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:15.770 
wondering how far away is IO from
Jupiter<00:00:14.969> in<00:00:15.089> other<00:00:15.210> words<00:00:15.480> what<00:00:15.660> is<00:00:15.750> the

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
Jupiter in other words what is the

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.109 
Jupiter in other words what is the
average<00:00:16.080> orbital<00:00:16.560> distance<00:00:17.279> of<00:00:17.430> IO<00:00:17.609> in<00:00:17.940> its

semi-major axis of its orbit and if we

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.640 
semi-major axis of its orbit and if we
know<00:00:24.029> that<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.510> distance<00:00:24.960> from<00:00:25.320> Earth<00:00:25.619> to

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
know that the distance from Earth to

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.550 
know that the distance from Earth to
Jupiter<00:00:26.490> at<00:00:26.810> when<00:00:27.810> Jupiter<00:00:28.230> is<00:00:28.320> at<00:00:28.439> opposition

Jupiter at when Jupiter is at opposition

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.830 
Jupiter at when Jupiter is at opposition
with<00:00:29.130> other<00:00:29.250> words<00:00:29.460> when<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.880> Sun<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.630> Earth

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
with other words when the Sun the Earth

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.720 
with other words when the Sun the Earth
and<00:00:31.140> Jupiter<00:00:31.199> all<00:00:31.619> form<00:00:31.980> a<00:00:32.130> single<00:00:32.520> line<00:00:32.550> and

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
and Jupiter all form a single line and

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.510 
and Jupiter all form a single line and
and<00:00:33.120> Jupiter<00:00:34.020> is<00:00:34.200> then<00:00:34.680> on<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:34.950> far<00:00:35.190> side

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
and Jupiter is then on the far side

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.340 
and Jupiter is then on the far side
there<00:00:35.820> then<00:00:36.270> we<00:00:36.390> know<00:00:36.510> that<00:00:36.719> this<00:00:36.870> distance

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
there then we know that this distance

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.700 
there then we know that this distance
here<00:00:37.649> is<00:00:37.710> about<00:00:38.100> 4.2<00:00:39.030> astronomical<00:00:39.750> units<00:00:40.050> so

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
here is about 4.2 astronomical units so

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.100 
here is about 4.2 astronomical units so
let's<00:00:40.950> call<00:00:41.219> this<00:00:41.489> distance<00:00:41.790> from<00:00:42.270> Earth<00:00:42.600> to

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
let's call this distance from Earth to

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.470 
let's call this distance from Earth to
dooper<00:00:43.469> let's<00:00:43.680> call<00:00:43.890> it<00:00:44.040> Big<00:00:44.250> D<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:45.149> let's<00:00:45.329> say

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
dooper let's call it Big D and let's say

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.560 
dooper let's call it Big D and let's say
that's<00:00:45.660> equal<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:46.160> 4.2<00:00:47.300> astronomical<00:00:48.300> unit

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
that's equal to 4.2 astronomical unit

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.299 
that's equal to 4.2 astronomical unit
realizing<00:00:49.140> of<00:00:49.200> course<00:00:49.260> that<00:00:49.649> an<00:00:49.739> astronomical

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
realizing of course that an astronomical

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.360 
realizing of course that an astronomical
unit<00:00:50.340> is<00:00:50.700> about<00:00:50.910> 93<00:00:51.600> million<00:00:51.840> miles<00:00:52.199> and<00:00:52.680> then

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
unit is about 93 million miles and then

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.490 
unit is about 93 million miles and then
let's<00:00:53.610> say<00:00:53.789> we<00:00:53.820> go<00:00:54.120> ahead<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.600> measure<00:00:55.230> the

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
let's say we go ahead and measure the

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.319 
let's say we go ahead and measure the
angle<00:00:55.980> if<00:00:56.190> we<00:00:56.309> take<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:56.550> straight<00:00:56.940> line<00:00:57.149> from

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
angle if we take a straight line from

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.760 
angle if we take a straight line from
the<00:00:57.420> Earth<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:57.629> Jupiter<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:58.410> then<00:00:58.530> we<00:00:58.620> take

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
the Earth to Jupiter and then we take

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.349 
the Earth to Jupiter and then we take
another<00:00:58.920> straight<00:00:59.370> line<00:00:59.609> from<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.969> earth<00:01:00.090> to

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
another straight line from the earth to

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.110 
another straight line from the earth to
I<00:01:00.629> oh<00:01:00.899> so<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.250> distance<00:01:02.670> from<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.940> earth<00:01:03.000> to

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
I oh so the distance from the earth to

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.390 
I oh so the distance from the earth to
Jupiter<00:01:03.690> let's<00:01:03.930> say<00:01:04.080> that<00:01:04.260> is<00:01:04.439> 4.2

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
Jupiter let's say that is 4.2

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.010 
Jupiter let's say that is 4.2
astronomical<00:01:06.060> units<00:01:06.299> remember<00:01:06.689> it<00:01:06.810> from

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
astronomical units remember it from

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.530 
astronomical units remember it from
Jupiter<00:01:07.409> to<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.590> Sun<00:01:08.010> it's<00:01:08.310> 5.2<00:01:09.150> but<00:01:09.360> when

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
Jupiter to the Sun it's 5.2 but when

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.420 
Jupiter to the Sun it's 5.2 but when
Jupiter<00:01:09.900> is<00:01:09.960> in<00:01:10.080> opposition<00:01:10.409> in<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:11.189> straight

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
Jupiter is in opposition in a straight

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.640 
Jupiter is in opposition in a straight
line<00:01:11.700> from<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.119> Sun<00:01:12.390> let's<00:01:12.900> put<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.200> Sun<00:01:13.380> over

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
line from the Sun let's put the Sun over

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.219 
line from the Sun let's put the Sun over
here<00:01:14.070> Earth<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:15.090> Jupiter<00:01:15.119> then<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.840> distance

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
here Earth and Jupiter then the distance

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.240 
here Earth and Jupiter then the distance
here<00:01:16.380> would<00:01:16.530> be<00:01:16.680> 4.2<00:01:17.430> astronomical<00:01:18.299> units

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
here would be 4.2 astronomical units

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.890 
here would be 4.2 astronomical units
let's<00:01:20.250> say<00:01:20.400> that<00:01:20.549> we<00:01:20.670> measure<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.360> angle

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
let's say that we measure the angle

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.780 
let's say that we measure the angle
between<00:01:22.110> Jupiter<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:22.830> IO<00:01:23.100> so<00:01:23.460> we<00:01:23.549> draw<00:01:23.759> a

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
between Jupiter and IO so we draw a

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.730 
between Jupiter and IO so we draw a
straight<00:01:23.909> line<00:01:24.119> from<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.630> earth<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:25.290> Jupiter

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
straight line from the earth to Jupiter

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.859 
straight line from the earth to Jupiter
and<00:01:25.770> another<00:01:26.189> line<00:01:26.430> from<00:01:26.580> Earth<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:27.030> IO<00:01:27.240> when

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
and another line from Earth to IO when

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.109 
and another line from Earth to IO when
IO<00:01:28.110> is<00:01:28.380> a<00:01:28.409> fartist<00:01:28.979> extend<00:01:29.460> away<00:01:29.579> from<00:01:29.700> Jupiter

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
IO is a fartist extend away from Jupiter

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.090 
IO is a fartist extend away from Jupiter
because<00:01:30.450> obviously<00:01:31.049> from<00:01:31.259> our<00:01:31.439> perspective

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
because obviously from our perspective

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.760 
because obviously from our perspective
as<00:01:32.250> IO<00:01:33.000> goes<00:01:33.420> around<00:01:33.720> dooper<00:01:34.140> sometimes<00:01:34.590> I<00:01:34.710> who

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
as IO goes around dooper sometimes I who

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.230 
as IO goes around dooper sometimes I who
goes<00:01:35.009> directly<00:01:35.460> in<00:01:35.520> front<00:01:35.700> of<00:01:35.790> Jupiter<00:01:36.119> we

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
goes directly in front of Jupiter we

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.300 
goes directly in front of Jupiter we
can't<00:01:36.450> see<00:01:36.720> it<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:37.170> it<00:01:37.320> comes<00:01:37.500> back<00:01:37.590> over<00:01:37.890> here

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
can't see it and it comes back over here

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.980 
can't see it and it comes back over here
then<00:01:38.490> it's<00:01:38.640> directly<00:01:38.939> behind<00:01:39.329> Jupiter<00:01:39.540> can't

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
then it's directly behind Jupiter can't

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.050 
then it's directly behind Jupiter can't
see<00:01:40.170> it<00:01:40.259> comes<00:01:40.500> over<00:01:40.710> here<00:01:40.950> so<00:01:41.400> when<00:01:41.549> IO

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
see it comes over here so when IO

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.819 
see it comes over here so when IO
reaches<00:01:42.570> its<00:01:42.750> farthest<00:01:43.320> point<00:01:43.590> away<00:01:43.799> from

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
reaches its farthest point away from

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.219 
reaches its farthest point away from
Jupiter<00:01:44.460> as<00:01:44.610> observed<00:01:45.210> from<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.570> earth<00:01:45.689> we

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
Jupiter as observed from the earth we

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.740 
Jupiter as observed from the earth we
measure<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.710> angle<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.280> angles<00:01:47.549> on<00:01:47.750> 1.86

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
measure the angle and the angles on 1.86

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.710 
measure the angle and the angles on 1.86
3<00:01:49.170> arc<00:01:49.680> minutes<00:01:50.460> that's<00:01:51.060> a<00:01:51.210> pretty<00:01:51.390> small

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
3 arc minutes that's a pretty small

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.010 
3 arc minutes that's a pretty small
angle<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.610> so<00:01:53.610> it's<00:01:53.759> a<00:01:53.909> little<00:01:54.240> bit<00:01:54.360> less<00:01:54.750> than

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
angle and so it's a little bit less than

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.639 
angle and so it's a little bit less than
one<00:01:55.320> thirtieth<00:01:55.920> of<00:01:56.130> a<00:01:56.490> degree<00:01:57.530> knowing<00:01:58.530> the

one thirtieth of a degree knowing the

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.260 
one thirtieth of a degree knowing the

astronomical<00:02:00.930> unit<00:02:01.140> is<00:02:01.170> 93<00:02:01.649> million<00:02:01.829> miles<00:02:02.130> we

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
astronomical unit is 93 million miles we

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.160 
astronomical unit is 93 million miles we
should<00:02:02.880> be<00:02:03.000> able<00:02:03.090> to<00:02:03.270> figure<00:02:03.479> out<00:02:03.600> the

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
should be able to figure out the

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.289 
should be able to figure out the
distance<00:02:04.380> between<00:02:05.100> Jupiter<00:02:05.670> and<00:02:05.700> IO<00:02:05.850> the

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
distance between Jupiter and IO the

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.510 
distance between Jupiter and IO the
average<00:02:06.689> orbital<00:02:06.930> distance<00:02:07.530> and<00:02:07.770> so<00:02:08.280> for<00:02:08.429> that

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
average orbital distance and so for that

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.589 
average orbital distance and so for that
what<00:02:08.700> we're<00:02:08.789> going<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:09.000> do<00:02:09.149> is<00:02:09.270> we're<00:02:09.390> going<00:02:09.509> to

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
what we're going to do is we're going to

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.869 
what we're going to do is we're going to
take<00:02:09.810> an<00:02:10.020> example<00:02:10.349> here<00:02:10.619> of<00:02:10.649> a<00:02:10.770> triangle<00:02:11.340> we're

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
take an example here of a triangle we're

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.190 
take an example here of a triangle we're
trying<00:02:12.120> to<00:02:12.180> measure<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.599> small

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
trying to measure the small

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.199 
trying to measure the small
d<00:02:13.680> here<00:02:14.010> so<00:02:14.160> I'll<00:02:14.220> call<00:02:14.489> this<00:02:14.550> two<00:02:14.940> small

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
d here so I'll call this two small

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.900 
d here so I'll call this two small
distance<00:02:15.720> D<00:02:15.989> the<00:02:16.620> large<00:02:16.890> distance<00:02:17.190> D<00:02:17.550> is<00:02:17.700> the

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
distance D the large distance D is the

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.420 
distance D the large distance D is the
distance<00:02:18.360> away<00:02:18.660> from<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:19.110> earth<00:02:19.260> so<00:02:19.920> Big<00:02:20.190> D<00:02:20.400> is

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
distance away from the earth so Big D is

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.150 
distance away from the earth so Big D is
four<00:02:20.790> point<00:02:21.000> two<00:02:21.120> astronomical<00:02:21.780> units<00:02:22.160> four

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
four point two astronomical units four

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.699 
four point two astronomical units four
point<00:02:23.700> two<00:02:24.000> astronomical<00:02:24.900> units<00:02:25.170> so<00:02:25.590> that's

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
point two astronomical units so that's

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.559 
point two astronomical units so that's
four<00:02:26.069> point<00:02:26.459> two<00:02:26.879> times<00:02:27.810> 93<00:02:28.769> million<00:02:28.980> miles

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
four point two times 93 million miles

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:34.160 
four point two times 93 million miles
and<00:02:31.099> the<00:02:32.099> angle<00:02:32.430> we<00:02:32.550> measure<00:02:32.760> to<00:02:33.090> be<00:02:33.239> one<00:02:33.720> point

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
and the angle we measure to be one point

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.210 
and the angle we measure to be one point
eight<00:02:34.530> six<00:02:35.069> three<00:02:35.450> arc<00:02:36.450> minutes<00:02:37.230> and<00:02:37.590> so<00:02:38.099> the

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
eight six three arc minutes and so the

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.690 
eight six three arc minutes and so the
question<00:02:38.580> is<00:02:38.760> how<00:02:39.360> far<00:02:40.230> away<00:02:40.410> is<00:02:40.739> IO<00:02:41.099> from

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
question is how far away is IO from

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.759 
question is how far away is IO from
Jupiter<00:02:42.209> and<00:02:42.420> the<00:02:42.540> equation<00:02:42.989> we<00:02:43.080> use<00:02:43.110> is<00:02:43.530> this

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
Jupiter and the equation we use is this

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:46.520 
Jupiter and the equation we use is this
we<00:02:44.370> can<00:02:44.519> say<00:02:44.730> that<00:02:44.940> the<00:02:45.090> angle<00:02:45.319> divided<00:02:46.319> by

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
we can say that the angle divided by

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.280 
we can say that the angle divided by
fifty<00:02:47.040> seven<00:02:47.549> point<00:02:47.910> three<00:02:48.060> is<00:02:48.630> equal<00:02:48.900> to<00:02:49.049> the

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
fifty seven point three is equal to the

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.520 
fifty seven point three is equal to the
ratio<00:02:49.410> of<00:02:49.620> small<00:02:50.010> D<00:02:50.310> over<00:02:51.000> Big<00:02:51.209> D<00:02:51.390> so<00:02:51.989> Wow<00:02:52.170> where

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
ratio of small D over Big D so Wow where

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.949 
ratio of small D over Big D so Wow where
that<00:02:52.680> equation<00:02:52.980> come<00:02:53.280> from<00:02:53.549> well<00:02:54.060> that<00:02:54.630> is<00:02:54.780> if

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
that equation come from well that is if

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.509 
that equation come from well that is if
we<00:02:55.110> use<00:02:55.140> the<00:02:55.530> angle<00:02:55.890> in<00:02:56.390> degrees<00:02:58.489> so<00:02:59.489> that

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
we use the angle in degrees so that

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.089 
we use the angle in degrees so that
means<00:02:59.819> we<00:03:00.060> would<00:03:00.180> have<00:03:00.239> to<00:03:00.480> convert<00:03:01.110> the<00:03:01.739> angle

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:02.099 
means we would have to convert the angle

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:03.680 
means we would have to convert the angle
from<00:03:02.310> arc<00:03:02.519> minutes<00:03:02.880> to<00:03:02.970> degrees<00:03:03.299> and<00:03:03.510> we'll<00:03:03.599> do

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
from arc minutes to degrees and we'll do

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.479 
from arc minutes to degrees and we'll do
that<00:03:03.840> in<00:03:03.930> just<00:03:03.959> a<00:03:04.200> moment<00:03:04.530> but<00:03:04.890> you<00:03:05.130> say<00:03:05.310> well

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
that in just a moment but you say well

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:06.920 
that in just a moment but you say well
where<00:03:05.640> does<00:03:05.760> that<00:03:05.819> come<00:03:06.090> from<00:03:06.120> well<00:03:06.690> if<00:03:06.810> you

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
where does that come from well if you

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.640 
where does that come from well if you
remember<00:03:07.380> back<00:03:07.560> from<00:03:07.620> your<00:03:08.190> geometry<00:03:09.000> days

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
remember back from your geometry days

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.080 
remember back from your geometry days
and<00:03:10.650> you<00:03:10.739> looked<00:03:10.920> at<00:03:11.069> the<00:03:11.160> circle<00:03:11.610> you<00:03:11.940> know

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
and you looked at the circle you know

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.360 
and you looked at the circle you know
that<00:03:12.269> the<00:03:12.390> circle<00:03:12.690> has<00:03:12.810> radius<00:03:12.840> R<00:03:13.440> and<00:03:13.709> let's

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
that the circle has radius R and let's

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.640 
that the circle has radius R and let's
say<00:03:14.489> you<00:03:14.579> make<00:03:14.760> an<00:03:14.910> angle<00:03:15.329> theta<00:03:15.750> we<00:03:16.349> can<00:03:16.380> then

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
say you make an angle theta we can then

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.379 
say you make an angle theta we can then
say<00:03:16.890> that<00:03:16.920> the<00:03:17.250> arc<00:03:17.430> length<00:03:17.880> along<00:03:18.000> the<00:03:18.209> edge

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:18.389 
say that the arc length along the edge

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:21.410 
say that the arc length along the edge
of<00:03:18.569> the<00:03:18.630> circle<00:03:18.840> s<00:03:19.170> is<00:03:19.980> equal<00:03:20.430> to<00:03:20.459> the<00:03:21.209> radius

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
of the circle s is equal to the radius

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.020 
of the circle s is equal to the radius
times<00:03:21.989> the<00:03:22.170> angle<00:03:22.500> theta<00:03:22.769> and<00:03:23.160> so<00:03:23.790> we<00:03:23.880> could

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
times the angle theta and so we could

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.479 
times the angle theta and so we could
say<00:03:24.180> that<00:03:24.209> the<00:03:24.720> angle<00:03:24.959> theta<00:03:25.230> is<00:03:25.560> equal<00:03:26.130> to<00:03:26.160> s

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
say that the angle theta is equal to s

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:29.449 
say that the angle theta is equal to s
divided<00:03:27.150> by<00:03:27.180> R<00:03:27.480> now<00:03:28.139> notice<00:03:28.620> the<00:03:28.799> similarity

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
divided by R now notice the similarity

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.849 
divided by R now notice the similarity
here<00:03:29.700> even<00:03:30.600> though<00:03:30.780> this<00:03:30.959> is<00:03:31.139> an<00:03:31.290> arc<00:03:31.560> length

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:31.859 
here even though this is an arc length

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:34.099 
here even though this is an arc length
it<00:03:32.040> is<00:03:32.190> curved<00:03:32.639> if<00:03:32.940> the<00:03:33.180> angle<00:03:33.480> is<00:03:33.540> very<00:03:33.690> very

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:34.109 
it is curved if the angle is very very

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:36.590 
it is curved if the angle is very very
tiny<00:03:34.530> like<00:03:35.100> a<00:03:35.160> very<00:03:35.459> small<00:03:35.880> angle<00:03:36.120> like<00:03:36.389> that

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
tiny like a very small angle like that

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.000 
tiny like a very small angle like that
you<00:03:37.109> really<00:03:37.290> can't<00:03:37.650> tell<00:03:37.799> the<00:03:37.859> difference

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
you really can't tell the difference

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.009 
you really can't tell the difference
that<00:03:38.519> this<00:03:38.639> is<00:03:38.819> curved<00:03:39.209> it<00:03:39.420> almost<00:03:39.690> looks<00:03:39.959> like

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
that this is curved it almost looks like

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:41.240 
that this is curved it almost looks like
a<00:03:40.109> straight<00:03:40.470> line<00:03:40.680> so<00:03:40.739> it<00:03:41.010> can<00:03:41.160> be

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
a straight line so it can be

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.250 
a straight line so it can be
approximated<00:03:42.060> by<00:03:42.180> this<00:03:42.510> triangle<00:03:43.109> that<00:03:43.230> I

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
approximated by this triangle that I

approximated by this triangle that I
have<00:03:43.470> right<00:03:43.680> here<00:03:44.010> remember<00:03:44.489> in<00:03:44.609> astronomy

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
have right here remember in astronomy

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.640 
have right here remember in astronomy
we're<00:03:45.630> always<00:03:45.750> talking<00:03:45.989> about<00:03:46.230> very<00:03:46.530> small

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
we're always talking about very small

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.670 
we're always talking about very small
angles<00:03:47.510> so<00:03:48.510> this<00:03:48.690> small<00:03:48.959> angle<00:03:49.139> we<00:03:49.380> can<00:03:49.530> then

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
angles so this small angle we can then

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.559 
angles so this small angle we can then
say<00:03:49.889> that<00:03:49.920> this<00:03:50.220> distance<00:03:50.430> we<00:03:51.150> call<00:03:51.329> this

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:51.569 
say that this distance we call this

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:54.530 
say that this distance we call this
little<00:03:52.319> D<00:03:52.500> and<00:03:52.739> we<00:03:52.799> call<00:03:53.010> the<00:03:53.190> radius<00:03:53.549> big<00:03:53.790> D<00:03:54.060> we

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
little D and we call the radius big D we

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.509 
little D and we call the radius big D we
could<00:03:54.660> then<00:03:54.840> say<00:03:55.079> that<00:03:55.260> the<00:03:55.290> angle<00:03:55.500> theta<00:03:55.980> is

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
could then say that the angle theta is

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:59.330 
could then say that the angle theta is
equal<00:03:56.880> to<00:03:57.000> the<00:03:57.150> ratio<00:03:57.329> of<00:03:57.720> small<00:03:58.079> D<00:03:58.560> divided<00:03:59.310> by

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
equal to the ratio of small D divided by

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.789 
equal to the ratio of small D divided by
Big<00:03:59.639> D<00:03:59.900> now<00:04:00.900> you<00:04:00.959> said<00:04:01.170> well<00:04:01.290> wait<00:04:01.470> a<00:04:01.530> minute

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
Big D now you said well wait a minute

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:04.430 
Big D now you said well wait a minute
where<00:04:02.340> does<00:04:02.459> the<00:04:02.579> 57<00:04:03.180> point<00:04:03.420> 3<00:04:03.599> come<00:04:03.810> from<00:04:04.079> well

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
where does the 57 point 3 come from well

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.339 
where does the 57 point 3 come from well
it<00:04:04.590> turns<00:04:04.799> out<00:04:05.069> that<00:04:05.670> this<00:04:05.940> is<00:04:06.150> in<00:04:06.510> radians<00:04:07.019> and

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:07.349 
it turns out that this is in radians and

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:09.289 
it turns out that this is in radians and
there's<00:04:07.769> about<00:04:07.889> fifty<00:04:08.459> seven<00:04:08.819> point<00:04:09.060> three

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:09.299 
there's about fifty seven point three

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:11.270 
there's about fifty seven point three
degrees<00:04:09.630> in<00:04:09.660> radians<00:04:10.169> so<00:04:10.319> if<00:04:10.380> we<00:04:10.470> wanted<00:04:11.130> then

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
degrees in radians so if we wanted then

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.550 
degrees in radians so if we wanted then
cut<00:04:11.609> this<00:04:11.760> down<00:04:11.940> from<00:04:12.209> radians<00:04:12.599> to<00:04:12.660> degrees<00:04:12.720> we

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
cut this down from radians to degrees we

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.620 
cut this down from radians to degrees we
have<00:04:13.709> to<00:04:13.829> divide<00:04:14.220> that<00:04:14.250> by<00:04:14.819> fifty-seven<00:04:15.480> point

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
have to divide that by fifty-seven point

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.960 
have to divide that by fifty-seven point
three<00:04:15.930> to<00:04:16.169> get<00:04:16.349> degrees<00:04:16.530> and<00:04:17.070> so<00:04:17.579> this<00:04:17.789> now

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
three to get degrees and so this now

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:19.909 
three to get degrees and so this now
becomes<00:04:18.150> our<00:04:18.510> equation<00:04:19.049> and<00:04:19.229> if<00:04:19.680> we<00:04:19.769> don't

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
becomes our equation and if we don't

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:21.890 
becomes our equation and if we don't
want<00:04:20.099> to<00:04:20.220> find<00:04:20.400> out<00:04:20.549> what<00:04:20.760> little<00:04:21.239> D<00:04:21.390> is<00:04:21.450> we<00:04:21.750> can

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
want to find out what little D is we can

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.899 
want to find out what little D is we can
say<00:04:22.019> little<00:04:22.260> D<00:04:22.500> here<00:04:22.890> is<00:04:23.039> equal<00:04:23.340> to<00:04:23.400> the<00:04:23.610> angle

00:04:23.899 --> 00:04:23.909 
say little D here is equal to the angle

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:26.990 
say little D here is equal to the angle
theta<00:04:25.099> times<00:04:26.099> Big<00:04:26.490> D

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
theta times Big D

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.830 
theta times Big D
/<00:04:27.980> fifty-seven<00:04:28.980> point<00:04:29.370> three<00:04:29.880> and<00:04:30.090> now<00:04:30.570> let's

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
/ fifty-seven point three and now let's

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.600 
/ fifty-seven point three and now let's
go<00:04:30.990> ahead<00:04:31.020> and<00:04:31.290> figure<00:04:31.440> this<00:04:31.680> out<00:04:31.860> for<00:04:32.280> our

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
go ahead and figure this out for our

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.420 
go ahead and figure this out for our
example<00:04:33.300> here<00:04:33.330> so<00:04:34.110> we<00:04:34.230> had<00:04:34.350> an<00:04:34.470> angle<00:04:34.770> of<00:04:34.860> one

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
example here so we had an angle of one

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.810 
example here so we had an angle of one
point<00:04:35.910> eight<00:04:36.210> six<00:04:36.930> three<00:04:37.050> arc<00:04:37.950> minutes<00:04:38.580> and<00:04:38.760> we

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 
point eight six three arc minutes and we

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.180 
point eight six three arc minutes and we
have<00:04:38.940> to<00:04:39.060> divide<00:04:39.360> that<00:04:39.510> by<00:04:39.660> 60<00:04:40.200> to<00:04:40.800> get<00:04:40.980> degrees

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
have to divide that by 60 to get degrees

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:43.220 
have to divide that by 60 to get degrees
so<00:04:41.640> now<00:04:41.760> we<00:04:41.820> convert<00:04:42.240> it<00:04:42.390> from<00:04:42.480> arc<00:04:42.780> Minister

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:43.230 
so now we convert it from arc Minister

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:45.800 
so now we convert it from arc Minister
degrees<00:04:43.530> 60<00:04:44.250> minutes<00:04:44.580> in<00:04:44.700> a<00:04:44.790> degree<00:04:44.820> the

okay well I don't don't need that unit
there<00:05:01.710> because<00:05:01.950> the<00:05:02.010> units<00:05:02.280> will<00:05:02.490> cancel<00:05:02.670> out

there because the units will cancel out

there because the units will cancel out
except<00:05:03.300> for<00:05:03.330> miles<00:05:03.660> so<00:05:03.960> let's<00:05:04.530> try<00:05:04.740> this<00:05:04.800> so<00:05:05.040> we

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.250 
six hundred and sixty so the distance is

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:28.730 
six hundred and sixty so the distance is
two<00:05:26.669> hundred<00:05:27.000> and<00:05:27.120> eleven<00:05:27.240> thousand<00:05:28.169> six

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:28.740 
two hundred and eleven thousand six

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.310 
two hundred and eleven thousand six
hundred<00:05:28.860> and<00:05:29.100> sixty<00:05:29.520> miles<00:05:30.180> and<00:05:30.630> that<00:05:31.169> would

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:31.320 
hundred and sixty miles and that would

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.720 
hundred and sixty miles and that would
be<00:05:31.500> the<00:05:31.680> orbital<00:05:32.520> radius<00:05:33.419> of<00:05:34.020> Io<00:05:34.680> going<00:05:35.520> around

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:35.730 
be the orbital radius of Io going around

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:38.060 
be the orbital radius of Io going around
Jupiter<00:05:35.940> and<00:05:36.720> that's<00:05:36.990> pretty<00:05:37.410> tricky<00:05:37.860> that's

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:38.070 
Jupiter and that's pretty tricky that's

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:40.970 
Jupiter and that's pretty tricky that's
pretty<00:05:38.340> slick<00:05:38.610> here<00:05:38.820> think<00:05:39.390> about<00:05:39.480> it<00:05:39.780> as<00:05:40.740> long

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:40.980 
pretty slick here think about it as long

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:42.680 
pretty slick here think about it as long
as<00:05:41.100> we<00:05:41.250> know<00:05:41.370> the<00:05:41.490> distance<00:05:41.880> to<00:05:41.940> objects<00:05:42.510> and

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.690 
as we know the distance to objects and

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:45.080 
as we know the distance to objects and
we<00:05:42.840> can<00:05:42.990> see<00:05:43.229> we<00:05:44.040> could<00:05:44.220> then<00:05:44.340> and<00:05:44.550> we<00:05:44.820> can<00:05:44.850> see

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.090 
we can see we could then and we can see

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:46.700 
we can see we could then and we can see
an<00:05:45.210> angle<00:05:45.479> we<00:05:45.600> can<00:05:45.720> calculate<00:05:45.960> the<00:05:46.260> angle<00:05:46.560> or

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:46.710 
an angle we can calculate the angle or

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:48.890 
an angle we can calculate the angle or
observe<00:05:46.979> the<00:05:47.130> angle<00:05:47.460> we<00:05:47.550> can<00:05:47.729> figure<00:05:48.210> out<00:05:48.330> how

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:48.900 
observe the angle we can figure out how

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.110 
observe the angle we can figure out how
large<00:05:49.169> things<00:05:49.530> are<00:05:49.710> how<00:05:49.919> are<00:05:49.950> large<00:05:50.669> orbits

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.120 
large things are how are large orbits

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.969 
large things are how are large orbits
are<00:05:51.300> we<00:05:51.510> can<00:05:51.660> figure<00:05:51.810> out<00:05:51.930> how<00:05:52.080> large<00:05:52.260> planets

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:52.979 
are we can figure out how large planets

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:54.680 
are we can figure out how large planets
are<00:05:53.160> and<00:05:53.310> things<00:05:53.460> like<00:05:53.610> that<00:05:53.820> simply<00:05:54.450> by<00:05:54.630> using

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:54.690 
are and things like that simply by using

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:57.620 
are and things like that simply by using
the<00:05:54.990> very<00:05:55.290> simple<00:05:55.710> technique<00:05:56.100> so<00:05:56.729> Big<00:05:57.300> D<00:05:57.479> is

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:57.630 
the very simple technique so Big D is

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:00.110 
the very simple technique so Big D is
the<00:05:57.840> distance<00:05:58.500> to<00:05:59.250> the<00:05:59.370> object<00:05:59.400> we're<00:05:59.880> looking

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.120 
the distance to the object we're looking

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.870 
the distance to the object we're looking
at<00:06:00.440> little<00:06:01.440> D<00:06:01.650> instead<00:06:02.040> of<00:06:02.250> distance<00:06:02.610> R<00:06:02.729> we're

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:02.880 
at little D instead of distance R we're

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.760 
at little D instead of distance R we're
trying<00:06:03.090> to<00:06:03.180> figure<00:06:03.360> out<00:06:03.479> we<00:06:04.320> measure<00:06:04.560> the

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:04.770 
trying to figure out we measure the

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:06.440 
trying to figure out we measure the
angle<00:06:05.130> you<00:06:05.520> plug<00:06:05.850> into<00:06:06.000> that<00:06:06.090> equation

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:06.450 
angle you plug into that equation

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:10.670 
angle you plug into that equation
remember<00:06:07.380> this<00:06:07.590> is<00:06:07.800> in<00:06:07.979> in<00:06:08.510> degrees<00:06:09.510> so<00:06:10.050> if<00:06:10.110> we

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:10.680 
remember this is in in degrees so if we

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.200 
remember this is in in degrees so if we
take<00:06:10.860> the<00:06:11.040> measurement<00:06:11.220> and<00:06:11.669> it's<00:06:11.820> in<00:06:11.970> arc

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:12.210 
take the measurement and it's in arc

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:15.070 
take the measurement and it's in arc
minutes<00:06:12.660> then<00:06:12.930> we<00:06:13.020> have<00:06:13.169> to<00:06:13.320> divide<00:06:13.590> by<00:06:13.740> 60<00:06:14.250> if

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:15.080 
minutes then we have to divide by 60 if

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:17.780 
minutes then we have to divide by 60 if
the<00:06:16.080> measurement<00:06:16.560> is<00:06:16.650> in<00:06:16.680> arc<00:06:16.950> seconds<00:06:17.550> then

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:17.790 
the measurement is in arc seconds then

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:20.000 
the measurement is in arc seconds then
we'll<00:06:17.880> have<00:06:18.060> to<00:06:18.180> divide<00:06:18.450> by<00:06:18.740> 3600<00:06:19.740> because

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:20.010 
we'll have to divide by 3600 because

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:22.640 
we'll have to divide by 3600 because
there's<00:06:20.210> 3,600<00:06:21.210> arc<00:06:21.390> seconds<00:06:21.900> in<00:06:22.020> one<00:06:22.470> degree

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:22.650 
there's 3,600 arc seconds in one degree

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:24.860 
there's 3,600 arc seconds in one degree
and<00:06:23.070> that's<00:06:23.520> how<00:06:23.669> we<00:06:23.729> find<00:06:24.120> out<00:06:24.270> how<00:06:24.540> big

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:24.870 
and that's how we find out how big

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:27.409 
and that's how we find out how big
things<00:06:25.229> actually<00:06:25.590> are<00:06:26.250> so<00:06:26.790> all<00:06:27.090> we<00:06:27.210> need<00:06:27.330> to

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:27.419 
things actually are so all we need to

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:29.740 
things actually are so all we need to
know<00:06:27.540> is<00:06:27.660> the<00:06:27.780> distance<00:06:28.169> and<00:06:28.410> the<00:06:29.160> angle

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:29.750 
know is the distance and the angle

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:32.480 
know is the distance and the angle
unfortunately<00:06:30.750> in<00:06:30.840> astronomy<00:06:31.250> this<00:06:32.250> is

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:32.490 
unfortunately in astronomy this is

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:34.190 
unfortunately in astronomy this is
usually<00:06:32.760> the<00:06:33.030> hardest<00:06:33.419> thing<00:06:33.630> to<00:06:33.660> figure<00:06:34.050> out

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:34.200 
usually the hardest thing to figure out

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:36.620 
usually the hardest thing to figure out
now<00:06:34.830> thanks<00:06:35.250> to<00:06:35.280> Kepler<00:06:35.820> we<00:06:36.210> were<00:06:36.330> able<00:06:36.479> to

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:36.630 
now thanks to Kepler we were able to

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:38.480 
now thanks to Kepler we were able to
figure<00:06:36.930> out<00:06:36.990> the<00:06:37.140> distance<00:06:37.320> to<00:06:37.620> planets<00:06:38.039> but

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:38.490 
figure out the distance to planets but

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:40.250 
figure out the distance to planets but
if<00:06:38.669> we<00:06:38.849> talk<00:06:39.000> about<00:06:39.180> an<00:06:39.390> object<00:06:39.780> that<00:06:39.900> we<00:06:40.050> don't

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:40.260 
if we talk about an object that we don't

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:40.910 
if we talk about an object that we don't
know<00:06:40.349> the<00:06:40.500> distance

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:40.920 
know the distance

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:43.070 
know the distance
to<00:06:41.100> of<00:06:41.310> course<00:06:41.490> we<00:06:42.090> can't<00:06:42.330> use<00:06:42.510> this<00:06:42.660> technique

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:43.080 
to of course we can't use this technique

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.690 
to of course we can't use this technique
you<00:06:43.590> will<00:06:43.740> find<00:06:43.980> out<00:06:44.130> there's<00:06:44.340> lots<00:06:44.520> of

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:44.700 
you will find out there's lots of

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:46.190 
you will find out there's lots of
techniques<00:06:45.030> we<00:06:45.240> came<00:06:45.420> up<00:06:45.570> with<00:06:45.690> in<00:06:45.840> astronomy

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:46.200 
techniques we came up with in astronomy

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:48.500 
techniques we came up with in astronomy
to<00:06:46.710> figure<00:06:46.980> out<00:06:47.100> the<00:06:47.220> distance<00:06:47.430> of<00:06:47.760> things<00:06:47.970> if

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:48.510 
to figure out the distance of things if

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:50.660 
to figure out the distance of things if
we<00:06:48.720> know<00:06:48.840> the<00:06:48.990> distance<00:06:49.410> is<00:06:49.830> the<00:06:50.160> way<00:06:50.310> we<00:06:50.460> find

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:50.670 
we know the distance is the way we find

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:53.420 
we know the distance is the way we find
the<00:06:50.820> size<00:06:51.090> of<00:06:51.270> things
