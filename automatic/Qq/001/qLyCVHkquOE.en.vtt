00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:05.009
 find you to present you the 

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:07.240
 new collection 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.940
 so I told you about it on 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.500
 instagram and you have been many to me 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.840
 ask for a review on it given 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.220
 that every time I promise you 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.430
 do the reviews on the news 

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:19.570
 sigma collections and with the time I 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:20.950
 never find the time because I 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.300
 do other videos of the loupes 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:24.310
 stuff like that because I think that 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.900
 it's more interesting for you so there 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.400
 I said to myself today I'm going to 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.300
 introduce the new collection because 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.300
 it's really worth the trip 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.949
 frankly sigma it's really 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.550
 better and better sense I'm more 

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:36.969
 in addition to crazy 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.929
 so this is the public terminal to the match I 

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:39.129
 will show you everything there is to 

00:00:37.929 --> 00:00:41.649
 inside already I still like 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:43.690
 frankly it's always very good 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:44.109
 finally done here I 'm crazy about this 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.699
 Mark 

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:47.319
 again the only problem is 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:48.940
 shipping and that's it 

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:52.539
 really swelling inside you 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.199
 have a palette that's right here that 

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:55.479
 starts well 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:56.679
 so here are all the products of 

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:58.440
 the new collection so I do not know 

00:00:56.679 --> 00:01:02.170
 absolutely not if you can buy it 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.889
 completely finally in a box or if 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.539
 you can not buy them 

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:05.950
 that individually since I have 

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:07.030
 fasted prices that products 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.259
 individual 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.460
 I will put the links in the bar 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:11.439
 I will try to put you all 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.479
 the links I will do my best 

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:15.070
 really so we'll start all of 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:17.979
 following with the palette knowing that there is 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:21.880
 pencils for the eyes of gloss a 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:23.350
 bluff and an account if their for them 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.579
 lips and that's really great I 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.170
 have never seen in other fights 

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:27.850
 we will start with the palette that 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.500
 is like these and that costs 39 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.909
 dollars so I leave you to them 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.909
 convert that because I do not know 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:35.289
 exactly but it's about 25 26 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:36.939
 euros something like that for a 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:38.380
 palette with eyeshadow I 

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:39.909
 find it really very good so 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.679
 they are like this I'm going 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:43.420
 you have to be at the blue the brown and 

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:46.630
 black 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:49.509
 look at that my god pigmentation 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:52.119
 and you see how like me I do not 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:53.619
 not very sincerely 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:55.749
 sigma products it's these two- world 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:57.009
 it's really bomb and you have to 

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:57.369
 really more so a shop in 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:59.530
 la France 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:01.659
 I do not know everything they want 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.880
 but we really need them closer 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:04.539
 only that 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.440
 then in this new collection 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:08.330
 there are three glosses that they are 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.320
 gorgeous and hyper pigmented part and 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.170
 I had you scotch on 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:15.680
 instagram so the first is the shale 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.480
 ben ben ben the bone which is a rose a rose 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.070
 really gorgeous perfect for 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.920
 fall and for fall for the 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:26.960
 spring and summer and frankly the 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:29.480
 color is crazy and just here I hope 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:33.050
 that you see well I will put you the 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.460
 swatch closer and frankly he 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.680
 is this one really too much 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:39.380
 pretty he is super joly is mine I like 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.240
 many gloss where we find the 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.850
 same color as what we see through 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.200
 and not something transparent what that 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.130
 it's just and resells them I think 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.560
 You see what I mean 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.870
 so there it is really elven who is a 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.950
 purple with iridescent golden I hope 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.920
 sincerely that you will see him at the 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:57.410
 camera because he's just crazy I 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.730
 I'm sure he will not come out too 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.170
 well the camera on the other hand I do not like 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.730
 too much brushes like that I me I 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.670
 personally I prefer brushes 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:07.040
 foam it's right there and we're not going 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.650
 once we finish and we have the get 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.480
 ready which is the nude a bit of the 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.690
 collection but still 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:17.270
 pretty light it is brown brown beige 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:19.459
 with iridescent golden this one it's not 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:21.800
 this one is beautiful 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:23.959
 he is really hyper hyper joly he is 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.850
 just there 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:29.720
 this one he's just too much too 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:30.950
 beautiful with a nice complexion sunburned disorders 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.380
 then we have a blush this is the 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.480
 born to who looks like these 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.200
 which is a pretty natural block that I like 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.360
 very much 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.130
 it's a kind of old rose actually I 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.019
 you the swatch is right here I hope that 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.580
 you'll see it's really an old man 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:45.350
 pink is the kind of bloch that you 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:48.019
 gives a really fresh complexion good looks 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:49.850
 but not good mine warm my 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:51.470
 good strawberries I think you see 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:53.030
 I want to say I want you 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.739
 right there I do not know we see when 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.510
 even because I put a lot so 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:58.250
 we see well and once dimmed it 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.690
 really gives something very 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.459
 very pretty sometimes that I had some 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:03.739
 cream on my hand so I'm struggling to 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:05.269
 stop them but he is really very 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:06.980
 beautiful this one I already used full 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:08.540
 many times and I really like 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:11.600
 a lot and texture of sigma blushes 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.290
 is really very it looks like finally put 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.939
 these powders in may 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.000
 it looks like it's changing limits 

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:19.680
 in cream it's pretty strange but 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.660
 i love i really like the 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.840
 color of this blush then we 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:26.759
 have a lip as if they are in fact the 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.770
 leap concealer what's the point? 

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:31.169
 totally cleared your lips and she is 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.580
 redesigned and bring out by 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:35.340
 example a nice red if you want 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:37.889
 really there the perfect red mouth 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.720
 you really erase all your 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:41.370
 all your lips with this product there 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.580
 it's a kind of concealer actually 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:46.020
 simply I think you can 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.610
 do the same with an anti-dark circles 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.120
 Besides, it's a little bit more 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.740
 liquids 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.410
 we're going to say that like that, I 'll tell you 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:54.330
 master right there is celebrating with that you 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:56.099
 totally erase your lips but 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.380
 take a lip contour pencil 

00:04:56.099 --> 00:05:00.479
 perfectly redraw your lips 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.880
 and you fill with a red to 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:04.800
 lips with the pencil and there it makes you 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.110
 really perfect lips and I 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.639
 find that sigma did really well from 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.830
 take out this kind of product because we 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:12.599
 do not find it everywhere even if a 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:12.930
 concealer can possibly do the 

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:15.120
 job 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:17.190
 I find it really really not bad 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.050
 to have had this product out there then 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:20.789
 we finish with the pencils there are 3 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:22.680
 normally but the third is a 

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:24.599
 brown pencil a basic 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.190
 I can not get my hands on it 

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:28.500
 because I'm going to use two three 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:30.720
 times and they'll be in my drawers 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:32.190
 I searched I did not find them but 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.789
 I will find it, I will tell you 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:37.470
 show it's promised but good both 

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:39.270
 the two original pencils we will say that 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:41.460
 like that are the blues so 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:42.720
 firstly you have a little blue 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.510
 pretty turquoise 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:47.760
 it is really beautiful after having 

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:49.199
 as imported it can be more basic 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.370
 eyelids or something like that 

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:52.380
 because I do not see myself too much a doctor 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:53.940
 the inside of the eye even though I 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:57.300
 say that but it can really do very 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:58.740
 so pretty to see and colorful tutorials 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.630
 come do not worry it's true 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:03.419
 I have a lot of tutorials our news 

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:05.550
 but the hyper- colored tutorials will see 

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:08.490
 to get there little by little I feel I 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:11.849
 feel inspired and so the other is 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:13.530
 the indigo bird so there is a blue 

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:15.210
 a little darker and that is 

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:18.599
 ultra pretty I really like this kind of 

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:22.229
 blue he's really super handsome he's 

00:06:18.599 --> 00:06:24.300
 right there and they are super creamy after 

00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:25.990
 I did not try stopped but good 

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:31.120
 salary to really fade 

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:32.500
 very well so to see but I love 

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:32.860
 the sigma pencils I really like 

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.690
 a lot 

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:36.630
 anyway in general the products 

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:38.740
 cigm age to be really really good 

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:40.690
 when they produced when they go 

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:42.130
 take out their products but that I 

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:43.240
 am saying oh no what's needed 

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:45.700
 because they really have good 

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:47.320
 brushes and in fact it's really 

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:48.700
 no fault what so I'm really 

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:50.020
 very very happy and I'm happy 

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:52.750
 to discover to do you 

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:54.490
 discover all that too so that's it 

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:56.560
 I really hope this video you 

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:58.150
 will have pleased and helped you because I 

00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:01.960
 know that swatch are not hyper 

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:04.150
 easy to find especially in French 

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:05.860
 especially so here I hope that you 

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:07.570
 will have pleased and that will help you of course 

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:08.110
 because it's a little bit of purpose of my 

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:10.060
 videos 

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:11.530
 if you ordered them if you 

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:12.190
 tried or anything 

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:13.300
 do not hesitate 

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:16.050
 regards price as I you 

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:19.780
 had said the pallet is at 39 dollars 

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:20.740
 the pencils are $ 9 so that's 6 

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:22.540
 euros or something like that 

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:24.730
 the book counts if the time is 1 15 

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:27.880
 dollar so it's 11 euros 10 11 

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:29.980
 euros I think and the glosses are at 10 

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:31.720
 dollars so that's seven euros I 

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:33.730
 believe 7 euros something like that 

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:35.650
 finally know that in fact the dollar has 

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:36.940
 always below the euro so if he 

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:39.640
 there is a trick to 10 dollar know that in 

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:41.050
 big it makes me actually I think 

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:42.010
 I hope I was clear I 

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:42.490
 the impression of having say anything 

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:44.860
 what 

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:46.090
 and so to finish the block is at 12 

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:48.580
 dollars so I think it makes 

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:50.080
 about 8 to 9 euros so here are the prices 

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:52.350
 are really not excessive at all and 

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:54.550
 it's a really great quality 

00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:57.010
 so here I am I am very happy 

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:59.020
 and I hope you enjoyed it so 

00:07:57.010 --> 00:08:00.640
 here is waiting for a next video 

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:04.260
 I make you lots of kisses pro 

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:04.260
