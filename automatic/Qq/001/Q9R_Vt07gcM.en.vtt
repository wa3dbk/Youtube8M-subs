00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:03.920
 Spiritual spirit 

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:05.209
 Hello, Hello. 

00:00:05.209 --> 00:00:11.549
 I am Lingling today to introduce the trading plugin in the Minecraft multiplayer server. 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:14.969
 Box store 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.199
 What is a box store? The box store is like this 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:25.199
 A box with a command card, so you can trade with the player if you think the box capacity is not big enough 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.410
 You can put one more 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.310
 It can be like a big box 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.800
 Trading 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.270
 If you have to sell a lot of things 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.530
 Put too many boxes and feel the place 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.670
 That can be like this 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.020
 such 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.390
 Like this around the box 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.260
 Full of instructions 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.950
 Then you can make a big box 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.590
 Use six signage to trade 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.860
 This will not take place 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.340
 Let us look at it. 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.850
 Box store signboard 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.650
 First, the first line 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.920
 Is your ID 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.210
 The second line is the number of transactions. 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:26.210
 The third line is the price of the product. The fourth line is our product. 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:28.939
 That brand is to say, I sold five 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.460
 apple 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.070
 Sold a total of a dollar 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:45.070
 Then let's try to see if we play a brand. 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.100
 The first line is labeled with your ID. 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.909
 The second line is the number of transactions you want to sell a few. 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.940
 One? 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.689
 Two? 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.020
 Or more 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.180
 Come back to the third line. 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.329
 If you are selling, you have to play B. 

00:02:08.329 --> 00:02:14.169
 Then put on the price and finally put on the product. 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:21.669
 This makes the store a success. 

00:02:21.669 --> 00:02:27.019
 Then if you want to collect something, not sell it. 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:30.159
 The same can be done in the box store 

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:32.139
 same 

00:02:32.139 --> 00:02:34.689
 The first line is labeled with our ID. 

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:39.109
 The second line is the number of transactions 

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:43.739
 The third line remembers to change to S when collecting things. 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.469
 If B and S are wrong, itâ€™s bad. 

00:02:51.469 --> 00:02:56.849
 Will change things to sell, sell things, collect things 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:02.879
 That last line, this does not have to be a product name. 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:06.599
 If you know his ID number 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:12.399
 You can also hit his ID number, like wheat is 296 

00:03:12.399 --> 00:03:16.409
 This will succeed if you still feel that the position of the brand is not enough. 

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:22.079
 You can also collect and sell things at the same time. 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:23.819
 Like I want to sell wheat while collecting wheat 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:29.840
 same 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.439
 The first line is marked with an ID. 

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:35.079
 The second line is the number of transactions. 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:38.399
 The third line we sell two dollars 

00:03:38.399 --> 00:03:42.369
 Receive two dollars 

00:03:42.369 --> 00:03:43.879
 In the middle 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:49.939
 Remember to use semicolons to separate the places in the middle. 

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:54.269
 Finally, put on the product name 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:58.959
 This will allow you to sell while selling 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:01.539
 In this way, the box store is finished. 

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:04.969
 Is it very simple? 

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:08.999
 This way you can also trade with the player. 

00:04:08.999 --> 00:04:15.999
