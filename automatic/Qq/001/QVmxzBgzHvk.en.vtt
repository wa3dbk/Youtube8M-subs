00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.000

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.160

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.340
 my camera repositions itself then 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.880

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.039

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.990

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.360

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.890
 I like it there 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.870

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:19.470
 Can he be said that is one 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:20.970
 late nicholas gift and from 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:25.320
 business do not look at you so he fights 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:27.799

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.530

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:33.659

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:37.500
 which camera kuka I do not have that 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:40.079
 Feel I'm shitting and then me 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.850
 So honestly, now is nice 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.270
 nikolaus shops and follow puff peng 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.270
 foil 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:57.240
 that is beautiful calls that that is 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.390
 a really nice idea simply is to 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.460
 was ricky at night as an afterthought 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.960
 Nicholas gift do you mean that to me 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.840
 We had written that and have 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.850
 I nevertheless quite honestly the hlgd 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.860
 In the open, I think that's the way it is 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.790
 may say 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.610
 one of you has already written to me 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.660
 that he no longer who also meant to 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.880
 to me 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:22.370
 yes I have a problem that is again 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.370
 come back and I stand there like that 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.950
 I'll go to Ticino with the 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:33.690
 Compagnie foil around tomorrow 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:37.110
 who in any case, I can only 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.720
 In addition, let's say maybe 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.640
 the this could be my presumption 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:45.330
 to all the shit not yet 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:47.280
 have sent or the whole 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:51.150
 program forum I do not believe that 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:53.370
 In any case if he packages the 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.410
 address, there is still via pn would 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.019
 I have to write and for the team 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.790
 An address already has the best 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:01.590
 even the packstation writes on 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:05.610
 best yet so weak city to 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:09.380
 Packstation 500 old forget the 500 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:15.060
 just forget the packing station number 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:17.970
 151 15 1 and I just hope that's it 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.769
 then it works accordingly 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.150
 I'm so sorry for you that that 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:22.829
 was ever sent back 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.140
 I honestly the mass because of me 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:30.690
 trouble and you have more trouble because dhl 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:33.840
 I'll tell you there longer in any case 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.340
 well, thank you, that will be eternity 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.010
 is also a bit of my turn on 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.630
 my family with headscarves what is 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.530
 because she is all sweeter 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.060
 bicycle 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.989
 I could work on with the 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.989
 fight under 1 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.890
 it's always like this 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:52.510
 I'm always like this and will be here during 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:55.099
 the recording times as a departure is on 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:04:00.890
 Sunny or the blue here looks nice 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:04:02.560
 can dance out before then but 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.819
 Actually, I do not stand that way 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.799
 since then if your detail in the 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:08.900
 Retail is then you learn the 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:10.849
 I really hate winter you come 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.170
 to work the people are only 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:15.849
 annoyed they learn then constantly 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:15.849
 shit out i eat and tap 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:32.389

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:46.490

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:49.550

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:51.080
 my pringles dose on principle so 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:56.360
 really long loose where we as mine 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:57.680
 We see smiling as we have said 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.610
 for those who have my address and still 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.610
 want to send something 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:08.180
 ok for those who have my address 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:09.500
 It's best to have one too 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:12.169
 between my post number and the 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:16.010
 address nor the park city you write 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:18.260
 still packstation 551 and then I hope 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:20.389
 that so it works really does 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.889
 hurts me really out and I lead her 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:25.250
 because of me even more problems places 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:26.900
 Honestly, but me anyway 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:29.510
 find it here now I find it 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:30.740
 much more pleasant me so I come 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:32.150
 me like you in an interview 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:33.349
 they do not look directly into the 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:38.990
 Camera but the always look 

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:40.760
 someday that nobody here so we 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:42.050
 Do it in the same way 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.220
 watching TV looks the same and me 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.800
 honestly think so too 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:48.440
 somehow somehow humana i know too 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:54.349
 not if she was a big thank you aloud 

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:56.690
 Wulff is the bayern say again 

00:05:54.349 --> 00:05:58.340
 to all the me probably into the team 

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:59.990
 is coming in the meantime lately 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.550
 I'm really hard on afterwards 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:02.930
 I'm looking intentionally even the 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:06.409
 all the time on the screen because that 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:07.789
 I just have no value 

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:13.159
 Look for the camera up there 

00:06:07.789 --> 00:06:14.780
 fix that is simply too stupid to 

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:17.810
 all the mails team give a gift so there 

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:18.500
 belong to the black night at the moment I 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:19.310
 I've got a little something 

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:21.260
 wrote 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:22.310
 I can I can already now like 

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.900
 What do I care about that 

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:24.789
 normal are therefore chuck through the 

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:28.340
 to take care of everything 

00:06:24.789 --> 00:06:31.430
 i work so many so many people 

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:33.139
 note as little time as you do 

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:36.919
 are prime suspects in such cases 

00:06:33.139 --> 00:06:39.919
 mostly the black night of the florian 

00:06:36.919 --> 00:06:43.520
 hunter and yesterday express slot 

00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:45.050
 help minute hero and her diana 

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.550
 both of them are permanently active anyway 

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:48.950
 How do you ask me where you take the money 

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:52.010
 I mean fuck me I work 

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:54.159
 somehow over 30 hours a week and 

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:56.960
 I also do not tell myself I bought and 

00:06:54.159 --> 00:06:59.120
 Thank you very much to you, too 

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:01.880
 to you three people because usually 

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:04.060
 on 7 sins only the 3 we will be like that 

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:06.220
 at least only once in passing also 

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:08.140
 and 

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:09.700
 be honest of all screenshots and 

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:13.780
 then she would have to make a video 

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:15.820
 only free to rain videos 

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:17.260

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:18.850

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.410
 Unfortunately, I know your youtube names 

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:23.950
 not under the new layout like that 

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:25.390
 stupid it is also I wish 

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:31.680
 Have a nice evening, or else 

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:31.680
 the next time rings
