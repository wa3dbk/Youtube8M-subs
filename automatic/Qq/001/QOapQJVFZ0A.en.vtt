hey<00:00:01.110> guys<00:00:01.350> now<00:00:01.920> we<00:00:01.979> are<00:00:02.490> going<00:00:02.730> to<00:00:02.939> do<00:00:03.240> the<00:00:03.449> test

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
hey guys now we are going to do the test

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.610 
hey guys now we are going to do the test
of<00:00:04.380> the<00:00:04.680> afore<00:00:05.040> 4:7<00:00:05.670> Alpine<00:00:06.029> the<00:00:06.839> small

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
of the afore 4:7 Alpine the small

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.009 
of the afore 4:7 Alpine the small
amplifier<00:00:07.919> as<00:00:08.220> you<00:00:08.340> can<00:00:08.490> see<00:00:08.700> is<00:00:09.240> right<00:00:09.750> here

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
amplifier as you can see is right here

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.459 
amplifier as you can see is right here
under<00:00:10.469> my<00:00:10.530> radio<00:00:11.190> and<00:00:11.660> my<00:00:12.660> harnesses<00:00:13.259> are

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
under my radio and my harnesses are

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.950 
under my radio and my harnesses are
coming<00:00:14.450> right<00:00:15.450> here<00:00:16.550> this<00:00:17.550> is<00:00:17.609> my<00:00:18.000> other

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
coming right here this is my other

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.580 
coming right here this is my other
harness<00:00:19.560> my<00:00:19.740> their<00:00:20.699> harness<00:00:21.180> from<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.590> radio

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
harness my their harness from the radio

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.519 
harness my their harness from the radio
itself<00:00:23.039> going<00:00:23.820> to<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.300> amplifier<00:00:24.750> and<00:00:24.960> going

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
itself going to the amplifier and going

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.179 
itself going to the amplifier and going
out<00:00:25.859> from<00:00:26.310> it<00:00:26.449> right<00:00:27.449> here<00:00:27.720> as<00:00:28.710> you<00:00:28.890> can<00:00:28.920> see

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
out from it right here as you can see

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.339 
out from it right here as you can see
there's<00:00:29.400> no<00:00:29.640> external<00:00:30.090> amplifiers<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:31.080> now

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
there's no external amplifiers and now

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.120 
there's no external amplifiers and now
we're<00:00:32.099> gonna<00:00:32.279> go<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:33.260> to<00:00:34.260> do<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.559> test<00:00:34.829> so

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
we're gonna go to the to do the test so

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.450 
we're gonna go to the to do the test so
you<00:00:35.190> guys<00:00:35.460> can<00:00:35.670> see<00:00:35.850> it<00:00:36.230> and<00:00:37.230> here<00:00:37.530> we<00:00:37.649> are<00:00:37.680> I

you guys can see it and here we are I
just<00:00:39.180> removed<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.600> grill<00:00:39.809> from<00:00:39.989> my<00:00:40.200> speaker

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
just removed the grill from my speaker

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.040 
just removed the grill from my speaker
so<00:00:40.649> you<00:00:40.680> guys<00:00:40.860> can<00:00:41.040> see<00:00:41.219> it<00:00:41.340> as<00:00:42.210> I<00:00:42.450> remind<00:00:42.750> you

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
external amplifiers and now we're gonna

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.220 
external amplifiers and now we're gonna
go<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.820> to<00:01:29.820> do<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.000> test<00:01:30.390> so<00:01:30.720> you<00:01:30.780> guys<00:01:31.020> can

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:31.230 
go to the to do the test so you guys can

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:35.000 
go to the to do the test so you guys can
see<00:01:31.410> it<00:01:31.790> and<00:01:32.790> here<00:01:33.090> we<00:01:33.120> are<00:01:33.270> I<00:01:33.990> just<00:01:34.470> removed

properly and of course I am like like 10

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.280 
properly and of course I am like like 10
watts<00:01:53.280> away<00:01:53.580> but<00:01:53.820> still<00:01:54.090> you're<00:01:54.750> gonna<00:01:54.869> notice

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
watts away but still you're gonna notice

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.859 
watts away but still you're gonna notice
how<00:01:56.130> how<00:01:56.610> good<00:01:56.850> this<00:01:56.940> is<00:01:57.000> gonna<00:01:57.240> hear<00:01:57.509> I'm

okay now you guys saw it well I remember
that<00:04:00.300> back<00:04:00.660> in<00:04:00.690> those<00:04:00.990> days<00:04:01.020> when<00:04:01.410> I<00:04:01.470> didn't

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:01.770 
that back in those days when I didn't

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:04.550 
that back in those days when I didn't
have<00:04:01.920> that<00:04:02.250> amplifier<00:04:02.790> hooked<00:04:03.060> up<00:04:03.350> hooked<00:04:04.350> up

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
have that amplifier hooked up hooked up

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.520 
have that amplifier hooked up hooked up
to<00:04:04.680> my<00:04:04.830> system<00:04:05.190> my<00:04:05.400> speaker's<00:04:06.240> well<00:04:06.470> they<00:04:07.470> were

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
to my system my speaker's well they were

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.260 
to my system my speaker's well they were
actually<00:04:08.150> making<00:04:09.150> some<00:04:09.420> distortion<00:04:09.960> because
