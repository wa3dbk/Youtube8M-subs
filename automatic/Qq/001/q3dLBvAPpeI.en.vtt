00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
like the sound like after you tell a

00:02:44.770 --> 00:03:26.899 
like the sound like after you tell a
joke<00:02:44.860> right<00:02:45.250> like<00:02:45.490> a<00:02:45.550> bad<00:02:45.700> joke

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:41.030 

so<00:03:37.380> I<00:03:37.849> like<00:03:38.849> this<00:03:39.090> a<00:03:39.330> lot<00:03:39.900> I<00:03:40.410> think<00:03:40.500> it's<00:03:40.860> one<00:03:41.010> of

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
so I like this a lot I think it's one of

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.740 
so I like this a lot I think it's one of
the<00:03:41.250> best<00:03:41.489> weapons<00:03:41.700> and<00:03:42.180> then<00:03:42.599> it's

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
the best weapons and then it's

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.600 
the best weapons and then it's
compatible<00:03:43.349> with<00:03:43.530> the<00:03:43.620> black<00:03:43.800> box<00:03:44.099> with<00:03:44.520> the

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
compatible with the black box with the

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.979 
compatible with the black box with the
Shogun<00:03:44.970> spear<00:03:45.420> to<00:03:45.989> make<00:03:46.110> it<00:03:46.230> even<00:03:46.319> bigger

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
Shogun spear to make it even bigger

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:51.710 
Shogun spear to make it even bigger
right<00:03:49.520> yes<00:03:50.520> totally<00:03:50.970> worth<00:03:51.330> it

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
right yes totally worth it

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.710 
right yes totally worth it
like<00:03:51.959> really<00:03:52.140> you<00:03:52.920> could<00:03:53.069> easily<00:03:53.310> pay<00:03:53.690> $65<00:03:54.690> for

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
like really you could easily pay $65 for

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.410 
like really you could easily pay $65 for
this<00:03:55.170> if<00:03:55.470> it<00:03:55.680> was<00:03:55.830> from<00:03:56.130> Japan<00:03:56.310> maybe<00:03:57.090> more<00:03:57.390> I

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
soon I see a lot of people complaining

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.289 
soon I see a lot of people complaining
about<00:04:10.560> Saban<00:04:11.100> not<00:04:11.370> bringing<00:04:11.700> power<00:04:12.030> morphicon

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:12.299 
about Saban not bringing power morphicon

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:14.059 
about Saban not bringing power morphicon
to<00:04:12.840> where<00:04:12.959> they<00:04:13.080> live<00:04:13.290> either<00:04:13.500> their<00:04:13.769> state<00:04:14.040> or

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:14.069 
to where they live either their state or

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:15.410 
to where they live either their state or
their<00:04:14.220> country<00:04:14.700> or<00:04:14.910> you<00:04:15.060> know<00:04:15.150> somewhere

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
their country or you know somewhere

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:16.310 
their country or you know somewhere
really<00:04:15.600> far<00:04:15.720> away

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
really far away

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.469 
really far away
there's<00:04:16.859> a<00:04:16.950> reason<00:04:17.190> that<00:04:17.400> power<00:04:17.609> morphicon<00:04:17.910> is

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
there's a reason that power morphicon is

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:21.530 
there's a reason that power morphicon is
in<00:04:19.079> Los<00:04:19.620> Angeles<00:04:19.859> or<00:04:20.310> in<00:04:20.340> Pasadena<00:04:21.060> it's

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:21.540 
in Los Angeles or in Pasadena it's

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:24.260 
in Los Angeles or in Pasadena it's
because<00:04:22.410> all<00:04:22.650> of<00:04:22.950> the<00:04:23.070> guests<00:04:23.490> live<00:04:23.850> here<00:04:24.120> and

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
because all of the guests live here and

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:25.820 
because all of the guests live here and
Saban<00:04:24.810> has<00:04:24.990> nothing<00:04:25.320> to<00:04:25.350> do<00:04:25.500> with<00:04:25.530> power

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
Saban has nothing to do with power
