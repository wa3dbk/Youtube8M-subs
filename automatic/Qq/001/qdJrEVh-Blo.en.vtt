so I just decided to go with the two

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.039 
so I just decided to go with the two
first<00:01:17.400> that<00:01:17.640> you<00:01:17.700> know<00:01:17.790> become<00:01:18.060> unlocked<00:01:18.360> for

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
it's very tricky to know exactly how

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.920 
it's very tricky to know exactly how
much<00:01:23.340> damage<00:01:23.549> each<00:01:23.850> weapon<00:01:24.090> does<00:01:24.390> because

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
much damage each weapon does because

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.179 
much damage each weapon does because
both<00:01:25.110> of<00:01:25.140> these<00:01:25.320> shoot<00:01:25.560> shotgun<00:01:25.979> shells

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
both of these shoot shotgun shells

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.830 
both of these shoot shotgun shells
filled<00:01:26.369> with<00:01:26.580> pellets<00:01:26.939> rather<00:01:27.270> than<00:01:27.509> just<00:01:27.720> a

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
filled with pellets rather than just a

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.420 
filled with pellets rather than just a
bullet<00:01:28.170> like<00:01:28.439> an<00:01:28.530> assault<00:01:28.770> rifle<00:01:28.799> or<00:01:29.070> an<00:01:29.189> SMG

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
bullet like an assault rifle or an SMG

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.399 
bullet like an assault rifle or an SMG
with<00:01:29.670> you<00:01:29.820> because<00:01:30.299> of<00:01:30.570> this<00:01:30.630> is<00:01:30.810> very<00:01:31.110> hard<00:01:31.290> to

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
with you because of this is very hard to

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.289 
with you because of this is very hard to
know<00:01:31.560> how<00:01:31.770> many<00:01:31.829> pellets<00:01:32.340> hit<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.729> enemy<00:01:32.909> when

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
know how many pellets hit the enemy when

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.370 
know how many pellets hit the enemy when
trying<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:33.540> figure<00:01:33.750> out<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.960> damages

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
trying to figure out the damages

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.960 
trying to figure out the damages
starting<00:01:34.979> with<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.159> Remington<00:01:35.520> I've<00:01:35.700> seen

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
starting with the Remington I've seen

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.630 
starting with the Remington I've seen
people<00:01:36.030> say<00:01:36.630> does<00:01:36.869> 25<00:01:37.229> damage<00:01:37.799> per<00:01:37.979> bullet<00:01:38.130> all

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
people say does 25 damage per bullet all

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.399 
people say does 25 damage per bullet all
the<00:01:38.880> way<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.030> 50<00:01:39.420> however<00:01:39.960> I'm<00:01:40.079> just<00:01:40.229> gonna<00:01:40.350> go

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
the way to 50 however I'm just gonna go

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.230 
the way to 50 however I'm just gonna go
with<00:01:40.560> 50<00:01:40.860> damage<00:01:40.979> per<00:01:41.280> pellet<00:01:41.610> close<00:01:42.000> range

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
with 50 damage per pellet close range

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.810 
with 50 damage per pellet close range
and<00:01:42.509> about<00:01:42.720> 10<00:01:43.020> to<00:01:43.110> 15<00:01:43.259> long<00:01:43.740> range<00:01:43.979> for<00:01:44.610> shots

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
and about 10 to 15 long range for shots

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.399 
and about 10 to 15 long range for shots
to<00:01:44.939> kill<00:01:45.090> that<00:01:45.299> depends<00:01:45.659> on<00:01:45.750> how<00:01:45.930> many<00:01:45.990> pellets

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
to kill that depends on how many pellets

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.020 
to kill that depends on how many pellets
actually<00:01:46.770> hit<00:01:46.979> your<00:01:47.130> enemy<00:01:47.430> because<00:01:47.939> it

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
actually hit your enemy because it

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.550 
actually hit your enemy because it
shoots<00:01:48.240> a<00:01:48.360> pellets<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:48.869> each<00:01:48.990> one<00:01:49.170> does<00:01:49.259> 50

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
shoots a pellets and each one does 50

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.080 
shoots a pellets and each one does 50
damage<00:01:49.710> it<00:01:50.070> has<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.430> ability<00:01:50.759> to<00:01:50.790> deliver

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
damage it has the ability to deliver

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.300 
damage it has the ability to deliver
over<00:01:51.329> 400<00:01:52.079> points<00:01:52.229> of<00:01:52.409> damage<00:01:52.470> with<00:01:52.829> just<00:01:53.070> one

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
over 400 points of damage with just one

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.770 
over 400 points of damage with just one
shell<00:01:53.579> which<00:01:53.970> is<00:01:54.090> why<00:01:54.210> you<00:01:54.270> often<00:01:54.540> get

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
shell which is why you often get

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.330 
shell which is why you often get
multiple<00:01:55.170> kills<00:01:55.350> with<00:01:55.500> one<00:01:55.680> shot<00:01:55.920> using<00:01:56.130> this

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
multiple kills with one shot using this

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.310 
multiple kills with one shot using this
gun<00:01:56.549> however<00:01:57.240> if<00:01:57.329> only<00:01:57.570> one<00:01:57.780> pellet<00:01:57.990> hits<00:01:58.229> the

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
gun however if only one pellet hits the

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.020 
gun however if only one pellet hits the
enemy<00:01:58.530> you<00:01:58.740> will<00:01:58.770> get<00:01:58.979> only<00:01:59.159> one<00:01:59.549> hit<00:01:59.729> marker

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
enemy you will get only one hit marker

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.450 
enemy you will get only one hit marker
which<00:02:00.479> is<00:02:00.630> rare<00:02:00.869> but<00:02:01.140> it<00:02:01.200> does<00:02:01.290> happen<00:02:01.439> for<00:02:02.399> the

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
which is rare but it does happen for the

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.920 
which is rare but it does happen for the
s12<00:02:02.820> you're<00:02:03.000> looking<00:02:03.180> at<00:02:03.270> around<00:02:03.360> 30<00:02:03.689> damage

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
s12 you're looking at around 30 damage

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.569 
s12 you're looking at around 30 damage
close<00:02:04.229> range<00:02:04.500> and<00:02:04.649> six<00:02:04.890> damage<00:02:05.100> long<00:02:05.369> range

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
close range and six damage long range

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.550 
close range and six damage long range
again<00:02:06.180> that's<00:02:06.390> per<00:02:06.630> pellet<00:02:06.990> eight<00:02:07.140> pellets

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
again that's per pellet eight pellets

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.229 
again that's per pellet eight pellets
per<00:02:07.680> shell<00:02:07.920> so<00:02:08.129> like<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.399> r870<00:02:08.849> you<00:02:08.940> have<00:02:09.090> the

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
per shell so like the r870 you have the

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.820 
per shell so like the r870 you have the
ability<00:02:09.300> to<00:02:09.599> get<00:02:09.780> one<00:02:09.929> shot<00:02:10.110> kills<00:02:10.379> you<00:02:10.709> get

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
ability to get one shot kills you get

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.320 
ability to get one shot kills you get
them<00:02:10.950> slightly<00:02:11.220> less<00:02:11.520> often<00:02:11.730> but<00:02:12.150> with<00:02:12.239> the

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
them slightly less often but with the

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.430 
them slightly less often but with the
240<00:02:12.870> max<00:02:13.050> damn

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
240 max damn

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.990 
240 max damn
the<00:02:13.560> power<00:02:13.740> is<00:02:13.920> definitely<00:02:14.310> there<00:02:14.460> as<00:02:14.730> for<00:02:14.970> the

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
the power is definitely there as for the

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.520 
the power is definitely there as for the
rates<00:02:15.180> of<00:02:15.240> fire<00:02:15.300> with<00:02:15.630> these<00:02:15.750> weapons<00:02:16.080> the<00:02:16.200> s12

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
rates of fire with these weapons the s12

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:17.690 
rates of fire with these weapons the s12
obviously<00:02:17.160> takes<00:02:17.370> it<00:02:17.490> with<00:02:17.550> its

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
obviously takes it with its

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.670 
obviously takes it with its
semi-automatic<00:02:18.330> abilities<00:02:18.750> while<00:02:19.080> the<00:02:19.260> r870

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
semi-automatic abilities while the r870

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.590 
semi-automatic abilities while the r870
is<00:02:19.800> a<00:02:19.890> true<00:02:20.100> pump<00:02:20.400> shotgun<00:02:20.790> so<00:02:21.090> before<00:02:21.240> every

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
is a true pump shotgun so before every

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.420 
is a true pump shotgun so before every
shot<00:02:21.780> you<00:02:21.930> need<00:02:22.140> to<00:02:22.320> pump<00:02:22.500> it<00:02:22.680> also<00:02:23.190> just<00:02:23.340> a

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
shot you need to pump it also just a

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:24.890 
shot you need to pump it also just a
sign<00:02:23.640> of<00:02:23.670> spring<00:02:23.850> counseling<00:02:24.450> and<00:02:24.600> why<00:02:24.720> why

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
sign of spring counseling and why why

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.930 
sign of spring counseling and why why
mid<00:02:25.230> pump<00:02:25.500> does<00:02:25.710> not<00:02:25.920> work<00:02:26.160> you<00:02:26.640> need<00:02:26.790> to<00:02:26.850> go

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
mid pump does not work you need to go

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.190 
mid pump does not work you need to go
through<00:02:27.090> the<00:02:27.180> full<00:02:27.390> pumping<00:02:27.750> animation

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
through the full pumping animation

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.110 
through the full pumping animation
before<00:02:28.500> you<00:02:28.590> can<00:02:28.710> fire<00:02:28.890> again<00:02:29.220> now<00:02:29.670> 80<00:02:29.970> rounds

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
before you can fire again now 80 rounds

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.790 
before you can fire again now 80 rounds
per<00:02:30.330> minute<00:02:30.420> seems<00:02:30.660> incredibly<00:02:31.260> slow<00:02:31.530> but

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
per minute seems incredibly slow but

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.110 
per minute seems incredibly slow but
it's<00:02:31.920> definitely<00:02:32.130> fast<00:02:32.460> enough<00:02:32.730> when<00:02:32.910> paired

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
it's definitely fast enough when paired

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.580 
it's definitely fast enough when paired
with<00:02:33.180> its<00:02:33.390> strong<00:02:33.510> damage<00:02:33.960> for<00:02:34.320> you<00:02:34.380> to<00:02:34.440> pull

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
with its strong damage for you to pull

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.230 
with its strong damage for you to pull
off<00:02:34.680> those<00:02:34.830> montage<00:02:35.310> killfeeds<00:02:35.850> so<00:02:36.120> it

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
off those montage killfeeds so it

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.910 
off those montage killfeeds so it
doesn't<00:02:36.420> really<00:02:36.510> matter<00:02:36.690> that<00:02:36.990> much<00:02:37.200> the

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
doesn't really matter that much the

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.320 
doesn't really matter that much the
magazine<00:02:38.250> size<00:02:38.430> with<00:02:38.580> the<00:02:38.640> s12<00:02:38.940> is<00:02:39.090> also

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
magazine size with the s12 is also

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:40.850 
magazine size with the s12 is also
slightly<00:02:39.510> larger<00:02:40.020> but<00:02:40.440> it's<00:02:40.560> a<00:02:40.590> little<00:02:40.770> more

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:32.390 
is a lot more effective for the bullet
spreads<00:03:31.200> and<00:03:31.350> recoil<00:03:31.680> patterns<00:03:31.980> I<00:03:32.070> decide<00:03:32.370> to

spreads and recoil patterns I decide to

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.710 
spreads and recoil patterns I decide to
shoot<00:03:32.610> for<00:03:32.910> shells<00:03:33.150> while<00:03:33.330> aiming<00:03:33.540> down

guns starting with the ABS recall it is

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.000 
guns starting with the ABS recall it is
very<00:03:39.390> very<00:03:39.870> small<00:03:40.290> the<00:03:40.500> bullets<00:03:40.739> birds<00:03:40.920> are

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
very very small the bullets birds are

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.680 
very very small the bullets birds are
incredibly<00:03:41.580> tight<00:03:41.820> which<00:03:42.269> is<00:03:42.390> why<00:03:42.510> they<00:03:42.660> are

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
incredibly tight which is why they are

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.660 
incredibly tight which is why they are
sometimes<00:03:42.959> referred<00:03:43.290> to<00:03:43.500> as<00:03:43.650> overpowered<00:03:44.550> and

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
sometimes referred to as overpowered and

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.280 
sometimes referred to as overpowered and
so<00:03:45.150> the<00:03:45.239> hip<00:03:45.360> fire<00:03:45.510> spreads<00:03:45.780> nothing<00:03:46.140> too

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
so the hip fire spreads nothing too

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:47.720 
so the hip fire spreads nothing too
crazy<00:03:46.440> but<00:03:46.769> something<00:03:47.070> I<00:03:47.130> didn't<00:03:47.370> notice<00:03:47.489> is

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
crazy but something I didn't notice is

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.400 
crazy but something I didn't notice is
that<00:03:47.760> with<00:03:48.030> the<00:03:48.060> Remington<00:03:48.600> the<00:03:48.989> pellet<00:03:49.260> teams

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
that with the Remington the pellet teams

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.290 
that with the Remington the pellet teams
travel<00:03:49.769> higher<00:03:49.980> while<00:03:50.340> being<00:03:50.550> shot<00:03:50.880> while<00:03:51.120> the

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:51.300 
travel higher while being shot while the

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.060 
travel higher while being shot while the
s12<00:03:51.630> pellets<00:03:51.959> seem<00:03:52.140> to<00:03:52.260> go<00:03:52.350> a<00:03:52.380> little<00:03:52.560> lower<00:03:52.769> so

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
s12 pellets seem to go a little lower so

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:54.080 
s12 pellets seem to go a little lower so
that's<00:03:53.400> just<00:03:53.430> something<00:03:53.550> to<00:03:53.790> keep<00:03:53.910> in<00:03:54.030> mind

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
that's just something to keep in mind

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.880 
that's just something to keep in mind
while<00:03:54.420> your<00:03:54.630> hip<00:03:54.780> firing<00:03:55.050> but<00:03:55.620> when<00:03:55.709> it's<00:03:55.830> all

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
while your hip firing but when it's all

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:57.380 
while your hip firing but when it's all
said<00:03:56.070> and<00:03:56.130> done<00:03:56.220> the<00:03:56.340> shotguns<00:03:56.790> are<00:03:56.910> really

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
said and done the shotguns are really

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.540 
said and done the shotguns are really
fun<00:03:57.630> to<00:03:57.750> use<00:03:57.959> and<00:03:57.989> do<00:03:58.410> work<00:03:58.590> with<00:03:58.800> but<00:03:59.370> are

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
fun to use and do work with but are

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.310 
fun to use and do work with but are
terrible<00:04:00.150> to<00:04:00.269> play<00:04:00.450> against<00:04:00.690> especially<00:04:01.170> from

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320 
terrible to play against especially from

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.570 
terrible to play against especially from
close<00:04:01.530> range<00:04:01.650> you<00:04:02.160> can<00:04:02.190> make<00:04:02.400> an<00:04:02.489> argument

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
close range you can make an argument

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.759 
close range you can make an argument
that<00:04:02.910> they<00:04:03.060> are<00:04:03.180> overpowered<00:04:03.959> or<00:04:04.290> you<00:04:04.470> can<00:04:04.590> say

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
that they are overpowered or you can say

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:06.290 
that they are overpowered or you can say
that<00:04:04.800> well<00:04:05.130> you<00:04:05.280> know<00:04:05.370> this<00:04:05.550> is<00:04:05.580> how<00:04:05.850> shotgun

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:06.300 
that well you know this is how shotgun

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:07.820 
that well you know this is how shotgun
should<00:04:06.540> be<00:04:06.690> but<00:04:07.140> either<00:04:07.260> way<00:04:07.440> after<00:04:07.680> using

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 
should be but either way after using

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:09.740 
should be but either way after using
both<00:04:08.070> of<00:04:08.220> these<00:04:08.280> weapons<00:04:08.489> a<00:04:08.790> lot<00:04:09.150> i<00:04:09.390> would<00:04:09.630> have

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
both of these weapons a lot i would have

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.270 
both of these weapons a lot i would have
to<00:04:09.870> give<00:04:09.989> it<00:04:10.080> to<00:04:10.170> the<00:04:10.260> r870<00:04:10.800> it<00:04:10.980> fits<00:04:11.160> my

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
to give it to the r870 it fits my

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.770 
to give it to the r870 it fits my
personal<00:04:11.640> playstyle<00:04:11.970> really<00:04:12.390> well<00:04:12.540> it's

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
personal playstyle really well it's

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.570 
personal playstyle really well it's
damage<00:04:13.440> is<00:04:13.560> just<00:04:13.680> ridiculous<00:04:14.250> and<00:04:14.430> the

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 
damage is just ridiculous and the

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:15.890 
damage is just ridiculous and the
reloading<00:04:14.940> shell<00:04:15.120> by<00:04:15.209> shell<00:04:15.420> can<00:04:15.570> be<00:04:15.660> really

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
reloading shell by shell can be really

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.360 
reloading shell by shell can be really
effective<00:04:16.109> as<00:04:16.380> well<00:04:16.560> but<00:04:17.010> what<00:04:17.130> do<00:04:17.190> you<00:04:17.250> guys

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
effective as well but what do you guys

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:18.800 
effective as well but what do you guys
think<00:04:17.430> which<00:04:17.910> gun<00:04:18.090> is<00:04:18.209> better<00:04:18.359> and<00:04:18.630> do<00:04:18.750> you

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
think which gun is better and do you

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.509 
think which gun is better and do you
think<00:04:19.019> that<00:04:19.169> either<00:04:19.350> these<00:04:19.620> are<00:04:19.859> overpowered

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
think that either these are overpowered

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.400 
think that either these are overpowered
if<00:04:20.880> you<00:04:21.060> do<00:04:21.209> say<00:04:21.390> one<00:04:21.600> is<00:04:21.690> opie<00:04:21.989> you<00:04:22.169> have<00:04:22.289> to

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
if you do say one is opie you have to

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:23.719 
if you do say one is opie you have to
back<00:04:22.560> it<00:04:22.590> up<00:04:22.740> with<00:04:22.890> some<00:04:23.070> sort<00:04:23.280> of<00:04:23.370> reasoning

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:23.729
