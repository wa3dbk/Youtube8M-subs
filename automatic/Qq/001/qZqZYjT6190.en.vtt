00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
watt all of you guys said it wasn't

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:08.000 
watt all of you guys said it wasn't
gonna<00:00:07.410> make<00:00:07.649> it

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
gonna make it

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.259 
gonna make it
well<00:00:08.189> I've<00:00:08.340> been<00:00:08.370> using<00:00:08.639> it<00:00:08.849> for<00:00:08.880> quite<00:00:09.030> some

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
well I've been using it for quite some

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.169 
well I've been using it for quite some
time<00:00:09.300> and<00:00:09.719> it<00:00:09.780> hasn't<00:00:09.929> died<00:00:10.230> so<00:00:11.210> there<00:00:12.210> it<00:00:13.110> is<00:00:13.469> a

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:14.179 
time and it hasn't died so there it is a

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:16.640 
time and it hasn't died so there it is a
little<00:00:15.179> under<00:00:15.540> six<00:00:16.020> and<00:00:16.139> a<00:00:16.170> half<00:00:16.199> inches<00:00:16.590> long

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
little under six and a half inches long

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.380 
little under six and a half inches long
so<00:00:17.340> it's<00:00:17.430> definitely<00:00:17.730> not<00:00:17.820> a<00:00:17.880> big<00:00:18.060> power<00:00:18.240> show

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
so it's definitely not a big power show

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.390 
so it's definitely not a big power show
it's<00:00:18.630> not<00:00:18.660> a<00:00:18.810> big<00:00:19.050> power<00:00:19.260> supply<00:00:19.619> it<00:00:19.680> is<00:00:19.859> it'll

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
it's not a big power supply it is it'll

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.900 
it's not a big power supply it is it'll
fit<00:00:20.730> if<00:00:21.000> I<00:00:21.539> put<00:00:21.689> in<00:00:21.779> my<00:00:21.900> elite<00:00:22.109> 120<00:00:22.730> for<00:00:23.730> like<00:00:23.880> a

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
fit if I put in my elite 120 for like a

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.179 
fit if I put in my elite 120 for like a
month<00:00:24.420> or<00:00:24.660> however<00:00:24.779> long<00:00:24.930> I've<00:00:25.140> had<00:00:25.230> this<00:00:25.500> so

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
month or however long I've had this so

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.740 
month or however long I've had this so
let's<00:00:26.310> go<00:00:26.400> ahead<00:00:26.519> and<00:00:26.730> measure<00:00:26.849> we<00:00:27.599> don't

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
let's go ahead and measure we don't

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.690 
let's go ahead and measure we don't
really<00:00:27.840> need<00:00:28.050> to<00:00:28.140> measure<00:00:28.289> one<00:00:28.500> PCI<00:00:28.800> Express

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:31.700 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.799 

we<00:00:32.700> need<00:00:32.850> to<00:00:32.910> do<00:00:33.000> is<00:00:33.059> pull<00:00:33.239> them<00:00:33.329> out<00:00:33.510> over

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
we need to do is pull them out over

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:34.850 
we need to do is pull them out over
there<00:00:33.930> that'll<00:00:34.140> hold<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.290> power<00:00:34.530> supply

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
there that'll hold the power supply

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.920 
there that'll hold the power supply
would<00:00:35.070> do<00:00:37.219> about<00:00:38.219> 18<00:00:38.579> inches<00:00:38.760> they<00:00:39.450> can't<00:00:39.719> see

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
would do about 18 inches they can't see

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.100 
would do about 18 inches they can't see
it<00:00:40.050> but<00:00:40.290> I<00:00:40.590> mean<00:00:40.920> kind<00:00:41.190> of<00:00:41.840> 18<00:00:42.840> inches

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
it but I mean kind of 18 inches

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.049 
it but I mean kind of 18 inches
there<00:00:45.110> we<00:00:46.110> measure<00:00:46.289> my<00:00:46.469> status<00:00:47.039> which<00:00:47.730> goes

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
there we measure my status which goes

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.880 
there we measure my status which goes
really<00:00:48.480> really<00:00:48.690> long<00:00:48.930> cool<00:00:51.320> and<00:00:52.320> I<00:00:52.410> have<00:00:52.620> put

really really long cool and I have put
this<00:00:53.010> in<00:00:53.190> a<00:00:53.250> trooper<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:53.940> it<00:00:54.030> fit<00:00:54.270> so<00:00:54.300> I<00:00:55.140> don't

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770

funny bet I'm gonna flip the power
supply<00:01:06.930> over<00:01:13.369> the<00:01:14.369> 24<00:01:14.939> pin<00:01:15.210> is<00:01:15.360> pretty<00:01:16.049> short

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
supply over the 24 pin is pretty short

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
there you go so that's kind of sure it

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.219 
there you go so that's kind of sure it
does<00:01:36.720> come<00:01:37.170> though<00:01:38.070> on<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:39.030> ponytail<00:01:39.509> with

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
does come though on the ponytail with

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.170 
does come though on the ponytail with
two<00:01:40.619> CPU<00:01:41.189> eight<00:01:41.340> pins<00:01:41.579> that<00:01:41.759> can<00:01:41.909> be<00:01:42.000> divvied

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
two CPU eight pins that can be divvied

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.210 
two CPU eight pins that can be divvied
up<00:01:42.360> into<00:01:42.570> four<00:01:42.780> pins<00:01:42.990> so<00:01:45.680> about<00:01:46.680> a<00:01:46.740> five<00:01:47.009> out

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
up into four pins so about a five out

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.690 
up into four pins so about a five out
there<00:01:47.490> so<00:01:48.090> to<00:01:48.270> ITX<00:01:48.689> rigs<00:01:49.079> you<00:01:49.229> could<00:01:49.610> that<00:01:50.610> was

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
there so to ITX rigs you could that was

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.760 
there so to ITX rigs you could that was
good<00:01:50.820> about<00:01:51.000> 22<00:01:51.509> inches<00:01:52.549> okay<00:01:54.350> so<00:01:55.350> that's<00:01:55.560> good

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
good about 22 inches okay so that's good

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.130 
good about 22 inches okay so that's good
there<00:01:56.040> and<00:01:56.640> I<00:01:57.240> wanted<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:57.689> bring<00:01:57.810> this<00:01:57.930> up

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140
