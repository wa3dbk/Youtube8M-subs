00:00:00.959 --> 00:00:06.130
 here with the bomber simone that emotions 

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:08.830
 there was for your first pious goal 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:10.719
 stony and above all the sorrow for 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:12.009
 this defeat that could have a 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:12.370
 different result especially after the 

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:16.209
 your goal 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:18.890
 yes certainly park of defeat 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:20.599
 that was heavy 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.460
 unfortunately we were not good artists 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:25.170
 is 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.080
 the second the secondary 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.810
 take goals because we are there 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.680
 stretched and 2 maximum we were wrong 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.990
 then in progress 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.880
 half happy because he scored a goal 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:38.800
 it is known however in the service practically 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:42.020
 no percent 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:44.060
 I postpone the important goal 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.950
 the next game the qualities are 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.690
 out of the question, however, for you 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.270
 important season because the pebble 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.980
 he bet everything on the hard for what 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:55.090
 it's about the attack and so yes 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:58.760
 expect so much from the ground yes we say that 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:02.140
 this thing does not think it will start 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:04.940
 the circle of paying them 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.670
 for example today I did from the pear tree 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.860
 in my opinion I didn't play very well 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:13.520
 wrong some things the rules more 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.590
 simple and I will try to improve with the 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.780
 reason 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:20.009
 maybe because the league at least this 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:23.380
 according to me that is they do not expect 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.759
 the team, however, is known who is looking for 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.409
 all the Sinti continue 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:30.490
 also empowered by the team 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:31.890
 not just from the team house a nice one 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.159
 point therefore 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.150
 be them 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:38.050
 they seek and trust me I am 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.910
 much of the time 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.500
 I saw that compared to the past 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:43.660
 This season is not a provocation 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.040
 but it is a compliment to the 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.750
 past season also mentally 6 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.130
 it seemed very concentrated it does not leave you 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.360
 go to the defenders provocations that 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.030
 have searched over and over again 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.440
 you have also been under two or three goals and 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.000
 not always calm and quiet too 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.190
 why take some yellow cereals 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.450
 also risk of disqualifications not 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.510
 hates ammunition 4 punishment 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.900
 yes we say that last year they are 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.850
 fell for 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.590
 in the pool and provocations but it was 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.990
 absolutely my fault 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.530
 it is true that it is also true that over time it will 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.300
 grows I think not 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.900
 I like it if the inquiry grows below 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.959
 this point of view is a hundred 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.159
 I leave the last question behind you 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:21.079
 goal you gave yourself for this 

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:22.640
 season to the number of goals interview the 

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:25.000
 number of goals you do not know exactly 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.010
 however I hope to arrive in double figures 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:33.400
 more than anything else to score important goals 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.400
 which serve for the kun thanks sorry house 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:46.900
 yes it was the very mara push 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:50.220
 I believe he says that therefore according to he had 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.220
 seen the tip water looks like that 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.490
 the girls with them 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.020
 in the game and maybe after the draw me 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.730
 remember that makes you feel 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:03.380
 unfortunately it went wrong 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:05.800
 personally before the wrong goal 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:08.680
 an opportunity for that 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:11.800
 We have been saying that the impression is famous 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.420
 that you create a lot you reach the limit 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.370
 area to spell pronunciation to be 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.530
 incisive as you should 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.610
 we are wrong if we are indeed well 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.860
 try to be 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:25.120
 decisive and more 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.120
 we are strong threatened the strike 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:31.370
 who admits there is here I said respect 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.900
 to services with far fewer opportunities and 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.150
 when it happens to you 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.310
 you are an outcome 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.599
 I followed expects so much from you on 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.769
 all about more aspects from this 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:41.870
 championship 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:44.180
 I first hope to do well with 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.830
 the team because then accordingly 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:50.170
 to do well 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:50.170
 this is also possible to build 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:53.140
 thank you
