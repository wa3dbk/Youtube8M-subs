00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
want to do that they think that the

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.030 
want to do that they think that the
leaves<00:01:12.150> are<00:01:12.420> crusty<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.110> gross<00:01:13.350> so<00:01:13.710> they<00:01:13.830> cut

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
leaves are crusty and gross so they cut

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.080 
leaves are crusty and gross so they cut
them<00:01:14.159> off<00:01:14.250> but<00:01:14.400> then<00:01:14.520> what<00:01:14.640> ends<00:01:14.850> up<00:01:14.909> happening

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
them off but then what ends up happening

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.630 
them off but then what ends up happening
is<00:01:15.420> they<00:01:15.570> cut<00:01:15.840> off<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:16.170> lot<00:01:16.619> of<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.890> berry<00:01:17.100> but

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
is they cut off a lot of the berry but

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.700 
is they cut off a lot of the berry but
