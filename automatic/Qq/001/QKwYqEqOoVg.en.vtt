00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:12.599
 since 1972 there is the audi 80 was after 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.120
 four generations of audi a4 1995 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.070
 In total, the vehicles were replaced 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.720
 Sold twelve million times worldwide 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.539
 Now let's look at what the new one is 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.070
 audi a4 can do better 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:25.800
 he has become taller and so comes the 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.680
 new audi 25 centimeters stretched and 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.840
 therefore, about 1.8 centimeters widened 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.920
 but let's just ask him 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.870
 Experts what the design has done 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.879
 that caught all there with the king of chain 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.370
 we have a distinct then narrower 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:45.000
 and wider coaches grid where we too 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.070
 which grew to more angular and then 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.079
 every single even the oriental lamella 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.710
 then continue here either from 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.030
 this beautiful very beautiful 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:57.000
 important nature on a new a4 with 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.070
 two hooks or here at the spread too 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.539
 also emphasize the widespread muscular 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.680
 the textile design sportiness 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:06.780
 at the same time we have to emphasize on 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.200
 that we then at a4 then as the basis 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.840
 xenon and then offer led around 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.299
 marvin matips led that's just the same 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.250
 we have here then we have these too 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.670
 These fleas are here in the broad like 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.080
 even then emphasize the broad 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.820
 Let's start here and emphasize 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.729
 the bird from the athletic came with 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.740
 two lines and then we follow 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.140
 then continue all the riders with these whole 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.380
 very sharp fugger and it like a whole 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.180
 very sharp v moderate then knife where 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.759
 But then we have the holding power 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.490
 much more precise this year lose 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:44.490
 then it was continued until the 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.340
 tail lights then tail lights then 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.320
 show our again what we got there 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.990
 found in the front as a light signature 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.869
 with two hooks we find here with one 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.180
 very big hook then typical new 4 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.759
 design luminous design that we know 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:03.390
 but I live here and that's where I am 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:06.210
 the dkv for the limousine where we have one 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.280
 very keen then radiate that 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.020
 hottest radii we ever audi 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.560
 have done then around the 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.620
 earth this great scene worth 0 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.470
 23 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.930
 also reach the interior of the new 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.849
 audi is even more modern and offers 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.080
 as new as ours 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:24.080
 Experienced experts 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:33.269
 so very long and narrow 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:36.540
 then blackboard and here we find we 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:40.260
 Also known as the auditor cockpit by Ntt 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:44.190
 and a very narrow screen with 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.780
 up to 8 2 inch big screen that 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.480
 we also do that or centrality 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:51.390
 emphasize then we have this too 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:54.120
 new mmi concept no longer change with 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:57.660
 four keys but in the case with the 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.310
 audi mmi navigation plus then with touch 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.930
 is to buy with this little justin 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.379
 not so clear and clear then completely 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:07.769
 Nice to write to everyone 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:09.359
 and all the conditions and element 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:12.060
 the unconditional is from zero 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:14.220
 from new customers as well 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.280
 new in the audi a4 are the drive train 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.310
 and the chassis engine location but 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.790
 denied it though with the new ones 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:25.590
 motor range we have at all three 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:28.650
 motors four tdi is then we have the 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:31.200
 performance has risen by 25 percent and 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:34.260
 The command then to consume a 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.829
 until the 21 percent the whole dropped 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.370
 Great 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:42.720
 Although we have a performance then tensioned 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:44.790
 until so from 150 ps to 1 272 ps is one 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.720
 racing big but at the same time 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.379
 consumption ago 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:51.090
 then we have only from 590 grams we 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:54.239
 then a witness with a two liter tdi 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:57.000
 the ultra for the sedan and 90 grams 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:59.579
 with this engine for the avant like the 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.709
 two liter tfsi thanks to this new bed 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:05.480
 cycle then have the decision 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:06.989
 we then with 190 ps standard consumption of 4 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.810
 4.8 liters 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:12.209
 That will give a co2 output of 109 grams 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:15.690
 and so we produce less 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:18.359
 less then co2 consume it with 1.4 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.949
 tfsi the gear changes are per 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:22.070
 manual six-speed manual transmission 

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:23.690
 performed or you leave 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:26.780
 either on the seven-speed s tronic 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:28.850
 or on the eight stages tiptronic the 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.610
 avant models from audi enjoy themselves 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:33.560
 Ever since popularity as avant 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.030
 also offers the new audi a4 clearly 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.410
 More is being used and what exactly is it 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.720
 different from the limousine 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:40.520
 that's what the expert has to say 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.440
 to recognize a true design 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:45.140
 then we close the line then 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:47.480
 we have a mcculloch here so we can 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:48.890
 then these great goals worth 0.6 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:51.290
 and almost reach the train that 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:55.850
 very top of the pops that the very best 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:57.440
 and then we have a rear spoiler the 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.570
 is not only simple continuous 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.940
 but completely filigree 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:06.440
 then as this deep in the amount of 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:08.300
 dynamically optimized as well as the blade and 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.980
 also the load volume of the kombis can 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:13.280
 be quite impressive 

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:15.290
 the new a4 avant we have 15 liters 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:18.850
 that generated more than the predecessor 

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:22.250
 a total volume of 505 liters with the 

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:25.700
 unfolded plans up to 1510 liters that 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:27.740
 is the biggest instrument that will be here 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:31.880
 then a few highlights on a wide 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:34.010
 span integrates that error is and 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.770
 so if we do the sport dirty 

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:38.210
 shoes or even a beer then work 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:40.520
 want to ride along want 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:42.650
 Please do not slippery and everyone 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.870
 fall then leave me and nobody was there 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:46.580
 audi promises that the a4 at 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:49.190
 Driving behavior a big jump 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:51.020
 has made the basis for the improvement 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:52.550
 are the newly developed five handlebars 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:54.920
 axes as well as the electromechanical ones 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:56.540
 steering the audi a4 is as well 

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:58.250
 predecessor of the audi 80 always one 

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:00.620
 been a technology carrier and one of the 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:02.510
 showcase models of the brand whether the new 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:04.130
 audi a4 actually drives better 

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:05.570
 as his predecessor , we look at 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:07.960
 the driving presentation at the next 

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:07.960
 appointment
