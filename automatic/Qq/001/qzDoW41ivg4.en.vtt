00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
fast you're going in this game if you

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.959 
fast you're going in this game if you
grab<00:00:11.910> you<00:00:12.450> will<00:00:12.690> instantly<00:00:13.440> stop<00:00:14.160> you'll<00:00:14.820> also

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
grab you will instantly stop you'll also

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.570 
grab you will instantly stop you'll also
take<00:00:15.089> a<00:00:15.269> small<00:00:15.630> step<00:00:15.809> forward<00:00:16.350> which<00:00:17.190> is

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
take a small step forward which is

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.349 
take a small step forward which is
important<00:00:18.359> here<00:00:19.289> on<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:20.130> ground<00:00:20.400> up<00:00:20.939> in<00:00:21.180> front

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
important here on the ground up in front

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:22.640 
important here on the ground up in front
of<00:00:21.420> me<00:00:21.480> there's<00:00:21.630> a<00:00:21.689> fence<00:00:21.960> there's<00:00:22.500> an

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
of me there's a fence there's an

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.259 
of me there's a fence there's an
invisible<00:00:22.890> wall<00:00:23.189> above<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.640> fence<00:00:23.910> that<00:00:24.119> goes

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
invisible wall above the fence that goes

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.630 
invisible wall above the fence that goes
up<00:00:24.420> pretty<00:00:24.630> high<00:00:24.990> if<00:00:25.289> you<00:00:25.949> can<00:00:26.039> land<00:00:26.460> on<00:00:26.580> that

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
up pretty high if you can land on that

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.040 
up pretty high if you can land on that
fence<00:00:27.000> you<00:00:27.210> can<00:00:27.240> get<00:00:27.480> out<00:00:27.599> of<00:00:27.720> bounds<00:00:28.019> here

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
fence you can get out of bounds here

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.820 
fence you can get out of bounds here
pretty<00:00:28.349> fast<00:00:28.439> so<00:00:29.720> the<00:00:30.720> fastest<00:00:31.230> way<00:00:31.410> as<00:00:31.560> far<00:00:31.740> as

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
pretty fast so the fastest way as far as

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.010 
pretty fast so the fastest way as far as
I<00:00:31.920> know<00:00:31.980> to<00:00:32.099> do<00:00:32.340> this<00:00:32.550> is<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:33.120> kick<00:00:33.420> off<00:00:33.660> of<00:00:33.690> that

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
I know to do this is to kick off of that

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.520 
I know to do this is to kick off of that
wall

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
wall

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.459 
wall
turn<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.399> then<00:00:36.030> grab<00:00:36.300> so<00:00:36.780> you<00:00:36.840> stop<00:00:37.170> right

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
turn and then grab so you stop right

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.680 
turn and then grab so you stop right
here<00:00:37.670> this<00:00:38.670> is<00:00:38.820> pretty<00:00:38.969> hard<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.510> it's

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
here this is pretty hard and it's

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.830 
here this is pretty hard and it's
ridiculously<00:00:40.350> silly<00:00:40.969> if<00:00:41.969> you<00:00:42.300> don't<00:00:42.570> do<00:00:42.719> that

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
ridiculously silly if you don't do that

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.690 
ridiculously silly if you don't do that
grab<00:00:43.110> you'll<00:00:43.620> be<00:00:43.770> moving<00:00:44.010> you'll<00:00:44.430> have<00:00:44.550> too

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
grab you'll be moving you'll have too

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.490 
grab you'll be moving you'll have too
much<00:00:44.789> momentum<00:00:45.030> basically<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:46.260> you'll<00:00:46.379> just

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
much momentum basically and you'll just

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.160 
much momentum basically and you'll just
fall<00:00:46.739> off<00:00:47.059> there's<00:00:48.059> a<00:00:48.149> shorter<00:00:48.600> invisible

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
fall off there's a shorter invisible

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.170 
fall off there's a shorter invisible
wall<00:00:49.320> over<00:00:49.800> this<00:00:49.980> fence<00:00:50.190> which<00:00:50.730> I<00:00:50.910> just

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
wall over this fence which I just

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.729 
wall over this fence which I just
decided<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:51.600> show<00:00:51.750> you<00:00:51.809> because<00:00:52.079> I<00:00:52.230> missed<00:00:52.590> it

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
decided to show you because I missed it

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.100 
decided to show you because I missed it
the<00:00:52.920> first<00:00:52.949> time<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.850> from<00:00:54.660> here<00:00:54.809> you<00:00:54.870> can<00:00:54.899> get

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
the first time and from here you can get

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.350 
the first time and from here you can get
down<00:00:55.230> to<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.469> streets<00:00:55.770> because<00:00:56.610> over<00:00:56.850> here

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
down to the streets because over here

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.540 
down to the streets because over here
there<00:00:57.780> is<00:00:57.989> a<00:00:58.020> gate<00:00:58.590> that<00:00:58.890> we<00:00:59.039> need<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.280> get<00:00:59.430> on

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
there is a gate that we need to get on

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.819 
there is a gate that we need to get on
the<00:00:59.640> other<00:00:59.670> side<00:00:59.820> of<00:01:00.410> which<00:01:01.410> it<00:01:01.620> has<00:01:01.710> no

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
the other side of which it has no

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.549 
the other side of which it has no
collision<00:01:02.250> detection<00:01:02.460> so<00:01:02.850> yeah<00:01:03.350> other<00:01:04.350> ways

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
collision detection so yeah other ways

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.170 
collision detection so yeah other ways
to<00:01:04.710> get<00:01:04.799> up<00:01:04.920> here<00:01:05.159> this<00:01:05.700> is<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.939> most

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
to get up here this is the most

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.940 
to get up here this is the most
consistent<00:01:06.570> way<00:01:06.840> for<00:01:07.020> me<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.140> get<00:01:07.350> get<00:01:07.710> up<00:01:07.799> on

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
consistent way for me to get get up on

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.350 
consistent way for me to get get up on
this<00:01:08.070> building<00:01:08.400> by<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.549> way<00:01:08.790> that<00:01:09.090> I<00:01:09.119> just<00:01:09.180> did

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
this building by the way that I just did

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.679 
this building by the way that I just did
there<00:01:09.799> but<00:01:10.799> there's<00:01:11.070> a<00:01:11.130> few<00:01:11.820> other<00:01:12.060> ways<00:01:12.180> you

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
there but there's a few other ways you

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.590 
there but there's a few other ways you
can<00:01:12.900> get<00:01:13.159> out<00:01:14.159> of<00:01:14.400> bounds<00:01:14.760> here<00:01:14.790> this<00:01:15.390> is

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
can get out of bounds here this is

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.440 
can get out of bounds here this is
really<00:01:15.990> this<00:01:16.259> is<00:01:16.380> an<00:01:16.439> easy<00:01:16.590> one<00:01:16.830> but<00:01:17.549> it's<00:01:17.729> 14

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
really this is an easy one but it's 14

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.960 
really this is an easy one but it's 14
or<00:01:18.600> 15<00:01:19.110> seconds<00:01:19.500> slower<00:01:19.830> than<00:01:19.979> that<00:01:20.159> kick<00:01:20.610> grab

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
or 15 seconds slower than that kick grab

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.289 
or 15 seconds slower than that kick grab
way<00:01:22.159> so<00:01:23.159> you<00:01:23.250> can<00:01:23.400> kick<00:01:23.549> off<00:01:23.729> that<00:01:23.909> wall<00:01:24.090> and

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
way so you can kick off that wall and

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.600 
way so you can kick off that wall and
then<00:01:24.479> just<00:01:24.659> run<00:01:24.869> over<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:25.290> that<00:01:25.409> gate<00:01:25.650> that

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
then just run over to that gate that

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.240 
then just run over to that gate that
ways<00:01:26.759> pretty<00:01:26.970> slow<00:01:27.320> there<00:01:28.320> are<00:01:28.350> better<00:01:28.979> ways

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
ways pretty slow there are better ways

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.060 
ways pretty slow there are better ways
that<00:01:29.790> I'm<00:01:29.909> about<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.299> show<00:01:30.540> you<00:01:30.890> third<00:01:31.890> way<00:01:32.040> to

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
that I'm about to show you third way to

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.649 
that I'm about to show you third way to
do<00:01:32.310> it<00:01:32.430> is<00:01:32.579> once<00:01:32.880> you're<00:01:33.000> up<00:01:33.090> here<00:01:33.119> above<00:01:33.479> the

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
do it is once you're up here above the

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.540 
do it is once you're up here above the
barrel<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.140> door<00:01:34.320> and<00:01:34.439> stuff

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:35.550 
barrel and the door and stuff

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.270 
barrel and the door and stuff
you<00:01:35.940> can<00:01:36.240> stand<00:01:36.720> in<00:01:37.320> between<00:01:37.980> these<00:01:38.100> air

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
you can stand in between these air

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.910 
you can stand in between these air
conditioner<00:01:38.700> units<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.740> point<00:01:40.740> your

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
conditioner units and point your

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.010 
conditioner units and point your
reticule<00:01:41.280> at<00:01:41.580> that<00:01:41.790> box<00:01:42.120> to<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.510> left<00:01:42.690> of<00:01:42.900> the

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
reticule at that box to the left of the

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.110 
reticule at that box to the left of the
gate<00:01:43.200> down<00:01:43.410> there<00:01:43.710> then<00:01:44.460> you<00:01:44.580> can<00:01:44.730> just<00:01:44.880> run

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:45.120 
gate down there then you can just run

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.870 
gate down there then you can just run
forward<00:01:45.570> jump<00:01:46.440> and<00:01:46.770> if<00:01:47.460> you<00:01:47.580> have<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.790> right

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
forward jump and if you have the right

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.520 
forward jump and if you have the right
speed<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:48.210> stuff<00:01:48.540> you'll<00:01:48.810> land<00:01:49.170> right<00:01:49.500> here

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
speed and stuff you'll land right here

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.560 
speed and stuff you'll land right here
on<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.430> on<00:01:50.730> the<00:01:50.910> visible<00:01:51.180> wall

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
on the on the visible wall

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.870 
on the on the visible wall
if<00:01:52.110> you<00:01:52.320> roll<00:01:52.650> off<00:01:52.920> of<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.130> invisible<00:01:53.730> wall

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
if you roll off of the invisible wall

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.700 
if you roll off of the invisible wall
you<00:01:54.450> can<00:01:54.840> make<00:01:54.960> it<00:01:55.080> down<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:55.230> the<00:01:55.320> streets<00:01:55.560> that

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
you can make it down to the streets that

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.790 
you can make it down to the streets that
way<00:01:55.830> -<00:01:55.890> which<00:01:56.310> is<00:01:56.430> good<00:01:57.410> another<00:01:58.410> way<00:01:58.590> to<00:01:58.650> get

00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:58.800 
way - which is good another way to get

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.470 
way - which is good another way to get
down<00:01:58.950> there<00:01:59.160> is<00:01:59.310> to<00:01:59.460> stand<00:01:59.700> on<00:01:59.820> the<00:01:59.940> corner<00:02:00.150> of

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:00.480 
down there is to stand on the corner of

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.670 
down there is to stand on the corner of
this<00:02:00.630> building<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:01.490> then<00:02:03.200> when<00:02:04.200> I<00:02:04.230> do<00:02:04.320> it<00:02:04.530> you

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
this building and then when I do it you

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.530 
this building and then when I do it you
can<00:02:04.830> point<00:02:04.980> your<00:02:05.130> reticule<00:02:05.550> at<00:02:05.910> the<00:02:06.150> corner<00:02:06.510> of

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
can point your reticule at the corner of

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.320 
can point your reticule at the corner of
the<00:02:06.840> awning<00:02:07.350> like<00:02:07.800> right<00:02:08.010> there<00:02:08.220> side<00:02:09.030> jump

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
the awning like right there side jump

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.840 
the awning like right there side jump
and<00:02:09.930> you'll<00:02:10.050> land<00:02:10.200> on<00:02:10.380> it<00:02:10.560> that<00:02:11.190> ways<00:02:11.340> pretty

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
and you'll land on it that ways pretty

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.480 
and you'll land on it that ways pretty
consistent<00:02:12.420> -<00:02:12.890> this<00:02:13.890> is<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:14.130> way<00:02:14.220> that<00:02:14.370> I'm

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
consistent - this is the way that I'm

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:15.980 
consistent - this is the way that I'm
gonna<00:02:14.670> do<00:02:14.850> it<00:02:14.970> though<00:02:15.120> because<00:02:15.300> it<00:02:15.570> is<00:02:15.660> 100%

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
gonna do it though because it is 100%

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.930 
gonna do it though because it is 100%
consistent<00:02:16.980> and<00:02:17.130> you<00:02:17.190> can<00:02:17.340> do<00:02:17.430> it<00:02:17.520> pretty<00:02:17.610> fast

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
consistent and you can do it pretty fast

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.370 
consistent and you can do it pretty fast
if<00:02:18.630> you<00:02:18.720> get<00:02:18.870> up<00:02:18.990> here<00:02:19.350> and<00:02:19.550> then<00:02:21.260> turn<00:02:22.260> around

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
if you get up here and then turn around

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.030 
if you get up here and then turn around
on<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:23.070> ledge<00:02:23.310> and<00:02:23.700> then<00:02:24.240> jump<00:02:24.830> you'll<00:02:25.830> land

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
on the ledge and then jump you'll land

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.980 
on the ledge and then jump you'll land
on<00:02:26.190> it<00:02:26.400> and<00:02:26.550> if<00:02:26.880> you<00:02:26.970> roll<00:02:27.180> off<00:02:27.360> like<00:02:27.630> I<00:02:27.720> said

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
on it and if you roll off like I said

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
on it and if you roll off like I said
you'll<00:02:28.200> make<00:02:28.380> it<00:02:28.500> down<00:02:28.650> here

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
you'll make it down here

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.940 
you'll make it down here
and<00:02:29.100> then<00:02:29.550> you<00:02:29.610> can<00:02:29.730> go<00:02:29.850> right<00:02:30.060> to<00:02:30.120> the<00:02:30.360> fence

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
and then you can go right to the fence

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.610 
and then you can go right to the fence
now<00:02:31.950> for<00:02:32.220> the<00:02:32.310> actual<00:02:32.790> skip<00:02:33.270> once<00:02:34.200> you're<00:02:34.380> down

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
now for the actual skip once you're down

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.560 
now for the actual skip once you're down
on<00:02:34.650> the<00:02:34.800> streets<00:02:35.340> you<00:02:35.760> go<00:02:35.940> to<00:02:36.000> the<00:02:36.240> other<00:02:36.360> side

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
on the streets you go to the other side

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.680 
on the streets you go to the other side
of<00:02:36.600> this<00:02:36.750> gate<00:02:37.260> you<00:02:37.790> go<00:02:38.790> inside<00:02:39.090> this<00:02:39.240> door<00:02:39.510> in

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
of this gate you go inside this door in

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.390 
of this gate you go inside this door in
the<00:02:39.810> building<00:02:40.140> now<00:02:40.800> in<00:02:40.980> the<00:02:41.040> middle<00:02:41.250> of<00:02:41.310> this

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
the building now in the middle of this

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.280 
the building now in the middle of this
building<00:02:41.850> there's<00:02:42.300> a<00:02:42.420> hole<00:02:42.840> that<00:02:43.020> you<00:02:43.170> can

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
building there's a hole that you can

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.229 
building there's a hole that you can
fall<00:02:43.500> down<00:02:43.530> I'm<00:02:44.220> pointing<00:02:44.550> at<00:02:44.640> it<00:02:44.790> don't<00:02:45.090> go

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
fall down I'm pointing at it don't go

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.449 
fall down I'm pointing at it don't go
over<00:02:45.390> there<00:02:45.530> trust<00:02:46.530> me<00:02:46.650> you<00:02:46.980> don't<00:02:47.070> want<00:02:47.310> to<00:02:47.340> do

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
over there trust me you don't want to do

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.729 
over there trust me you don't want to do
that<00:02:47.690> there's<00:02:48.690> a<00:02:48.780> wall<00:02:49.050> in<00:02:49.080> here<00:02:49.440> we<00:02:49.590> need<00:02:49.680> to

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
that there's a wall in here we need to

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:52.449 
that there's a wall in here we need to
get<00:02:49.890> on<00:02:49.980> top<00:02:50.190> of<00:02:50.220> this<00:02:50.430> for<00:02:50.610> the<00:02:50.670> skip<00:02:51.260> there

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
get on top of this for the skip there

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.580 
get on top of this for the skip there
you<00:02:53.459> can<00:02:53.610> do<00:02:53.730> this<00:02:53.910> this<00:02:54.239> way<00:02:54.420> is<00:02:54.480> kind<00:02:55.320> of<00:02:55.380> slow

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
you can do this this way is kind of slow

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.530 
you can do this this way is kind of slow
you<00:02:55.920> can<00:02:56.070> also<00:02:56.250> get<00:02:56.550> a<00:02:56.610> speed<00:02:56.940> bolts<00:02:57.239> on<00:02:57.330> there

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
you can also get a speed bolts on there

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:58.910 
you can also get a speed bolts on there
if<00:02:57.630> you<00:02:57.750> aim<00:02:57.870> in<00:02:57.989> right<00:02:58.170> which<00:02:58.380> is<00:02:58.650> a<00:02:58.680> couple

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
if you aim in right which is a couple

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.250 
if you aim in right which is a couple
seconds<00:02:59.370> faster<00:02:59.790> just<00:03:00.000> from<00:03:00.660> skipping<00:03:01.140> the

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
seconds faster just from skipping the

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.530 
seconds faster just from skipping the
slow<00:03:01.470> animation<00:03:01.950> there<00:03:02.360> there<00:03:03.360> is<00:03:03.510> another

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
slow animation there there is another

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.270 
slow animation there there is another
wall<00:03:04.020> on<00:03:04.260> top<00:03:04.440> of<00:03:04.590> this<00:03:04.709> one<00:03:04.860> that's<00:03:05.040> pretty

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
wall on top of this one that's pretty

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.330 
wall on top of this one that's pretty
short<00:03:05.550> that's<00:03:06.450> how<00:03:06.660> I<00:03:06.690> get<00:03:06.870> on<00:03:07.050> top<00:03:07.260> of<00:03:07.290> it<00:03:07.500> I<00:03:07.709> do

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
short that's how I get on top of it I do

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.729 
short that's how I get on top of it I do
a<00:03:08.820> wall<00:03:09.090> climb<00:03:09.360> and<00:03:09.630> then<00:03:09.690> side<00:03:09.959> jump<00:03:10.200> on<00:03:10.470> it

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
a wall climb and then side jump on it

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:12.199 
a wall climb and then side jump on it
just<00:03:11.160> to<00:03:11.250> show<00:03:11.400> you<00:03:11.459> that<00:03:11.640> there's<00:03:11.820> actually

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
just to show you that there's actually

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.390 
just to show you that there's actually
another<00:03:12.390> invisible<00:03:12.870> wall<00:03:13.080> here<00:03:13.350> if<00:03:13.560> you<00:03:14.220> move

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
another invisible wall here if you move

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.699 
another invisible wall here if you move
down<00:03:14.430> here<00:03:15.180> yep<00:03:15.810> I<00:03:15.959> fall<00:03:16.170> I<00:03:16.320> fell<00:03:16.560> down<00:03:16.650> a

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
down here yep I fall I fell down a

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.740 
down here yep I fall I fell down a
little<00:03:16.890> bit<00:03:17.040> you<00:03:17.970> need<00:03:18.090> to<00:03:18.180> be<00:03:18.239> on<00:03:18.330> top<00:03:18.480> of<00:03:18.660> the

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
little bit you need to be on top of the

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.100 
little bit you need to be on top of the
higher<00:03:18.930> one<00:03:20.270> so<00:03:21.270> once<00:03:21.450> you're<00:03:21.570> on<00:03:21.630> top<00:03:21.840> of<00:03:21.989> the

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
higher one so once you're on top of the

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.070 
higher one so once you're on top of the
higher<00:03:22.290> one<00:03:22.560> you<00:03:23.550> can<00:03:23.730> run<00:03:23.880> along<00:03:24.000> it<00:03:24.390> to<00:03:24.959> the

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
higher one you can run along it to the

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.320 
higher one you can run along it to the
ED<00:03:25.290> to<00:03:25.620> the<00:03:25.739> end<00:03:25.860> of<00:03:25.950> the<00:03:26.010> building<00:03:26.370> there's<00:03:27.180> a

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
ED to the end of the building there's a

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.030 
ED to the end of the building there's a

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
window here that would be a window on

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.010 
window here that would be a window on
the<00:03:29.070> other<00:03:29.130> side<00:03:29.459> and<00:03:29.790> if<00:03:30.720> you<00:03:30.810> keep<00:03:30.989> going

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.020 
the other side and if you keep going

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.160 
the other side and if you keep going
you'll<00:03:31.440> fall<00:03:31.680> down<00:03:32.010> into<00:03:32.430> nothing<00:03:33.000> but<00:03:33.750> there

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
you'll fall down into nothing but there

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.979 
you'll fall down into nothing but there

I still got a heavy landing of course
and<00:04:15.780> now<00:04:16.650> this<00:04:16.800> is<00:04:16.950> on<00:04:17.070> console<00:04:17.670> and<00:04:18.060> this<00:04:18.959> is

and now this is on console and this is

and now this is on console and this is
showing<00:04:19.260> the<00:04:19.380> route<00:04:19.560> for<00:04:19.770> console<00:04:20.840> if<00:04:21.840> you

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.080 
showing the route for console if you

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:24.560 
showing the route for console if you
pause<00:04:22.380> by<00:04:22.920> the<00:04:22.980> way<00:04:23.190> you<00:04:23.490> can<00:04:23.700> have<00:04:23.910> it<00:04:24.060> load

you<00:04:24.780> inside<00:04:25.350> of<00:04:25.560> the<00:04:25.710> wall<00:04:25.920> and<00:04:26.190> then<00:04:26.790> you<00:04:26.880> can

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
you inside of the wall and then you can

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.750 
you inside of the wall and then you can
jump<00:04:27.240> right<00:04:27.510> over<00:04:27.570> to<00:04:28.020> this<00:04:28.260> which<00:04:29.190> is<00:04:29.220> really

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 
jump right over to this which is really

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.850 
jump right over to this which is really
good<00:04:29.910> for<00:04:29.940> console<00:04:30.510> this<00:04:31.170> skip<00:04:31.410> definitely

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
good for console this skip definitely

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.820 
good for console this skip definitely
saves<00:04:32.070> more<00:04:32.370> time<00:04:32.610> on<00:04:32.910> ps3<00:04:33.720> or<00:04:33.900> xbox<00:04:34.170> because

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
saves more time on ps3 or xbox because

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.520 
saves more time on ps3 or xbox because
the<00:04:35.520> route<00:04:35.760> is<00:04:35.910> different<00:04:35.940> and<00:04:36.570> using<00:04:37.410> the

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
the route is different and using the

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.430 
the route is different and using the
skip<00:04:37.830> puts<00:04:38.370> you<00:04:38.520> on<00:04:38.760> the<00:04:39.630> console<00:04:40.020> route

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
skip puts you on the console route

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.670 
skip puts you on the console route
whereas<00:04:41.070> on<00:04:41.280> PC<00:04:41.700> you<00:04:41.820> have<00:04:41.850> to<00:04:42.150> go<00:04:43.050> over<00:04:43.350> to<00:04:43.530> the

normal speed run by the way when you're

the<00:05:02.160> angle<00:05:02.550> you<00:05:02.730> want<00:05:03.000> is<00:05:03.450> almost<00:05:04.200> completely

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.130 
the angle you want is almost completely

the angle you want is almost completely
straight<00:05:05.490> ahead<00:05:05.610> just<00:05:06.180> a<00:05:06.300> little<00:05:06.600> bit<00:05:06.780> left

because if you go to left you'll miss

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:10.880 
because if you go to left you'll miss
the<00:05:09.300> loading<00:05:09.570> zone<00:05:09.750> if<00:05:10.350> you<00:05:10.410> tried<00:05:10.680> a<00:05:10.710> few

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:10.890 
the loading zone if you tried a few

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:12.320 
the loading zone if you tried a few
times<00:05:11.100> you<00:05:11.280> should<00:05:11.370> be<00:05:11.700> able<00:05:11.820> to<00:05:11.970> figure<00:05:12.180> out

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330 
times you should be able to figure out

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.800 
times you should be able to figure out
and<00:05:12.600> figure<00:05:12.840> it<00:05:12.870> out<00:05:12.990> though<00:05:13.970> so<00:05:14.970> remember<00:05:15.000> the

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:15.810 
and figure it out though so remember the

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:17.750 
and figure it out though so remember the
top<00:05:16.020> the<00:05:16.740> small<00:05:16.980> screen<00:05:17.220> there<00:05:17.400> is<00:05:17.520> going<00:05:17.670> to

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:17.760 
top the small screen there is going to

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.420 
top the small screen there is going to
be<00:05:17.940> doing<00:05:18.120> a<00:05:18.540> pretty<00:05:19.320> normal<00:05:19.800> speed<00:05:20.040> run<00:05:20.250> a

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
be doing a pretty normal speed run a

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.730 
be doing a pretty normal speed run a
pretty<00:05:20.910> good<00:05:21.090> speed<00:05:21.330> run<00:05:21.510> to<00:05:21.740> actually

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 
pretty good speed run to actually

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.800 
pretty good speed run to actually
there's<00:05:23.580> at<00:05:23.700> least<00:05:23.730> one<00:05:23.970> trick<00:05:24.180> I<00:05:24.300> use<00:05:24.630> here

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:24.810 
there's at least one trick I use here

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.170 
there's at least one trick I use here
that<00:05:24.990> I<00:05:25.020> probably<00:05:25.290> wouldn't<00:05:25.830> do<00:05:26.070> in<00:05:26.760> a<00:05:26.880> normal

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:27.180 
that I probably wouldn't do in a normal

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.050 
that I probably wouldn't do in a normal
speed<00:05:27.360> run<00:05:27.540> so<00:05:27.960> I<00:05:28.290> mean<00:05:29.280> I<00:05:29.310> would<00:05:29.430> try<00:05:29.760> it<00:05:29.820> but<00:05:30.030> I

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 
speed run so I mean I would try it but I

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:31.400 
speed run so I mean I would try it but I
would<00:05:30.210> probably<00:05:30.360> fail<00:05:30.810> it<00:05:31.020> because<00:05:31.260> I<00:05:31.290> never

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:31.410 
would probably fail it because I never

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:35.090 
would probably fail it because I never
actually<00:05:31.830> get<00:05:32.220> it<00:05:32.340> on<00:05:32.430> my<00:05:32.550> first<00:05:32.820> try<00:05:34.100> just

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:35.100 
actually get it on my first try just

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.550 
actually get it on my first try just
like<00:05:35.250> now<00:05:35.460> so<00:05:35.970> I<00:05:36.390> also<00:05:36.750> don't<00:05:37.110> do<00:05:37.230> a<00:05:37.260> speed

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:37.560 
like now so I also don't do a speed

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.650 
like now so I also don't do a speed
vault<00:05:37.740> on<00:05:37.890> top<00:05:38.070> of<00:05:38.250> the<00:05:38.400> wall<00:05:38.610> here<00:05:39.000> inside<00:05:39.540> the

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:39.660 
vault on top of the wall here inside the

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:41.630 
vault on top of the wall here inside the
building<00:05:39.960> because<00:05:40.430> when<00:05:41.430> I<00:05:41.460> actually

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:41.640 
building because when I actually

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.130 
building because when I actually
recorded<00:05:42.120> the<00:05:42.180> skip<00:05:42.450> I<00:05:42.600> didn't<00:05:42.960> know<00:05:43.050> you

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:43.140 
recorded the skip I didn't know you

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:48.240 
recorded the skip I didn't know you
could<00:05:43.260> do<00:05:43.350> that<00:05:43.850> so<00:05:44.850> here<00:05:45.090> I<00:05:45.120> died<00:05:45.480> go<00:05:45.750> for<00:05:45.960> this

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:48.250 

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:50.680 

so<00:05:49.250> just<00:05:49.670> so<00:05:49.760> you<00:05:49.880> know<00:05:49.910> the<00:05:50.120> time<00:05:50.390> here

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:50.690 
so just so you know the time here

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:52.450 
so just so you know the time here
because<00:05:50.990> there's<00:05:51.650> gonna<00:05:51.770> be<00:05:51.950> a<00:05:51.980> timer<00:05:52.250> that

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:52.460 
because there's gonna be a timer that

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:53.830 
because there's gonna be a timer that
appears<00:05:52.850> once<00:05:53.030> I<00:05:53.180> press<00:05:53.360> the<00:05:53.540> button<00:05:53.570> the

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:53.840 
appears once I press the button the

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.740 
appears once I press the button the
first<00:05:54.020> time<00:05:54.700> that<00:05:55.700> will<00:05:55.880> count<00:05:56.300> how<00:05:56.420> long<00:05:56.510> it

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:56.750 
first time that will count how long it

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:59.250 
first time that will count how long it
takes<00:05:56.930> the<00:05:57.200> normal<00:05:57.440> speed<00:05:57.770> run<00:05:58.010> to<00:05:58.220> get<00:05:58.430> here

00:05:59.250 --> 00:05:59.260 
takes the normal speed run to get here

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.810 
takes the normal speed run to get here
so<00:06:00.260> this<00:06:00.500> time<00:06:00.770> that<00:06:01.010> it<00:06:01.130> will<00:06:01.520> end<00:06:01.670> up<00:06:01.760> being

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:01.820 
so this time that it will end up being

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:06.880 
so this time that it will end up being
will<00:06:02.420> be<00:06:02.890> it'll<00:06:03.890> be<00:06:03.950> very<00:06:04.070> variable<00:06:05.890> because

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:06.890 
will be it'll be very variable because

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:09.130 
will be it'll be very variable because
depending<00:06:07.250> on<00:06:07.670> the<00:06:08.060> trick<00:06:08.570> right<00:06:08.750> now<00:06:08.900> that

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:09.140 
depending on the trick right now that

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:10.990 
depending on the trick right now that
the<00:06:09.320> smaller<00:06:09.560> screen<00:06:09.800> is<00:06:09.980> doing<00:06:10.250> that's<00:06:10.820> what

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:11.000 
the smaller screen is doing that's what

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.150 
the smaller screen is doing that's what
I<00:06:11.030> usually<00:06:11.330> miss<00:06:11.570> so<00:06:12.410> if<00:06:12.500> I<00:06:12.620> don't<00:06:12.800> do<00:06:12.980> that

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:13.160 
I usually miss so if I don't do that

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.370 
I usually miss so if I don't do that
then<00:06:13.760> the<00:06:13.970> skip<00:06:14.240> would<00:06:14.540> save<00:06:14.750> a<00:06:14.900> couple<00:06:15.080> more

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:15.380 
then the skip would save a couple more

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:18.100 
then the skip would save a couple more
seconds<00:06:15.860> if<00:06:16.130> I<00:06:16.580> did<00:06:16.760> this<00:06:16.910> speed<00:06:17.180> vault<00:06:17.390> on<00:06:17.780> in

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:18.110 
seconds if I did this speed vault on in

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:19.570 
seconds if I did this speed vault on in
the<00:06:18.260> building<00:06:18.650> that<00:06:18.830> would<00:06:18.920> be<00:06:19.040> a<00:06:19.070> couple<00:06:19.310> more

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:19.580 
the building that would be a couple more

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:23.920 
the building that would be a couple more
seconds<00:06:20.060> so<00:06:21.370> it's<00:06:22.370> pretty<00:06:22.610> variable<00:06:22.970> really

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:23.930 
seconds so it's pretty variable really

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:26.350 
seconds so it's pretty variable really
depending<00:06:24.290> on<00:06:24.350> how<00:06:24.500> you<00:06:24.560> play<00:06:24.860> this<00:06:25.010> level<00:06:25.370> but

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:26.360 
depending on how you play this level but

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.990 
depending on how you play this level but
right<00:06:26.600> in<00:06:26.840> this<00:06:27.050> instance<00:06:27.620> it<00:06:27.950> saved<00:06:28.520> almost

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:29.000 
right in this instance it saved almost

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.340 
right in this instance it saved almost
25<00:06:29.480> seconds<00:06:31.330> I'm<00:06:32.330> guessing<00:06:32.630> on<00:06:32.720> PC<00:06:33.080> you<00:06:33.170> could

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:33.350 
25 seconds I'm guessing on PC you could

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:37.840 
25 seconds I'm guessing on PC you could
save<00:06:33.560> up<00:06:34.000> to<00:06:35.000> close<00:06:35.540> to<00:06:35.570> 30<00:06:36.020> seconds<00:06:36.850> on

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:37.850 
save up to close to 30 seconds on

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:41.370 
save up to close to 30 seconds on
console<00:06:38.450> probably<00:06:38.990> closer<00:06:39.230> to<00:06:39.470> 40<00:06:39.830> seconds

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:41.380 
console probably closer to 40 seconds

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:44.620 
console probably closer to 40 seconds
and<00:06:42.380> but<00:06:42.920> that's<00:06:43.070> the<00:06:43.220> skip<00:06:43.490> it's<00:06:44.090> pretty<00:06:44.420> cool

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:44.630 
and but that's the skip it's pretty cool

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:45.880 
and but that's the skip it's pretty cool
thanks<00:06:44.990> to<00:06:45.080> all<00:06:45.170> the<00:06:45.230> people<00:06:45.470> who<00:06:45.620> helped<00:06:45.770> me

cool skip so I'll upload any more if I

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:02.320 
cool skip so I'll upload any more if I
find<00:07:00.140> them
