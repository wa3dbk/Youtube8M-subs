00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.120 
which we've already made too so the

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.520 
which we've already made too so the
steps<00:00:37.360> might<00:00:37.570> seem<00:00:37.809> a<00:00:37.840> little<00:00:37.899> familiar<00:00:38.380> that

side facing down and I'm just gonna go
ahead<00:00:58.120> and<00:00:58.210> fold<00:00:58.420> my<00:00:58.480> paper<00:00:58.539> in<00:00:58.930> half<00:00:59.140> both

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 
ahead and fold my paper in half both

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.470 
ahead and fold my paper in half both
horizontally<00:01:00.370> and<00:01:00.399> vertically<00:01:00.879> here<00:01:01.149> so<00:01:01.360> that

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:01.480 
horizontally and vertically here so that

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:11.010 
horizontally and vertically here so that
I<00:01:01.510> can<00:01:01.600> get<00:01:01.930> find<00:01:02.710> where<00:01:02.860> my<00:01:02.980> Center<00:01:03.340> is<00:01:10.020> once

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
I can get find where my Center is once

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.989 
I can get find where my Center is once
you've<00:01:11.170> got<00:01:11.350> that<00:01:11.499> marked<00:01:11.799> off<00:01:12.009> we're<00:01:12.880> going

00:01:12.989 --> 00:01:12.999 
you've got that marked off we're going

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:14.370 
you've got that marked off we're going
to<00:01:13.060> take<00:01:13.240> each<00:01:13.450> of<00:01:13.600> the<00:01:13.749> four<00:01:13.990> corners<00:01:14.200> and

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
to take each of the four corners and

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.980 
to take each of the four corners and
fold<00:01:14.709> into<00:01:15.009> the<00:01:15.369> center<00:01:15.759> this<00:01:16.299> is<00:01:16.359> called<00:01:16.840> a

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
fold into the center this is called a

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.589 
fold into the center this is called a
blintz<00:01:17.350> space<00:01:17.469> or<00:01:18.069> in<00:01:18.549> Japanese<00:01:19.179> we<00:01:19.329> call<00:01:19.479> it

00:01:19.589 --> 00:01:19.599 
blintz space or in Japanese we call it

00:01:19.599 --> 00:01:22.199 
blintz space or in Japanese we call it
as<00:01:19.749> abadan<00:01:20.439> base<00:01:20.670> so<00:01:21.670> we<00:01:21.729> go<00:01:21.849> ahead<00:01:21.909> and<00:01:22.060> fold

00:01:22.199 --> 00:01:22.209 
as abadan base so we go ahead and fold

00:01:22.209 --> 00:01:37.610 
as abadan base so we go ahead and fold
these<00:01:22.389> in<00:01:22.569> to<00:01:22.719> the<00:01:22.869> center<00:01:23.139> here

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:37.620 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.170 

once<00:01:38.620> you've<00:01:38.799> got<00:01:38.979> all<00:01:39.010> four<00:01:39.400> sides<00:01:39.670> fold<00:01:39.970> it

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
once you've got all four sides fold it

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.660 
once you've got all four sides fold it
into<00:01:40.330> the<00:01:40.479> center<00:01:40.810> turn<00:01:41.590> it<00:01:41.710> over<00:01:41.830> and<00:01:42.130> then

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
into the center turn it over and then

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.789 
into the center turn it over and then
just<00:01:42.790> repeat<00:01:43.119> these<00:01:43.330> steps<00:01:43.540> again<00:01:44.260> folding

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:44.799 
just repeat these steps again folding

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:47.310 
just repeat these steps again folding
into<00:01:45.310> the<00:01:45.460> center<00:01:45.820> using<00:01:46.450> the<00:01:46.600> creases<00:01:47.020> and

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
into the center using the creases and

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.070 
into the center using the creases and
it's<00:01:47.710> this<00:01:48.010> white<00:01:48.369> line<00:01:48.700> from<00:01:49.060> the<00:01:49.180> edges<00:01:49.540> as<00:01:50.020> a

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 
it's this white line from the edges as a

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.570 
it's this white line from the edges as a
guide<00:01:50.409> to<00:01:50.800> help<00:01:50.920> make<00:01:51.159> sure<00:01:51.340> you're<00:01:51.490> getting

guide to help make sure you're getting
things<00:01:52.020> it's<00:01:53.020> real<00:01:53.200> easy<00:01:53.229> to<00:01:53.500> get<00:01:53.710> stuff<00:01:54.009> to

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
things it's real easy to get stuff to

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:55.530 
things it's real easy to get stuff to
kind<00:01:54.340> of<00:01:54.400> bend<00:01:54.640> weird<00:01:54.880> here<00:01:55.090> on<00:01:55.180> the<00:01:55.300> sides

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
kind of bend weird here on the sides

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:56.969 
kind of bend weird here on the sides
it's<00:01:55.750> good<00:01:55.900> to<00:01:55.960> put<00:01:56.110> a<00:01:56.140> little<00:01:56.290> pressure<00:01:56.590> so

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
it's good to put a little pressure so

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:58.740 
it's good to put a little pressure so
that<00:01:57.009> you<00:01:57.220> can<00:01:57.369> smooth<00:01:57.820> it<00:01:58.030> out<00:01:58.090> as<00:01:58.360> you<00:01:58.540> fold

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
that you can smooth it out as you fold

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.080 
that you can smooth it out as you fold
up<00:01:58.899> that<00:01:59.170> way<00:02:00.009> everything<00:02:00.399> comes<00:02:00.640> over<00:02:00.909> at<00:02:01.030> a

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
up that way everything comes over at a

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.749 
up that way everything comes over at a
nice<00:02:01.619> smooth<00:02:02.619> angle<00:02:03.009> as<00:02:03.159> opposed<00:02:03.460> to<00:02:03.580> just

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:03.759 
nice smooth angle as opposed to just

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:11.100 
nice smooth angle as opposed to just
being<00:02:03.940> kind<00:02:04.780> of<00:02:04.899> choppy<00:02:05.200> and<00:02:05.470> weird<00:02:05.680> there<00:02:10.110> it

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
being kind of choppy and weird there it

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.560 
being kind of choppy and weird there it
is<00:02:11.230> easy<00:02:11.470> since<00:02:11.980> there's<00:02:12.880> a<00:02:12.970> lot<00:02:13.239> of<00:02:13.360> layers

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
is easy since there's a lot of layers

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:15.390 
is easy since there's a lot of layers
here<00:02:13.690> to<00:02:14.050> kind<00:02:14.260> of<00:02:14.320> get<00:02:14.440> this<00:02:14.590> a<00:02:14.650> little<00:02:14.920> funky

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
here to kind of get this a little funky

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.970 
here to kind of get this a little funky
if<00:02:15.519> you're<00:02:15.670> not<00:02:15.820> careful<00:02:16.500> so<00:02:17.500> get<00:02:17.680> all<00:02:17.800> those

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
if you're not careful so get all those

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.699 
if you're not careful so get all those
folded<00:02:18.519> over<00:02:18.610> then<00:02:19.540> I<00:02:19.840> want<00:02:20.110> to<00:02:20.200> turn<00:02:20.440> it<00:02:20.560> over

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
folded over then I want to turn it over

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:24.000 
folded over then I want to turn it over
and<00:02:20.980> do<00:02:21.940> those<00:02:22.180> steps<00:02:22.450> one<00:02:22.840> more<00:02:23.110> time<00:02:23.410> folding

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
and do those steps one more time folding

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.509 
and do those steps one more time folding
into<00:02:24.250> the<00:02:24.519> center<00:02:24.880> again<00:02:25.000> here<00:02:26.160> now<00:02:27.160> this<00:02:27.459> is

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
into the center again here now this is

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:28.949 
into the center again here now this is
getting<00:02:27.910> harder<00:02:28.360> because<00:02:28.450> there's<00:02:28.660> a<00:02:28.720> lot

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
getting harder because there's a lot

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:30.660 
getting harder because there's a lot
more<00:02:28.989> layers<00:02:29.350> of<00:02:29.470> paper<00:02:29.800> you<00:02:30.370> want<00:02:30.489> to<00:02:30.550> take

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
more layers of paper you want to take

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.310 
more layers of paper you want to take
your<00:02:30.790> time<00:02:31.030> make<00:02:31.480> sure<00:02:31.510> you<00:02:31.720> fold<00:02:31.900> in<00:02:32.110> good

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
your time make sure you fold in good

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.140 
your time make sure you fold in good
towards<00:02:33.220> the<00:02:33.340> center<00:02:33.610> and<00:02:33.730> you<00:02:33.790> get<00:02:33.940> a<00:02:33.970> good

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
towards the center and you get a good

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:45.830 
towards the center and you get a good
crease<00:02:35.640> just<00:02:36.640> work<00:02:36.790> our<00:02:36.940> way<00:02:37.030> around<00:02:37.209> here

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.630 

so<00:02:46.840> if<00:02:46.930> got<00:02:47.140> all<00:02:47.290> those<00:02:47.470> folded<00:02:47.860> over<00:02:47.950> turn<00:02:48.610> it

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
so if got all those folded over turn it

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.180 
so if got all those folded over turn it
over<00:02:48.940> and<00:02:49.330> we've<00:02:49.930> got<00:02:50.110> these<00:02:50.260> nice<00:02:50.560> little

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
over and we've got these nice little

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.850 
over and we've got these nice little
diamonds<00:02:51.849> areas<00:02:52.450> here<00:02:52.840> that<00:02:53.080> have<00:02:53.260> pockets

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
diamonds areas here that have pockets

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.000 
diamonds areas here that have pockets
that<00:02:54.160> open<00:02:54.580> through<00:02:55.510> the<00:02:55.660> center<00:02:56.050> area<00:02:56.260> and

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
that open through the center area and

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.800 
that open through the center area and
what<00:02:57.160> we<00:02:57.280> want<00:02:57.459> to<00:02:57.519> do<00:02:57.730> is<00:02:58.030> I'm<00:02:58.390> going<00:02:58.510> to<00:02:58.569> put<00:02:58.780> a

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
what we want to do is I'm going to put a

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.630 
what we want to do is I'm going to put a
little<00:02:59.050> pressure<00:02:59.379> right<00:02:59.530> on<00:02:59.680> the<00:02:59.830> tip<00:03:00.280> of<00:03:00.489> this

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
little pressure right on the tip of this

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.270 
little pressure right on the tip of this
diamond<00:03:00.910> not<00:03:01.360> pulling<00:03:01.720> it<00:03:01.810> up<00:03:01.959> and<00:03:02.170> you<00:03:03.069> see

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
diamond not pulling it up and you see

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.710 
diamond not pulling it up and you see
this<00:03:03.430> side<00:03:03.670> already<00:03:03.880> opened<00:03:04.269> which<00:03:04.390> is<00:03:04.540> nice

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
this side already opened which is nice

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.630 
this side already opened which is nice
sometimes<00:03:05.530> I<00:03:05.830> don't<00:03:05.890> always<00:03:06.130> do<00:03:06.430> that<00:03:06.580> you

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
sometimes I don't always do that you

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.130 
sometimes I don't always do that you
need<00:03:06.970> to<00:03:07.090> kind<00:03:07.209> of<00:03:07.330> help<00:03:07.510> it<00:03:07.660> along<00:03:07.750> because<00:03:07.989> we

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
need to kind of help it along because we

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.009 
need to kind of help it along because we
want<00:03:08.319> both<00:03:08.650> of<00:03:08.890> these<00:03:09.040> sides<00:03:09.400> to<00:03:09.670> pop<00:03:09.880> open<00:03:10.120> so

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
want both of these sides to pop open so

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:13.199 
want both of these sides to pop open so
that<00:03:11.170> when<00:03:11.319> we<00:03:11.440> push<00:03:11.799> up<00:03:11.830> we<00:03:12.700> can<00:03:12.880> bring<00:03:13.060> this

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
that when we push up we can bring this

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:16.050 
that when we push up we can bring this
tip<00:03:13.630> to<00:03:14.049> the<00:03:14.140> top<00:03:14.379> up<00:03:14.590> here<00:03:14.620> and<00:03:15.129> then<00:03:15.340> smooth

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
tip to the top up here and then smooth

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.380 
tip to the top up here and then smooth
everything<00:03:16.569> out<00:03:16.780> to<00:03:17.019> create<00:03:17.349> a<00:03:17.760> rectangle<00:03:18.760> so

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
everything out to create a rectangle so

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:20.850 
everything out to create a rectangle so
you'll<00:03:19.510> make<00:03:19.660> sure<00:03:19.690> all<00:03:19.959> your<00:03:20.170> sides<00:03:20.650> are

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
you'll make sure all your sides are

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.830 
you'll make sure all your sides are
smoothed<00:03:21.220> out<00:03:21.400> nice<00:03:21.670> so<00:03:22.360> you<00:03:22.480> can<00:03:22.630> get<00:03:22.720> that

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
smoothed out nice so you can get that

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.490 
smoothed out nice so you can get that
all<00:03:23.019> extended<00:03:23.829> to<00:03:24.160> create<00:03:24.519> a<00:03:24.730> rectangle<00:03:25.660> now

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
all extended to create a rectangle now

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.110 
all extended to create a rectangle now
I'm<00:03:26.560> going<00:03:26.680> to<00:03:26.739> repeat<00:03:26.980> that<00:03:27.190> step<00:03:27.519> on<00:03:27.760> two

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
I'm going to repeat that step on two

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.699 
I'm going to repeat that step on two
more<00:03:28.299> sides<00:03:28.630> we<00:03:28.840> want<00:03:29.019> to<00:03:29.079> leave<00:03:29.200> one<00:03:29.440> of<00:03:29.470> these

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
more sides we want to leave one of these

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.740 
more sides we want to leave one of these
down<00:03:30.010> because<00:03:30.220> that's<00:03:30.489> his<00:03:30.670> head<00:03:30.910> so<00:03:31.599> you<00:03:31.690> can

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
down because that's his head so you can

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.160 
down because that's his head so you can
kind<00:03:31.989> of<00:03:32.049> go<00:03:32.170> around<00:03:32.260> and<00:03:33.840> get<00:03:34.840> these<00:03:34.989> little

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
kind of go around and get these little

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.130 
kind of go around and get these little
guys<00:03:35.349> popped<00:03:35.739> open<00:03:35.920> here<00:03:36.400> and<00:03:37.000> smoosh<00:03:37.989> them

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
guys popped open here and smoosh them

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:39.839 
guys popped open here and smoosh them
out<00:03:38.290> so<00:03:38.530> we<00:03:38.590> can<00:03:38.739> get<00:03:38.829> these<00:03:39.040> other<00:03:39.250> three

00:03:39.839 --> 00:03:39.849 
out so we can get these other three

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:49.979 
out so we can get these other three
rectangles<00:03:47.910> and<00:03:48.910> that<00:03:49.329> kind<00:03:49.510> of<00:03:49.540> gives<00:03:49.780> you

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
rectangles and that kind of gives you

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:52.920 
rectangles and that kind of gives you
your<00:03:50.530> finished<00:03:51.040> little<00:03:51.310> the<00:03:52.030> up<00:03:52.120> goes<00:03:52.329> on<00:03:52.480> so

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
your finished little the up goes on so

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.360 
your finished little the up goes on so
you<00:03:53.019> can<00:03:53.139> kind<00:03:53.319> of<00:03:53.350> see<00:03:53.500> here<00:03:53.709> that's<00:03:53.950> his<00:03:54.100> face

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
you can kind of see here that's his face

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.099 
you can kind of see here that's his face
and<00:03:54.760> you<00:03:55.090> could<00:03:55.209> paint<00:03:55.540> face<00:03:55.720> there<00:03:55.959> if<00:03:56.019> you

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:56.109 
and you could paint face there if you

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:59.129 
and you could paint face there if you
wanted<00:03:56.380> to<00:03:56.560> and<00:03:56.910> the<00:03:57.910> square<00:03:58.359> kind<00:03:58.660> of<00:03:58.750> arms

00:03:59.129 --> 00:03:59.139 
wanted to and the square kind of arms

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:00.809 
wanted to and the square kind of arms
make<00:03:59.680> it<00:03:59.799> look<00:03:59.950> like<00:04:00.100> he's<00:04:00.310> wearing<00:04:00.519> like<00:04:00.790> a

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:00.819 
make it look like he's wearing like a

by<00:04:24.610> seven<00:04:24.910> and<00:04:25.000> a<00:04:25.030> half<00:04:25.060> of<00:04:25.389> course<00:04:25.630> squared

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020

so<00:04:36.810> just<00:04:37.290> shy<00:04:37.710> of<00:04:37.770> being<00:04:38.070> about<00:04:38.280> half<00:04:38.580> the<00:04:38.820> size

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 
probably because of the folds and such

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.370 
probably because of the folds and such
within<00:04:41.550> everything<00:04:41.910> but<00:04:42.300> that<00:04:42.540> should<00:04:43.199> give

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
within everything but that should give

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.270 
within everything but that should give
