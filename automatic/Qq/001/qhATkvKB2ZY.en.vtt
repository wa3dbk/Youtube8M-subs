00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
said dissident this doesn't represent

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.380 
said dissident this doesn't represent
the<00:01:19.830> Iraqi<00:01:20.100> people<00:01:20.400> but<00:01:20.759> that's<00:01:20.970> that's<00:01:21.210> what

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
the Iraqi people but that's that's what

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.050 
the Iraqi people but that's that's what
happens<00:01:21.750> in<00:01:22.040> free<00:01:23.040> societies<00:01:23.640> where<00:01:23.790> people

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
happens in free societies where people

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.140 
happens in free societies where people
try<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.270> draw<00:01:24.540> attention<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:25.049> themselves<00:01:25.320> and

try to draw attention to themselves and

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.420 
try to draw attention to themselves and
so<00:01:27.150> I<00:01:27.450> guess<00:01:28.320> he<00:01:28.470> was<00:01:28.619> effective<00:01:29.130> because<00:01:29.220> it

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
so I guess he was effective because it

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.069 
so I guess he was effective because it
caused<00:01:29.610> you<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:29.939> say<00:01:30.090> something<00:01:30.360> about<00:01:30.600> it<00:01:30.900> now
