00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.930
 now i am the yaga combed 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:14.050
 she's called we're just pilot and 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:16.630
 team co-pilot to dakar on 

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:17.980
 theme of the SUV is like our 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.230
 hobby but it's also our 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:23.050
 I work then to anyone who 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:26.500
 like the mountain races and the 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:28.210
 shoulder because his dream is to go to the dakar and 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.310
 we have had the possibility of 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.490
 of getting into their team back 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.220
 up 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:37.730
 and let's go for it inside this 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:40.580
 project we can say that we searched 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:43.010
 first they looked at us from people that we are 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:45.290
 related to the off-road help 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.670
 and I myself really like the subject to me 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.280
 I really like the off-road theme 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:52.370
 in cars 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.260
 which the orientation still likes more 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.809
 I like it 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.719
 reductive realization find myself in the middle 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:02.000
 out of nowhere and get out to where 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:05.690
 he has to go and he also pressures me 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.060
 made that we have a vehicle made 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.280
 in the country in fact by people here in 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.090
 which we trust and stay us 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.090
 we 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.409
 and I met now at 10 years old 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.220
 working in the world of the SUV 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:23.009
 we could say that we have traveled 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.390
 half spain or more on roads doing 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.240
 of pilot or co-pilot in a way 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.530
 indifferent we have worked well together 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.030
 in times of tension we have 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.679
 separated well and we think that for this 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.170
 project where the tension is going to be high 

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:38.229
 Well, we could not do it well too 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:40.270
 when we proposed the idea of ​​doing the 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:41.950
 team of them to the dakar with the only 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.009
 person who was really comfortable that 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.259
 I wanted to go is with gemma because it's a 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:49.570
 Perfect girl for the off-road world 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:51.280
 we know each other from many years ago and 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.259
 we have spent a thousand and one adventures in the 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.899
 middle of the mountain and we have always 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:58.180
 we have got along well and there is a good 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:00.490
 environment then I think we're going to move 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:04.950
 also a lot of tension in the dakar and it 's 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.950
 important that within the team there 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:11.680
 here you have the buggy with which we are going to 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:13.720
 go to the dakar is his name is omni 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.069
 barcelona is built by a 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.530
 company also from barcelona- porcel 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:18.770
 oscar 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.819
 and hey it's a very light engine are 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.860
 1500 with about 110 horses 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:25.760
 approximately and hopefully it's the 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.760
 that reaches us to the goal 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:35.140
 about them to the dakar and me 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:41.890
 are reining drivers are 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.330
 dedicate professionally to the 4x4 and how 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.010
 to qualsevol person who likes that 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:48.640
 the mount as the show are and snacks or 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:52.460
 real take out and we refused to meet 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:58.940
 in the team of them to dakar 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:03:01.250
 we are with structures things 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:04.160
 related to the world all terrain is 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:06.550
 I love that and especially I think 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.870
 that is a passion that last orientation 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:11.120
 and say that here is the one who wanted that 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.690
 reject copilot try to guide the 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:19.240
 area but I say that to me the only one going 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:19.240
 have a great idea of why 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:32.090
 two centers since it 's a sierra mica 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:33.860
 but they have another one of them connections 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.680
 the ones working in the world of 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:38.630
 off-road I could understand one the turn 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.630
 Spain copilot of roads and 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:43.430
 co-pilot indifferently works 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.800
 always have time issue 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.390
 tension and go creators that aquest 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.770
 projecte will debut saturated our 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.870
 experience could also carry 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:53.049
 return 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:55.330
 with the ban he proposed the idea of ​​riding x 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:58.030
 of them to dakar I think the best 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:00.370
 person that could was in the yolk because 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.440
 they know us from family we face 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:05.230
 pilot and co-pilot a lot of vegades not 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:08.079
 in races but yes between dancing and 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:10.090
 males I think it 's temper but if 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:11.740
 they have problems or we have high tension 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.080
 what will happen 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:15.700
 the good atmosphere had between the two 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.590
 I think it's very important in a 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.959
 career and yes 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.750
 here we have our vehicle is the 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:24.880
 buggy according to our mini barcelona is 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.919
 built the oscar that also a 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.300
 company here from the franquises and 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:30.940
 well I have a motor is pretty 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:33.430
 simple 2000 56 cubic centimeters and 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:37.110
 dance into debt and expect it follows that 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.110
 will export to the goal 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:52.930
 two 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.930
 do not 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:03.350
 are you support know 

00:05:04.369 --> 00:05:07.639
