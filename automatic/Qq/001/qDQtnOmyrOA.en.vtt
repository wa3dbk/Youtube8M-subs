like<00:01:32.909> only<00:01:33.509> use<00:01:33.659> me<00:01:33.810> blade<00:01:34.850> but<00:01:35.850> my<00:01:36.000> kills<00:01:36.299> a

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
like only use me blade but my kills a

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.190 
like only use me blade but my kills a
1.5<00:01:37.860> for<00:01:38.159> ratio<00:01:38.700> at<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.600> end<00:01:39.720> I<00:01:39.900> think<00:01:39.930> I

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
1.5 for ratio at the end I think I

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.770 
1.5 for ratio at the end I think I
managed<00:01:40.710> to<00:01:41.040> get<00:01:41.340> it<00:01:41.520> up<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:41.850> everything<00:01:42.329> if

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
managed to get it up and everything if

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.109 
managed to get it up and everything if
it<00:01:43.409> wasn't<00:01:43.740> like<00:01:43.860> if<00:01:44.159> I<00:01:44.369> didn't<00:01:44.729> have<00:01:44.790> so<00:01:45.090> many

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
it wasn't like if I didn't have so many

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.690 
it wasn't like if I didn't have so many
kills<00:01:45.450> and<00:01:45.689> I<00:01:45.780> would<00:01:45.960> like<00:01:46.520> bring<00:01:47.520> my

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
kills and I would like bring my

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.370 
kills and I would like bring my
experience<00:01:47.909> that<00:01:48.329> I<00:01:48.360> had<00:01:48.509> at<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.960> end<00:01:48.990> at<00:01:49.290> the

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
experience that I had at the end at the

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.899 
experience that I had at the end at the
beginning<00:01:49.770> I<00:01:49.920> would<00:01:50.070> have<00:01:50.159> had<00:01:50.310> i<00:01:50.520> believe<00:01:50.820> a

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
beginning I would have had i believe a

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.039 
beginning I would have had i believe a
higher<00:01:51.060> katie<00:01:51.329> maybe<00:01:51.570> like<00:01:51.780> 1.7<00:01:52.880> with<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:54.049> best

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
higher katie maybe like 1.7 with a best

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.850 
higher katie maybe like 1.7 with a best
kill<00:01:55.680> streak<00:01:55.710> of<00:01:56.070> 15<00:01:56.810> pretty<00:01:57.810> far<00:01:58.110> from<00:01:58.290> a<00:01:58.469> MOAB

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
kill streak of 15 pretty far from a MOAB

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.700 
kill streak of 15 pretty far from a MOAB
and<00:01:59.640> my<00:01:59.909> win-loss<00:02:00.299> ratio<00:02:00.750> is<00:02:00.930> 5<00:02:01.229> point<00:02:01.500> 10

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
and my win-loss ratio is 5 point 10

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.709

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
2429 which is actually like the highest

of<00:02:21.450> my<00:02:21.630> whole<00:02:21.900> friends<00:02:22.410> list<00:02:22.620> i<00:02:22.770> believe<00:02:23.360> yep

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
of my whole friends list i believe yep

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.390 
of my whole friends list i believe yep
is<00:02:24.930> that<00:02:25.170> I<00:02:25.320> stuffed<00:02:25.560> my<00:02:25.680> whole<00:02:25.830> friendless

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
is that I stuffed my whole friendless

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.800 
is that I stuffed my whole friendless
it's<00:02:26.700> probably<00:02:27.000> because<00:02:27.120> I<00:02:27.240> was<00:02:27.480> rushing

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
it's probably because I was rushing

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.870 
it's probably because I was rushing
captain<00:02:28.230> flies<00:02:28.530> and<00:02:28.770> everything<00:02:29.160> that's

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
captain flies and everything that's

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.380 
captain flies and everything that's
maybe<00:02:30.090> why<00:02:30.270> I<00:02:30.300> got<00:02:30.660> a<00:02:30.900> whole<00:02:31.860> 80<00:02:32.190> level<00:02:32.610> in<00:02:32.880> 15

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
maybe why I got a whole 80 level in 15

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.940 
maybe why I got a whole 80 level in 15
