00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:09.639
 ninth album by britney 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.659
 I can not be more excited let's go there 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:12.360
 sweetheart that I contract with the 

00:00:10.659 --> 00:00:14.440
 information because there is a lot 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.840
 let's go back in time early 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:19.330
 from the summer of 2014 oysters a news in 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.830
 the one that was advertised out as a 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.900
 new britney song that would launch 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.790
 forming part of the soundtrack of the 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.530
 movie search party a sheet music 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:29.410
 a humor that would be treated in September 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:31.090
 of last year 2014 finally not even that 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.219
 soundtrack or the movie have been 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:36.190
 premiered and has been postponed without a date 

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:38.530
 defined premiere so all this 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.059
 could continue standing and uruguay would be a 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.920
 of the songs that would be part of the 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:43.120
 new job the wind speed and that 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.429
 would also be part of the band 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.289
 sound of the movie search party that 

00:00:45.429 --> 00:00:48.670
 yes it is true all this we hope that 

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:50.499
 announce very soon to the movie to 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.239
 have that song as soon as possible 

00:00:50.499 --> 00:00:55.530
 britney we are in need in vein 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:55.530
 because it is because we can not 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.050
 let's give some credibility to 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.000
 gray that I saw that is a page that 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.890
 formerly it was exclusive to provide 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.170
 this information from espn espnews and now 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:09.170
 it's information about all the artists 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.940
 pop has sold a little bit the page them 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.290
 we have caught a little mania but good 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.880
 let's put it aside and let's give 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.610
 a little reliability according to the page 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.680
 ruiz javi already brought us this rumor of 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.020
 film craft and gas area that finally is 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.670
 true but they looked for 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.619
 January or December with the light that 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.900
 denounced and finally you see our 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:30.140
 education things really that to collation is 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.789
 real and it 's done well he said 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.530
 that would have recently needed three 

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:35.180
 new songs apart from that other web 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.100
 that he has registered for a long time 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.020
 processed to three new songs one 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.570
 it would be a cover of a song from us in 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.670
 the one that was released relatively does very 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.880
 little three or four years it's called 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.770
 faders there is a song a pop tempo 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.119
 electronic that I loved and that the 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.729
 true that he has sued me with the voice of 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:53.600
 bing my head and it's apotheosis is 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:55.490
 apotheosis 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.930
 please that this song is included 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.270
 on the new album 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.920
 already happened after having a cover of a 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.500
 singer who had already released that was 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.600
 for a singer for more masses 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.729
 small so to speak that was the 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.830
 song out from under out from under 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.650
 included in the album the circus the ring 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.360
 and a song that had already been recorded 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.730
 own singer and had been released 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.050
 well this would be the same case to see 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.760
 six hours of work so that the 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.890
 listen and flipe a little bit because it's 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.270
 a spectacular but very well with the 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.330
 that in blas posse imagine already by 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.400
 principle is that or eyes the death or a 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.650
 song like this was titled forgiven and 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.780
 this one is unpublished is composed in 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.700
 försterling taken who has worked in 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.290
 songs like when the guangzhou like 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.540
 not seeing from prison to releases those beginnings 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.090
 of corner has worked with celine dion 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:45.030
 half cyrus and ashley tisdale selena 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.739
 gómez demi lovato instead of jazz and 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.810
 yale and has recently worked his 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:51.600
 most recent works have been with 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.010
 stern and with each stay in the song 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.830
 live line that I think is one of the 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.510
 best of resurrection anastasia well 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.510
 that the truth seems that it is going to be 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.970
 pretty good song if we stick 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.620
 what he has done well 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.970
 more that has cracked me with print and 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.370
 I forgot a song has worked 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.410
 precisely at the front of which I hope 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.570
 that I have spoken to you before so 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.730
 we can probably expect some 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:17.790
 pop ballad of electronic store a pop 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:20.250
 European hopefully it's like that the title I like 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.420
 in the composition of seeley pay who 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.760
 well, I like it for what it has 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.460
 done for what the artists that 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:29.190
 they work another and the last song of 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:31.740
 gesta de britney is jazz let me go that 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:34.200
 probably that demo that if we 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:35.910
 example a few years ago that made a 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.910
 sample of the song from the side of 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.560
 madonna the beautiful island the pimps god 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.790
 it was called again that down if not 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.250
 you have heard the truth that I 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:47.100
 loved his time is focused more is 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:49.410
 also the 2003 album and in the sound 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:51.090
 but now I think they should update 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.290
 the production and if it were like that then I 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.030
 I would love that it is usually the new album 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.070
 because I liked it a lot in tribute 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.850
 I think Madonna's daughter does it 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:58.890
 very good 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:00.209
 it's ricky music that I think the king and not 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.650
 It does not get very fashionable among 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:02.670
 pop artists and I would love it to be 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.800
 put on because I love music 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:07.260
 reggae and if extracted from the hand of 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.670
 Britney, well, much better, hear the truth 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.040
 would love to want a new album 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.480
 I called and in turn more 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.299
 information that we know the number 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:17.220
 rhythm work because according to their own 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:20.310
 words is that it is a disk that is going to be 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:22.350
 pop rock and that is going very slow but 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.000
 is progressing the thing is the only thing 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.160
 we know from the mouth of the mouth ring 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.539
 by william orbit we know that it will be 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.030
 producing some of the themes of 

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:31.590
 mouth of the line mouth we know that 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.449
 is trying with all its 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.160
 forces be part of the new album 

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:37.560
 but I think that britney is not going to 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.930
 to leave and above all because it is there is my 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.340
 intuition that max martin always been 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.139
 involved in all the work of 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.729
 rhythm and I think it's not going to be 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:48.360
 less max martin sure that will make us 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:49.949
 some new hit with britney and apart from 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.860
 all this and zero tells us with that 

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:54.630
 britney last night we announced that before the 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.820
 about the measures I was going to do and it's going to 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:59.190
 take a south photos to promote something 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.389
 surely for some magazine to 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:03.150
 be the cover of any magazine and 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:04.229
 promote something that will be that something your 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.660
 wedding the line of lingerie that 

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:08.280
 has recently released new photos of 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:11.220
 the spring-summer campaign 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:14.130
 new single with her comes out to could be 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:16.410
 or also feel the vegas we would put 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:18.540
 promote one of those things or the three 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:20.700
 At the same time I hope you give us more information 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:22.200
 this interview is going to do to 

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.820
 some magazine in return from your side 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:26.100
 to be able to be interests 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:28.470

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:31.500
 the stiffness spring / summer campaign 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:32.760
 of intimate connection you write the truth in 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:35.160
 the fruits that have the short ones 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.600
 the gorgeous have reached but there 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:39.000
 another two was one that tastes like a 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:41.010
 Pool is that it seems that Carmen Lomaña 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.810
 stuck on the disney or cold road more 

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:45.210
 for the event that is not even the body of 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:47.460
 vittorio the center looks super fake the 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:49.350
 criticism we will also see how they are 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.970
 coloma and then there's the other 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:53.220
 developed knows it with red notaries 

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:54.750
 without giving too bulky pussy like me 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:56.520

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:07.040
