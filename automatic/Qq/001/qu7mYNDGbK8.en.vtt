00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
thread and there is a little thread

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.289 
thread and there is a little thread
cutter<00:01:07.189> up<00:01:07.310> here<00:01:07.520> for<00:01:07.700> the<00:01:07.789> bobbin<00:01:07.969> so<00:01:08.240> I'm

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:08.299 
cutter up here for the bobbin so I'm

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:10.179

00:01:15.099 --> 00:01:15.109 
way you're not dragging any extra thread

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:17.200 
way you're not dragging any extra thread
or<00:01:15.409> lint<00:01:15.740> back<00:01:16.100> up<00:01:16.310> through<00:01:16.490> your<00:01:16.609> machine<00:01:16.729> as

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
or lint back up through your machine as

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.300 
or lint back up through your machine as
you're<00:01:17.630> using<00:01:17.869> them<00:01:18.229> so<00:01:18.829> we're<00:01:18.979> gonna<00:01:19.070> take

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
you're using them so we're gonna take

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.349 
you're using them so we're gonna take
our<00:01:20.679> red<00:01:21.679> and<00:01:22.369> put<00:01:22.490> a<00:01:22.549> spool<00:01:22.880> cap<00:01:23.119> right<00:01:23.299> here

our red and put a spool cap right here

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:26.889 
our red and put a spool cap right here
at<00:01:23.689> the<00:01:23.810> base<00:01:24.049> and<00:01:24.979> then<00:01:25.399> this<00:01:25.880> one<00:01:26.149> is<00:01:26.479> got<00:01:26.719> a

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:26.899 
at the base and then this one is got a

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:30.489 
at the base and then this one is got a
matching<00:01:27.340> wool<00:01:28.340> cap<00:01:28.640> size<00:01:29.030> and<00:01:29.570> we'll<00:01:30.259> start

00:01:30.489 --> 00:01:30.499 
matching wool cap size and we'll start

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:33.489 
matching wool cap size and we'll start
off<00:01:30.619> by<00:01:30.770> doing<00:01:30.829> a<00:01:31.219> bobbin<00:01:31.640> with<00:01:32.390> just<00:01:32.960> from<00:01:33.350> the

00:01:33.489 --> 00:01:33.499 
off by doing a bobbin with just from the

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:35.620 
off by doing a bobbin with just from the
spool<00:01:33.799> meaning<00:01:34.189> we're<00:01:34.549> gonna<00:01:34.640> come<00:01:34.909> over<00:01:35.090> the

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
spool meaning we're gonna come over the

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.989 
spool meaning we're gonna come over the

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
enough this little brake but I did leave

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.910 
enough this little brake but I did leave
a<00:02:42.390> little<00:02:42.659> tail<00:02:42.989> here<00:02:43.349> so<00:02:43.500> I'm<00:02:43.590> going<00:02:43.709> to<00:02:43.769> take

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
a little tail here so I'm going to take

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.160 
a little tail here so I'm going to take
my<00:02:44.069> scissors<00:02:44.340> and<00:02:44.640> make<00:02:45.090> sure<00:02:45.239> nothing<00:02:45.989> is

sticking<00:02:46.349> up<00:02:46.620> when<00:02:47.220> we<00:02:47.700> go<00:02:47.879> to<00:02:47.940> use<00:02:48.239> it<00:02:48.420> later

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
sticking up when we go to use it later

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:51.380 
sticking up when we go to use it later
so<00:02:48.959> we'll<00:02:49.049> go<00:02:49.260> ahead<00:02:49.290> and<00:02:49.560> wind<00:02:49.739> this<00:02:49.890> up<00:02:50.390> I'll

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
so we'll go ahead and wind this up I'll

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.420 
so we'll go ahead and wind this up I'll
show<00:02:51.450> you<00:02:51.810> another<00:02:52.319> way<00:02:52.560> that<00:02:52.769> you<00:02:52.920> can<00:02:53.160> wind

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
show you another way that you can wind

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.910 
show you another way that you can wind

00:03:06.649 --> 00:03:06.659 
the bobbin too so there's multiple ways

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:08.569 
the bobbin too so there's multiple ways
to<00:03:07.470> wind<00:03:07.739> the<00:03:07.859> bobbin<00:03:08.010> you<00:03:08.220> don't<00:03:08.340> even<00:03:08.459> have

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:08.579 
to wind the bobbin you don't even have

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:10.399 
to wind the bobbin you don't even have
to<00:03:08.640> end<00:03:08.790> thread<00:03:08.970> the<00:03:09.060> machine<00:03:09.359> to<00:03:09.540> do<00:03:09.659> it<00:03:09.810> once

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:10.409 
to end thread the machine to do it once

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:11.270 
to end thread the machine to do it once
it<00:03:10.560> stops<00:03:10.829> spinning

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
it stops spinning

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.190 
it stops spinning
take<00:03:11.819> your<00:03:11.970> foot<00:03:12.150> off<00:03:12.269> the<00:03:12.299> foot<00:03:12.599> control<00:03:13.019> and

take your foot off the foot control and

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.789 
take your foot off the foot control and
we<00:03:14.040> can<00:03:14.250> slide<00:03:14.670> the<00:03:14.700> bobbin<00:03:15.060> back<00:03:15.450> lift<00:03:16.230> up<00:03:16.500> and

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
we can slide the bobbin back lift up and

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:19.550 
we can slide the bobbin back lift up and
use<00:03:17.700> the<00:03:17.940> cutter<00:03:18.209> now<00:03:18.900> the<00:03:19.260> way<00:03:19.380> you're

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560
