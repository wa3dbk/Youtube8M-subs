on the floor as you can see what the

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.149 
on the floor as you can see what the
keep<00:01:00.839> everything<00:01:01.109> really<00:01:01.319> neat<00:01:01.589> in<00:01:01.679> tight<00:01:01.889> I

keep everything really neat in tight I

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:04.939 
keep everything really neat in tight I
don't<00:01:02.670> think<00:01:02.760> these<00:01:03.179> need<00:01:03.479> a<00:01:03.510> lot<00:01:03.780> of<00:01:03.949> cooling

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
don't think these need a lot of cooling

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.429 
don't think these need a lot of cooling
but<00:01:05.550> I<00:01:05.580> could<00:01:05.850> be<00:01:05.880> wrong<00:01:06.000> about<00:01:06.390> that<00:01:06.540> so<00:01:07.229> let's

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
but I could be wrong about that so let's

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.399 
but I could be wrong about that so let's
see<00:01:07.680> I<00:01:07.920> guess<00:01:08.250> it's<00:01:08.579> got<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:08.729> standard<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.509> say

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
see I guess it's got a standard and say

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.560 
see I guess it's got a standard and say
to<00:01:10.469> plug<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.159> stuff<00:01:11.369> on<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.640> back<00:01:14.329> if<00:01:15.329> you're

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
to plug and stuff on the back if you're

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.359 
to plug and stuff on the back if you're
wondering<00:01:16.049> where<00:01:16.350> these<00:01:16.439> orange<00:01:16.920> cables<00:01:17.280> are

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
wondering where these orange cables are

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.279

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
two now we're set to boot off of the

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:40.260 
two now we're set to boot off of the
solid-state<00:04:03.829> drive<00:04:04.159> that<00:04:04.430> I<00:04:04.519> just<00:04:04.760> purchased

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:05:31.850 

that<00:04:41.270> printer<00:04:41.660> again

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.330 

so<00:05:32.520> it<00:05:32.879> seemed<00:05:33.120> like<00:05:33.240> that<00:05:33.360> was<00:05:33.419> much<00:05:33.689> quicker

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:34.340 
so it seemed like that was much quicker

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:38.689 
so it seemed like that was much quicker
so<00:05:35.340> when<00:05:35.610> all<00:05:35.729> was<00:05:35.909> said<00:05:35.969> and<00:05:36.210> done<00:05:36.360> the<00:05:37.699> 10,000

00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:38.699 
so when all was said and done the 10,000

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:41.719 
so when all was said and done the 10,000
RPM<00:05:39.120> raptor<00:05:39.750> you<00:05:40.710> know<00:05:40.800> traditional<00:05:41.280> western

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:41.729 
RPM raptor you know traditional western

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:44.749 
RPM raptor you know traditional western
digital<00:05:42.030> platter<00:05:42.270> drive<00:05:42.740> was<00:05:43.740> about<00:05:44.129> one

00:05:44.749 --> 00:05:44.759 
digital platter drive was about one

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:48.080 
digital platter drive was about one
minute<00:05:44.969> and<00:05:45.120> 40<00:05:45.389> seconds<00:05:45.780> and<00:05:46.189> the<00:05:47.189> solid

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:48.090 
minute and 40 seconds and the solid

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:50.390 
minute and 40 seconds and the solid
state<00:05:48.270> drive<00:05:48.659> was<00:05:49.560> one<00:05:49.830> minute<00:05:50.069> and<00:05:50.129> 22

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:50.400 
state drive was one minute and 22

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.659 
state drive was one minute and 22
seconds<00:05:51.560> so<00:05:52.560> that<00:05:52.770> doesn't<00:05:53.039> seem<00:05:53.250> like<00:05:53.490> that

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:53.669 
seconds so that doesn't seem like that

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:55.279 
seconds so that doesn't seem like that
much<00:05:53.699> it's<00:05:54.090> about<00:05:54.300> 18<00:05:54.629> seconds<00:05:55.020> but<00:05:55.169> it

00:05:55.279 --> 00:05:55.289 
much it's about 18 seconds but it

00:05:55.289 --> 00:05:58.580 
much it's about 18 seconds but it
actually<00:05:55.439> is<00:05:55.889> a<00:05:56.729> heck<00:05:57.360> of<00:05:57.389> a<00:05:57.569> lot<00:05:57.599> because

00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:58.590 
actually is a heck of a lot because

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:00.409 
actually is a heck of a lot because
there<00:05:59.490> are<00:05:59.580> a<00:05:59.610> lot<00:05:59.729> of<00:05:59.759> things<00:05:59.969> that<00:06:00.150> occur

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:00.419 
there are a lot of things that occur

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:03.499 
there are a lot of things that occur
when<00:06:00.659> my<00:06:00.990> computer<00:06:01.169> boots<00:06:01.680> up<00:06:01.889> that<00:06:02.509> would

00:06:03.499 --> 00:06:03.509 
when my computer boots up that would

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:05.119 
when my computer boots up that would
take<00:06:03.689> the<00:06:03.840> same<00:06:04.020> amount<00:06:04.050> of<00:06:04.229> time<00:06:04.289> even<00:06:05.039> if

00:06:05.119 --> 00:06:05.129 
take the same amount of time even if

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:06.140 
take the same amount of time even if
your<00:06:05.219> hard<00:06:05.430> drive<00:06:05.610> was<00:06:05.789> basically

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:06.150 
your hard drive was basically

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:08.899 
your hard drive was basically
instantaneous<00:06:06.870> I<00:06:07.279> think<00:06:08.279> it<00:06:08.430> was<00:06:08.550> about<00:06:08.669> the

00:06:08.899 --> 00:06:08.909 
instantaneous I think it was about the

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:10.939 
instantaneous I think it was about the
same<00:06:09.090> anyway<00:06:09.539> it<00:06:09.659> shaved<00:06:09.900> about<00:06:10.139> 18<00:06:10.560> seconds

00:06:10.939 --> 00:06:10.949 
same anyway it shaved about 18 seconds

00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:15.050 
same anyway it shaved about 18 seconds
off<00:06:11.129> the<00:06:11.159> boot<00:06:11.460> time<00:06:12.620> all<00:06:13.620> in<00:06:13.919> all<00:06:14.069> I<00:06:14.460> think<00:06:14.580> I'd

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:15.060 
off the boot time all in all I think I'd

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:17.119 
off the boot time all in all I think I'd
be<00:06:15.300> fairly<00:06:15.900> satisfied<00:06:16.469> i'm<00:06:16.680> going<00:06:16.830> to<00:06:16.889> start

00:06:17.119 --> 00:06:17.129 
be fairly satisfied i'm going to start

00:06:17.129 --> 00:06:19.459 
be fairly satisfied i'm going to start
playing<00:06:17.400> a<00:06:17.750> starcraft<00:06:18.750> 2<00:06:18.930> and<00:06:19.139> see<00:06:19.289> it<00:06:19.379> the

00:06:19.459 --> 00:06:19.469 
playing a starcraft 2 and see it the

00:06:19.469 --> 00:06:22.309 
playing a starcraft 2 and see it the
load<00:06:19.620> times<00:06:19.889> any<00:06:20.099> better<00:06:20.279> and<00:06:21.199> you<00:06:22.199> know

00:06:22.309 --> 00:06:22.319 
load times any better and you know

00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:23.959 
load times any better and you know
various<00:06:22.560> things<00:06:22.830> like<00:06:23.009> that<00:06:23.189> but<00:06:23.430> i<00:06:23.490> believe

00:06:23.959 --> 00:06:23.969 
various things like that but i believe

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:28.990 
various things like that but i believe
that<00:06:24.360> this<00:06:24.479> is<00:06:24.659> pretty<00:06:24.900> approachable

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:29.000 

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.350 

so<00:06:29.840> still<00:06:30.410> waiting<00:06:30.830> on<00:06:30.980> this<00:06:31.220> the<00:06:32.000> cloning

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:32.360 
so still waiting on this the cloning

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.990 
so still waiting on this the cloning
process<00:06:32.390> to<00:06:32.960> complete<00:06:33.140> so<00:06:33.710> I<00:06:33.920> was<00:06:34.670> just<00:06:34.850> uh

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:35.000 
process to complete so I was just uh

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.120 
process to complete so I was just uh
just<00:06:35.600> marveling<00:06:36.380> at<00:06:36.470> this<00:06:36.590> wonderful<00:06:36.800> piece

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:37.130 
just marveling at this wonderful piece

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:41.080 
just marveling at this wonderful piece
of<00:06:37.280> technology<00:06:38.680> it<00:06:39.680> so<00:06:39.890> happens<00:06:40.310> that<00:06:40.370> you

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:41.090 
of technology it so happens that you

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:42.550 
of technology it so happens that you
know<00:06:41.210> if<00:06:41.390> the<00:06:41.540> solid-state<00:06:42.050> drive<00:06:42.320> doesn't

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:42.560 
know if the solid-state drive doesn't

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:45.550 
know if the solid-state drive doesn't
offer<00:06:42.920> any<00:06:43.400> speed<00:06:44.360> boost<00:06:44.660> to<00:06:44.840> my<00:06:44.960> computer<00:06:45.260> I

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:45.560 
offer any speed boost to my computer I

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:47.440 
offer any speed boost to my computer I
can<00:06:45.890> always<00:06:46.310> just<00:06:46.430> you<00:06:46.520> know<00:06:46.640> take<00:06:47.300> this

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:47.450 
can always just you know take this

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:48.940 
can always just you know take this
sticker<00:06:47.750> that<00:06:47.960> came<00:06:48.140> with<00:06:48.350> it<00:06:48.380> and<00:06:48.650> just

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:48.950

sticker that came with it and just
adhere<00:06:49.460> it<00:06:49.490> right<00:06:49.760> to<00:06:49.880> the<00:06:49.940> front<00:06:50.180> of<00:06:50.330> mac<00:06:50.480> pro

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:50.720 
adhere it right to the front of mac pro

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:54.190 
adhere it right to the front of mac pro
like<00:06:50.930> this<00:06:51.140> and<00:06:51.850> that<00:06:52.850> should<00:06:53.300> speed<00:06:53.570> it<00:06:53.840> up<00:06:53.930> by

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:54.200 
like this and that should speed it up by

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:57.190 
like this and that should speed it up by
you<00:06:55.070> know<00:06:55.190> least<00:06:55.400> 10<00:06:55.580> seconds<00:06:55.970> or<00:06:56.060> so<00:06:56.240> I<00:06:56.480> would

00:06:57.190 --> 00:06:57.200 
you know least 10 seconds or so I would

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.480 
you know least 10 seconds or so I would
imagine<00:06:57.380> I<00:06:57.770> mean<00:06:57.950> why<00:06:58.100> else<00:06:58.160> would<00:06:58.400> they

00:06:58.480 --> 00:06:58.490 
imagine I mean why else would they

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:01.000 
imagine I mean why else would they
include<00:06:58.760> this<00:06:58.940> sticker<00:06:59.530> to<00:07:00.530> indicate<00:07:00.980> how

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:01.010 
include this sticker to indicate how

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:04.240 
include this sticker to indicate how
fast<00:07:01.340> it<00:07:01.520> is<00:07:01.610> so<00:07:02.419> is<00:07:03.410> the<00:07:03.620> equivalent<00:07:03.800> of<00:07:04.070> like

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:04.250 
fast it is so is the equivalent of like

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:06.220 
fast it is so is the equivalent of like
a<00:07:04.310> type<00:07:04.610> r<00:07:04.790> sticker<00:07:05.240> you<00:07:05.690> know<00:07:05.810> like<00:07:06.020> you<00:07:06.110> would

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:06.230 
a type r sticker you know like you would

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:09.669 
a type r sticker you know like you would
