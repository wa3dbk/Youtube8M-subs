we go let's just grab an image here and

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.340 
we go let's just grab an image here and
let's<00:00:45.870> look<00:00:46.050> at<00:00:46.289> it<00:00:46.440> when<00:00:47.219> you<00:00:47.309> say<00:00:47.460> faded<00:00:48.350> it's

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
let's look at it when you say faded it's

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.500 
let's look at it when you say faded it's
basically<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:50.039> lack<00:00:50.309> of<00:00:50.340> contrast<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.329> this

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
basically a lack of contrast and this

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.479 
basically a lack of contrast and this
one<00:00:51.750> here<00:00:51.989> if<00:00:52.079> we<00:00:52.199> look<00:00:52.379> at<00:00:52.590> it<00:00:52.770> in<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.070> develop

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
one here if we look at it in the develop

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.880 
one here if we look at it in the develop
module<00:00:53.840> there's<00:00:54.840> been<00:00:55.050> nothing<00:00:55.260> applied<00:00:55.710> to

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
module there's been nothing applied to

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.229 
module there's been nothing applied to
this<00:00:55.980> image<00:00:56.250> because<00:00:56.579> this<00:00:56.789> is<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.000> way<00:00:57.120> this

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
this image because this is the way this

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.930 
this image because this is the way this
image<00:00:57.600> was<00:00:57.809> shot<00:00:58.140> it<00:00:58.770> shot<00:00:59.399> with<00:00:59.550> that<00:00:59.699> back

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
image was shot it shot with that back

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.680 
image was shot it shot with that back
light<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.449> that<00:01:00.690> light<00:01:00.719> is<00:01:01.170> filling<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.010> lens

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
light and that light is filling the lens

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.570 
light and that light is filling the lens
with<00:01:03.690> this<00:01:04.049> light<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.650> it's<00:01:04.920> not<00:01:05.280> really

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
with this light and it's not really

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.940 
with this light and it's not really
flaring<00:01:05.939> it<00:01:06.240> but<00:01:07.020> what<00:01:07.140> it<00:01:07.229> is<00:01:07.380> doing<00:01:07.650> it's

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
flaring it but what it is doing it's

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.429 
flaring it but what it is doing it's
killing<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.790> contrast<00:01:09.330> so<00:01:09.869> if<00:01:09.960> you<00:01:10.080> go<00:01:10.229> out

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
killing the contrast so if you go out

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.940 
killing the contrast so if you go out
into<00:01:10.710> late<00:01:11.250> afternoon<00:01:11.960> in<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.439> Sun<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:13.860> you

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
into late afternoon in the Sun and you

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.859 
into late afternoon in the Sun and you
put<00:01:13.979> your<00:01:14.220> subject<00:01:14.430> with<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.210> light<00:01:15.420> back<00:01:15.689> to

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
put your subject with the light back to

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.090 
put your subject with the light back to
them<00:01:16.020> when<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.259> Sun<00:01:16.470> is<00:01:16.530> really<00:01:16.650> low<00:01:16.920> in<00:01:17.070> the

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
them when the Sun is really low in the

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.219 
them when the Sun is really low in the
sky<00:01:17.250> it's<00:01:18.240> gonna<00:01:18.420> give<00:01:18.570> you<00:01:18.659> that<00:01:18.780> nice<00:01:18.960> golden

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
sky it's gonna give you that nice golden

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.660 
sky it's gonna give you that nice golden
light<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:19.650> it's<00:01:19.830> going<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:20.009> wash<00:01:20.189> around<00:01:20.549> them

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
light and it's going to wash around them

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:21.679 
light and it's going to wash around them
it's<00:01:20.820> going<00:01:20.939> to<00:01:21.000> create<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.270> similar<00:01:21.540> effect

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
it's going to create a similar effect

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.080 
it's going to create a similar effect
you'd<00:01:22.590> be<00:01:22.680> a<00:01:22.740> little<00:01:22.860> bit<00:01:22.920> warmer<00:01:23.369> but<00:01:23.549> what<00:01:24.000> it

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
you'd be a little bit warmer but what it

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.910 
you'd be a little bit warmer but what it
does<00:01:24.210> it<00:01:24.360> kills<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.810> contrast<00:01:25.320> on<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.590> image

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
does it kills the contrast on the image

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.730 
does it kills the contrast on the image
and<00:01:26.100> it<00:01:26.640> makes<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:27.060> faded<00:01:27.630> looking<00:01:27.930> well<00:01:28.619> we're

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
and it makes it faded looking well we're

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.600 
and it makes it faded looking well we're
going<00:01:28.890> to<00:01:29.270> go<00:01:30.270> ahead<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.659> recreate<00:01:31.409> that<00:01:31.650> look

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
going to go ahead and recreate that look

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.789 
going to go ahead and recreate that look
there's<00:01:33.119> another<00:01:33.390> one<00:01:33.540> you<00:01:33.570> can<00:01:33.750> see<00:01:33.930> kind<00:01:34.770> of

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.060 
this image it's also backlit you can see
the<00:01:49.079> light<00:01:49.229> on<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.439> back<00:01:49.590> of<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.770> subjects

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
the light on the back of the subjects

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.609 
the light on the back of the subjects
head<00:01:50.220> but<00:01:51.119> you<00:01:51.299> want<00:01:51.540> it<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.780> be<00:01:51.960> that<00:01:52.140> milky

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
head but you want it to be that milky

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.700 
head but you want it to be that milky
look<00:01:52.860> you<00:01:53.280> can<00:01:53.490> do<00:01:53.670> it<00:01:53.850> and<00:01:54.030> let's<00:01:54.960> just<00:01:55.079> jump

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
look you can do it and let's just jump

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:02.450 
look you can do it and let's just jump
right<00:01:55.920> in<00:01:56.100> here<00:02:00.380> if<00:02:01.380> you<00:02:01.500> go<00:02:01.680> down<00:02:01.890> to<00:02:02.159> your

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
right in here if you go down to your

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:09.499 
right in here if you go down to your
curves<00:02:02.969> in<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.509> develop<00:02:03.899> module<00:02:04.820> okay

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.179 

you'll<00:02:09.840> see<00:02:09.989> that<00:02:10.110> you<00:02:10.200> have<00:02:10.229> this<00:02:10.530> curve<00:02:10.860> here

00:02:11.179 --> 00:02:11.189 
you'll see that you have this curve here

00:02:11.189 --> 00:02:14.330 
you'll see that you have this curve here
and<00:02:11.370> if<00:02:11.909> you<00:02:12.060> pin<00:02:12.540> this<00:02:12.780> curve<00:02:13.170> kind<00:02:14.069> of<00:02:14.159> like

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
and if you pin this curve kind of like

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.059 
and if you pin this curve kind of like
somewhere<00:02:15.269> not<00:02:15.870> in<00:02:15.930> the<00:02:16.260> middle<00:02:16.650> this<00:02:16.920> is

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
somewhere not in the middle this is

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.399 
somewhere not in the middle this is
directly<00:02:17.340> in<00:02:17.459> the<00:02:17.519> middle<00:02:17.810> somewhere<00:02:18.810> just

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:19.409 
directly in the middle somewhere just

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:22.490 
directly in the middle somewhere just
above<00:02:19.819> this<00:02:20.819> quadrant<00:02:21.659> here<00:02:21.930> someone<00:02:22.470> is

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
above this quadrant here someone is

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.410 
above this quadrant here someone is
there<00:02:22.709> you<00:02:22.799> create<00:02:23.040> a<00:02:23.069> pin<00:02:23.340> and<00:02:23.579> you<00:02:23.640> grab

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
there you create a pin and you grab

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.839 
there you create a pin and you grab
these<00:02:24.659> blacks<00:02:25.079> look<00:02:25.920> what<00:02:26.069> happens<00:02:26.400> to<00:02:26.670> this

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
these blacks look what happens to this

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:29.390 
these blacks look what happens to this
image<00:02:27.269> it<00:02:27.959> starts<00:02:28.349> to<00:02:28.500> wash<00:02:28.709> out<00:02:28.980> and<00:02:29.129> fade

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
image it starts to wash out and fade

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.430 
image it starts to wash out and fade
basically<00:02:30.269> you're<00:02:30.390> pulling<00:02:30.840> up<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:31.170> blacks

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
basically you're pulling up the blacks

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.930 
basically you're pulling up the blacks
and<00:02:31.829> you're<00:02:32.040> creating<00:02:32.549> that<00:02:32.810> that<00:02:34.940> milky

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
and you're creating that that milky

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.319 
and you're creating that that milky
black<00:02:36.180> situation<00:02:36.900> that<00:02:37.109> faded<00:02:37.560> look<00:02:37.819> okay<00:02:38.819> now

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:39.329 
black situation that faded look okay now

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:40.399 
black situation that faded look okay now
there's<00:02:39.510> some<00:02:39.599> other<00:02:39.750> things<00:02:39.930> you<00:02:39.989> can<00:02:40.140> do<00:02:40.290> to

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:40.409 
there's some other things you can do to

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:43.520 
there's some other things you can do to
your<00:02:40.500> image<00:02:40.920> just<00:02:41.370> redo<00:02:41.790> that<00:02:41.970> you<00:02:42.690> can<00:02:42.900> add<00:02:43.079> in

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
your image just redo that you can add in

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.099 
your image just redo that you can add in
I've<00:02:43.769> created<00:02:44.220> a<00:02:44.370> preset<00:02:44.909> which<00:02:45.180> does<00:02:45.750> a<00:02:45.780> lot

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:46.109 
I've created a preset which does a lot

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:46.699 
I've created a preset which does a lot
actually

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
actually

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.619 
actually
we'll<00:02:47.579> grab<00:02:47.760> this<00:02:48.030> and<00:02:48.239> we'll<00:02:48.359> apply<00:02:48.569> this

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:48.629 
we'll grab this and we'll apply this

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:50.210 
we'll grab this and we'll apply this
milky<00:02:49.079> black<00:02:49.290> now<00:02:49.470> you<00:02:49.560> can<00:02:49.680> see<00:02:49.799> the<00:02:49.950> tone

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
milky black now you can see the tone

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.580 
milky black now you can see the tone
curve<00:02:50.459> that<00:02:50.609> I<00:02:50.760> applied<00:02:51.120> with<00:02:51.780> my<00:02:51.930> milky<00:02:52.290> black

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
curve that I applied with my milky black

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.140 
curve that I applied with my milky black
but<00:02:53.400> I<00:02:53.430> also<00:02:53.700> went<00:02:54.540> into<00:02:54.829> HSL<00:02:55.829> and<00:02:56.099> I<00:02:56.430> changed<00:02:57.000> a

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
but I also went into HSL and I changed a

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.030 
but I also went into HSL and I changed a
lot<00:02:57.269> of<00:02:57.389> the<00:02:57.480> settings<00:02:57.870> for<00:02:58.049> saturations<00:02:58.739> and

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
lot of the settings for saturations and

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.399 
lot of the settings for saturations and
colors<00:02:59.700> not<00:03:00.120> created<00:03:00.480> three<00:03:00.750> presets<00:03:01.260> here

00:03:01.399 --> 00:03:01.409 
colors not created three presets here

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:03.349 
colors not created three presets here
basically<00:03:02.340> to<00:03:02.700> do<00:03:02.819> it<00:03:02.940> you<00:03:03.030> just<00:03:03.209> use<00:03:03.329> your

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:03.359 
basically to do it you just use your

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:05.119 
basically to do it you just use your
tone<00:03:03.750> curve<00:03:04.049> and<00:03:04.349> you're<00:03:04.680> just<00:03:04.799> basically

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:05.129 
tone curve and you're just basically

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:07.849 
tone curve and you're just basically
pulling<00:03:05.519> up<00:03:05.700> the<00:03:05.849> blacks<00:03:06.139> both<00:03:07.139> my<00:03:07.379> presets<00:03:07.799> I

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:07.859 
pulling up the blacks both my presets I

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:10.490 
pulling up the blacks both my presets I
want<00:03:08.010> to<00:03:08.099> apply<00:03:08.280> two<00:03:08.340> of<00:03:08.730> myriad<00:03:09.209> of<00:03:09.269> images<00:03:09.780> so

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
want to apply two of myriad of images so

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.129 
want to apply two of myriad of images so
we'll<00:03:11.010> go<00:03:11.159> ahead<00:03:11.190> and<00:03:11.609> undo<00:03:12.090> this<00:03:12.659> one<00:03:12.870> and

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:13.139 
we'll go ahead and undo this one and

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:15.890 
we'll go ahead and undo this one and
undo<00:03:13.709> it<00:03:13.829> again<00:03:13.919> and<00:03:14.459> we'll<00:03:15.269> go<00:03:15.389> to<00:03:15.599> some<00:03:15.780> other

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
undo it again and we'll go to some other

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.900 
undo it again and we'll go to some other
images<00:03:16.319> and<00:03:16.470> see<00:03:16.620> how<00:03:16.709> these<00:03:16.889> presets<00:03:17.400> work<00:03:17.639> I

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
images and see how these presets work I

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.490 
images and see how these presets work I
showed<00:03:18.510> you<00:03:18.629> how<00:03:18.720> you<00:03:18.750> just<00:03:18.989> do<00:03:19.109> it<00:03:19.230> you<00:03:19.349> do<00:03:19.470> it

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
showed you how you just do it you do it

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.580 
showed you how you just do it you do it
in<00:03:19.650> the<00:03:19.769> in<00:03:19.980> the<00:03:20.220> tone<00:03:20.430> curve<00:03:21.260> let's<00:03:22.260> go<00:03:22.410> into

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
in the in the tone curve let's go into

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.710 
in the in the tone curve let's go into
the<00:03:22.680> develop<00:03:23.040> module<00:03:23.190> and<00:03:23.669> we'll<00:03:24.359> look<00:03:24.480> at<00:03:24.599> the

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
the develop module and we'll look at the

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.229 
the develop module and we'll look at the
three<00:03:24.930> different<00:03:24.959> ones<00:03:25.500> we<00:03:25.709> have<00:03:26.030> there's<00:03:27.030> my

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
three different ones we have there's my

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.500 
three different ones we have there's my
milky<00:03:27.599> black<00:03:28.370> all<00:03:29.370> right<00:03:29.430> you<00:03:30.150> can<00:03:30.269> see<00:03:30.359> that

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
milky black all right you can see that

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.979 
milky black all right you can see that
kind<00:03:30.660> of<00:03:30.750> curve<00:03:32.120> and<00:03:33.120> we<00:03:33.329> have<00:03:33.510> one<00:03:33.840> that's

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
kind of curve and we have one that's

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:38.420 
kind of curve and we have one that's
cool<00:03:35.690> kind<00:03:36.690> of<00:03:36.750> creates<00:03:37.049> a<00:03:37.109> cooler<00:03:37.709> look<00:03:38.069> to<00:03:38.280> it

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
cool kind of creates a cooler look to it

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.000 
cool kind of creates a cooler look to it
and<00:03:39.389> we<00:03:39.660> have<00:03:39.810> one<00:03:39.989> that's<00:03:40.109> warm<00:03:40.470> since<00:03:40.829> it's

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
and we have one that's warm since it's

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.319 
and we have one that's warm since it's
already<00:03:41.129> warm<00:03:41.400> image<00:03:41.699> it's<00:03:41.910> probably<00:03:42.180> going

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
already warm image it's probably going

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:45.949 
already warm image it's probably going
to<00:03:42.389> be<00:03:42.510> quite<00:03:43.049> a<00:03:43.169> bit<00:03:43.410> one<00:03:43.940> okay<00:03:44.940> you<00:03:45.690> see<00:03:45.900> it

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
to be quite a bit one okay you see it

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:47.809 
to be quite a bit one okay you see it
also<00:03:46.079> pumps<00:03:46.560> up<00:03:46.680> the<00:03:46.709> the<00:03:47.310> highlights<00:03:47.699> a

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:47.819 
also pumps up the the highlights a

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:49.220 
also pumps up the the highlights a
little<00:03:48.000> bit<00:03:48.090> so<00:03:48.209> now<00:03:48.239> you<00:03:48.569> have<00:03:48.810> to<00:03:48.930> go<00:03:49.019> in<00:03:49.109> and

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
little bit so now you have to go in and

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:50.599 
little bit so now you have to go in and
tweak<00:03:49.410> it<00:03:49.440> if<00:03:49.739> you're<00:03:50.099> going<00:03:50.190> to<00:03:50.280> use<00:03:50.400> it<00:03:50.519> on

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:50.609 
tweak it if you're going to use it on

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:52.369 
tweak it if you're going to use it on
these<00:03:50.730> different<00:03:50.970> images<00:03:51.449> let's<00:03:51.959> take<00:03:52.139> a<00:03:52.169> look

00:03:52.369 --> 00:03:52.379 
these different images let's take a look

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:55.220 
these different images let's take a look
at<00:03:52.500> a<00:03:52.650> different<00:03:53.159> one<00:03:53.250> here<00:03:53.959> look<00:03:54.959> at<00:03:55.049> this<00:03:55.169> one

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
at a different one here look at this one

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.890 
at a different one here look at this one
here<00:03:55.680> and<00:03:55.970> say<00:03:56.970> if<00:03:57.030> we<00:03:57.180> go<00:03:57.329> into<00:03:57.449> a<00:03:57.540> develop

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
here and say if we go into a develop

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.189 
here and say if we go into a develop
module<00:03:58.319> and<00:03:58.530> we<00:03:59.129> choose<00:03:59.400> the<00:03:59.669> milky<00:04:00.000> black<00:04:00.269> you

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:01.199 
module and we choose the milky black you

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:03.470 
module and we choose the milky black you
see<00:04:01.349> how<00:04:01.470> it<00:04:01.560> kind<00:04:01.709> of<00:04:01.769> fades<00:04:02.069> it<00:04:02.310> and<00:04:03.000> we'll

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
see how it kind of fades it and we'll

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.839 
see how it kind of fades it and we'll
try<00:04:03.690> the<00:04:03.750> cool

00:04:04.839 --> 00:04:04.849 
try the cool

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:09.589 
try the cool
Jozy<00:04:05.849> fades<00:04:06.180> it<00:04:06.419> and<00:04:07.370> back<00:04:08.370> to<00:04:08.699> the<00:04:09.239> milky

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 
Jozy fades it and back to the milky

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:12.500 
Jozy fades it and back to the milky
black<00:04:09.810> warm<00:04:10.579> so<00:04:11.579> depending<00:04:12.000> on<00:04:12.090> how<00:04:12.329> your

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
black warm so depending on how your

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.839 
black warm so depending on how your
image<00:04:12.780> is<00:04:13.049> developed<00:04:13.590> you<00:04:14.190> might<00:04:14.400> have<00:04:14.609> to

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:14.849 
image is developed you might have to

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:19.069 
image is developed you might have to
adjust<00:04:15.269> it<00:04:17.030> accordingly<00:04:18.030> to<00:04:18.389> adjust<00:04:18.989> the

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
adjust it accordingly to adjust the

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.140 
adjust it accordingly to adjust the
highlight<00:04:19.409> so<00:04:19.560> you<00:04:19.650> don't<00:04:19.799> blow<00:04:19.979> them<00:04:20.099> out<00:04:20.310> so

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
highlight so you don't blow them out so

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.090 
highlight so you don't blow them out so
we'll<00:04:21.269> go<00:04:21.359> back<00:04:21.389> and<00:04:21.570> to<00:04:21.870> say<00:04:22.049> this<00:04:22.229> one<00:04:22.440> here

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
we'll go back and to say this one here

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.770 
we'll go back and to say this one here
and<00:04:23.720> we'll<00:04:24.720> try<00:04:24.960> the<00:04:25.020> milky<00:04:25.470> black<00:04:26.540> looks<00:04:27.540> kind

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
and we'll try the milky black looks kind

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.580 
and we'll try the milky black looks kind
of<00:04:27.840> cool<00:04:28.790> this<00:04:29.790> is<00:04:29.970> really<00:04:30.210> good<00:04:30.390> for<00:04:30.630> images

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
of cool this is really good for images

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:36.530 
of cool this is really good for images
that<00:04:31.800> are<00:04:32.010> naturally<00:04:32.700> lit<00:04:32.970> and<00:04:33.860> the<00:04:34.860> warm<00:04:35.540> okay

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.260 
look you can adjust your tone curve

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.380 
look you can adjust your tone curve
again<00:04:41.040> in<00:04:41.190> my<00:04:41.340> presets<00:04:41.880> that<00:04:42.060> I<00:04:42.180> have

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:42.390 
again in my presets that I have

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:45.110 
again in my presets that I have
available<00:04:42.930> they<00:04:43.710> are<00:04:43.740> have<00:04:44.400> quite<00:04:44.700> a<00:04:44.730> bit<00:04:44.970> of

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
available they are have quite a bit of

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.060 
available they are have quite a bit of
adjustments<00:04:45.720> done<00:04:45.870> to<00:04:46.050> them<00:04:46.230> you<00:04:46.770> can<00:04:46.890> see

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
adjustments done to them you can see

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.690 
adjustments done to them you can see
looking<00:04:47.460> at<00:04:47.640> the<00:04:48.200> HSL<00:04:49.200> in<00:04:49.440> the<00:04:50.040> color<00:04:50.280> even

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:50.700 
looking at the HSL in the color even

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.630 
looking at the HSL in the color even
I've<00:04:51.150> adjusted<00:04:51.330> some<00:04:51.750> of<00:04:51.840> the<00:04:51.930> hues<00:04:52.430> the<00:04:53.430> tone

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:53.640 
I've adjusted some of the hues the tone

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:57.650 
I've adjusted some of the hues the tone
curve<00:04:54.560> I've<00:04:55.560> applied<00:04:55.950> you<00:04:56.820> know<00:04:56.970> different

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:57.660 
curve I've applied you know different

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.230 
curve I've applied you know different
white<00:04:57.780> bounces<00:04:58.170> based<00:04:58.380> on<00:04:58.940> the<00:04:59.940> one<00:05:00.120> you

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
white bounces based on the one you

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.990 
white bounces based on the one you
choose<00:05:00.510> it<00:05:01.350> goes<00:05:01.560> in<00:05:01.800> adjust<00:05:02.280> the<00:05:02.400> clarity<00:05:02.850> and

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 
choose it goes in adjust the clarity and

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.240 
choose it goes in adjust the clarity and
saturation<00:05:03.210> and<00:05:03.810> vibrance<00:05:03.930> a<00:05:04.290> little<00:05:04.500> bit<00:05:04.650> so

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:05.250 
saturation and vibrance a little bit so

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:07.100 
saturation and vibrance a little bit so
there's<00:05:05.970> more<00:05:06.180> to<00:05:06.240> it<00:05:06.420> than<00:05:06.600> just<00:05:06.660> a<00:05:06.900> tone

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
there's more to it than just a tone

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.160 
there's more to it than just a tone
curve<00:05:07.350> to<00:05:07.530> refine<00:05:07.890> my<00:05:08.100> preset<00:05:08.550> but<00:05:09.390> the<00:05:09.780> basic

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:10.170 
curve to refine my preset but the basic

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:12.800 
curve to refine my preset but the basic
principle<00:05:10.710> is<00:05:10.860> the<00:05:11.550> same<00:05:11.580> if<00:05:12.180> you<00:05:12.540> pull<00:05:12.780> up

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810 
principle is the same if you pull up

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.620 
principle is the same if you pull up
that<00:05:13.080> black<00:05:13.320> tone<00:05:13.620> curve<00:05:13.940> so<00:05:14.940> that's<00:05:15.120> it<00:05:15.390> I

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:15.630 
that black tone curve so that's it I

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:17.060 
that black tone curve so that's it I
want<00:05:15.990> to<00:05:16.140> thank<00:05:16.260> you<00:05:16.350> all<00:05:16.470> for<00:05:16.500> spending<00:05:16.770> some
