one<00:00:01.110> of<00:00:01.230> the<00:00:01.350> cool<00:00:01.589> advantages<00:00:02.159> of

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:02.190 
one of the cool advantages of

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.280 
one of the cool advantages of
morph-o-matic<00:00:02.550> is<00:00:03.090> its<00:00:03.240> ability<00:00:03.689> to<00:00:03.899> extract

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
morph-o-matic is its ability to extract

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.499 
morph-o-matic is its ability to extract
all<00:00:04.650> targets<00:00:05.339> and<00:00:05.549> to<00:00:05.700> keep<00:00:05.879> them<00:00:06.120> connected

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
all targets and to keep them connected

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.030 
all targets and to keep them connected
inside<00:00:07.080> of<00:00:07.200> morph-o-matic<00:00:09.530> this<00:00:10.530> means<00:00:10.830> that

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
inside of morph-o-matic this means that

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.980 
inside of morph-o-matic this means that
you<00:00:11.160> can<00:00:11.340> easily<00:00:11.820> modify<00:00:12.030> your<00:00:12.509> characters

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
you can easily modify your characters

to extract all of the morph targets at

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.299 
to extract all of the morph targets at
once<00:00:45.500> so<00:00:46.500> if<00:00:46.620> you<00:00:46.710> go<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.070> morph-o-matic

extracting options one of these is

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.790 
extracting options one of these is

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
extraction is completed you can see all

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.330 
extraction is completed you can see all
of<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:18.030> morph<00:01:18.240> targets<00:01:18.630> as<00:01:18.979> you<00:01:19.979> will<00:01:20.100> notice

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
of the morph targets as you will notice

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.429 
of the morph targets as you will notice
this<00:01:20.670> character<00:01:21.090> has<00:01:21.270> an<00:01:21.479> enormous<00:01:21.780> amount<00:01:22.350> of

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
this character has an enormous amount of

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.280 
this character has an enormous amount of
targets<00:01:22.890> as<00:01:23.100> it<00:01:23.700> has<00:01:23.880> very<00:01:24.030> complex<00:01:24.689> rig<00:01:25.080> with

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
targets as it has very complex rig with

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.539 
targets as it has very complex rig with
over<00:01:25.619> 80<00:01:25.860> channels<00:01:27.560> all<00:01:28.560> of<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.009> targets<00:01:29.400> we

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
over 80 channels all of the targets we

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.069 
over 80 channels all of the targets we
can<00:01:29.700> see<00:01:29.970> now<00:01:30.180> are<00:01:30.360> connected<00:01:30.930> to

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
can see now are connected to

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.710 
can see now are connected to
morph-o-matic<00:01:31.549> so<00:01:32.549> even<00:01:32.820> if<00:01:32.909> we<00:01:33.090> delete<00:01:33.479> them

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
morph-o-matic so even if we delete them

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.109 
morph-o-matic so even if we delete them
from<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:34.110> scene<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:35.220> targets<00:01:35.670> will<00:01:35.820> remain

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
from the scene the targets will remain

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.069 
from the scene the targets will remain
connected<00:01:37.189> so<00:01:38.189> click<00:01:38.490> on<00:01:38.670> auto<00:01:38.970> load<00:01:39.540> target

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
connected so click on auto load target

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.530 
connected so click on auto load target
and<00:01:40.320> you<00:01:40.770> can<00:01:40.950> easily<00:01:41.159> pick<00:01:41.610> one<00:01:41.909> target<00:01:42.390> and

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
and you can easily pick one target and

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.749 
and you can easily pick one target and
make<00:01:42.780> some<00:01:42.990> modifications<00:01:46.250> let's<00:01:47.250> convert<00:01:47.610> it

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
make some modifications let's convert it

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.999 
make some modifications let's convert it
to<00:01:47.790> mesh<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:48.450> pick<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.049> vertices<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.710> change

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
to mesh and pick the vertices to change

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.950 
to mesh and pick the vertices to change
and<00:01:50.430> then<00:01:51.180> we<00:01:51.299> can<00:01:51.479> make<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.780> necessary

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
and then we can make the necessary

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.630 
and then we can make the necessary
adjustments<00:01:52.729> if<00:01:54.619> you<00:01:55.619> then<00:01:55.799> select<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.430> head

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
adjustments if you then select the head

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.429 
adjustments if you then select the head
object<00:01:57.119> you'll<00:01:57.780> notice<00:01:58.140> that<00:01:58.290> the

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
object you'll notice that the

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.530 
object you'll notice that the
modifications<00:01:59.250> made<00:01:59.549> to<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.880> target<00:02:00.360> were

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
modifications made to the target were

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.510 
modifications made to the target were
automatically<00:02:01.259> applied<00:02:04.070> when<00:02:05.070> you<00:02:05.159> need<00:02:05.340> to

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
automatically applied when you need to

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.880 
automatically applied when you need to
work<00:02:05.700> on<00:02:05.939> a<00:02:05.969> certain<00:02:06.390> target<00:02:06.630> you<00:02:07.290> can<00:02:07.439> simply

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
work on a certain target you can simply

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.480 
work on a certain target you can simply
extract<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.610> one<00:02:08.789> you<00:02:08.910> need<00:02:09.060> to<00:02:09.209> work<00:02:09.360> on

as I mentioned before all of these morph

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.730 
as I mentioned before all of these morph
targets<00:02:16.420> are<00:02:16.540> not<00:02:16.570> necessary<00:02:17.380> in<00:02:17.560> the<00:02:17.680> scene

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740
