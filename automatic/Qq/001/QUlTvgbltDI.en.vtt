00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.460
 maths 

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:06.950
 the one that thematic numbers and 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:09.110
 proportionality now we will see how 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.230
 locate infinite decimal numbers in the 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.940
 number line 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:15.940
 we know that decimals are three 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:18.240
 types the finite containers by 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.310
 example 8.2 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.610
 the infinite decimals are divided into 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.580
 two periodic infinite types by 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:30.029
 example the 5.32 etcetera where the 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:33.270
 stress period written 5.3 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:38.180
 newspapers the infinite semi newspapers 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:41.330
 for example the 1.2 666 666 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.550
 where the ante periods 2 and the semi 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:48.329
 period in 6 is infinitely revised and 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:50.370
 It can include 126 semi periodic 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.100
 how they place decimals on the straight 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.800
 numerical we will see an example as 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.409
 we will place the 5.3 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:02.110
 we know that 5.3 is between 5 and 6 so 

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:05.269
 we will place it in this sector 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:07.280
 truth between 5 and 6 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:10.610
 let's see 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:15.580
 we know first of all that the 5,33 333 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.580
 is greater than 5.3 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.720
 we will indicate 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.920
 and the number line 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.869
 53 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:31.220
 but we also know that 5,33 etcetera is 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:34.930
 less than 54 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.930
 we play on the number line 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:40.750
 5.4 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:43.329
 so yes 53 newspaper is greater than 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:47.340
 5.3 and less than 5.4 you will find 

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:47.340
 among them we will place 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.770
 among them the 5.3 newspaper 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.630
 that's the way to educate decimals 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.090
 infinities on the number line look for a 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.710
 finite decimal less a finite decimal 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.710
 greater and locate it between them
