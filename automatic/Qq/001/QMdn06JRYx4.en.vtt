 I love it and that's why I also think 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.379
 which is very strawberry and what are we going to do 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:03.780
 first we place lemons more dry frac 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:07.409
 with fresh fish and that's the way it's vital 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:10.350
 already after adding lemon slices 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.940
 let's go for some grapefruit this 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.490
 way he's going to put it on you dress like 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.380
 ' imposing them is and on top of one another 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.570
 to make it super pretty and now 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.670
 we are going to place this here, this is the 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.550
 order according to also the form of the 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.980
 lemon fillet fish toronto 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:29.070
 orange and now if we take and shut it 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.840
 not very simple very very negative the 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.460
 creative like grandma's and now 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.650
 here please lady come closer 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.540
 important dramatization see these steps 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.480
 We're going to do here first for me tanya 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.730
 a little knot goes from 10 super simple 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:44.160
 let's let the thread pass here 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:46.470
 from here and here we are going to close the 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:49.320
 point is always to leave it well 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.600
 small tie goes before closing this knot 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.520
 I will close perfectly at once 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.130
 for good and then we will go through 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.170
 under this way and here important 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.330
 lady that the subsidy be close no 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.010
 you have to leave a lot of space throughout 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.200
 of our thread but he does not super 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:07.230
 close the subsidy there goes going 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:10.649
 happening ayayay this is a true 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:12.210
 thread party and after that we are going to 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.950
 to pass like this in Italy 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:16.380
 if you look there we will see correctly 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.000
 how that operation goes down to fill the 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.800
 fillet to fill the filet 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.080
 exactly we went below and here 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.030
 again we closed super super well and 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.590
 we put below my task this 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.989
 way and again we go here 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.310
 it seems that it is loosening but it is good 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:31.500
 moment to return 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.480
 give strength to our beloved and what 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.280
 let's let this happen again 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.080
 long because if you are not going to have to go 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.650
 adding many pieces of thread not 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.630
 worth it 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.610
 it's better to run a little with the 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.310
 thread and there we go happening goes again 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:47.220
 we went through here and let the third 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.830
 thread that is on this side tie and pull 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.510
 perfectly to the rest 7 was left a 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.220
 little bit from outside we tie it again 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.800
 much stronger what we are looking for 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.380
 is to compact in the citrus fruits that you put 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.120
 with the steak exactly there is not you 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.400
 it seems we make a last emit this one 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.380
 it seems that to add now yes we are going to 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.000
 leave a part of the grapefruit here 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.610
 close we passed under lady 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.530
 dramatization after something is 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.299
 desacomoda do not worry we return to 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.610
 accommodate from here and there we finish 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:16.260
 of doing our suicide others like 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.299
 it could be seen they are loosening but it is 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.190
 good time again to give strength and 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:21.720
 we finished with our subsidy 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.680
 repeating this operation to stop 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.780
 get to the end 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.830
 there they are, there are 2 that you can see if you do not 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:30.640
 let's do magic you think 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:32.110
 and the magic appears here and we are going to 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.170
 take our pan hot 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.920
 we take a splash of oil from this 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.810
 shape 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.520
 let's always be important 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.680
 pan at the point that we like to 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.750
 let it run and now we are going to give it 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.240

 we leave applause applause to products 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.000
 from the sea to our fish that can be 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.890
