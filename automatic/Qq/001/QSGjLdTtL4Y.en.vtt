00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710 
to go through that whole process of

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.350 
to go through that whole process of
showing<00:00:45.890> you<00:00:46.040> how<00:00:46.100> to<00:00:46.130> tap<00:00:46.430> it<00:00:46.640> but<00:00:47.630> basically

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:49.360

wrenches<00:00:50.360> don't<00:00:50.540> work<00:00:50.690> very<00:00:50.720> well<00:00:50.990> under

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.110 
wrenches don't work very well under

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:52.930 
wrenches don't work very well under
because<00:00:51.380> they're<00:00:51.560> so<00:00:51.710> light<00:00:52.010> and<00:00:52.310> small<00:00:52.580> I

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
because they're so light and small I

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.000 
because they're so light and small I
prefer<00:00:53.810> to<00:00:53.930> use<00:00:53.960> a<00:00:54.080> bit<00:00:54.350> crescent<00:00:54.740> on<00:00:54.800> here<00:00:54.950> to

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
prefer to use a bit crescent on here to

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.400 
prefer to use a bit crescent on here to
get<00:00:55.100> some<00:00:55.340> weight<00:00:55.520> behind<00:00:55.730> it<00:00:56.000> and<00:00:56.600> the<00:00:57.170> most

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.410 
get some weight behind it and the most

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.050 
get some weight behind it and the most
critical<00:00:57.950> part<00:00:58.160> is<00:00:58.310> make<00:00:58.520> sure<00:00:58.550> that<00:00:58.850> you<00:00:58.970> get

00:00:59.050 --> 00:00:59.060 
critical part is make sure that you get

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.300 
critical part is make sure that you get
the<00:00:59.210> first<00:00:59.390> couple<00:01:00.320> of<00:01:00.530> friends<00:01:00.830> sturdy<00:01:01.130> right

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:01.310 
the first couple of friends sturdy right

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.240 
the first couple of friends sturdy right
I've<00:01:01.460> already<00:01:01.550> tapped<00:01:01.910> this<00:01:02.240> so<00:01:03.100> ahead<00:01:04.100> of<00:01:04.129> the

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
I've already tapped this so ahead of the

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.330 
I've already tapped this so ahead of the
game<00:01:04.400> but<00:01:04.760> anyhow<00:01:05.089> you<00:01:05.980> make<00:01:06.980> sure<00:01:07.100> that<00:01:07.250> it

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
game but anyhow you make sure that it

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.240 
game but anyhow you make sure that it
gets<00:01:07.460> threaded<00:01:07.880> straight<00:01:08.240> and<00:01:09.070> after<00:01:10.070> you<00:01:10.160> get

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
gets threaded straight and after you get

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:11.500 
gets threaded straight and after you get
it<00:01:10.340> in<00:01:10.400> there<00:01:10.580> just<00:01:10.700> a<00:01:10.820> little<00:01:10.880> ways<00:01:11.150> well<00:01:11.390> then

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
it in there just a little ways well then

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.470 
it in there just a little ways well then
you<00:01:11.600> wants<00:01:11.870> you<00:01:12.400> site<00:01:13.400> down<00:01:13.940> through<00:01:14.180> the<00:01:14.270> top

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:14.480 
you wants you site down through the top

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.140 
you wants you site down through the top
from<00:01:15.380> the<00:01:15.410> back<00:01:15.710> to<00:01:15.980> make<00:01:16.100> sure<00:01:16.310> there's<00:01:16.610> not

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
from the back to make sure there's not

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.800 
from the back to make sure there's not
grouping<00:01:17.660> or<00:01:18.020> grow<00:01:18.410> up<00:01:18.530> for<00:01:19.280> this<00:01:19.510> sideways<00:01:20.510> on

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
grouping or grow up for this sideways on

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.210 
grouping or grow up for this sideways on
floor<00:01:21.110> to<00:01:21.290> backwards<00:01:21.620> here<00:01:21.770> I'll<00:01:21.950> make<00:01:22.070> sure

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
floor to backwards here I'll make sure

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:23.950 
floor to backwards here I'll make sure
that's<00:01:22.400> directly<00:01:23.060> aligned<00:01:23.450> with<00:01:23.660> the<00:01:23.780> hole

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
that's directly aligned with the hole

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.020 
that's directly aligned with the hole
that's<00:01:24.800> the<00:01:24.920> most<00:01:25.040> critical<00:01:25.520> part<00:01:25.730> once<00:01:25.910> you

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
that's the most critical part once you

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.420 
that's the most critical part once you
get<00:01:26.150> that<00:01:26.360> resolved<00:01:27.200> then<00:01:27.350> you<00:01:27.440> can<00:01:27.560> just<00:01:27.740> tap

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
get that resolved then you can just tap

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.460 
get that resolved then you can just tap
it<00:01:28.580> in<00:01:28.700> a<00:01:28.730> typical<00:01:29.510> tapping<00:01:29.900> you<00:01:29.990> just<00:01:30.170> go<00:01:30.290> in

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
it in a typical tapping you just go in

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.950 
it in a typical tapping you just go in
like<00:01:30.500> horror<00:01:31.370> of<00:01:31.490> eternity<00:01:31.909> atleast<00:01:32.630> minute

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
lock take the insert into there so you

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.160 
lock take the insert into there so you
need<00:02:16.980> to<00:02:17.040> have<00:02:17.130> a<00:02:17.190> clean<00:02:17.430> dry<00:02:17.640> surface<00:02:18.050> and<00:02:19.050> up

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
need to have a clean dry surface and up

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.920 
need to have a clean dry surface and up
here<00:02:19.410> at<00:02:19.650> the<00:02:20.400> front<00:02:20.520> of<00:02:20.670> that<00:02:20.730> of<00:02:21.420> this<00:02:21.660> tube

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
here at the front of that of this tube

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.390 
here at the front of that of this tube
here<00:02:22.140> there's<00:02:22.350> a<00:02:22.410> pin<00:02:22.680> that<00:02:22.890> locks<00:02:22.920> it<00:02:23.250> into

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
here there's a pin that locks it into

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.850 
here there's a pin that locks it into
this<00:02:23.610> piece<00:02:23.880> and<00:02:24.750> the<00:02:24.870> TN<00:02:25.140> actually<00:02:25.530> has<00:02:25.830> a

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
this piece and the TN actually has a

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.310 
this piece and the TN actually has a
hole<00:02:26.160> in<00:02:26.340> it<00:02:26.430> and<00:02:26.610> you<00:02:26.970> can<00:02:27.090> take<00:02:27.270> air<00:02:27.930> and

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
hole in it and you can take air and

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.920 
hole in it and you can take air and
blowing<00:02:28.620> through<00:02:28.860> that<00:02:29.010> hole<00:02:29.250> and<00:02:29.780> then<00:02:30.780> that

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
blowing through that hole and then that

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.560 
blowing through that hole and then that
will<00:02:31.050> blow<00:02:31.200> all<00:02:31.530> the<00:02:31.830> filings<00:02:32.820> back<00:02:33.150> out<00:02:33.360> here

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
will blow all the filings back out here

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.140 
will blow all the filings back out here
rather<00:02:33.750> than<00:02:33.870> blowing<00:02:34.200> deeper<00:02:34.620> into<00:02:34.800> the<00:02:34.890> hole

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
rather than blowing deeper into the hole

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.430 
rather than blowing deeper into the hole
so<00:02:36.150> do<00:02:36.450> that<00:02:36.600> a<00:02:36.630> couple<00:02:36.690> of<00:02:36.960> times<00:02:37.080> get<00:02:37.260> it<00:02:37.350> good

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
so do that a couple of times get it good

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.840 
so do that a couple of times get it good
and<00:02:37.560> clean<00:02:37.680> make<00:02:38.160> sure<00:02:38.340> you've<00:02:38.550> got<00:02:38.580> to<00:02:38.760> get

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
and clean make sure you've got to get

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.450 
and clean make sure you've got to get
clean<00:02:39.120> dry<00:02:39.330> surface<00:02:39.540> and<00:02:40.280> get<00:02:41.280> out<00:02:41.430> your

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
clean dry surface and get out your

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.180 
clean dry surface and get out your
insert<00:02:42.000> and<00:02:42.780> put<00:02:43.140> some<00:02:43.380> red<00:02:43.560> loctite<00:02:43.800> on<00:02:44.100> the

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
insert and put some red loctite on the

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.760 
insert and put some red loctite on the
insert<00:02:44.540> and<00:02:45.540> add<00:02:45.690> one<00:02:45.930> end<00:02:46.110> of<00:02:46.170> the<00:02:46.260> insert<00:02:46.590> is

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
insert and add one end of the insert is

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.490 
insert and add one end of the insert is
just<00:02:47.640> Tendo<00:02:48.060> blank<00:02:48.330> the<00:02:48.540> other<00:02:48.660> end<00:02:48.870> has<00:02:49.110> a

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
just Tendo blank the other end has a

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:58.970 
just Tendo blank the other end has a
place<00:02:50.400> for<00:02:50.640> an<00:02:50.700> Allen<00:02:50.910> wrench<00:02:55.040> so<00:02:57.770> you<00:02:58.770> put

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
place for an Allen wrench so you put

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:09.520 
place for an Allen wrench so you put
down<00:02:59.160> Internet<00:02:59.790> and<00:03:00.480> it<00:03:00.810> gets<00:03:00.990> started

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.100 

you<00:03:10.530> want<00:03:10.710> this<00:03:10.860> to<00:03:11.010> end<00:03:11.040> up<00:03:11.280> flush<00:03:11.820> I<00:03:12.240> feel<00:03:13.080> a

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
you want this to end up flush I feel a

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:14.750 
you want this to end up flush I feel a
little<00:03:13.200> deeper<00:03:13.650> that's<00:03:13.950> that's<00:03:14.250> righti<00:03:14.610> I

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
little deeper that's that's righti I

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.000 
little deeper that's that's righti I
doesn't<00:03:15.060> like<00:03:15.240> matter<00:03:15.540> but<00:03:15.750> you<00:03:16.470> know<00:03:16.560> perfect

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
doesn't like matter but you know perfect

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.150 
doesn't like matter but you know perfect
would<00:03:17.280> be<00:03:17.430> my<00:03:18.390> right<00:03:18.570> in<00:03:18.690> there

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
would be my right in there

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:24.290 
would be my right in there
and<00:03:20.160> now<00:03:21.800> there's<00:03:22.800> bolts<00:03:23.730> that<00:03:23.880> come<00:03:24.030> with<00:03:24.210> the

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 
and now there's bolts that come with the

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:30.680 
and now there's bolts that come with the
kit<00:03:24.540> and<00:03:27.230> lips<00:03:28.230> bolts<00:03:28.640> thread<00:03:29.640> right<00:03:29.790> into<00:03:30.000> the

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
kit and lips bolts thread right into the

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:31.940 
kit and lips bolts thread right into the
end<00:03:30.810> here<00:03:30.990> and<00:03:31.080> then<00:03:31.350> hold<00:03:31.500> your<00:03:31.650> hand<00:03:31.860> right

end here and then hold your hand right
in<00:03:32.130> position<00:03:32.840> so<00:03:33.840> it's<00:03:33.960> just<00:03:34.110> that<00:03:34.230> simple

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:34.740 
in position so it's just that simple

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.870 
in position so it's just that simple
it's<00:03:34.950> a<00:03:35.070> pretty<00:03:35.730> simple<00:03:36.000> process<00:03:36.210> from<00:03:36.660> there

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
it's a pretty simple process from there

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.900 
it's a pretty simple process from there
I<00:03:38.880> like<00:03:39.570> to<00:03:39.840> glue<00:03:40.680> the<00:03:40.830> grips<00:03:41.010> on<00:03:41.220> and<00:03:41.490> safety

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
I like to glue the grips on and safety

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.860 
I like to glue the grips on and safety
wire<00:03:42.170> and<00:03:44.060> this<00:03:45.060> is<00:03:45.180> rim<00:03:45.360> fall<00:03:45.540> grip<00:03:45.750> so

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
wire and this is rim fall grip so

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.000 
wire and this is rim fall grip so
there's<00:03:46.020> a<00:03:46.050> little<00:03:46.230> oil<00:03:46.350> on<00:03:46.500> the<00:03:46.650> end<00:03:46.770> of<00:03:46.830> it<00:03:46.980> so

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
there's a little oil on the end of it so

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.610 
there's a little oil on the end of it so
I<00:03:47.100> look<00:03:47.220> to<00:03:47.280> make<00:03:47.490> sure<00:03:47.520> the<00:03:47.910> artists<00:03:48.620> position

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
I look to make sure the artists position

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.850 
I look to make sure the artists position
properly<00:03:50.810> this<00:03:51.810> is<00:03:52.020> just<00:03:52.200> some<00:03:52.350> honda<00:03:52.680> grip

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 
properly this is just some honda grip

00:03:52.860 --> 00:04:02.760 
properly this is just some honda grip
glue<00:03:53.070> there's<00:03:53.430> a<00:03:53.580> lot<00:03:53.730> of<00:03:53.850> different<00:03:54.180> kinds<00:03:54.420> of

started

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:27.950 

position<00:04:16.940> again

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.610

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
that much Snickers here and you've got

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:32.719 
that much Snickers here and you've got
the<00:04:31.710> grip<00:04:31.860> all<00:04:32.009> the<00:04:32.069> way<00:04:32.190> on<00:04:32.340> but<00:04:32.580> you've

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:32.729 
the grip all the way on but you've

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:34.700 
the grip all the way on but you've
covered<00:04:32.910> up<00:04:33.180> the<00:04:33.419> insert<00:04:34.020> that's<00:04:34.139> just<00:04:34.440> put<00:04:34.620> on

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
covered up the insert that's just put on

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.460 
covered up the insert that's just put on
there<00:04:35.180> so<00:04:36.180> I<00:04:36.210> take<00:04:36.509> an<00:04:36.630> exacto<00:04:37.050> knife<00:04:37.259> and<00:04:37.380> I

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
there so I take an exacto knife and I

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.080 
there so I take an exacto knife and I
always<00:04:37.650> use<00:04:37.770> a<00:04:37.800> brand<00:04:38.099> new<00:04:38.220> blade<00:04:38.460> because

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
always use a brand new blade because

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.059 
always use a brand new blade because
this<00:04:39.300> rubber<00:04:39.599> doesn't<00:04:39.930> up<00:04:40.169> really<00:04:40.440> quickly<00:04:40.740> I

00:04:41.059 --> 00:04:41.069 
this rubber doesn't up really quickly I

00:04:41.069 --> 00:04:44.089 
this rubber doesn't up really quickly I
just<00:04:41.849> can't<00:04:42.030> reach<00:04:42.360> em<00:04:42.449> and<00:04:42.630> I<00:04:42.690> find<00:04:42.990> that<00:04:43.110> into

00:04:44.089 --> 00:04:44.099 
just can't reach em and I find that into

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:59.050 
just can't reach em and I find that into
the<00:04:44.220> handlebar<00:04:44.669> I<00:04:46.310> trim<00:04:47.310> it<00:04:47.430> off

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:02.350

the safety wire and another one out here

a<00:05:32.620> lot<00:05:33.620> of<00:05:33.740> guys<00:05:33.860> put<00:05:34.250> the<00:05:34.550> ends<00:05:35.060> of<00:05:35.150> the<00:05:35.210> safety

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:35.479 
a lot of guys put the ends of the safety

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:36.730 
a lot of guys put the ends of the safety
we're<00:05:35.630> in<00:05:35.720> the<00:05:35.780> wrong<00:05:35.900> place<00:05:35.960> they<00:05:36.440> put<00:05:36.470> it<00:05:36.680> in

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:36.740 
we're in the wrong place they put it in

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.650 
we're in the wrong place they put it in
the<00:05:36.830> front<00:05:37.010> of<00:05:37.070> the<00:05:37.160> handle<00:05:37.370> bar<00:05:37.580> if<00:05:38.360> you<00:05:38.419> stop

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:38.660 
the front of the handle bar if you stop

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:40.060 
the front of the handle bar if you stop
and<00:05:38.810> think<00:05:38.870> about<00:05:38.990> that<00:05:39.169> as<00:05:39.830> you're<00:05:39.919> holding

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:40.070 
and think about that as you're holding

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:41.740 
and think about that as you're holding
on<00:05:40.280> the<00:05:40.370> bike<00:05:40.550> those<00:05:40.940> are<00:05:41.090> just<00:05:41.180> digging<00:05:41.479> into

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:41.750 
on the bike those are just digging into

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:45.310 
on the bike those are just digging into
your<00:05:42.050> palm<00:05:42.620> and<00:05:43.630> so<00:05:44.630> it<00:05:44.870> works<00:05:45.050> out<00:05:45.200> much

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:45.320 
your palm and so it works out much

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:46.750 
your palm and so it works out much
better<00:05:45.560> if<00:05:45.710> you<00:05:45.800> put<00:05:45.950> it<00:05:46.040> back<00:05:46.160> here<00:05:46.490> to<00:05:46.639> where

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:46.760 
better if you put it back here to where

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:47.860 
better if you put it back here to where
it<00:05:46.790> seems<00:05:47.090> like<00:05:47.180> it<00:05:47.360> would<00:05:47.450> dig<00:05:47.600> into<00:05:47.750> your

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:47.870 
it seems like it would dig into your

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:50.230 
it seems like it would dig into your
palm<00:05:48.050> in<00:05:48.200> a<00:05:48.260> desert<00:05:48.669> because<00:05:49.669> you're<00:05:50.120> not

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:50.240 
palm in a desert because you're not

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.700 
palm in a desert because you're not
putting<00:05:50.450> much<00:05:50.660> pressure<00:05:50.990> on<00:05:51.229> this<00:05:51.410> end<00:05:51.590> of<00:05:51.650> the

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:51.710 
putting much pressure on this end of the

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:53.500 
putting much pressure on this end of the
bar<00:05:51.860> you're<00:05:52.070> actually<00:05:52.460> gripping<00:05:53.180> and<00:05:53.300> pulling

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:53.510 
bar you're actually gripping and pulling

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:55.360 
bar you're actually gripping and pulling
back<00:05:53.690> from<00:05:54.350> for<00:05:54.620> the<00:05:54.710> front<00:05:54.950> section<00:05:55.280> of<00:05:55.310> the

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:55.370 
back from for the front section of the

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:57.190 
back from for the front section of the
wire<00:05:55.550> so<00:05:56.120> you<00:05:56.150> don't<00:05:56.389> want<00:05:56.570> that<00:05:56.720> safety<00:05:57.020> wire

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:57.200 
wire so you don't want that safety wire

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.250 
wire so you don't want that safety wire
and<00:05:57.470> digging<00:05:57.950> into<00:05:58.070> you<00:05:58.780> that's<00:05:59.780> all<00:05:59.990> for<00:06:00.169> now

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:00.260 
and digging into you that's all for now

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.010 
and digging into you that's all for now
