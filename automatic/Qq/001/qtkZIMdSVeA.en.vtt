Patty McGoldrick NP, MPA: So what causes epilepsy?

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.140
There's a bunch of different things that can
cause epilepsy.

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:13.330
The simpler things are things like strokes,
bleeding in the brain, parts of the brain

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.599
that have formed abnormally, accidents, trauma.

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:21.490
There are also idiopathic epilepsies, where
we don't know what they're caused by.

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.010
We're doing a lot of genetic research into
epilepsy to find out what causes certain syndromes

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.010
of epilepsy.

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:31.109
Steve Wolf MD: Now you mentioned the brain
not developing properly, and sometimes we

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.900
use the word "cortical dysplasia" or "migration
defects."

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:39.300
This is when the brain, when it's forming
inside the mother's belly, that the brain

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.190
just doesn't form properly and leaves an island
of abnormal cells that can cause short circuits.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:52.000
Patty: And there are certain diseases, things
like tuberous sclerosis and neurofibromatosis

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.289
that have abnormalities in the brain and the
skin at the same time so that you can tell

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:01.050
if a person has certain types of birthmarks,
they're more liable to have something abnormal

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.230
on the brain as well.

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:07.240
Steve: So these two different types of epilepsies
are best detected by MRI, because they can

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.780
look at the structure of the brain and tell
us if those are the causes.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.030
We can look at the skin to see if there's
anything going on.

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.490
But tell me about the idiopathic ones.

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.090
Patty: The idiopathic ones are the ones that
arise in childhood.

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.960
So there are a certain number of epileptic
encephalopathies that happen in infancy.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.200
And we're not really sure why children get
them.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.479
There's absence that occurs in early childhood.

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:30.710
There's benign rolandic.

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.290
That's another syndrome.

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.630
And then there are, of course, there's autism
which is associated with a very high percentage

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.140
of epilepsy and seizures.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.130
And we're doing a lot of genetic testing to
look at what the genetic basis is for epilepsy.

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.560
Steve: So in this idiopathic group, I find
so fascinating, is that genetics is going

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.210
to play a lot in the future.

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.890
And soon we will be able to do more testing
to find out what is the genetic abnormality

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.850
that's causing these seizures, and that might
help us to make the diagnosis.

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.930
Patty: The other thing is that we tend to
think of epilepsy as one disease, and it's

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:00.930
really not.

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:01.930
It's multifactorial.

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:03.479
There are a lot of different causes for it.

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.810
There are a lot of different types of seizures.

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.350
So as our technology gets better and as our
treatments get better, we'll have a much better

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.050
idea of what actually causes epilepsy beyond
the things that we've always known.
