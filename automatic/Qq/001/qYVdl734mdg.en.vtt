rosula there's a much more definition

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.190 
rosula there's a much more definition
like<00:00:47.879> seed<00:00:48.239> of<00:00:48.270> juicing<00:00:48.690> is<00:00:48.780> better<00:00:48.960> when<00:00:49.110> I

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
like seed of juicing is better when I

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.350 
like seed of juicing is better when I
DeAndre<00:00:49.680> seems<00:00:49.890> better<00:00:50.100> it<00:00:51.000> just<00:00:51.180> seems

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
DeAndre seems better it just seems

is<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:54.989> lot<00:00:55.230> more<00:00:55.289> better<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:56.129> define<00:00:56.430> because

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
is a lot more better to define because

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.479 
is a lot more better to define because
the<00:00:57.000> guys<00:00:57.239> warning<00:00:57.780> of<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:57.960> ball<00:00:58.289> know<00:00:59.129> where
