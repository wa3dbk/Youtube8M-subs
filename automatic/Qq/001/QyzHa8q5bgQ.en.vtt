00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.889 
you know wait the 17 days for it to get
here<00:00:37.469> so<00:00:38.129> it<00:00:38.250> finally<00:00:38.520> arrived<00:00:39.030> and<00:00:39.420> I<00:00:39.870> was

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
here so it finally arrived and I was

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.200 
here so it finally arrived and I was
actually<00:00:40.260> surprised<00:00:41.040> that<00:00:41.309> it<00:00:41.520> was<00:00:41.640> a<00:00:41.670> pretty

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
actually surprised that it was a pretty

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.740 
actually surprised that it was a pretty
good<00:00:42.390> quality<00:00:42.870> flashlight<00:00:43.469> it's<00:00:43.710> actually

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
good quality flashlight it's actually

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.020 
good quality flashlight it's actually
very<00:00:45.750> bright<00:00:46.200> brighter<00:00:46.800> than<00:00:47.010> you<00:00:47.160> expect<00:00:47.730> and

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
very bright brighter than you expect and

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.930 
very bright brighter than you expect and
it<00:00:48.780> does<00:00:48.960> not<00:00:49.200> have<00:00:49.500> a<00:00:49.739> fake<00:00:50.070> solar<00:00:50.370> panel<00:00:50.820> the

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
it does not have a fake solar panel the

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.119 
it does not have a fake solar panel the
solar<00:00:51.149> panel<00:00:51.600> on<00:00:51.750> this<00:00:51.989> unit<00:00:52.350> is<00:00:52.530> actually

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
solar panel on this unit is actually

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.529 
solar panel on this unit is actually
real<00:00:53.780> so<00:00:54.980> one<00:00:55.980> thing<00:00:56.309> I<00:00:56.640> like<00:00:56.969> about<00:00:57.000> it<00:00:57.420> it

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
real so one thing I like about it it

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.720 
real so one thing I like about it it
says<00:00:57.719> very<00:00:58.050> easy<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.559> take<00:00:58.739> apart<00:00:58.859> as<00:00:59.460> you<00:00:59.550> can

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
says very easy to take apart as you can

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.840 
says very easy to take apart as you can
see<00:01:00.079> I've<00:01:01.079> already<00:01:01.289> done<00:01:01.649> that<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:02.670> main

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
see I've already done that the main

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.030 
see I've already done that the main
reason<00:01:03.239> I<00:01:03.300> did<00:01:03.510> that<00:01:03.600> was<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:04.409> make<00:01:04.650> sure<00:01:04.920> that

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
reason I did that was to make sure that

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.070 
reason I did that was to make sure that
that<00:01:05.189> solar<00:01:05.519> panel<00:01:05.760> is<00:01:06.000> real<00:01:06.210> because<00:01:06.420> I've

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
that solar panel is real because I've

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.560 
that solar panel is real because I've
gotten<00:01:07.680> some<00:01:07.860> devices<00:01:08.220> you<00:01:09.090> know<00:01:09.210> from<00:01:09.450> the

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
gotten some devices you know from the

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.960 
gotten some devices you know from the
dollar<00:01:09.810> store<00:01:09.990> that<00:01:10.890> claim<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.400> have<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:11.610> solar

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
dollar store that claim to have a solar

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.030 
dollar store that claim to have a solar
panel<00:01:12.090> in<00:01:12.510> it<00:01:12.659> when<00:01:13.170> I<00:01:13.229> take<00:01:13.500> them<00:01:13.650> apart<00:01:13.710> like

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
panel in it when I take them apart like

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.450 
panel in it when I take them apart like
this<00:01:14.400> it's<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:14.939> piece<00:01:15.210> of<00:01:15.390> plastic<00:01:16.049> film<00:01:16.460> held

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
this it's a piece of plastic film held

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.910 
this it's a piece of plastic film held
in<00:01:17.700> by<00:01:17.909> tape<00:01:18.180> no<00:01:18.540> wires<00:01:18.810> going<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.290> it<00:01:19.439> no<00:01:19.680> wires

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
in by tape no wires going to it no wires

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.460 
in by tape no wires going to it no wires
coming<00:01:20.250> from<00:01:20.369> it<00:01:20.840> you<00:01:21.840> can<00:01:21.990> see<00:01:22.170> that<00:01:22.200> this

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
coming from it you can see that this

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.740 
coming from it you can see that this
solar<00:01:22.770> panel<00:01:23.220> is<00:01:23.400> actually<00:01:23.820> real<00:01:24.030> it's<00:01:24.360> a<00:01:24.420> real

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
solar panel is actually real it's a real

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.310 
solar panel is actually real it's a real
last<00:01:25.740> solar<00:01:26.070> panel<00:01:26.600> you<00:01:27.600> can<00:01:27.840> see<00:01:28.170> the

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
last solar panel you can see the

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.050 
last solar panel you can see the
positive<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.100> negative<00:01:29.400> leads<00:01:29.430> coming<00:01:29.939> from

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
positive and negative leads coming from

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.200 
positive and negative leads coming from
it<00:01:30.390> also<00:01:31.140> with<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.680> blocking<00:01:32.430> diode<00:01:32.729> that

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
it also with the blocking diode that

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.999 
it also with the blocking diode that
prevents<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.840> battery<00:01:34.259> from<00:01:34.409> discharging

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
prevents the battery from discharging

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.539 
prevents the battery from discharging
into<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.729> solar<00:01:35.970> panel<00:01:36.420> when<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.549> solar

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
into the solar panel when the solar

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:39.980 
into the solar panel when the solar
panel<00:01:38.880> doesn't<00:01:39.060> receive<00:01:39.390> light<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:39.869> it's

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
panel doesn't receive light and it's

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.020 
panel doesn't receive light and it's
very<00:01:40.049> important<00:01:40.880> has<00:01:41.880> a<00:01:43.340> 2032<00:01:44.340> that's<00:01:44.909> the

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
very important has a 2032 that's the

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.780 
very important has a 2032 that's the
model<00:01:45.240> number<00:01:45.630> for<00:01:45.780> this<00:01:45.899> lithium<00:01:46.790> battery

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
model number for this lithium battery

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.609 
model number for this lithium battery
this<00:01:48.149> is<00:01:48.240> a<00:01:48.360> pretty<00:01:48.600> common<00:01:48.840> watch<00:01:49.140> battery

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
this is a pretty common watch battery

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:50.660 
this is a pretty common watch battery
that<00:01:49.740> you<00:01:49.770> can<00:01:49.979> pick<00:01:50.130> up<00:01:50.159> pretty<00:01:50.490> much

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
that you can pick up pretty much

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.200 
that you can pick up pretty much
anywhere<00:01:51.470> actually<00:01:52.470> has<00:01:52.829> a<00:01:52.860> small<00:01:53.310> onboard

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
anywhere actually has a small onboard

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.340 
anywhere actually has a small onboard
computer<00:01:54.810> because<00:01:55.259> it<00:01:55.380> has<00:01:55.759> multi<00:01:56.759> functions

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
computer because it has multi functions

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.580 
computer because it has multi functions
first<00:01:58.350> just<00:01:58.890> standard<00:01:59.340> on<00:01:59.840> then<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:01.079> second

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
first just standard on then the second

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.880 
first just standard on then the second
mode<00:02:01.770> is<00:02:02.040> flash<00:02:02.960> and<00:02:03.960> that's<00:02:04.110> pretty<00:02:04.320> much<00:02:04.439> it

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
mode is flash and that's pretty much it
