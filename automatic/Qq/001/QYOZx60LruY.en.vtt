00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:09.389 
blood tests in the NFL and then they're

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:11.210 
blood tests in the NFL and then they're
saying<00:04:09.690> well<00:04:09.870> and<00:04:10.079> it<00:04:10.199> since<00:04:10.440> it's<00:04:10.590> natural

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
saying well and it since it's natural

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.220 
saying well and it since it's natural
it's<00:04:11.400> not<00:04:11.579> synthetic<00:04:12.030> it<00:04:12.599> shouldn't<00:04:13.199> really

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
it's not synthetic it shouldn't really

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.000 
it's not synthetic it shouldn't really
be<00:04:13.519> illegal<00:04:14.519> right<00:04:14.699> that's<00:04:15.449> the<00:04:15.569> question

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
be illegal right that's the question

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.860 
be illegal right that's the question
should<00:04:17.010> we<00:04:17.070> make<00:04:17.489> it<00:04:17.609> illegal<00:04:18.120> because<00:04:18.449> if<00:04:18.780> we

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
should we make it illegal because if we

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.170 
should we make it illegal because if we
do<00:04:19.079> you<00:04:19.799> can't<00:04:20.039> enforce<00:04:20.400> it<00:04:20.579> you<00:04:20.729> can't<00:04:20.940> detect

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
do you can't enforce it you can't detect

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.459 
do you can't enforce it you can't detect
the<00:04:21.359> can't<00:04:21.570> afford<00:04:21.750> there's<00:04:21.959> nothing<00:04:22.169> can<00:04:22.289> do

00:04:22.459 --> 00:04:22.469 
the can't afford there's nothing can do

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:23.750 
the can't afford there's nothing can do
about<00:04:22.560> it<00:04:22.710> so<00:04:22.890> I<00:04:22.919> don't<00:04:23.130> just<00:04:23.219> make<00:04:23.340> it<00:04:23.400> legal

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760

about it so I don't just make it legal
and<00:04:24.090> the<00:04:25.020> other<00:04:25.169> question<00:04:25.469> is<00:04:25.500> if<00:04:25.680> you<00:04:25.800> made<00:04:25.919> it

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
and the other question is if you made it

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.410 
and the other question is if you made it
legal<00:04:26.159> so<00:04:26.669> what

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:27.420
