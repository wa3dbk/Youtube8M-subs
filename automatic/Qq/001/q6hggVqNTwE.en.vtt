00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.470
 I'll show you now how he does that 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:09.210
 you can change the brake light switch at 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:12.450
 audi a6 that's the good piece here 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:15.360
 the front is the contact, so to speak 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.090
 contact triggers must brake light too 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.039
 control etc 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:22.080
 and then how come a simple is 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.640
 once the fairing under steering wheel away 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.670
 gmbh is whistled away the it 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.750
 at three screws ours 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.210
 Ideas the disguise still 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.210
 under it she sits in one step 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.239
 here sits one and at 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.579
 the fuse box had to be 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.789
 Disguise once take away the here 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.789
 one more 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:52.110
 so you can do that I have this down now 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.050
 pedal part still taken away with that 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.390
 once again with the pedal engaged 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.340
 Part itself and it is here coat 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.649
 consolidates it could also with me 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.370
 I took it away 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:04.159
 at the same time a bit 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.420
 cleaned and prepared 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.189
 if you say goodbye he must 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:16.090
 pay attention that it snapped up here 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:18.439
 it would have to move away carefully 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.560
 sometimes with a bit of violence though 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:23.119
 just as I said very careful with it 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.960
 Do not break like that if you do that so far 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:29.960
 have come down in principle already around 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.960
 Although I go sometimes very down and 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:37.280
 we'll see you already 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:45.979
 brake switch and that is what I have here 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:50.479
 ever that karl solved here stronger 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:51.890
 from the remscheider here settled the 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:02:08.979
 to solve only really after 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:02:11.120
 turn left old original brake disc 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.420
 put the cautiously so again 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.690
 zoom in on the new and contact 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.690
 below 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:32.370
 and so in again 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:34.790
 the quasi that up here is the contact 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:45.900
 back down here 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:50.450
 the two new I have now from the 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:52.319
 Accessories trade cost around seven euros 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:03:02.220
 because then just so clean again 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:03:04.140
 plugged in and then plugged into the usa 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:09.329
 is therefore again with the rotation 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:11.790
 right made so far to the right 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:14.329
 the coach a guest is stronger again 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:21.170
 on it disguise again 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:21.170
