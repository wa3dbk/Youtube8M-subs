00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.880 
got some more pedal videos for you today
we're<00:00:17.730> looking<00:00:17.880> at<00:00:18.119> the<00:00:18.270> new<00:00:18.480> line<00:00:19.110> of<00:00:19.380> zvex

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
we're looking at the new line of zvex

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.529 
we're looking at the new line of zvex
pedals<00:00:20.220> and<00:00:20.400> we've<00:00:20.580> got<00:00:20.790> the<00:00:21.000> little<00:00:21.150> fuzzy

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
pedals and we've got the little fuzzy

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.540 
pedals and we've got the little fuzzy
low<00:00:21.720> so<00:00:22.140> this<00:00:22.289> is<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.500> first<00:00:22.740> time<00:00:23.010> that<00:00:23.189> zvex

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
low so this is the first time that zvex

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.849 
low so this is the first time that zvex
have<00:00:23.760> kind<00:00:23.970> of<00:00:24.060> gone<00:00:24.269> into<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.900> micro<00:00:25.590> series

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
have kind of gone into the micro series

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.300 
have kind of gone into the micro series
of<00:00:26.189> all<00:00:27.119> their<00:00:27.330> USA<00:00:27.720> pedals<00:00:28.080> now<00:00:28.650> this<00:00:28.859> is<00:00:29.070> a

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
of all their USA pedals now this is a

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.359 
of all their USA pedals now this is a
similar<00:00:29.910> take<00:00:30.150> on<00:00:30.359> their<00:00:30.750> master<00:00:31.230> Tron<00:00:31.500> fuzz

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
similar take on their master Tron fuzz

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.430 
similar take on their master Tron fuzz
which<00:00:32.790> comes<00:00:33.059> in<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.300> bigger<00:00:33.510> blue<00:00:33.989> vex<00:00:34.290> two

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
which comes in the bigger blue vex two

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.590 
which comes in the bigger blue vex two
series<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:35.089> it's<00:00:36.089> kind<00:00:36.300> of<00:00:36.390> like<00:00:36.570> a

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
series and it's kind of like a

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.030 
series and it's kind of like a
miniaturized<00:00:37.050> version<00:00:37.290> of<00:00:37.710> that<00:00:37.860> it's<00:00:37.980> a

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
miniaturized version of that it's a

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.360 
miniaturized version of that it's a
really<00:00:38.760> powerful<00:00:38.940> silicon<00:00:39.629> fuzz<00:00:39.870> and

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
really powerful silicon fuzz and

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.150 
really powerful silicon fuzz and
effectively<00:00:41.370> your<00:00:41.520> controls<00:00:41.940> are<00:00:42.149> volume<00:00:42.719> and

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 
effectively your controls are volume and

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.040 
effectively your controls are volume and
quite<00:00:44.160> audibly<00:00:44.370> pulse-width<00:00:45.120> so<00:00:45.660> it's<00:00:45.809> not

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
quite audibly pulse-width so it's not

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.810 
quite audibly pulse-width so it's not
necessarily<00:00:46.680> like<00:00:46.800> a<00:00:46.860> fuzz<00:00:47.190> control<00:00:47.640> it

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
necessarily like a fuzz control it

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.439 
necessarily like a fuzz control it
controls<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.739> wave<00:00:49.739> shape<00:00:50.250> of<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.969> of<00:00:51.270> the

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
controls the wave shape of the of the

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:52.910 
controls the wave shape of the of the
fuzz<00:00:51.660> so<00:00:51.840> you<00:00:51.930> can<00:00:52.050> go<00:00:52.170> everything<00:00:52.530> from<00:00:52.739> kind

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
fuzz so you can go everything from kind

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.400 
fuzz so you can go everything from kind
of<00:00:53.190> really<00:00:53.850> fat<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.120> really<00:00:54.570> full<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:55.050> kind<00:00:55.260> of

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
of really fat and really full to kind of

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.670 
of really fat and really full to kind of
that<00:00:55.590> velcro<00:00:55.920> clicky<00:00:56.670> chiptune<00:00:57.600> style<00:00:58.379> fuzz

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
that velcro clicky chiptune style fuzz

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.270 
that velcro clicky chiptune style fuzz
she<00:00:59.609> also<00:00:59.760> got<00:00:59.940> like<00:01:00.149> an<00:01:00.270> inbuilt<00:01:00.570> noise<00:01:00.750> gate

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
she also got like an inbuilt noise gate

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.880 
she also got like an inbuilt noise gate
so<00:01:02.280> you<00:01:02.309> get<00:01:02.579> this<00:01:02.670> kind<00:01:02.940> of<00:01:03.030> like<00:01:03.890> it'll

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
so you get this kind of like it'll

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.590 
so you get this kind of like it'll
almost<00:01:05.009> tail<00:01:05.430> off<00:01:05.640> when<00:01:05.880> you<00:01:05.970> reach<00:01:06.300> a<00:01:06.450> certain

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
almost tail off when you reach a certain

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.090 
almost tail off when you reach a certain
point<00:01:06.750> so<00:01:07.080> it's<00:01:07.229> kind<00:01:07.410> of<00:01:07.470> nice<00:01:07.619> for<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:07.979> lead

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
point so it's kind of nice for the lead

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.219 
point so it's kind of nice for the lead
work<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:08.580> stuff<00:01:08.729> like<00:01:08.820> that<00:01:08.970> so<00:01:09.000> it<00:01:09.810> kind<00:01:10.020> of

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
work and stuff like that so it kind of

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.230 
work and stuff like that so it kind of
tails<00:01:10.860> back<00:01:11.220> some<00:01:11.520> of<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.670> aggression<00:01:11.910> so<00:01:12.149> you

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
tails back some of the aggression so you

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.730 
tails back some of the aggression so you
get<00:01:12.390> something<00:01:12.660> that's<00:01:12.720> very<00:01:12.990> very<00:01:13.080> usable

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
get something that's very very usable

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.169 
get something that's very very usable
and<00:01:13.920> as<00:01:14.250> some<00:01:14.459> people<00:01:14.580> have<00:01:14.789> always<00:01:14.910> said<00:01:15.000> all

00:01:15.169 --> 00:01:15.179 
and as some people have always said all

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:16.550 
and as some people have always said all
the<00:01:15.390> fuzz<00:01:15.539> factory<00:01:15.690> is<00:01:15.929> great<00:01:16.110> but<00:01:16.259> it<00:01:16.380> does

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
the fuzz factory is great but it does

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.589 
the fuzz factory is great but it does
something<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.890> little<00:01:17.099> bit<00:01:17.220> too<00:01:17.580> crazy<00:01:17.880> this<00:01:18.539> is

00:01:18.589 --> 00:01:18.599 
something a little bit too crazy this is

00:01:18.599 --> 00:01:20.359 
something a little bit too crazy this is
kind<00:01:18.929> of<00:01:18.990> like<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.200> miniaturized<00:01:19.590> version<00:01:19.830> of

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
kind of like a miniaturized version of

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:21.980 
kind of like a miniaturized version of
all<00:01:20.520> of<00:01:20.550> the<00:01:20.849> best<00:01:21.179> parts<00:01:21.539> of<00:01:21.660> all<00:01:21.750> of<00:01:21.869> their

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
all of the best parts of all of their

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.460 
all of the best parts of all of their
fathers

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
fathers

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.210 
fathers
so<00:01:22.920> no<00:01:23.729> battery<00:01:24.090> power<00:01:24.360> it's<00:01:24.929> just<00:01:25.200> maimed<00:01:25.470> it

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
so no battery power it's just maimed it

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.740 
so no battery power it's just maimed it
will<00:01:26.369> work<00:01:26.550> on<00:01:26.759> active<00:01:27.090> as<00:01:27.240> well<00:01:27.390> as<00:01:27.539> a<00:01:27.569> little

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
will work on active as well as a little

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:28.999 
will work on active as well as a little
jumper<00:01:28.110> lead<00:01:28.259> that<00:01:28.410> you<00:01:28.500> can<00:01:28.619> turn<00:01:28.709> so<00:01:28.830> you've

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
jumper lead that you can turn so you've

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.290 
jumper lead that you can turn so you've
got<00:01:29.130> active<00:01:29.399> pickups<00:01:29.670> or<00:01:29.819> an<00:01:29.910> active<00:01:30.149> base

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:30.300 
got active pickups or an active base

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.600 
got active pickups or an active base
it'll<00:01:30.569> work<00:01:30.720> as<00:01:30.929> well<00:01:31.130> built<00:01:32.130> in<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.310> u.s.<00:01:32.490> a

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
it'll work as well built in the u.s. a

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.959 
it'll work as well built in the u.s. a
great<00:01:33.209> unit<00:01:33.509> nice<00:01:33.690> pocket
