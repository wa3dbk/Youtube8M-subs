start<00:00:45.210> programming<00:00:45.899> your<00:00:46.019> robot<00:00:46.409> your<00:00:46.949> robot

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
start programming your robot your robot

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.099 
start programming your robot your robot
will<00:00:47.489> react<00:00:47.850> or<00:00:48.120> intelligently<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:48.839> the

00:00:49.099 --> 00:00:49.109 
will react or intelligently to the

will react or intelligently to the
environment<00:00:49.589> around<00:00:49.679> it<00:00:50.420> and<00:00:51.420> you're<00:00:51.570> gonna

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:51.659 
environment around it and you're gonna

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:55.520 
environment around it and you're gonna
attach<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.199> ultrasonic<00:00:52.829> sensor<00:00:54.229> what<00:00:55.229> I<00:00:55.260> like

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
attach the ultrasonic sensor what I like

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.770 
attach the ultrasonic sensor what I like
about<00:00:55.710> using<00:00:56.250> eb-3<00:00:56.909> in<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.089> classroom<00:00:57.600> is

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
about using eb-3 in the classroom is

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.840 
about using eb-3 in the classroom is
that<00:00:58.140> it's<00:00:58.439> kind<00:00:59.159> of<00:00:59.219> like<00:00:59.280> instant

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
that it's kind of like instant

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.029 
that it's kind of like instant
engagement<00:00:59.969> or<00:01:00.570> engagement<00:01:00.869> in<00:01:01.140> a<00:01:01.199> box<00:01:01.409> I<00:01:01.769> can

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
engagement or engagement in a box I can

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.799 
engagement or engagement in a box I can
introduce<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.640> lesson<00:01:02.820> but<00:01:03.149> beyond<00:01:03.479> that<00:01:03.570> the

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
introduce the lesson but beyond that the

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.899 
introduce the lesson but beyond that the
students<00:01:04.259> can<00:01:04.860> work<00:01:04.979> very<00:01:05.039> much<00:01:05.309> on<00:01:05.610> their<00:01:05.759> own

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
students can work very much on their own

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.990 
students can work very much on their own
set<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.659> right<00:01:06.750> one<00:01:07.100> that<00:01:08.100> is<00:01:08.340> so<00:01:08.819> you're

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
set the right one that is so you're

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.609 
set the right one that is so you're
going<00:01:09.179> backwards<00:01:09.390> instead<00:01:09.750> of<00:01:09.899> forwards<00:01:09.990> it's

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
going backwards instead of forwards it's

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.880 
going backwards instead of forwards it's
not<00:01:10.770> going<00:01:10.979> forward<00:01:11.460> here<00:01:11.700> I<00:01:12.000> can<00:01:12.780> either<00:01:12.929> need

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
not going forward here I can either need

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.100 
not going forward here I can either need
to<00:01:14.039> recalibrate<00:01:14.399> it<00:01:14.729> so<00:01:14.880> that<00:01:15.030> is<00:01:15.209> so<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:15.990> up

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
to recalibrate it so that is so the up

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:25.279 
to recalibrate it so that is so the up
position<00:01:16.289> zero<00:01:16.920> oh<00:01:17.280> good<00:01:18.060> yep<00:01:23.330> yes<00:01:24.330> Eevee

00:01:25.279 --> 00:01:25.289 
position zero oh good yep yes Eevee

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:27.109 
position zero oh good yep yes Eevee
three<00:01:25.590> makes<00:01:25.890> learning<00:01:26.069> easier<00:01:26.429> for<00:01:27.000> me

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
three makes learning easier for me

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.930 
three makes learning easier for me
because<00:01:27.539> it's<00:01:27.899> really<00:01:28.170> easy<00:01:28.470> to<00:01:28.590> follow

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:28.940 
because it's really easy to follow

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.309 
because it's really easy to follow
you're<00:01:29.940> actually<00:01:30.330> building<00:01:30.780> what<00:01:31.020> you<00:01:31.110> want

00:01:31.309 --> 00:01:31.319 
you're actually building what you want

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:33.139 
you're actually building what you want
to<00:01:31.409> build<00:01:31.590> hands<00:01:32.190> on<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.670> you<00:01:32.940> get<00:01:33.119> a

00:01:33.139 --> 00:01:33.149 
to build hands on and you get a

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:35.300 
to build hands on and you get a
immediately<00:01:33.509> see<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.590> results<00:01:35.039> of<00:01:35.159> your

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
immediately see the results of your

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:41.470 
immediately see the results of your
project<00:01:35.729> in<00:01:35.909> real<00:01:36.090> time

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:41.480 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.350 

what<00:01:42.170> I<00:01:42.200> like<00:01:42.470> about<00:01:42.620> the<00:01:42.920> ev3<00:01:43.280> curriculum<00:01:44.180> is

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
what I like about the ev3 curriculum is

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.690 
what I like about the ev3 curriculum is
that<00:01:44.420> teachers<00:01:45.380> can<00:01:45.650> open<00:01:45.920> it<00:01:46.010> up<00:01:46.130> and<00:01:46.370> use<00:01:46.520> it

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
that teachers can open it up and use it

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.970 
that teachers can open it up and use it
right<00:01:46.820> away<00:01:46.970> and<00:01:47.270> know<00:01:47.450> that<00:01:47.690> it<00:01:48.500> addresses

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:48.980 
right away and know that it addresses

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.100 
right away and know that it addresses
math<00:01:49.610> and<00:01:49.910> science<00:01:50.300> as<00:01:50.450> well<00:01:50.720> as<00:01:50.870> some

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
math and science as well as some

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.650 
math and science as well as some
literacy<00:01:51.440> it<00:01:52.250> is<00:01:52.460> a<00:01:52.490> great<00:01:52.910> tool<00:01:53.090> for<00:01:53.150> teaching

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:53.660 
literacy it is a great tool for teaching

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.080 
literacy it is a great tool for teaching
the<00:01:53.960> 21st<00:01:54.470> century<00:01:54.830> skills<00:01:55.130> so<00:01:55.760> it<00:01:55.940> is

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
the 21st century skills so it is

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.460 
the 21st century skills so it is
definitely<00:01:56.270> getting<00:01:56.660> them<00:01:56.930> prepared<00:01:57.260> for<00:01:57.320> the

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
definitely getting them prepared for the

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.260 
definitely getting them prepared for the
future

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.370 

so<00:02:02.270> today<00:02:02.540> we're<00:02:02.690> going<00:02:02.810> to<00:02:02.870> explore<00:02:03.200> its

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
so today we're going to explore its

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.590 
so today we're going to explore its
recent<00:02:03.710> areas<00:02:04.030> we're<00:02:05.030> going<00:02:05.150> to<00:02:05.210> explore<00:02:05.450> the

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
recent areas we're going to explore the

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.540 
recent areas we're going to explore the
temperature<00:02:06.110> of<00:02:06.260> water<00:02:06.500> coming<00:02:07.340> out<00:02:07.430> of<00:02:07.490> the

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
temperature of water coming out of the

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.310 
temperature of water coming out of the
tap<00:02:07.730> we're<00:02:08.600> going<00:02:08.720> explore<00:02:08.930> the<00:02:09.020> temperature

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:09.320 
tap we're going explore the temperature

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.220 
tap we're going explore the temperature
of<00:02:09.440> water<00:02:09.590> with<00:02:10.550> ice<00:02:10.730> in<00:02:10.940> it<00:02:11.030> and<00:02:11.210> then<00:02:11.900> finally

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
of water with ice in it and then finally

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:13.630 
of water with ice in it and then finally
we're<00:02:12.470> going<00:02:12.500> to<00:02:12.620> explore<00:02:12.980> the<00:02:13.160> temperature

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
we're going to explore the temperature

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.290 
we're going to explore the temperature
of<00:02:13.730> water<00:02:13.940> if<00:02:14.390> I've<00:02:15.110> added<00:02:15.440> some<00:02:15.830> salt<00:02:16.190> to<00:02:17.150> the

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
of water if I've added some salt to the

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.780 
of water if I've added some salt to the
ice<00:02:17.450> so<00:02:18.170> we<00:02:18.290> want<00:02:18.470> you<00:02:18.620> guys<00:02:18.650> to<00:02:19.160> use<00:02:19.430> the

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
ice so we want you guys to use the

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.760 
ice so we want you guys to use the
software<00:02:20.150> tool<00:02:20.420> to<00:02:20.780> predict<00:02:21.200> and<00:02:21.380> you're

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
software tool to predict and you're

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.800 
software tool to predict and you're
going<00:02:21.890> to<00:02:21.920> analyze<00:02:22.310> to<00:02:22.340> compare<00:02:23.060> how<00:02:23.540> close

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
going to analyze to compare how close

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:29.590 
going to analyze to compare how close
was<00:02:23.960> your<00:02:24.140> prediction<00:02:24.640> okay<00:02:27.970> when<00:02:28.970> we<00:02:29.150> use<00:02:29.330> the

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
was your prediction okay when we use the

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.530 
was your prediction okay when we use the
data<00:02:30.140> logging<00:02:30.440> we<00:02:31.250> can<00:02:31.520> collect<00:02:31.820> data<00:02:31.880> at<00:02:32.240> five

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
data logging we can collect data at five

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.690 
data logging we can collect data at five
samples<00:02:33.050> per<00:02:33.170> second<00:02:33.590> you<00:02:33.980> can't<00:02:34.280> do<00:02:34.550> that

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
samples per second you can't do that

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.940 
samples per second you can't do that
with<00:02:34.880> a<00:02:34.910> regular<00:02:35.090> thermometer<00:02:35.780> in<00:02:36.110> addition

the students are comparing their

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.500 
the students are comparing their
prediction<00:02:40.250> with<00:02:41.150> what's<00:02:41.330> actually

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510

happening as it's happening right here
at<00:02:44.240> about<00:02:44.630> ninety<00:02:44.990> five<00:02:45.140> seconds<00:02:45.740> at<00:02:46.040> that

at about ninety five seconds at that

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.340 
at about ninety five seconds at that
exact<00:02:46.910> moment<00:02:47.060> is<00:02:47.540> when<00:02:47.780> the<00:02:47.810> water<00:02:48.050> inside

exact moment is when the water inside

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.310 
exact moment is when the water inside
this<00:02:48.440> test<00:02:48.680> tube<00:02:48.860> just<00:02:49.040> started<00:02:49.340> freezing<00:02:49.550> Oh

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
this test tube just started freezing Oh

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.350 

one<00:03:03.560> of<00:03:03.680> the<00:03:03.769> advantages<00:03:04.250> of<00:03:04.310> ev3<00:03:04.879> is<00:03:05.030> the

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
one of the advantages of ev3 is the

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.759 
one of the advantages of ev3 is the
content<00:03:05.810> editor<00:03:05.959> and<00:03:06.379> the<00:03:06.470> fact<00:03:06.680> that

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
content editor and the fact that

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:09.309 
content editor and the fact that
students<00:03:07.250> can<00:03:07.519> save<00:03:07.760> their<00:03:07.970> work<00:03:08.150> right<00:03:08.840> into

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:09.319 
students can save their work right into

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:11.440 
students can save their work right into
the<00:03:09.440> workbook<00:03:09.800> when<00:03:10.730> they<00:03:10.910> want<00:03:11.120> to<00:03:11.180> go<00:03:11.269> back

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
the workbook when they want to go back

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.240 
the workbook when they want to go back
to<00:03:11.690> their<00:03:11.840> files<00:03:12.080> they<00:03:12.230> simply<00:03:12.709> open<00:03:13.040> it<00:03:13.129> up

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
to their files they simply open it up

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.369 
to their files they simply open it up
and<00:03:13.459> they<00:03:13.819> go<00:03:14.000> back<00:03:14.209> to<00:03:14.390> those<00:03:14.540> pages<00:03:14.810> they<00:03:15.200> can

00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:15.379 
and they go back to those pages they can

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:17.530 
and they go back to those pages they can
add<00:03:15.500> photographs<00:03:15.940> they<00:03:16.940> can<00:03:17.150> add<00:03:17.300> their

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
add photographs they can add their

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.330 
add photographs they can add their
drawings<00:03:18.019> and<00:03:18.290> it<00:03:18.500> makes<00:03:18.680> it<00:03:18.800> easy<00:03:19.040> for

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
drawings and it makes it easy for

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.009 
drawings and it makes it easy for
teachers<00:03:19.489> to<00:03:19.849> assess<00:03:20.209> and<00:03:20.450> track<00:03:20.810> their

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
teachers to assess and track their

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:25.509 
teachers to assess and track their
progress<00:03:22.599> the<00:03:23.599> teacher<00:03:23.870> can<00:03:24.500> add<00:03:24.709> content<00:03:25.340> in

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 
progress the teacher can add content in

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:27.430 
progress the teacher can add content in
this<00:03:25.730> case<00:03:25.970> I've<00:03:26.269> already<00:03:26.599> added<00:03:26.810> some<00:03:27.110> video

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
this case I've already added some video

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:28.839 
this case I've already added some video
and<00:03:27.650> subjects<00:03:28.040> so<00:03:28.280> now<00:03:28.400> I'm<00:03:28.489> going<00:03:28.640> to<00:03:28.700> add<00:03:28.819> a

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:28.849 
and subjects so now I'm going to add a

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:32.550 
and subjects so now I'm going to add a
picture<00:03:29.150> and<00:03:30.080> I<00:03:31.010> simply<00:03:31.400> find<00:03:31.790> the<00:03:31.910> photograph

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
picture and I simply find the photograph

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.380 
picture and I simply find the photograph
tap<00:03:33.560> open<00:03:34.010> and<00:03:34.400> there<00:03:34.610> it<00:03:34.700> isn't<00:03:34.819> a<00:03:34.970> software

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
tap open and there it isn't a software

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:42.670 
tap open and there it isn't a software
it's<00:03:35.540> easy

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.789 

one<00:03:43.400> of<00:03:43.489> the<00:03:43.549> key<00:03:44.170> aspects<00:03:45.170> of<00:03:45.230> the<00:03:45.349> ev3<00:03:45.590> is

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:45.799 
one of the key aspects of the ev3 is

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:47.949 
one of the key aspects of the ev3 is
students<00:03:46.640> are<00:03:46.730> excited<00:03:47.060> to<00:03:47.150> use<00:03:47.269> it<00:03:47.450> and<00:03:47.599> we

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
students are excited to use it and we

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:49.509 
students are excited to use it and we
know<00:03:48.140> when<00:03:48.439> students<00:03:48.829> are<00:03:48.980> excited<00:03:49.280> about

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 
know when students are excited about

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:50.649 
know when students are excited about
learning<00:03:49.700> they're<00:03:50.180> paying<00:03:50.450> more<00:03:50.629> attention

00:03:50.649 --> 00:03:50.659 
learning they're paying more attention

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:52.899 
learning they're paying more attention
they're<00:03:51.620> coming<00:03:51.950> up<00:03:52.010> with<00:03:52.069> their<00:03:52.310> own<00:03:52.340> ideas

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:52.909 
they're coming up with their own ideas

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:55.179 
they're coming up with their own ideas
that<00:03:53.720> again<00:03:53.959> keeps<00:03:54.290> the<00:03:54.470> engagement<00:03:54.890> factor

00:03:55.179 --> 00:03:55.189 
that again keeps the engagement factor

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:57.309 
that again keeps the engagement factor
high<00:03:55.370> because<00:03:55.640> they<00:03:55.909> own<00:03:56.239> those<00:03:56.540> ideas<00:03:57.079> and

00:03:57.309 --> 00:03:57.319 
high because they own those ideas and

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:59.349 
high because they own those ideas and
they<00:03:57.650> get<00:03:57.799> an<00:03:57.890> opportunity<00:03:58.189> to<00:03:58.730> explore<00:03:59.180> their

00:03:59.349 --> 00:03:59.359 
they get an opportunity to explore their

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:15.120 
they get an opportunity to explore their
own<00:03:59.390> ideas

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.130 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.160 

Oh
