s4<00:00:14.759> I<00:00:15.269> really<00:00:16.230> wanted<00:00:16.410> to<00:00:16.470> address<00:00:16.770> them

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
s4 I really wanted to address them

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.200 
s4 I really wanted to address them
because<00:00:17.250> there<00:00:17.609> seems<00:00:17.789> to<00:00:17.850> be<00:00:17.940> a<00:00:17.970> bit<00:00:18.119> of

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
because there seems to be a bit of

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.060 
because there seems to be a bit of
confusion<00:00:18.510> as<00:00:18.750> to<00:00:18.779> where<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.260> problem<00:00:19.470> lies

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070

kind<00:00:35.399> of<00:00:35.550> speeds<00:00:35.850> or<00:00:36.630> Gigabit<00:00:37.079> speech<00:00:37.320> let's

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
kind of speeds or Gigabit speech let's

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.220 
kind of speeds or Gigabit speech let's
say<00:00:37.829> which<00:00:38.610> is<00:00:38.820> roughly<00:00:39.149> comparable<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.989> what

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
say which is roughly comparable to what

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.810 
say which is roughly comparable to what
you<00:00:40.350> would<00:00:40.410> get<00:00:40.590> over<00:00:40.950> a<00:00:41.219> Gigabit<00:00:41.760> Ethernet

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
you would get over a Gigabit Ethernet

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.360 
you would get over a Gigabit Ethernet
cable<00:00:42.800> obviously<00:00:43.800> there's<00:00:43.950> a<00:00:44.010> few<00:00:44.190> things

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370

there<00:00:44.550> that<00:00:44.730> can<00:00:45.059> get<00:00:45.239> in<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.390> way<00:00:45.629> there

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
there that can get in the way there

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.810 
there that can get in the way there
things<00:00:46.289> like<00:00:46.379> interference<00:00:46.860> etc<00:00:47.489> but

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
things like interference etc but

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.880 
things like interference etc but
crucially<00:00:48.809> where<00:00:49.020> we're<00:00:49.200> seeing<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.530> problem

access points the problem seems to stem

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.290 
access points the problem seems to stem
from<00:00:57.020> the<00:00:58.020> fact<00:00:58.230> that<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.980> access<00:00:59.820> points<00:01:00.210> and

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
from the fact that the access points and

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.250 
from the fact that the access points and
