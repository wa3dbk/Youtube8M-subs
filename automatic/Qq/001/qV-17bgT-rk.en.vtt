00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:05.040
To celebrate Frozen Fever, let’s take a
look at 15 things you probably didn’t know

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.340
about Disney’s Frozen Fever, the short sequel
to Frozen.

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:15.280
The enormous success of Frozen overwhelmed
directors Jennifer Lee and Chris Buck and

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.750
made them nervous about returning to make
this mini movie because they knew just how

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.260
much people care about Frozen’s characters.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:29.050
When the filmmakers started thinking of stories
to tell in a Frozen-themed short film, many

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.050
of their early ideas focused on everyone’s
favourite snowman, Olaf!

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.980
However, they soon decided to turn their attention
to Elsa and Anna instead.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.379
And it was head story artist Marc Smith who
came up with the concept of Elsa having a

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:42.659
cold!

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:47.999
Originally, the filmmakers’ idea for the
short was to have Elsa’s cold causing lots

00:00:47.999 --> 00:00:51.679
of havoc in Arendelle.
But then they decided to make the situation

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:55.069
more humorous and show a more fun side to
Elsa.

00:00:55.069 --> 00:01:00.440
Frozen Fever takes place a few months after
the last time we saw Elsa and the gang in

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.920
Frozen. And now it’s Anna’s 19th birthday!

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.890
In Frozen Fever, Elsa leads Anna on a scavenger
hunt for her birthday gifts which are connected

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.219
with a long piece of coloured string and left
in various parts of their home and Arendelle.

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:18.590
The inspiration for that part of the story
came from Frozen Fever director Chris Buck’s

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.920
own life.
One Easter, he gave each of his sons a different

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.770
colour string and they had to follow their
own string through the house to find their

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:26.909
Easter basket!

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.500
Anna and Elsa’s roles are reversed in Frozen
Fever.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.250
In Frozen we saw Anna try to wake up her sister
Elsa so they could spend time together and

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.259
build a snowman.
But, in Frozen Fever, it’s Elsa who tries

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:42.909
to wake Anna up so they can celebrate Anna’s
birthday!

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:48.320
According to Frozen Fever’s directors, the
inspiration for the family portrait seen in

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.979
the film’s castle was the website AwkwardFamilyPhotos.com.

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:59.129
The little snowmen or snow-babies that Elsa
creates whenever she sneezes are called Snowgies

00:01:59.129 --> 00:02:03.840
– so I guess they’re like bogeys made
out of snow!

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.550
Frozen’s art director playfully said that
when Elsa creates her dress during the song

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.490
Let It Go, the design of her new costume isn’t
properly highlighted because of the way the

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:18.170
camera looks down on Elsa from above.
So, for Frozen Fever, the filmmakers made

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.140
sure we get a really good look at Elsa’s
emerald green dress by filming in front of

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.720
her, rather than from above!

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.690
After stores sold out so quickly of Elsa and
Anna’s Frozen dresses, the filmmakers didn’t

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.400
want that to happen again with Frozen Fever!
So, they made sure the design of the sisters’

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.300
clothes was fixed early on in the animation
process.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.650
Frozen Fever was first shown in front of Disney’s
new live-action Cinderella.

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.950
And Cinderella just happens to be the very
first Disney film that Frozen Fever director

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.990
Jennifer Lee saw when she was little girl.

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:57.980
Frozen Fever features a brand new, original
song called Making Today A Perfect Day.

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.840
It was written especially for the short film
by Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez,

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.520
the husband-and-wife song-writing team behind
Frozen’s mega hits.

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:11.870
They wanted the song’s sunny feel to contrast
with the fact Elsa has caught a cold.

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.860
There’s a lovely lyrical Easter Egg in the
new short, which we hear after Anna expresses

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.340
her concern that Elsa has a cold.
Elsa tells her sister not to worry as she

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.550
says, “a cold never bothered me anyway”.
The original line in Frozen is “the cold

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:30.660
never bothered me anyway.”
According to director Chris Buck, the idea

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.810
for this Easter Egg came about because quite
a few kids confuse “a” and “the” in

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.400
that line from the monster hit Let It Go.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:45.930
Frozen Fever is the second short sequel that
Walt Disney Animation Studios have made to

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.900
one of their animated features.
The first was Tangled Ever After, which was

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.980
a short sequel to the animated feature film,
Tangled.

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:00.120
To render their mini-movie, Frozen Fever’s
animators used the Hyperion software that

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.540
the tech team at Walt Disney Animation Studios
created for Big Hero 6.

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.840
Well there you have it, 15 things you probably
