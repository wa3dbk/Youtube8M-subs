00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:09.580
 2 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.240
 well it him everyone knows neg 

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.490
 case and we find ourselves today for 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.290
 a splendid match map really a 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.260
 maid plan says you'll see that you're 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:33.600
 press and the map shoes coster I think 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.100
 that I pronounce it well and like 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.900
 his name says it's a roller 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.890
 coaster 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.809
 then you will see several themes 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.090
 in this roller coaster with angry birds 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.260
 he's going to have king kong is rare jurassic 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.730
 park and then lots of other things too 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.430
 you will see there are two Länder that has 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.750
 been completely redone there is länder which 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.640
 has been completely redone its purpose not 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.530
 entirely but because they did 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.080
 it's just it's just amazing 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.059
 and so here you go you arrive 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.010
 here so it was organized by darling 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.979
 is built and that many of his 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.050
 friends so we will have a link on his 

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:05.519
 chain anyway below in everything 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.840
 the video so do not hesitate to go see 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.630
 his chain because frankly that's 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.600
 widely but then largely deserved seen 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.010
 the work that has been done here is 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.840
 just amazing 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.340
 so so you get here then you 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.170
 sometimes arrive a little bit on the side 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.290
 there so do not hesitate to put in 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.540
 creative and fly away to come back here 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.350
 because ben me many times failed 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.510
 repeatedly even whenever 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.010
 it almost happened to me to land in 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.680
 outside the area of ​​the spawn zone 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.300
 that they have planned so well it's not 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.610
 super convenient and so will have to come 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.200
 here to make a small roller coaster 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.030
 also could be visited if a 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.860
 little bit the corner here it's a bit like 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.810
 a movie theater you have stands 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.320
 by the way it's a bit like they're calling 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.090
 that a 3d rollercoaster movie I think 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.060
 that's the name they give 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.130
 to their maps and so that's it 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.720
 really on the theme of cinema that you 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.280
 go explore this will be their clusters 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.850
 and so suddenly you arrive as if 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.440
 it was a funny cinema where you have 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.000
 so fresh drinks buy some 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.280
 sweets coughed coughed 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.110
 there you talked about snack drinks 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.860
 to nibble a little bit short 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.210
 here you have a little bit of all this 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.890
 and to go on the roller coaster 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:12.790
 we will have to go through here then me 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.930
 it does not work when I press the 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.940
 button I do not know I may be a 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.020
 bad handling so well listen to me I 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.030
 just break your fast for 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.290
 to be able to pass the roller coaster 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.640
 find there we'll go see that all of 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.140
 after that I just wanted you 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.530
 show other little things they have 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.450
 done before so far it was there or 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.860
 no no there it is to take 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.090
 drinks see we can even take there 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.010
 we absolutely adore that it's up to us 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.740
 above 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:39.250
 it was a sign 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:40.390
 I had gone to see this then 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.970
 wait I search because I 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.390
 just now and there I do not 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.390
 find more 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:51.870
 when I can exist by the bank 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:53.730
 where I had broken maybe here up 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.140
 so here I am broke here now I 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:59.459
 am I know more in good weather it was 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:02.760
 well over there I think I 'm 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:04.140
 completely silly so it's just there 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.430
 and there you have several rooms 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.049
 cinema in fact so you see that next 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.879
 from the stand the lampshade will show by the way 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:10.319
 and those next to the booth you have 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:13.799
 several movie theaters like that and 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:15.329
 when you put yourself on the plate of 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:17.519
 pressure that's right there oh well you 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:20.069
 have some kind of picture of movies that 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:21.209
 so there appears basseng angry birds and 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:23.940
 you have others like that you have 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:25.349
 jurassic park you have what I you 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.120
 I said earlier we will do the 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:31.049
 quick turn we will see all that there is 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.850
 jurassic park there is I am a plus 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:34.500
 young memory hole 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.640
 here is the jurassic park precisely 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.470
 so that I will not show you I 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.640
 wanted to go see him it's rather 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.870
 well done pretty nice little salary that 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.860
 I like pixel art more 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.390
 safe on minecraft 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.360
 I think it's one of the things 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.470
 minecraft simply does the best 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.490
 does not pack in low tele2 france there is 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.170
 was another I think it was 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:51.510
 also that of porto that I go to see 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:54.570
 because if not cleverly put more 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.830
 along two king kong but not here 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:57.360
 king kong it's more about rollerblading 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.550
 coaster so what are we gonna do 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.600
 take the roller coaster so I'm going 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:02.100
 not do it whole because 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:05.010
 honestly it's long it's really 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:07.680
 very long so it can be done at two 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.820
 so one day see a player 2 and the 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.520
 we'll read a little bit about the rules 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:13.800
 so the roller coaster race rolls the 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:17.610
 look in chains wool ken block 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:20.340
 enemies card you can not run attenuates 

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:21.989
 times and strong bring at least fruits 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.460
 map so there you do not understand anything 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:24.720
 or say why we will speak greece as 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.540
 I meant in French now 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.040
 then you can change side I 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.230
 think it should not be what it wants 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.890
 say you can not block the 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:36.060
 cards of your companions of your enemies 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:38.160
 who are going to make this trip is with you 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.430
 you can run to any 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.630
 moment 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.160
 so that is to say could leave 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.529
 together where one after another that it did not 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:46.139
 not important 

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:47.489
 you can finally minutes he could 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:49.379
 bring at least three cards 

00:04:47.489 --> 00:04:50.759
 so here I think I did not 

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:51.959
 deceived in the rules so in all 

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:53.159
 way it's pretty simple to that a 

00:04:51.959 --> 00:04:55.889
 roller coaster so that's just the 

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:57.299
 visit you go here so there you 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:05:00.149
 go ahead and you take a seat in your 

00:04:57.299 --> 00:05:02.579
 little cart right there you have 

00:05:00.149 --> 00:05:05.069
 launched using this button is there 

00:05:02.579 --> 00:05:06.299
 the roller coaster experience is gone and 

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:08.189
 which you will see scenery but 

00:05:06.299 --> 00:05:09.509
 totally totally crazy totally 

00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:11.459
 crazy what they realized true klein 

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:13.229
 already pit to take time from the 

00:05:11.459 --> 00:05:14.279
 realize all that but that's 

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:16.019
 frankly honestly it's that the 

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:17.939
 start that do it in full 

00:05:16.019 --> 00:05:19.139
 honestly it'll take you I think 

00:05:17.939 --> 00:05:21.629
 a couple of dozen 

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:23.519
 minutes I think maybe about 

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:24.929
 fifteen minutes but what are you going 

00:05:23.519 --> 00:05:26.219
 see finally here you have to take 

00:05:24.929 --> 00:05:27.629
 full-eyed cd built on 

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:28.709
 minecraft that are absolutely amazing 

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:30.319
 that what they have reproduced is 

00:05:28.709 --> 00:05:34.619
 absolutely amazing 

00:05:30.319 --> 00:05:35.609
 there is work we have in addition all the 

00:05:34.619 --> 00:05:38.639
 along the low path of small 

00:05:35.609 --> 00:05:40.199
 explosions there we have the little one 

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:41.759
 boat getting screwed by the weather 

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:43.109
 that I have behind there is an attack of 

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:44.369
 arrows just at chengdu I have not even 

00:05:43.109 --> 00:05:46.619
 the time to tell you what is 

00:05:44.369 --> 00:05:48.989
 pass that it's going rather quickly a rather 

00:05:46.619 --> 00:05:50.339
 pretty fast and so that's it going to be a 

00:05:48.989 --> 00:05:53.459
 little roller coaster like that you go 

00:05:50.339 --> 00:05:54.659
 visit at several places that are going 

00:05:53.459 --> 00:05:55.860
 to be both places of minecraft 

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:57.360
 but at the same time so many places 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:59.159
 of cinema apparently they are a lot 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.749
 inspired by cinema for this pure week 

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:01.249
 card for week because for this roller 

00:06:00.749 --> 00:06:03.089
 coaster 

00:06:01.249 --> 00:06:05.009
 and then it's more and it's frankly 

00:06:03.089 --> 00:06:06.049
 rather nice it's really a good 

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:08.399
 roller coaster 

00:06:06.049 --> 00:06:10.439
 So here I am, I do not have much 

00:06:08.399 --> 00:06:11.669
 tell you more after we will try 

00:06:10.439 --> 00:06:13.079
 to advance a little bit further 

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:15.169
 show you other constructions I 

00:06:13.079 --> 00:06:16.679
 went into a well not too far 

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:18.659
 but honestly 

00:06:16.679 --> 00:06:20.279
 for a long time in the world of 

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:21.659
 jurassic park dinosaurs seeing 

00:06:20.279 --> 00:06:23.459
 power of the dinosaurs far off one is 

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:25.259
 even passed just under a dinosaur there to 

00:06:23.459 --> 00:06:27.479
 that moment we have above us we have 

00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:29.129
 a little bit of everywhere here you go 

00:06:27.479 --> 00:06:30.029
 to have you go give it so much 

00:06:29.129 --> 00:06:31.739
 quickly that I know that as long as they are 

00:06:30.029 --> 00:06:33.809
 I look at it and you'll like this has 

00:06:31.739 --> 00:06:35.429
 crossed several worlds of cinema and 

00:06:33.809 --> 00:06:36.569
 there is a king kong art I do not think so 

00:06:35.429 --> 00:06:38.779
 we will see it on the video but who is 

00:06:36.569 --> 00:06:41.519
 right there in front which is absolutely 

00:06:38.779 --> 00:06:45.269
 gigantic is impressive it is 

00:06:41.519 --> 00:06:46.379
 totally crazy what they did so 

00:06:45.269 --> 00:06:47.339
 we listened to it I do not have much to 

00:06:46.379 --> 00:06:50.999
 tell you more if it's not 

00:06:47.339 --> 00:06:52.819
 download the map and from and do this 

00:06:50.999 --> 00:06:55.199
 roller coster that is totally 

00:06:52.819 --> 00:06:56.339
 incredible was listening to me I'm going to you 

00:06:55.199 --> 00:06:58.429
 leave it on me I will continue
