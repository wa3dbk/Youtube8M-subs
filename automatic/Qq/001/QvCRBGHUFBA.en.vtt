00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.990
 very good and welcome to a new 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.760
 video of the geek truck driver channel today 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.250
 let's see a box and in a little 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.080
 special is a mobile that does not 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:24.400
 we will find in Spain and it is the version 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:27.039
 of LG G2 but the Japanese version 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:32.419
 specifically this model is called isai 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:34.670
 lgl 22 and sai is the commercial brand that 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:37.270
 has the axis to sell their phones 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.270
 in Japan 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.460
 the box of this device as you can 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.160
 see is blue because this model 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.300
 specifically, the aqua model proposes 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.610
 up to the right of the box 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.739
 as we open the box we can see 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.660
 that up on the left puts av 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:57.699
 this is the name of the Japanese operator 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.699
 who markets this phone model 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:03.070
 Once the box is open, we see that 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:05.530
 only one that will come will be the telephone a 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.840
 instruction manual and ones 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.360
 headphones do not come neither charger nor 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.130
 usb cable if you remember well the sharp 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.710
 also came the headphones that 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:17.080
 bring are typical of lg here we have 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.430
 the terminal that is the same as lg 2 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.020
 but with some small differences 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.920
 what am I going to tell you 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.470
 continuation 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.770
 the first one is that the framework is 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.180
 metal instead of plastic 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.159
 this model does have buttons on the 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.760
 side volume buttons and 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:35.710
 lock and they are plastic 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.960
 up here we have the cap for 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.780
 expand storage of 32 gigs 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.310
 that already comes with microsd cards 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.190
 remember that axis 2 did not leave 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:48.070
 expand memory another difference that 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:50.530
 has this model with the normal axis 2 is 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.330
 that the back cover is removable and everything 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.940
 the frame is covered with a rubber band 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.890
 because it's water resistant that would be 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.410
 one of perhaps the biggest differences 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:02.200
 with respect to the normal axis 2 that this one does 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:04.960
 you can wet another difference that has 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:08.350
 is that it has nano sim instead of micro 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.869
 sim and everything that covers the 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.670
 Tray storage is done 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.700
 of rubber so that the card does not get wet 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.290
 without if we wet the phone the battery 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.870
 it has also changed but this time for the worse 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.870
 now it 's 2500 instead of 3000 mm 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.610
 but if the lid is still not removable 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.170
 is a plastic cap does not have any 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.640
 mystery and depends on the model that 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.010
 let's choose because it is a color or 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.260
 another in this case is this color of a 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.820
 bluish tone when we return it to 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.830
 fit yes it's true that the phone 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:38.110
 it feels very solid and does not creak by any 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.610
 side feels very good in the hand and also 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.130
 to the people when 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.140
 he likes it a lot 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.090
 the speaker has also changed now what 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.890
 where you have it on axis 3 the 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.630
 back of the top 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.330
 we have the camera that is the same as 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:55.750
 mount the 13-megapixel 2- axis with the 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:58.000
 flash and all that the front part down 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.740
 also puts the issa brand logo on 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.990
 place of heretic 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:04.510
 normal that we continue to have the double 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:06.460
 is to unlock and many of the 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.460
 roms that are for axis 2 are also 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:12.160
 compatible for this smartphone 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:16.450
 as we can see in the carrier we see that 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:18.819
 is compatible with the 4g of Spain ' 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.379
 as you can see below the icons 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:22.330
 they have the names in Spanish since 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:24.010
 brings the Spanish language among others 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.569
 many and if we press the menu button 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.340
 you can see that everything is also in 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:29.530
 Spanish 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.730
 Another important detail is that the 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.129
 updates work correctly 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.220
 since this model has been updated us 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:38.349
 several times since we are using it 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:42.489
 that yes for the moment is only in the 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:44.260
 442 lollipop has not yet arrived 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:46.030
 terminal comes with a theme that comes 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.709
 to the game with the casing so in color 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.680
 greenish but we can also change it 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:52.989
 from the settings otherwise we can 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.970
 say that it is quite similar to lg 2 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:57.989
 we lower the curtain notifications and it's 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.989
 everything quite similar 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.580
 we also can continue to do 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.770
 your direct to the blocking screen 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:08.560
 like the camera that by the way makes some 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:10.930
 very good photos as well as axis 2 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.120
 in short, a nice terminal 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:16.329
 elegant with the same functionalities 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:18.790
 that axis 2 even some more and for a 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:21.829
 price of about 220 euros that yes 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:24.080
 imported from Japan 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:25.550
 and up to here the review of this terminal 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.069
 if you liked the video 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:30.490
 share it subscribe and give it a like a 

00:04:28.069 --> 00:04:30.490
