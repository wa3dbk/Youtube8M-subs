00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.899 
allowed and I don't really like that not
a<00:01:45.509> very<00:01:45.780> good<00:01:45.960> firm<00:01:46.200> fit<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.460> other<00:01:47.610> thing

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
a very good firm fit and the other thing

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.050 
a very good firm fit and the other thing
is<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:49.110> velcro<00:01:49.649> there's<00:01:49.950> only<00:01:50.159> velcro<00:01:50.820> on

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
is the velcro there's only velcro on

these<00:01:51.180> two<00:01:51.479> loops<00:01:52.049> up<00:01:52.290> here<00:01:52.909> and<00:01:53.909> I<00:01:54.780> think<00:01:55.049> that

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
these two loops up here and I think that

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.830 
these two loops up here and I think that
two<00:01:55.530> loops<00:01:55.770> is<00:01:55.890> kind<00:01:56.100> of<00:01:56.189> too<00:01:56.430> many<00:01:56.719> this<00:01:57.719> would

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
two loops is kind of too many this would

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.420 
two loops is kind of too many this would
be<00:01:57.930> my<00:01:58.049> recommendation<00:01:58.710> I<00:01:58.829> do<00:01:58.890> sell<00:01:59.159> these<00:01:59.280> on

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
go to Walmart and get little buttons

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.110 
go to Walmart and get little buttons
they<00:02:37.740> just<00:02:38.010> sew<00:02:38.130> through<00:02:38.370> really<00:02:38.640> quick<00:02:38.850> right

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
they just sew through really quick right

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.300

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
there on the velcro and then you can

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.700 
there on the velcro and then you can
have<00:02:41.550> the<00:02:41.700> velcro<00:02:41.910> and<00:02:42.420> the<00:02:42.510> button<00:02:43.170> just<00:02:43.410> so

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
have the velcro and the button just so

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.350

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
it's more secure I'm not a big fan of

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.050 
it's more secure I'm not a big fan of
jessabelle<00:02:45.930> Crowe<00:02:46.170> and<00:02:47.100> I<00:02:47.250> probably<00:02:47.670> just<00:02:47.850> cut

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
jessabelle Crowe and I probably just cut

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
just cut that top loop off because it's

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:52.670 
just cut that top loop off because it's
kind<00:02:51.480> of<00:02:51.510> redundant<00:02:52.050> to<00:02:52.110> have<00:02:52.140> to<00:02:52.470> there's

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
kind of redundant to have to there's

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.560 
kind of redundant to have to there's
really<00:02:52.800> no<00:02:52.980> sense<00:02:53.220> of<00:02:53.340> it<00:02:53.430> but<00:02:53.700> I<00:02:53.910> mean<00:02:54.360> it'll

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
really no sense of it but I mean it'll

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.630

just<00:02:56.970> like<00:02:57.240> a<00:02:57.480> button<00:02:57.810> there<00:02:57.990> to<00:02:58.200> confirm<00:02:58.680> like

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
just like a button there to confirm like

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.620 
just like a button there to confirm like
the<00:02:59.160> security<00:02:59.730> of<00:02:59.760> that<00:03:00.120> knife<00:03:00.300> if<00:03:00.480> you<00:03:00.570> were

pretty good there man
that<00:06:34.889> I<00:06:35.130> didn't<00:06:35.940> expect<00:06:36.210> that<00:06:36.449> Wow<00:06:37.169> okay<00:06:38.069> so

00:06:38.089 --> 00:06:38.099 
that I didn't expect that Wow okay so

00:06:38.099 --> 00:06:40.460 
that I didn't expect that Wow okay so
the<00:06:38.759> balance<00:06:38.880> is<00:06:39.060> actually<00:06:39.210> pretty<00:06:39.599> good<00:06:39.750> it's

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:40.470 
the balance is actually pretty good it's

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:41.900 
the balance is actually pretty good it's
just<00:06:40.620> I<00:06:40.710> think<00:06:40.770> your<00:06:41.130> hand<00:06:41.370> is<00:06:41.460> kind<00:06:41.580> of<00:06:41.729> far

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:41.910 
just I think your hand is kind of far

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:44.059 
just I think your hand is kind of far
back<00:06:42.180> and<00:06:42.539> so<00:06:43.110> you<00:06:43.169> you<00:06:43.560> kind<00:06:43.830> of<00:06:43.860> have<00:06:43.979> the

00:06:44.059 --> 00:06:44.069 
back and so you you kind of have the

00:06:44.069 --> 00:06:45.320 
back and so you you kind of have the
tendency<00:06:44.460> to<00:06:44.490> just<00:06:44.759> kind<00:06:44.970> of<00:06:45.000> want<00:06:45.150> to<00:06:45.180> go
