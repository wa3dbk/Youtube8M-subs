00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:07.130
 hello I am santiago boots without birds 

00:00:03.609 --> 00:00:10.040
 We are a company dedicated to the control and 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:12.139
 professional settlement of birds in this 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:16.219
 opportunity I wanted to show you a 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:20.410
 plantation of plums 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:24.890
 has suffered a major damage 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:26.989
 thousands of parrots and calandrias that 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.119
 they have eaten all the fruit when they were missing 

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:32.210
 two days for the harvest is one 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:34.400
 very serious situation as I said you can 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.190
 notice you 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.410
 the damage 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:41.700
 What's in the fruit brings me closer 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:45.000
 little bit so you can see her bit 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.770
 pecked then well the insects 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.020
 they end up ruining it and this is no longer 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:56.940
 serves for nothing like this is this tree was 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:59.530
 a red ball this and many others makes 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.680
 23 days 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.449
 an oversight the weather was not conducive 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:08.950
 to make the harvest there was no staff 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:11.710
 available notice that it gives some some 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:15.850
 fruit but it will be 20 percent of the 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:19.649
 that there were and many of them like you 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:25.030
 showed attacked she is not the only 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:27.450
 to throw the floor full of fallen fruit 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:30.000
 Attacked by insects 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.799
 how can you solve this with a 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.299
 electronic scarecrow 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.299
 vergara and I'll show it now 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:41.970
 This is the smallest equipment covers 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:44.070
 6000 square meters or 60 meters of 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.860
 width from the emission that is the 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:50.790
 speaker 60 meters wide 100 meters 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:53.760
 of depth how this works 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.320
 plug-in device is fed to 12 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:59.409
 volts can be plugged 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:02.670
 has a cable quoted to a battery of 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:05.730
 auto this battery may or may not be 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.010
 recharged by a solar panel 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:10.680
 if you do not have must be 

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:13.370
 change it will have to have a game 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:16.260
 of batteries and replace it every 34 days 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:19.140
 If you can not plug directly into 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.810
 the network with a source lights up here 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.250
 has a series of 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.240
 I want to do that a little bit so that what 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:30.400
 go to S 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:34.590
 have here a commune switch was a 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:37.390
 button you're moving it to determine 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.760
 how much is the sound going? 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.940
 often if it's night-time or the 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.580
 24 hours to choose pre-recorded sounds 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.770
 in this case there are 8 you will have to choose 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:51.820
 some always the three sounds 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:55.150
 electronics and one of the birds of prey and 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:57.459
 this way you will be able to 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.819
 emitting these sounds that are sounds 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:04.120
 of raptors that attack the plague in 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:05.950
 question sounds of help request from 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.330
 the different species that's why you have to 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.970
 choose the sounds 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:15.250
 you tell us what is the problem of the 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:18.590
 old age 3 if it is calandria parrot pigeon 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:21.230
 this can become a sparrow 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:24.980
 finally change they change or the same for 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:29.240
 a sparrow that for a parrot or for 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:32.000
 a seabird can be a gull in short 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:33.440
 whatever it is they vary the sounds there 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.020
 electronic sounds and sounds of birds 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.910
 raptors and sounds of request help this 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:40.760
 It is turned on with a switch 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:42.940
 you can come back here you can regulate 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.940
 the volume 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.519
 and very loud sound 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.409
 we hear you are electronic sounds 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:01.049
 at the beginning for bird sounds 

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:04.650
 raptors tend to be hawks owls 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:08.180
 owls eagles 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:11.150
 in order more it is varying 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:13.730
 whenever you put a bird of prey no more than 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:17.090
 one by you see because in general when the 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:19.910
 raptor controls a zone that does not coexist 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:22.430
 other then it would be unnatural the 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:25.090
 the birds realize and suspect 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:27.610
 that is not real 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:32.770
 these sounds 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:35.259
 in blocks of 4 out of 5 out of 8 it varies 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:37.469
 reproduce at random or that is the 

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:40.150
 order is not always the same there 

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:43.210
 silences that also vary but within 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:45.129
 of a range you can not for example this 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:49.449
 is the shorter range than for example 

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:51.729
 between 30/15 seconds to one minute will 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:55.270
 varying that silence the middle range 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:59.349
 we are in two minutes to five minutes and 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:02.949
 in the longest silence range 

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:05.080
 It reaches 10 minutes silence but 

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:08.650
 it varies, the order is never the same 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:11.439
 different and if you also vary the 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:14.120
 raptor sounds for example once 

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:16.400
 every week 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:18.560
 you were doing that little job this 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:21.290
 tool is super useful you can get 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:23.600
 to save a team of these the most 

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:28.490
 large up to 12 hectares of harvest 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:30.850
 and it really is very useful and it's very 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:33.889
 important that you keep it in mind for 

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:37.000
 the future so that it does not happen to you what 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:40.780
 it happened to this lord of the plums 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.760
 the more expensive the fruit you are 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:45.160
 produces is greater is the economic damage 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:48.980
 that produces in the birds that you already know 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:51.500
 maybe some years is less other years 

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:55.490
 the parrots are still giving 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:58.970
 laps it is very important to place these 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:04.430
 equipment before the fruit is put 

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:06.470
 red before the birds have tried 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:08.810
 the fruit because once the test already 

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:14.270
 it's more difficult to move away from it, that's why 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:17.030
 you have to have this equipment already for when 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:19.750
 the time of flowering is happening 

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:22.840
 well right there already is 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:24.850
 have the product ready to prove it have 

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:27.730
 the whole battery the deranged what 

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:29.230
 it is necessary to install it and start 

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:33.220
 make it work so that the birds 

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:35.550
 migrate to other properties and are not in the 

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:39.940
 moment when the fruit will mature 

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:43.170
 good has been everything and for more 

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:43.170
 information enters 

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.800
 we wait for you on the site
