00:00:00.039 --> 00:00:03.750
 Hello and welcome to this review today, I'll give you the day as 

00:00:03.749 --> 00:00:08.620
 the library 2 gc-trainer a hundred in front of her probably knows your CDs 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:11.419
 against home around you do not know where to go 

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:14.669
 and there comes a part of a crater that's why I have 1 so too 

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:19.500
 bought this device holds up to 150 CDs and is very easy to use 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.550
 Included is a list where you can enter what that in there 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.769
 But much better is the possibility of the device directly via USB 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:30.840
 Connecting to the PC and from there to controlling just that 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.309
 allows a special software for the PC 300 now demonstrate I've ' 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.949
 I first how to use the device without the computer one gives his numbers 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:42.830
 now the Saxon meets Inter and present corpses search 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.260
 and the Library Sport automatically pulls out the CD 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.220
 and if you then stay again then the CD drives again 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:52.050
 on 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.730
 here in the PC you can double-click on a CD and then she drives a few 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.260
 Seconds later, if you have a new CD DVD or blue-ray then you can 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.230
 They very simply save a PC and the device will empty an empty compartment 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.640
 but you can stop if you have not seen Rome is one 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.220
 transparent window where you can go shopping that stood out so what 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.580
 Otherwise, the fact that you love the c300 is good 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.250
 can still complete so that you protect yourself against unauthorized access 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.900
 It can be very practical, as it is in big cities or elsewhere 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.330
 In total, two conclusions are provided if you lose one 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.670
 And finally, at the demonstrations, the CD is on 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.000
 or extend the whole course is controlled by the PC of concern 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.580
 still my conclusion the day as CD treat 2 the c300 Mister reliably goes 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.410
 Whenever you need it it is very well made and has a cool feel 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:47.220
 Design children such as the opera spelling has a link to the manufacturer page 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.920
 it's really about the most practical thing you can do so much 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.250
 Desk can have 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:52.910
 until next time who Marvin
