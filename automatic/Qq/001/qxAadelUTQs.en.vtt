this<00:00:03.120> origami<00:00:03.659> project<00:00:03.990> is<00:00:04.380> a<00:00:04.410> little<00:00:04.770> bit

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
this origami project is a little bit

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.499 
this origami project is a little bit
complicated<00:00:05.340> than<00:00:05.819> the<00:00:05.970> other<00:00:06.000> ones<00:00:06.330> I've

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
complicated than the other ones I've

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.270 
complicated than the other ones I've
done<00:00:06.920> a<00:00:07.920> couple<00:00:08.879> of<00:00:09.090> things<00:00:09.150> to<00:00:10.110> note<00:00:10.320> is<00:00:10.590> I'm

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
done a couple of things to note is I'm

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.570 
done a couple of things to note is I'm
using<00:00:11.910> cardstock<00:00:12.510> paper<00:00:13.080> for<00:00:13.410> this<00:00:13.559> because<00:00:14.459> I

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
using cardstock paper for this because I

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.300 
using cardstock paper for this because I
find<00:00:14.850> the<00:00:14.969> heavier<00:00:15.299> paper<00:00:15.809> it<00:00:16.199> stays<00:00:16.560> together

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
find the heavier paper it stays together

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.450 
find the heavier paper it stays together
better<00:00:17.880> this<00:00:18.210> gives<00:00:18.509> a<00:00:18.660> lot<00:00:18.810> of<00:00:18.869> wrinkles<00:00:19.619> when

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
better this gives a lot of wrinkles when

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.630 
better this gives a lot of wrinkles when
you<00:00:20.580> don't<00:00:21.289> here's<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.529> one<00:00:22.710> with<00:00:22.890> cardstock

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
you don't here's the one with cardstock

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.460 
you don't here's the one with cardstock
it's<00:00:23.880> a<00:00:24.000> little<00:00:24.300> nicer<00:00:24.630> looking

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
it's a little nicer looking

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.540 
it's a little nicer looking
I<00:00:25.609> did<00:00:26.609> this<00:00:26.789> with<00:00:27.599> index<00:00:28.589> cards<00:00:29.039> but<00:00:29.400> this

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
I did this with index cards but this

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.179 
I did this with index cards but this
one's<00:00:29.730> cardstock<00:00:30.269> paper<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:31.470> other<00:00:31.589> thing<00:00:31.949> I

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
one's cardstock paper the other thing I

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:38.240 
one's cardstock paper the other thing I
would<00:00:32.610> suggest<00:00:32.880> is<00:00:34.039> a<00:00:35.899> bowline<00:00:36.899> filer<00:00:37.289> I<00:00:37.620> can't

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
would suggest is a bowline filer I can't

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.799 
would suggest is a bowline filer I can't
find<00:00:38.460> mine<00:00:38.670> at<00:00:38.699> the<00:00:38.969> moment<00:00:39.300> I'm<00:00:39.390> gonna<00:00:39.510> use

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
find mine at the moment I'm gonna use

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.510 
find mine at the moment I'm gonna use
the<00:00:40.379> edge<00:00:40.559> of<00:00:40.980> this<00:00:41.570> ruler<00:00:43.100> I'll<00:00:44.100> show<00:00:44.309> you<00:00:44.399> how

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
the edge of this ruler I'll show you how

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.389 
the edge of this ruler I'll show you how
I'll<00:00:44.699> use<00:00:44.940> it<00:00:45.469> also<00:00:46.469> a<00:00:46.680> butter<00:00:46.980> knife<00:00:47.039> the

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
I'll use it also a butter knife the

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.220 
I'll use it also a butter knife the
backside<00:00:47.850> of<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:48.090> butter<00:00:48.269> knife<00:00:48.359> will<00:00:48.690> work<00:00:48.930> or

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
backside of a butter knife will work or

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.689 
backside of a butter knife will work or
even<00:00:50.180> the<00:00:51.180> backside<00:00:52.019> of<00:00:52.050> scissors<00:00:52.680> it<00:00:53.519> can

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
even the backside of scissors it can

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.180 
even the backside of scissors it can
work<00:00:53.969> just<00:00:54.629> be<00:00:55.019> careful<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:55.440> don't<00:00:55.500> tear<00:00:55.859> the

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
work just be careful you don't tear the

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.180 
work just be careful you don't tear the
paper<00:00:56.399> so<00:00:57.269> you're<00:00:58.079> gonna<00:00:58.260> make<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.530> series<00:00:59.010> of

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
paper so you're gonna make a series of

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.110 
paper so you're gonna make a series of
these<00:00:59.340> that<00:00:59.820> you<00:01:00.030> will<00:01:00.179> strand<00:01:00.510> together<00:01:02.120> with

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
these that you will strand together with

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.720 
these that you will strand together with
a<00:01:03.149> string<00:01:03.600> get<00:01:04.440> a<00:01:04.470> nice<00:01:04.710> long<00:01:05.040> needle

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:05.730 
a string get a nice long needle

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:10.400 
a string get a nice long needle
this<00:01:06.420> is<00:01:07.070> floss<00:01:08.720> you<00:01:09.720> can<00:01:09.870> get<00:01:10.050> in<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.350> store

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:10.410 
this is floss you can get in the store

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.850 
this is floss you can get in the store
it's<00:01:10.740> pretty<00:01:11.250> cheap<00:01:11.490> but<00:01:11.900> if<00:01:12.900> you<00:01:13.230> don't<00:01:13.440> if

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
it's pretty cheap but if you don't if

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.650 
it's pretty cheap but if you don't if
you<00:01:13.980> want<00:01:14.160> to<00:01:14.220> use<00:01:14.340> thread<00:01:14.730> that's<00:01:14.940> fine<00:01:15.390> I

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:15.660 
you want to use thread that's fine I

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.300 
you want to use thread that's fine I
would<00:01:15.840> suggest<00:01:16.020> quilting<00:01:16.770> thread<00:01:16.950> because

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
would suggest quilting thread because

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.770 
would suggest quilting thread because
it's<00:01:17.460> a<00:01:17.550> little<00:01:17.700> bit<00:01:17.910> heavier<00:01:18.300> than<00:01:18.390> your

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
it's a little bit heavier than your

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.000 
it's a little bit heavier than your
normal<00:01:18.960> thread<00:01:20.270> okay<00:01:21.270> so<00:01:21.960> here's<00:01:22.680> your<00:01:22.740> piece

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.010 
normal thread okay so here's your piece

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:29.030 
normal thread okay so here's your piece
of<00:01:23.040> paper<00:01:23.400> this<00:01:23.760> one<00:01:24.030> is<00:01:24.300> about<00:01:25.880> 3.2<00:01:26.960> inches<00:01:28.040> by

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
of paper this one is about 3.2 inches by

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.730 
of paper this one is about 3.2 inches by
3.2<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:30.120> I<00:01:30.180> did<00:01:30.420> that<00:01:30.540> on<00:01:30.570> purpose<00:01:30.930> so<00:01:31.140> I<00:01:31.470> can

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
3.2 and I did that on purpose so I can

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.160 
3.2 and I did that on purpose so I can
fold<00:01:32.550> it<00:01:32.760> in<00:01:32.910> thirds<00:01:33.210> I'll<00:01:33.630> show<00:01:33.840> you<00:01:33.900> in<00:01:34.110> a

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
fold it in thirds I'll show you in a

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.090 
fold it in thirds I'll show you in a
minute<00:01:34.290> so<00:01:35.010> fold<00:01:35.340> it<00:01:35.430> in<00:01:35.610> half<00:01:36.650> so<00:01:37.650> it<00:01:37.800> makes<00:01:37.980> a

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
minute so fold it in half so it makes a

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:45.380 
minute so fold it in half so it makes a
triangle<00:01:41.900> and<00:01:43.310> when<00:01:44.310> you're<00:01:44.460> using<00:01:44.640> cardstock

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
triangle and when you're using cardstock

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.120 
triangle and when you're using cardstock
you<00:01:45.600> want<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:45.930> try<00:01:46.080> to<00:01:46.140> be<00:01:46.320> exact<00:01:46.830> as<00:01:47.070> possible

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
you want to try to be exact as possible

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.950 
you want to try to be exact as possible
the<00:01:47.760> first<00:01:47.910> time<00:01:48.180> around<00:01:48.330> because<00:01:48.630> once<00:01:48.990> you

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
the first time around because once you

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.500 
the first time around because once you
flatten<00:01:51.960> it<00:01:52.260> you<00:01:52.500> it's<00:01:53.100> you<00:01:54.000> can't<00:01:54.270> really

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:54.510 
flatten it you it's you can't really

00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:08.690 
flatten it you it's you can't really
unflattering<00:01:59.240> a<00:02:00.240> triangle

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.810 

okay<00:02:09.700> now<00:02:09.910> you're<00:02:10.119> gonna<00:02:10.240> keep<00:02:10.600> this<00:02:11.820> open

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:12.820 
okay now you're gonna keep this open

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.210 
okay now you're gonna keep this open
this<00:02:12.970> way<00:02:13.210> and<00:02:13.480> here's<00:02:14.230> where<00:02:14.440> the<00:02:14.470> ruler

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
this way and here's where the ruler

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.100 
this way and here's where the ruler
comes<00:02:15.490> in<00:02:15.730> handy<00:02:16.050> this<00:02:17.050> is<00:02:18.000> about<00:02:19.000> four<00:02:19.690> and<00:02:19.960> a

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
comes in handy this is about four and a

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.750 
comes in handy this is about four and a
quarter<00:02:20.380> I<00:02:20.680> was<00:02:20.950> going<00:02:21.220> for<00:02:21.370> four<00:02:21.580> and<00:02:21.640> a<00:02:21.730> half

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
quarter I was going for four and a half

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.190 
quarter I was going for four and a half
I<00:02:22.120> should<00:02:22.150> have<00:02:22.420> made<00:02:22.510> it<00:02:22.540> a<00:02:22.630> little<00:02:22.780> bigger<00:02:22.930> so

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
I should have made it a little bigger so

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.170 
I should have made it a little bigger so
you<00:02:23.920> might<00:02:24.130> want<00:02:24.340> to<00:02:24.370> try<00:02:24.580> three<00:02:24.850> and<00:02:24.970> a<00:02:25.000> half

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
you might want to try three and a half

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.870 
you might want to try three and a half
inch<00:02:25.450> square<00:02:26.110> but<00:02:26.800> four<00:02:27.130> and<00:02:27.250> a<00:02:27.280> quarter<00:02:27.930> so<00:02:28.930> I

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
inch square but four and a quarter so I

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:37.440 
inch square but four and a quarter so I
want<00:02:30.880> to<00:02:33.510> divide<00:02:34.510> that<00:02:34.840> into<00:02:35.350> thirds<00:02:36.220> so<00:02:37.000> it'll

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
want to divide that into thirds so it'll

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.540 
want to divide that into thirds so it'll
be<00:02:37.720> approximately<00:02:38.850> one<00:02:40.950> just<00:02:41.950> short<00:02:42.190> of<00:02:42.280> one

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
be approximately one just short of one

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:47.420 
be approximately one just short of one
and<00:02:42.730> a<00:02:42.790> half<00:02:43.000> inches

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.780 

1/2<00:02:48.180> I'm<00:02:48.689> doing<00:02:49.110> this<00:02:49.290> exact<00:02:49.799> because<00:02:50.250> I<00:02:50.280> tried

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
1/2 I'm doing this exact because I tried

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.809 
1/2 I'm doing this exact because I tried
just<00:02:51.120> folding<00:02:51.689> it<00:02:51.840> myself<00:02:52.349> into<00:02:52.739> thirds<00:02:53.040> but

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
just folding it myself into thirds but

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:57.949 
just folding it myself into thirds but
this<00:02:54.150> way<00:02:54.329> is<00:02:54.659> actually<00:02:54.900> kind<00:02:55.439> of<00:02:55.530> easier<00:02:56.689> okay

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
this way is actually kind of easier okay

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.429 
this way is actually kind of easier okay
so<00:02:58.950> at<00:02:59.189> that<00:02:59.489> point<00:02:59.879> you<00:03:00.810> can<00:03:00.930> want<00:03:01.079> to<00:03:01.170> fold

00:03:01.429 --> 00:03:01.439 
so at that point you can want to fold

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:03.410 
so at that point you can want to fold
and<00:03:01.799> this<00:03:02.010> point<00:03:02.370> should<00:03:02.579> pretty<00:03:02.790> much<00:03:02.879> reach

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
and this point should pretty much reach

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:27.710 
and this point should pretty much reach
that<00:03:03.840> point<00:03:26.540> okay

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
that point okay

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.490 
that point okay
so<00:03:28.379> what<00:03:29.190> you<00:03:29.310> want<00:03:29.489> to<00:03:29.579> do<00:03:29.819> now<00:03:30.030> is<00:03:30.060> take<00:03:30.780> this

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
so what you want to do now is take this

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:40.640 
so what you want to do now is take this
flap<00:03:31.859> and<00:03:32.730> tuck<00:03:33.120> it<00:03:33.329> in<00:03:34.310> to<00:03:35.310> the<00:03:35.459> other<00:03:35.489> flap<00:03:39.650> so

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
flap and tuck it in to the other flap so

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.789 
flap and tuck it in to the other flap so
you<00:03:40.709> took<00:03:41.280> this<00:03:42.290> I'm<00:03:43.290> going<00:03:43.500> to<00:03:43.590> show<00:03:43.680> that

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
you took this I'm going to show that

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:45.140 
you took this I'm going to show that
again<00:03:44.069> because<00:03:44.280> I<00:03:44.340> think<00:03:44.400> I<00:03:44.579> went<00:03:44.730> off<00:03:44.819> into

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
again because I think I went off into

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.660 
again because I think I went off into
the<00:03:45.239> corner<00:03:45.389> so<00:03:46.290> the<00:03:46.709> next<00:03:47.159> thing<00:03:47.340> you<00:03:47.430> want<00:03:47.609> to

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
the corner so the next thing you want to

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.030 
the corner so the next thing you want to
do<00:03:47.819> is<00:03:48.000> take<00:03:48.209> this<00:03:48.420> flap<00:03:48.750> and<00:03:48.959> tuck<00:03:49.680> it<00:03:49.829> into

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
do is take this flap and tuck it into

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:58.309 
do is take this flap and tuck it into
this<00:03:50.430> flap<00:03:55.040> there<00:03:56.040> you<00:03:56.160> go<00:03:56.310> now<00:03:56.970> there's<00:03:57.870> two

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
this flap there you go now there's two

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:01.240 
this flap there you go now there's two
pieces<00:03:58.680> here<00:03:59.129> you're<00:03:59.459> gonna<00:03:59.609> take<00:03:59.910> one<00:04:00.209> and

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
pieces here you're gonna take one and

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:06.229 
pieces here you're gonna take one and
fold<00:04:02.250> it<00:04:02.489> down<00:04:02.819> to<00:04:03.319> the<00:04:04.319> center<00:04:04.760> the<00:04:05.760> point<00:04:06.060> and

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
fold it down to the center the point and

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:08.899 
fold it down to the center the point and
reaches<00:04:06.569> the<00:04:06.599> center<00:04:07.109> you<00:04:08.099> can<00:04:08.340> flatten<00:04:08.639> it

00:04:08.899 --> 00:04:08.909 
reaches the center you can flatten it

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:16.370 
reaches the center you can flatten it
out<00:04:09.030> if<00:04:09.269> you<00:04:09.419> want<00:04:10.280> and<00:04:11.280> then<00:04:12.949> open<00:04:13.949> it<00:04:14.040> up<00:04:15.380> and

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
out if you want and then open it up and

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.089 
out if you want and then open it up and
you<00:04:16.709> want<00:04:16.949> to<00:04:17.130> tuck<00:04:17.459> it<00:04:17.639> inside<00:04:18.889> with<00:04:19.889> that

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:20.099 
you want to tuck it inside with that

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:25.620 
you want to tuck it inside with that
fold<00:04:23.510> all<00:04:24.510> right

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
fold all right

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.960 
fold all right
so<00:04:26.170> here<00:04:26.560> comes<00:04:26.770> a<00:04:26.920> bit<00:04:27.130> of<00:04:27.160> a<00:04:27.310> tricky<00:04:27.670> part

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
so here comes a bit of a tricky part

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.720 
so here comes a bit of a tricky part
fold<00:04:28.870> this<00:04:29.080> what<00:04:29.590> will<00:04:29.740> help<00:04:29.950> is<00:04:30.160> if<00:04:30.340> you<00:04:30.460> fold

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:30.730 
fold this what will help is if you fold

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:36.950 
fold this what will help is if you fold
this<00:04:30.910> in<00:04:31.150> half<00:04:32.580> and<00:04:33.870> you<00:04:34.870> fold<00:04:35.140> this<00:04:35.290> in<00:04:35.530> half

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
this in half and you fold this in half

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.560 
this in half and you fold this in half
that<00:04:37.960> will<00:04:38.140> help<00:04:38.380> with<00:04:38.650> the<00:04:38.800> shape<00:04:39.010> and

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.570 
that will help with the shape and

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:42.900 
that will help with the shape and
poofing<00:04:40.570> out<00:04:41.010> you're<00:04:42.010> going<00:04:42.100> to<00:04:42.160> open<00:04:42.550> this<00:04:42.700> up

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
poofing out you're going to open this up

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:47.340 
poofing out you're going to open this up
this<00:04:43.690> will<00:04:43.960> fold<00:04:44.200> and<00:04:44.590> this<00:04:44.710> will<00:04:44.950> fold<00:04:46.350> you're

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350 
this will fold and this will fold you're

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:50.820 
this will fold and this will fold you're
going<00:04:47.470> to<00:04:47.530> open<00:04:47.740> it<00:04:47.950> up<00:04:48.160> like<00:04:48.370> a<00:04:49.380> balloon<00:04:50.380> or

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
going to open it up like a balloon or

00:04:50.830 --> 00:05:02.550 
going to open it up like a balloon or
the<00:04:50.950> waterbomb<00:04:57.030> have<00:04:58.030> it<00:04:58.180> cheap<00:04:58.510> and<00:05:01.560> take

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
the waterbomb have it cheap and take

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.760 
the waterbomb have it cheap and take
this<00:05:02.800> piece<00:05:03.160> here<00:05:03.760> and<00:05:04.230> you're<00:05:05.230> gonna<00:05:05.350> wrap<00:05:05.740> it

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
this piece here and you're gonna wrap it

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:07.650 
this piece here and you're gonna wrap it
nicely<00:05:06.400> I<00:05:06.610> like<00:05:06.790> it<00:05:06.940> this<00:05:07.060> way<00:05:07.120> for<00:05:07.510> some

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:07.660 
nicely I like it this way for some

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.250 
nicely I like it this way for some
reason<00:05:09.060> right<00:05:10.060> there<00:05:10.120> it's<00:05:10.510> gonna<00:05:10.750> Bend<00:05:11.020> as

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:11.260 
reason right there it's gonna Bend as

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.980 
reason right there it's gonna Bend as
you<00:05:11.410> can<00:05:11.560> see<00:05:11.800> it's<00:05:12.670> gonna<00:05:12.850> stay<00:05:13.150> wrap<00:05:13.420> by

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:13.990 
you can see it's gonna stay wrap by

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:15.390 
you can see it's gonna stay wrap by
tucking<00:05:14.260> this<00:05:14.530> inside<00:05:14.950> of<00:05:15.070> it

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:15.400 
tucking this inside of it

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:22.010 
tucking this inside of it
but<00:05:16.090> I<00:05:16.120> like<00:05:16.390> to<00:05:16.510> make<00:05:16.660> the<00:05:16.780> creases<00:05:17.050> first

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:26.430 

then<00:05:23.020> tuck<00:05:23.320> I'll<00:05:24.390> tuck<00:05:25.390> this<00:05:25.630> piece<00:05:25.930> into

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 
then tuck I'll tuck this piece into

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:30.650 
then tuck I'll tuck this piece into
there<00:05:26.680> you<00:05:27.960> might<00:05:28.960> have<00:05:29.140> to<00:05:29.290> fold<00:05:29.500> this<00:05:29.710> first

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:30.660 
there you might have to fold this first

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:35.490 
there you might have to fold this first
so<00:05:31.660> it<00:05:31.750> will<00:05:31.870> stay<00:05:32.170> down<00:05:32.440> and<00:05:33.990> you<00:05:34.990> can<00:05:35.290> see

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:35.500 
so it will stay down and you can see

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.950 
so it will stay down and you can see
with<00:05:35.800> my<00:05:35.830> fingers<00:05:36.270> manipulating<00:05:37.270> it<00:05:37.390> a<00:05:37.480> lot<00:05:37.690> if

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:37.960 
with my fingers manipulating it a lot if

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.690 
with my fingers manipulating it a lot if
you're<00:05:38.230> using<00:05:38.500> origami<00:05:38.950> paper<00:05:39.490> it<00:05:40.450> can<00:05:41.700> damage

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:42.700 
you're using origami paper it can damage

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:48.660 
you're using origami paper it can damage
the<00:05:42.940> look<00:05:45.600> damage<00:05:46.600> the<00:05:46.810> paper<00:05:47.050> so<00:05:47.380> it's<00:05:47.670> more

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:48.670 
the look damage the paper so it's more

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:53.070 
the look damage the paper so it's more
wrinkly<00:05:49.470> whereas<00:05:50.470> the<00:05:50.800> card<00:05:51.070> stock<00:05:51.840> can<00:05:52.840> take

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:53.080 
wrinkly whereas the card stock can take

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:57.540 
wrinkly whereas the card stock can take
it<00:05:53.260> a<00:05:53.410> little<00:05:53.770> bit<00:05:53.950> better<00:05:56.190> that<00:05:57.190> does<00:05:57.400> look

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:57.550 
it a little bit better that does look

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:01.869 
it a little bit better that does look
nicer

00:06:01.869 --> 00:06:01.879 

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:12.279 

and<00:06:02.879> there's<00:06:04.489> your<00:06:05.489> bead<00:06:06.229> for<00:06:07.229> your<00:06:07.349> Garland

00:06:12.279 --> 00:06:12.289 

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:18.859 

so<00:06:13.579> hold<00:06:15.229> this<00:06:16.229> bead<00:06:16.969> so<00:06:17.969> that<00:06:17.999> you<00:06:18.299> have<00:06:18.419> three

00:06:18.859 --> 00:06:18.869 
so hold this bead so that you have three

00:06:18.869 --> 00:06:21.169 
so hold this bead so that you have three
corners<00:06:19.349> this<00:06:19.529> way<00:06:19.769> it<00:06:20.579> took<00:06:20.729> me<00:06:20.849> a<00:06:20.879> while<00:06:21.119> to

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:21.179 
corners this way it took me a while to

00:06:21.179 --> 00:06:25.179 
corners this way it took me a while to
figure<00:06:21.479> out<00:06:21.689> but<00:06:21.989> if<00:06:22.259> you<00:06:22.759> hold<00:06:23.759> it<00:06:23.939> like<00:06:23.969> this

00:06:25.179 --> 00:06:25.189 
figure out but if you hold it like this

00:06:25.189 --> 00:06:32.679 
figure out but if you hold it like this
it<00:06:26.189> would<00:06:26.399> look<00:06:26.579> like<00:06:26.639> a<00:06:26.849> triangle<00:06:28.429> okay<00:06:29.779> okay

00:06:32.679 --> 00:06:32.689 
it would look like a triangle okay okay

00:06:32.689 --> 00:06:35.749 
it would look like a triangle okay okay
you<00:06:33.689> take<00:06:33.899> the<00:06:34.139> needle<00:06:34.369> make<00:06:35.369> sure<00:06:35.489> you<00:06:35.609> have<00:06:35.729> a

00:06:35.749 --> 00:06:35.759 
you take the needle make sure you have a

00:06:35.759 --> 00:06:37.449 
you take the needle make sure you have a
needle<00:06:36.059> that<00:06:36.299> fits<00:06:36.569> all<00:06:36.719> the<00:06:36.779> way<00:06:37.019> through

00:06:37.449 --> 00:06:37.459 
needle that fits all the way through

00:06:37.459 --> 00:06:40.599 
needle that fits all the way through
there's<00:06:38.459> one<00:06:38.729> end<00:06:39.029> that's<00:06:39.479> kind<00:06:39.779> of<00:06:39.869> open<00:06:40.229> I

00:06:40.599 --> 00:06:40.609 
there's one end that's kind of open I

00:06:40.609 --> 00:06:44.569 
there's one end that's kind of open I
start<00:06:41.609> on<00:06:41.759> the<00:06:41.789> end<00:06:42.089> that<00:06:42.649> isn't<00:06:43.649> open<00:06:44.009> because

00:06:44.569 --> 00:06:44.579 
start on the end that isn't open because

00:06:44.579 --> 00:06:47.509 
start on the end that isn't open because
I'm<00:06:44.909> less<00:06:45.119> likely<00:06:45.149> to<00:06:45.539> make<00:06:45.809> holes<00:06:46.079> on<00:06:46.519> the

00:06:47.509 --> 00:06:47.519 
I'm less likely to make holes on the

00:06:47.519 --> 00:07:03.789 
I'm less likely to make holes on the
other<00:06:47.699> end<00:06:48.079> so<00:06:49.279> push<00:06:50.279> it<00:06:50.459> through<00:06:58.759> there<00:06:59.759> we<00:06:59.849> go

00:07:03.789 --> 00:07:03.799 

00:07:03.799 --> 00:07:07.699 

feel<00:07:04.799> around<00:07:05.069> for<00:07:05.219> the<00:07:05.959> other<00:07:06.959> end<00:07:07.229> and<00:07:07.499> try

00:07:07.699 --> 00:07:07.709 
feel around for the other end and try

00:07:07.709 --> 00:07:17.949 
feel around for the other end and try
not<00:07:07.949> to<00:07:11.239> make<00:07:12.239> holes<00:07:12.599> into<00:07:13.229> that<00:07:13.439> whoopsie
