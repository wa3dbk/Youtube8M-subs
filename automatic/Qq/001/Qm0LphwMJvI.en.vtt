00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
can see I'm swiping through my different

can see I'm swiping through my different
albums<00:01:45.270> here<00:01:45.600> tap<00:01:45.930> and<00:01:45.960> hold<00:01:46.290> view<00:01:46.950> a

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
albums here tap and hold view a

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.440 
albums here tap and hold view a
high-risk<00:01:47.399> preview<00:01:47.939> and<00:01:48.119> then<00:01:48.210> we<00:01:48.299> can<00:01:48.420> just

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
high-risk preview and then we can just

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.530 
high-risk preview and then we can just
tap<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:49.079> insert<00:01:49.530> just<00:01:50.130> like<00:01:50.399> that<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:51.119> then<00:01:51.450> of

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
tap to insert just like that and then of

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.789 
tap to insert just like that and then of
course<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:51.840> have<00:01:51.930> a<00:01:51.990> delete<00:01:52.350> button<00:01:52.380> right

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
course you have a delete button right

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.980 
course you have a delete button right
here<00:01:52.829> where<00:01:53.159> we<00:01:53.250> can<00:01:53.280> delete<00:01:53.729> photos<00:01:54.570> if<00:01:54.780> we

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
here where we can delete photos if we

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.840 
here where we can delete photos if we
don't<00:01:55.229> want<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.649> put<00:01:55.860> that<00:01:55.890> photo<00:01:56.310> that<00:01:56.549> we

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
don't want to put that photo that we

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.459 
don't want to put that photo that we
have<00:01:56.939> chosen<00:01:57.299> in<00:01:57.659> there<00:01:57.869> but<00:01:58.049> it's<00:01:58.200> pretty

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
have chosen in there but it's pretty

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.010 
have chosen in there but it's pretty
cool<00:01:58.619> tweak<00:01:59.009> I<00:01:59.189> really<00:01:59.549> do<00:01:59.729> like<00:02:00.090> it<00:02:00.149> it<00:02:00.689> does

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
cool tweak I really do like it it does

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.539 
cool tweak I really do like it it does
definitely<00:02:01.290> adds<00:02:01.680> a<00:02:01.829> lot<00:02:01.950> of<00:02:02.009> functionality

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
definitely adds a lot of functionality

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.170 
definitely adds a lot of functionality
that<00:02:03.180> I<00:02:03.540> think<00:02:03.930> iOS<00:02:04.770> is<00:02:04.979> missing<00:02:05.579> it<00:02:05.790> gets<00:02:06.000> rid

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
that I think iOS is missing it gets rid

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.600 
that I think iOS is missing it gets rid
of<00:02:06.299> that<00:02:06.479> lengthy<00:02:06.930> process<00:02:07.229> to<00:02:07.890> add<00:02:08.190> a<00:02:08.250> photo

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
of that lengthy process to add a photo

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.540 
of that lengthy process to add a photo
by<00:02:09.209> going<00:02:09.599> in<00:02:09.780> like<00:02:10.050> this<00:02:10.289> and<00:02:10.349> maybe<00:02:11.310> that

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
by going in like this and maybe that

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.070 
by going in like this and maybe that
doesn't<00:02:11.640> take<00:02:11.970> very<00:02:12.150> long<00:02:12.270> for<00:02:12.450> some<00:02:12.840> of<00:02:12.959> you

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
doesn't take very long for some of you

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.890 
doesn't take very long for some of you
but<00:02:13.110> I<00:02:13.319> think<00:02:13.620> that

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
but I think that

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.500 
but I think that
is<00:02:14.079> much<00:02:14.290> more<00:02:14.590> efficient<00:02:15.310> just<00:02:15.849> to<00:02:16.000> add<00:02:16.180> a

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
is much more efficient just to add a

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.780 
is much more efficient just to add a
video<00:02:17.019> or<00:02:17.500> a<00:02:17.560> photo<00:02:17.920> or<00:02:18.159> anything<00:02:18.579> like<00:02:18.610> that

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
video or a photo or anything like that

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.729 
video or a photo or anything like that
without<00:02:19.180> having<00:02:19.659> to<00:02:19.750> go<00:02:19.870> all<00:02:19.900> the<00:02:20.110> way<00:02:20.260> through

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
without having to go all the way through

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.610 
without having to go all the way through
the<00:02:20.980> little<00:02:21.400> menu<00:02:21.790> options<00:02:22.269> here<00:02:22.480> in<00:02:22.629> iOS<00:02:23.170> so<00:02:23.590> I

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
the little menu options here in iOS so I

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:24.720 
the little menu options here in iOS so I
think<00:02:23.920> it's<00:02:24.010> a<00:02:24.069> pretty<00:02:24.189> cool<00:02:24.400> tweak<00:02:24.640> I

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
think it's a pretty cool tweak I

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.220 
think it's a pretty cool tweak I
definitely<00:02:25.030> go<00:02:25.209> ahead<00:02:25.450> and<00:02:25.629> check<00:02:25.930> it<00:02:26.110> out

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
definitely go ahead and check it out
