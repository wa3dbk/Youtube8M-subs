later<00:02:11.650> so<00:02:12.650> now<00:02:13.070> what<00:02:13.250> you're<00:02:13.340> going<00:02:13.519> to<00:02:13.549> do<00:02:13.790> is

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
later so now what you're going to do is

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.000 
later so now what you're going to do is
take<00:02:14.840> your<00:02:16.209> 22<00:02:17.209> kilo<00:02:17.540> ohm<00:02:17.660> resistor<00:02:18.110> put<00:02:18.799> it<00:02:18.890> in

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
take your 22 kilo ohm resistor put it in

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.759 
take your 22 kilo ohm resistor put it in
the<00:02:19.100> same<00:02:19.340> row<00:02:19.549> as<00:02:20.049> your<00:02:21.049> yellow<00:02:21.560> wire<00:02:21.799> and

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:23.769 
the same row as your yellow wire and

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:28.000 
the same row as your yellow wire and
move<00:02:24.769> it<00:02:24.920> and<00:02:25.100> put<00:02:26.060> the<00:02:26.320> other<00:02:27.320> leg<00:02:27.650> of<00:02:27.890> the

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
move it and put the other leg of the

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.590 
move it and put the other leg of the
resistor<00:02:28.489> a<00:02:28.760> few<00:02:29.510> rows<00:02:29.690> down<00:02:29.930> it's<00:02:30.560> not<00:02:31.010> really

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
resistor a few rows down it's not really

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.870 
resistor a few rows down it's not really
it<00:02:32.600> doesn't<00:02:32.780> have<00:02:32.989> to<00:02:33.079> be<00:02:33.200> that<00:02:33.380> many<00:02:33.590> and<00:02:33.920> then

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
it doesn't have to be that many and then

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.520 
it doesn't have to be that many and then
put<00:02:35.239> your<00:02:36.940> transistor<00:02:37.940> in<00:02:38.120> so<00:02:38.540> that<00:02:38.750> this<00:02:39.230> leg

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
put your transistor in so that this leg

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.080 
put your transistor in so that this leg

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
of the resistor is in the same row as

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.030 
of the resistor is in the same row as
the<00:02:44.120> base<00:02:44.450> pin<00:02:44.720> of<00:02:45.040> your<00:02:46.510> transistor<00:02:48.040> then

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
the base pin of your transistor then

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:58.510 
the base pin of your transistor then
connect<00:02:49.760> the<00:02:53.500> collector<00:02:54.730> straight<00:02:55.730> or<00:02:56.720> yet<00:02:57.520> to

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:58.520 
connect the collector straight or yet to

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.880 
connect the collector straight or yet to
the<00:02:58.730> power<00:02:59.270> supply<00:02:59.629> so<00:03:00.020> the<00:03:00.050> positive<00:03:00.319> strip

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
the power supply so the positive strip

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.080 
the power supply so the positive strip
and<00:03:01.180> then<00:03:02.180> you

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
and then you

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.420 
and then you

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
the ground and there you go your

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:43.729 
the ground and there you go your
circuits<00:03:37.860> built

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:46.050 

okay<00:03:44.739> so<00:03:44.799> now<00:03:45.040> that<00:03:45.069> your<00:03:45.310> circuits<00:03:45.640> built

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
okay so now that your circuits built

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.910 
okay so now that your circuits built
all<00:03:46.090> this<00:03:46.239> left<00:03:46.450> to<00:03:46.540> do<00:03:46.660> is<00:03:46.780> test<00:03:46.989> it<00:03:47.260> I<00:03:47.470> have

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
all this left to do is test it I have

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.530 
all this left to do is test it I have
here<00:03:48.130> a<00:03:48.160> soldered<00:03:48.550> version<00:03:48.910> of<00:03:49.030> the<00:03:49.150> circuit<00:03:49.480> I

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
here a soldered version of the circuit I

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.750 
here a soldered version of the circuit I
just<00:03:49.780> showed<00:03:49.959> you<00:03:49.989> and<00:03:50.400> now<00:03:51.400> I'm<00:03:51.489> going<00:03:51.640> to

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
just showed you and now I'm going to

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.070 
just showed you and now I'm going to
test<00:03:51.970> it<00:03:52.150> so<00:03:52.959> it's<00:03:53.620> pretty<00:03:54.160> light<00:03:54.459> here<00:03:55.080> but

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:56.080 
test it so it's pretty light here but

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.650 
test it so it's pretty light here but
when<00:03:56.349> you<00:03:56.500> cover<00:03:56.739> the<00:03:56.910> LDR<00:03:57.910> with<00:03:58.209> something

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
when you cover the LDR with something

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:04.550 
when you cover the LDR with something
making<00:03:59.440> it<00:03:59.560> darker<00:03:59.950> the<00:04:00.670> LEDs<00:04:02.760> turn<00:04:03.760> on<00:04:03.970> and

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
making it darker the LEDs turn on and

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.890 
making it darker the LEDs turn on and
that's<00:04:05.560> how<00:04:05.709> this<00:04:05.830> circuit<00:04:06.220> works

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:20.140 

there's<00:04:10.900> the<00:04:11.110> underside<00:04:11.560> of<00:04:11.590> the<00:04:11.950> PCB

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:21.879 

so<00:04:20.780> now<00:04:20.930> I'm<00:04:21.019> going<00:04:21.260> to<00:04:21.350> explain<00:04:21.620> how<00:04:21.829> the

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:21.889 
so now I'm going to explain how the

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:24.250 
so now I'm going to explain how the
circuit<00:04:22.370> works<00:04:22.520> the<00:04:23.210> potentiometer<00:04:23.990> and<00:04:24.169> the

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
circuit works the potentiometer and the

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.040 
circuit works the potentiometer and the
LDR<00:04:24.710> form<00:04:25.070> a<00:04:25.160> voltage<00:04:25.490> divider<00:04:25.840> these<00:04:26.840> two

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
LDR form a voltage divider these two

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:28.810 
LDR form a voltage divider these two
variable<00:04:27.530> resistors<00:04:28.010> will<00:04:28.310> use<00:04:28.460> up<00:04:28.639> all<00:04:28.790> the

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820 
variable resistors will use up all the

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.120 
variable resistors will use up all the
voltage<00:04:29.240> supplied<00:04:29.630> to<00:04:29.780> them<00:04:29.930> and<00:04:30.139> in<00:04:30.680> a<00:04:30.770> ratio

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 
voltage supplied to them and in a ratio

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.790 
voltage supplied to them and in a ratio
of<00:04:31.250> their<00:04:31.430> resistances<00:04:32.120> for<00:04:32.960> example<00:04:33.380> if<00:04:33.620> each

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
of their resistances for example if each

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.770 
of their resistances for example if each
of<00:04:33.979> them<00:04:34.100> has<00:04:34.280> a<00:04:34.310> resistance<00:04:34.790> of<00:04:35.030> 50<00:04:35.330> kilo<00:04:35.479> ohms

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
of them has a resistance of 50 kilo ohms

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.719 
of them has a resistance of 50 kilo ohms
and<00:04:36.020> they<00:04:36.500> will<00:04:36.620> split<00:04:36.860> the<00:04:36.979> voltage<00:04:37.280> evenly

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:37.729 
and they will split the voltage evenly

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:40.480 
and they will split the voltage evenly
if<00:04:38.060> the<00:04:38.600> potentiometer<00:04:39.380> has<00:04:39.530> a<00:04:39.560> voltage<00:04:39.979> of<00:04:40.160> 50

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
if the potentiometer has a voltage of 50

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.490 
if the potentiometer has a voltage of 50
kilo<00:04:40.639> ohms<00:04:40.880> and<00:04:41.210> the<00:04:41.300> LDR<00:04:41.690> has<00:04:41.900> a<00:04:41.930> voltage<00:04:42.350> of

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.500 
kilo ohms and the LDR has a voltage of

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.100 
kilo ohms and the LDR has a voltage of
100<00:04:42.889> kilo<00:04:43.040> ohms<00:04:43.280> then<00:04:44.030> the<00:04:44.180> LDR<00:04:44.630> will<00:04:44.810> use<00:04:44.960> up

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 
100 kilo ohms then the LDR will use up

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:46.420 
100 kilo ohms then the LDR will use up
twice<00:04:45.320> as<00:04:45.470> much<00:04:45.620> voltage<00:04:46.130> as<00:04:46.370> the

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
twice as much voltage as the

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.939 
twice as much voltage as the
potentiometer<00:04:47.330> this<00:04:48.199> is<00:04:48.350> how<00:04:48.440> the<00:04:48.500> circuit

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:48.949 
potentiometer this is how the circuit

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:50.650 
potentiometer this is how the circuit
turns<00:04:49.100> on<00:04:49.340> in<00:04:49.520> the<00:04:49.610> dark<00:04:49.820> and<00:04:50.060> turns<00:04:50.300> off<00:04:50.479> in

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:50.660 
turns on in the dark and turns off in

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.200 
turns on in the dark and turns off in
the<00:04:50.750> light<00:04:50.930> in<00:04:51.199> the<00:04:52.100> light<00:04:52.310> the<00:04:52.639> resistance<00:04:53.090> of

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210 
the light in the light the resistance of

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.689 
the light in the light the resistance of
the<00:04:53.360> LDR<00:04:53.780> is<00:04:53.900> low<00:04:54.110> so<00:04:54.740> most<00:04:54.949> of<00:04:55.070> the<00:04:55.190> voltage<00:04:55.520> is

00:04:55.689 --> 00:04:55.699 
the LDR is low so most of the voltage is

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:58.090 
the LDR is low so most of the voltage is
used<00:04:55.880> by<00:04:56.030> the<00:04:56.090> potentiometer<00:04:56.900> this<00:04:57.620> means<00:04:57.860> no

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100 
used by the potentiometer this means no

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.430 
used by the potentiometer this means no
current<00:04:58.669> can<00:04:59.030> flow<00:04:59.060> through<00:04:59.270> the<00:04:59.630> 22<00:05:00.020> kilo<00:05:00.350> ohm

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 
current can flow through the 22 kilo ohm

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:01.990 
current can flow through the 22 kilo ohm
resistor<00:05:00.860> and<00:05:00.889> into<00:05:01.340> the<00:05:01.430> basement<00:05:01.850> of<00:05:01.940> the

resistor and into the basement of the

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.939 
resistor and into the basement of the
transistor<00:05:02.600> which<00:05:03.229> means<00:05:03.470> the<00:05:03.590> internal

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:03.949 
transistor which means the internal

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:05.260 
transistor which means the internal
resistance<00:05:04.340> of<00:05:04.460> the<00:05:04.520> transistor<00:05:04.970> is

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
resistance of the transistor is

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.830 
resistance of the transistor is
extremely<00:05:05.750> high<00:05:05.930> so<00:05:06.590> the<00:05:06.710> LEDs<00:05:07.130> stay<00:05:07.729> off<00:05:07.940> when

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 
extremely high so the LEDs stay off when

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.689 
extremely high so the LEDs stay off when
the<00:05:08.960> light<00:05:09.139> level<00:05:09.380> drops<00:05:09.590> low<00:05:09.800> enough<00:05:09.830> the

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:10.699 
the light level drops low enough the

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:12.340 
the light level drops low enough the
resistance<00:05:11.120> of<00:05:11.270> the<00:05:11.360> LDR<00:05:11.720> will<00:05:11.960> increase

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:12.350 
resistance of the LDR will increase

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:14.350 
resistance of the LDR will increase
meaning<00:05:13.250> more<00:05:13.430> voltage<00:05:13.789> will<00:05:14.060> make<00:05:14.210> it

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 
meaning more voltage will make it

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.300 
meaning more voltage will make it
through<00:05:14.570> the<00:05:14.690> potentiometer<00:05:15.410> this<00:05:16.070> means

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
through the potentiometer this means

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:18.040 
through the potentiometer this means
enough<00:05:16.639> current<00:05:16.940> will<00:05:17.150> make<00:05:17.300> it<00:05:17.479> through<00:05:17.930> the

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.050 
enough current will make it through the

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:19.990 
enough current will make it through the
22<00:05:18.440> kilo<00:05:18.710> ohm<00:05:18.830> resistor<00:05:19.250> and<00:05:19.280> into<00:05:19.729> the<00:05:19.850> base

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 
22 kilo ohm resistor and into the base

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.210 
22 kilo ohm resistor and into the base
pin<00:05:20.240> of<00:05:20.449> the<00:05:20.479> transistor<00:05:20.770> to<00:05:21.770> allow<00:05:21.949> current

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:22.220
