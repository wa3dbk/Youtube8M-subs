00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:06.330
 How to change 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:09.190
 or remove the 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:12.959
 scout or fog lights a 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:12.959
 volkswagen golf for you 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.910
 let's remove the most complicated is the 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.100
 on the passenger side or the side 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.760
 straight 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.760
 is 

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:34.580
 first we must pose correctly 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:38.260
 the car in such a way that it is safe 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:41.579
 so that we will not have problems 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.579
 much security first of all 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.620
 for this you have to 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.620
 remove 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:56.140
 remove some screws from the fender 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:01:01.000
 on the right side corresponding 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:05.019
 in the front are six screws 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:08.500
 you find here another one above another 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:13.000
 higher up the same towards the side of the 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:14.640
 shock absorber six screws here and here 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.659
 there is another 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:21.159
 later 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:23.679
 we must remove a little the fender 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:26.980
 to give us access to the side 

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:29.590
 front of the vehicle 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:33.200
 here is an air filter with 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:38.710
 sensor for 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:42.700
 the accelerator must be removed too 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:44.890
 that filter for it should be removed the 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:49.320
 Hoses that arrive that are under pressure 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.320
 at the top are two hoses 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:55.310
 and they get to see they are already removed 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:02:01.479
 yes 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:01.479
 to this part above 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.740
 and also a hose in the part of 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:14.650
 down 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.650
 and this hose simply goes under pressure 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:23.540
 this for it we remove the screw that 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:26.120
 is here is the one that grabs 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:29.860
 the filter 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.860
 It is previously removed 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:43.790
 we take out the filter 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.790
 Be very careful not to damage 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.620
 from the filter 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.700
 and is no longer giving access to the part 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.540
 rear 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:58.030
 the fog lights 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:01.629
 she finds a screw in the 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:03.700
 top as you can see quite 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:07.540
 to the bottom to be able to remove the screw 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:11.530
 It is necessary to pass a screwdriver 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:16.030
 stria through the base of the filter has a 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:18.569
 hollow here and in the background you can see the 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.569
 screw 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:27.250
 as you can see there 50 screw 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.250
 background 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.590
 ready 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:35.230
 you have to remove that screw and the 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.710
 screw from the bottom to the 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.710
 right side 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:43.850
 there are two screws but that 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:45.890
 screw only supports one base 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:47.280
 of the explorer is not necessary 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:49.110
 remove it 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.819
 they can realize when they already release 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:54.219
 all if the 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:56.109
 exploratory or anti fog these 

00:03:54.219 --> 00:03:57.760
 loose also on the bottom 

00:03:56.109 --> 00:04:01.400
 of the car come the cables that have to be 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:04.659
 disconnect them in this way 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.659
 the bottom 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.600
 this is the bottom of the car 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:19.959
 here is the explorer 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.959
 and we have the cable 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.540
 of current 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:27.730
 and here 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:30.040
 remove it from its base 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:32.760
 what is the connector here is 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.760
 find the connector 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.360
 you have to remove this connector so that 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.930
 be a little bit of pressure with care of 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.930
 not break 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:48.919
 and it's already loose 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:52.669
 in this way we remove the supply of 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:55.340
 energy and we're ready to be able 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:59.750
 remove the explorer 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:02.180
 let's remove the screws and 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:05.980
 the explorer is ready to return it 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.980
 to simply place 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:11.590
 the opposite effect is done and the 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:15.180
 explorer 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:15.180
 is totally retired 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.770
 and we will do as 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.660
 we can 

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:27.880
 have there 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:35.710
 a better view with the camera a moment 

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:35.710
 do not 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:51.410
 were already loose screws I 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:51.410
 removing the again 

00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:05.139
 ah 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:15.580
 and here we have our explorer to 

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:20.050
 remove 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:22.539
 for change or if you do not follow the arrangement of 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:25.289
 the bulb just below it 

00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:27.959
 You can change the bulb 

00:06:25.289 --> 00:06:29.770
 removing this this 

00:06:27.959 --> 00:06:31.449
 overall we were having carefully 

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:34.899
 so you do not get water and do not get hurt 

00:06:31.449 --> 00:06:38.780
 when removing the explorer we see the part 

00:06:34.899 --> 00:06:43.420
 of the bulb 

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:43.420
 of the explorer you have everything
