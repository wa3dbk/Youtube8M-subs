00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
performs like one because this one has

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.330 
performs like one because this one has
full<00:00:47.219> Windows<00:00:47.550> 8.1<00:00:48.289> but<00:00:49.289> what<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:50.039> coolest

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340

advantages for the two and one pc

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.170 
advantages for the two and one pc
tablets<00:01:13.409> is<00:01:13.500> battery<00:01:14.159> life<00:01:14.189> they<00:01:14.880> typically

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
tablets is battery life they typically

tablets is battery life they typically
have<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.750> battery<00:01:16.229> life<00:01:16.259> of<00:01:16.500> around<00:01:16.740> eight

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
have a battery life of around eight

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.969 
have a battery life of around eight
hours<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.640> that<00:01:18.119> is<00:01:18.299> usually<00:01:18.659> double<00:01:19.380> of<00:01:19.680> kind

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
hours and that is usually double of kind

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.920 
hours and that is usually double of kind
of<00:01:20.040> a<00:01:20.100> normal<00:01:20.280> notebook<00:01:20.729> battery<00:01:21.060> life<00:01:21.240> so<00:01:21.479> it

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
gives you a lot of operating time and

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.940 
gives you a lot of operating time and
again<00:01:24.270> it's<00:01:24.420> great<00:01:24.600> for<00:01:24.780> traveling<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.439> if

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
again it's great for traveling and if

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.560 
again it's great for traveling and if
you're<00:01:26.130> stuck<00:01:26.310> in<00:01:26.340> an<00:01:26.490> airplane<00:01:26.759> out<00:01:27.060> it'll

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
you're stuck in an airplane out it'll

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.679 
you're stuck in an airplane out it'll
last<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.990> whole<00:01:28.110> flight<00:01:28.320> two-in-one<00:01:28.979> tablets

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:29.689 
last the whole flight two-in-one tablets

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:31.999
