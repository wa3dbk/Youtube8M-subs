kind of moist I also part it in three
sections<00:00:37.739> one<00:00:37.980> right<00:00:38.730> here<00:00:38.940> in<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.180> middle

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:39.449 
sections one right here in the middle

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:43.189 
sections one right here in the middle
and<00:00:39.600> then<00:00:39.870> some<00:00:40.260> ear<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:41.219> ear<00:00:41.399> I<00:00:42.030> like<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:42.989> start

00:00:43.189 --> 00:00:43.199 
and then some ear to ear I like to start

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:45.950 
and then some ear to ear I like to start
in<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.500> back<00:00:43.530> from<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.309> big<00:00:44.429> section<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:45.210> I

in the back from the big section and I

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.979 
in the back from the big section and I
unwind<00:00:46.649> here<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.519> then<00:00:47.699> it's<00:00:48.329> pretty<00:00:48.570> simple

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
unwind here and then it's pretty simple

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.090 
unwind here and then it's pretty simple
from<00:00:49.170> here<00:00:49.500> I<00:00:49.710> just<00:00:50.010> take<00:00:50.579> a<00:00:50.609> comb<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:52.100> part

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.880 
from here I just take a comb and part
out<00:00:53.309> a<00:00:53.550> section<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.839> then<00:00:54.929> take<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.199> clip<00:00:55.620> or<00:00:55.829> a

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
out a section and then take a clip or a

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.430 
out a section and then take a clip or a
hair<00:00:56.309> tie<00:00:56.609> and<00:00:56.969> put<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.809> section<00:00:58.199> that<00:00:58.289> you're

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
hair tie and put the section that you're

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.959

not<00:00:58.589> working<00:00:59.039> with<00:00:59.660> back<00:01:00.660> up<00:01:00.870> here<00:01:01.140> and

not working with back up here and
throughout<00:01:02.969> I<00:01:03.390> am<00:01:03.899> like<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.500> spray<00:01:05.159> down<00:01:05.280> the

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
throughout I am like to spray down the

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.700 
throughout I am like to spray down the
hair<00:01:05.610> if<00:01:05.730> it<00:01:05.880> starts<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:06.510> get<00:01:06.690> a<00:01:06.750> little<00:01:06.900> too

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
hair if it starts to get a little too

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.580 
hair if it starts to get a little too
dry<00:01:08.040> just<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.460> keep<00:01:08.640> it<00:01:08.790> wet<00:01:09.030> I<00:01:09.290> just<00:01:10.290> comb<00:01:10.560> it

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
dry just to keep it wet I just comb it

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:18.190 
dry just to keep it wet I just comb it
out<00:01:14.180> and<00:01:15.180> then<00:01:15.870> I<00:01:16.020> go<00:01:16.260> to<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:17.040> very<00:01:17.280> end

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
out and then I go to the very end

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:24.170 
out and then I go to the very end
and<00:01:19.640> then<00:01:20.640> just<00:01:20.940> kind<00:01:21.600> of<00:01:21.660> snip<00:01:22.080> off<00:01:22.970> the<00:01:23.970> very

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
and then just kind of snip off the very

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.340 
and then just kind of snip off the very
ends<00:01:24.770> just<00:01:25.770> like<00:01:25.830> that<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.960> then<00:01:27.960> you<00:01:28.140> can

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
ends just like that and then you can

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.180 
ends just like that and then you can
either<00:01:28.790> twist<00:01:29.790> it<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.560> put<00:01:31.560> it<00:01:31.650> to<00:01:31.800> the<00:01:31.830> side

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.190 
either twist it and put it to the side

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.340 
either twist it and put it to the side
or<00:01:32.580> put<00:01:32.910> the<00:01:33.030> part<00:01:33.360> that<00:01:33.480> you<00:01:33.570> already<00:01:33.720> cut<00:01:34.140> and

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
or put the part that you already cut and

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.500 
or put the part that you already cut and
another<00:01:34.680> hair<00:01:35.010> tie<00:01:35.220> just<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:36.090> keep<00:01:36.330> it

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:36.510 
another hair tie just to keep it

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.960 
another hair tie just to keep it
separate<00:01:36.900> from<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.800> other<00:01:38.010> sections<00:01:38.760> that

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
separate from the other sections that

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.780 
separate from the other sections that
you'll<00:01:39.180> be<00:01:39.330> cutting<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:40.710> then<00:01:40.860> I<00:01:40.950> just<00:01:41.100> take

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
you'll be cutting and then I just take

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.610 
you'll be cutting and then I just take
another<00:01:42.090> section<00:01:42.450> about<00:01:42.870> the<00:01:43.020> same<00:01:43.230> size<00:01:43.470> of

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:43.620 
another section about the same size of

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.760 
another section about the same size of
the<00:01:43.680> other<00:01:43.830> one<00:01:44.160> now<00:01:44.900> if<00:01:45.900> you<00:01:46.140> feel<00:01:46.320> like<00:01:46.530> this

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
the other one now if you feel like this

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.150 
the other one now if you feel like this
is<00:01:46.830> too<00:01:47.040> much<00:01:47.370> to<00:01:47.640> carry<00:01:48.150> or<00:01:48.360> grab<00:01:48.740> and<00:01:49.740> try<00:01:49.980> and

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:50.160 
is too much to carry or grab and try and

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.330 
is too much to carry or grab and try and
cut<00:01:50.340> at<00:01:50.550> once<00:01:50.910> you<00:01:51.390> can<00:01:51.600> simply<00:01:52.230> split<00:01:53.010> the

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
cut at once you can simply split the

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.740 
cut at once you can simply split the
section<00:01:53.880> that<00:01:54.060> you<00:01:54.860> cut<00:01:55.860> it<00:01:55.980> off<00:01:56.130> in<00:01:56.430> half<00:01:56.750> like

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
section that you cut it off in half like

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:06.289 
section that you cut it off in half like
this<00:01:58.280> and<00:01:59.280> then<00:02:00.680> comb<00:02:01.680> out<00:02:01.890> this<00:02:02.190> side

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.090 

now<00:02:07.299> I'd<00:02:07.450> like<00:02:07.570> to<00:02:07.630> use<00:02:07.900> a<00:02:08.170> fine-tooth<00:02:08.979> comb

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
now I'd like to use a fine-tooth comb

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:10.980 
now I'd like to use a fine-tooth comb
but<00:02:09.550> you<00:02:09.640> don't<00:02:09.789> use<00:02:10.030> one<00:02:10.209> this<00:02:10.720> would

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
but you don't use one this would

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.710 
but you don't use one this would
probably<00:02:11.319> do<00:02:11.470> or<00:02:11.770> even<00:02:12.150> something<00:02:13.150> like<00:02:13.330> this

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
probably do or even something like this

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.010 
probably do or even something like this
so<00:02:14.080> I<00:02:14.140> do<00:02:14.200> this<00:02:14.620> again<00:02:15.239> and<00:02:16.239> then<00:02:16.510> I<00:02:16.569> just<00:02:16.750> cut

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
so I do this again and then I just cut

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.440 
so I do this again and then I just cut
off<00:02:17.050> the<00:02:17.350> ends<00:02:17.739> for<00:02:18.220> her<00:02:18.340> it's<00:02:18.640> about<00:02:18.880> half<00:02:19.270> a

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
off the ends for her it's about half a

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:26.430 
off the ends for her it's about half a
wet<00:02:19.660> curl<00:02:20.610> and<00:02:21.610> just<00:02:22.600> like<00:02:22.750> that<00:02:24.630> and<00:02:25.630> then<00:02:26.350> I

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
wet curl and just like that and then I

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.330 
wet curl and just like that and then I
do<00:02:26.709> the<00:02:26.860> same<00:02:27.150> to<00:02:28.150> the<00:02:28.930> next<00:02:29.050> section<00:02:29.380> all

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
do the same to the next section all

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.490 
do the same to the next section all
right<00:02:30.760> I'm<00:02:30.970> going<00:02:31.150> to<00:02:31.300> finish<00:02:31.900> this<00:02:32.170> up<00:02:32.350> and

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
right I'm going to finish this up and

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.080 
right I'm going to finish this up and
then<00:02:32.590> we'll<00:02:32.709> move<00:02:32.860> to<00:02:32.920> the<00:02:33.130> side<00:02:33.310> and<00:02:33.760> I<00:02:33.850> forgot

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
then we'll move to the side and I forgot

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.290 
then we'll move to the side and I forgot
to<00:02:34.150> tell<00:02:34.270> you<00:02:34.510> once<00:02:34.750> you<00:02:34.840> have<00:02:35.110> a<00:02:35.940> section<00:02:36.940> cut

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
to tell you once you have a section cut

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.449 
to tell you once you have a section cut
just<00:02:37.720> add<00:02:38.080> it<00:02:38.440> to<00:02:38.590> this<00:02:38.769> other<00:02:39.010> section<00:02:39.250> I

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
just add it to this other section I

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.370 
just add it to this other section I
twisted<00:02:39.880> it<00:02:40.030> so<00:02:40.060> I<00:02:40.269> kind<00:02:40.600> of<00:02:40.630> untangle<00:02:41.170> that

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
twisted it so I kind of untangle that

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.500 
twisted it so I kind of untangle that
and<00:02:41.800> then<00:02:42.670> add<00:02:42.970> this<00:02:43.420> and<00:02:44.350> either<00:02:44.980> use<00:02:45.250> a<00:02:45.730> brush

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
and then add this and either use a brush

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.479 
and then add this and either use a brush
kind<00:02:46.810> of<00:02:46.900> like<00:02:47.050> that<00:02:47.290> or<00:02:47.530> comb<00:02:47.860> to<00:02:48.220> kind<00:02:48.430> of

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
kind of like that or comb to kind of

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:50.390 
kind of like that or comb to kind of
blend<00:02:48.760> it<00:02:48.970> into<00:02:49.090> the<00:02:49.239> rest<00:02:49.480> of<00:02:49.600> the<00:02:49.690> hair<00:02:49.900> and

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
blend it into the rest of the hair and

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.750 
blend it into the rest of the hair and
just<00:02:51.690> twist<00:02:52.690> it<00:02:52.900> and<00:02:53.500> set<00:02:54.160> it<00:02:54.280> back<00:02:54.310> to<00:02:54.489> the

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
just twist it and set it back to the

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.210 
just twist it and set it back to the
decide<00:02:55.150> all<00:02:55.450> right<00:02:55.510> as<00:02:55.750> you<00:02:55.900> see<00:02:56.080> I<00:02:56.110> just<00:02:56.220> put

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
decide all right as you see I just put

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.190 
decide all right as you see I just put
the<00:02:57.370> back<00:02:57.970> back<00:02:58.239> up<00:02:58.269> you<00:02:58.600> can<00:02:58.630> just<00:02:58.750> put<00:02:58.989> it<00:02:59.110> in

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
the back back up you can just put it in

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.570 
the back back up you can just put it in
a<00:02:59.260> ponytail<00:02:59.560> if<00:02:59.890> you<00:03:00.010> want<00:03:00.190> you<00:03:00.280> to<00:03:00.340> have<00:03:00.489> to

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
a ponytail if you want you to have to

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.280 
a ponytail if you want you to have to
twist<00:03:00.819> it<00:03:00.970> back<00:03:01.120> up<00:03:01.360> since<00:03:01.660> it's<00:03:01.780> already<00:03:01.930> cut

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
twist it back up since it's already cut

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.000 
twist it back up since it's already cut
and<00:03:02.560> the<00:03:03.310> side<00:03:03.640> is<00:03:04.030> pretty<00:03:04.810> much<00:03:05.019> the<00:03:05.739> same

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
and the side is pretty much the same

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:06.720 
and the side is pretty much the same
thing

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
thing

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.080 
thing
part<00:03:07.030> of<00:03:07.120> off<00:03:07.390> into<00:03:08.049> sections<00:03:08.680> I'll<00:03:09.310> live<00:03:09.820> and

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
part of off into sections I'll live and

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:15.120 
part of off into sections I'll live and
usually<00:03:11.019> the<00:03:11.230> front<00:03:11.500> is<00:03:11.950> kind<00:03:12.700> of<00:03:13.739> odd<00:03:14.739> because

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
usually the front is kind of odd because

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.150 
usually the front is kind of odd because
it's<00:03:15.489> at<00:03:16.000> the<00:03:16.060> edges<00:03:16.750> and<00:03:17.170> hareton's<00:03:17.890> to<00:03:18.040> be

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
it's at the edges and hareton's to be

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.670 
it's at the edges and hareton's to be
shorter<00:03:18.579> around<00:03:18.850> the<00:03:18.970> edges<00:03:19.360> so<00:03:20.019> sometimes<00:03:20.500> it

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
shorter around the edges so sometimes it

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.069 
shorter around the edges so sometimes it
tapers<00:03:21.160> down<00:03:21.190> this<00:03:21.670> way<00:03:21.940> so<00:03:22.000> I<00:03:22.299> usually<00:03:22.810> cut

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:23.079 
tapers down this way so I usually cut

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:26.280 
tapers down this way so I usually cut
like<00:03:23.380> that<00:03:24.000> just<00:03:25.000> so<00:03:25.150> I<00:03:25.180> can<00:03:25.239> get<00:03:25.600> all<00:03:25.900> those

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
like that just so I can get all those

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:35.260 
like that just so I can get all those
little<00:03:26.560> hairs

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:35.270 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:37.810 

I'll<00:03:35.840> just<00:03:36.170> twist<00:03:36.680> it<00:03:36.890> and<00:03:37.160> kind<00:03:37.700> of<00:03:37.730> just

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 
I'll just twist it and kind of just

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.760 
I'll just twist it and kind of just
leave<00:03:38.510> it<00:03:38.660> right<00:03:38.840> through<00:03:39.020> this<00:03:39.170> twisted<00:03:39.650> it

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:39.770 
leave it right through this twisted it

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:41.110 
leave it right through this twisted it
should<00:03:39.950> stay<00:03:40.130> away<00:03:40.310> from<00:03:40.640> the<00:03:40.730> rest<00:03:40.910> of<00:03:41.060> the

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
should stay away from the rest of the

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.270 
should stay away from the rest of the
hair<00:03:41.300> as<00:03:41.840> you<00:03:42.080> can<00:03:42.260> see<00:03:42.440> here<00:03:42.770> there's<00:03:43.070> this

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
hair as you can see here there's this

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.270 
hair as you can see here there's this
really<00:03:43.760> short<00:03:44.180> section<00:03:45.080> this<00:03:46.040> is<00:03:46.100> where

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
really short section this is where

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.300 
really short section this is where
summer<00:03:46.850> cut<00:03:47.360> her<00:03:47.600> hair<00:03:47.870> she<00:03:48.830> cut<00:03:48.980> it<00:03:49.100> to<00:03:49.280> about

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
summer cut her hair she cut it to about

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.490 
summer cut her hair she cut it to about
right<00:03:50.000> here<00:03:50.330> so<00:03:50.630> it's<00:03:50.810> growing<00:03:51.050> out<00:03:51.200> quite<00:03:51.470> a

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
right here so it's growing out quite a

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.950 
right here so it's growing out quite a
bit<00:03:51.740> it's<00:03:51.890> almost<00:03:51.980> down<00:03:52.370> to<00:03:52.550> this<00:03:52.670> length<00:03:53.030> the

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:53.960 
bit it's almost down to this length the

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.690 
bit it's almost down to this length the
last<00:03:54.200> time<00:03:54.440> I<00:03:54.560> trimmed<00:03:54.860> her<00:03:54.980> hair<00:03:55.160> I<00:03:55.190> did<00:03:55.460> more
