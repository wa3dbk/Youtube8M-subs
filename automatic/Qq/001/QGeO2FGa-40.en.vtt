as<00:00:19.380> I<00:00:19.980> pointed<00:00:20.279> out<00:00:20.369> before<00:00:20.430> they<00:00:20.850> do<00:00:20.910> things<00:00:21.240> a

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
as I pointed out before they do things a

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.150

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
a rollover accident you don't have very

junkyard and parted out but apparently

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.119 
junkyard and parted out but apparently
that<00:00:37.020> wasn't<00:00:37.230> going<00:00:37.440> to<00:00:37.500> be<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.710> case<00:00:37.860> for

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
that wasn't going to be the case for

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.819 
that wasn't going to be the case for
this<00:00:38.370> vehicle<00:00:39.200> I'm<00:00:40.200> not<00:00:40.410> sure<00:00:40.559> what<00:00:40.710> it<00:00:40.800> is

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
this vehicle I'm not sure what it is

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.740 
this vehicle I'm not sure what it is
about<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.610> final<00:00:41.879> phase<00:00:42.059> of<00:00:42.090> riding<00:00:42.690> a

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
about the final phase of riding a

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.299 
about the final phase of riding a

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
vehicle back on its wheels after it's

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.190 
vehicle back on its wheels after it's
been<00:00:44.520> flipped<00:00:44.850> like<00:00:45.000> this<00:00:45.210> one<00:00:45.390> but<00:00:46.020> there's

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
been flipped like this one but there's

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.779 
been flipped like this one but there's
always<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:46.440> great<00:00:46.739> deal<00:00:46.920> of<00:00:46.950> suspense<00:00:47.460> as<00:00:47.670> you

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
always a great deal of suspense as you

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.299 
always a great deal of suspense as you
wait<00:00:48.059> for<00:00:48.300> it<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.480> reach<00:00:48.690> that<00:00:48.930> final<00:00:49.320> tipping

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
wait for it to reach that final tipping

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.160 
wait for it to reach that final tipping
point<00:00:50.640> where<00:00:50.879> it<00:00:51.030> falls<00:00:51.270> over<00:00:51.510> back<00:00:51.870> on<00:00:52.020> its

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
point where it falls over back on its

00:00:52.170 --> 00:01:03.590 
point where it falls over back on its
wheels<00:01:01.670> well<00:01:02.670> there<00:01:02.850> it<00:01:02.940> is<00:01:02.969> this<00:01:03.300> is<00:01:03.449> that

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
wheels well there it is this is that

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.880 
wheels well there it is this is that
point<00:01:03.809> where<00:01:03.930> you'd<00:01:04.140> assume<00:01:04.379> they'd<00:01:04.589> hook<00:01:04.739> up

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
point where you'd assume they'd hook up

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.320 
point where you'd assume they'd hook up
a<00:01:04.979> tow<00:01:05.159> truck<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.430> it<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:05.820> hauled<00:01:05.970> it<00:01:06.060> away<00:01:06.270> but

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
a tow truck to it and hauled it away but

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.390 
a tow truck to it and hauled it away but
that<00:01:06.990> isn't<00:01:07.290> what<00:01:07.380> happened<00:01:07.409> I<00:01:07.799> was<00:01:07.979> chatting

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
that isn't what happened I was chatting

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.250 
that isn't what happened I was chatting
with<00:01:08.580> somebody<00:01:08.790> there<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.390> I<00:01:09.720> started

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
with somebody there and I started

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.929 
with somebody there and I started
hearing<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.680> engine<00:01:11.040> turn<00:01:11.220> over<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:11.670> I

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
hearing the engine turn over and I

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.399 
hearing the engine turn over and I
didn't<00:01:12.360> put<00:01:12.479> it<00:01:12.540> together<00:01:12.630> right<00:01:12.960> away<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.260> I

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
didn't put it together right away and I

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:14.750 
didn't put it together right away and I
realized<00:01:13.740> they<00:01:13.920> were<00:01:13.979> trying<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.340> start<00:01:14.610> it

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
realized they were trying to start it

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.850 
realized they were trying to start it
and<00:01:14.880> lo<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:15.509> behold<00:01:15.659> sheep<00:01:16.229> turned<00:01:16.530> over

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
and lo and behold sheep turned over

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.340 
and lo and behold sheep turned over
though<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.759> truck<00:01:18.060> was<00:01:18.210> certainly<00:01:18.509> bent<00:01:19.080> in

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
though the truck was certainly bent in

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.140 
though the truck was certainly bent in
the<00:01:19.470> rollover<00:01:19.799> ride<00:01:20.220> seemed<00:01:20.610> that<00:01:20.759> she<00:01:21.000> was

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
the rollover ride seemed that she was

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.850 
the rollover ride seemed that she was
mostly<00:01:21.450> intact<00:01:21.869> as<00:01:22.080> you<00:01:22.200> can<00:01:22.320> tell<00:01:22.470> she<00:01:22.500> still

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
mostly intact as you can tell she still

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.100 
mostly intact as you can tell she still
looks<00:01:23.100> like<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.310> truck<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:24.479> hood<00:01:24.630> latch<00:01:24.780> still

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
looks like a truck the hood latch still

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.990 
looks like a truck the hood latch still
works<00:01:25.290> even<00:01:25.530> though<00:01:25.650> glass<00:01:26.100> is<00:01:26.340> intact<00:01:26.700> it'd

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
works even though glass is intact it'd

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.190 
works even though glass is intact it'd
be<00:01:27.150> interesting<00:01:27.570> to<00:01:27.689> know<00:01:27.720> whether<00:01:28.020> or<00:01:28.140> not

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
be interesting to know whether or not

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.050 
be interesting to know whether or not
they<00:01:28.470> put<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.860> truck<00:01:29.070> back<00:01:29.100> into<00:01:29.610> service<00:01:29.820> or

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
they put the truck back into service or

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.609 
they put the truck back into service or
not<00:01:30.210> or<00:01:30.390> how<00:01:30.509> much<00:01:30.630> they<00:01:30.840> had<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.079> spend<00:01:31.320> on<00:01:31.500> her

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
not or how much they had to spend on her

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.730 
not or how much they had to spend on her
but<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:32.729> point<00:01:33.000> is<00:01:33.180> after<00:01:33.689> a<00:01:33.930> rollover<00:01:34.170> they

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
but the point is after a rollover they

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.859 
but the point is after a rollover they
