00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:10.679
 welcome little boy apple video blog 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.780
 here we come with a last fast 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.549
 video before leaving to leave for 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.770
 brighton a week as I said 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.750
 in the last video I made my own 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.730
 yesterday I published the other one yesterday 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.880
 Yesterday depends on the top video 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.189
 ten silvia tricks of February and in 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.570
 this very short video is not too long 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.810
 just dwell on some things 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.969
 important and I want to talk about iphone if 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.010
 I had also talked about it in the sewers 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.570
 I had done three weeks ago but now 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.420
 I want to go into more detail considering that 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.100
 yes, some images have been leaked 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.290
 also other news that could make you 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.890
 pleasure that wanders maybe you don't have yet 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:49.469
 got to see and comment 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.879
 so let's start immediately to see some 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.000
 image comes because the mans of that 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.440
 have been presented seem really 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.300
 very realistic, however, as we see later 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.770
 there is something wrong 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.480
 then we immediately see the first image 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.550
 first of all, what we notice from this 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.049
 new iphone that have been denied i 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.270
 previous rumors that said not 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.010
 there would have been a frame not 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.500
 they were thinking of an iphone with a screen 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.880
 that completely filled the wall 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.790
 obviously leaving the edges under and 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.799
 above but going to remove the parts 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.409
 right outside here in white you see 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.820
 in the image they remained therefore for 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.369
 reasons your safety hands because 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.220
 according to me with an iphone without on board 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.890
 promises it would be easier maybe 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.150
 break the screen screen but yes 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:35.729
 rumor can be made of sapphire crystal 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:37.439
 sapphire I do n't know from zafiro shooting because yes 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.780
 says that maybe it can be maybe not 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.729
 because this glass would be super 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.619
 existing would constitute a let's say one 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.899
 revolution is already present in fact 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.320
 pd camera other in the lens of 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.759
 iphone 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.960
 ce and stewed really the screen 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.490
 it would be a step forward because not 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.079
 you don't even need to buy anymore 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.390
 films or things like that for 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:57.450
 protect the screen because it would be in 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.280
 grace bile we can say is however of another 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.770
 many say they could not 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.479
 put it because the costs would come 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.250
 to the stars I understand well if we do it 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.750
 a dot so small but if it is 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.280
 we make in all the glass screen in 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.349
 so sapphire should really cost 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.630
 a lot, however, may be that there 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.010
 something like that happens 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.630
 moreover one speaks as regards 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.090
 always the screen of an email of a 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.950
 increase in pixel density than us 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:22.850
 we know very well that in the iphone 5 s 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:25.640
 at 5 we had a density of 326 pixels 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:28.790
 for wins ppi and instead in this iphone 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:31.640
 6 should we have a 441 ppi 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.690
 so we have an increase too 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.700
 screen size 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.430
 obviously as you see also heard yes 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.440
 speaks of a 4.7-inch version e 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.480
 another version even bigger than that 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.600
 would be a fable of sorts 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:48.380
 intermezzo from tablet is a phon of a 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:50.510
 iphone 5.5 then it would be 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.190
 really a kind of galaxy note then 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.390
 would go a little to emulate what 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:53.960
 they have previously done what they have 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.660
 done 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.460
 samsung but let's see others 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.320
 images that we can see better 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:01.880
 also the rear bodywork 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.440
 now they are covered by a kind of 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.350
 plastic and there are really many 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.210
 footprints that could be one 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:10.700
 film also a lack of processing 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:12.230
 of the display is probably you should 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.300
 there is a film on it as we see 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.420
 it was all rounded so we have 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:20.030
 lost and the characteristics of the iPhone 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:22.700
 5 cidere phone of other iphone 4 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.020
 of the square shape of the form 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.940
 rectangular now we have a shape 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:28.010
 more round and for sure it will also come 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.110
 resized bra decreased the thickness 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.280
 of the phone like but we will also see a 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.170
 increase in width x that 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.720
 will correspond to an increase in the display 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.310
 as we said another thing 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.750
 we can note go ahead then 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.459
 let's see there are pictures of the 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.440
 interior but you don't understand much from 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:44.990
 what we see the double LED flash 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:47.180
 we still see the body a color 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:48.770
 that a color that says nothing and 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.390
 what grayish neutral white 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:51.920
 maybe even a little distorted by the 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.540
 film over there we see 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.840
 continue with the images until 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:58.670
 I want to take you though to a point where 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.920
 we talk about these images that maybe 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:03.110
 they are not as truthful as they can be 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.790
 seem to look right at them 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:06.920
 well 100 percent have also been 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.690
 confirmed by one that I can't remember anymore 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.360
 what's his name from one of those he has 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:12.080
 published the many noises 6 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.610
 previous that you are at the end 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.220
 proved true 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:18.650
 however, we can also see from here 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.960
 just see the whole button 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.100
 concerns the device as far as 

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:24.320
 concerns the thickness in the part 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.850
 below but finally I have to see these 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.400
 images that have been released 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:30.380
 today I don't remember well today 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:33.110
 see that probably these images 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:35.390
 they are fakes in fact who would have created 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.890
 yes country these pictures went to 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:38.479
 cut out went to cut it out 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:40.910
 screen of an ipad that we see with 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:44.210
 these prints are quite obvious 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:46.340
 I would have resized it 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:47.780
 in perspective it is put on this 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.860
 iphone that may have been made with 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.960
 who knows what program I don't know 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:53.540
 it could also be true and has it 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:55.310
 glued up there just like it was 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:57.110
 the screen of this new iphone 6 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.460
 let's see the images here if 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:00.560
 You also want to put them in a 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:03.080
 sails folder I put in description 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:05.240
 we also see the signs of the 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:07.520
 footprints of malformation something 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:10.310
 genre that are present on the screen 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:13.550
 so most likely they could 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:14.750
 be a fake but no one knows I think of 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:17.060
 yes guys 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:19.700
 I think so we are here because I think 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:21.770
 there is also difficult that a person who 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:24.590
 however you also work in china arrivals a 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:25.370
 steal an iphone 6 from it to make some 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:27.800
 such pictures 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:29.810
 Apple for sure will have put checks in place 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:32.150
 anyway guys let me know what 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:34.400
 think below in the comments why 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:36.770
 obviously it's also nice to bring you the 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:38.990
 in the middle of the discussion, maybe discuss it 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.760
 some of you even know 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:42.680
 more than I know for sure 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:44.840
 so we can share some 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.669
 information and see where it will take us 

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:48.380
 apple another one I wanted 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:51.289
 talk to him about release date is not known 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:53.539
 maybe they say that most likely there 

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:56.180
 the publish will publish it 

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:57.590
 they will release in October as it was 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:00.919
 issued in the council then with a 

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:02.810
 year of postponement or maybe a 

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:04.130
 July, June, July, but I see it a lot 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:07.789
 hard that they publish it in June and July 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:10.220
 is another thing I wanted to talk about is you 

00:06:07.789 --> 00:06:12.500
 the insertion by apple of a 

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:14.150
 facial recognition system 

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:16.940
 movements a kind of thing we have 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:19.280
 also saw the samsung galaxy s 4 

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:21.740
 galaxy s 4 however expanded so that 

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:23.390
 maybe or actually we can 

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.860
 unlock the device even with a 

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:27.110
 I had said facial recognition 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:29.180
 also in the other video and this could 

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:31.580
 be confirmed by the fact that apple has 

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:33.530
 purchased the company earlier 

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:35.580
 chose which is right 

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:37.260
 a company that has also worked for 

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:39.480
 regarding the development of the kinect 

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:41.280
 for the xbox so let's see right 

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:43.050
 this recognition of movements e 

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:45.270
 who knows what news could never be 

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:47.250
 Another concept was introduced that I have 

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:49.650
 seen here being this cocer puts 

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:51.330
 not true iphone 6 is this new 

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:52.320
 image I just found in the bomb 

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:53.940
 of view 

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:56.370
 if it were so it would be really nice but 

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:57.690
 I see it really hard though a screen 

00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:00.000
 bigger and in my opinion for the iphone 

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:01.800
 boys would be better as given in 

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.780
 comments make a nice comment with 

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:05.640
 written if which version maybe 

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:07.260
 you might like to want to hold 

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:09.060
 the 4-inch version if you like it 

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:12.420
 the smaller one 3.5 or if you want 

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:14.190
 that also apple goes to land towards 

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:17.040
 a bigger screen and even 

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:19.950
 up to 5.5 inches and maybe maybe 

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:22.350
 be a more useful solution for many 

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:24.720
 users to me for sure one more screen 

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:28.200
 large than the 4-inch one would be 

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:29.760
 really appreciated in my opinion also not 5.5 

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:32.280
 because it would become a thing up 

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:33.990
 unmanageable in my opinion but in 4.7 

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:36.150
 it would be really great 

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:37.560
 guys let me know in the comments if 

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:39.240
 the video you liked was a video 

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:41.040
 short more informative calculations and put it 

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:42.960
 nei throws it into the categories of 

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:44.520
 apple user I haven't told you about 

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:46.500
 contents inside hardware because of 

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:47.580
 sure there will be a general expansion 

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:50.130
 as we have seen in the other versions 

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:52.710
 and nothing new at all 

00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:53.910
 fundamental as regards the for 

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:57.030
 regarding the internal components 

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:58.890
 however the less I like the ds there is 

00:07:57.030 --> 00:08:00.900
 liked and not see each other in one 

00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:03.420
 week when I come back from brighton 

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:05.040
 look at the last episode of the top either 

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:06.570
 tricks because there really are gods 

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:08.640
 beautiful clicks if I do it anyway 

00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:10.470
 many others that will illustrate you 

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:11.250
 lots of new applications worthy of 

00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:12.870
 Note 

00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:15.860
 see you guys in an upcoming video 

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:15.860
 full salute dario up
