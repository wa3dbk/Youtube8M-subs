00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:30.759 
that takes these things into account

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:32.819 
that takes these things into account
such<00:00:31.660> as<00:00:31.689> number<00:00:32.439> one

00:00:32.819 --> 00:00:32.829 
such as number one

door lock number two that locks for the
actual<00:00:39.519> feeders<00:00:40.420> can<00:00:41.140> the<00:00:41.260> birds<00:00:41.410> open<00:00:41.890> those

00:00:42.029 --> 00:00:42.039 
actual feeders can the birds open those

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:44.279 
actual feeders can the birds open those
feeders<00:00:42.340> and<00:00:42.789> not<00:00:43.090> only<00:00:43.210> empty<00:00:43.690> the<00:00:43.809> cups<00:00:44.050> on

00:00:44.279 --> 00:00:44.289 
feeders and not only empty the cups on

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:47.069 
feeders and not only empty the cups on
the<00:00:44.410> ground<00:00:44.649> or<00:00:45.339> escape<00:00:46.120> those<00:00:46.660> are<00:00:46.839> two

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:47.079 
the ground or escape those are two

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:49.740 
the ground or escape those are two
really<00:00:47.620> important<00:00:48.370> factors<00:00:48.730> to<00:00:48.760> look<00:00:48.940> at<00:00:49.239> the

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:49.750 
really important factors to look at the

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.560 
really important factors to look at the
third<00:00:50.079> thing<00:00:50.320> is<00:00:50.589> do<00:00:51.219> the<00:00:51.370> feeders<00:00:51.760> have<00:00:52.510> a

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.570 
third thing is do the feeders have a

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.110 
third thing is do the feeders have a
system<00:00:53.109> so<00:00:53.410> that<00:00:53.440> the<00:00:53.890> mess<00:00:54.100> is<00:00:54.249> contained<00:00:54.820> are

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.120 
system so that the mess is contained are

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:55.709 
system so that the mess is contained are
they

00:00:55.709 --> 00:00:55.719 
they

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:58.110 
they
open<00:00:56.199> behind<00:00:56.379> it<00:00:56.710> with<00:00:56.829> just<00:00:57.070> bars<00:00:57.399> which

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120 
open behind it with just bars which

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.250 
open behind it with just bars which
means<00:00:58.390> that<00:00:58.539> you're<00:00:58.659> going<00:00:58.839> to<00:00:58.899> have<00:00:59.050> more

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
means that you're going to have more

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.220 
means that you're going to have more
mess<00:00:59.920> around<00:01:00.339> the<00:01:00.460> cage<00:01:00.699> another<00:01:01.510> thing<00:01:01.780> to

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.230 
mess around the cage another thing to

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:03.750 
mess around the cage another thing to
consider<00:01:02.350> is<00:01:02.800> something<00:01:03.129> called<00:01:03.309> a<00:01:03.399> skirt

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 
consider is something called a skirt

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.580 
consider is something called a skirt
it's<00:01:04.570> not<00:01:04.690> what<00:01:04.839> you<00:01:04.930> wear<00:01:05.110> it's<00:01:05.379> what<00:01:05.500> the

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
it's not what you wear it's what the

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.640 
it's not what you wear it's what the
cage<00:01:05.800> wears<00:01:06.100> so<00:01:07.000> it's<00:01:07.360> a<00:01:07.510> piece<00:01:07.690> of<00:01:07.720> metal<00:01:07.960> that

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.650 
cage wears so it's a piece of metal that

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.100 
cage wears so it's a piece of metal that
angles<00:01:09.070> around<00:01:09.340> the<00:01:09.460> cage<00:01:09.700> comes<00:01:10.420> usually<00:01:10.720> up

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
angles around the cage comes usually up

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.050 
angles around the cage comes usually up
around<00:01:11.439> four<00:01:11.860> inches<00:01:12.009> and<00:01:12.369> out<00:01:12.460> about<00:01:12.729> two<00:01:12.909> or

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
around four inches and out about two or

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.530 
around four inches and out about two or
three<00:01:13.090> inches<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:15.220> that<00:01:15.520> does<00:01:15.820> catch<00:01:16.210> a<00:01:16.390> lot

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.540 
three inches and that does catch a lot

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.719 
three inches and that does catch a lot
of<00:01:16.570> the<00:01:16.950> food<00:01:17.950> that<00:01:17.979> the<00:01:18.220> parrot<00:01:18.460> will<00:01:18.549> throw

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:18.729 
of the food that the parrot will throw

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:22.709 
of the food that the parrot will throw
out<00:01:18.939> not<00:01:19.720> all<00:01:19.750> of<00:01:20.049> it<00:01:20.200> it<00:01:20.350> helps<00:01:21.540> personally<00:01:22.540> I

00:01:22.709 --> 00:01:22.719 
out not all of it it helps personally I

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:24.539 
out not all of it it helps personally I
don't<00:01:22.899> like<00:01:23.079> them<00:01:23.409> I'm<00:01:23.799> always<00:01:24.070> bumping<00:01:24.430> into

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:24.549 
don't like them I'm always bumping into

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:26.819 
don't like them I'm always bumping into
them<00:01:24.700> with<00:01:24.790> my<00:01:24.909> knees<00:01:25.119> I<00:01:25.420> just<00:01:26.350> you<00:01:26.500> don't<00:01:26.649> see

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:26.829 
them with my knees I just you don't see

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:28.020 
them with my knees I just you don't see
them<00:01:26.979> they're<00:01:27.130> below<00:01:27.340> your<00:01:27.490> eye<00:01:27.520> level<00:01:27.790> so

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
them they're below your eye level so

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.139 
them they're below your eye level so
it's<00:01:28.689> better<00:01:28.869> to<00:01:28.930> try<00:01:29.200> to<00:01:29.259> have<00:01:29.530> a<00:01:29.860> cage<00:01:30.790> that's

00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:31.149 
it's better to try to have a cage that's

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:32.969 
it's better to try to have a cage that's
designed<00:01:31.570> with<00:01:32.020> better<00:01:32.200> Cup<00:01:32.500> and<00:01:32.740> a<00:01:32.829> better

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
designed with better Cup and a better

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:34.950 
designed with better Cup and a better
feeding<00:01:33.369> system<00:01:33.729> rather<00:01:34.270> than<00:01:34.479> relying<00:01:34.750> on

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
feeding system rather than relying on

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.010 
feeding system rather than relying on
the<00:01:35.170> skirts<00:01:35.469> of<00:01:35.649> the<00:01:35.740> cage<00:01:36.539> another<00:01:37.539> thing<00:01:37.750> to

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
the skirts of the cage another thing to

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.260 
the skirts of the cage another thing to
take<00:01:38.170> into<00:01:38.380> account<00:01:38.710> is<00:01:38.950> the<00:01:39.909> bird<00:01:40.060> that<00:01:40.090> you

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
take into account is the bird that you

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.870 
take into account is the bird that you
have<00:01:40.509> and<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:42.280> bar<00:01:42.460> spacing<00:01:43.020> for<00:01:44.020> instance

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
have and the bar spacing for instance

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.010 
have and the bar spacing for instance
birds<00:01:45.880> as<00:01:46.090> you<00:01:46.119> probably<00:01:46.329> realize<00:01:46.600> to<00:01:46.930> have

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
birds as you probably realize to have

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.600 
birds as you probably realize to have
eyes<00:01:47.500> on<00:01:47.560> the<00:01:47.860> side<00:01:48.039> of<00:01:48.159> their<00:01:48.280> head<00:01:48.399> not<00:01:48.549> in

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
eyes on the side of their head not in

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.029 
eyes on the side of their head not in
the<00:01:48.729> front<00:01:48.939> of<00:01:49.000> their<00:01:49.060> head<00:01:49.210> like<00:01:49.240> we<00:01:49.509> do<00:01:49.659> so<00:01:50.039> if

00:01:51.029 --> 00:01:51.039 
the front of their head like we do so if

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:53.789 
the front of their head like we do so if
you<00:01:51.070> can<00:01:51.430> imagine<00:01:51.670> the<00:01:52.149> bar<00:01:52.329> spacing<00:01:52.799> being

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:53.799 
you can imagine the bar spacing being

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:57.149 
you can imagine the bar spacing being
smaller<00:01:54.270> than<00:01:55.270> the<00:01:55.420> birds<00:01:55.600> eyes<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.950> birds

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
to stick its head out and then maybe if

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.599 
to stick its head out and then maybe if
it<00:02:05.259> worked<00:02:05.469> to<00:02:05.649> get<00:02:05.770> its<00:02:05.890> head<00:02:06.039> out<00:02:06.189> twist

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:06.609 
it worked to get its head out twist

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:09.180 
it worked to get its head out twist
sideways<00:02:07.119> and<00:02:07.420> hang<00:02:07.570> itself<00:02:07.929> so<00:02:08.770> it's<00:02:08.920> really

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
sideways and hang itself so it's really

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.160 
sideways and hang itself so it's really
important<00:02:09.640> to<00:02:09.789> get<00:02:09.910> a<00:02:09.970> cage<00:02:10.300> that<00:02:10.840> the<00:02:10.990> bird

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
important to get a cage that the bird

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.170 
important to get a cage that the bird
cannot<00:02:11.560> stick<00:02:12.040> its<00:02:12.310> head<00:02:12.460> through<00:02:12.820> the<00:02:12.970> bars

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:20.340 
dictated by the eyes the second thing
that's<00:02:19.660> important<00:02:20.140> too

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
that's important too

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.160 
that's important too
lies<00:02:20.530> is<00:02:20.800> how<00:02:21.430> big<00:02:21.700> your<00:02:21.850> birds<00:02:22.060> wingspan<00:02:22.900> is

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
lies is how big your birds wingspan is

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.260 
lies is how big your birds wingspan is
you<00:02:23.980> always<00:02:24.130> want<00:02:24.280> the<00:02:24.610> bird<00:02:24.790> to<00:02:24.820> be<00:02:25.030> able<00:02:25.120> to

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
you always want the bird to be able to

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.540 
you always want the bird to be able to
open<00:02:25.600> up<00:02:25.720> the<00:02:25.930> wings<00:02:26.140> inside<00:02:26.890> the<00:02:27.040> cage<00:02:27.280> and

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
open up the wings inside the cage and

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.090 
open up the wings inside the cage and
then<00:02:28.030> some<00:02:28.360> so<00:02:28.990> if<00:02:29.110> you<00:02:29.230> have<00:02:29.320> a<00:02:29.380> large<00:02:29.650> macaw

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
then some so if you have a large macaw

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.310 
then some so if you have a large macaw
the<00:02:30.940> minimum<00:02:31.390> cage<00:02:31.600> you<00:02:31.750> should<00:02:31.900> be<00:02:32.020> looking

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
the minimum cage you should be looking

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.680 
the minimum cage you should be looking
at<00:02:32.440> is<00:02:32.650> 40<00:02:33.070> inches<00:02:33.220> across<00:02:33.820> because<00:02:34.540> the

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
at is 40 inches across because the

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.500 
at is 40 inches across because the
wingspan<00:02:35.080> could<00:02:35.470> easily<00:02:35.710> be<00:02:36.100> 3<00:02:36.760> feet<00:02:36.970> and<00:02:37.180> that

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
wingspan could easily be 3 feet and that

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
wingspan could easily be 3 feet and that
only<00:02:37.600> gives<00:02:37.810> them<00:02:37.900> a<00:02:37.990> you<00:02:38.200> know<00:02:38.290> a<00:02:38.320> couple

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
only gives them a you know a couple

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.140 
only gives them a you know a couple
inches<00:02:38.710> on<00:02:38.890> each<00:02:39.010> side<00:02:39.040> but<00:02:39.730> it<00:02:39.820> does<00:02:39.940> allow

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
inches on each side but it does allow

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.540 
inches on each side but it does allow
them<00:02:40.360> to<00:02:40.480> at<00:02:40.570> least<00:02:40.600> open<00:02:41.050> up<00:02:41.170> their<00:02:41.350> wings<00:02:41.550> the

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
them to at least open up their wings the

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.280 
them to at least open up their wings the
third<00:02:42.820> thing<00:02:43.060> to<00:02:43.090> consider<00:02:43.210> is<00:02:43.630> the<00:02:43.780> material

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
third thing to consider is the material

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:45.810 
third thing to consider is the material
and<00:02:44.500> that<00:02:44.920> has<00:02:45.160> to<00:02:45.280> do<00:02:45.400> with<00:02:45.490> your<00:02:45.640> budget

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
and that has to do with your budget

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.490 
and that has to do with your budget
because<00:02:46.510> stainless<00:02:46.780> steel<00:02:46.990> is<00:02:47.170> the<00:02:47.320> most

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
because stainless steel is the most

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.500 
because stainless steel is the most
expensive<00:02:47.830> now<00:02:48.640> that<00:02:48.820> making<00:02:49.060> nice<00:02:49.210> aluminum

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
expensive now that making nice aluminum

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.230 
expensive now that making nice aluminum
cages<00:02:50.050> which<00:02:50.230> are<00:02:50.470> less<00:02:50.890> expensive<00:02:51.250> and<00:02:51.610> then

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.240 
cages which are less expensive and then

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.270 
cages which are less expensive and then
you<00:02:52.390> have<00:02:52.570> the<00:02:52.840> powder<00:02:53.050> coated<00:02:53.440> cages<00:02:53.860> which

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
you have the powder coated cages which

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.490 
you have the powder coated cages which
are<00:02:54.430> the<00:02:54.520> least<00:02:54.700> expensive<00:02:55.240> so<00:02:56.170> you<00:02:56.200> want<00:02:56.440> to

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
are the least expensive so you want to

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.290 
are the least expensive so you want to
determine<00:02:56.890> what<00:02:57.010> your<00:02:57.130> budget<00:02:57.280> is<00:02:57.550> what<00:02:58.210> you

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
determine what your budget is what you

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.140 
determine what your budget is what you
can<00:02:58.450> handle<00:02:58.690> and<00:02:59.550> what's<00:03:00.550> going<00:03:00.730> to<00:03:00.790> work<00:03:00.940> well

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
can handle and what's going to work well

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.360 
can handle and what's going to work well
with<00:03:01.180> you<00:03:01.360> with<00:03:01.510> those<00:03:01.630> three<00:03:01.900> things<00:03:02.370> another

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
with you with those three things another

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.160 
with you with those three things another
element<00:03:03.760> of<00:03:03.850> the<00:03:03.940> cage<00:03:04.150> is<00:03:04.300> very<00:03:04.510> important<00:03:05.020> is

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
element of the cage is very important is

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.650 
element of the cage is very important is
whether<00:03:05.740> or<00:03:05.890> not<00:03:06.040> it<00:03:06.490> has<00:03:06.700> a<00:03:06.730> grill<00:03:07.060> which<00:03:07.510> it

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
whether or not it has a grill which it

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.980 
whether or not it has a grill which it
should<00:03:07.930> it<00:03:08.770> has<00:03:09.580> a<00:03:09.610> tray<00:03:09.970> which<00:03:10.450> it<00:03:10.600> should<00:03:10.810> and

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:10.990 
should it has a tray which it should and

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.040 
should it has a tray which it should and
both<00:03:11.890> are<00:03:12.100> easily<00:03:12.310> removable<00:03:13.180> because<00:03:13.780> you

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.050 
both are easily removable because you

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:15.360 
both are easily removable because you
want<00:03:14.230> to<00:03:14.290> be<00:03:14.380> able<00:03:14.440> to<00:03:14.560> take<00:03:14.800> the<00:03:14.920> grill<00:03:15.190> out

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
want to be able to take the grill out

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.760 
want to be able to take the grill out
and<00:03:15.400> clean<00:03:16.000> it<00:03:16.120> every<00:03:16.330> day<00:03:16.510> the<00:03:17.320> same<00:03:17.500> with<00:03:17.680> the

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:17.770 
and clean it every day the same with the

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:19.530 
and clean it every day the same with the
tray<00:03:18.010> the<00:03:18.550> tray<00:03:18.580> you<00:03:18.790> want<00:03:19.000> to<00:03:19.060> take<00:03:19.210> out<00:03:19.420> and
