00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:01.770
I would like you to tell us

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:01.363
What are we doing here?

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:03.270
You're here for the first episode

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.830
Of « cook it if you can »

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:07.143
You're going to order what you want

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:09.710
And I'll cook the same

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:11.110
Here, in this kitchen

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:13.860
And it must be ready

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:14.260
Before the deliveryman arrives

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:16.526
It's complicated

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.460
Big pressure

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:20.720
Tonight it's pizza

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:22.776
« Come for the price,

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:24.776
come back for the quality »

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.426
You say that often right?

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.710
They never come back!

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:34.040
6€50 but « seniors »

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:35.130
so it's only for old people

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.830
So you're not allowed, but I can!

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:40.696
7€50 for delivery

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.146
For senior pizza

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:42.613
When you order 2 pizzas

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:43.850
So you have to cook two, can you?

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:46.200
So I'll cook you two pizzas!

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.750
If it's as beautiful and good

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:53.950
As in this picture

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.646
I think we can pick up a stomach bug.

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:58.710
Hello sir,

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.180
We would like to order two pizzas

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:02.910
A Bianca,

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.550
Sour cream, cheese, lardon, onions, potatoes and marjoram

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.280
And a Mona Lisa

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:12.516
Tomatoes, cheese, jam, mushrooms, marjoram,

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.976
Thank you, see you later.

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:16.976
How fast can you deliver?

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.330
In 30 minutes

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:18.483
30 minutes it's perfect

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.550
Thank you sir,

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:21.380
Top Let's go !

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:22.800
See you, Thank's !

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.110
I'm doing the pizza dough

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:27.510
It's like bread dough

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:29.513
Flour, yeast and water,

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:31.310
It costs 10ct

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.950
I added marjoram and pepper

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.013
We can add what we want

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:37.480
Tomato..

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:38.736
A homemade pizza

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.846
How much does it cost?

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.180
It costs 4€

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:45.630
And cooking impressed men!

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:46.630
Is it ready?

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:48.750
In five minutes

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.713
Stop acting like a presenter!

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:51.246
"Is it ready? Tiffany, what are you doing?"

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:53.480
This tomato sauce looks delicious

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.380
You order a pizza without tomato,

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.310
So you'll content yourself with your pizza!

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.870
I will content myself with what I want!

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.083
I'm gonna eat what I want!

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.413
Who's in Top Chef tonight?

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.280
For the ex-candidate

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.446
They took two per seasons

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.110
My favorites were Pierre Augé

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.643
Tiffany and your nickmane was "pupuce"

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.483
Please, not "pupuce"

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:16.153
It looks like a dog's name

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.600
It was awful

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:18.900
"where is the pupuce?"

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.700
"My little pupuce"

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.380
Will the little boy, who was great, going to participate?

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.396
Ruben is going to be here

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.230
Ruben we love him!

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.710
We like him

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.150
He's great

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.653
You were like is godmother in Top Chef

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:32.113
We weren't in the same season

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.780
You learnt something tonight

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.930
We laugh, but Tiffany finished the two pizzas

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.000
Yes, totally

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:48.580
What's that?

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:49.376
It's bruschetta, it's an appetizer

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:52.510
Because the deliveryman is taking its time

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:52.776
What a show-off!

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:54.083
The guy is not here and you made

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:55.420
Two pizzas and three bruschettas!

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.280
In 25 minutes!

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.446
What a commentator!

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.280
"Everything's fine

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:03.510
How do  you feel Tiffany?

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:04.643
What did you do?"

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:06.750
The doorbell!

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:07.750
I'm going

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:09.550
Stop! Stop!

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:10.880
Stop he's here!

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.380
15€ right?

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:12.290
Yes!

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:13.480
Awesome

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:14.480
Stop!

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:15.250
You're going to be eliminated!

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:17.710
I'm removing the dish

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:18.976
Thank you! Bye !

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:21.400
SO...

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:27.900
Let's make a jingle for Tiffany

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.710
One, two, three

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:30.843
Tasting! Tasting!

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.350
My tastiiiiing

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:37.600
Is it you we're tasting?

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:38.000
Yes

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.300
No it's pizza, I prefer pizza!

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:43.400
Wait!

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.110
One, two, three

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:46.910
Damn, it's steak and fries!

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.913
And you made Bruschetta

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.813
How do we say it?

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.080
Bruschetta

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.780
Additionally, it's good!

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:57.200
There's no comparison

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.430
I haven't eat enough recently

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:00.030
After "La galette des rois"

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:00.713
New year's eve and Christmas!

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.146
And the slices are small!

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.983
So we have to eat it in 20 minutes?

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:08.910
It's tepid...

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:11.230
It's inedible

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:12.763
No it's junk food

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:14.786
Yes it's what your order for your friend

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:15.290
When you want them to leave

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:17.470
I'm trying ours

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:19.910
Look at the ham,

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:20.910
she made a rose

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:21.910
It's beautiful

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:23.513
Can we make a close-up?

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.500
At what point do you want to eat this one?

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:29.313
Maybe it's not good!

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.746
But at least it's beautiful!

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.380
Delicious

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:33.050
I might say it's very gourmet!

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:34.000
It's gourmet and crusty!

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.200
It's gourmet and crusty!

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.100
It's crunchy!

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:38.000
I think it's very good!

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.100
It's a success

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.000
It's very tasty

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Well handed

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000
It's delicious

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000
With candied onion

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.430
I want to rub my face with it

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.000
I want be in a Facebook relationship with this pizza

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:58.780

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.150
You met the challenge!

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.350
First successful challenge!

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:05.150

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:05.980
Pizza were good

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:05.913
And better than the others

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.246
Even if it wasn't that hard!

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:11.443
Visually it was way better

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:14.110
And it was tastier

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:15.350
So what's next?

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:17.016
It was the starter right?

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:17.446
Hamburger maybe?

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:18.280
Why not !

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:19.580
Cook a burger, okay,

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:20.913
Everyone can cook it

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.706
But in so little time!

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:23.580
I can

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:24.106
Before the delivery man, better

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:25.600

Tiffany's channel
