attack something like that was just this

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.300 
attack something like that was just this
is<00:04:25.450> something<00:04:25.810> I<00:04:25.870> wasn't<00:04:26.200> used<00:04:26.440> to<00:04:26.590> and<00:04:27.250> I

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
is something I wasn't used to and I

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.100 
is something I wasn't used to and I
played<00:04:27.550> around<00:04:27.820> it<00:04:28.060> because<00:04:28.210> I<00:04:28.570> was<00:04:28.660> like<00:04:28.780> okay

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
played around it because I was like okay

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:30.570 
played around it because I was like okay
I<00:04:29.139> first<00:04:29.470> was<00:04:29.590> like<00:04:29.740> you<00:04:29.860> know<00:04:29.979> what<00:04:30.160> since

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:32.169 
he's defensive i would guess that he

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:34.740 
he's defensive i would guess that he
doesn't<00:04:32.440> have<00:04:32.820> max<00:04:33.820> special<00:04:34.180> attack<00:04:34.360> or<00:04:34.570> any
