00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:04.480
 At the start of this episode of Hart, TV has been there in this new one 

00:00:04.479 --> 00:00:07.660
 also had in his extensive comparison test of the ddr3 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.199
 memory modules 

00:00:09.199 --> 00:00:12.529
 a number of friends remained it is nonsense to table with Jack van Gelder 

00:00:12.529 --> 00:00:13.769
 better memory too 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.720
 the computer that looks further towards the stock market but the viewer 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.580
 own memory but last year that is actually almost no part in our 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.470
 pc what so incredibly price wise for the feet was yes premier roads bike 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.669
 put down the price trend of actually what I say so 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:29.890
 average ddr3 set this is king supported 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.330
 van vliet the bank sets the 13 13 33 so we look at the price of one there 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:38.800
 has fluctuated over the past two years that the graph of the aex jesaja 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:39.409
 spokesman 

00:00:39.409 --> 00:00:43.129
 yes i have him it is also all sorts of influences of how many products in the 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:44.149
 market 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:47.979
 the default is for example rumors about a deficit is exaggerated 

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:48.880
 much is 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.090
 it has been a private parish for several years that you say yes 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:56.570
 looks at the fries with the pot April last year April 2009 the prices remained 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.810
 celebrate this year but fall within one year is the price of a factor 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.530
 5 went down 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.460
 and then let what we want also be there at memory manufacturer because me 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.870
 think i have good news for the consumer yes but for the manufacturer money 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.860
 that every day that you must be able to see you can be emptier 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.320
 Are they worth less? Yes, they have twenty citizens on a shadowy solution 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.300
 says years away here too rushes to other markets yes and whatever 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.420
 everything can happen is that for both manufacturers not at all outside 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:24.040
 coming 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.080
 And what is actually a bit on just before the bottom happens is that one of them 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.240
 the most important 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.049
 the chip manufacturer has the German timo boll but that was far from the 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:36.130
 waste tax and the day were based on your profit 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.289
 but you want your investment 4 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:41.829
 which although they still got some loan initially from the German government 

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:44.130
 I just couldn't keep it strong 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.070
 and we just stay completely stopped 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.920
 Heiloo moment that timo was not easy then the question remains 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.070
 the pond other manufacturers of ddr3 chips 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.180
 And those residents in it were scratching the aisles behind the ears of the men 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.470
 what is going on with us also not so good yes I have I had everything 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.760
 dealing with last year's market, manufacturers might have slightly less 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.830
 decreased so that some game has come on the market well it remains one 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.249
 very exciting months and if it is indeed stomach 

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:09.850
 the past year 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.969
 almost doubled on his own at the prices 

00:02:12.969 --> 00:02:16.409
 and the upward trend of those six before April last year 

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:20.109
 say and and a pair from Ghent is bought as your rich man 

00:02:20.679 --> 00:02:24.689
 but the question is whether or not this is the right time to buy data 

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:26.269
 what a somewhat fallen step 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:30.510
 you need the real overclockers so say March 2009 there are more that way 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.499
 It has become terribly expensive that you notice that it is actually everyone 

00:02:33.499 --> 00:02:35.339
 what is more focused on green 

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:38.529
 13 33 and sixteen hundred meeker modules 

00:02:38.529 --> 00:02:41.849
 mattia that are just a bit affordable but you can see it too 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:44.919
 If you have very large buyers research as you say instead of sources 

00:02:44.919 --> 00:02:48.659
 no 2 was accompanied by a vision of passel they actively used the channel one 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:49.809
 second 

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:53.499
 yes because if you say but that I did last year on the according to p 

00:02:53.499 --> 00:02:56.599
 all get enough of people who are wondering about the active mine 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:57.930
 computer has that finds or not 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.010
 yes that question with yes you hardly hear with this everyone is just nice again 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.919
 dude bah I fine 

00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:06.569
 and that was there too and I currently became the largest market 4 gigabytes first 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:11.249
 two times second Dubai DDR3 13 33 or sixteen hundred and there is something here 

00:03:11.249 --> 00:03:12.709
 money on the table 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:16.249
 yes but I did have some sex tested and asked reasonable manufacturers of it 

00:03:16.249 --> 00:03:20.269
 out of control and what should that of different price ranges be 13 33 or 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:24.379
 600 that have fixed but otherwise the men steam on 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:26.109
 what you think is fun 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:29.719
 yes then we get put everything at the expense of van bommel against sweden this this yes 

00:03:29.719 --> 00:03:34.389
 anyway this looking mother of the van gelder turned the computer on to the anyway 

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:39.009
 at simple mode level of daniele and in state that actually just 

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:43.269
 just a steamy afterwards it is always ask maybe it is 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:45.459
 sorry that has never been proven 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:49.289
 it looks nice it looks nice that is why your cupboard has the openwork 

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:52.439
 here a nice expensive computer and sees that it is also supposed to be absolute 

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:55.639
 But we never really correlated that if there is an expensive one 

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:56.869
 player has 

00:03:56.869 --> 00:04:00.070
 that it is therefore better to overclock it 

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:03.350
 usually there is in it and a bit they could let the prices overclockability 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:09.369
 it this corsair dominator gt modules near the test but they also went 

00:04:09.369 --> 00:04:10.129
 the furthest 

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:16.879
 schincariol the op with zeeland 90 greenhouse 2009 it went to 942 megahertz 

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:20.749
 and if there are standard cosmetic i7 and also on the start is just the 

00:04:20.749 --> 00:04:21.599
 ask 

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:24.009
 that marco borsato also always a few 

00:04:24.009 --> 00:04:26.779
 cheap awards that go almost as far 

00:04:26.779 --> 00:04:31.089
 If even just so we have had the sex of Kingston's high 

00:04:31.089 --> 00:04:34.199
 and that is a week earlier in sixteen hundred south 

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:37.330
 but the one that was lean Jaap was two decades more expensive than the cheapest 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.710
 13 33 hits yes that's not bad 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.419
 but you know says in stupid people for its members 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:47.010
 but that option to just up to 900 vvv because of that was for that matter 

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:47.900
 actually 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.699
 among the youth or just as easily overclockable its own only naturally with 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:53.800
 sil 7 came to work 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.050
 and if we price judith Tuesday from the range in terms of price 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.050
 the again three sixteen hundred true then remains the best choice 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:04.120
 but as stated, all test results with all the battles can be returned 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.439
 found in the hearts of many in 2010
