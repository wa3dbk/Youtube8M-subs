it's not like a spreading brush so you

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.680 
it's not like a spreading brush so you
know<00:00:56.430> when<00:00:56.610> you<00:00:56.670> put<00:00:56.850> on<00:00:56.940> powder<00:00:57.149> you<00:00:57.420> have<00:00:57.570> to

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
know when you put on powder you have to

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.959 
know when you put on powder you have to
spread<00:00:57.930> it<00:00:58.109> around<00:00:58.199> right<00:00:58.590> but<00:00:59.190> this<00:00:59.550> is<00:00:59.730> kind

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
spread it around right but this is kind

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.760 
spread it around right but this is kind
of<00:01:00.059> you<00:01:00.239> just<00:01:00.420> kind<00:01:00.809> of<00:01:00.870> DAB<00:01:01.170> in<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:01.559> press<00:01:01.739> it

three<00:01:04.979> bucks<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.519> I<00:01:06.000> just<00:01:06.240> think<00:01:06.390> that's

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
three bucks and I just think that's

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.660

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.300 
ELF if you guys don't know elf products
they<00:01:12.210> are<00:01:12.570> from<00:01:12.930> like<00:01:13.140> a<00:01:13.350> dollar<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:14.010> three

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
they are from like a dollar to three

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.399 
they are from like a dollar to three
dollars<00:01:14.640> other<00:01:15.000> than<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.450> sets<00:01:15.720> maximum

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
dollars other than the sets maximum

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.800 
dollars other than the sets maximum
probably<00:01:16.830> like<00:01:16.979> five<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:18.030> eight<00:01:18.150> dollars<00:01:18.509> but

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
being three dollars is pretty good

pretty good but the only thing that I'm

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:34.940 
pretty good but the only thing that I'm
concerned<00:03:31.050> about<00:03:31.770> is<00:03:32.480> it's<00:03:33.480> not<00:03:34.050> a<00:03:34.110> bronzer<00:03:34.680> it

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
concerned about is it's not a bronzer it

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.100 
concerned about is it's not a bronzer it
says<00:03:35.280> it's<00:03:35.460> a<00:03:35.520> bronzer<00:03:35.880> but<00:03:36.210> it<00:03:36.420> actually<00:03:36.600> kind

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
says it's a bronzer but it actually kind

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.340 
says it's a bronzer but it actually kind
of<00:03:37.170> just<00:03:37.380> makes<00:03:37.590> your<00:03:37.740> base<00:03:38.370> kind<00:03:38.790> of<00:03:38.850> shiny<00:03:39.350> it

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
prada was pretty decent um kind of

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.170
