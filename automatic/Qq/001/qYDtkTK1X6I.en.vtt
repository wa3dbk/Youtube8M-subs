00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.280
 Hello, Welcome to Modest Tastes Cuisine 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.560
 In this section we are familiar with the materials ... 

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.040
 we have a different jam recipe 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.200
 "Almond Apricot Jam" 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.200
 but as always before the list of materials 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.440
 2 pounds of apricot 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.320
 2 pounds of powder 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.560
 1 cup of apricot kernel 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.040
 and 2 lemons 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.800
 we have seen the materials, quite few, very easy to make 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.240
 by immediately removing the kernels of apricots ... 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.400
 and let's start by dividing it into several parts 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.680
 we will use apricot kernel as almonds 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.600
 not to use the core of each apricot 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.280
 to try, break and sigh 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.120
 if not painful, we can use it with peace of mind 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:18.640
 We cut half of the apricot, now add half of the sugar 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.080
 and continue 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.800
 apricots completed 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:39.760
 add the remaining sugar on 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.560
 we are shaking, we are closing the cover 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.680
 we put it in an area where the sun is very dense 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.880
 at least 2 hours, we keep watering 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.880
 After the drying of these emerging cores in the sun for up to 2 days ... 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.240
 we're breaking down like normal almonds in this way comes out an inside 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.800
 we put in the hot water, pull out the inner shell 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:12.040
 and in this way we get white peeled almonds 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.520
 2 hours later 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.560
 sugar melted, watered 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.560
 let's put it on fire now 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.160
 we put the jam on the fire, we open the lid 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.720
 we will take almonds after the candies are melted 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.320
 candy literally melted 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.320
 The boiling will also take place less then 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.800
 now we add apricot almonds to cook together 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.440
 we'll mix it without damaging the fruit as much as it will be. 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.040
 jam came to boiling point 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.280
 we can take the foams in the seven by mixing occasionally 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.240
 now we're halving the fire 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.640
 and an hour and a half we cook occasionally 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.960
 one and half hour later 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.520
 our jam took a nice consistency 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.200
 Now we are adding 2 of our lemon juice 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.400
 we are a little confused 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.400
 and cook for 5-6 minutes 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.160
 now we can shut the fire now 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.600
 apricot jam with almonds ready 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.600
 We took 10 minutes. 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.560
 now we can also place in the jar hot ... 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.760
 we can expect to cool down, this is not a very important detail 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.880
 now fill in the jar 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.440
 Now let's close the lid tightly 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.440
 Let's write a label 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.880
 especially if you write the year of production on labels 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.480
 now you can use it now at any time 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.000
 Modest Flavors in this part of the kitchen ... 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 making it easy to make different tastes ... 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.120
 we shared a nice jam recipe 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.840
 "Almond Apricot Jam" 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.080
 I wish you to try as soon as possible, bye ...
