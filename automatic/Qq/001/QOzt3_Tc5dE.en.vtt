actual movement of the motorcycle this

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.420 
actual movement of the motorcycle this
is<00:01:23.990> allowed<00:01:24.230> the<00:01:24.350> motorcycle<00:01:24.800> to<00:01:24.860> become<00:01:25.130> more

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
is allowed the motorcycle to become more

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.220 
is allowed the motorcycle to become more
