00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:06.420
 welcome you to a new videos 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:09.510
 hear and juarez today I want to present you 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.639
 story of the saya jeans with the only 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:15.950
 objective to entertain you and inform you 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:18.500
 Well, no more elevate your skin and let's start 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:20.029
 the story begins on the home planet 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.220
 of the saya jeans which 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:24.860
 unfortunately it came to be destroyed 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.600
 by a mysterious character nicknamed the 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.060
 super saiyans 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:31.130
 who greatly increased his powers 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.680
 until you take a transformation similar to 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.900
 that of a Tsar and thereby destroy the 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.250
 planet in an unconscious way finishing 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.930
 with a large part of his race 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.180
 while the survivors managed 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.630
 escape to a planet with two suns 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.790
 called planet planet 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.890
 the planet plant was inhabited by 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.470
 a race called plant ians that they created 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.330
 ancestral medicine which in 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.160
 theory were killed by their 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.140
 soccer jeans when these for reasons 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.880
 strangers also landed on the 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.190
 planet plant 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.290
 there are already jeans and I suffered jeans 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.390
 would agree that each race would stay with 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.670
 one half of the planet 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.680
 quickly formed a great friendship 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.810
 but as time passed the 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.150
 they created some conflicts between these 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:17.840
 two streaks where the envy of 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:19.880
 the wise men from that deal would reach 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.650
 spend many years and I suffered jeans and 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.710
 the sayayin shawn coexisted in the same 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:27.440
 planet the suzuki lived in great 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.420
 cities they occupied the most 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.620
 of the planet thanks to its great development 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.630
 technological 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:35.480
 while the Sayayin lived in 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.640
 caves or small villages their culture was 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.890
 very late they did not have so much 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.020
 technology as I suffered them and links were 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.550
 pretty primitive but they were a 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.380
 warrior race resistant to 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:48.350
 adversities and they were twice the size 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.570
 of what was a suffers the philosophy 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.000
 sayayin is as simple as devastating 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.070
 eat or be like the sayayin are a 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.960
 extraterrestrial race of physical appearance 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.570
 very similar to that of humans 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.370
 only that they have a much superior force 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.500
 to that of a human being and they have a tail 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:05.330
 of monkey that is its weak point in the 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.000
 high class warriors this weakness 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:10.010
 disappears and most have hair 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.990
 black which when it has grown by 

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:14.660
 complete does not change them in style or 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.940
 size sayayin have a long life 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.190
 and are kept in good physical shape by 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.440
 a much longer period compared to 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.690
 humans, sayayin while 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.790
 the more they fight they become stronger and their 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.070
 blood of warrior 2 keeps young and 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.890
 they can fight for more time and they get older 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:34.190
 slowly these usually have a 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.390
 long life approximately 150 to 200 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.210
 years 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.370
 for fortune sayayin a leader emerged 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:42.530
 among the marginalized called vegueta 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.660
 who was different from the other sayayin 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.910
 because with his intelligence he managed 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.980
 create a great plan of conquest which 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.690
 it consisted in taking completely the 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.610
 planet supported by the fact that 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.950
 from before they managed to take terrain 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.720
 by short attacks and finally in 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.180
 the day of the great confrontation the 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.100
 sayayin completely took over the planet 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.530
 thanks to the full moon which 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:06.890
 It offered its metamorphosis by converting them 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.870
 in giant vegueta monkeys that had 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.060
 self-proclaimed king of the there are already jeans 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.950
 for being the smartest and clever 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.840
 highlighted at the time of the total 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.180
 victory they decided to change the name 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.670
 of the planet and put the name of the young 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.830
 sayayin 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.650
 by the new dragon movie 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:26.110
 ball z which was released in 2013 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:29.110
 he made himself known a little about the past 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:31.330
 of the saya jeans where zhendong relates 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.160
 that on the same planet baby there was a 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.080
 group of sai and jeans that questioned 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.880
 the bad acts of his race where by 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.980
 accident gave life to a savior 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.050
 then a group of sai and jeans no 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:44.020
 they agreed with that and they wanted 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:46.269
 make rebellion this story could 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:48.580
 locate it during the time of conquest 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:50.560
 because without assumptions we can 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.239
 affirm that the greatest act of evil of 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.780
 the sayayin was to destroy the 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:55.970
 submachine guns 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.370
 after the total destruction of the 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:00.770
 suburbs the technology was delayed a lot 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.590
 for the jeans side but they could 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:05.330
 rescue things like the tracker 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.819
 they still had very old technology and 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.740
 old for that reason then they joined forces 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:11.840
 with aliens who provided them 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:13.459
 current technology and money times 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.470
 later on becoming known as 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:17.660
 mercenaries would start working for 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:20.540
 freezer who added to the planet bellita 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:22.820
 to the commercial empire that he ruled 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:25.280
 being one more race than the many 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:27.230
 they worked for freezer they looked for a 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.060
 planet with a good environment and 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:31.070
 eliminated all the individuals that 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.969
 they lived and then sell the planet to 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:36.069
 a high price to extraterrestrials 

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:37.869
 for vegueta to be a king with all the 

00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:40.589
 Possible luxuries made him even more 

00:04:37.869 --> 00:04:43.539
 greedy and for years towards what I wanted 

00:04:40.589 --> 00:04:45.039
 However, I did not pray to grow because 

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:47.199
 I was aware of the danger that 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:49.179
 They reflected until one day plucked up 

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:51.369
 courage and together with his great squadron of 

00:04:49.179 --> 00:04:53.469
 elite wanted to face the emperor with 

00:04:51.369 --> 00:04:55.539
 the ambition to dethrone and seize 

00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:57.369
 of the universe which was a waste 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:59.559
 because his men gave him the 

00:04:57.369 --> 00:05:01.929
 back and finally the great king was 

00:04:59.559 --> 00:05:03.909
 killed by a special blow and 

00:05:01.929 --> 00:05:05.320
 his men would follow the same fate 

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:07.450
 that the king 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:09.670
 After the storm, calm did not come 

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:11.560
 freezer and was determined to end 

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:13.720
 the saints so they were not a 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.370
 annoyance and it was a plan that was already 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.300
 carrying out with a squadron of 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.340
 planet min 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:20.200
 after killing the king decides to end 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.270
 there are already jeans once and for all 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:24.340
 when he goes out to the hatch of his ship 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:26.590
 space meets the only 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:28.840
 sayayin that was meant to save 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:31.030
 your planet and change the future of the of 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:32.729
 his son and all the jeans side his 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:34.800
 name was bard 

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:36.870
 bar where he dedicates a few words to free 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.969
 Cell and defies him by launching an attack 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:41.039
 of energy which does not achieve anything since 

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:42.930
 the freezer supernova technique the 

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:44.999
 which by far was superior and is 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:47.009
 then when the attack goes to 

00:05:44.999 --> 00:05:49.110
 planet bay and is defeating bardot 

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:51.150
 when in reality it undertakes a 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:53.400
 mysterious journey in time and the 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:55.529
 planet is completely destroyed with the 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.240
 Most of them are already jeans except 

00:05:55.529 --> 00:05:59.000
 those who were or directed to 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:01.340
 Another planets 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.320
 a long time later it is discovered that 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:05.270
 freezer not only destroyed the planet 

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:07.670
 bellita because the sai ya jim will be a 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:09.380
 annoyance but hid other reasons 

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:11.600
 which were the fear of the old 

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:13.550
 legend of the super saiyans that bard -that 

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:15.650
 he was in charge of disclosing in the race of 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:18.080
 tyrant through that trip in time 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:20.330
 overcoming an ancestor called Charles 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:22.490
 who was a space pirate and a new 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:24.290
 little credible reason where the god bills 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:26.180
 of the destruction just be it 

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:29.240
 he ordered because he did not like the attitude 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:31.730
 from King Beretta a lot has been seen about 

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:33.560
 the origin of there are already jeans where every 

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:37.340
 argument instead of clarifying certain 

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:38.870
 things simply generated more questions and 

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:41.330
 this is all the information that 

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:43.430
 currently it has become known and 

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:46.910
 look for meaning to make it easier 

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:48.740
 understand all this topic besides everything 

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:50.870

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:53.150
 shit happened to them raise the

 and in passing is a subject that they wanted 

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:58.650
 I touched
