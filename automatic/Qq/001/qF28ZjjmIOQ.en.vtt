something<00:01:44.890> we've<00:01:45.009> taken<00:01:45.250> to<00:01:45.430> heart<00:01:45.640> one<00:01:46.030> of

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
something we've taken to heart one of

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:47.130 
something we've taken to heart one of
the<00:01:46.149> first<00:01:46.210> thing<00:01:46.390> that<00:01:46.420> we<00:01:46.719> can<00:01:46.869> talk<00:01:47.020> about

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
the first thing that we can talk about

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.080 
the first thing that we can talk about
on<00:01:47.409> the<00:01:47.590> reputation<00:01:47.890> front<00:01:48.430> is<00:01:48.610> just<00:01:48.909> making

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
on the reputation front is just making

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.539 
on the reputation front is just making
sure<00:01:49.210> that<00:01:49.390> again<00:01:50.200> players<00:01:50.500> understand<00:01:51.340> all

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:51.549 
sure that again players understand all

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:53.310

the different things they can do what
happened<00:01:53.619> in<00:01:53.680> prototype<00:01:54.070> one<00:01:54.310> is<00:01:54.549> that

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
happened in prototype one is that

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.940 
happened in prototype one is that
players<00:01:55.360> found<00:01:55.719> the<00:01:55.960> one<00:01:56.200> or<00:01:56.350> two<00:01:56.380> powers<00:01:56.799> that

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
they really like them and whether that

they really like them and whether that
was<00:01:59.469> claws<00:01:59.740> or<00:01:59.979> blade<00:02:00.219> they<00:02:00.609> basically<00:02:01.240> stuck

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
was claws or blade they basically stuck

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:02.940 
was claws or blade they basically stuck
to<00:02:01.659> that<00:02:01.689> power<00:02:01.960> the<00:02:02.229> entire<00:02:02.350> time<00:02:02.680> just

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
to that power the entire time just

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.969 
to that power the entire time just
because<00:02:03.039> you<00:02:03.880> know<00:02:04.030> what<00:02:04.180> else<00:02:04.299> do<00:02:04.420> you<00:02:04.979> press

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
and you know generally that worked this

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:11.910 
and you know generally that worked this
time<00:02:10.840> around<00:02:11.079> we<00:02:11.290> want<00:02:11.440> to<00:02:11.500> make<00:02:11.590> sure<00:02:11.620> there's

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
time around we want to make sure there's

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
a lot more variety in the kind of moment

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:15.810 
a lot more variety in the kind of moment
gameplay<00:02:14.380> so<00:02:14.740> even<00:02:15.250> things<00:02:15.460> like<00:02:15.550> the

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
gameplay so even things like the

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.210 
gameplay so even things like the
tactical<00:02:16.270> dodge<00:02:16.480> and<00:02:16.900> the<00:02:17.200> blocks<00:02:17.500> you<00:02:18.160> know

it really cases that the

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.230 
it really cases that the

universe<00:02:32.800> a<00:02:32.830> prototype<00:02:33.340> in<00:02:33.550> I<00:02:34.080> think<00:02:35.080> a<00:02:35.140> big

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
universe a prototype in I think a big

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.350 
universe a prototype in I think a big
part<00:02:35.380> of<00:02:35.740> it<00:02:35.890> is<00:02:36.070> context<00:02:36.850> you<00:02:37.000> know<00:02:37.030> if<00:02:37.240> you

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
part of it is context you know if you

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.230 
part of it is context you know if you
look<00:02:37.480> at<00:02:37.630> any<00:02:37.780> game<00:02:38.050> whether<00:02:38.830> it's<00:02:39.160> GTA<00:02:39.880> or

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
Assassins Creed the core things that

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.400 
Assassins Creed the core things that
you're<00:02:41.980> doing<00:02:42.150> there's<00:02:43.150> not<00:02:43.330> that<00:02:43.390> much<00:02:43.930> you

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
you're doing there's not that much you

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:45.870 
you're doing there's not that much you
know<00:02:44.500> in<00:02:44.680> terms<00:02:44.830> of<00:02:44.980> here<00:02:45.160> you're<00:02:45.460> driving

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
know in terms of here you're driving

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.610 
know in terms of here you're driving
you're<00:02:46.090> shooting<00:02:46.450> you're<00:02:46.780> talking<00:02:47.530> two<00:02:47.590> bad

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
you're shooting you're talking two bad

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.740 
you're shooting you're talking two bad
guys<00:02:47.920> and<00:02:48.280> you're<00:02:48.490> killing<00:02:48.730> that<00:02:48.850> guys<00:02:49.060> but

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
guys and you're killing that guys but

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.810 
guys and you're killing that guys but
it's<00:02:49.870> all<00:02:50.050> in<00:02:50.200> the<00:02:50.290> setup<00:02:51.250> you<00:02:51.520> know<00:02:51.610> the

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
it's all in the setup you know the

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.660 
it's all in the setup you know the
delivery<00:02:52.450> of<00:02:52.510> the<00:02:52.690> lines<00:02:53.380> the<00:02:53.800> the<00:02:54.250> context

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
delivery of the lines the the context

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.940 
delivery of the lines the the context
would<00:02:54.850> you<00:02:55.270> know<00:02:55.360> who<00:02:55.540> you're<00:02:55.690> talking<00:02:55.990> to<00:02:56.320> and

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
would you know who you're talking to and

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.020 
would you know who you're talking to and
I<00:02:57.070> think<00:02:57.130> that's<00:02:57.430> what<00:02:57.640> makes<00:02:57.790> things

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
I think that's what makes things

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.520 
I think that's what makes things
interesting<00:02:58.240> that's<00:02:58.780> what<00:02:58.960> keeps<00:02:59.200> things

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
interesting that's what keeps things

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.050 
interesting that's what keeps things
fresh<00:02:59.830> and<00:03:00.100> you<00:03:00.460> know<00:03:00.550> we've<00:03:00.700> taken<00:03:00.880> those

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.400 
fresh and you know we've taken those

little<00:03:19.720> to<00:03:19.990> say<00:03:20.230> me<00:03:20.410> with<00:03:20.680> a<00:03:20.710> different

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
little to say me with a different

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:22.740 
little to say me with a different
character<00:03:21.370> yeah<00:03:21.760> I<00:03:21.790> think<00:03:21.970> it<00:03:22.270> is<00:03:22.300> a<00:03:22.540> little

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
character yeah I think it is a little

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.680 
character yeah I think it is a little
bit<00:03:22.870> deliberate<00:03:23.350> we<00:03:23.470> want<00:03:23.710> to<00:03:24.010> show<00:03:24.250> that<00:03:24.690> both

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
bit deliberate we want to show that both

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.230 
bit deliberate we want to show that both
Heller<00:03:26.260> and<00:03:26.560> Mercer<00:03:27.010> there<00:03:27.700> are<00:03:27.790> people<00:03:28.210> there

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:28.240 
Heller and Mercer there are people there

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.350 
Heller and Mercer there are people there
are<00:03:28.420> people<00:03:28.480> that<00:03:28.840> want<00:03:29.410> to<00:03:29.530> do<00:03:29.650> things<00:03:29.920> with

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
are people that want to do things with

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.150 
are people that want to do things with
with<00:03:31.360> Alex<00:03:31.690> in<00:03:31.810> particular<00:03:32.260> I<00:03:32.290> think<00:03:32.410> some<00:03:33.130> of

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
with Alex in particular I think some of

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.620 
with Alex in particular I think some of
his<00:03:33.340> motivation<00:03:33.910> was<00:03:33.940> quite<00:03:34.300> unclear

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
his motivation was quite unclear

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.300 
his motivation was quite unclear
throughout<00:03:35.080> the<00:03:35.230> the<00:03:35.560> story<00:03:35.800> the<00:03:35.920> first<00:03:36.130> game

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
throughout the the story the first game

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:37.830 
throughout the the story the first game
I<00:03:36.460> think<00:03:36.490> there's<00:03:37.270> one<00:03:37.300> of<00:03:37.510> the<00:03:37.600> criticisms

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
I think there's one of the criticisms

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.050 
I think there's one of the criticisms
where<00:03:38.350> you<00:03:39.010> know<00:03:39.130> I<00:03:39.340> don't<00:03:39.490> really<00:03:39.670> know<00:03:39.880> what

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
where you know I don't really know what

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.660 
where you know I don't really know what
Alex<00:03:40.180> is<00:03:40.360> doing<00:03:40.750> I'm<00:03:40.930> just<00:03:41.170> going<00:03:41.530> about

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
Alex is doing I'm just going about

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.460 
Alex is doing I'm just going about
cutting<00:03:42.670> people<00:03:42.910> now<00:03:43.150> you<00:03:43.480> know<00:03:43.690> and<00:03:43.960> I<00:03:44.170> don't

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
cutting people now you know and I don't

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.010 
cutting people now you know and I don't
really<00:03:44.770> pay<00:03:44.980> attention<00:03:45.010> this<00:03:45.460> sword<00:03:45.730> and<00:03:46.020> by

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:47.020 
really pay attention this sword and by

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.860 
really pay attention this sword and by
doing<00:03:47.500> James<00:03:48.250> Heller's<00:03:48.610> backstory<00:03:49.570> and

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
doing James Heller's backstory and

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.900 
doing James Heller's backstory and
making<00:03:50.350> a<00:03:50.440> much<00:03:50.740> more<00:03:50.890> personal<00:03:51.190> story<00:03:51.700> for

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
making a much more personal story for

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:53.820 
making a much more personal story for
Heller<00:03:52.060> I<00:03:52.180> think<00:03:52.450> again<00:03:53.050> players<00:03:53.320> can<00:03:53.560> kind<00:03:53.770> of

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:53.830 
Heller I think again players can kind of

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:55.920 
Heller I think again players can kind of
understand<00:03:54.790> the<00:03:54.850> motivation<00:03:55.360> and<00:03:55.450> understand

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
understand the motivation and understand

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.080 
understand the motivation and understand
what<00:03:56.110> he's<00:03:56.260> all<00:03:56.380> about<00:03:56.410> and<00:03:57.060> you<00:03:58.060> know

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
what he's all about and you know

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.300 
what he's all about and you know
contrasting<00:03:58.720> those<00:03:58.840> two<00:03:59.110> sets<00:03:59.950> up<00:04:00.070> a<00:04:00.160> really

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
contrasting those two sets up a really

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.310 
contrasting those two sets up a really
interesting<00:04:00.640> dynamic<00:04:01.240> word<00:04:01.480> you<00:04:02.050> know<00:04:02.140> at

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:02.320 
interesting dynamic word you know at

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.070 
interesting dynamic word you know at
certain<00:04:02.500> points<00:04:02.980> is<00:04:03.460> Mercer<00:04:04.210> a<00:04:04.240> bad<00:04:04.420> guy<00:04:04.600> hmm

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:05.080 
certain points is Mercer a bad guy hmm

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.410 
certain points is Mercer a bad guy hmm
maybe<00:04:05.740> yes<00:04:06.070> no<00:04:06.280> there<00:04:06.640> James<00:04:07.210> Heller

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
maybe yes no there James Heller

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.240 
maybe yes no there James Heller
certainly<00:04:07.810> thinks<00:04:08.020> he's<00:04:08.110> a<00:04:08.170> bad<00:04:08.320> guy<00:04:08.350> but<00:04:08.500> as

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
certainly thinks he's a bad guy but as

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:10.830 
certainly thinks he's a bad guy but as
you<00:04:09.370> see<00:04:09.550> you<00:04:09.880> know<00:04:10.000> nothing<00:04:10.030> is<00:04:10.420> really<00:04:10.540> black

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
you see you know nothing is really black

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.240 
you see you know nothing is really black
and<00:04:10.990> white<00:04:11.110> there's<00:04:11.320> all<00:04:11.560> sorts<00:04:11.860> of<00:04:11.920> shades<00:04:12.130> of

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
and white there's all sorts of shades of

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:13.280 
and white there's all sorts of shades of
gray<00:04:12.400> in<00:04:12.520> between<00:04:12.550> and

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
gray in between and

and finding out that story and figuring

00:04:15.719 --> 00:04:17.840 
and finding out that story and figuring
it<00:04:15.810> out<00:04:15.900> you<00:04:16.590> know<00:04:16.680> what<00:04:16.949> actually<00:04:17.160> happened<00:04:17.699> I

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
it out you know what actually happened I

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:19.909 
it out you know what actually happened I
think<00:04:18.090> is<00:04:18.239> really<00:04:18.780> important<00:04:19.560> to<00:04:19.590> hell<00:04:19.739> and
