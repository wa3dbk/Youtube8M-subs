00:01:37.849 --> 00:01:37.859

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:40.039 
we've just missed a few little touches
that<00:01:38.039> were<00:01:38.789> so<00:01:38.999> important<00:01:39.509> from<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.719> old<00:01:39.869> one

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
that were so important from the old one

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.749 
that were so important from the old one
and<00:01:40.200> although<00:01:40.950> you<00:01:41.100> I<00:01:41.219> think<00:01:41.369> they'll

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
and although you I think they'll

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.239 
and although you I think they'll
probably<00:01:41.909> attract<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:42.990> lot<00:01:43.409> more<00:01:43.439> customers

00:01:44.239 --> 00:01:44.249 
probably attract a lot more customers

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:46.279 
probably attract a lot more customers
with<00:01:44.639> the<00:01:44.729> new<00:01:44.909> model<00:01:45.270> they're<00:01:45.719> also<00:01:45.899> going<00:01:46.200> to

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:46.289 
with the new model they're also going to

seater<00:02:21.440> would<00:02:22.440> have<00:02:22.620> preferred<00:02:23.160> it<00:02:23.430> maybe<00:02:24.090> if

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
seater would have preferred it maybe if

it<00:02:24.420> comes<00:02:24.630> out<00:02:24.810> as<00:02:25.020> an<00:02:25.230> occasional<00:02:26.040> 7<00:02:26.550> seat<00:02:26.870> you

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
it comes out as an occasional 7 seat you

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.480 
it comes out as an occasional 7 seat you
could<00:02:28.050> probably<00:02:28.290> just<00:02:28.530> about<00:02:28.860> squeeze<00:02:29.190> six

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
could probably just about squeeze six

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:30.950 
could probably just about squeeze six
people<00:02:29.880> in<00:02:29.970> but<00:02:30.090> I<00:02:30.120> really<00:02:30.510> don't<00:02:30.600> think<00:02:30.870> you

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
people in but I really don't think you

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.340 
people in but I really don't think you
would<00:02:31.080> get<00:02:31.200> seven<00:02:31.530> adults<00:02:31.680> in<00:02:33.050> over<00:02:34.050> than<00:02:34.170> that

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
would get seven adults in over than that

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.110 
would get seven adults in over than that
I<00:02:34.560> think<00:02:34.620> now<00:02:34.950> it's<00:02:35.130> brilliant<00:02:35.490> the<00:02:35.850> the

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
I think now it's brilliant the the

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.590 
I think now it's brilliant the the
parking<00:02:36.660> the<00:02:36.930> cameras<00:02:38.270> styling<00:02:39.270> of<00:02:39.360> it<00:02:39.480> and

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
parking the cameras styling of it and

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:40.790 
parking the cameras styling of it and
everything<00:02:39.870> I<00:02:39.930> think<00:02:39.990> is<00:02:40.230> fantastic

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
everything I think is fantastic

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.370 
everything I think is fantastic
the<00:02:41.790> rear<00:02:42.000> seats<00:02:42.300> because<00:02:42.780> they've<00:02:43.080> got<00:02:43.290> the

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
the rear seats because they've got the

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:44.449 
the rear seats because they've got the
advantage<00:02:43.590> you've<00:02:43.860> actually<00:02:44.010> been<00:02:44.220> able<00:02:44.340> to

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
advantage you've actually been able to

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.160 
advantage you've actually been able to
move<00:02:44.610> them<00:02:44.850> backwards<00:02:45.180> and<00:02:45.300> forwards<00:02:45.600> as<00:02:45.930> well

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
move them backwards and forwards as well

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.610 
move them backwards and forwards as well
as<00:02:46.320> the<00:02:46.440> front<00:02:46.650> seats<00:02:46.920> you<00:02:47.100> can<00:02:47.130> adjust<00:02:48.620> 60/40

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
as the front seats you can adjust 60/40

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.170 
as the front seats you can adjust 60/40
split<00:02:49.920> would<00:02:50.130> make<00:02:50.370> it<00:02:50.640> a<00:02:50.700> little<00:02:50.850> bit<00:02:51.060> awkward

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
split would make it a little bit awkward

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.740 
split would make it a little bit awkward
if<00:02:52.140> you<00:02:52.830> were<00:02:52.950> carrying<00:02:53.300> somebody<00:02:54.300> with<00:02:54.540> long

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
if you were carrying somebody with long

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.330 
if you were carrying somebody with long
legs<00:02:54.930> and<00:02:55.140> with<00:02:55.530> short<00:02:55.680> legs<00:02:55.890> at<00:02:56.070> the<00:02:56.130> same

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
legs and with short legs at the same

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.920 
legs and with short legs at the same
time<00:02:56.580> but<00:02:57.030> as<00:02:57.209> long<00:02:57.360> as<00:02:57.450> you've<00:02:57.540> not<00:02:57.660> got<00:02:57.780> too

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
time but as long as you've not got too

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.690 
time but as long as you've not got too
much<00:02:58.050> stuff<00:02:58.200> in<00:02:58.410> the<00:02:58.500> boot<00:02:58.709> they<00:02:59.130> also<00:02:59.430> recline

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
much stuff in the boot they also recline

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.090 
much stuff in the boot they also recline
so<00:03:00.180> again<00:03:00.750> you<00:03:00.930> cannot<00:03:01.140> lean<00:03:01.740> back<00:03:01.920> a<00:03:01.950> little

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
so again you cannot lean back a little

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.890 
so again you cannot lean back a little
bit<00:03:02.430> and<00:03:02.580> make<00:03:02.910> it<00:03:02.940> a<00:03:03.090> bit<00:03:03.209> better<00:03:03.300> what<00:03:03.870> I

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
bit and make it a bit better what I

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.780 
bit and make it a bit better what I
Drive<00:03:04.290> probably<00:03:05.100> comes<00:03:05.310> more<00:03:05.550> along<00:03:05.670> the

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
Drive probably comes more along the

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.850 
Drive probably comes more along the
lines<00:03:05.970> of<00:03:06.180> the<00:03:06.420> the<00:03:06.900> workhorse<00:03:07.380> style<00:03:07.680> vehicle

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
lines of the the workhorse style vehicle

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.540 
lines of the the workhorse style vehicle
but<00:03:08.850> predominantly<00:03:09.420> I<00:03:09.540> use<00:03:09.900> it<00:03:10.080> for<00:03:10.550> emergency

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
but predominantly I use it for emergency

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.970 
but predominantly I use it for emergency
response<00:03:11.880> work<00:03:12.120> and<00:03:12.450> that<00:03:13.019> I<00:03:13.320> do<00:03:13.590> a<00:03:13.739> lot<00:03:13.830> more

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
response work and that I do a lot more

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.770 
response work and that I do a lot more
transporting<00:03:14.970> of<00:03:15.060> people<00:03:15.390> than<00:03:15.480> actually

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
transporting of people than actually

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.449 
transporting of people than actually
using<00:03:15.810> the<00:03:16.140> four<00:03:16.290> before<00:03:16.440> capability<00:03:17.190> so

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
using the four before capability so

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.310 
using the four before capability so
something<00:03:18.300> like<00:03:18.330> this<00:03:18.600> would<00:03:18.660> would<00:03:19.080> enable

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
something like this would would enable

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.930 
something like this would would enable
us<00:03:19.560> to<00:03:19.620> take<00:03:19.920> four<00:03:20.280> or<00:03:20.340> five<00:03:20.489> people<00:03:20.700> in

comfort over distance arrive feeling
more<00:03:24.060> refreshed<00:03:24.590> but<00:03:25.590> if<00:03:26.010> it<00:03:26.280> was<00:03:26.430> we<00:03:27.300> were

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
more refreshed but if it was we were

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.000 
more refreshed but if it was we were
travelling<00:03:27.750> because<00:03:27.870> of<00:03:28.140> bad<00:03:28.320> weather<00:03:28.350> then

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
travelling because of bad weather then

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.800 
travelling because of bad weather then
we<00:03:29.370> know<00:03:29.519> we<00:03:29.640> would<00:03:29.760> get<00:03:29.850> there<00:03:30.030> safely<00:03:30.390> and<00:03:30.690> we

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
we know we would get there safely and we

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.330 
we know we would get there safely and we
are<00:03:30.989> looking<00:03:31.290> at<00:03:31.410> replacing<00:03:31.590> two<00:03:32.070> or<00:03:32.160> three

in<00:05:18.340> here<00:05:18.520> quite<00:05:18.760> comfortably<00:05:19.180> and<00:05:19.330> go<00:05:19.810> all<00:05:19.960> the

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:19.990 
in here quite comfortably and go all the

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:21.360 
in here quite comfortably and go all the
way<00:05:20.050> to<00:05:20.169> Cornwall<00:05:20.590> some<00:05:21.130> of<00:05:21.190> the<00:05:21.250> most

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:21.370 
way to Cornwall some of the most

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:22.920 
way to Cornwall some of the most
important<00:05:21.849> gadgets<00:05:22.150> on<00:05:22.270> the<00:05:22.360> car<00:05:22.570> for<00:05:22.750> me

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:22.930 
important gadgets on the car for me

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:24.719 
important gadgets on the car for me
definitely<00:05:23.320> to<00:05:23.830> do<00:05:23.950> with<00:05:24.160> the<00:05:24.280> parking

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:24.729 
definitely to do with the parking

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:27.360 
definitely to do with the parking
sensors<00:05:25.300> and<00:05:25.330> the<00:05:25.720> cameras<00:05:26.200> because<00:05:26.530> having

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.370 
sensors and the cameras because having

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:28.950 
sensors and the cameras because having
already<00:05:27.550> dented<00:05:28.090> the<00:05:28.120> back<00:05:28.330> of<00:05:28.510> mine<00:05:28.690> once

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:28.960 
already dented the back of mine once

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.870 
already dented the back of mine once
where<00:05:29.289> you<00:05:29.620> know<00:05:30.190> if<00:05:30.250> you're<00:05:30.370> anything<00:05:30.639> low

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:30.880 
where you know if you're anything low

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.879 
where you know if you're anything low
down<00:05:31.150> like<00:05:31.419> parking<00:05:31.840> place<00:05:31.990> away<00:05:32.349> trays<00:05:32.650> are

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:32.889 
down like parking place away trays are

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:35.640 
down like parking place away trays are
absolutely<00:05:33.599> impossible<00:05:34.599> to<00:05:34.960> miss<00:05:35.110> so<00:05:35.410> that's

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:35.650 
absolutely impossible to miss so that's

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.730 
absolutely impossible to miss so that's
a<00:05:36.060> perfect<00:05:37.060> thing<00:05:37.240> for<00:05:37.690> me<00:05:37.990> to<00:05:38.169> be<00:05:38.289> able<00:05:38.349> to<00:05:38.500> see

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:38.740 
a perfect thing for me to be able to see

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:42.029 
a perfect thing for me to be able to see
and<00:05:39.070> not<00:05:39.370> to<00:05:39.639> reverse<00:05:40.270> into<00:05:40.660> things<00:05:40.870> I<00:05:41.139> was

00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:42.039 
and not to reverse into things I was

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:43.440 
and not to reverse into things I was
really<00:05:42.340> pleased<00:05:42.580> to<00:05:42.729> hear<00:05:42.880> actually<00:05:43.240> about

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:43.450 
really pleased to hear actually about

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:46.379 
really pleased to hear actually about
the<00:05:43.720> the<00:05:44.349> lower<00:05:45.039> emissions<00:05:45.580> and<00:05:45.880> the<00:05:46.210> better

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:46.389 
the the lower emissions and the better

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:48.500 
the the lower emissions and the better
miles<00:05:46.690> per<00:05:46.900> gallon<00:05:47.200> and<00:05:47.289> everything<00:05:47.590> because

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:48.510 
miles per gallon and everything because

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:50.520 
miles per gallon and everything because
despite<00:05:49.510> loving<00:05:49.780> the<00:05:50.020> extra<00:05:50.320> that<00:05:50.410> we've

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:50.530 
despite loving the extra that we've

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:52.409 
despite loving the extra that we've
currently<00:05:50.710> got<00:05:50.919> it<00:05:51.310> is<00:05:51.430> quite<00:05:51.669> expensive<00:05:51.970> to

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:52.419 
currently got it is quite expensive to

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:54.180 
currently got it is quite expensive to
run<00:05:52.570> and<00:05:52.840> because<00:05:53.710> we<00:05:53.860> all<00:05:53.950> think<00:05:54.130> about

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:54.190 
run and because we all think about

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:55.650 
run and because we all think about
emissions<00:05:54.550> and<00:05:55.000> those<00:05:55.120> sort<00:05:55.360> of<00:05:55.389> things<00:05:55.450> so

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:55.660 
emissions and those sort of things so

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:57.180 
emissions and those sort of things so
anything<00:05:56.260> you<00:05:56.380> can<00:05:56.410> improve<00:05:56.800> well<00:05:56.919> that<00:05:57.039> is<00:05:57.160> a

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:57.190 
anything you can improve well that is a

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:59.010 
anything you can improve well that is a
good<00:05:57.340> thing<00:05:57.550> I<00:05:57.789> think<00:05:58.180> the<00:05:58.599> only<00:05:58.720> thing<00:05:58.810> I

00:05:59.010 --> 00:05:59.020 
good thing I think the only thing I

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.050 
good thing I think the only thing I
don't<00:05:59.080> like<00:05:59.470> about<00:05:59.620> it<00:06:00.099> is<00:06:00.220> the<00:06:00.490> angry-looking

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:01.060 
don't like about it is the angry-looking

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:04.350 
don't like about it is the angry-looking
front<00:06:01.750> it<00:06:02.289> I'm<00:06:03.099> a<00:06:03.280> bit<00:06:03.520> of<00:06:03.610> a<00:06:03.669> one<00:06:03.849> for<00:06:04.120> the<00:06:04.210> more

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:04.360 
front it I'm a bit of a one for the more

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.600 
front it I'm a bit of a one for the more
boxy<00:06:04.810> shape<00:06:04.840> because<00:06:05.380> I<00:06:05.500> think<00:06:05.710> I<00:06:05.860> assume

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:06.610 
boxy shape because I think I assume

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:07.950 
boxy shape because I think I assume
that's<00:06:06.760> how<00:06:06.970> a<00:06:07.000> four-wheel<00:06:07.479> drive<00:06:07.690> should

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:07.960 
that's how a four-wheel drive should

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:09.839 
that's how a four-wheel drive should
look<00:06:08.200> so<00:06:08.740> I'm<00:06:08.830> sure<00:06:08.979> it's<00:06:09.160> just<00:06:09.190> down<00:06:09.460> to<00:06:09.610> taste

00:06:09.839 --> 00:06:09.849 
look so I'm sure it's just down to taste

00:06:09.849 --> 00:06:11.939 
look so I'm sure it's just down to taste
but<00:06:10.150> for<00:06:10.210> me<00:06:10.510> the<00:06:11.080> front<00:06:11.260> end<00:06:11.470> just<00:06:11.530> looks<00:06:11.830> a

00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:11.949 
but for me the front end just looks a

00:06:11.949 --> 00:06:14.010 
but for me the front end just looks a
bit<00:06:11.979> angry<00:06:12.220> the<00:06:12.940> boot<00:06:13.090> space<00:06:13.330> is<00:06:13.389> really<00:06:13.720> good

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:14.020 
bit angry the boot space is really good

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:16.409 
bit angry the boot space is really good
