okay so cap Corral I had some

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.910 
okay so cap Corral I had some
transmission<00:00:07.410> trouble

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:09.920 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.190 

took<00:00:10.190> the<00:00:10.280> clutch<00:00:10.490> part

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.850 

just<00:00:13.830> slipping<00:00:14.250> a<00:00:14.280> little<00:00:14.309> bit

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:15.860 
just slipping a little bit

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.490 
just slipping a little bit
well<00:00:16.460> that<00:00:16.940> was<00:00:17.030> normal<00:00:17.420> wear<00:00:17.630> but<00:00:17.990> I<00:00:18.200> was

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:18.500 
well that was normal wear but I was

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.560 
well that was normal wear but I was
having<00:00:18.710> noise<00:00:19.070> ever<00:00:19.430> since<00:00:19.610> I<00:00:19.670> had<00:00:19.850> the<00:00:19.940> char<00:00:20.240> I

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:20.570 
having noise ever since I had the char I

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.769 
having noise ever since I had the char I
was<00:00:21.500> having<00:00:21.860> a<00:00:22.100> noisy<00:00:22.460> transmission<00:00:23.210> so<00:00:23.750> I

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:23.779 
was having a noisy transmission so I

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:26.800 
was having a noisy transmission so I
decided<00:00:24.170> to<00:00:24.259> take<00:00:24.439> it<00:00:24.590> apart<00:00:24.890> by<00:00:25.660> world<00:00:26.660> class

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:26.810 
decided to take it apart by world class

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.990 
decided to take it apart by world class
I<00:00:28.540> just<00:00:29.540> took<00:00:29.660> apart<00:00:30.050> the<00:00:30.439> tail<00:00:31.400> housing<00:00:31.880> of

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.000 
I just took apart the tail housing of

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.869 
I just took apart the tail housing of
this<00:00:32.119> world<00:00:32.570> class<00:00:32.750> t5<00:00:33.699> doesn't<00:00:34.699> come<00:00:34.850> out

00:00:34.869 --> 00:00:34.879 
this world class t5 doesn't come out

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:38.890 
this world class t5 doesn't come out
that<00:00:35.239> bad<00:00:36.190> but<00:00:37.190> as<00:00:37.340> I<00:00:37.489> suspected<00:00:38.059> the<00:00:38.330> bearings

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:38.900 
that bad but as I suspected the bearings

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.299 
that bad but as I suspected the bearings
are<00:00:39.080> kind<00:00:39.290> of<00:00:39.379> worn<00:00:39.590> and<00:00:39.800> I<00:00:39.860> wanted<00:00:40.190> to

00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:40.309 
are kind of worn and I wanted to

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:43.200 
are kind of worn and I wanted to
document<00:00:40.489> this<00:00:41.000> I<00:00:41.590> don't<00:00:42.590> know<00:00:42.710> if<00:00:42.860> you<00:00:43.010> can

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.210 
document this I don't know if you can

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.890 
document this I don't know if you can
hear<00:00:44.210> that<00:00:44.710> but<00:00:46.090> you<00:00:47.090> can<00:00:47.269> definitely<00:00:47.420> hear

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:47.900 
hear that but you can definitely hear

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:53.049 
hear that but you can definitely hear
them<00:00:48.080> out<00:00:48.290> in<00:00:48.559> there<00:00:51.040> you<00:00:52.040> can<00:00:52.250> kind<00:00:52.670> of<00:00:52.790> see

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
them out in there you can kind of see

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.490 
them out in there you can kind of see
the<00:00:53.269> movement<00:00:53.690> right<00:00:54.620> there<00:00:54.680> it's<00:00:55.309> a<00:00:55.370> bit<00:00:55.549> much

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:56.500 
the movement right there it's a bit much

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.609 
the movement right there it's a bit much
so<00:00:57.500> yeah<00:00:57.620> it's<00:00:57.830> moving<00:00:58.129> around<00:00:59.170> it<00:01:00.170> shouldn't

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:00.619 
so yeah it's moving around it shouldn't

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:04.689 
so yeah it's moving around it shouldn't
be<00:01:00.710> proofing<00:01:01.129> like<00:01:01.580> that<00:01:03.400> everything<00:01:04.400> the

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
be proofing like that everything the

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:06.609 
be proofing like that everything the
gears<00:01:04.940> are<00:01:05.089> fun<00:01:05.299> stuff<00:01:05.600> like<00:01:05.659> that<00:01:05.960> or<00:01:06.409> the

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
gears are fun stuff like that or the

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:12.640 
gears are fun stuff like that or the
speedo<00:01:06.920> gear<00:01:07.840> but<00:01:08.840> I<00:01:09.140> mean<00:01:11.200> it's<00:01:12.200> got<00:01:12.350> quite<00:01:12.560> a

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
speedo gear but I mean it's got quite a

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.370 
speedo gear but I mean it's got quite a
knock<00:01:12.950> do<00:01:13.640> it<00:01:13.820> if<00:01:14.780> you<00:01:14.869> have<00:01:14.990> a<00:01:15.049> world<00:01:15.320> class

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
knock do it if you have a world class

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.920 
knock do it if you have a world class
defy<00:01:16.010> that's<00:01:16.310> doing<00:01:16.640> that<00:01:16.670> or<00:01:17.570> any<00:01:17.750> other

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
defy that's doing that or any other

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.030 
defy that's doing that or any other
similar<00:01:18.380> transmission<00:01:19.330> and<00:01:20.330> it<00:01:20.480> here<00:01:20.690> or<00:01:20.780> not

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040 
similar transmission and it here or not

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.400 
similar transmission and it here or not
coming<00:01:22.040> from<00:01:22.190> the<00:01:22.340> transmission<00:01:22.760> area<00:01:23.410> well

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:24.410 
coming from the transmission area well

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:25.980 
coming from the transmission area well
it's<00:01:24.620> probably<00:01:24.770> your<00:01:25.010> bearings

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
it's probably your bearings

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.820 
it's probably your bearings
there<00:01:26.990> it<00:01:27.140> is<00:01:27.200> moving<00:01:27.560> around<00:01:29.260> bad<00:01:30.260> news

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
and if you read the instruction manual

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:03.210 
and if you read the instruction manual
that's<00:01:57.580> given<00:01:58.649> from<00:02:00.300> you<00:02:01.300> know<00:02:01.830> but<00:02:02.830> it's<00:02:02.950> not

that's given from you know but it's not

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.249 
that's given from you know but it's not
BorgWarner<00:02:03.940> i<00:02:04.119> think<00:02:04.509> it<00:02:04.570> is<00:02:04.690> board<00:02:04.899> corner

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:05.259 
BorgWarner i think it is board corner

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:07.919 
BorgWarner i think it is board corner
right<00:02:05.590> a<00:02:05.910> BorgWarner<00:02:06.910> t5<00:02:07.300> that's<00:02:07.509> what<00:02:07.660> it<00:02:07.840> is

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:07.929 
right a BorgWarner t5 that's what it is

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:09.180 
right a BorgWarner t5 that's what it is

like I don't know three thousand six
thousandths<00:02:29.380> of<00:02:29.500> uh<00:02:30.030> end<00:02:31.030> play<00:02:31.300> or<00:02:31.450> something

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
thousandths of uh end play or something

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.660 
thousandths of uh end play or something
and<00:02:32.050> you<00:02:32.530> know<00:02:32.650> the<00:02:32.769> input<00:02:33.040> shaft<00:02:33.280> had<00:02:33.489> way

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
and you know the input shaft had way

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.330 
and you know the input shaft had way
more<00:02:33.970> than<00:02:34.180> that

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
more than that

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.550 
more than that
but<00:02:36.340> I<00:02:36.370> realized<00:02:36.880> now<00:02:37.150> in<00:02:37.480> that<00:02:37.720> video<00:02:38.049> to

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
but I realized now in that video to

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.160 
but I realized now in that video to
illustrate<00:02:39.100> the<00:02:39.250> point<00:02:39.489> that<00:02:39.850> the<00:02:40.690> main<00:02:40.900> shaft

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
illustrate the point that the main shaft

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.430 
illustrate the point that the main shaft
is<00:02:41.470> loose<00:02:42.239> because<00:02:43.239> you<00:02:43.540> know<00:02:43.630> if<00:02:43.810> I<00:02:43.959> if<00:02:44.200> I

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
is loose because you know if I if I

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.720 
is loose because you know if I if I
could<00:02:44.470> get<00:02:44.769> the<00:02:44.920> input<00:02:45.220> shaft<00:02:45.430> to<00:02:45.519> shake

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
could get the input shaft to shake

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.850 
could get the input shaft to shake
around<00:02:45.910> and<00:02:46.299> of<00:02:46.690> course<00:02:47.019> the<00:02:47.140> input<00:02:47.350> shaft<00:02:47.650> is

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
around and of course the input shaft is

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.470 
around and of course the input shaft is
connected<00:02:47.890> to<00:02:48.459> the<00:02:48.549> output<00:02:48.700> shaft<00:02:48.940> if<00:02:49.360> you

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
connected to the output shaft if you

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.500 
connected to the output shaft if you
guys<00:02:49.630> know<00:02:49.870> your<00:02:50.019> transmissions<00:02:50.620> and<00:02:51.510> I

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
guys know your transmissions and I

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.050 
guys know your transmissions and I
shouldn't<00:02:53.640> basically<00:02:54.640> I<00:02:54.670> shouldn't<00:02:55.000> have

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
shouldn't basically I shouldn't have

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.880 
shouldn't basically I shouldn't have
taken<00:02:55.360> a<00:02:55.450> tale<00:02:55.630> housing<00:02:56.079> out<00:02:56.230> the<00:02:56.410> shake<00:02:56.709> head

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
taken a tale housing out the shake head

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.509 
taken a tale housing out the shake head
around<00:02:57.190> because<00:02:57.640> that<00:02:58.410> that<00:02:59.410> shot<00:02:59.769> you<00:03:00.010> just

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
around because that that shot you just

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:04.470 
around because that that shot you just
saw<00:03:01.829> was<00:03:02.829> showing<00:03:03.280> fifth<00:03:03.579> gear<00:03:04.090> and<00:03:04.360> then

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
saw was showing fifth gear and then

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.180 
saw was showing fifth gear and then
right<00:03:04.690> ahead<00:03:05.200> of<00:03:05.320> fifth<00:03:05.530> gear<00:03:05.799> was<00:03:06.040> the

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
right ahead of fifth gear was the

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.970 
right ahead of fifth gear was the
bearing<00:03:08.340> race<00:03:09.510> that

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
bearing race that

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.880 
bearing race that
is<00:03:12.550> kind<00:03:13.060> of<00:03:13.150> like<00:03:13.330> loosely<00:03:13.959> pressed<00:03:14.290> in<00:03:14.530> to

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
is kind of like loosely pressed in to

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.920 
is kind of like loosely pressed in to
the<00:03:15.010> main<00:03:15.190> case<00:03:15.489> of<00:03:15.849> the<00:03:16.030> transmission<00:03:16.720> and

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
the main case of the transmission and

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.640 
the main case of the transmission and
that<00:03:17.290> tail<00:03:17.650> housing<00:03:18.280> actually<00:03:19.470> holds<00:03:20.470> that

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
that tail housing actually holds that

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.970 
that tail housing actually holds that
race<00:03:20.950> against<00:03:21.459> the<00:03:22.379> the<00:03:23.379> bearing<00:03:23.739> on<00:03:23.890> the

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
race against the the bearing on the

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.440 
race against the the bearing on the
output<00:03:24.370> shaft<00:03:24.959> alright<00:03:25.959> so<00:03:26.290> in<00:03:26.500> reality<00:03:27.450> when

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
output shaft alright so in reality when

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.839 
output shaft alright so in reality when
I<00:03:28.480> took<00:03:28.569> the<00:03:28.840> tale<00:03:29.049> house<00:03:29.290> how<00:03:29.620> that<00:03:30.459> bearing

00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:30.849 
I took the tale house how that bearing

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:33.990 
I took the tale house how that bearing
race<00:03:31.090> could<00:03:31.780> have<00:03:31.870> moved<00:03:32.080> out<00:03:32.379> enough<00:03:33.370> our<00:03:33.610> -

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
race could have moved out enough our -

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.110 
race could have moved out enough our -
okay<00:03:34.660> or<00:03:35.019> even<00:03:35.260> more<00:03:35.500> now<00:03:36.400> I<00:03:36.430> don't<00:03:36.610> think<00:03:36.970> it

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
okay or even more now I don't think it

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.390 
okay or even more now I don't think it
did<00:03:37.330> that<00:03:38.260> noise<00:03:38.530> that<00:03:38.769> you<00:03:38.860> saw<00:03:39.099> was

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
did that noise that you saw was

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.069 
did that noise that you saw was
basically<00:03:39.760> the<00:03:39.940> noise<00:03:40.120> I<00:03:40.329> was<00:03:40.450> getting<00:03:40.870> and

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:41.079 
basically the noise I was getting and

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:42.660 
basically the noise I was getting and
that<00:03:41.110> the<00:03:41.409> play<00:03:41.650> I<00:03:41.680> was<00:03:41.890> getting<00:03:42.190> on<00:03:42.310> the<00:03:42.340> input

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
that the play I was getting on the input

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:43.920 
that the play I was getting on the input
shaft<00:03:42.849> but<00:03:43.000> I<00:03:43.060> should<00:03:43.269> have<00:03:43.390> shot<00:03:43.569> it<00:03:43.599> on<00:03:43.810> the

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
shaft but I should have shot it on the

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:50.369 
shaft but I should have shot it on the
input<00:03:44.200> shaft<00:03:44.410> anyways<00:03:47.489> yeah<00:03:48.510> so<00:03:49.510> I<00:03:49.840> just

00:03:50.369 --> 00:03:50.379 
input shaft anyways yeah so I just

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:52.080 
input shaft anyways yeah so I just
wanted<00:03:50.650> to<00:03:50.950> make<00:03:51.099> that<00:03:51.250> clear<00:03:51.459> I<00:03:51.579> realized

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
wanted to make that clear I realized

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.420 
wanted to make that clear I realized
that<00:03:52.329> that<00:03:52.629> wasn't<00:03:52.870> the<00:03:53.109> best<00:03:53.349> thing<00:03:53.440> to<00:03:53.560> do<00:03:53.859> to

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
that that wasn't the best thing to do to

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.660 
that that wasn't the best thing to do to
take<00:03:54.640> that<00:03:55.410> tail<00:03:56.410> shaft<00:03:56.709> off<00:03:57.099> and<00:03:57.400> then<00:03:57.489> show

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
take that tail shaft off and then show

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:58.860 
take that tail shaft off and then show
the<00:03:57.849> play<00:03:58.030> I<00:03:58.060> should<00:03:58.390> have<00:03:58.480> just<00:03:58.569> shown<00:03:58.750> the

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
the play I should have just shown the

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.449 
the play I should have just shown the
play<00:03:59.049> on<00:03:59.109> the<00:03:59.170> input<00:03:59.470> shaft<00:03:59.650> and<00:03:59.859> I<00:03:59.920> think<00:04:00.160> in

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
play on the input shaft and I think in

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:03.509 
play on the input shaft and I think in
in<00:04:00.849> an<00:04:01.390> extra<00:04:01.750> video<00:04:02.049> that<00:04:02.319> I<00:04:02.349> actually<00:04:03.010> do<00:04:03.370> do

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:03.519 
in an extra video that I actually do do

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:06.869 
in an extra video that I actually do do
this<00:04:03.760> I<00:04:04.510> show<00:04:05.500> the<00:04:05.650> play<00:04:05.859> but<00:04:06.040> again<00:04:06.280> I<00:04:06.609> show

00:04:06.869 --> 00:04:06.879 
this I show the play but again I show

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:08.520 
this I show the play but again I show
the<00:04:06.940> play<00:04:07.180> in<00:04:07.239> the<00:04:07.390> input<00:04:07.690> shaft<00:04:07.959> when<00:04:08.230> tail

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
the play in the input shaft when tail

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.490 
the play in the input shaft when tail
housing<00:04:08.859> is<00:04:08.980> out<00:04:09.160> so<00:04:09.459> it's<00:04:10.450> kind<00:04:10.690> of<00:04:10.720> like<00:04:10.930> I'm

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
housing is out so it's kind of like I'm

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.599 
housing is out so it's kind of like I'm
not<00:04:11.709> showing<00:04:11.980> the<00:04:12.069> real<00:04:12.220> deal<00:04:12.519> anyways<00:04:14.609> trust

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:15.609 
not showing the real deal anyways trust

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:18.060 
not showing the real deal anyways trust
me<00:04:15.760> I<00:04:15.790> you<00:04:16.450> know<00:04:16.570> there<00:04:16.930> was<00:04:17.139> play<00:04:17.470> on<00:04:17.769> that

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
me I you know there was play on that

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.159 
me I you know there was play on that
input<00:04:18.430> shaft<00:04:18.700> when<00:04:19.060> the<00:04:19.329> whole<00:04:19.479> transmission

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:20.169 
input shaft when the whole transmission

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:24.180 
input shaft when the whole transmission
was<00:04:20.410> intact<00:04:21.690> so<00:04:22.690> much<00:04:22.870> so<00:04:23.110> that<00:04:23.139> I<00:04:23.680> was<00:04:23.770> getting

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
was intact so much so that I was getting

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.110 
was intact so much so that I was getting
a<00:04:24.580> very<00:04:25.300> bad<00:04:25.660> bearing<00:04:26.229> noise<00:04:26.410> and<00:04:27.039> a<00:04:27.729> bearing

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
a very bad bearing noise and a bearing

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.350 
a very bad bearing noise and a bearing
noise<00:04:28.270> sounded<00:04:28.900> a<00:04:29.020> lot<00:04:29.229> like<00:04:29.820> what<00:04:30.820> I<00:04:31.060> just

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
noise sounded a lot like what I just

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.450 
noise sounded a lot like what I just
showed<00:04:31.570> you<00:04:31.870> in<00:04:31.990> the<00:04:32.080> video<00:04:32.200> so<00:04:32.740> that<00:04:33.010> was<00:04:33.280> one

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 
showed you in the video so that was one
