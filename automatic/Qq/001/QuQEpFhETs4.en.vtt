will do in relation to the vehicle the

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:09.300 
will do in relation to the vehicle the
wiring<00:07:07.990> harness<00:07:08.260> of<00:07:08.380> course<00:07:08.560> again<00:07:08.830> is<00:07:09.040> built

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:09.310 
wiring harness of course again is built

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:12.090 
wiring harness of course again is built
with<00:07:09.820> respect<00:07:10.240> to<00:07:10.630> the<00:07:11.290> vehicle<00:07:11.440> in<00:07:11.889> question

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:20.320 
vehicle but all wiring harnesses would

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:22.350 
vehicle but all wiring harnesses would
be<00:07:20.410> identical<00:07:20.770> in<00:07:21.190> relation<00:07:21.550> to<00:07:21.580> a<00:07:21.669> Dodge<00:07:21.970> or
