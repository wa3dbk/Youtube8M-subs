hi<00:00:03.060> everybody<00:00:03.449> megabit<00:00:03.870> gamer<00:00:04.200> here<00:00:04.500> once

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
hi everybody megabit gamer here once

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.249 
hi everybody megabit gamer here once
again<00:00:04.890> and<00:00:05.370> what<00:00:05.940> we<00:00:06.060> are<00:00:06.089> doing<00:00:06.299> today<00:00:06.569> is<00:00:06.690> a

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
again and what we are doing today is a

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.100 
again and what we are doing today is a
automatic<00:00:07.830> heart<00:00:08.130> dispenser<00:00:08.929> this<00:00:09.929> is

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
automatic heart dispenser this is

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.990 
automatic heart dispenser this is
actually<00:00:10.469> a<00:00:10.500> pretty<00:00:10.710> neat<00:00:10.889> set<00:00:11.160> up<00:00:11.309> here<00:00:11.610> you

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
actually a pretty neat set up here you

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.360 
actually a pretty neat set up here you
can<00:00:12.269> do<00:00:12.450> it<00:00:12.540> many<00:00:12.719> different<00:00:13.049> ways<00:00:13.200> but<00:00:14.160> the

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
can do it many different ways but the

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.480 
can do it many different ways but the
basic<00:00:14.910> circuit<00:00:15.450> of<00:00:15.599> it<00:00:15.719> is<00:00:15.900> the<00:00:16.139> same<00:00:16.490> key

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
basic circuit of it is the same key

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.330 
basic circuit of it is the same key
concepts<00:00:18.080> powertrack<00:00:19.080> you<00:00:19.619> need<00:00:19.800> a<00:00:19.830> lot<00:00:20.070> of<00:00:20.220> it

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
concepts powertrack you need a lot of it

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.490 
concepts powertrack you need a lot of it
to<00:00:20.460> keep<00:00:20.609> a.m.<00:00:21.000> to<00:00:21.119> cart<00:00:21.330> moving<00:00:21.500> unpowered

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
to keep a.m. to cart moving unpowered

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.279 
to keep a.m. to cart moving unpowered
track<00:00:22.830> will<00:00:23.039> stop<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:23.369> cart<00:00:23.699> and<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.960> diodes

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
track will stop a cart and the diodes

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.210 
track will stop a cart and the diodes
there<00:00:25.529> are<00:00:25.859> able<00:00:26.789> to<00:00:26.970> be<00:00:27.119> set<00:00:27.449> to<00:00:27.689> delay<00:00:28.619> so

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
there are able to be set to delay so

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.540 
there are able to be set to delay so
what<00:00:29.369> we<00:00:29.490> have<00:00:29.640> here<00:00:29.939> is<00:00:29.970> a<00:00:30.710> power<00:00:31.710> third<00:00:32.279> rail

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
what we have here is a power third rail

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.260 
what we have here is a power third rail
that<00:00:32.820> is<00:00:32.969> unpowered<00:00:33.420> to<00:00:33.840> stop<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.170> cards<00:00:34.500> and

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:35.270 
that is unpowered to stop the cards and

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.060 
that is unpowered to stop the cards and
then<00:00:36.270> we<00:00:36.390> have<00:00:36.510> a<00:00:36.540> little<00:00:36.719> gap<00:00:36.989> here<00:00:37.020> where<00:00:37.860> the

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
then we have a little gap here where the

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.979 
then we have a little gap here where the
cards<00:00:38.309> can<00:00:38.489> fall<00:00:38.700> onto<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.210> track<00:00:39.420> below<00:00:39.629> and

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
cards can fall onto the track below and

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.770 
cards can fall onto the track below and
it<00:00:40.710> curves<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.640> go<00:00:41.730> back<00:00:41.910> in<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.149> queue<00:00:42.360> now<00:00:44.780> if

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
it curves to go back in the queue now if

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.220 
it curves to go back in the queue now if
you<00:00:45.930> hit<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.140> button<00:00:46.760> one<00:00:47.760> falls<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.960> next

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
you hit the button one falls the next

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.319 
you hit the button one falls the next
one<00:00:49.379> releases<00:00:50.039> it's<00:00:50.610> like<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:50.850> chain<00:00:51.149> reaction

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
one releases it's like a chain reaction

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.139 
one releases it's like a chain reaction
oh<00:00:51.930> that<00:00:52.680> one<00:00:52.770> already<00:00:52.920> went<00:00:53.160> back<00:00:53.309> let's<00:00:54.000> see

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
oh that one already went back let's see

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.880 
oh that one already went back let's see
if<00:00:54.210> we<00:00:54.270> can<00:00:54.420> watch<00:00:54.539> that<00:00:54.600> again<00:00:56.420> and<00:00:57.890> that's

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
if we can watch that again and that's

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.410 
if we can watch that again and that's
how<00:00:59.010> you<00:00:59.070> return<00:00:59.399> one<00:00:59.550> of<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.699> same<00:00:59.879> track<00:01:00.149> is

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
how you return one of the same track is

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.020 
how you return one of the same track is
by<00:01:00.750> overlapping<00:01:01.230> it<00:01:01.530> but<00:01:02.280> yes<00:01:02.430> what<00:01:02.699> happens

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
by overlapping it but yes what happens

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.880 
by overlapping it but yes what happens
basically<00:01:03.210> is<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.750> first<00:01:03.989> one<00:01:04.170> powers<00:01:04.500> lets

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
basically is the first one powers lets

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.969 
basically is the first one powers lets
it<00:01:05.070> drop<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.909> then<00:01:06.570> it<00:01:06.720> unpowered<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.590> the

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
it drop and then it unpowered and the

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.039 
it drop and then it unpowered and the
second<00:01:08.340> one<00:01:08.490> powers<00:01:08.880> what's<00:01:09.479> that<00:01:09.600> one<00:01:09.840> drop

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
second one powers what's that one drop

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.980 
second one powers what's that one drop
and<00:01:10.290> so<00:01:10.680> on<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:10.950> so<00:01:11.010> forth<00:01:11.100> so<00:01:11.909> its<00:01:12.180> power<00:01:12.689> on

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
and so on and so forth so its power on

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.320 
and so on and so forth so its power on
power<00:01:13.439> then<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:13.950> next<00:01:14.070> one<00:01:14.310> powers<00:01:14.729> on<00:01:14.970> powers

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
power then the next one powers on powers

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.880 
power then the next one powers on powers
and<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.600> third<00:01:15.840> one<00:01:16.020> powers<00:01:16.380> empowers

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
and the third one powers empowers

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.219 
and the third one powers empowers
basically<00:01:17.759> sliding<00:01:18.210> them<00:01:18.360> down<00:01:18.390> one<00:01:18.960> at<00:01:18.990> a

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
basically sliding them down one at a

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.359 
basically sliding them down one at a
time<00:01:19.670> now<00:01:20.670> it's<00:01:21.000> delayed<00:01:21.390> between<00:01:21.810> them<00:01:22.369> so

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
time now it's delayed between them so

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.190 
time now it's delayed between them so
they<00:01:23.549> don't<00:01:23.670> all<00:01:23.970> power<00:01:24.270> on<00:01:24.509> at<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.750> same<00:01:24.960> time

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
they don't all power on at the same time

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.580 
they don't all power on at the same time
and<00:01:26.180> empower<00:01:27.180> at<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.450> same<00:01:27.659> time<00:01:27.840> which<00:01:28.439> would

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
and empower at the same time which would

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:29.990 
and empower at the same time which would
mean<00:01:28.770> all<00:01:28.979> your<00:01:29.100> cards<00:01:29.369> would<00:01:29.460> be<00:01:29.520> stuck<00:01:29.850> up

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
mean all your cards would be stuck up

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.679 
mean all your cards would be stuck up
there<00:01:30.180> in<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.360> front<00:01:31.880> so<00:01:32.880> what<00:01:33.180> we<00:01:33.270> did<00:01:33.450> here

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
there in the front so what we did here

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.080 
there in the front so what we did here
is<00:01:33.869> you<00:01:34.110> have<00:01:34.320> unpowered<00:01:35.220> powered<00:01:36.079> unpowered

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
is you have unpowered powered unpowered

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.250 
is you have unpowered powered unpowered
unpowered

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:40.260 
unpowered

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.820 
unpowered
tracks<00:01:41.010> and<00:01:42.170> what<00:01:43.170> we<00:01:43.260> did<00:01:43.410> here<00:01:43.620> was<00:01:43.680> we

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
tracks and what we did here was we

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.400 
tracks and what we did here was we
basically<00:01:44.280> ran<00:01:45.030> powered<00:01:45.360> track<00:01:45.630> all<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.290> way

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:46.410 
basically ran powered track all the way

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.860 
basically ran powered track all the way
up<00:01:46.590> until<00:01:46.890> we<00:01:47.310> get<00:01:47.460> up<00:01:47.640> here<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:48.270> it's

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:48.870 
up until we get up here and it's

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:50.420 
up until we get up here and it's
unpowered<00:01:49.380> because<00:01:49.890> we<00:01:50.040> don't<00:01:50.190> want<00:01:50.340> two

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
unpowered because we don't want two

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.600 
unpowered because we don't want two
hooked<00:01:50.580> into<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:51.270> actual<00:01:51.600> circuit<00:01:52.370> so<00:01:53.370> as<00:01:53.490> you

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
hooked into the actual circuit so as you

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.210 
hooked into the actual circuit so as you
can<00:01:53.700> see<00:01:53.910> here<00:01:54.360> each<00:01:55.350> one<00:01:55.710> of<00:01:55.770> these<00:01:55.920> has<00:01:55.980> a

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
can see here each one of these has a

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.430 
can see here each one of these has a
direct<00:01:56.490> line<00:01:56.610> into<00:01:57.000> it<00:01:57.150> now<00:01:57.660> note<00:01:57.900> this<00:01:58.110> does

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.440 
direct line into it now note this does

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.570 
direct line into it now note this does
work<00:01:58.470> for<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:59.040> xbox<00:01:59.460> 360<00:02:00.350> xbox<00:02:01.490> 360<00:02:02.490> is

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
work for the xbox 360 xbox 360 is

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.260 
work for the xbox 360 xbox 360 is
actually<00:02:02.940> where<00:02:03.240> I<00:02:03.270> built<00:02:03.840> this<00:02:04.110> and<00:02:05.000> this<00:02:06.000> one

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
actually where I built this and this one

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.620 
actually where I built this and this one
I<00:02:06.300> built<00:02:06.720> on<00:02:06.930> our<00:02:07.860> server<00:02:08.250> here<00:02:08.580> just<00:02:08.880> to<00:02:09.060> have

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
I built on our server here just to have

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.590 
I built on our server here just to have
it<00:02:09.660> for<00:02:09.990> people<00:02:10.229> to<00:02:10.320> be<00:02:10.410> able<00:02:10.470> to<00:02:10.619> look<00:02:10.710> at<00:02:10.950> and

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
it for people to be able to look at and

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.590 
it for people to be able to look at and
learn<00:02:12.600> from<00:02:12.630> tinker<00:02:13.410> width<00:02:13.590> etc<00:02:14.300> so<00:02:15.300> you<00:02:15.390> push

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
learn from tinker width etc so you push

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.220 
learn from tinker width etc so you push
the<00:02:15.750> button<00:02:15.780> goes<00:02:16.470> down<00:02:16.800> the<00:02:16.980> line<00:02:17.160> and<00:02:18.050> it<00:02:19.050> as

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
the button goes down the line and it as

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.110 
the button goes down the line and it as
it<00:02:19.860> goes<00:02:19.890> down<00:02:20.100> the<00:02:20.220> line<00:02:20.370> it<00:02:20.520> triggers<00:02:21.000> each

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
it goes down the line it triggers each

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.920 
it goes down the line it triggers each
one<00:02:21.390> so<00:02:21.750> button<00:02:22.440> it<00:02:22.680> goes<00:02:23.460> down<00:02:23.850> to<00:02:24.300> that<00:02:24.720> one

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
one so button it goes down to that one

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.860 
one so button it goes down to that one
but<00:02:25.890> it<00:02:25.980> also<00:02:26.160> goes<00:02:26.580> to<00:02:26.610> our<00:02:28.970> line<00:02:29.970> there<00:02:30.300> that

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
but it also goes to our line there that

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.110 
but it also goes to our line there that
triggers<00:02:31.260> the<00:02:31.380> second<00:02:31.770> one<00:02:31.890> then<00:02:32.820> it<00:02:32.940> goes<00:02:33.090> up

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
triggers the second one then it goes up

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.320 
triggers the second one then it goes up
and<00:02:33.450> triggers<00:02:33.840> the<00:02:34.080> third<00:02:34.350> one<00:02:34.590> now<00:02:34.940> no<00:02:35.940> I<00:02:35.970> use

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
and triggers the third one now no I use

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.810 
and triggers the third one now no I use
three<00:02:36.630> of<00:02:36.690> those<00:02:36.810> on<00:02:37.080> the<00:02:37.980> xbox<00:02:38.310> version<00:02:38.490> you

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
three of those on the xbox version you

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.800 
three of those on the xbox version you
can<00:02:38.940> use<00:02:39.120> two<00:02:39.420> then<00:02:39.840> three<00:02:39.870> then<00:02:40.260> four<00:02:40.790> but

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
can use two then three then four but

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.670 
can use two then three then four but
depending<00:02:42.810> on<00:02:42.900> your<00:02:42.959> wiring<00:02:43.170> you<00:02:43.290> should<00:02:43.530> just

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
depending on your wiring you should just

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.420 
depending on your wiring you should just
use<00:02:43.860> three<00:02:44.190> on<00:02:44.310> each<00:02:44.540> 1333<00:02:45.650> between<00:02:46.650> each<00:02:47.370> set

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
use three on each 1333 between each set

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.310 
use three on each 1333 between each set
of<00:02:47.760> cards<00:02:48.060> you<00:02:48.150> should<00:02:48.180> only<00:02:48.390> need<00:02:48.540> to<00:02:48.810> because

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
of cards you should only need to because

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.080 
of cards you should only need to because
the<00:02:49.440> first<00:02:49.650> one<00:02:49.860> is<00:02:49.890> going<00:02:50.010> to<00:02:50.100> be<00:02:50.160> instant<00:02:50.670> the

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
the first one is going to be instant the

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.780 
the first one is going to be instant the
next<00:02:51.390> one's<00:02:51.540> going<00:02:51.690> to<00:02:51.720> be<00:02:51.810> a<00:02:51.840> three<00:02:52.140> space<00:02:52.440> and

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
next one's going to be a three space and

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.830 
next one's going to be a three space and
the<00:02:53.790> next<00:02:54.000> one<00:02:54.150> after<00:02:54.270> that's<00:02:54.540> going<00:02:54.690> to<00:02:54.750> be<00:02:54.810> a

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
the next one after that's going to be a

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.250 
the next one after that's going to be a
three<00:02:55.050> space<00:02:55.320> you<00:02:56.040> need<00:02:56.250> to<00:02:56.660> click<00:02:57.660> on<00:02:57.870> it<00:02:58.080> to

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
three space you need to click on it to

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.509 
three space you need to click on it to
spread<00:02:59.100> those<00:02:59.340> two<00:02:59.959> diode<00:03:00.959> torches<00:03:01.860> apart<00:03:02.190> to

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
spread those two diode torches apart to

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:05.240 
spread those two diode torches apart to
give<00:03:02.730> it<00:03:02.850> more<00:03:03.060> time<00:03:03.120> as<00:03:03.800> you<00:03:04.800> see<00:03:04.980> from<00:03:05.100> the

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
give it more time as you see from the

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.740 
give it more time as you see from the
heads-up<00:03:05.519> view<00:03:05.700> here<00:03:05.910> it<00:03:06.060> goes<00:03:06.269> right<00:03:06.690> down

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
heads-up view here it goes right down

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.580 
heads-up view here it goes right down
the<00:03:07.110> edge<00:03:07.230> there<00:03:07.530> and<00:03:07.769> let's<00:03:08.160> watch<00:03:08.400> it<00:03:09.590> okay

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
the edge there and let's watch it okay

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.580 
the edge there and let's watch it okay
see<00:03:10.650> as<00:03:11.040> it<00:03:11.459> goes<00:03:11.580> down<00:03:11.850> triggering<00:03:12.420> the<00:03:13.170> next

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
see as it goes down triggering the next

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.190 
see as it goes down triggering the next
one<00:03:13.709> it<00:03:13.860> triggers<00:03:14.480> so<00:03:15.480> this<00:03:15.690> is<00:03:15.780> actually<00:03:15.959> very

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
one it triggers so this is actually very

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.190 
one it triggers so this is actually very
simple<00:03:16.910> on/off<00:03:17.910> next<00:03:18.900> on<00:03:19.019> off<00:03:19.470> next<00:03:20.130> on<00:03:20.430> off

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
simple on/off next on off next on off

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.760 
simple on/off next on off next on off
next<00:03:22.040> kind<00:03:22.760> of<00:03:22.849> thing<00:03:23.060> and<00:03:23.930> you<00:03:24.319> could<00:03:24.470> do<00:03:24.590> this

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:24.770 
next kind of thing and you could do this

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:27.509 
next kind of thing and you could do this
Holly<00:03:25.190> stackable<00:03:25.849> with<00:03:26.000> a<00:03:26.030> bunch<00:03:26.450> of<00:03:26.660> them

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
Holly stackable with a bunch of them

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:30.910 
Holly stackable with a bunch of them
it's<00:03:28.519> really<00:03:29.269> not<00:03:29.540> that<00:03:29.599> hard<00:03:29.810> of<00:03:30.410> a<00:03:30.590> wiring

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
it's really not that hard of a wiring

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.830 
it's really not that hard of a wiring
diagram<00:03:31.040> it's<00:03:31.760> just<00:03:32.030> actually<00:03:32.209> taking<00:03:32.750> the

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
diagram it's just actually taking the

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.449 
diagram it's just actually taking the
time<00:03:32.959> to<00:03:33.110> think<00:03:33.290> about<00:03:33.440> it<00:03:33.590> and<00:03:33.830> figure<00:03:33.890> it<00:03:34.280> out

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
time to think about it and figure it out

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:39.370 
time to think about it and figure it out
so<00:03:36.220> let's<00:03:37.220> take<00:03:37.370> a<00:03:37.430> look<00:03:37.670> at<00:03:37.790> this<00:03:37.880> here<00:03:38.380> that

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
so let's take a look at this here that

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.920 
so let's take a look at this here that
is<00:03:39.709> what<00:03:40.040> you<00:03:40.190> see<00:03:40.370> there<00:03:40.610> you<00:03:41.330> have<00:03:41.599> your

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
is what you see there you have your

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.790 
is what you see there you have your
track<00:03:42.769> and<00:03:43.400> we<00:03:43.880> have<00:03:44.090> this<00:03:44.420> one<00:03:44.690> a<00:03:44.870> nice<00:03:45.560> little

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:45.800 
track and we have this one a nice little

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.370 
track and we have this one a nice little
looping<00:03:46.130> return<00:03:46.489> there<00:03:46.760> and<00:03:47.110> then<00:03:48.110> it<00:03:48.140> loops

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
looping return there and then it loops

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.949 
looping return there and then it loops
back<00:03:48.500> and<00:03:48.860> goes<00:03:48.980> up<00:03:49.239> so<00:03:50.239> you<00:03:50.629> can<00:03:50.780> actually

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
back and goes up so you can actually

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:54.670 
back and goes up so you can actually
create<00:03:51.530> one<00:03:52.010> of<00:03:52.129> these<00:03:52.250> on<00:03:52.400> each<00:03:52.610> side<00:03:53.650> like<00:03:54.650> a

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
create one of these on each side like a

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.250 
create one of these on each side like a
station<00:03:55.280> almost<00:03:55.400> and<00:03:55.989> what<00:03:56.989> ends<00:03:57.140> up

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
station almost and what ends up

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.100 
station almost and what ends up
happening<00:03:57.319> is<00:03:58.360> you<00:03:59.360> don't<00:03:59.480> have<00:03:59.720> to<00:03:59.870> worry

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
happening is you don't have to worry

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.050 
happening is you don't have to worry
about<00:04:00.319> running<00:04:00.950> two<00:04:01.220> tracks<00:04:01.489> because<00:04:01.730> you<00:04:01.940> can

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
about running two tracks because you can

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.930 
about running two tracks because you can
use<00:04:02.180> the<00:04:02.269> same<00:04:02.480> track<00:04:02.750> they<00:04:03.260> overlap<00:04:03.819> which<00:04:04.819> is

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:04.940 
use the same track they overlap which is

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:06.550 
use the same track they overlap which is
a<00:04:04.970> really<00:04:05.150> nice<00:04:05.329> thing<00:04:05.630> because<00:04:06.049> it's<00:04:06.410> like

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
a really nice thing because it's like

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.890 
a really nice thing because it's like
hey<00:04:06.769> I<00:04:07.010> can<00:04:07.910> make<00:04:08.060> one<00:04:08.209> of<00:04:08.269> these<00:04:08.329> dispensers

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
hey I can make one of these dispensers
