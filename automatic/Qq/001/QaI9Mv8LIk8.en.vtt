00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 among the tide of bad books by 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:09.210
 architecture that is not worth 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:13.590
 buy emerges because finally a 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:19.039
 good book serious very serious ad of laws 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:24.930
 and vienna by marco pogacnik pogacnik 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:27.150
 published by beth paintings price 38r not 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.939
 be fooled by the title, however 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.850
 title adolf loos and vienna could do 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.890
 think of architectures at all 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.380
 architectures that adolf loos realizes 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.040
 vienna instead should be interpreted in this 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.540
 way is the relationship that adolf loos in the 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.600
 realize what his masterpiece 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.239
 the house on the best plus entertains 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.149
 with Viennese architecture and therefore 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:55.140
 adolf loos and vienna is to be interpreted 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:57.960
 how the relationship that adolf loss to with the 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.500
 context with history with tradition 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.570
 of the city 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.629
 what emerges from this the relationship that 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.070
 the os is not the first architect 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:08.010
 modernist but the architect so 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.080
 linked to the tradition that can be 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.540
 find his antecedents also in 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.270
 Viennese eighteenth century architecture e 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.000
 this bug on the mic proves it with a 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:21.780
 erudition and an analytical capacity 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.390
 truly surprising the result is 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.580
 paradoxical because if this is to pay for it 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.560
 which is a virtue chemical era is one 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.229
 historian formed in the tradition by 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.950
 foriana and therefore with a bot vision 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.270
 let's say traditionalist of the 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:39.030
 of architecture for us is not that 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.659
 further proof of this ambiguity of 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:45.950
 laws architect that ambiguity that it 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:48.869
 same critic and greatest critic 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:51.620
 of Italian architecture 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.380
 Edward the perch had set in 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:58.310
 fidenza losma loss fund an architect 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:01.660
 or that is not as great as they would like 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:04.580
 see the traditionalist ventilation 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:06.280
 try again here it is look at me 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.960
 looks like the first great work 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.860
 of modern architecture but I would say 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.310
 just not 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:16.070
 after all the same who is after you 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.500
 an initial infatuation with heads that the os 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:21.620
 he was not the great architect of whom one is 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:24.290
 would have to fall in love or script but 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:28.460
 now we are waiting for a loss book in Paris 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:32.360
 in paris you discover a second life yes 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:34.730
 rivals the corbusier puts 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.640
 questioning its own 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:41.030
 in short, a lot more loss of architecture 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:44.290
 nice and much more stimulating strong 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.290
 a more beach look
