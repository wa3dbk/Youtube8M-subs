however I do think that it adds just a

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.540 
however I do think that it adds just a
little<00:01:00.570> depth<00:01:01.050> of<00:01:01.199> flavor<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.280> alcohol

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
little depth of flavor and the alcohol

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.340 
little depth of flavor and the alcohol
