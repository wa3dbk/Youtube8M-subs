00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
is this since three still needs a sim

because<00:02:47.730> they<00:02:47.910> usually<00:02:48.030> do<00:02:48.300> I<00:02:48.330> think<00:02:48.630> they<00:02:48.720> do

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
because they usually do I think they do

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.560 
because they usually do I think they do
that<00:02:49.050> and<00:02:49.230> all<00:02:49.380> of<00:02:49.560> them<00:02:49.680> and<00:02:50.330> they<00:02:51.330> probably

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
that and all of them and they probably

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.780 
that and all of them and they probably
look<00:02:52.200> forward<00:02:52.620> to<00:02:52.770> having<00:02:52.890> some<00:02:53.280> three

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
look forward to having some three

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.330 
look forward to having some three
seasons<00:02:54.300> before<00:02:54.510> a<00:02:54.780> sims<00:02:55.260> 4<00:02:55.590> I<00:02:55.860> would<00:02:56.070> imagine

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
seasons before a sims 4 I would imagine

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.870 
seasons before a sims 4 I would imagine
I'm<00:02:57.440> start<00:02:58.440> talking<00:02:58.710> about<00:02:58.770> a<00:02:58.860> wish<00:02:59.100> list<00:02:59.340> good

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
I'm start talking about a wish list good

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.390 
I'm start talking about a wish list good
ideas<00:03:00.180> for<00:03:00.420> the<00:03:00.480> sims<00:03:00.690> 4<00:03:00.780> that<00:03:01.770> could<00:03:01.920> possibly

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
ideas for the sims 4 that could possibly

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.090 
ideas for the sims 4 that could possibly
be<00:03:02.490> in<00:03:02.700> it<00:03:02.850> also<00:03:03.030> all<00:03:03.990> they<00:03:04.200> need<00:03:04.350> more<00:03:04.500> cars<00:03:04.800> in

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
be in it also all they need more cars in

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.850 
be in it also all they need more cars in
the<00:03:05.190> base<00:03:05.370> game<00:03:05.400> so<00:03:05.970> not<00:03:06.810> just<00:03:06.960> like<00:03:07.170> a<00:03:07.320> few<00:03:07.620> but

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
the base game so not just like a few but

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.940 
the base game so not just like a few but
like<00:03:08.040> maybe<00:03:08.490> like<00:03:08.580> 20<00:03:09.180> or<00:03:09.300> 30<00:03:09.510> a<00:03:09.780> lot<00:03:10.410> obviously

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
like maybe like 20 or 30 a lot obviously

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.500 
like maybe like 20 or 30 a lot obviously
better<00:03:11.520> graphics<00:03:12.030> which<00:03:12.180> is<00:03:12.330> definitely

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
better graphics which is definitely

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.470 
better graphics which is definitely
gonna<00:03:13.230> happen<00:03:13.770> because<00:03:13.920> having<00:03:14.310> it<00:03:14.970> always<00:03:15.300> is

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
gonna happen because having it always is

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.860 
gonna happen because having it always is
in<00:03:15.800> boats<00:03:16.800> they<00:03:17.280> need<00:03:17.460> boats<00:03:17.820> like<00:03:18.390> so<00:03:18.750> the

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
in boats they need boats like so the

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.330 
in boats they need boats like so the
sims<00:03:19.110> if<00:03:19.350> they<00:03:19.470> live<00:03:19.650> on<00:03:19.770> a<00:03:19.800> lake<00:03:19.920> they<00:03:20.190> could

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
sims if they live on a lake they could

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.880 
sims if they live on a lake they could
drive<00:03:20.490> boats<00:03:20.790> jet<00:03:21.210> skis<00:03:22.110> waverunners

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
drive boats jet skis waverunners

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.160 
drive boats jet skis waverunners
whatever<00:03:23.340> the<00:03:24.000> water<00:03:24.240> skiing<00:03:24.420> tubing<00:03:24.840> all

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
whatever the water skiing tubing all

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.210 
whatever the water skiing tubing all
that<00:03:25.380> fun<00:03:25.620> stuff<00:03:26.120> they<00:03:27.120> need<00:03:27.150> like<00:03:27.600> more

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
that fun stuff they need like more

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.130 
that fun stuff they need like more
objects<00:03:29.220> so<00:03:29.940> more<00:03:30.330> objects<00:03:30.750> in<00:03:30.840> the<00:03:30.930> base<00:03:31.110> game

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
objects so more objects in the base game

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.720 
objects so more objects in the base game
there's<00:03:31.650> not<00:03:31.770> enough<00:03:32.040> in<00:03:32.190> the<00:03:32.280> base<00:03:32.430> game<00:03:32.460> I

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
there's not enough in the base game I

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.460 
there's not enough in the base game I
mean<00:03:32.970> you<00:03:33.030> need<00:03:33.270> more<00:03:33.480> of<00:03:33.510> a<00:03:33.600> variety<00:03:34.140> instead

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
mean you need more of a variety instead

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:35.990 
mean you need more of a variety instead
of<00:03:34.530> buying<00:03:34.650> all<00:03:34.800> these<00:03:34.920> expansion<00:03:35.520> packs<00:03:35.730> and

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
of buying all these expansion packs and

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.380 
of buying all these expansion packs and
to<00:03:36.420> get<00:03:36.570> them<00:03:36.690> all<00:03:36.780> um<00:03:37.880> it'd<00:03:38.880> be<00:03:39.030> cool<00:03:39.240> if<00:03:39.270> you

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
to get them all um it'd be cool if you

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.480 
to get them all um it'd be cool if you
can<00:03:39.510> actually<00:03:39.660> control<00:03:40.380> the<00:03:40.440> car<00:03:40.740> the<00:03:41.070> boat<00:03:41.250> so

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:41.490 
can actually control the car the boat so

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:43.460 
can actually control the car the boat so
once<00:03:41.730> your<00:03:41.850> sim<00:03:42.060> got<00:03:42.330> in<00:03:42.510> it<00:03:42.660> it'd<00:03:43.170> be<00:03:43.410> the

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
once your sim got in it it'd be the

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.770 
once your sim got in it it'd be the
first<00:03:43.770> person<00:03:43.950> you<00:03:44.220> control<00:03:44.820> it<00:03:44.850> that<00:03:45.600> leads

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
first person you control it that leads

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.750 
first person you control it that leads
me<00:03:45.900> to<00:03:46.170> saying<00:03:46.470> that<00:03:46.770> there<00:03:47.190> should<00:03:47.400> be<00:03:47.490> a

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
me to saying that there should be a

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.820 
me to saying that there should be a
first-person<00:03:48.540> mode<00:03:48.780> I<00:03:49.170> don't<00:03:49.560> know<00:03:49.620> if<00:03:49.680> there

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
first-person mode I don't know if there

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:51.800 
first-person mode I don't know if there
is<00:03:49.950> there<00:03:50.160> might<00:03:50.310> be<00:03:50.340> in<00:03:50.490> the<00:03:50.550> sims<00:03:50.760> 3<00:03:51.000> where

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
is there might be in the sims 3 where

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.180 
is there might be in the sims 3 where
like<00:03:51.990> if<00:03:52.050> you're<00:03:52.560> walking<00:03:52.680> around<00:03:52.860> your<00:03:53.040> house

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
like if you're walking around your house

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.340 
like if you're walking around your house
you<00:03:53.340> go<00:03:53.430> to<00:03:53.490> first<00:03:53.970> person<00:03:54.450> you're<00:03:54.960> actually<00:03:55.170> a

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
you go to first person you're actually a

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.260 
you go to first person you're actually a
sim<00:03:55.740> you<00:03:55.950> walk<00:03:56.160> around<00:03:56.370> using<00:03:56.850> with<00:03:57.150> the

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:57.270 
sim you walk around using with the

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:01.010 
sim you walk around using with the
arrows<00:03:57.600> or<00:03:57.810> something<00:03:58.260> like<00:03:58.350> that<00:03:58.470> um<00:04:00.020> they

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:01.020 
arrows or something like that um they

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:02.150 
arrows or something like that um they
definitely<00:04:01.200> need<00:04:01.470> more<00:04:01.500> stuff<00:04:01.800> in<00:04:01.920> the<00:04:01.980> base

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
definitely need more stuff in the base

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.830 
definitely need more stuff in the base
game<00:04:02.190> as<00:04:02.580> I<00:04:02.670> said<00:04:02.880> they<00:04:03.060> need<00:04:03.210> more<00:04:03.330> maps<00:04:03.570> in

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
game as I said they need more maps in

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.170 
game as I said they need more maps in
the<00:04:03.870> base<00:04:04.080> game<00:04:04.110> so<00:04:04.680> not<00:04:04.980> just<00:04:05.130> one<00:04:05.400> like<00:04:05.610> not

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
the base game so not just one like not

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.480 
the base game so not just one like not
just<00:04:06.360> one<00:04:06.840> sunset<00:04:07.140> valley<00:04:07.470> like<00:04:07.890> know<00:04:08.100> they

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:08.490 
just one sunset valley like know they

00:04:59.720 --> 00:04:59.730 
obviously the online gameplay would be a

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:05.710 
obviously the online gameplay would be a
cool<00:04:59.970> idea<00:05:00.560> mom<00:05:02.390> the<00:05:03.390> I'm<00:05:03.420> in<00:05:03.720> gameplay<00:05:03.960> I

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:05.720

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
don't know how they would set it up but

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.230 
don't know how they would set it up but
probably<00:05:08.280> like<00:05:08.490> you're<00:05:08.700> all<00:05:08.790> in<00:05:08.910> the<00:05:09.000> world

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
probably like you're all in the world

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.270 
probably like you're all in the world
but<00:05:10.080> you're<00:05:10.200> probably<00:05:10.440> probably<00:05:10.770> a<00:05:10.950> sin<00:05:11.250> but

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 
but you're probably probably a sin but

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.980 
but you're probably probably a sin but
you<00:05:11.550> can<00:05:11.670> also<00:05:11.790> build<00:05:12.060> together<00:05:12.300> maybe<00:05:12.660> like

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
you can also build together maybe like

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:14.330 
you can also build together maybe like
