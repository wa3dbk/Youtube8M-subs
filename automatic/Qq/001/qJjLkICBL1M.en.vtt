reviews<00:00:45.300> on<00:00:45.780> this<00:00:46.230> particular<00:00:46.500> figure<00:00:46.950> I<00:00:47.360> was

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
reviews on this particular figure I was

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.520 
reviews on this particular figure I was
I<00:00:48.539> had<00:00:48.780> high<00:00:48.989> hopes<00:00:49.020> for<00:00:49.500> this<00:00:49.590> figure<00:00:49.800> but

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
I had high hopes for this figure but

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.229 
I had high hopes for this figure but
he's<00:00:52.530> not<00:00:52.710> as<00:00:52.890> disappointing<00:00:53.520> as<00:00:53.610> I<00:00:53.760> I<00:00:54.000> thought

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
he's not as disappointing as I I thought

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.600 
he's not as disappointing as I I thought
he<00:00:54.390> would<00:00:54.539> be<00:00:54.570> but<00:00:55.140> I<00:00:55.559> do<00:00:56.100> have<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.399> lot<00:00:56.579> of

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
he would be but I do have a lot of

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.000 
he would be but I do have a lot of
issues<00:00:56.820> with<00:00:57.000> him<00:00:57.420> first<00:00:58.199> off<00:00:58.410> just<00:00:58.620> like<00:00:58.739> the

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
issues with him first off just like the

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:05.299 
issues with him first off just like the
jazz<00:01:00.079> figure<00:01:01.579> he<00:01:02.579> cannot<00:01:03.510> be<00:01:04.320> posed<00:01:04.619> in<00:01:04.979> a<00:01:05.070> bent

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
jazz figure he cannot be posed in a bent

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.880 
jazz figure he cannot be posed in a bent
position<00:01:05.519> because<00:01:06.210> you<00:01:06.360> just<00:01:06.750> step<00:01:06.960> over<00:01:07.140> the

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
position because you just step over the

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.770 
position because you just step over the
reason<00:01:08.250> being<00:01:08.369> is<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.729> engineering<00:01:09.330> that

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
reason being is the engineering that

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.170 
reason being is the engineering that
forgot<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.530> well<00:01:11.250> they<00:01:11.490> don't<00:01:11.640> have<00:01:11.850> as<00:01:12.000> much

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
forgot to well they don't have as much

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.570 
forgot to well they don't have as much
he<00:01:12.330> doesn't<00:01:12.360> have<00:01:12.659> as<00:01:12.780> much<00:01:13.159> length<00:01:14.159> for<00:01:14.460> his

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
he doesn't have as much length for his

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.410 
he doesn't have as much length for his
heel<00:01:14.930> inside<00:01:15.930> rather<00:01:16.530> than<00:01:16.650> outside<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.460> it

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
heel inside rather than outside and it

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.780 
heel inside rather than outside and it
does<00:01:18.689> not<00:01:18.990> balance<00:01:19.560> him<00:01:19.950> very<00:01:20.220> well<00:01:20.340> so<00:01:20.700> the

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
does not balance him very well so the

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.330 
does not balance him very well so the
only<00:01:20.939> way<00:01:21.090> you<00:01:21.180> can<00:01:21.299> send<00:01:21.540> him<00:01:21.689> genuinely<00:01:22.530> in<00:01:23.220> a

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
only way you can send him genuinely in a

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.510 
only way you can send him genuinely in a
good<00:01:23.520> position<00:01:23.670> is<00:01:24.320> you<00:01:25.320> know<00:01:25.520> straight

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
good position is you know straight

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.179 
good position is you know straight
straight<00:01:26.909> knees<00:01:27.439> try<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:28.560> bending<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.009> knees

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
straight knees try and bending the knees

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.560 
straight knees try and bending the knees
and<00:01:29.570> this<00:01:30.570> is<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:31.350> best<00:01:31.650> you<00:01:31.829> can<00:01:31.979> do<00:01:32.420> the<00:01:33.420> one

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
and this is the best you can do the one

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:34.910 
and this is the best you can do the one
thing<00:01:33.600> I<00:01:33.810> like<00:01:33.990> about<00:01:34.020> him<00:01:34.350> is<00:01:34.409> because<00:01:34.619> of<00:01:34.740> the

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
thing I like about him is because of the

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.850 
thing I like about him is because of the
transformation<00:01:35.130> is<00:01:35.790> that<00:01:36.270> his<00:01:37.200> head<00:01:37.530> does

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
transformation is that his head does

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.149 
transformation is that his head does
rotate<00:01:38.780> the<00:01:39.780> downside<00:01:40.320> being<00:01:40.590> is<00:01:40.890> that<00:01:41.040> his

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
rotate the downside being is that his

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.690 
rotate the downside being is that his
cannon<00:01:41.640> which<00:01:41.880> is<00:01:42.030> supposed<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.540> be<00:01:42.720> like<00:01:43.140> a

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
cannon which is supposed to be like a

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.370 
cannon which is supposed to be like a
shoulder<00:01:44.700> cannon<00:01:44.939> goes<00:01:45.540> with<00:01:45.780> his<00:01:45.930> head<00:01:46.170> and

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
shoulder cannon goes with his head and

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.899 
shoulder cannon goes with his head and
you<00:01:46.439> can<00:01:46.590> clearly<00:01:46.799> see<00:01:47.130> just<00:01:47.399> comes<00:01:47.670> right<00:01:47.790> out

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
you can clearly see just comes right out

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.560 
you can clearly see just comes right out
of<00:01:48.030> his<00:01:48.149> ears<00:01:48.479> which<00:01:48.750> is<00:01:48.899> kind<00:01:49.140> of<00:01:49.200> funny<00:01:50.570> but

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
of his ears which is kind of funny but

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.270 
of his ears which is kind of funny but
if<00:01:51.869> you<00:01:51.990> keep<00:01:52.140> him<00:01:52.320> in<00:01:52.439> a<00:01:52.500> certain<00:01:52.680> position

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
if you keep him in a certain position

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.170 
if you keep him in a certain position
facing<00:01:54.030> his<00:01:54.479> right<00:01:54.799> right<00:01:55.799> so<00:01:56.070> you<00:01:56.430> can<00:01:56.909> will

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
facing his right right so you can will

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.609 
facing his right right so you can will
still<00:01:57.479> look<00:01:57.630> like<00:01:57.689> it's<00:01:57.990> a<00:01:58.049> shoulder<00:01:58.380> can

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
still look like it's a shoulder can

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.850 
still look like it's a shoulder can
instead<00:01:58.920> of<00:01:59.070> a<00:01:59.189> an<00:01:59.399> air<00:02:00.240> cannon<00:02:00.770> but<00:02:01.770> that's

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
instead of a an air cannon but that's

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.000 
instead of a an air cannon but that's
that's<00:02:03.340> about<00:02:03.580> it<00:02:03.640> oh<00:02:04.060> and<00:02:04.690> the<00:02:05.170> ball<00:02:05.680> joint

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.010 
that's about it oh and the ball joint

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.880 
that's about it oh and the ball joint
for<00:02:06.250> the<00:02:06.370> arms<00:02:06.730> are<00:02:06.910> placed<00:02:07.660> way<00:02:08.259> behind<00:02:08.679> this

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
for the arms are placed way behind this

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.190 
for the arms are placed way behind this
Arzo<00:02:09.340> when<00:02:09.520> you<00:02:09.610> extend<00:02:09.910> his<00:02:10.090> arm<00:02:10.360> it's<00:02:10.990> like

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
Arzo when you extend his arm it's like

to complete the way for the legends
class<00:03:00.400> figures<00:03:00.790> I<00:03:01.000> think<00:03:01.330> you<00:03:01.420> can<00:03:01.570> probably

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
class figures I think you can probably

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:10.920 
class figures I think you can probably
buy<00:03:02.800> him<00:03:05.670> let<00:03:06.670> me<00:03:06.760> just<00:03:06.940> compare<00:03:07.360> him<00:03:07.799> ok<00:03:09.930> he's

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
buy him let me just compare him ok he's

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.830 
buy him let me just compare him ok he's
very<00:03:11.049> small<00:03:11.590> so<00:03:12.370> transform<00:03:12.880> him<00:03:13.060> just<00:03:13.510> put

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
very small so transform him just put

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.780 
very small so transform him just put
this<00:03:13.930> feet<00:03:14.230> together<00:03:14.380> just<00:03:15.340> like<00:03:15.459> a<00:03:15.519> regular

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
this feet together just like a regular

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.740 
this feet together just like a regular
g1<00:03:16.390> character<00:03:17.230> the<00:03:18.220> transformation<00:03:18.670> is<00:03:19.120> very

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
g1 character the transformation is very

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.220 
g1 character the transformation is very
simple<00:03:20.320> but<00:03:21.160> tricky<00:03:21.720> slightly<00:03:22.720> tricky<00:03:23.049> with<00:03:23.200> a

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
simple but tricky slightly tricky with a

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.920 
simple but tricky slightly tricky with a
head<00:03:23.440> what<00:03:24.160> you<00:03:24.310> do<00:03:24.430> is<00:03:24.670> you<00:03:24.970> try<00:03:25.390> and<00:03:25.540> raise<00:03:25.720> up

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
head what you do is you try and raise up

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.259 
head what you do is you try and raise up
the<00:03:25.959> cannon<00:03:26.380> this<00:03:26.590> way<00:03:26.799> this<00:03:27.640> is<00:03:27.850> only<00:03:28.000> way

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:28.269 
the cannon this way this is only way

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:30.090 
the cannon this way this is only way
you're<00:03:28.900> going<00:03:29.049> to<00:03:29.110> transform<00:03:29.590> it<00:03:29.739> because<00:03:29.980> the

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
you're going to transform it because the

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.670 
you're going to transform it because the
cannon<00:03:30.430> sort<00:03:30.640> of<00:03:30.730> Locksley<00:03:31.480> chest<00:03:31.780> in<00:03:32.049> this

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
cannon sort of Locksley chest in this

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.490 
cannon sort of Locksley chest in this
position<00:03:33.220> so<00:03:33.519> slightly<00:03:34.299> just<00:03:34.600> it<00:03:35.260> doesn't

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
position so slightly just it doesn't

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:36.900 
position so slightly just it doesn't
work<00:03:35.709> this<00:03:35.920> way<00:03:35.980> it<00:03:36.310> has<00:03:36.459> to<00:03:36.489> work<00:03:36.760> through

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
work this way it has to work through

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.060 
work this way it has to work through
this<00:03:37.000> way<00:03:37.209> put<00:03:37.420> the<00:03:37.510> cannon<00:03:37.780> behind<00:03:38.070> slightly

mean<00:04:37.849> you<00:04:38.270> could<00:04:38.389> display<00:04:38.720> him<00:04:38.780> this<00:04:39.080> way<00:04:39.320> and

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 
mean you could display him this way and

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.890 
mean you could display him this way and
it<00:04:39.889> wouldn't<00:04:40.099> be<00:04:40.160> a<00:04:40.190> problem<00:04:40.690> most<00:04:41.690> of<00:04:41.810> these

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900 
it wouldn't be a problem most of these

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.920 
it wouldn't be a problem most of these
legends<00:04:42.349> figures<00:04:42.710> i<00:04:42.949> will<00:04:43.669> probably<00:04:43.930> display

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:44.930 
legends figures i will probably display

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.379 
legends figures i will probably display
them<00:04:45.139> in<00:04:45.370> vehicle<00:04:46.370> mode<00:04:46.550> or<00:04:46.759> an<00:04:46.849> Altima<00:04:47.210> like

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:47.389 
them in vehicle mode or an Altima like

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:48.670 
them in vehicle mode or an Altima like
this<00:04:47.539> guy<00:04:47.720> this<00:04:47.990> guy<00:04:48.110> stays<00:04:48.440> like<00:04:48.650> this

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
this guy this guy stays like this

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.159 
this guy this guy stays like this
because<00:04:49.070> this<00:04:49.419> robot<00:04:50.419> mode<00:04:50.660> it's<00:04:50.900> just

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:51.169 
because this robot mode it's just

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:56.500 
because this robot mode it's just
horrendous<00:04:52.479> the<00:04:53.479> Jazz<00:04:54.370> figure<00:04:55.370> bot<00:04:56.060> mode<00:04:56.270> and

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:56.510 
horrendous the Jazz figure bot mode and

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:58.120 
horrendous the Jazz figure bot mode and
car<00:04:56.690> mode<00:04:56.900> probably<00:04:57.440> the<00:04:57.530> caramel<00:04:57.919> is<00:04:57.949> a

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.130 
car mode probably the caramel is a

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:03.189 
car mode probably the caramel is a
better<00:04:58.340> mode<00:05:00.099> the<00:05:01.099> Megatron<00:05:01.639> you<00:05:02.360> go<00:05:03.050> either

00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:03.199 
better mode the Megatron you go either

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:09.040 
better mode the Megatron you go either
way<00:05:03.349> you<00:05:03.889> can<00:05:04.039> do<00:05:04.130> in<00:05:04.250> alt<00:05:04.940> mode<00:05:05.380> so<00:05:06.380> or<00:05:08.050> turn

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 
way you can do in alt mode so or turn

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.260 
way you can do in alt mode so or turn
them<00:05:09.169> into<00:05:09.320> pokémon<00:05:10.159> Padma<00:05:10.550> it<00:05:10.849> is<00:05:11.030> pretty

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.270 
them into pokémon Padma it is pretty

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:14.140 
them into pokémon Padma it is pretty
cool<00:05:11.479> I<00:05:11.720> mean<00:05:11.990> not<00:05:12.770> a<00:05:12.830> lot<00:05:12.919> of<00:05:13.070> poses<00:05:13.520> available

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.150 
cool I mean not a lot of poses available

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.490 
cool I mean not a lot of poses available
but<00:05:14.360> you<00:05:15.229> can<00:05:15.380> still<00:05:15.560> been<00:05:16.099> in<00:05:16.130> decent<00:05:16.610> poses

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:17.500 
but you can still been in decent poses

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.300 
but you can still been in decent poses
particularly<00:05:18.500> because<00:05:18.650> you<00:05:18.889> can<00:05:19.010> move<00:05:19.130> his

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.310 
particularly because you can move his

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:22.120 
particularly because you can move his
head<00:05:19.520> which<00:05:19.849> other<00:05:20.060> you<00:05:20.240> like<00:05:20.830> ball<00:05:21.830> joint

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:22.130 
head which other you like ball joint

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:25.120 
head which other you like ball joint
shoulders<00:05:22.550> ball<00:05:23.120> joint<00:05:23.419> hips<00:05:23.740> knees<00:05:24.740> can<00:05:24.979> bend

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:25.130 
shoulders ball joint hips knees can bend

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:28.300 
shoulders ball joint hips knees can bend
and<00:05:25.400> that's<00:05:25.580> about<00:05:25.760> it<00:05:26.650> head<00:05:27.650> moves<00:05:27.979> because

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:28.310 
and that's about it head moves because

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:34.990 
and that's about it head moves because
of<00:05:28.460> transformation

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.000 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.510
