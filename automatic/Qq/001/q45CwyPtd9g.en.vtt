00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
hot spots to images in Dreamweaver arm

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.440 
hot spots to images in Dreamweaver arm
so<00:00:04.799> firstly<00:00:05.100> what<00:00:05.310> is<00:00:05.370> the<00:00:05.490> hot<00:00:05.700> spot<00:00:05.850> if<00:00:06.180> we

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
so firstly what is the hot spot if we

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.589 
so firstly what is the hot spot if we
look<00:00:06.960> on<00:00:07.109> my<00:00:07.410> channel<00:00:08.120> there<00:00:09.120> are<00:00:09.150> hot<00:00:09.300> spots

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
look on my channel there are hot spots

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.310 
look on my channel there are hot spots
if<00:00:09.990> we<00:00:10.349> look<00:00:10.500> at<00:00:10.620> the<00:00:10.769> top<00:00:11.010> channel<00:00:11.610> panel<00:00:12.389> we

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
if we look at the top channel panel we

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.110 
if we look at the top channel panel we
can<00:00:13.349> see<00:00:13.530> it's<00:00:13.799> made<00:00:14.190> up<00:00:14.309> of<00:00:14.429> one<00:00:14.610> image<00:00:14.880> but

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
can see it's made up of one image but

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.540 
can see it's made up of one image but
there<00:00:16.020> are<00:00:16.139> three<00:00:16.320> links<00:00:16.529> on<00:00:16.770> that<00:00:16.890> image<00:00:17.100> so

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
there are three links on that image so

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.519 
there are three links on that image so
how<00:00:17.699> do<00:00:17.760> we<00:00:17.850> add<00:00:18.060> multiple<00:00:18.960> links<00:00:19.109> to<00:00:19.410> one

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
how do we add multiple links to one

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.920 
how do we add multiple links to one
image<00:00:19.710> if<00:00:20.279> I<00:00:20.460> open<00:00:20.730> up<00:00:20.820> Dreamweaver<00:00:21.060> we<00:00:21.810> can

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
image if I open up Dreamweaver we can

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.470 
image if I open up Dreamweaver we can
see<00:00:22.080> I<00:00:22.109> have<00:00:22.260> an<00:00:22.320> image<00:00:22.560> here<00:00:22.590> and<00:00:23.119> on<00:00:24.119> this<00:00:24.330> one
